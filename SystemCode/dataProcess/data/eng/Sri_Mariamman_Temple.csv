,,Bird poop everywhere,2.0,,"It looks like they haven't really kept it up in awhile. The paint is highly faded to what you see in their profile pic. There were birds everywhere and their excrement was too. I felt dirty walking around without my shoes on... and I had socks. Not exactly what you want to feel when entering into a religious environment.

Despite this, it was a good look-see. A lot of places were closed to tourists, there were more things shrouded in cloth, some dude was there fixing wheels for a cart. I was in and out in 15 min."
,,Beautiful exterior,4.0,,"This Hindu temple is right by one of the entrances to Chinatown, and it is worth stopping by just to admire the exquisite and ornate exterior. Be sure to take a picture from across the street as well. We did not go inside, as I keep hearing the outside is what is most spectacular."
,,Beautiful architecture,4.0,,Iconic Indian temple smacked right in the middle of Chinatown. I’m sure that is a long history about this temple with the number of devotees visiting each day. I have never entered the temple but only admiring the architectural beauty from the outside.
,,One of the main attractions of Singapore,4.0,,"The Sri Mariamman Temple is the oldest hindu temple. The temple was built in the Dravidian style.
Sri Mariamman Temple was allegedly founded in the years 1819-20 through the efforts of Narain Pillai, 8 years after the British East India Company established a trade settlement in Singapore. Temple changed its location at least three times, until in 1823 it received the current location at South Bridge Road. The oldest fate of the brick construction of the temple dates back to 1843"
,,Indian Temple,4.0,,"Worth a visit near Chinatown. Dates back to 1827 see photo for history. Like all temples you need to take shoes off,can leave socks on. Quiet a bit of history."
,,Not such an interesting Hindu Temple,3.0,,"As far as Hindu temples go, this isn't the most exciting or attractive by far. As usual one leaves one's shoes (socks can be worn inside) outside the temple and then enter through the large wooden metal studded doors. The temple was fairly quiet and not so much to see compared to the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple on Serangoon Road in Little India. There were a few people sitting around inside and a small number of tourists wandering around the grounds.

I did manage to find some colourful statues on the right side of the temple, but generally it wasn't as interesting as some other temples that I have visited in Singapore."
,,Hindu Temple,5.0,,The oldest and the biggest Hindu Temple in Singapore. Very interesting and unusual architecture. The entrance tower is magnificent. The temple is very close to Chinatown MRT station.
,,A good glimpse of south Indian temple,3.0,,Visit this place to experience south Indian Hindu religious place. The temple has many carvings. The door is distinctly south Indian.
,,"Disappointing, you can see the best bit from the street.",3.0,,"My first visit to a Hindu temple was disappointing, fortunately our trip took us to other Hindu temples and they were much more interesting. The facade of this one is fantastic to look at, best viewed from the other side of the street, but once you've removed your shoes and gone inside the temple compound my bet is you won't stay long, we didn't. It was all a bit scruffy inside with cardboard boxes scattered about with things in them, not much to see and very little information for visitors. If this is your only chance to see a Hindu temple it's worth a short visit but if you're going to Kuala Lumpur do the Batu Caves instead, or the temple also dedicated to Sri Mariamman in Penang."
,,Old important Hindu temple,4.0,,This temple the oldest Hindu temple is located in Chinatown. A visit worth with its colorful decoration and sculptures.
,,Fascinating Hindu temple,5.0,,"This was our first visit to a Hindu temple, and it was fascinating. You'll need to take your shoes and socks off, but there are cubbies to store them outside and a faucet for washing your feet. This is an active temple, full of worshippers as well as tourists, including some offering free food. Very crowded but nonetheless a moving experience."
,,A piece of Tamil heritage in Singapore ❤️,5.0,,I’m a huge temple lover. I love visiting different temples and naturally when in Singapore I wanted to go to the local Hindu temples. The Mariamman temple located at Chinatown Singapore is a major tourist attraction - you can see by the number of persons visiting. People from all faiths are welcome inside but kindly refrain from taking pictures of the deity inside the main sanctum sanctorium. Being here makes you almost forget that you are not in Tamil Nadu. It is an incredibly beautiful temple and very well maintained. Visitors are requested to dress modestly and remove footwear before entering the temple.
,,Sri Mariamman Temple,4.0,,"Beautiful, colorful temple in the Chinatown area in Singapore. Loads of people everywhere but absolutely stunning! A must see!"
,,"An active source of Hindu worship,",4.0,,"The exterior of the Temple contains a tower of sculpture of Hindu Deities.
Entrance requires removal of shoes, and only believers are allowed to the front of the temple. Services are accompanied by the sounds of drums and wind instruments.
See it for the architecture, but irrespective of your own beliefs, respect the true believers - some tourists were ignoring signs requesting staying behind certain points."
,,Wish we had gone in,5.0,,Lovely Hindu temple with music playing inside. Vivid colours and beautiful reliefs. This is a really superb piece of architecture
,,Oldest Hindu Temple In Singapore-1827 Vintage,3.0,,Sri Mariamman Temple is the oldest Hindu Temple in Singapore and dates back to 1827.A member of the Raffle's party who arrived in 1819 called Narajana Pillai requested land and the temple came to fruition in 1827. The most striking feature is the tower which was added in the 1930's.This is one of many interesting sights onSouth Bridge Road in China Town
,,Great people inside,5.0,,"I had such an authentic experience here, that it became my favorite thing in Singapore. As we were walking buy a family was serving food to worshipers. We got in line and joined the family and ate food with them. They were at the temple for the blessing of their child. Such s great way to connect with the culture. It is a beautiful temple, even better when you find s way to connect with the people."
,,Interesting temple,4.0,,"The Sri Mariammam temple, on the top of Pagoda Street and Temple Street, Chinatown, is a well preserved historic place in Singapore. Not only the colourful outside, but also the entrance with the doors with arrays of bells are interesting. Remove your shoes when you want to have a look inside."
,,A Historic Colorful Hindu Temple Next to the Chinetown Street Market,4.0,,"Most tours to Chinatown stop by here to see this historic colorful and unusual Hindu temple. The outside detail, which is in need of restoration, is very detailed with all sorts of richly embellished figures. It was originally built in somewhere around 1863 by some amazing artisans.

BOTTOM LINE: Well worth a look and seeing this historical structure. No cost to enter but donations are welcome. A photo pass is required to be purchased in order for you to take pictures or video inside. All who enter are required to remove their shoes and leave them outside on shoe stands. The detail of the building is amazing to see but in need of repainting of the figures. MY RATING: 7/10.

This temple is right next to the Chinatown Street Market that everyone loves to shop at for souvenirs. Modest clothing is required with no bare shoulders, midriffs, short short pants, tank tops, bare backs, etc. Think religious modesty."
,,An Interesting Hindu temple .. in Chinatown,4.0,,"We stumbled upon this temple by change, while looking for the Temple of the Buddha tooth. However, we liked it as it has a vary interesting colourful sculptured roof (pls see the pictures attached). Pictures inside are allowed, but we had no time to go inside, so we just took some photographs from the street. One has to enter barefooted, as in all Hindu temples."
,,A little bif of India outside of Lite India,3.0,,"Nice temple located right next to the Buddha temple in Chinatown. As I saw one other Indian temple in Little India 2 days before this one, I wasn't so amazed. But still nice to see some cultural diversity and explore Indian culture, if you are interested."
,,"Very colorful, especially at night",5.0,,"Enjoyed my quick visit to this temple which was right next to the hotel I was staying in in Chinatown. It was lit up nice at night and was open for viewing, even at 10pm. Just remember to take off your shoes."
,,Grand temple,4.0,,"This Hindu temple is a Heritage temple and a national monument in Singapore. It is recognized as a very powerful deity and devotees in large number visit this temple every day. Please read more about the temple in attached pictures. When we visited this temple, we could also visit nearby china town heritage center, The Buddha tooth relic temple and a mosque. Opens in the morning and evening, noon time it remain closed for darshan."
,,Singapore’s First Mandir,4.0,,"Sri Mariammam is the first mandir ever built in Singapore, dating from 1827, a few years after Raffles had secured a lease from the Sultan of Johore. Its founder, an East India Company clerk, had actually arrived with Raffles, but due to protracted difficulties in securing a permanent location for a Hindu place of worship, it took three moves and almost a decade before construction began in 1826. In the early days of Singapore, most Hindus were from South India (Tamil is still the official Indian tongue in Singapore), so it’s no surprise that this mandir is South Indian in spirit. Mariammam—Mother Mari—is the mother goddess in South India, and the goddess of rain.

As you approach Sri Mariammam, you’ll immediately be struck by the colourful monumental entrance into the temple compound. This is a gopuram, a hallmark of Dravidian architecture (as well as Khmer architecture, derived from South India: you can see gopurams, now colourless, at Angkor Wat). Sri Mariammam’s five-story gopuram consists of the actual gateway below, recapitulated by five “doorways” above, each slightly smaller than the one below, and each surrounded by colourful deities; at the very top is an ornamental cylinder, which itself is topped by a row of small golden kalasams. In India, kalasams with much longer upper points often serve as flagpoles for temple banners, but I’d be surprised if you could hoist a handkerchief onto these stub-topped kalasams. (See Gopuram photo; if you look to the extreme right of this photo, you’ll see the Buddha Tooth Temple, the most important Chinese Buddhist site in Singapore, not quite a stone’s throw away, but perhaps within sling-shot range if you’re good with a sling).

On top of the walls leading up to the gopuram, you’ll see a veritable herd of zebu, the venerable sacred white cows of India, with a pair of lions as well, one on either side of the gopuram. The cows are rather complacent about these lions, apparently having read up on the subject and realizing that lions pose no real threat in Singapore (see Zebu Lion and Gopuram photo). Look up once you’re inside the mandir compound and you’ll see additional zebu as well, sometimes flanking Lord Krishna with his flute (see Lord Krishna 1 and Lord Krishna 2 photos).

There’s a colourful and elaborately-decorated onion dome above the main shrine itself, with deities and demons, sambars and lions (separated from each other), lots of saris, and a golden finial on top, one you actually could attach a banner to (see Dome 1 and Dome 2 photos). Going past an elaborate and colourful standing column gets you to the heart of the mandir, where you’ll be greeted by the gigantic head of a fearsome warrior, sitting in a box. I have no idea what his head is doing there, but I’m confident that either it’s serving a useful purpose, or he was decapitated for a good reason. (See Entry and Decapitation photo.)

Inside, there are additional colourful deities, including Sri Mariammam herself with her scimitar protecting the main altar (see Mariammam photo). Ceilings and walls are all bright pastels; the least colourful thing I saw inside the inner sanctum was the television set. I’m not quite sure what a TV is doing inside a mandir, but if India is up by 3 wickets over Australia in the next World Cup final, a ready TV might be useful to have (see Colourful Corridors photo). Inside the mandir compound, you may see monks burning incense (easily obtained almost everywhere over in Little India) or just wandering on various errands round the grounds (see Incense and Monk photos).

If you’re lucky and there’s a festival going on, you’re certain to get a concert by the classic Carnatic musical duo of nadaswaram and thavil. The first is a double-reed wind instrument, and the second a drum; both are classic instruments of Tamil Nadu. We were lucky: a wedding started up a few minutes after we arrived. The music of the nadaswaram is believed to be auspicious and it is so loud that when played at Sri Mariamman, you can hear it in Chinatown. Proud Tamils will assure you with a straight face that the nadaswaram is the loudest wind instrument in the world that is not brass. Presumably they’ve never heard Scottish bagpipes (see Nadaswaram and Thavil photo).

Two final comments: (1) TA, following Western tourist usage, tends to call any place of worship except Christian churches and Muslim mosques, either a “temple” or a “pagoda.” Hindu places of worship are mandirs in most of India, and I use that word here, but technically, Sri Mariammam, being Dravidian, is a kovil. “Temple” will do. (2) Five years ago I was delighted to discover—and bring to TripAdvisor’s attention—a sister-kovil to this one, Sri Muthamariammam, with a spectacular nine-story Dravidian gopuram, in the spice-trading city of Matale; since then, over 200 other reviews have been submitted and it’s now one of the top-5 rated attractions there. If you’re ever in Sri Lanka, travelling between Kandy and Sigiriya, don’t miss it."
,,Oldest Hindu temple in Singapore !!!,4.0,,"The temple is located in Chinatown almost next to Buddha tooth relic temple. The Sri Mariamman Temple dates back to 1827 and is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore. It was constructed by immigrants from the Nagapatnam and Cuddalore districts of Southern India. It is dedicated to the goddess Mariamman who is believed to have power to cure illnesses and diseases.

It is now a national monument. Besides the regular worship, the temple was an important place for community activities during the British colonial era. The Singapore Government spent S$4-million towards restoration. A team of about 20 artists came from India for the same. The temple has some very ornate and elaborate sculpture and paintings at the entrance itself. The majestic gopuram or grand tower entrance is a landmark. It has six tiers which are covered with sculptures of deities, mythological beasts and other beings.

Every October or November, there is a fire walking ceremony, which is the main festival celebrated annually at the temple. Overall must visit place. We clubbed this temple with Buddha tooth rleic temple and China town visit for a day's sight seeing !"
,,Traditional Indian temple,4.0,,"Really nice, traditional Indian temple. It is located in a very good spot, easily accessible. The paint on the roof has gone - so the photo in the tripadvisor is not the exact representation. Lots of deities inside. They offer food and free lunch on special occasions as well."
,,Gorgeous temple,5.0,,Absolutely fascinating place. Tourists are welcomed and for a small fee you are allowed to take pics inside the temple. Beautiful imageries inside.
,,Beautifully maintained temple,4.0,,A must visit in Chinatown Singapore. The architecture alone on the outside is visually stunning with all the colours. Maintained really well. Modest dress is required if entering the temple so not “western” summer clothes such as singlets or shorts.
,,Traditional temple,5.0,,"I went in for dushera celebrations there , they had Navarathri celebrations the whole temple was decorated with flowers and lights , there were rituals being performed , and it’s not too crowded so it makes it worth a visit when ur in Singapore"
,,"Colourful, Vibrant & Historical Hindu Temple",4.0,,"Sri Mariamman Temple, located in Chinatown, is known as the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore. This building is very well-maintained and very beautifully decorated too. It is a good worship place to visit and understand the culture of Hindu religion and culture too. You have to remove your shoes if you want to get into the inner sanctuary of this worship place."
,,One from the history books,4.0,,"Pretty sure I read about this temple in my high school text book. Fire walkers on certain days in October. Intricate sculptures and carvings. Very colourful.

We didn’t stay long as we are not devotees. Please remember to wear attire below the knees and respect cultural customs.

Do pass by and visit when you are in the Chinatown area."
,,Historical Hindu temple in Singapore,4.0,,It is an old historical temple in the temple street in China town. It was built in the 1800s and was redeveloped recently. Take off your shoes in front of the temple.
,,Colourful & Elaborate Decor,4.0,,"We managed a look at the exterior and a couple of interior rooms while waiting on our Chinatown Walking Tour to begin. The temple dates to 1827 and is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore. The present structure was restored in 2010 and amazingly, a team of artists was brought in from India to undertake the restoration and the repainting of the stone deities. The gopuram over the entrance is six tiers covered with sculptures of deities, mythological beasts and other beings and, for me, was the highlight of the building. Services were underway and there was no access through the area roped off to others than monks and worshipper."
,,Oldest temple in Singapore,4.0,,"The Sri Mariamman Temple is considered to be the oldest temple in Singapore. It was built in 1827. It has a great entrance tower.

It is located near Chinatown. At the time of my visit, it was quite busy.

The Temple is dedicated to the Mother Goddess Sri Mariamman, and was initially used to shelter Indian immigrants."
,,What a dump!,1.0,,"Honesty, the worse and most filthy temple we came across in Singapore. Everything was blocked off except for a small roped part near the entrance. Everything seemed run down and dirty. Don't waste your time here!"
,,Historical Temple in crowded road,5.0,,I think it is one of the Grand temple in Singapore to my knowledge. It has beautiful color from entrance to inside. Unfortunately it is located on very crowded road. It is good to visit on the way to Tooth Relic Temple
,,A very peaceful place,5.0,,"It is one of the oldest temples in Singapore and is a wonderful place to visit to start the day. Adjacent to the China Town, a very well maintained temple."
,,worth visiting!,4.0,,This is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore in the heart of Chinatown. It is very much a tourist attraction and one must wear proper clothing and you must take off your shoes before entering-[you can keep your socks on] I was a little concerned about coming out of the temple and my shoes having disappeared but everyone else was doing the same thing and this was not a problem in Singapore. The art is gorgeous with spectacular paintings but there is no picture taking inside. It is well worth a visit-get there on the earlier side to avoid the crowds.
,,Gods House,5.0,,"Early morning peaceful visit to the Oldest Hindu Temple in Singapore. The Sri Mariamman Temple is an agamic temple, built in the Dravidian style. Located in the downtown Chinatown district, the temple serves the majority Hindu Singaporeans, Tamilians, in the city-state. Due to its architectural and historical significance, the temple has been gazetted a National Monument and is a major tourist attraction.
."
,,Unique,4.0,,"It’s an amazing face to face experience with something extraordinary. Not your everyday kind of architecture design, this building really looks amazing, exotic, sacred, mesmerizing and artistic. This is a religious place."
,,Hindu presence,4.0,,"Another ""Dravidian"" style Hindu temple in the heart of chinatown district and another sacred National Monument of Singapore. As all Hindu temples it's colourful and artistic with so many statues of Hindu dieties and very distinctive with it's entrance shape and statuetses. You should pay a quick visit among the Hindu peaceful community praying in th Temple."
,,Beautiful temple,4.0,,"You need to take your shoes off and leave them on a rack outside. Initially I was concerned about leaving my shoes outside but then I remembered that I was in Singapore and there is 0 chance of any theft.

Just from the outside you can see a lot of the exquisite statues and architecture. I'd never been in a Hindu temple before so I was really excited about seeing what it was like.
The temple was beautiful and there are many amazing statues and decorations. It is both functioning temple and also a tourist attraction. I think the temple could do with a bit of a clean as the statues were starting to look a bit dusty but that's a minor quibble.

Only problem I had was understanding what I could and could not do and where I was allowed to go. I didn't want to be disrespectful and so I played it safe. I didn't use my phone or camera inside (even though I wanted to take pictures of the stunning interior) and I tried to stick to areas that were obviously for tourists."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Beautifully decorated, located in Chinatown, just steps from the MRT. This is a religious place so dress appropriately and be prepared to remove your shoes outside. This is a lovely temple with much to see."
,,"Colorful, Peaceful and Huge statues",4.0,,The Mariamman temple is really a great place to visit and pray. Many tourists visit this place to worship the different deities that they have. It is one of the many temples that Singapore has. You should visit to see the beautiful statues of gods.

,,Attraction in Chinatown,4.0,,"This temple is located in the heart of Chinatown. When visiting the temple, you need to take of your shoes and leave on the shoe rack outside of the temple.

,,The hindu temple in the heart of Chinatown,4.0,,I stayed in Chinatown and the temple was a walking distance away from my place.It is a holy place and is quite symbolic for Singapore-Indians. It is near to the Maxwell Center as well.

Its located in Chinatown and clearly visible since its located on the main road. Peaceful and spiritual experience. must see place in Singapore to understand the diversity that Singapore represents.
,,Hindi temple in China Town,4.0,,"This May be confusing because this temple is in China Town. From what I understand, this is due to having all migrants in this area during the earlier years of history.
This may not be a “must visit” place in Singapore but when you get some free time and if you visit China Town, this is a good place to visit to see first hand how diverse Singapore is."
,,Beautiful Temple,5.0,,The Sri Mariamman Temple is perhaps one of the most famous temples in Singapore. We've been there on several occasions and really find it to be quite a peaceful experience to be inside the temple.

,,Beautiful Hindu Temple,4.0,,"Beautiful Hindu temple located near Chinatown. This is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore.

,,Worth a visit if nearby,3.0,,Hindu Temple near Pagoda Street in Chinatown. Worth a visit if nearby but not a special trip. Need to pay to take photos inside.
,,Worth a visit...if you are in Chinatown,4.0,,"If you leave Chinatown MTR by the Pagoda Street exit, which I think is A, and walk through the shops to the end of the street this temple is on your right.
As others have said a small fee if you want to take photos, there is a dress code and you have to remove your shoes.
Worth a visit if you are in Chinatown but probably not something I would have travelled to see otherwise."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,It is a beautiful Hindu Temple in China Town. It is definately worth the visit. If you want to make some pictures inside the temple you have to pay 5 dollars. You should wear appropriately and leave your shoes outside the temple.

We saw a wedding parade and this temple is known for the various festival processions. You could chance upon one that could further enhance your experience with Hindu culture!"
,,Singapore's Oldest Hindu Temple,4.0,,"We visited the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore recently. It was built in 1827 and is located in Singapore’s Chinatown. Sir Mariamman Temple, dedicated to the goddess who cures illnesses and diseases, was built by India immigrants. The first thing you will notice is the light colored boundary wall with sacred cows laying on top of the wall as well as the brightly painted domes and statues. The tall tower covered with sculptures of deities, mythological beasts, and other beings caught my eye. It was fascinating to look at the intricacy of these sculptures. Two wooden doors covered with bells mark the entrance. Worshippers ring these bells for good luck or to be sure the gods answer their prayers. Shoes must be removed before entering. Throughout the temple, there is much decorative detailing throughout. There are a series of small altars where you would find people worshipping. I walked into an area where many Hindus were in a serving line receiving platters of food. I realized this was also a social gathering place for worshippers and their families. Very interesting and worth a visit."
,,if your in Chinatown..its down Pagoda street-go for it!,4.0,,"its the first time i see something like this, i even attended a prayer/celebration there which is a totally new experience for me! RECOMMENDED"

,,Beautiful temple in Chinatown,5.0,,This is a beautiful Indian temple located in Chinatown and I spent some time inside watching the goings on and listening to the music. Beautiful building.
,,Interesting little Temple,4.0,,"This Hindu temple in Singapore is most notable for its interesting roof architecture, with pyramids covered in ornately decorated figures. Definitely worth stopping by if you are in Chinatown.

When I visited there was some chanting being conducted by a man outside the gates of the temple. Whilst I have no doubt that there is particular religious significance to what he was chanting, it also served as an excellent atmospheric backdrop for my visit!"
,,Fascinating: Holy Smoke and Bells,5.0,,"I arrived just as some ceremony was starting. Live music and a man with a dish of smoking oil. The procession progressed around the temple with curtains raised and each deity sculpture given a blast of smoke.

Extremely colourful pageant - I'm glad we timed it so well to arrive - 6.15pm. I'm not sure it happens every day though. Always good to get an insight into other religions and a privilege to come to the temple and see devotees enjoying their faith.

Splendidly ornate temple. A must if you are visiting Singapore. Visitor friendly."
,,Interesting and colourful,5.0,,"You need to remove your shoes before entering the temple and if you have a DSLR camera you need to purchase a permit to take photographs. We carried a spare backpack to store our shoes as we felt the doorway was on a busy road but loads of people just left their shoes on the pavement or racks.
Well worth wandering in here as it was very interesting and the wall paintings were very colourful.
You need to be respectful when people are praying and there are certain areas where tourists cannot enter, though you can still see them from outside the chains."
,,Good to see if you are in Chinatown,4.0,,"It is nice to see this temple if you are in the area, just do not forget to leave your shoes outside and respect the people who are praying.

You will only need 15 to 30 minutes to see the temple and highly recommend you to have a tour guide, who could explain you about the temple!

If you go to see this one, go to see the Buddha Temple, which it is only five minutes from this one."
,,Can’t see much from the road,2.0,,Looks plain from the street. Very busy corner. Was only doing a quick walk thru Chinatown. Lots of construction work around.
,,culture,4.0,,culture and customs of indian people is intersting enough to go there.you should take your shoes snd docks of to enter there.Taking videos and photos is not forbidden unlike chinese temples.must to see
,,Beautiful Landmark,4.0,,"It was my Free Day from Guided Tours! I decided to walk around from my Hotel to Chinatown. Took photos around as I wandered about! I suddenly stopped on my tracks when I saw This Lovely and Fascinating Landmark. It Was not even mentioned when I Booked My Tours Earlier back home. Anyway I went inside and was told that yes, I could take photos but have to pay at the small booth, which I did! I've been to so many different Temples But This Hindu Temple is quite different! I had a Ball Taking Photos and I Definitely Recommend it To Other Travellers like myself!"
,,An oasis of Hindu spirituality,5.0,,"To start off, the Sri Mariamman Temple has a very interesting setting – it's in Singapore's Chinatown, on the same street as a mosque and Buddhist temple and right down the road from a few touristy/hipster joints, and it's right next to one of the markets in the area, so one would expect some level of noise. However, all the external noises melt away you step through the temple doors (ring the bell on your entry and exit!) and you're embraced by the priests' chanting, traditional Indian music being played and fragrance from flowers and incense. It could be divinity, the place itself or the worshippers there, but going here for prayers never fails to put my mind at ease from whatever worries I might have. Do note though, that tourists are only permitted up to a certain point, encouraged to dress modestly and avoid feeding the pigeons!"
,,Interesting temple with great photo opportunities,4.0,,"This temple has lots of elaborately carved figurines both visible outside the temple and inside the compound itself. However, the color has faded. They still make for interesting pictures, just don't expect intense color. You have to take off your shoes to enter the compound. No bare shoulders and the shorts must cover the knee. They do provide shawls and sarongs for visitors that do not meet the dress code. The main prayer hall is of good size but is not that big. Only believers are allowed inside, but you can get a good view from the entrance. There are also colorful murals on the ceiling. These murals are sheltered from the sun and they do retain their intense brilliant color. Inside the compound are also rooms filled with colorful statues. All in all, this place offers interesting photo opportunities."
,,View from the outside,4.0,,"Very late in the evening when we came across the oldest temple in Singapore located around Chinatown ,so we had a peep into the interior. There is a charge for photography , but you are allowed to take photos from the outside of the temple. Recommended for all to visit as the interior of the temple is full of intricate sculptures and very interesting to view."
,,"Looks great from the outside, ok on the inside",4.0,,"The temple entrance is probably what looks the most impressive. Inside of the temple is spacious, sometimes they have some shows there. They even hand out free food but we did not like it (maybe because it is vegetarian). No more than 30 minutes to spend there."
,,Oldest Hindu temple in Singapore ... absolutely beautiful.,5.0,,"Visited here in November 2017 whilst on holiday in Singapore. It is a beautiful temple, both the exterior and the interior which has many statues and sculptures. Removal of footwear is required before entering and modest dress ( covering of shoulders and no shorts) necessary. The interior has partitioning to prevent tourists from entering sacred areas but there is still much to see. I appreciated the serenity and got some lovely photos. As someone who has never visited a Hindu temple before I appreciated being able to visit and to have a glimpse into the Hindu culture. Wonderful experience."
,,Nothing special but good experience,3.0,,"It is one of the oldest Hindu temples in singapore and it worth for you to pop in if you are in Chinatown. However, would not recommend traveling all the way just to see this temple.

Free entrance even for tourists however i heard you have to pay $3 to take photos. Important for you to dress modestly to show respect for the place of worship. The do however provide you with shawls to borrow if you are rather scantily clad. You have to remove your shoes before entering and just a warning, the floor may be very hot at noon time so do bring socks.

As with every place of worship, be respectful and quiet."
,,Experience the Indian culture,3.0,,"This is one of the oldest temples in Singapore. The sanctity and authenticity has been maintained. Since its a hindu temple, non hindus are not allowed entry beyond a certain point. Be mindful of the clothing while visiting these temples. Shorts and bare shoulder clothes not allowed."
,,Great Cultural Experience,5.0,,"I have never been to a Hindu temple before, and this is my first time. I loved the cultural experience and am really glad that I decided to go in! Worth the time!!!

One needs to remove shoes and socks before going in. There are certain areas that nonbelievers are not allowed, so please stay away these sacred areas. I didn’t buy a photo pass because there was a ceremony in session, and I didn’t want to be taken pictures while the believers were worshiping (I didn’t want to offend anyone). It was very interesting to observe. To me, everything was new, and I’m glad that I’m exposed to something that I had not known.

Highly recommend to everyone to stop by and visit. Ceremony was held around 11am in Sunday’s (I’m not sure if there are other times on weekdays). Come and experience a foreign culture :)"
,,Oldest,4.0,,"This is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore. The entry gate is very colourful. There is no entry fee. Adjacent to the Chinatown. So if you are in Chinatown, visit this place for 10-15 minutes."
,,Another Temple Worth Seeing,3.0,,"Located at the entrance to Chinatown, this is another fine example. Really colouful and beautiful inside. Worth seeing and remebering with photographs."
,,Ok,4.0,,Nice enough to see if you're in the area. Colourful and quiet. Not that big and not a lot to see. Unable to see a lot as they were setting up for a festival
,,Interesting Hindu Temple near Chinatown,4.0,,"This is said to be the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore, built in 1823 and then rebuilt 20 years later. It is dedicated to the goddess Mariamman whose power is said to cure illness and disease.

It is still a practicing Temple with many worshipers there the day I went. There are some restricted areas, admission is free but the place charges a small amount if you want to take photos which you should.

You can walk around behind the main room and there are many areas with separate prayer areas and shrines. These were particularly interesting to me and quite photogenic too. Mostly in 3d instead of paint which is a very cool effect. The temple facade is particularly interesting.

Be prepared to take off your shoes in order to enter.

Well worth a visit when in or near Chinatown, it is two blocks from Buddha Tooth."
,,Beautiful Hindu Temple,5.0,,"I loved this place. You have to make sure that you're not wearing short shorts or have bare shoulders, and take off your shoes before going in. You can wonder around in about 15-20 minutes. Bear in mind that you shouldn't approach the shrines directly where the signs say not to, even though some people were clearly ignoring it."
,,Nice Hindu Temple,4.0,,Sri Mariamman Temple is a Hindu temple built by Tamil settlers in Singapore. The temple is located at the end of the Temple street in China Town. There are no entrance fees to go inside and offer prayers. Very popular with the local Tamil population.
,,Beautiful Temple,4.0,,Very beautiful temple to see. Right outside of Chinatown so you can easily do shopping at the same time.
,,Hindu temple,2.0,,"Its interesting to see the hindu temple, however i did not enjoy this place because the floors are dirty and you have to leave your shoes at the entrance. Pavement is very hot during sunny days and dirty. Better avoid or have disposable socks with you."
,,Nice place to visit,3.0,,"If you're in the area it's worth popping in, but otherwise it's not really worth the visit. Women need to cover up."
,,Blessed,5.0,,"A holy place to feel blessed. If you want to have peaceful moment of your life, a must visit and also to know what is hinduism about."
,,Nicer temples in Singapore to visit!M,3.0,,"Hindu temple in Chinatown, very old & cramped for space. Unable to go in the temple unless you take your shoes off. Not as ornate and beautiful as some others I have seen throughout Singapore. The upkeep seems to be lacking. The only reason why I was remotely attracted to it because it was adjacent to Chinatown!"
,,A beautiful temple of Sri Mariamman,5.0,,"The near century-old temple was built by the settlers from Tamilnadu, India. A well maintained temple attracts lot of Hindus and other Singaporeans as well. They believe that their illnesses are all cured by worshiping Sri Mariamman of this temple. Marriages are also said to be fixed and are conducted here. October is the festival time.This temple very close to the popular China Town is considered as national monument nowadays.
Systematic poojas are done by the priests.
There are other shrines for other deities too in this temple.
The six-tier gopuram has many beautifully sculptured idols.
The devotion of the locals is awesome. They maintain the culture and tradition of Hindu temples till date.
The entry is free for all people of all sects and ages.
There is no question fee for anyone nor discount to visit this temple
The visitor can feel full satisfaction of the time spent here."
,,Interesting place,4.0,,This temple looks very well preserved and is open to anyone with respect for the faith that it exhibits. Beautiful decorated and interesting to learn about every day life in that temple
,,Wet feet...,3.0,,"I most say I was very desapointed about this temple, you could see that they were one of the famous temples in Singapore and that they earned money on it by taking 3S$ to take photos inside the temple, which actually aren't that great compared to some of the other Indian temples in Singapore...Another thing they can improve a lot, is doing something so the visiters shoes could be in a dry place doing rain, so they didn't get so freaking wet, and maybe put out some napkins or something so people could dry their feet when leaving, so they don't have to go around with wet feets in wet shoes."
,,Hindu Temple in Chinatown,3.0,,"If you are walking through Chinatown you'll most likely pass by the Sri Mariamman Temple. It is not far from the Chinatown MRT station on Southbridge Rd between Temple and Pagoda streets. Admission is free but if you want to take photos inside you must pay a S$3 fare at front office. Shoes must be left outside, there are spaces provided. Please remember to cover up and be respectful as this is a religious site."
,,Irony,4.0,,"Although Singapore has little India, this temple is in Chinatown! I do not know why it is built in chinatown but It was fun to witness an irony."
,,Uninspiring compared to other Hindu temples in Singapore,2.0,,"Apart from the architecture, there is very little to be seen here: no activity, no explanations. After removing our shoes, we realized that it was almost impossible to walk on the stones exposed to the sun (because they were so burning-hot). We ran from one shaded area to the other to get some photos. (A photo pass costs S$3.) Completely uninspiring compared to Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple."
,,Unkept and apparently ill managed.,2.0,,"Our family's travel to Singapore and Malaysia was aimed at seeing multiple ethnicities living together. With that aim in mind we visited Buddhist, Hindu temples, mosques and churches as much locales.

At these sites found the experience spiritual, in terms of seeing folks find meaning in worship. One doesn't need to believe in a value system to see its impact on people.

Regrettably, we found Hindu temples for some odd reason appeared unkept and ill attended. Sri Mariamman was no exception. We arrived with high hopes given all the reviews on TA and elsewhere. There was not a single soul worshipping or in any activity that would indicate a ritual even. A few people was sitting near the door inside and engaged in an what appeared to be a loud altercation.

The management needs to clean the place thoroughly and bring it up to its historic significance.

Due to this underwhelming experience our trip to the site was not memorable at all and we are perplexed at the high rating on TA. The only saving grace was that we were able to walk to the Buddhist temple and to a very different experience."
,,Hindu Temple in Chinatown ????,4.0,,"Now you wouldn’t usually expect to find a Hindu Temple in the middle of Chinatown but in Singapore you do. Apparently this area was the home to the Indian community as well until they moved to the area now known as Little India.

As a testament to the multi-cultural beliefs of Singapore, this temple was left intact and people still use it today for worship.

Unfortunately as were on a walking tour we didn’t have time to go inside but it was interesting to hear about its history and was very nice from the outside."
,,"Impressive, Not easy to find",4.0,,"The temple is a bit hidden in Chinatown, Bit it's worthwhile looking for it. It's the oldest Hindu Temple in Singapore. You need of course to take your shoes off to get in. Admission is free, donations are appreciated. I recommend about 30 minutesfor the walk inside. Photos are allowed, yet respect it's a religious place."
,,Good experience,3.0,,It was good experience for non Hindu tourists. I saw Hindu temple for first time.it is 100 meters from Chinatown mrt station.so convenient place. In my opinion needs a renovation because colors lost their shine.and you have to know that you allowed inside only if you take off your shoes. The ground was very dirty.
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,Weren't planning to visit the temple but passed it on the way to Buddha Temple. Get off at Chinatown and turn right after walking through stalls. You need to pay $3 at front offoce to take photos.
,,Very colorful carvings on the roofs,4.0,,This is worth walking by as you stroll through Chinatown. The roofs are filled with images painted in very vibrant colors. You will need to leave your shoes at the door as you enter.
,,Go inside and discover,4.0,,"After walking from the MRT Chinatown station, down the main street and at the end turn right, the entrance to the temple is on the right. Must take shoes off to enter. Well worth the visit"
,,a great place,5.0,,"This is a place of worship, it is advisable to wear polite attire. At the time of love came a bit hot weather when it was still morning. Shoes and sandals are not allowed to wear inside, there is a place to store them on the front."
,,Holy place no shoes,4.0,,They require you to remove shoes to enter. This is fine but no place to sit to lace up your boots. Also an extra cost for Photographs. It's beautiful.
,,Quick peek,3.0,,"Since this is located within China town, we opted to take a peek.You have to take off your slippers before entering the temple. We just took some pictures and head off to our shopping spree at China town. You might want to visit this place when you are within the area."
,,Great culturally enlightening stop,4.0,,"I've never really been to a Hindu Temple before so I don't really have much to base my review on, but visiting here was a great culturally enlightening experience. If you're in the area, take a few minutes to walk around and learn a bit more about Hinduism."
,,Have a look at the entrance ad move on,3.0,,"My wife and I visited the Sri Mariamman Temple while looking for things to fill our time in the larger tourist attraction of Chinatown. The Sri Mariamman temple is Singapore oldest temple, with its first build dating back to 1827. It’s free to enter and appropriate covering clothing is provided if needed but having been inside I can assure you the highlight is actually the entrance tower or ‘gopuram’ which you can visualise from the street. I would recommend just having a look at the entrance and moving along as I think tourists just annoy the genuine worshippers inside the temple."
,,Sacred and beautiful,5.0,,"When you enter this place there will be a signage to ask you take off your footwears.
This place is beautiful really and kept sacred. I see many signage that warns tourists no to enter certain areas.
I am lucky that I can hear sitar and drums played when I visit.
I thinks we can find beautiful spots for photo taking from almost all angles.
I will miss this temple."
,,The Hindu Temple,4.0,,"This is one of Hindu Temple in Singapore but the only Hindu Temple in Chinatown area, close to Masjid Jamee Chulia."
,,A very quiet haven in amongst so much activity,5.0,,Being situated right next to the very busy Pagoda Street market area I was very pleasantly surprised that this Temple was so quiet/ serene once inside. It was beautifully designed and decorated and had a completely different vibe to other temples visited which made it well worth seeing and experiencing.
,,Peaceful Place,4.0,,"This is a beautiful Hindu temple in Chinatown, very interesting place. Ornaments is colorful and pretty details. The entrance is free."
,,Beautiful Hindu temple where all are welcome (near Chinatown MRT Station),4.0,,"It doesn't cost to walk around this beautiful temple, unless you want to take pictures (3 Singapore Dollars). Just remember to take your shoes off before entering! Clothing wise: trousers for men and something that covers the legs for women. Socks or bare feet are both fine. On the top half something that covers the shoulders/modest is appropriate for both men and women.

It is not something that will take a long time to visit so if you are looking for other things nearby I would suggest visiting; Masjid Jamar Mosque next door, the Chinese market behind, the Buddha tooth relic museum (nearby), eating at the Chinese food street, or something else in the same area.

The temple is easily accessed from the Chinatown MRT."
,,Stunning,4.0,,"Although not Hindu I do enjoy seeing other cultures places of worship. It was a pleasure to walk around this temple and see and hear the the worshippers. Situated so close to China Town the building is a delight with its carvings and sculptures, painted in numerous colours. One needs to remove your shoes before entering and a fee is payable to take photos, not all the alters are for viewing as some areas are roped off and are for worshippers only."
,,Colorful and Detailed,4.0,,"I always enjoy visiting temples around the World and learning about different religions and people.
Sri Mariamman Temple is a Very visual place. Lots of color and detailed statues.
You could spend a lot of time just studying the details.
A place to visit while you are looking around Chinatown."
,,Awesome,4.0,,"Nice Indian temple in the midst of Chinatown. Great architecture and a nice calm pleasant atmosphere. Very accessible to tourists. Smile on my face, smile in my heart - what, really, can one ask for? :)"
,,Photo opportunity,3.0,,"This place is a nice place for a photo opportunity but, otherwise, I don't really see the fuss about it, unless you are venturing in to pray."
,,Nice photo if passing by,3.0,,Nice picture spot to pass by if you’re walking in the area but we only spent about 10 minutes here. You can take off your shoes and go inside the Temple (free entry) but nothing much to see.
,,Must Visit this temple,5.0,,"Singapore is not complete without covering this temple to offer prayer.
We visited on friday and had good dharson including rasadham lunch very nicely served
Special pooja on this day,friday,is must to worship
You can have delicious lunch on this day with variety offered by devoties too
Very close to China Town Metro station & also Cina Town shopping area."
,,Indian temple in Chinatown,4.0,,"Weirdly enough, Chinatown has a famous Indian temple called as the Mariamman temple which is quite beautifully designed one might add. Not much to see as such but go in and seek blessings from God the Hindu way if you happen to be in Chinatown."
,,India in Chinatown,4.0,,"Thoroughly enjoyed this visit when thete was an event of worship and offering taking place. You are only allowed inside if you remove all footwear but there is a place designated for this.

Paying a small charge 3sgd allows you to take photographs freely.

If you visit Chinatown the Temple is just next door."
,,cool to see,3.0,,We did not go inside. We had a guide and that's nice to give you more information and make places more interesting.
,,"Looks great and interesting, but........",3.0,,"From the outset, this look great and very colourful, but sadly its all a bit of a waste of time for tourists, firstly you have to be appropriately dressed, take you shoes off at the door, you are not permitted to leave them there, you have to put them somewhere else, then you get in and they want to charge you money to take pictures.

You can only go a quarter of the way in, due to us being part of the reigin, this we understand. But why have it open in the first place?

All in a fairly rude fashion, not a great experience, Id leave it if i was you waste of time."
,,Oldest Hindu Temple in Singapore,4.0,,"The oldest Hindu Temple in Singapore, it's very close to Chinatown. Colorful and intricate and worth a visit."
,,Hindu Temple on Temple street,4.0,,Go here and you can do three temples of three religions all within a few hundred metres. The middle one is the Hindu temple. Not as opulent or colourful as the Buddhist Tooth but if you are in the area you can do all three. Remember shoes off.
,,Lovely place to visit,4.0,,"This temple is lovely, needing a coat of paint outside (haha). People very nice when we asked to go in. It was very busy!"
,,Look up at the ceilings as you enter,4.0,,"This Hindu temple is the oldest in Singapore and dedicated to the mother goddess. It is on the edge of China Town, so one of the sights if in this area. Please remember to look at the ceilings when you enter as they are nicely decorated and easy to miss. It is known, appararently for a fire walking ceremony for this fortunate to visit in October or November."
,,COLORFUL HINDU TEMPLE LOCATED IN CHINATOWN,4.0,,"This is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore. It is decorated both inside and out with many religious images. This is an active Hindu temple and is a fascinating look into Hindu religious practices. Excellent photo opportunities abound, Recommend. Hope this helps."
,,A Temple to visit in Singapore,5.0,,"We were here two years ago, it hasn't changed and definitely worth a visit for it's colour and building construction. Ensure you are appropriately dressed as this is a religious temple."
,,Lots of ornate and colourful carvings,3.0,,"If you are in Chinatown and perhaps visiting the Buddha tooth relic temple just down the road, it is certainly worth including this Hindu temple in your day's itinerary. I was almost completely alone as I walked around the courtyard (beware: the concrete gets very hot in the sunshine and walking barefoot can be quite a painful experience!) It was an interesting place to visit but wouldn't come top of my list of ""must-see's"".
Shawls etc. are provided at the entrance so that you can cover your bare shoulders before entering."
,,A beautiful building....,4.0,,"A snapshot view and experience of life in the Temple.....fascinating We walked round quietly and just looked. Ladies must cover up a bit,,,,they provide a wrap. A special visit to learn about another culture"
,,"Beautiful entrance, calm in the storm.",4.0,,The most impressive carvings are at the entrance although there are still good ones inside. Not that many people go inside making it feel very calm in a very busy area. You have to leave your shoes outside but they did let us take our pushchair in. They also ask for a small fee to take photos inside. There are covers avlible at the entrance if you are not appropriately dressed. The temple is located in china town and is worth going in to if you are visiting the neighbourhood.
,,Hindu temple in Singapore,3.0,,"I visit this temple to see what is the different between temple in Bali. Temple located by the street. Really hot. You must take off your shoes and leave it outside of the temple. So if you come to the temple alone or as couple, you must waiting each other to make sure your shoes still there. It will be a bit hot inside the temple as you walk with bare feet.
Inside the temple really different with temple in Bali. The offering also different. Temple provide saroon for you to wear while walk around the temple. Its free for you to put money in donation box. Wish there is priest or anyone from temple who stand by to guide me or show how to pray at temple, as I am Hindu. I am sure lots of hindu tourist also want to pray but dont know how. As buddhist temple in Bangkok, they gave me incense and show me how to pray. Hope temple more prepare so it will be more special for us as tourist."
,,Temple,3.0,,Just look at this temple in night time. I didn't go inside of temple but there are some of people seems pray or just to do something
,,Peace amid chaos,4.0,,"As a family we visited the temple only accidentally as we walked by. The entrance is capitivating, and the beautiful live sitar music added to a most relaxing hour as we took our time to admire the handiwork of generations."
,,Very beautiful,4.0,,"This is a beautiful Hindo temple which is very welcoming to visitors.
There was a service taking place so parts were closed off. Of course you remove shoes and leave them outside. My shoulders were not covered but was haven a shawl to wear whilst inside."
,,Colourful and welcoming,4.0,,"I am not a Hindi so my review is based solely on the visual impact of this wonderful place. I don't know that I would make a special trip to see it, but it is certainly worth seeing if you are anywhere near this location. It's bright and colourful and if you are fortunate enough to be there at the time of a ritual, it is also quite a moving experience.
I must add that you are made to feel welcome here, so don't feel you are intruding."
,,Kitshy temple,3.0,,"I do not know anything about indian temples but this one is supposed to be one of the most famous and visited of Singapore. So I did visited it based on that. It is located near Chinatown and has a lot of decorated statues, which gives him a kitshy style. There are lots of local people praying and also school groups visiting. I guess it is a must-see to get a feeling of Singapore life."
,,Walk past and take a photo,3.0,,"Couldn't even get inside there were so many tourists, cross the street take a photo it looks good and keep walking down the road to the Buddha tooth relic temple - so much easier to get into!"
,,Bang in the centre of China Town,4.0,,"Get the MRT to Pagoda Street in China Town, walk to the end of the street and there is a Hindu Temple! a great place to relax and take off your shoes! Colourful art work and sculptures mean lots of people are taking pictures. Grab a bit to eat afterwards in Smith Street."
,,A must see for me,5.0,,"I work hard to make time to see this temple every time I'm in Singapore. Indians are some of the most welcoming and gentle people I've ever met. I count many as some of my dearest friends. This temple is big for Singapore and I often find music floating throughout. The only thing about this temple is they require a fee for taking pictures and another fee for videos... It's odd to me. I usually donate something anyway, but I'm not used to this request. It's a small fee, so not really an issue. I'll continue to return regardless."
,,The biggest Hindu's temple in Singapore,4.0,,I think it is the biggest Hindu's temple in Singapore. I feel so fortunate as everytime I come there is a ceremony going on. The temple members welcome us. We have to respect the Hindu's who come to pray. No money is requested.
,,Beautiful temple,4.0,,Went to the temple which is very nice. They charge A $3 to take photos inside which is worth the money.
,,"Fabulous sculptures, nice instrumental ceremony",4.0,,"At first I was not allowed to enter because I was wearing shorts. Luckily I had my big shawl which I wrapped around my waist to cover my legs and it looked like I was wearing floor length skirt. When I entered, I needed to walk barefooted. I was told to pay SGD3.00 for using my camera. It's a good thing I did not throw away the receipt because some of the people inside the temple and outside the building were annoyingly telling me to pay for taking camera shots and videos of the temple.
Anyway, I still had a pleasant time to see the fabulous designs along with the nice. instrumental ceremonial music. It only took 20 minutes to walk around, watched the Hindus and take videos and photos. I was glad I wore my socks because the floor dirts would really stick to your feet. My white socks became dirty black!"
,,Hindu temple in China town..,4.0,,"This temple is quite a land mark in Chinatown. And offers a study in contrast with another illustrious landmark in the vicinity, The Buddha tooth relic temple.

Oldest temple of Singapore, it is approx 190 years old. Typical South Indian architecture is the hallmark of the place. I would recommend a look in, if you are in the vicinity."
,,Lovely temple,5.0,,"This is such a nice temple with intricate ornation. You can walk around the temple which is nice, but be respectful of their rules"
,,hindu temple in chinatown,3.0,,So we visited this attraction in the afternoon and we were told it will open for visitors only by 6pm. There is a dress code and camera fee if you wish to click pictures inside the temple. No shorts or sleeveless allowed. you will have to wear a drape if your attire is not appropriate. we went in around 6 when the aarti was on. Its ok and can be missed. Nothing very great about it. You need to get off at chinatown and head twds pagoda street. ask anyone for the temple and they will help you out. its at the end of pagoda street
,,Oldest Hindu temple,3.0,,This is the oldest Hindu temple and dates back to 1827. This colourful temple with ornate and elaborate details is located in Chinatown. Visitors should have appropriate dressing and removal of shoes before entering the temple as a mark of respect.
,,"Beautiful outside, but...",3.0,,"Having visited a similar temple in Little India, I concluded that visiting this temple was a waste of my time. There was no one to ask during my visit.

Saw a sign that says that using one's camera to take pictures is S$3! There was nothing worth taking pictures for. I quickly put on my shoes back and left."
,,One of the famous Hindu Temples in Singapore,4.0,,This temple is located in china town. This is built in South Indian (Tamil Nadu) style. The presiding deitiy is Maha Mariamman. The rules that are followed in Tamil Nadu temples are not followed here which spoils the real Hindu temple atmosphere.
,,Hindu temple in the heart of Chinatown,4.0,,"This is an authentic, working temple, nad quite rightly, parts are not open to the general public.

The temple welcomes all faiths, if shoes are removed nad conservative clothing is worn.

I small charge is made for camera use, but entry is free.

The temple is highly ornate nad the old building makes an amazing contrast to the high rise blocks behind.

Worth a visit when in Chinatown and visiting the nearby Buddhist temple."
,,Sacred ..,4.0,,"I'm not really fond of temples specially I'm not the religious type of person, but when I saw this temple the feeling was soooo different which I can't definitely explain. It is just so amazing how the Hindu can preserve everything about their religion."
,,Outside visit around site,4.0,,"An interesting and ornate Indian temple, situated in Chinatown ! A sign of religious harmony in Singapore . It is very beautifully decorated with statues and colorful details."
,,Indian in Chinatown,4.0,,"Nice gopuram, clean and well looked after. The contrast between the placid, brightly coloured deities and cows and the steel and glass towers behind them is quite pleasing."
,,Tamil culture in Singapore,4.0,,"Located near Pagoda street, the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore. Gives the divine feel of Indian temple in Singapore. a must vist"
,,A beuatifully detailed temple,4.0,,"This religious, Hindu place of worship, is located right on the doorstep of Chinatown.
The main entry is along South Bridge road and on the corner of Pagoda street.

Sri Mariamman Temple is the oldest in Singapore and is only one of many dotted around the city, with a majority within Little India.

A beautifully detailed temple that is dedicated to the goddess Mariamman, (hence its name) and known for her power to cure illnesses and disease."
,,Very nice!,5.0,,We passed this beautiful temple at the back of China town and were attracted by the colourful carvings on the facade and the sound of chanting. We took our shoes off end respectfully entered and watched the ceremony. Very interesting and beautiful.
,,Fire walking ceremony,2.0,,"Beautiful temple with heartless committee members. No chairs for elderly people to sit. Committee members treat people like dirt. Fire walking ceremony, for God sake anticipate n use your sense to cater to elderly's needs. Committee members walking around pretty n flashing their golds but left their brains at home I guess."
,,South Indian temple,5.0,,This is one of the famous South Indian Temples . It is best to go in the morning or evening . Many a times they give you little food . That is called Prasad..it is very tasty as it is supposed to be a gift from god .
,,Beautiful place to visit,4.0,,"Hindu temple, right next to Chinatown, not far from MRT. You can go in, just remove your shoes first. Free entry, good place to sit and have some time out. There was a ceremony when we visited. It is only small so not a lot of room but worth a look if you are there. I really enjoyed this temple."
,,beauty hindu temple.,4.0,,beauty hindu temple. center of the city near chinatown street market. you get to know hindu worship and culture.
,,Beautiful small temple,4.0,,"One of the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore, right in the China town center. Decorations is colorful and beautiful, lucky for us there is a ceremonial when we go there. It is worth for a quick 10 minutes visit and take some pictures."
,,Solo walking to Rafle city,5.0,,I was walking back to the centre when I discovered this temple because a ceremony was in process and very joyful
,,"Nice to see, but not a must do...",3.0,,"The Sri Mariamman Temple is a nice looking temple and a pleasant place to visit, but it is rather small and isn’t full of awe inspiring architecture or religious wares. Being in China Town is easy to get to and from. You will be required to remove your shoes prior to entry and they are kept outside the front door, without security, they could go walkies….and if it is raining will get wet."
,,Nice Temple for a Quick Visit at Chinatown,3.0,,"This is one of the main temples in Singapore. Located at Chinatown.

Entry is free. Be respectful and don't wear any shoes into the temple. There's signs to remind you to do that in front of the temple.

There's a lot of colour and statues that decorated around the whole temple. It only takes a little time to make your way around and cover the temple compound."
,,Nice and colourful,5.0,,It's a lovely temple which you may visit in Chinatown. Its colours are amazing. Take off your shoes and enjoy its peaceful atmosphere. Quiet oasis in a hot city. A lot of visitors just sit down and relax. There wee lots of Hinduists when we visited as well.
,,Lovely temple,4.0,,"Lovely temple right on the edge of Chinatown, free admission to get and remember to take off your shoes! Lots of bright colours and carvings so lots to see"
,,beautiful,4.0,,"the sculptures are very beautiful. it is interesting to see the south indian culture.
it is easy to find at the end of the main street in china town.
the entrance is free .
give it a try you will not be disappointed. you can make many pictures."
,,Colorful if Nothing Else,3.0,,"Sri Mariamman Temple is a major Hindu temple on the corner of Temple Street and South Bridge Road in Singapore's Chinatown.

Like many other Hindu temples I have visited it is totally over-the-top in its decor and colorations of the multitude and complexities of the Hindu gods and deities that are worshipped here.

Sri Mariamman is vey much an active temple and you will find local Hindus performing their devotions at any time you visit. So as a tourist and a visitor dress conservatively and act respectfully, and whatever else you do, don't forget to take off your shoes or you will upset the worshippers."
,,Burning floors,3.0,,"After having visited the Sri Mariamman temple in Kuala Lumpur just days previously, the one in Singapore really did build on that start. Unlike in Kuala Lumpur, the temple here is grand, clean, and colourful - with statues decorating every rooftop.

One must remove shoes before entering, and therein lay the source of our problem with the place. It was midday on an extraordinarily hot summers day, and the floor burned like hot coals to stand on. Most of the shaded indoor areas are fine, but outside seriously watch out - especially by the unprotected storage racks.

One can buy a photo pass, but if you are sneaky you can probably get away without for just a few photos. It was a nice quick stop, but not a huge destination as, unlike its equivalent in Saigon, there is little information to be gathered. It is, therefore, probably best done alongside the Buddhist and Islamic temples adjacent."
,,Respect,5.0,,"I attended a tour to learn about the religion and their traditions. It was very helpful. I had gone in there alone but had many questions I wanted to ask. After the tour she explained how one could come alone and ask at their small window for information. I still can close my eyes and smell the inscense and the sounds of the instruments playing the traditional music. Very peaceful place. Please dress according to their customs. Treat others as you would like to be treated. The Sculptures are so well crafted you feel as if someone is present in the statue. The bright colors and smell of the fresh flower offererings are very unique.It is a very old Temple, but taken very good care of."
,,One of the oldest temple in Singapore,4.0,,"If you are heritage lover, you should visit this heritage temple in Singapore. Considered to be oldest in Singapore"
,,Arul Mihu Singai Mariamman and its fire walk!!!,5.0,,"Paradoxically in the middle of Chinatown, this is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore, originally built in 1823, then rebuilt in 1843. You can't miss the fabulously animated, Technicolor 1930s gopuram (tower) above the entrance, the key to the temple's south Indian Dravidian style. Sacred cow sculptures grace the boundary walls, while the gopuram is covered in kitsch plasterwork images of Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver and Shiva the destroyer.

Every October, the temple hosts the Thimithi festival (Fire Walk) devotees queue along South Bridge Rd to hotfoot it over burning coals!
The fire-walking ceremony is held in honour of Draupadi Amman, who is considered the reincarnation of the Hindu goddess Mariamman. Married to the five Pandava brothers, Draupadi was forced to prove her purity by walking on fire, and emerged unharmed. The festival of Thimithi is celebrated to commemorate this event.

During the ceremony, the chief priest leads the festival procession from Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple at Serangoon Road and reaches Sri Mariamman Temple after a four-kilometre walk. There, devotees will walk across hot coals to prove their faith."
,,Beatiful temple - amazing building,5.0,,This temple was easy to find - was not busy in the morning and was an amazing building and experience. Some reviewers have said the staff was indifferent or rude. I can see what people mean but don't forget this is a place of worship - it is Singapore law that all places of worship are open to all other faiths but not all tourists respect the religious importance of the building. Be discrete and respectful and you will love the experience.
,,Amazing and historic building,4.0,,We were also lucky to be here on a holy day when ceremonies were being held. Worth going to see; we didn't go in but were able to observe from the entrance.
,,Colourful Indian Temple in an unexpected location of Chinatown,4.0,,Wander along the Chinatown market street and this gorgeous colourful temple just appears. It is very photogenic and the colours just stand out against the surroundings.
,,Best avoid,1.0,,My wife and I visited the temple earlier his week and here is why it should be avoided - pick Pocketers (come on this is Singapore) - very run down -rude staff - hygiene standards of staff and other guests are very poor
,,Very beautiful,4.0,,Of all the temples in India that I've been to this one was by far the prettiest and the most beautiful here and Singapore It's beautiful and it's really colorful they do require you to take off your shoes when you go into the temple
,,A new experience.,4.0,,"I always enjoy the atmosphere and grandeur of cathedrals and churches on holiday, so this temple seemed obligatory. It's just on the edge of Chinatown and it's market, so can be combined with a visit there.

It's got to be one of the most flamboyant and colourful place of worship I've ever seen. There are many deities represented from the vast Hindu pantheon, and whilst most visitors were tourists there were some devotions in progress, and I felt as if I were intruding a little.

That aside, I'd recommend a visit. Be aware that shoes cannot be worn inside."
,,Best Indian Temple in Singapore,3.0,,"If you have never visited an Indian temple, this is a beautiful one, probably, the best Indian Temple in Singapore. But if you compare with other temples around the world is not so extraordinary."
,,Nice way to experience another culture,5.0,,"This is a lovely place, right next to ChinaTown, so easy to find (you can get a Hop on/Hop off bus or the MRT which is minutes away).
Some people were not paying to take photos, its only $3 (Singaporean) and goes towards the upkeep, so in my mind it is worth it, plus I didn't need to sneak around with my camera, so I made the most of it, I got some nice shots of people and I asked if they were in payer, if I could take a photo, all were ok with it which was great :)

The temples and shrines were lovely, it's amazing the level of detail - well worth a visit, and let's be honest, you're going to visit China Town so go here too, its right next door"
,,Beautiful,3.0,,Pretty nice temple: nice architecture and sculptures but a bit dirty and not as impressive as some others we saw. Had to pay $2 to take photos inside which was odd.
,,Just look outside in the entrance hallway,2.0,,"very rude staff, I turned back around because of their manner and didn’t go in. You need to cover up in this temple (I did expect this and had a scarf for my shoulders and hair) but the signs weren’t clear, there are only on one side of the temple, there is an entrance on the left and on the right. There are garments available to use to cover yourself up, I only had shorts and a vest top on which the staff weren’t happy about but the way they spoke to me was disgusting. It’s quite dilapidated and not very special unfortunately."
,,DONT MISS,5.0,,Adorable temple - must see - highly reccomended - remember to pay if you like to take picture is a form of respect - no entrance fee
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"A bit underwhelming and nothing much to see. Needs investment to spruce it up - looks neglected. Luckily, close by a lots of other things to see and buy."
,,Religious Places like this needs time to pause and know or at least acknowledge that there is God :),5.0,,I was in awe as the rich culture of Asia is just in front of me. I cannot help myself but to be grateful I had the opportunity to witness such a glory....
,,Different places of worship!!,4.0,,"This Southern Indian or Sri Lankan temole is prodatypical of sub-continent places of worship...I saw a similar one in Chiang Mai, TH. Stroll around the grounds and observe the many differents Gods or deities carved in reluef in stone. Impressive and unique."
,,Pray for good luck,4.0,,"This morning visited this temple located at South Bridge Road (Chinatown).

At 7.45am, the temple was having a ritual. Many devotees were asking for blessings. More and more people started coming in. Colourful interiors, many little shrines and many deities. One temples but many gods and goddesses. One shrine was dedicated to the Elephant God ""Ganesha"".

Admussion is free but video camera ($6) & camera ($3) need to pay a fee at the counter next to the entrance. Took the pictures discreetly using a mobile phone but I did not pay.

About 20 minutes to complete touring."
,,Underwhelming,2.0,,"The entrance looks amazing, but inside is not very much to see. The sign said ""no shoes beyond this point"" which is of course understandable, but the floor could have been better taken care of."
,,A nicely located temple,4.0,,This temple is located near Chinatown MRT and is located near a busy marketplace. The temple has a very divine atmosphere and the rituals are conducted very well.The temple is quite old and the carvings and sculptures are very good
,,A Very Special Place,5.0,,"The artwork inside this temple is breathtaking. I enjoyed the smaller more intimate nature of this temple and we experienced it while worshipers were present, The exterior carvings were also terrific."
,,hindu temple in singapore,5.0,,"Well coming to little india means . its place of land for our indians. every where here indian people ,indian culture, indian tradition, and too indian food ,indian god also very famous in little india. we confuse when we visit this ,because where we are in india or singapore. this this temple is very nice and build above 50 years ago .its have great heritage."
,,Go in with Low Expectations,4.0,,"There isn't much to this Temple and I've been in a lot of temples of this style. This one is good to go inside if you haven't been in anything like it. Just don't expect much. You take off your shoes, you go inside and stay behind the tourist barrier, look around, then walk out. I took my parents in there and we were inside for probably 5-10 minutes. You have to pay extra to take pictures which isn't worth it to me. You can stand outside and take pictures shooting inside. The most interesting part is the outside. It's easy though so slip off your shoes and take a peak inside."
,,Very colourful temple one must visit,4.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this colourful temple where we did not feel out of place or character, so warm was the welcome by the believers"
,,Worth a 5 minute view,3.0,,Amazing figurines all around. Women have to be covered and everyone has to take their shoes off. The grounds are sticky and very hot so your feet will be a mess but it's worth a quick look. Also restricted from getting close to the actual altar. But it's free.
,,Interesting & Colourful Temple,4.0,,Well worth a visit if you are in the area. highly photogenic both inside and out. Close to Chinatown MRT.
,,An explosion of colour and art,4.0,,"Walking out of the Chinatown met, this was the last thing I expected to see. It was after a whole heap of knick knack shops and then just as you over seeing these shops it is like an explosion of joy that can only bring a smile to your face.

Definitely tie it in with your trip to Chinatown."
,,Noon Time Service Best Time To Go,4.0,,"The Chinatown MRT stop is an easy way to get here. After a leisurely stroll up the main alley lined with the usually Chinatown style shops and stalls you'll find this temple. There's shelving outside the entrance for your shoes as you must remove any footwear before entering. Ladies if you have a sleeveless top or shorts/skirt that exposes your knees you'll be given a very light smock to wear. I was lucky enough to arrive at noon which means I got to experience a traditional prayer ""ceremony"" which included two guys playing some sort of wind instrument and a drum very loudly. This added to the general atmosphere and made it feel quite exotic. In total I was there for about 20 minutes which was adequate to take in the other parts of the temple. I made a donation of $5 to ""cover"" the cost of being able to take photos. Well worth going as part of general afternoon of taking in the sights of Chinatown."
,,interesting,4.0,,"Was Told by taxi driver this was the tooth relic temple - it isn't it is down the road - neither is this the temple in little india as some reviews think - it is in China town.

The problem with places like this is finding the way to understand and respect it without being a voyeur. A small and interesting place which can mainly be seen from outside but is better from the inside - small but very interesting. Worth finding out if it is closed for cleaning as it was on our first visit. WARNING - footwear needs to be removed and left on racks outside - clearly marked and obvious, however, be aware that the ground is painfully hot in the sun and a large number of visitors fail to understand this simple instruction and stand in the doorway removing shoes and blocking the entrance whilst your feet burn, then take shoes in with them and get shouted at then leave them in a heap in the doorway - to take photos needs a ticket costing 3 sgd and more for video otherwise it is free/donations."
,,Beautiful Temple,5.0,,We had only about 20 minutes to visit this beautiful temple. We found it fascinating and well worth a visit inside the temple. We took photos and were not charged a fee as someone else noted previously. Be prepared to remove your shoes.
,,The Oldest Hindu Temple in Singapore,4.0,,"We visited this temple around midday when they were closing for their 6 hour break. As such, we just managed to enter the front of the temple briefly. However we could clearly notice it is quite a big complex with several other areas of interest.

As expected we had to remove our shoes at the entrance but were surprised to be asked to pay money if we were carrying cameras or video cameras.

The architecture is typical of Tamil style Temples - ethnic Tamils comprise the vast majority of Singapore's Indian population.

Recommended for all tourists irrespective of their race or religion."
,,Must see in little india,5.0,,Should go inside to see how nice it is It's located in little india area so not difficult to find. Highly recommended for people who.like temple
,,Tamil Temple design,4.0,,The tamil temple design which we have all around Tamil Nadu is done as such and its beautiful with colours and well maintained. Since people from South India would not have much effect in seeing the temple since its in the same design.
,,Nice,4.0,,Don't go as a special visit but do as part of a general city tour walkabout. Full of colour as you would expect.
,,Greate design on the top,5.0,,"It displayed about the culture and greate design on the top of temple. So many people come to visit and enjoy with beautiful things and also good to see different cultures, religions."
,,Better to visit Batu Cave Malaysia,2.0,,There is not so much to see considering there is so many restriction within the temple. Before you could take a picture you must pay 3 singaporean dollars. Batu Cave is more freely in allowi ng their guests or visitors to move freely around. The trek in Batu Cave is challenging but worth it to see the view on top.
,,Well maintained by local Tamils,4.0,,Nice temple. Well maintained by local Tamils. Even the non-hindus enjoy temple activities here. Keep shoes on rack outside.
,,Beautiful from the outside,3.0,,"Unfortunately there is some construction going on and we couldn't find out how to get inside, or even if we could! No signage to help tourists. But it certainly is something to stare at...."
,,Nothing very special,3.0,,Sri Mariamman temple is close to Buddha Tooth relic temple and in China town. Nothing very unique or special as such. This is like any other normal temple.
,,Exotic and beautiful,5.0,,This very old temple is in good repair and upkeep. Many visitors go there for a blessing from several priests that available. It's not a big property but a lot to see. The requirement of removing your shoes is honoured by all. If you want to take photographs you will pay SG$3.00. Plan your visit to Chinatown when visiting this temple as they site side by side.
,,Very Interesting,5.0,,This temple is very interesting primarily from the outside. It is colorful and very unusual. Go inside as well as it has many small prayer area. There was a wedding there when we went so we were excited.
,,Beautiful Temple,4.0,,"Great temple to see, plenty of photo opportunities, would be better if there was some explanation of what you see. Difficult to understand for none Hindus"

,,preserved Hindu heritage.,5.0,,"Situated in the most ""secular"" temple street in China Town, Started in 1827 by an Indian Narayana Pillai and kept pristine following the shastras and maintaining its dignity amidst a fast changing culture in a very affluent world, Sri Mariamman Temple is an Iconic Place of worship for Hindu and non Hindus alike. You can see many od them coming in and paying there reverence and respects asking for vows and paying the grateful thanks. Very beautifully kept inner precincts of the temple remind you of other such places that can copy it in India. make a must visit!"

,,Fascinating,4.0,,"For those not familiar with Hindu Temples, this is a great one to see. The architecture is amazing and the people in and around the temple are friendly and happily answer questions about the Temple itself or Hinduism in general (if they are Hindu :) )"
,,In pictures looks more beautiful :(,3.0,,"I was expecting this temple to be the most impressive sight in the Chinatown, but it wasn't. It was a total chaos inside, loud sounds and we got out as fast as possible :("
,,average temple,3.0,,"it is located in the little india, easy to find out. not very charming one. u may see if u r here and have time"
,,More to Admire!,5.0,,"I'm not sure why others said they couldn't enter the temple. We were able to enter with no problems just abide and respect the dress (no shoes, covered shoulders and knees for women). It was very educational and beautiful. We did have a guide there explaining the history to us, but many people were there just touring the area solo and were able to go inside. I think to get the most out of the visit it would be better to have a guide (we used indiesingapore) and it made the visit educational and personal too as our guide shared a few good real life examples of how this temple helps the locals/new patriots of Singapore."
,,"Heaven Scent In The Midst of Shrines & Deities, Art & Architecture",4.0,,"Singapore's oldest Hindu temple stands in the Chinatown precinct.

The adage ""God Made Man & Man Made God"" resonates with every chant and prayer amidst worshiping bliss.

Bare bodied holy men with a cloth wrapped around the hip, with one hem slung over a shoulder, Reminiscent of scenes out of an Indiana Jones movie.

For non-Hindus, non-Indians, experience the difference. Admission is free. One also have to be completely free of footwear. No shorts, no singlets are allowed. Womenfolk have to cover up bare arms and leg parts. Ommm,

Its a colorful and interesting encounter.

See the pics."

1. Beautiful Carvings
2. Cultural/ Religious Place of Hindus
3. Very Colorful/Vibrant
4. A different kind of ambiance and experience
5. Go fully clothed so as to respect the deity - cover legs especially
6. Experience the Aarti (the religious ceremony where the deity is worshiped) for a different feel

For Indians -
1. North Indians should go as the temple offers unique architecture and ambiance
2. South Indians can skip because India has much better options"
,,Vibrant culture: The Sri Mariamman Hindu Temple,4.0,,"I've been fascinated with temples, either it's a Hindu or a Buddhist or any temple. I find it very interesting to learn more about the culture and the faith/belief. In the middle of a busy Chinatown, you can find this temple where our Hindu brothers and sisters meet to celebrate and practice their beliefs."
,,Really cool wooden facade/roof structure ... really interesting to see an interesting ceremony going on.,4.0,,Really cool wooden facade/roof structure ... really interesting to see an interesting ceremony going on. Cool mantras and music were on scene when we were there briefly in January.

,,A wonderful taste of South India in Singapore ...,5.0,,"This is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore, dating from 1827, though most of it was built in the 1860s, and it was last restored six years ago. It can be found in Chinatown, not too far from the Chinatown MRT station.

I would thoroughly recommend visiting it as it has some very colourful ceiling paintings and sculptures, and is open from 7 a.m. to midday and then again from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. We were lucky enough to see many devotees worshipping and even a small procession of musicians under a brightly-coloured umbrella. People were quite friendly and we took care not to intrude too much on their worship.

Dress respectfully, remove your shoes, and remember to display the small sticker you will be given when you pay to use a camera - about 3 Singapore dollars, and well worth it. It might be worth taking some wet wipes to clean your feet afterwards - we forgot, but the floors were reasonably clean!"
,,Good Ethnic !,4.0,,"I Visit Sri Mariamman Temple on December 2015. Very interesting, but unfortunately you can't enter this temple, you just can see and look from outside. the architecture are very unique and spiritual."

,,Cultural,4.0,,"I visited this temple out of curiosity and liked what I saw. It seemed that there was a celebration going on as quite a few people visiting. Had to take off my shoes to go in, which may be a problem for some people, and also had to pay a small fee to take photos inside the temple (only a couple of Singapore Dollars)"
,,Typical Indian Temple in Chinatown,4.0,,"Not recommending a visit to Chinatown, while you came anyway do not miss to explore this temple on the eastern edge of Chinatown. It's one of the two reasons to come here, at all. Beautiful and colourful."
,,Singapore harmony,4.0,,"Apart from this beautiful Hindu Temple, which is free to visit, another thing left a big impression on me.
The Sri Mariamann Temple is in Chinatown. In the very same street in a distance of few hundred meters there are three religion temples - a Muslim Mosque, this Hindu Temple and a Chinese Buddhist Tooth Relic Temple."
,,Very beautiful,5.0,,It is very beautiful place. It happened there was a wedding ceremony when I was there. Traditions and people wearing beautiful clothes make this place surreal.
,,Beautiful colourful temple,4.0,,We stumbled on this as part of our walk around Chinatown. Going in we shed our shoes and females were provided with a wrap. The ornate and vividly colourful tableau were amazing... A building quite unlike most of central Singapore - very peaceful.
,,stunningly beautiful,4.0,,"These shrines, several here in Singapore, are always a good visit. They are just so beautiful, words defeat me (unusual). This shrine amongst others are always good for a visit. Don't forget to take your shoes off if you go inside."
,,Great culture and religion,4.0,,"It is very nice place to try understand the mind set and the details of Hindu religion and culture. Vivid art, beauty, ancient believe and mystery makes this place a remarkable temple."
,,Colorful Photo Op,3.0,,"Put off by the commercialization of this Hindu temple---first thing upon entry you are asked for donations and if you want to take photos inside they ask that you pay for the privilege!
That aside the exterior of the temple is ornate and colorful. If you plan on going in bring socks and wear long pants or below the knee dresses."
,,"Soul of Spirituality, Steeped in Tradition",5.0,,"Sri Mariamman Temple offers the Finest in Inner Peace & Strength derived from Ancient Hindu Prayers & Traditions. The Temple is maintained Spotlessly Clean. Hindu Vedic Prayers & Ancient Traditions are Scrupulously practised, giving the devotees a matchless spiritual experience. Sri Mariamman Temple is a Must-Visit for all Hindu Devotees."

Leave your footwear outside the temple. Do not touch the statues. Respect the locals who are there to pray. Your selfies or photographs should not cause inconvenience to the devotees there. Admire the statues, artwork and architecture of the temple."
,,Nice and Colorful,4.0,,"Just a couple of minutes walk from Chinatown MRT. The roof of the temple is very colorful and full of intricate and interesting sculptures. Too bad I did not go in as you need to take off shoes, which I fully understood why. However, the shoes were all scattered outside just facing the main road and I didn't feel secured. Temple looks great even from the outside. Will definitely visit another time."
,,Very nice,4.0,,"Representing Singapore's strong Indian community and Hindu community, this temple stands out for its unique architecture and will remind you of India. Definately worth a photo of the facade. We didn't bother going in as we had already seen quite a few temples during our visit."

,,Located in Chinatown,4.0,,This is a fine example of Hindu Temple architecture and is in keeping with those we have visited in India. It is in need of some maintenance as it is the oldest in Singapore.
,,The best maintained hindu temple I've seen,5.0,,"This is very colourful and there can be seen also noisy and smelly rituals as I did myself. So this is for all senses. Basicly this is the same kind of hindu temple as they are in India or Bali, but the colours were brighter here than anywhere else. The sun in very bad for the paint and hindu temples must be repainted all the time to make them look like this.

It was nice to see rituals too, but my kids were bit afraid of the noise. The music was really loud!"
,,"Not worth it, photos deceiving",1.0,,"The photos of this temple online make it look glamorous but once you are there it's not so glamorous!

Pigeons all along the walls and the inside is dull and dark. Lots of no entry points but the con is at the entrance where you are asked to pay $3 to take photos or $6 for videos. Much better Buddhist temples and mosques to see (Sultan Mosque is amazing!) and for free!"
,,Good to see such temple outside India,3.0,,"Remove your shoes outside. No short dresses allowed. Look at paintings, idols, architecture, etc. You may lucky to get prasad at your visiting time."
,,Ancient Hindu Temple - Definitely Worth a Visit!,4.0,,"This old Hindu temple in the Chinatown part of Singapore, is a visual feast. The architecture is typical and the stone work in intricate.

You will find it crowded at times with devotees mingling with tourists.

There is some kind of a dress code and the temple is closed at times. You need to remove your footwear before you get in. Cameras are allowed."
,,Beyond Expectation,3.0,,Indian people can not expect such a nice temple out of India. It is very nice and colorful.Inside is also you get good feelings. If you have enough time after visiting all main attractions then you should visit this temple
,,Beautiful Hindu temple!,5.0,,"This is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore. The beautiful exterior will have you wanting to pay a visit inside. Ladies must be dressed appropriately and have your shoulders and legs covered, and everyone must take your shoes off prior to entering. There is a sign saying you have to pay a fee to take pictures inside but this was not enforced. I got to witness the beginning of a ceremony taking place. It was a great experience to see this part of the Indian culture up close."
,,Hindu Temple in Singapore,3.0,,It's a Hindu Temple in Singapore named Sri Mariamman Temple. Indian Hindu culture have been shown inside there
,,Amazing building and decorated walls,5.0,,"First time I had visited this area of Singapore - at the end of Pagoda St in Chinatown.

The buildings and wall statues are intricate and of meaning to the Hindu faith.

I wondered around the outside taking pictures as I didn't have the time to tour inside.

This temple is well worth seeing."

,,An architectural beauty,5.0,,"This temple is beautiful, inside and out. We spent a lot of time exploring Singapore and finding as many mosques and temples as we could. We took a good look round this one and it is fantastic - the artwork in the statues is amazing. You aren't allowed in in Shorts, however there are overskirts to wear to hide your legs and you can then visit the inside of the temple. There is usually an old man who will charge you $3 to take photos but its a small price to pay. Beautiful architecture!"
,,Family visit,3.0,,Great feel for the place and the views from outside were interesting. Only thing is that you need to have shorts over the knee to get in which one hadn't picked up from prior reading of the reviews.
,,amazing Indian temple in Singapore,4.0,,very surprising to find such a cultutral master piece in such a modern city. the temple gives an insight into Hinduism
,,Nothing much and not many people,3.0,,"Although this is the most well-known Hindu temple in Singapore (I assume so because it's the oldest Hindu temple here), I found it pretty ""empty"" inside both in terms of structures and such and in terms of people; the only buildings inside are the Wedding Hall with paintings on the ceiling right inside the entrance gate and the tomb (or shrine) building just kind of continuous from the Wedding Hall, and there was no lineup of people in front of the tomb building. Unlike here, there are quite a few Hindu temples in Chennai that I've been to where there are additional structures like smaller shrines inside the compound besides just a tomb building and a wedding hall (which I believe are the essential structures for any Hindu temple) and where there would be people lining up in front of the tomb building with a priest giving blessings and such. The reason for the lack of people here though may be attributed to timing; it was about 3 pm when I was here, and that's the time I found those in Chennai closed for the afternoon, so it's possible that there would be more ""action"" at this place with worshippers during the day and in the evening. Also to admire here are intricately carved sculptures of Hindu deities on the upper part of the entrance gate (as can be seen actually at all Hindu temples, just variations in the size of that upper gate structure) and some animal sculptures (mostly of cows) on the walls of the temple compound.

There are buses on South Bridge Rd. that will drop you off pretty much right in front of the temple (cross the street to the other side after getting off the bus); or you could take the MRT to Chinatown station (blue & purple lines), and then it's just about a 5-minute walk down Pagoda St. (through Chinatown) toward South Bridge Rd. where you turn right and you'll see the temple pretty much immediately on your right.

Also, just a little further walk of like less than 5 minutes past this temple (or you could do after this temple by turning right once you've come out of here) and you'll be right in front of the big four-story-or-so Buddha Tooth Relic Temple which, in my opinion, is the best temple in Singapore that every tourist should check out."
,,Not much going on,3.0,,"When I was there not much was going on, however I believe it must be great when there is a ceremony because it's really huge inside and very centrally located."
,,Magic,5.0,,"Can feel all magic of buddhas barefoot, amazing experience , recommend for all and everyone. Very nice chain - Chinatown, Sri Mariamman and all new buildings around."
,,Feel India!,5.0,,"When in Singapore, how nice you feel if you are an Indian and you get to go to a temple. Of course, there are many Indians. There is Little India, the Mustafa, Dhobighat and all. But still, you feel proud when Sri Mariamman Temple makes you feel that you are in India. Visit the temple. We did go there."
,,Hindu temple,3.0,,"A Hindu temple in China, stuck between mosque and a Chinese Buddhist temple. Now this is in my opinion the real attraction. Three world religions existing side by side, I hope they do so in harmony."
,,Most beautiful Hindu temple in Singapore,4.0,,Please make sure to visit this ancient temple built in 1827. During navavrathri festival days Amman is worshipped for Nine days. You have to buy tickets for camera. The temple is very well maintained. It's located in China Town.
,,Street of Harmony,4.0,,"The oldest Hindu temple, Sri Mariamman Temple at 244 South Bridge Road is located in close proximity with the Buddhist Relic Temple at Sago Lane and adjacent to one of the oldest mosques, Masjid Jamek at Mosque Street. The three religious institutions retain their own sense of identity and each contribute to the dynamic cultural diversity along this same stretch of road in China town.

Few countries in the world enjoy such great peace and harmony with different religious institutions co-existed with one another at the same place. Singapore is proud to be an unique example.

While we have multiple distinct colors in a rainbow, the colors eventually converge, combine and integrate into one single streak of powerful white light. This is the secret to the beauty of nature and the magnificence of a peaceful and harmonious society.

Very impressive and colorful architectural design. This is the first time I walked into the temple. It was a pleasure walking around the temple appreciating the beauty of the design, the sculptures and the music played."

Statues of just about all the important Hindu Deities can be found here. The ceiling has got very intricate and awesome paintings too.

Try to go there during the opening hours, about 7 in the morning where you can hear the Indian musical instruments too!"
,,Lovely small Hindu temple in Chinatown free to enter,4.0,,"This lovely little Hindu temple is in Chinatown and free to enter.

If you want to take photos, you must pay $3 to the gentleman sitting inside the door - $3 is not a lot to get priceless photos.

Please remember that this is a religious temple, so clothing must be appropriate and no she's are allowed in the temple.

Shorts / skirts / dresses must be long enough to cover the knees. They do have sarongs and shawls just inside the entry to cover yourself.

You don't need long in here, less than 30 minutes to admire the temple and murals."
,,Very enjoyable visit,4.0,,"We spent at least 1 hr in the evening wondering around the temple. The food was offered after the service and we enjoyed it with the other devotees. The temple has nice shrines dedicated to Hindu Gods: Shiva, Durga, Ganesha, Krishna, Rama… peaceful vibes, nice place to meditate if you will be able to find a quiet corner. Very friendly people there"
,,very interesting,5.0,,Small but rich temple. It is extremely interesting to see people from different culture observe theiri religion. You really fell into an Indinan environment. Very good
,,"Always worth a visit, especially for non South East Asians tourists",4.0,,"The Sri Mariammam Temple checks every box for a tourist attraction, except for lack of information about the many different deities inside.
It's very colorful facade with the myriad of statutes is immediately eye catching and interesting.
Inside the temple compound, it is just as vibrantly colorful, garlands of flowers hang from the ceilings and adorn resident deities in the various sectors. You can mingle freely with worshippers and witness priests performing puja' or prayers.
There are no literature about the deities or rites, except for some historical facts about the temple eg it's the oldest in Singapore etc
Female visitors in short attire were given a long sarong to put on before they entered."
,,Not much to see.,3.0,,Very nice colourful facade but not m CH else to see. The interior was quite plain. I think Hindu temples are more on the outside than in.
,,Multi religion Singapore show case,5.0,,"only in Singapore, can you find a church, mosque, Hindu & Chinese temples on the same street. good way to view & understand this unique culture of the 4 major races in Singapore. Admission is free too. just dress up i.e. no shorts, mini skirts, sleeveless."
,,Hundreds God Statues,4.0,,You will be shock with the number of statues here. I try to count it back then and the caretaker was laughing at me. A very cool place to take a lovely picture :)
,,A wedding made it a very special place to vist,5.0,,"Free entrance but please take off your shoes before you go in and look for the signs (they are often not very obvious) that asks tourists not to enter certain scared areas. Just be respectful. We were very lucky there was a wedding going on while we were at the Sri Mariamman Temple made it very colorful and we even got to see the public ceremony. Paradoxically sited in the middle of Chinatown, this kitsch site is Singapore’s oldest Hindu temple, so if your shopping in Chinatown you should visit Sri Mariamman Temple. The building is colorful and very uniquely Hindu, providing an excellent photo opportunity."
,,lovely,4.0,,"free entrance, small but lovely temple. close to china town MRT and on the way to the maxwell hawker eatery. since singapore is so hot and you have to cover up to enter the temple, bring a small cardigan to throw over your shoulders and just use the free long skirt they provide to cover your legs while there. you do have to pay $3 if you wish to take photos inside."
,,Amazing Temple,4.0,,"Located in central singapore, this place is easy to find. The building is so colorful and unique and good for taking photo"
,,Hindu Temple,3.0,,"These are usually pretty similar to each other. But if you are particularly interested in Hindu culture or have never seen one, it is something that shouldn't be missed. A intricately caved brightly colored piece of architecture. A must see if you are in Singapore, and no excuse not to if find yourself in Chinatown."
,,Ancient Tamil Nadu inside Singapore,5.0,,"What authority does one have to review a temple? or a church or a synagogue for that matter - I'll simply recount my experience.

Sri Mariamman Temple in China Town is a major tourist attraction, but to me it's more than that. It's a symbol of Singapore's tolerance to different cultural themes, which is also the reason the world is attracted to this small country. This temple is no exception. With its loud music, waft of incense in the air, there's a divine peace that's very evident in the environment. If one is fortunate enough to visit the temple during an Indian festival, it's a treat for the eyes and ears. The atmosphere is reminiscent of ancient temples in South India and takes one back to that part of the world rather quickly. Pick a spot in temple, sit down and close your eyes - the divinity, regardless of your faith, will guide you the rest of the way to experience what I did."
,,optional visit,5.0,,a must visit if you are in chinatown. its present in the outer parts of chinatown..very similar to temples in Tamilnadu
,,Sacred temple,5.0,,Was surprised to see a temple of this magnitude outside India. The architecture was very similar to the temples found in India. Place was maintained very well. All the rituals performed were very close to what is followed in India. Must visit place in Singapore.
,,Good to view from tour bus,3.0,,"We didn't go inside the temple, but viewed from the bus tour as we passed. This was enough for us as we were on a tight time constraint. It's good to see as this is part of the diverse and multiracial Singapore."
,,Incredibly colorful and interesting to look at,4.0,,I purchased the permit to take photos for 3 singapore dollars and I am certainly glad I did. This national monument filled my eyes with it's vibrant colors and carvings which covered many levels of the temple.. while the colors were vibrant like in most places I found it surreal. I think it's worth taking the time to discover what your senses tell you......
,,Nice in Chinatown,4.0,,"This temple is set in Chinatown and is stunning in appearance, close to all the markets and restaurants in the area and is visually appealing, if you are in the area it is well worth the visit."

,,Absolutely stunning,4.0,,"Very close the Chinatown MRT you mac not miss it.

The exterior is stunning and free to look around inside. If you want to take photos you will need to pay a small fee of around 3 SGD.

Also need to wear clothing that does not show your shoulders and bottoms below the knee. I am sure people an borrow items if need be"
,,Very Nice Temple,5.0,,Very nice temple. Very well managed. Just around 500 m from China town metro station. Also connected with the bus services.
,,"Who was it that said, ""Give me a child until the age of 7, and I'll get him to believe anything?""",4.0,,"I came around the corner, and there it was, in all its glory. It is fantastic! Who cares about the religion? but as a spectical it is absolutely GREAT! - and really good fun, and so colorful.
There are blue people, green people and some chap with an elephant trunk instead of a nose. When I was in India, my young lady tour guide told me the story of how this happened; ""And you believe this?"" I asked.
""Yes, of course,"" the 22 year old replied. I just shook my head! Then I noticed a cow wandering by making a mess in the middle of the road. ""There goes another God,"" I thought to myself.
Brian, from Perth, W.Australia"
,,A very nice Hindu temple in Chinatown,4.0,,"This is one of the oldest Hindu temples in Singapore. Interestingly, this temple is in between a mosque and Buddhist temple along the same stretch of road.

Entry is free but you have to fork out S$3 if you would like to take photographs. Footwear is not allowed in the temple and you need to cover up if you are not appropriately dressed, although shawls/wraps are available at no charge.

We were lucky when we visited this temple as there was a ceremony being performed. While lively, the ""music"" was expectedly loud which the very young may not appreciate.

In the temple, there are areas that tourists were out-of-bounds to tourists, although we do see that these signboards were largely ignored. Do take some time to admire the murals on the ceiling, as well as statutes around the temple. You should factor some time to visit this temple if you are around the Chinatown area."
,,Oldest Hindu Temple in Singapore,3.0,,"The Sri Mariamman Temple is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore (constructed 1827) and is devoted to the mother Goddess. The structure is easily located in China Town and the complex is ornate and has many intricate murals. It is still a place of worship so strict dress codes apply, some areas are roped off and shoes must be removed before entering the complex. Tourists should note that there is little signage onsite to give an insight into the temple or the Hindu religion. Unfortunately the staff in the box near the main entrance at the temple were not very friendly on my visit and I was unsure if they spoke English well. While there is no entry fee, there is a $3 fee per camera if you wish to take photos and donations are willingly accepted."
,,Beautiful Hindu Temple,4.0,,"The facade of this temple is breathtakingly beautiful. We visited while the had a ""service"" in progress. It was so interesting to see all the colorful idols, smell the different smells and hear and see the live musicians making music for the gods. Definitely worth a visit!"
,,Not worth my time,2.0,,"I noticed it as one of the ""must sees"" in the neihgbourhood and decided to visit the temple complex. Entry is free, they do ask for a small donation if you want to make pictures. The inside is pretty small and except for the nice sculptures you see in the photos there is not much else to see."
,,Fascinating Temple,4.0,,A busy temple in Chinatown with lots of devotee. It is full of paintings and statues inside. Don't forget to take off your footwear before entering this temple.
,,Fascinating,4.0,,"We visited the temple as tourists. It was very interesting. The temple was beautiful. It was full of people, statues and paintings. You can take photos for a small fee. You need to remove your shoes and should be dressed appropriately, but you can borrow a covering if you have to cover up."
,,Colorful Temple,4.0,,It isn't difficult to find this temple as it is located right inside Chinatown and can be spotted by the colorful tower of Hindu icons guarding the entrance to the temple. One can enter for free but must pay to take photos.
,,Oldest Hindu Temple in Singapore,4.0,,"Very near to China Town MRT Station, at the junction of temple street and south bridge road, this oldest Hindu temple is there. This agamic temple was opened in 1827. Besides worship, this temple at that time was known for Registry of Marriages for Hindus.

Now this temple is a national monument. It is dedicated to the goddess Mariamman, known for her power to cure illnesses and diseases. There are also many other small temples in the campus.

This temple is known for its big tower entrance. It is covered with sculptures. In October or November, fire walking ceremony is held here. Many courses like Yoga are done here. There is a marriage hall in the temple premises.

It opens daily from 7am – 12pm, and 6pm – 9pm. Photography is permitted for which you have to pay nominal charges. You should be decently dressed and should be bare foot to enter. Enjoy the south Indian music played in the temple at the time of 'Aarti""."
,,very colourful temple,3.0,,"i didn't go inside only looked from the outside, its a very colourful temple. the holly cows were interesting, it worth a look, i guess but i don't think that i would go back again unlike some of the other temples in Singapore."
,,Terrible for photographers,2.0,,"Must pay a fee to take pics and then you get many signs ""tourists are not allowed further this point"".
Only discoloured ornaments outside and dark ornaments inside. Smoky areas and bird protection net on all ceilings. So you basically can't take any nice pic.
Definitely a tourist trap and photographer get ripped off by this intolerant religion. There are so many nice and respectful temples in Singapore, don't waste your time with that rubbish as tourists are not welcome unless they pay."
,,Holy Cows,4.0,,"This is Singapore's oldest Hindu temple. It's on the edge of Chinatown and is hard to miss with its colourful, ornate carvings.

Long skirts and shawls are available at the door for women to borrow if their shoulders and legs are bare. There is a small fee for the privelage of taking photos or videos. It's worth it because there is much to photograph.

There are also sounds and smells.....incense, burning candles, gongs banging, voices chanting, horns blowing.

There are places for worshipers to break coconuts as an offering, to pray and to contemplate the intricate mountains of figures - deities and creatures reaching up to the heavens, some painted blue to give them a head start.

Wander around, light a candle, look upwards, downwards and all around so as not to miss anything. A half hour to an hour's worth of peace and quiet."
,,Chinatown in Singapore is one of the shopping heaven...,4.0,,"Singapore Chinatown is must for shopping.. Its like the cheapest place in whole Singapore I believe. So many Souvenirs to buy from. Singaporean, Indian and Chinese.. Amazing things at nice price (Must bargain though). The food in Chinatown Sea food restaurant is amazing as well."
,,Very ornate,4.0,,Very nice temple with very ornate entrance. Free to enter but note that there is a fee for taking photos and a higher fee for videos.
,,Must Pay When You Take Photos,3.0,,"This is unique temple, if you want to take some photos you'll have to pay.. but don't worry you get in the wrong temple, because there is a sign to pay in front of the temple.. it's nice temple actually, but with annoying sign.."
,,Typical South Indian temple,4.0,,"Colourful and frantic, it is typical of many South Indian temples. If you have not seen one before, definitely stop for a look as it is conveniently located in China Town along Pagoda Street where there are lots of markets and food opportunities around."
,,Very nice India temple,4.0,,"Very nice temple, a bit small, but very colorful, remember no footwear and if you wante to take pictures, you have to buy the 3S$ tag, that allows you to take pictures,Michael I did, time to spend 15-20 min, free admission"
,,Hindu temple...,4.0,,"The Sri Mariamman Temple is Singapore's oldest Hindu temple. It is an agamic temple, built in the Dravidian style. Located at 244 South Bridge Road, in the downtown Chinatown district, the temple serves the majority Hindu Singaporeans, Tamilians, in the city-state. Due to its architectural and historical significance, the temple has been gazetted a National Monument and is a major tourist attraction. Sri Mariamman Temple is managed by the Hindu Endowments Board, a statutory board under the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports."
,,insecure place,1.0,,"Im really disappointed. I thought architecture wud b something very spl.but it was very ordinary like a temple in my street in chennai.. after all, my mobile phone was looted there."
,,New culture,4.0,,"This temple is located at the end of Pagoda Street, the main thoroughfare of Singapore's Chinatown. The buildings are very ornately decorated and worth taking time to study. A wedding was getting underway as we arrived, so the complex was reasonably busy and we were denied access to one part. However this was more than compensated for by the bright colours of the wedding guests' clothing and the whole sense of atmosphere. Well worth a visit."
,,Very colourful temple,4.0,,Very impressed with the temple. We were lucky that the temple wasn't overly crowded.within the temple are shrines to various gods. All very impressive and some of the scenes are quite grotesque
,,Worth to visit when u r in Singapore,4.0,,"It's colourful and different. I love the dresses, but it can be really crowded. It's not a secret place but try it by ur self. Of u don't like it go on. A lot more to see in Singapore!"
,,Breathtaking in uniqueness,4.0,,An amazing temple such intricate design from all angles. It is on the edge of China Town so has the vibrant feel of China Town about it. After having just seen a beautiful ceremony in the Buddah temple only metres away it was quite intriguing.
,,One of the best,5.0,,"If you are visiting the place, my suggestion is to be there when they are doing ritual. If I'm not wrong ritual is done 3 times a day and it is worth to be part of it. There is no restriction and if you are there open your mind and place your prayer, you will be blessed."
,,Typical South Indian temple,3.0,,"A typical South Indian temple, like millions of them around the world. If you have never been to Hindu temples its worth a visit."
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"This place was such an oasis of calm on the edge of China town. Also a temple with worshippers, shoes left outside, legs best covered. Such a great pice of history. Free entry. Worth a visit and so close to China town."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,Great Statues and fairly friendly people who are happy to open their religion to tourists. The only thing to remember is to take off your shoes before entering.
,,pick pocket and chappel stand cheating,1.0,,"no doubt temple is too good , but how to visit this unsafe place ? beaware of pick pocket and chappel stand cheating also look for lots of beggers ."
,,Sri Mariamman Temple,4.0,,"It is a Hindu temple used by immigrants from Nagapatman and Cuddalore in South India. The temple is dedicated to the goddess of healing epidemic, Mariamman. Is close to the Buddha Tooth Relic Templee and has a beautiful façade.
We have to take off the shoes to enter."
,,Southern Indian temple,4.0,,I have visited a number of times over the years. Sarongs are available for those who have clothing that is too short. Worth a visit.
,,Wet and mucky floors,3.0,,"Only viewed from the outside as the floor inside looked decidedly wet and mucky, and as you had to remove your shoes and leave them outside we were not certain that we’d return to find our new trainers replaced by a pair of non-fitting flip flops! Besides which we were not certain how much we would see as there was a notice stating that tourists were not permitted beyond that point. Nonetheless the architecture above the main entrance is impressive, and worth a visit for that alone."
,,Interesting temple and courtyards,4.0,,"Beyond the ornament and distracting sculpture, the main building of the Sri Marianmman Temple is comprised of a progression of nicely proportioned spaces entered directly from the street. We enjoyed walking through the surrounding courtyards with unique shapes created by artfully positioning the temple at an angle on its rectangular site."
,,Nice to see,3.0,,It is a very colorful place. Not much to do but look at the statues. But it is a beautiful place and a nice way to waste some time.
,,Easily accessible,3.0,,Interestingly this Hindu temple is located in Chinatown at the end of Pagoda street. It's not really that exciting inside (especially if you're familiar with temples in India proper) but it's still worth a visit to get a taste of Hinduism in Singapore. Easily accessible from Chinatown mrt.
,,"Great ""over-the-top"" temple",3.0,,"This temple has an awesome design which is ""over-the-top"", but still awesome. Mandatory visit! I did not see the inside because it was closed to public that day."
,,Beautiful hindu temple,4.0,,Located in pagoda street in chinatown. Beautiful temple with lots of colorful ornaments and lovely interiors. Footwear are not permitted inside. You also have to pay S$3 to take pictures. Entrance to the temple is free
,,Average,3.0,,"Maybe it wasn't the right moment for us or maybe it just wasn't the right time to visit the temple (late morning), but we were expecting something more. We payed the donation for taking photos. We were disappointed we couldn't access all the places as tourists (since we didn't really see an apparent reason for it). We preferred the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple in Little India. As tourists we felt more welcome there."
,,Religious Place,3.0,,"too bad, I wore short pants so I couldn't enter the building. Had a sudden plan to visit this place.

I recommend to bring scraf if you wear short pants. The entrance fee is free, but if you are willing to take picture inside the building, it costs $3 to capture by your camera for the donation.
This is near Chinatown MRT. Easy to find."
,,Singapore's oldest Hindu Temple,4.0,,"An enjoyable visit, very easy to find and only a short walk from the MRT (train station). It won't take too long to have a wander round, but is worth it. It's colourful and interesting and while we were there, a handful of ladies were worshipping and making offerings after a ceremony which we were able to watch. It's worth paying the $3 to be able to take photo's too."
,,Singapore's oldest Hindu Temple delivers a memorable experience.,4.0,,"This was my second visit to this temple, my first being about 6 years ago, and it was just as impressive second time around as it was the first. The Temples amazing ""gopuram"", (entrance tower), located on South Bridge Road is richly embellished with six tiers of sculptures of Hindu deities, other figures and ornamental decorations... Very impressive indeed.

You remove your shoes to enter and leave them on the racks on the pavement outside the entrance. Entrance if Free but if you wish to take photographs you have to buy a Camera Permit (a pink slip with a picture of a camera on it) from the guy on the door for Sg$3.00 (about GB£1.50) the temple is VERY photogenic so I recommend paying this small fee and taking many pictures!!

The temple was founded in 1823 when the land was granted to a government clerk (Narayana Pillay) and 4 years later there was a simple temple standing on the spot made from wood and attap. A more substantial brick temple was constructed in 1843 with the bulk of the construction taking place around 1862, with the impressive entrance tower as it is today being added in 1925.

The temple is colourful, aromatic, atmospheric and culturally fascinating... Allow time to soak up the experience and take in the numerous shrines and deities. The focus of the main prayer hall is the central shrine of Mariamman, (hence the temples name), which is flanked by the shrines of two secondary deities, Rama and Murugan. The main prayer hall is surrounded by a series of free-standing shrines, housed in pavilion-like structures with decorated dome roofs, known as Vimana.

I highly recommend a visit to this superb temple, and the whole 'Chinatown' area where it is located, for a very memorable cultural experience... If in Singapore again I will be sure to visit for a third time! Also well worth a visit is the Hindu ""Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple"" located on Serangoon Road in Singapore's 'Little India' district."
,,Beautiful and Authentic,5.0,,"This is the real deal - take your shoes off outside the entrance and everything.

We happened to stroll up to the temple on a morning during the fire walking festival - tons of people worshiping, chanting, giving offerings, it was a beautiful thing to witness. A kind man in line with us (while we waited to pay our camera fee of $2) begin telling us what was going on, giving us some hindu history, and really helped us understand the sacred parts and practices of the temple. The dieties are intricate and awesome, the colors are so vibrant, the smells are intense and pungent, it felt very spiritual and like we had stepped into another world."
,,So Ornate such lovely craftsmanship,4.0,,"Just a short walk from China town and is on the Hop on Bus route this lovely Hindu Temple can be found.
The temple is simply beautiful when you look at all the lovely craftsmanship that went into making all the figures.
Colours are very bright. I thought it was nicer on the outside than inside probably because outside is such a statement
Don't forget to take your shoes off."
,,Old Temple,4.0,,Another picturesque Indian temple with very colorful statues and decorations on the roof. There's really not a ton to see inside that can't be seen outside. You also have to remove your shoes and the floor is quite unhengenic looking. Mostly worth just a walk by.
,,Beautyful south indian Hindu temple in Singapore,4.0,,"During my trip to Singapore alongwith my family last month,we went to chinatown for a visit.As per our tourguide's advise we went to see the Mariamma temple.Its beautyful temple,very much colourful n well maintained.Typical south indian style Hindu temple.From there,we came to know that,its the oldest n biggest Hindu temple in Singapore.When we reach there,the Arati was going on.So we joined.Really nice.If u r at Singapore,then u must pay a visit to this holy temple"
,,"Beautiful temple, peaceful place",5.0,,"This is a beautiful South Indian temple, a wonderful place to sit for a few minutes and relax or meditate if you arrive when it isn't crowded. When i was there the deities were covered but i was able to admire the beautiful paintings adorning the walls. If you do not take photos entrance is free (donations are of course welcome) and unlike a lot of temples in India and Nepal, everyone is welcome."
,,Ornate,5.0,,"Oldest Hindu temple in Singapore, close to China town and in operation. Impressive customs and details."
,,Very colourful,4.0,,What a beautiflly ornate little temple right amonst the busy stalls and markets in Chinatown and it is a functioing place so on aweekend expect to see a wedding or ceremony.
,,"Amazing, Beautiful and Peaceful",4.0,,"This Hindu temple is absolutely gorgeous. Keep in mind it is a functioning temple. Be aware you do remove shoes and socks before entering but the temple is clean and well maintained. The colors, sculptures, idols and prayer areas are peaceful, well maintained and provide a wonderful insight to the religion and culture. There is no fee to visit but a donation is requested to take photography inside."
,,"Really pretty, unique temple",4.0,,A very pretty temple in the middle of Chinatown. Different to any temple I have seen before. Very colourful. Free admission.
,,Beautiful temple a must see,4.0,,It's a beautiful temple with details of the Hindu architecture and gives you a feeling of university in diversity in Singapore which is a multi cultural country.
,,Great architecture,5.0,,"For someone who may not have any understanding of Hinduism or its history idols inside this temple might not seem interesting, however if you have a look at outside its well decorated with colourful figurines and idols.

Inside, you can take your own time and visit the temple. I would say its great to have this temple in the middle of Chinatown next to North Bridge Road and close to eating areas as well. You will be required to remove your foot wear as is the case with all Hindu temples around the world. This is out of respect for deities inside the temple. Enjoy and I would say go with an open mind and I am sure you will enjoy it."
,,"Temple, monument and a powerful deity",5.0,,"One of the oldest in Singapore ( built as early as 1827), built in typical South Indian Dravidian style by sculptors from Nagapatnam of Tamilnadu in South India , this temple has a great history in Singapore.
Originally the place of refuge for Indian Hindu immigrants, it obtained importance that the temple was the registry of marriages for Hindus. At that time, only the priest of the Sri Mariamman Temple was authorised to solemnise Hindu marriages in Singapore. Today, in addition to its religious services and functions, the temple promotes various social, cultural and educational activities.

While all tourists are allowed inside the temple to enjoy the beauty and sculptors, only Hindus are allowed inside the sacred areas,the pooja activities are still done by people from Tamilnadu in typical Tamilnadu style. The front six tiered Gopuram ( entrance tower) is a beauty by itself and very attractive with colorful sculptures and attractions.

The temple is full of typical village deities worshiped by typical villagers in Tamilnadu ( called Grama devathaigal) pooja and rituals are regularly conducted. Visiting the temple after 30 years, I noticed the typical Singapore tourist friendly atmosphere of cleanliness and friendliness

The best to watch is the annual Theemithi ( Fire walk ) festival used to be in end Sep/Oct ( Tamil month Purattasi) participated by thousands of devotees who follow strict preparations ( viradham ) and walk on fire, witnessed by thousands of visitors and tourists. Amazing to watch and admire, you definitely will be over awed by the sheer devotion of people towards Goddess Mariamman to walk on fire.

Situated in heart of china town at a very prominent location in Singapore no one can miss the temple. Both streets running by the side of Mariamman temple are famous for small, medium and large souvenirs of various types.You will find right from 5 pieces for 2 Singapore dollars, to the most expensive souvenirs and give away in these streets.

You also get variety of food and drinks in a crowded atmosphere but typical to Singapores concern for cleanliness they are clean and safe too.

China town MRT is very close so also Budha tooth relic temple. Dont miss the Layan Sidhi Vinayagar temple about a Km away walkable from Sri Mariamman temple."
,,Great for pictures,4.0,,"This temple is conveniently locate near Chinatown which makes it very popular with tourists. We were allowed inside for a look but it wasn't overly interesting, great photos from the front of the temple. There is a charge to take photos inside."
,,Take a finer look at all the figurines,4.0,,Well worth a visit.. Was full. yet never felt threatened or unsafe.as is the norm in Singapore.Better than India or elsewhere. Instructive. Check it out once. Interesting.
,,interesting,4.0,,"It's a picturesque Hindu temple just past Pagoda St., I think. I passed by on a Sunday with many people doing their service so I didn't take photos."
,,"Nice, but one of several",3.0,,"This is one of several temples of similar design here in Singapore. This one is conveniently located in Chinatown, right down the road from the Buddha Tooth Museum. However, they make you pay if you want to take photos inside, I believe it's $3 for pictures, $6 for video. I wasn't very impressed by the inside - it's not that it isn't neat, but again, similar to others. If you are strapped for time, I'd go, since chances are Chinatown is already on your itinerary. Otherwise, I'd consider some of the other Hindu temples. And you have to take your shoes off outside all of them, so I would recommend wearing socks."
,,Dont miss it.,5.0,,its a south indian style Hindu temple constructed almost 180 years ago and lot of indian devotees visit this temple every day. Its considered as one of the major tourist attractions of Singapore.
,,Much bigger than it appears from the street. Worth a visit.,4.0,,"In the middle of Chinatown, this temple is much bigger than appears from the street. We looked in only briefly since we were on a bike tour, but we amazed at how well-kept and new the brightly colored statues appeared."
,,Excellent experience,5.0,,We went on a Sunday and had the chance to see a wedding ceremony. The attendees were very kind and everyone would not mind the tourists at all. You need to take your shoes off at the entry. There is a huge shoe rack at the entry.
,,A place to see.,4.0,,Very nice temple. A place to see definitely! It costs you 3SD to bring your camera and you have to take off your shoes as usual.
,,So different from other religious temples,5.0,,I much preferred this to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. I know very little about the Hindu faith but was struck by the inclusion of animal sculptures suggesting a closer relationship to nature than other religions. The photo permit for $3 is well worth it.
,,You won't forget it,4.0,,This is probably the most brightly coloured temple I have ever seen and I have seen a lot. It isn't huge but it is ornate. Worth a visit if you are in Chinatown. There is no entry fee but they do ask a donation for taking photos.
,,A Hidden Treasure,5.0,,"What a gem of a temple, so colourful and amazing. I was walking through Chinatown and come across this temple by surprise. The historic quality of this temple is unbelievable. This is really worth a visit but remember you have to take your shoes before entering as it is a holy place."
,,Hidden Gem in Chinatown,5.0,,"This is actually the first Hindu temple I'd ever been to, and what a treasure! It's around the corner from Chinatown and really just a gem in the middle of the city. You take your shoes off at the entrance (don't worry, nobody steals them) and venture in. I did not take pictures inside but you can for a fee, I believe. The temple is bigger than it seems on the outside, and is full of colorful sculptures and niches, with people praying, lighting incense, chanting. It's much more full of life & action than any church/mosque/synagogue I've been in (nothing against those at all, but you're expected to be quiet). It's just very vibrant and full of life, much like Hinduism itself, and feels worlds away from the churches of America. Everyone was friendly and respectful, so please do the same. I really enjoyed my time there. Definitely worth a visit!"
,,A vibrant Hindu Temple,4.0,,"but the big corporate buildings ruin the skylines/skyscapes. However, it is a must visit temple (towards the end of Chinatown). It is not that big - but it is simply gorgeous - intricate craftsmanship of the statues and the architecture - the colors are just site for sore eyes! Be prepared to pay to take photos - SGD$3 for camera (I think it is SGD$6 for videos)! Shoes must be left outside the gate of the temple so if you do not like being bare feet, wear socks which I highly recommend."
,,Indian treasure in the heart of Chinatown,5.0,,Sri Mariamman temple is one of the first Hindu temple of Singapore. It acted as a temporary accommodation and gathering point for the initial immigrant labors from India (especially from Tamil Nadu). It’s listed as a national monument and one of the most beautiful temples in Singapore. The Firewalking ceremony is one of the key events in the temple.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"This place is located just of racecourse road in little India.. The colours inside are simply stunning, the detail is magnificent.. Well worth a visit"
,,Ancient,4.0,,"We asked to be dropped off at this end of Chinatown so we could shop and see the temple. It is crammed into a busy area of Singapore but it is an amazing building, very similar to the one in Kuala Lumpurs Chinatown. The entry tower is highly decorated in rich colors typical of Hindu structures. Entry is free entry but you have to pay $3 to take photos. Be respectful and take your shoes off but I would recommend leaving socks on as the concrete gets really hot."
,,Tucked away in Chinatown but is beautiful,5.0,,Like many others we were roaming through Chinatown and stumbled across this temple. Free entry and you have to pay $3 to take as many photos as you like. It is simply beautiful! You have to take your shoes off but I would recommend leaving socks on as the concrete gets really hot in the midday sun. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Amazing architecture,4.0,,"We were dropped by this temple from the purple hippo line bus. The entry tower is incredible. Covered with images of gods etc. There are also sacred cows all around the walls. Inside are more fantastic sculptures - they look somewhat like Disney land but are obviously done with care and love, rather than entirely with the aim of making money. Whilst we were there a ritual involving drums, an indian cor anglais/oboe, and much waving of fire in front of sacred statues took place. Fascinating, but confusing..."
,,Such a surprise in China Town.,5.0,,"As you walk through the bright, joyous streets of China Town, you turn a corner and suddenly come across this most beautiful Hindu Temple. So, do not be taken by surprise and make sure that you have taken note of which street to go down in advance. It is well worth a visit. It's beautifully crafted statues have to be seen to be believed. Such colour, such life and vitality ! Temples as amazing as this are rare outside of India. Please remember that this is a place of worship so, treat the Temple and the people using it with respect. You should remove your shoes before entering but they shall be perfectly safe we're you leave them, the problem is finding almost the mass of shoes ! There are also some very good restaurants in the vicinity but of course if you love authentic Indian food, as I do then you must visit Little India."
,,Beautiful in pictures..,2.0,,"In reality in not so beautiful. And I felt there unwelcome. Maybe with a professional guidance, if i would have had somebody to explain me about temple, ceremonies and meanings, i could say it was a great experience. But it was not."
,,Must to see in Singapore,5.0,,This temple is located in Little India. It is Must-to-see attraction in Singapore. I was there during the service and all place was vibrating. Building is very well preserved.
,,Finally visited after many trips to Singapore,4.0,,"Very colourful, restoration work was being carried out inside when we went. Had been past many times but this time we went inside, extremely beautiful and right at the edge of Chinatown. Shoes must be left outside - we had no problem with this."
,,beautiful and colourfull temple,4.0,,"Sri Mariamman temple situated at south bridge road singapore, a must visit for tourists who like photo- shooting. There are many beautiful India-temples in singapore Sri Mariamman stands out to be the most colourfull temple in the CBD district of singapore with lots of statues adoring its building structures. The beautiful art works were done by skill-professional artists from India and it took them many years to complete its present glory.
The temple is within the tourist area of chinatown. After visiting the scenic chinatown, dont forget to take a short walk to the India temple.
Getting there is easy, there are two MRT stations nearby and plenty of public transports"
,,Eye-catching colour,4.0,,"A quick stop at this temple was part of a tour provided by our hotel and, sadly, there wasn't enough time to go inside. Judging by the photo's on Tripadvisor from other visitors I think I would have enjoyed the inside even more than the outside ....... the whole place is a riot of colour!
But it goes without saying that it would be extremely difficult to ignore this place!"
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,Loved the cows on the roof. The kids loved them. Take lots of photos and walk around to see china town
,,Colorfull temple,5.0,,"This temple is very beautiful with its colors. Many people came here to pray and I came here when the temple were crowded, but tourist are still welcome to enter the temple. Surrounding the temple there are many shop selling flower, incense for pray & sarry (traditional India cloth). I really like watching their activity inside the temple and the surrounding area."
,,Grubby and unwelcoming,3.0,,"I found the temple to be in a grubby area and didn't feel welcome to go inside, shoes everywhere on the footpath outside and the surrounding Indian market area had pushy sales people which made it hard to browse, I made sure to give it a wide berth when walking from China town to Singapore CBD."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Gorgeous colorful temple. So many beautiful statues, really calm and peaceful feeling. Completely blown away by this temple."
,,Colors and culture!,5.0,,"Wow!
The colors, the flowers, the paintings, the statues, the incense, the ritual....Wow!
Beautiful temple! It is so bright in the middle of the grey city, it create so much contrast! I loved it! If you want to take pictures you need to pay a small fee but is totally worthy! I stayed there a while exploring every corner, so a guy started to show me the main different gods and I was very happy about that!"
,,Excellent,4.0,,"Excellent temple
If one is a Singaporean then one would visit it more often from a religious point of view.
Being a tourist I admired the sanctity of the place, felt great vibrations and was able to get a sense of relaxation. All this points to the fact that the temple is well managed and maintained and all the religious rituals are followed without any compromise.
The temple priests were very friendly and took time off to explain how this temple came into being in Singapore.
For a tourist, if its possible to slot in 3 hrs in the evening for visiting this temple there is nothing like it.
Accessibility is very easy as the temple is just 200 steps away from the China Town MRT."
,,Nice Temple and interesting,4.0,,This is a great little place. Somewhere you can learn a bit about the religion. take you r camera and happy snapping
,,Nice little temple,3.0,,Nice photo opportunity from the outside. But if you would like to take more photos inside you need to pay a donation in order to do so. You are required to remove your shoes before going inside. Walking distance from China town.
,,Can't Miss It.,4.0,,"If one takes the MRT to Chinatown and heads towards the Market, the Temple will be at the end of the street. Over recent years the place has been given a cut and polish and now is back to showing off vibrant colours as one would expect from a Hindu place of worship. One has to remove shoes before entering but racks are provided for those who understand English. Apparently many do not !! You do not have to enter as most of it can be easily seen from outside. The Buddha Tooth Temple is only a short distance away and is a must enter and see particularly on the upper levels."
,,Short walk,3.0,,"The temple is within walking distance from the Buddha's Tooth Temple and in China Town. No shoes allowed, there is no worry of theft when you leave them outside. There is a $3 charge for cameras.

It was nice enough, the painted sculptures are cool and the music a bit crazy, but it is definitely a taste of India in the middle of Singapore. Tourists are requested to remain at the back of the temple, just so you know."
,,Educational,3.0,,"This temple gives a good insight into Indian culture in Singapore. It is a South Indian temple that enshrines the goddess Mariamman, an incarnation of Parvati/Durga. It is a popular temple t the mother goddess and you can learn a lot from a visit.

If you expect it to be on par with temples in India, then you are going to be disappointed, but if you treat it as it is, you will find it rewarding."
,,Underwhelmed,3.0,,"Yes, it is a photo opportunity from the outside. You have to take your shoes off and leave them outside on the street as it is part of their tradition but unfortunately for me I was then in bare feet, bruised the bottom of one foot on a stone and got very dirty, making the visit uncomfortable. We were with a private guide who gave us a lot of information about the various statues and the religion."
,,A beautiful Hindu temple built in traditional Dravidian style,4.0,,"Well worth a visit for it's colourful architecture and quiet courtyards. It's right on the doorstep of Chinatown and given tourists can enter for free (there is a small fee for still and video photography) it's a fascinating opportunity to be allowed to see inside a Hindu temple, provided you bear in mind it's an active place of worship and treat the establishment with respect."
,,Worth the Trip to Chinatown,4.0,,"This Hindu Temple is a must see in Chinatown. The rich colors and artistic flare of it are a photographers dream, but if you take photos you do have to pay. And if you take video you have to pay even more. The charge was minimal and the photos I took were worth the money.

It is an active temple and you must be respectful when viewing it. Removing shoes and staying out of the prayer areas and keeping noise to a minimum are a must. But definitely take the time to go. You won't be disappointed."
,,Major Landmark in Chinatown,3.0,,"The Sri Mariamman Temple is the oldest Hindu Temple in Singapore. From the Chinatown MRT Station, walk down Pagoda Road until South Bridge Road and you will find this temple at the corner on your right. The entrance tower and rooftop are adorned with beautiful statues in striking colors. You can combine this with a visit to Chinatown Heritage Centre (also along Pagoda Road), Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum, and Maxwell Food Centre."
,,An intersting temple.,5.0,,"I have never been to India, so I had never seen a Hindu temple. So it was very impressive, even though it is not a very big temple, I recommend you take a short peak to this multi colored, multi statue, temple. Please keep in mind that this is a religious place, not a tourist attraction, and they are willing to share this side of their culture with non hindus."
,,Well Worth The Trip,4.0,,An insight into another's faith - well worth the time and effort - came away feeling some karma and a lot calmer.
,,Unique and fun experience!,5.0,,"We have thoroughly enjoyed our visits to the temple. It's beautiful and fun to admire all of the details that go into its architecture.

You can easily take pictures (outside only), slip off your shoes and walk inside, and no one will say anything. You can take pictures inside too, if you pay a small fee.

It's worth a visit!"
,,Slightly disappointing,3.0,,"We were slightly underwhelmed by this Temple when we visited it. There was a bit of renovation working going on and it perhaps wasn't in the best condition internally with scaffolding evident. That said, the external structure is very impressive and colourful."
,,Nice temple,4.0,,"Very nice Hindu Temple, although nothing too special.

Kept in good condition and many deities to worship on site.

Usually surprisingly uncrowded during daytime hours, but can be very busy at times with both locals and tourists.

All in all worth a visit when in the area, although I would not make it a detour for tourist purposes.

I find the one on Clemenceau Ave much nicer to be honest and much more genuinely populated by the locals."
,,Hindu Temple,3.0,,"It is really close to MRT Chinatown station. Before entering the building, there is a sign post that you should remove your shoes/slippers/sandals before entering. Don't worry, no one will steal your footwear, as it is a sacred place. Photography is not allowed in the place, unless you pay the fee.

I was able to catch the afternoon ritual where they do some prayers for their temple gods. There were gongs and drums along with the ritual."
,,Convienant Hindu Temple In Chinatown,3.0,,After several other Buddist temples in Chinatown we decided to visit Sri Mariamman. There's a charge for photography (unlike any other temple we encountered on our visit) and a lot of areas are no go unless you are a worshipper. We took some photos of the amazing temple gods.
,,Riot of Colour,4.0,,"Less than 5 minutes walk from MRT Chinatown station. This is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore. It's colourful Gopuram or entrance tower, rises high over the surrounding buildings in Chinatown. Make sure you pass by at night when it is lit up like a huge Christmas tree with hundreds of flashing lights. Once you get inside it is rather plain in comparison. It is free to enter but you need to pay for cameras $3 still & $6 video. You also need to remove your shoes and put them in lockers provided.
There is a high wall running around the temple which you can walk up. Check out the nicely carved ceiling and a small Banyan tree at the rear."
,,A nice enough temple,3.0,,"Singapores religious tolerance has seen it spawn everything from mosques to Hindu temples and churches. It is, like Singapore, a lovely mix.

This temple is a nice place to meander through and a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of the streets outside. It is nice and quiet with a range of Hindu sculpture with all the colours of the rainbow and a few additional invented ones!

While I won't claim this is a stupendous experience it is a nice hiatus from the heat and walking about and it is a nice way of checking out the Indian influences on Singapore."
,,Traditional and old Hindu temple,5.0,,"This is my second visit to this place with in a year. This temple is under renovation. If you in this area it is a must visit there you can see how these people maintain their traditions for hundreds of years, I really love the atmosphere it is more holy and makes you calm. The temple is not opened all the time so please check before you go there."
,,Very colorful Hindu temple - Singapore's oldest,4.0,,Located in the heart of Chinatown Sri Mariamman Temple is Singapore's oldest Hindu temple. It's so colorful!
,,Original attraction,5.0,,"Heavy rain prevented me from attending to an open roof hop on-hop off sightseeing bus ride. Instead I took the metro to Chinatown and navigated from the Chinatown MRT station to South Bridge Road and Sri Mariamman Temple. It’s Singapore’s oldest Hindu temple and as such it was a totally new experience to me. Shoes are expected to be left outside the temple on the sidewalk (there are some racks). You cannot miss the beautiful entrance tower. There is no admission fee but there is a SGD 3.00 fee to be allowed to use your camera in the temple premises. I don’t know anything about Hindu ceremonies but I was lucky to be in the temple during one with priests, participants, music and religious rituals. You could definitely spend your time worse than spend 1 - 2 hours in this original attraction."
,,"Colourful Tamil , Hindu temple",5.0,,"Beautiful Hindu Temple in Chinatown , next to Buddhist Temple. The temple is very busy and has quite a number of visitors both locals and tourists."
,,Interesting Hindu temple,4.0,,"This is an interesting Hindu temple situated in the heart of Chinatown. There are no signs to explain anything, but you can watch the worshippers and take photos without bothering them. You must remove your shoes upon entering. Other travelers had to pay $3 for a photo permit, but no one ever asked me to purchase a permit and I took photos to my heart's content. It is worth a visit."
,,Beautiful Hindu Temple,5.0,,Not a huge temple but very colourful and well maintained. Also it seems to be used by the local community giving it an authentic air. Close to Chinatown MRT station and lots of cafes and restaurants.
,,nice temple,4.0,,"situated in china town, lies this beautiful temple. entry is free, only the photo permit costs about 3$. There was and ritual going on when I have been there, what made the experience even better."
,,"Very Bright, Good for the Photos",4.0,,"An interesting visit with nice bright statues and art. Bit meaningless with nothing around to explain what meanings these things have to the worshippers and how they are used.
If you are in the area it's worth a visit as it's free, though $3 to use your camera. I took lots of photos to get my money's worth."
,,A beautiful temple in the middle of the madness,5.0,,A beautiful must see temple in the madness of Chinatown. It's free to go in so there's not reason not too and explore it. If you want to take photos inside you have to a minimal fee but it's worth it.
,,Hindu Temple in the Middle of Chinatown,4.0,,"Sri Mariamman Temple is situated near the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. It's an interesting temple with a very colorful facade. We didn't bother going inside as we're pressed for time during our trip, but the view from the outside was amazing. It's definitely photo-worthy. If we had time, we would have probably paid the fee and would have taken photos inside, but the view from the street wasn't bad at all."
,,Beautiful - but a tad uncomfortable for kids,4.0,,"This is a nice stop along with the Chinatown afternoon. Of course, the temple is stunning in its artwork which is beautifully preserved and/or restored. I'm not expert on this stuff - but all I can say is wow. But as a tourist, it was a bit uncomfortable. I don't mind taking my shoes off, but wow, on a hot day like today - the concrete was a scorcher on your feet. And, a number of the areas were under construction. Then, a guy was building a drum, so naturally, I take my daughter over to take a look - and he's rather not be bothered. then why build a drum in a historic temple open to the public!? Ok, I'm a whiner on this one, I know, forgive me, but with a little more attention to satisfying visitors, this place would be such a better experience rather than a one-off must do stop when you're in the neighbourhood."
,,Colourful temple,5.0,,"We found this temple by accident, when we were strolling some little alley in China Town. Beautiful, colourful temple and at time was full of people. You have to pay if you wanna take photos and leave your shoes outside. There are lots of temples in S'pore, but this is definitely one of the best."
,,Very nice.,4.0,,"Just like many of the attractions that I visited, I found this one to also be free of crowds, I was able to take photos for a small fee and I was satisfied with that, as I am able to reflect on visiting this beautiful temple, as not many temples allow any photography, I recommend one to visit attraction for photo taking and time out from congested city."
,,"Beautiful Facade, Rooftop Statues and Ceiling drawings",4.0,,"This is the oldest and most beautiful Hindu temple in Singapore. The place is well kept, however the visitor is not allowed to wear shoes into the temple, you have to leave your shoes on the racks outside the entrance. The floor is hot during the day, so wear thick socks. Bring along a bigger bag and keep your shoes in your bag, if you are afraid your shoes might be stolen. Entrance fee is free. If you use your camera pay S$3, use your video camera, pay S$6. There is one grumpy old temple keeper that will go around telling people to pay before taking pictures. The ceiling is beautifully painted, and the roof is decorated with cement statues of the gods. The place is small, and many areas are out of bounds to non-devotees. I spent less than half hour here. Worth visiting, if you have more time in Singapore."
,,Indian temple,4.0,,Include this visit to an Indian temple as part of your time in Chinatown. Be prepared to leave your shoes outside in the racks on the street. There are many small temples within the temple but all are overshadowed by the magnificent brightly colored moulded Hindu deities on the temple roof. Would have been better if there had been more explanation of what we were seeeing
,,peaceful and colorful,4.0,,next to the hotel.good to visit and sometime with prayers you can sense the emotion of culture. i like the visit because is good for picture taking.we do not have sometime like that in Taiwan
,,Seems incongruous to find this temple in Chinatown,4.0,,We were in Chinatown and happened upon this temple and it struck me as being incongruous for the locale but then I remembered this is Singapore! Ethic diversity borne out of a long history. Bring your camera as there are some very cool colours and intricate deities.
,,Very Interesting to see a foreign religion,5.0,,The temple is very nice to look at if you like colorful figures. Luckily we were able to witness a service there. It's free and looks nice so go there.
,,An interesting short visit,3.0,,This was an interesting break from Chinese sights. We had to take our shoes off to go in and left early dur to rain. We didn't take photos since we had to pay S$3/S$6 per camera.
,,Interesting and worth a short wander,3.0,,"We came across this temple whilst wandering through Chinatown. strange place for a hindu temple? The statues and icons are colourful and detailed. It was an interesting experience, taking off my shoes and walking barefoot through the quiet temple, very relaxing after a day of sightseeing.

I beleive there is a small fee to use your camera in the temple, which is understandable, but otherwise it is free to enter (or it was on the day i visited)"
,,Quick stop,4.0,,"You can cover everything in less than 30 minutes. We stopped in during a religious ceremony and walked around briefly to appreciate the architecture. You need to pay to take photos, but otherwise it's free to walk in."
,,Worth wandering through for the colorful sculptures alone,4.0,,"Let's set some expectations right away: unless you're familiar with Hinduism, you're probably not going to learn a lot from a visit to this temple. It is an active religious site -- the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore -- and I would characterize the attitude toward tourists as being accepting but not outright welcoming (in contrast to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum a couple blocks away). There are no explanatory signs. There are parts of the temple that are off-limits. You have to leave your shoes on the racks outside and there is a $3 fee if you want to take photos.

That said, you WILL see brilliantly painted ceilings, an eye-popping tower of deities above the entrance, and large cow sculptures dangling their legs off the roof. You will gaze -- bewildered, mesmerized -- at Aravan's shrine if, like me, you come at night and the lights are changing color all over his fanged mustachioed visage.

In short, this temple is worth a visit if you're in Chinatown. (And you *should* visit Chinatown.) Sri Mariamman is located (not coincidentally!) between Temple and Pagoda Streets on South Bridge Rd. A block to the northeast, on Mosque (!) St. is the historic Jamae Mosque, probably worth just a quick view from the outside. A couple blocks southwest is the much more engrossing Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum. And then you're down the block from the Maxwell Road Hawker's Centre with its diverse local food choices. Make a spiritual / gastronomic afternoon out of the neighborhood."
,,A living temple,5.0,,"Leave your shoes outside, pay the 3 dollar camera fee and enter a living temple with great music and very photogenic surrondings."
,,Singapore’s Oldest Hindu Temple,3.0,,"Located in Chinatown, the Sri Mariamman Temple, Singapore's oldest Hindu Temple that dates back to 1827 was constructed by immigrants from the Nagapatnam and Cuddalore districts of South India. The entry is free. Photography by camera attracts some fees. The temple is dedicated to Goddess Mariamman, known for her power to cure epidemic illnesses and diseases. The Temple has a big gate called Gopuram (gate tower), which has many sculptures of Hindu gods and goddesses along with mythological characters. Like all Hindu Temples they too have Pooja & Aaarti timings during the day."
,,It's ok,3.0,,"As strolling through Chinatown we came across this temple, so we decided to have alook no charge to enter , but if you have a camera you want to take photos they do charge, I sent hubby in to check it out as I didnt want to take shoes off, outside was very nice with all its colours, but hubby walked around inside he reckons there was nothing inside to see just a few statues, so really if you want to have alook at it it's better to seeing it from outside but I wouldn't make a day thing about it."
,,Worth a quick visit,4.0,,"This temple is in Chinatown so is easy to get to - there is no charge to enter (unless you want to use camera); we took off our shoes and carried them in our bags as the entrance was a bit chaotic. We didn't spend a long time here, but enjoyed our time at the temple."
,,"Not the most impressive Hindu Temple (But Its a place of worship after all, not a showpiece)",3.0,,"I struggle to comprehend why this temple is so high on the tourist radar, unless its simply the fact it's positioned in a convenient place for tourists to pop into while in Chinatown, and its old.

The temple looks quite impressive from the outside - the usual triangular stack of Hindu Gods which is always quite photogenic. Decided to go inside (One quite rightly has to remove ones footwear when entering - but cannot leave the shoes at the entrance - there is a shelf arrangement some 10 ft away out of sight - which was in some disarray with random single flip flops all over the place - my young lady decided against going in and elected to stay and watch my shoes as she wasn't happy with leaving all our shoes here - probably paranoia !). Its a 3 Dollar charge for use of Camera but free entry.

Now i always feel bad being critical of a place of worship - but that just what this is - as a place of worship i would imagine it's a fantastic temple for the community. Taken as a tourist attraction its not that great - few of the colorful images one associates with a Hindu shrine - large parts were off limits and there is nothing to explain whats what to non devotees. As i say the place doesn't have to do these things as its a religious site and not a museum, but as a tourist I felt I was intruding into someones privacy as there is nothing to draw one into the processes or items which are inside the temple.
It's OK - its interesting to a degree - but if time is limited I would consider giving it a miss......."
,,Left feeling underwhelmed.,3.0,,"The whole experience of visiting this temple felt a little flat. While many other places of worship take the opportunity to educate visitors in the tenets and culture of the faith, the entranceway of this temple is unwelcoming and unkept, there is no sense of informing non-Hindus of the beliefs or history of the religion, and signs request non-devotees to keep back from the icons. The various effigies are well sculpted, if a little odd-looking - many look live they've been taking something illicit! $3 fee to use your camera. Worth a quick look around if you happen to be in Chinatown but overall, slightly disappointing and not worth seeking out in its own right."
,,Beautiful to look at - delightful to photograph!,5.0,,"I enjoyed visiting this temple - the oldest and most important Hindu Temple in Singapore. Yes, you have to leave your shoes at the door (not a problem) / yes, you pay a minimal amount to take photo's - but otherwise entry is Free. Yes, they have accessible toilets if your caught out in Chinatown - and worthwhile visiting for the colourful displays, murals and statues enclosed within its walls - including Ganesha (my favourite elephant God . . )"
,,Good enough from the outside.,4.0,,You have to pay to enter this temple unlike the temple of the tooth. It's an interesting view from the outside but we didn't bother going in
,,Better come with a tour guide,3.0,,"The architecture is nice and strange thus somewhat interesting to watch. However it does not have much to offer. You will have to leave your footwear outside. It is free to watch but you will have to pay to take picture or film the site.
To have a better experience you should come with a guide who knows how to explain the meanings of the various decorations inside the temple. Otherwise, it is not so interesting at all. There is a restricted area inside the temple which is reserved NOT for visitors, where they perform the rituals and offerings to their gods. You are allowed to watch, though. Again, it would be more interesting with a guide telling you the meanings of all the things going on."
,,Stunning,5.0,,A Hindu temple very close to Chinatown.Stunning decorations outside and inside you must leave your shoes outside.Hundreds of shops around.
,,Blessed!,5.0,,"One of the best Hindu temples in Singapore, located very near to the China Town MRT station. The deities are beautiful and the temple feels blissful during aarti time.

For taking your camera, a 3S$ entry fee is there but it's worth it. All the walls are beautifully painted with images of deities. Recommended!!!"
,,Stunning,5.0,,All I can say is wow this place is amazing ! Our first trip to Asia and I had seen this temple in a guide book before we left and I am so glad we went to see it ! I have some of the most beautiful photos I have ever taken from this place ! Stunning ! $3 to use a camera sooo worth it . Also the added advantage of Chinatown for shopping and eating.
,,"Sri Mariamman temple , a gem in the Chinatown",3.0,,"This oldest Hindu temple is very close to Chinatown , can reach from Pagoda street foe a short walk , not far from here sits the Buddha tooth relic temple.Stunning decorations from the outside and from the inside.Must take off shoes , and its advisable to wear proper attire.Taking pictures inside must pay $ 3 but i think its worthed for the beautiful pictures we've taken"
,,"Colourful, decorative building, no explanations and grumpy me on door.",3.0,,"The temple stands out as being different from the reds of Chinatown. Very ornate facade over main door and appealing interior inviting us to take a closer look. Shoes must be removed, and prams left by door, guarded by very grumpy man telling everyone, shoes off, pay for cameras, etc before anyone has a chance to do otherwise.

The building is beautiful in a bright gaudy way, flowers adorn different statues and shrines, incense wafts through. However there is no explanations inside, so google before or afterwards."
,,Eyecatching Colours,4.0,,"Came across this temple by accident, whilst walking through Chinatown. The front entrance is very spectacular. There is a token fee to take photos/videos inside the Temple of about £1.50-£2.50. The statues and artwork are very colourful and worth a visit. A calming place to walk through after the bustle of Chinatown. A helpful local, explained the significance of the different Gods."
,,a hindu temple in chinatown,5.0,,"the most powerful of deities MARIAMMAN,the Goddess is housed in the midst of Singapore.
the location is in Chinatown.
huge statue of goddess and well adorned,I went there during the evening aarti time.authentic priests did the entire pooja rituals.
Prasadam was also given generously to all the devotees.
would love to go again."
,,Expected a lot more,3.0,,We expected more about this temple but we could only see a few things benauwd we weren't Indian. Because we wantend to take some pictures we payed an old man at the entrance 4$ and we were only 3 minutes inside because it's pretty small.
,,Historic temple,4.0,,This is actually located near china town .nice to see one South Indian temple in the midst of Chinese culture.temple is well maintained with all poojas &other important rituals.Archeological evidences are there in the temple to show that this is one of the ancient temples in Singapore.
,,A different ambiance,4.0,,"The temple is located near chinatown stores, we saw the temple's entrance and we took pictures once we arrived at the entrance of the temple. I was just stunned by the colors, and I've researched that this is one of the oldest temple in singapore....More"
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"Stunning from the outside, this is cavernous, void of very much decoration and not very interesting once inside. Maybe we went at the wrong time? The Buddhist temple 100m away in Chinatown was stunning though"
,,"Good visit, especially exciting with Deepavali preparations going on",4.0,,"As previous reviewers have said this South Indian temple is hard to miss if you are in Chinatown. The outside is remarkable in its own right, but even more so because it is in the heart of yet another world culture, Chinatown, which is in...More"
,,Mariamman Temple in Singapore,5.0,,"Being my maiden visit to Singapore, I visited the Mariamman Temple (which is very close to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple). The temple appeared to be very well maintained, with very colorful Hindu, religious painting on the walls and ceilings."
,,It's okay.,4.0,,"On the same street with the Tooth Relic Buddha temple, it's confidently in walking distance, so worth a visit while you're already there. I found nothing special there. The display is very colorful and beautiful but I've seen better. It has an impressive main gate,...More"
,,Gorgeous colours,3.0,,Didn't need much time here. Didn't take photos as they ask for money if film or photos taken. The outside is just as interesting as in.
,,The oldest Hindu temple in Singapore...worth a visit!,5.0,,"Good: -The exterior has not changed since its inception. -It is friendly to visitors. -Great photo-spot. Bad: -Shoes to be left outside the temple, so pls refrain from wearing expensive shoes. -Hot weather inside. -To reach the temple, some walking is required."
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"Stumbled across this while wandering around Chinatown. Beautiful ceiling paintings, sculptures, and interiors. You'll have to buy a photo pass to take pictures (I think it was a few dollars) but definitely worth the visit. It is just a few blocks from the Buddha Temple...More"
,,Wonderfull,5.0,,"This is situated at China town once you come out of MRT you can see the temple colourfull tower. This is a south indian traditional hindu temple all rituals are conducted according to their traditions, Entrance is free footwear not allowed you can leave it...More"
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,"In order to enter teh temple you have to remove your shoes in keeping with Hindi tradition. Inside key religious areas are out of bounds to tourists, however this does not prevent you from absorbing the atmosphere and enjoying the beautiful architecture."
,,For the ardent Hindu and for the inquisitive,3.0,,"Located at the end of Temple Street (adjacent to Pagoda Street, which is the exit of Chinatown MRT across the main road), this temple well resembles any temple in Tamil Nadu in the South of India. Photography inside comes at a price and may be indulged depending on your level of keenness. Most are content taking the photos from outside and then walking in (minus the footwear, please! It is Singapore, nobody steals the shoes, dearie!) to take a look around, pray if you so wish, and take a moment to admire the architecture and colours, before coming right out. For those with religious inclinations and those who have never been to one earlier, stay at prayer time, and you shall be rewarded with a fragrant session of religion, mixed with city spirit. When outside, spend a minute observing the detail of the top roof, with its multiple colours and images of gods and goddesses. The more you identify and photograph individually, the more blessings you gain, as per Hindu mythology (OK, I made that up!). But worth a visit, when you come to Chinatown markets, and after this, head to the Tooth Relic (a separate review) Buddha Temple for another 30 minutes of peace, before you hit the food joints and open up the beer cans."
,,Nice temple nothing extraordinary but good enough to visit atleast once,4.0,,"Good place for all people from different parts of the world and for Indians it has repetitive value as they can go for their player many times/occasions.

Nice work too see and take photos, you has need to pay just 3 SGD to use camera inside the temple.

Very near to Chinatown MRT i.e. 5 mins walk from exit A of MRT."
,,Nice temple,3.0,,"This is a must see if you haven't ever been to an Indian temple. If you have though, it may be some more of the same. Really nice site, and very convenient as it is really close to many other landmarks, so don't miss it if you're visiting Chinatown."
,,A must see for westerners.,5.0,,"This Temple is a must-see for visitors from 'Western' cultures. The sheer grandeur of the Temple is amazing. For the more touristy among us, it is a great backdrop for the travel photo. Also, it is located in one of the most interesting parts of Singapore, Chinatown. The markets next door are really good too! Gee, if you are visiting Singapore and have a few hours to spare .. don't miss this."
,,One of the nicer and modern Hindu Temples in Singapore,4.0,,"In the middle of Chinatown, this relatively modern Hindu Temple has beautiful paintings, ceramic sculptures, and a superb backdrop of Singapore central business district. On the other hand, this is the only Hindu Temple that asks tourists to pay for the privilege of bringing your camera in and taking pictures. But hey, for 3$, perhaps it is worth it."
,,Great Photo-Opp,4.0,,Great photo-opp! Temple is very colorful with statues worth-appreciating. A must-visit if you are ever in Chinatown.
,,Colorful temple,4.0,,Colorful temple to visit in Chinatown. Do not hesitate to have a look even for 10 minutes. remember to buy a ticket if you want to take photo ;)
,,Sri Mariamman Temple,4.0,,An old Hindu temple visited by numerous devotees. Prayers are offered in day as well as in evening. Good time is to go in the evening and sit there quietly for a while. Very crowded in weekends and during Hindu festivals.
,,Interesting and Colorful Temple around the Corner of Chinatown,4.0,,"You will be asked to remove your shoes to get in. No fee is required, unless you intend to take pictures, for which donations are asked. The temple is quite big, very colorful and full of Hindu religious figures, both sculpted and painted. Beautiful sculptures are located on top of the walls and roofs. It's located just around the corner of the main Chinatown pedestrian street, so just plan to combine both visits!"
,,Make time to visit the splendid Sri Mariamman Temple,4.0,,"A visit to Chinatown wouldn't be the same without visiting Sri Mariamamman Temple, Singapore's oldest Hindu Temple. The temple was built in 1827 to the Godess Mariamman known for her power to cure illnesses and disease. The temple's ornamental tower entrance dotted with gods, goddesses and mystical beasts has been a landmark to generations of worshippers. Come early before the hoards of tourist buses arrive. Leave your shoes outside the temple, before heading inside. I would recommend to anyone coming bring a pair of socks to wear, wandering around outside on the tarmac is incredibly hot and I had to hop my way between shaded areas. Admission is free into the temple, although there is a $3.00 camera charge to take photos (no flash). Whilst there isn't a dress code and I appreciate Singapore is very warm, dress appropriately for a temple just to be respectful. Rituals and praying is going on a lot of the time at the temple and there are areas where tourists are restricted from entering.

The temple itself is beautiful, highly colourful and very ornate you could look at the sculptures for ages. It's a busy temple, but has a great atmosphere and is well worth visiting whilst in Chinatown. I would also consider a trip to the close by Buddha Tooth Relic Temple as well.

There is a fire walking festival here every October and November."
,,"It's a sacred Hindu place, must to visit it.",4.0,,"Exactly between the Clarke Quay MRT station and Chinatown mark this beautiful Hindu temple.
The most striking thing is the entrance, a giant door with above a pyramid consisting of many characters I think are all characters of this religion.
Admission is free, ticket fees are applied S$ 2 only for those who possess any kind of camera devices.
Before entering into the temple as a form of respect must necessarily remove sandals or shoes.
The Interior is very large, there are several things to see, many sacred altars and statues dedicated to the Hindu gods, beautiful frescoes and much much more.
Walking inside this temple would better not shout, there are many people in reflection or praying.
It is however allowed to take pictures and I think it is proper to do, it's really a fascinating place. Visiting unless you stop to pray, it's no longer than 1 hr."
,,Sri Marimman Temple - Great stop to make in Chinatown,4.0,,"We visited the Sri Mariamman Temple in Chinatown for the first time in some number of years and very much enjoyed our return to this Hindu temple, which is the oldest in Singapore. Entry is free (SG$3 fee for camera use) and the temple is located on South Bridge Road, near the main street shopping areas of the Chinatown district.

We have always liked the ornamental entrance tower and colourful deities that you can see at Sri Mariamman. There is a now a well painted hall ceiling that we didn't remember from past visits. Collectively, these make it worth spending the SG$3 so that you can take pictures.

Our recent visit, interestingly took place during late afternoon prayer time. As such, we were able to listen to traditional drum and horn play for over 20 minutes while the worshippers made their rounds to the various rooms, smaller temples and deities their prayers. This created a atmospheric experience that made our visit to Sri Marimman even more enjoyable.

Like many places in Singapore, we continue to be impressed by the cleanliness and tidiness of Sri Marimman, something those who have visited temples in India will have no trouble recognising and appreciating. It just makes visits to such places a much nicer experience.

Overall, we remain very impressed with the Sri Marimman Temple and would suggest that visitors to Chinatown definitely plan a quick stop here at least. Stay longer if you enjoy Hindu temples. This is a place we will continue to return to see with visits to Chinatown in Singapore.

Hint: Along South Bridge Road you can also visit the Jamae Mosque and the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum found just a block or two on both sides of The Sri Marimman Temple. Both are worth a visit, particularly the impressive Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum.

Hint: For those who are particular fans of Indian and Hindu temples, a similar visit can be had at Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple in the district of Little India. This temple has a similar ornamental tower and is even more elaborately decorated and colourful inside."
,,Beautiful temple,4.0,,Well known Hindu temple in Chinatown. Worth a visit if in the vicinity. No charge although accept donations if taking photographs. Huge temple with small temples and alters inside the area. Lots going on with local worshipers coming and going.
,,Beautiful temple,5.0,,"This is Singapore's oldest Hindu temple founded in 1827 and located in chinatown. Again this is a must see temple in chinatown, we visited this, the Buddha Tooth Relic temple, Jamae Mosque and Thian Hock Keng temple. Parts are not accessable to non Hindu visitors but you can see everything. Very colourful and busy when we visited, took loads of lovely photographs. Free to get in and recommended."
,,Serene and shining,5.0,,"This is a hindu temple in the middle of china town. Admission is free!, the place is very calm and full of color and energy! One of the best temples I have ever seen!"
,,very calm and serene,5.0,,"One of teh heritage places in Singapore and located close to Chinatown MRT, its the oldest temple in Singapore. Restricts the entry of non Hindu tourists to the outside of main temple building.
The Goddess statue is beautiful as are the other statues in the complex. Just beside the temple is the Pagoda street with small shops selling souveniers. In this street u have a shop selling Tintin books and products. Really enjoyed the shop as I am a big Tintin fan."
,,Colorful,4.0,,"If you are in Chinatown, this is located at the end of the street when coming from the mrt. The place have so much color. Pay a visit during weekday.. So much crowd on weekends..."
,,One of my favourite temples,5.0,,It was my second time in Singapore and get back to the wonderful temple. Loved the colours and flamboyance and all the rituals! I hope I would go there some day again...
,,Colorful,5.0,,"It was interesting to see all the colorful figures on the rooftops. The temple provided some serenity from the bustle of Chinatown. To take photographs, there is a gentleman just inside the entrance requesting a SGD $3 donation for a ""photo pass"". This allowed us to take pictures inside but I don't think anyone was really checking to see if we had it. I recommend it for a short visit. The temple is very close to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and the Maxwell Road Hawker Center."
,,Nice Indian temple,5.0,,"Probably the best Indian temple in Singapore, seems the largest anyway and is conveniently located next to Chinatown."
,,Best Hindu temple in SIN,4.0,,"This Hindu temple is one of the best I ever visit, as this here is very colorful and there is so many different faces here.You really fill that you are in India and not in SIN. Remember to turn of your flash when you takes photos."
,,So beautiful,4.0,,"Just a stunning temple. I had never been to a Hindu temple before and I have never seen so many colors and details. You do need to take you shoes off and you may have to pay, I didn't when I went in but I had read you did. I wish there was more information around so I could understand what I was looking at, but it was a really nice place to visit. I highly recommend it."
,,Enjoy the silence and the mystical ambience,5.0,,Take off your shoes at the entrance. Walk inside without socks - it's comfortable and refreshing. Buy a ticket that allows you to take pictures. Light a phooja and remember a loved one. It is an enriching experience you shouldn't miss if you are open to that.
,,Be cautious in and out,4.0,,"Nearly every religious site or temples has yellow lines surrounding the site, which means you need to take off your shoes to get in. Some of them require female visitors to wear shawls. Read around carefully before snapping photos coz there can be additional charges!"
,,Lovely colourful temple,4.0,,"close to Chinatown & MRT, nice Hindu temple, wonderfully detailed and colourful statues, oldest Hindu temple in Singapore"
,,Burst of Colour!,5.0,,"A beautifully designed and colourful hindu temple. One may also request for a phooja to ward off negativity and bring good health and peace! great experience!! The priests are friendly and are willing to embrace anyone, hindu or not..."

,,"Colourful, spiritual",4.0,,This temple is a peaceful oasis in the middle of the city. Colourful figures of gods and beasts everywhere you look and a wonderful hawker centre and shopping street nearby
,,Hindu Temple,4.0,,A good temple to visit to get a taste of the temples in India. English speaking individuals there to explain some of the interesting things and happenings there.
,,Great cultural experience,4.0,,A great cultural experience that is super cheap to do. You do have to remove your shoes. We put ours in our backpack because there was no way we were leaving our very expensive shoes out the front.
,,quite interesting but..,3.0,,"i feel like,' oh.. so that's just it.. so.. what next.. ' and directly i went to another place.. so, im not that excited about it.."
,,Hindu temple,3.0,,"its a typical hindu temple away from india. So if haven't been to india , then do visit it . Its color full with lots of hindu devotees offering prayers & puja."
,,Holy Place,4.0,,"The temple in the mid of city area.Clean, well maintained and friendly and approachable priest.Every Friday, we would be able to get sweet rice at 7-8 am prayers and dharshan from the temple."
,,Very Impressive Temple,5.0,,"Wow, this temple is very impressive. I'm not a religious person, but this display of devotion to their God/s is magnificent to see."
,,Complex and rich,5.0,,You can see and appreciate the amazing attention to detail that was given. It is nice how open and welcoming they make feel those who come just as a one-time visitor.
,,Very cool to see,4.0,,Even if you are like me and had no interest in going inside this temple the outside facade is worth taking the time to see. Very interesting and a good photo op. The neighborhood this is in also has a lot of shops and places to eat. Can spend a couple of hours in the area. If you are in a rush you can see the outside of this temple and get your photo in only a few minutes and be on your way.
,,Very colourful and interesting,4.0,,"Sri Mariamman Temple was a very interesting experience, we went of a night time and even though there was a ceremony taking place we were able to enter and look around. Lighting is good at night to look around and the night sky makes a great backdrop for photos of the dioramas on the roof. There is no cost to enter you pay a fee to use your camera or video ($3 SGD for camera, $6 for video. No change is given so you must have correct change or be prepared to pay whaterver you hand over and not begrudge that as it is a donation).
Shoes must be removed (please respect the request as per the sign and put you shoes on the rack, we couldn't believe how many people left their shoes in the door way!). You can wander around at your leisure and take photos, don't forget to look up the artwork on the ceiling is interesting! There are areas that are signed no photography."
,,Interesting,4.0,,It's color... It's arts... It's statue.. Even it's aromatic smells of incenses are interesting and beautiful.. Feels like we are not in singapore at all.. Very nice piece of heritage.
,,Holy cow!,4.0,,"This temple is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore. When I arrived they were renovating it, so I didn't enter, but the outside area has intricate ornaments (lots of cows and other typical statues). Worth a visit if you're in Chinatown."
,,No religion greater than being humane...,4.0,,"Sri Mariamman Kovil (‘kovil’ is the Tamil word for temple) is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore – we understand it dates back to 1827, which makes it almost two centuries old! This temple is consecrated to the powerful goddess Mariamman, who is specially worshipped for her power to protect and cure believers from epidemics and other diseases.

Located on South Bridge Road in the heart of Chinatown, the temple is open daily from 7am-12pm and then again from 6pm-9pm. This temple is managed by the Hindu Endowments Board of Singapore, and given its heritage, has been declared a National Monument.

This temple was apparently set up by Mr. Naraina Pillai, a British East India Company clerk who we are told came to Singapore along with Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore. Mr Pillai, an enterprising man, set up the first brick kiln in Singapore and quickly gained stature as both a successful businessman and a leader of the local Indian community.

The design and architecture of this temple is quintessentially South Indian – it is built in the style typical of Tamilnadu. The most visible and striking architectural feature of the temple is its ‘gopuram’ (the tower above its main entrance). It is a beautifully and richly worked six tier structure resplendent with elaborate, colourful images of Hindu divinities and mythological creatures. While we could not obviously check this out, we were told the ‘gopuram’ of this temple features no less than 72 carvings of Hindu deities!

On entering the prayer area of the temple, your attention is immediately drawn to the main shrine of Sri Mariamman. The deities of Rama and Murugan are on either side of this central shrine. The Draupadi shrine is next in importance only to Sri Mariamman since Draupadi is the focal point of the annual ‘theemithi’ (fire walking ceremony), at the temple, around October-November. (Draupadi apparently walked barefoot over hot coals to prove her innocence – in remembrance and thanksgiving, during ‘theemithi’ worshippers voluntarily undertake the extreme penance of walking barefoot on hot coals without any visible sign of agony) To the left of Draupadi’s shrine are the five Pandavas from the Mahabharata along with their mentor Sri Krishna. The other deities in the temple are Durga, Ganesa and Aravan.

Quite apart from the temple’s architecture and its manifest spiritual ambience, as travellers from India, what really warmed our hearts was getting to know about the role this temple played in its earliest years. Apparently, in those days of yore, Hindu immigrants to Singapore were allowed to stay at the temple until they could find themselves a livelihood and a place to live. The temple was thus a living expression of the essence of all religions – that there is no religion greater than being humane.

The other role this temple played in the 1800s was being the Registry of Marriages for Hindus at Singapore – only this temple's priest was authorised to conduct Hindu marriages and make them official. Even today it is a much sought after venue for Hindu weddings. Apart from providing continuity of age old Hindu traditions and religious events, the temple today also plays an active role in sponsoring educational and social initiatives. These include free medical counseling and health screening, free and subsidised pre-school education to economically disadvantaged children through its own kindergartens and so forth.

It was inspiring to see that by no stretch of imagination can the Sri Mariamman temple be classified as a Hindu place of worship – it attracts people across races, religions and nationalities and enfolds them all in its unifying embrace of a common humanity.

We are from South India – and so you may find some of these hints useful:

Hint 1: As with all religious shrines, too much noise is not welcomed by either the worshippers or the temple priests. Silence is the norm.

Hint 2: Footwear has to be left outside the temple door and you are expected to enter the temple premises barefoot.

Hint 3: Conservative apparel that does not show too much skin is considered appropriate.

Hint 4: Within the temple, worshippers circumambulate clockwise around the shrines, always an odd number of times (such as 1 or 3 circumambulations for example – never 2 or 4).

Hint 5: Photography within the temple is discouraged if not expressly forbidden. So it would be best to restrict your photographs to the exteriors of the temple – the ‘gopuram’ is in any case the pièce de résistance of this temple, and you can get beautiful snaps of that standing outside on South Bridge Road."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,This temple is old and has an interesting history. It is also a good place to offer prayers as it is peaceful. The staff are helpful too.
,,Evening best,4.0,,"Visited around 18:30 and there was a ceremony going on, with music and chanting. You can combine the visit with a stroll to Chinatown and a chinese food dinner in one of the nice restaurants nearby. Also, the chinatown heritage museum is just around the corner at Pagoda str. Overall, you can have a fun few hours around the temple."
,,Nice temple in Chinatown,4.0,,"we walk through Pagoda Street in Chinatown to go to this temple, there's a wedding celebration actually when we are there, the temple full of smell of flowers. Good for culture learning"
,,One of the oldest Indian temples in Singapore,4.0,,A beautiful temple and if you have the chance of a guided tour around it's wonderful how much you can learn about Hindu mythology and religion.
,,charming temple,4.0,,Went inside to take a quick look and found that there was some service going on. Very interesting to feel and see the rituals of another religion. Give it a visit when you're in the area. A few steps down is a mosque-very unique and very Singapore to find temples/churches of different faiths beside each other
,,Interesting Hindu temple,4.0,,"If you are in Chinatown, then have a look. Free entrance with a small fee to take photos. Really interesting temple."
,,The detail to the roof is amazing,5.0,,"If in Chinatown, it is definitely worth walking past this temple. Cows sit along the high fence."
,,Good icon,4.0,,"One of the oldest Hindu Temple and weird in a way to have find it in Chinatown. But only to show the great integration of the many races into on the isle.
Prepare yourself for the visit without wearing expensive footwear (cos you'd need to take them over and leave them outside the temple) and DO NOT wear mini skirt or hot pants. You need to cover your legs as a form of respect. In general, nothing too revealing, tho it is quite tough under the heat of the city.
You will be awed by the colors and how well it is being conserved through the century."
,,Very nice atmosphere,4.0,,I recommend visiting if you are in Chinatown as it's very close to Pagoda St and the Chinatown MRT. Admission is free but there is a small fee to take photos inside. There is no charge to take photos of the exterior. It would be more interesting if you are able to be visit during one of the Hindu services.
,,Favourite temple,5.0,,One of my favourite temple in singapore.... amazing place which greets us with peacefulness.... Sri Mariamman deity welcomes us with complete smiling face....
,,Like this place,4.0,,"I think this is perhaps the nicest Hindu temple in Singapore. Near to China town, and accessable by foot as you explore the China town area, the temple is worth a visit."
,,Check the time before you visit here,3.0,,I walked to this temple after visiting the Buddha Tooth Relic. The temple has opening & closing time. I went there when the temple was closed. The temple itself was not closed but the main Deities were not visible. They were curtained in so we can see them. So do check the timing when visit this place
,,Interesting Hindu temple!,5.0,,"Interesting Hindu temple! I like Sri Mariamman temple which located in Chinatown area. Don't have to be a Hindu to visit the temple. Hindu gods & goddesses are nice, colourful & beautiful. So, if you are in the area, just walk in & explore!"
,,Cool landmark,4.0,,"We kind of happened upon Sri Mariamman while taking a walk through Chinatown, although I had actually planned to see it but forgot its location. The exterior decoration is definitely the coolest part. It is free to walk around inside the temple but if you want to take pictures there is a small fee. Not a must see, but if you are in the area you should stop by!"
,,Extravagant architecture,4.0,,"As a first-time visitor to Singapore or South Asia, this is a fascinating and intriguing place. Travel-weary or experienced tourists may feel underwhelmed or bored, but the gopuram (tower) is colourful and extravagant, and the atmosphere inside can be quite electric during some of the temple’s activities. We happened to be in the area with our three kids (age 7, 6 and 2 years) during a traditional Hindu service, and were able to enter the temple and watch the service from the sidelines… a fantastic and unique opportunity for our kids to immerse in a completely different and foreign culture. If there is nothing exciting happening inside, I would only recommend a quick visit (approx. 10min)… you could probably double that if something interesting is going-on inside."
,,Good structure,3.0,,"You'd have to take off your shoes in front of the temple.
Picture taking is allowed with A FEE.
The structure in front of the temple is eye catching.
There are also several statues inside - really colorful! Also, near Buddha Tooth Relic. Go there is you still have time."
,,Colorful Temple in China Town,4.0,,"This temple is one of the most colorful in Singapore. It recently completed a renovation project, and the murals inside and the temple outside is very vibrant as a result. You need to remove your shoes to enter."
,,Don't forget to take off your shoes outside!,4.0,,"So for Westerners it would seem weird to take off your shoes outside on a public street and just leave them there but that's what you have to do before you go into the temple. You can't miss this site...it is ornate and colorful and literally 1 block down from the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. You might as well go to both while you're in China town. There are lots of interesting statues and artwork all over this place. Depending on how interested you are, you could spend a few minutes here or quite a bit of your afternoon here."
,,Very nice temple!,4.0,,"Located in the Chinatown part of Singapore this temple is a very one to visit. Easy to make a combo with Relic Tooth building and all the nice things of Chinatown itself (shopping/eating).

Well maintained temple complex. Very colourfull and lots of details. Also very photogenetic place!"
,,Great Atmosphere,4.0,,"Nice atmosphere, right in the middle of the city. Incredible view."
,,Worth a visit if you are in Chinatown,4.0,,"Great culture. An all around beautiful temple. If you are close by, I would absolutely suggest a visit."
,,Must see when in Chinatown,4.0,,This place is a must-see when in Chinatown to complete the cultural experience. The structure is very unique and fascinating.
,,The most colourful...,5.0,,"well, all Hindu Temples are with their intricate depictions of their pantheon of Gods and dieties... but this is conveniently located right smack in China Town -- testament to Singapore being a melting-pot of cultures!"
,,Om Sakthi,4.0,,"I am a local Singaporean Chinese but I did help out with this temple for four years previously.

This temple is one of the most tourist friendly temple in Singapore. And it is also right smack in Chinatown, which is another hot tourist spot. Sri Mariamman Temple (SMT) is dedicated to the Hindu Goddess (yes you guess it, Sri Mariamman). However within the temple, you can find other deities of the hindu pantheon as well. This temple is the oldest in Singapore and had just finished its consecration ceremony in year 2010.

Not to be miss is the Gopuram which is the decorated front entrance of the temple which is a standard for hindu temples.

If you wished to witness a pooja or prayers, do visit them at auspicious timing, normally from 1000hrs to 1200hrs and evenings from 1800hrs to around 2000hrs. Even if you are not locals, feel free to step forward to receive a blessing from the priest.

There are no cost involve unless you take photography or video. In any case, just be respectful.

There are no fixed dress code to enter the temple. Strictly, ladies should be covered from shoulder to ankle. However I have never witness any tourist being rejected for wearing tank tops with bermudas yet.

When you enter the temple, you must be bare feet. However you can choose to carry your shoes in a bag. I will reccomend this because some not-so-alert people would sometimes mistakenly walk away with your shoes.

If you are visiting Singapore during the October period, you must visit Sri Mariamman Temple for their Firewalking festival or theemidhi, where devotees will walk across burning coals. Theemidhi always starts on a Monday of the week before Deepavali, or the hindu festival of light. The dates varies due to the astrological calendar and as such the best way is to check on the Hindu Endowment Board website: ---------------

Another temple to visit is the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple but that is for another review. Enjoy!"
,,"Get ""teleported"" to India.....",4.0,,"Clean and amazing artisans works on the ceiling, carvings, .... convenient location for visiting. Just steps away from eateries and the Chinatown, like going from different cultures within step...Minus- Photographers have to pay photo-taking fee of S$2. Unbelievable..."
,,Watch the pagent of worship unfold before you,5.0,,"All day long, but especially in the early morning hours you can witness the beauty of Hindu worship.

Families and individuals, wedding parties and businessmen on their way to the office arrive and join the worshipers at one of the several ornate shrines.

Take off your shoes before you enter, stand to the side of the worshipers, behave in a respectful manner, but by all means go! And take as many photos as you like. Singapore Hindus are very hospitable and do not object to respectful outsiders entering their temples.

Unlike India, you will not be surrounded by beggars or plagued by hawkers and ""guides"". And the temples are clean. One of the pleasures of Singapore life."
,,Fascinating temple,4.0,,Phenomenonal figures and architecture. Worth a visit. Oldest Hindu temple in Singapore but interesting to note there is a Coke machine right outside the door. Struck me as an odd juxtaposition of cultures .
,,"So colourful and interesting, well maintained.",5.0,,"It's the biggest hindu temple and probably the oldest. So colourful and interesting with so many dieties. I was there in the morning and there were many devotees attanding the moring prayer session, and a group of european tourists were busy clicking away their cameras. If you are visiting the Chinatown area then please vist this temple, worth the trip."

Tourist can visit the temple to pray the god and take photo graphs, but not allowed to wear the shoes inside the temple. Currently (10-Jan-2010) renovation is going on and Maha Kumbavishakam (Temple warming) is planned on April 2010. You can see the Sri Mariamman and other god’s statue on the outside corridor."
