,,Good place to offload some big money.,4.0,,"Enjoyed our visit. But not really my kind of thing. I see people sitting there for hours betting really big money. I never expect to win, so if you keep that in mind it’s fun to just play a little.
Some people are expert gamblers on machines or roulette or cards."
,,Won,5.0,,"Yup. I won.
Roulette. Probably my lucky game cos I win always, even though in not big quantity. Just enough to fly me to Bangkok for a weekend vacay, including expenses.
Tricky to decide 3zero or 2zero roulette. But honestly, it's all the same cos the ball and your fate will decide if you win or lose. No hankypanky at all.

Play smart within your bankroll budget and never go the extreme. Cut loss is better than lose all.
But if you're on a winning streak, stay. Don't leave when you're winning. Catch the wind and aim for the sky."
,,A typical casino,5.0,,I just wanted a chip for a marker when playing golf ($5 min). You need your passport to get in but there is no hassle. The robotic drink cart is cool. I'm not a gambler but collect collect chips from cities I visit and so this was cool and they make great golf markers (doesn't help the golf though!!!).
,,"Nothing exciting, it’s just a casino",3.0,,"First thing for a foreign visitor, you need a passport to enter and leave the casino. High stake tables, poker machines are typical, feed money in, press buttons, lose money.
We did have some lovely food though, and watched some people play the high stakes tables."
,,Give it a miss,3.0,,"Big casino with lots of options but terrible service and high limits.
Show passport on the way in is normal but show passport on the way out also? Last time I looked this was not an immigration checkpoint which I’d already cleared the previous day. I like to be welcomed with open arms to a place where I’m likely to lose my money not be made to feel like an unsavoury character."
,,Quick gamble at marina bay casino,3.0,,"Average casino in my oppinion tho offers your standard pokies of diffeent limits and ypur table cashgames against the house..baccarat,blackjack,pontoon etc:there is no poker where you play against other players! But offers your carribean stud and hold em etc:against the house still if ypu want to play poker(texas holdem) you will have to goto resorts world in sentosa to play
Has a smoking and non smoking floor.
Tourists will have to present passport to get inside and it will cost nothing to enter except if your a singapore local where as they do have to pay to enter."
,,Boring...,2.0,,"Can't say this Casino offered any wow factor. The highlight for us was the robot drink cart. Beyond that, the place just has a smoke haze from all the cigarettes and no alcohol on offer. The slots are not that new or fun and there really wasn't much else on offer."
,,Good casino for slot games,5.0,,Very large casino with plenty of space especially for slot games. Entry is free for foreigners and beverages are also free. They also have a good restaurant inside
,,"Been there, done that",3.0,,"This was our first exposure to an Asian Casino. First, you need to show your passport which was not a surprise.

There are minimum bets; again, not a surprise.

It was smoky, like most casinos we have been in.

Glade we saw it, but would not spend a lot of time, or money, there."
,,"Winner Winner, Chicken dinner !!",5.0,,"Winner Winner, Chicken dinner !! Got to be here if you want to try your luck while in Singapore. Big, huge and beautiful. If you are a professional or a amateur or just want to try your hand, this is it."
,,Cool Casino but lacking,4.0,,Great hotel with a lot of great free beverages. But the slot selections were quite lacking. Kind of the same slots over and over but nice facility otherwise.
,,Good if you want to kill some time/relaxed dress code,3.0,,Great to visit the casino if you want to kill sometime in Singapore. Good looking casino however foreigners will find the table and slot limits quite high. And all the males should not worry about the dress code you can wear shorts like we did nd were not turned away. People were even wearing Sandler as well so you will be ok.
,,Marina Bay sands casino is worst for foreigners.,1.0,,"I am visiting this Marina Bay sands casino quite often and become Paiza Gold member. Casino has worst payouts from slot machines. They only give good amount of jackpots to Singaporean and PR and they loot foreigner. They manipulate the slot behavior and machines payout. Anyone can clearly find out that suddenly machine start behaving weird and they kill the player and loot all the money. I will give you an example, payouts are manipulated and even the person loose 400K SGD, their slots are always in money eating mode. Avoid this casino."
,,Friday,4.0,,"Located in the Shops at Maina Bay Sands, this Casino is sooo cool.

Honestly, I didn't want to stay that much because of the smell of cigarettes.

But I loved their beautiful chandelier in the ceiling, how clean this place was, the good amount of restaurants they had inside the casino, and the wonderful background music."
,,Marina Bay Sands Casino,3.0,,"An Enormous casino full with customers, many kind of Gambling games options. The smart thing for tourist is bring the foreign passport to get free entry, ignore long queue and gets free drinks inside. The Staff were friendly, helpful and welcome."
,,As Casinos Go This Is A Little Sterile and Boring,3.0,,My passport was checked multiple times before I could enter. The staff were friendly enough but the place was soulless. I know its job is to bleed you dry but unlike much of Singapore the art was underwhelming and machine variety was poor. If gambling’s your thing this will meet your needs. If you are after and experience you should look elsewhere.
,,Disappointed,3.0,,Saw this huge hotel when visiting Gardens by the Bay night time show. They would get a great view. As for the actual casino looks good and big but was really disappointed with the machines they had there. Hardly any 1 cent machines and the ones they had were very old. I have been to clubs here on the Gold Coast with more variety (Casino at Broadbeach)
,,Holiday experience,3.0,,A big casino with a lot of smokers. Ground floor was for smokers and 1st floor non smoking. Just lacked atmosphere. Good for a one time visit while on holiday.
,,Too big with lots of options,5.0,,From tourist point of view even a visit is must. Lots of people play here and with lot many game options. Best thing is foreign passport holders get free entry and gets free drinks inside. If someone wants to try their luck then may try it for sure. Lowest bid starts at 30 $ hence not too expensive just to try some games.
,,Better than RWS,5.0,,"Seriously, if you looking to play in a casino with some class and respect, MBS is far better than RWS in Sentosa.
The space here (although measured same or slightly equal) feels bigger, spacious and airy.
The staff here (the ones in jackets) are more approachable. And if you play at the High Limit area, the dealers and servers there are far more friendlier."
,,Vacation,4.0,,"Went here knowing from online they had a casino, like going in different countries. It's a descent size casino. When entering they ask for you passport if your not from Singapore, so good thing I had mine on me. They do have waitresses going around if you want drinks, they also have stations around they you can get your own soda,coffee, water, so that was nice. lots of table and slots to choose from."
,,Terrible,1.0,,I don’t recommend Singapore casino there’s some magic. I have visit 7 times but I haven’t win any penny.All games run by machines there are the one decide winner.
,,Not big gamblers!,5.0,,I spent about $2.00. Playing a 5 cent machine (the minimum bet was $1.25). Not too smoky but it was early on a Monday morning. All passports were checked
,,Gamblers,4.0,,spent few hours taking in the casino and learning new games. place is crowded and filled with locals
,,Not as good as other Casinos in other Countries,3.0,,"We went here 7 years ago, and I was disappointed this time to see so many pokie machines row after row that are the same, their wasn’t any variety, so I wonder if these machines are the most popular and that’s why this has been done. Casino isn't as Glamorous as other casinos around the world and a shame with the new smoking laws to still see it in the Casino and in Singapore. The carpets as so bad with ash and cigarette holes."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"Staff were friendly, helpful and delightful to engage with. Yes, its all about the view but for people like us from the hospitality industry, we also look for that personal attentive service and were not disappointed. Highly recommended! Loved it and would definitely go back."
,,A very average casino with poor table service,3.0,,"It’s hard to get in (passports needed that are scrutinised down to the dated passport stamps) and even hard to get out as passports are scrutinised again.
I spent $300 at three different tables, asking for a drink at each table and didn’t even manage to get a server to me. I eventually had a ‘growl’ at a manager who did manage to finally get me a waitress who took my drinks order (that I had to prepay) I waited for 10 mins or so for it to arrive. I moved tables again and again spent a reasonable amount of money ($500) and asked for a second drink. Again I had to pay for them (I’ve now spent well over $1,000) and wait a good 10 mins for them to arrive.
If you are a coffee drinker maybe Marina Bay is for you as it’s self service, but if you expect any level of service if spending decent money on the tables I’m afraid you will be disappointed"
,,Worth it,4.0,,recently went to singapore for holiday with my husband. went here for restaurant and casino but never go to the hotel because wil be expensive for us two. if its a whole family then much worth it i guess. but we did enjoy the place especially the casino. lucky strike! also went to celavie club and restaurant. i was very ecstatic its a must destination for tourist. Marina bay sands got all your entertainment needs. will recommend to all my friends in US and Phils. met alot of awesome fellow filipinos too.
,,Not fun even when winning,3.0,,"It's a large casino as others have mentioned. The passport check was pretty quick as it was a weekday night. ATMs are outside the check. For some reason, DBS ATM would only allow max $300SGD withdrawal. Didn't stay too long but played roulette and blackjack. Roulette table had both 0 & 00 and a ""Sands"" spot. Blackjack is all machine shuffle. Dealers are all robots. No smile, no small talk, no emotion, no fun. Other players as well were very ""stiff"". I'd just have to assume it's just how it is here as it was the same at the other casino."
,,Worth The Money,4.0,,"Although the cost is quite high, marina bay sands is one of the most iconic landmarks in sg. Definetly worth the money."
,,Largest atrium casino in the world! Don't stick around too much!,4.0,,"Pretty big Casino. I visited the Sentosa casino a couple of years ago, decided to try MBS this time. Overall both Casinos are almost same. Enjoyed a few games and surprisingly I won a (small) amount. Walked out with my money in my pocket and smile on my face.
There are a lot of slot machines but I was surprised by the lack of diversity in the slot games available, Casino should invest in a few simple slot games for beginners to enjoy. Free soft drinks for patrons.

Casinos are good for a bit of fun but don't go in expecting to make money, I just had a bit of luck, that's all. Casinos are huge revenue generating machines for their hotels... Singapore Casinos make >$3 billion a year. Obviously they don't make this money by giving it away to tourists :) Play a bit, expect to lose, and then walk out."
,,Gambling Paradise,4.0,,"MBS has no dearth of places where you can blow up your money and the Casino is number one on the list. Its spread over 3 floors - one section of which is non-smoking. If you are allergic to dense smoke then avoid the rest of the casino as just about everyone is smoking while gambling. They check your passport at the time of entry and after that no card or anything is required. You can straight away start playing.

I went there on a Saturday night. It was crowded with locals as well tourists. Quite a few people seemed to be regular gamblers. On one side there are the slot machines, followed by the online multiple player gaming stations and then you have the tables for Roulette, Blackjack, Poker and the likes. Lot of options for you to choose from. I started out with the slot machines and had no luck whatsoever. Then moved to the tables and after a bit of looking around was able to get a seat at a roulette table. Tripled my money there and decided to call it a night. There are people around you playing for hours and losing quite a bit of money.

Soft drinks, tea and coffee are on the house. Slot machines don't require cards - you can feed your money straight into the machine and when you are done you will get a printed receipt with your earnings and you can encash that at the cash counter along with your chips."
,,One of the worst casinos in the world,1.0,,"How people give this casino 4 or 5 stars is beyond me. The games suck, there's no bars, if you are lucky to find service you'll then have to pay for the drink even if you are playing, and you will wait 10 minutes for the drinks, and when exiting you have to show your passport again, as if showing it on entering the casino isn't enough. They flip through every page in the passport looking for the entry stamp. If you have lots of stamps in your passport, expect to wait. Then the taxi situation is just pathetic. There's no cabs, lots of scammers around, and we waited 45 minutes to get a taxi. There's no one organising taxis for casino patrons, it's like a bazaar. The casino is totally not worth the visit. There's no dress code either, it's a classless place."
,,Beautiful casino,4.0,,"Had a fun time here and I went on nights that were not busy. But the drinks were not free for gamblers. For a Vegas like expectation, I think that is a reasonable expectation. Otherwise, pretty cool place and casino"
,,Visually brilliant - also won!,4.0,,What a great place this is visually. The huge casino floors look incredible and there are so many tables on offer. I did come out up as well which always makes it more enjoyable
,,Racist Casino,1.0,,"Had an extremely disappointing, humiliating and racial experience at the Marian Bay Sands Casino. To think that in this age and time, one can still be discriminated based on ones passport is appalling to say the least. I am a human first before anything else. I was with my friends on a fun night out and your Casino spoilt our innocent fun with your black hatred. You can’t paint everyone with the same brush. I willingly answered all the questions that was asked to me but was told bluntly that since I had an Iranian passport and that this was a US based company, I wasn’t welcomed. The security in charge scanned my passport and asked several personal questions, only to be told that I couldn’t enter. How dare you insult my integrity, my humanness and my core, with your baseless judgement. I’m writing this to let you know that you can’t judge a book by its cover. Having said all this, I’ll be forever grateful to Sentosa Casino for not judging us and giving us a chance to create wonderful memories- after all what is life all about. My memory of racist Marina Bay Sands Casino will forever be tainted.

Also nowhere on your entrance rule was it mentioned that Iranian passport couldn't enter the casino .

Kindly make changes to your entry rules so as to not cause humilation .

,,"Great place to visit, don't stay too long!!!",3.0,,"Having been to casinos in Australia, Vegas and the Caribbean, the size and layout of the Marina Bay Sands Casino is impressive.

Why the average rating? Too much focus on slots and baccarat, however I suppose that is where the house makes the most money.

Smokey with an uncomfortable feel as a foreigner, I reckon I saw only 2 Aussies during my time in the gaming floor. The passport scan is ""interesting"" but somehow survived the security attack after pulling the phone out to take a photo (which I have added to this review).

Whilst you enter the casino with a mindset of losing a set amount, this casino just didn't have a feel of being hospitable, thus reducing the time you want to spend there.

The highlight, no doubt, was the robot delivering drinks to punters on the ground floor!!!

Ticked the box of casinos to visit, however unlikely to enter the place again."
,,"Visual spectacle, but not a gamblers paradise",2.0,,"This place is huge - and like every other place in Marina Bay screams decadence. I was excited at the scale of this establishment, expecting a Vegas-style experience. Sadly, this place has limited options for anyone NOT playing baccarat or slots. Service was decent, but the overall feel just left me wanting more... clearly the place is catering to the massive Chinese gambling market... if you prefer blackjack or poker-type games head to the casino in Sentosa"
,,Huge Casino,5.0,,Its one of the biggest Casinos I hv seen. And entry is also very swift and convenient. No entry charges
,,LOSE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE,2.0,,"This place was a complete disappointment. Bright lights are onthroughout the casino and the drinks are not free. The process to get into the casino is a pain in the neck. The casino consists of two large open spaces. No ambiance whatsoever which is surprising given the other Sands properties around the world. Additionally, there was not one single table offering traditional Blackjack. Every table had a gimmick - one table played with no 10s! They actually charge Singapore residents $100 to enter the casino. Can't imagine paying for this - not worth the time for free. This will definitely not be on my list next time I am in Singapore."
,,Waste of time,1.0,,"No atmosphere within this casino. Everything seemed to hard for staff to help.
The only plus about visiting this place as a foreigner is that it is free to enter via the airport customs style lines.
Don’t forget your passport if you wish to enter the casino"
,,Smokey casino,3.0,,"This one of the two legit casinos in Singapore. The casino has a classy yet elegant decoration. Unfortunately, it is quite chaotic and smokey. The non smoking and smoking section are close by."
,,No thanks,1.0,,"Great looking building but the Casino is probably one of the worst in the world, no atmosphere, cigarette smoke everywhere, security to enter and exit, locals pay S$100 per day or S$2000 per year just as an entry price which is just disgraceful, foreigners are free but you need your passport and will go through some serious security, horrible place"
,,Hardcore Gambling,3.0,,"This place is not entertainment per se, but it is more of hardcore gambling. You can see lots of Asians trying to beat the house; which is proven to be impossible over the long run. They separated the smoking and non-smoking floor pretty well. Service is next to non-existent; unless of course you are a big punter. Staff are not very friendly and not very responsive. However, the magnitude of the building and hardware is definitely impressive."
,,Brilliant as far as casinos go but smokers need to butt out,3.0,,"The Casiino is massive with hundreds of gaming tables and 1000 plus pokies.
Downstairs they allow smoking in most areas which for me detracts from the whole experience. A tip, if you want to gamble without the smokers go up to the first floor where the air is cleaner and smoking is banned.
A real eye opener was the table minimums for most games starting at $25 per bet and I think the max was $250K!!!
So if you are in the Marina Bay Area and casinos are your thing this casino would rate among the biggest and best."
,,Entry Levy = Entertainment,4.0,,"I'm a local so my entry levy is at a charge of $100. Free for other nationalities.

For the charge of $100, I always see it positively, like paying for a concert or musical in one of their cheaper seats, since we all know that concerts and musicals can cost far more than $100.

As for my budget for betting and gambling, I control it within a limit and no more.

So really, it can be a form of entertainment if we are all not greedy and demanding more than what we can achieve from gambling."
,,Ugh.,2.0,,"So below average. Infinitely hard to find someone to order a drink from, horrifically overpriced drinks when you finally get service, and a boring range of machines that pay terribly compared to other casinos. Go to Sentosa if you want to gamble while in Singapore - it's still not amazing but it's a darn sight better than MBS."
,,Marina Bay Sands Casino,5.0,,"Everybody like a little gambling. Make sure you take your passport with you, if you would like to visit."
,,Not As Good As You Would Think,3.0,,"After reading the procedures of getting in and the dress code requirements we decided to take a look whilst at the SkyPark. I know it reads no shorts but thats rubbish as I asked the security guard and he said it was no problem, I saw many people with shorts on.
Entry is a bit difficult, having to show passports. Thinking that Singapore was anti smoking, it was a shame to find the place full of people puffing away. They do have a no smoking section but you walk out of there stinking of stale smoke.
There are NO ATM's inside the casino, so you have to go back through security, yes correct, through security just to get out!
There was free stations for soft drinks and hot drinks, did not see any alcohol. They have these cool looking robots that are stocked with bottles of water than you can walk up to and take a bottle.
Lots of slots machines and table games. Lots of people just hanging about though just sitting there.
Worth a look, but dont go out of your way."
,,Absolutely terrible,1.0,,"Never seen such crap before at a casino, anywhere in the world. They treat you like convicts going in or out of the casino. What happens if you dont show your passport on way out? Do they pin you down?"
,,"Housed inside one of the world's most iconic structures, the casino at Marina Bay Sands encompasses more than 15,000 squ",5.0,,"Housed inside one of the world's most iconic structures, the casino at Marina Bay Sands encompasses more than 15,000 square meters of gaming space spread .."
,,Worst than worst service,1.0,,We supposed to be one of the best casino and place in the word!FORGET about it!All the local croupier and staff are very unfriendly and rude especially with the foreign people!The service is worst than worst!never wait in any casino around the world 40 min for two simple 33 ml tin cans of Heineken Beer(38$SGD)!embarrassing!never come back!
,,one of the best casino in asia,5.0,,infrastructure wise marina bay sands casino is in par with the best casinos in las vegas. only thing is the minimum bets is too high when compared to other casinos.
,,Do not go here,1.0,,"I wanted to go in. the staff at the entrance were not friendly. I had my Passport Card - issued by the government, but they would not take it, as they did not understand what it was. With all the international travelers, you would think the staff would be better trained and friendly. take your money to a casino that will appreciate your business."
,,casino,5.0,,"great casino , not like the other one that you must apply for card . drinks was awesome , i like it here"
,,Fun at Casino!,5.0,,"Casino was so much fun. We play Roulette and enjoyed every bit there. We made and lost money but the ambience is really nice. There are free soft drinks and coffee for players. They also have a really nice robot serving drinks.
For Non-Singaporeans - Carry your passport for free entry."
,,No alcohol and ATMs outside?,1.0,,"They really do everything possible here to prevent you from having fun. Cigarette smoke everywhere, zero alcohol served and if you want to pull out some money at the ATM do it before you get in or you’ll have to go through White House level security twice. Cool to see, but I’d gamble elsewhere."
,,Not that Great Casino,3.0,,"I was here for gambling , the casino was welcoming and clean , but the staffs was not that much trained for hospitality , slots were kept clean , but the spinners were very serious , no smile , no hospitality.. if you compare casino in Macau this casino is far away from their hospitality , this is the first casino in the world not providing Beer and spirits for their guests who play , only soft drinks , coffee tea are served , such a small country casinos in Kenya provides buffet food and unlimited beer and spirits for their guests , Management to think about this in future ."
,,Did not like it at all,2.0,,"We called in here after dinner to have a drink and a biot of gamble. All I can say is dont waste your time or money. If you are looking ng for a similar experience to Macau, Vegas or even Australia you will be deeply disappointed. The place did not haver pleasant vibe about it, it was fill of smoke and just not pleasant to be in. I would not go back here."
,,Non Smoking is a facade,1.0,,"The staff does not maintain the non smoking area. And the smoking area is not well separated from the non smoking area, making it impossible to enjoy the casino if you're a non smoker.

I guess the otherwise hard singapore regulations can be walked around as long as the establishment generates enough money."
,,Great Casino,5.0,,"Huge casino, not a whole lot of blackjack tables but at least 15, heaps of roulette and other tables games. Don’t forget your passport or you will have to pay $100 to gain entry. Recommend visiting this hotel and casino"
,,Big win,4.0,,An amazing casino with several thousand people there when we visited. Jackpots were higher than Aust. The smoke can be overpowering but food at the noodle house in the casino was amazing.
,,"Just a casino, nothing much to differentiate",3.0,,"Compared to Macau, I would say the dealers are more friendly. It’s a hassle getting in & out of the casino due to passport checks. I do not understand why it is necessary to check passports again when patrons leave. Transportation option is limited once MRT is closed. Took me a good 20 minutes lining up to get a taxi."
,,Huge..............,5.0,,"Had to make a point of visiting this casino to experience what I had heard, its a huge place full of gamblers from all over the world. Once again, it was a very busy place and is haven for people who enjoy gambling. For us though, we didn't last too long and made a point of leaving before we lost all of our holiday spending money."
,,Worth a look,4.0,,"Singapor casino is quite big. I’m not exactly sure how many floors there were but if you are a foreigner you must show your passport to be able to enter. We went during the day so as far as dress went it was very casual. Free bottles of water, tea,coffee and soft drink. Plenty of people were winning but unfortunately that didn’t include us. Worth having a look if time permits."
,,Just for fun - not to lost you pant .. hahaha,4.0,,"Get ready your passport & check to Ensure you are 21 years old prior entry into the casino.

Bulky bag? Backpack? Nope- not permitted into the casino. Just go to the counter n deposit the bag as to lighten your load. It is free. Do tell the security staff if you have a camera in the bag. They need to verify it for some security reason.

Well, join the Q into the casino - foreigner or local. Cash only in the casino- go to nearest ATM ( lot of them around) n get some cash.

1st timer n you are a foreigner ? You can enrol as a member n get $10 credit for a start ( do note most table games start at min. $25 except roulettes or slot machines)

Get your member card at the Member Reward Counter. Staff will assist you with registration. They do speak Japanese and other languages other than English / Mandarin.

Do remember to pass your member card at the table last or insert into the slot machines as to gain points.

Finally, enjoy yourself at the casino. Free non alcoholic drinks are available.

Keep hydrated ( lot of 2nd hand smoke as it is s free-smoking zone- lol ) but do gamble at a limit. You are here to enjoy the experience n not to lost a fortune.

Oh.. toilet ? Do look out for them when you make your round in the casino .. the place is huge and you do not want to start looking for it when the urge arrives."
,,Nice casino,4.0,,"One of the most interesting casinos in the world. There are many slot machines and tables for live play - roulette, baccarat, blackjack. For aliens, it's free, but you need to show your overseas passport."
,,IMPORTANT. You need your passport to get in!,2.0,,"To get into this casino if you are not a local you will need your passport else they won’t let you in. You also need it to get out for some reason too.
Smoking inside is also allowed as well. They do have “smoke free zones” but this isn’t, people don’t care and smoke where they want to and it’s not patrolled. The whole casino smells of smoke and is really off putting."
,,Don’t Bother! House always Wins! Not worth it!!!,1.0,,"We have visited and stayed at the Marina Bay a couple times over the years. One thing we noticed every time we went to casino service got worse, long ques, stupid security check making you feel as if you were a criminal, toilet smelling foul as if it wasn’t cleaned all day and worse of all the slot machines just take your money no payouts at all. We went spent 1500$, 100$ on each machine playing midrange bet and walked out without a single cent in winnings. We must have played on at least 13-14 machines and none even opened a free play or bonus, thus showing us machines are rigged to take and not even give player a chance in getting any money. This kills the fun and with the rude security staff on your way in and out it all adds up to don’t bother going as the house will win anyway and leave you with less money to enjoy on other nice places in Singapore. No entertainment, no free alcohol, and no feeling that you are in a real international casino. Don’t bother going!"
,,nice place to hang out if don't gamble...,5.0,,"they have a shabu-shabu resto for 10 sgd you can have a good meal for 2. drinks are free here, coffe cola, etc. love seeing people playing the jackpot machine. the casino is so big and have 2 storey. smoker are everywhere though. for me its a nice place to hang out even if you don't like gambling. fyi for singaporean must pay 100 sgd for entry levi, so why not come if its for free for tourist..."
,,Casino,4.0,,Nice to check out. I found that there was a lot of security to get compared to other casinos that I had been in. Very big casino with multiple levels.
,,A little disappointed,1.0,,"I was excited to go and try my luck and gamble a little, but to my disappointment they mainly had table games catered for Asian. I wanted to play Texas holdem but there wasn't any. The minimum table amount was $25. Also there wasn't a lounge to just sit and have a drink or two."
,,Good location,3.0,,"So this casino is a great location attached to the hotel and shopping mall. Lots of entrances in from mall , and from outside. Lots of security and for non Singaporeans you must have your passport which is checked at 2 points to go on and also at one point to go out. Did feel that people are very undressed there is no dress code and scruffy shorts and flip flops seem to be common. There are 3 floors but the main 2 are the ground floor which is smoking made up of mainly slot machines but tables in the middle the same goes for the next floor up but that is non smoking. There is also somewhere you can deposit cases and bags which was useful and no charge for this. We went in at least 5 times during our stay and did feel it was short of attendants around the slot machines. Always waited to find one a while. There is free tea and coffee and soft drinks and water. I believe you can order alcoholic beverages although we didn’t. The slot machines vary on minimum and there did seem to be a lot more of the more high end ones. Can get quite crowded. There are also food outlets on both floors we tried fatt Choi expresson the ground floor where u make your own broths which was very good. Nest on the first floor looks good but food was awful. Lots of facilities for cashiers, cash machines , toilets."
,,Huge casino free entry,5.0,,"Casino is huge and has many games. Entry is free via passport. Minimum bet for general games like banker player or sic bo is $25. I think on weekends they increase min bet to $50.

Poker is not live like usual but you need to play against the dealer. I went there quite few times and to santosa casino and made more profits in marina."
,,Huge Casino,3.0,,"I visited the casino with fiends after mid night. Despite the timing, loads of people were there for gambling.

Tbe casiw is really huge and the staff there seems to be very good in handling all kinds of people from different parts of the world.

I did not gamble, but it was interesting to observe people and surrounding."
,,Marina Sands Casino,4.0,,What an amazing view from the tower. Also enjoyed the fireworks display. The BEST chilli crab at the Seafood restaurant - friendly and helpful staff.
,,Passport is must for foreigners...,5.0,,"Very grand casino. .minimum bet is SG$5 in roullet. Lots of table games, slot machines. The casino is spread over 2 levels. Foreigners entry is free with physical Pass Port. Soft drinks, Tea & coffee is free through wending machines also robotic service is done for the distribution. Worth visit even if you loose a few dollars...."
,,Clean and Professional,5.0,,"Clean, Organised and Professionalism is seen on their staffs.
Cold/Hot drinks are available everywhere corner and waitresses will serve also if you are on the roll on the table.

Games options are like KL with an additional or ""Craps"" game.
Security is tight which is good for the patrons."
,,Bring your pocketbook,4.0,,"Overall the casino is really nice. Split into two levels for different games. Free coffee, water and soda from their robotic server. Minimum 25 Singapore Dollar per bet on table games. ATMs and bag check located outside of each entrance. Nice place to gamble if you have a stuffed wallet."
,,Just crazy,5.0,,"I like to gamble but when you don’t like it know problem if it’s a rainy day and you have some time left just visit this casino.
We never had to wait long to get in.
Don’t forget your passport you need it ID cards are not allowed.
If you need some cash you have to leave the casino the ATMs are outside and then you have to give your passport again.
Staff is very friendly and soft drinks are for free.
It’s allowed to smoke in the casino everywhere.
The Chinese are so crazy gambler:) it’s fun to look how they gamble and shout around;)"
,,Worst casino I’ve been too,2.0,,"I can handle the smell of stale cigarette smoke that lingers in the air
I can also handle that the atmosphere here is really dull and you have to show your passport numerous times just to enter.
What I couldn’t handle was the rude demeaning security and staff working today.
I approached a stair access inside the mall where I was approached by a security guard rudely telling me Singapore only, at first I didn’t understand the fella which seemed to upset him even more and repeated himself even more rudely then before so I left. 20mins later I found another entry allowing visitors, the security here were a little friendlier though not helpful. I don’t know if these guys get trained to be so arrogant I’ve never had this problem anywhere else in the world."
,,Casino visit,4.0,,"The best place to play casino. Better than los Vegas. Only foreigners, non residents or non GC holders can enter for free with your passport"
,,I would visit again!,4.0,,Pictures are prohibited inside so I couldn't take any. Its a huge casino with multiple floors. I played poker on the lower ground floor and my dealer was very polite and cooperative. I won 350 SGD also. Overall a good place to visit if you are in Singapore. Entry for foreigners is free but passport is required to be shown at the entrance.
,,You Need Luck Here,5.0,,I went there as i wanted to get the feel how a casino looks like & was sceptical that there will be charges but it was free for tourists you just need to give them the passport for scanning. The casino is Big its a multi storey casino in Marina Bay Sands. But for winning you need luck i lost few bucks here too.. Also one can have a cold drinks like coca cola & pepsi or Mango Juice for Free
,,"As Casinos go, Meh",3.0,,"The casino has an open floor plan and is an immense space. However, to get into the casino, you must queue for a security check which includes showing your passport so they can scan it for information. Why a casino needs your passport to enter is beyond me. Additionally, you must hand it over at the exit as well. Why?

As for the casino, it is massive and there are games for all. The slots were the tightest I have ever seen. Not a friendly place and filled with cigarette smoke."
,,Yes it's a Casino,4.0,,"Not bad for a night out , Busy place with lot's of Punters.
Glad I read here that you need to take your Passport otherwise your not getting in.
Free soft drinks & water was good , It was my Birthday that Day & they gave me a small gift which was a nice touch.
Won enough to cover the night which was good , plenty of Tables & Machines to keep you interested."
,,Racist/Political casino,1.0,,"I went there with my passport but they mentioned that based on company's policy people from Iran not allowed to enter, and they didn't allowed me to enter!
The funny thing is that such a policy not exists in their website,
perhaps they don't want to put this policy publicly to pretend be nice!"
,,Huge but otherwise no draw,3.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Casino was huge spanning multiple floors with nice variety of games. They also offered free non alcoholic drinks. The positives end there for me. They require a passport to get in which we didn’t find out about until we got to the end of the line. The BlackJack minimums were high in my opinion at 25$. I don’t mind dropping some money at a casino and having a good time but 25$ is a little steep per hand. The casino also offered no life, energy or anything else to keep me there. Our wives played two hands of Black Jack and we left."
,,Nice experience,5.0,,"Nice to see when you are in Singapur, great Casino, with many things, tables, automates to play. Big no smoking area, no specially dress code, you can take some drinks and coffee. They also have bar/restaurant inside."
,,It's not a cemetery!,2.0,,Huge open plan casino ....lots of punters. Locals show a pass to get in...whilst foreigners show ID passport. The security checks and queues can be ridiculously over long. Worse of all...the staff who work there look glum and unfriendly. Helpfulness is lacking ...plus some staff on duty do not have answers to questions when asked. Also when assistance is required...there was no one attendant available to assist ..having been told there were 2 on duty ...minding the hundreds of slot machines ......so ..you either have to forego your problems or try to find and chase one down.
,,It's a casino,3.0,,"Opinion will doubtless be based on whether you win or lose! But this casino is friendly. Table limits range from $2.50 upwards depending on what you play. There are plenty of tables. Non smoking is upstairs and was just as busy as downstairs when we went along. There is free tea, coffee and soft drinks. Remember if you are not Singaporean you must show your passport to gain entry and at the exit."
,,Nice. An Huge!,4.0,,"It’s nice. Many many table. 2 floors. Dealers are not as nice as some of the other professional casinos. But it’s a good experience. Entry is free. However, Singapore citizens are charged an entry fee. Do carry your passports, as there is no entry without the passport."
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"Nice Place to visit for weekend escape in town of Singapore, convenience location and surround area many great cafe and Michelin restaurant and upscale shopping mall"
,,Good Casino,4.0,,Good casino - well maintained and friendly staff. Like most Asian casinos there are more table games than slots. Locals have to pay. Free for foreigners. There is a nice shopping complex right outside
,,Reinforced my views of casinos,2.0,,"Cam here for curiosity only, large and soulless but I appreciate that those who like gambling would like the size and the things I don't like"
,,Fantastic Casino,4.0,,"From the moment you enter the casino the atmosphere is on fire. So many things to see and do and you hear the machines going off constantly. I was lucky enough to win nearly $9,000 Singapore dollars on my second press of the slot machine. My partner won $1600 on his 8th press. The drinks ladies come around continuously offering hot and cold beverages for free or you can also order alcohol, or drink of choice, through them.
WARNING for all foreigners, you MUST have your passport on you to enter this casino and to exit it also.
Smoking is fully allowed at Marina Bay Sands so be prepared for a VERY smoky atmosphere.
Real downside I did find was lack of restaurants unless you want to navigate the security to go out of the casino. There is one Chinese cuisine restaurant on the bottom floor that was pleasant and had great food for a decent price.
DO NOT TAKE PHOTOS IN THE CASINO OR YOU CAN BE ARRESTED!!!"
,,Bleah,3.0,,"OK, so the main floor is huge. there's another level up that's smaller but is non-smoking. there are actually another 2 levels up for VIPs. The main floor is full of characters you'd expect to see at a casino. let's just say you need to expect to rub shoulders with them if you want to be at a casino. the big issue I had is with the floor managers and dealers. they all looked really upset to be at this job. no one really bothers with your rating card or give you an accurate rating. the dealers just want to get through their shift and could care less about your experience. so don't expect any classy fun to be had at the casino, it's pretty much a prettied up back alley gambling joint."
,,Ample gamble!,5.0,,"One of the biggest casinos in Asia and perhaps the only casino in Singapore , the other being in sentosa (resortsworld).the entry fee for the Singapore nationals is 100 sgd while it is free for the foreigners. (Showing the passport is mandatory for free entry)"
,,Visit during F1 race week,4.0,,Well worth a visit. Huge gaming area with majority of tables open all the time. Great friendly staff. Just needs a sports bar. Need your passport if you are from overseas.
,,poor casino,2.0,,forget this place. Security is over the top. Passport checked at entrance and again at exit. Singapore is becoming too much like China.
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Went to marina bay casino really enjoyed the experience , friendly staff & cleanliness. Had to show passport quit a few times but overall felt very safe & welcomed in a great enviroment"
,,Fun place,5.0,,"It can get very smokey, but a bunch of games and fun for everyone over 21! If you are a foreigner I think you need your passport to get into the casino and I know you need it to get out. Heavy security near the entrance, but other than that a good time at this casino"
,,A Dreamed Property.....,5.0,,It's a dream property for all the people who loves to enjoy luxurious life style. I was lucky enough to visit this place and the concept of architecture is Amazing! The facilities and ambiance are upto the mark. It's a must visit spot when travelling in Singapore.
,,"Lost, Won, Lost, Won , Lost Lost happily Lost !!!!",4.0,,"An amazing experience you must have on your visit to singapore, Just go on the concept of entertainment, You may lose or you may won. But an experience to have !!! had a gala time."
,,Visiting,5.0,,Top end casino in a safe beautiful environment; free entry for foreign visitors but costs $100 for locals. Frequently visited by our friends from overseas.
,,Thank You,5.0,,"I will warn the reader, this review is likely to be bias as I am overjoyed right now!

So it is a large casino, 2 main floors. Ground is smoking, 1st floor is non-smoking.

I had never been to a casino before this, so I cannot really compare.

However, I found the atmosphere very pleasing and the staff to be friendly and helpful.

Free entry for foreigners (100 Singapore dollars without passport)

Thoroughly enjoyed myself whilst winning a good amount of money!"
,,This is not a destination unless you want to gamble,1.0,,"Finding the Casino on the tourist map we foolishly thought it was as much a tourist thing to see as it was a working Casino.

Wrong. It is just a working Casino. If that is what you are after then I am sure its great. But if you are thinking of going for a sightseeing look, dont."
,,Well designed Casino,5.0,,"My friend took me for lunch to this Casino.
Must have your passport to be able to gain entry.
Once inside go and sign up for the member card.
Good range of restaurants for lunch or dinner.
We tried the chinese fare and peking duck was todays choice.
A fairly modern casino with slot machines and all the usual gambling tables.
Quite a friendly mix of people out for a day out also the serious betting types.
Was surprised the amount of self service vending machines around the place offering complimentary coffee tea soft drinks and waters.
Dont forget to use your member card when gambling and gamble responsibly.
Had a very enjoyable day out here."
,,"Avoid , only go for once to see and that's it",4.0,,"As in any other Casino, avoid it, odds are that you will lose your money. It's well maintained by the way with lower floor for smokers and upper floor non smoking.
Location is convenient inside Marina Bay Sands.
They provide free drinks (Non alcoholic) to keep you busy."
,,One of the most amazing casinos of Asia,5.0,,"The Casino at MBS is a great fun for casino lovers! The casino floor is huge and it's split into two levels!! Staff is very helpful and organised.
Casino offers wide range of slot machines n tables, you don't have to await your turn ;).

They don't do complimentary alcohol, but they do complimentary coffee for sure, lol. The interiors are very classy n uptown, no doubt it's a part of Marina Bay Sands! Highly recommend it to all the people who enjoy casinos"
,,Ok for a casino. Good for an Asian casino,3.0,,"It's not Vegas and the table limits are high. It's better than most Macau casinos and other casinos around Asia. Minimum Black Jack bet is 25 SGD. I personally like to play for fun with smaller bets. Korean casinos have about 10 USD bet minimum. Macau is about 40 USD, so Singapore is in the middle."
,,If you like casinos this is worth visiting,5.0,,A huge though very attractive gaming floor (though most of it is smoking there is a non-smoking area on the first floor). A fun place (if you like gambling) to spend an hour or two.
,,just take a stroll if you dont have the money/expertize,5.0,,"Its free for the foreign nationals to enter, on showing their passport. I didnt know how to play, so I just took a stroll and had free milo !!! But the whole place was beautiful, it located in the Marina Bay Sands hotel."
,,Superb experience!,5.0,,"Its a must visit for a wonderful experience! So many machines plays, table plays, the ambience, the space everything is just superb! Go for a experience to play in limits :). Photography not allowed inside the casino! Take out time later to stroll in the mall too - has some wonderful eateries and shopping varieties!"
,,This place is big,4.0,,"If you're in the area it's worth stopping by the casino just to take a look. Has a wide open space on two floors and you can really feel your the size. It's hard for me to believe that there would be a time when all these tables would be full. Many of the games are very complex from an American Standard.

You will need passports to get in and get out."
,,Not beginner friendly!,3.0,,"We visited the Casino for a fun night of low stakes bets as none of my small group (we were 3 women) know what we are doing. We fancied some roulette and Blackjack/ Pontoon. You need to take your passport with you to enter (and exit) and we didn't pay anything to enter.

The casino is a vast space so we ordered some drinks and we had a wander around to attempt to see where we would be best to start off. There is smoking throughout the casino and many people do partake so its a pretty smoky atmosphere.

We found a roulette table with no-one else sat that had a S$10 minimum bet and asked the guy to tell us what we needed to do....he didn't tell us and kind of barked orders when I did something wrong (I put a s$10 chip on the odds section and he shouted 'FIFTY') I guess people who have been to casinos before know this kind of thing, but as I said I am a complete amateur. We sat for a couple of hands (is that the right terminology?!!) and then some other punters came over and started betting hundreds if not thousands of dollars at a time. Made me feel completely out of my depth and didn't find it fun at all.

Maybe my expectation was an overly romanticized movie version of casino's, but I found it unwelcoming and frankly quite dull!!! Maybe if I was with a bigger group of my own friends (and dare I say a mixed group) it would have been better but I wouldn't visit again."
,,Table limits are too high,3.0,,"Free soft drink and water , but the table limits are really high compared to other casinos around the world. Eg minimum bets for blackjack start at $25. Plus, what is with the smoking indoors?"
,,A fun time,4.0,,A fool and his money is soon departed. Watched one guy playing blackjack covering eight (8) plays at $S200 Singapore a pop. The casino was winning.
,,Worth a look,4.0,,A huge casino over two floors offers a large number of tables and machines. The smokey environment can be bothersome. As a foreigner there is no fee to enter but you do need to show your passport on entry and exit. Food options are very limited.
,,Gambles Paradice,5.0,,No entry fees for foreigners. I love the non Smoking areas as usually I get annoyed by all the smoking in casinos. Nice selection of games. Great fun for an evening in Singapore.
,,Interesting,5.0,,"Gambler or not, just go in. No charges for foreigners and it was absolutely an amazing place. Drinks were provided and those machine was really updated. Staff was really helpful and if got chance, just go, dont miss it out."
,,Must visit Place,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore , must visit place ... surprisingly no ent4ry fee for foreigners , just we have to carry our passport ,, lost of option to try our luck..."
,,Not for everyone,3.0,,"If you don't plan to gamble this place probably isn't for you, we had to show our passports entering and LEAVING the casino, you need to check in backpacks etc but they made us take bottle of water with us

Coming in was quite nice but when you are on the floor it's filled with cigarette smoke and the players push you out of the way to put a bet down"
,,great casino,4.0,,"this is a big casino, 2 floors. for foreigners, you need to show your password to enter the casino. you can smoke inside the casino. soft drinks are flowing, but no food."
,,Wonderfull place,5.0,,"Really good views from the top, would b good if we could swim at the top bt u have to b a staying guest"
,,Disappointed,2.0,,"Was all excited to spend the evening at the casino & was disappointed .
So needed passport to enter, no big deal. As soon as we walked in the smell of cigarette smoke it you in the face. They allow smoking in designated areas of the casino. Again not a problem to some, personally I found it off putting.
Comparing this casino to others it felt like it had no vibe. Left within an hour.
Could not see anywhere to eat inside, you could go out of the casino into Marina Bay to grab a bite. You would need to line up again to show your passport."
,,"Bad vibe, no free drinks",2.0,,"This casino has a very bad vibe, too many compulsive gamblers thinking they are going to hit the big jackpot. You must pay for drinks even if gambling, unlike in Las Vegas where free drinks are common for gamblers."
,,Huge but less options,3.0,,"This place is huge but the options are limited to Baccarat, Roulette and Slot machines. They do not have poker tables and very limited blackjack tables. The place is very huge and the management is good. I wasn't too excited about this place though."
,,Big casino,4.0,,"I dont gambling just walk around, the casino is very big and wide, many type of gambling game can be found here"
,,Big one. Play yourself or watch others,4.0,,"Its a very big one and a lot of different tables. You can play yourself, watch friends do it or watch other doing it. No entrance fee. Passport required"
,,Wouldn't go back,2.0,,"Worst casino I have ever been to. Coming from Australia I have been to crown casino many times. We have also travelled to Las Vegas and been to several casino's there. This casino is very quiet and only for serious gamblers. Unfortunately it isn't like a casino in Australia or Las Vegas where there is people drinking and bars ect spread thougout, everyone was very serious, so if that's what your after you will enjoy. I wouldn't go back. If you do go ensure you take your passport as a tourist you need it to get in. Without it they will charge you $100 entry."
,,"We had fun, we lost our money",4.0,,Here is something for everyone. From small tables to the really big is everything here what the player heart desires. You can also have fun with small amounts. It can be smoked everywhere. The drinks are free.
,,Enjoyed @casino,5.0,,"Visited marina bay sands casino with friend , was really big casino and one thing please take ur passport along with u ,its compulsory for foreigners to show passport for entry to casino. Was really big casino with lots of men , womens playing .one must visit this place"
,,"great place to mingle, play and while the hours away",5.0,,"What a classic, epic place this is! Never miss the chance to go here! Whether it's roulette or slots you will play your fill! Free coffee, soft drinks, water, great ambience. Some minor hang-ups: security is way too tight, they trear you like they're looking for Carlos the Jackal or something, made me wait 5 minutes while they looked thru my pasort, whispering cryptic messages into a walkie-talkie; no sound on slots! I won a big payout and no sound at all! No coins shooting out no fireworks, nothing. What gives? Otherwise, great experience!!!"
,,Singapore Travel 2016,5.0,,One of the highlights of our travel. Very near the center of Singapore. It's an amazing place. I enjoyed it with my sister.
,,Very big fancy casino,4.0,,"Huge fancy casino, free entrance for foreigners but you need your passport to enter (locals have to pay I think). The staff its not very friendly, people playing are mostly chinese, also you cant take pics once inside! 😁"
,,Giant gaming floor,3.0,,"Its a subpar experience compared to las vegas. poor slot choices, average rtp, table games sometimes have strange rules. Difficult to find blackjack tables, and my main problem, they use automatic shoe shuffler, which is no good for blackjack. But during the hot hours of Singapore sun, its nice to refresh and gamble a bit."
,,Not worth the effort,2.0,,Had heard it wa spectacular but i found it too smokey as smoking is the norm and nothing special. Had a meal which was okay but wouldn't recommend it.
,,Good place for overseas visitors to win! Have seen them winning!,4.0,,"Marina Bay Casino is very good and kind to visitors. Let me explain.
1. Easy access: by mass rail transit. Clean.fast efficient at Bayfront Station. Or Take Taxi.
2. Luggage: leave at counter at casino entrance. Free. However, no plastic bag of food.
3. Passport: foreigners must bring passport. Singaporeans must pay Sing $100 for 24 hours. Strict. Check for authencity. Will fine you if you use fake I.D.
4. Two Floors: lower floor, smoking. Can be quite bad for your clothes and lungs. Do not understand why they ban smoking in all indoors in buildings in Singapore, but here they chain smoke. If you sit next to smoker, good luck yo your lungs. Second floor: smoke free area, but less tables and slot machines about the same.
5. All kinds of table games: baccarat, 5 card poker, 3 card poker, Texas holder, black jack, etc. Also localized poker games. Crap.
Slot machines: 2 cents, 5, 10 and 20 cents. Fafafa slot machines most popular, with tai Sai or big small. Many Bangladeshi, Indians and locals play this.
6. Higher floors: restricted entry, higher stake table games and 50 cents and $1 slots. Higher denomination for higher grade players.
7. Lucky draws on weekends and public holidays.
8. Have noted that foreign visitors have good luck:
- a Mr Singh won more than S$70,000 on slots
- a Taiwanese won $25,000 on 3-card poker
- baccarat players are big winners
9. Note that once win you should stop. Have witnessed those who won $10,000 or more lose all as they continue playing slot machines.
10. Drinks: cold and hot drinks freely available, Beer free at premium play areas.
11. Food is most reasonable in restaurants in casino. No children allowed.

I wish they have smoking room or areas in Bay Casino like in Casinos in Macau. The players and workers therefore have clean environment and safer medical health clean air. In the long term, some worker or long term visitor will sue the government for allowing smoke induced illness like lung cancer. I like the Macau arrangement where smokers are controlled in smoking rooms. The air quality is superb, no more smelly hair, shirts on leaving the casino.

Overall good environment, except for the air quality."
,,Worth a visit - if just for the experience!,4.0,,"During our 10 day business trip to Houston, I wanted to stop by and see this casino. I love to play blackjack in Las Vegas and was curious what a casino in Singapore would look like. I had been warned to take my passport to get in. Passports are required because the Singapore government does not want their residents to get addicted to gambling so have different requirements for visitors versus residents. Unlike Vegas casinos, all visitors are required to show their passport (which Casino Security will scrutinize heavily on the way in AND the way out) to prove they are a visitor / non resident) or pay $100 Singapore to get in. Although the casino is quite large, there were few blackjack table (hard to find) and the minimum bet for those was $20 Singapore. One nice perk is that you can get complimentary self serve soft drinks from the fountain (no ice). We didn't place any bets, but it was interesting to see the casino. There are multiple ways to access the casino. We were did it from the outside and got a bit lost. It seemed easier from the mall."
,,fantastic casino,5.0,,"Huge with a lot of choice in both table games and slotmachines. Many jackpots to win and because there are so many players , these can go up to millions of dollars. Everything well organised, remember take your passport and immigration paper as this will be checked. Open 24 hours and free entrance for foreigners. Free coffee, tea, milo ,water and softdrinks . When you are not a player still a great place to visit once!"
,,Easy to win and lose,4.0,,"Security is very tight and so racist for some poor country nations. (I don't want to mention which nations). Stress starts from bag deposits. Stuffs are so rude. Security men also check Passport again and again and sometimes forbid to enter if we cannot answer passport number by heart. I give you advice not to bring any items except a wallet or money because security is really tight especially on night times. But the good thing is that there are a lot of loose slot machine and you can find which one is loose machine if you have experiences on slot machines. You can win money very easily but if you are greedy, you will lose all winning money. Loose slot machine sometimes give you 2 times amount of your initial deposit. Please stop it, or you will lose if continue play. Don't play only on one game. Once you win on one machine, move on other machine. If possible, don't use member card on slot machines."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Passport required to enter the casino, plenty of tables and machines that start at the usual 1c to $1.00 Didn't play the tables but saw plenty of winnings, pay out on poker machines seemed better than Melbourne both my husband and I walked out with a sizable win. Plenty of free drink services and a dedicated smoking area at the tables and machines. As always gamble responsibly"
,,A joke,1.0,,"Singapore in general has way to many rules it's pathetic .
This place denied me entry once for sandals and another time for a sleeveless shirt.
Than they parade you through security like your some kind of animal checking your passport 6 times.
Once inside it's just another casino, except the table minimums are are $100."
,,Better than the other one,4.0,,"There are 2 casinos in Singapore. This one is right downtown, although Singapore is so small, it doesn't really matter and they have an extensive subway system. I went to both but recommend this one as the staff seem more friendly and there are more options for non casino things to do. Also there is no charge for being forced to store your bag here. When we went it was quite busy because of the holidays but they even had someone at the subway gate to help with taking the best route to your destination. Nice touch."
,,Beautiful casino,4.0,,"The casino is a part of the Marina Bay shopping mall. Bring your passports as foreigners have free entry. Casino is beautiful with a huge ground floor for smokers and smaller 2nd floor for non-smokers. Air ventilation was very good as I did not smell any smoke on 2nd floor. A nice touch is the self serve free hot and cold drinks at every corner; love the hot soy drink and pulled tea (Tareh?). There are many different table games and slot machines. There are some continuous shuffle blackjack and pontoon (almost same as BJ) tables with minimum of $25SD (or about $20USD); rules are slightly different as there is no hold (or down) dealer card; dealer hits soft 17; player is paid immediately after natural BJ (or Pontoon) at 3:2 or multiple card 21 at 1:1, and other people can also bet on your hand. Again, I really liked the self serve free drinks. Pretty cool casino."
,,Mindblowing ; can't imagine the scale until you are in,5.0,,Its a must go place. The experience is beyond imagination. There is no entry fee for foreigners. Its advisable not to carry anything other than ladies purse. There is baggage counter but there is always a long queue. Its not necessary to play if you are inside. a must experience place.
,,Great place to relax but you need to bring much more money,4.0,,"I visited here in holiday, supprise because it's very very big place and so much people with lots of games and game machines. It's the first time went to Large casino and unfortunately i saw only. Bring much money if you want to try. Casino welcome foreign customers and remind you can't take pic"
,,no locals,5.0,,the place is alway's crowed & if you have locals people you know don't take them with you as they will charge $S50 to let them go inside the casino beware as we where told by a local that we know
,,High Roller,5.0,,"The Casino is located within Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall. Locals pay a fee for entry, but with foreign visitors it is free but you need to bring your passport for entry. The Casino is big and there are several floors of tables, so you'll find your game table somewhere. Go at night and enjoy the city view at night along the Marina Bay just outside and you can also combine this visit to Gardens by the Bay which isn't far away which is much nicer at night (walking distance)."
,,Not as good as I expected,3.0,,"I've only spent gambling time at Sydney's Star Casino, Melbourne's Crown and plenty in Macau. This is crap compared to them so I was disappointed. Quite small and not a good set out. Spent ages trying to look for the blackjack table. Everyone is really serious and smokes at the tables. No one looks like theyre having fun lol. Bar is also tiny. Compliementary tea and water was good. Security is really tight for foreigners - bring your passport not drivers licence. Need to stow away backpacks too"
,,Somewhere to go if you're tired of sightseeing,3.0,,The casino at the Marina Bay Sands closes early so don't plan on any late night gambling sessions. The casino is clean and has a nice atmosphere but isn't memorable when compared to other casinos around the world.
,,Must visit for those who like a punt.,4.0,,"I've visited Casinos in Vegas, Australia and no Singapore. The Marina Bay Sands Casino is a must for those wanting to try their luck. The downside to this Casino was the extreme security to get in. I think it more applied to locals due to laws. But it does mean you may have to wait a while just to get in. On the plus side, the atmosphere is great, and the establishment provides free hot drinks and soft drinks for patrons."
,,Casual sunday,5.0,,"Free tea, coffee, milo and an array of soft drinks, juice and water. Not too crowded on a Sunday which was good. Able to wear casual attire on a Sunday which was even better, for a relaxed feel. Staff are wonderful"
,,Just another casino with tight security but...,2.0,,"To me, another plain casino with super tight security especially exit from the casino. Really? Checking page by page my passport. Wondering what they were looking for? Anyhow, free bottomless drinks like milo, coffee and water bottle really appreciated it. Good for shoestring travellers :)"
,,Compared to VEGAS very disappointing slots,2.0,,Normally do a VEGAS for the slots. I think the Asian market is different as the slots are not as much fun compared to the USA. Doubt I'll return next time
,,The best of SG,5.0,,Marina Bay sands casino is really amazing place to visit. The casino is really well built and well maintained. It's one of the best casinos in the world. There is no entry fee for visitors just you need to show your passport to take entry in the casino.
,,WOW ! First Time Ever,4.0,,"This was my first time ever in a casino, this is free for foreigner so took a chance when i got the time. The place is exactly you see a casino on TV, lot of things going on, can be confusing if dont follow the casino games, but the atmosphere is grand,bustling definitely a must visit for the experience."
,,Casino,5.0,,"I have visit Singapore 5 times now and recently this is the first time I have entered the Casino due to not having my boys with us this time. Was very interesting, worth just looking even if you do not gamble."
,,Huge,4.0,,The casino is huge but obviously nothing as compared to your experiences in Macau . If you are a casino Lover its a good option
,,Casino and Shopping experience.,5.0,,"I visited Casino, it's awesome. Food taste is good. Water , and soft drinks are free of cost. If we are visiting casino for first time we need a guide for choosing the game and how to play. if the casino provides guide for at least for foreign tourists it will be awesome."
,,Ginormous,4.0,,All I can say is everything is dry Normas at the Marina Bay Sands Casino. You can spend days exploring the shops and eateries. It's an amazing treat for all your senses.
,,Worst security check point ever!,1.0,,"The casino (as all other casinos around the world do) has an ID/security checkpoint at entry. The sign is clearly marked with the acceptable forms of ID i.e. Passport or some form of national ID which covers the standard ID requirements. When I presented the power hungry incompetent security guard a national ID which is clearly legible and contains all ID requirements including photograph I was quickly pushed out of line while he repeated ""passport only, passport only!"" Disgusting behaviour, never again!"
,,Overcrowded,3.0,,"Far too busy for my liking. Not a patch on any casino I've visited in Vegas. Take your passport for ID and to get in for free. Not really much happening though, I'll give it a miss next time."
,,In a word...horrible!,1.0,,"Must be the worst casino in the world....boring, zero atmosphere, absolutely nothing to create even the semblance of an enjoyable customer experience. Never going back!"
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"First trip to Singapore, so I thought a trip to the ""spectacular"" Marina Bay Sands was in order. Not a gambler myself but love checking out casinos around the place. I knew there was a strict security process involved in obtaining entry, but this was something else. After three passport checks, the 2nd one being very strict where the security guard examined our passports like nothing I've seen before. I got through customs at Changi and even in the Middle East with out as much as a pause. I though wow, this casino, must be awesome, gold and diamonds everywhere or something similar. Very disappointing. Very bland and dull, full of smoke and miserable looking staff and gamblers alike. No atmosphere. Needless to say we had a look around and left. Unless your a gambler, definitely not worth the time, which is unfortunate."
,,Not your typical Vegas Casino!,5.0,,Different offering of games versus a Vegas casino. Naturally a heavy asian influence in the games. Offers a non-smoking floor and don't forget your passport for entry.
,,"MARINA BAY SANDS CASINO, SINGAPORE",3.0,,"This is one of the two casinos in Singapore. The casino is housed in the iconic SANDS HOTEL and in the city center. Location while it is more easy to reach as compare to the other casino; with MRT. BUSES. Taxis aplenty. The casino is operated by the US SANDS GROUP, which has presence in Las Vegas, and big way in Macao. The size of the casino is not that large as compare to other casinos in the region. Most of the games are available here; but the size is small. Surprise that the casino still has DOUBLE ZEROS (00) for the low end of the Roulette tables. This gives the casino a better ODD over the players!!! Nothing too exiting about this casino; except it is one of the only two casinos in Singapore; while one can go for a fling !!!"
,,Just wonder why,5.0,,"Iam not a gambler but my friend and family drop by here, i just watch people playing, sitting in a corner of coffee shop and listening the soft classical music and on the other side a band playing music live, can make a request for what music you want them to sing."
,,Must be the Worst Casino In the World,1.0,,"This casino billows with smoke haze, It requires both entry and exit for tourists by the use of passport--why exiting requires the same difficult procedure one does not know. There is no where to sit and have a drink. There is no area where music is played. You need to queue to cash your money in whereas the Sentosa Casino has money refunding machines. The dress standards are non-existent and don't take your pretty wife there especially if she is nicely dressed as the predominately Asian men will visionally undress her. Give this casino at Marina Bay a wide berth"
,,Glitzy as expected,3.0,,"Take your passport and wear appropriate clothing and footwear if you want to gain entry. The casino is expansive covering several floors. It amazed us to see so many tables with patrons playing within the Minimum $50 to Maximum $500,000 limits PER BET. There were other lower stakes tables about starting at$2.50, but this was definately a high roller establishment. Not being gamblers ourselves we took in the grandeur and then headed to ""The Nest"", a small Chinese food restaurant overlooking the gaming. Food and service were excellent."
,,Low payout......don't bother!,3.0,,"Disappointed with the positioning of the slot machines , most of them located on the ground floor where there is a smoking area . However this does not stop the smoke from permeating throughout the floor area and can be quite discomforting for non smoking punters.
The slot attendants aren't terribly helpful nor smiling or cheerful. Unlike other global casinos this particular one is worth one visit to compare ."
,,"Maybe ideal for high rollers, but that's not us.",1.0,,We are slots lovers who enjoy a few hours on a day in the casinos of the US and Malaysia . . . but we were shocked and dismayed by the high minimums and the rare returns at the one-armed bandits at this casino. In thirty minutes we had lost our sworn allowance and departed. Never again.
,,Better than expected,4.0,,"Went to the Casino after reading previous reviews about dress standard for men being long trousers and closed in shoes. On entering there are men wearing shorts and thongs, not sure if it was because it was during the day. Besides that we found the top floor to be smoke free which was a blessing and nicely presented with free tea, coffee and water. It is a small casino nothing like Vegas but still great. Went to the bottom floor and it has non smoking designated areas so it wasn't too bad. thoroughly enjoyed it and left with some extra spending money to top it off."
,,A bit of gambling,5.0,,"One of two casino that available is Singapore. This is the biggest compare to the other one. Huge gambling area. Free water, soft-drinks and coffee or tea tarik. Smoking area also not too smoky. Did not manage to get jackpot, but surely had a lot of fun"
,,Old Vegas for better or worse,3.0,,"The Sands casino at Marina Bay captures old Vegas in a number of ways. First there is the exclusivity. If you're a local, you have to pay a hefty price for entry, but a tourist can wave their passport and enter a world of gambling closed for many of the people who live on the island.

Then again, you are also allowed to smoke in the downstairs area of the casino, just like in the bad old days. Forget American smokes, a lot of the patrons are Asians with their own brands of cigarettes, which are strong stuff to say the least. If you venture downstairs even for a moment, you will need to air out and preferably wash your clothes afterwards.

Unfortunately the glamour of old Vegas isn't quite there and the casino has a somehow drab feeling to itself, which is odd considering the price range. The games are aimed more towards the high end customer, and if you want to play poker, you better be down for 25 dollar antes, and that's the low end.

Having frequented casinos on three continents now, the Singapore Sands is probably my least favorite. It's fine for taking a peek inside, but you probably shouldn't expect to make a night of it."
,,Maximum rudeness,1.0,,"As a foreigner trying to go inside this casino is a challenge. You need to show your passport which is ok i guess. But once you hit the queue for foreigners you need to show your passport to one guy and then in about 5 meters later in the same queue you need to show your passport again to a nasty character that checks every page and makes you feel like criminal. I am supposed to be the guest that should be greeted nicely with a smile ?????

Once you are in if you want to eat in some of the eateries you can visually see you need to exit the casino and be subjected to the same routine !!!!!!

And then to add insult to injury when you are actually leaving you are subjected to the same passport check ???? What are they going to do refuse exit ???

As a summary its not a pleasant experience and I don't recommend to anyone."
,,First Casino Visit,4.0,,"I have never been to casino before and was astonished to see the luxury here. You can imagine the picture of Las Vegas Casinos and this one is none the less. You need to carry your passport to get a 'free' entry here. Mind it, Singapore locals have to pay for entry :))) . You can also pickup cold drinks, coffee and other drinks from vending machines... and the are 'free' again. Get on to a playing table and enjoy."
,,Big winners.,5.0,,Had a great night full of fun and we all won. Only played the machines. Massive place. Don't forget your passport if you want to get in and the white tab they leave in your passport that is stamped.
,,Opulent Casino With Great Array Of Table Games & Slots,5.0,,"If you are a foreigner, you are entitled to enter into the casino for free. This is a real gamblers' place, the place is packed and very well-organised with lots of patrons. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Cool place,5.0,,"Get the players card. They have tables and slots! Many different table games. There is a second floor with slots and tables, no smoking on second floor!!"
,,The Best Casino,5.0,,"This is a great casino. I have been in many casino's and this MBS treat their Guest very special. They give me free room every month. We can have free coffee, cold drinks and bottle water for all !!! free.

Smoking and non Smoking floor.

Little bit problem is the entrance .. the security sometimes over acting checked the passport like immigration officer .. make me upset especially when i am loosed and need to go to ATM machine and then go back queing the entrance .. LoL"
,,Dine on the main Casino floor at the Fatt Choi Express restaurant.,4.0,,"This restaurant is located on the main gaming floor (B2) - had lunch here today while I visited the casino. Access to the casino is via passport for foreigners and payment of a $100 fee for local Singaporeans.

It is open 24/7 and has a few food options - I had the steamboat to cook at the table.
The choice was three vegetables and two meat plus noodles to add to the soup - also selected the spicy soup base.

The meal is self cooked in a pot over a flame on the table, add the cooked ingredients to your bowl then ladle into a bowl to enjoy.

It was a nice meal, really good value at $13.80 - even cheaper for members."
,,Just a Casino,3.0,,"This casino is large, but not comparable to US casinos. For me it seemed very crowed and too many tables and machines for the space available. For me there was no special atmosphere, which you get in good casinos.
You can get free no alcoholic drinks at self service counters. The passport control at the entrance is a little bit annoying. Non Singapore residents don’t have to pay entrance fee."
,,Not as exciting as i expected at the casino,3.0,,"Not particularly spectacular. Lots of tables cramped in. Was eager to play the tables, for black jack, to expensive just for fun, $25 a go. I stuck to the roulette and enjoyed that. A member of our party did really well, but you need to take risks and i couldn't
You had to be seated at a table to be able to order drinks. There was no where to go to a bar, ensuring you stay at the table and spend. Much better things to do in singapore."
,,Free Drinks and Typical Casino Games and Machines,2.0,,"This is a simple casino located at the Marina Bay Sands. It has the typical casino games and machines.

Provide free hot drinks, soft drinks and drinking water. Smoking allowed within the venue.

Tourists can access the casino without the $100 levy that applies to permanent residents or citizens.

Beside the free drinks, it is a boring casino from my perspective."
,,Gambling in Singapore,3.0,,"The casino is huge and it has a lot of tables and slot machines. Betting goes from 0.40 Singapore Dollars and up. Compared to Las Vegas, it is not as exciting. Ground floor is the smoking area, while the first floor is non-smoking (and you do not smell the smoke from downstairs). You get free coffee and tea, as well as soft drinks. Alcohol is expensive - we asked for the price (beer is 12 Singapore Dollars a pint). There is no food at the tables or slot machines. A couple of places sell snacks and there are several restaurants - inexpensive and the food was good."
,,Megalink Jackpot,5.0,,"Megalink Jackpot on all 3(Stud Poker, 3 Card Poker and Texas Holdem), guarantee a big payout whenever you strike it. Friendly and helpful staff. Well situated in the marina bay district and easily accessible by MRT."
,,Excellent place for Casino lovers.,5.0,,"The lower level is for smokers and offers large number of tables for roulette and other games and also slots. It has a food court which offers a limited menu, vegetarians will find it difficult to get anything to eat here. The upper level is non smoking and has a huge variety of slot machines. Amazing place where you can serve yourself free drinks or wait for an attendant to pass by with the drinks trolley( no hard drinks)."
,,"""No"" Limit Texas Hold Em",2.0,,"As part of the Vegas holding company for both Palazzo and Venetian I visited this casino with grand expectations. Most games cater to the Far Eastern Asian crowd and that was alright. No sports book and I was still not dissuaded from enjoying the experience. However, the ultimate letdown was that they didn't have a single Texas Hold Em table. Big disappointment for a casino this spacious. Not worth another visit."
,,what a great casino,5.0,,what a great casino this is i have been in many casino's and i come from the Gold coast in Australia and some one from the casino at the Gold coast needs to see how inviting this casino is and how its run..free coffee cold drinks (not out of a vending machine ) and bottle water for all !!! free.
,,What an experience!,4.0,,"Beautiful layout. I love that there are smoking and non smoking floors. Although, if you are a pro in the casino, I've heard that this place might be really small in comparison. Spend enough and get invited to a separate area! My dad got invited after hours of playing but we decided not to go as we wanted to stay as a family and him in a wheelchair might not have been too convenient.

I'm honestly not much of a gambler but I really wanted to experience it a tiny bit. I'm no good at table games so I'll leave that out.

Slots are my favourite. I get to have hot coffee, tea or chocolate serve by pretty ladies with carts while I play. My favourite is the pirates.

Generous variety of complimentary hot and soft drinks available and tea as well. Not forgetting bottles of water too. The area is well lit. Restaurants in the casino are pretty expensive.

MONEY SAVER TIP! But if you get the free membership card and use that in and out of the casino and around the malls, don't forget to use your points to pay for your food! The BBQ pork rice (char siew rice) expensive as heck but so good!
If you're really crunch on cash, save your money on the over priced drinks while you eat. Either grab a bottle of complimentary water with you or have the complimentary drinks after your meal!

Foreigners enter for free but Singaporeans have to pay a hefty entrance free.

Don't forget to cash out your vouchers before your leave. Every cent counts! Have fun and godspeed!"
,,Marina Bay Sands Casino,4.0,,When visiting Singapore you don't want to miss Marina Bay and the Financial District. The grand hotel overlooking the bay is The Sands Hotel of Las Vegas fame and is every bit extravagant as you will find in SE Asia. The Casino downstairs is the icing on the cake. Bring your passport and skip the $100 entry fee. Dress nice to not feel out of place here and enjoy the gaming. The table games and slots are mostly the same as what you'll find on the LV Strip but the patrons here are more of what you would expect to find in Monaco. (there is a dress code here). The ATM's are outside of the Casino and you have to re-enter every time you need to top up so bring lot's of cash. The games pay better in Las Vegas in my opinion but it's well worth a visit or two and the shopping outside is a great place to spend big money.
,,Generally very unfriendly environment,2.0,,"This place is accessible by locals at $100/day pay or by purchase of annual ticket at S$2k price. I could understand why girl at the entrance was staring at me and my passport much longer than at Changi Airport passport control. However I can't understand why this procedure is repeated when you go out.
Smoking is permitted in the casino which makes the atmosphere stinky. If somebody decides to sit next to you and blow smoke in your direction, you can't do much except of going somewhere else."
,,One of the world's best Casino,5.0,,"If you got good amount of time and interested in gambling, you must try this casino. This is considered to be world's largest casino after Las Vegas (I am not sure)"
,,Great casino,5.0,,It's a great casino to have some fun small they have a smoking and a non smoking levels and water is free. Also the resturants was good as well
,,Massive,5.0,,"Biggest casino I have ever experienced. Huge smoking section, free coffee, tea, soft drinks all over. Free to foreigners and you can dress casual. Many tables and machines o chaos from, no queues, very relaxed atmosphere"
,,A minimalist Visits the Casino,5.0,,"One of a place with your fate laughing at one of those boards/tables. Good that I had a friend who flanked by my side and explained the rules of the House. We did try our luck (Roulette precisely) and just made it even. Free flowing non-alcoholic beverages on offer, just in case you want to be a mute spectator.

Have fun, Gamble safely and don't end up being on the losing side....Cheers!"
,,First time experience,5.0,,"Finally got a life time experience of a well renowned casino in the world the sands group. The Ambiance is superb and very spacious, best thing their is no entry charges and offer complimentary beverages. Lots of games like black jack, roulette etc. actually i got my hands on this two games only. rest no idea how to play. play wisely... see you then !!"
,,"I like the architectural design, it contributes to the character of the City of singapore",4.0,,"We took photos here, the Marina NBay Sands Casino as the backdrop. We entered the big spacious building and yes, the expanse of the place is real huge. Architectural design is fantastic from their connecting walkways and and the big spacious hotel. The view outside as it stands to become part of Singapore'slandscape is truly amazing. Three tall buildings , on top is a boatlike structure that is a swimming pool. Just cool!!"
,,Quite an awe inspiring experience !,5.0,,"We went to the casino on our second day of our holiday , and were immediately stunned by the breath taking interior design .
It's a shame that photographs aren't allowed inside , because it's truly a beautifully designed oasis .
The staff were friendly and security did a exceptional job.
There are an excellent selection of gaming machines for everyone , and the complementary drinks are very considerate to the happiness of the gaming audience .
Even the seating by each gaming machine is extra soft and comfortable for long term playing .
The shopping centre offers some extravagant high end options to purchase from many of the names we all know from lovers of fine taste , and the food court offers dining of all tastes and budgets ."
,,Huge casino,5.0,,Various kinds of card games. Free drinks and most of all grab $5k winning after struggling for 8 hrs of non stop playing.
,,Good fun,5.0,,"Even though I lost ( as usual) , but was a fun experience. Not as grand as the Vegas Casinos , nor as much choice , min bet for blacjack was 20 odd dollars , in Vegas you easily find tables for 5-10 dollars also ideal for people like me who are just there for fun."
,,The paradox of non smoking floors!,3.0,,"On the layout plan I'm sure it looked convincing, upper gaming floor smoke free, lower gaming floor smoking. But, hey , what happens to smoke in free air! It rises upwards doesn't it. And that's the end of the story.
I wondered why nobody had a beer in hand until I was stung by the price. And don't forget your passport, to get in, tougher than airport immigration!...AND to get out!. Yes that's right. Apparently to thwart a local rort, casino passport checkers scrutinise your exit. Hope there's never a fire stampede.
Other than that, there is a broad variety of gaming machines, many culturally attuned to Chinese cultural symbols, ... Yes I did see people with decent credits up, so it is fair.
And it's great for people watching."
,,"Amazing architecture, lousy casion",4.0,,If you're looking for a first class casino vis a vis Vegas you won't find it here. This casino is smaller than most Indian casinos in the US. And of course the games are focused on the local Asians. No fun playing Craps or Blackjack here. BUT I DO RECOMMEND YOU SEE IT. The Mall is amazing (Checkout the Ferrari Store) and has a river running through it! The hotel itself is a marvel and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND going to the top to the skybridge for amazing views and one of a kind architecture.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Wow!!! It was my first experience in a casino and it was great, though I am not a gambler. Its a multi story casino with large verities of games. The dealers are professional.
Soft drinks and bottled water and hot beverages (tea/coffee) are free, whether you are playing or not.

The entry is free for foreigners, you must carry your passport with you. And photography is strictly prohibited."
,,Very smokey,4.0,,Visitors must produce passports to enter casino. Ground floor very smokey as smoking is allowed in all but upper level areas. Free soft drinks and bottled water available. Nice setting. Cheap eats available.
,,Was Expecting More,3.0,,"I love the atmosphere of a casino and I guess have been spoilt at home for choice so perhaps my critique may seem a little harsh by some. The casino boasts that is has a dress code but if they do have a code it had certainly slipped on the evening that we went. Men in shorts, flip flops and t-shirts were aplenty and some of the women weren't dressed much better either. Foreigners do not have to pay the $100SGD entry level but you do need your passport as they check your passport entry date stamp. The entry level floor is the smoking zone with a lesser gambling area upstairs for non-smokers. However as this is a huge open plan casino and smoke rises then it really doesn't matter which floor you're on. Free drinks are non alcoholic and I was generally surprised that there isn't a bar for you to order a glass of wine. The casino was clean and staff pleasant but in terms of a bustling casino I was a little disappointed."
,,It was awesome.,5.0,,First time visit marina bay sand.The environment marvelous and awesome.. Huge and tall hotel next to sea.Really great to walk around with.all the branded from major designer all around the world located here.casino with nice ambiance and free drink..
,,well managed,5.0,,"beautiful casino, though nothing like venetian in macau but well managed with courteous staff, had the latest games and so many options for the low budget player."
,,Relaxed atmosphere,4.0,,"Compared to the casinos in Macau, Melbourne and Las Vegas this is a more laid back atmosphre. The self service hot beverage, soft drink and bottled water stations are a good idea.

Before you enter the casino prepare for your passport to be scrutinised to a level of intensity that I have only experienced from Russian border guards.

One of the levels was non-smoking. Spent about an hour here between looking around and losing money on the slots."
,,Great place,5.0,,Must visit place if you love gambling. Multi story casino with an extensive variety of games. Time pass and good entertainment.
,,not bad,4.0,,"You need to be 21, not 18 as in Europe, so dont forget about that. Besides, they offer the standard games, but it was way to busy, you could not find a table to play."
,,The most impressive casino in the world,5.0,,"I've been to many casinos, this is definitely the most interesting. There is park on a rooftop. The casino has a mall with many stores."
,,Larger than life!,4.0,,"Loved the casino experience at Marina Bay sands! One of the biggest and grandest i d seen. It was my parents first visit to a casino and the were impressed! The dealers are professional and staff very helpful. Best thing is entry is free for foreigners!
Tip: Remember to carry your passports for entry! Also note that taking photographs is not permitted"
,,Interesting and Free Drinks,5.0,,I love going to this casino. I don't gamble but it's so interesting to me to watch all the games that I've never seen before and they are in Chinese. There are normal US games too. But I love walking in and getting a free soft drink/coffee and then watching some people gamble. You'll want to check your bag and bring your ID. If you're a foreigner then bring your passport. This is a good 30 minute visit unless you're a gambler.
,,Great,4.0,,"Good casino, service for drinks a little too slow. Make sure to carry your passport, and they will check this twice while entering and once while leaving."
,,"Clean, free water, coffee and soda, people can smoke, high limits",4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands casino is a good visit for a quick bet if you're stopping in Singapore, but be prepared, a lot of the time the minimum bets on a BJ table are $20, and they're hard to find. Most of the BJ tables sit around $50-100.

Plenty of pokie machines, huge floor space, and plenty of games to keep you amused.
You can get free water, tea, coffee and soda on request or get this yourself by the refreshment stations on the sides of the casino floor.

Easy to get some money out at the cashier, but make sure your BRING YOUR PASSPORT for entry!"
,,its huge .. the biggest casino i have seen,4.0,,free entry for tourists by just showing your passport.. just remember not to take any food or water in your baggage as the baggage counter does not accept such bags.
,,Very busy,3.0,,"Very smoke filled venue, you will stink of smoke when you leave. This place is busy and has a crazy entry and exit system that is very frustrating as they vet local residents and foreigners resulting in long queues to get in and out and means that foreigners must carry their passports at all times- they must find a smoother way to manage this. They say there us a dress code but that's not true as we saw many people in shorts and flip flops"
,,Win your holiday back,5.0,,"This place is a must go for tourist, just for a dollar, you stand the chance to win thousands! Where else to find a better b deal than this?
Just a press of the button, music and flashing lights will come and cash out your winnings"
,,Try you luck,4.0,,"Visited here during the visit to Sentosa Island to try my luck. Although I did not win, it was fun to play. Its a big casino.

Even if you dont like to play just visit there to see the fun. Dress code apply. No entry with shorts."
,,A great atrium. See photos,4.0,,If you like casinos or are a gambler then you must visit. Word of warning though. You need your passport for everything. To enter. To exit. To leave a bag. To pick up a bag the security I found was very overbearing without needing to be. They even check your Singapore immigration card to ensure you are visiting and not a foreign national living in Singapore
,,"Must visit! Its all about money, honey!",4.0,,"The first time I ever went to a Casino, was the MBS Casino.

It is very big, housed on 4 floors, 2 basement and two above the ground. Kids are not allowed. So either go leaving kids at friend’s place or go in a group and visit casino turn by turn, leaving kids outside. Entry for Foreigner is free (that's an inviting proposition). For PRs and Singaporeans, entry fee in 100 dollars. You should carry your IC/ NRIC/ Passport. There is a desk where you can keep your bags.

As you enter, it is a different world. Large, colourful, extravaganza. Free juice and tea. People putting money on the table like crazy, like there is no tomorrow. 500 dollars, 1000 dollars at a time! Different floors house different games. I played roulette few times. It can be addictive and hence it is advisable for amateurs like me to decide an amount to play and stick to it.

But it a very enjoyable experience. You see people making huge money in seconds and also the flip side of the story. It is must do thing in Singapore!"
,,"Yeah, its like any other Sands casino, but...",4.0,,"I had skipped lunch that day, so I was starving. I walked into a noodle place right off the casino. I forget the name, but I had some beef dish (without noodles), think Mongolian beef, that was absolutely superb."
,,Thief,1.0,,"Playing blackjack, the croupier made a mistake and take all the cards before asking the players if they want cards and forgetten taking a second card for the bank (!)
The casino has camera an each table and can check all the cards of the table before the mistake. But they cancel the game !!! Of course, the bank had a bad card (!!!)
A SHAME"
,,Annoying,1.0,,"I recently went to this casino, and let me tell you that they have more security than the White House . Just to get in you have to show your passport about 3 times, they write down all your Info, scan it and look at it again . Before you get in, you have to leave your bag with security with takes about 10 mins while the write down all u passport info. Once you get in the casino is a just a bIg warehouse where the tables are so close you feel like you are in a factory . Once you are ready to leave the check your passport again . Mind you this process takes forever because imagine 15 people trying to leave or get in ... Not worth your time . Go to Vegas !!!"
,,"OMG, stunning to see, fun to play!",4.0,,"The architecture in Singapore is just amazing. I'm going back again in two months and will update! The Sands Casino was full of beautiful decor and decent playing tables (a bit high on the minimums but, it's Singapore!) You must be quiet, unlike typical American casinos. This place is smoke free, pristine and great food and wonderful to view"
,,Average,2.0,,"On our latest trip to Singapore we stayed at both Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World and we both agreed that Resorts Worlds is streets ahead of Marina Bay in so many ways from service, to offerings and rewards programs.

would not recommend and perhaps head over to Sentosa"
,,smoke haze,4.0,,"While the Casino is great, it is really a struggle with people being allowed to smoke at the tables. Not a great area to be around."
,,Good casino,4.0,,"Decided to visit Marina bay sands casino during my shore leave in singapore port..

The entry required passport for foreign nationals and 100 sgd fees for locals..
Security checked passport and stored Any bags we were having..

Exchanged us dollars for cash chips.. These are magnetic chips and alarm will trigger if you try to take them out of casino so better exchange your money for them while leaving.

Casino was crowded and 2 floors with one floor non smoking and ground floor smoking.
Free non alcoholic drinks..

Played poker and roulette and though I didn't win anything went there for experience and atmosphere which is great

Lots of tables and games like bingo slots video poker blackjack roulette baccarat etc..

Lots of highrollers seen even on small bets tables.. Played only 5 Dollar min bets table..

Dale's ok.. Pictures are not allowed in casino.

It may not be for all but can be visited for fun and experience of casino...

Getting taxis is bit difficult especially at night time and long queues expected.."
,,Rooftop bar was worth a visit,4.0,,"Went to the rooftop bar with some friends for Sunset. Seemed like a nice place with great views of Singapore and quite nice and cool up high with a breeze! Drinks were OK, nothing special. Overall definitely worth doing once, but wouldn't be rushing back."
,,Good one for people who play,4.0,,My first visit to a Casino and this one impressed me. The Casino was large. My friends played and I was just passing time.
,,No More Bets.,4.0,,"If you are looking for night excitement, you should try Marina Bay Sands Casino. Easy access, good selections of games, very luxury and beautiful scenery around it."
,,the name says it all,3.0,,this is only a place for gamblers. travellers who like to part their $$ will like this place. For those food lovers or those who enjoy scenery will detest this place to the core.
,,Great for early morning fun gambling,5.0,,"The Casino is big and divided into smoking and non smoking sections. It offers free beverages and the entry is free for tourist after showing their passport. If you are a local you will have to pay $100 entry fee. The best time to do some fun gambling is early in the morning 1-3 am , as there is less crowd then. I not a serious gambler and won some money playing black jack

The are many slot machines and table games , but i think the minimum bet of $ 25 for lowest black jack table is on the higher side. They should start from $10 so that people coming for fun can also enjoy."
,,Typical casino...,3.0,,"Having been to Vegas and Macau, Marina Bay Sands casino as such is like any other. Once you are inside it is the usual sounds and crowds that gamble away the money. Of course the casino is clean and organized and you don't have the smoking smell like in other destinations. We decided to gamble a bit and then get out. The shopping arcade nearby the casino is quite nice and has a good selection of shops and restaurants."
,,No Alcohol in Casino,3.0,,My husband I arrived at 4:30am from LA and we were excited to hear the casino was open 24 hours. After 21 hours on a flight we wanted a cocktail. We were surprised that the casino was completely dry and everyone was smoking. Not fun at all.
,,Political casino !!!,1.0,,"They don't allow Iranian people to Come inside casino !!!!
I was in many casinos all around the world from Las Vegas to macao, South Africa to Brasil but this is an only place that following political problems between Iran and usa.
Really I have no idea what does that ugly behavior means !!!!"
,,This is a very interested place,4.0,,I really enjoyed visiting the Casio. Its no different to many other casinos I have visited. But the building and the style is very worthwhile seeing.
,,This Casino will rip you off!!!,2.0,,"I have been playing in Casino for years,mostly in the native American casino. The experience in Marina Bay was horrible as most of the machines are either 5 Cents or 2 cents. One cent machines are too less. I got bonus in almost all the games, but not a single was generous to pay me back. Huh.. don't go to the casino as it will surely drain your money. Also you must be amazed to know that the combined income of just 2 casinos from Singapore is more than that entire Las Vegas. So I guess you now know the reason. Stay Away..."
,,Not a smoker then don't bother,3.0,,"To enter the Casino you foreigners must have their passport, to be shown upon entry and exit. The irony is smokers are on the ground level with non smokers on the next level, so when your on the non smoking level all the smoke rises to great you."
,,Good Casino,5.0,,"It a real pain having to go through a passport check every time you want to go in, with usually a long queue. Its free for foreigner however. The table stakes on most tables are far too high for the average tourist. I eventually found a $15 (SIN) dollar table with blackjack & side bets. Fortunately I was luck and had $10 on the perfect pair side bet, which came up with aces which paid 50 to one. Most of the dealers are pretty bored, & it shows. The pit bosses do not look after the table chips as they should. The table I was playing on ran out of $1 chips, and when I asked the pit boss to get further chips, he said no. Extraordinarily bad behaviour for a casino pit boss.
Despite all the hype, only an average casino experience. There are a lot better ones around. Considering Sands of Las Vegas are involved, very disappointing customer service."
,,"Huge, crowded, not many foreigners",4.0,,"Came with friends to spend 2 hours: very tight security, thousands of cameras (really), you feel very safe. Access if free for foreigners.
Inside this huge play ground, hundreds of players on slots machines, baccarat, roulette, Black Jack ... quite amazing to watch.
Just for fun we spent 10 SGD, took me 20 Min to loose them on slots machines.
Free soft drinks, even delivered to you by a waitress: great!"
,,Dress up,5.0,,This is a very hi-end place. Make sure to dress and ready to spend if your going here. like the rest of Singapore this place is double the price on everything. You can still have a drink and look around. It's definitely a must visit.
,,A must see if stopping in Singapore,5.0,,"The entire location is stunning. Singapore knows how to impress and this is above the cards.
the hotel, casino. museum and shopping precinct are not for the faint hearted. bring the chq book, your first born and left kidney, you are going to need it here. otherwise enjoy the sheer luxury, opulence and class. bon voyage"
,,Very big casion,4.0,,"Casino was really big and have a lot of gamming tablets, also a lot of one hand machine. I'am not playing in Casino very often but some times is nice to play"
,,Couldn't get in without passport,1.0,,"Seems there's some fairly tight legislation governing entry to the casino. A hefty entry fee for locals apparently, and as the security guard informed me, visitors must carry their passport to be allowed entry. Passport was secure in the hotel safe, which probably saved me a fortune. Certainly the most up tight casino rules I ever heard, albeit well intentioned, and not the doing of the casino. Make sure to read up on entry requirements if you choose to go."
,,"Interesting, very large casino space with ample shopping and entertainment",5.0,,"Interesting, very large casino space with ample shopping and entertainment, Marina Bay sands also has a lot of nice spots for a drink and eat as well."
,,Not Like Vegas Baby,3.0,,"This is definitely worth seeing, but for my American friends, don't expect Vegas. There are very few black jack tables - and on the weekend, there was only one table at $25 - all the rest were $50 minimum. There were a number of poker tables and a few craps tables. The gaming floor is HUGE - it's worth it to go in just for that. Be sure to bring your passport. Singapore residents are charged a $100 fee - and they won't let you in without your foreign passport. The big game here is Sic Bo - sort of like a combo of roulette and craps. It wasn't easy to get an alchoholic beverages - the secret is finding a person in a red dress - and then expect to pay for it. Coffee and sodas are complimentary. This has a totally different vibe than vegas - very serious - not really fun or festive and the dealers are unhelpful."
,,Strong cigarette smell,3.0,,"Although it is non smoking at some levels of the casino, after staying inside for 1-2 hours, you will still come out of the casino smelling of cigarette . Big casino with lots of table games"
,,A nice casino in singapore,5.0,,"casino with lot many tables , not 1-2 tables only.Well decorated inside , for foreigners traveling to this casino , you need a passport and visa , (VISA is must for showing) , only entry with passport wont be allowed."
,,Huge casino well worth a visit,4.0,,"Hi. Read previous reviews, this place must have changed since then. this casino is huge it's free to get in but you do need a passport which they check carefully, all types of dress shorts, jeans, flip flops! Anything goes. Free tea coffee drinking chocolate, all soft drinks. Some low bet table lowest roulette 5 s/ dollars but Evens, red/ black etc minimum bet is 25s/dollars!!!!no one bet on them! 5c slot machines! BUT BIG money being used 200 s/dollars on lots of tables, very interesting walking around saw one man win 25 thousand on a table, worth a visit even if you do not gamble.
Smoking on ground floor but 1 st floor non smoking. Casinos in London are a bit more upmarket. But I really enjoyed the visit. Over 18's only."
,,"Worth a flutter, even if you are not a gambler",4.0,,"Security is quite stringent so best to visit during a quieter period (weekdays, during office hours) if you are not into gambling and the main reason for entering is curiosity. 2 large floor, packed with tables and gambling machines with the non smoking section the entire upper level. Friendly staff to answer questions. Free light refreshments. The sights and sounds of human nature (at its best & worst) are quite interesting to observe here."
,,What a let-down..more akin to a pinball parlour than a casino.. And..,2.0,,".. the access and egress security checks for holders of foreign passports were not only stifling but almost to the point of being ludicrous..the ambiance in the casino was somewhat sombre..and the air reeked of cigarette smoke..there was no wow factors here at all..we couldn't egress fast enough..What a let-down, indeed.."
,,Worth a Visit,5.0,,Many tables and machine games. The staff is very friendly. I was not knowing a machine game and the staff explained the game very well. Lot of tables are there and too many people. Happy to visit this place.
,,Icon of Singapore,5.0,,"The mall itself houses alot of international brands and also food. Casino is quite huge and with plenty of things to play. If you feel lucky, head to higher level for higher bids."
,,Not What I Was Expecting,3.0,,"I've been to many casinos around the world and i was really looking forward to visiting here.

However... Compared to the rest of the Marina Bay resort, this was a bit of a let down. Upon entering the first thing i noticed was the amount of people wearing shorts, flip flops and other general wear. This together with the many people that just seemed to be sitting around machines, not actually playing, gave it the feel of beach arcade and not a casino at a world famous resort. The only reason i didn't give 2-stars was i won on the night, and that was only because in the casino there is.. no... bar?!?

It could be so much better..."
,,Marina Bay Casino,5.0,,One of the best casino in Singapore. you can really enjoy inside the casino. got big amount of tables and got resto as well to have some nice delicious foods... One of the must visit place if you're gambler. ;) Take Care Guys
,,Not to shabby in payouts,5.0,,"Good roomy casino, lots of machines and table games, very easy to find and get to. the staff are very friendly and welcoming."
,,Good Casino,3.0,,Good casino when all floors and games are open. Very large with a lot of choices. I always pop in for one night on my visits. Take your passport - you need it to get in.
,,Worth a quick visit,3.0,,"My husband and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands so decided we should better visit the casino.

It was worth a visit to say we had been there and it was a nice touch that they give free cold drinks.

As tourists we showed our passports and were able to get in for free. They were taking a good look at our passports though not sure if this was just them being nosey?

Inside there is a lot of pokie machines and everyone is smoking inside which is disgusting if you are a non smoker. We couldn't seem to find any non smoking areas"
,,Good atmosphere,4.0,,"The entrance is very strict, you must present identification to enter. Staff are very helpful. There are free soft/hot drinks. Lots of table's and slot machines to play at."
,,Amazing hotel,3.0,,Spectacular views absolutely massive. Service Was variable. Not exactly what was expected from a hotel of this type. Wouldn't revisit but it has to be seen once.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"If you are in Singapore for a few days then the Casino is worth a visit. there is entry price of 100$ / pax if you are Singaporean or hold a PR, else entry is free. Remember to carry your passport and the white pass in it to show that you are a tourist here, or carry your passport and EP/DP pass, then too its free. There is a juice/coffee vending machine inside (complimentary) to enjoy while you look around or play"
,,Casino MBS,5.0,,"Good place for gambler, can smoking insidee free drink coffee , orange juicee , and etc . Paspor for entrance . Bigger than genting casino"
,,"Excelllent, must visit",5.0,,"It is huge, grand, beautiful, fun and what-not. Great place to spend time whether you want to play or not. Or one can just enjoy the free beverages."
,,"Money, Money, Money!",4.0,,Good place to gamble which is win or lose. The ambience is really nice as compared to other casinos. Free hot/soft drinks for everyone so a tourist can enjoy a cup even if you don't play.
,,Average,2.0,,"Had to have passport to enter, was checked more thoroughly than airport security. Good to see a range of tables where you can bet lower if you're there for fun, the majority are there for serious gambling though and were quite rude and had no issue in pushing us out of the way to get to the table (that we too were playing at). Staff weren't very friendly either. No bar to buy drinks from and no real atmosphere to the place. The smell of cigarettes was sickening and the ash all over the floor, tables and seats was putrid. Wouldn't recommend and wouldn't return."
,,Visit this if you have got enough time and money,3.0,,In Singapore you do not find casino everywhere. So if you are fond of or would like to see it out of curiosity and have spare time then yes you should visit this. You need your ID with you and also dress code has to be followed.
,,nice to spend few bucks !,3.0,,"this casino is huge, ok, nothing to compare with Las Vegas, but it's a the image of Singapore...very classy and well organized"
,,"Amazing casino, rivals las vegas",4.0,,"I lost money though! Those damn slots!!!! Also the queues are a bit heavy from time to time, so pick your moment to visit carefully."
,,No poker,4.0,,"Ambience is nice, clean and happening. High minimums for betting. People are not that friendly, dealers also won't strike conversation with you. no alcohol allowed. Too many Chinese games. No poker table. For Singaporean its $100 to enter. Overall experience is worth to go once, beyond that only for hardcore gambling type of people."
,,Casino,5.0,,"This casino is inside the. Marina bay sands .it is free for the tourists and EP,DP pass holders . It is fun to play if you want to try your luck ."
,,One should go,5.0,,It is such a attraction if u will not will to play then also u will try your luck for once . Just looking after public confinces
,,For hard core gamblers only,3.0,,"I will start by saying this is one of the most modern, clean and amazing casino's ive ever seen. However 'fun' and 'lively' it is not. This casino is all about catering to the asian hardcore gambler only. If you love las vegas, then you will hate this place. It's not just the high table minimums as i can get over this if i'm drinking and having a good time. It's the complete focus on all the patrons towards gambling. From what i recall no alcohol on the gambling floor and good luck striking up a conversation with anyone including the dealers and other patrols. Overall my verdict is only go here if you are a hardcore gambler."
,,Very big Casino to play,4.0,,It's very big casino with all varieties of gambling. Entry is free especially for non-Singapore residents.
,,Didn't really like,3.0,,"The security services before you enter there and when you leaving ae treating you as a criminal. Checked my passports stricter than at airports!
The casino is not that nice, bit old, hige and there are all weird, Chinese games in it.
I was in Vegas.. compared to that this would get agrade 2 in 5 scale.
No entertainment at all but at least free drinks. So ho uf you're thirsty."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Free entry with passport (locals have to pay a levy). Large casino with free drinks (non-alcoholic). Smoke freely downstairs, Level 1 is non smoking. ATM at entrance, cashiers will change most foreign currency inside.
Over 2,300 slot machines and many table games. Recommended dress is smart casual - no beach wear, flip flops, casual shorts or sleeveless shirts.
Staff are very helpful."
,,Was just okay,3.0,,I was really excited about going to the casino and this whole area in general but must admit the casino was very underwhelming and quiet. I play the pokie machines and the machines were all pretty much the same and nothing very exciting. Wouldn't go back again.
,,great experience,4.0,,"huge casino, very well organised. friendly dedicated employees, good service. entry free for non singaporians, free coffee, tea, water, softdrinks. great choice in slotmachines and tablegames. open 24 hours"
,,Huge & Classily,4.0,,Have to have your passport with you otherwise will not be allowed in. We went just around to see casino didn't gamble but the staff still very friendly and helpful. Never seen such a huge casino there is one floor for smokers and a non smoker floor plus a high rollers floor.
,,Nice casino,5.0,,"Heaps of games. Free entry with passport. Free soft drinks, water, tea and coffee available while in casino. Can smoke downstairs, upstairs smoke-free."
,,Big casino,4.0,,"It's a very big casino, with shinning & bright lights Foreign passport holder have free entry Atm are located at the entrance of the casino"
,,enduring location,3.0,,world class development. the place itself is landmark and 360 degree view to enhance it. memories are always cherishable
,,What more?,5.0,,"Exciting place,fantastic view of the Singapore Centree,specially on the night Good bar service on the pool area Is really one of the best place I visit"
,,gambling S U C K S,2.0,,"Did not stay in hotel, but went to casino 3 days in a row. THE ONLY way you can win in this casino is if you BET B I G. We played small amounts of .50 to $2 and won NOTHING BIG. Saw Singaporeans bet $4-7 on machines and they would win big. STAY OFF the only two video poker machines in the whole place.....these are money SUCKER and pay out little or NOTHING.

I am from Las Vegas and know a lot about gambling.....Marina Bay Sands in ""NOT PLAYER FRIENDLY"" !!"
,,Viva Las Vegas!,5.0,,"I would be candid enough to confess that I lost 50 SGD while I was here and dared not play more as I do not possess the charm of Midas’s touch. It was my first visit to a Casino and I loved it there.

Entry for foreigners is free on producing their passport while locals pay SGD 100 to enter. I could not locate a bar while I was there for 90 minutes or so but enjoyed my leisurely walk throughout the casino. Must visit for a first time experience."
,,Full gamble service,4.0,,"It's just like other casino in other places in the world. Bring your passport to get a member card. Put the card in before you play. Collecting the points for upgrade the card.

I preferred the one in Macau better coz they're serving wine and beer over there while you're playing."
,,Another example of horrible singaporean customer service,1.0,,"We had some luggage that we could not take to casino. We eventually had to leave without going in - here's wjy..
When we called in We were told to drop our bags at conceirge.
Conceirge told us to go to casino bag drop off. They told us to go 2 levels up to another drop off. They refused to accept our bags. We were stucj and drop drop our bags at the conceirge"
,,Free entry,5.0,,"They have free entry for tourists. Dont forget to carry your passport. Also, dont carry any bag to the casino."
,,"Great location, beautiful casino",5.0,,"After arriving Singapore and checking into my hotel, the first attraction I visited was the casino. The casino is in a beautiful setting and is conveniently located together with the spectacular hotel and upscale shopping mall. Passports are checked at entry since visitors enter free of charge whereas local Singaporeans pay an entry fee, this to discourage gambling.
The interior of the casino is also very attractive. It was not crowded when I was there, very pleasant.
My visit was made even more enjoyable as I won enough for my expenses while in town.
I enjoyed the casino very much and will definitely go again next time I am in Singapore."
,,Good casino well worth a visit,4.0,,Spent a few hours in here and quite a mixed bag of big spenders and day trippers inside casino nice way to kill a few hours and sound a few Singapore dollars
,,short visit to the casino,4.0,,"The casino is quite big, very organized inside... lots of type betting can be done.... also come in different betting cost..."
,,A must visit place for tourists,4.0,,"Technically, odds are against you and will almost always favour in-house but going to Casino is still a charm.
Conveniently located at Marina bay sands, this Casino has 2 floors, Ground floor is for non smokers and a level down smoking one. Several restaurants are also there and ATM's located at enterance.
Good that govt has 100$ levy for locals and PRs. Tourists need passport to entry.

Good place to spend some hours and try your luck."
,,Big and Clean,4.0,,"The casino is very large, with the main floor being a smoking level. All upper floors are non-smoking. The upper floors are large rings that circle the perimeter of the building, and have an open air center, overlooking the main floor of the casino. Everything is big and bright, and clean. Smoke is not troublesome, even on lower floor.
There is a large variety of games, but oddly lacking in any video poker. The casino has only 2 craps tables, and no ""bubble"" craps machines. There are plenty of Sic Bo tables and Bubble Sic Bo machines, which is an Asian game similar to Craps. Plenty of Black Jack, and poker variations (though oddly not much Pai Gao). Table limits for most games, including craps were S$25. Slot machines can be found all the way down to 2 cents. No free alcohol drinks that I saw, but plenty of free coffees, teas, waters, sodas, including several self-serve coffee/latte/espresso machines and soda fountains.
They will want to review your passport (several times) while entering the casino. If you join the casino Rewards Club, it takes 10+ minutes and requires passport and fingerprints.
The casino is connected to the shopping mall and hotel complex. There is direct access from the MRT at the Bayfront station. (Circle line and Down Town lines only for now). The North South line terminates at Marina Bay station, which is a 10 minute walk away. If using North South MRT line, better to transfer at Promenade Station to Circle line. (All of this makes sense, once you arrive and familiarize yourself with the MRT).
This casino has a much more ""open and airy"" feel, as compared to most Vegas casinos- due to it's very high ceilings, wide walkways, and bright lighting and great air filtration/circulation."
,,A Great Way to have Fun,5.0,,"I would say I like this casino better than the one in Sentosa.

This is situated within the Shoppes at the Marina Bay and the interiors are very sophisticated.

Definitely you will never feel the hours would pass by when you are inside.

Just remember to play responsibly."
,,Okay,3.0,,"It was a good casino to visit, the line to enter is quite long and the vibe there is like too serious"
,,Iconic addition to Singapore skyline,4.0,,One of the iconic buildings on the Singapore Sky line. Apart from the Casino there is a massive hotel in 3 towers and a large Mall. The Sky Garden giving panoramic views of Singapore.
,,Was a very professional place.,4.0,,The entry and exit to the casino was professionally handled. A small queue was quickly dispursed so that we could enter the great array of betting areas. Food and drinks were reasonably priced and the atmosphere was awesome. If you are not a Singapore national you will need to take your passport to gain entry. We will definitely go again.
,,worth to try your luck,5.0,,"Is fine to try your luck in here. But please beware how much you already lose. Since i have know, no one ever rich because gambling. Unless you'r a dealer. It's worth to come here since it free to enter and still can get free drinks."
,,"Definetely a place to visit, but set a limit for your staying",4.0,,"Free soft drinks, cap needs to wear backwards. Friendly and considerate dealers. Even I have lost some money, by no hard feelings. Most of the games are available. 1st floor is smoking allowed, 2nd floor non-smoking. Had a good time"
,,Evening,4.0,,Nice casino very few table for Texas holdem did not win 😣overall ok for few hours when left after midnight had to wait for taxi almost 45 minutes
,,Marina bay sands casino,5.0,,There are two casinos in singapore . One is in sentosa and one in marina bay sands . This is in the heart of singapore .this is the best place to mint money if you have luck.the entire acne is free for tourist . The Singaporeans have to pat 100 $ as entrance fee . The interiors and ambience are really beautiful . Must go there to get the feel of a real huge casino .
,,Just a casino,3.0,,It's tougher to get in here than it is to get across through immigration. For those who want to play I suppose its heaven. If you want a drink there is no bar. Once one of the drinks trolley girls come past you find out you can order a real drink from them. No beer but the cocktails seem to be pretty good.
,,Overdone Entry Security,3.0,,"Took a long queue of 10 minutes just to get ini. Once in it is a second rate show for public at least. Perhaps Member only is better, it would need to be. Definitely not what I had anticipated. Even allowed locals in flip flops......"
,,the house always wins,4.0,,"a nice place to go in for the thrill, located near MBS, maybe a boys night out! they have some restaurants and free flow soda inside. they are very strict about the 21 min age limit, don't try screwing with them"
,,Honest review,5.0,,Impeccable condition and as it is smoking allowed I didn't think I would stay long as I can't stand smoking but the conditioning of the air is fantastic you cannot smell the smoke. There is free drinks in there and it is huge. Worth a visit.
,,Modern thunderdome!,4.0,,"Afrer visiting the top of Marina Bay Sands Skypark you have to drop in this casino.
It was like a huge dome, well pretty big enough inside. The smoke little bothered us, smokers had a separate area but you could not separate the air!
Worth visiting and do not leave your passport at your hotel’s safe!"
,,"Casino, guys?",4.0,,"The casino is big, but the chance for you to win big is slim. Gotta dress up a bit if you are curious of the casino, so it means no sandals (flip flop), shorts, and tank tops."
,,Really a fine place.,5.0,,"A really beautiful site at Night . The whole city looks lighted with a super light show at about 8.30 PM at this place. If possible, enjoy the whole site from the top of the hotel. A must watch site!"
,,A must visit,5.0,,"It's one of the best casinos I have ever visited. It's 3 floors and HUGE.....
The grandness of this place is just amazing..
For a new player (like me) there are bets and games starting 2.5SGD (on 1st floor there's min 5/10sgd, go on 2nd floor roulette section)
Lot of time you get to pay as the best are smaller.

Ps : carry your passport, it is must for the entry"
,,Easy Money,5.0,,Great experience at Sands Casino. Free Entry to free beverages. Won Sing $1000 just out of simple calculation trick.
,,Fun modern casino,5.0,,"This casino is so much better than the other one nearby. The slot machine games are much better in terms of visuals and variety and everything is modern, clean and the staff are more attentive and friendlier."
,,Try your luck ;),5.0,,"The casino is one of the biggest i have seen, the entry for Indian passport holders was free which was a pleasant surprise as the local's have to pay for the entry in it."
,,Fine for everyone,5.0,,"There's something for everyone (who wishes to gamble and is of age) here. Countless slot machines and table games for those gambling their pocket change to large sums. Friendly floor attendants bring your free water, soft-drinks, coffee or tea. Easy to spend too long here (as with any casino), but try your luck here--it's quite pretty!"
,,Smokers Paradise,2.0,,"Very high table limits, no craps, limited blackjack and the slots are average. This is no comparison to casino's in Macau or the USA. If you are a non-smoker you will not enjoy. I also could not find a bar so you will have to enjoy the complimentary soft drink pre-mix machine or tea coffee."
,,Lifetime experience,5.0,,"For me it was AWESOME, I have never been to a casino before so when I entered could not believe what I saw, in numerous tables with games, overcrowded with people of all age, novice & experienced trying out their luck.

It is a multi level building with smoking allowed at ground floor.The middle floor is decent with no smoking. Whether you love gambling or not, this place needs to be visited for its magnanimity."
,,THE BEST CASINO IN SINGAPORE,5.0,,"Make sure you do a membership card 1st at the Counter before you starts playing. The cards comes with a picture which they take on the spot – so Smile.

Lots of benefits being a Member, there are lucky draws and contest that you could enter while playing in the Casino.

They provide free drinks – Hot & Cold.

There is also an ATM machine outside the Casino, shouldn’t be a problem to top up your Money.

Have fun, play wisely."
,,Stinks of smoke and leaves your clothes stinking too,1.0,,"It's a casino, a big one. Not a nice one though. Not a patch on Vegas. Worse aspect is smell from people smoking which leaves clothes stinking too. Spent five minutes there and left."
,,Its a casino but.......,3.0,,"My wife and i visited the casino while on our travels through the Marina Bay shopping complex. We knew we needed our passports so were prepared for this. The casino is huge, tables and machines everywhere.It is an impressive casino but smoking is allowed and even though a smoker myself i choose not to in casinos. For non smokers the air is smelly, ash everywhere and full ashtrays at the machines.Very hard to get a drink and no alcohol available. This is worth a look but not for any length of time."
,,money is bling,5.0,,"never recommend this but can try for fun,with smoking and non smoking double storey casino in marina bay sand,with well trainee dealer and staff,place to be a fun for a while waiting for my friends,hats off for well mainten"
,,Impressive building,4.0,,"As a once a week visitor to the casino, I offer the following.
It's big, it's loud, it's busy - especially weekends, it's rigid to get into - yes you need your passport if your an ex pat / tourist.
Access and exit can be disorientating due to being such a large structure with several exit points and several floors. Not to mention the position of the casino within the Marina Bay Sands shopping centre.
It can be confusing transiting between the motel and the casino / shopping complex however, it is quite easily accessible if utilising the MRT.
As a non smoker, finding a slot machine away from the chain smoking Patrons is a challenge, and if you do it's only a matter of time before a smoker sits alongside with little consideration that you were there first!
It is an incredibly impressive building, very ornate with beautiful lighting, several restaurants that caters to most tastes (and budgets)"
,,casino,4.0,,"my wife and i like a flutter on the slot machines and it was also a visit to the sky park and the shops its a day out doing them all...i found it unusual that you needed to bring your passport and have it scanned on the way in and out and pass thro a metal detector just like at the airport ,,it wasn't busy when we went during the day so plenty of room to move and machines to play unfortunately it wasn't our day but it was interesting"
,,"It is not 'a"" casino: it is THE casino to visit !",5.0,,"Waouh. Impressive ! So big, so huge, so many people playing around ! I often hear people saying ""I don't like gambling"" - you don't need to like gambling to enter in the MBS Casino ! It is IMPRESSIVE ! Not very classy though, I like dressing up a bit but apparently there is no dress code at the entrance.

Free flow of soft drinks, possibility to smoke inside, hundreds and hundreds of tables with difference games: it is just a show to go and have a walk around. Giving you a pre-freeling of being in Vegas.

A must see once in your life !"
,,You may get Jackpot!,5.0,,"Located in Marina Bay Sand hotel, one of the best casinos I have ever see. First thing, you must carry you Passport if you are not from Singapore and one more thing, entry is FREE, but not the games! Good luck!!"
,,Have to try it once,5.0,,Was one of the most expensive places I have ever stayed. It was definitely worth the price for chilling next to the pool on a hot Singapore day.
,,Spectacular view of number of gaming tables on the one floor,4.0,,"I have never seen such a spectacular view of gaming tables in one floor ... Although I have been to many casinos across world

Even if you don't gamble .. It's recommended to visit this place at least ones .... You can enjoy free flow of soft drinks and coffee .. Free of cost :-)"
,,This casino is huge!,4.0,,"It is massive in size. The good is that it has entire floors that are not smoking, but the bad is the table minimums are very high. You are lucky to find a table that has $25 SGD minimums, but most tables are $100 SGD minimum."
,,Noisy spot,3.0,,"I guess you read this review as tourist, then bring your passport and you will avoid paying the 100SGD fee which applies for Singapore citizens. I don't know if they are trying to prevent the locals getting corrupted by gambling, or simply control potential money flow. Anyway, I am not a player, and I can not tell you how it is to win or loose here, but I joined my husband. Very noisy place, even compared to Vegas. It seems you can smoke there. Definitely not a place for me, but I guess there are not many casinos in the Muslim countries nearby, so it was completely full anyway. Seems like well organised and controlled place."
,,"Gamble at your will, it is too tempting",5.0,,"Didn't have the courage to gamble. But some of my friends did and I just watched them curiously. The grandness this casino has is simply awesome. Yes free drinks and smoke is available a lot. Found it difficult to be an odd-man out there. Ambiance, vibration and feeling all around was simply terrific. A must watch for freeks."
,,I regret my visit,2.0,,"Normally casinos have this cool atmosphere...well, not this one! To get it they ask for your passport before doing the line, they are not friendly nor polite, do not dare to go if you do not have your passport, they do not accept any other ID, after 1 min queue they ask you again for your passport, PERFECT you are in... well let get the chips, guess what? Passport again! They waiters are not as easy to find as in any other casino, out of all the staff I could say only one was nice, people did not seem to have fun. After an hour we diced to leave and YES they asked for my passport again in the exit door, I understand about security procedures but this was too much."
,,Marina Bay Sands Casino - Amazing!,5.0,,Marina Bay Sands Casino is amazing! Not only are the shops incredible but the outside precinct was fantastic by day and night. It's unusual structure and surroundings makes for great photos with the family! Enjoyed every moment of this area!!!
,,Best view in town,4.0,,"Fantastic setting, everything you need is here. be sure and go to the pool. Staff is very efficient and helpful. I will be back"
,,Great place to Play,4.0,,"One the finest casinos that i have ever been to . It is spread over three floors , the top floor is smoking free areas . While the ground floor is expansive and has a large number of tables , you need to be oki with smoking people all around you , or else you are in for a very diffcult experince."
,,Nice Casino aimed at tourists.,5.0,,"Cool drinks and coffee flows freely. I didn't see alcoholic beverages. You can smoke like a fiend on the main floor. The third floor is smoke free. The main floor is huge, I either have led a sheltered life or this casino had more table games going at 6PM than I have seen in any other casino. They have slots, but they have lots of table games. Nice place, can't say I was lucky, but I believe I received good entertainment for the money I spent."
,,Definite WOW factor and you don't even need to be a gambler....,4.0,,"My husband & I don't gamble, but of course had to have a look around. Definitely in awe of this establishment. The only thing that I hated, people smoke everywhere including at the tables and walking around. I found this rather overpowering."
,,you will need your Passort to gain entry,4.0,,We played one slot and they did a walk through. Tons of people watching. Swanky digs. Unique table games.
,,You don't need to be gambler to enjoy a casino,4.0,,"I don't gamble, period. But some of my friends do and I followed them in just for curiosity. I have been in quite a few casinos in my lifetime but most of them doesn't has the feeling of grandness like this do. Oh, they also serve free drinks in here, although nothing fancy.

There are only 2 casinos in Singapore and this is my choice of a casino."
,,"MBS is a great place to shop, dine and play.",4.0,,The casino floor is very nice and maintained very well. The upper floor is little expensive but the lower floor is reasonable. The shopping area is also very good in MBS and so are the eating options. The taxi options are also very good once we are out of the place.
,,Worth a look,4.0,,"This is worth a visit if you have a couple of hours. Remember you need your passport or ID card to get in.

It's so full, its one of the only places in Singapore that was crowded. We just changed enough chips to take part but what we really enjoyed was the experience. There are just so many people there and so many tables/ machines etc.

Plus there is soft drinks available and its cool and dry."
,,Definitely worth a visit even if you do not gamble,5.0,,"2 floors of every casino game possible and more. Take your passport to gain entry. This place is huge, full of wealth and characters, and great atmosphere. Loved having a flutter and winning a bit but the overall experience was truly brilliant"
,,Beautiful casino,4.0,,"Of course we cant start making advertisement for a casino, gambling is not the right way but...we are all humans i guess. I visited this casino once, took a gamble and won..but thats not so important. I guess its worth a visit to see all the shiny and working machines there. Just take a walk, pay attention and enjoy. Free drinks and snacks.. But bring your passport or you wont get in, and no bags allowed."
,,Great Casino,5.0,,"This casino is very big and bright. It is a fun time. Join the rewards program-it is free and easy and they send you special offers. Some of the door people can be rude, but ignore them and have a blast!"
,,Patience is key to success,5.0,,"Casio is well planned and free entry for foreigners to gamble, if you are bored of the shopping and other stuff want to relax with little entertainment then this is the place you want to be! you can try your luck and who knows!. over all its a good place to visit once and if you are into gambling then is the place you want to be."
,,Addictive,4.0,,"Just for fun, together with my friend we went to this casino and try to gamble a bit. The interior is not that impressive but i find this place too accommodating especially for foreigners and expat....there are so many slots machines inside , perfect and additive for beginners like me"
,,Just OK,3.0,,Great place to relax with friends and family and shoppers but bit overpriced. Make sure you have enough cash on you if you want to visit the pool on the terrace
,,Casino missing Glitz & Glamour,3.0,,"We took note of another Trip Advisor's comments as to which of Singapore's two casinos is better. They stated this one had a no smoking section which meant to us that the other one did not, ie all smoking. Not true. This one, the Marina Bay Sands Casino has a lower level smoking area that has basically no ceiling and the smoke goes straight up to the entry level area. The air con was effective however and you didn't really notice the smoke from above. Instead of walking into a brightly lit, fun looking venue, you face a blank wall and have to choose to walk left or right, not knowing where either direction will lead you. The entry level mezanine is the outer circle of the casino which overlooks the smoking tables below. We didn't bother venturing down there but it looked like it was just tables. The entry level had limited machines and variations of games. The odds overall were not as good as they are in Perth, WA. They areas for changing foreign currency and cashing in chips are separated therefore the majority of the guests, being foreigners who do not have to pay the $100 entry fee like the residents do, have to find and line up at 2 separate desks. The one and only Information desk was not manned in the hour we were there and nobody comes when you push the ""call for service"" button. Signage everywhere (nowhere) was lacking and inappropriately placed. All cool drinks are free and dining is very limited. Definitely not as good as the casino on Santosa Island."
,,"Not a Vegas casino - nice facility, not alot of game variety",3.0,,"The building was great - view from the top is amazing. Take the elevator up and check it out - you won't regret it.

The casino it self was ho hum. TONS of roulette and dice tables, if you like that. Other than that, not a lot of variety. I'm a fan of electronic games, and the machines were largely all the same. The place was fairly packed with locals, so obviously this configuration works for them. A bit smoky too - I didn't go upstairs but apparently there is a non-smoking area."
,,Big and exciting,4.0,,"Big casino, with lots of gaming options. We played roulette and won. They allow smoking on the ground level, which was a turn off. Non-smoking on the 2nd level. Free tea, coffee and soft drinks was a surprise.
There was a lack of eating options inside the casino. There is no space to sit and relax."
,,Look out for the non-smoking area,4.0,,"We are non-smokers & struggled with the smoke in the air however as we were leaving we saw a sign for a non smoking area.
They are extremely generous with free bottles of water, fizzy & hot drinks you can either get yourself or from the trolley service.
We like the 2 cent pokie machines and enjoyed a good 3 hours here."
,,Wonderful Views,5.0,,"Brilliant , go to the lookout on level 57, it's a great view and the place is huge, I recommend go at dusk then you will get the best of both worlds, it's free too but the dinks are expensive but so what your on holidays"
,,not worth the hype,1.0,,"Really unfriendly staff from starting from front door to server, cashiers and croupiers. No atmosphere at all and extremely expensive drinks."
,,Singapore's main casino,3.0,,"A big casino with everything players and visitors look for: machines, restaurants, beverages, a great view."
,,Fun casino night!,5.0,,"Definitely the best Casino in Singapore, hands down! The atmosphere, facilities, and options of games were all on top of the class! Win couple of hundreds or lose couple of more, doesnt matter.. Highly recommended to visit when you are in singapore!"
,,Nice!,5.0,,"Good services, provided with the drinks machine, cold and hot~Many types of games too.. The casino wuite spacious and free entrance for foreign tourists~"
,,Royale Casino - as in James Bond movies,5.0,,My first visit to a Casino & that too a grand Casino in Singapore. Excellent view & interiors inside. It offers free entry for foreigners. There are lots n lots of options for gambling at the casino. A must visit for a traveler to Singapore.
,,Terrible service,1.0,,"I originally booked 6 nights in an Orchid Suite for a getaway for the wife & I
We decided by the end of the first day this place wasn't up to it
The last straw was being told we couldn't sit at a table at KuDeTa on the pool level as this was for people who spend over 200 at the bar. Now normally 200 is an easy spend at a place like this but after that I'd decided they weren't getting any more of our custom.
We checked into the Shangri La and so glad we did absolutely wonderful but that's another review"
,,I love MBS Mastercard Theatre,5.0,,"Aside from its wide casino floor and shops everywhere, I love coming back to MBS for shows in Mastercard Theatre. Being able to watch CATS and SWAN LAKE here, I think this could be my next favorite stage in the next few years."
,,Nice place to burn some cash,3.0,,The casinos in Singapore basically cover the same general games. What I liked about Marina Bay Sands was a) there was a non-smoking floor b) It was WAAAY quieter than the Genting Resorts Casino at Sentosa c) It's easily located via the public MRT transport.
,,Fantastic view and service!,5.0,,Great treat for our 10 year wedding anniversary ! The pool is really awesome and the staff as well made everything possible for us to fell home away from home
,,Remarkable View,5.0,,"A real eye catching building, three towers with a ship hull across all three buildings, rated no. 1 among the Singapore skyline architect. The view is as remarkable as the building! Must go to the top and spend some time dining, at the bar, or in the pool!"
,,Gamble away,5.0,,"Best casino seen so far! Don't forget to carry ur passport it's mandatory. Splurge, enjoy, win, lose, enjoy, it doesn't matter, just have fun. Had d best of my time. Pity they don't allow you to take pics but then who will remember if ur having fun."
,,Bizarre no alcohol served in the casino....,1.0,,"No alcohol is served here.. Very strange... I understand the moral behind it but hey coke, tea or coffee only? There is only so much tea or soft drink one can have... Found it very bizarre..."
,,casino life,5.0,,Great casino open to foreigners local singapore people pay 100$ to enter good hotel and great location to hangout
,,Wondeful Arena for Casino Lovers - Options for everyone,5.0,,"Must visit for all the casino lovers who want to try their luck out - Has option for one and all- Bet as small as 2 cents/bet on machines to as high as you want at the tables :)

Free entry for Foreigners
Very Imp. -(Must carry your passport or work/employment pass)

Multi level arena - wonderfully built - Amazing ambiance - Separate floor marked as Smoking Zone.
Get free refreshments in form of Juice, Milo, Tea, Coffee."
,,Amazzzzzing casino!,5.0,,This is always one of my favorite casinos to play in! Singapore has really done a great job with preserving the quality of this casino. 5 star in every way.
,,Fun fun fun,4.0,,"I went to this casino with friend..but I didnt play just accompany my friends n having fun. For foreigners, have to brings your passport....dont bring backpack, any food or drinks. Or you will not allow to enter. In the inside,they serve drinks for free as much as you can....juice coffee tea mineral water milk soft drink. You will having fun even though you are not a gambler."
,,had an ok time,3.0,,"I had an okay time betting here, yet its not the most pleasant gambling club ever. You have to hold up in line to demonstrate your travel permit, and in the event that you neglect to get cash from an ATM before entering, you can't by-pass the line regardless of the fact that you simply demonstrated your international ID. Remember it in light of the fact that else it costs $100 to enter in case you're a Singapore inhabitant."
,,Amazing Location,5.0,,"Location, at its best...One of the best casino..,Visit once....a must to visit place....never miss this place.....it will take u to the place of fantasy...."
,,A casino experience with a twist,3.0,,"I wanted to try the casino experience and chose MBS as it was easiest to get to from the CBD. Be sure to take your passport with you otherwise you won't be allowed in or out. large gaming floor, most table games a little intimidating if you cant read chinese. machine game minimums were 2c. free water & coffee at little trolleys all around. very smokey inside with one area upstairs designated no smoking but still smokey from downstairs. fun distraction."
,,Casino - Money Honey,4.0,,"Really a nice place to make or loose money. Entry for foreigners free, do not forget to take your passport along with you. Entry fee for local citizens. See the real world of casino which you saw in movies. I also played, won in start and at the end lost and left. But had a nice experience and enjoyed. Nice atmosphere......... went couple of times there..........."
,,BeAuty and Fun,5.0,,"a great place for any casino gamer, with a wide variety of slot machines and table games. The location makes for a nice walk plus the shopping center attached is enjoyable to browse around with many eating options. This is always a stop on my returns to Singapore ."
,,Addiction,5.0,,"Stayed for 7 days 6 nights in Singapore, spent all 6 nights at this crazy place. It is so addicting that you'll not want to leave out of the place unless you've lost your everything. Located inside the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, it extends to 3 floors. The lowest one is a smoking zone while others aren't. Loved this place totally."
,,Nothing to lose,4.0,,"I visited with the intention of checking out the scene, not so much for the gambling. It was quite fun, there are lots of machines that accept small denominations in case you would like to try out your luck. My friends and I went there several times, and found that the best time to visit would be on a weekday afternoon. Don't bother visiting the place on weekends, as it is full of people, and if you are a small-fry gambler like me, they double the min bid on weekends, so it won't be as fun.

If you only have time to visit just 1 casino during your trip to SG, visit this one instead of the one in Sentosa. Mainly because it has more machines, much bigger venue, and also a more lively ambiance."
,,Best place to hangout,5.0,,I spent 3 night in casino...free entry for foreigners..free drinks inside...U can find all types of games..I played Roulette had a good experience...I love this place..photos not allowed inside
,,Ka - ching,4.0,,"Located inside the beautiful Marina Bay Sands Hotel is the Casino which extends to 3+ floors.
The lower 2 floors is where the general excitement is from blackjack tables to the slot machines all you see and hear is money money money.
Good thing about the casino is that the 100 Sing Dollar entry fee is waved off if you are a tourist but remember to take your passport as proof. Tired of playing, help yourself to the unlimited drinks ( nonalcoholic) and coffee.Unlike some other Casino’s, no dress code required here. Had an amazing night there."
,,Good atmosphere but high minimum bets,4.0,,"I have been to the casino multiple times and always really enjoyed my time there. The way to the casino through the Sands complex is quite nice and adds a certain 'classy touch'. Unlike in Las Vegas, your passport/ID gets checked at the entrance (and exit) multiple times. Non-Singaporeans enter for free and usually the line is so short that you will not wait longer than 1min. Once in, you can get all sorts of soft drinks and hot drinks for free at one of the multiple refill stations. The variety of games is really good and the atmosphere almost as good as in Vegas, especially because the casino is always quite crowded. The only downside is that minimum bets are extremely high, therefore leaving casual gamers, students etc. with slot machines and virtual Roulette."
,,Classic Casino,5.0,,"One of the Best Casinos i have ever been to. A classic Layout. you can go in as long as youre above 21,legally adult."
,,Sucks!,1.0,,"Getting in is more complicated than getting into a High Security Prison to visit an inmate, it's ridiculous. So if you really wanna go...take your passport. It is huge and it stinks of cigarette smoke. Don't go there...spend your money somewhere else."
,,What A Disappointment,2.0,,"Not much good to say about this place.
The security check took forever and there were nobody in line but us!! Go figure.... Our passports were examined twice by two different security officers. The first guy was at least somewhat friendly and courteous but the second officer was a total donkey's behind. He kept giving us this look like a couple of Orientals like us couldn't possibly be holders of US passports and we must be locals trying to pull a fast one. Very unwelcoming to say the least! Seriously, I think we got through the immigration checkpoint at Changi airport faster than at this place.
At eleven, the place was hopping with plenty of gamblers but also people just sitting there gawking at passers-by. Must be already tapped out or just there to watch the action; take advantage of the free sodas; or to enjoy the free cigarettes (floating in the air). Very poorly ventilated for a place that allows open smoking. The stench of cigarettes smoke makes it quite unbearable.
Ambience and décor was quite disappointing considering the absolutely magnificent resort hotel it is housed in. For some reason we expected more, much more.
In retrospect, it kind of confirmed our suspicions that they really were cutting corners and trying build on the cheap after the SANDS ran into financial trouble during construction and had to be rescued by the Singapore government.
We think the luxury casinos in Vegas i.e. Bellagio, Venetian are way way better in all aspects. Needless to say, we did not stay to indulge. If asked, we can say we were there. That's about it.
Oh, btw they have self service beverage stations set up around the main floor offering sodas, juices, coffee etc. That's refreshing!! :)"
,,Well organized - BIG!,4.0,,"Was staying at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the casino is linked to the hotel via access through the basement level. Foreign passport holders be prepared to carry your passport as this will be inspected upon for entry and also is free for visitors, whereas Singapore nationals and residents have to pay an entry fee.

Sometimes there were long lines at the casino entrance but they moved quite quickly. There are also two separate lines for nationals/residents and foreign passport holders.

Upon entering the casino like most around the world it is most colorful and this one is particularly large. They have beautiful overhead lights which theme in with the design which we found quite attractive. The ground level is a smoking floor and the first level offers a non-smoking section, the level above that offers private and high end reserved gaming rooms and for those holding card privileges.

Free flowing coffee stations were an unique touch around the perimeter of the casino, any patron is invited to serve themselves and produce a gourmet coffee! An unusual touch! Drinks are also available to players as is typical around the world.

There are some nice eateries inside the casino as well which were reasonably priced, plenty of restrooms and perhaps it's a good thing that they check your passport on the way out, at least you know you still have it when you leave the building!!"
,,Hive of activity,3.0,,Busy place and great viewing of parts of it are available in other parts of the Marina Bay complex (see photos). Many of the games were not familiar to me and not what you see in Las Vegas but it will cater to their cliental. Casinos do seem to be a popular pastime in this part of our world.
,,Casino 007,5.0,,"I have been there twise. If u r visiting tourist visa wow- entry is free. Well maintained highly secured place. High flow of money , that's y. Must visit even u r not going to play. Complimentary drinks(cover,tea&soft)too. No entry if u r not having pass port in ur hand. U should have a membership card to play(free of cost). Try urs luck in small machines 1st... Gud luck.... Enjoy...have sweet memories."
,,Singapore colosseum,4.0,,"With three levels of gaming floor-space and over 2,300 slot machines to choose from, the Casino at Marina Bay Sands offers a vast selection of the newest and most popular electronic gaming machines and 250 game titles to choose from. There is a wide range game offering Roulette, Sic-BO and Baccarat.
The Casino has free entry for foreign passport holders. Minimum bets being S$25 and S$50. It is a bit on the higher side when compared to the Sentosa casino where the minimum bets start from S$10. The entire Ground floor is smoking area, and the 1st floor is non –smoking. I been to many casino around the world, but this one is one of the most exciting. Dress code is long pants and closed shoes (for men). If you are into gambling it’s worth the visit, and if you are non-gambler is still worth the visit at least you don’t leave with empty pockets."
,,Huge huge casino,4.0,,"It was a pretty huge casino. Have been to Vegas but seemed to be much bigger than any single floor of a casino in Vegas hotels.
Although they don't have good blackjack tables to play as there is a shuffle done every bet, it was a good experience.
Not to forget, their free coffee is superb.."
,,Huge casino,4.0,,"Never been to casino before, therefore cannot compare, but if you are in Singapore you will definitively visit Marina Bay Sands, so take a quick look inside this huge casino. It is free for visitors (foreigners) if you have a passport with you. Casual dressing code (very relaxed indeed), and most likely complimentary drink even if you do not gamble at all (well don't tell them, but you don't have to play any game)."
,,Gamblin time,5.0,,Yay for the nonsmoking section!! All the games you'd expect. Great complimentary nonalcoholic beverages that you can get yourself at drink stations or from waitresses. Casino is in good shape. Clean bathrooms. Fun night out!
,,Great fun,3.0,,had an hour in the casino on the slots. Not a big gambler but like the fun of it. Only downside was the lower level was for smokers. Most surprising.
,,Casino time,5.0,,I went with a friend as I was feeling bored at home and it was the best time pass place to go to.and if you like gambling then it is the perfect place.I played a few games like poker blackjack etc it was fun and you also have free drinks if you are thirsty.
,,Huge Concrete Cavern,3.0,,"One of the more impersonal casinos somewhat lacking in character, ground floor gaming for smokers and second floor opening onto a balcony overlooking the ground.
Strict rules on entry, locals pay a levy, foreigners must be in possession of passports and Singapore entry visa card which I always clip inside my passport when I enter Singapore.
Some good slots and if you catch them on a good day some good payouts on jackpot machines but expect to pay maximum stakes to draw big. Been many times but only played the tables on a couple of occasions as they get really crowded.
Next door to the Sands Hotel and linked to the shopping mall where there are some very good food outlets and high end shopping"
,,Good fun,4.0,,The MBS Casino has free entry for foreign passport holders. Its quite big with many game tables. Played a bit of Blackjack with the minimum bets being S$25 and S$50. It is a bit on the higher side when compared to the Sentosa casino where the minimum bets start from S$10. People who dont smoke can go to the 1st floor which is a non-smoking floor but all the happening tables are on the ground floor. Beverages are free for all inside the casino.
,,Nonsmoking Casino,4.0,,"Typical casino, mostly electronic slots and similar machines. Lots of Black Jack tables. MUST have your passport to get in and get out. Minimum chip is $5."
,,Huge and amazing.,5.0,,"We love going to casino everywhere we can ,and we have been already in great places like Vegas and Macau but this one i think is one of the most impressing one.
lots of tables and lot of peoples.
don't forget to bring your passport to inter and dress in long pants and closed shoes (for man) .
the minimal blackjack table is 25$ (singapore dollar) and the roulette is 5$.
possible to buy snacks and sandwich ( a very goos one ) for 4$. and drinks (light and coffee ) on the house."
,,Foreigners BRING PASSPORT to enter,2.0,,"I'm not really sure what all the fuss is about... It's just a regular casino. It's big but not as big as I was expecting considering how much this casino grosses (more than the whole Las Vegas strip!)

The best part of our night was going to the upstairs bar on level 57, not the casino.

Casino floor is full of smokers.
Left after about 45 mins of wandering the floor stinking of cigarettes.

Free coffee/tea/cold drinks for patrons."
,,Wooooooooooooo.......,5.0,,"What an amazing entertainment venue. floors upon floors of gaming tables, slot machines that just love to eat your money. Passports required for tourists to enter as Singaporeans have to pay a S$100 entry levy. Was worth the hassle of entry just to experience something of this magnitude. Then you have to have your passport checked again as you leave..... I guess its to make sure you are the right person leaving...... I don't understand why it was necessary........ never mind, their place their rules...... Great fun, but still have to return to work next week....."
,,Nice to play,5.0,,World class casino. Can take any risk if u have enough money. Money money money with excitements and with good best secure place. Don't miss it if u r travelling by tourist visa. Because the entry absolutely free. Enjoy.
,,Singapore - Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,The Marina Bay Sands Casino is like any of the big and popular casinos in Last Vega. You need to have your passport to enter. The Marina Bay is a MUST see in Singapore. While you are there check out the Sands Casino.
,,Not for the Faint Hearted or Asthmatics,3.0,,"The casino is huge, no doubt about it.

Travellers - you need your passport to enter and exit

Pros

- easy to catch a taxi home

Cons

- table minimums for blackjack $25
- majority of slot machines are 5c or 10c
- some of the 1c machines require a minimum $4 bet
- smoking is permitted so atmosphere not pleasant

Having gambled in casinos around the world, can't say I want to return here"
,,HUGE,4.0,,"Its a Huge Casino, very clean and no people yelling or screaming in the Casino They were renovating when I was there so that was a bit of downside during my visit..... You need to pay for the food but beverages is for free."
,,Unique casino rules,4.0,,Read up on the history of Singapore's casinos. Foreigners can enter the casino for free if you bring your passport. Locals have to pay to enter. It is quite a neat casino in my personal opinion. And they serve free drinks.
,,Excellent and Beautiful,5.0,,Excellent experience. very beautiful. Dont go back so early. stay till at least after 8pm to see the night over at Casino. Friendly staff. Strategically located with F&B available and also shopping haven too!
,,"Very large, bright, smokey casino",5.0,,"Very large, bright, smokey casino, free drinks. Fun games. The minimum for black jack is 25$ which is quite high. This is just a huge machine to take money out of people. Open 24 hours - more buzzing during night hours. All famous games are available on the floor. Minimum bets start from SGD10. we liked the atmosphere once inside."
,,Simply Awesome!!,5.0,,"- Amazing experience
- No entry fee for foreigners if you are holding passports
- amazing ambience...100% oxygen supply 24/7..and hence you will never feel drained out or sleepy even if u r there full night
- once u start winning, it becomes an addiction
- a good place for taking your girl friend...and try ur lady luck!"
,,casino at marina sands,5.0,,"be sure to take your passport i.e all non singaporean travelers entry is free.its huge and one has a variety of choices to bet. It has one smoking and other non smoking level. Roulette is what I tried my hand on and one can be lucky initially, dont get swept away. Good choice of drinks available and great place to spend time and must try is Singapore for adults."
,,Great massive casino,5.0,,"Brilliant if you love gambling, No under 21s and take your passport along or no entry. Easy to go there by taxi. The casino is very impressive and offers free refreshments to players."
,,Bland experience,3.0,,"Too huge, too impersonal as anything in Marina Bay Sands complex, the overall experience was a bit of a bore. Spend some time at the roulette table, that was okay, but I felt all of the tables were just too crammed into central space with little place to walk between them. Didn't experience any queues, as went there quite early in the evening, ten-ish, actually managed to walk out with a small winning, but the overall experience was not so thrilling and stylish as comared to European casinos. This is just a huge machine to take money out of people, but without the fun or charm of it. Also, to the great disappointment of my husband, there were no poker tables."
,,Goods and bads,3.0,,"First of all.. Got a huge line to get in and the counter and security is not extremely rude but neither polite. The route and gate to get in is confusing.. And show your passport to get out...?! It feels like prison not a fun room.

Entry fee to local and free for foreigner is definitely a smart policy for casino n local. Then it's free drinks n smoking inside the casino so u don't have to go to smoking room like in the other country. So you'll stay there to PLAY all the time~ !

I can't say its a bad or good casino coz I do not leave a good impression here but I have to say its a smart casino that you can visit n learn from it ~"
,,Not Vegas,3.0,,"The MBS casino is soulless compared to Vegas. No theme, no razzmatazz, no energy. Hard to get in and hard to get a drink. It's a bit of fun and one of the quickest ways to make or lose money fast, but frankly a bit dull and in no way matches a big Vegas casino vibe"
,,"Good ambience, high minimums",3.0,,"Locals need to pay a daily access fee, this is waived for foreign visitors, but you do need to show your passport to gain entry, so make sure that you bring it with you.

The casino itself is very upscale, modern and clean. There are a lot of table games on both levels, with very high minimums. I visited on a weeknight and was able to find a few tables with a minimum bet of S$25, but that took some looking. There were plenty of high limit tables with minimum bet requirements of S$300 or more per hand.

Baccarat is the primary table game, but they do have other more western games, including blackjack. All blackjack table used continuous shuffle machines, which make it impossible to get a ""hot"" deck, but other than that, the rules were favorable compared to, say, Vegas blackjack games.

Given the prevalence of high limit tables, it is a bit surprising that they have significant scrutiny on cash outs. I cashed out S$700 in chips and was asked for my players card. Something that does not happen in the US for that level of cash out. I chalk this up to being in Singapore, where everything seems to be more regulated than the US.

I only played for about 1/2 hour with my newly minted players card, and I have received no communications whatsoever from the place. I wasn't really expecting a lot of comps for such a minor level of play, but a ""welcome to the club"" e-mail would have been nice.

The shops connected to this place are very nice, and extremely high-end."
,,"Fun casino, not sleezy like in other countries",4.0,,"The casino was nice. Very large, free drinks. Fun games. The minimum for black jack is 25$ which is quite high. Whether you have luck with the dice or not, you'd probably enjoy the overall experience."
,,Don't Bother,2.0,,I would not bother plenty of other things to do in Singapore. Need to carry passport for free entry and show on way in and out if you are a foreigner. No bars in the Casino to have a drink. Very different to Vegas or even Australian Casinos. Only for the gambling addicts.
,,Don't Bother! Big Let down.,1.0,,"Probably the worst Casino I have ever been in! First had to queue up and show our passports to get in, then the bottom level is smoking, so could not breathe. Went up a floor and walked around. No bars!!!!! There is a drinks trolley, like old school tea ladies, which were expensive. Casino was very bright, very smokey and had absolutely no atmosphere. We spent around 10 mins in there. Was quite appalled when you consider the glitz and glamour of the Marina Bay Sands and the shopping areas, then the casino. What a let down!"
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"You can get a decent view of all the action by visiting the level with all the celebrity restaurants and looking down on the casino. Alternatively, as a PR or citizen be prepared to pay $100 for the privilege of entering. Foreigners without PR can visit for free but need to show their passports at the entrance."
,,Not Great,2.0,,"We brought our passports, but it was a hassle to get in. And no one was friendly during the check-in process, very un-Singapore like.

Casino is much less claustrophobic compared to casinos in Vegas. But compared to a Vegas casino, it seemed to be much quieter. No one was happy here. Everyone was serious. The hotel employees, especially at the Blackjack tables were bleak, no smiles, even when they took my 50 SGD in 20 seconds. Yes, the minimums at the Blackjack table were $25. I was out $50 in 20 seconds. At that point we decided to leave. Not a great experience."
,,NEED passport to get in,1.0,,"First time round couldn't get in, no passport, just photo ID & photo of passport- not good enough. Inside, pretty standard cas, nothing exciting, expensive drinks.."
,,Just average...too many lines to get in/out & high minimums,3.0,,"If all you are looking for is to gamble, it is ok but compared to the other casinos in the world, there is a lot to be desired. There are long lines to get in/out and you are required to bring a passport, not just a photo ID which isn't great to walk around with. In addition, the minimums for the tables are extremely high which makes it less reasonable to play for as long."
,,Exciting experience,5.0,,"A good place to spend a decent amount of time (for both gamblers and non gamblers). Open 24 hours - more buzzing during night hours. All famous games are available on the floor. Minimum bets start from SGD10

Non alcoholic hot/cold drinks are available as complementary. No smoking gaming floor is also available. Foreign nationals must carry passport for free entry."
,,Cool slot machine & casino,4.0,,"Hanging out with the coolest characters in gaming is as easy as pressing a few buttons, sitting back, and watching the coins drop. Start off by making your bet and line selections. Use the arrows to make your selections, and then lock in your bet by hitting Spin."
,,Fun even for non gamblers !,4.0,,"I've never gambled in my life and I went in this one out of curiosity and to watch a friend gambling. It's huge, only part of it is accessible to everybody; I assumed the upper floors are for known and rich gamblers. It is fun to watch people playing, though if you're not a smoker you might feel fast annoyed by all the smoke. Drinks are free and if you're a foreigner you can enter for free (don't forget your passport as you need to show it both at the entrance and exit).
Some tables have low minimum bet amounts so beginners can definitely try!"
,,Show your passport to get out?,3.0,,"The first surprise was that the casino is not in the same building as the accommodation towers, that would be a pain for those expecting it to be one and the same like most casino's.
Second surprise, having to show passport to get in, not a big issue but part of the government policy about locals having to pay to enter I guess.
The place is big.
Lot's of choices.
Money change was inefficient, ques were way too long. Two lines, one might move slower etc. Hard to find rest rooms ( why so few in such a large facility with so many people).
But the biggest turn off was the arrogant security guard demanding to see passports on the way out! Go figure...... are they worried their extremely tight security might have missed someone on the way in or a local might never leave?
Had to walk a fair way to get a taxi.
But we liked the atmosphere once inside. The foyers are baron. The first impression when entering is ""WOW""."
,,Dun really feel welcomed,3.0,,"Probably my first and last visit to MBS casino. All staff here are NOT friendly at all, ultimately customers are here to spend money win or lose casino should very least be treated with a smile.

Been to enough casinos around the world but probably would not step into mbs singapore again. I dun even feel good when i win money, thats how i feel as a customer here."
,,Worth Visiting Even If You Are Not A Serious Gambler,4.0,,"Even if you are not a serious gambler you can pay a visit to The Marina Bay Sands Casino and try your luck either at the tables or on the slot machines. Who knows, it could be your lucky day."
,,Good if your a gambler,2.0,,"it's like most casinos lots of poker machines, black jack tables and so on. The food is quiet good and drinks are expensive. You need to take your passport to enter and they will not except a photo copy , it must be the real thing. I spent about an hour in there and that was enough for me as I'm not a gambler. Locals have to pay 100 sing to get in which I find discriminating"
,,Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"Visited this gigantic hotel casino and it was just absolutely stunning..Facilities, shopping, restos, are all excellently designed furnished and of course service is very courteous and proper.."
,,A different kind of experience,4.0,,I have visited this place along with my wife. Kids are not allowed inside. All people with short stay singapore visit visa can get a free entry to the casino..Inside there is a big hall with so many workstation like instruments where people sit and gamble..there are counters to pay money and buy play coupons..beverages are seen served on the table itself....Please visit a casino once in a life time..anywhere in the world...
,,"Great show, great experience",5.0,,"The hotel and the top deck are a great view. You can have different perspectives, one during daytime and one at night. Pictures from night are attached. After 6 pm, business casual is required to go to the top floor, and no shorts allowed.

The laser show by the waters is also a great experience. It's about a 12 minute show.

This is good for family, couples."
,,Nice casino,4.0,,"Casino is highly secure so without a passport or driver's licence you will not be able to enter. Atmosphere was nice, although people smoking was a little annoying. The usual games of roulette, blackjack, the wheel etc. are available and the varying levels of the casino are a nice touch. It could do with more variety regarding restaurants though."
,,Grand,5.0,,"Is huge and a great place to have a good time and try your luck, the experience is worth a visit for sure"
,,nice place for waiting,4.0,,if you have ample time for waiting you may play their casino. it was so clean and many machine to choose. but you have to check your watch from time to time because you will never know you already consume the whole day in the casino.
,,Best & Gigantic Casino,5.0,,My first time into a Casino and it really impressed me a lot . One of the best place to earn money and also loose it . Play responsibly if your gonna go for it.
,,Disgrace,1.0,,"This casino is like a prison to get in
We arrived and because we were air crew they treated us like convicts asking were our airport pass was (we had called ten minutes earlier to ask what we needed informing them we were air crew and were told just passport) and after getting a taxi here we were made to wait half an hour like idiots whilst someone verified if we were in fact crew when it Stayes it in our passport !!
Totally ruined our mood and our night never coming back here and will tell all my passengers not to come"
,,Huge Casino,5.0,,"You get lost in soo many things to do in the casino. This is one huge casino and entry is free for tourists. Be sure to keep your passport with you as entry for tourists is free with your passport. Also, take only limited cash with you as this is a big casino and you will get lost with so much to do unless you come with an unlimited budget ofcourse."
,,Perfect!!!!!!!!,4.0,,You have to see it!!!the building is perfect!!!!very very clean...and very big hall for playing games!!!!slot machine or poker....smoking is allowed is some halls!!!!!
,,Try to get a drink,3.0,,"The casino it self is ok, plenty of tables and slots available. Nothing regal about the place, dress standard is a minimum and the place is smoke filled. My absolute shock is there is only 1 bar (not bar more a sales cart) trying to get a drink is a nightmare, in certain areas they are complimentary but this came with a long wait and total frustration. I near begged the hostess to allow me to just pay but please bring me a drink, it is a frustrating system and will infuriate anyone wanting a few beers."
,,Meh. Unless you're really into mindless loss of money,2.0,,"I spent a couple of hours here watching my friend grinding out a small amount of money at blackjack. The people here are depressing - aunties hoping desperately to make a few bucks, rich kids, drunks.

Better things to do....there's a reason the SG government charges locals to come in here and lets the foreigners in for free..."
,,Superb,5.0,,Marina Bay Sands is awesome location of Singapore. I loved it.I been there for a business meeting. Very good environment
,,Smoky Sands,1.0,,"Pros: Free soda water, Big Area, Lots of Options, Won on Slot Machines. Cons: Smoke everywhere, hard to breath, Security is tight, took about 3 minutes to check in bag (lots of red tape), ended up winning on slots yet losing on my health with all that smoke. Room was quite boring compared to Las Vegas--more fun there. Go Vegas or if in Asia Macau so less hassle and less smoke."
,,Good,5.0,,"Multiple choice, good location, crowded at all time:). Smoking downstairs and good security services. Felt safe inside:)"
,,Fascinating Architecture,5.0,,"Building is spectacular. Houses a hotel, casino, mall and canals. Located on the bay with wonderful vistas. Something for everyone!"
,,A Hassle,2.0,,"Have to get in line like Immigration at the airport. Foreigners are free but Singapore residents have to pay SN $100. If you like the slots and free drinks there are plenty of slots but only one place on top floor where you can go up to buy alcohol...although you can ask any server for alcoholic drinks. Free does not exist unless you want soda, water, tea, coffee or milo.
Tables have high minimums so bring your checkbook. Main casino floor is SMOKING and worse than smokers are smokers that are gambling. Top floor OK though. My other problem is the dress code. On the website it sites: NO slippers, flip-flops, shorts, etc....I saw so many Chinese in house slippers and shorts. Enforce the code or don't have it."
,,Lovely hotel and pool,5.0,,Room for 4 of us was fine size. Pool was amazing. Shops attached had food court for good priced food with great variety. View at night from pool was great too. Entry of poolside chairs. Cocktails expensive. Fish spa in shops was fun for kids too
,,Interesting for a first timer!,3.0,,"This was a interesting visit: my first inside any casino. There is no entry fee for ex-pat visitors to the casino - they do check your passport upside& inside out both at entry AND exit ! Didnt understand for what though. Just had a round through the place. Has both smoking and non-smoking levels. Many tables for black jack, roulettes, dice games and slot- machines. No cameras allowed inside. The staff was grouchy but then grouchiness could come with the kind of job they do?!"
,,Staff going above and beyond.,5.0,,"I did not stay at Marina Sands but visited the Casino and Hotel Complex out of curiosity. The Casino have very stringent entry rules but as long as you carry your foreign passport you can gain free entry to the amazing Casino floor. I ate at the modest Hot Pot Chinese Restaurant overlooking the Casino Floor and the food was Singapore perfect (hot) and cheap. I inquired about accessing the upper level of the Hotel complex to view the infinity pool and the Restaurant Manager named June escorted me across to the Hotel side of Marina Sands, through the maze of shopping arcades and up to the 57th floor of the Sands hotels where I later found she had rung ahead to reserve me a seat with the best views over the Gardens by the Bay. The smoke haze from fires in Indonesia spoiled the views but the wine list at Sky 57 was excellent and the service was outstanding, extending to providing me with binoculars to look at the park lands and shipping. June's actions convinced me to stay at the Marina Bay Sands for my next visit to Singapore. Well done June!"
,,You need to be filthy rich,5.0,,"The entire complex is so big and grand that even a millionaire might fall short of cash in no time. Casinos, rooftop swimming pool,overpriced bar with excellent view , and of course the marina bay sands hotel and the shopping complex. It's a spenders' paradise."
,,Not great,2.0,,"Too full of smoke, not friendly dealers and very expensive. I think resorts world one is better. Only advantage is that it's in city centre."
,,Very disappointing,1.0,,"Having heard lots about Marina Bay Sands before my trip, I had high expectations for all the tourist attractions around Marina Bay --- including the casino.

When we got there, one person in our party didn't have their passport, so she could not get in, while the rest of us passed the security checks and got into the casino. Then we tried to talk over the separators (to make plans to meet up later), and the staff told us we are not allowed to talk over the separators between the casino and the empty area outside! Must be security issues, perhaps the casino staff is worried that I may transfer the last person in just by talking.

Anyway, the casino decoration is passable, the odor is too smokey for non-smokers, there is free instant coffee, soft drinks and water.
The staff and dealers are very solemn looking, and never even had a hint of a smile on their faces.

On the way out, there are two lanes (one for locals, one for foreigners) for another security check. There is a small sign (about A4 size I think) in the middle of both lanes, indicating which lane is which. Both lanes have staff standing guard. Don't go too close to the sign, try to figure out which lane you're supposed to go someway else, or you risk having a staff bark the orders at you.

As a tourist, there are better places to go and enjoy spending your money, and actually feel good spending it."
,,Amazing Trip,5.0,,"Marina Bay is one of the land mark at Singapore , dont miss it , and the view from 57th floor is wonderfull , specially the pool which is limited to the hotel guests"
,,Huge Casino. Tight Security. Too many Chinese.,4.0,,"Lets start by saying they are very tight on security, you need passport and you get checked upon entry twice and upon exit because apparently Singaporeans need to pay 100 SGD to get in, which is ridiculous, its 50£. Minimum age is 21 and they are strict on it, my friend was turning 21 in a week time and she couldn't enter.
The floor is huge, you almost get lost and they have all the games I can think of.
Minimum bets were reasonable, on roulette it was starting at 5 SGD although only 1 table had that.

Not to be racist, but there are a lot of Chinese, perhaps 90% and they take their game so seriously that it almost affects the global atmosphere. Hence why I didn't stay too long."
,,Great walk around,4.0,,If going to the casino make sure you take your passport. We arrived and had to go back to the hotel to get our passports as they have very tight security upon entering.
,,Disappointing for a seasoned gambler,2.0,,"No bars to purchase drinks from, only from a trolley vendor lady which was hard to locate. Minimum table for blackjack was $25. Security scan your passport upon entry and exit. Cigarette Smoke everywhere. Not worth the hassle. Better casinos in Vegas, Macau and Australia."
,,Worthwhile experience,5.0,,"Was visiting Marina Bay Sands with some friends. I had been to the Casinos twice in the past so I wanted to show them around and be their guide.
We had a wonderful time and they were quite impressed with the grandeur..we spent some money and had good fun, Entry was easy as we had our passports with us. We had free drinks and spent some good time.. it was worth it!!"
,,Fair Table Minimums on Weekdays,3.0,,"After reading several less than complimentary reviews of the Marina Bay Sands Casino, I almost didn't visit. I had several hours to burn by the Marina though, and since there was nothing else to do, I figured I may as well see for myself.

PROS:
- Extremely reasonable weekday table minimums. All the following in SGD: $10 roulette, $10 craps, $25 blackjack. This was a pleasant surprise, as other entries seem to indicate a $25 minimum. Note, I can't comment on weekend minimums.
- Contrary to some other reviews I read, there is craps at the casino. Two tables located near one of the main entrances.
- A separate, non-smoking gaming area that is very large.
- Multiple bank-branded ATMs located just outside the casino entrance. This is refreshingly different than the $5-10 fee ATMs one finds in Las Vegas casinos.

CONS:
- Security and passport check took several minutes. This will come as a shock to those who gamble in Las Vegas or more liberal casino locations.
- No free alcohol. There are multiple coffee/tea/water stations, but there is no free alcohol.
- The bathrooms were disgusting. 'm talking feces speckled toilet seats disgusting. I expect much better for a classy casino.
- In general, the Asian gambling crowd is much more serious than the typical Las Vegas patron (both dealers and fellow gamblers). In short, this can result in an extremely dry gambling experience. I expect to lose when I gamble (house edge folks), but I expect to enjoy the gambling experience and not feel like I am ""working"" to lose my money.

Overall, I will go back if I'm in Singapore and have time to burn near the casino. Certainly not worth a dedicated trip though, as I prefer gaming in both Las Vegas and Macau to Singapore, by far."
,,facility marina bay sands casino.,4.0,,"i went marina bay sands casino on june 2014. i've been there and i was enjoy. easy entering inside the casino,just show the pasport and they have locker to keep your belonging. available money changer. free bavarage. you can spent your time in there,because they open 24 hour."
,,What can I say....anothe casino.,3.0,,"It was kind of fun to loose a hundred dollars, but really, should one be doing this on vacation? If you ""have"" to loose some money go there, but really there are tons of other things to do in town. Do some of them."
,,Huge and busy,4.0,,It`s free to enter for foreigners but they check your passport not only when enter but at the exit too. The only indoor smoking area in Singapore
,,"marina bay, singapore",5.0,,The MRT train stops at marina nay. A short walk will take one to marina bay sands casino. It is a huge casino with no smoking on the top level. Smoking is allowed on the ground level
,,"marina bay sands casino, singapore",5.0,,centrally located at marina bay is the splendid casinos with many slot machines. I like the bank buster because it is a thrilling game with many restaurants and free mineral water
,,Fun -even for non-gamblers,4.0,,"Even a casual visitor can enjoy themselves here playing as little as 1$.If in doubt, ask the helpful, but busy staff.Read my review in the CEYLON TODAY newspaper, this week."
,,Very smokey but had fun,4.0,,"Went there to look around, look at other people gambling and played roulette, not the big money one, but rather the one where you can bet with only a few dollars one... It was fund and addicting. Won about a hundred dollars, felt happy and was able to stop myself from playing for too long and gambling too much :). Free drinks were helpful..."
,,Plenty of Options,4.0,,There are all sorts of gambling options here at this casino with helpful staff for anyone a bit nervous about what to do. What I didn't like was the fact that the main floor of the casino allows smoking
,,just bad,1.0,,"the place was filled with smoke, it was smokers heaven. as a non-smoker i just hated it and i found the place devoid of character. you'll be treated like an animal or criminal, need passport to enter and EXIT lol. and they'll also take a scan/copy of it as well. table minimums are very high and i saw so many people betting hundreds and losing thousands or more. go there only if you love to breath cancer-causing smoke and enjoy losing your money. NO ALCOHOL is available either (very boring) and staff had personality of a blank wall."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"This casino is an attraction, no matter if you decide to play or not. I have never seen so many gambling tables in one place !!! Theres a passport check before entering, make sure you have your travel passport with you, otherwise they wont let you in. You also have to drop your bags outside. Have a look, you will love it. Pictures are not allowed."
,,More than just a casino,4.0,,The casino makes up a small.part of this vast complex. This development is massive consisting of high end labels and the hotel.as.well.as.an.expo and convention centre. the shops include the.only lv outlet which is below water.and especially built for.lv
,,Expensive place,4.0,,The view from the bottom was nice as you can see the boat like top. I liked the fountains and the scenery of the city skyline. Overall quite enjoyable to be there for a day or two.
,,Nice casino with nice complimentary,4.0,,"I've been to some casino in Macau and I think this casino is nice one. Even it's not as big as Sands' casino in Macau, but still it's nice. They give you some free complimentary drink such as Milo, coffee, tea, water, etc. There's so many events which they held, such as baccarat tournament, doorprize, etc. But too bad, I think the minimum bet in here for table game is too high. The lowest minimum bet which I found in here is SG$ 100. I don't know there's really SG$ 100 the lowest minumum bet or I just didn't found it.
But still, it's a nice casino."
,,Casino,4.0,,As casino was nothing special the shopping in all the different stores around the casino made for a wonderful time..
,,Big casino with nothing very special,3.0,,"Very big casino inside Marina Bay Sands complex. Passport needed for entrance but for foreigners entrance doesn't cost anything. Strict security and lot of smoking, otherwise nothing special - includes all the casino playes, slots etc that you can think off and separate vip access rooms etc. If you like to gamble then worth a visit, otherwise perhaps not."
,,"Clean, and interesting to see",4.0,,"If you have a foreign passport on tourism purposes, you are allowed to enter the casino for free. I went in just to have a look, and thought it was quite interesting. The building is beautiful, and compared to Australia - it was amazing to see smoking is allowed on the gaming floors."
,,Rocking Time,5.0,,"Well I had been to casinos before but the casino at Marina Bay Sands is simply awesome. It has a great feel to it and is huge in size, with complimentary drinks."
,,OK if you are a hard core gambler,2.0,,"Disappointing visit, strict security doesn't allow bags to be taken inside, no photos allowed and passports scrutinised on entry, as soon as we entered the casino the smoky atmosphere was overwhelming, smoking is allowed inside the casino, unbelievable in Singapore! It seems if you are spending big amounts of money you are allowed to do whatever you want!
Didn't stay long before we left for the fresh air."
,,Satis,2.0,,This was ok to see but because we were not willing to pay the $100.00 entry fee due to our limited budget we did not get to see the inside of the Casino.
,,"""Nice Casino""",4.0,,I am not a good fan of Casino nor a gambler. I'm just curious what's inside the Casino and their interior design. It looks very good and I enjoyed it with friends. The only thing that we missed is we can't take picture inside because its prohibited.
,,Good for beginner,4.0,,"If you are in business trip or professional work in singapore and you want to buy excitement after work ,it is best place to do it.The place is clean,stuffs are friendly and atmosphere is trickling ."
,,Go! Gamble! Get out!,4.0,,"LIKE: location of this hotel's casino... u pass thru good shops and dont forget ur passports to get here.

NO FREE DRINKS HERE on ur table, LIKE LAS VEGAS/MACAU. YOU PAY FOR IT. Only water/tea/coffee & your own cigarettes u can smoke here.

Going in the night - one wud also expect some other entertainment like live music to get a change, but the group singing here, though good, sang slow, Jazz type numbers which makes (atleast me) drowsy. NO FOTOS ALLOWED TO BE TAKEN HERE. I found that very strange!"
,,Annoying rules that no one tells you about til you get there,2.0,,"Went here for my birthday, thought it might be a great day out but never got further then the lobby. My husband had an expensive camera with him and we were denied access because as they said ""no cameras allowed"" which is not true! It only applies to normal cameras but camera phones, ipads etc are all allowed into the casino with no hesitation.
So we went to deposit it and when it was done they asked for passports. Now, why would I walk around in Singapore carrying one of my most valuable items? No where did it say that I needed my passport until I got there and we were denied entry even though we offered to pay our way in.

We ended up having to go back to the hotel without getting in and by that time I was so fed up with it all that I didn't want to go back."
,,The HUGE CASINO,4.0,,"When I entered the place I saw only half of it. If you go further and see the down side you will see a another big world of Gamble , glamour and hope. people playing like its their only job. I have not seen any such big CASINO in life."
,,Don't Waste Your Time,2.0,,"OK, yet another high end shopping (looking) area. So crowded with folks who want to say ""they were there"". Went into the casino. So smoky you almost can't breath - very poor selection of slot machines. Would prefer going to the Casino on Sentosa Island. Then you get the opportunity to wait in a 20 minute taxi line to get away from this mess. Yuck."
,,"Clean, convenient and big casino",4.0,,"Casino area has separate floors like smoking floor, non-smoking floor, private play room...and more...
Casino is within shopping mall which is attached to MRT, many dining options so, very convenient. They also have baggage counter outside casino to deposit baggages you are carrying from handbags, cabin bags to suit cases...anything.
Casino also has restaurants inside casino which are not even expensive.
Al in all. Very nice place to visit."
,,Clean and big casino,4.0,,"The casino is very clean and huge. Many eateries can be found inside the casino and tourists enter for free whereas the locals have to pay a fee of $100.

Not many people around the casino though and free drinks can be found inside the casino like coffee. They will serve to your tables."
,,Marina bay sands casino is a cool place,4.0,,"Marina bay sands casino are cool, luxurious casino, great games of gamblings, recommended place to visit if you go to Singapore"
,,Nice shopping mall,4.0,,Shop for great brands. Very majestic looking mall. Try your luck at the Casino. Filled with Chinese Tourists who love to gamble!!
,,Its Humongous !,4.0,,Its an experience in itself ! The Casino is enormous to say the least. Everything is top notch quality. Very organised. And foreignors have to show their passports for entry...so do carry them along with u.
,,Nice Casino,4.0,,"Not a gambler, so didn't go in. But the entire building is huge and not crowded. I can bet that the Casino inside is well-organized and interesting."
,,Nice casino,5.0,,Been in the casino in Marina Bay. It was the big casino with many table. I played on the machine and it was broken 2 times. The only thing that I don't like was they playing really high bid there.
,,Oh I love it.,5.0,,I am so in love with Marina Bay Casino. The best place to chill out at night time. It's so happening and I loved it. Miss it so much. The restaurants there are great and the alcohol and beverage supplies are excellent. It looks epic. Love it and miss it everyday. Would visit someday soon.
,,Don't forget your passport,3.0,,"As a number of people have noted you MUST show your passport on entry and exit. Annoying but that is the rules. Downstairs you are allowed to smoke so head upstairs to the no smoking floor. We have been here before and note that the table minimum seem to have gone up. You used to be able to play poker for $5 minimum but these tables seem to be gone now. We played roulette - again minimum is $5, and upwards. Poker machines dint seem to pay out at all - unless you were betting big, so we went back to the roulette. The place is nothing special and quite hard to get to - entrance in the shopping mall if you come by MRT."
,,Fantastic Setting,4.0,,"Casino's location is superb, interior design great, table selection was good - but confusing - hard to find tables for specific games. Staff were direct but polite. I won over $100 which was nice of them too. Only problem is parking - I had a nightmare finding parking and using it with a foreign car (Malaysian). Ended up getting out of the car park and parking elsewhere."
,,Amazing Place to Be..,5.0,,Its an Amazing Place to be and one of the Biggest i have come across till now. Best part is Entry Free for Tourists.....
,,Casino,3.0,,"We decided to try our luck in the Casino on night, first impressions big place on two floors so we walked round first, lots of people smoking at the tables and machines not very inviting for non-smokers. Decided to have a meal upstairs in one of the restaurants which was very good and a reasonable price. Back to the tables won $35 and left too much smoke."
,,Well played !!,4.0,,"Interesting process to get in for the foreigners - free entry on passport display. This is also the bad part of the casino is that they have no control on the kind of people coming in. I had a good time specially since I won.. The dealers were average not too special. Overall you can visit this place if you visit the Marina bay sand.
try not to get too greedy once in.. step out once you win something ;)"
,,Worth for visiting but not gambling,4.0,,There are many unique games in Singapore. (I am from Macao) It is worth for a look inside the Casino. But the amount of every bet is too high.
,,Best casino in Asia,5.0,,"I have never been to Vegas, but in Asia I would safely say that the casino at Marina Bay Sands is the absolute best. Security is very good, and they do not allow daytrippers to roam around with their cameras. If you get caught taking photos then they will ask you to stop. Repeat offenders will be evicted.

There are multiple games and slot machines on the two floors of this immense casino. I personally do not know the rules for all these games, but I did enjoy the slot machines. Hotel guests can use their hotel key card to pay for the gaming, so there is no need to carry coins. However, please gamble responsibly.

There are a few eateries scattered around the lower level of the casino, such as a dim sum place, and a noodle bar, as well as a small counter selling sandwiches. Drinks are free to everyone in the casino on a self-service basis, so you can keep yourself well stocked up whilst you are playing the slot machines. Free bottled water is also distributed by staff at regular intervals."
,,silly process to get in,3.0,,"Not sure if it's their rule or Singapore government rule but you must have a passport to get in. They charge $100 if you don't have one or if you are a Singapore citizen. So you walk up give them your passport they look at it move you forward where you have to give it to someone else who scans it then you finally get it. The cage is right by the entrance so if you need to exchange money its pretty easy to do. They have free coffee and soft drink stations everywhere but they do not have any alcohol at least I could not find any anywhere.

The casino was quite large lots of table games and slot machines on the first level. Going down a level there is lots more table games. I believe there is probably more tables games here than any casino in Vegas. The place was packed so they must be doing something right. As we were leaving we had to have our passports scanned again. Not that big of a deal but had we not been prepared would have been annoying to come over just to have to leave again to go get the passport."
,,Does nothing for singapore,2.0,,"I have to admit this was my third and final approach to getting into the casino being refused on the last two occasions. The first because I did not have my passport, the second time because while I did my partner did not have his authority to enter singapore in his second passport.

I really don't know why I bothered. It is full of smoke - enjoy the future litigation!!.....and is totally no worth the effort.

If people are silly enough to want to look at this do yourself a favour - go to the Botanic Gardens, or the Zoo, anywhere else."
,,Excellent Casino to go to when in Singapore,5.0,,"Hi! I do not quite understand the exaggerated comments about inconvenience in entry to the casinos and all the talk about patrons being hassled by security etc. Not true any of it. I too was a little circumspect about going to this casino reading about the long lines and checks etc, but upon landing there for real, am sorry none of this is true. The entry is as smooth as ever. They check your passport that's all and do not cause you any inconvenience. Go to this Casino as i did and if you are lucky you might win some money too as I did. Its large, spacious, has tons and tons of roulette tables spread over 2 floors. above all i saw people win too here in this casino and that too tourists and not locals hence such winnings seem real too. Must go to and avoid getting discouraged by travelers commenting of entry hassles as the same is just not true. Go here!"
,,My first casino visits,5.0,,"Its my first time visits casino before visits in sentosa. Its very good place and ambience. Im not really like to play gamble. But the interiors, crowd, little luckiness, and free hot choco very entertain me. Luxury place!"
,,Literally stinks,2.0,,"I had always wanted to visit this casino as the building and surrounds are so spectacular.

After needing to show my passport as a Foreigner to two separate doorman three feet apart I was in.

What a spectacular room. Filled with smoke. People wearing shorts. More rubber thongs than covered shoes. People sitting with their unclipped cracked toe nails proudly on display as they had their feet up on the furniture while feeding their slot machine. The smell of cigarette was in everything - it stunk.

Glad I have seen it now as I will never go back."
,,Casino,5.0,,"I love to go there whenever I visit Singapore. The only thing I play are the slot machines. I won few times, but not a lot. It's just for fun :)"
,,Perfect Place!,5.0,,The sensation is awesome! You fell like you are the King of the Wolrd with the Buildings and the lights surounding.
,,Gigantic but looks cheap,2.0,,"Went to see the casino because we hadn't nothing else to do after 7 fantastic days in Singapore. I knew we probably would not meet 007 sipping shaken Dry Martini but still I was surprised how cheap and brassy it was. A huge arena crowded by elderly Asians who smoked and gambled furiously. Note that there are upper levels for non-smokers. Not so much to see if you are not into gambling.

Complimentary water bottles, soda and coffee served in disposable mugs. It kind of resonated what Marina Bay Sands hotel and surrounding mall is all about: a playground for wealthy and wannabe rich people who cannot afford to stay in the hotel. Too busy and tacky to spend quality time but definitely worth visiting."
,,OK for Casino but the shopping Forum and surrounds much better,3.0,,"Decided to call into the Casino on the Monday 3rd around 11.30pm night after attending a work ball at MBS since we were staying at MBS for a few days, the shopping forum is amazing and a great experience including the wonderful tea place where they serve you a tea from over 100 choices with food or yummy scones/cakes, had to go through a process to get into the Casino showing passports as the locals have to pay $100 SGD to get in to gamble.

Is mostly electronic gaming as opposed to lots of Roulette and gaming tables like you might see at Crown Casino in Melbourne. They do have card tables and the place seemed relatively quiet. Sadly not much can be said for the clientele, dropped a winning gaming voucher while watching the girlfriend play an electronic gaming machine, was $65 and the indian playing next door to us must have quickly picked it up as it hit the floor as no one else was near us where we were playing and I recalled him bobbing down to pick up something but initially though nothing of it, OH Well so much for honesty :-( At least in Australia there is more likely chance of someone making you aware you have dropped something and handing it to you.

I certainly wouldn't make a bee line for the Casino unless you are a keen Gambler and want to punt while you are in Singapore. otherwise there are plenty of other enjoyable things to do."
,,not worth visiting,1.0,,"Save your time and go visit the Botanic Garden, or the Skypark, or the Hawkers' markets. Or just ride the MRT around town.

It is a hassle to go in, it is a hassle to go out. You need to show your passport when you go in (inconvenient, but reasonable demand), you need to show them again when you go out (what?!)."
,,The best casino in Singapore,4.0,,"My 1st time entering a casino. And must to admit that I like this place better than the one in Resort World.
It's more grande and luxury.

But the fave part of me is the restaurant that open 24 hours and taste delicious. Plus the price is not to expensive.
One of my destination to meet friends in late night hour."
,,Big and nice,4.0,,"I stayed MBS hotel 4 days and everyday we went down this casino and had great fun. I've never been to Macau, but been to many casino in Asia. Among them this one was biggest and had nice facilities. I also visited casino which is in sentosa island. I can't remember the exact name of that resort. Pls don't go there. Nothing compared to this MBS casino. Also food in casino RST was good."
,,Enjoyable,5.0,,This is the first time i visited any casino. I was a really a god experience. their are many games to enjoy. One can really win but need to observe the game and then play
,,"Impressive, even if you don't gamble",4.0,,"Stop by and take a look around, it's worth your time, even if you don't make a bet. This place is huge. Amazing how much money is being bet. Table minimums are very high. If you aren't rich, better stick to machines. Nice to walk around the attached mall as well. Seeing many high end shops, restaurants."
,,Awesome view from the suite patio of the Garden,5.0,,"I sad a picture of Marina Bay Sands Casino and I told myself that I needed to see if for myself.
On November 13th 2013 I finally made it there. It's exactly like I was imagining like it will be.
The place was beautiful and awesome. The suite was so large and the view was out of this world.
I like it so much I end up staying 4 night there. The hotel had so much things to do, I end up just spend all my time hanging out around the area."
,,"Not a gambler, but fun to visit",3.0,,"Couldn't help but stop by the Marina Bay Sands Casino. Played one spin of Roulette and got out of there! It was impressive to see the size of the gaming floor, but we just don't have the stomach for gambling. Near as I could tell it was quite similar to Vegas casinos. If you're a foreigner, just remember to bring your passport."
,,Huge but Indians will not find all what they want,3.0,,"Yes foreigners get a free entry by only showing their passport, so make double sure that you carry your original passport when you plan to go here... that being said, Indians will not find some of the famous Indian Casino games which they are interested to play like in GOA casinos, you wont find games such as Bakra, or Casino war etc even when this casino is hugely huge still these interesting game tables are missing. that being said, it is just ok, but its hugeness is something one must go and see atleast once especially when the entry is free of cost. Enjoy."
,,Pretty ordinary,3.0,,"I visited the Marina Bay Sands Casino whilst staying in the hotel. I don't think I'd make a particular effort to return if it wasn't so convenient.

FIrstly, you feel that entry is tighter than immigration - you need your passport which they seem to spend a reasonable amount of time scrutinising. Even if you sign up for the member program (where you show your passport again) - the card is not sufficient for casino entry.

There is quite an extensive selection of table games, as well as hundreds (maybe thousands) of electronic machines. I found the machines to be quite hungry as you had to play significant quantities of credits to have any chance of returns. They range from 1/2c to high roller, but even the low end machine require 50 credits per spin to have any sort of chance. This means your experience could be over pretty quickly unless you have deep pockets - not great for someone more interested in entertainment as opposed to hard core gambling.

A great redeeming feature of this establishment is that they have separate floors for smoking and non-smoking. Don't think I would have lasted 5 minutes otherwise. Another good thing is the self-serve refreshments (soft drinks / tea / coffee / water) available around the casino floor periphery.

There are bill-breaking machines, but they seemed few and far between.

I didn't have a bad time here, but it's hardly something to write home about."
,,Night out...,4.0,,"Had a night out...ensure you take your passport to gain access...lower floor smoking & 2nd floor non-smoking. No bars, just drink service...Had a win so a good night"
,,Be lucky to win,5.0,,"The MBS Casino in 3 floors is a huge casino with lovable interiors and facilities compared to the only other Casino The resort world in Singapore. There are lot of gaming option, slot machines, table games, Electronic gaming tables, etc. The restaurants inside the casino have limited choice of food but Ok. Free beverages are supplied at all locations. Toilet facilities are good, neat and clean. Sickening thing is checking of identity feels more than emigration check. Anyways good time pass even if you do not want to gamble."
,,Clean and Not Overly Smoky,3.0,,"We enjoyed our casino experience but did not feel the need to spend too much time here. The Sands Casino was very clean, not overly smoky, and there were several places for free beverages. The dealers were not especially friendly but there is a good variety of table games and slots. We could not find a blackjack table starting at under $25."
,,casino and shopping,4.0,,the casino almost the favorite palce to try your luck :) then you can eat and shop in side the mall. branded item all are waiting for your cards.
,,I agree... Lacklustre!,2.0,,"Dull, boring and no atmosphere! Having your passport to go in and the thoroughly on the way out seems crazy coming from Australia!? So in other words, no passport and you won't get in."
,,Best View for Drinks,5.0,,"This is one of my favorite spots to visit when I am in Singapore. On a clear night, this is the best place to have a few drinks and see the entire country and a few others. It can be a little tight at the top on weekends. If you're open to it, it's a great place to meet people. Nothing is too far away in Singapore. From here you can head down to various clubs and restaurants. It's just a great place for a drink."
,,"Boring, limited machines, lacking atmosphere.",2.0,,"We visited for an hour whilst staying at MBS.
Entry is free for visitors to SIngapore, however locals are charged an entry fee in an effort to reduce problem gambling (smart idea). We were required to present passports to enter which were examined by Security. We knew about this prior to travelling but still have to wonder what business security have flicking through ourt passports for 2 mins before we enter. Anyway that's the way it was.
Upon entry the casino was nothing flash - large open gaming floors lacking atmosphere or pazazz. We had a couple of drinks (not cheap) and checked the place out. Indoor smoking was off putting and poker machine selection appeared limited. There are also no ATM's within the casino so if you realise you need some more money you need to exit the casino to find an ATM and then repeat the whole entry process once again. Very frustrating and offputting - either take enough cash in with you or be prepared to be mucked around if you want to donate more money to the casino.
Overall an unremarkable experience - would not be in any rush to return in the future."
,,Above-average casino,3.0,,"Just a really nice casino with above-average service. I love the drink stations everywhere, very convenient. I don't like the smoking inside, but what can you do?

For foreigners, don't forget your passport; they check on the way in and on the way out.

My cousin also used the cashier to exchange USD for local cash. Handy protip."
,,Free entry entices you,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Casino has 13 different game types. The approved gaming area at Marina Bay Sands is 15,000 square meters. Casino has more than 600 table games and there are a total of 2500 slot machines and electronic table games combined. Over 15,000 patrons can be accommodated across the four levels of the casino. They offer complimentary, non-alcoholic beverage service to guests playing table games or slot machines. Foreigners entry is free. They have to show their passport at entry and exit. Nice experience for a non player like me. Tried hands at one machine and lost some dollars. Free entry entices you. Kids not allowed. They can enjoy food and shopping at while you spend time in casino."
,,Massive shiny casino,4.0,,"I got the impression people in this casino took their gambling very seriously, there wasn't exactly a party atmosphere as you might expect. It is an enormous venue with every type of game or machine you could think of. We got in for free with our British passports, which was a bonus. It is set in a big shopping mall with every brand of luxury goods you can imagine, a good place to spend your winnings if you're in the money!"
,,Ridiculous!,1.0,,"It was easier to get into Singapore than to get into this crappy casino. The immigration at the airport only looked through your passport once but this casino had to check your passport at least 3 times. They checked your passport from front to back, and all the stamps from all the countries you had visited prior and to make sure all the “i”s were dotted and “t”s were crossed. And obviously all the guards who work there also work in prison. How else can you explain their rudeness?

They had me checked my backpack before I stood in line and I had to open the bag under the camera for inspection. Make sure I didn’t have any illegal underwear stashed inside. The women behind the counter were an unpleasant bunch. I guess they must be from another country because everyone I met in Singapore so far had been nice and helpful.

Once inside there were rows and rows of Baccarat tables and not many of other table games. No sure what attracted the people there because locals have to pay 100 dollars to get in. That was the first time I had ever heard of a casino charging an admission. That’s more expensive than Disney World except no cartoon character was going to come out to hug you and take a picture. Table minimum was 25 dollars plus. People were betting hundreds of dollars in one hand for no apparent reason. We looked around and didn’t see James Bond so we left.

On our way out they checked our passport again and I thought they would give us a stamp like we had visited another country but they just looked."
,,"Player vs. Banker, Player Wins!",4.0,,"Enjoyed the short 1-2 hour visit @ Marina Bay Sands Casino, as I won against the house in Baccarat.
Wonder if I'd have enjoyed it as much if I hadn't won?!

The good:
* Large, spacious & modern
* Free bottled water

The not so good:
* Smoking is permitted
* Unable to carry your bags in, you must cloak it
* Foreigners must present passport on entry (checked by serious guards, who flip through your passport as if you've committed a crime for travelling so much)
* Atmosphere is so serious (real gamblers, making or losing some serious money?!)

Worth a visit, if it's your first time & you enjoy putting one or two bets down.
Would I visit again?
Yes, to try my luck & hopefully win against the house!"
,,2 star service...,3.0,,"We have been to the restaurant on our holidays about 3 months ago. We had such lovely time and the food was just great. Especially having this kind of view and atmosphere is just fabulous to dine and spend an evening.

Being back in Singapore I have recommended this place to eat out with our friends which turned out to be a disaster. We have booked our table at 9:45pm and our friends have ordered the set menu. The food was beautiful but the dishes were all served so quick and the waiters did not coordinate when the courses were finished. It was just ridiculous and unprofessional. The waitress even tried at one point to squeeze the plates on the table while there was barely any space as the other dishes were not finished. If you are not able to accommodate guests at a later time then simply don’t take the booking. On top of that is was a Saturday night!

As we arrived around 10 minutes later than our friends we have ordered separate appetizers and main courses than them. Everything seemed to work well during the appetizer until the waitress picked up our plates and then put our used chopsticks right on the table. Really? Saying this is a ‘high-end’ restaurant they could changed the chopsticks rather than putting them straight on the table where who knows how many people have been dining on.

Then we received our main course…. We were first served one main course and the other one was only served more than 5 minutes waiting time. They were lucky that at least the food was delicious. Our side dish arrived AFTER we have finished the main course (which has been also charged for) AND after asking for it twice. Thank you for that! No point of eating it after we were done with the main courses.

We also had a bottle of wine which only served after having our glasses empty twice for 10 minutes…

I don’t even want to mention the desert.

In the end we were trying to make contact for about 15 minutes with anyone to get our bill and then started waiving – no one came. The restaurant was basically empty! So we had to go to the bar and ask for the bill… It’s really a joke for a restaurant like this having a ridiculous service that just questions all the rest.

Nevertheless, as the bar is impressing their guests with its stunning view we have decided to enjoy a cocktail before going home. The cocktails are nice as they always are but we were standing in front of a grumpy cashier throwing pens around and being a you know what to her colleagues. Just unprofessional!

Would be a shame if you don’t invest in proper training in customer service."
,,Worst casino of the world.,1.0,,Worst casino of the world.staff is very rude and they don't know how to behave with people from other countriesz
,,Some More Pics of the Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"Some of the pictures that I missed to post in the last post. I have been to these place before boarding the the star Virgo. Marina Bay Sands is Asia’s most spectacular entertainment destination, located at the heart of Singapore’s CBD, with over 2,500 hotel rooms & suites, casino, restaurants, entertainment, meeting & exhibition facilities, theaters, luxurious shopping and the one & only Sands Sky Park, new experiences await you at every turn"
,,Things to consider before visiting the Marine Bay Sands Casino,1.0,,"1) You need to cloak your backpack and camera before trying to enter the casino. The staff behind the cloak room were unfriendly. Do not dare to ask them a question.
2) You need to have your Passport on you to gain entry. Why? Locals have to pay a S$100 charge to enter the casino. The security guards checking the passports are rude individuals who treat each visitor as though they are attempting something illegal. Becareful as they go through your passport that your immigration card does not fall out. The guards do not seem to care if you lose the card or not. The queue's can be quite long.
3) Smoking is allowed everywhere within the casino. Sitting on either side of me at the Rapid Roulette machine were two heavy smokers. I lasted less than 2 minutes. Smokers are at the pokers machines, tables, drink machines and even rest rooms.
4) Free water and soft drinks throughout the casino at certain spots.
5) Very crowded overall. The casino is immense, but the crowds were even bigger. People bumping into you.
6) No where to sit and observe. Therefore people were sitting at poker machines to take a breath, or rest or people watch.
7) You need to show your passport on exit. Again the security guards treat you as though you have something to hide and go through your passport - page by page - for no apparent reason. Once again make sure that your immigration card is still in your passport."
,,A good base for a day trip- easily accessible by MRT,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Area is a recent development in Singapore.

It is readily accessible by MRT (the Singapore underground train system) and it offers a wide array of attractions, catering for a broad range of interests.

First of all, there is the Sands Casino and Hotel. Remember, if you want to visit the Casino as a foreign tourist, you will need to bring your passport to gain entry.

Then, adjoining the Casino is a large mall of shops, cafés and restaurants, including several celebrity restaurants.

There is a theater within the Casino complex: check what show is on for your entertainment.

Alongside the Casino is an interesting art museum, offering a range of exhibits.

Nearby, there is the Gardens By the Bay- spread over 101 hectares. You could easily spend a half day to an entire day there.

In summary, it presents a whole array of attractions for the visitor to Singapore."
,,Don't lose your shirt!,3.0,,"Visited the Casino a couple of weeks ago. Haven't been to one in a long time. Glad I went. First, people who are not from Singapore get in free, while those from Singapore pay $100. There's a lesson in there somewhere for us foreigners..! In order to verify, you must present your passport. Very strict. My colleague had a driving licence, and lots of other ID, but not his passport - he was not getting in..! The casino is absolutely massive. It looks like something out of a Bond movie. It was a very serious atmosphere, which I was quite surprised at.. Of course, gambilng is a serious business - but I expected to see more people like myself - people who at least appeared to be there just for the experience and a little fun. Rather, there were hundreds of hard core gamblers in the room. We stayed for an hour, lost a small amount of money in the meantime, and then went for dinner.
Would I recommend it? I guess I would, if you've never been to a casino and are interested in the experience. It's also clearly a good location for the serious player.
I hesitate only because I'm not a fan of gambling as such. I can easily see how we could have lost a LOT of money in a very short period. The odds are stacked against the player - we didn't forget that."
,,Not worth the wait to go in!!!,2.0,,"If you are planning to go, just remember to not have your backpack with you, carry your passport and have enough money on you, as the queue's to get in can be rather long( i waited over an hour to get in) and if you do have a backpack, put it in the cloak room before joining the queue. The casino was packed when I finally entered, drinks are expensive at the bar's but you can get a bottle of water, just look for the unattractive pile of bottled water at the end of the banks of pokie machines. While it looks impressive to look down on all the baccarat tables from the upper level, visually the casino as a whole is not that impressive at all."
,,Wonderful area to spend time,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands hotel, casino and shopping plaza, alongside the Art Science Museum are amazing. It is worth paying to go to the 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands hotel to overlook Singapore - not for anyone with vertigo!"
,,Save S$100 for being a foreigner,3.0,,"You have to check your bags and cameras before entering through the security checkpoint. Make sure to bring your passport; otherwise you won't be able to get in. Local residents have to pay a daily ""levy"" of S$100 to get in. So it's nice to be a ""foreigner"" in this case. Inside the massive casino, enjoy the free drinks and coffee that are available throughout the floors. Then marvel at the numerous high-limit tables and throngs of people who all seem to know what they are doing (er, I mean gambling). The place does not have much fun atmosphere like in Vegas. People here are too serious and need to relax. Hey it's only money."
,,Priceless experience,5.0,,"Its a priceless experience @ Marina bay sands. The outer view, the conference halls and the food .. Everything is top class. Its undoubtedly that place one shouldn't miss to see in Singapore. If possible, the roop top visit is a MUST."
,,Marina bay casino,3.0,,"If your planing to go to the casino, be aware that you can't get in if you are a visitor to Singapore without your passport, we were a bit pissed of as no one told us and of course you don't take your passport out of the hotel if you can help it"
,,the luxury place,5.0,,"walking around, shopping, food tester or try to play at their casino is almost the time very fast during there. you will feel really like a big player at casino, they will service you with their free flow drink with no charge at all. you have to try this place if you are at Singapore, otherwise you will feel less somthing."
,,"If there was a minus rating for this one, I'd give it!",1.0,,"We just wanted to have a flutter at the end of a great day in Singapore.....it was still a great day, notwithstanding the knob who didn't allow us entry into the Casino because we didn't have our passports with us. I have now read other reviews and fully agree with those that give this ""attraction"" an unfavourable rating....the manners of Mr F.U, at the Marina Bay Sands Casino version of Checkpoint Charlie ( clearly trained in the 1930's German school of Border diplomacy), were reprehensible. Upon informing me that all Foreigners were required to produce a passport to enter the casino, he immediately shuffled us out of the queue as if we were being evicted for some wrong doing. I have now read an explanation for the passport requirement, something about locals needing to pay $100 for entry (an attempt to prevent locals becoming addicted to gambling! Really? Don't open a casino if you are that concerned about your population, who for the most part have been delightful....from the taxi driver to the restroom attendant)....Anyway, I'm done now, over it, and I hear the odds are really stacked against you at this one....sooooo I will write some nice reviews about our delightful 3 day stopover in Singapore....really an amazing city."
,,Free Entry for Visitors,4.0,,"To visit the Singapore Casinos you MUST take your passport AND the dress code has to be adhered to.
Smart Casual. Long Trousers and collard shirt minimum.[ The locals have to pay $100 sg to enter and that lasts for 24 hours.] They have smoking floor if thats your desire as well as non smoking floors.
A reasonable selection of food that across the board is ""average"". There are fancier places to eat at the Marina. The Casino uses bar coded tickets once you have first payed to enter the game. As go go around you simply insert the ticket for your credits. Far easier and convenient than carrying coins around.
Similarly if you are lucky enough to actually have a credit on your ticket you insert that into a payout machine and it pays cash."
,,"Beautiful, not too smoky. Bring your cash and your passport",5.0,,"To regulate local Singapore residents from becoming addicted to gambling, the casino requires proof of residency. Foreigners must have a passport to enter. There are several floors of table games and slots. The high rollers get to gamble in private rooms. There are three very fancy restaurants inside.
Remember, everyone speaks English on staff. That's very helpful.
Unlike Las Vegas casinos, don't expect strippers on the bar or blaring loud music. The players here come for one thing: to gamble.
Once you win big, you'll have no trouble blowing your money on some of the most exquisite and expensive European and American shops right outside the casino."
,,Noisy and lacking any charm,2.0,,Getting into the casino is harder than airport security. And once inside you find there are no ATM's! You've got to go back outside to an ATM and then go through the security all over again. There is no food available except at a restaurant and getting a drink wasn't easy either. It's all business - you play the tables and slots and you either win or lose. Not a lot of fun I have to say.
,,Las Vegas Casinos are much better.,3.0,,"Gorgeous atmosphere. Most Guests were Chinese. They were some kind of coarseness. I think minimum bet was too expensive. So I spent over $100 within one hour. I still love Casinos in Las Vegas, USA. I wonder I'll visit there again."
,,Horrible staff not friendly,1.0,,I visited the casino just to look around. Was so put off with how cold the dealers were at the tables. Will never go back here again when visiting Singapore. Don't understand how they could get return guests.
,,Casino,3.0,,"The casino is in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. There are 2 lines one for residents and the other for foreigners. Identification must be presented in order to get into the casino. There are 2 levels. The 1st fl. is smoking and the 2nd fl. is non smoking. There are more table games than slot machines. There is free water, coffee and tea. We didn't stay long and went during the weekday."
,,Not a Casino but a factory,1.0,,"The place is massive, resembles a factory. 100's of table games. but if you're are a Black Jack player you may not like it, All cards are machine dealt. no hand shuffle.
They don't seem to provide private tables and the staff I asked didn't appear to give a toss.
Main punters are Malaysian pensioners, you can see them come by the bus loads.
And BTW there are no waitresses or serving staff, you have to get your own drink."
,,Casino not much chop,2.0,,"The casino in the Marina Bay Sands was a complete let down. As an overseas visitor you have to show your passport. The security guards flip through your passport looking for who knows what. They showed more interest in it than the Malaysian Customs officers when I crossed the border. No bar, no food, no service. Casinos are pretty boring at the best of times. This takes the cake."
,,Singapore Casino Complex and Hotel.,5.0,,all you need to say is WOW .we were only there for half a day.you could spend all day looking and shopping.keep away from casino and visit the gardens.
,,"Kudeta Skybar, Marina Sands, Singapore",5.0,,What a great place to go for a drink and a snak. The view is amazing with the atmosphere one of the best around the world. Anytime is a good time to visit - just make sure it is a sunny day because they make you go inside where there is no view if it rains despite very serviceable cafe unbrellas which cover each lounge :(
,,stay there if you can afford it.,5.0,,"only got to visit but the view was out of this world. Must go to the viewing platform. do it at night if you can. inside the hotel is great. also next to it is many sights like the flyer, the bay and the shopping center. You could spend several days in this area."
,,nice place to visit,4.0,,It is a really big casino! Don't forget to bring your passport and don't try to go in there if you are not 21 yet ;)
,,A complete waste of time in Casino.,1.0,,"The Casino at MBS is probably the worst Casino (in terms of standard & service unless you are fogreniers I guess.)I've been too. It totally ruined my day with my family. Firstly being a residence here, this is my first time stepping into the Casino and how are we suppose to know how it works? The guard didnt explain about purchasing the levy, instead he SHOUTED at us to tell us off and attend to the fogreniers in a obvious nicer way.

Mood was ruined by the rude guard. We manage to get into the Casino but was disappointed again. It was small and cramp! Compared to Genting Highland, they have lesser choice and the slot machines are not fun.

A complete waste of time."
,,just ok,3.0,,"smokey, even on the non-smoking floor as the smoke rises. Games not as fun as Vegas, but I'm not a big gamer."
,,Casino is not big but well design,4.0,,"Is located in Marina Bay, Singapore and the casino is not big but the interior design is nice and beautiful. Food stalls are easily available at the corner and there are a few restaurants too but the number of games seem to be quite limited. The problem is when entering and going out, they need to check the passport for foreigners. For permanent resident and singaporeans need to pay a levy of S$100 per entry for a day visit. Anyway, is worth a visit especially to this Marina Bay Sands."
,,It is easier to get into some countries than this crappy casino.,1.0,,"This review is about the casino only.

This casino is as far removed from a vegas casino as you can get. (or any casino for that matter)

As a non resident you will need to queue up like airport immigration to have your passport checked just to enter this casino (it is even worse for residents who must pay a $100 entry fee!) Once inside you are greeted with a very average casino, full of smoke and no alcohol is available. Decor drab and machines and tables dull. Oh, you will also need your passport to leave!!

Unless you absolutely must gamble, stay clear of this place, you are not missing anything."
,,Great if you have the bucks!,4.0,,"I hope the architect won a prize for the design of this place.

It’s massive, well thought out and worth a visit. Please note we did not spend the $400+ per night to stay here.

The food court is located on the northern end of the ground floor and it also has a skating rink if you want to lose the kids for a while. Asian and Western foods are available. Finding a seat in peak times is a hassle though.

If you have lots of bucks to spend this is the place for you. For us sightseers you could spend 1-2 hours looking through the complex and the lobby of the hotel.

Well worth a look."
,,Las Vegas in Singapore,4.0,,"Like some reviewers have been mentioning here, the guards at Marina Bay Sands scrutinized my passport more than the immigration officers in any country i’ve been. They would check your passport going in and coming out too.....is it a country on it’s own? I did not play in the casino because I told my family to meet at a certain place in an hour. The casino did not have my kind of game and I was just there to check the place out, I was planning on returning that night but never did. The floor space and plan reminds me of Las Vegas. It was very noticeable that this is an upper scale casino and the shops outside confirmed it. I had a complimentary coffee from a very helpful and accommodating server...she even answered some of the questions I had."
,,Awesome stay!!,5.0,,i stayed here for 3nights wish i could have stayed longer.the bar on the roof top and sky park pool are so amazing.pool get quite crowded at times but view in the morning is to die for .Absolutely Beautiful!!
,,Just another casino.....,2.0,,"Security is a joke and way too serious. The guy who checked my passport scrutinized it more than a US airport. What are they expecting here, this is Singapore, people are already under control. Nothing special inside, just another place to lose $. The rest of the complex is great but wouldn't worry about going back inside the casino."
,,Worth the visit even if you're not a gamer,4.0,,"MBS Casino is definitely the better of the two casinos in Singapore, although the smoking aspect may put some people off visiting and seeing this casino. Be sure to take your passport with you otherwise you won't make it past the security checkpoints. The size of the gaming areas is quite impressive but the reserved atmosphere may not be to everyone's liking. I ate at one of the internal restaurants (can't remember the name) and the food and service was excellent."
,,good place for foreigner (free drink),5.0,,"i like the atmosfer of gambling, the non smoking room is really clean and neat, people are very nice even i don't gambling ^_^"
,,WOW,4.0,,"What an amazing place, as mentioned below you need your passport to get in and even more strangely they check it as you are leaving as well. Also no pictures allowed at all, a few times the couple we were with took their camera out and security were immediately over.... eyes on everything. overall a great casino with a huge variety of games."
,,Another casino....,3.0,,Great casino - huge is the word! Take your passport or you won't be allowed in and leave it in your hand as their is at least 3 checkpoints before you gain access to the floor!
,,Casino it is...,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is a new addition to the skyline of Singapore. A very creative and impressive architecture by ifself, Featuring a boat shaped roof supported by three stud which housed the rooms, restaurant and shopping complex within sitting on the edge of the bay. Housing the casino, which is a favourite pastime and livelihood for some people in there. As you walk in, the security will check you whether you are a foreigner or local, I guess there is a levy for the local. Inside, there are hundreds of welcoming dealers waiting for you to come to their table to try your luck, in baccarat or money wheel or a game of poker. There a few floors of the casino, but for a person like me who doesn't gamble it a monotonous to see all the tables. No doubt it looks very cosy with think carpeted floors. A place to try your luck."
,,awesome!,5.0,,"been here last november of 2012.to get inside you just have to show your passport...the place is really huge! carpeted floors, polite crew, airconditioned halls.. inside they serve free coffee and bottled water. unlimited for free!"
,,Huge casino - lacks atmosphere,3.0,,"There is no charge to get into the casino - don't forget your passport. Its not in Marina Bay Sands Hotel but across the road in the Mall. I've not been to Las Vegas but have been to Macau and I thought it would be along the lines of those casinos - some of them are out of this world. This casino is huge, staff very helpful but just a bit disappointing - the decor and layout.

You have to visit it though just to see it."
,,Great place,4.0,,"When you want to try your luck,then this casino was one of the best choice...great place, nice architecture! When you get in to casino, your family can visit the mall... Free flow coffee and tea, coke and sprite... Smoking area... About the casino themself...hm...it's depend on your LUCK! Hahahahahahaha...."
,,god !!,4.0,,one of the best hotel.casino i ever benn n seen .lovely place i'll go to visit again ..lol may i swimm on the roof loll?
,,Wouldn't go back here,2.0,,"Basically an elaborate gambling hall ... the smell of tobacco is horrible through the complex and the machines are so loud. First time we went we didn't realise we needed our passports so just for the fun of it we went back with our passports. You would have thought this was an airport and we were criminals. First we had to check our umbrella in where copious paperwork was filled out, then our passports were checked twice! Not worth a visit."
,,Take your passport!!,3.0,,"We visited the casino proper during our afternoon/evening around Marina Bay. No backpacks allowed (however we did see some rather large handbags being allowed in). I'm not sure what the difference is what I could have had in my backpack would have easily fit into some of these handbags! A double standard in my eyes. Passport are needed for the door staff to identify you as far as I'm aware to distinguish you from the locals who have to pay a tariff to enter as opposed to a foriegner who does not.

Upon entry the place had a WOW factor but after walking in and around we became a little disappointed.

* No outlet available to purchase a beverage (needed to ask floor staff to bring you one so we just stood in the middle of the gaming floor as we were not able to sit at any of the tables due to us not playing). $20 SGD for a draught beer (approx 350ml and a 170ml wine).

* The cigarette smoke was a deterrent

* We found the staff that we encountered could have been friendlier

* Casino lacked atmosphere

All the latest gaming machines around and very large inter-active gaming with sic-bo, roulette and blackjack all available. High roller suite upstairs and at the time of our visit during March an area on the ground floor was under re-furbishment.

We are happy we paid the MBS Casino a visit but would not hurry back, based on the above."
,,Worth trying your luck,5.0,,"I went here with my friend, we were waiting for other friends, and why not try her luck in the casino. Entry is free, to start playing with little amount of money. However, for foreigner must bring passport. She is famous for her luck, so I just sat by her when she played roulette, apparently she was lucky enough to win. The place is very comfortable, so why not try your luck there? I recommend this."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Entry for foreign tourists is free. you need to show your passport at the entrance. enrty restricted below 21yrs of age. wear smart casuals,beach wear including flip flops, slippers, casual short pants and sleeveless shirts are not allowed - wear shoes ."
,,Incredible,4.0,,"You have to spend 1 day from your itinerary SIN holiday to go this place..lots of game you have to try..lots of photos you have to take..lots of energy will be needed. Always Carry some juices as well as water a Sun P Cap. Go by monorail if u want to experience,entry tickets can be purchased on line,enter via holywood at new york enjoy the theater show at sci-city ride the saucer ride the 4 d show is superb,canopy ride treasure hunt,watershow street characters and music and dance performance if u r fit enough roller coasters variety of food courts shopping what not a whole day whole some enjoyment.rush there."
,,Impressive,4.0,,"Easily accessed from the MRT (XX station), everything is well signposted to get you to the casino. After the obligatory double ID check (foreigners get in free - locals pay S$100) of your passport, you get in and can start gaming straight away if you choose. It was very busy although not as bad as the Venetian at Macau. There were still planty of seats at tables to be had (visited around 8pm on a weekday). Good selection of games: Blackjack, Hold'em Poker, Three Card Poker, Baccarat, Craps, Slots and Roulette. Table minimum stakes vary, cheapest I saw was S$10, but went up to S$100 on some tables. Complementary tea, coffee, water and soft drinks available at the various refreshment stations.
Overall, nice and airy, good atmosphere and worth a visit."
,,Is it an Airport or a Casino?,2.0,,"Passport required to get in. They will literally scrutinize your picture with a magnifying glass to see if your passport is not a fake one and has not been altered. I have never seen my passport being checked out so carefully, even in all airports I did in the world. Entrance is free for Foreigners and there is a cover fee for Locals. Once inside, you have all the slot machines you can imagine. Almost all games have been virtualized, even the Poker and Black Jack tables, on which you don't even play with real cards. You have a small selection of free sodas and hot drinks. Overall, it's just an average casino which might not be worth spending more than 1 hour, unless you are addicted at gambling."
,,Certainly one of the biggest casinos I've ever seen.,3.0,,"Inside the Mall of Marina Bay, not hard to find it, just ask one of the many staff members.
Entering is almost as easy as in any Casino you must be the age of majority or is asked to show an ID. The Interior is remarkable, a disarming number of gambling tables at each corner, opened not only at night but also during the daylight hours, but of course in the evening is the time in which the casino is more crowded.
I don't know how I did but via an elevator located nearby are up and I could see the casino from above and I was really amazed and speechless by the beauty and greatness."
,,"If you expect to see personality and entertainment in this casino that is anything like you might see in Las Vegas, you'll be di",2.0,,"There was a serious security process required to enter the casino. I had my passport checked twice on entry and once when leaving. It didn't seem welcoming at all.

It's all about expectations. Inside, it was not what I'd been expecting. Perhaps I've been spoilt by the personality, entertainment and style of Las Vegas casinos, but there was definitely (in my opinion) something lacking here. In my opinion, this casino is not for the casual player (someone who might get drawn in by flashing lights and fun), the people watcher or those who want the fun atmosphere of Las Vegas. This casino is not for me.

I've rated ""Value"" highly because I entered for free."
,,Average casino,3.0,,"Impressive architecture. Passport required when entering the casino for foreigner. Beverages like hot chocolate and water are provided FOC inside the casino. Limited games in the casino. Restaurant are too overpriced. There are some luxury brands shopping area outside the casino. Overall, worth a visit if you're into gambling or else just enjoy the ambience."
,,A racist casino,1.0,,"If any body thinks that racism is diminishing in today's world, well, think again. This casino rejected my entry just because of my nationality. The security guard told me after he checked my passport, ""you are Syrian, and this company has nothing to do with your nationality, so your cant enter"", when I called the manager, he said its just because this is an American company, and he insisted that I can't enter, even when I explained, and m passport shows that I'm frequent visitor to U.S.A. A casino that reject or accept business based on customer's nationality doesn't deserve other than a review of ""terrible"". The good thing is that there is another casino is Singapore, and I had a great time there, the name ""Resort World"", try that place instead."
,,what a night.....,5.0,,"just finish meeting with a client and decided to have a drink in marina bay sands kudeta, since it my last day today i will never forget my experience last night i was pissed with my client decision and surely i might not get that account, so i just relax my mind and order, one of the waiter assist me ask for a drink i admit i was so rude ordering my cocktail but since i have to relax and forget what happen with my client decision i will take a deep breath to release my bad mood... then i just amaze with this waiter assist me in a good manner even i shouted at him at first for not giving me anything to eat, but he handles me in a professional way. i will never forget the name IVO R treating me so special last night with his unlimited smile that was the best service ever had and surely recommend to friends and family's who will go to Singapore in future."
,,"well, don't like their Texas Poker table...",3.0,,This is just about Texas Poker. They don't have big area for this game and the rules are different from what I played in Macao that you play against players rather than just the dealer.
,,Not enjoyable,2.0,,"Initially walking in the 4 stories is impressive.

Thats where it ends.

The slots are all the same. Theres no variety in the type of games. The tables are ok, but really crowded so it's rough to actually play comfortably. The fact that smoking is allowed on the gaming floor meant that there was a thick cloud of cigarette smoke hanging above each level. After 45mins I felt nauseous.

The resturaunts there are extremely overpriced as well.

I won't go back."
,,"Its a casino, nothing more.",3.0,,"Security is needed. And laws require passport checks in and out of casinos here. Here is how I win. Walk around and see the sights nearby, then walk though the casino and pick up some free water and coffee."
,,This casino needs a personality makeover!,1.0,,This has to rank as the worst casino I've ever set foot in! Lets start with the passport security checks to get in and out!; very rude security that doesn't exactly encourage visitors; outdated slots; and you can't even get an alcoholic drink on the casino floor.
,,Sunset hour,5.0,,"Pretty cool spot a top the hotel. Sunset colors are going into night lights is cool for pictures. Once the sun drops it can get chilly. Pricey beers, but its worth a round. 360 degree views."
,,not bad for Asia - but still too expensive for most,3.0,,"I guess the cost of real estate cannot allow the operators in Singapore to set up tables with minimum bets to cater to a large crowd. As a tourist, with 18 hours to blow between flights, I planed to spend at the casino $300 tops, This is nearly an impossible task. No poker rooms, the only one in Singapore is at Sentosa and the blinds there are 5/10. The only ray of light for me was some good old fun at the roulette table with $2 minimums."
,,Marina Bay Sands : Best Gaming Casino in Singapore.,5.0,,"Hi everyone out there.
Since Chinese New Year this year 2013.
I have the most wonderful experience playing at MBS Casino.
It's not always about winning or losing money.
What blows me away...It's their ""WOW"" Customer Service factor.
Watch out for these following staff if you happens to be there playing Baccarat.
They are :
Ash (Pit Supervisor)
Michael (Pit Supervisor)
Teong Hin (Pit Supervisor)
Marc (Dealer)
Hu FuShun (Dealer)
Albert (Dealer)
May (Dealer)
Daniel (Dealer)
Ci Ci (Dealer)
Ann (Dealer)
Sean (Dealer)
Ken (Dealer)
Joanna Beh (Dealer)
Desmond (Members Rewards Counter)
Aaron (Security Supervisor)
and lots more...
And of cause I am sure there many other staff in other gaming areas like roulette , sic bo...etc etc ... that will make your gaming fun.
They smile when you win and best of all they are sad when you lose.
Even when you are looking for a chat while playing...they will still entertain you and will talk to you while dealing cards.
I don't really know how MBS manage to engage these staff...lots of empathy and they don't shows signs of stress.
Well done MBS.
10 STARS.

,,Den of Iniquity,1.0,,"Yes, don't visit this den of iniquity. Pointless exercise in throwing away money. But this takes lots of time as you have to go through the rigmarole of exchanging cash for chips, then playing those chips, then losing those chips. Seriously, if the odds are with punters, casinos would go out of business yesterday."
,,Welll seems ok,4.0,,"Dont know much about gambling, i was just intrique by seeing this casino, show my passpory and just go inside.... for a while only though since i dont really want to gamble away so i only take a peek at this one"
,,Very nice place,4.0,,"Enjoyed the view from the top of the Hotel and had a look at the Casino. A must see, for everybody who travels to Singapore."
,,Nothing like Macau or Vegas,4.0,,The casino was average with a lot of Slot machines (ranging from 2Cents). The entry is free for foreigners but the securities check your passport before entering the casino. The casino was crowded and the ambience was OK. The only good part is the free drinks (Tea/Coffee/Milo).
,,a good way to lose money...,3.0,,"a good and an easy way to lose money.. ;) have been there a few times, and lost money on more than one occasion.. but yes, worth to been once..as the setting is nice, and the casino is really really huge.."
,,Never again,2.0,,"The sheer volume of people coming and going to this hotel make it a chaotic place, never again would we stay here. Very expensive with no atmosphere while the room was non descript. After six telephone calls, the concierge finally delivered our bags after 90 minutes.

The roof top swimming pool and the Ku De Ta lounge are the best features of this hotel. Even though the lounge was very busy the hostess slotted us into a table.

Buffet breakfast is like Grand Central Train station, reams of people, staff trying to keep up by refilling dishes with very average food.

Sands Bay Marina no doubt can operate effectively in the casino business but they need to hire more professional managers and staff to run this hotel to a standard relative to the price charged."
,,Casino,4.0,,"Large open casino at the Marina Bay complex. Foreigners must show their passport on entry and exit. Bottom level is for smokers, upper level is non smoking. Slot machines galore from 2 cents and up, possibly others but I did not see all I am sure. Was very crowded on a Friday night as expected, it was Chinese New Years weekend. Sadly I did not walk away a big winner but enjoyed it all the same. Nothing overly special about this casino."
,,Free drinks,3.0,,"The good points:
- free drinks (soft drinks and coffee, milo and tea)
- nice view over the first floor from the second floor
- clean toilets
- no entrance fee for foreigners

The annoying points:
- although it appears to be non-smoking on the second floor it still smells like smoking
- passport required and thoroughly checked when entering and leaving (ours was checked altogether 3 times)
- double standards on gambling (offer it and make you feel like a criminal - you will know what I mean when you visit)

I am anyway not into gambling but unlike Las Vegas the feeling is that one is not welcome. Obviously many feel different because the place was quite busy when we have been there. However it is just another casino.
For the free drinks I will go back again next time. ;-)"
,,Interesting design but its just another casino,3.0,,"After spending an afternoon seeing Gardens by the Bay, my wife and I walked to the Marina Bay Sands. From the outside, the structure was impressive. Once inside, it is just another casino. Since we live in California and visit Las Vegas often, we've seen our share of new and creatively designed casinos. The difference between the Marina Bay Sands and Las Vegas casinos is that there are many more table games and fewer slot machines. There are also two floors instead of the single floor design of most Las Vegas casinos. We had to check in our day pack at a holding area (but not my wife's smaller purse) and show our passports twice before entering. I was also told to either take off my baseball cap or wear it backwards for security purposes. These security measures are a hassle and thankfully absent in Las Vegas. We skipped paying the $20 per person to go up to the Skypark. The Marina Bay Sands may be a big attraction in Singapore but compared to Las Vegas, it's just another casino."
,,What a place aah !!!!,5.0,,One of the best casino experiences ever at this place .... Certainly a place to be in for all who love gambling ... Must visit for all atleast once .
,,A pleasant hour,3.0,,"This casino is like Fort Knox to get in to. Our passports were examined no less than 4 times. That is a strategy guaranteed to make patrons feel like criminals, before they've even got into the casino! I've never had that level of scrutiny in any casino anywhere in the world.
Once inside it is typical of casinos world wide. However, that said, they do provide free beverages, and the air con is most welcome after the sodden humidity of steamy Singapore in the rainy season.
I recommend this venue if you have an hour or so to kill in Singapore, and oh yes, the casino is located in a lovely shopping mall, full of delicious designer stores.....!"
,,Casino Visit,5.0,,"This is a very nice, high class casino, the only downside is there is no non-smoking gaming area and with the huge number of PRC Chinese there, they a big smokers as well as big gamblers..."
,,New and Big Casino,5.0,,"I went to this casino just to see it is very big because my friend told me that it is a big and brand new casino. And the decoration is very nice and beautiful. Beside that, this is a new building and the toilet is great and clean."
,,"Large, mostly smoking, but free hot Milo!",3.0,,"You need to bring your passport to get in for free as a foreigner. Locals have to pay, presumably to deter them from gambling, but I guess some love it enough that they are willing to fork over the fee.

I didn't think it was appropriate to take photos inside, so I don't have any pics of this place. Looks similar to Bellagio or any other large casino in Las Vegas though.

They have dispensers along the sides for free hot water, Chinese tea, coffee, and hot Milo, yum! I can't even count how many cups we downed because we were so cold from all the air-conditioning.

I'm not a huge gambler, so we just walked around to check out the surroundings and see how large the hands were. I'll occasionally play slots, but I couldn't find my favorite game--Wheel of Fortune.

I finally spied a few small banks along one side, but several of the machines were under repair. I did try my luck on another game, lost it all, and then gained it all back and then some. But it was a $0.02 machine, so even if you strike gold, your total winnings are still miniscule. But I see it as entertainment value for low stakes. It was fun to show my skeptical bf that slots could be fun by only playing $10 or $20. Hey, in Singapore, my winnings were enough to pay for a nice meal! :)

I didn't like how the ground floor was smoking, as it's always a bit annoying for non-smokers. But upstairs, the non-smoking section was just around the room in an O formation and didn't seem as impressive as the massive layout on the ground floor."
,,Not just for gamblers!!,4.0,,"The casino is beautiful. However, it is always very crowded. You have to go just for the experience, especially if you are a tourist cos you get to go in for free. The locals have to pay SDG$100 just to get in...."
,,could not get in,1.0,,"Apparently you have to bring your passports to play. I am sorry what tourist with a brain knowing its New Years Eve and they may have a bit to drink is going to bring their most important travel document with them to a casino?

Accent and skin colour wasn't enough to get past the rules. Not the staffs fault but apparently legislation.

From what I could see it looked like a large RSL inside."
,,Hideous Place,1.0,,"Now, I quite like casinos. They can be fun, drinking, music, people enjoying themselves and generally a pretty good atmosphere with the gambling of course. This place has nothing like that, it is purely about gambling. You cant seem to get a drink, there is zero area to chill out at a lounge and relax. I could only stand it for 20 minutes. I did win a few $$$ then hightaile dit out of there. You need your passport to get in as a foreginer but also seem to be checked at every opportunity. Hideous"
,,Full of Smokes,1.0,,First floor is the smoking area and the smoke tends to steam up to the second floor and above. The place lost its posh appearance that it once had when it first opened.
,,Nothing like Vegas...,3.0,,"It's a pretty casino, but most of the open tables were Baccarat (not my favorite game), and the atmosphere is a lot different from Las Vegas casinos. People drink coffee instead of alcohol, and there isn't that fun party vibe that I prefer while gambling.

If you go, make sure foreign visitors have their passports. For locals, there is a charge to enter the casino. Free for everyone else."
,,Dirt,1.0,,"Dirty place to go. It reminds me of Genting asino, so commercialised, so money minded, so mean, so skimming, so disgusting,"
,,Tobacco toking & teetotalling - truly terrible,1.0,,"I couldn't be more disappointed with my visit to the MBS casino.

When we first walked in I was puzzled by the smell of cigarette smoke -- surely not? -- only to be horrified to see patrons all over the floor smoking at tables, smoking while waking around, smoking over the shoulders of other gamblers. It is truly disgusting and within only a few short minutes our clothes were putrid -- that's another $50 in hotel laundry fees thanks MBS!!

To add insult to injury, we walked around the complex looking for a bar to grab a drink but there are none to be found anywhere. What a disappointment!!"
,,A real cosy and posh place to Place Your Bets,5.0,,Very conducive to 'invest'. Very posh place compared to the other casino in the city. Definitely a place for the rich and famous.
,,Avoid this place - Not worth it,1.0,,"Friends and I were in Singapore only for a couple of nights and thought that we'd spend our Friday night at the casino.

The place is so full of smoke you can barely breath and the worst thing is you can't get an alcoholic drink! Thats right folks, no bar! I couldn't believe it - a casino with no bars.

We only stayed for 30 mins before we had to get out and get some fresh air."
,,Stunning.,5.0,,Marina Bay Sands is a breathtaking place. The casino is supermassive and is like another planet. Entrance to the casino is free for tourists but S$100 for Singaporeans. The rest of MBS is free and you can walk about and soak in the sights. Entrance to the skypark is S$20 and is well worth it. You can see the skyline of Singapore and parts of Indonesia from the top. The infinity pool is beautiful. Highly recommended.
,,Too much ID check,2.0,,"Visited this place last year. My expectation, it's gonna be a good casino and cheaper bet. And suddenly all changed, 4 times ID check including at the time I wanna left the casino. Must use shoes or at least neat casual. Bet is average $15 and above. Too crowded and many smokers. In comparison to the Crown Casino or others casino in Las Vegas & Macau, they still far better than this not just in game but the ID check. The only thing is good from this casino, is free drinks!"
,,Disgusting,1.0,,Service was rude and enviroment was depressing.Such a hassle just to get in casino.Learnt not to put away my passport as was asked for it atleast 5 times.Dealer also had a permanent scowl on his face which made time at the casino awkward and most of the time i feel agitated by the smell of cigarette smoke.Worst casino that have ever been constructed.i totally recommend to erase this place from your places to visit
,,Need to exhibit more transparency at Games/Tables..,3.0,,"Singapore boasts of one of the best casinos in Asia and here we have a posh 5 star look-a-like casino @ Marina bay Sands.

PROS: The casino is very well managed and accommodates a smoke free and a clean environment for its guests.

Cons:
1) I am a fan of the chinese Sic Bo , and found that here the die are rolled and kept covered till we bet, and finally uncovered to reveal the numbers only after some time passes.. and this procedure was not clearly transparent, as what we get to see at other casinos like the one in Genting, Malaysia.
Keeping that in view, the table definitely lost good customers. They really need to take care of it.

2) MBS mgmt need to understand the fine line between being professional and Rude to the customers! I noticed the staff being cold and rude at times to the aged customers , especially first timers.

IMO: If you are really in for gamble, better avoid this place and go to Sentosa(if you are not visiting Genting Malaysia)."
,,Personality By-pass,3.0,,"Iconic design it may be but this casino just has no personality or character to it. The staff are automaton-like with not a hint of engagement - much like cardboard cut-outs. I am not a big casino-goer but have had some memorable experiences in Vegas and Macau. I could not wait to leave. And, did so promptly.
If gamble you must, then go...otherwise find some other Singapore attraction to take in - I wish we had!!"
,,Ferrari convertable rental!,5.0,,"This place has a exotic car rental shop inside. I rented a Farrari convertible for 30 minutes to drive at top speed through downtown Singapore. Pretty great! There are not a ton of cars in Singapore because of the add on tax so very little traffic to keep me from enjoying my quick jaunt.
Also, the roof top pool is truly amazing! Spectacular view of the city! Best hotel pool I have ever seen, without a dout."
,,singapore,5.0,,the marina bay sands was fantastic the gardens by the bay you can say you enter a world of perpetual spring and the marina bay sands is a world class complex for shopping the 3 hotel towers are crowned by the sands skypark wich offers a spectacular 360-degree view of singapore~`s skyline its ease travelling with the Mrt treins we anjoy it
,,Las Vegas has settled down in Singapore.,4.0,,"This place is a good surprise, as it is part of a big complex made up of a hotel and shopping mall. There is no cover charge for non residents. Entertainment is at every corner. F&B outlets are outside the casino and top notch. Two floors compose this casino: one for smokers and one for non smokers. It's fun all through."
,,Top tips for visiting Marina Bay Sands Casino,3.0,,"Tip 1: only go if you really have time, do not bother if you havent got enough time in singapore. The security checks at the front of the casino are very redundant. They kept on checking our passports over and over again, security after security. Completely waste of time.

Tip 2: the casino does not have the full-on world class casino standard like those ones in Macau. It is quite small and has poor interior design.

Tip 3: everything is so-so in the casino, guess the only highlight is the free non-alcoholic drinks and possibly the computerised gambling system in the casino. I won't bother going back again.

Please take note foreigners are allow to enter the casino for free. Local Singaporeans will have to pay to go in.

Please click 'Yes' If you think my reviews have been helpful to you."
,,"Just good, not special",3.0,,"Since this place is free for foreigner, i took an hour to walking around inside this casino. The machines are cool, hi-tech, and computerized. Softdrink are also free in there :). But the crowd of casino was very different with described by hollywood movie about casinos. In this casino, i saw many old people sitting in front of jackpot machines and waiting their fortune to come, which is never come.... No glamour and glory in this place"
,,Great open specs,4.0,,"Nice view over the large cannel and the Olympic park symbol. And newly open huge Louis Vitton Shop , you can get all the new collection here !"
,,Nice place for fun,4.0,,"Good place to lose money and have fun. A good casino, well maintained and good decors. You can spend a lot of time there foe entertainment."
,,Never pick up anything or else u will be charge as criminal,1.0,,If u found money or chips on the floor never pick up there are so many CCTV to record ur face. Worse when someone report that they drop money MBS will say u have committed theft in MBS so will barred from going in to MBS for life and they treat u like criminal ask u to stand at a wall n take pictures of u even when u are willing to return back the money u pick u are not allow to enter even near their premises.
,,Zoo,1.0,,"Terrible place, cannot check in, people swarming all over the place, the games are rigged at the casino"
,,Huge but not really upto its mark of Standards,3.0,,"Foreignrs entry is free wth valid Passport
Thy really chk on u... like imigration officrs do in airport

The place is huge... looke really very good.
Yes its expncy than casino in other parts of Asia

Service on the Table is really bad

Lots n lots of Machine Games

The place is wide spread

Is located in its own Mall which is opp to Marina bay Sands Hotel

In short must visit once but not wth much 2 expect....
Thanks"
,,Drinks in the roof bar,5.0,,"Modern, great views, amazing swimming pools on the roof. Service even at a busy party was first class. Good security."
,,Lacklustre,2.0,,"I went to the marina bay sands casino recently, and here was my experience as a foreigner in Singapore.

1. The entry was not as bad as i've read before. I had to show my passport once to some friendly bouncer types, and 10 steps later, again to a casino member of staff. In less than a minute I was in.

2. There are lots of machines here. I like a play on machines, so I tried about 10 different ones across the casino. My experience was that they were poorly maintained, with the buttons being quite unresponsive at times.

3. Floor staff inside the casino are rude. I wanted to find a waitress to get a drink. Staff would sullenly say ""Yes i'll bring one"" and then disappear never to be seen again. It was much easier to locate and walk over to the small bar in the corner and order myself than it was to actually get any member of staff to assist. Unacceptable.

4. Poor atmosphere. This could be due to the sheer size of the place. There wasn't a great casino atmosphere.

5. Machine selection. Whilst there are many machines, there are rows and rows of the same model. I estimate they may have about 50 different games across the casino floor, and the games are a poor selection of what is on offer at other casinos around the world. Expect a few WMS, a few IGT, many Aristocrats and a few others. There is no gamble option on wins on any game.

6. Middle floor was not too bad as far as smoke goes. It didn't bother me. The gaming floor however is pretty harsh smoke wise.

7. Minimums for most blackjack tables were typically SG$25. A little high unless you come with a big float."
,,Rude and free smoke,2.0,,"This has to be the most unfriendly casino on earth.
As a tourist, getting into the casino is equavalent to clearing difficult immigration officers.
People manning the entrance are rude and definitely make you feel unwelcomed.
It is so frustrating and your mood changed for the worse after clearing this process.
Upon entrance, you are greeted with free cigarette smoke everywhere, even on the non smoking floor.
The non smoking floor is one level up but due to the design (open concept) smoke from the lower smoking floor spreads everywhere.
Being sensitive to smoke and the obvious unhealthy environment, I could barely spend 10 minutes inside.
Exiting the casino is equally frustrating. The same process of showing your passport to several ""bouncers"".
This casino is only for the hardcore gamblers who can live with such rude treatment."
,,Have your Passport ready,2.0,,"I give the casino a poor rating because you had to have you passport reviewed 4 times on any trip to the casino. I was staying at the hotel, and thought they could figure out some better method for hotel guess. They also scan your passport every time you enter which seamed a bit strange."
,,OMG Saddest place ever...,1.0,,"Where do I start. This was the second time I was visiting this Casino and the first one was 3 years ago, they made Casino experience into an absolute nightmare.
Firstly, getting into casino is harder to pass the check points between east and west Berlin, I had to show my passport 3 times to get in and as soon as I got in another security approached and asked my passport again (apparently some random check). So frustrating its not even funny. I immediately wanted to leave after that, I was really fed up.
Secondly, They don't serve alcohol at the table only water, again, I understand controlling it but not serving at all was again very over the top.
 Last but not least, our little unhappy, sad faced dealer, he looked so bored about the whole game, makes you feel like  if you leave the table and don't bother him he would be the happiest man alive.
People and the hospitable environment make Casinos fun and you do not care about the money that you loose. This place makes you feel uncomfortable from entry to exit and take your money. So would you visit again, I would say NEVER..."
,,Having Fun,4.0,,"Visit the casino with my friend and having fun eventhough we have no previous experience. The staff at the table quite helpful to inform us the game rules as well as some LCD computer provided if you need more detail for the rules of each games. The casino is quite big, 2 floor and also have restaurants. The drinks provided for free starting from mineral water to coffee and tea. Be careful not to spend too much on gambling, friends. All we did just having fun with a low cost. Yap we lose but we got out with smiles. Quite an experience :)"
,,Very small casino - but nice building (from the outside),2.0,,"we visited the casino one night, and we were deeply disapointed. not only is wrong that locals have to pay for entry, but the casino is tiny!!!!!! out crappy crown casino in melbourne is twice that size. the minimum bets are really high so it discourages amature gambling for fun.

the free drinks are nice and the biulding is nice from the outside but other that that its a no go!!!"
,,Skyview is great; Casino is for smokers.,3.0,,"My girlfriend and I took the ride to the observation deck on top. It was a little frightening but a great experience that I don’t regret.

Later, we decided to go to the casino to play some blackjack. A sign at the entrance stated that there were areas designated for smoking, and the policy was strict. However, when we went inside, it appeared to us that people were smoking anywhere they wished. We could only stand about five minutes and left without buying a single chip. My conclusion: this casino is a good place for smokers, and if you go inside, you will become a smoker without ever lighting up a cigarette."
,,Not my idea of a Casino,3.0,,"Sorry if you want to just play a few hands and gamble a little this place is okay to visit and kill a couple hours. It's free to tourist but the locals have to pay well over $100 to get in. Make sure you bring your passport to get in. It is so well light it's like daylight and there is no alchohol! You can get coffee, hot coco, soft drinks, or water. I happen to win each time so I was lucky but still not sure I would ever go back."
,,Great place to spend the day living like a KING!,5.0,,"Spend nearly the entire day here. Most of the time was spent inside the Casino, but whenever I was tired/bored, I would venture into the various boutiques and stores for some window shopping."
,,Terrible service,1.0,,"As hotel guests a group of us we visited the skypark (just 2 days ago, mid August). So everything as fine, impressed with night view of Singapore, as with many others. Until when we were about to exit the security stopped us and demanded our security passes. As its with our friend who is swimming we don't have it. And the guard rudely stopped us from leaving the skypark and even threatened to call the police! This is just ridiculous and its a really frustrating and embarrassing situation. It's observed that other guests could leave without showing the pass and we were just dumbfounded by the guards' actions and attitude. The situation was resolved only like half an hour later that my friend came with the card, and the guards took a glimpse at the card and release us, without proper apologies. After this experience, I'm definitely sure not coming back again."
,,Nice place to hang out and shop,4.0,,My cousin who works near this place invited me to visit this place. It has a different touch of ambiance and I love the atmosphere around it.
,,What a enormous shopping and restaurant mall,4.0,,"Went to Marina Bay Sands mall. If you drive, you need to be patient as parking lots are rare and far in between. You may need to drive a couple of basements down before landing on a spot. Inevitably, the spot may be far from the entrance to the mall...

Once you find a parking lot, you will need to clearly jot down the location of the parked vehicle. Otherwise, you may not be able to locate your car when it is time to leave. This is fair warning to you, my reader.

The mall entrance can be quite a challenge to find but once you locate the door, you will be transported into a magically well managed mall. The mall is filled with different kinds of shops, from Ferrari shops to LV to sports shops. There are of different price ranges.. so pick your choice and roam at your leisure.

There are many restaurants and also eateries, cafe and even a food court. Watch your time. It will be super crowded during meal time.. So, be early or make a reservation.

The mall links to several parks within walking distance. You should have plenty of time allocated to each park.

Overall, a great experience.."
,,Play time,5.0,,"The best Casino I have ever visited, a big 2 floor area for the gamers, tables, machines for those who wanna play alone. You can have few cups of coffee if you start feeling sleepy. Best time to go risk your money at night there are chances of it getting doubled."
,,Absolutely the best casino i ever enter!,4.0,,Totally love the casio although i lose lots of money.. that;'s all i can say.. abyway i'm singaporean
,,You don't have to gamble to soak up the atmosphere!,5.0,,"Probably the largest casino I've visited....it's worth watching the Baccarat players during games - every emotion is expressed....it's a very popular game in Asia.
The non-smoking area on the ground floor is a respite from the main gaming area in the lower ground floor.
I must admit that I enoyed the food options in the Nest restaurant.
Foreign passport holders receive free admission - local Singaporeans pay $SG100 to enter."
,,Nothing special,2.0,,"Just an ordinary casino, the one in Adelaide could even beat it! Full of smoke and half of it was being renovated anyway. No nightclub or dance floor, just purely a money making venue."
,,Stunning views of Singapore,4.0,,On a recent visit to Singapore myself and a friend were very much looking forward visiting the sky deck at Marina Bay Sands. It was about $20AUD for the ticket which is not to bad considering. The view is just spectacular. Drinks from the bar are extremely pricey and they add service charge on top of it. Highly recommend visiting this attraction to all tourists in Singapore.
,,Spectacular...,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Casino is the best entertainment destination for everyone. There are many international restaurant with great selection of food. The swimming pool are fantastic located at top roof with 180 degree view. Entertaiment show always showing great international performers. Anyone with foreign passport is free entrance to the casino. Overall, we really enjoyed our time there.."
,,Great view,4.0,,"Located along the magnificent Marina Bay in Singapore, the Marina Bay Sands is a sight that is not to be missed. I went there with my friends for a round of drinks and watch the sunset from high above. It's worth to spend some time watching the laser lights show on the river bank which is one of the most famous attractions of marina bay. Come and find your own luck"
,,Just like any other,1.0,,"It's just like any other casino, worst still, very smoky because it was underground and not well ventilated."
,,Very disappointing. Don't bother.,2.0,,"We visited the Casino last week while staying at the Marina Mandarin Hotel. Had heard so much about the Casino so we went armed with our passports.Casino is free for non nationals. You stand in a line that says Foreigners!. 2 security check points to get in where they swipe your passports. Not very welcoming or friendly. Like security at the airport. Inside we were met with silence. No atmosphere. Nothing. No laughing. Atmosphere was like an exam center. Couldn't believe it. We have been to Las Vegas and California so had thought it would be something similar. Hardly any Europeans visible. No bars, only coffee and water. We walked around and noticed there are no manual roulette wheels, they are all automated. very strange. We ate at a noodle bar which was very nice and they served beer. On the tables were cards for Gambling Addiction services. We then walked around again hoping that the evening would improve. It didn't so we left without gambling at all.

We then discovered talking to a local friend that Singaporeans take gambling very very seriously. So that would possibly explain the silence. People were also allowed to smoke inside this building which is beautiful but really allowing smoking in this day and age ?

So all in all, very very disappointing. Would not recommend it at all. Felt like we were subjected to unfriendly staff at security on the way in. Surely they should be welcoming and trying to encourage people to visit ? This was the only occasion in Singapore in 9 days that we came across such a welcome."
,,A casino experience to remember,4.0,,"For a light-weight gambler from the US, this experience was an eye opener. I've never seen such high stakes (not to say they don't have plenty of options for smaller budgets. The best part about this experience, though, is the beauty of the building with it's setting in the harbor. You really do have to see this one to believe it."
,,Its all about Money!!!,4.0,,"day 1 arrived into singapore with an agenda..gamble gamble gamble..lol ..went to sands looked around for a bit and entered the casino.. i had so much fun.

the staff were friendly at the black jack table..spent the entire day there.. time flew i even forgot to have lunch ..but did not care less..
all the three days had a great time.. will definitely come back."
,,casinoden,5.0,,"Nice ambience and ideal place for gamblers . Has high stake tables separate and lowest stake I could find was 10 sgd in 3 card poker. That too they say get jacked up to 20 sgd on weekends.Other were pbacaraat , roulette and numerous electronic machines which were 100's in number.
Liquor is not free but soft drinks and beverages are . Best of Luck if you plan a visit here .
TOURISTS WITH PASSPORTS ENTRY FREE . LOCALS 100 SGD ."
,,Easy access,3.0,,"Access to casino was aplenty. Ample drinking stations throughout the casino. Good service at the membership counter. However, high minimum bet on gaming table and smoke is a big turn off. Remember to bring your passport for entry."
,,Bright and airy,5.0,,Been to teh MBS casino a number of time sand it is very open adn very light. It really has an air of elegance about it. DId not stay long a scoudl not take the smoke in all areas of the casino.
,,Fun (not for the family!),4.0,,"Go nuts at the casino, loose what you can afford, and maybe Win. Great place if you enjoy this kind of thing... Enjoy the Posh shopping on the way in too! Take your Passport- Photo ID required!"
,,Grand and Very fantastic environment!,4.0,,Very grand casino.. but please... dun gamble! You will get hooked!
,,Enjoy loosing Money,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Casino is a beautiful experience, with a huge number of tables and slot machines, great fun and excitement"
,,Need the Passport,3.0,,"We were going to take a look inside however needed our passports, next time!"
,,Where Rich Asians Go to Lose Money,3.0,,"Most tables have $300 minimum bet. Only a few blackjack tables, all except one have a minimum bet of $50, one for $25."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"Nicely laid out casino that strikes you with a little awe when you first enter, although I don't visit many casinos soaybe that's normal. Some table play is not for the feint hearted so stick to the slot machines if you're not confident of what you're doing.

The food is reasonably priced and there are bottles of water and soft drinks available."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"We did not stay in this area, but we visited it was amazing. May stay here on the next visit just to have some more time to explore this amazing hotel and the shopping area."
,,Very Cool - But Too Rich for Me,3.0,,"I have visited casinos in Las Vegas, Macau, Australia, UK, The Philippines and as much as I think this is a great casino, if like me you are not wealthy it's just too expensive most gams seem to start at Sing $25 a hand and the fact that there is NO proper poker room but only house based poker games means I just have no reason to go back there."
,,Amazing view and pictures but....,3.0,,the ship ontop of the columns looks amazing - but inside it is jst a huge shopping mall - and the casino is just packed and it has no intimadancy! Also way too many smokers and smoke is everywhere. Also the tables are expensive - for the avergae player trying to play blackjack -you will have to fork out 25/ hand. Its great to go to skypark and have a view and pictures
,,Great view at Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,This is one of the attractions in Singapore that you should not miss... It is just around the area where you can also see other equally nice picturesque places like Esplanade and Merlion Park. You will definitely enjoy strolling along the Marina Bay Sands where you can enjoy great foods inside the mall or bars outside and also a nightly light show at Marina Bay Sands Theater. You can also enjoy a great food at Makansutra Gluttons Bay in Esplanade.
,,Huge casino...but lots of downsides,3.0,,"The casino was quite large once you were able to get past 3 passport checkpoints! Once inside, it was quite expansive and was crowded. As others posted, it was very smoky. The tables' staffs were less than pleasant, and I felt like it was an inconvenience being there. They need a little attitude adjustments! There were some tables games I had not seen before which is always fun to see. Again, it was quite large but I've seen better and nicer staff in other casinos!"
,,"Kudeta Skybar, Marina Sands, Singapore",5.0,,Just perfect for r&r! Staff are very friendly and respectful. I love the pizza! Very relaxing.
,,Shopping & dinning in luxury,4.0,,"The marina bay sands is a luxury destination for shopping, dinning, casino, stays and breath taking views of the river and city from high above the ground. I went with my colleagues and had a wonderful dinner at the food court as the private restaurants are always full and mostly very expensive. You'll be amazed by the choice of food you can find at the food court and all the restaurants here are certified class A.

It's worth to spend some time watching the laser lights show on the river bank which is one of the most famous attractions of marina bay."
,,Superb place to play,5.0,,Play the 3 card poker there you are sure to win money if you are not greedy...
,,a very busy casino but smoking allowed,3.0,,"its the busiest casino i've ever been, could not really enjoy it since smoking is allowed inside"
,,Not as fun as expected,4.0,,"This is a well maintained casino. The atmosphere though was more formal than I expected. When I play table games, I enjoy interacting with the other players and dealer. I found many of the tables to be quiet and serious, maybe because the table minimums are high."
,,Not for me,2.0,,"Thought we would have a look a the new Casino although we are not Gambling people, we thought it would be nice to have a look around maybe a fun bet and have a drink with our friends.
You must remember that you require your passport to get into the Casino or you will be refused entry. When we walked in we were hit by the overwhelming smell of smoke and cigars, it was thick and unpleasant. Knowing now my clothes would need to be laundered we pushed through, it was neverending with multiple floors of gaming tables. We decided to find a bar or area we could get a drink from. After searching the first 2 floors we asked staff where we could get a cocktail but were suprised to find out that there was nowhere!!!!!! so you can smoke but can not drink Alcohol !!!!
it was a disapointment, the smell of cigarette smoke pungent and sickening to the stomach."
,,nature,5.0,,3 building and lion and water very good one and very long building and musium and the forumla race i like
,,Great ambience for a casino,4.0,,As casinos go this one has a very nice ambience. The open air concept makes the area very airy which is nice when you could be there for the long haul at the tables. Best of luck at the table everyone!
,,expensive parking with inconvenient public transport,3.0,,"everything is expensive at Marina Bay Sands.. it'll be a few years before more buses ply that route.. in the meantime, there's a taxi surcharge taking a cab outta MBS.. parking, 1 hour parking @ MBS buys me a McD Big Mac Value Meal ... Singapore Straits Times seem to hint that budget travellers need not come to Singapore; they only want the truly loaded; which actually suits Hong Kong just fine.. HK wants all the world's budget travellers that Singapore is showing the exit door"
,,Great Experience but brush up on skills prior,5.0,,great place especially if you have an appetite for gambling even otherwise it is a great place to just browse through as you discover the Marina Bay Sands complex...
,,good,3.0,,not really big like macau but its ok.but when want to get in must show the pasport if we r foreigner for free pass to get in.so annoying
,,Kudeta Bar,5.0,,"Go there with friends for a round of drinks and watch the sunset from high above. Excellent atmosphere,great music and amazing view on the city. I'd love to go there again!"
,,Gambling Den for Mainland Chinese?,2.0,,"For people with an experience of distinguished old style European casinos like Monte Carlo this is quite a difference. There is no glamour - just simple greed. If it is not your only aim to win or lose money, but to have a ""nice"" night out with some thrill, forget it. Could only bear it for 30mins. Will not do it again."
,,Great views,4.0,,"You can buy a ticket to go up to the viewing area from 10am-10pm. However, the majority of the rooftop consists of the pool and gardens, which you will not be able to see unless you are on a guided tour. There are two or three guided tours a day, one is at 2pm another is at 9pm. Inorder to go on the guided tour you need a bracelet which you can request for free after buying your ticket to go up. When I was there I bought my ticket at 1130am and the bracelets for the 2pm tour were gone. There is no waiting/standby list."
,,Lady Luck Nowhere to be seen,5.0,,"Excellent casino well Maintained,but entry is expensive for locals,shops around are excellent.Views around amazing,very accessible.I suggest shop before you enter or shop after you win.The whole Marina Bay area is worth a visit"
,,"Awesome Casino, worth the visit",4.0,,"Singaporeans have to pay a 100SGD fee to enter, so don't forget your passport to access the Casino! It definitely worth the visit!"
,,A place to try ur luck,4.0,,"Marina bay sands is the new casino in town compare to one at sentosa..
I suggest u go here by mrt, take the red line until marina bay station than switch to bayfront and voila u arrive at MBS right away..
The casino is hugee, they have 2 floors, upper floor non smoking, lower smoking, but it's doesn't matter coz it's not separated..

They got dresscode to enter here, casual wear is okay, but wear shoes, no flipflop and short pants for man..
The smallest bet in the table i think 25sgd, they got almost everything from baccarat, daxiao (dice), craps, singapore studs poker, blackjack (a lil bit different in the rule compare to casino in macau), texas hold em poker, slot machine..

Apart from the casino, they have branded shops too like chanel,salvatore etc.."
,,Fantastic View of Singapore Skyline,5.0,,It's a great place to visit if you want to have a great view of the Singapore Skyline. It has great high end shopping options yet offers a good range of dining selections - from the cheap to the very expensive.
,,too smokey,2.0,,"The casino was very smelly from the cigarette smoke in the air. There were designated smokers areas but no one took notice. Not that it mattered anyway because the smoke would have traveled throughout the whole casino regardless. I couldn't stay for more than an hour.

Make sure you bring your passport because its free for tourists. Locals have to pay a fee. You have to show your passport on the way in and on the way out."
,,"Tempting, Luring and makes you commit the sin and become greedy!!",5.0,,"State of art casino. International standards. Its a huge huge huge area to try your luck all over. If you are lucky, you can get your trip sponserd. Do not forget to take your passport alongwith you. The entry is free for foreigner. Water, tea, coffee is free inside.... :-)
Go ahead and try your luck but dont be greedy !!!!!!"
,,Big of fun,3.0,,HugE first casino been 2 had fun but didnt feel special as dealers lacked enthusiasm but was good fun winning £150 then losing it in 2mins !
,,Not a fancy casino,3.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands complex is very impressive, so too bad the casino isn't! The whole first floor is smoking and the ventilation is not good so expect your clothes to stink. Also no alcoholic beverages, just coke.

I was expecting more, only go if you have really like gambling . The casino in Sentosa is probably better"
,,"Feels Las Vegas, but service is turning stingy..",4.0,,"Went to MBS (as they call it here in singapore) Casino the other day with my gal friend. She was going to MBS for first time, i felt she will be dazzled by the sight of it. Entrance has become so boring now, feels like entering a Jail to meet you con friends. I remember going an year back, and the entrance was flaunted by a shiny sports car. Now, it was all numb, sleepy eyes, dull environment. Once you enter, it feels las vegas for a second, till you find a stingy looking chinese uncle playing lil bets. The service used to be awesome sometime back, but now you got to chase the waitress if you looking for a sip of ur favorite liquor. MBS is trying hard to get their high spenders back, by giving of 3% off on purchases. Lol.. Go to have fun.. Plain straight fun.. Dont expect to dazzle your gal here."
,,"Huge casino, spend some dollars, not too much!",4.0,,"Many casino games, if casino is not your thing, don't go there. If you like it, you can easily spend an evening here because of the many table and slot games. drinks are on the house (no alcoholic)"
,,Wow....amazing,5.0,,"Go up there with your darling and get a sitter for your child, as they are not allowed until the turn 16 (14 may be). The Bar is great and so is the entire view over the city. Weekends seem to be more busy. Bring money as it is not cheap, but the view and setup will pay you back."
,,No Passport = No Entry,4.0,,"If you plan to visit MBS Casino, you must bring your passport. The staff are seriously zealous about doing their jobs, so you have to return to your room to get your PP from the safe. Once you get past that, the casino is well worth visiting. If you have time for only one casino in Singapore, make it Sands. There are only two casinos in Singapore so one is not spoilt for choice. MBS is new and posh, the croupiers are polite to the point of being a little contrived, and gambling is serious business. You won't encounter chatty or hey buddy types at MBS. The upper level is non smoking and the boorish personas seem to hang around the main/lower floor so I had a pleasant time playing upstairs. MBS is generous with non alcoholic beverages but no canapes served. The taxi ranks outside the casino are ridiculously long so if you're not staying on site, you're better off walking 7mins to take the train from the basement to return to your hotel."
,,Average,3.0,,"The casino is big but nothing else to shout about. Glitzy designer restaurants on the 3rd floor. Dining area on the second and first because singaporeans and pr's pay a levy to go in and can't leave. But that's all, no glam, no vibe."
,,Spacious,3.0,,"There is not much here in the form of bling or even excitement but is rather a well ordered, spacious and uncrowded place.

The decor is very boring and much like the other Casino on Sentosa, just different colours. The amenities are good and all the workers are pleasant."
,,Gamblers' Paradise,3.0,,"Comparing to Vegas, it is nothing. Comparing to Poi Pet, it is haven."
,,Very average casino,3.0,,"Maybe it's because I have been to quite a few casinos in my time, but I was not very impressed by the MBS casino. It's big, but most of the tables are still crowded. I didn't see a blackjack table for less than $25 a hand and the minimum for roulette is 5$ on an inside number. No free alcohol just makes them seem cheap. C'mon, just because they have a monopoly on gambling in Singapore doesn't give them an excuse to be cheap. I experienced a few rookie mistakes while gambling here. A buddy of mine beat the dealer in a hand of blackjack, but she cleared his cards and took his chips. He had to wait about 15 minutes while they checked the video before he got paid. Also, they allow different players to use the same red, MBS, $5 chip on the roulette table. I made sure I got my own color, but sure enough I saw an argument between two people over whose chip was on the winning number. Once again, they had to go to the video. All major casinos on the Vegas strip are much more professional, as well as my home casino, the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Florida. With that being said, if you like to gamble, go and have a good time. I believe the only other casino is on Sentosa Island, so the MBS is your only choice."
,,A must do on your trip to Singapore.,5.0,,"This is a lovely casino and has to be seen to be believed. It's huge. Spread over two floors I think they said it's the largest single casino room in the world or something like that. Free coffee and cold drinks whilst you play, and they allow smoking on the lower floors. Staff were helpful, and no expense seems to have been spared. Don't forget your passport which you need to get in AND out for some reason. S$100 per day entry fee for Singaporeans, free for everyone else. Even more fun if you win some money!"
,,"If you like casino , go there",4.0,,"It is a big casino, the only think that I didn't like is that the local people has to pay 100 singapore dollars to enter in the casino. Tourist don't pay , but has to show the passport. If you like gambling, it is a good place to go."
,,What A Place,5.0,,"the Casino is spread over two floors and has more than 500 gaming tables and more than 1700 slot machines...
Tourists MUST produce their passport to gain entry
The lower floor allows smoking whilst it is banned on the upper floor ...free coffee and bottled water while you are gambling"
,,"Free drinks, free entrance",4.0,,Worth a visit. Free entrance and free drinks inside. The Casino is gigantic and that is in it self worth a view. You are allowed to smoke in there which gives it an awe full smell though.
,,spectacular,4.0,,"we sat at marina bay and watched the spectacular light show which is on at 8.00pm and 9.30pm very night and it was great, as was the lighting up of the 3 towers at night, a must see while you're in singapore"
,,Singapore Gambling,4.0,,"Huge casino; tons of table games but sad that area residents have to pay SGD 100 just to enter the casino floor. Also, be prepared to stand in a long line for a taxi back to the city."
,,nice but missing games,3.0,,"You will find a lot of common asian gambling games such as big-small and more electronic gambling of traditional games (roulette, big-small) but you won't find a poker room."
,,Automated atmosphere,3.0,,"Too many people, too serious about gambling, no free drinks or nibbles!"
,,"Done it, take it off the List",2.0,,Simply amazing for the pool view ! Very poor service. VIP treatment means nothing. Just too big ! You feel that you are just a number of a massive machine. One will have to pay me to stay there again.
,,Bring lanyard to hang your passport around...,3.0,,"Access>> The casino has few entrance access from The Shoppes at Marina Bay complex. At each of the entrance, there is security checkpoint that one must go through. However, the procedure seemed not uniformly applied to every checkpoint. At one time, I was granted entry just by flashing my passport. At another entrance, the security guard scanned through the passport so detailed it took longer than immigration officer at the airport and causing lengthy queue. Singaporean and Singapore PR need to pay gaming levy to enter any casino on the island.
The Casino>> there are 2 main level which public can access; the main floor has larger space and is smoking area. The upper level is smaller as there is a wide opening overlooking the main floor and is non-smoking. As a non-smoker, being in the non-smoking floor is a relieve, however the game choice is not as much as on the main floor bringing its own disadvantage
Exit>> Upon exit, each guest must again flash their passport (for foreigners) to be allowed exit. This is the first thing I experienced exiting the casino (in Asia) so hard of which no clear reason why they should screen each guest upon exiting... Such procedure was not present at other Sands casino though...
Verdict>> overall good experience having a casino with separate smoking and non-smoking area. However, management need to take care of the composition between games in smoking and non-smoking floor as well. Nonuniform procedure for entering the casino bring the main reason of checking each guest identity into big question and tight screening upon exiting the casino remain a mystery..."
,,Have a punt and you may have a win,4.0,,"The Marina Bay sands casino is beautiful, a great place to visit and try you luck.

The bets are a little larger than what we are able to bet here in Australia, but bigger risk = bigger winning possibilities.

Remember to take your passport with you to avoid the $100 tax they charge Singaporeans"
,,Only indoor smoking area in Singapore...,2.0,,...to accomodate the Mainland Chinese tourists travelling on group packages. Vulgar PRC hookers can also be spotted.
,,Dress code & passport,3.0,,"I'm not into gambling. The casino is big and very business-like. It is separate from the mall. In order to go into the casino, bring your passport. Men will need to wear long pants, and no sandals (shorts not allowed). As a traveller in hot humid Singapore, I don't think it's worth the sacrifice to see the casino -- it is formal and very business-like, not fun like Las Vegas.

Tip: If you don't want to wear pants and would like to see the casino (but not gamble), you can see it from the top level. There are fancy restaurants that overlook the casino, and you can get a view of the casino. Go into the mall, follow signs to Guy Savoy. You will have to take a very hidden elevator up to the second or third level. This will put you above the casino, and you can get a view of the casino (design reminds me of Star Wars). You won't get to play, but at least you can see what the casino looks like."
,,"Huge Casino, High limits",3.0,,"Ensure that if you are traveling from outside of Singapore that you bring your Passport as entry will be refused without one. Once inside the place is massive. A huge selection of tables, aimed more towards the Chinese market which I would expect. Very few tables of Blackjack, Poker etc.

All around the outside of the tables are hundreds of slots machines. The casino continues onto a smaller 2nd floor which looks over the ground floor. There are a few places to grab food and soft drinks, water and tea/coffee are all free. The waiters will either deliver or you can get a drink from one of the many drinks stands located around the casino.

My only concerns were just how busy the place is. It can be difficult to get a seat at a table and don't be expecting small limits. $25SGD a hand, minimum. I also found it struggled with smokers. Being an ex-smoker I actually enjoy the smell, but it can get too much. We tended to move to the 2nd floor for a break as it's less busy/smokey."
,,Winning was nice but it seriously lacks and ambience and is a massive world apart from The Vegas atmosphere.,2.0,,"Can't say much.I don't want to be rude or racist but The local Singaporean Chinese staff and patrons just aren't happy people and it comes out in the mood in the casino.they don't strive to keep customers and are very rigid.I managed to win overall, so that was fantastic, but I can't see myself going back there in a hurry.it's just a pleasure as a table player.there's no fun,smiles,feel,ambience.....if your non-asian,you'll see what I mean.Macau at Teh Four Seasons set the bar for Asia.MBSC are near the bottom."
,,"Casino, not like Las Vegas but nice",5.0,,"The casino is a nice Singapore experience. Nothing like Las Vegas, but it was pleasant, very clean and lots of fun. And as a foreign, I didn't have to pay S$100 the locals must pay to enter."
,,Avalon@Marina Sands Singapore,2.0,,"Being a PR in Singapore for a few years now I highly recommned to visit Marina Sands and in particular the Sky Park. It is on the top of the ""must do's"" in Singapore for me. Enjoy the view and stroll along the bay once you are back ""down to earth"".
I don't recommend ""Avalon"" which is a club at the the South Pavilion near the exebithon centre. It's over priced e.g. cover charge = SG$ 25, stuff is arrogant, barkeeper try to cheat you, which is rare in Singapore,.. and all sofa seat's are subject to a min. spend.
You can find much better places at Emerold Hill Rd or Clarke Quay and enjoy the real Singapore which is great place to be.."
,,Huge Crowded Casino,4.0,,Nicely appointed. Super huge and crowded to match. This place has relatively high limit gaming. No Vegas prices here.
,,Classy casino,4.0,,"The casino oozes class, well decorated interiors, with a superior service to match. Servers constantly go around the tables to serve beverages. The casino itself is huge and comparable to the ones in Macau. Dealers are generally friendly and not intimidating. Locals pay a levy of $100 and foreigners enter for free."
,,Great!,5.0,,"Went to the top floor bar (cant remember the name) for drinks...expensive entry at about $40 (one drink included I guess), but it was well worth it...the view, music and entertainment is first class. Followed it with a visit to the casino...thoroughly enjoyed Marina Bay Sands Hotel!"
,,Why only one entrance/exit during late night?,3.0,,"If Venetian Macau could have several entrance/exit open during late at night, why not MBS? Very inconvenient for us to pickup our car at the basement car park as we need to make a big detour."
,,Let the money roll...but know your limits!,4.0,,"Please first take note, bring your international passport or you will not be allowed inside. This is a decadent place where money and smoking chinese make the place their own... this is Vegas style...the Singaporean way..."
,,It's HUGE,4.0,,"When it comes to Casinos, this place is huge! and architecturally very pleasing. We'd already visited the Theatre and knew that it was going to be a stylish place. The smallest bets were $5 to bet on Roulette numbers, in which the odds are stacked against you and $25 for most of the Card games. Dont expect nicely dressed casino goers, with alot of people just wearing slippers and shorts with a cardi. I've never been a gambler, so I guess I could say I wasnt impressed, but Ive been to quite a few casinos as a tourist and this one is really pretty. It's free entry for foreigners, but $100-200 epr entry for Singaporeans and PR.
Remember if you take a cab out in the evening, its peak time, and cab prices are double. The casino is well-located so you can pop out to go shopping, eat at the celebrity restos and have a drink at the bar upstairs, Ku-de-ta.
Worth a look at, if you bet, I'm sure you know the house always wins."
,,Really Huge,5.0,,The place is really a huge location if i'm not wrong will have atleast 500 tables to play... For any citizen of nation where there is no casino will be amazed at the first look of the casino floor when he stands in the first floor... Can visit and see what happens if you don't want to spend money...
,,Awesome experience. See the Casino and hotel towers everyday from my apartment,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is paradise. I luv handing out in the Casino, chilling at the Shoppes and the clubs there- Avalon and Kudeta. Service level can be improved a lot more, but from living a king size life...Its the best experience in Singapore..."
,,Prestige,5.0,,You just love the design of the casino. They seperate into two floor for regular gambler. Smoking and non smoking. Drinks are all free. For guys please dont wear shorts.
,,Doing tricks wihin the SICBO itself IN front of us all innocent players,1.0,,"Im very unhappy about the way CAsino works.

They can OPEN 12 rounds of ODDS In SIC BO.

Let me tell u they are doing tricks.
The sic bo basically have a cover and inside there is still one more cover transparent cover inside whereby they have cameras inside.Nobody can win more than the casino itself. they can tap the handle to mix the dice three times and while we are betting they are doing tricks within the cover itself.
Thats terrible.
I am sure that they are doing tricks inside,
guys got to be alert.
I have lost many money despite having use of method..
They are really killing People hard earn money. Thats terrible.."
,,Singapore Casino - take plenty of money,5.0,,"My friend and I had researched this prior to arriving and were informed that if you were in transit and had the white paper in the passport you could get in for nothing. Locals, expats etc had to pay $S120 for 24 hours.

Arrived all dressed up as per internet advice, admitted through at least 3 passport controls, and in we went. WOW!!! A huge round upper and lower decks of gaming machines and tables. We of course headed for the 1, 2, 5 cent machines and were quite happy with little wins etc. Mostly elderly chinese ladies, very friendly who chatted with us. Bearing in mind that this was a Monday evening I was surprised at the crowds.

Then we decided to look downstairs where you could hardly see for lung busting smoking. These machines were a different kettle of fish - $S50 could go in a very short time. Figured we would never attend here again and were on holiday, so what the hell.

Now as far as dressing up goes - there were men in shorts, thongs on feet, T-shirts and ladies in just an ordinary day dress and sandals and we felt we stuck out in the crowd.

You do not have to surrender your handbag to a locker there unlike the Genting Highlands in Malaysia Casino.

Same passport controls going out, but plenty of taxis available in queues for passengers. Very efficiently run.

See at beginning for cost of attraction.

All in all it was an eye opener compared to the local clubs and pubs we go to in Melbourne - never been to Melbourne Crown Casino."
,,Entertainment,1.0,,"I recently attended a show at the Casino called ""Abba Mania"". When one attends a show put on at a Casino with profile of MBS you expect to find a standard similar to that you would find in Las Vegas expecially for $130 dollars. I am talking about something comaparable to Jersey Boys. Unfortunately Abba Mania was excruciatingly bad and not worthy of stage time at the Casino. The standard was of that you would expect to find in a suburban hotel or a rock eisteddfod. We went with 2 other couples and we all left at the interval. It's a little sad that MBS could be so mercencary with events like this I felt robbed of $115 as this show was only worth $15 max. Shows are supposed to attract people to Casinos not drive them away."
,,WOW! Amazing fun and food in one location,5.0,,Visited the casinp and suurounding shopping centre and was truly amazed. Everything is well set out. The casino is huge and even fun for non-gamblers. There are great restaurants everywhere from casual to 5 star. Even have a Harley Davidson bar. Loved the cleanliness and the prices for a casino complex were very reasonable for everything else. Worth a visit even if you only walk around.
,,WOW,5.0,,The most beautiful and sofisticate casino. Too bad they didn't allow me to take any photos!
,,"Typical casino, nicely located in Marina Bay",3.0,,"Marina Bay Sands casino appears to be very crowded and full of smokes. The minimum bets on the casino tables seem to be on the high side compared to casinos in other countries.It doesn't have the best atmosphere compared to casinos in Macau, but the hotel seems to be very nice.

Although it's about 8-10 min walk from Marina Bay MRT station with the humid temperature, I liked the walk leading to the casino because you get to enjoy the water view and also seeing the Merlion from a distance."
,,A truly amazing building well worth a look,4.0,,Looked at shops and sheltered from the rain! It is a non expense spared shopping centre attached to the Casino complete with a stream and boat rides.
,,My first visit to a casino,4.0,,"This was a totally new experience. Although my advice wud be not to get carried away. I started with 50$ and made 350$, but became greedy and eventually lost the whole of it! Nevertheless it was an amazing setup"
,,Mini Macau,5.0,,"Finally Singapore also has a casino which can entertain the gambling-junkies from Mainland China. If you are visiting Singapore, and like gambling, this is your place to be. If you are new to the casino scene and just want to try your luck, go ahead. We did just that and won ;)
Important to know: take your passport with you as they check it before entering (locals have to pay 100 SGDs to get in)"
,,Visit to the Top a one off experience,3.0,,"It was worth paying the fee to get up to the top, the view was great but that was about it. Bar was over priced, I know its a tourist attraction and you have a captive audience but $25 for a bear is ridiculous. Nevermind I won't be going back"
,,This Will Blow Your Mind.,5.0,,"This new building is like a ship floating in the sky with palm trees / swimming pool / and everything you would ever need.
We had to make a visit to see for ourselves as tourists, but didn't make accommodation as the pricing was a bit out of our league.
When you visit this grand location you have to pay $20:00 singapore to go to the top to see the views. ( out of this world )... But be aware that if you make a booking to do the tour ( which is only for the first 50 in the Que ) and it rains and the tour is cancelled then you don't get your money back. But that aside do the trip to the top without being in a tour as you will be sorry if you don't.
Then there is the shopping in the magnificent shopping plaza's. Four floors including a skating ring, a lake and river with a Gondola, Restaurants, and every High End shop name that you could think of is there.
Make an effort because when you leave there you can go across the harbor on a water taxi and get on the Singapore Flyer as well."
,,Great Place To Visit !,5.0,,"We took the train it was a reasonable walk from the station ,great place to spend a day wonderful shopping and be sure to take the lift to the rooftop amazing views from up there don't forget the camera.There is a fee for the lift."
,,"MBS From RafflesQuay, A total fascination with Nature & Nurture!",4.0,,"Most visitors to Marina Bay Sands would have arrived from the Helix Bridge entrance. However, for those more adventurous, start your trip from Raffles Place MRT, heads towards Raffles Quay and besides the NTUC Income bulding or Custom House, take a stroll towards MBS. Along the way, besides scenic view, you can admire the Shenton area skylne plus understand some interesting facts about Singapore and how Marina Bay came about. We came upon this pavillion where it has an automated fan, powered by sun's energy and sensor. It offers the tired visitor a cool breeze on a warmth sunny day in Singapore! Just out of this world! You also come across a few art pieces, the 4 Singa lion statues and also a gallery on Planning of the Marina Bay area. Don't forget to click on the video and it will give you interesting information on how the Marina Bay was created. It is a great masterpiece!

Besides visiting the casino, shops, theatres, restaurants, etc, the best place and a must see is of course, the skypark. Best viewing time is 630pm to 730pm, Of course one needs to be up there a little earlier cos it gets pretty crowded by then.
As we made our way to the skypark, we realise the hotel staff are not very welcoming. Perhaps they have seen so many visitors that they are oblivious to any new ones. The staff were more available to tell you what not to do than to welcome the visitors.

When hunger strikes after your visit, you may want to try the local flavors at Rasa Singapura, a food court where you could try many local dishes without blowing your budget. One must try the Ice Kachang when you visit Singapore. It is Shave ice and had many beans, corns, jello stuff and overflow with sweet syrup. It tastes better on a hot day.;)Try the laksa if you love a little spicy stuff, or chicken rice if you like rice instead.

After walking through the lighted Helix Bridge in the evening, you will get more beautiful pictures of the Marina Bay!;)

Sit and relax a little and just watch that gorgeous skyline for a moment of fascination!"
,,A new attraction in Singapore,4.0,,"Driving into Singapore from the airport you cannot help but see the new edfice of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel on your left hand side and just beyond the Singapore Ferris Wheel, the Singapore Fling. From the Novotel at Clarke Quay we had a pleasant 30 minute walk to the edge of the new marina bay and around to the hotel which looks like 3 towers with a boat sitting astride of it. Access can be achieved through the new shopping mall and then a lift to the 57th floor after paying Sing$20 per head to access the viewing deck. The view up there is a magnificent panorama of the whole of Singapore and provides you with a good idea of all that has been achieved and also that in the making. We also got to see the infinity pool and enjoy a drink at the roof top bar. All in all rounded up to Sing$100 which wasn't cheap but well worth the one off experience."
,,fun place to pass time,4.0,,"My friends and I loved the Casino at Marina Bay Sands and went there almost every evening during our 5 day stay. While bets are slightly on the higher side, the roulette, sicbo and sslot machines are great fun and very very addictive. Some nights you will be there till early morning.
Its quite lively but food options are minimum. You have to go out of the casino to eat at restaurants as within the casino there are just one or two restaurants with not much variety. There are beverage vending machines to keep you awake all night long. Ensure you are well dressed and carry everything wtih you inside the casino as you will have to otherwise make trips to the cloak room as you are not allowed to carry bags inside."
,,Just soak in the lottery atmosphere,5.0,,Casino is very big. You are greeted with a sportscar just as you enter the casino. Other than that it smelt of smoke. So be prepared if you are not a smoker. Can be overwhelming. Other than that it was what you would expect a conventional casino to be like.
,,Just horrible service,2.0,,"My wife and I travel a lot and MBS must be one of the places with the worst service on earth to stay in.

First of all the service is horrible. We had to wait around 30 minutes just to check in. The rooms are fairly spacious, however, try ask for room service and they just take ages. There is a casino in the hotel ( for which it is known for ), and we think that since the casino is probably the main money maker, MBS have neglected and paid less attention to the hotel.

The bathroom amenities are nasty here too. Cheap looking plastic bottles like those you see in third tier Chinese cities. Although the interior decor is nice, the finishing of construction is a joke for what you have to pay for the room. Wallpaper is peeling, tile joints are not that great.

Me and my wife were expecting a relaxing holiday. The lobby is constantly crowded with loads of people.

If you want to just go to a casino and need a place to sleep, then MBS is the place to go. If you want some luxury and service to go with it, then it is my suggestiong to try somewhere else."
,,Bring a fat wallet,3.0,,"Only went to the casino to play a few hands of blackjack, and with the minimum table at $50 it was a short night...."
,,free entrance for foreigners,3.0,,"It's free entrance for foreigners, so why not just walk in and have a little tour even if you are not interested in gambling. There are free flows of drinks as well."
,,Picturesque view of the city,4.0,,"The board walk is fantastic. A quiet evening on a weekday, (not weekends when it is crowded) is a nice way to relax. If you are a photographer good points to click. You may want to start being there before dusk to get the full experience."
,,Don't go to the lowest floor!,3.0,,"For some reason the lowest floor is where the smoking is allowed. So there is really nowhere in the place that doesn't smell. I can't say I was impressed, though I'm not a gambler. Probably worth a look at - because of the location and the size. But we didn't stay long. Need your passport."
,,Sky Park -If you only go once,5.0,,Last year (2010) when we were in Singapore the Marina Bay Sands was still under construction and we promised ourselves that if and when we went back we would go and check it out. In May 2011 we did just that. We spent three days in wonderful Singapore. One of the things on our to do list was to visit the sands in all its glory. All though some say that the sky park fee was expensive I beg to differ. If you only ever go up there once you have to go because the view in itself is well worth the admission fee. We ventured up at about 4:30pm hoping to see a wonderful sunset but instead we got a wonderful lightening show as the weather was a little wet at that time. It was awe inspiring to see Mother Nature at her best against a man made world which in my opinion is one of the best modern places on the earth. If you are watching the pennines then do not venture further to Ku De Ta which is the resturant at the very top as this is quite expensive. We had a bottle of Tiger Beer each and that cost us $37.00 $SD. The only draw back if you want to call it this is because we weren't guests staying at the hotel we weren't able to view the pool. Never mind may be next time!!! :)
,,Extremely rude staff at the passport check-in,1.0,,"My passport and I were stuck at this foreigner lane with a really sullen female staff. I was kept waiting for a long time while she kept looking at the screen while other visitors in the other lane were moving swiftly. Finally, after waiting for a long time, I asked her what was the issue? She rudely told me that the system is still checking my passport. And, I am denied entry. So I suggested if I could go to the next lane? She rudely told me that is the same system, even if I were to change lanes. I was so upset at her rudeness that I was thinking of leaving. But I told her that this was my first visit to the MBS Casino. And suddenly she gestured to another sullen male staff and she started talking in Malay to him (thinking that I did not understand! How rude is that?). After talking, the rude staff returned my passport and gestured to me to enter, like she is some US Secret Service operative. SO RUDE! I will never return to this place!"
,,Worst Experince Had in my entire life of vaccations.,1.0,,Whao Marina Bay Sands!!!! But it is not as it appears from outside.This is a terrible hotel from service since you check in.We arrived on 13th July 2011 at 8:30 pm with a long waiting of 5 hours and guess what they did not had rooms after our 15 days prior booking and confirmation.The excuse was the rooms are not ready due to housekeeping till midnight 1:00 am.After arguing for 5 hours they managed to arrange us Suite rooms and they gave us apology letter for one day refund too.Service is very poor but the hotel is the great experience and the suite too.Well we was upgraded for it and enjoyed.Better be prepared for your time.
,,Casino is a JOKE,1.0,,"The Casino is huge but so many essentials are missing! NO atmosphere what so ever - people are not smiling or laughing or coming off as having fun in any way. People push and shove at tables, no class whatsoever. It is impossible to get a drink anywhere - no staff coming to the tables and unable to locate a bar anywhere. People are smoking everywhere so the place stinks of smoke. Most tables has a 20 SGD minimum and the odds on the tables are the worst I have ever seen, eg. one color betting on roulette requires a 5 times bigger bet than on a single number. Yes, the casino always wins but this is the most blatant and rude way I have ever seen a casino make money, shameless. Treating customers as cattle, milked to the bone! Do yourself a favor and don't go!"
,,An interesting place to visit,4.0,,"Singapore has two casinos- this one at Marina Bay, and another on Sentosa Island.

This one is largely adult orientated; the Sentosa Island casino resort complex includes a Universal theme park.

The attractions are the casino (which is in a large and impressive gaming hall), the SkyPark 57 storey high observation deck, as well as the usual bars and restaurants.

Also, they are presenting several shows- currently Lion King is the major drawcard.

It's worth a visit to see the architecture, experience the casino, and maybe enjoy a Singapore Sling in the Lobby Bar.

All that being said, I suspect it won't appeal to everyone! For them, take a day trip to Pulau Ubin, or take in the Botanic Gardens.

The Sands adds to the broad range of attractions for visitors and locals alike.

Remember: if you're a non-resident, take your passport for free entry to the Casino!!"
,,Wow.. one of its best in Singapore,5.0,,"One of the newest attractions in Singapore. Could not believe my eyes when I saw the architecture. It is three buildings in the boat shape. Have superb facilities, along with stay. The casino tables are too good. The staff is also friendly."
,,Worst customer service in Singapore.,1.0,,"We were staying in the MBS suite and had expected nothing but the best service, but we were deeply disappointed. A trip to the SkyPark had ruined the entire expectation of MBS. On the way to the SkyPark, the men in suits were extremely rude in their behavior and attitude towards the guests. We were shouted at by rude men in suits when we were making our way to the Eastern end of the SkyPark, which happened to be closed to visitors from 10pm. However, there was no sign that indicated it was closed. MBS ought to teach these men in suits basic customer service."
,,marina bay fantastic........,4.0,,It is totally artificially builded beautifully on the water.and the hotels and cassino and musieums and the water discoveries is really cant explanable...It should be tasted oncen in life..There is a three buildings and on that there is a boat shaped over there we can enjoy whole day ...
,,Engineering masterpieice,5.0,,"Recently paid a visit to the marina bay sands sky park ,one has to marvel that what a n engineering masterpiece it is. You must visit to fully appreciate the vastness of the building from the lifts to the sky park to the miniature canal, shopping arcades ,views of singapore, wet edge pool,gardens, ice rink etc."
,,i went with very high expectation thinking it would be like macau venetian but .....,4.0,,the rooms were like anyother general five star but nothing extraordinare.. the lobby was good and rooftop was interesting but after visiting atlantis dubai and macau venetian didnt find this all that great...
,,A marvel one can really enjoy A fantastic place Asian is proud off.,5.0,,"A hotel of great value and thevfacilities are un imaginable,
The swimming pool on the top of the Hotel is really a place to enjoy.
Top of the building , one can see the entire Singapore and scenic beauty can not be. Explained ,it should be personally seen and enjoyed.

I am definitely going to be staying there in my next trip.

,,Disappointed,1.0,,"I visited Marina Bay Sands on 2 Mar 2011. I was there to watch The Lion King at the Sands Theater. I understand that as a Premier Advantage member, with points accumulated I am able to redeem for car park charges.
The Lion King show ended around 11pm and I realized that the Premier Advantage counter at the retail area was closed. As such, I went to the levy counter at the casino near the theater to ask if help can be make to do the redeem for the car park.
I was being rejected and was told to pay the entry levy of $100 (I am a Singaporean) to enter the casino to make the redemption. This is so ridiculous. I do not understand why can't anyone help me on this, although I told the cashier at the Levy counter that I am a Singaporean and am not going to enter the casino that night. I do not mind to hand over my Premier Advantage card and my NRIC to proceed the redemption if need arises.
If the Premier Advantage counter staff inside the casino is so unhelpful, then I think the management should consider to have the Premier Advantage counter outside the casino to operate till a later timing.
I really would consider coming back to Marina Bay Sands again in future with such poor and unhelpful service."
,,Great Service From a Staff.,4.0,,"Excellect service for a staff, Mr Aldo . Brought us ard the huge property and intro us where the entertainment in the hotel. BRAVO..!"
,,"like a fish market, noisy and with no class",1.0,,"I don't know what star rating they pride themselves with, but I would not give them more than a 31/2 star.

No doubt the room is good(while it is new!), but once you step either downstairs or upstairs(the rooftop, whatever they call it!), it is like a very busy fish market. A lot of noise, shouting around, uncouth behaviour, etc. Totally no class at all. Nothing befitting a 4 or 5 star hotel. A big nightmare for my family.

This hotel definitely caters to the masses and its aim is definitely its bottom line, but nothing else. Only reason it exists is to make lots of money out of the gamblers.

I stayed there to see what it is like but no thanks, this is not the normal 5-star hotel(if it is!) for me nor my family. I brought my child to a local swimming club one day during our stay and she enjoyed her swim at the club much, much more than at the hotel rooftop!"
,,Very Poor Service,1.0,,"Like : The place has a very good decoration.

Dislike : Everything but the decor. Staffs and Servers are quite rude to small players, if you play for small money, don't expect to get nice smile and service like the other casino.
Very hard to get a drink inside casino, and all they've got only mineral waters, I once asked the server to get me drink and she didn't come back to me to bring my drinks but on the other hand she came back for the drinks requested by some of big players on my table and next table and asked them if there's anything they want more, and also not so many servers around.
No Texas Hold-em !

Bottom line, I will never recommend this casino to anyone who just want to have fun playing with little money, maybe for big whales it's kinda good advantage though. And also good if you just want to look around."
,,Discrimination Practiced,1.0,,"The hotel check in practices discrimination. They will only automatically upgrade your room to a Grand one if you are a Caucasian.

Aunt is a USA citizen but is Chinese, so when she checks in (2 rooms) with her Caucasian friends. Her friends gets the upgrade to Grand room automatically upon checking in. While she is left in her usual room even though booking of the 2 rooms were all under her name and she was dealing with the check in.

Counter Staff says only 1 room is left available for upgrade, and they didnt even bother to ask them who would prefer to upgrade, but juz automatically offered to the Caucasian couple.

Such discrimination practiced in a country that racial harmony is emphasized. Such a disgrace!"
,,A CASINO THAT PRETENDS TO BE NOTHING MORE,5.0,,"So I read a few reviews before going to Singapore about the new Casino which were not positve.
I can honestlly say that this casino is refershingly new and easy to use with the staff all very friendly and no one bothering me when I was there, as in Macau.
Plenty of action for all concerned with a great variety of tables for your choice.
Will happily re-visit the Marina bay and would recommend it to all."
,,This place is as nice or nicer than any Casino hotel in Vegas,5.0,,This place is just spactacular from a design point of view. Steller luxury goods mall attached. Unbelievable pool on the top floor that you have to see to believe. Three huge towers of rooms. Great club level privladges including club lounge on pool level on the roof. Worth spending a few nights here just to explore the beauty of this place. Big bright rooms with specatacular views of SIngapore harbor. Only 4 months old. Spectacular place.
,,"Wonderful experience, excellent service",5.0,,"This is one of those WOW moments, as you come closer and closer to the complex your heart starts to race. I had seen a few documentaries on its construction, so I was super keen to visit, and was not disappointed at anything. The SkyPark was amazing, the observation deck was closed the night we went there, but a security guard told us we could go to the bar on top of the SkyPark instead, so we got the amazing view, didn't have to pay the admission fee, but had to buy drinks, which were planning on doing anyways, so it worked out well!! The service was unreal, we met Kyle the supervisor, I had broken my camera and he offered to take a photo with his phone and email it for us, it turned out great, what a legend!! Then we went down and had dinner at one of the restaurants, amazing food!!!!!!! We then went to the blackjack tables, and although we all lost a LOT of money, the whole night was worth it, I can;t wait to come back!!!!"
,,Marina Bay Sands - Never again,1.0,,"My family and me arrived on the 30th Oct 2010 at about 1300hrs. We tried to check in but MBS was running full the night before and therefore, we were asked to wait for our rooms to be cleaned. We understood. We went for lunch and came back at 1600hrs and only got 1out of the 2 rooms that we booked. So we had 6 adults in 1 room. We told the front desk that we just needed the room before 6pm as we had a company’s dinner function that night itself.

From 5pm onwards, I kept on calling the ‘priority line’ to ask them with regards to my second room, but we were kept on hold. At 6pm, I called again and by then I was really angry about the whole waiting situation and again they put me on hold. I went down at 6.10pm to the front desk at tower 1. At the same time, a bellman came up to the room (#2457 Tower 2) to give us the key card to 2nd room we were supposed to get which was #2455. The bellman opened the door to l#2455 and to our surprised, there were still luggage in that room. The room (#2455 Tower 2) was occupied! My husband rang me up and I informed the front desk about the situation. He was shocked and offered me another room (#2768) and a late check out of 1600hrs the following day. I didn’t want to argue any longer and just accepted his offer.

We rushed to go for the dinner in which we were late due to the room change and all. During dinner, we had an ugly experience with one of the servers. Some of the servers spill food and drinks on us. Other than that, one of them spilled some drinks on one of my family members, and they did nothing. No apology and no one even came to wipe off the drink. I had to ask someone to come with a cloth and that to came after 5 minutes. The servers really do not know the basic rules of serving during dinner. They serve the food over peoples’ heads and just slam down the cutleries on the table when giving them for desserts. To our surprise, they actually gave us soupspoons to eat our desserts with.

After dinner, we head back to our room (#2768). As we entered the room, and switched on the lights, the whole drama started again. Every minute, the lights switches on and off by themselves. The curtains open and close by themselves. I remembered at 2245, I called the ‘priority service’ again to inform them about it and also told them that whatever that is happening is scaring my 3-year-old son! They said they will send someone up but by 15 minutes, I had enough and went down to the front desk. I met with another guest relations agent and told him about what happened and straight away he changed my room to #4355. In the middle of the night, I had to change my room again. With my bags of clothes and my crying son, we moved again at midnight.

The next day, we wanted to go for breakfast and found out that we have not received our coupons. I called ‘priority service’ and they transferred us to the front desk. I spoke to an agent. The breakfast is actually sponsored by our company. So I have requested for 6 breakfast coupons. The agent understood the situation and told us to just go for breakfast. During breakfast, we witnessed the servers being told off and servers spilling drinks and food, just like our dinner the night before. It was very disappointing.

My brother went out for a drive at midnight with the car, which he had parked, by valet. Upon returning at about 0130hrs, he wanted to re-park the car at valet but there were no valet drivers to park his car. He was asked to park at the casino, which is in the other building, and pay extra, when he already paid $12 for the parking! He noticed that there were a few valet drivers around but they just refuse to park his car when they saw him. In the end, he parked at the casino building in which he paid $26 for parking there!

Upon checking out, we met the first agent at the front desk. He asked how was our stay. I told him that I had to change room at midnight. He didn’t even apologise about the inconvenience but just shrug his shoulders and walked away. I was disgusted. Ms M checked us out. Upon receiving our bill, we were charged for breakfast for all 6 adults. I told her about all the moving and the conversation I had with her colleague on the phone, she took away the bill of 4 adults and still insisted that we pay for the 2 extra. Unfortunately, it was a Sunday; we couldn’t call the company’s office to verify on what was happening. We paid the bill and not wanting to delay the whole process and painful experience we had. Ms M’s facial expression did not help. I was in the hotel line before, working in a 5-star Hotel in Singapore, with that kind of facial expression will turn off any guests to the hotel. She didn’t even apologise and just gave the bill to us.

MBS, you guys are definitely not ready to open and the outlook of the hotel is pretty and nice but the inside of it all was a huge disappointment. To me, no point being all pretty and nice on the outside, the inside that matters – the people, your staff. We might be Singaporeans, but MBS, you must remember that word-of-mouth is a strong tool. During dinner, we had overseas guests, they too said about their disappointment in the hotel. Some even say, the service is just like Hotel 81. It’s sad that we have overseas guests saying all that."
,,SkyPark is the be all and end all of this hotel,3.0,,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights at one of their Club Rooms. At SGD 548 (including GST and VAT), it came with access to the SkyPark and its pool and lounge bar). It also included buffet breakfast, afternoon tea, cocktails and canapes, all at the Fuse Lounge since the Club Room is still under construction. They let you borrow iPads there as well as read local newspapers. There was also unlimited internet access in the rooms. The room was big and spacious so much so that it looked sparsely furnished and decorated. Nonetheless, it was very comfortable. However, it could not hold a candle to the rooms at Venetian Macao. The bathroom was equipped with hair dryer, magnified mirror which could be plugged in, and toiletries. The closet held 2 waffle cotton bathrobes, 2 pairs of slippers, 2 umbrellas, an iron and ironing board, and a flashlight. There was an in-room safe, electric kettle, Nespresso and coffee machine (which we did not use for fear of being charged), and a mini fridge full beverages. The last of which exhibited the extreme paranoia of the hotel for it had a sign which indicated that any item taken off its place for more than 30 seconds will be immediately charged to the bill. Housekeeping provided 2 bottles of mineral water per day, regardless if the previous day's bottles were opened/drank or not.
While I was reviewing the amenities of the Club Room and comparing it against the other rooms (non-suites), I noticed that the latter did not indicate it had hair dryer and toiletries. If they didn't have these, it would have been very odd considering they are a 5-star hotel and these are standard amenities in most hotels.

Pros:
- Excellent view and pool at the SkyPark. This made our stay worthwhile. Without this, I'd probably be writing a mostly mediocre review
- King size bed and down pillows were very comfortable
- Free airport shuttle to and from hotel which left every half hour
- You can leave your luggage at the front desk for free

Cons:
- Construction ongoing at the SkyPark distracted from the relaxing ambiance.
- At several parts of the hotel, guests are asked to flash their room card keys as evidence that they are in fact hotel guests. This is done when you go to the elevators for each of the Towers, upon exit at 55/F to transfer to the elevator going to the SkyPark, upon entry at the SkyPark, a few meters from the entrance just before you enter behind the pool area, and when you enter the pool area itself. This is because non-hotel guests can go up to the SkyPark for a fee. They are restricted from using the pool but they can still hang out at the corridor behind the pool area.
- Some parts of the hotel (i.e. pool, elevator) had noticeable wear and tear already. Perhaps they were evidence that the construction of the hotel was too rushed for the contractors to be meticulous.
- Disorganised queue at check in and check out. There is no single queue. Anybody can queue behind anybody already being entertained by staff. This does not ensure that the first person gets served.
- Food in buffet breakfast, room service, or cocktail hour was good but not spectacular. They don't vary the food served daily during breakfast. The queue to get eggs cooked takes some time as only 1 person is doing it.
- The Club Room came with a nightly turn down service which oddly enough we only received on the 1st night and not on the 2nd.
- Cleaning staff arrived while we were out eating breakfast (10am). Given that we had checked in at 3pm only and have not even taken a bath, there was not much to clean up. Moreover, we were left with a used bathroom and used towels until the next day when we checked out.
- The Marina Bay MRT station is too far to walk back to the hotel. The directions to the bus stop are too confusing. We wasted an hour walking around moving from 1 bus stop to another. In the end, we gave up and walked back to the hotel with a limp.

Suggestions:
- Get a view facing the city. It is breathtaking at night when the river and various establishments (i.e Fullerton Hotel, Esplanade) are lit up.
- Opt for a room at Tower 1 or 3. If you stay at Tower 2, you need to transfer elevators at the 55th floor to get to the 57th floor where the SkyPark is.
- Do not eat at the food vendors at the basement of Marina Bay Shoppes. How can they sell worse food in measly portions for twice the price (and size) at the hawkers?!
- Do not give tips (credit card or cash) when you order at the SkyPark lounge. One of the staff told us they don't get it anyway. I feel sorry for them and only infuriated me further.
- Take advantage of the free bottle of mineral water. Bottled/imported beverages are almost as expensive as meals at hawker vendors.
- Sunset is at 6:30 to 7pm. Go up to the SkyPark around that time to enjoy the Golden hour.
- The SkyPark lounge is not such a good vantage point to take pictures. The glass walls get in the way of taking a good picture but it does keep you safe."
,,More Than Just Casino At Marina Bay Sands Singapore,5.0,,"I'd a spectacular day out @ Marina Bay Sands, bringing my friend from overseas to this new Integrated Resort. It turned out to be a fantastic notion as I felt like a tourist myself; indulging in fine dining, mesmerized by the world's largest outdoor pool & falling in love with the panoramic views of my beloved country.

Upon arrival at the hotel, I headed straight to the magnificent Sands SkyPark, boasting rooftop restaurants, nightclubs, hundreds of trees & plants & an observatory with 360-degree views of the Singapore skyline.

Entrance fee to the SkyPark is @ S$20 but my friend, which is a senior citizen got a discount & paid only S$17. Visitors will learn about the construction of the SkyPark through a complimentary audio guide.

The device allows visitors to hear commentaries on key commercial & historic parts of Singapore, all of which can be appreciated from unique vantage points

The SkyPark is also home to the world's longest elevated swimming pool, with 150m vanishing edge, perched 200 meters above the ground. Click on the website for photos & write-up!"
,,Probaly the worst casino in the world!,1.0,,"Went to Marina Bay Sands, it would have to be the worst casino I have ever been to. Although not a huge gambler, I do usually like the fun atmosphere of casinos and have been to them all around the the world from Australia to Las Vegas.

To get into the Marina Bay Sands, you ahve to show your passport. As a foreigner you do not have to pay the $100 entry fee, however having to show your passport every time you enter and exit is most annoying.

The place is full of smoke. Fort a country where you are barely allowed to smoke in public places, this place just reeked of smoke. There is are no non-smoking areas at all.

There is no bar within the casino, nor do the drinks trolleys offer beer or wine! No-one could point me in any direction to get a beer (if there was such a place, the staff certainly did not know about it!!).

The minimum bet at card tables was $25, so nowhere for 'novices' to have a flutter for some fun.

The crowd was mostly unhappy people, with frowns. There was no 'fun' to this place, as you would expect at a casino/ entertainment complex.

There is no public transport, you have to catch a taxi to get there (or walk 30 mins to the nearest underground station). Even the much touted Sky Park on the roof, you pay $20 for the pleasure of going up to see it, but you arent allowed into the park unless you are a hotel guest!

Overall, a very boring and frustraing place, which has no atmosphere (except for the smokey haze).

Never again."
,,All the atomsphere of a morgue,1.0,,"Live in Singapore and took some friends who were visiting to the Casino. Clearly a low point of their trip -

poor selection of games - no craps table, singapore stud poker - what is that nonsense ?
1 small sitting area infront of noisy stage with weak acts is your only alternative if you want an alcoholic drink
not enough staff on the floor serving the complementary coffee and water

designed to maximize how much of your money they can grab in the shortest amount of time - while minimizing your fun - if walmart opened a casino this is what it would be like"
,,Hotel not meeting the hype,1.0,,"Let me first say that I am a frequent traveler and have seen and experienced the atmosphere of a lot of ""top of the chain"" 5-star hotels.

My experience with The Sands Singapore was a disappointing event. You pay the overprice of 400 SGD (~290 USD) a night, and what you're faced with is:
1. The water from the shower head is weak. There is no way of adjusting the power of the water.
2. Takes about 3-4 min. to get warm water!
3. Stains (dirt?!) on the furniture, even though the hotel itself opened a few weeks ago.
4. The view for the vast majority of the hotel guests is facing the ""waters"" and not the city, which is amazing.
5. Opening your balcony door will produce the sound of constant construction only coming to a halt at ~8pm.

You don't get much for the price you're paying. There are other hotels in town which provides BETTER rooms and view for similar price. Where is the complimentary water that comes with nearly ALL 5 star hotels?

The only positive experience with this hotel was the amazing structure of the building and the shorter journey to and from the airport.

The Casino review... I have none. They first required passport (government issued IDs are not accepted, e.g. your driver's license, your national ID card etc.), which we didn't have on at that time. Being familiar with the casinos in Macau, you don't need passport nor a dress code that involves jeans or slippers upon entry. By the looks of it, the Government and The Sands try to implement standards that are NOT standards elsewhere.

The Skypark & Infinity pool review... Packed, lots of noise, lots of kids during the weekend. Where was the bar/lack of? Didn't know where to order drinks or food. The only positive was the scenic view of Singapore!

Over all rating... 2/10."
,,room amentities is 4 star,3.0,,"beware to stay on weekend the infinity pool jam with children no where to walk

dont stay at tower two ,there is no connecting through the 57 th floor (pool ) u have to go by tower 1 or 3 which is unconvenience and confusing

no seating at lobby only vip paisa check-in and 20 mins check-in

casino take long walk and shop is open 40% only

no free internet here

view is spectacular on 57 floor"
,,Wait a little later,2.0,,"Went there for a few hours last week. As I had a visitor, I didn't have to pay the 100SGD fee to get in. I have been to casinos in Vegas and Macau, and I would say that base on my experience here, it has a long way to go, but I am sure that given time, the casino would turn out much better than right now.

Pros
- Large and modern decor
- Not smoky
- Lots of cleaning crew to take out your empty drinks

Cons
- Long wait just to check your passport (and government issued identity card won't work - it has to be a passport) and they check twice!
- Very slow service! - all the dealers must be so new that they took such a long time doing their job! The chips were counted one by one, and then if someone won a substantial amount of money (like SGD 200 or something), the dealer had to wait for a supervisor for approval before giving the winning chips to that person! It became very inefficient as a Russian Roulette game could take up to 10 minutes for just one round!
- Lack of cocktail bar - I didn't see a cocktail bar nearby, but they had coke and bottled water cart that was pushed out - but they would all be consumed within 2 minutes, as they don't push the cart often enough. So the lack of beverage/cocktail service is a big let-down.
- The cashier took a long time to count money
- Several machines were not working
- There wasn't the typical casino noise (I didn't hear any ""music"" from the slot machines) so it was quiet quiet
- Only one entry/exit point despite the huge size of the casino - lots of walking back and forth the same distance
- Generally the service was quite poor overall"
,,Singapore: Marina Bay Sands-OMG!,1.0,,"First of all I would like to say that I'm by no means a huge gambler, however, I do frequent casinos on occasion (about once a month) for the atmosphere and I do play at the tables. After having been to most of the casinos in Macau, a friend of mine suggested that I go visit the ones in Singapore while I was here. Just out of curiosity, I decided to see how far the industry has grown.

At first glance: The area looks nice and the architecture quite interesting. The area around the casino is still under construction but that didn't surprise me as the casino is their money maker and usually the first attraction to open.

Getting In: Trying to get into the casino is quite a hassle compared to most places. Since Singapore citizens or holders of permanent residency cards must pay a levy of $100 per 24 hour entry, everyone entering the casino must go through several ID checks. The security checks your ID at the gates, which then you must queue to have your ID placed through a scanner (separate lines for locals and foreigners) and then a final age confirmation check located near the gaming floor. 5-10 min. process. Not too bad considering.

Gaming: Large Open Area with the Second Floor (non-smoking) overlooking the First Floor (smoking). The Atmosphere is not as exciting as most other places I have been.
I decided to play a few hands, later to realize that I had been inside for over 2 hours. No drinks were offered during this time. I decide that it's time to leave.

OMG!!!: Upon heading to the cashier and leaving, I decide to get myself a drink (coffee, tea, water) from one of their few push carts. ""NO, these drinks are for the players only!"" said Joan Janis (the cart pusher). Apparently, playing for 2 hours but not showing a stack of chips in your hand means that you are NOT a player. In shock, I went to her supervisor to inquire about the service and regulations of acquiring a simple cup of coffee there. I was told that the drinks were for everyone and that the employee ""maybe"" new on the job. Wow, new on the job??? Do they not go through a training program or company orientation? In the end, I got a bottle of water and the coffee............ probably still reserved for the ""players""."
,,avoid until 2011,1.0,,"the entire Marina Bay Sands should not have got a license to open - it isn't ready. in the casino there were workmen gumming the carpets and wondering around in hard hats. the power went out in the hotel and convention center. and the theater, museum, shops, restaurants etc aren't ready at all. the hotel is a beautiful building, and the complex will be a destination, in about a year's time."
,,Marina Bay Sands - Oh dear !!!!,1.0,,"I went to the Casino last night, I came away very dissapointed.
Why may you ask ?

1. Very smokey. You would think the American influence and Singapore cleanliness they would insist on a non smoking policy.
2. No free alcoholic drinks for gamblers dropping $100's per second.... (what is with that ?) Tea, Water and Cola only.
3. Totally under staffed for the soft opening. Erm... I'm thinking here... I thought the usual protocol is to over staff during the soft opening to guarantee the ultimate experience and gain loyal visitors ?
4. The Casino is quite huge, but don't be fooled with the assumption that it is in the beautiful three tier building you see in the pictures - ""With the palm trees on the roof"".
It's not. It sits behind it.
5. There isn't a fun feeling to the place, it's not Asia's answer to Vegas whatsoever . It is very beige / grey and serious looking. The restaurants are situated at the side of the dome lke building and they certainly do not seem alluring in anyway.
6. Within this HUGE casino, there is one.... YES - ONE !!!! bar that sits on the ground floor, that actually looks like a barless lounge. However, if you want to take a seat in this approx 50 max person lounge, you are forced to walk through the smokers haze on the ground floor. (Doesn't smoke rise ? doh! - sucks for non smokers)
7. You need to show your passport / ID ""THREE"" times just to get into the casino.
OK I understand security these days, but to be checked three times.... I may as well go chill in JFK airport for the experience.
8. On a positive note, ....... actually, there isn't one. So, I am glad to say I have been there, have the T shirt... etc etc. I won't be going back anytime soon.
$5 Billion...... see for yourself."
