,,Excellent and beautiful trail,5.0,,"I started the trail at Kensington Ridge SMRT station. Via Singapore Science Park I entered Kent Ridge Park which has the canopy walk as its main attraction. The next adjacent park is Hort Park with its beautiful little gardens. The uniquely shaped Alexandra Arch pedestrian bridge connects Hort Park with Telok Blangah Hill Park. The latter park is crossed via amazing elevated skywalks until the amazing Henderson Waves pedestrian bridge. The trail is continued via Mount Faber Park, Faber Peak and then via the Marang trail ending at Harbourfront SMRT station. Total length is ca 7 km and provides awesome far views of the city, harbour, Sentosa island, unique design bridges and beautiful nature. Highly recommended!"
,,Close to Nature,4.0,,Enjoy the greenery and the connecting bridges. 3 parks are connected to each other.one of the best spot to enjoy the panoramic view of the city
,,Beautiful !,5.0,,"This is a great place to escape to if the city has got too much – it’s wonderfully relaxing and it’s hard to believe you’re still so close to the city. As with everything in Singapore, it’s clean and well maintained – but it gets extremely hot, so make sure you wear loose/light clothes!"
,,A nice walk near to the city,3.0,,"The Southern Ridge is a relatively easy walk. It is a nice experience if you want to mix in a bit of nature during your holiday. It was a nice experience with the mixture of trails, bridges and walkways (treetop walk). There wasn't a wow factor for me, but I enjoyed the peace and quiet.

Start near Harbourfront MRT Station, this is the easiest walk as you start with a 10 minute climb and the rest is either level or descending. There are plenty of places to stop along the way. I recommend you do this early though as it starts to get pretty hot in the afternoon.

Completed in 2 hours at a slow pace."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Very pretty. A nyc experience to walk among the tree tops . It’s just a walk among the trees but very enjoyable. Not to mention it’s free . It’s was a better experience than little India and China town . It was different and beautiful
,,Great outdoor activity,5.0,,"Facing the exit of the MRT station is the beginning of this wonderful trail. One has to be mindful that the first 15 minutes of the walk is the equivalent of walking up 24 storeys to reach to the top. There is also a cable car ride in place of the semi energetic start of the trail. The whole trail is well signposted. Rest rooms and cold drinks vending machines are strategically located. The look and sound of nature is obvious as one walk, jog or run along the trail. The Henderson Wave and Hilltop walks were interesting."
,,An amazing walk!,5.0,,"My partner and I recently walked the Southern Ridges from Hort Park to Harbourfront and loved every minute! Most of the guidebooks recommend walking the route from Harbourfront (which is harder as it’s steeper!) but we loved that when we finished the walk at Harbourfront we could continue walking around Marina Bay (where Harbourfront is the closest MRT). The scenery along the walk is fabulous - green, lush ‘bush’ with the occasional skyscraper in the background! Whilst we loved being in the city during our stay it was great to get out into nature... we highly recommend this walk to all (ages and fitness levels - it’s pretty easy, apart from the heat!!)."
,,A true Singapore experience - but come prepared for the weather,5.0,,"The Southern Ridges walk is an excellent Singapore experience, offering some special moments, as well as being a great way to get some exercise. All up the track is about 10 km in length, starting from the Harbour Front MRT station and ending at the Kent Ridge station, although there are one or two spots along the way you can bail out if you so desire. Our highlights were the superb views from Mt Faber, the wonderful forest trail through the rainforest canopy and Henderson Waves bridge, seeming to tower (36 m) over the busy highway below. Hort Park was also interesting, and proved very useful place to shelter from the torrential downpour we encountered. Of course, Singapore is hot and humid so don some sunscreen, wear a hat and bring an umbrella - we had a couple of drenching downpours with not much shelter nearby. Bring water too, though there are a few drinking water fountains (as well as public toilets) along the way, as well as drink vending machines. Despite all the signs about wild monkeys along the trail (and not to feed them etc) we were a bit disappointed we didn't see any."
,,"Best place for runner, nature lover and photographer",5.0,,"My favorite for morning running and jogging! Love the nature, cleanness, and runner friendly! Start stairs climbing from Mt. Faber, Henderson Waves, and Forrest Walk. Continue to Labrador Park when still have energy.

Transportation: Taxi, MRT : Harbour Front (Mt. faber), Labrador Park, or Public Bus.

Come early around 6-7 am to see sun rise from Henderson Waves.

During weekend, would be more crowded with runners but will motivate you to run further.

Bring water, hat, and use proper running shoes. Toilet and water could be found at Mt. Faber. Make sure your stamina is good."
,,Get away from the crowds!,5.0,,"When you need a break from the hype of Sentosa or the bustle of Chinatown , definitely give this walking track a try. Get off the MRT at Habour Front and take the underpass to come up at Marang Trail. There are a whole heap of stairs ahead but getting them out of the way early is best and then the rest of the trail is mostly downhill. The track is very well maintained - you could do this in stilettos if ankles could cope! Taking water is a must, although there are vending machines at various points that sell bottled water and other snacks. I did Marang Trail to Mount Faber, the Henderson Wave to Alexandra Rd and stopped and started to take in the views and photos over about a 2.5 period which was a leisurely pace. Definitely worth doing early as I looked like I'd been thrown in the bay by the end (which was then good excuse to come back to my accom for a swim and a Singapore Sling). There were further trails to explore but I know my limits.

From Alexandra Rd, I walked another 15 minutes back to the MRT, but there are also plenty of buses on this route if you've had enough sweating for one day.

Fair warning...although the track was fairly quiet and I was happy to gently nod good morning to the few passers by, it was mid week. There were still lots of buses taking big crowds of tourists to the top of Mount Faber, so this bit was a little overwhelming if you're trying to avoid the hoards."
,,Great way to be close to nature,5.0,,Very well planned walkways make you feel you are in a forest and away from the hustle bustle of the city. We had a walk right up to Mount Faber and it was very refreshing!
,,Forest forreals,5.0,,Really great place if you’re a nature lover! You can bring your boyfriend/girlfriend along although I don’t have one!
,,Nice hiking trail!,5.0,,you will be surprised there is a beautiful hiking trail in the dense Singapore. I saw a lot of wild life on this trip. Be sure to bring some bug spray with you and try to do the hike in the morning. It does get hot up there.
,,worth a visit,4.0,,"I started the trail from the harbour front MRT station, and went through the various landmarks.
The Alkaff mansion was impressive, Henderson wave and the Alexandra arches were interesting.
The entire trail was well marked out and easy to follow, except the last part which was queerly named the canopy walk, when there was hardly any canopy. The sign for the canopy walk was also not clear at some points. Several hikers including us had to hunt for it."
,,Great Walk,5.0,,"We recently spent a few days in Singapore and we did some of The Southern Ridges walk. You can enter and exit out of the 10 klm walking tracks at different point, we finished up at the gondola so we could catch it down to Sentosa Island. Would highly recommend doing this and would suggest morning before it gets too hot."
,,Tired but rewarding walk,4.0,,"Shame to say that as a Singaporean, I didn't try walking this till the event organized by CCF. It could be a little tiring for those who are not use to long walk. But it's definitely a very good and rewarding experience worth going at least once."
,,View was worth the hike,4.0,,"View was spectacular at the top! But i must say, the hike upwards from Habourfront MRT exit at Marang Trail was pretty tiring, but once you get to the top is all worth it. You’ll be able to get a bird’s eye view of many buildings at the top and even hop on a cable car at Mount Faber Peak, before walking towards Henderson Wave, and eventually making your way to the elevated pathway which can actually lead to hortpark. It’s definitely a great way to exercise and catch up with your friends!"
,,Nice place to have a long walk enjoying nature and singapore,5.0,,"Ideal place to start your day if you love walking or jogging. My advice is to start from Marang trail near harbor front as it better and less strenuous as you go towards the end point. it may take about 2-3 hours. Carry water, as you are in the sun for quite some time but the nature and sky line of singapore is worth seeing."
,,Great hike,4.0,,"We started all the way up, and walked our way to the city crossing three parks. Good escape from the busy city."
,,The canopy walk is amazing,5.0,,"We took the MRT to Harbourfront and walked out Exit D and found the road up to Mt Faber. The first 15 - 20 mins are up steps and uphill but after that it is either fairly flat or slightly downhill so make sure you go this way and not the reverse.
The Henderson Waves bridge is an interesting design. The Canopy walk in particular is amazing. I think it is at least 2km long. We saw Scarlet-backed Flowerpecker birds along with a number of other interesting birds. A lot of the walk is in shade of the trees but it is still hot so bring water. We exited down to Hort Park and then took a bus back. The next time we go to Singapore (and there will be a next time!), we will continue on the rest of the route. The walk we did took around 2 hours but we stopped lots of times to look at birds, bees, flowers and trees. As it was mid morning, mid week, there were very few other people on the walk."
,,Lovely walk,4.0,,"Lovely walk but very busy, we went at the weekend so maybe that is why there was not a huge variety of bird life. Pleasant walk though."
,,Breath-taking!,4.0,,"It was a very nice experience to be walking around. Away from the bustling city. With the sweltering heat, be sure to bring drinks and a towel."
,,A pleasant walk but you don't really escape the city,4.0,,"This is a really nice area to go for a walk; Kent ridge park is quiet and relaxing, Mount Faber offers some lovely views and the treetop walk is a different experience to what you would get elsewhere in Singapore.
The main disappointment is that there is never an illusion that you are out of the city; the walk is quite busy (especially Henderson waves) and the city is always in view."
,,The treetop walkway is too short.,3.0,,"This is well known to provide a tree top view around the area, but the bridge is too short and it is always crowded with people taking selfie. It is a little disappointing after walking all the way to reach there and you only get to spend less than 5 mins there. After we waited for the people in front of us finished their photo taking, the security is always telling us to move along. It is quite disappointing that we need to move on before we really take in and enjoy the view."
,,Hidden Gem,5.0,,Really enjoyed our afternoon walk through this walking trail. Elevated above and in the treetops and had some great views.
,,Relaxing,4.0,,"A piece of green heaven in the center of just Singapore, and definitely a better walk compared to the usually very crowded East Coast Park. I started walking from Kent Ridge Park and it was indeed a nice, and peaceful one. You can get to experience the secondary forests of Singapore and know a bit more about the WW II history of Singapore."
,,A delightful 10 km walk!,4.0,,"We climbed up a hill from the carpark opposite Vivocity, next to a food centre. We walked by a shady forest with many seeds on the ground. We passed by the Mount Faber Cable car station and ticketing office, and continued walking toward Telok Blangah Hill. Henderson Wave was amazing! It curved around tree tops and soared above roads. We continued up steel treetop bridges, and crossed over to the Hort Park. From there we proceeded to Kent Ridge Park, and enjoyed walking through the forest. Highly recommended for the views - a good way to appreciate nature."
,,Walk on the wild side!,5.0,,"If you want to escape downtown Singapore in favour of nature for a few hours then head to the Southern Ridges, a fabulous linear park running parallel to the ocean along the hills to the south of Singapore. There are beautiful gardens, treetop walks, wildlife and fantastic views!"
,,Wonderful views,5.0,,"An exhilarating walk from Vivocity mrt to Hort Park! You need to climb some rather steep stairs to get on the trail to Mt Faber Park but that's only about 10 minutes uphill for a reasonably fit person and you can always stop to catch your breath, there are railings to cling on to if you're elderly. Enjoy the leaf-litter communities at both sides as you go up. You're rewarded with a wonderful view of Sentosa and the cable cars once you reach the top of the stairs with the boat-like structure. A kind of Singapore hanam is visible on the treetops but I stead of cherry blossom you have local flowers. The vegetation is lush with colorful flowers, even bamboo and angsana in their pods as you walk on the sturdy steel path at the same height as the treetops. Looking down into the valley as you exit Henderson, you see banana trees and plenty of foliage. Colourful boards provide useful botanical information and pictures of birds you can spot if you're lucky. We saw one monkey, boldly resting against the rail and scratching his vitals but it was well-behaved and didn't attempt to snatch anything but we kept our distance, obeying the warnings posted everywhere.
A wonderful two hours well-spent. We appreciated the clean public toilet halfway but refilled our water bottles only when we got to Hort Park where there's a water fountain.
From Hort Park we took a bus, 61 if I recall correctly to Queensway and then to the Food Village, a large hawker centre where we dug into the prawn and pork rib noodles! IKEA is nearby so you may want to drop by for their soya ice-cream and coffee, both at 50 cents!"
,,Tropical jungle within sight of soaring skyscrapers,4.0,,"This will get you out of the shopping centres and the high-rises of the CBD. Walk as many sections as you wish but be sure to go through the greenhouses and gardens of Hort Park and then on to the treetop level of the Forest Walk. What makes this really fascinating is that you are walking at tree height through jungle but always with glimpses of Singapore's myriad of high buildings, both commercial and residential. If you descend after crossing the Henderson Waves bridge you can easily catch a bus on the road below that will have you back in the Colonial District and the River within 15 minutes or so. Take water as it can be pretty hot in the forest."
,,What a wonderful place to go for a walk,5.0,,"We went here in the early morning and spent a couple of hours walking the trails. I believe we could easily have spent another hour or more exploring. The trails and nice with nice views along the way. There are also a number of great things to see along the way like the little gardens, etc. We had a great time and really enjoyed it. There are no entry fees and the paths are very nice and well maintained. My only wish is that we had a bit more time to explore the area. Very peaceful and pretty. We started off at Kent Ridge Park and walked through to Henderson waves. The paths were very easy to walk and probably good for anyone with reasonable mobility (i.e. do not need to be in great shape to walk this one)"
,,Lovely walk!,4.0,,"We spent a few hours towards the middle of the day after it had finished raining. We started from Habor Front MRT and began walking a large amount of stairs. It didn't take long, the trail is well maintained and easy. Next we headed towards My Faber which was filled with 2 large tourist buses. We quickly continued walking along to wander Henderson Waves which wasn't too busy and walked through following signs to the tree top/earth walk. We ended at Hort Park as we were short on time but hope to do the whole thing next time with a run involved (we were doing some shopping in Vivo City first to avoid the rain. On the way to Hort Park we spotted a paradise tree snake which was pretty cool! The paths can be confusing on first look, but any direction you go leads back so just keep that in mind if it is your first time!"
,,Great place,5.0,,We went here for a Sunday morning walk. It is lovely. You forget you are in a big city when you walk here. You are surrounded by nature. There are lots of people out walking and exercising. What a great place. Wish I lived next to it. I would go everyday.
,,Unexpected Pleasure,5.0,,"What a fantastic place to visit. There are four parks that all connect. Mount Faber Park and Telok Blangah Hill Park, two of the four nature parks along The Southern Ridges. There are also HortPark and Kent Ridge Park along the ridges. Each offering a different nature experience. My favorite was the Forest walk in Telok Blangah Hill Park. It has elevated walkways through the forest. If you like unusual architecture, the Alexandra Bridge, at the end of Telok park, is really unique. There are also the Henderson Waves, just down from the cable car trails at Mount Faber Park."
,,Walk atop a forest!,4.0,,"A nice brisk walk above the trees via winding walkways suspended above the trees. Pleasant walk in the early morning, but gets progressively hot and humid in the later morning and afternoon. But if you are there for the exercise and sightseeing, how fast ro slow you cover the ridges depends on your walking speed and time to slow down to take in the scenery! Part of a series of connected parks in the garden city."
,,Superb trail,5.0,,"Easy walking, great views and feel of tropical rain-forest in city center. Not so much as animals, but it was OK as we so many animals in wild Central Water Catchment trails. To cover all track will take 1-2 hours max"
,,Great green space,4.0,,"Great space to get away into some nature. Directions are a bit obscure at times, & we had maintenance work to contend with (we were unable to go into certain areas which meant a lengthy alternative route or just as lengthy double back). Great views from Mt Faber & the Hederson Waves. Can easily spend 4-5 hours walking this track. Have a look through Hort Park as well, nice garden sections, and a market if you go on a Saturday. Take plenty of water. Also take a picture of the map at the start of the trail, is not perfect but gives some guidance along the way. We got off at Pasir Panjang MRT & was quite a walk through the ‘suburbs’, but felt it may have been better to get off at Kent Ridge MRT."
,,Beautiful views of the Ridges,5.0,,This is a good walk in the heat of Singapore but it si rewarding due to the sights and sounds of the forest below
,,If in need of exercise the Southern Ridges has the perfect scenery,5.0,,"Staying on Sentosa Island the Southern Ridges walks are close, located just near Vivo City Shopping Centre. Due to the heat it is advisable to start early. We walked to Mt Faber and then down to the wave bridge taking the same route back. There is georgeous scenery & views all the way with lots of shade from the tree canopy’s. I recommend on bringing plenty of water & dressing lightly. Overall a most enjoyable morning."
,,Worth it. Great experience,5.0,,"A free activity for friends and family and great for couples too!! It may get hot and humid during summer, so dress light!"
,,Spectacular walking trails,5.0,,"Leave the urban jungle behind for a day and explore this truly inspiring amenity right just minutes from the heart of the city. I took the cable car from Sentosa to Mt Faber and followed the well marked paths all the way to the pond at Kent Ridge. Highlights along the route included the Henderson Waves bridge walk, canopy boardwalks and Hort Park. Avoiding the mid-day heat is advisable and taking plenty of water, snacks and head cover is strongly recommended."
,,What a pretty area,5.0,,"Started at Telok Blangah MRT, walked up to Henderson Waves pedestrian walkway, then through forest walk and finally canopy walk ended at Kent Ridge MRT. Gorgeous scenery and views. A lot of paths were shaded. About a 5 mile walk."
,,Wonderful walk great views,5.0,,We did the full 10k route. The start a little confusing but if you head into the science park you find the footpath. The walk is varied from tropical elements to parkland and forest canopy. Saw a couple of monitor lizards. The views are wonderful and the end at the cable car is excellent. If you want the cable car I suggest you book tickets in advance.
,,Beautiful scenery,5.0,,It was recommended to take a walk to Henderson wave and continue to Southern Ridge. The view was great and you can see the southern part of Singapore. The walk was tiring but its worth every minute.
,,"For walkers and country lovers,this is a treat",5.0,,"This is a well constructed route with some metal path ways in the trees and spectacular foot bridges. Great views , of course"
,,Very surprisingly connected parks in Singapore,4.0,,"The Southern Ridges parks are all very well connected by nice wooden bridges, pedestrian walk ways.

We started the walk from the Telok Blangah Park near the Sentosa Cable car and walk our way slowly and nicely through the various parks. We even found wild banana tree along the way!

The bridge linking the parks was very well design and won an architectural award.

We took half a day to walk all the 6 linked park stretches about 10km."
,,Walk above the trees,4.0,,"If you want to get some silence in the middle of Singapore, start the trip from Alexandra Road and walk to Harbour front. You will get rest for your ears, amzing views for your eyes and your body will be a bit exhausted. Take enough water with you"
,,Nice walk,4.0,,"The walk varies from steel platforms above the trees, through parks, over bridges, before walking down from Mt Faber cable car station to the welcome air conditioning of Vivo City."
,,AN AMAZING WALK,5.0,,We walked from Alexandra Road to the Cable Car Station for Sentosa and can definately recommend this lovely walk. It is varied and accessible to all it took us just over 1 hour. Lovely views and easy walking
,,Must do in Singapore to enjoy the rainforest right in the middle of the city,5.0,,"I started off at bus station Aft Hortpark. Even though it was around 5PM, it was very quiet on the treetop walk and I very muched enjoyed the views, the scents and all the sounds from the wildlife. It took me about 20-30 minutes to make my way to Henderson Wave bridge where I watched the sunset. It is very well signposted, so you cannot miss the way. After the sunset, I went up to Mount Faber viewpoint. From there you have a wonderful view of the skyline of the city. By the time I went back, it was already dark. I still took the stairs down through the jungle. There were no lights, so I used my cell phone as a torch. It was a bit scary going down there at night alone, but it only took about 5-10 minutes until I reached the exit right in front of Harborfront MRT. Definitely a must do for a nice sunset."
,,Canned jungle walk,3.0,,"A well graded, well laid out and clean walk between a few tiny secondary remnant forest patches still to be found in Singapore. Some glimpses of what the island of Singapore must have looked like at the start of the last century."
,,The Southern Ridges Singapore,5.0,,"A very enjoyable walk above the trees,watching the birds,looking at the amazing views. The Henderson Waves pretty good too,great workmanship.Not too arduous walk for a hot morning."
,,Fabulous walking,5.0,,"High above the trees you would never know you were in a city. The path is well marked with cold drink vending machines and water fountains along the way. Much of it is in shade and there is plenty of bird song and you may just catch sight of monkeys. Yes
it is humid but take your time and read the information boards as you walk along"
,,Lovely walk,5.0,,"Do this in the morning. Start at Hort Park and enjoy the foliage and flowers. Take your binoculars so you can bird watch. It is not a difficult walk, suitable for children and older adults. Just adjust your pace. There are places to stop and admire the scenery and take a seat. Do bring your own water bottle."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"Walked the whole Ridge walk (10 km). Very enjoyable with lots to see. Fantastic views of the city and the green parks. Part of the walk is a Canopy walk and also through Hort Park (botantical gardens). Well worth the effort, but wear good walking shoes!! There are very few tourists and the air is much cooler than the city, fabulous."
,,Great outdoor activity for a wide age range within the family.,5.0,,"We are a family with a teenager and a 9yo, and this walk with a slight hike was great to enjoy outdoor time.

Recommend to start at Kent Ridge Park, in particular, to take the Canopy Walk first. That was what got the 9yo excited and eager to continue. At the end of the Canopy Walk, you can start the trek through Kent Ridge Park into HortPark where there are pockets of gardens and nursery plots to slow down, take photos, etc. Do check out the scarecrow — Southeast Asian style.

Proceed thereafter to the Forest Walk, through Alexandra Arc, which is another elevated bridge walk. Lovely to see a different side of Singapore. Also great to see varying sizes and stages of reforestation plots. It was just amazing to see the efforts placed into creating all this greenery.

Another highlight of the walk is the Henderson Waves. Kids had a lot of fun there.

You can then proceed to Faber Peak or, like us, we descended and left the walk for a late lunch at HarbourFront Vivocity.

Definitely a walk worth taking."
,,Great hiking,5.0,,Great hiking trail in Singapore! If you would like to see more of Nature then it's made for you!! ;)
,,Bridge,5.0,,gorgeous architecture of the bridge! must see! great quiet walking and overlooking the city. A hidden treasure!
,,Best running trail in the sky,5.0,,"I love this place so much that we come here almost mostly. Being a person that like jogging, this is a must go place for joggers. Make a round trip if you park, it will be around 6km run."
,,Really nice to do when visiting singapore,5.0,,"I have taken this track a few times and I am never bored of it. Nice place to share with a loved one or friends... Count 3 hours to take it slowly and you can even stop somewhere on the way at Gillman barracks.
I recommend to anyone visiting singapore."
,,Loved this.,5.0,,"We walked along the ridges on Sunday, great experience. People watched as the locals picnicked and enjoyed the green open spaces. The high walkway thru the trees was spectacular. So glad we made time to do this. Enjoy."
,,Go in the morning,4.0,,"In hot and humid Singapore, this is another place you should visit in the morning. The heat in the afternoon becomes unbearable from noon till late afternoon. It would be okay if you stay in the shaded areas of the trail, but to fully enjoy the scenery and experience the full trail, I would suggest going in the early morning.

Wear sports clothing, I've seen people come dress in jeans and ladies in dresses...also, bring drinking water."
,,A Memorable Encounter,5.0,,"I’m a great fan of the Southern Ridges, so of course I took my Thai partner Ratchanok up to catch the grand views. She had a memorable encounter there; all three of us can laugh about it now (assuming cobras are able to laugh), but none of us was laughing then. I’ll give a brief overview of the Southern Ridges first, then tell you what happened, and end this review with some basic safety tips in case you have a similar encounter, either there or elsewhere. I’ll state up front, however, that I rate the Southern Ridges 5 stars and definitely do recommend that you walk the Ridges.

The Southern Ridges are a line of hill-tops running between the Ayer Rajah Expressway to the north, and the West Coast Highway to the south. They provide a grand walk notable for splendid views of (a) the Singapore Strait, offshore islands and (on clear days) Sumatra; and (b) jungle (see Jungle to Strait and Jungle Skyline photos). If I have an entire day to kill, I like to start my walk at the western-most point, Bukit Chandu. From its museum, you wind down to Canterbury Road and go through the horticultural park (HortPark) to the Southern Ridges trail proper, which is at the intersection of Hyderabad and Alexandra Roads (the latter named in honor of the Danish princess who had the grave misfortune of marrying the Prince of Wales; getting a street named after her in Singapore was small recompense). From the Alexandra Arch, you continue eastward, going to the top of Telog Blangah Hill, then down and across the Henderson Waves to Mount Faber. From Mount Faber Station you can either take the gondola down to Sentosa Island or walk downhill to the Coast Road via a stairway on the south slope of Mount Faber (see Southern Stairway photo).

On this occasion, pressed for time, we took a taxi to Alexandra Road, and started our walk from the Arch. The Southern Ridges is a much easier walk than at Bukit Timah, and allows you to escape the forest floor to better vantage points above. Of course, “easier” is a relative term in Singapore’s heat and humidity; take a water bottle with you, and good walking shoes. You may discover a water fountain or two where you can slake your thirst and refill your bottle (see Water at Last photo), but there aren’t many of them.

You can take the “low road” walking along the jungle floor, or the “high road”, walking on elevated pedestrian bridges where you’ve a better chance of seeing the tropical birds making those jungle calls, and getting vistas of the city and the strait (see The High Road photo). At a few places, you actually do get quite close to “canopy level” but since this is all secondary forest, the canopy is nowhere near the height it attains in Sarawak or Sumatra (see Canopy Level photo; the only primary forest left in town is at Bukit Timah, and even that is a far cry from climax Malayan jungle). As the ground level rises and gets closer to you, you can look down at the jungle floor or across at stands of bamboo (see Jungle Floor and Bamboo photos). At the tops of Telog Blangah and Mount Faber, even on terra firma, you’re at some of the highest elevations in Singapore. There’s a splendid piazza on top of Telog Blangah, with an elegant stairwell taking you back down (see TB Piazza and TB Stairway photos). Henderson Waves is a treat in itself, provided you’ve got dozens of people crossing it (I’ve reviewed that separately).

Other than birds, however, you’re unlikely to spot any jungle animals. This could be considered a blessing. On Bukit Timah, the macaques can be aggressive pests (thanks in large part to humans who ignore placards not to feed them), and though I enjoy watching the monkeys, perhaps it’s just as well that the Southern Ridges have no macaques. Early in Singapore history, man-eating tigers were even more aggressive pests, coming down from the bukits at night: in the worst year, Singapore man-eaters took almost a human a night. Organized tiger-hunting eliminated that menace, forever. So, don’t expect to see monkeys, tigers, rogue elephants or salt-water crocs on the Southern Ridges. On the other hand, I can now say with 100% certainty that the Ridges do have at least one cobra.

Having crossed over the Henderson Waves, we were walking at ground level on Mount Faber. Ratchanok was a few meters in front of me. Nok is a country girl from Isaan (despite speaking four languages), with a great deal of jungle smarts, and she is extraordinarily observant, usually, most of the time. Yet suddenly I heard a blood-curdling scream and saw Nok doing a standing broad jump back towards me, a jump of Olympian proportions. If Thailand’s Olympics track and field coach had been up there with us, he’d have signed Nok up on the spot despite her age. Astonished, I momentarily saw a dark snake rapidly disappearing off the walking path and into the brush, as fast as its legs could go, so to speak. If snakes had Serpentine Olympics and Singapore’s Serp Olympics track and field coach had been there, he’d have signed up Johnny Cobra on the spot too.

Nok told me it was a nuhow-kii. She had been looking up and around as she walked, and didn’t see the nuhow-kii until she was about to step down on it. She didn’t know the English name of the snake, but knew that it was a “VERY bad” one. She emphasized that it was black all over, which is how you can tell that it’s a nuhow-kii. Later I showed her photos of several dangerous snakes that you might encounter in Singapore, and she immediately identified the nuhow-kii as a Malayan spitting cobra.

That made sense: unlike nocturnal king cobras, spitting cobras are diurnal, and are far more common in Singapore. When they feel threatened, spitting cobras might bite whatever is frightening them, injecting the venom; but instinctively they spit the venom at their threat’s eyes, and their aim is quite accurate. The venom causes intense pain and inflammation, and people instinctively frantically rub their eyes: a very, very bad idea. If you rub or scratch your eyes, the venom will cause worse damage. Instead, the eyes should be repeatedly and immediately washed out. If you’re promptly taken to Alexandra Hospital, just up the road from Alexandra Arch, odds are good that with copious irrigation, lubricants and topical antibiotics, you’ll have a substantial recovery within two days or so. (Yes, the hospital, at AYE and Alexandra, is named at least indirectly for the Danish Princess of Wales, and yes, it was the scene of the infamous massacre of patients and staff by the Japanese after their capture of Singapore; it’s now one of the best hospitals in SE Asia; they do treat patients who were hit in the eyes by spitting cobras, but such cases occur very, very rarely).

I distinctly remember seeing large snake warning signs at Bukit Timah; I don’t recall ever seeing any at Southern Ridges, but perhaps I just missed them. At Bukit Timah, the recommendation was that if you see a dangerous snake, you should immediately take four giant steps backward . If you’ve ever climbed up the steep main path at Bukit Timah, it’s obvious why trying to rapidly take four giant steps backward releases you from any snake dangers: you’d break your fool neck long before the snake could reach you. The placards also assure you that the snake will be more afraid of you, than you are of it. The spitting cobra Nok almost stepped on certainly felt threatened, and lost no time getting away, but I can’t imagine it was more terrified of Nok, than she was of it.

One other observation: I did not ask Nok at the time and I haven’t bothered to ask her since, but if you think about what the official placards at Bukit Timah said to do, and what she did, what she did made more sense. Instead of four giant steps backward, or even one; she immediately spun around and then jumped for her life, with her eyes facing away from the spitting cobra. Four giant steps backwards would keep your eyes open facing toward it, and your eyes are its target of choice. Hmmm. In any event, while snake incidents do occur in Singapore, foreign tourists are unlikely to be gardening, clearing brush, pulling out old drain pipes, deliberately trying to catch a snake, or doing other things that would increase their risk. If you’re walking down Bras Basah, shopping on Orchard Road, night-marketing in Chinatown, or even walking the Southern Ridges, your odds of being involved in a snake incident are very close to nil.

As for Ratchanok and me, we got up to the Mount Faber Station without further incident. Near the station, Nok discovered a Bell of Happiness. In Thailand, folks mainly ring bells in Buddhist temples, to bring good fortune or to avert evil. Nok had already had a giant dose of good fortune bestowed and evil averted, but she made an immediate bee-line to that Bell of Happiness and gave it a good dozen celebratory rings (see Bell of Happiness photo)! Somewhere back by Henderson Waves, if there was a serpentine version of such a bell, a Rattle of Happiness or something, our recent acquaintance the spitting cobra was probably ringing that one just as merrily, and thinking “blimey, that was a close call!”"
,,BEST walk in Singapore,5.0,,"Having already traversed the MacRitchie Reservoir, Botanic Gardens, Bukit Timah Hill, and Treetop walks, I was not expecting any different from the Southern Ridges from what I'd already experienced. I was wrong!

This walk/hike is stunning in its scenery, wholly varied at each point, and undulating. It can cater to those out for a lazy stroll, family outing, or fitness fanatics. Plenty of rest stops available and shelter from the elements. If you wish, stop for a spot of meditation. Trails are well spread out so one doesn't feel crowded out.

I recommend starting from Telok Blangah Hill Park, across the Henderson Waves, onwards to Mount Faber, and then back. A very comfortable 45-60min brisk walk ... IF you don't get distracted with photo-taking or a drinks at Faber Point!"
,,"A Really Fine, Scenic, well maintained walk!",5.0,,"This 10 KM, diverse, ""family friendly"" walk joins 3 Parks (Mount Faber, Kent Ridge and Telok Blangah Hill Parks) as well as 8 Trails/Walks and 2 ""Ecological Projects"". Bridges are used to join these component parts.. and some of the bridges provide a remarkable view from above the trees/jungle!! It is on the south side of the city. The various parks and trails etc, high light another side of Singapore- the majesty of ""Mother Nature's Treasures""-- one which is not seen nor appreciated by most visitors {and Locals too). If one wants to walk all/ much of the ""Southern Ridges"", it is best to start very early in the morning (as it is much cooler)-- and bring water-- or else focus on several sections on different days. It is so special, that TripAdvisor has awarded it the ""Certificate of Excellence"". Its well worth spending time on the ""Southern Ridges"".

I hope that this Review has been helpful."
,,Jungle in the city,4.0,,"This walk is amazing considering you are in a major city like Singapore. We did from Kent Bridge to The Henderson Wave bridge, which was around 2.4km. You can do smaller sections or walk further if you wish.
So Kent Bridge is where we started. We walked in from the university where we had lunch. The canopy walk was great and there was a view of the harbour area. Next is the hort. park, where you can view some great ideas for a home garden. The forest walk was very hot but we were glad we were walking on the elevated walkway and not the ground walk. Can I say the time we visited, Singapore was in a bit of a dry spell. In wetter times this would be a little more pleasant I feel.
Just before we did Henderson wave it did rain but we were able to take shelter in the park just before the bridge. We ended our walk just after the bridge as we had been on the Mt. Fabre cable car before. You can continue on past the cable car.
To get to the start we took the MRT to the university and then a bus back into central Singapore from Henderson wave. The park brochure says to start from Henderson Wave but this means you would have a hill climb at the end to get up to the Canopy walk."
,,Fantastic walk with spectacular views,4.0,,"Choose to start early morning, as it gets very hot. You can choose where to start depending how much time you will like to walk. I personally prefer to start in Alexandra road and finish at Vivocity. Love the walk through the forest, the birds, never encountered a snake and the fabulous views."
,,Easy and beautiful stroll through the forest,5.0,,"The Southern Ridges walk provides for an easy, family-friendly stroll on a well-maintained series of walkways through the lush forests of Singapore southern territory. Highlights include the Henderson Waves and Faber Point."
,,Walk in the jungle,5.0,,"Great chance to see some old greenery. An old mansion is moldering away, waiting for government rehab, but so evocative of days gone by."
,,Great walk,4.0,,The Southern Ridge is a walk area through the sky Bridge. We enjoyed the walk and historical place and fort which reminds of 2nd world war.
,,Full of greens,5.0,,"I had a great walk at Southern Ridges. You will hear the chirping of birds, the sound of crickets at the same time feel the strong winds. Besides you can see some tall buildings at the surrounding. I especially like the Hendersen waves. It is a beautiful structure and people like to take pictures here.
I would suggest to go there in the morning or evening. As it can be quite hot at noon."
,,Great walk,4.0,,"Plan to do this early in the morning as the heat can make it difficult for children and older walkers. Start on top of Mt. Faber and follow the signs, generally well marked but we did find the distance markings were not always correct. One toilet stop. Take plenty of water."
,,If you enjoy scenic strolls this is for you!,4.0,,"Mount Faber, Henderson wave and South ridge walk is great. Views over the city from many angles, tree top walk, bird spotting. Something for everyone. The architecture of Henderson wave bridge is very impressive and certainly worth the effort."
,,Incredible nature in Singapore!,5.0,,"My husband and I took the SMRT to the harbour front. It is the yellow line. We then boarded the blue bus no.100 to Hort Park on Alexandra Road. We then proceeded to do the canopy walk. You walk through a massive park called Telok Blangah Hill Park. This park connects to Mount Faber via the Henderson Waves, which is a very impressive bridge. Eventually you land up at the cable cars. You can opt to walk back down, which is very scenic or you can take the cable car down.
An absolutely stunning experience."
,,Nature trail with loads of selfie options !,5.0,,"Southern ridges walk is very different - you start at Mount Faber, cross Henderson waves, get down to forest walk and enter Hort Park and finally wind up at Kent Ridge ... you can take so many pics in 6 km walk. Excellent one and don’t miss it !!"
,,"A stroll through the forest, elevated.",5.0,,"I walked from Alexandra Arch to Henderson Waves with my 3-year old son, stopping periodically to take in the view of the forest, took us slightly more than an hour. Walking on such a long elevated walkway in and out of tree tops is quite an experience. You get a bird's eye view of the forest while the steel grating walkway allows for a see-through view of the trees down below.
The highlight for me was the section nearest to Telok Blangah Green Road, where the walkway zigzags upwards, it's stunning.

The walkway is very well maintained with clear directional signages."
,,It's so much fun and not to be missed.,5.0,,"By all means do this mini trekking trails. It’s a lovely place to spend the mornings or evenings. Lush green spread area partly connecting to roads and buildings but has quite a few short trails to spend time in. It has various beautiful ridges leading to a few more trails. If you aren’t doing McRitchie which is a longer hiking trail, you must certainly not miss southern ridges. There are also some spots to work-out. They do have water/drinks vending machines but do carry your bites for there is nothing that sells any eats. It’s worth the time and experience in Singapore."
,,"One of the rare ""free things to do"" in Singapore",5.0,,"We walked through the Southern Ridges, which makes you feel that you're on top of a jungle. It is an amazing feeling walking through this urban jungle. Given that this is a free activity, I do not see why you shouldn't try it out while in Singapore. You can continue walking through Henderson Waves and the distance covered should be within 3 KM. Be prepared to take plenty of water, sunblock and wear your comfortable clothes with proper shoes."
,,Interesting walk,5.0,,"We didn't do the whole walk, starrted south of Kent Ridge Park and walked towards the harbour (downhill!) It was fantastic to walk among the trees and amazing to feel so away from houses and cars in the middle of Singapore!"
,,Loved The Morning Walk - Feel The Serenity,5.0,,We loved the morning walk among the trees and nature. Our walk started at Hort Park and finished at Mount Faber with much beautiful scenery along the way. Highly recommended for an early morning activity before the heat and humidity kicks in.
,,Amazing jungle experience within skyscrapers,5.0,,"Like the Botanic Gardens, a free and extremely varied nature experience. Take plenty of water with you and blister protection, it is a strenuous hike, but well worth it. Start at the Harborfront Metro station, walk up the Marang Trail to Mt. Faber, ring the ""Bell of Happiness,"" continue on to the Henderson Waves, enjoy the great Forest Walk to the Alexander Arch, then the many varied gardens of Hort Park, and on to the Canopy Walk. That will take you about half way. Lots of good restrooms on the way."
,,Must to visit,5.0,,Visited this place a couple of times for a chill hike or an evening workout and was never disappointed. Its a good distance and is perfect for couples to family alike for a day out. Do check on the weather forecast as the trails might get muddy and the metal platform slippery.
,,No Excuses Not To Do!,5.0,,"We set out early and got a taxi to the far end of the Southern Ridges. Then walked the length back to the finish near Sentosa Island. Great fun. Mixture of rain forest, bridges, walkways and great views. Go early to avoid the heat. It took about 4 hours at a leisurely pace and we enjoyed a cold beer at the end. But if you do not fancy the whole walk you could just do a section. They have a decent website which gives some suggestions. So go & do it rather than walking around yet another Singapore shopping mall!"
,,Running from Harbourfront MRT to Kent Ridge Pond and return,4.0,,"First, the numbers from my Garmin GPS - the route I took from east to west from Harbourfront MRT to the western edge of the Southern Ridges at Kent Ridge pond and return was 15.5km and 480m total elevation gain.

One issue with this route was poor signage in some key decision points when on several occasions I arrived at a fork in the path or road and there was no signs advising to choose left or right to remain on the actual Southern Ridge trail. Luckily, I had offline Google maps on my smart phone and that had enough detailed mapping of trails to keep me on track.

The other thing to note is the signage itself only mentioned the name of upcoming attraction on the trail, so you'd need to know the order in your head if heading east to west which were Mount Faber -> Henderson Waves -> Telok Blangah Hill Park -> Alexandra Arch -> Hort Park -> Kent Ridge Park.

The entire trail surface was paved with either tarmac, cement, and grated aluminium in the raised walkway at Telok Blangah which was wet and quite slippery for running with my road joggers. There were excellent male/female public toilets and water taps at Mount Faber park and Hort Park. You could feasibly just do a one-way trip east to west as Kent Ridge MRT station is just 1km west of Kent Ridge pond at the western end of the Southern Ridges.

Overall, the scenery was very nice with elevated views to the water, and this is one of the very few places in Singapore to do a longish run without having to content with vehicle traffic."
,,Great Potential,3.0,,"This collection of paths and walkways has the potential to be one of Singapore's best walking tracks. It is of a good length, and covers some spectacular scenery, and structures. It's biggest failing is overall signage and distance markers. I find it amazing that Singapore has built such wonderful structures as the Waves, and the Forest Walk, but has neglected to guide visitors adequately from one path to the next."
,,Dizzying heights,5.0,,"If you had a fear of high places, you ordinarily would not walk on bridges this high off the ground. However, being within or above the tree canopy does not make it seem as scary. This is a super impressive urban walking park."
,,Let's walk Singapore,4.0,,"Who loves to walk has plenty opportunities in Singapore but The Soutern Ridges are certainly one of the nicest.
The variety of the different parts, from rainforest, the Henderson Waves to the sophisticated gardenlike Hortpark makes it very plaisant. to make the full distance. And if you like something more cultural you can pass-by the galleries in Gilman Barracks"
,,Nice easy walk,4.0,,"The walk is nice and very manageable but gets you close to nature. Definitely worth a trip. The structure is well constructed and well maintained. The planks that you walk on have holes that let you see down to the tree tops but feels secure and safe. If you are looking to work up a sweat, start your walk a little further, from the Henderson Waves and end the journey in Hortpark."
,,Running the South Ridges,4.0,,"Getting to the start was easy, I got the MRT to the harbour front. Leave the station through exit D, turn right and marang road is right there. I'm pretty fit but found the run tough. Most of the run is actually steps which are slippy in running shoes and the combination of exertion and heat are pretty harsh. Although I enjoyed the run I do have a gripe, the signage is ambiguous and very easy to miss if you are travelling at speed. You also won't see a sign saying southern ridges; you have to know the order of the landmarks and the last bit is just signed 'pond. I also got pretty annoyed around hort park. My advice to runners is; if you are in town do it, treat it as an interval session, take plenty of water and prepare for the labyrinth of paths. Oh and finally the route I did - harbourfront to ridge park is 6km not 6 miles."
,,Walkercise along the Southern Ridges,5.0,,"I organize brisk walks around nature areas in singapore. These tend to be fitness oriented as the tagline of my initative is ""Connecting People with Nature through Fitness Walks"". Please look up WalkerciseSingapore on Facebook."
,,A lovely walk,5.0,,This walk is well signposted (so you shouldn't get lost) and varied. We had done it on a previous trip to Singapore but decided to do it again on this trip. We did it on our own as we through it would be rather long for our grandchildren (who are 6). Make sure you take water with you and don't forget your camera. You don't have to do the whole thing but there are sections that once started you need to complete (or turn around).
,,City to Jungle in a few Steps,5.0,,Right off the MRT and into a tropical jungle. Then back to the mall at the top. Great walk you feel like you are in the jungle without having to leave the city too far behind. The sounds are incredible with life exploding around you. I didn't see any wildlife but it is always a possibility.
,,Worth to visit,4.0,,"My daughter, who was a exhange student on Singapore, took me to walk here. It was a lovely experience above the trees. Nice views and silence. Out of the city traffic. After the walk we took the cable car to Sentosa. Remember to take a lot of water to drink with you! There is no shops in every corner!"
,,Downtown to Kent Ridge and back,5.0,,"Started by taking the SMRT to Downtown, the start of the Marang Trail is right by the station exit. It was a bit of a climb to begin with so take it at your own pace. Eventually made our way to the top of the cable car station where you can have a comfort break. Then onto Henderson Waves which was quite spectacular. There are plenty of place so take it easy. Then made our way to the Forest Walk which was amazing. Walking up in the trees, maybe not so good if you do not have a head for heights. Saw a number of brightly coloured birds and heard monkeys although did not see any. Then walked onto Hort Park and Kent Ridge. Unfortunately after the Forest Walk everything seemed rather tame so probably should have stopped at Hort Park. If coming from Kent Ridge thing just keep getting better.

Remember to take plenty of water with you as it can be rather hot."
,,Delightful walk,5.0,,We walked from Kent RIdge Park to My Fabor and down to the MRT station. A delightful walk with plenty to see including Hort Park and Henderson Waves. Pleasant cafe at top of cable car station. We found the online park authority map helpful for planning. Once on the trail signposting is good.
,,Pleasant walk for a couple of hours,5.0,,"We walked from Pasir Panjang metro station to Mount Faber Park and then down to Harbour Front metro station. It is a very pleasant stroll through Kent Ridge Park, Hort Park, Southern Ridges and Mount Faber Park. It took probably took around 2 hours. The nicest part is the raised platform around the Southern Ridges and of course the Henderson Waves. It is fairly up and down. It is not all in the middle of the forest - don't expect it to be all like the Henderson Waves with views on Singapore - but it is very pleasant. There are some toilets at Hort Park. You can get also get water there.

We declined to take the cable car down at the end. It is simply too expensive. Instead, we walked down. it took about 20 minutes to get to the Vivo shopping centre / Harbour Front metro station."
,,Pleasant evening stroll,5.0,,"Come at the evening: less/no people, cooler, the scenery is beautiful. Makes an excellent evening walk."
,,Get your exercise with great views,5.0,,Walking thru the tree tops is very relaxing and listening to the birds. It is a great activity to see another side to Singapore. A hat is recommended as during the day can get quiet hot
,,Good jogging place,4.0,,"You want to walk, to jog it is a beautiful place to go and even if you don't do the 9KM at least you will enjoy part of it."
,,Great walk to escape the city.,4.0,,"What a fantastic way to escape the hustle and bustle of Singapore for a few hours. The only difficulty was finding a location to start. We walked about 7 km of it in 2-3 hours leisurely. We started at Kent ridge Park and followed the signs all the way to Faber Point. We walked along lovely paths , a canopy walk, a lovely long raised walkway, through Hort Park and saw the sunset at Henderson Waves. We finished at Faber point which also has lovely views. You can then get the cable Car down to Harbourfront. Sadly the cable car was shut for maintenance so we got the free shuttle back to the MRT. Take plenty of water & snacks! Fabulous afternoon!‍♀️‍♂️"
,,Partial walk,5.0,,"It was hot and steamy in the middle of the day, we should have started earlier!! We bought the round trip on the cable cars. It was a good deal to buy both rote’s and even better price wise to buy through the Klook site. We started at Harbourfront and went up to Mount Faber where we alighted. We walked to the Henderson Bridge and onto the forest walk. Then returned to Mount Faber to continue our journey to Sentosa. It was the middle of the day and rather hot in the cars. The views were magnificent!"
,,Great walk if you can bare the heat.,4.0,,"I started the walk all the way back at Kent Ridge Park after reading an online review saying to get off at Kent Ridge station and start there. I would definitely recommend however going to Labrador station and walking up from there because Kent Park wasn't easy to find and negotiate my way through due to parts being closed off.

The walk through HortPark with the SG 50 Community art garden instillations was a cool surprise find. The proper Southern Ridge walk starting just after there is a good walk. I walked right until the end at Vivocity where the Harbour Town MRT station and this took me about three hours with a few stops included. Needless to say with the weather take plenty of water but really enjoyable."
,,A different view of Singapore,5.0,,"Came here for walk-exercise and to enjoy the view. Drop by first to Hort Park with its beautiful gardens and wide spread of plants with many flowering. We access here via the circle line train and walking from the Labrador Park station. Using the metal bridge from the entrance of Hort Park car park, it was a cool 3km walk to Vivo city where we had our dinner at the Seah Im Food centre. Very pleasant walk with great views of the Pasir Panjang wharf area as well as the city area.As we reach the Henderson Waves bridge around 7pm, we were rewarded with a view of lights of the city. We past by the Mt Faber cable car station with its fine dining restaurants and using the Marang track to reach Vivo city. The Marang track is concrete, however, it is not lighted up, so we use our mobile phones light to shown on the steps. it is just a 5-10 mins walk down so no issue with us. A great and rewarding walk."
,,"Lovely walk, just be aware of heat.",4.0,,"We chickened out because of the humidity and only walked from Alexandra Arch bridge.It was warm, but the walk is rewarded with nice views, and squirrels bouncing around. We ended up back at VivoCity, which helped cool us down. Still, very worthwhile."
,,Favorite Place,5.0,,this is one of my favourite places in Singapore to chill out and think about life. The view and the ambience are very relaxing.
,,Pleasantly surprised,4.0,,"We caught the bus here after visiting the botanic gardens. We were pleasantly surprised to find a walk in the tree tops that goes all the way to the Harbourfront. We ended up walking to Mt Faber and catching the cable car over to Sentosa Island. At Mt Faber park, you can get a nice view of Singapore. A different perspective than the usual view from MBS. Wear appropriate footwear and clothing for an urban hike and have water handy too. A nice half day to get away from lots of tourists and take in some different sights."
,,Satisfied!,4.0,,"Had a satisfying hike here with friends, and it was definitely something to remember. We took the tougher route up, with all the steps and it definitely worked our muscles. Don't regret it and even went a few more times after that trying the different routes."
,,Walk through (not below) the rainforedt,4.0,,"Most of the path between Alexandra Rd (Hort Park) and Henderson Wave Bridge (Mt Baker) is either closed road or a newly built elevated metal structure allowing you to walk or jog through - and not below - the rainforest. Relaxing, safe and definitely a break from busy downtown."
,,"Nice walk, away from the madding crowds",5.0,,"High in the treetops, away from the hustle and bustle. Go if you're sick of people especially in the midday. Not much cover so bring an umbrella."
,,good walkway for leisure walk or walking/jogging,5.0,,"One of favourite walking routes by myself/ withh family & friends. Well designed, easy (to medium) level for leisure visitors/ people who wants to walk/jog all the way to Harbour front/ vivocity (and put back all calories burnt by the many F&B offerings there). Suitable for visitors or all ages."
,,Walk-cable car-Palawan Beach,5.0,,"We live locally. We get a cab to drop us on Preston Road (just look for the Forest Walk steel walkway). We walk in the direction of Faber Peak which takes us from Forest Walk to Henderson Waves then on to Faber Peak (where the cable car can take you to harbourfront and onto Sentosa).

The walk is 2kms and takes an hour with kids 5-8 years old including stops. Much of it is shaded. You’re slowly climbing most of the walk. We first stop for a short break at the outdoor gym area where there are toilets and a water fountain. We then stop for morning tea on the Henderson Waves and will spend up to 20 minutes looking at the view and relaxing on the covered seating.

When to walk: it’s Singapore and it’s hot, so the earlier the better. The cable car opens at 8:45am and Palawan Pirate ship at 10am. We time our walk and breaks with those things in mind.

Tips: If you’ve got kids with easily tired legs and it’s dry, then it’s possible to take a scooter. The steel track of forest walk worked okay for the micro style scooter. I can’t recall ever seeing a push chair, but the route we take is pushchair friendly.

Enjoy!"
,,Go to the Southern Ridges. It's beautiful and the views are great.,5.0,,"If you can, get up there without taking the short steep route up. We went by cable car and spent about 2 hours at the top walking slowly."
,,Best trail in Singapore. Often not noticed,5.0,,"It is the most lovely trail in Singapore. Goes through multiple terrains, and it was one of the best experiences I had in Singapore. It takes some time, but worth it."
,,Where we take all our visitors,5.0,,"Yeah, as the title says: this is where we bring all our family and friends when they come visit us in Singapore. It's such a nice break from the bustling city that you almost forget that you are still in the middle of it all.

We usually start by the Alexandra Arch Bridge and take the 4km walk from there through the forest and onto the Henderson Waves, finishing off on the summit of Mount Faber for a panoramic view over the city."
,,"Great walk, be ready to sweat a bit.",5.0,,"We did this walk in August 2018, the weather was great but a little hazy on the day. The start of the walk has changed a little if you start from Harbour Front MRT. You need to walk up Temenggong Rd, not sure how long the work will go on for but for now this is the way up if you are walking. We did the entire walk through to Kent Ridge Park and I can say it is well worth the effort. You end up walking out onto Science Park Dr. Follow this towards South Buona Vista Road and you will see the MRT station right there. There are toilets and places to buy water along the way and a nice place to stop at Hort Park. I would also recommend an early start as you will avoid the tourist coming up by bus at Mount Faber. Also when you see the sign of the Terrace Garden, it might not look like much from the entrance but it is well worth the view when you go up."
,,Half the walk,5.0,,We decided it was too hot to do the whole walk from mount danger to holt park. So we got a taxi to mount Fabre park and walked along the canopy walk then doubled back and walked across Henderson waves and onto mount Fabre peak to get the cable car over to Sentosa Island. Take water it is hot.
,,Weekend walking,4.0,,"I returned to the Southern Ridges on the weekend for a hike from Kent Ridge Park via Hort Park, Telok Blangah Hill Park and Mt Faber Park to Harbourfront. Very hot in the afternoon, but at least there weren't too many people. Nice walk through the jungle and on the canopy above it. Definitely worth doing."
,,Great walk for kids,5.0,,"Lovely walk to do especially with young children- totally pram friendly. Good to start at Hort Park and finish at Vivocity for lunch, or get the cable car from Mount Faber to Sentosa if you want to make a day of it"
,,Great nature walk in the heart of Singapore,4.0,,"If you drown out the noises, you almost feel like you’re in a forest. Trails were neat and tidy. My only complaint is that all of the vending machines were empty when I went and by the end of the trail I was so thirsty. Lesson learned: bring something along. :-)"
,,Great Morning Walk,3.0,,Morning walk started from Marang Trail > Mount Faber > Telok Blangah Hill > Hort Park. Total: 8.25km (2hr) Bring snacks & water. Top up of potable water available along the trail. (near washroom)
,,Singapore Southern Ridges,4.0,,Lovely trail of treetop walk... You will encounter some beautiful birds. Wonderful for a brisk walk exercise.
,,Fantastic morning walk!,5.0,,"We headed there in the morning before the big heat hits. We did the whole trail from Marang Road all the way to Kent Ridge Park in under two hours while still taking breaks to enjoy the view and parks along the way.

And a quick warning about mosquitoes: there were a few in the sahdes and cooler areas, so repellent application is needed for mosquito magnets like myself!

Also, beware that there are no buses on Sundays in the Science Park area. We had to extend our walk a bit to reach the Kent Ridge station."
,,Worth the effort to find it!,5.0,,"Although the pin of the TripAdvisor link didn’t work for me, when I did find it after a longer walk than anticipated, it was worth the effort to have a beautiful view and nice relaxing walk on a Sunday afternoon over the lovely parks. You can just walk a bit or continue through the joining parks.
Was the highlight of my business trip taking this time out.
Suggestion - check the location!"
,,A little break most tourists miss,4.0,,"This is a very well maintained park area that has great walkways, and is a fab break from the city - no tourists go here and it is very calm - there are no supertrees here but no tourist traps either - a great little break."
,,Best short walk in Singapore,5.0,,If you have only a short walk with visitors then do this. it shows how the urban environment is linked with the natural for Singapore in some spots. Easy to access and great views of booth the harbour and back into Singapore's horticulture section
,,Great Walk,5.0,,This was part of our afternoon walking around Mt Faber. Not one for heights I felt really safe and stable up here. Peaceful not too many people around just us nature. Worth going here for a look
,,great walk,4.0,,"please be aware that the Marang trail on the side of the car park near the food centre is closed temporarily until Aug 2018. use alternate route near the bus stop of mount faber park. we walked up til the cable car station and onto forest walk/henderson waves.. we spotted the southern ridges bridge, walked part of the way and decided to use the ""earth"" trail. i was hesitant due to monkeys but we didn't see one - only saw 2 squirrels. after some time saw some barracks and walked up the steps back on the bridge onto hort park. a great alternative if you're sick of window shopping !!"
,,Great fun,4.0,,"Things you need to know:
* this is definitely worthwhile doing; it is well laid out and you can opt in and out at different points along the 10km trail. We did the walk from Marang to Hort Park in about 75 mins.
* direction matters - definitely start at Harbourfont MRT (Marang Trail) and walk towards Hort Park. After the initial climb to Mount Faber it is pretty much all downhill to Hort Park. We were thankful we did our research and did not do it in reverse; it would have been meant walking uphill pretty much the whole way with a steep decent back to teh MRT at Harbourside. Downside is that you end up a long way from food options but this was a small price to pay..
* Marang Tail is closed until mid-August so there is a detour which is a bit longer but not too bad - the climb to Mount Faber is quite steep so you need to be fit and healthy. Our ten-year old twins managed easily (although they did complain a lot)
* Exit the MRT at Exit D and look for Marang Road - it is signposted from there
* Take sunscreen and lots of water; there are drinking fountains you can fill up along the way but you need to keep hydrating as you will sweat a lot in the humidity. Avoid the trail in the case of rain.
* Henderson Waves is good and provides a good place to rest about half way
* It is worth starting earlier due to the heat and humidity but most of the walk is shaded so you are not ever in the direct sun for very long"
,,A great way to spend the day,5.0,,"I was apprehensive at first because it felt like getting to Southern Ridges was going to be tough but boy was I wrong. Cheapest and best way to get there is to buy a train/bus card that will set you back SG $12, with $7 in fare and $5 for the card deposit. Top up with an extra $10- $15 and you'll have plenty for a weekend visiting the main sights along the MRT line.

Okay, so get yourself to Harbourfront MRT on the NorthEast line (easier to navigate public transport here than the Tube in London, lots of signs everywhere). From there, do the whole kahuna: around 10km of the trail that is very easy to follow. The highlight for me was the amazing Henderson Waves and, if you're into gardens, you'll enjoy Hort Park.

There's always groups of family and friends on the trail so it's perfectly safe for solo runners (just be sensible at all times, of course and be aware of your surroundings).

At least a handful of car parks along the trail so you can start your run as you want and there's a cafe near the Gardens, complete with public restrooms and a water cooler if you want to take a pit stop.

What they don't tell you in the brochure though is that the Marina Trail is closed for construction. There's still a way in but there's the alternate route just a couple.of hundred metres that also gets you to Faber Peak.

A slow walk will set you back 4 hours or so. Best to start around 9am if you can.

Bring your sunnies, towelette, a bottle of water, an energy bar/snack and an umbrella/raincoat (it's the tropics, hot and humid with showers (brief) expected.

I only had a weekend to spend here but as a nature lover, I'm glad I did this trail as well as MacRitchie (and at night, Gardens by the Bay).

Enjoy!

P.s. I did spot a monkey but don't expect them to socialise!"
,,Amazing walk above the trees,5.0,,"I personally like to walk from the Alexandra bridges to the Harbourfront MRT station, which took us about 45 minutes to an hour. The bridge will bring you to a higher place and I think its good for runners or people looking for a place to exercise. Air is fresh during the morning time and it'll be good to prepare some bread along in case you are hungry as you do the walking :)"
,,Surprising trails in the city with interesting bridges,5.0,,The trails run about 10K between Mount Faber toward the West and are connected by some interesting pedestrian bridges. Well worth a walk or a nice long run.
,,A lovely walk with scenic views - a Singapore gem!,4.0,,"My family has done sections of the walk over the last few years, but we finally did the entire trail this month and took us under two and a half hours at a leisurely but steady pace. Parts of the walk are shaded (Kent Ridge Park, Canopy Walk) and other parts are exposed (Hort Park). We started off near Science Park Drive and were immediately immersed into the woods, whilst the busy AYE expressway was not far behind us! There are steps to climb, so not all of the walk is wheelchair or stroller accessible (Hort Park is). It afforded lovely views of the ports and city skyline peeping in between the trees. A favourite is the Canopy Walk along the tree line and Henderson Waves, a beautiful bridge linking Telok Blangah Hill Park and Mt Faber Park with lovely views and places to sit and admire them. There are toilets and water coolers dispersed throughout the walk. The last bit walking down from Mt Faber to Marang Road is now pedestrianised but has many steps down. Harbourfront MRT station is conveniently situated at the foot. Not a walk to be done in wet weather. Wear a hat, sun glasses and sunblock and bring a water bottle along."
,,Supersize!,5.0,,"We were just walking having no idea that this ""tree top walk"" was even there. But it was a delight to go up and see the view and enjoy the higher elevation through the trees. We came by accident. You should plan to make sure this is part of your experience."
,,Enjoyable walk in the City,4.0,,"The Southern Ridges ia a 9km trail that connects Mount Faber Park, Telok Blangah Hill Park, Hortpark and Kent Ridge Park along the southern ridge of Singapore. We parked our car at Seah Im Carpark near to the Harbour Front MRT Station. The trail head is near to Exit D of this MRT Station and is called Marang trail, it is 800m long and leads to cable car station (Faber Peak) on Mount Faber. From here, we can have a clear view of the cable cars and the southern part of Singapore. After Mararng trail is the 1km long Faber trail in Mount Faber Park, and this trail ends at the beautiful Henderson Waves Bridge. The bridge deck is covered completely with wooden planks and is beutiful for photograhing. After this bridge is the 1km long Hilltop Walk trail which runs through Telok Blangah Hill Park. Afther Hilltop Walk trail, we go on to the 1.3km long Forest Walk walkway that cuts through the secondary forest in Telok Blangah Park. This walkway is completely on elevated steel structure and it ends at Alexandra Arch Bridge. Situated beside the bridge is Hortpark. It has a 300m trail named Floral Walk which offers a stroll along a path lined with flowering plants. Hortpark has 21 theme gardens. It also serves as park connector to kent Ridge Park. After entering Kent Ridge Park, we see Reflections at Bukit Chandu, once known as Opium Hill and site of one of the last battles of Singapore in Worls War II. We continue on a 300m long Canopy walk. The trail leads all the way to Kent Ridge Pond. The trail ends at Sceince Park and we walk to the nearby Kent Ridge MRT station to take the train back to Harbour Front Station. We can see many flowers along the trail. We also saw kingfishers, squirrels and hornbills. This is a nice stroll in the city."
,,Wonderfully cool retreat in HOT Singapore!,4.0,,This is an amazing walk on the edge of the cliffs through the jungle vegetation. The area where we started was quite steep with many stairs but once we reached the top of Mt Fabar it leveled off. There are view sites which give you wonderful views of the city and Sentosa. The construction of the path which takes you at tree top level is amazing! It was lovely and cool in the shade - highly recommended
,,For the fit and active,4.0,,"A stunning walk through adjacent parks of contrast. Approx 10km in total and a lot of steps so be prepared.
Great vistas from many viewing platforms.
Enjoyed the bridges and elevated walkways through the tropical vegetation. Some very clever structural engineering.
Good to see this managed green space in the middle of such a densely populated metropolis."
,,Great walk,5.0,,Loved the walk. Not many water fountains so water with you. Great way to get away from the bustle of Singapore for a bit.
,,nice view,5.0,,"though I didn't see much as I was jogging thru from telok blangah park to Kent ridge park...did see more on the way back as was tired then lol

the stretch is 1 to 2km long, unsheltered...some of the metal tracks a bit misaligned, guess due to too many joggers!!! but still very very safe...nice links between the parks in the area"
,,Singapores best kept secret,5.0,,Start at Faber Peak and follow the signs to Henderson Wave. Great views of the city as you walk through lush tropical forest. Henderson wave is a piece of architectural brilliance. Continue on to the treetop walk which is a really nice stroll down to hort park. Allow a few hours for the whole trip and pack your own food/water as there are limited opportunities to buy from start to finish.Not much around Hort Park so you'll have to cab it back to wherever you came from. You can do this in reverse but you'll be mainly walking uphill.
,,A walk to remember,4.0,,If you are in Singapore for a longer time. Do make this a part of your itinerary to view the beautiful island from a height with a good nature walk. Start at the Hort park and take a leisurely walk on a morning or even evening and enjoy the Flora and Fauna of Singapore.
,,Lots to see!,5.0,,"Great walk which takes in a number of interesting sights. We started from Harbourfront MRT, and once you have completed the initial climb up to Mt Faber, its generally down hill through Henderson Waves, Forest Walk, Hort Park and finally Kent Ridge Park. Lots of different things to see while getting some exercise. Also some great views throughout.
It took us around 2 hours to complete."
,,Lovely walk in the jungle,4.0,,This walk on bridges in the jungle is quite pleasant. It offers views on the city. The walk is short enough but go in the morning as it gets hot in the afternoon.
,,A great days walking,5.0,,"We caught the MRT to Labrador Park and then a bus to Gillian Barracks to walk around Holt Park and canopy walk before following the elevated walkways though parks and forests of Telok Blangah Hill onto the remarkable Henderson Waves walkway suspended 36m above the forest floor , finally passing the cable car to Sentosa Island before walking to Harbourfront MRT . Allow 4 hours to take your time and enjoy the natural beauty of this walk , take your camera . All walkways and parks are free ."
,,A great walk - take plenty of water,5.0,,"We enjoyed our walk through the Southern Ridges. We started at the Mount Faber end - and did find it difficult to find the start of the walk as many of the locals didn't seem to know what it was - but with persistence found our way. It was a very hot and humid day (typical Singapore) so be sure to take plenty of water with you. There are lots of places to stop and sit and rest if needed, and various points along the way where you can ""exit"" if you don't want to carry on. The trek up Mount Faber was tough and I'd only recommend this part of the walk for those in good health and fitness."
,,Do this walk.,5.0,,"We started from harbourfront mrt. Turn left out of the station and head toward the park.
Yes, as the other reviews have said there are steps here, but they are graduated and with a reasonable level of fitness you will be ok. Your alternative would be to catch the cable car to the top of mt Faber and walk from there.

I don't think i could have worked out where to find the start from the other end at Kent ridge. Anyway when you walk from Harbourfront the canopy walk is downhill.

There are lots of signs to help you find your way. You won't get lost.
We passed-
Mt faber-great views over the city and sentosa.
Henderson waves bridge- a wonderful feat of architecture.
Hort park- very pretty, and has a playground for children
Canopy walk and forest walk- there are elevated tree top walkways with great views of the gardens and city.
We finished at Kent ridge park. As we were taking transport we walked through past the pond then out to the road, we caught the bus to Kent ridge mrt. The whole thing took us a few hours with lots of rests. Most of it is very shady. Plenty of toilets and vending machines to buy drinks (need small dollar notes or coins).
We saw birds and squirrels. No monkeys, thank goodness after a previous traumatic experience elsewhere. All I can say is definetly heed the warning signs about the monkeys!
This has been my favourite thing to do here in Singapore.
Tip- when you get to Kent ridge mrt don't miss the food court there!"
,,Beautiful country and jungle walk in the city!,4.0,,"Variety of entry points to the walk means you can tailor your distance to time and ability. We started at Bukit Chandu and turned around at Henderson Bridge, a round trip of about 8 Km. Walk takes you through the Hort Park gardens across the Alexander arch bridge, through the “jungle” on the ridge behind depot road, passed Alkaf Mansion etc. Ever changing vista and convenient facilities at regular intervals allowed for water breaks etc. Walk is generally “easy”, those using mobility devices may find the grating used in the raised “jungle” walk somewhat difficult to manoeuvre over."
,,Fine walk,5.0,,"We took bus 57 to Depot rd/Alexander rd. Walk back to Alexander rd. From there you can follow a path all down to the harbour MTR station. On the way you will find a vending machine and clean toilets. All Singapore style, clean and efficient. Beautiful walk, nice views."
,,"Impressive views, lots of greenery, free...!",5.0,,"We started by getting off the MRT at Harbourfront/VivoCity and ended near Hort Park.

To start with we walked up a lot of steps up to the cable cars (most people seemed to take a bus or car) and there found a ""bell of happiness"". The rainbow steps leading down from it made a great photo!

We didn't find the view spot very exciting at Mount Faber, it wasn't anything special and was full of (other) tourists. The signage to Henderson Waves felt quite inefficient too (oddly) and we got lost which was hard work in the heat... however we found the waves in the end and then did the Canopy Walk in the greenery and the Elevated Walkway, both really lovely - quite relaxing - and thankfully the heat had subsided. Would be great for fitness enthusiasts it had an outdoor fitness trail."
,,A long walk with stunning view,5.0,,"I started my walk from Hyderabad road. This was one of my favorite place in Singapore. It took me 30 minutes to reach Handerson Waves and i was pampered with stunning view of the trees and the city. It's a contrast view but really breathtaking.

I think it is better to visit this place in the morning or during sunset time. Will definitely come back!"
,,Good,4.0,,A bit walk to the bridge but good scenery from it. Good view. We would have enjoyed more if we haven't seen a couple in Australia already.
,,"Exercise, stunning views",5.0,,"This is a good activity linking a visit to Bukit Chandu to a visit of Mt Faber. Start in Kent Ridge (recently up-graded), meander along dramatically elevated Alexander Bridge, let your eyes pop out at the beauty & originality of the Henderson Waves, and then wander around Mt Faber: Danish Seamen's Church (where Dr Sun YS stayed), the Merlion on Merlion Point, the Bell of Happiness, etc.
Tips: 1) Don't bring anything in a plastic bag because the macaques think you have food & will make intimidating faces / gestures at you (they didn't actually threaten me, so don't worry too much! Just be vigilant), 2) Bring your full water bottle. 3) Wear a hat & / or use sun block cream. 4) It's nice and breezy so you don't need bug repellent. 5) Henderson Waves is the real draw card, but it isn't very long; walk the length of the Waves checking out photographic angles, then go back & get your photos... then go back again; just because it's so beautiful & amazing!!!"
,,Leisure early morning walks!,5.0,,"Staying on depot road, less than 100m away from this trail - it has always been a great pleasure taking this trail time and again! Always feel refreshed with an early morning walks more so at this stretch from Hort Park to mount faber and return, as it stretches through lot of greenery and one could breathe nature in true sense instead of poisonous gases we are forced to inhale in a busy city life! Well maintained but still looks natural...have come across snakes quiet a bit but no monkeys yet though you will warning signs across the trail. Those walking their kids, just be aware once in a while you do tend to find folks who misuse and ride their bicycles at full speed at this stretch which they are not supposed to..have seen more so on sundays or public holidays! Singapore with all its gardens and parks should be called worlds garden city. The view of interlace condo from top of the trail always makes for a great sight!"
,,Lovely walk,4.0,,"We got the MRT to Kent ridge and started our walk there to Mount Faber. The beginning of the trails were quite poorly signposted and difficult to follow, but as soon as we got to Alexandra arch, the route was self explanatory and very well maintained. Lovely walk on different terrains, and we did the cable car at Mount Faber at the end!"
,,"25,000 steps later...",4.0,,"We walked from Harbour Front MRT to the Horticultural park and back so took in the Marang Trail, the canopy walk, Henderson wave, Mount Faber and Kent ridge park. Nice walk, though hard going in the heat and humidity. Started to rain which at first was lovely as it cooled us down but it then came down very fast so we had to take shelter for about 45 mins. There are a couple of toilet stops along the way and toilets at the Horticultural park at the very end. Wear bug spray as I got bitten straight away. We went early in the morning to beat the crowds, it didnt work it was quite busy. We didnt see any monkeys (not even sure they exist!) but we did see a couple of stripey squirrels and some birds."
,,Nice long bridge above the trees,5.0,,This is an excellent place for talking a walk above the trees and admire what nature has to offer. Best to come either in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat.
,,Lovely!,5.0,,"We hiked this on our last day, and at the end took the cable car across to Sentosa. So beautiful and so very clean!!!"
,,"Hot & Exhausting, but very nice",4.0,,"We walked the trail on our day of arrival, to fight off the jetlag, and must say that it was very well worth it. Sure it was hot and it is quite a long walk, but the Southern Ridges offer nice views of the city and the surrounding parks and forests. Finish the walk by taking the cable car to Sentosa."
,,Great views,4.0,,"Take water, its a long hot walk but enjoyable. Not difficult. Be sure to walk Henderson Waves on way to Mount Faber."
,,Tree top walk,5.0,,"An amazing tree top walk in the forest. We started with Henderson Waves and continued with Forest Walk which then became the Tree Top Walk. Such an amazing experience. You have a wonderful view, you hear the birds singing, every color of green and modern human touch. It started to rain after a while but that didn’t stop as we had umbrellas. We finished at the Alexandra road. Definitely worth it. It is free."
,,Great views,4.0,,"We visited Mt Faber this morning. Initially we were going to walk up from the MRT but as it was already so hot and humid decided to catch the Cable Car. We had wanted to walk down but unfortunately you have to buy amreturn ticket, no singles. Whilst up at Mt Faber we walked the Henderson Wave and some of the Southern Ridges. A great experience and hard to believe you are so close to Downtown Singapore"
,,Wonderful walk with family,5.0,,"Great experience, we started from Vivo City (after visiting Sentosa), took my family around 35 mintues to get to Henderson Wave. Many amazing views of the city. When you get to Henderson Wave, there are vending machine to get some refreshing drinks."
,,Best in the early mornings,5.0,,"I live pretty far from the southern ridges, so I tend to have to wake up early if I want to go - that being said going before 10am is best, as it's not so hot then and you'll be able to wander around more comfortably.
I highly recommend dressing appropriately if you want to go, especially with regards to footwear as the bridge itself is like a metal grille and friendlier towards shoes like flats or sneakers. Bring water with you too, as it's a nice long walk with water points placed along the ends of the trails."
,,One of our best days out in Singapore,5.0,,"You must do this. The views are superb and the walk over Henderson waves and into the forest canopy walk is amazing; made so by the city skyline in the background whilst being in middle of forest at same time.

It’s not too onerous. We did exit from HarbourFront MRT to Mount Faber (exit D if memory serves) then straight out onto walk. A 10 min walk up steps is rewarded by excellent view.

Continue well signposted route. We stopped off at cable car on Mount Faber for an ice cream before continuing to top then heading to Henderson waves then followed path to forest walk. We exited at Alexandra bridge and walked 10 mins to Labrador park. Whole walk took around 2 hrs stopping lots to take pics and admire the view!

Highly recommend doing this if you have time in Singapore. One on our highlights."
,,À wonderful walk - must see the Henderson Wave,5.0,,One must experience this fabulous walk way which has many access & exits and presents a great variety of vegetation & many view points of Singapore. Great pause from the city within it.
,,"Amazing walk, you cannot believe you are still in Singapore",4.0,,"Allow 2/3 hours for this activity, you can walk from Alexandra bridge to Henderson waves. The earlier the better, such in all open air activities in Singapore. The sequence of ridges is amazing. The views to the see are fine but do not expect fantastic view to the city. We did not walk at night, it should be very nice too because the lights."
,,Looking for something different to do in Singapore that costs nothing?,4.0,,"Very well set out walk/hike from Harbourfront MRT to Alexandra Park MRT (half way mark) via Mount Faber.
The path starts immediately outside one of the MRT exits at Harbourfront MRT station.
The path climbs up to Mount Faber using a series of steps. Once you have reached the top you walk past the cable station and onto ""Henderson Waves"" which is a long footbridge in a wave design that crosses a motor way. Then you continue onto a long section of steel walkways above the bush canopy. Once we reached Alexandra Road, we left the path and walked downhill along Alexandra Road for approx 900 meters to the Alexandra Park MRT station.
The entire walk should take about 90 minutes but can be done quicker or longer depending on how often you stop to rest. A lot of the journey is shaded. I suggest you carry water for the walk. This is a different Singapore experience away from the hustle and bustle of the city."
,,A walk through nature,5.0,,We walked up Mount Faber which wasn't too bad even in all the heat and humidity. Lovely natural scenery and noises. A nice change from the busy city. Crossed Henderson bridge which is so high over the road! At the end of our walk we went to IKEA for meatballs!!
,,Wonderful walk through the natural beauty of Singapore,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our walk along The Southern Ridges. We started in Mount Faber Park and took our time on the initial climb (in the heat and humidity) to Faber Peak - you really see a different side of Singapore although the city is never far away and can be glimpsed through the trees. There is not so much uphill walking after Faber Peak and there are view points and seats here and there along the way for you to have a rest if you need to. This trail is well worth doing - it has been well thought out, and built to a high standard and there is plenty to see all along the route - we really liked the design of The Henderson Waves Bridge - and it isn't busy so is quiet and peaceful. We walked the full route from Harbour Front/Mount Faber Park to the end at Kent Ridge Park stopping for a late lunch at Hort Park. Take a hat and a bottle of water. If we find ourselves in Singapore in the future we would do this walk again. Highly recommended."
,,Interesting Walk,5.0,,"Walked this from the base to the top of the hill. It is a fairly easy walk that has lots of twists and turns. What makes this interesting is the fact that you are in the middle of a major urban area amongst the greenery and tropical vegetation. I suggest the walk from the bottom to the top. Sun hat, sunscreen and good walking shoes. Early in the morning or late afternoon is the best. There are parking lots at the top and bottom and you easily reach this by public transportation. I enjoyed it because it was not too busy. The views from the walk are diverse and spectacular especially the older homes on the side of the hill. They remind you of old Singapore"
,,Wonderful walk,5.0,,We walked from harbour front metro station up to mount faber peak then on to Henderson waves bridge and through the metal forest canopy to Hort Park all the way through to kent Ridge park - you can break it up into smaller walks. From Harbourfront to Kent Ridge park took about 2.5hours and burnt a whopping 650kcals really lovely walk - in the thick of nature while still seeing the city skyscrapers in the distance - we really really enjoyed this and would recommend to all.
,,One time up and a long time down above the city,5.0,,from harbor front MRT i visit the the small hawker center on the root of mt. faber for fruit juices and than walk up a little bit. On top of mt. Faber you have a nice view to the residential area and the business district. there are guidance on the floor guiding to Henderson wave and so on and so on
,,Connecting Green Spaces,4.0,,"You can join this connecting walk from several points from Mount Faber Park to Kent Ridge Park. I joined from an easy to find connecting path near to Vivo City / Harbour Front MRT and walked through to Hort Park. Along the way you have great views over the city, walk across the Henderson Waves and enjoy a walk high up in the tree line. Hort Park was another immaculate public space with well tended garden rooms all with named botanical specimens. An escape to the country only a couple of stops along the MRT from the CBD."
,,Beautiful walk - bring a picnic,5.0,,"You can start this Southern Ridges walk at Mount Faber and walk to Kent Ridge Park or the other way around. It's around 2 hours roundtrip for me to walk from Kent Ridge (bottom of Pepys Rd) to Mount Faber Park (just after the Henderson Wave) and back. There are restrooms & water fountains at Kent Ridge Park, Hort Park, Telok Blangah Park and at Mount Faber so if your okay to drink the water (some are filtered and chilled) from these water fountains, you don't need to bring a lot of water with you. There are plenty of spots for photos and benches to take a rest. As these parks are heavily shaded in areas and have storm shelters, you can easily stay cool/dry as needed. It's best to begin your walk as early in the day as possible or bring a torch/flashlight if you plan on walking after dark. There are lights along the pathway but not every section is lit."
,,Hiking within easy reach of the city!,5.0,,Dadagee’s “escape the madness” review gives a really good summation of the southern ridges walk so I just want to add in a bit following our exploration yesterday! We started from Harbourfront and when you get to Alexandra Arch/Hort park you can detour down the road 1km to the Labrador Nature Reserve - you can do a loop of this and then come back and continue the southern ridges or whilst in Labrador you can loop back to The Harbourfront mrt using the boardwalk over the water to the Keppel bay marina and housing complex which is a nice walk as an alternative.
,,Nice view,3.0,,"The 10km interconnecting set up was nice and I agree that’s it’s a nice break from the city however I didn’t find it to be quite worth the high trip advisor rating. At the current ranking my mindset was that it would be more than just a hike so my opinion might have been jaded based off that assumption. That being said I agree it’s a complete seperation from the city and even getting to it you will feel like you are away from the hustle and bustle. I would plan on a day of it; pack plenty of water as it’s a hike and you run out on a hot day. While in the park you should take advantage and take the cable car. I did these on separate days and basically you end up going to the same place twice by not combining these. Ideally I would have planned this, cable cars, and a day in Sentosa together leaving early in the morning."
,,Natural beauty,5.0,,A ton of guests to Singapore don't understand how much nature is at their doorstep. This stunning region is an amazing treetop walk that includes various districts.
,,Escape the madness,5.0,,"A great way to escape the madness of Singapore City. The Southern Ridges are a series of interconnected walks along a ridge west of Singapore City, looking out over the straits.

The walk starts at HarbourFront MRT, where you can either walk up the Marang Trail into Mount Faber park - you can also get a cable car from Sentosa. Great views of the city and the straits. You can get something to eat and drink at the Jewel Box. From Mount Faber, walking west, you gently climb up to Henderson Waves, and then into Telok Blangah Park, which has a collection of large trees set around private residences.

Then onto the Forest Walk, which is 1.3km of raised metal walkway, taking you through the treetops. There’s warnings of monkeys and snakes, but we never saw any. This section is really spectacular, and definitely recommended. Going west it gently slopes down; it might be hard work going east.

After Alexandra Arch, the trail goes into the more formal HortPark, which you could spend up to a couple of hours in if you’re interested in plants. Finally, there’s another elevated section - Canopy Walk - and then you can walk down to Science Park Drive and get the bus to Kent Ridge MRT. We missed out this bit, taking a bus back from Alexandra Road. (Google Maps is good for bus times and planning). Buses are good as you get to see various parts of the city you wouldn’t normally visit.

This was really enjoyable, and a contrast to the rest of Singapore, but we weren’t prepared for walking in the hot, humid atmosphere. The whole Southern Ridges walk is only 10km, which shouldn’t have been a problem for us, but we ran out of time (and water!). It takes far longer than in cooler climes - so do allow plenty of time, and take plenty of water.

Absolutely recommended - but be prepared!"
,,On top of the city,5.0,,This is an amazing trail. You walk past the huge harbour on top of the trees to Mount Faber. Get out at Kent Ridge MRT and walk 4 combined parks towards the southern ridges & mount faber. It takes about 10KM if you do the entire route. Afterwards nice to take the cable cart down and take a dive at the beach of Sentosa!
,,A different view of Singapore,5.0,,"If you have time and want to do something a little less touristy this walk is well worth it. The route is easy to find, and well sign posted and you can pick it up and leave it at many points.
We started at Mount Faber, having taken the cable car up from Harbourfront MRT station. The walk is on elevated steel walkways from much of the route and you really feel as if you're amongst the tree tops. The views are great, near and far, and there are butterflies, birds and sometimes monkeys to see. The route goes through Hort Park which is worth exploring in itself, as it's made up of many small individual ""gardens"" showcasing different styles. It also takes in the Henderson wave bridge which is a fascinating structure.
The elevated section at Ridge park is closed for maintenance at the moment (Feb 2018) but follow the signs for it to get to Burkit Chandu, a small museum in remembrance of the Battle of Pasir Panjang."
,,Unbelievable gem in the center of Singapore,5.0,,"We hiked the entire elevated trail system. It provides shaded coverage, relatively flat, some grade and some stairs. It is rather unbelievable that this structure goes through the center of the city. You are in the jungle - yet so close. Nice views. Easy to spend some time here."
,,romantic at night,5.0,,"Come here at evening to watch the sunset, or come here at night when the weather is cooler for a nice evening stroll after dinner, good views good atmosphere"
,,Steel Stairways and Walkways,5.0,,"one of my fave attraction in Singapore. Don't miss this after the Henderson Waves, this is the next attraction when you crossed over. Gentle steel stairways and walkways, very easy to walk. view of the surrounding forest and distant buildings."
,,Wonderful place for trekking,5.0,,"Great place for trekking with your family or friends. Fresh air, full of greenery and chances of seeing monkeys."
,,back to nature,5.0,,A lot of visitors to Singapore don’t realise how much nature is at their doorstep. This amazing area is a breathtaking treetop walk that encompasses numerous regions.
,,Fantastic walk,5.0,,Fantastic walk we caught the MRT to Labrador park and walked in from the city end. Aerial walk is sensational. The views are great and the walk is not to steep take plenty of water as I didn't seem to find any refill stations on the way. Labrador MRT is also close to the start of a boardwalk that takes you along a wetland.
,,Good Hike,5.0,,"Best place to hike or cycle over the weekends. Go early in the morning, if you want to avoid the crowd"
,,Walk in the park,4.0,,"1. Read about this 10km ridge walk and decided to give it a try. I started from the suggested starting point at Marang trail.
2. Fairly easy route, and felt it was like a walk in the park, as the route is all paved roads, man made structures and some steps.
3. There are lots of big beautiful trees along the way but some paths are quite open and hot.
4. I exited via the entrance to Kent ridge park, and decided to take a bus ride (across the road) to Kent Ridge mrt station as it was getting quite late in the evening.
5. Southern Ridge is something worthwhile to try if you enjoy walks , listening to birds chirping, and admire flowers, greenery, or just getting away from crowded places."
,,Fantastic walk,5.0,,"After consulting some reviews here, we decided to begin our walk from Science Park (Kent Ridge MRT, Exit B) and finished at Mount Faber Park (Harbour Front MRT), which turned out well as we treated ourselves to a nice lunch at VivoCity. We thoroughly enjoyed the walk, which took us about 3 hours. Highly recommended if you enjoy nature. Consider taking some snacks with you as there were no food stops along the way (though there were plenty of vending machines)."
,,Fabulous Experience,5.0,,We absolutely loved this walk including the two peaks and the Henderson Wave. A really good afternoon out with outstanding views and easy parking by the art college. Not an easy walk to do the whole thing in the midday / afternoon heat but well worth the effort.
,,Extrordinary Sights,5.0,,I often walk there. Great scenery across the harbour. The high walking bridges are remarkable. I recommend to visitors. Wear a sun hat.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"This is a definite must! We started at mount faber park and ended at kent ridge. The scenary was amazing. This walk included all the best views from henderson waves, hort park and the canopy walk. It was an exhausting day because we were dripping with sweat in the 30°+ heat but it was worth it. I would definitely recommend taking lots of water and some snacks as it took us about 3 hours with rests and taking in the scenary. Would love to do it again."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,This walk/hike is a must whilst you are in Singapore ! It's gorgeous. Takes a few hours but you see some amazing views go through some beautiful parks as well. You can also do this as quick or as slow as you want.
,,Bridges at tree top level,5.0,,"Definitely walk along Henderson Waves - high amongst the trees offering a beautiful view and quite simply a remarkably creative pedestrian bridge: unusual, aesthetic structure reminds us of waves.
Other sights to walk through such as the Forest Walk and Canopy Walk... listen to the birds, enjoy the quiet away from yet in the middle of the amazing city of Singapore!"
,,Absolute Must-Do!,5.0,,"Amazing walk around so many beautiful environments following numerous trails! Plenty of platforms and walkways, a great way to spend a few hours walking across the city!"
,,Southern Ridges walk,5.0,,"did this walk on xmas day 2017 in the afternoon after spending morning at Sentosa. i walked from Harbour Front start of trail is to the right of bus interchange behind Harbour front paved and steps to the top. great views and scenery changes all the way along this walk Henderson waves is great walking bridge over Henderson road whole track is sign posted so easy to follow when you get near the end go to ""Reflections Of Bukit Chandu "" story of the Malay regiments last battle in the fall Of Singaposre i walked to Kent rd MRT station for train back to Harbour frt. it took me 31/2 hrs to do 10k at easy pace and stops to admire views."
,,Lovely walk along the ridges,4.0,,"Starting from Harbourfront, this walk goes all the way to NUS, with a variety of bridges, treetop walks and Through Hort Park. Takes a couple of hours and the exits are close to MRT stations. I have done this walk a few times now and really like it but the signposting is poor. Good to carry a map to make sure you are moving in the correct direction."
,,Outdoor activity must in Singapore,5.0,,If you are the person who loves outdoor activity. Do not be hesitate to stop by this place. The walkway is easily in the forrest.
,,A wonderful forested escape from the city,5.0,,"Being resident in the UAE where city walking is pretty much impossible (and devoid of natural interest) we jumped at the chance on a recent long weekend in Singapore to complete the Southern Ridges trail. We started at Kent Ridge MRT and went all the way to Harbour Front MRT. The beginning is a little tricky to find but if you walk downhill you eventually reach vigilante drive and access to the start of the trail. The sights are spectacular, especially the elevated canopy sections and bridges over freeways with stunning views of the Singapore cityscape on either side. The walking wasn’t too tough either, just a little damp and humid unsurprisingly! A fantastic (and free) must see attraction if visiting Singapore."
,,Really enjoy this walk,5.0,,"I have done this walk a few times as I visit family in Singapore on a regular basis. Totally enjoy the walk and by some piece of luck have never been caught in the rain. I have never seen large crowds on this path, maybe I am just lucky!! I would certainly recommend if interested in the scenic and natural views.

Last few visits have been started by coming in by bus and dismounting at Harbour Front. Walk across the car park (right hand side), note where motorbikes are parked and go there as that leads you onto the climb up through the narrow gateway. The path climbs up, and then you get to the cable car point with some nice views. At the end of the road you can bear right and head straight to Henderson Waves or bear left and go up to the actual summit of Mount Faber. Invariably there will be some coach tours out there, behind the top there are steps down (not too easy to find) which get you down to a road and then you right turn up for the way to Henderson Waves. This is just a great piece of architecture to see, and just a steady gentle climb. Beyond the Waves you eventually come to the canopy walk over Teloch Blangah Hilltop Park for 1.3Km with some lovely views of trees and shrubs (can always go to the bottom and walk along the floor), again great. Before doing this you can note a climb up to Terrace Gardens for yet another panoramic view. Some steep step climbing. After the canopy walk it is then Alexandra Arch over the road and onto Hort Park. This park is very different to the previous ones, and worth the contrast. Very well maintained. At the far end of the park, the path winds up to the Kent ridge on another shorter treetop walk, where there are some reflective posters from WW2, and more views. There is also a nearby museum.

The option can then be to walk back and get a bus or taxi or follow the signs for the Kent Ridge Pond. There you will see a map showing directions to Kent Ridge MRT (less than 20 mins to get there).

The straight walk from Harbour Front to Kent Ridge is about 90 mins, but enjoying the scenary obviously adds more time.

I have seen monkeys on the canopy walk in the past, but not for a while.

Not all parts are well sign posted, the easiest option is probably to start from Alexandra Arch and return to Harbour Front. This is also the most attractive part of the whole walk."
,,Good hiking trip,4.0,,Mount Faber park is a good trail hike in Singapore. You need to start at Harbourfront MRT and go all the way till Henderson Waves that connects to Telok Blanglah park.
,,Amazing nature walk!,5.0,,"I didn't image how there is a secondary forest within a city. The Southern Ridges is one of great answer. Starting from very convenient MRT HarbourFront, it leads to the hill with bird-eye through the city. Old trees to high trees. Amazing Henderson Waves to sky trail, from top to bottom. The more you walk, the more exciting it makes.
P.S: walking in early morning is the best, then you can visit a lot of places around HarbourFront."
,,Leafy walk through the city,4.0,,This is a nice jungle walk which crosses the city. It can be long and there are some steps but it is relatively easy and a pleasant walk with some nice photo opportunities.
,,Was always a well kept secret,4.0,,"The Southern ridges was always a great quiet place to go for a long walk with some good views of Singapore. Lately it is becoming more and more popular. My only gripe is when it rains, and it often does when I go out walking, it is often difficult to find shelter."
,,Great Trail with great view,5.0,,"Very nice easy walk between tree tops. good breeze, great view. Recommended to come early morning to Mount Faber summit and go all the way down by ""The Southern Ridges"". easy and great way to start your day"
,,This was my greatest experience in Singapore!,5.0,,"The views! This high-tech nature walk offers unusual city views from within a green space, much of it one to three stories above the ground. Delightful! For architecture lovers, Henderson Waves is not to be missed!"
,,Needed more info before starting!,3.0,,"After taking ages finding the start of this walk after leaving the MRT station at Harbourfront & doing the walk to Hort Park, we realised we would have done better to have caught the bus from opposite MRT station, bus numbers 61,93,97, 100 or 963 direct to Hort Park & walked back. The walk in the trees & the Henderson Wave bridge were very impressive. Hort Park was rather disappointing."
,,Nice Walk with great scenery,4.0,,"I have done this walk several times and each time enjoyed it. Normally I start at the Vivo City End and make my way along the paths to exit at Kent Ridge. But if I'm feeling up to it I continue past Kent Ridge and exit at Clementi Road and walk down the hill to the famous Roti Prata eatery for a snack.

Its a good workout and not too strenuous with the advantage that if you are feeling tired its easy to get off the walk and find transport to take you where you want to go.
Bring water, a sunhat and if there is a chane of rain a small foldable umbrella"
,,Great for Long Walks!,4.0,,"A great place to go running, jogging, for long walks, and just slow walk around in. I recommend a taxi to get to one of the main parks, before you start your adventure."
,,"first time, after so many visits in Singapore",5.0,,"my first walk along this track. Nice view and a totaly other perspective of the city. Easy to walk and not too long. Only 2,5 km one way. So could be done forth and back"
,,Leg-stretching and scenic escape from city streets,4.0,,"I did this complete walk again yesterday as a prelude to a long flight back to Europe and it was good preparation. Mostly well-signed, there were two or three points where it was a little disjointed for those who don't know the area well. That, however, was a very minor issue and there are static maps posted along the way. Just take a paper version with you to connect the dots.

The start from Harbourfront is not well-indicated but easy enough if you follow this route...I took the MRT to Harbourfront and turned away from the shopping mall after exiting the ticket gates but while still underground (it is signed for the bus terminus and hawker centre). This route takes you through an underpass to avoid crossing the busy road. I then walked through the open-air car park towards the hill and the far right corner, where there is a narrow gateway and a footpath to the left. The path climbs up, in a ten-minute sweaty walk, to Mount Faber. I then followed the signs to Henderson Waves, which is a spectacularly high walkway over a busy road. The walk takes you then to Hort Park, via a long and impressive treetop walkway. In the past, I have met monkeys on this walkway, though none were evident yesterday. The views of the varied trees and shrubs is lovely, even without wildlife. Hort Park (the name is short for Horticultural) has toilets and drinks/snacks machines and a visitor centre. It is an impressive example of horticultural skills, in contrast to the forested parts of this walk. At the far end of the park, the path winds up again to the ridge on another shorter treetop walk, at the top of which is a small, but sobering and impressive, museum and memorial to the lives lost in Singapore during the Japanese Invasion.

The walk continues for a while along Kent Ridge at the end of which you can descend to a road with bus service (but not on Sundays!). Turn left and walk for ten-fifteen minutes to find Kent Ridge MRT to take you back to Harbourfront or, on a circular route with interchanges, towards Doby Ghaut MRT Station.

Along the way, there are toilet facilities and storm shelters. Since a thunderstorm was approaching, I noted the locations of the shelters, in case I had to turn back. You do not want to be caught in the open in a tropical thunderstorm! I did not check the time, but I think it took about 2.5 hours and was probably 10 kms long. You can start or break this walk at various points."
,,Great view of Southern Singapore,4.0,,"Good location for a jog or brisk walk and also to check out the southern side of Singapore from the hilltop. Several public (free) car parks in the proximity for visitors who drive. There are covered shelters, vending machines & also public toilets for park users."
,,Jungle meets the city,5.0,,"Gorgeous walk, you forget for a while where you are! Walkinh through lush green jungle, high in the tree tops its perfect on a sunny day. Completely forget you're anywhere near the big city - we even saw an orange snake on the path. Definitely worth a visit"
,,Great walk,5.0,,My friends and I did the walk from Kent Ridge Park to Mt Faber. Easy park to access via MRT. the walk through the different parts was relaxing and really interesting. Views are fantastic. Plenty of places to stop along the way and we enjoyed and ice cream at the top of Mt Faber. Would def recommend to do the walk.
,,Beautiful walk,5.0,,"A great walk for various fitness levels, giving a nice contrast to the urban side of Singapore. We began the walk by getting off the MRT at Kent Ridge and walked to Harbour Front. There are places to fill up your water bottle enroute and comfortable walking shoes are advised."
,,You must do this if you are in Singapore,5.0,,Luckily went mid-week where it was dead quiet. Did the 10Km trail and found it brilliant. Highlight definitely Henderson Waves followed by metal gangway forest walk. Unfortunately didn't see any monkeys :-( Maybe next time!
,,Little piece of wilderness in the City,5.0,,"How wonderful to walk in the treetops along this elevated walkway, Many entrances and exits. Ground levl path too, So much information about the birds,"
,,A long walk,4.0,,We did this walk later afternoon when weather was already nicer weather. It is a great place to visit and walk.
,,A hidden in treasure- great day of hiking!,4.0,,"This was a bit more a hike than we initially realized. We walked more than 7miles on trails that could have been better marked. We started from Kent Ridge park which had more steps than we wanted, but we eventually made it to the canopy walk. From there We found a WW2 museum (bukit Chandu) which is well worth a stop. Then it was a walk thru HortPark followed by a walk to Alexandra Arch which included a Forrest walk on an elevated bridge that lasted 1.3 km. Thankfully, that was flat as well as Henderson Waves. Great views all around and well worth the 3 hour effort. Make sure to bring water, sunscreen and a hat!"
,,Good way to get some exercise and enjoy the greenery!,5.0,,"Went for a late afternoon walk with my family. We really enjoyed it ! It's flat and easy, and great to have so much greenery around, and under your feet. What an experience. We will definitely be back!"
,,Nice walk,4.0,,"It was a really amazing experience for the 2 of us, my girlfriend and I. We started at the Faber trail and finished at the Alexandra arch bridge for a total of 9km approximately. Gotta see some different part of Singapore :). Enjoy it!"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"This is a three hour walk so come prepared with water, sunscreen and hat. It was not easy to get to by bus or the MRT as the train stops at Harbour Front, then you walk to the start point. We took the cab to the start point. I love the serenity of the whole place. You get a panoramic view of the city and harbour plus it doesn't feel like you are exercising. The best for me was Henderson Bridge. The wave-like structure consists of what looks like ribs. Fascinating. You do get to see lots of flora and fauna. I didn't get to see any monkeys, but you are reminded that they are in the forest.
Even though the walk was long, it was worth the trip. Put this as a must do thing."
,,Nice for Short City Get Away (But not fantastic),3.0,,"My wife & I went to the southern ridges yesterday at about 830pm to walk. We walked from Henderson Wave to proposed Kent Ridge Hill.

Pros:
1) Nice Relaxing getaway from city & urban Singapore
2) Nice walkways to view above trees
3) Nice layout of walkway specially designed for people to walk around
4) Forest walk is above trees nice designed

Cons:
1) NO proper signage from bus-stop & street level to point visitors to where is the opening for Henderson wave - u cannot expect first time visitors to hunt for it. Though the bridge can be seen from the street U will be scratching your head where is the entrance which is in Telok Blagah Hill
2) Henderson Wave is a bit short & views blocked by tress - LOL
3) Though there are signs to point to Kent Ridge it was not design properly
4) Don't go at night - the place is EXTREMELY dark cannot see the trees & forest below
5) Many of the vantage points are covered by tall trees so you cannot look out to good views
6) misleading signs
7) no water fountains - please bring your own bottles.
8) We got lost in Hort Park (entrance) because there won't any PROPER signs pointing to Kent Ridge
10) Not much place to sit
11) The top of Telok Blangah hill is closed for reno so u cannot go up to have nice views - waste time
12) the sign which points to Kent Ridge Park IS WRONG!! we ended at Bukit Chandu LOL

overall ok for city dwellers don't expect fantastic at night. I think day light would be much better views"
,,Great place for exercise,4.0,,I usually go there for morning or evening walks as it is less crowded and the location is away from the hustle and bustle. The views at the top are stunning. I recommend spending about 1 to 1.5hrs here to enjoy the scenery and end off at VIVO or Harbourfront for snacks.
,,Beautiful landscape,5.0,,"If you want to scape from the city, this is the prefect place. There are different pathways that you can use depending on the time, distance and difficulty. The shortest walking tour arriving to the TreeTop Walk and turning back is about 3 hours."
,,Great Running Trail,5.0,,"I have been running from Mount Faber to Alkaff Mansion to Kent Ridge for many years, even before the connection pedestrain bridges were built. With those bridges and tree top paths, the route has become much more enjoyable. Nice scenery and seems to be more breezy too. If you add in Labrador Park and Keppel Island, it becomes half a marathon run, being hilly, quite challenging too."
,,'A City in a Garden',5.0,,"We had a lovely morning walk at the Southern Ridges, despite the early heavy rain, it didn't dampen our spirits and we were rewarded with fantastic views across the city and out to Sentosa. The walk is pretty easy going and does help you escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. I'd highly recommend spending a morning doing the walk."
,,Excellent place for a long walk/ run,5.0,,Good mix of natural tracks/ constructed wonders right in the middle of city. Henderson waves is my personal favorite in the Southern ridges
,,Enjoyable but most of it is too developed to experience any nature.,4.0,,"The walk is very easy and it is nice. However it is in the city and there are dozens of parking lots and concrete. The canopy walk is sadly not a swinging bridge as i thought. I saw lizards and snakes and loads of plants. The walk is very easy and of no challenge and it is easy to get to by public transport. If you have one day and want to experience nature, don't go. Only a limited bit of it was set up as a nature trail. It was boardwalks and pavements. It took my two hours to walk the whole 9km, plus i spent time sitting on a bench for some."
,,Wonderful walk in the middle of town,5.0,,"Walked from Hort Park via Henderson Waves to Mount Faber. It is a diverse, beautiful nature walk. It's not a difficult walk and signage is good. For a less crowded experience better to do it during the week. Recommended."
,,Another outdoor must-do attraction!!!,5.0,,"I highly recommend it for active folks who enjoy walking and jogging. Get yourself to the Alexandra and Depot roads crossing (the bus stops on the Depot Rd. near the Interlace* building, see below).

Right at the start of the pathway, the Alexandra Arch is a good spot to enjoy the labyrinth view of the Interlace building, esp. before and after sunset…

The metal elevated path is built high over the surrounding 'jungle', you have nice views of the forest, harbor and nearby public housing buildings... The walkway connects with the Telok Blangah Hill Park, the Henderson Waves and the Mount Faber park. You can combine them all for a nice leisurely walk. The Southern Ridges path is mostly uphill but once you reach its end and cross into the Terrace Garden in the in the Telok Balangan Hill park it's all downhill from there, all the way to the VivoCity Mall and transportation back to the downtown are and hotels.

Quite enjoyable, have some water with you and a towel to wipe off sweat;) Again, the best time to visit is late afternoon before sunset, when it starts cooling off a little, not much though... It's Singapore after all, hot and humid year round.

* A residential building that you can walk or view from the Southern Ridges walkway. It looks better from further away, at least in pictures, as a jumble of haphazardly laid out apartment blocks, unique, creative, and I'm sure functional. Another proof of why Singapore is one of the most innovative cities for creative and award winning architectural design. Made super popular by Instagram and drone photographers."
,,Am I really in a bustling metropolis?,5.0,,"Have done this walk from Kent Ridge Park (passing through the Horticultural Gardens) to Harbourfront many times. It's hard to imagine one is in a large city when walking amongst treetops. Always wildlife to see, particularly birds if you are interested in these."
,,Amazing and satisfying,4.0,,The scenery is fabulous and the bridge is really easy to walk. It can accommodate strollers easily. Perfect for people looking for some fresh air or to get some exercise.
,,amazing view and lotsa greenery,5.0,,went up for a walk with my partner and ended by doing a 10km hike ... amazing views and lovely feeling...
,,a gem in the city!,5.0,,"we didn't expect to find something like this in the city of lion. it took us almost 4hrs to traverse this marvelous stretch, that includes a lot of selfies, haha. very relaxing and comforting. it's a must see especially for those who wants to unwind from their daily busy life.

I suggest take the kent ridge to harbourfront route so you'll end up at Vivo City, and of course do it on a weekday.

it's a very satisfying experience."
,,Fun place for a walk,5.0,,"This is a very enjoyable place for a walk. If you have a dog you can take it with you, though the pathway is made of metal grills and our dog wasn't so sure it was a good idea to walk on it. He was ok after a while. LOL"
,,Beautiful scenery in a city,4.0,,"The view was beautiful and it can be a great place for walking. My children enjoyed looking at the different types of trees , fruits and flowers. They were hoping to meet some monkeys but we didn't see come across any. I definitely recommend this place to people who like nature and walking, but bring your mosquito repellent"
,,Nice walk!,4.0,,"This is a great walk from alexandra park up to mt. faber peak. great walk on the treetops, and then the beautiful henderson wave. Don't miss this end of the walk though :)"
,,Good for an evening stroll,3.0,,Popularized by recent Bollywood movie Badri ki dulhaniya. Not a must visit at all. Good for an evening stroll if you are in signapore for two weeks. Short trip travelers can avoid.
,,lovely,5.0,,nioce views can cater to your desired walk length or ability as u decide where to enter or exit amdist teh local haunst so u can stop off for food very relaxing and great for a workout or fun hike
,,Fabulous escape,5.0,,"This is a fabulous path which is very varied, combining bridges, woods, gardens, great views, shade, sun, benches and places to rest and easily makes a great Sunday with the entire family, friends or alone. Each part is different and you can access or exit on the way and just do parts rather than the entire long way. There is good signage and the entire route seems to be very well maintained."
,,"Start from Alexandra Road if you want the ""quick tour""",4.0,,"If you want to have just the highlights and a short walk, then use a bus or a taxi to go to the ""S P Jain"" bus station on Alexandra Road. At Alexandra Road, there is a possibility to enter the Southern Ridges trail and enter the jungle (in the Telok Blangah Hill Park), then cross the Henderson Waves bridge and then walk up to Mount Faber."
,,Special city hike,4.0,,This is a rather special and spectacular in-city hike. Go for it if you want a hike combining thick forest with landscaped gardens and cityscape views from the elevated boardwalks.
,,Enjoyable walk through city and forest,4.0,,"This walk is varied and interesting, with some great views. Bring plenty of water (at least 2 litres per person) as it is hard work in the heat! There is water available at Hortpark.

Download a map to your phone as it is not always obvious where to go, especially at the science park end."
,,Great way to spend a few hours,5.0,,"We started our walk from Harbour Front station then onto Marang Rd up to Mount Faber Rd, past chair lift station towards Henderson Waves bridge, its not until you pass Telok Blangah Hill Park the Southern Ridges tree top walk starts, and if you are energetic enough keep walking until you come to Kent Ridge Park from there you can head south towards W Coast Hwy to the nearest MRT station (Pasir Panjang), this walk took us 2.5 to 3.0 hours stopping along the way to take in the views, gardens/plants, places to purchase drinks and look for wildlife, all in all we a had a great time it was good to get away from the hustle of the city, it was well worth the effort, next time we’ll do a similar walk but at night time."
,,Great experience outdoor,5.0,,"Enjoy the air of ""forest"" right in the middle of a noisy and busy city. You can listen to both birds singing and construction noise at the same time. It has lots of exits to get back to the road so you don't need to go all 9km. Super safe with many signs so it's hard to get lost. With western people it's quite hot but for Asian it's totally fine. Perfect for teenagers to spend a day after shopping and eating around in Singapore."
,,A walk in the forest - in the city,5.0,,"The walk was fantastic with diverse vegetation and excellent walking paths. You are in the middle of the forest with a city around you everywhere you look. Strangely, you do not hear the city. Brilliant"
,,Difficult to follow,3.0,,"More a series of short walks as opposed to a long continuous hike. Some parts were very impressive and seemed surrounded in nature, while other times you pass through crowded parks or walk along a road. Signage from one point to another was lacking and we had to backtrack several times trying to find the next section. This would not be a problem if it were a continuous walk, but because this is more a series of short walks, the next section's location was not always obvious. I recommend taking a photo of a map posted on a board for reference during the walk."
,,Loves a good walk,5.0,,We did to and from. Started our walk from Harbour Front train station to the Kent ridge side and back... Dead tired after that but completely worth it. So many things to see and greens...
,,this is a great way to spend a few hours,5.0,,"whenever I am in Singapore I always try to find the time to do this walk from harbour front MRT to Kent Ridge MRT, last visit when we got to Kent ridge, we decided to walk back to harbour front, we enjoyed the walk that much"
,,Great evening walk,5.0,,"We visited the Southern Ridges starting from Hort Park along Alexandra Road and walked through the Forest Walk and then over Henderson Waves and up to Faber Peak on a Saturday evening. It was a very pleasant walk and not as busy as I expected it to be.

The scenery along the way is breathtaking and really embraces the Singapore Garden city theme. Amazing how the trees and buildings compliment each other.

We finished at the top of Mt Faber and had dinner at the restaurant by the Cable Car station. Great looking over Sentosa island and the straight while enjoying a drink with the family."
,,Nice perspective,4.0,,"I walked up mount faber, over the henderson waves and along some trails. The southern ridges offer a lovely perspective of the scenery. The sign posts are very helpful and easy to follow."
,,Ok,3.0,,"The sign posting within this area was difficult to follow at times and so we ended up meandering around, hoping to find the bits we wanted to see. Parts of the canopy walkway were ok but nothing too special. If you're looking for a nice walk with plenty of wildlife, MacRitchie Reservoir is a better option, in my opinion."
,,Unique nature walk with excellent views,5.0,,"if you are looking a place for a nature walk with has nice views where you walk or jog on top of trees and passing very uniquely designed bridges, then this is the right place - you can start from Mount Faber, passing the magnificent Henderson Waves bridge to Telok Blangah Hill then on tree top walks to Alexandra Arch bridge to Hort part and continue there uphill to another canopy walk to Kent Ridge Park, or alternatively at Alexandra Arc branching towards Labrador Nature Park and ending up at the Bukit Chermin Broadwalk - stretching in total almost 10km long."
,,Brilliant way to spend half a day,5.0,,"There are many things to do in Singapore, but a scenic and centrally located trek is a must do! The bridges you walk across along the way are beautiful and the scenery changes from mountain, to forest to sea in a matter of kilometers. Bring water and wear sensible clotches as it gets very hot!"
,,Don't miss this,5.0,,Probably best to do this walk early morning before it gets too hot. Great walk and you don't have to do the full 7km as you can just do bits
,,Excellent walk from Harbourfront,5.0,,"I did this twice over a week, starting from Harbourfront MRT. There are 2 routes and I did both as the second half of both routes offers differing experiences. Route 1 goes through Horte park to Kent Ridge. Route 2 goes through a small mangrove area to the sea. I ewnjoyed the second route more as there is a smart walkway along the shore back to Harbourfront MRT."
,,Lovely rainforest walk,4.0,,"We enjoyed walking the whole length of the Southern Ridges. It was raining most of the way but we wore waterproof jackets and got on with it. The views were still fab, and it was amazing to see city high rise blocks right up next to the rainforest. I thought the walk might be more challenging but it was clearly marked paths and boardwalks all the way with not much steep gradient. There were signs in the forest saying what to do if you encounter monkeys, but sadly we did not. A great thing to do for free when you want to get away from the malls and manmade attractions of Singapore."
,,for nature lovers !!,4.0,,silent and serene !! very beautiful for evening walks !!! not a must do thing in Singapore !! but dont hesitate to head here if you have the time !!
,,Fabulous walk - I've done it 4 times and I love it,5.0,,"I love the Southern Ridges walk, it's amazing how you can still be so close to the city of Singapore and yet feel so far away from it. You can really enjoy the walk and relax away from the busy city life. The tree-top walk goes on for 1.8kms (I think), and is amazing. The Henderson Waves bridge is a beautiful piece of architecture. You might be lucky and spot some wildlife along the way, but even if you don't, you'll be sure to get some fantastic photos and stunning views."
,,Great relaxing morning walk,5.0,,Great tree tree top walk with my spouse and the walk end up at mout faber. Don't drive there as the starting point is far from the end point passing the wave bridge spectacular views of Keppel harbour and it all free
,,Wonderful walk with great vistas,5.0,,"We hiked the southern ridges yesterday starting at Marang Trail beside on of the exits of HarbourFront MRT Station. We climbed up Mt Faber using the steps along the Marang Trail and reached the TOP in about 15 minutes. We then walked to the Science Park, vis Faber Walk, Henderson Waves, Sembcorp Forest of Giants, Forest Walk, Alexandra Arch, Hort Park and Canopy Walk ending at Kent Ridge Park. It was a pleasurable way to spend 3 hours. The distance covered was about 10 km."
,,great walk,5.0,,"really good to see, and easy to get too. everyone is friendly and helpful you feel you are lost. try in the morning helps with the heat"
,,Excellent hike or run in the middle of Singapore,5.0,,"I frequently run the Southern Ridges trail but have also hiked it. I have even seen monkeys along the trail. I recommend going early because of the heat and starting at the stairs just near the MRT Harbourfront. It's easy enough to go from here into Hort Park and Kent Ridge Park also. Great views of Sentosa, Red Hill and the cable car."
,,You must have use it to believe it!,5.0,,To have such a walk in the greenest of green with fantastic views and walking for kilometers as many as you like through a 5 million people city state is something breathtaking. Don't miss it if you have the time and energy.
,,Excellent layout and design for walks,5.0,,The paths / walks layout and design are user friendly even for old folks. Scenic views from the bridges overseeing the luscious trees. You can take comfortable evening strolls especially after dinner nearing to sunset.
,,Run and walk,4.0,,Great morning run starting at Harbour Front. It's about 4.5 miles and then walked the reverse return. Spectacular views of the city and forest. Parts of the trail are pedestrian bridges along the treetops. Recommend morning or night when it's cooler and the sun is less intense.
,,Great walk - poorly signed if you start at Kent Ridge,4.0,,"This is a great walk and I highly recommend it. Lovely views, nature without really leaving the city and some seriously amazing architecture.

We read the reviews, checked all the maps etc and decided to do the wall from Kent ridge to Mt Faber to make the most of the sunset view. Getting from the MRT to the start point is an additional trek and there is no signage at all for the 'Southern Ridges'. The tourist maps are good for the gist of the directions but not the details. There are also a lot of other trails in the area that you could easily start down without realising you are in the wrong place.

It is worth doing the walk this way for the exact reasons we did - the sunset and night lights were stunning but take the time to clearly plan the route from the MRT to the start point or take a taxi - there are no helpful signs when you get there."
,,Very interresting walk with surprising views,4.0,,"We started the walk from the cable car station on mount Faber and walked the paths towards Kent Ridge. The going is not difficult provided you take your time and bring enough water - it can be quite hot and going uphill in part quite steep. But the views of the various trees, birds, flowers and the city through the greenery is very rewarding. It is possible to stop at different points on the tour and there are public restrooms at intervals."
,,"Gorgeous walk, spectacular views",5.0,,"Absolutely loved this walk, culminating at Mt Faber. Incredibly scenic with magnificent views across Singapore and the South China Sea. Make sure you catch the cable car atop Mt Faber for further spectacular views."
,,Nice place for walk or early run,4.0,,Walked along the trails to the peak then back down the way I came to Sentoso. Nice walk with some good views across the city. Nice way to spend half a Sunday.
,,A fairly nice walk,3.0,,"The best part of the walk by far is from the Harbourfront MRT station to Alexandra Arch. I wouldn't bother with the rest. You need a moderate level of fitness to do the walk as there is a little bit of climbing involved particularly at the start.

In terms of nature it has both good and bad. The green strip along the Southern Ridges is so thin that you can never escape traffic and construction noise. In the early mornings Telok Blangah Green in particular is full of locals, all exercising to rather loud music (despite signs saying playing of loud music is not permitted). This is not conducive to wildlife viewing, as during the heat of the day when the locals are absent the wildlife is also under cover.

Overall, if you wish to escape the shopping experience for a while, it is a good distraction. Some of the trees in Teok Blangah Green are labelled, and there are paths off the walk trail that can be followed through the Green and Mt Faber Hill Park which are worth doing as they are more isolated than the walkway itself.

If you are on your first visit to Singapore, I wouldn't bother. Just visit Mt Faber Hill Park and Henderson Waves and you will see the major attractions. Just remember it gets hot and can be very humid, so dress appropriately and carry water."
,,Diverse walk on good trail,4.0,,"If you LIKE being out in nature, wandering through different landscapes/plants then you will enjoy a break from the busyness of the city. GOOD points - the walk up to MtFaber starts right outside the MRT station. Diverse walkways including bridges, treetop walks, steps, ramps through forest, woodlands, tropical gardens, lookouts, etc are good for some exercise at your own pace. Views change and points of interest are signposted well. Toilets and water points are marked on the maps and are clean and accessible. CONSIDER - your fitness, particularly in the heat/humidity. I live in a tropical climate, yet I still found it very hot as we climbed the stairs and I didn't take much of a rest at the top. TAKE WITH YOU water or even a Powerade/Gatorade. Take a hat or poncho as there are open sections where you will get a lot of sun or rain. Take sunscreen. Enjoy the different plants, slow down and look around and you'll be amazed at what you see."
,,Not a ' must do' despite the rating,4.0,,"My partner and I tackled the Southern Ridges Walk on a recent trip to Singapore. Inspired by overeating and FOMO we decided to walk the entire track, starting at Harbourfront and finishing at the Kent Ridge station. You see the 'Southern Ridges' is a 9 kilometre path that connects the parks that exist on the Southern Ridge of Singapore. These are (From east to west) Mount Faber > Telok Blangah Hill Park > Kent Ridge park. The 9km track is broken up into 8 'trails' of various length which include (From east to west) Marang Trail > Faber Trail > Henderson waves > Hilltop Walk > Forest Walk > Alexandra Arch > Flora Walk & HortPark > Canopy Walk.

There were good and bad elements to this walk and here are a a few of my key thoughts and tips.

(1) To get here get on the MRT to the Harbourfront station. Once in the station depart it at 'exit D'. To your left you will see the start of the Marang trail. If you elect to do the entire thing you will pop out on the road near Kent Ridges station. You will need to get the bus (I think it was bus 91) which will take you to the Kent Ridge MRT station and from there you can make your way back.

(2) This is free

(3) There is really no need to complete the entire Southern Ridges walk and if I could have my time again I would only bother going from the Harbourfront station to the Alexandra Arch (Ie exiting at the start of the Kent Ridge Park) . The real highlights of this trek are the views from the top of mount faber, the henderson waves and the forest walk. None of the attractions to the west of the alexandra arch (Ie in Kent Ridge Park) are noteworthy and it becomes a bit harder to follow the trail with little signposting or direction. The majority of the trail is along a bitumen road and so you can comfortably exit at the alexandra arch without FOMO at this point in my opinion.

(4) Singapores heat is quite unrelenting. Don't underestimate it. Bring plenty of water, sunscreen and I would recommend tackling this in the late afternoon rather than the heat of the day.

(5) Unfortunately despite some greenery and the best efforts in terms of promotion there is nothing overly amazing in terms of views or nature. The entire time on the walk we could hear constant noise of construction and/or traffic.

Overall this was a ok but not amazing attraction in singapore. I think if you are first visiting singapore it is not a 'must do'. It's high position on tripadvisor is as much a reflection of the fact it is free rather than unmissable."
,,Average Walk,3.0,,Nothing spectacular- only the Henderson Wave bridge and another bridge are the major attractions. You can finish the entire trail within 2-3 hours. Good for a casual evening walk. Don't expect much.
,,Walk along a long east-west trail,5.0,,"The southern ridges are somewhere in the middle of a very long east-west walking trail, which links Sentosa in the south, Mount Faber in the west and Kent park in the East. You can easily walk tens of kilometers here. Combine that with a cabin ride to Sentosa or visot some of the museums, art or flower exhibitions by the trail. This is the most interesting walk in Singapore and it provides so many wonderful views.
The Southern Ridges is easy to walk. Not too much height differences. Not too crowded. Not too long."
,,Amazing views and plant life,5.0,,"We walked it from the start and vivo city, down to the Labrador MRT. Not as hard as I had fared. Easy track to walk on. If you have reasonable fitness it is worth the time. If you are a couch potato, don't bother."
,,Beautiful walk,5.0,,"I read the great reviews on here and decided the give this trail a try as I love nature walks but am not particularly in fantastic shape to do a really intensive hike. It was absolutely beautiful. I started from
The Alexandra Bridge and walked to Mt Faber. I particularly enjoyed the forest walk, which is an elevated metal walk way through at the canopy level through the forest. I went early on in the morning (around 9 am) to beat the heat and I think this is the best way to do it. It was not crowded at all, I only encountered a few joggers and a couple of tourists by the Mt Faber area. Which was quite a relief as many places in Singapore are packed with tourists (understandably, it's a beautiful city.) It's a great way to get a little away from the busy city and enjoy the beautiful natural flora that Singapore has to offer.

At the end there is the Seah Im food center which is a hawker center with lots of tasty food for dirt cheap. There's a metro station right there or you can get a taxi or Uber as well, they are all over the place. Overall, it was a wonderful way to spend a morning and I would recommend it to anyone who likes nature and is traveling to Singapore."
,,Great Walk,4.0,,"We started from Harbourfront,used the MRT to get there and used exit D, as you go out turn left and there is the start. We really enjoyed this walk, great viewing stops of Singapore and history as well. We walked as far as the canopy walk just past the Hort Park. We enjoyed this walk, we took water with us but could buy at a couple of stations on the way as well. It is well signposted as the whole walk is several joined together, the Henderson Waves bridge is spectacular and a highlight as well as the forest walk by the Mt Faber reservoir. I downloaded a map onto my phone and used this once to get our bearings. If you have time and want to get out of the bustle then this is a good choice. If you don't want to do the climb from the Harbourfront, you can use the Mt Faber cable car or get a bus to Mt Faber."
,,Fun and beautiful view,5.0,,"We started at Holt Park .- Conopy walk,.....Henderson waves, Forest Walk, ...and it will bring you to Vivocity and chill by the food court .. And catch a taxi/ MRT back to Hotel. Wear comfy shoes, water, sun screen. and camera."
,,Nice walk with a view,4.0,,"The shorter, scenic route can start at Vivocity and end at Hort Park or vice versa.
If you are starting at Vivocity, find the trail that leads to the Mount Faber. Take a short hike up and you will reach the peak of Mount Faber (if u want can take cable car....haha defeats the purpose of walking). Then recommended is Spuds and Aprons there, for delectable brunch food at a price with a view. Then you can follow the trail for Southern Ridges and get yourself to Henderson Waves and Alexander Arch. Then you can land at Hort Park that has a nice cafe as well.
From there, you can take buses to Queenstown/Redhill MRT to get to anywhere else.

Nice, clear walk for a weekend. Pray for good weather!"
,,I expected more,3.0,,"Short review: Go from Alexandra Arch to Mount Faber, don't underestimate the heat, don't expect it to be super ""naturey"". It's an OK attraction but if it's your first visit to Singapore, I wouldn't prioritise it.

Longer review: This walk has been on my long list for a while, after reading a very enthusiastic report about it in a travel guide (maybe Lonely Planet?). I tried to do it on my last trip to Singapore with my parents, but after visiting Haw Par Villa I started to feel ill and retreated to our hostel; my parents then went the wrong way and ended up wandering round the university campus, so I didn't even get to find out how it was from them!

Anyway, I thought my parents just had no sense of direction, and this time I decided to start at Kent Ridge MRT, confident that I could find the way. Ha! I'm so used to Singapore being super easy that I was completely thrown by the total lack of signposts outside the station. There was a map showing the park but nothing to indicate the best way into it. I ended up walking up Science Park Drive - it bends to the left, there's a turnoff to the right, then the next on the right should be a concrete path taking you into the park. Here there's a sign for the park but nothing about the ""southern ridges walk"", so you have to wander around (or in my case, use the Google Maps app on my phone without internet access) to figure out where to go.

Signposts and place names painted on the ground give inconsistent directions to the 'Memories at Bukit Chandu' museum and the canopy walk. I ended up doing the canopy walk and arriving at the museum, even though my guidebook (2016 Rough Guide this time - I didn't like it much) implied the walk came after the museum. I was hot and not in the best of moods by this time, but the museum is worth a visit if you're doing this part of the walk - even just for the A/C, toilets and vending machine with cold drinks! Seriously - it's very well done but very small; better to visit the museum in Changi or the Battlebox to learn about WWII Singapore.

Directions on leaving the museum were also useless; I think I should have turned left and gone down the steps on the right before the gated area that I think was housing, but I ended up redoing the canopy walk before finally making it to Hort Park. The guidebook recommended taking Hyderabad Road round the north of the park to see the ""tropical Tudor"" housing as the park itself was rather boring, and I should have followed their advice. Although there were many different sections to the park, I was too hot to enjoy any of them and it seemed more like a place locals would go for specific events.

I then got to Alexandra Arch; the path is a lot clearer from this point and I'd recommend you start here, unless you want to visit the fabulously freaky Haw Par Villa or Bukit Chandu first. You needn't worry about the canopy walk as east of the arch it's also an elevated walkway offering the same kind of view.

I detoured down to Gillman Barracks not long after the arch, which has been converted into a series of art galleries. Nothing really grabbed me but if you like contemporary art it's worth dropping in. Rejoining the main trail it was a straightforward walk to Harbourfront MRT, the highlights being the Henderson Waves Bridge and views from Mount Faber Park. Although my guidebook recommended doing the walk west to east to avoid the steep uphill hike from Harbourfront MRT to Faber Park, that part is very short; I think the best reason to do it this way round is to finish back in ""town"" with glorious air-conditioning and restaurants in VivoCity mall!

So overall, aside from the frustrating lack of signage at the beginning this is quite a nice walk. However, I got tired of walking on concrete and tarmac the whole way, and the views just weren't as interesting as I was expecting. So far I have been underwhelmed by both this and Pulau Ubin but highly enjoyed the Botanic Gardens, so maybe Singapore just isn't very good at truly ""natural"" nature. I'll have to try Bukit Timah nature reserve next time."
,,What a delight,5.0,,"With the help of a previous review (thanks Rinster2211) we started the walk from the Harbourfront MRT. Walked through the various stages until we reached Pasir Panjang. For those that need a break during the walk be advised that there are plenty of toilets, areas to rest up and take in the ambience of the Southern Ridges. Toilets are clean. The first part of the walk is largely uphill but from the top of Faber Peak it is a long progressive downhill or lesser incline. We stopped off at the Hortpark which is certainly worth visiting. We also took the opportunity to visit the World War 2 interpretative centre which is located at Bukit Chandu which is the old ""opium hill"". See our separate review of this amazing centre. The hawker centre outside of the Pasir Panjang MRT is a good spot for lunch."
,,Singapore from its most beautiful side,5.0,,"The Southern Ridges is my favorite trip in Singapore. I walked the route through the parks twice already and I can't wait for the third time. It is not really a hike, more like a walk, although the heat and the climate might be quite challenging. To me, it's the perfect combination of concrete jungle and the tree tops in the actual jungle. You can see wonderfully green Singapore from its most beautiful side!"
,,Hike to the cable car,5.0,,"We started from the Hort Park to walk on this. Its a cool shaded walk most of the way through. Its better to have some water with you because there isn't anything along the way. There was one vending machine at one point but needed coin and there was nowhere to change the money as we didn't have coin.
We climbed all the way to the cable car station which was about an hour and a half easy journey. Really nice view and relaxing. It feels like you are in some kind of forest.
It is quite amazing feeling. We loved it and will do it again if we ever go back to singapore again."
,,Nice Hike Close to the City,5.0,,"Take the MRT to Harbour Point. Merang Trail starts on the north side of the highway. There are several connecting trails along the Southern Ridges. If you go to Henderson waves, Forest Walk, Floral Walk, Hort Park and finally the Canopy Walk plan on at least 2 hours. RT is roughly 11 km. A good way to spend 1/2 a day. Bring plenty of water!"
,,A well sign posted enjoyable walk,5.0,,"Starting right by the station and walking straight into the jungle this walk is continually changing with different things to look at. Good views over Singapore, interesting bridges, raised pathways so you can walk through the tree canopy, visits to manicured parks even a museum to explore. At the end you just get the bus to the metro. Check before you start because walking through the jungle in rain and thunder storms is not allowed."
,,Great way to spend an afternoon.,4.0,,"Reasonably easy walk thats about 10km in total. When you think about Singapore, walking through forest is not what comes to mind but this is a lovely way to get away from the hustle and bustle."
,,Must see,5.0,,"If you are a nature lover, this is a must see place. Make sure you have your shoes and water bottle ready. Grab your camera and get walking. Don't forget the pictures. The view is spectacular."
,,Only the beginning but...,4.0,,"We went to see the Henderson Waves bridge (my friend didn't want to walk longer but of you are fit & prepared I think the Southern Ridges Walk would be sensational). Its easy to get to Mount Faber by taxi or cable car and the views out over Singapore are sensational.
The bridge is interesting, and seeing it from below and at night would be good."
,,A nice walk for a sunny day,4.0,,The southern Ridges provide a nice walk between different beautiful parks. You can walk above the forest and skyline. It's a nice activity for a sunny Sunday morning.
,,Great Green Gem,5.0,,"Just felt the need to do a walk in my home country n this was perfect. Easily accessible by public transport (start from Harbourfront MRT station exit D) and traverse through lush green tropical bushes. Easy and well marked terrain. Look out for yellow markings on ground n brown signages on posts. It's a walk with not much geographical variation but great for fauna and floral enthusiast. Also great for a 10km power walk out of the city. Do a toilet stop at Faber Peak. Great views from the toilet! Also a series of murals at Faber Point k below the Merlin depicting Singapore's history. We ended the walk at Kent Ridge Park, walked down the road to civilisation and found the Pasir Panjang MRT station (have to cross the road). And voila a cosy tiny hawker centre selling local food. I reckon if you do the walk late afternoon you can enjoy the bbq seafood stores in the food centre after the walk as they open later in the day. Great map on the national parks website. Do download it."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"Singapore is not only Orchard Rd. and endless malls. If one is looking for a good walk and to see a quieter side of Singapore, I can think of no better place than the Southern Ridges. We started at the Alexandra Arch which is at the entrance to Hort Park on Alexandra Rd, and headed toward Mt Faber and ended ultimately at the Harborfront MRT station. This is about a 3.5 km walk beginning with the Forest Trail which is an elevated walkway through the tree tops, leading to the beautiful Henderson Waves, and then past the Mt. Faber cable car station, and ultimately down the Marang trail. It can be done in an hour. In the 2 mornings we were there it was not at all crowded, actually virtually empty, and the morning sun had not begun to heat up the place. At the end of the Marang is the Seah Im food center, and a place to get juice or breakfast. And then catch the subway back to town. It is practically a perfect walk."
,,Urban Jungle,4.0,,"A series of paths and suspended bridges sometimes connecting two different hilltops and boasting wildlife combined with bird's-eye views. If you're in search for a high-wire act, The Southern Ridges will be a thrilling activity and also a pleasant respite from the bustle of the city."
,,Magnificent walk,5.0,,This is a superb walk especially during the week when it is quiet. Start at Mt Faber cable car. the steel walkways are quite high but very safe even for small children.
,,Conquer your fears!,5.0,,"Initially I was put off because I have a fear of heights. But once after 5 minutes, the fear turned into fun!"
,,Amazing walk from above the forest canopy,5.0,,Its an almost 3 km walk above the tree line. It was quite fascinating to get an aerial view of the forest. Also noticed an earth trail which takes down closer to the forest. Not sure where the entrance was. Nothing out of the ordinary to see but the walk was quite fun in itself. Once you enter there is no way to exit halfway. Either walk back the entire way or go to the other end. Other end leaves you at Alexandra Road.
,,Good for Long walks,5.0,,Southern ridges are known for their beautiful views. Good for Long walks to enjoy the beauty of nature. Must visit for all nature lovers.
,,A truly beautiful 9 km walking trail!,5.0,,Would do this again and again. The Southern ridges have various individual trails and each unique and offers a different experience. It is suitable for a slow walk and except for the stairs climb to Mount Faber (Which you can also avoid by taking the cable from Harbourfront to FaberPeak) it is not intensive. One can also attempt a part of the ridges (walk on and off the walking trails) as there are various entry and exit points during the entire stretch. A very enjoyable walk!
,,Leisure Walks,4.0,,A peaceful walk away from the sound of buzzing cities and cars. Enjoy the scenery of trees and natures while you are doing your workout..
,,Saturday morning walk from Harborfront to Hort Park,5.0,,"Very enjoyable walk, with a steep ascent from the Harbourfront end leading to great views, followed by a pleasant stroll down well maintained walking paths. A number of shady spots that's good for resting, bring your own picnic basket."
,,Beautiful walk for everybody,5.0,,"A gorgeous walk to go on when in Singapore! We got a taxi and asked to be taken to the Southern Ridges not knowing where was the best place to start. He literally dropped us off in the middle of the road and told us it’s a good place to start! We later found out it was Alexandra Arch. We walked across the Forest Walk, Hilltop Walk and finally Henderson Wave. It is very well signposted walking trail, and easy-to-read floor markings to take you in your desired direction. It’s a very clean and natural area with some great photo spots along the way. We loved Henderson Wave Bridge."
,,Cool place,4.0,,A cool place where you can relax and have a jog. It has an interesting architecture but it's not very accessible for everyone.
,,Long walk but great views and memorable experience!,4.0,,"Depart at Kent Ridge MRT to get to the start of this tour (which I found in Lonely Planet's Singapore guidebook), which takes you through Kent Ridge Park and the trail there, down to Hort Park, onto the Henderson Waves, and ending at Faber Peak. It is 8-9km in total I believe.
The walk from the MRT to the start of the trail is long and arduous, it took me about 25 minutes to find/navigate/walk.
I started this walk at about 11.30am (having left my condo at 10am!!), and so walked through the midday heat, which I wouldn't recommend as it's in the sun and sweaty enough as it is.
I found solace and rest in the community gardens at the end of the Kent Ridge Park section, which has lots of wonderful mini gardens you can explore, plus a restaurant, water fountain (needed!!), and public loos to put most others to shame!
The rest of the walk was delightful, I didn't see any monkeys on the canopy walk but it was delightful all the same. The Henderson waves really are only about 300m long, so expect to be a bit disappointed if you do that walk just for that (like me!), but the overall walk is so memorable and lovely (and perfectly fine/safe to do as a female solo traveller) that it doesn't matter in the end.
Plus at Faber peak you can hop on the cable car to Sentosa and head to Mambo Beach Bar (also reviewed by me) for a lovely lunch and couple of drinks on the beach!
All in all, a long but memorable day and definitely recommended!"
,,Unique trail,5.0,,"This is a great trail that takes you through a variety of different parks and forests with some spectacular views of Singapore. Several of the sections of this hike have long raised walkways which make it quite unique.

You can pick the trail up near Vivo City and walk all the way to Clementi if you like. We started at Vivo City and stopped when we got to Buena Vista for some well earned refreshments. Our walk was about 6km, and with all the up, down and photo taking took us 2 or 3 hours.

It is not a particularly difficult hike, and the pathway is mostly paved, with steps when it gets steep. You are able to take it at your own pace and do bring some water with you.

It is not very remote, it wends its way through the parks adjoining several different Singapore neighbourhoods. I felt this makes it quite unique and thoroughly worth the experience."
,,Hard work for a run but greenery is so relaxing,4.0,,Jungle in the middle of a sprawling city. Lovely green views and the track is very well maintained. Lots of runners and walkers on weeknights and for all fitness levels.
,,hot sweaty hiking,5.0,,"This is a really good walk / easy hike ... very much recommended on a cooler day, and take some water. If you are looking for a free and energetic activity in Singapore, this is it!"
,,Take in the forest views,5.0,,If you're looking for an easy walk and to get away from the city this is perfect. It's nearly 10km long but it's mostly flat with a few steps and really well guided. The views are stunning along the way.
,,Relaxing,4.0,,"It was a nice long walk. You will notice different trees & their heights along the way, as well as flowers. Watch out for the monkeys, also snakes."
,,Visit on a tour,5.0,,Stunning location. Great views of the city and harbours. Went there a part of the round island tour which is a must as it gives you a great insight of the islands history
,,Start at Mt Faber,5.0,,"If you start at Mt Faber, you can walk on the Southern Ridges across bridges and tree top bridges providing you with good views of greenery and buildings. It is a very pleasant walk! Best done on weekdays."
,,Eastern edge of Southern Ridges to West,5.0,,"Total duration took: 2+ hours (we made several wrong turns along the way but no big issues as the whole place is well connected, some way or other)

Starting point:
Harbourfront Station. Look for exit that states Marang Trail.

The route I chose went pass certain iconic points of Singapore.

Marang trail - Faber walk - Henderson waves - forest of giants - Alkaff mansion - forest walk - singing forest - Alexandra arch - hortpark - canopy walk

If you're a fitness buff this trail wouldn't be an issue for you. However I do have peers who find this slightly tough, especially at the beginning of Marang Trail as it's made up of steps mostly.

I will recommend starting early (7am starting?) so that you won't end up caught up in Singapore's hot noon sun."
,,A pleasant walk if you are appropriately dressed,4.0,,"If you are the sort of love nature and a quiet walk amidst nature, the southern ridges is a good experience. The walk is not too long and you can break off at various points. However, it's best in our tropical weather to wear shots/skort - I made the mistake of walking in jeans, and nearly melted though it was not that sunny."
,,Up in the canopy with the urban jungle,5.0,,"Loved my walk in the treetops, the yellow birds, noisy calls,thankfully no monkeys, shade on this hot day.
I love the way it has been built in such a densely populated area, even the taxi driver of 20 years plus didn't know it was there, maybe that is why there was no restaurant, despite the signage! Also if you want water or sweet drinks you need Singaporean cash, not tourist notes.
Loved the lush greenery, we returned by train but it was easier to take the taxi to the beginning"
,,Lovely walk,5.0,,We walked along Waves Bridge and then continued on to Mount Faber cable car station. Even though it was a hot day there was plenty of shade and it was an enjoyable walk.
,,Not to miss,5.0,,A great opportunity to fell like you are lost in the jungle while still being in the city. A bit of a climb to be expected.
,,Interesting walk thrugh Singapore flora,3.0,,"I hiked from the Hort Park in the west to Henderson mainly to see two things: the Forest Walk and the Henderson Waves Bridge. The forest walk was interesting but not spectacular. The Henderson Waves Bridge was a little disappointing. From the vantage point on the road, there is no easy way to get a pictures of the ""wave"". I got a better picture of the bridge after getting off the hilltop walk and took pictures from Henderson Road. The tress which gave rise to the forest walk also worked to hinder the view of the bridge."
,,Easy and enjoyable walk. Henderson Wave is spectacular,4.0,,"We do this walk fairly often, usually starting at Henderson Wave and finishing at Gillman Barracks where you can have a drink / ice cream."
,,Unusual,5.0,,"We got a taxi to the cable car from Marina Bay for very little money. We took the cable car to Sentosa for a few hours and then walked back down the ridges walkway, then taking a taxi back to the hotel although the bottom of the walkway is near the MTR station. Note that are steps which might not suit everyone. There is a utube video with more information."
,,Very good Singapore walking exercise,4.0,,"I read about this on Trip advisor so I tried it out. I was looking for a reasonable walking exercise experience. And it fit the bill. I started at the Marang Trail point and walked to the Kent Ridge park finish. Took a little over 2 hours. Very nice views of Singapore along the way. Be sure to bring a light day pack to carry water, and snack. Wear good sneakers. And be prepared for several areas of stairs and inclines. Overall a great way to get outdoors and get some exercise."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"Brilliant walk with great views of the city. The Henderson wave was particularly impressive. The first sections are very humid, so avoid walking in the middle of the day."
,,Great fitness walk with a view,4.0,,I did the Southern Ridges walk at mid day from Lock road towards the Harbour front MRT station. The walk is aligned all walks of life but I would encourage people to take water and probably medium level of fitness if you want to do the entire walk. The views on the walk made it extremely enjoyable. I would comment the easiest way to get to the walk is MRT to Harbour front station.
,,"Great park, great views. Monkeys?",5.0,,"I visited on a mid-week morning here. The park was very well maintained and signed. Highlights include the Forest Walk at the west end and the Henderson Waves bridge in the center and, of course, Mt Faber.
There were signs warning of monkeys, but I never saw or heard them.
Bring plenty of hydration for the beautiful walks.
Some of the hills can be strenuous, but just take your time. The climbs are worth it."
,,Small hiking,3.0,,It was good enough small hiking which is under 5km. It's very good view and I took cable to Sentosa island. Many beautiful flower and great people:)
,,Excellent urban walk,5.0,,Great to be able to find a well marked path taking you along the 'peaks' and in the equatorial vegetation. Loved running into HortPark and then WWII Memorial.
,,Lovely Nature Walk,5.0,,"I started the walk from HortPark, leaving HortPark via the Flora Walk, the Alexandra Arch, a beautiful curved deck, tilted arch bridge. After crossing the Alexandra Arch bridge, I reached the Forest Walk. It is a steps-free elevated walkway of 1.3 km long.It was a wonderful feeling to walk above the lush greenery. After the Forest Walk, I reached an intersection point. Either I continue my walk to Henderson Waves or take a Hilltop Walk to the Telok Blangah Hill Park. I walked up the steps to the Hilltop. Most people skipped the Hill Park, it is definitely worth a visit especially if you have not been. Telok Blangah Hill Park was originally part of Mount Faber Park, the ridge that the parks used to share was cut across by the extension of Henderson Road in the mid 1970s. Today, the Telok Blangah Hill Park and Mount Faber Park are connected again by the Henderson Waves at 274 metres long, the longest pedestrian bridge in Singapore. Another kilometre away is the Mount Faber. The Mount Faber Point reminds me of the Seoul Namsan Tower, the much smaller version though. It took me about two hours to walk to Mount Faber and back to Hort Park. Start early in the morning, I am sure you will enjoy the walk."
,,Nice and beautiful quiet walk,5.0,,Started at Kent Ridge which I feel is great because you then walk through all the different parks with their different scenes. It took me about 3 hours to get to Harbour Front. The bridges are nice and well kept and there is partly a possibility to take an earth route as well. Ideal to go and experience the stillness of nature here.
,,GORGEOUS,5.0,,"It took us a while to get here but it was a lovely walk, the view was stunning. It's a great place to go for a morning walk or run. It's also a good place to take good pictures or just to spend some quality time with friends or family."
,,Fantastic trail,5.0,,This is one of the best experiences we've had so far in Singapore. We took the metro to Kent Ridge station and walked 10-15 minutes to Kent Ridge Park where we started the trail. It was a cloudy day when we walked the trail but pretty hot anyway so a sunny day is probably to hot for most people. Remember your camera :-) lots beautiful photo spots on the trail.
,,Trekking Heaven,5.0,,I am a Camp Instructor and the best place to trekk is always The southern Ridges as it has the best view of the area and and it is about a 4 mile hike going up. The only advise i have is to bring your water bottle up with you and make sure it is filled up to th brim as there is not much water points that is available in the area.
,,Wonderful Hiking Route,5.0,,"It's definitely a must-go place in Singapore, you can go hiking with your friends on a sunny day and enjoy the gorgeous and beautiful sights of Singapore。 新加坡不容错过的自然景观去处，极佳的徒步路线，可以跟几个好友一起循着南部山脊的来一场说走就走的徒步，你会领略到不一样的美丽风景。"
,,Kent Bridge Park canopy walk and gardens!,4.0,,"Some of the grounds at Kent Bridge Park are very interesting and they offer some great views. There is an abundance of flora and you feel like you're surrounded by fresh air. It's a good way to stroll and take a break from the city. The park offers great sea views, as well as a lot of activities for children.
I would recommend this park to couples and families in particular. It is a very pleasant environment!"
,,Amazing scenic walk,5.0,,"A must do in SIngapore. If you have a car, park at Hort Park car park. You can start your walk from there and you will walk on bridges and walkways with a scenic and panoramic views of part of jungle and city beneath. Beware of monkeys and do not try to touch them. You can walk through 3 parks up to Mount Faber, on the way you can stop to have a look at the Alkaff mansion or even stop to have lunch as this is a very good Italian restaurant. Then you will walk on the Henderson waves which is a long wooden bridge, it is the tallest pedestrian bridge in Singapore. You have a spectacular view of some part of Singapore and the islands. At Mount Faber, you can take the cable car to go to Harbourt front or Sentosa Island. Do not go there and walk on a very hot day as there is no shade on the bridges."
,,Superb Architecture,4.0,,"This place is for those who have a knack of experiencing architecture. The bridge is formed in a way it seems like you're walking on waves. Sunset is the most beautiful from here, however be careful of monkeys on your way."
,,"Great break from the city, with good views and a different perspective onto Singapore",4.0,,"We've been to all five of the parks which make up the Southern Ridges now. In fact It would be a good long walk through four of them, taking a nice day out with a picnic. You can easily link Mount Faber, Telok Blangah, Hort Park, and Kent Ridge, and walk from either end-to-end and back (3-4hrs) or go one way and get a taxi back (you'd need Uber or Grab!). Good views of the harbour, Sentosa, some amazing buildings and the linking bridges and walkways are really good. It's more of a job to link in Labrador on the coast, and this is quite small - OK for jogging around, especially if you want to climb up the steps and run down the road!"
,,Scenic,4.0,,Did a bit of walk from Vivo City all the way to Alexandra Road. It is a nice cool walk. Weather is nice. Not crowded at all. Amazing to be walking on the Tree Top from the Henderson Wave. Also great view from Mt Faber Point and Mt Faber Cable Car Station. Passed by Akkaff Mansion. Took us 2 hours but it was worth it.
,,"Very nice, relaxing walk",4.0,,"The best part of this walk is long distance between treetops. The slope is very gentle, so you can walk either way. One important warning! After finishing walk if you decide to take a bus, make sure you have something to ware before you enter the bus. Because of climate in Singapore you will be sweat and air condition inside the bus will make you feel like in freezer. As the result I have finished in bed with high temperature and still have not recovered. So be careful!"
,,Great way to explore the green side of Singapore,4.0,,"This walk is really great and allows exploring Singapore from a different angle. The whole walk deserves half a day, and the highlights are probably the canopy walk and the hort(icultural) park. There is a great skyline view on both sides of the ridge, but during this walk you will hardly believe Singapore is highly densely populated.
If you like, you may also extend your hike to the Labrador park through a board walk on the seaside."
,,Great walk in the morning,4.0,,It is a great walk for Singapore island . The walk is easy and pretty much cooling if you go early. Advisable to do this either early morning or evening timing .
,,Must-see for nature lovers,5.0,,"If you love nature, it's a must see for you. Scenic trails through forest give rest to your mind and are a great physical exercise still within city. Wear comfortable shoes and plan to give enough time to enjoy this treasure."
,,Great place to wander,4.0,,"We went in Jan. and it is supposed to be the dry season. It rained almost the entire time and it was quite humid. Very long walks but beautiful. You can start and stop along the path, neaning you can make it as long or short as you want. I think there may be bus tours that go through the greenery. Good hike."
,,Something different,5.0,,"As Long as you don't get caught in a tropical rainstorm this is a fantastic walk, varying routes - 30minute to 3 hours walks, not so much wildlife in view but treetops are fantastic. Cooler. Any many things of vegetation interest on route"
,,8 Hour Tropical Hike,5.0,,"This amazing trail leads you through four different parks. I started in the west (Kent Ridge MRT) and did the whole tour: Kent Ridge park - Hort park - Telok Blangah Hill park - Mount Faber park. From there you can exit near Vivocity shopping mall (HarbourFront MRT). It's a long and strenuous hike, roughly 30'000 steps involved, so pack plenty of water and sunscreen. There are several soda machines and restrooms on the way in case you want to recharge. There are also 2 restaurants on the way: Vineyard @HortPark and Faber Bistro @MountFaber.

Dive into the authentic jungle atmosphere of Singapore, enjoy spectacular views over the rainforest and relax near quiet ponds @KentRidge. Then head out into vast experimental and vertical gardens housing several thousand species @HortPark. After that, experience your first tree-top walk @AlexandraGardenTrail and ascend to the top of the rainforest. Then descend through several rice terrace like gardening formations @TelokBlangahHill and get ready for the highlight of the trip: Henderson waves. This wooden masterpiece of architecture is highly photogenic and is also lit in the dark, making it look even more spectacular. This wide trail of wooden planks leads you directly to your final ascend @MountFaber. Here you will be rewarded with excellent views over the city, a face-to-face encounter with the tiny Merlion and can either set over to Sentosa Island via cable car or descend back into the buzzling city. Except for Mount Faber it never gets crowded, making it a very peaceful and relaxing experience all together. It is also very safe and family-friendly, so you should have no trouble maneuvering around with your stroller. If you are lucky, you get to spot some monkeys and monitor lizards in their natural habitat. Highly recommended!"
,,More an urban than a rural walk. Full length and loop to coast,4.0,,"We walked the full length and did the loop at Alexander bridge down to the ""mangrove"" and Labrador reserve and back up to the bridge. Had picnic by the sea. Only 4K extra.
Had a good day five hours slow walking to keep cooler and take photos.
Not very peaceful though, more an urban trail with greenery, Horst park being interesting and very manicured.
When the ""forest trail"" high rise walkway offers ""earth"" it is a chance to get to ground and follow the same route, but with no people and much more bird call. It rejoins the skyway at Alexander bridge, which is also the place to divert downhill to the mangrove. Though that too is a boardwalk."
,,Amazing walk throughout,5.0,,"The Southern Ridges is a whole walking trail stretching from Kent Ridge Park to Mount Faber, over 2 pedestrian bridges namely the Alexander Arch and the Henderson Waves.
The latter is a beautiful undulating boardwalk bridge sloping gently from one end to the other, whereas the other pales in comparison.
The walk amongst the tree tops is along the Forest Trail, from Henderson Rd car park to the Alexander Arch.
All the different sections of the trail are simply wonderful, whether taken in the day or at night.
Not to be missed for nature lovers !"
,,Amazing walk through the rainforest in a city,5.0,,"We did this walk sort of backwards, so that we ended up at Mount Faber. This meant we expended a bit more energy, but it was still an easy walk.
The canopy walk and Henderson Waves are incredible, and the view at the top of Mount Faber is not to be missed! I would advise doing the walk this way round and finishing for a drink at the Faber Bistro (but start after the worst heat of the day around 3pmish?)."
,,"Beautiful, varied walk",5.0,,"Started out from the science park and walked though Hort Park, the bridge offering views of that condo with flats like boxes as well as the colonial bungalows, the beautiful Alexandria Waves (love it), and enjoyed the view of the sea. Like ending up at Vivo City via Mount Faber. Great walk!"
,,Walk amongst the tree tops,4.0,,"Not a jungle trek but you'd need a good amount of energy to walk and explore all of the surrounding are as the walk itself is very long and lead to all directions. You get to hear monkeys and if lucky, see some. Take insect repellent on hot days and lots of drinking water."
,,Good walk in clouded day,4.0,,"Cannot do this walk in hot day!
So start the walk early in the morning or clouded day.

Take full of water/snacks and enjoy the view and nature with many rests.
The path is easy to find although some parts can be broken and doing maintenance.

Not recommend really small/not fit children unless you are well prepared."
,,Different way to experience nature,5.0,,The southern ridges will have a lot of visitors during weekend mornings. It is a good place to have a brisk walk on weekend morning and you will get to be close to nature and do a bit of exercise.
,,A great place for a morning jog or a family day out,5.0,,"The Southern Ridges is a very suitable place for morning walks or jogs, as the boardwalk treads through a serene forest. It is also a great place for families as there are playgrounds and attractions for kids along the way. However, if you choose to visit, do bring along insect repellent as The Southern Ridges is home to many species of insect. Also, exercise caution when bringing any food items along, as The Southern Ridges also houses monkeys, who tend to be aggressive when they encounter people with food."
,,Forest Views,4.0,,Walked up Mt.Faber via steps on Christmas Day morning. Great views of forest and City once at the top. Followed the well marked signs and walked Henderson Waves bridge and onto the Treetop walk along the gantry. Different options for walks. Just so peaceful with birds singing and spotting the odd squirrel here and there. Probably best early to mid morning or early evenings to take advantage of the cooler periods. So pleased we did it.
,,Possibly Best Hiking Trail in Singapore,4.0,,"Singapore is predominantly an urban city. This is probably the closest thing to a hike that you can get in Singapore. Set aside a minimum of 2 hours for the hike itself. Add more time if you will be stopping anywhere.

Suggested things to bring: water, poncho or umbrella (in case of sudden rain), ziplock for your precious phone, and of course money (in case you need to buy food/drinks or give up and take train back!).

As Singapore weather can get rather hot in the late morning, I would suggest starting at around 7 am. Start from the start point beside the motorbike parking lots, in between Seah Im Food Centre and Marang Road. It's on the east (not west) side of the food centre. You can have breakfast at the food centre before the hike, and wash up at the not-so-clean toilets before the hike. This start point is just next to HarbourFront MRT Station.

From there, you hike up a series of steps up Mount Faber to the cable car station. This is the Marang Trail. Then you proceed onto the Faber Trail, with panoramic vies of the Southern Part of Singapore. You end up at Henderson Waves, the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore at 36 metres above Henderson Road.

Crossing Henderson Waves, you end up in Hilltop Walk, then Forest Walk leading to Alexandra Arch. At this place, you have the option of proceeding westwards towards Flora Walk, HortPark, Canopy Walk and eventually Ken Ridge Park. Or you can turn southwards towards the Labrador Nature & Costal Walk. Normally, at Alexandra Arch, I turn back. Time taken for a normal walk is 1 hour to reach Alexandra Arch and another hour for the return trip. Total distance to Alexandra Arch and back is about 9 km.

If you are hungry on your return trip, you can get down from Henderson Waves, move northwards towards Telok Blangah Way and locate this place called SAFRA Mount Faber. You can try local coffee (kopi) and toast at Ya Kun. Or you can soldier on and return back to Seah Im Food Centre to try other local food including Indian Rojak.

Oh I forgot. If you decide to give up at Alexandra Arch, you can navigate southwards to Labrador Park MRT station. Or you can always hail a taxi or Uber from Hort Park!"
,,Highlight,5.0,,"As a frequent visitor of Singapore I'm always looking for new things to do. For some reason, I never did the Southern Ridges hike, nor did I go up Mt. Faber. Big mistake! It was definitely the highlight of my last visit!
The treetop walk is just amazing! You basically walk on top of a jungle, in the middle of a big city. Fascinating! There are not that much people walking in this area, and most people I met seemed to be locals on their lunch break or so.

Highly recommended!"
,,Nice garden / forest,4.0,,It is a nice garden / forest walk. You get to see some exotic trees and birds. Did not see any monkeys or giant lizzards. The whole park is probably more impressive to people living in the city who don't get to see forests that often.
,,Morning walk,3.0,,A good place to do some light hiking or morning exercises. Up to Mount faber's Wave bridge to enjoy a cool breeze! The view on Mt Faber is not that breath taking in my opinion.
,,Very nice walk!,5.0,,Great walk and very nicely designed and hidden among in the concrete jungle all round. Some very good views and lots and lots of green/tropical trees/plants. Very natural. 5/5
,,Fantastic nature walk.,5.0,,"Walking from the top of Mount Faber to Telok Blangah peak along the bridge route will give you an extraordinary experience of feeling high above the Singapore and enjoying the beauty of the jungle covered mountains. This is one incredibly beautiful area. Both mountain tops will give you different views of downtown Singapore and surrounding areas. Both areas will give you a wonderful taste of nature you will not find in many other places in all of Singapore. Make this side trip, and you will always remember this visit."
,,Favourite spot in Singapore!,5.0,,"The Southern Ridges are seldomly in the top 10 of any paper guide, so usually you don't go there if you're only in Singapore for 2-3 days. When I first came to Singapore, this was also true for me. During my second time in Singapore, I stayed half a year and went to the Southern Ridges as often as I could. In my opinion, you see Singapore's most beautiful side on the walk. You see green trees and forest, you see the skyscrapers, the perfect mix for a big city jungle. I can't wait for the next time walking that trail!
By the way: the route is very well paved, I'm always wearing Flipflops :)"
,,Go on a sunday,5.0,,"We took the SMRT to Kent ridge station and followed the signs not to Kent Ridge Rd which goes to a Uni residence village but up Buona vista rd. You can take a bus from the station up a few stops if you want, but don't miss the start of the walk which is a little uphill road on the left. We walked all the way to the cable car station but decided to just walk downhill to vivocity shopping centre ( with the Harbourfront SMRT station). Along the walk there are a few rest stops with vending machines selling cold drinks. Go on a Sunday for entry to the very special Bukit Chandu war museum ( free in December) between Kent Ridge and Horts Park."
,,The Southern Ridges,4.0,,Nice place for a walk. Conveniently located and also easily accessible by MRT. Very well-designed and well maintained.
,,Nice park - worth a visit,4.0,,A very nice and big park within a city of skyscrapers. Easyly to walk by feet and you can choose short rounds or longer ones. We spent ca. 3 hrs walking there. As so much in Singapore the park is in an excellent condition.
,,nice walk,4.0,,Went on the Southern Ridges walk for the second time and this time went all the way from Harbour Front to Science Park. Take exit D from Harbour Front MRT and walk up the Marang Trail which will get you to the to of Mt Faber for great views. The Henderson Waves are just a quick walk from there. Continue on to the Forest walk. At the Alexandra arch you can turn left down the street to the next MRT station at Labrador park or continue on to Hort park and Kent Ridges. The Canopy walk is nice too. The walk ends at the science park where you can catch a bus (92) to Kent Ridges (circle line) or Buena Vista (green line).
,,Escape the city.,5.0,,"Wanted something different to do in Singapore so headed out to the Southern Ridges. Turned out to be a great walk! I started from Kent Ridge Park and walked all the way to the Mt Fabre cable car station. Not a difficult walk, but there are a few stairs. Walk through the jungle and take in the sounds and smells of nature. Didn't see any wildlife though other than squirrels."
,,beautiful landscape,5.0,,"we got to this place at noon its been too hot so dont make our mistake and keep in mind to go in the afternoon or in early morning its really worth it , Henderson waves bridge is so amazing to see and walk and a great place to take some photos , this walkway is about 274 m long and conects blangah hill to the mount faber so u can visit all in there"
,,Amazing Walkway!,5.0,,I LOVED THIS PLACE! The views were great and the walkway was so high up you could touch the tops of the trees. Not touristy as I hardly saw any tourists in the area. It will require you sometime to finish the path especially if you are not a physically fit person (like me). Its unlike any other place I've seen in Singapore.
,,Worth the climb,3.0,,"We caught the train to Sentosa Island station and then asked for directions. The girl at the information desk did not know what we were talking about.
Walked to the base of the Mt Faber and walked up from there. Steeps, lots of steps but cooler under the canopy. Just like walking through a jungle, so thick are the plants. Hard walk but the views were so worth it.
We continued to the cable car, where we refused to pay $29 each to catch it back to the train station. So we walked back down.
We didn't continue to Henderson Waves because the map indicated there was no bus or anything to bring us back to the train station.
Signage could be improved.
Do this in the morning before it gets too hot."
,,Beautiful - and you may even see monkeys!,5.0,,"We started our walk at harbour front rather than from the mount faber cable car. there was no sign post to start the walk and when I asked a policeman he looked at me in horror and suggested we get a cab to the top of Mount Faber. Hah! then he pointed us to a set of steep steps with a sign warning us to watch out for monkeys. It was a charming climb up a path that was festooned with vines and a bit unkempt - quite unlike Singapore - very charming. We didnt see monkeys but had a great climb to the top of mount faber, we continued the walk that at times had the most amazing views of singapore through the board walk to Labrador Park via Hort Park. it was definitely worth the sweat and at times slog in the heat (there were people jogging!!). Tip - take water and snacks - the only drink places were vending machines and they were not very frequent. We hailed a taxi at Hort Park to take us back to the hotel."
,,Scenic and quite,5.0,,Great place to have nice scenic peaceful walk and worKout at the same time . Plenty of green and tranquility
,,"Sing, Dance or Whistle along the Southern Ridges",5.0,,"A truly amazing stretch of overhead metal bridge, forest trails and brick steps in the hills at the Southern tip of mainland Singapore. Take the trip with family or friends and you will not regret it. Wear casual, like tshirt/shorts with canvas shoes. Bring along your bottle water but never forget the camera as you will surely want to snap away, not just for your memory bank but also to share with others. Sheer beauty and a refreshing experience. Start at Mount Faber, Hort Park or even at Kent Ridge. The choice is yours :)"
,,Once to hiking at Natural of southern....,5.0,,"Usually visitor to Singapore is shopping and eating. But this time we made it different!
We took MRT to Harbour Front Station - Marang Trail - Cable Car Station - Faber Point - Henderson Waves - Forest Walk - Alexandra Arch - by bus back to Harbour Front Station. All of these hiking roads are under natural and we can always see green plants. Also we can see famous art of Henderson Waves is special and beautiful. We like it very much and recommend you go to see it."
,,Amazing walk from the hustle and bustle of the city,5.0,,"A great walk especially during the sunset. Amazing view and easier accessible. Get off at harbour front MRT and short walk from the station. Do take insect repellent with you as the walk takes you through the forest.

To complete the whole journey would take about 2 hours so do take a bottle of water with you, or bring some coins with you. There are vending machines at spit-stops."
,,Head west to east for more downhill!,5.0,,"A fantastic walk bringing together lots of lovely park areas. Start at Harbourtown MRT station and walk up Mt Faber. It was my first day in Singapore and I kept being showered by water from earlier rain....and looked up to see lots of squirrels in the canopy - lovely! The only busy area of my walk was Mt Faber (which was full of tourists admiring the views). For most of the walk it was nice and solitary (I did it on a week day). If you choose to only do a part of the walk, make sure it includes Henderson Waves and the amazing canopy forest walk - real highlights! And if you have the time, meander through the delightful Hort Park which includes mini gardens of different types and is full of birds, butterflies and lizards. I finished at Kent Ridge Park and walked down to Pepys Rd to Pasir Panjang MRT station to get back into the city. Give yourself at least 2 hours to meander. And remember to take plenty of water (and coins to access the drink machines along the way)."
,,Another side of Singapore,4.0,,"If you have too much malls and want to see some green area, you should try this treeking path. You could start from Mount Faber Park, which could be reach by MRT. Just go to Harbour Frount MRT station, and turn left when you exit.
This not so much like a real mountain or forest...but you could see a lot of green area...
Nice for having a walking or jogging in the morning ...or near sunset."
,,"Morning walks, great views",4.0,,"The Southern Ridges links to Henderson Waves, Mount Faber Park, and Telok Blangah Hill Park, If you walk the whole trail, you will experience both urban and nature coming together in various sections of the trail. Best to start in the morning. If it gets too warm, there are rest stops along the way for you to rest your tired feet and get some shelter."
,,Tiring but worth it,5.0,,"If you're worried about piling on the calories while enjoying the many local delicacies, you can spend half a day exploring the Southern Ridges. It is about a 1-hr trek to Henderson Wave Bridge and another 45mins up to Mount Faber from there. It is mostly an uphill climb so you really work your legs out. You also get to enjoy the lush greenery that nature has to offer. There may be some animals you encounter along the way like chickens, I didn't see any monkeys though I heard there are some."
,,Probably better views on a dry day!,4.0,,"Really great walk thoroughly enjoyed it even if we did get absolutely saturated by the rain. The views we could see we're really good so would only be better in good weather. Was nice being up in the treeline on a well maintained and designed walk way. For something different I would strongly recommend it to everyone.
Hortpark to Mt Fabre is a lovely easy walk crossing some interesting bridges on the way."
,,Great weekend trek,5.0,,Trekked from Hort Park to Mt Faber. It was a trek filled with interesting flora and fauna. The routes are generally flat and easy so it is great for both newbies and experienced trekkers.
,,Pleasant walk,4.0,,"Walked this trail from Harbour Front MRT to Kent Ridge MRT. It is a series of walks which together make up the Southern Ridges walk. It is listed as a 3 to 5 hour walk, we took less than 3 hours - probably due to the fact that we did not spend much time looking at the gardens in Hort Park. It is an easy walk and quite pleasant to be amongst the greenery with some nice views along the way. It is well sign posted except at the Kent Ridge end where we had to ask passersby for directions to Science Park Drive to then access the MRT. We used maps and information downloaded from the National Parks (Singapore) website and I would recommend you do this before you go. I would not say this is a must do acitivity but if you are in Singapore for more than a few days, then the outing would be worthwhile."
,,Scenis and quiet walk,4.0,,"Walked from Hort Park to the top of Mount Faber. Best done around 5 to 5.30 pm as it takes slightly more than an hour based on a casual walking pace. Mid way, if lucky, you will go through harmless mini flies which is an experience we do not really get in Singapore."
,,My fav nature walk in Singapore,5.0,,"This place is a long endless nature walk. I especially enjoy that is it relatively quiet on the weekends, and you get a spot of nature amidst the concrete jungle. Take a hat, sunnies and lots of water as it gets hard to buy water along the way (save for random vending machines that pop up now and then) and enjoy the greenery :)"
,,Great way to spend a few hours - practical tips,4.0,,"As a tourist in Singapore I had some trouble organizing my walk through the Southern Ridges Walk so I wanted to give tourists some advice. In fact, the ""walk"" is a grouping of several different walks so when I asked the concierge at my hotel and my taxi driver neither was really sure where I wanted to go and it was difficult for me to understand where I should start this walk.
I decided to take a taxi from my hotel to Hort Park. This was a good choice. When I told the driver I wanted to go to the Southern Ridges Walk he didn't know what that was, but just inside the turnoff into Hort Park I spotted the walkway on the left hand side. Once on the walk everything is very well indicated. I walked towards Henderson Waves on the Forest Walk, which is a walkway high in the air above the tropical forest. Very nice walk and I seemed to be going in the same direction as nearly everyone else. I would highly recommend starting at this point because there were no taxis - or anything else - where I joined the walk so I don't think it is a good place to end the walk. That said, I did not see what was in the other direction from Hort Park - unfortunately, because I couldn't find clear directions about how to do this walk.
After Henderson Waves I continued to Mt. Faber. There was one crosswalk with no directions - the only one of the trip - but keep going upwards until you get to Mt. Faber. From there I decided to take the cable car down. This was quite expensive at SGD29 (actually an obligatory round trip, but I didn't use the return) because very few people take the cable car only to get to Harbour Front and most go on to the entertainment area Sentosa. However, it was a nice ride town. I decided to take it because from the top the walk down did not appear too appealing given that there is a highway separating the Harbour Front from the mountain, but I could see during the cable car ride that in fact the path down looked quite nice and there is an easy way to pass under the highway. So I wouldn't hesitate going either with the cable car or walking.
Getting down from the cable car at Harbour Front means getting off on the 15th floor of a building through which the cable car passes! You take the elevator down and then walk through the cruise ship terminal (clearly indicated) to Vivo City. Vivo City is yet another mall along the water and it a nice place to end your walk because it is full of restaurants (including a Jamie Oliver Italian restaurant) and cafés.
From Vivo City you can take either a taxi or the MRT (métro) so it's very easy to get back to wherever you're going.
The walk itself took me 1 hr and I wasn't hurrying and stopped several times along the way. However, I was by myself so undoubtedly going faster than if you're talking with someone. From Henderson Waves to Mt. Faber walking traffic seemed to be going in both directions. The walk is very easy - not strenuous - and in either direction you will have ascents and descents."
,,A surprisingly long trail,5.0,,"We loved walking this trail, much of it was on elevated walkways with stunning views and it was well signposted until we got to the last park where it was unclear where to go."
,,Awesome Walk !,5.0,,"I walked from Henderson Waves to Holt Park. It was great. I loved being up on the metal walkway. It's flat and easy walking. It was long and hot, but the views were good with an occasional breeze up high. Try it in the morning for cooler temperatures and bring a lot of water."
,,Quiet and peaceful,5.0,,"Do the walk only if you have time, it is not a ""must see"". Can get very hot with little shade in places. Not many places to get a drink either so make sure you have water. Very gentle walk. We enjoyed it because not many people do it and it's nice to escape the crowds and just wonder through the trees. We walk away from the city and caught the bus & metro back. Singapore is good for retaining such green areas within the city limits."
,,Lovely walk in the treetops,5.0,,"We started our walk from Mt. Faber, heading to the Henderson Waves Bridge and on across the awesome Forest Trail walk. Most of the way was downhill, and the hot sun was broken up by frequent shady spots. Really a lovely walk, even for us old folks."
,,walk with views,5.0,,"Its so cool and accessible from public transport, great view of city and mrt at the end of trail , super convenient."
,,Beautiful scenery good for a walk,5.0,,"The southern ridges are good for Long walks. Starting from the TOP of a ridge, the path leads you across the helix bridge. It's beautiful to see the nature at its best. Start from the Harbour front interchange and then walk your way past the elevated path way."
,,Stunning walk,5.0,,"Start at 'Hort Park' and walk the overhead gantries all the way to Henderson waves. The bridge there is amazing. It's got the best views of the 'reflections' building, which in itself is stunning. Then continue to the top of Mt. Faber for a drink at the bar on the summit or walk down the steps to vivo city for a great choice of restaurants and bars.
The walk takes just over an hour, bring water and a camera."
,,amazing walk,5.0,,"we did this walk with our little boy on the sling and our 4 yo girl. It was a good way to discover this unusual part of green Singapore. Recommended, not turisty."
,,Great for a walk with friends...but hot!,4.0,,"I love walking here with friends. The terrain is mixed and you get a feel for the green belt of Singapore,"
,,"Stunning Par, City and Even Ocean Views",5.0,,The trails and bridges in the Southern Ridges are special and a must to visit if in Singapore. I particularly like the Henderson Waves with the stunning architecture and awesome views. Be sure to bring along plenty of water. There a few beverage dispensing machines on the trails but remember to bring Sing Coins or $2 bills otherwise there really is no place to get a drink.
,,MUST DO,5.0,,"MUST DO perfect place for relaxation especially in the weekdays, Sundays quite busy, above the trees walking forest is really nice to see, completely relaxed returned home"
,,Not as good as expected,4.0,,"Henderson waves are very nice to walk in and I'd recommend to visit for that. The rest of the visit is ok, I was expecting more 'nature'. Still good for a sunday morning."
,,Perfect nature walk...!!!,5.0,,We started trekking right across vivo city and walk along the park to reach the Southern Ridges. Total distance is 12-14 km. It would be better to start the trail early morning or evenings. Bring a bottle of water to keep hydrated as well. There is a small museum which has a show describing how the Japanese conquered Singapore during the WWII
,,Walk with good views,3.0,,Great walk with some good views out. Also good to see how some of Singapore was. Need to be reasonably fit.
,,A (somewhat) hidden gem!,5.0,,"Almost any outdoor attraction in Singapore has fewer locals milling around than a shopping centre, food court, or hawker centre. The privacy of walking in the Southern Ridges is enhanced by the fact that it is relatively secluded and unknown (compared to say the walks around MacRitchie Reservoir).

And - guess what - it is surprisingly COOL! Shaded most of the way and high enough u to catch breezes.
There's not a lot to see until you get to Mt Faber but that, in itself, is a luxury... you can walk for an hour or two in Singapore and barely hear any traffic, only meet another person occasionally, and see very few high rise buildings! And breathe clean forest air (especially after rain)."
,,Loved It,5.0,,"Walked this trail 5 times. And I enjoyed every minute of it every time. Following the Marang Trail lead you to the top of Mount Faber - one of the highest point of Singapore. Great view of the South Coast. The bridge that weave through the Telok Blangah Forest gave us a chance to enjoy the trees from a high point.
After Hort Park, there is a small museum which has a show describing how the Japanese conquered Singapore during the WWII.

The entire trail took about 2 hours. It would have been perfect if it was not too hot. If you do not like too much sun, would be better to start the trail early morning or evenings. Bring a bottle of water to keep hydrated as well."
,,Good walk to see the nature inside the city,4.0,,"Another hiking place in Singapore. I started trekking right across vivo city and walk along the park to reach the Southern Ridges. Total distance is 12-14 km. Some people are not comfortable with the steel bridges - made them dizzy. I found it's quite nice and interesting place. You can experience the tree-top-walk in MacRitchie but this place will give you another opportunity to explore the trees.
I start the walk from 6:30 or 7:00AM until 10:00 or 10:30AM. Then, I can have big brush without feel guilty :)
Don't miss it once you live in Singapore for a week. You will love Singapore more."
,,Wonderful Walk,5.0,,"Stunning experience in the middle of a major city
Pack your drinks, take the MRT and start at Mount Faber Park or the other way around.

Great views in those wonderful parks connected via stunning bridges and walkways.
No tourists crowds, no expensive admissions, far away from the stress of the city"
,,Afternoon Delight!,4.0,,"The Southern Ridges is an interconnected system of four parks: Kent Ridge Park, Hort Park, Telok Blangah Hill Park and Mount Faber Park. Get off at Labrador Park MRT and walk up Alexander Rd. The greenery amidst a major city completely surprised me. There is a fair chance of seeing tropical birds and, yes, some spiders of the bigger kind. If you have seen enough buildings, museums and temples go there! Henderson Waves is great, not only as a viewing point but also the construction as such: Between 60 and 70 meters above sea level... If your are prepared to spent some three hours walking you can end up at Vivo City: Either for shopping or the MRT back to your hotel."
,,Morning Sunrise,5.0,,Excellent place for the morning walk or runs around this southern ridge. A place to visit anytime with family and friends. This place is very well connected and has good directional signs to direct you to mount Faber and also all the way to National University Singapore.
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,We saw the Henderson waves on our local map however on most maps the location is not on them.Go find them the waves are stunning
,,Nice day walk,4.0,,"The walk itself is really nice, whenever in Singapore definitely go for it! To bad that it's not a loop, i thought it was, but then you just have to walk next to the highway, no problem walked to the mrt at labrador and took it back."
,,Amazing run,5.0,,"I like to go for a run whenever I'm travelling as it allows me to see places that I would otherwise not go and/or a lot more of somewhere. This was a recommended run and it was absolutely amazing. Mainly high off the ground through the trees, this is an urban oasis outside of Singapore's skyscrapers, with amazing views and gorgeous nature."
,,Great way to get off the beaten path and see a different side of Singapore,5.0,,"I never would have done this trip on my own, but so glad I did. My friend who recently moved to Singapore introduced me. It's a 10 k walk thru multiple parks and sky bridges they the trees. Beautiful views of Singapore. Perfect photo op places. No time limit and great exercise. Be prepared to sweat and take lots of water with you on the hike."
,,See a different side of Singapore,5.0,,"A refreshing 10km walk although you can stop at several points along the walk if you wish. Start early in the morning, bring sunshade and sunblock to protect yourself, plenty of drinking water to keep hydrated and binoculars to spot the birds and you are set for an interesting morning. The route is well marked and maintained. You do need to be reasonably fit as there are a lot of stairs to climb up and down."
,,Nice & Safe Trail,5.0,,"Started at 10am from Menang trail at HarbourFront and took about 2hrs to finish off. At Kent Ridge. Plenty of nature to see and the trail was very well designed and maintained. If u start at Manang, u would need to climb a fair bit of steps. It'll be less strain on your muscles if u start at Hort Park so when u end at Menang trail, you are walking down the steps instead. Go early cos it can get hot and drink plenty of water. It's a trail that's suitable for the young and old."
,,Greening Singapore,4.0,,"The Southern Ridges is a 10 km chain of tropical parks and forests connecting Singapore's Mount Faber, Telok Blangah Hill Park, Hort Park, Kent Ridge Park and Labrador Nature Reserve.

The whole chain is of immense value in the greening of Singapore, and is popular with nature lovers, bird watchers, history lovers, and walking enthusiasts.

Along the way there are observation points overlooking parts of the City, out to sea, and along rain forest canopies.

If you are really keen you can walk the whole chain in one go, but most people do a section at a time."
,,Very nice walks through the city jungle,4.0,,"We joined the trail at Alexandra arch and had a nice afternoon walking through the canopy on the Forest Walk, and enjoying the spectacular Henderson waves and parks all the way to Mt Faber.

We worth the time and effort to do this, and recommended to see a different side of Singapore with some great views thrown in."
,,Good place to watch birds,5.0,,Nice paved walkway in between trees and very good for jogging and bird watching. Make sure you have sunscreen with you as not many tree shades along the walk.
,,Well-maintained brisk walking/small hiking trail,5.0,,"This is a great way to traverse across the western side of Singapore. The trail is very well-maintained with many folks exercising during the weekends, and it takes you through the forested areas of the west part of Singapore. As with any other trail, please make sure to wear a hat and plenty of sunscreen. Bring lots of water too, because I don't remember seeing a convenient place to stop and get water (Though resting spots are aplenty)."
,,Nice walks,3.0,,Nice to spend some time there. You can escape the city noises a little bit. You can reach the cable cars from here.The touristic buses make it a little bit too crowded though.
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"Easy to walk, don't need special shoes or worry about uneven paths. Very clean and well laid out. You can connect to a few spots from here. Be sure to bring water, sunblock and mosquito repellent. Also something to shade you from the sun, maybe a cap or wide brimmed hat. Best to go in the early mornings, cooler."
,,Great walk and good views throughout,4.0,,"We did the whole walk late last year and really enjoyed it. Plenty of nice scenery and wildlife to see. You do need to be ok with heights as there are several high bridges and suspended walkways. Make sure you take lots of water, sun cream and bug spray. Good to end of vivocity and grab a snack and a cold drink too. Stay away from the monkeys if u see them."
,,A lovely walk,5.0,,Ensure you get off the correct MRT stop when visiting this as we didn't so ended up going far out of the way. When we eventually reached the correct area we thoroughly enjoyed the walk through the treetop walkway. Take a spare top though as the humidity is high in December and you will sweat buckets during this walk. We walked all the way to the Cable Car station and caught a taxi back to Orchard from there. The views are really good.
,,Good exercise & enjoyable outing close to nature!,5.0,,"We walked from Alexander Arch, passed through Henderson Wave and continued walking to Mt Faber. Took us about 2.5 hours walking with 5 kids with us ranging from 5-11 years old. We took our time to walk and enjoy the view. Plenty of resting spots along the way. We had lunch at Spuds & Aprons and took the cable car down to Harbourfront. Great exercise for everyone and the air was clear of smoke, traffic fumes etc. I think Spore government has done a great job incorporating nature trails like this in the midst of all the skyscrapers and hustle and bustle of the city!"
,,Peaceful and scenic,5.0,,"I cannot believe that there is such a lovely hike/trail area in SIngapore! You will really feel close to nature. The park is well maintained even though some paths are in between tall trees. Simple exercise facilities are scattered all throughout as well as benches and viewing decks. Best of all, the attraction is free. I struggled a bit to find the place but for those who take the MRT like me, alight at Harbourfront station and go to Exit D. You will find yourself entering the Marang trail. Properly labeled paths and street signs help you navigate through this massive park. If you have enough energy, you will find yourself on the other end - near Kent Ridge. Make sure to use sunscreen, wear comfortable shoes and clothes, and bring water."
,,My favorite outing route,5.0,,Walking from the back of science park drive through horpark then climbed up the path or these bridges on top of these forest trees is a unique experience all the way to Henderson wave and then onto mount farber park before heading down to harborfront MRT station to head home. It took a few hours of sweat but was manageable. A group of us of approx 30 people started at 9 and then end at noon. Horpark is a good stopping point halfway.
,,"a calm, peaceful place to go!",5.0,,"The walk is amazing, tranquil and gives you a chance to stroll and admire green spaces in Singapore. Didn't see any monkeys though (a good tip is to refrain from noise pollution, such as speaking loudly or blasting music), but there were quite a few infographics on bird species found (excellent for bird watchers) where I had walked which is really helpful since you could hear and see them every now and then."
,,Nice for a weekend hike.,5.0,,"If you are looking for a nice weekend getaway, this is one of the best places to do so. You get to have a view of southern Singapore, while experiencing nature. Defintely a must-visit destination."
,,Easy to walk,5.0,,The route is very well maintained and lit so we are able to walk there at night without any problems.
,,Highly recommended city walking trail,5.0,,"I recently trekked the Dragon's Back in Hong Kong and the Southern Ridges walking trail is absolutely better. There is a lot of useful information found in NPark website. I started early morning from Kent Ridge Park, walking towards Hort Park, across Alexandra Arch, through Telok Blangah Hill Park, crossed the excellent Henderson Waves & to Mount Faber Park. We then walked down Marang Trail and back up again to back-track to Alexandra Arch. We then walked to Labrador Park and back to Hort Park where we continued back to visit the Reflections at Bukit Chandu (and to cool off).
The walking trail is in excellent condition with useful signposts, informative maps, clean functional toilets and interesting views.
The disappointing features are Alkaff Mansion and almost the entire Labrador Park. The museum Reflections at Bukit Chandu is small and has too little interesting exhibit. These low points are too minor to overshadow the overall excellence of the Southern Ridges.
A few tips - bring water, hat, small umbrella; extra clothing to change. There is a mall along Alexandra Road on the way to Labrador Park where you can buy cheap bottled water or patronise the restaurants there. At the start of Marang Trail, there is the cheap Seah Im hawker centre or across the road to the mall, Vivocity."
,,Great nature workout,5.0,,Looking for a workout and a view to enjoy. This is the perfect blend to give you both on a morning. Also enjoy the time with squirrels and local birds. Great walk.
,,Architectural Bridge,4.0,,Great for some different views of Singapore. You can catch the cable car to Sentosa from here. The bridge was nice to walk across more locals than tourists.
,,A lovely walk,4.0,,"One of the few place sin Singapore where you feel you are at least somewhat near nature. not the greatest walk I've done but so well put together, safe and perfectly maintained."
,,Wild Side in the City,5.0,,"If you don't like walking, I don't even know why you're reading about the Southern Ridges. This is for people (like myself) who love to get lost in the trees and unmanicured pockets of wild areas in Singapore. But trampling on the grounds does disturb the animals so this is a great place to walk because of the elevated bridges which are engineered for easy access and maintenance as well as eco-friendly to the vegetation below."
,,Walk on trees!,5.0,,"I went there 3 times...first time i went with friends...second time i went there with my mom...3rd time with my entire my family.
This place is not only attraction of Singapore...its a good place for morning or evening brisk walk..You can see many trees,birds life...some times monkey too..its a forest in the heart of city,...So you can get a different feel of it.. no fees to enter...very nice place...but nothing to eat there...so better buy something prior to your trip.."
,,👍,5.0,,"Wow, wow and wow. It was a real pleasure to walk across the track and enjoy staying on the same level with trees tips. The trip took me a couple of hours. It is definitely the place i would like to return from time to time."
,,Lovely stroll away from the crowd,4.0,,You will find plenty of green and tranquility when you walk along the Southern Ridges of Singapore. Some of the architecture such as bridges across highways and skywalks above the treetops is world class
,,Walking Trail above the trees,5.0,,A great relaxing walk on a hot afternoon is the most ideal way of enjoying it as you don't feel the heat while nature watching :)
,,A long walk with so much to see.,5.0,,"If you like to walk, the Southern Ridges series of connected walks (parks) is a beautiful experience. The walks are all well marked and easy to follow. You can break from the walk at many points if you get tired. Start at the National University of Singapore and wend your way to the top of Kent Ridge Park. The path rises to a lovely panorama looking south over the coast. Take the elevated Canopy Walk (~16m) to the top of Pepys Road. Cross the road and visit Reflections at Bukit Chandu a World War II museum. Small but interesting and housed in an old colonial Black & White house. You are on the former Opium Hill where the old opium factory buildings still sit at the bottom of Pepys Rd. Take the path down to Hort Park where there are lots of birds, flowers and displays. (A diversion here to see the Black and White houses in Alexandra Park is worth the effort.) The path leads to Alexandra Arch and the start of the elevated walkway ( ~18m). The walkway brushes the tops of trees and takes you through Telok Blangah Hill Park and down to Henderson Waves which is a bridge to Mount Faber Park. This wave-like construction has breathtaking views from an elevation of about ~36m. Its eerie. The cable car station awaits your climb to the top of Mount Faber. From there you can take the cable car down and to Sentosa Island. If not, take the path down to the bottom where Vivo City Mall offers a myriad of food choices for lunch. About 12 to 15km depending on what you do. Take lots of water."
,,National Day!,4.0,,"It was an early 9 August!

Planned a last minute trekking to The Southern Ridges of Singapore, knowing the majority of the places would be crowded.

A morning work out with the nature was taxing at first as not much training was done before that. But having someone who know abit more on the direction plays a major part too. Spent the first half of the day trekking from Henderson Waves, through Forest and Canopy Walk and to Hortpark, last stop at Kent Ridge Park. It was quite a tough one as I grew blister on my toes along the way.

Exited at Kent Ridge Park and walked to the bus stop nearby. Unknowing we sat there for almost 10 minutes and realised that there will not be any bus service on Sundays and Public Holidays. So we walked for about 15 minutes more and finally we saw Kent Ridge MRT Station.

Trekers to note:
Do bring enough water as there is limited water cooler stops for you to refill your water
Wearing a good pair of shoes is a MUST
Do not carry heavy

A good burn out I had!

Cheers,
Jazlyn"
,,A good walk,5.0,,"You know you've had a good walk when you go from Hort Park to Mount Faber, and it's probably going to be hot, but there are stunning views and it's a good way to spend an afternoon. Probably not for this who want a gentle stroll, but we had a family group with a young baby in a stroller, and it was beautiful and good exercise. Just don't be in a hurry."
,,Nice walk on weekend,4.0,,If you have been living in Singapore and happen to have a free sunny day to kill. The Southern ridges are a great to kill time with. The road are diverse and the views are beautiful. The hike itself is easy but be prepared for the heat and bring a lot of water.
,,A really great walk or run in nature to escape the city,5.0,,"This is one of my favorite weekend runs in Singapore. Very nice views from many angles.

You can take the whole course - start from the entrance to Mt. Faber and make your way all the way to Hort park and Kent Ridge. It's about 5km and a very nice afternoon course."
,,Great city hiking,5.0,,"Well maintained, if not particularly well signed, paths in lush nature. Henderson walk is very cool. Trails cover many kilometers so plan accordingly."
,,Perfect for Early Morning & Strolls at Dusk,5.0,,"Ideal for early morning and evening strolls all the way across the well-crafted wooden corridors overhanging the canopy of tall trees after parking one's cars at the car parks at the Peak via South Bona Vista Road ! The air is fresh and breezy, and the view of the City and seafront etc., is just too spectacular to be ignored."
,,Great Way to Spend Afternoon,5.0,,Very well-designed walking park. The parks are connected together and offer amazing views from the elevated walkway.
,,walking in the clouds,5.0,,we were here a beatyfull day warm soo take a lot of wather but it was fantastik to walk in the air in the treetopps i lost a fju kg
,,Allocate at least half a day,5.0,,"We did some of this walk after a day at sentosa. Our plan was to start at Hort Park and walk east to Mt Faber. We caught the MRT to Pasir Panjang and walked up Pepys Rd to Hort Park and turned right at what we thought was the right spot but alas it was the wrong way and somehow we ended up heading west, anyway if you try this way don't head through the treetops, head down to the nursery. It would have been nice to see a lot of the park in daylight as there looks like there is much to see. It is a beautiful way to spend a few hours, take some water!"
,,ALONE SURROUNDED BY NATURE,4.0,,"Highly recommended to see the different side of Singapore.

Easy trek with good indication and map, best to go on week days and bring a lot of water as the sun can really drain our energy. There is no place to buy lunch/ food therefore it is advisable to bring light sandwich or fruit as it can be a very long walk however enjoyable.

Getting there is very easy:

Marang Trail (leading To Mount Faber) - this is where I started.
By MRT: alight at Harbourfront station Exit D.

By Bus: take bus service number 10, 30, 57, 61, 65, 80, 93, 97, 100, 131, 143, 145, 161, 300, 646 or 855 alight at bus stop in front of Seah Im Food Center at Telok Blangah Road"
,,Very good walk in Singapore,5.0,,"We have visited Singapore many times and we were looking to do something slightly different and found this idea via a newspaper review. It was quite hot on the day that we did the walk especially as we went in the middle of the day. However there is a fair bit of shade and plenty of places to stop to get a cold drink. The views were great and we will do this again in the evening, or at least part of it when we are next in Singapore.

It is very interesting to enter a forest environment directly from a city car park and immediately see an enormous lizard. Hardly any people - very peaceful and great views,"
,,Great photo spot coupled with a leisure walk!,5.0,,"Highly recommended for trekkers who wish to go on a leisure one.. terrain is easy and if you start from Hort Park, it should take you less than 3 hours to complete (included lots of photo taking at the southern ridges and also some rest points)"
,,relaxing walk with nice view over singapore,5.0,,"Not as far as MacRicthie, and less tiring, the southern ridges is a nice walk to have on sunday in Singapore. it also offer very nice panorama over the city !"
,,The Southern RIdges,2.0,,"This is basically just a typical hiking trails for those who like outdoor nature hike in an urban nation. Nothing much to shout about, just simple trees, and tracks/trails, and that's basically about it. A bit disappointed with a keen hiker like myself."
,,Nice walk close to City,4.0,,"A nicehike that will take a good three hours of walking. Take MRT to the HarbourFront station. Look for Marang Trail which is a path (steps) that takes you up a relatively steep hill all the way to Mt. Faber Park where the cable car ride starts. After taking in the view, continue and follow Mt. Faber Loop heading to Henderson Wave which is a wonderful bridge. Continue on the path till you get to the forest walk - a nice steel walkway on stilts will multiple scenic viewpoints. However, there is virtually no shade on the forest walk. The path finally ends after reaching Alexandra Arch and our Hotel concierge suggested walking towards Labrador Park MRT station. We opted to continue towards HortPark - a public garden with many interesting miniature gardens."
,,Itching for a nature walk in Singapore?,5.0,,"This is a great walk to burn off a bit of energy, walk in the tree tops, see and hear birds, squirrels and insects and see the city of Singapore around you then try this walk. You can make it as short or as long as you want. I went from Mount Faber to Kent Ridge starting at 7.30am missing the heat. It is also disable friendly so anyone with mobility issues don't be put off there are ramps every where. I highly recommend this walk"
,,Great View and Walk,5.0,,The Southern Ridges offers one of the best views and a great workout suitable for both young and old.
,,It needs a mild day and patience,3.0,,"I walked some of it and quite enjoyed. I have to say this little country have done well in creating new landscape and preserving the nature. I would recommend a half day trip to walk it all, along with some capable good friends."
,,Good trail!,5.0,,"If you start from Harbor Front (Marang Trail), the walk from the Southern Ridges to the Alexandra Arch is extremely relaxing. I've done this trail many times, and I usually start from the Marang Trail where there's a lot of stairs! So once I reach the Southern Ridges, I find it extremely relaxing to walk on smooth ground 60 - 70m above sea level. I've done both in the morning and night, and I can say for sure that the Alexandra Arch is the most relaxing and my favorite part of the walk. Definitely recommend this to people who like walking/nature!"
,,Great hike! If you need to burn off some energy and get some nice views,5.0,,"I did this in reverse from the usual. I took the MRT to Kent Ridge and walked back to the Henderson Wave. It is a little more difficult as the signs are more for people doing it from Mt. Fabre and going back to Kent Ridge.

You get off at exit B at Kent Ridge and walk along Science Drive. The hardest part is finding the entrance to the park! There is NO signage at all, but once you get into the park there are signs everywhere. So just walk along Science Drive until you pass a Starbucks. It isn't too much further after that, right after a small bridge.

The Kent Ridge section is actually the most natural and you get some good views over the harbor.

The Canopy walk is nice but really not all that exciting.

Then you connect to Hort Park which is mildly interesting. You could spend a lot of time there but for the walker, it is a pass thru really. You can walk through that a myriad of ways and there are maps everywhere. After you exit it is a very short walk to the bridge of Alexandra Road. It is a unique bridge similar to one down on Robertson Quay.

After that you will walk on a metal pathway to the top of Telok Blangah Hill. Again... Some nice views along the way and it is similar to the Canopy Walk.

At the end you will be in Telok Blangah and you can walk up a steep hill to a viewpoint over Singapore. It is quite nice. If you don't feel like it, you can go around it to the left or right.

You will also pass an old mansion (now high end restaurant) which is quite lovely from the outside.

Finally you will arrive at the Henderson Wave bridge. It offers quite nice views and the architecture is stunning. It is better viewed from afar to the get the full effect though.

At the end you walk through Mt Faber park which is a well establish and old park in Singapore. You can take the cable car or just walk down the Marang path to Harbourfront and Vivo City.

The plus side of doing the walk in the reverse is that you END with a lot of places to eat and drink. If you start at Mt Faber you will only have a Starbucks near the end.

There are a lot of stairs and you should be in reasonable condition. I did whole thing in sandals, no problem.

Take an umbrella because although there are rain shelters along the way, there are some areas with none, so if you get caught in a downpour, you will get VERY wet.

Highly recommended as an antidote to all the mall shopping and eating in modern Singapore."
,,Something different from the normal attractions....,4.0,,"For those who loves nature & something different, this place is highly recommended.

However be prepared for a long walk in the open. Its very hot & very humid in Singapore. Try to come in the morning where its cooler.

Wear cool clothings & comfort shoes. Put on a cap or hat. And a sunglass to protect from the heat & reduce glare. Bring enough plain or mineral water. All these helps one to enjoy this visit better.

Oh. Don't forget to bring an insect bite relief cream. Not uncommon to get bitten by mosquitoes in such places."
,,Beautiful hike in a comfortable & safe environment,4.0,,"The Southern Ridges offer serene and beautiful hikes to the nature lovers. Paths are clearly marked and paved. Safe and suitable for children too.
The Henderson Waves is quite a beauty, especially at sunset.
We planned our walk such that our end point was to Safra Mt Faber for afternoon tea!"
,,Awesome Climb,4.0,,"Did an unusual thing this sunny Sunday morning. Braving the 30+ degrees heat. At 9.40am started to walk up Telok Blangah Hill, crossed Henderson Wave (a bridge linking Telok Blangah Hill & Mount Faber) into Mount Faber Park before arriving at Faber Peak. 15 minutes rest at Faber Peak. Made the same route back to Telok Blangah Hill, the origin. Arrived at origin at 11.05am. Happy to have conquered. (1 hour 25 minutes covering partial of The Southern Ridges.)"
,,Great Walk,5.0,,"we got down at Harbor Front metro, walked down to mount faber, it was raining slightly that morning, It was a real great walk. We really liked this stretch of the walk very much. In a busy city/ country such a calm place is really unimaginable."
,,Really nice walk and I could even wear sandals!!!,5.0,,"Got the MRT to the Harbourside then did the full 10km to Kent Ridge. When leaving the MRT follow signs away from Sentosa and over to Bus terminal, first path starts on far side of car park. First path was hardest as is uphill but doesn't last long, all proper footpaths and easy to follow. We did it in midday heat and survived (there were plenty of benches to keep us going). Would definitely recommend if you have a half day that needs filling."
,,A good hiking route,4.0,,"You can always break a sweat in some of singapore's nature walks. The southern ridges is one of them. This 10km route stretches from Marang trail in vivocity through mt Faber, Telok Blangah peak, Alexandra to Kent Ridge. Between Mt Faber and Telok Blangah, is the famous Henderson wave bridge. This is the usual route but since I stay near Kentridge, I do the reverse. This gives me a chance to continue up to Sentosa island to relax."
,,Canopy walk,5.0,,A lovely canopy walk. I started from the henderson wave and walk through the ridges to alexander road. The walk takes about an hour. Great activities for nature lovers. Not suitable for rainy days.
,,A long walk and a museum visits,4.0,,We got a chance to visit a museum after the long walk. The good thing about such a walk is that it is a straight and flat ground to walk on. This can lead you to the hortpark which bring you to more floral and fauna.
,,A delightful hike,5.0,,Carrying sufficient water with lightweight backpacking gear and some snacks to enjoy the nature trail by the city. It's easy access from the Harbourfront MRT Station.
,,Canopy Walk,5.0,,It was so lovely walking around the many tracks on Mt Faber. To walk through nature and view everything from canopy was wonderful and knowing that nature wasn't been destroyed to build tracks was even better
,,Good for the heart,4.0,,"Amazing. Started from Hort Park to Henderson Waves then on to Mt. Faber then Harbourfront MRT. Better to do it in the evening if you're aim is to see the Henderson waves at night time. Plus, you won't worry about heatstroke as SG Temp can be quite overwhelming at times. Bring lots of water and change of clothing perhaps. Lots of photo op in the area."
,,Beautiful Henderson Wave,5.0,,"It was just a few minutes walk from the Hort Park and we took the overhead bridge to the Henderson Wave. The entire journey took around 1hr and 15mins. You get to enjoy the tree top view along the way and many of times, you find yourself are with the monkeys...Great place to go."
,,Fantastic walk,5.0,,"It was a fantastic hike, we finished 10 kilometer trail. Great outdoor fun, enjoyed the serenity of parks..."
,,It's .. ok.,3.0,,"I expected the South East Asian jungle but found a man-made city park. Street noise all over. The ""gardening hub"" is the nicest part."
,,Fascinating walk,5.0,,Walked the whole way which took us quite some time as we were jet lagged and had a short sleep in one of the parks. Didn't see any monkeys but really enjoyed the walk. The structures which you walk on are amazing and the views are great. Do take an umbrella so you can shelter from rain without wearing a hot raincoat. They are $4 from the 7/11.
,,Enjoyable walk with true Singaporean design,5.0,,Walked from Kent Ridge (actually started near Clementi MRT as I got lost) all the way to Harbourfront. Like many others I was ridiculously impressed by Henderson Wave. Worth it! I would recommend giving yourself lots of time to do this walk as due to my getting lost I ended up doing the last half of the walk in the dark. There was not as many street lights or lighting as you would expect.
,,Long and tiring hike but worth it,4.0,,"We hiked from Hort Park to Harbourfront and enjoyed every bit of it. Normally we would be tired out walking this kind of distance, but it did not feel especially tough because the scenery changes frequently enough to keep us entertained, from the Forest Walk to the Henderson Waves. It's a trail every Singaporean and every visitor to Singapore (given the time) should tackle. Worth the sweat."
,,Walking in Singapore,4.0,,"Walked from Kent Ridge all the way the Mount Faber,A wonderful scenic walk but best done early in the morning.It can get very hot.For nature lovers its a must and its free!! A great change from the malls!
From Mount Faber we took the cable car down to Sentosa."
,,A wonderful walk,5.0,,Takes you up above Singapore harbour and into forest all very close to city. Great views and forest habitat.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Definitely worth a visit but I think a bit more work is required for the signage. I lost the trail somehow from Hort park trying to connect to forest walk. I think it's probably easier to pick up from harbour front towards Kent ridge but it was better for me starting Kent ridge as my preference and was also meeting friends after in sentosa for shopping and dinner all fresco by the water with the lights of sentosa in the backdrop
,,Nice walk,4.0,,"I would recommend starting the walk before 9am so that you can get to the top and enjoy the rest of the walk before the heat hits you. It is great activity for a Sunday morning to stretch the legs out and be a little bit closer to nature.
I would start the walk at harbour front and walk to Henderson wave"
,,Good time spent in Nature,5.0,,"I did the entire hike. It's nice. It's good time in nature and saw some massive spiders along the way. There are some good views and interesting bridges. This is not something I'd take tourists or visitors to see. It's good but it's also just nature. So if you like hiking, then go. But as far as nature, it's good so I'm giving it 5 stars."
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,"I got off at the wrong stop, and had to walk on the road for quite a while, so I would advice to check and make sure you know exactly where to get off. I see it is very convenient for cars to park or taxis to stop at the different spots as well. There are also bus stops near the Henderson Wave and Alexander Road. It is actually quite near to Sentosa and Universal Studios.
I started at the Henderson Wave, a very nice big bridge made of wood that oversee the city. It is very relaxing and calm to be on top. There are a lot of shaded sitting area. I mostly see locals and families there. There are also some tourists, but not a lot.
I walked through the Forest walk afterwards, and it was very quiet. I probably saw an amount of less than 10 people during my walk. I arrived at the Alexander bridge, which is less impressive than the Henderson Waves, mostly because of it's length and height.
I would advice to bring water and a hat, because it is quite sunny and there are not a lot of shades. Don't believe the time it says the walk takes. The Forest Walk said it takes 15 minutes, unless you are running, I don't think anyone would make it in that time. I enjoyed my walk a lot, and I think is great to be able to see so much nature in the city center. A lot of the attractions in Singapore requires admission fee, this doesn't and I think even if it does, it will still be worth it."
,,Hiking can be fun.,4.0,,"Something quite unique, but will invigorate you. Even for those not ""fit"", they can complete. Great nature experience and away from busy city life."
,,Great views but make sure to set the time aside,5.0,,"Great views around Singapore amongst so beautiful trails many raised into the canopy level. However, make sure to allow plenty of time as there are some long walks, particularly on a sunny day when it is especially hot."
,,Varied walks - all worthwhile,5.0,,"The walks/trails through the Southern Ridges include Kent Ridge, Canopy Walk, Hort Park, Forest Walk, Hilltop Walk, Henderson Waves, Mt Faber and Marang Trail. I started my morning walk at Reflections at Bukit Chandu, a war memorial commemorating the WWII Malaysian division that defended the ridge. This is a very moving, small museum right be the trail head to Canopy Walk and Hort Park. I followed the various trails to the end of the Marang Trail at VivoCity mall.

The trails along the ridge are quite different, but all are beautiful. Canopy Trail and Forest Walk are at treetop level on boardwalk and steel construction. It's also possible to follow the Forest Walk path at ground level by following signs for ""Earth Path"". Hort Park is a series of themed parks - I particularly enjoyed the Butterfly Garden. Next trip, I will plan more time to spend exploring Hort Park. This could be a stop by itself.

My first trip to Singapore included a hike from Mt Faber to Henderson Waves. I was not thoroughly prepared for Singapore's heat that trip. This time, to walk the 8 - 9 K route I planned, I wore wicking fabric hiking clothes, vented sun hat and carried water. With those preparations, the heat and humidity were not a problem.

The trail is fascinating with the views of forest, city, cultivated gardens, and ocean and the mix of manmade walking surfaces like the canopy walks and more natural forest pathways. Lots of birds. I did not see monkeys or snakes and only one small lizard. I did use mosquito spray before setting out, but still had some bites. My total time for my distance was about 2 hours."
,,Probably Better in the Daylight,4.0,,"We discovere dthis after a walk over the Wave Bridge one evening, so it was already dark. Was a lovely walk, and some great views, but would probably be more interesting in the day time, We just enjoyed the walk up in the trees, in all honesty, better than sitting in a hotel room"
,,A great walk,5.0,,This is a beautiful walking trail in the midst of the busy city.There are many places which can be covered but much depends on the weather.We had started at the Marang trial and started walking uphillbto Mount Faber.This part of the walk was very good but later it got warmer and it became difficult to walk on the suspended bridge.The name forest trail tempted me to think that we would be walking among lushgreen green forests but was disappointed ko as we got only to watch the forest from the suspended bridge than walk.i felt that they should change the name to forest watch. Overall this place is worth visiting if you have more than a week in Singapore
,,Lazy man's solution to this hike,4.0,,"Everyone mentions that you need 3-4 hours to do this hike, and that is true, if you do the whole thing. You can start in the middle, or you can skip parts by taking an uber to other sections that interest you. If you start at Kent Ridge you can take the canopy trail and walk mostly downhill to Hort Park. Or you can start at Hort Park and walk toward the Henderson waves. This hike has a more impressive version of the canopy walk. Take this to Mt. Faber and take the cable cars to Harbor or Sentosa... or have an Uber come get you. This hike can be 45 min, 1 hour, or 1.5 hours depending upon how much you choose to do. There are many points in the middle to stop by the road and pick up a cab or uber, so you are not stuck once you start."
,,great hike,5.0,,Plan to start early. Bring water. Bring a camera the walk has some great vistas. Plan for about 2 hours.
,,Walk among the trees and escape from the city,5.0,,This is a good walking trail for who enjoy walking and greenery. The walking trail is clearly designated by metal bridges suspended in the air. This is an excellent route for a good walk among nature.
,,Tree-top walk,4.0,,"A good way to spend half a day (if you can stand the heat). Bring water with you! You might see cool birds and butterflies on your walk, and you are most likely to monkeys just casually hanging out. Please do not feed them!"
,,Nice walk to get out and about,4.0,,Nice walk in one of the parks of Singapore - well laid out and good connections across main roads while staying in nature
,,Walk this way!,5.0,,"We were not seasoned Singapore walkers. In fact, we were no walkers at all - but Southern Ridges will change things. Wether you live in Singapore, or are here for just a couple of days - and looking to move your legs after a week in the office or a long flight - this is the thing to do. You are up for 3h among wild green, plus some breathtaking views. A good place to start is Hort Park or the smart little parking at Hyderabad Road (5 mins walk to Alexandra Arch) - this is an alternative route to the one beginning at Harbourfront. From there, you go straight into the Singing Forest/ Forest Walk - you will go uphill in this direction, and it can be a challenge (especially on a hot day, as the next bench to sit on is on the top of the hill). Still, the climb is gradual and stair-free, and probably less demanding than the Marang Trail start. If you decide to continue to Henderson Waves (worth every step), and then to Faber Peak, the last bit will be steeper. However, you can relax and reward yourself for the effort in one of the Peak's bars, or take the cable over to Sentosa, or just take a ride home/ hotel, and jump into the pool. Do not forget to take a bottle of water. Happy walking!"
,,Group Outing,4.0,,"Another rare place for Singapore and it's a really fun place to walk/explore with a group. Start your journey at Alexandra Arch through Henderson Waves and onto Mt Faber to get down towards Harbor Front and Vivocity. Very very good for a group bonding activities on the bridge at Henderson Waves or even Mt Faber. For the adventurous, may also consider walking the boardwalk into Sentosa."
,,What a Walk!,4.0,,"I was surprised by the different environments I was able to walk through and the sites that I was able to see during just a few hours of walking through the Southern Ridges.
Definitely need to bring water with you though, although the paths are clear the walking can be steep at times."
,,Marvelous Tree Top Walk in City,5.0,,"I walked from start to the end of it, which is to be the Henderson Bridge (wave-like bridge). I truly enjoy the tropical forest walk in the city. Just pure awesome!"
,,Best walk ever,5.0,,Not as well known as the botanical gardens or the gardens by the bay nevertheless this site is just as impressive. Interesting for military historians much of the area was a battlefield. This is heaven on earth for botanist. The high walks are do able if you look straight and not through the metal grills. Top tip take a spare shirt as you may end up very hot and sticky.
,,a quiet walk in hustling bustling Singapore,4.0,,"That wasn't my first trip to Singapore, so I tried to find something new to do in Singapore. And the southern ridges walk was recommended on an article I read about 10 top things to do in Singapore. The entrance starts at Marang road and ended on around Alexandra Road or can be extended to Hort Park if we choose that route.
I did it about 1 pm on May 6th 2016. So it was quiet hot. But it was a very quite walk. I almost did not meet anyone until I reached Henderson wave - the first attraction that I like. I also loved the trail in the jungle. It really helps distract me from Singapore's concrete jungle and a refreshing changes from city life. Although, I still can hear the sound of heavy machinery, horns, and cars from the neighboring location. But it was a nice walk after all."
,,Great to do. Can start in one location and finish at another with MRT both ends,5.0,,"This is a great walk or jog for those days when you want to get away from the downtown shopping strip. I like that you can start at the MRT either in Harbourfront or Kent Ridge, and walk one way to the other end. Makes a nice change from simply doing an out and back walk. Between these two ends is about 10 Km or mostly quiet parkland and even some natural semi jungle. If you haven't seen it before, take a stop at Reflections at Bukit Chendu, the museum that tells about the invasion and defence of Singapore in WW2. It's cheap to get in to, and makes a nice addition to the walk. Well presented small museum. The walk isn't hard, with the most difficult part being the heat and humidity. Go early or late to avoid mi day heat. There are a couple of places along the way where you can grab a cold drink (Kent Ridge Park, Hort Park Faber Hill, but remember to take $2 notes, as most are vending machines which only take $2 (you get a coin back in change).
As with most things in Singapore, it's amazing to see how they really make clever use of their resources, even land for a quiet walking track away from the traffic.
I do the walk a few times on every trip to Singapore, and always enjoy it."
,,Great way to unlock on a weekend,5.0,,Decided to go here on a saturday evening. Really enjoyed the whole experience. Comfortable for non trekkers as well.
,,"If you like walks, you should like this one.",5.0,,We walked this at night and felt very safe. With more time would have also done it during the day (early morning may be best). We took the cable car to Mt Faber and walked to Alexandra Rd where we caught a bus back to HarbourFront.
,,On top of Singapore,5.0,,The tree top walk let's you examine part of the tropical forest that is normally hidden from your eyes. This along with the vistas over different burrows of Singapore make this walk something special.
,,Lovely nature walk in thetree canopy,5.0,,We picked up the walk by clibming the stairs opposite the Hort Park and then we zig-zagged in the tree canopy towards the Henderson Wave bridge and up to the peak. A really lovely walk with kids and dog - enjoyed by all. Definitely recommend but go early so as to avoid the heat at midday.
,,Amazing sightseeing,5.0,,"Walk under hot weather, but i'm still excited about all sightseeing through it. End point at Mt Faber Park, the cable to Habourt Front was closed for a while, and they take us to Habourt by bus but no fee, so impressive!"
,,A Walk in the Clouds (almost),5.0,,"The Singapore government's National Parks website has all you need to know about walking the Southern Ridges - worth doing your homework if you've never been. This part of Singapore is a welcome, relaxing nature break, popular with families. Great viewing platforms for photography. It's a nine kilometre walk although you don't really notice the distance. Do take water with you however. I got off the MRT at Harbourfront to commence this walk. The Southern Ridges walk is well sign posted and I would rate it easy/medium. The walk finishes near Gillman Barracks arts precinct (Labrador Park MRT). Couple of hours well spent. As always, go early and avoid the crowds."
,,Good Experience,5.0,,"Virgin experience.. started at 3pm.. ended at 7pm on the dot! Worth while walk, enjoying the scenery.Best part is you'll pass by different bridges in different design."
,,Weekend walk,5.0,,"One of the most amazing jungle/park garden walks in the world. Walk from Kent Ridge Park all the way to the top of Mt Faber, through jungle, parks and along kilometers of canopy walkways high above the jungle below. Singapore's best views along the waY."
,,Gentle strole,5.0,,"Did this from Kent Ridge Park to Mt Faber good views especially the new harbour, would recommend taking plenty of liquids as some of the walk is not shaded, and a lack of refreshment stops,steep climb at the end to Mt Faber. Easily accessible by MRT to Kent Ridge and return via MRT from Vivo City, nice track from My Faber to Vivo City"
,,Charming morning walk,5.0,,"One of my favourite walks in Singapore, usually starting with a stroll through the Hort Park, then following the Tree Top Walk (a 2km long elevated road through rainforest inhabited by Monkeys and Birds), up past the Colonial Alkaff Mansion (where you can stop for a drink if you're feeling hot), across the gorgeous Henderson Wave bridge and up onto Mt Faber.. We usually end the walk by taking the Cable Car across to Sentosa, and relaxing with a cold beer on Siloso Beach. The"
,,Amazing walk,5.0,,A high walk way gets you into the canopy. It is hot but taking a spectacular walk along a relatively unpopulated walk-way the heat is enjoyable. If you head to the end it opens to a a research facilities for botanic - unfortunately there is not a lot of transport around - but it just means you have to keep going
,,good nature walk,4.0,,"A Good place if you happen to start from the western end and terminate at Bay Front MRT. Advisable to take water and electrolyte powder to replinish the lost electrolytes. Start early to have a memorable track. Excellent track but no thrills as it is very safe If lucky, you may see some reptiles along the way."
,,Lovely walk above the trees,4.0,,"We didn't do the full walk but started from Henderson Waves Bridge which in itself if quite different.
To get to the bridge we took the Circle Line MRT to Telog Blangah. Take exit A, onto Telok Blangah Road and take bus 176 which runs along Henderson Road, alight at stop immediately after Blangah Heights (probably second stop).
A short walk along the road then turn left into Telog Blangah Green, turn left and left again to reach Henderson Waves Bridge.
From Henderson Waves Bridge walk back and then along Telog Blangah Green away from the bridge. After 500 meters continue to bear left. The walk will cross over Lock Road and then Alexander Road. to Hort Park. These are well tended gardens and are a delight.
The whole Southern Ridges route is about 9km, but families can do smaller distances as we did. Minimum climbing, but a few slopes, easy once you reach the bridge, the kids will enjoy the route."
,,Very nice stroll,4.0,,"Went there for the afternoon, it's such a lovely city break, very quiet and nice. Awesome views over sentosa! Recommended!"
,,The Most Scenic Natural Walk Paths,5.0,,"The Southern Ridges are stunningly green and all the parks are interconnected.
Starting at Kent Ridge to Hort Park to the Alexandra Trail to Telok Blangah to Mount Faber.
Hort Park is lovely and has informative themed gardens and you can register to take a Workshop here.
Kent Ridge is the most beautiful, uninhabited park in all of Singapore with the loveliest fauna. It has a must do canopy walk with beautiful views of the ridges and also has access to the War Museum.
Its a sweaty , humid walk but worth every drop of sweat!!"
,,Love the scenic meandering routes and bridges!,4.0,,"The whole route will be 9km, but families can do smaller distances.
Minimum climbing, but a few slopes, easy hiking and kids will enjoy the route.

Stop along Henderson Waves or Henderson waves, catch your breath, pose for some photos.

Tips:
- leave the monkies along, do not feed, do not expose plastic bags
- For those who drive, plan how how you go back to collect your car after walk. )take MRt or bus?)"
,,A great (if somewhat sweaty) day hike,4.0,,"This is a great series of trails and bridges that covers about 10 km. It goes through (and above) the forest affording views of the harbor area, and a close look at the vegetation."
,,A great walk,5.0,,"Our family (boys aged 6 and 8) loved walking the Southern Ridges in Singapore. Make sure that you've got a good hat and plenty of drink, but this really was one of the highlights of our stay. It's a fantastic way to see the city, and there is much to see and do along the way, including a number of parks and playgrounds. The diversity of the plants and flowers alone were enough to keep my kids interested!"
,,A different view,5.0,,Walked the entire length - it was one of the best things that we did during our stay. The gardens that we passed through were amazing. Stopped at the small museum to world war 2 at the top of the hill and paused to reflect. Would recommend this to others to see the other side of Singapore.
,,Loved this walk,5.0,,Walked around 10k - amazing scenery and views. Take water as very few opportunities along the way to stock up.
,,Southern Ridges civilised walk,5.0,,"Good exercise that doesn't require a high level of fitness. Excellent scenery and not too crowded, except for some tourist buses at the most popular stops. The paths are well maintained. You won't need walking boots! Easily accomplished in 3 hours and there are several convenient exit points if you don't want to do the entire route."
,,Best sunset view,5.0,,A visit to Southern Ridges is an amazing experience. It shows how Singapore cares for natures. The walk on the bridge especially during sunset offers some amazing views of the sun setting over the city. For a nature lover its a must visit place in Singapore.
,,Closer to Nature,5.0,,Probably the only few places in Singapore where you can get really close to nature. Squirrels & monkeys can be seen wondering around the mini forested area. Exotic birds can also be seen here feeding on the berries.
,,One of the nice attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"I recommend who love the nature, the garden. You would be surprised to see such attraction in Singapore. A very good idea and nicely done to connect different part of Singapore"
,,A revelation,5.0,,"We caught a bus to Alexandra Road where there is a walkway and stairs to the Alexandra Arch Bridge. We then walked from there to the Henderson Waves Bridge. We then dropped down to Henderson Road and caught a bus back to the city centre. In all, a stroll of around 2.4kms. I would not recommend starting this from Henderson Road end as there is a huge and steep staircase to get to the start of the walk. Yes, I know this is only a small part of the Southern Ridges but better this most easily accessible and walkable part than not doing any of it."
,,Trails and History,5.0,,"Excellent location for hiking, walking, jogging, experiencing nature. Kent Ridge Park has plenty of parking available. The area is accessible via Pasir Panjang metro station or any number of buses. Lots of great walking/jogging to be had here.

It's also the original site of the Battle of Pasir Panjang, but has since been renamed. Along the walk/trail(s), you'll see placards in place speaking to what happened here. there is also the Reflections at Bukit Chandu museum/memorial site ($2 SGD entry fee), which is absolutely worth a stop. At the same time, it's a great green space not far from central Singapore. Best to come during the morning or early evening/evening hours as it gets hot and humid under the canopy. Bathrooms and gazebos/sitting areas are available throughout the park. It is stroller accessible on some paths, just be sure to be bring sunscreen (during the day), water and bug spray."
,,A fabulous walk but it is hot!,5.0,,"I've been to Singapore many times and didn't even know this existed. Thanks to Lonely Planet I found it this time and it was well worth it. We started our trek at Bukit Chendu and then continued all the way to Mt Faber and down to HarbourFront MRT. The walk is very well signposted and you get to walk through about three very different parks and landscapes. It does get hot so make sure you have lots of water, a hat and sunscreen. We opted for the walk at the end which is all down hill and easy. Alternatively you can take the cable car from Mt Faber. Singapore always manages to do these things well and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to do something a bit different and get out and amongst it. Well worth it."
,,How have I missed out on this for so long?,5.0,,While a friend was visiting we took the opportunity to hike from Mount Faber to the Science Park. And 11 Km walk that included the fantastic treetop walk. I will be back to walk along the elevated footpath at night. I think that will also be awesome and a bit cooler in the evening. I am constantly amazed with the offerings of our national parks! Wow. Bring a picnic lunch and make a day of it.
,,excellent spot,5.0,,This is one of my fav spots in Singapore. I love this area a lot. It is very forest like n there are a lot of hills to be seen.
,,Could do with more earth trails!,3.0,,"Did a little hike starting from Marang Trail from harbour front station (Exit D) to forest walk and back (round trip about 2 hours of faster than average walking). Good work out climbing the steps at Marang trail and some parts near faber peak. Other than it is mostly gradual slopes or flat ground. Go early (8 to 9am) to avoid the scorching sun. If you really want a more challenging walk, walk the stairs instead of the long canopy walkway. Consider getting onto the earth trail which is one of the few trails not covered by concrete."
,,Perfect walk in Singapore,5.0,,I go there every time when I am in Singapore. This is nice and long walk on the bridges above canopy of a jungle. It is more interesting than many other parks.
,,Go very early to avoid the heat!,5.0,,"I walked the route from Kent Ridge Park to Mt Faber, but would suggest it's easier to follow the route the opposite way as the signage seems to be geared to that direction. Also I was walking facing the sun but had I started at Mt Faber it would have been behind me. Much of the route is in the sun so start early (8am) to avoid the worst of the heat. There are vending machines along the way to buy drinks and snacks. The most interesting part was the Forest Walk between Telok Blangah park and Alexandra Arch along a raised walkway that is in the tree canopy. Also in this section you can take a quick detour to look at some of the old colonial black & white houses. The walk can easily be accessed by public transport. Get off at Harbourfront MRT, walk up the Marang Trail to Mt Faber. At the Kent Ridge Park end, go down Pepys Rd near the war museum Reflections at Bukit Chandu. This brings you out near Pasir Panjang MRT or catch a bus back to Harbourfront. A great morning out."
,,A lovely walk after a visit to Reflections at Bukit Chengdu,5.0,,"I have always wanted to do this walk, but thunderstorms are often a concern, and heat is almost always a concern! But we set out on a dry afternoon after a visit to Reflections at Bukit Chendu (a wonderful and atmospheric attraction). The Southern Ridges walk can be joined right across the street by walking down the path into the park or by walking on the elevated walkway into Kent Ridge Park, which is not that much further along the path. Since Kent Ridge is essentially towards the end of the walk, we took the path down into the park. On a weekday, at least, it's a fairly quiet and pleasant walk where you can admire plant life and plenty of butterflies. The walk then extends into the very pleasant Hort Park, which has many theme gardens and is really just a really wonderful place to walk. This leads you towards Alexandra Road, where the path turns elevated again, and leads you through some lovely forest. The signs warn of not touching wild monkeys, but unfortunately, we didn't see any! They probably stayed tucked into the cool trees. One added bonus of this part of the walk is that you walk by a very lovely area of old black and white houses leftover from British days. Loved it!

We also took a short detour to see the Alkaff Mansion. This beautiful hilltop mansion used to be a wealthy family's home, but now it is a well-rated restaurant. A little further along from the mansion is the Henderson Waves Bridge which takes you over to the Mt. Faber area. We headed towards the ""Jewel Box"" hoping we could take the cable car over to the Harborfront Mall, but they don't allow that. You have to buy a full round-trip ticket over to Sentosa and back, so we walked a little further past the Jewel Box and headed down the hill through yet more forest. The mall was just across the street once we made it down the hill (it is quite a few steps!). We had a wonderful kaya toast and coffee at Wang Cafe in the mall, and congratulated ourselves on a really fun afternoon. Fun to see another side of Singapore. I highly recommend it. Oh, and don't forget to pick up the very useful map of the whole walk. I got mine at Hort Park in the giant park entrance pavilion. Not sure where else they are available, but the map is really great and informative."
,,Exercise and interest all rolled into one visit,4.0,,Walking the southern ridges and the Henderson waves gives you an opportunity to enjoy Singapore away from all the shopping malls and high rise buildings. It helps you to imagine what Singapore used to be like in the 1960s before the developers took over. A good way to get some exercise too.
,,Excellent escape from the city,5.0,,"We walked from Hort Park to the base of Mt Faber through this fantastic course of bridges and treetop walks. Took ~1.5 hrs, but you could definitely stretch it out with a picnic at the top of Mt Faber (check out Faber point for a nice view of Sentosa and the city). Highly recommended for an escape from the intensity of Singapore. Stop in at Faber bistro if you fancy an icy cold beer to cool down after the walk."
,,Serene and Green,5.0,,Definitely worth taking a day out to explore this alternative side of Singapore. Beautiful views and good exercise too! Easy access via the cable car - don't miss the Henderson waves.
,,Very good walk for pretty much all abilities,4.0,,"I did this walk in November and really enjoyed it, many people walking but not too overloaded with use."
,,Awesome views,5.0,,"An awesome place to see some wildlife, this was the beginning of my running route. There isn't many people on the ridges. Mainly joggers. As I was running I even got the chance to see a monkey in a tree as I ran past."
,,SOUTHERN RIDGES,5.0,,This is an green park ideal for weekend walking trail ... It extends almost 10kms starting from Kent Ridge Park and HarbourFront. There are beautiful bridges on the way to take your breadth away.
,,a whole stretch of nature and good walk and view and also a great place to relax or exercise,5.0,,"a whole stretch of nature and good walk and view and also a great place to relax or exercise. good for morning or evening or even night stand at henserson wave bridge which is top 10 bridges in the world. also the hort park, the other walking area or mouont faber"
,,Great walking,5.0,,A must and a great escape from the sterile Singapore allocate a morning and go enjoy the jungle safe environment Plenty to see and great way to keep fit 🇸🇬
,,So beautiful,4.0,,"I prepared umbrella for rain, I had to use it a while for the sun makes me feel too hot. Just for the begining, after you enter inside, mostly quite comfortable.."
,,jan 2016,5.0,,it is long walk choose the section to need to see we went to Faber Wave nice walk and new idea. must carry water and umbrella
,,Something different,5.0,,"What a fantastic experience. Much of the path is on an elevated platform which provides great views, both of the scenic panorama, and also the surrounding buildings. Since the terrain on the ridges is far from flat in places, it is also a great way to get some exercise, although inevitably, unless you go up early, it is likely to be a bit sticky humidity wise. Having said that I would be more than happy to do it again."
,,Nice hike,4.0,,"Very nice hike but very warm. Nice trees and flowers. Easy to get refreshments along the route (and boy, do you need them)"
,,great views in the lush green!,4.0,,the walk on the southern ridges is great - you can start and sop any time - either start at Kent Ridge park (close to NUS) or at mount faber - or you can get on it at Alexandra road near Hortpark. the walk meanders the southern top elevation and you get great views to Sentosa the city and towards central Singapore. on good clear days you can see the outer islands and even all the way to Indonesia! but do bring some water because you can dehydrate easily. several good restaurants along the way....
,,Excellent walk through Singaporean nature,4.0,,"This is an amazing trail through Singaporean nature, offering great views to the City. I suggest to start from the very top in Kent Ridge Park and then go down all the way till Harbour Front"
,,Great walk through the jungle!,4.0,,"Great place to get out of the buzz of the city and see some wildlife like birds, monkeys and sometimes snakes!"
,,"Exhausting (in the heat), but so worthwhile!",5.0,,"I love this amazing walk. How cool to have an elevated walkway that connects one green area to the next, allowing you to walk between the treetops and trees for many kilometers.

Plus the architecture of several of the pedestrian bridges that you pass is spectacular.

Highly recommended!"
,,Relaxing day walk,5.0,,"A relaxing and enjoyable day walk meandering through multiple parks on the outskirts of the city. The views from the Henderson Waves and Mount Faber Point are great, but you should also check out the view from the Terrace Garden at the top of one hill about halfway along. It's a nice peaceful wander, and the walking is fairly easy - sealed surfaces at a low gradient (although there are stairs in some sections)."
,,Worth it.,5.0,,"To come here has many way, but I recommended to walk from the MRT station and you will have a nice trek and great view."
,,Nice hike,4.0,,"We walked the southern ridges from just before mount faber to the canopy walk by kent ridge. some parts are nicer then other, but overall a pleasant walk."
,,Fantastic and long walk amid the nature and with beautiful views,4.0,,"Watch out, the walk can be pretty long, from Mount Faber to the Canopy walk it took me more than 2h, a little less on the way back as I didnt found my way properly initially.
One regret : not any wild monkey to be seen at all..."
,,Walking trail for those who enjoy nature from a distance,4.0,,"This is a good walkin trail for those who enjoy walking and greenery but prefer to keep the dirt out fo their hair and shoes.The walking trail is clearly designated by metal brdges suspended in the air. There are short and long trails to cover depending on your level of determination, Anyone can take these trails including children as the metal bridges are smooth except for steps on certain trails."
,,Walk among the trees,4.0,,This is an excellent route for a good jog among nature. The access to Mount Faber and Gillman Barracks adds on to the cool factor!
,,A good walking trail,4.0,,"Although this walking trail is on paved surface for the entire distance, it's still most enjoyable. It's a little tricky to get to Kent Ridge Park from Kent Ridge MRT, but once you're there you just follow the standard route all the way through to Mt Faber. I particularly like the elevated walkways in Telok Blangah Hill Park."
,,Great walk,5.0,,We walked from Mt Faber to Kent MRT. It was hot work however lovely to feel your out of the city. Amazing bridges and walkways.
,,Good place to get some exercise,4.0,,If you live nearby then this a great place to get some exercise. Start at Hortpark walk uphill to Henderson Waves for a great view of Southern Singapore from the bridge.
,,Great place for walks.,5.0,,"This is one of the nice examples of what is possible in Singapore and something you might not see a lot in other cosmopolitan cities in Asia. The ridges let you walk above a part of Singapore where many tourists never go but nevertheless is a great -very green- area of the city that is worthwile going. We used to go there quite often when we lived nearby but after we moved further to the east, we visit the place less often but it remains a very nice area towalk around."
,,Great for an urban hike,4.0,,"This was a very interesting hiking trail for us, it goes through so many different parts of the city and really done in a way that only Singapore could do it. It is not strenuous at all and very well sign posted for the most part.

You get to see some really interesting architecture around. It was also cool to be standing above the trees at some points. We did the walk during the week and we did not come across many people, I imagine on the weekend it must be swamped."
,,Peace and quiet in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a great place to go for a relaxing walk. Its so peaceful and green, you're basically walking through gardens and on walkways that lead you over the rainforest up to Mt. Faber.
There are signs everywhere so you won't get lost.

A word of caution: Bring drinks and, most importantly, check the weather! The first time we came to the Southern Ridges we got surprised by a thunderstorm with heavy rains. There are a few shelters scattered along the way and we waited there for at least half an hour. Nevertheless, we were completely soaked. And as it turned out, it was worth the wait! After the thunder and lighting had stopped, we walked to the next bus stop and saw several branches on the ground as well as a massive tree that blocked the road.
We came back the next day and made it all the way to Mt. Faber. Don't despair, it isn't a crazy climb to the top and the view makes it all worthwile."
,,Peaceful.,5.0,,"Peaceful place to take a long stroll, walk or run. Not too strenuous, as most of it is on gentle walkways. There are some steps to get on to the path.

The Wavy Bridge is worth seeing and stopping for a breather on the many seats dotted along it.

A few placards along the way give information on the plants, birds and wildlife with warnings about not feeding the monkeys, although, we didn't see any."
,,Great place for a walk or run,5.0,,"I went out their twice, once for a run of about 10km up and down the hills. Great place to be in the middle of the city. Another time I took the cable car, which was great to have a nice view over the harbour."
,,"A place for a morning or evening walk, or just to admire the hills and greenery.",4.0,,"The Southern Ridges comprises of Henderson Waves, Hort Park, Kent Ridge Park and Mount Faber. A complete walk should take about 2-3 hours, so an umbrella or a cap and comfortable walking shoes are a must. A good place for hikers and nature lovers, or visitors who desire to get away from the city buzz. You can consider having a comfy but more expensive dinner at eateries at Mount Faber and enjoy the night scenery from the high vantage point."
,,Excellent Run Above the City of Singapore,5.0,,This is one of my favorite places for a run. You feel above the city as you run the hills and ridges with iconic bridges along the path. You have to do more than once because the first time your run turns into a walk as you admire the sites and view.
,,Stroll with the family,5.0,,"We started at the Alexandra Road end, the walk is on a raised walkway for most of the section between Alexandra Road and the summit. Great views at various spots and vistas across regenerating rainforest.

Take Water and walking shoes/trainers, suitable for moderately healthy, wheelchair accessible - BUT come from My Faber end to then mostly travel downhill"
,,Long walks.,5.0,,"Walking along the Southern Ridges, above the trees, is relaxed and pleasant. I like the views very much. Henderson Waves are of an interesting design."
,,Worth the early morning wake -up call,5.0,,"A great place for semi easy walk with uphill , downhill steps and great views. Start at the Marang trail and do a full loop for a good sweat... But stop to take in the panoramic views! Best to start your trail at 7 so that by the time you finish the sun is just heating up... You can stop by at Seah Inn food court for a delicious and refreshing green apple and celery juice. About 10,000 steps and 300+ calories burnt. A great start to a weekend. Enjoy!"
,,Nice Sunday walk to escape the city,5.0,,"This walk is part of my morning run up to the top of Mount Fabre. Its a great nature escape - often you can see many animals, colorful birds and macaques. Try it in the morning just after a rain when the moisture is coming off the trees - it will fill your lungs with pristine air."
,,Worth the Visit,4.0,,"We only had one day in Singapore and I wanted to make sure to visit here. Had a hard time having a taxi understand where this place was until I named Hort park instead of saying ""Southern Ridges"". We started at Hort Park and walked through the Canopy Walk all the way to Henderson Waves. Such a beautiful park! Love all the greenery and seeing parts of the city as well. It was worth making the trip here."
,,Easy day's trek through singapore,4.0,,"For something more strenuous, I like to start from Harbourfront/Telok Blangah end with the staircase and work towards the Hort Park at Alexandra. I grab a drink at the water fountains in Hort park, browse the flora and hop onto a bus from the bus stop just below the bridge outside Hort Park to get off at IKEA Alexandra about 7 minutes away for a good feed.
Otherwise, doing it the other way round, you can spend the rest of your day at Sentosa if you still have the energy. Bring a water bottle half frozen into ice as it will give you cold water as it melts in the heat and humidity. A poncho is best for sun protection. Mosquitoes weren't an issue. Bring your camera with zoom for some interesting architectural and scenic angles.
I tried the route ending at NUS/Kent Ridge park once - nothing very much and it was difficult to get home afterwards so I suggest getting off at Hort Park and catching the bus back to civilisation."
,,Amazing nature trail right in the midst of this modern Global City,5.0,,"A spectacular nature trail taking you through a series of hills along seven ridges, crossing spectacular & exciting treetop bridges and suspended pathways - all along taking in the flora & fauna of Singapore. Excellent F&B outlets and parking available enroute allow access for families with portions wheelchair accessible.
A surprisingly green and tranquil find in the middle of this busy global Asian city. & crowded"
,,Different surfaces to traverse.,4.0,,"Finding the start near Kent Ridge MRT was tricked but once on the path we enjoyed the walk through forest and lush vegetation on canopy walks, metal walkways and the wooden Henderson Waves."
,,"A pleasant, long walk through verdant greenery.",5.0,,"- Take an unbroken nature from Mount Faber to the Hort Park at Alexandra.
- Highlights: Henderson Waves, the Canopy Walk, Alexandra Arch.
- Accessible by public transport (Harbourfront MRT station, busses)
- Various access points (Mount Faber, along Henderson Road and Alexandra Road)
- Great views of the southern coast of Singapore.
- Best experienced in the evening when the Henderson Waves are illuminated."
,,amazing bridge,4.0,,"We were lucky enough to be told about this amazing area by one of the local gardeners..it was well worth the walk, there are lots of places along the way to take pix and just sit and look at the views...it was very hot the morning we went, so do take water and a hat."
,,Always amazed by this great walk,5.0,,"This is a must for anyone spending some time in Singapore. It is a beautiful walk that includes parks, bridges, walkways, and amazing views.

The telok blangah section is very nice as you get to walk on top of the trees, but the definite highlight is the Henderson waves and mount faber. We take all the visitors we get at least to that portion.

Once at the top of faber, make sure you cross through the restaurant on the second floor of the jewel box and see the nice walkway full of bells (all tied to a fence).

It's really worth it!"
,,Unexpected Singapore,5.0,,This is one of the places I didn't expect to see in Singapore .Hiking and walking above the forest is definitely an amazing experience. It's a great work out and such a relaxing thing to do as an escape from the big city life.
,,Amazing Day Out,5.0,,Great day out for all the family walking these beautiful trails. Take a break from the city and experience the rich nature that Singapore has to offer when you venture away from the skyscrapers.
,,We loved it!,5.0,,"We did hortpark and from there on started our forest walk, after crossing the Arch and walked to the Telok blangah park. Just loved the Forest walk on the stepless steel girders"
,,Great place to walk,3.0,,"Started the journey from Harboutfront, walked up the Mount Faber Hill and started the nature walk to the Southern Ridges and walked to Hortpark. It was a good 2 hours nature walk and see a lot of greens."
,,Greater than the sum of its parts,5.0,,"Having been to Singapore several times, I felt like I was really running out of places to see and things to do. Wanting to get away from the city and the crowds, I chose to spend a day at the Southern Ridges. I didn't realize it was so large, but it was a very enjoyable four hour walk through the entire area.

Although I would only give each of the parks and trails 3-4 stars each, they are all so different from each other that it feels like a multi-layered journey through nature. Some of the notable locations are Mount Faber Park, Henderson Waves, the Forest Walk, HortPark, and Kent Ridge Park.

If starting from the southeastern end of Southern Ridges, you can take the MRT to Harbourfront (orange and purple lines) and up the Marang Trail to Mount Faber. The hike concludes on the northwestern side at Kent Ridge Park. The closest MRT station from here is located about 10-15 minutes away on foot at the National University Hospital (Kent Ridge CC24, orange line)."
,,Forest walk,3.0,,"The Southern Ridges is situated in the middle of a few connected nature walk. If you want to walk the whole trail, you can start from the Kent Ridge trail to Hortpark, Southern Ridges, Henderson Waves Bridge and finally Mount Faber. Prepare for a long hike but you can always stop anytime."
,,Could be better but good green scene,4.0,,"Went here for about 10.30am for 3 hours and even then the heat can get heavy after 1pm.

The trek is enjoyable but a bit too much concrete/paths for my liking rather than natural paths. Even the bridges are metal rather than a wooden authentic feel.

The signage could be better as it is easy to get lost. Started at Harbourfront where again the trail is not signposted and then getting to the other side was a nightmare trying to find the MRT.

Worthwhile to visit and get away from the malls."
,,Perfect Sunday Plan,5.0,,"We started the Southern Ridges trek from Marang Trail and climbed up the steps to Faber Peak. Definitely take a break in their ""Peek-a-loo""...you will never get such a view from another public restroom!
Its a fairly easygoing trek and there are plenty of sheds and pit-stops to regain energy."
,,A great walk,4.0,,My husband talked me into doing this walk. I'm not much for doing this sort of thing but I really enjoyed it. It was very hot but at times you got a cooling breeze blowing across. Take plenty of water. We walked about 4 kms. You walk gradually uphill mostly on metal walkways gradually to the top of the forest. We didn't see any monkeys but apparently they do show themselves. We made our way to Mt Faber and the cable car. Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys walking. It was quite easy.
,,Spectacular in the evening with nice light effects,4.0,,We went to the Southern Ridges earlier this year. Start taking a cable car ride from Sentosa to Mt.Faber and walked downhill following the directions to this spectacular place. It's recommended in the evening when it's not so hot and if you walk back all the way you should be in good condition. There are few options you can explore on the southern ridges with a few km to walk. Nice experience.
,,Great walk in the parks,5.0,,If you are tired of shopping malls why not take a walk along the Southern Ridges from Harbourfront to NUH? It is like stepping back in time with old black and white houses and beautiful scenery and great views. Get close to nature - the tembusu trees smell wonderful in March and October and Hort Park is full of surprises.
,,A forest within the city,5.0,,"My friend and I got to this place by accident. We were headed to Henderson Waves but got off on the wrong side of the road which led us to the Alexandra Arc. We were pleased to have found this high trail that made us experience the sounds of nature and beautiful view of trees.

Prepare walking shoes as you will find yourself going through more than 2 km of walk and a bit of hiking."
,,One of the best walk trails through much greenery !,5.0,,"Needless to say, there is much flora and fauna to enjoy and the view from Mount Faber is quite nice. The quiet of the walk and absence of vehicle traffic is really refreshing and quite amazing as this trail runs through quite a bit of our concrete jungle. A gem, that's what this is !
Singapore is humid so be prepared to sweat it out. We usually start from base of Kent Ridge Park, walk to Hort Park, pass the Alexandra Arch towards Henderson Waves before ending up at Vivocity.
Take a bottle of water and coins, you can refill along the way as there are water coolers or drink dispensing machines. If with small children, bring some snacks to boost their energy as this could be a long walk."
,,Long journey of hiking,4.0,,"It's a very long way for this bridge, we can go through the Henderson waves, forest walk, hortpark and the mount faber park. Better to walk at the morning, so not too hot for the sun and bring more water then wear comfortable shoes."
,,Magnificent scenery,5.0,,"Singapore is an amazing city with spectacular walking gardens, boardwalk ""hiking "" through wonderful equatorial nature preserves. The infrastructure is well cared for, people friendly."
,,Good choice for turists,4.0,,This is not the best nature trail in Singapore but is the best one for turists. Reasons are: the trail actually linked 4 parks and each park has unique style. The view to Singapore bay is so good. There are many places providing drinks and snacks (self-service machine). You could quit whenever you felt tired and get easy access to public transport. Usually I took 4 hours to complete the whole trail and could be really relaxed.
,,The best walk in Singapore,5.0,,"Winding through parks, jungles, gardens and open green spaces this walking route takes you high into the canopy and down on small paths. If you do the whole route you'll see a lovely variety of different spaces and get some fantastic views from the hilltops. We love it!"
,,Fabulous walk with view,5.0,,"The walk is refreshing & the air is fresh while one is able to reflect on the hustle & bustle of life.
It is great for one to bond with family /friends through the long walk. The view is different from what we see on the ground. It is recommended to recharge oneself."
,,Great hike!,4.0,,"A place for a good hike - getting out of the skyscrapers view(could still see some) , not too busy so great for a quieter weekend. (i'm not sure if it is always the case during weekends.. but seems not the easiest for kids)"
,,Enjoyable bush walk close to Singapore city,5.0,,"I did this lovely walk with 3 friends on a hot day. There are shady parts on the walk and we got a cool breeze along the way so it was not too difficult. Take lots of water as it is quite steep in parts.

We started at the foot of Mt Faber near the Harbour Front train station. Besides enjoying the variety of trees and shrubs, this walk provides great views from the ridge towards the city, the harbour and Sentosa."
,,A nature ramble in the city,5.0,,"Our city state has natural beauty interwoven with the bustling roads. This walk will take you through some historic areas such as Mount Faber and Kent Ridge Park (with random military relics), give you glimpses of the port that built this nation, and take you to views of the best public housing in the world, and also some of the most exclusive housing enclaves. And all this is aside from the flora and fauna around you."
,,There are much better walks,2.0,,"Meh.... The best part of this walk is the Anderson Waves Bridge. There are much better walks - try Pulau Ubin, MacRithie or even the Bots."
,,Very nice long walk from one end to the other,5.0,,Very nice long walk from one end to the other. Be prepared to see a side of Singapore that you won't even dream off. I started off at the Kent Ridge side and ended up at the Hort Park. Takes about 2 hours if you stroll slowly. Get ready to get really sweaty. Best if you start really early before 7 am. Watch the sunrise as you make your way. It's safe. Lots of joggers.
,,hike hike hike,4.0,,"Good to do it during morning or evening when the sun is not too HOT. Great scenery, and the highlights will have to be the Henderson Wave."
,,Great walk,5.0,,One of the best things to do in Sg. Hard to find the entrance at Kent Ridge but easy at Harbourfront. Write if you need to locate the Kent Ridge entrance.
,,Great Walk,5.0,,Did this after reading about it on the internet was difficult to find the start but once on it it's easy to follow. Took us to the Wave Bridge were we caught the cable car down to Senatosa Island worth a visit.
,,Great walk from harbour front to here,5.0,,"Good
-I walked from harbour front station/ mount Faber park through telok blangah park, through hort park, and then through kent ridge par.

-Very nice walk and the South ridges are great to see

Bad
-I would have been left a little disappointed if I hadn't done the rest of the walk that I did"
,,Southern Ridges Walk,4.0,,"You can start from foot of Mt Faber near the Harbour Front Station and enjoy the view of the trail. On the way to the top of Mt. Faber, you will see the ""black & white"" house built during the British time. On the top of Mt. Faber, enjoy the view of Sentosa. Follow the sign board to guide you The Henderson Wave Bridge, Telok Blangah Hill Park, HortPark (Npark nursery) and Kent Ridge Park. Try to walk on the evening to view the sun set."
,,Great walk but go early to beat the heat.,4.0,,"We had real trouble finding the trail after following instructions and getting off at Kentwell MRT station. We walked around for about 2 hours, asked directions, sought advice but still could not find it. The day was getting hotter so we gave up and caught a cab to Mt Faber and walked out and back from there. It was a great walk but we did not beat the heat after our false start and as a result we were doing it a little tough by the time we walked down the hill at Mt Faber to the Harbourside MRT station. I would recommend this but make sure you leave early."
,,Tree top adventure,5.0,,A walk with great experience. Lots of wild nature here. Bridges built with metal and wood intertwining with nature and bringing you close to nature. A place out of the hustle and bustle of the city life. Here its just nature and you.
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,"It sure was a challenge for me that is afraid of heights, but so much fun. Really nice to see the city from above. A good idea is to walk from the west of Hort Park (with nice gardens and wooden canopy walk) and towards the city. Perfect free entertainment (and a good sweat)."
,,Great relaxing walk in the treetops,5.0,,"I love this walk, you are away from all the malls, shops and bustle of Singapore and you remember that life is good high above in the trees."
,,An excellent walk,5.0,,Take plenty of water but it's a lovely walk and nice to get out of the hustle and bustle. The beginning of the walk could be better signposted though although the latter part is
,,Great place for evening stroll,5.0,,"If you are a person who likes nature and wants to spend some quality time away from the hustle bustle of the city, then it's a must see place for you... You can start your walk after getting down at the bus stop opposite S P Jain.. Start your walk at around 4 to 4:30 pm and follow the trail as it goes through... You should visit the Mount Faber Park on the way to Henderson Waves and finally to the Faber Peak... You can pack some food and drinks and start your walk.. It's absolutely safe to walk even in the evening although there will be few stretches along the way which will be quite lonely... If you love photography, make sure to carry your tripod stand as you will get some breathtaking views from the top..."
,,Great place to become one with yourself,5.0,,"I woke up early and traveled by bus to find it. It was an absolute pleasure from the first moment. I started at the Alexandra Arch and made my way through the Kent ridge park where I wandered for hours taking in sights and sounds along the nature trails...

I enjoyed myself completely and highly recommend for anyone who loves to both hike and escape the day to day!"
,,Time out for trail walking,5.0,,"Great for slow long walk with a friend... simply enjoy the scenery along the way. Lovely feeling to be in the middle of greeneries in a city. Recommended for morning walk when it is cooling, avoid mid afternoon as the sun can be scorching hot and unfriendly."
,,Just opposite!,4.0,,"I stay just opposite to the place from where it starts. A really good place for jogging or for a morning/evening walk. Since the place is entirely covered by trees, it is a very ideal place for a walk. The walk can get you to Mt. Faber park from where you can have a very nice view of part of Singapore city. Really worth visiting and highly recommended for relaxing your mind."
,,Great views,5.0,,I love this walk. Start early as it gets super hot! It's great as you can start near the cable car and go for as long as you want. The terrain keeps changing so you never get bored.
,,Great walk over the trees,5.0,,What an impressive walk! Take water with you and go in the mirning or evening and you will have a great walk with loveley pictures.
,,Nice Long Walk,5.0,,"We had a nice long walk in the morning here. We took the mrt train to the Harbor Front station and got to the starting point from there. The bridges were very well design and seats are available for you to rest. But you have to be prepared. Take along an umbrella, wear a hat, and bring a bottle of water as well as some snacks. We ended our walk at Hort Park."
,,Nice long uphill walk,4.0,,"I've been to this place many many times, I highly recommend it for a nice long uphill walk. It isn't as steep as McRitchie or Bukit Timah, and its not a dirt road either, but a rather modern steel struts and ramp structure meandering through the tree tops. You start from Hort Park (SP Jain College Bus Stop) and climb your way up the steel ramps all the way to the top past Henderson Waves.

Before sunset is when I've been most of the times and the sun set is a pretty sight. Also after the sunset the bridge lights up and that too is rather pretty. The structure is well lit at night, without being completely flooded with artificial light, leaving you to enjoy the tree-tops even into the night. Hort Park is worth a visit before climbing up too.

The other way to get here is via the arduous Marang Trail way, which starts from the bus stop opposite Vivo City, and consists of big steps all the way to the top. As I call this arduous you can guess my fitness level. In my defense, I have bad knees and hate steps. I would choose the Hort Park way any day over the Marang Trail access. But if you need a quick boost of cardio, you can run up the Marang Trail and it'll leave you breathless."
,,Treetop trails through cool meandering walkways and overhead bridges,5.0,,"We wandered up from Hort Park on Alexandra Road and made our way where the path led through the treetops. A very enjoyable walk that gives you a good understanding that Singapore is not all that flat! We crossed a modern wooden slopped bridge and on towards metal walkways across small ravines. Our kids loved looking through the grated steel bridges down to the passing traffic below. I recommend taking the long walking route to Mount Faber and take the taxi back down the hill or better still, keep the fun going by taking a cable car ride on towards Sentosa and back. Try that at dusk : ) Lots of cool breeze rising up from below."
,,Some greenery and wildlife in the city,4.0,,"Given that Singapore can seem very built up it is good to get into a slightly less built up part - although you can get further out of the city elsewhere - and just wander through some trees and see some wildlife. Wild and out of the way it is not, but expect to see monitor lizards, macaques, a good range of bird life, and also maybe snakes (a friend found a black cobra here early one morning), and other native wildlife. I would advise going early before it gets really busy and too hot and humid. Also, I have walked from the western end to the east so you end at Mt Faber and Vivocity which seems a better place to end the walk. Some parts of the walk are also fascinating in and of themselves."
,,great walk amongst the trees,4.0,,Great walk amongst the trees we walked from mt faber to the henderson waves all the way to hort park lovely afternoon walk
,,Canopy Trails,5.0,,Walk among the tree canopies. Apparently there are wild monkeys so don't take plastic bags with you. Locals come here for hikes.
,,Remember to come here in the earlier morning,4.0,,"There are really clear instruction on the way between four parks. No need to worry about getting lost. You can see monkeys here. But be careful with your phone when taking photos. They seemed very interesting in robbing your phone (hahaha). Recommend to come here earlier in the morning. Otherwise, it gets super hot after 9 am."
,,One of my Favourite walks in Singapore,5.0,,"Less crowded than botanical gardens and also free, a chance to cover different areas all the way from Kent Ridge Park, over Hort Park, Gilman Barracks to Mt Faber, with amazing views over Sentosa on Henderson Waves bridge (best for the sunset, that's when it does get crowded)."
,,Great Run!,5.0,,This was one of most enjoyable things I did. This is a beautiful track. Pack your jogging shoes and try to go near late afternoon.
,,Reconnect with Nature in Hidden Singapore,5.0,,"One of our favorite Singapore adventures. Off the beaten path and not very ""touristy"", walking the Southern Ridges is a stunning way to see a side of Singapore many people do not bother to find. You will hike through forest, down a mountain, across the most modern bridges peering at the city sprawled out below you. It is great exercise and a fantastic break from commercialism which can quickly become overbearing."
,,Getting out of the city,4.0,,"Nice walk around this area , but with the Haze in september (very bad) the view was not as good as it should be."
,,Great walk,4.0,,We caught a cab to mt Fabre cable car station then walked down the hill to Henderson waves forest walk and Alexandra arch. Amazing architecture with the bridge and walkways in the forest. Prob about 4 kilometres but all down hill .we stopped at Alexandra st and walked to Labrador mrt and caught the train back. Lots of clean toilets and drink machines along the way. Didn't see any monkeys. A great experience
,,Interesting Bridge,4.0,,Interesting park. A great walking area - you can chose to walk miles or a short walk along bridge. Very nice area.
,,jungle in the city,4.0,,peace and quiet in the bustle and great contrast of nature and modern buildings. if you plan to run it - be ready for those climbs !!!!
,,Enjoy nature but take lots of water to drink,3.0,,"We went on a hot day and almost collapsed with dehydration. We went there by cable car and enjoyed the sights. The walk was enjoyable despite the many stairs but the heat got to us. Make sure you take a hat and enough water for each hour you spend there. Some of the walks took us to very urban corners which was disappointing, but overall it was a good way of spending an afternoon."
,,Marvellous view!,5.0,,Spent a lovely afternoon/evening walking along the southern ridges and the view from the high ground was fantastic! Can see the entire sea from the views and remember to bring a bottle of weather as the weather can be unforgiving!
,,One of the best hikes in SG,5.0,,"If you have a little time in Singapore, be sure to try out this hike/walk; it will take you through a part of the city that you might not otherwise see and the views from the ridge are great. Start early, as it's a fairly exposed walk and can get very hot. Also, put insect repellant on before heading out as mornings can be quite buggy!"
,,Amazing walking,5.0,,We joined at Henderon Road steps and walked the Henderson Wave bridge. Such an amazing structure. We walked the forest trail which is an open air structure along the tree tops to Alexandrai Arch.
,,Garden City - living up to its name,5.0,,"Family friendly, visitors of all ages wont find this trail challenging. Gradient is not high. Trail is wide enough with handrail. A lot of sittable seats are available along the Walk. Pretty great for some R&R.

More than just greenery, if you reach Labordor Natural Reserve, you will be able to explore historical stuff such as the Fort Pasir Panjang and the Dragon Teeth Gate.

Rich bio-diversity is preserved. Although there are a lot of artificial inputs such as bridges and overpass, but these structure do not compromise the nature. Instead, they co-exist and integrate well into the green setting. It is an absolute delight to hike. HortPark is an instance where you can enjoy the green scenery while picking up some knowledge about horticulture.

The entire trail is well managed and designed. Great work Singapore authority!"
,,weekend morning haunt,5.0,,"A personal favorite weekend hang out, ends a scenic walk at the alkaf mansion with a hearty waffle breakfast"
,,"You love walking , hey it is top of the trees",5.0,,"You love walking , hey it is top of the trees so please do not miss. let your body and soul rejuvenate by nature"
,,Walking the Southern Ridges shows how accessible nature is in Singapore,4.0,,"Walking the trail connecting the Southern Ridges is a great way of appreciate how accessible nature is in Singapore. The walk, which traverses the ridges of Keppel, Henderson and Kent hill, leads through forested landscape with views of the sea on one side and the city on the other.

The path is paved and comfortably graded allowing both the fit and not-so fit to enjoy walking together. It takes about 3-hours to walk the entire length but most just choose individual sections rather than the whole.

The intrepid who chose to wander off the path to explore adjoining areas will be rewarded with untouched corners of Singapore that hark to another era."
,,Very good place to relax,4.0,,"If you like nature, go for it. Really nice view and definitely a great way to just relax over a long walk. Worth every sweat and time."
,,Hit and steamy but a good day out,3.0,,"We decided to hVe a walk in amongst the trees up to Mount Faber and along Henderson Waves. Very well kept paths, The Waves themselves were impressive. Unfortunately the haze limited what would have been a wonderful view. Being Sungapore it was rather hot and we were very sweaty and uncomfortable as there is limited shade on the waves - would suggest an umbrella! Lots of stairs for those fitness bunnies or take the road if stairs aren't your thing! Had a lovely coffe up at Mount Faber Spud and Apron coffee shop.
Free shuttle bus from the cable car back to HarbourFront with a friendly driver.
Unfortunately the cable cars were closed for maintenance - next time!"
,,Escape from the city,5.0,,"We found the walk a great escape from the city. This is a great activity if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle and the malls. The views were awesome. The walk is pretty easy going. We walked later in the afternoon to escape the heat of the day and watched the sunset. We ended up at Vivo City for supper and caught a taxi from there, however you can exit the walk in a few places and easily catch a tax."
,,"Worth the visit, great walk",4.0,,"Great walk up amongst the nature in Singapore along the southern ridge line to see a different part of the city. Past the gondola and through the park great views, culture and atmosphere. The Henderson Waves are great. The transport back at the other end is a bit random but the bus drivers are very helpful to get you back to the train station."
,,Great walk,4.0,,Great walk with much of it high up on a boardwalk in the trees. There are several places to start and end but it is not a loop so depending if you go by car or public transport you may have to retrace your steps.
,,One of the best walks in Singapore,5.0,,"This is one of my favourite walks in Singapore. Walking along the tree tops and up the hill, then up to mount faber and the Henderson wave is absolutely amazing. One of our favourite activities to do with our more outdoorsy friends."
,,Great Place for a Run,4.0,,"I run there whenever I can make it. It's usually quite quiet and it's a good escape from our urban jungle. If you start from Alexandra road you can make it all the way to Henderson Bridge, Mt Faber and eventually Vivo City. Along the way you get the serenity of forest from tree top level, and great sunset view from Henderson Bridge. However, as the sun sets, groups of teens with alcohol start showing up at the bridge so I won't recommend staying too late if you are with young children. Bring enough fluids."
,,Take a break from the urban jungle,5.0,,Great place for walking and enjoying the scenery with 3 different walking trails. Take about 1 to 1.5 hours to complete the track. Not very difficult; making it ideal for families to visit.
,,Interesting walk through some of Singapore's lesser seen areas,5.0,,"Nice day trip to visit a few of the interesting locations in Singapore WW2 history and more that could take around 4 hours or more if you do the whole ridge from Kent Ridge to Mount Faber and view the sights along the way, eg Reflections at Bukit Chandu, Hort Park etc. Do bring along a cap, some drinking water and maybe a small umbrella as some stretches are not sheltered."
,,Amazing view.,4.0,,"Amazing!! This is absolutely the best spot to go for a hike in Singapore. Clean, fresh air and beautiful view. Just make sure that you wear comfortable shoes and bring your own water bottle."
,,Not much of an escape,3.0,,"If you want a long walk close to the city, this is the place to do it, and there are a few interesting things along the way like jungles and hortpark. However, at every spot, the sound of birds is drowned out by the sound of traffic, industry, constructing and lawnmowing. There's also not a lot of shade along the trail. Signage is poor, too, with some signs pointing 90 degrees away from the correct direction and a lot of unmarked turns, where you end up at a dead end if you take the wrong one. Probably great for jogging if you live here but not much as a tourist attraction."
,,Great Walk,4.0,,This is a great walk but make sure that you talk water with you. Lots of different things to see including rainforest with canopy walks.
,,One of Singapore's most beautiful hidden treasures for nature lovers and bird watchers,5.0,,"I never knew about its existence until a friend brought me there. The Telok Blangah southern bridge. Built among the last remaining natural trees indigenous to Singapore, one can observe beautiful singing birds. Enjoy a fantastic view of some of the skyline of asingapore hardly seen by many tourist! I thouroughly reccommend this hike or walk it really captures the older Singaporés once common population of birds in nature. Today, the bird species and population are massively dwindling . One off the last chances of observing local tropical birds in nature!"
,,"Lovely walk above the trees, from Hort to Mt Faber.",5.0,,"Best in the early morning, start from Hort Park and get up the SR. It ends near Vivocity, where a steep flight of steps will lead you to the megamall that is across the road. The walk is safe, clean and very well maintained. It is one of NParks' best project."
,,NOT THE SINGAPORE YOU KNOW,5.0,,"We started from Mount Faber and started the track, it was easy and well signposted. We had a great day out walking/tracking/hiking through the The Southern Ridges. Surprisingly we hardly come across many people nor tourist along the way. It was very enjoyable walking through the different theme and well designed paths. Definitely worth doing when you are in Singapore - how many shopping malls does one need? This is your escape and a sanctuary from the city!"
,,Urban Jungle!,4.0,,"Southern Ridges is a trail that spans three parks across southern Singapore: Mount Faber, Telok Blangah Hill Park, and the Kent Ridge Park. The trail is located literally in an urban jungle; with fantastic bridges over city roads connecting the various paths set along tree tops. During my visit, it seemed that it’s mostly local residents who where traversing the trail as some were friendly enough to greet me in the early morning, as if knowing that I was there just visiting. What a great way to start the day!

The trails are easily accessible by metro and bus as mentioned by previous reviewers. Since I was short on time, I started at Labrador Park MRT and made my way to Harbour Front. This may be actually easier, as you don’t have to walk uphill on uneven terrain at Marang Trail. Try to arrive at around 7:00 AM at Labrador Park MRT to catch the golden morning light at the Henderson Waves, the highest pedestrian walkway in Singapore. The views and the light are fantastic! It took me around two hours to get to the Harbour Front MRT Station, where a hawker center and the VivoCity mall are located nearby.

After your walk, consider a visit to the awesome Haw Par Villa which is only a few stations away on the MRT Circle Line."
,,Easy way to enjoy nature,5.0,,A good walk without the scare of the jungle (and mosquito). Easily accessible by bus 195 from Queenstown MRT or Harborfront MRT
,,Loved every minute of it!!!,5.0,,"This is a must do in Singapore, specially if you like hiking. Bring mosquito repellent and something to keep yourself hydrated. The walk is peaceful; it wasn't crowded at all. Beautiful views and very interesting for architecture lovers like me. Loved it!!!!"
,,top of the world.,5.0,,"Get to the top to see the beautiful scenery...on a clear day . A well-preserved area, beautiful park and spectacular trees."
,,A different Singapore,5.0,,"A rare chance to see a very different singapore. Spend a day away from the concrete jungle and immerse yourself into this southern ridges of nature exhibits. You can start from kent Ridge park and end up at Vivocity.

A must try for all tourists coming to Singapore. And its Free!!"
,,Escape the city but not the heat,3.0,,"The walking trail along the Southern Ridges is a great way to escape the crowds of Singapore. It is possible to walk from Harbour Front via Mount Faber, Telok Blangar Park, Hort Park, Kent Ridge and eventually West Coast Park. That is, however, a lot of walking especially if not used to Singapore's climate.
Accessibility is good, and signage adequate for navigation. Exepect steps and steep inclines. Also expect great views over the Central Business District and Pasir Panjang Port.
For me, the best part is between Mount Faber (home to the Singapore Cable Car) and Kent Ridge MRT station. Refreshments can be found at Hort Park along the way. Just check the weather before you go. Shelters are few and far between and the rain can be.... tropical!
Other essentials to take: Drinking Water, Sun Cream, Umbrella and Insect Repellant."
,,A different side of Singapore =) Hikers and tramping enthusiasts welcome.,5.0,,"If you are wondering what to do in Singapore, a morning spent walking along the trails here is well-spent. I would recommend ending your walk at HarbourFront so you can hop over to Seah Imm Food Centre or VivoCity for lunch."
,,An interesting walk,5.0,,This trail was very enjoyable. We took the cable car to Mt Faber then started the trail from there crossing the Henderson Waves bridge.
,,Great jogging path !,5.0,,This is a great place to jog in a 'trail' so to speak. There are some points of gradual elevation (mount faber and other hills) which can provide a good challenge and the views are great! Not to mention its close to many great food choices after your run to refuel.
,,"Long, winding paths through lush greenery.",5.0,,"My wife and I strapped on our walking shoes, packed a bottle of water and gave this a go. The scenery was stunning and was all the better for having arrived by cable car further down the hill!

If you try and cover the whole distance, you will be VERY sweaty by the end of your trip but well worth it to find another of the 5 Merlions placed around Singapore."
,,Not quite a remote as hoped!,4.0,,"This trail is a good way to (partly) escape the city and the bridges themselves are interestingly built and offer great views into the greenery. However, they do not take you that far from civilisation as the bridges are over roads and past buildings so you never really feel like you've left the city behind. Also the parts of the path away from the bridges themselves are often beside the road or multiple car parks which doesn't aid a feeling of getting away from it all!"
,,Walking above the tree tops,5.0,,This is a unique experience of having the walk above the tree tops . This is absolutely enthalling being able to see the beauty of the greenery from the height . Mind blowing . One can take a long walk or short - there are easy ways to get off point . Ver very enthalling . The maintenance is superb . Do not miss it . Would recommend it highly .
,,"A real Walk in the Park, Within an Urbanised City!",4.0,,"If you love outdoors, nature and tree top walks, this is the place to go, which stretches to various areas of the Southern Ridges, including a nice city view on Mount Faber as well. It is easily accessible by MRT or by car, or if you have money to spare, Cable Car as well. Bring good walking shoes, and water, and a cap and enjoy the long walk."
,,Urban forest walk,4.0,,Easy to reach by local bus. We walked all the way from canopy bridge to the beach front mrt (maybe 5k). We ate lunch at top of the hill next to the cable car station. Route was nice and not very crowded.
,,"Great views, suggest early morning.",4.0,,"We stared from Mt Faber Park and walked for about an hour before the heat got us and we headed back to Mt Faber.

Very easy walking, with great views and lush vegetation. The Henderson Waves section got to me because I don't like heights and it is very high! You can also look through the gaps in the decking at the ground below. I just don't do heights and walked over quickly.
We walked back to Mt Faber as It got to hot for us and then headed to Vivocity shopping centre and cooled down and did some shopping. A great day and enjoyed us all."
,,Great nature trail,5.0,,What a great walk with some awesome bridges by some great architects. It's a full day of out door beauty in the city with some great views.
,,A Very Long Walk,3.0,,"First of all, you need to be really fit to complete this walk. I would say it's a 7-8km walk that will take up around 2-3 hours of your life. I prefer to start at Harbourfront, ending at Kent Ridge, because there's a food court at Harbourfront to stock up on your energy. Make sure to bring a lot of water, the only place to refill is at Hort Park, halfway into the walk. If you're a jogger, then maybe from Kent Ridge to Harbourfront is the preferred route as there's a lot of climbing required from Harbourfront to Mt Faber. There are a lot of rest stops along the way, and in certain areas they are shaded. But if it rains, you're going to get wet. Bring along a camera to get the views."
,,I had no idea...,5.0,,"I've been living in Singapore for the last 2 years and I had no idea these beautiful trails existed. My son visited from America and told me we had to visit -- he was so right!

We started by taking the cable-car from Harbourfront MRT to the top of Mt. Faber, from there we walked a criss-crossing of trails to Alexandra Street and beyond. We did the Henderson wave, the Forest Walk, the Canopy Walk, visited the horticultural gardens. My pocket GPS said we covered more than 10Km of walking, and all in the middle of forests with great trees, flowers, and wildlife (beautiful birds). A great experience.

The terrace gardens were lovely.

Bring water and sunscreen.... this is Singapore."
,,Great walking activity,5.0,,"Be prepared to WALK. Wear comfortable shoes and don't look down if you are afraid of heights. I loved hearing the birds in the trees eventhough they were hard to spot. It is difficult to think that you are in the middle of a sprawling city. It is quiet and peaceful as you walk through the tropical jungle. It is only when you get the odd glimpse of buildings peeping through a clearing in the trees, that you realise you are in the city."
,,splendid views,4.0,,"a walk through jungle environments with occasional views down onto Singapore, particularly from the notable bridges. A great way to experience the contrasts of the real jungle set against the backdrop of the urban jungle."
,,I got lost,3.0,,"Signage was lacking but hopefully was only due to construction works blocking some paths. Be prepared to return to the starting point as is hard to find an exit to public transport along the way.
Watch out for monkeys. Was taking a photo and they tried to get into my backpack."
,,Stunning walk through surprising Singapore,5.0,,"The walk from Kent Ridge MRT station to Harbour Front is three hours of easy walking and is a little known treasure we discovered through local friends. Forget Orchard Road and see tropical birds, stunning views, incredible bridges and lush rainforest. Take water and wear comfortable clothing and a hat. Finish at Harbour Front in the food court for a delicious lunch. Unbeatable."
,,Lovely walk,4.0,,This route offers a lovely slow meander among Singapore's southern hills... as you walk from treetops to hill sides and over the top into the valleys. A very nice way to spend a dry and not too hot late afternoon into the evening cool.
,,Nothing special,2.0,,"I visited Southern Ridges last weekend and it was pretty dissappointing... Theres really nothing special about it. I would rather do MacRitchie reservoir. The walk is kind of boring with a lot of concrete roads, and the bridge is pretty cool... but it s just one bridge... not worth it. theres much better in singapore"
,,Nice scenic walk,5.0,,Really enjoyable walk through some beautiful areas of Singapore. Some great views. take your camera along
,,great walk with beautiful views,5.0,,"Walked the ridges from Kent Ridge (easy access by MRT) to Harbourfront and were treated to beautiful views, lush greenery and amazing architecture (Henderson waves bridge). Stopped at the top of Mt Faber for a quick lime juice to refresh. Thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommended if you want a break from the hustle and bustle of the city."
,,Amazing views but very hot,4.0,,"I took the bus 124 from Chinatown, it takes you close to the Henderson Wave. Amazing view, very good signs, you cannot get lost (at least until the Canopy Walk, I got lost there). The walk from Henderson Wave to Canopy Walk was about 4hrs. I went for this walk at noon, saw about 10 people en route. Very peaceful.

It is very HOT and there's some climbing, so be prepared. Sun got me off guard and I got a headache despite a scarf, water and breaks."
,,A stroll in the sky,5.0,,"Explore Singapore from another perspective: take a stroll on a suspended bridge that brings you through the jungle's branches until the gentle hills of Mount Faber, with breathtaking view of the city and its southern skyline and amazing artistic curves at Henderson Waves."
,,Stunning Walk,5.0,,"We walked the Southern Ridges walk all the way to Mount Faber and then on to Harbourfront. The walk is truly beautiful and is mostly on suspended steel walking tracks high above the forest floor offering great view of both the spectacular greenery and glimpses of the city in the background. There is also the odd 'black and white' mansion, great examples of older Singaporean architecture. We didn't see any monkeys on our walk but apparently you usually do! We ended our walk with lunch at Vivi City Mall - lots of options to choose from..."
,,My favourite walk in Singapore,5.0,,"I usually start at Kent Ridge Park, accessible by MRT to Kent Ridge, and walk through the many lovely bridges to Hort Part and then on to Mount Faber. The walk/run is 7-8 km each way but is mostly flat and is nicest in the early mornings and evenings. The views of the gardens and secondary forest are great and there aren't usually too many people about so you can enjoy a quiet walk. At night, some of the bridges are lit and are an attraction in themselves."
,,Worth the walk,4.0,,"This made me fall in love with Singapore again. The walk stretches between HarbourFront MRT/Mt Faber and Kent Ridge Park and will take you through quiet greenery, past great views and along interesting bridges and walkways. The best thing about the walk to me was the diversity – it feels like you are covering different areas on the way. Bring plenty of water and avoid the middle of the day when the temperatures are peaking."
,,Great walk!,4.0,,"If you are in good shape, you can do the entire thing in one day. Otherwise, divide the walk into a couple days. Mornings are better since it is cooler."
,,Southern Ridges,5.0,,"If you are found of walking long distances on rough and tough terrian Then this Walk of more then 6 Kms will be refreshing both for your body and mind. Starting from Vivo City , cross the Road and on other side you have a tough exotic wood trail to reach the top. Go to left to visit Trolley station,Faber Mount Park,wave bridge, wood walk,more than 2 kms bridge walk to reach Kent ridge . Very beautiful experience worth the calories you will burn on this Trail.Found of walking must go for this Trail."
,,Escape to the country,5.0,,"We've visited Singapore many times so decided to do something different this time; we walked through the Southern Ridges to Mount Faber Park. We started at the Kent Ridge Canopy walkway, continueing through the Hortpark across the Alexandra Arches, through Telok Blangah park across the Henderson Waves, and through Mount Faber park to the cable car.
It was a brilliant way to experience Singapore; the walk way traverses jungle, woodlands and cultivated gardens along with several themed gardens. It was a hot walk so we appreciated the many shelters set out with drinking fountains and toilets.
We enjoyed the engineering feats and design of the Alexandra Arches and Henderson Waves, and were grateful to come at last to the restaurants at the cable car station! If you're not used to the Singapore heat this is quite strenuous, many uphill sections, but well worth the effort. Apparently you can see monkeys on some sections, but not during our visit."
,,Good Hike With Views To Boot!,4.0,,"This offers a good hike for those who want to be close to nature. It connects several parks in Western Singapore together, and walking from end to end will take about 3 hours.

The trial is suspended high above the roads at some points, which affords you a great view of Singapore's Southern Coastline and surrounding neighborhoods.

However, you need not traverse through the whole trial. Just start from any where in between and when you are tired, just go to the main road and get on public transport."
,,A different side of Singapore,5.0,,"We really enjoyed our walk around the Southern Ridges.
It provides great views of both the strait & the city.
We didn't want to go for a long walk so we caught a taxi to Mount Faber peak (where the cable car ends) and walked from there to the Henderson Wave bridge. It's all downhill, so an easy walk. We then flagged down a taxi at Henderson Rd.
Would recommend for early morning or early evening to avoid the hotter parts of the day."
,,Not for first-time tourists,4.0,,This is a great place for nature lovers but I'd probably not recommend it for first-time travelers to Singapore unless you love outdoor walking.
,,A nice walk and great views,4.0,,Worth going to if you're in town for long enough. Some great views of the city and a great place to escape the urban jungle. Bring a long lens for the views.
,,Back to Nature and in the midlle of suburbia,5.0,,"Fantastic nature walk on the top of Mt Faber. Birds, even monkeys and surrounded by incredible vegetation. Peaceful, serene and not a long walk at all, but a late afternoon or earlier morning walk would be good times of the day to enjoy this."
,,Awesome Place for some Outdoor Exercises,5.0,,"Began the walk from Harbour Front MRT station Exit D, which leads to Marang Trail according to the signboard. There are quite some climbing involved at the beginning, but the view on top is awesome. Once you reach the top, there is just a short distance to the cable car station. It is alright to spend some good time there looking at the wishing bells hanging everywhere nearby the restaurant beside cable car station. You can buy wishing bells at the souvenir shop and make a wish too. The next destination that you could reach is Henderson Waves. The view is nice up there, with the buildings surrounded by trees. It is also a nice place to rest and have some light snacks as the ""wave"" is actually some sort of mini shelter. Overall it is an awesome place with the tracks built right beside the trees and you can even see birds if you are lucky enough. However please spare plenty of time for the visit if you wish to explore the entire Southern Ridges as the journey could be quite time consuming and it is not very accessible to MRT stations (if you are not really familiar with the buses, just like me who always rely on MRT heavily) unless you are willing to walk all the way to return to Harbour Front MRT station. I was so nervous as the time is approaching to my flight but I was still miles away from the airport and I need to grab my bag which was still placed in the hostel I stayed, and I finally found an exit near Alexandra Arch, which is 900m away from nearest MRT station (Labrador MRT)."
,,Take the time to enjoy this walk,5.0,,"We did what other reviewers suggested and took a taxi to Mt. Faber as the weather was very warm and humid. There is a cafe here for a cooling drink before you explore this area. You can enjoy the view of the harbour and city and see the bridge road to Sentosa Island.
This nature reserve was such a relaxing contrast to Singapore City life and seemed under utilised on the day we visited. The Henderson Waves is an amazing pedestrian bridge perched between two hills. The architecture is quite beautiful and the construction over the 300metres is to be admired.
There is a forest walkway, lots of bird life and small animals visible. It was good to have rest areas as the heat and humidity can be taxing.
We decided to walk down from Mt. Faber as it wasn't difficult and crossed the road at the bottom to the Vivo shopping centre where there is an excellent food court and juice bar on the 3rd floor."
,,a 9 km long trail where forest meets high-rises in the Southern ridge of Singapore,4.0,,"Singapore is putting much efforts into preserving its forest and make the city as green as possible. The Southern Ridges one of the results of that strategy.

The Southern Ridges trail consists of 4 parks stretching across the western half of Singapore, with bridges allowing pedestrians to cross busy highways. Several parts of the trail are suspended high above the jungle. This gives a surprising view of the ultra-modern city and how it starts to be integrated into what the green areas that remain."
,,We love this walk,5.0,,There is not a lot of places in the world where you can commune with nature right in the city without having to worry about safety. The Singapore government (we are a big fan) really put a lot of planning (foresight) and resources to bring city living to a different level by providing easy access to green spaces. It's so mores wife how they thought about connecting all these green spaces with tree top walkway. The early morning walk is very pleasant as you hear all sorts of birds calling each other for feeding time. You can see squirrels and monkeys.
,,Just do it!,5.0,,Great walk. Be prepared take water - although you can top up along the way. Gives you a different view of Singapore. Wished I had more time to explore the parks along the way. Do take time out to visit Reflections Bukit Chandu museum located at the end of the Canopy Walk.
,,Cool walk!,5.0,,Excellent way to see Southern Singapore skyline. The sea was filled with ships and we saw plentiful trees among the tall buildings. Can be very hot. We were lucky with a shower (got wet!) but refreshing.
,,Extend it to the full stretch!,5.0,,"The whole area from kent ridge in the west all the way over to harbor front is a lovely stretch of parks and walks, over bridges, through firsts, along green house and on top of several canopy walks. Explore the nature and spot different birds, animals and plants you may have never seen before. The southern ridges are especially nice for the long walk on the metal structure high above the ground and over the wavey bridge even higher above one of the big streets. Highly recommend to walk through the whole area - a roughly 2 hours walk."
,,A nice enough walk,3.0,,"A nice enough, if sweaty, walk with a few interesting things on the way (host park, Henderson waves bridge). Fine if you have time to fill, but lots more interesting things to do/see in Singay"
,,Surprise in a city,4.0,,Lovely walk on excellent pathways with some great views. We walked for a couple hours then caught the bus back to Vivo City Mall. All very easy to do & gives a very fresh and peaceful prospective of this lovely city.
,,Nature Escape in the heart of singapore,5.0,,"didn't know what to expect when we started the walk from reflections at Bukit Chandu, but we were blown away. Amazing jungle scenery, treetop strolling for hundreds and hundreds of metres, hortpark was very nice and the interesting views of the city made this a top walk."
,,Excellent Trekking experience,5.0,,"Excellent trekking experience overlooking half of Singapore.
Must remember to bring a towel and a full bottle of water.
Long 2-3 hour Hike in the urban-inistic tree tops !
If you walk towards the end at Mount Faber, you can take the train (MRT) at Habourfront back to where you need to be."
,,Awesome Hiking place,5.0,,"The southern ridges is all time favorite for hiker either you are beginner or experienced hiker, the experience is awesome."
,,The Henderson Waves makes it,4.0,,This walk is all worth while once you hit the Henderson waves. The walk itself was very nice with a much more jungle like atmosphere than I have experienced in Singapore before. Plan your route a bit before you go as the signs and maps aren't as frequent as you may hope!
,,Nice view,4.0,,Great place to go for a fresh morning walk. Level of difficulty i would rate 2.5/5. Great to go with family.
,,Rare green belt ...,4.0,,"Get yourself a pair of comfortable walking shoes, light clothing, hat with plenty of water to remain hydrated during the trekking. Insect repellent is advisable when enter the greenery of the belt."
,,The elderly should consider taking a taxi,5.0,,"We commenced our walk from the Harbourside MRT station, which probably was a mistake, as the first half mile involved climbing about a million stairs in humidity so intense my suntan lotion slid right off my face. My wife was whining like a British Airways jet full of Poms by the time we reached the top. When I saw the road to the cable car entry I wished we had taken a taxi to the top and commenced our walk from the end of the loop. From there, it is an easy walk to the Henderson Wave, which is an architectural marvel well worth the effort. I agree with all the praise heaped on this free facility by other reviewers. I simply wanted to caution the more geriatric among us that this is not so much a walk as a fight for your life!"
,,Stunning views!,5.0,,"Our journey along the Southern Ridges took us from Kent Street MTR to Vivo City. This walk isn't for the faint hearted, it involves some large climbs and many sets of stairs in some lovely SIngapore humidity.

The first few kilometres isn't as spectacular as the final but still worth it if you are up for it. Once you reach the final stages after Hort Park you will be in for a surprise.

The tree top walks and bridges are world class and the view are spectacular."
,,Bundled it with a visit to SENTOSA,4.0,,"One of the Singapore's landmark, Henderson wave bridge is here. The walk along the whole Southern ridge will take about 1 to 2 hours. View from the top of Singapore highest bridge is amazing. Do visit if time allow you to."
,,tree top,5.0,,must go if you stay a little more in city. Its formed by 3 or 4 parks in south of singapore. It is a tree top trail that you can go from Hort to Mount Faber. Fabulous place for pic nic. If you like nature this place is fantastic.
,,Breathtaking view,5.0,,"Long walk from Hort Park, but interesting , beautiful and refreshing walk all the way . Feel of nature around with the many birds and beetle singing."
,,what a view,5.0,,"could not believe this was in the middle of Singapore. absolutely stunning. BUT make sure you take HAT, WATER, GOOD SHOES. its a LONG walk - longer that what we thought. but sooo worth it. the views, and the jungle canopy over some of the walk and the wave bridge is stunning - almost scary - to me anyways whos scared of heights but did it- we started at Reflections at Buki Chandu - very moving 2nd world war remembrances. then did the meandering walk along Kent Ridge - so lovely and intimate - and then thru Hort Park and then followed the paths and signs and went along the elevated walkways amongst the jungle canopy and the wave bridge. signs about monkeys, but we didn't see any :( took a few hours in all. so really plan it for the day and take plenty of water and snacks. we had water but no food, and were real cranky at the end hahaha but SOOO WORTH IT. MOST AMAZING THING TO DO IN SINGAS !!!!!! jungles and wildlife - beautiful birds - in down town Singapore"
,,Great trail,4.0,,"We walked the Southern Ridges trail starting from the Faber Mountain area down to the waterfront. It was fabulous 6 mile walk through the rainforest areas just outside of the city, down into the city and across to the water. It was a great way to take a break from all the people and get some really great views."
,,A Sunday Wslk,4.0,,"Often we select an MRT station and see what there is to do around the area, this time it was Kent Ridge, which is the gateway to the Southern Ridges, a walk that covers Kent Ridge Park, Hort Park, the Henderson Waves and mount Faber Park.

The walk himself is about 10k and offers great scenery in the parks. Much of the walk is on elevated gantries so you have a birds eye view of the rainforest.

Singapore does park connectors very well.

At the end of the walk you can drop down into vivocity for a beer / lunch, well earned"
,,Great for nature lovers,5.0,,If you have a nature bug in you then its worth the visit. Filed with trees and a lot of the trail goes thru these raised pathways which make you gel line you walking over the forest rather than thru it. Should have just been painted green so it should camouflage better
,,A must do in Singapore,4.0,,"We loved the tree top walk, with terrific views and nature all around you. A really relaxing and pleasant way to experience Singapore away from the multitude of shopping malls."
,,Relaxing walk through the interesting bridges and sights of SG,5.0,,"I'm a Singaporean and we are sometimes bored by the endless number of malls and lack of scenery there are here. But the Southern Ridges is an amazing walk that can be done in half a day.

I usually start from Mt faber (Harbourfront MRT) then walk follow the signs. You will pass by the Henderson Waves, Forest Walk, Alexandra Arch and Hort Park. You can go on but I usually end at Hort park and take a bus elsewhere to a nearby MRT station.

Bring some sunblock, cap and some food to picnic on the bridges and parks."
,,"Surprising nature walk and terrific bridges, like the Henderson Wave",5.0,,"The downtown of Singapore can be overwhelming as the buildings are so gigantic and so plentiful. The perfect antidote is the Southern Ridges walk. You get terrific views and nature in abundance, grasses, forests, and scenic views of the city and the waterfront of Sentosa, all just minutes from major roads and transit. Don't miss this view of a wonderful city."
,,"Great idea, amazing experience, a must do when in Singapore",5.0,,"What a great idea to have a trail like this in the middle of the city - Retrospectively, we would recommend to start from Mount Faber, go down to Henderson waves bridge and down the trail to Alexandra road - A MUST do when in Singapore and this is for free!!!"
,,More people need to know about this,5.0,,"I'm a Singaporean but I've only done this a few weeks before. More people, even locals, need to do this!

Here's how I did my walk:

Get to Harbour Front MRT exit D, walk to Seah Im Food Centre and locate Marang Road along the stretch. It leads you to the steps and that's where you start towards Mount Faber.

Follow signs for Mount Faber > Henderson Waves > Forest Walk > Alexandra Arch > Hort Park.

I took a 10 mins bus opposite Hort Park back to Seah Im and Harbour Front MRT.

The hardest part of this walk is the steps up towards Mount Faber at the beginning. My favourite part is definitely Forest Walk. The whole walk took less than 3 hours but it was dark when I did mine so there was nothing much to see and I didn't stop along the way. There's a map in Hort Park showing you how you can continue your walk further if you'd like. So start your walk early to see more nature!"
,,Great views and picture opportunities,4.0,,This trail provided some amazing photo opportunities. Each section of the trail was different and unique. I loved how they had descriptions and pictures of the wildlife you can see along the way. The sections with the workout equipment was pretty cool too. I will say that the Henderson Waves looks much better in pictures than when you're actually on it. The forest walk was our favourite part. You're pretty high up in the forest among some giant trees and there was so much wildlife present. The birds were very loud and gave you the nature feel that we were looking for. Great walk. It is not a difficult walk at all.
,,"If you want to do the entire walk, go early in the day",5.0,,"We only had so much time in Singapore (5 nights) and this walk was definitely on my list. Unfortunately we didn't get there until afternoon and decided to do it at the last minute when we changed our mind about taking the cable car to Sentosa and took it to Mt. Faber instead. It's an easy walk downhill to the entrance of the park from the cable station - you basically turn left when you get downstairs from the cable station and follow the road. The entrance is on the right. The Henderson Wave Bridge is not too far down the trail. We actually went quite a distance and went most of the way through the Forest Walk, which is a metal canopy walk. I feel like a broken record when I keep saying take plenty of water (preferably electrolyte - I used tablets that I brought with me everywhere). There was at least one tap for water along the way that we saw."
,,Nature in the city,5.0,,"The southern ridges were easily accessible with the MRT, station Habourfront. These natural parks are very well laid out and very well maintained.
There we made a nice hike. There were great views of Sentosa Island and the harbor. Very nice was the bridge Henderson Waves."
,,Nature at its best,5.0,,"The Sourthern Ridges are a must see when in Singapore. The nature is stunning and the walkways are easy and accessible for all. Highlights for me were the Canopy walk, the Forest Walk and the stunningly beautiful architecture of the Henderson Waves. We started out at Mount Faber and ended our journey at the Canopy walk. In distance not so far, but it took us some time, because we stopped many times to take pictures and take in the beautiful landscape."
,,Nature in the city,5.0,,"We were astounded by the rugged beauty of our hike in the southern ridges, We had no idea Singapore, that quintessentially urban place yet retained within its city limits so much seemingly pristine nature."
,,Nice walk!!!,4.0,,Nice short escape from the city. Ideal place for a evening stroll and breathe in some fresh air. Should start the walk from Alexandra park instead of Mt Faber.. its much better!!!
,,Peaceful escape from the city,5.0,,"Amazing place to go if you want to relax with a view over the business district from behind, can walk up at a leisurely pace in about 15 minutes from HarbourFront MRT, otherwise I think there are semi regular buses going up to the top of mount Faber, the waves are beautiful to walk across"
,,Don't forget to bring a bottle of water!,5.0,,Perfect for those who want to escape the city and take long walks. Not recommendable for those who are afraid of heights. The best part for me is the Henderson Waves. You have to see it for yourself.
,,Urban escape,4.0,,"It is relatively easy to escape most of the urban sprawl of Singapore by taking the MRT to the HarbourFront Station and taking a 10 minute walk up a significant number of steps which leads you to the start of the southern end of the Southern Ridges Trail. There are a couple of bridges on the walk of memorable architectural merit. Although the walking is paved throughout, there are several significant uphill sections but nothing that couldn't be normally undertaken by people of average fitness. There are views along most of the trail, admittedly some of high rise apartments but some of a more rural nature. Apart from an expensive full restaurant there are only vending machines for soft drinks available so it is wise to take your own water and snacks. Although the total of the distance of the walk varies depending on which report you read and may be from 6 1/2 to 10 kilometres if one doesn't wish to complete the entire trail there are several points where it is possible to exit, either close to an MRT or a local bus stop. There is no charge for using the trail and the direction signs are informative"
,,Parks in Singapore,5.0,,Southern ridges is a must see and explore in Singapore. This trail consists of four parks and bridges overlooking the city. I'm sure everyone who loves the outdoors will certainly love this as much as I did :)
,,"Breezy, well lit, safe, and relaxing stroll to do at night.",5.0,,"This paved and well lit attraction is a nice walk along the top of the Southern Ridges in Singapore. It wasn't crowded and it has some nice views of downtown. The trail is unique because it connects to a series of ""treetop"" walkways that gradually snake around. There are several distinct areas from Faber Hill to Henderson Waves to the Treetop walks. The path is well marked and you can easily track your progress on Google Maps. Start at Harbourfront, Vevo City and head to Faber Hill Park. Check it out if you want something more relaxing. I like it because I hate shopping malls."
,,Parkland naturally impressive,5.0,,"Easy to get to with the MRT. Signage a little baffling but once you are on your way, it is a nice way to pass your day. Be prepared for the steep climbs and steps but well worth it. At times, we were so high above the trees on the walkways it was breathtaking. Strange to be in amongst trees and nature but then get glimpses of homes nestled on the outskirts, large accommodation blocks and building not so far away and the ships in the distant ports. Not much wildlife at all to see. Just the trees and plants. Henderson Wave Bridge was so impressive and another architecture masterpiece.
Faber Park was nice and the Singapore Cable Car was accessible there if you wanted to purchase a ride. Very impressive building with restaurants and nice surrounding areas. The cable car ride was expensive but would have been worth it, I think, as it was so high above everything and very lengthy.
Don't forget to bring water to drink as it gets hot and some sections there was no shade and long distances between amenities.
Nice parkland to see on the outskirts of the main hustle and bustle of Singapore."
,,A trip through some of the greenest stretches in Singapore,4.0,,"I did the entire stretch right from Kent Ridge Park till the base of Mt. Faber finishing off in the Harbourfront MRT station. The initial climb on the steep inclines of Kent ridge was a bit tiring. But thereafter the walk is rejuvenating as you pass through the canopy walk, hort park, Alexandra Arch and the Forest walk. This takes you to the Telok Blangah hill park. From here one gets access to the Henderson Waves, a good piece of architecture. This leads to the Mt. Faber trail and finally the Marang trail which will bring you down to the Harbourfront station. One can also cover the trail in installments, as it maybe a bit too hectic."
,,Great Workout while taking in sights of the unseen Singapore,5.0,,Done the whole stretch of walk starting from near the World Trade Centre. A great experience. Different parts of the walk you see different parts of Singapore and many Singaporeans doing different work outs. Kind of a meaningful mini eco-tourism even for a local. Gets hot in mid morning so best to start the day early and enjoy the cooling environment.
,,An easy walk through the southern ridges,5.0,,"This is a walk that I would recommend to anyone visiting Singapore. Catch the MRT to harbourfront and cross the road to find the steps that will take you to the ridge. This is the hardest part of the walk and if you don't want to walk the steps you could catch a cab. Once at the top of the steps you will find a great view of the city and Sentosa island. Walk up to the cable car station and check out the corny stuff, then continue down the road to the sine wave bridge. Continue walking to the wire bridges through the jungle. It's hard to believe you are so close to the city. And the bonus is that it's all free."
,,Escape the concrete!,4.0,,"A thoughtful and well designed walking route across the southern tip of Singapore, the Southern Ridges provide a welcome escape from the hustle and bustle of day to day Singapore. We started from Vivo City - if you want to avoid the first 15 minutes of uphill steps from this location you could easily take a taxi or cable car from the mall to the peak of Mount Faber. Until 11am the steps are largely in the shade. The route is well signposted, easy to follow and provides a wide variety of excellent views and innovative architecture on some of the walkways. The route is divided into distinctive sections allowing those who don't want to walk the whole distance to choose a portion to explore. There are toilets at regular intervals and plenty of seating at similar intervals, some with sun/rain protection. It's worth carrying your own water though there are a few vending machines. By chance we found the Vineyard restaurant in the Hort Park section that we would strongly recommend, see separate review. Due to new construction at the Kent Ridge end of the walk it's not so easy to find the route by the science park to the MRT, it's easy to get directions from passers by if needed."
,,Good views and architecture,5.0,,"Singapore residents might appreciate this more than tourists, but it is excellent an walk/hike with views of Singapore from the few peaks near Sentosa island. The peaks are connected by pedestrian bridges in different designs that are interesting in themselves. Start at Mount Faber and end at HortPark or vice versa, best at dusk between 6 and 7.30pm. Fit walkers will do it in less than an hour but there are plenty of spots to sit and enjoy the ambience if you want to extend the experience."
,,Great views of the city. Not to be missed for the scenery,4.0,,This is a walk not to be missed. It is not strenuous. Paths are nice and easy but bring lots of water and a hat as it gets very hot. The bridges are rally cool. You are walking on top if the trees along the mountain. Very impressive all the work they have done on creating this very interesting walk and park
,,a hidden gem,4.0,,"This was accessed from Harbor front on a bus 96 or 166 travelling towards S Jain ( where there is a school of global business management). There are at least 2 directions in which to walk from here, and best broken into 2 days. You can head inland on the raised walkways or walk under the walkway on a track to Henderson Waves and Mt Faber; or head south into Hort Gardens. On that route I came across Reflections of Bukit Chandu which is a museum which celebrates the role of the Malaysian regiments in defending Singapore, with good information about the fall of Singapore. Only cost $3 because I was over 60! From there it's possible to get a bus back to Harbor front from Pepys Rd where there is a locals food centre with great food."
,,Great walk amongst the treetops,5.0,,"This is a wonderful experience. A marvellous well maintained attraction which the Singapore parks department should be proud of. Specimen trees and excellent views of the harbour. Yet again this walk will recharge your batteries and allow you a relaxing time away from the traffic. A good pair of comfortable shoes is advisable, and you must have a reasonable level of fitness."
,,Great experience,4.0,,"I'm afraid of heights, so don't ask why I went for this. The trail itself is a treetop walk and it was awesome as it felt like you were walking in the air. Seriously, I don't know how to put this but the experience is amazing as we're so high up. Just don't look down. That's the only horrible part."
,,Back to my childhood,5.0,,"It's a place where I lived at as a child and I'm so glad they decided to enhance the park instead of constructing houses on it. There is a wild beauty to this area that is missing in the more centrally-located parks like Botanic Gardens and Gardens by the Bay. Less people, more foliage, more silence. The bridges make for a nice walk or run in good weather, and it isn't too strenous even for older folks. Toilets are available and are quite well maintained. From Telok Blangah MRT, it's about a 10 minute walk up the stairs to the Southern Ridges."
,,A concrete path rather than a country/forest walk...,3.0,,"It really isn't very exciting - unless you don't get out into the country much ;-)

It's a walk, but nothing more than that...

Henderson Wave bridge is worth seeing if you are there, but we wouldn't recommend you go out of your way to see it - it's just a bridge ;-)

Our recommendation would be not to waste your time and do something far more exciting instead! :-)"
,,A different way to spend time in Singapore,5.0,,"As I didn't fancy spending my few hours down time shopping on my business trip, I chose to do this on my one day off and I'm glad that I did. What a fantastic, and free, way to see a different side of Singapore.

The slight confusion for some is that this is, in fact, a series of connected walks through various parks that can take you from the outskirts to the harbour (or vice versa). Or you can chose to do one or two smaller sections of the walk. Get a tourist map first to have a look. Once you are there they are all reasonably well signposted.

As I fancied a decent stretch I chose to start at Kent Ridge Park and then walk towards Sentosa Island. This took me through several differently themed areas including beautifully manicured parks contrasting with rain forest that you can either walk through at ground level or at canopy height on elevated walk ways. If I remember correctly I did, in order:

Kent Ridge Park Canopy Walk
Floral Gardens
Alexandra Arch
Forest Walk
Hilltop Walk
Faber Walk
Marang trail and then down the hill to the harbour from which you look out on Sentosa.

This took me a couple of hours to walk, you could certainly do it quicker, and you could do it much more slowly if you have the time to amble and look in more detail at the well labelled flora and fauna.

Reasonably fit, I am glad that I had taken a bottle of water with me as the humidity was high, but there is plenty of shade to find on the way and there are many places to take a break as well. Incidentally, I did this on a Sunday morning and expected it to be full of people but it was not overly busy, just enough to nod and smile to, not too many to spoil it.

Glad I did this rather than two hours in an air conditioned shopping ""maul""!"
,,Walk amongst the tree tops,5.0,,A nice walk from Hort Park to the Henderson Wave. Takes about 1.5 hours in total (to get back to Hort Park).
,,Great walk,4.0,,Lovely walk and something different to do in Singapore if you have done all the other tourist things. Ask to start at Henderson Waves as our taxi driver didn't know where to drop us and we ended up walking for ages before we actually got on to the bridges.
,,Walk through the green belt of Singapore,5.0,,"We started at Holt Park which is in the tail end of the Southern Ridges Walk. The park is beautiful, and you walk through it to get the the Forrest Walk at the end. The Forest Walk and Henderson Waves are excellent and walking through the canapoy of forest within a city like Singapore is an amazing experience."
,,"Nice, but not exciting",3.0,,"Pictures make this walk look amazing...until you're up there and realize those professional pictures are a bit deceiving. Most views are accompanied by construction cranes.

Only wildlife we saw were two snakes and a squirrel. So all those warnings about monkeys seem to be for nothing.

Not very strenuous, so would be good for those who want a nature experience without truly hiking."
,,One of Singapore's best walking paths,4.0,,"The walk from Mt Faber via Telok Blangah Hill Park and Hort Park to Kent Ridge Park is an easy to follow path which is great if you're looking for somewhere to exercise away from the traffic. The canopy walk section in Kent Ridge Park is my favourite section, but the rest of the walk is also pretty good. As with all parks in Singapore it makes sense to go in the early morning or late afternoon in order to avoid the worst heat. Young children may find the full length a little daunting (or, more likely, you might as you end up carrying them!) but it's easy enough to break into segments. A side visit to Reflections at Bukit Chandu is worthwhile if you would like to know more about Singapore's WWII history."
,,Good morning walk,4.0,,"Good morning walk in southern ridges. Accessible by metro, walkable even with baby strollers or wheelchair. Not really so into-nature, but hey, in Singapore... very easy to follow route and lots to see."
,,Good exercise and great views,5.0,,"Walked from Hort Park to Mount Faber and down to Vivo City. Wonderful experience seeing a variety of birds, the odd lizard and a domestic cat ! Part of the walk is on an elevated walkway above the forest canopy. Its safe and virtually traffic free and also well signed. The gardens at Hort Park are definitely worth a visit.
Plenty of water needed and a slow pace. A brilliant few hours."
,,"Wow! This is not ""trekking"", this is a marriage of nature and engineering",5.0,,"Kent Ridge to VivoCity is about 4.6 miles of the most amazing ""nature trail"". The paths are in immaculate condition, the collection of bridges is spectacular beyond belief. There are innumerable toilet facilities along the way, as well as recreational and snacking places. Everything is signposted most diligently, the views are breathtaking, if the weather is friendly do spend a few hours ..."
,,What a Gem in an Otherwise Hectic City,5.0,,"Thank goodness my husband did the research and we started the walk from Mount Faber Park. The first 15 minutes involved a strenuous walk up numerous steps, but then the rest of the almost 8 kilometer walk was down hill or along well maintained paths and bridges. The views on this walk, the works of engineering and best of all the natural beauty was well worth the couple of hours spent away from the hassles of Singapore. There are plenty of well serviced toilet blocks, a few restaurants and several drink dispensing machines. Although we did not have coins and the notes did not seem to work. We did however find a machine that accepted our notes, so there was not need to carry water for the trip."
,,A walk in the park,5.0,,"Perhaps this is the closest thing Singapore has to trekking. The paths are well maintained, and even a sedentary person could climb up Mount Faber without too much difficulty. Hort Park is also a beautiful place, as a plant nursery. Visit Henderson Waves and the other bridges, which are magnificent works of art as well.

Take a photo of the map signboard before you start, though there are signboards at regular intervals and junctions.

Bring water and come in comfortable clothing."
,,Rejuvenating experience,4.0,,Take a walk through the lush greenery. The walkers get good views of various trees and plants and also a view of the sentosa island. Make sure you only take the correct path and not the route through the forests because there are many wrongly placed signboards here that may mislead you and eventually you may end up getting lost. Thats what happened to me and a few others as well
,,If you find gym boring come for a walk,5.0,,"We started our walk from Vivocity. You take exit D and on your left hand side starts the Marang trail. It is a bit steep but via steps so I didn't think it was too bad. You can see some colonial houses in the forest and some nice flowers. It doesn't take long and you find yourself at the top of Mount Faber. This is where you can go via car or the cable car. Then we took the covered walkway, Mount Faber walk. We reached Henderson Waves which is an interesting structure and a part of the walk which is completely open, no trees or cover at all. If sunny suncream and bottle of water is a must as it can get pretty hot up there. We then took the Forest Walk which is generally a very easy down the hill walk on metal walkway above trees. Not covered but we were lucky as the sun didn't shine then.
We finished our walk at the Alexandra Arch which is an interesting bridge above the Alexandra Road. I believe it lights up at night.
Mozzie repellent and a bottle of water is a must. This walk took us about 1.5 hours and we got pretty hot but enjoyed it never the less."
,,A must-do!,5.0,,"Absolutely loved this walk - we started at Hort Park and finished at Mount Faber. The park was beautiful, and we took lovely photos of the themed gardens. The gardeners working the vegetable plots were friendly and informative, sharing with us their knowledge of the plants.

The entire walk from Alexandra Arch up to the Henderson Waves was nice and calm. It was great fun for the little one walking on the canopy level of the forest. We didn't see any monkeys but heard plenty of birds. It's a great jogging trail for the sports lovers.

From the Henderson Waves to Mount Faber the scenery changes once more, and the walk terminated with a food and drink stop. The entire distance isn't overly long, but does require a reasonable amount of fitness. With the multiple stops for photos, we took about 2 hours (a lot of time spent at Hort Park). If you have young kids, you may need to take this into consideration.

There are several basic must-have items for this activity: walking shoes, water, hat/cap, sunscreen, umbrella (especially at the end of the year). Toilets along the way are free of charge. If you intend to purchase drinks from the vending machines along the way, bring coins too."
,,Great place for an evening hike,4.0,,"It is a creatively and cool idea to link the 3 hill ridges of Mt Faber, Telok Blangah Hill and Kent Ridge to form this 2-3hrs hiking trail. best time to visit is in the late afternoon so you can enjoy the sunset view on Henderson waves."
,,Good Walk,4.0,,"A Good walk and you need a fair amount of fitness. The Wave Bridge looks brilliant, and it is being painted at the moment. Just watching the painters hanging off the bridge over the road is worth a look!"
,,Wonderful walk and views of Singapore!,5.0,,"The walk from Mt Faber park to Kent Park and the canopy walk is simply amazing...walking through the Henderson walk is simply wonderful...not many people adventure here, just some locals jogging...but it is totally worth the visit...the forest walk, the flower walk and then the wonderful Hort park. It is all a wonderful green jewel in the middle of the city!"
,,Reverse Direction,5.0,,"We had completed the Southern Ridges about two years ago by starting at Kent Park MRT, but found the going quite tiring as it tended to be largely uphill. So this time we started at Mt.Faber and did the walk in reverse, so it was largely downhill, and what a difference. We were less exhausted which allowed us to enjoy the walk even more, especially the tree top section. We took a taxi from Harbourfront MRT to the Mt. Faber cable car station and commenced there."
,,great trail and worth the effort,5.0,,"Like some of the other reviewers have said, bring water, umbrella , some stamina and start early. It is very humid here. We had the taxi take us to the Henderson Wave bridge . (The hotel staff didn't recognize the term 'Southern Ridges'). This way you avoid the steep walk up to the Wave Bridge. From there it is very pleasant hike and not hard at all. We didn't see any monkeys although there were plenty of signs about how not to interact with them. Eventually, you will come across the cable car area which take you to Sentosa Island. We took this and you have an amazing view of the downtown area and the harbour. It is not for the faint of heart as it is very high. Also, don't go if it looks like rain. The rain is often fierce and accompanied by lightning. It wouldn't be pleasant! Sentosa is an entertainment area and looks great for children and teens. But for us, we looked around and took the cable car back. Then we carried on the trail and took the stairs down to the street level . It is long but not hard. Take your time. At the bottom, there is a MRT station there and we took it to downtown. The MRT is excellent and very easy to use. You go up to a ticket machine, press Map and then press the station, you want to go to. The price comes up and you put the money in and out pops the ticket. It is very cheap. We seemed to be the only non-Singaporeans every time we took the MRT and felt very comfortable. Everyone is polite and considerate. What a civilized place it is.When we were downtown, we took the water taxi back to our hotel. A very pleasant day."
,,Good Park Walk,5.0,,"Love it! Being there a few times but really need stamina to walk up the Mount Faber. Else take a bus ride to Hortpark from Harbout front mrt station and walk from there.

Enjoy the scenes and natural air. Cooling in the morning and evening but try not to go too late, otherwise it became too dark to walk the southern ridge. Lots of old people walk the ridge from Hortpark which is halfway walk.

Takes about 3-4 hours to walk from Mount Faber end to Hortpark. Further down is Kent Ridge park.

Bring food along and lots of water. Umbrella too just in case it rains or too hot. Hat and cap sound good."
,,Great walk,5.0,,"Definitely a must go.... you can start the trail at the hort singapore, walk true all the parks until the wave bridge that is just perfect.. and end up at the mount faber..."
,,Wanna burn more calories?,4.0,,"Great workout. Please take note of the following:

1. Please visit the Washroom before you set off (some clowns actually pee'ed over the fence)
2. Bring an umbrella, in case it rains. This is Singapore. The weather is as crazy as Kim Jong Un.
3. Water, water, water. Pointing to point 2. Yes, welcome to Singapore
4. Camers please. Lots of photo taking opportunities
5. Be in a comfortable attire. If need be, bring a sunblock lotion.
6. Enjoy yourself

Just take note. Singapore's weather is crazy. It rains now and the next minute, you will be baking under the hot sun. There are visitors who suffered from mild heat stroke (ain't that serious and I guess the guy was just dried up inside).

Avoid raining season (supposedly Nov to late Jan) and super hot season (supposedly May to July). Well, global warming, I suppose because the clouds and sun seems to be visiting as and when they like.

Have fun! Cheers!"
,,Fantastic Walk,5.0,,"Southern Ridges hike consists of several trails including Canopy Walk (16 m above the ground), Forest Walk (25 m high), Mount Faber, famous Henderson Waves Bridge, and more. You can start it from either side (Marang Trail or Canopy walk) and finish at an MRT station. Just the walk itself can easily take two hours but you can also divert and explore Hort Park, Kent Ridge Park, or Mount Faber with its own Merlion at the highest point and a great view. The trail is quite well marked in most parts (for the rest, just ask locals) and it's really one of the best walks in Singapore."
,,great walk - fantastic views and easy to follow,5.0,,"We started the walk at Kent Ridge Park. The route (which we downloaded onto a mini ipad) was easy to follow. The canopy walkway was brilliant - saw lots of birds (eg drongo, white crested laughing thrush) then enjoyed the beautiful gardens/nursery at Hort Park. The Alexandra Arch bridge was spectacular as was the lengthy forest section along the elevated walkway . Some serious money has clearly been spent creating this walk - or series of walks and it is worth every penny. After a lovely lunch in the cool of the Alkaff Mansion at Telok Blangah Hill Park, the walk across the Henderson Waves bridge was quite something. A brilliant concept and I loved the regular shelters in case of rain. Up to Mount Faber - where some of the restaurants appeared to be closed. This area was a little disappointing, I am not sure why but just without the atmosphere of the rest of the route, perhaps. However I appreciated the flower covered pavement shelters as by now it was VERY hot. We walked on down the Marang Trail - more birds, despite the proximity to the hustle and bustle of the city to the MRT/bus stop at the Harbourfront. Lots of useful way markers and notices (we didn't see any monkeys, however!) Just take lots of water with you! The way we went was easy to do even for us oldies and there are several loos along the way"
,,Lovely (easy!) walk with fabulous views,5.0,,"For easiest access start this walk at Labrador Park MRT and go south. Much of the walk is on a suspended platform affording great views of the city and harbour and of the greenery below. You may spot skinks, various birds and even monkeys on this walk. Stop off at Spuds & Aprons on Mt Faber for a lovely lunch. From here you can catch a cab or cable car to Harbourfront if you have exhausted your energy. If not then its a short walk down some steps to Harbourfront for a well earned cold drink! This walk also encompasses the Henderson Waves bridge which is worth seeing."
,,Elevated walk between the parks of Singapore,4.0,,"I hiked the southern ridges with a friend on a thursday at the end of October.
I recommended downloading the route map onto your iPhone from nparks.gov.sg before heading off. This not only helps you avoid missing any of the sightseeing points along the route but also lets you know how much time each segment will take. Alternatively if you are starting your walk near Hort Park there are maps with the timings available for free there. However the route is well marked & you will not get lost & I would feel safe if I was walking on my own.
This is an easy walk if it's not too hot a day. We started from HarbourFront MRT took exit D & the start of the trail (Marang trail) is pretty much straight outside - you can't miss it.
We headed upwards to Mount Faber where you can stock up with drinks at the gift shop if you have left anything behind & toilets are available, we also passed toilets along the way.
Our route continued along the Henderson Waves, Sembcorp Forest of Giants, Alkaff Mansion, Forest Walk, Alexandra Arch & we continued our walk to just beyond Hort Park where we did the Canopy Trail & then doubled back through the park to the Labrador Park MRT. Labrador Nature Reserve also looks worth exploring if you have more time.
We didn't start the hike until 12.15 & walked for about 2hrs. It was a hot but relatively cloudy day so personally I would say don't be put off doing this trail during the main part of the day if you have other commitments early am or late pm. Maybe because we were walking at this time we pretty much had the trail to ourselves.
If you have already seen the main sights of Singapore this trail is a nice way to finish off your visit to Singapore with some good views of the city along the route."
,,Great hike and views,4.0,,Great park that makes for a fairly easy hike up and over the ridges for nice views of the forest and city. The view from Faber is wonderful. The Henderson Waves bridge is modern and funky. The forest walk is a cool steel walkway above the treeline on the walk down.
,,hiking,5.0,,brisk walking and hiking are the activities you can actually do here. can be for family day out too. i enjoyed walking on the bridges.the view from atop is awesome
,,free hike in the fringe,4.0,,"It's a stroll along the city fringe (it cuts across several areas of Singapore). The good thing is 1. it's free. 2. The sights are free. 3. The fresh air is free. 4. You have free company (birds, occasional squirrel). 5. It's quite elderly/wheelchair friendly for most parts because the bridges have slopes.
Best to go early or late evening, else it is really hot. Wear a hat. One of the starting point is just across Shopping mall Vivocity. It means you can take the train station HabourFront and exit at the correct exit. We like to pack a small picnic to rest and take a slow relaxing time off with good walking shoes. There's no toilets along this trail though."
,,You want to keep walking,5.0,,"It was an amazing experience. A refuge from the commercial/urban appeal of the city and a place for wonderful panoramic sights and, off course, pictures. You are accompanied by birds singing throughout the walk and, because of the forest, it may be the freshest area of whole Singapore. And the price is... wait for it... ZERO. That is right, it is free. My friends and I walked from Alexandra road to Vivocity Mall enjoying the hike and stopping for photos and nice views in about one and a half hour. If you like nature, go. If you like strolling, go. If you have problems with heights, don't go. If you are a lazy person, go and see what you are loosing. HINT: I strongly recommend to start the walk early in the morning and take hydrating beverages with you in order not to be exhausted by the heat."
,,Like the Hike,5.0,,"Love it. Love it love it love it.

7 km of hike over tree top trails, high up bridges and horticulture park. If you got time theres even an old museum for Lt Adnan along the way for you to explore. An excellent way to spend time with your family to hike on a Sunday morning. If you end the hike in Telok Blangah, its only 5 minutes a way from Vivocity where you can stop to shop and lunch."
,,Another side of Singapore,4.0,,"I wanted my colleagues to know you could actually walk for an hour or so in Singapore and not hit a shopping mall, so I took them out on the Southern Ridges walk. Start early (before it gets too hot) and start at The Jewel Box of you want a basically downhill journey. It's well marked, relatively quiet and features interesting diversions along the way: the WWII museum at Bukit Chandon, Hort Park, and of course the bridges and elevated walks. The best part is everyone you meet on the walk is smiling, too. It's a nice diversion from the usual pace of Singapore. Bring a water bottle - and a hand phone to call a taxi rather than reverse course - and it's a great way to get some exercise early in the morning."
,,Worthwhile hike/walk in lush oasis,5.0,,"I walked 3.5 hrs from Kent Ridge to Mt. Faber area and down to Harbourfront MRT. It's a stunning walk in some parts and I wandered slowly now and then. A couple of tips: Start early in the day. I arrived around 8:30am. Bring lots of water...there are a couple of watering holes along the way. Bring snacks too. Also, I took the bus 166 or I think the 197. There are a couple that leave you at Normanton Park stop. That gets you the closest to the walkway into Kent Ridge (2min walk). Now, it's an unmarked walkway, but it's just up Science Park Drive. Keep your eyes out to the left (if arriving by bus at Normanton) and you'll see a little walkway with stairs down right by the curve of the road. Such great views and contrast between the jungle and the city. Lovely architecture peppered in the distance.

Highlights included Forest Walk, the gorgeous Canopy walk, and the cool Henderson Waves bridge. It was also a short stroll down the main Mt. Faber area where the pagodas come in to the MRT. PS: There's a good food court right by the MRT. You see the MRT sign right as you exit the trail at the bottom. Highly recommend the experience."
,,Loved our Southern Ridges Walk!,4.0,,We recently spent a day walking the paths of the Southern Ridges - it was great. We started from the Harbourfront station (the path starts right out the front of the station exit) and we walked up Faber Hill and over to the interesting bridges and skyline paths. We spent the entire day on the hike. The only problem was at the end of the hike we could not easily locate the way to the MRT station. Luckily we were given a ride by some very friendly Australians as the MRT turned out to be quite a ways a way from our location. I would just double check that issue before leaving on the walk. It was a highlight of our trip to Singapore!
,,Perfect walk!,5.0,,"The trail is set high, at treetop level, a lot of educational information on various tree species is posted here and there. Sorry that met no monkeys ;("
,,Great walk and not crowded!,5.0,,"A nice patch of wilderness in the city. Cool styles of architecture, a bit confusing to navigate at times but brilliant and fun!"
,,Interesting!,5.0,,"With the hubby and 4 year old son, start our journey from Telok Blangah Hill car park to Mt Faber. Great walk and green scenery."
,,You deserve a pint after this walk lol,5.0,,We started from Harbourfront MRT and managed to reach as far as Kent Ridge Park and what an enjoyable walk is was. You can do it at your own pace and there was points where you could leave the trail if you found it too...More
,,Impressive!,4.0,,We chose to hike Southern Ridges from west to east starting at Kent Ridge Park. Way finding to the park entrance from the Kent Ridge Park MRT was non-existent. We had difficulty finding the park access point. We turned onto Science Drive but still no...More

,,Amazing experience in an urban jungle,5.0,,"Heard a lot about this attraction but only got around to walking the trail today with my wife.
Very rewarding experience indeed. Got there early before 8:30 with Brekkie in our tummies.
Started at Kent Ridge Park and walked all the way to Mt Faber. Highlight was the canopy walk at Henderson. But overall the scenery and experience as a whole was great and reassuring that we have preserved this bit of greenery for all to enjoy.
Best bit is that it's free.
A must-do for everyone."
,,A walk worth doing,4.0,,"Nice views, quiet getaway (on weekdays), a chance to catch a bit of nature without the bugs and mosquitoes that jungle hikes entail."
,,A nice walk above the trees,3.0,,"i only did the Henderson Wave and Canopy Walk sections but surfice to say its a nice walk and something different. The galv walkway on the Canopy Walk requires a softer set of shoes for those with sensitive feet.
i wouldnt rush out to visit this site, but by the same token i wouldnt cross it off the list.
make sure you bring water etc because its a long way between vending machines and other facilities."
,,Amazing experience!,5.0,,"The Southern Ridges Walk in Singapore is a challenging 6 mile hike beginning at Mount Faber Park, traipsing through secondary rainforest, across the famous Henderson Waves bridge, and can potentially end all the way down near the coastline ending near Labrador Park, or across the Alexandra Arch and into Kent Ridge Park (depending on which route you choose). It is not necessary to hike the entire length of either trail, and there are plenty of exit points along the way for people who have had enough of the heat and humidity and want to return to their hostels or hotels.

I took a taxi to Mount Faber Park. From here, you can catch a cable car to Sentosa Island, but today I was going to hike the Southern Ridges Walk, beginning in earnest at the Marang Trail. I did not know for how long I could walk this trail, but I thought it would be good exercise nonetheless! The good with Singapore is that you won’t ever get lost because there are MRT stations pretty much everywhere and flagging down a taxi on the road is easy, so wherever I ended up on this trail I knew my hotel would only be a 20 minutes ride away!

All along the trail there are signs warning you of impending dangers ahead. In particular, you are warned there may be wild monkeys and that you shouldn’t feed them or make eye contact with them (they see this as a sign of aggression). Amusingly, I was also warned to be careful of falling branches from the trees above. Soon, I saw something large slithering in the undergrowth during my trek down the Marang Trail, which I feared could have been a python (more likely a monitor lizard), and this made me turn back to the Faber Walk, which seemed a good idea as I can see from the map above that I was heading for VivoCity shopping centre!

That said, Faber Walk was the most standard part of the trail for me, with amazing scenery and lots of places to sit down and rest, but it was not challenging in the slightest (apart from the humidity). I negotiated Mount Faber Loop and then made my way up to Telok Blangah Way. All this and I had not yet seen any monkeys – which was a good thing! It must be said that the trail in Mount Faber Park is not through dense jungle or anything, rather it along manicured pathways and gardens, and even around winding roads with buses and taxis plying their trade. However, the unmistakable sound of the Singapore cicada let me know that despite the tour groups and the joggers passing nearby, we were still in the middle of secondary rainforest.

Not long after the Faber Walk, we came to the architectural splendour that is the Henderson Waves Bridge. This bridge connects Mount Faber Park and Telok Blangah Park over Henderson Road. It is a popular place to hang out and recuperate during the trail, and if you planning to hike the whole trail then the Henderson Waves is roughly the half way point. I saw a small family of monkeys here but luckily they were not much interested in me and went about their monkey business.

The Forest Walk through Telok Blangah Park was another highlight of the Southern Ridges Walk. This allows you to have a bird’s eye view of the rainforest below. I guess in a tropical monsoon it would be quite dangerous to walk along here with no shelter from the elements, but fortunately for me there was no such inclement weather. The mile-long Forest Walk connects both to Labrador Park which is near the coast, and to the Alexandra Arch which links the Kent Ridge Park and HortPark.

Although I had a little look at the Canopy Walk, I figured I had had enough of the trail by now, as I was getting very hot and dizzy. I turned back round and went down to Labrador MRT Station and bought myself another bottle of water. All in all, I spent around 3 hours hiking the Southern Ridges Walk up to the Alexandra Arch and it is not an easy feat. You are never alone on the trek, as obviously other people are doing the same thing as you, but it is never busy and you can always a enjoy a little solitude in the tropical setting."
,,The Southern Ridges,5.0,,Please prepared a good shoes for walking . What a lovely place to explore. In our toption this is thne of the best and easy ways to enjoy the greenery this garden city can offer. I would be nicer if you carry the snack and drink during time walking .
,,City Nature,4.0,,"Good getaway from the buzzing city its like nature in a modernize environment , can visit once in a while to grab a nice view of the city"
,,Singapore has better options,3.0,,"Compared to other natural sites in Singapore, Southern Ridges seems too artificial. Go to MacRitchie's Reservoir or the Botanical Garden instead. The views of the city were unimpressive in daytime."
,,a lot of nature,4.0,,Like the botanical garden it's a nice place to forget the city and spend some time in the nature. From some parts you have a fairly good view on the city.
,,You forget your in the city,5.0,,"This walk takes you into what remains of the jungle. Its a great walk up Mount Faber, along Henderson Bridge and onwards over the tree top walk to Alexander Road. If you continue down Alexander Road you can pick up the board walk by Labrador MRT to Labrador Park to your right or left continuing along the board walk past Reflections and Caribbean condos to Keppel Island. Its about a 9km and takes about 2hrs."
,,great view of the city,4.0,,"I went there today and spent around 4hrs doing the round trip (maybe 20km) Started at the trail by the Harbourside station and walked all the way to the canopy walk. There is a small llWW museum close to the canopy walk and a university. Its not a hike through the parks,its a walk so for anyone. You will see great views of the city, its was quite relaxing no crowds around just birds singing. Great free thing to do in Singapore, defo recommend it."
,,"Very pleasant walk, not good for jogging",4.0,,"Walked this 10km trail beginning from Harbourfront MRT station. The scenery is very nice, considering you are downtown Singapore. Quite a bit of climbing involved. Not for people who are out of shape. Passes through three different park areas. Directional signs toward the far end are difficult to follow. And had some trouble finding an MRT station at the opposite end of the trail. Bathrooms are few and far between. Bring water, maybe a snack. Good day out, recommended."
,,Nice Canopy Walk,5.0,,"It starts from Alexandra Arch Bridge and continues few kilometres all the way to Mt.Faber(Cable Car Station). Wear comfy shoes and bring lots of water with you. On the way you see amazing views, so definitely a must visit, if you are even in decent shape. There were ""beware of monkeys"" signs, but we didn't see any"
,,dense greenery in a busy city,4.0,,"we took the marang trail that starts from the harbourfront station through mount faber park - this can be a taxing albeit beautiful walk as you walk up the hundereds of steps to mount faber trail that leads to the famous Henderson waves bridge. This is a uniquely designed bridge connecting mount faber park to telok blangah park above Henderson road. The bridge lights up and looks all the more beautiful at night. One can enjoy panoramic views of the city from different points in the park. The Southern Ridges are ideal for nature lovers, bird watchers, or even if you enjoy walking amidst nature. Dress light and carry plenty of drinking water!"
,,Easy trek even for inexperienced hikers,5.0,,"This trek is suitable for children and the elderly as it's made up of just slopes. We were impressed how they built it with all that metal structures.

It was pure serenity standing on the ridges and enjoying the forest views, right in the middle of lots of trees. One of the best and easy ways to enjoy the greenery this garden city can offer.

Don't forget to visit the nearby hort park and do pack your picnic food / drinks as I don't see any eateries nearby."
,,Beautiful change of scenery,4.0,,"What a lovely place to explore! We went to Henderson Wave Bridge and walked around! We saw SQUIRRELS!! Although it was humid, it was still a lovely place to have a look around!

We went along the forest-walkway thing as well, which was beautiful! Lots of good photo ops!"
,,A Long Nature Walk In Singapore,4.0,,"An excellent nature walk in the midle of a busy city state. Start at Pasir Panjang Hill car park, as the entrance from the main road is very steep arrive by a taxi to one of the hill carparks to avoid the steepest part of the walk. You need to be in good shape to walk in from the main road to the car park area. Once you get started on the trail it can take 3 hours to walk all the way to Harbour Front where there is the large shopping centre with food and drink avaialble. Take a small back pack with umbrellas, small snacks and plenty of water. Wear clothes for a hot day of walking and comfortable flat shoes for walking uphill and climbing stairways. It is not an easy walk but well worth the effort to see some superb views and camera opportunities. Beware of the Monkeys on the elavated forest walkway, they sit on the handrail minding their own business but a paper or plastic bag or anything that could contain food is up for being snatched and they are not easily put off. So put food packages and snacks out of sight and calmly walk by them, they wont pay you any attention if there is nothing to eat in sight. If you want an interesting long nature walk in the morning or late afternoon with the trail ending by the sea this is it. Can be busy with locals out for a family walk at weekends but never crowded."
,,Average Nature Walk,3.0,,"The southern ridges offered variety, From the forest walk to Henderson waves everything was cool but slightly rundown. Not a bad way to send the day. That being said its we hear the Alexandra Arch is nice when lit up at night."
,,Like a bird in the trees,5.0,,"A unique experience for nature lovers and family. Despite the chages of levels, the footbridge is accessible to all. A great journey would start at Hortpark and finish in Mount Faber. On the way, scenic view from the iconic Henderson Waves. Beware of daring monkey, just ignore them and don't show food on your way."
,,Nature bites,4.0,,I love it here except all the dog poo's covered in almost everywhere it's really2 disturbing. And yeah its free!
,,Good place to walk around,5.0,,great place for people who love to walk by the sides of trees and garden... take around a day to spend ... do slow walking you will enjoy
,,which way?,5.0,,it's a good walk and sauna session in 1. no matter what part of the year you go you will be soaked in no time. wet t shirt competition anyone?? oh and you need to dodge steaming dog crap as people don't clean up after their dogs
,,Love it!,5.0,,"Being quite the walker, I really enjoyed going to the Southern Ridges. You can breathe in fresh air, look at gorgeous plant life, and exercise a bit as you do both! It's definitely a must-visit."
,,See the nature of Singapore,4.0,,"Many joggers will come here in the morning, no water points however. Be prepared to walk about 2 to 3 hours from Hort Park to Mount Faber Park, so bring lots of water. The Marang Trail and Labrador nature/coastal trail is unlit after dark, so avoid visiting after dark. Never use the bridges after midnight as the lights are all off, unless you come with night vision goggles and good IR torch. Admission is free. Enjoy the scenery."
,,Southern Ridges Jungle/treetop heaven,5.0,,"This is a great walk/day out to enjoy the parks of Singapore. Start at Kent Ridge Park in the jungle then on to Hort Park then take the Forest walk using the elevated walkway. If you think the elevated walkway is good wait till you get to the Henderson Waves it is absolutley amazing then finish at Mt Faber, a really great day out. Remember to wear good shoes and take plenty of fluids."
,,A way to escape,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore for any length if time this is a must do activity. The amazing walk takes you up and over the city on the Henderson wave walk. You see lots of wild life and one part takes you through where they grow the plants for the botanic gardens. You can do all or part of it, and one part ends up at mount Faber where you can take the cable car back down. Take plenty to drink, some parts can be a but exhausting"
,,The Great Outdoors!,5.0,,"Okay, kinda the great outdoors. The man-made bridges are amazing and make for a nice place for an afternoon walk or jog. Easily gotten to with a taxi and most wonderful with a little cloud cover and breeze to cool you off."
,,Great walk,4.0,,"This is a fantastic walk and easily divided into sections. We only did the small part from Mount Faber through to Hendersons Waves. We got the MRT to Harbour point and then the cable car up to Mount Faber. This was fun in itself. You need to take lots of water and be prepared for lots of steps and slopes. There are signs, but I wish they told you how far it was to certain parts. For example, it would have been good to know how far it was going to be from Mount Faber to Hendersons Waves, the signs just pointed in the direction, so no real idea how long it would take. Views are great and its wonderful to get a taste of rainforest so close to the city."
,,Excellent walk with great views,4.0,,"This is a well waymarked path with plenty of ups & downs, but is never difficult, being well paved all the way. Some steps in places, but always in good condition. There are some cold drinks machines along the way, but I suggest you take plenty of liquid with you if you intend to do a long stretch of this walk. That said, with plenty of road crossings, you can do it in sections if you want."
,,360 degree views!,5.0,,"A long walk if you go the whole hog, however great as it makes for a full fun day out. If not, you can also choose to do smaller bits of the walk as the trail is broken up into distinct segments.

There are directional signs along the trail, however probably not enough so it's best if you go prepared, or else budget enough time for detours and double backs. The entire Southern Ridges trail has been added to in recent years as well (addition of Kent Ridge Park and Labrador Park), so the directional maps at the park are not up to date. Do a bit of homework before hand and print out a map to take with you. There are no dense forests though so the worst that could happen is you just take more time than you thought you would. The trail covers some lovely park areas with great views, so I say just take your time and explore the parks and not worry about sticking to the trail.

You can read my blog post about my recent visit here, and I have provided links to the maps as well:

,,"Great hike, great views",5.0,,"Kids and adults loved this hike from Harbor front, up to Mt. Faber (where the Cable cars start), past several bridges and canopy/treetop walks. The path goes through parks where there are toilets and vending machines. The tree top walks were a highlight for our kids along with playgrounds they encountered along the way. Carry snacks/food/drink. Not recommended on rainy days, especially if there is lightning."
,,"A long hot walk, but we loved it despite the lack of clear maps..",4.0,,"We started on the walk from the Science Drive end (MRT to Kent Ridge) and from that point it was a mixture of trust and the occasional indeterminate signage that we were still on the right track.
We started at around 5pm as recommended but still incredibly humid and glad we took plenty of water as no shops or kiosks around (at that time, at least). Understood that the path was well lit until late at night, which it was - until the most important bit! The last descent down to Harbourfront MRT was in complete darkness down numerous steps. Thank goodness we were in Singapore and that there was a partial moon, because we were alone on an unknown path through thick bush with a couple of unsigned choices at forks in the path.
Brilliant architecture on and around the walk. Not much left of nature (it is Singapore) but pleasant treed paths and soaring foot bridges. Took us about 2.5-3 hours to complete at a lazy pace (which is about all we could achieve in the heat!)."
,,The Southern Ridges,4.0,,I have been jogging in this ridges once per week. alot of trees. You can walk for an hour without having to repeat in circles.
,,Treetop Walk,5.0,,"We caught the bus from the interchange at Harbourfront and you get dropped off outside the Cable Car entrance at Mount Faber. We continued to walk down the road and then went onto the Treetop walk when the Henderson Wave Bridge is. It is a great bridge, the highest in Singapore I believe. You get great views and you can have a sit down and watch the world go by. We walked the distance of the walk and carried on through Hort Park and onwards. We ended up having to cut short later because it was starting to go dusk and we had to go back for a meal. We made our way when we saw a bus sign saying MRT. So we caught the bus and got off at the nearest MRT on the Circle Line. We used our EZ link card (which is invaluable for travelling around with) and got off at Bras Basah and made our way to our hotel.

I must say it is a lovely walk and so peaceful and different from all the bustle and goings on that Singapore has to offer. The only thing I would say is take a lot of water.

Pegasus."
,,Great morning walk,4.0,,We started at Mount Faber park and walked for over 4 hours till Hort park and beyond. The place is a good way to break away from daily work. Surrounded by greenery and trials. Caution: Do take lots of water :)
,,Great afternoon walk,4.0,,"We started at Hort Park, over Henderson bridge and walked through the tree tops walk, (right over the tree top canopy), then Henderson Bridge (which is great)' up Mount Faber then caught the cable car to Sentosa. Took about 2 hours, fantastic scenery, and a great afternoon. Take water and a camera...."
,,Great walk at the western part of Singapore,5.0,,"We took a train to Harbourfront MRT station and started the walk by climbing up the hill via Marang Trail. It's a relatively long flight of stairs and it took us about 10mins to complete the ascent. This is in fact the toughest part of the walk, the rest of the walk is a breeze. After getting to the top of the hill, we stopped to enjoy the scenery. Then, we followed the signage on the footpath and walked towards Henderson Waves Bridge, which connects the Mount Faber Park to Telok Blangah Hill Park. The bridge is known to be the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore, and has a distinctive wave-like structure. After crossing the bridge, following the signage again, we walked and arrived at the next highlight, which is the Forest Walk. We chose to walk on the elevated walkway which is actually a metal bridge constructed in the green surrounding . Can be quite an exciting experience for those who are afraid of heights. We ended our walk upon arriving at Alexandra Arch, after the Forest Walk. The entire casual 4.09km walk took us about 1 hour 15 mins. Good relaxing and quality time spent with the family, enjoyed the fresh air, greenery and sunshine."
,,Fantastic Walk - walk in the tree tops,5.0,,"We did this walk combined with Mt Faber, caught the bus. Great walk. I think it is definately a must see and suprised that you don't see it mentioned much. You do this elevated walk through the tree tops, which leads to another walk where you see the bridge that looks like a wave then you walk through Mt Faber, no need to take the cable car and then it leads to the bus stop, you could combine this walk with Sentosa Island. Its free."
,,something different - and terrific!,5.0,,"This is a great way to see Singapore: not the major tourist attractions or the hawker centers or the riverfront, but the way Singapore has chosen to preserve some of its green spaces (this is a very densely-populated country!) and make them available to the public. This pleasant and non-stressful walk takes you through Hort Park, a delightful series of tiny themed gardens that volunteers maintain, past some lovely black-and-whites, and among the tree tops of a rainforest. You can hike all the way down to Vivo City/Harbourfront to catch a cab or public transit, and have drink or something to eat -- or go on to Sentosa. We have done this walk several times."
,,Not that much of a Tourist Spot,3.0,,"It offers quite some breathtaking views (well, it's quite something for Singapore) but I wouldn't really recommend it for tourists. You'll probably find yourself a bit disappointed because it's not really meant to be (nor marketed as) a tourist spot. Take a stroll there if you have extra time, but certainly don't make it a priority unless you're in SIngapore your tenth time and a nature lover!"
,,Worth the walk,5.0,,"Make sure you have comfy shoes and water but the scenery and interesting things on the way is worth the walk. There are some parts that could do with a bit more sign posting and not really any food available on the way until you end up in Vivo City shopping centre. Also, as I had previously read on TA, the taxi driver was confused from the MRT station about the walk start location. I think it best to ask for the top of Pepys Road. Also after all the Monkey warning signs, we were a bit disappointed not to see/photograph any."
,,Lovely walk for the whole family in the city but away from the noise,5.0,,"We walked from the Kent Ridge to Vivocity. The walk begins going through a Science & Technology park which offers a nice contrast to the majority of the walk.
The first park is Kent Ridge park which as a nice (small) lake which is very nice with the highlight being the Canopy walk. The only problem is that the signs painted onto the path is slightly confusing (take the first right as you enter the park by the lake).

The second park is the Hortpark which is interesting with a focus on horticulture. it does include a nice kid's playground, and a simple restaurant for a break.

This connects to the Alexandra Arch and Forest Walk - over 1km of canopy walks which looks over the jungle and and high rises of downtown Singapore. Some kids were moving along this on their scooters - looked like fun.

The Forest Walk connects to Telok Blangah Hill Park and the impressive Henderson Waves. The Waves is a high rise footbridge going over a otor way. It ismch more impressive than it sounds. It connects to Mount Faber where we stopped for a very mediocre and over-priced meal at the Jewel Box.

We then took the lovely Marang trail wn to Vivocity. We made the mstake of entering the mall to buy promised ice creams fr the kids. The place was so loud after the peace of the diferent parks.

We walked with our two children (5 and 11 years old) and it took about 3 1/2 hours with stops at two restaurant for snacks."
,,Good Hike from Alexandria Bridge to Mt Faber,4.0,,Its a good walk to Mt Faber from Alexandria Bridge on a metalled boardwalk elevated up above ground amidst many tropical but not jungle trees. Walk on the Henderson wave bridge on its wooden flooring ending up at Mt Faber where a further walk on the trail will bring you the road across Vivo city.
,,Great view and great trip,4.0,,"A visit here is another way to spend your day differently.
Here you'll find a great walkway that will lead you to Mount Faber, but beware that this might take up a lot of your energy walking quite a long distance. Great place to get good photos, and the scenery as well is very enthralling."
,,The Green Singapore,4.0,,A visit of The Southern Ridges is a way to escape the urban atmosphereof the city and have another point of view. I recommand you to wear walking shoes Have a look to Henderson Waves bridge for an uncommon architecture
,,Do this walk!,5.0,,"We started the walk from the MRT at Kent Ridge an finished at Mount Faber. It was increadibly hot so we did feel like we were melting by the time we finished. Went via Hort Park, the treetop walk, Henderson Waves etc over about 2 hours. Beautiful views, wild monkeys and stunning jungle walk.

Make sure you takes lots water and comfortable shoes. I would recommend going early in the morning when it is cooler."
,,5 star walk!,5.0,,"There have been many many improvements in Singapore over the last few years: One of them is that they have constructed special bridges to link the various hikes along what is known as the Southern Ridges. Yesterday I hopped up Mount Faber where I spent a happy hour watching the cable cars going across to Sentosa, mooching around the top-end restaurants and bars and chatting to innocent bystanders …. then along Faber Walk and Telok Blangah Hill across Henderson Waves, up to the Terrace Garden at Hilltop Walk, through the treetops of Forest Walk, down by Alexandra Arch then took the Alexandra Garden Trail to Berlayer Creek and home via Bukit Chermin Boardwalk. Saw so much fabulous flora and fauna – especially along the Creek (just walk slowly and quietly and keep your eyes open). There were a lot more gardens and walks but I wasn’t sure how long it would all take so I will have to check them out another time. I was by myself this time but am sure this will become a favourite family outing – especially given it is downhill all the way!"
,,One of the least explored flora in Singapore!,5.0,,"Tucked amongst the heritage site of Bukit Chendu, one can venture the entire southern ridge line which is now becoming more popular after park connectors made its appearance to bridge the entire island. Being one of the least commercialized parks on the island, one can still see amazing flora and fauna composition in this region. Bring along a pair of shade and binocular. The fun begins!"
,,Well worth the effort.,4.0,,"We did this walk after reading about it here on T.A. and doing a bit more research. Was definately worth the effort. We walked from East to West. Started by taking the first morning MRT from Somerset to Harbourfront and straight out exit D (Marang Road). It was still dark so we climbed the stairs on the first part by torch light which was fine and easy enough to follow. Most of the entire route was fairly well signed although we did need to use guess work in a couple of places.

It was a Saturday so there were many other people out along the way, runners, walkers and groups doing Tai Chi at various spots. Took us around 2.5 hours to get to Kent Ridge where we took the MRT back.

For those who like to do some walking and want to get away from the busier parts of Singapore and see another aspect for a few hours this is well recommended."
,,Fabulous canopy walk + stupendous views of Singapore,5.0,,"We always take visiting tourists on this walk, as it is not well publicised, provides a very different perspective on Singapore, and delivers good exercise.

Typically we start from Hort Park, where you can see a never ending variety of garden exhibitions, and there are toilets, drinks and a new Bistro (not tried yet). Over Alexandra Arch bridge, to start the Forest Walk section, which is a suspended canopy walk. Watch out for the monkeys, birds, butterflies and other assorted flora and fauna. Take water with you, as it can get very hot and there are no places to top up, until you get to the water cooler machine and toilets near Alkaff Mansion. We always climb up to the Terrace Garden, which provides fantastic views across to Sentosa and beyond, plus in to the city.
Walk up the hill to get to the Henderson Waves bridge, always a source of amazement, as you walk along the wavy wooden section, with its views across to Sentosa.
Cross the road and climb the steep path to get to Faber Point. There are a set of sculptored reliefs around the base, showing the various historical phases of the island development. On top, see yet another Merlion, join the coach parties to take photos and work out compass directions to the various places marked out on the floor.
You can then walk over to the Jewel Box, for the Mount Faber cable station and take this down to Vivo City, or take the walking route down the hill to the MRT ar Harbourfront.

Set aside two hours for this leisurely walk through the tropical forest, to see the sights and stop for water and rest. Definitely worth the trip."
,,Escape to the jungle for some excercise,5.0,,"Walk the southern ridges trail all the way from Vivo, over Henderson bridge all the way to Hort Park for a weekend escape. Wear your walking shoes or trainers and perpare to sweat but you will feel invigorated at the end. There are plenty of drinks machines along the way and a cafe/bar the the top of mount Fabar overlooking the city too. Once you reach the Alexandra bridge its easy to catch a bus back to Vivo or back to the city."
,,Epic Adventure,5.0,,I walked tru only 3 bridges but its fun.. Getting off of the city look of Singapore and seeing a pretty foresty part of it.. Down part of my trip was it was raining soo... Yeah also the Henderson Wave and Alexandra bridge looks quite untidy.. They should clean it cause it looks very unattractive..
,,A wonderful canopy walk..,4.0,,"The Southern Ridges encompasses several parks/trails. Since I have given my reviews for Mt. Faber & the Henderson Waves separately, my review here will be for the Hilltop/Forest Walk, which is between the Henderson Waves & the Alexandra bridges.

We had started off our journey from Mt. Faber Park in the morning, then on to the Henderson Waves. Once off the Waves, you are seamlessly connected to Hilltop/Forest Walk. There are many 'fitness stations' along the way, so, the avid 'exercisers' can not only enjoy a good cardio workout by running/walking but can also get some resistance training.

There are many pretty, tall trees along the way providing shade. Different sorts of plants/shrubs/flowers to look out for. It must've been the monkeys' day off as we didn't see any but we did, however, chance upon a squirrel, a gorgeous blue dragonfly & a little, colourful snake! Part of of our walk brought us to main road (with cars & taxis plying the route) & through an old 60's styled park made up of lots of stone/granite. Walking on, we came to the highlight of our journey - the canopy walk. The network metal bridges seem to weave in & out of the trees, providing such a stark yet awesome contrast between the sturdy metal structures against the soft, lush green of the forest - amazing!

By the time we got here it was well over 1pm & though we were grateful for a sunny day, it was rather hot. The bridge weaves in & out of the forest meaning there are stretches where you would be left totally unshaded. So, bringing along a cap/hat/umbrella, water, sunblock & even insect repellent is a good idea!

Along the way, there was an exit off to Preston Road where (surprisingly) there was a row of pretty colonial styled homes. Walking on we encountered a spaceship like shade, good to have if it rains or if you just need to take 5 & get out of the sun. Before we knew it we were already approaching the Alexandra Bridge, marking the end of our journey.

I really enjoyed my walk here & wouldn't mind doing it again, perhaps in reverse starting off early in the morning from Alexandra Bridge right up to Habourfront. Although every now & then you will encounter 'civilization', many areas along the trails can be quite deserted, so ladies, it may be a good idea to walk with a companion."
,,"Don't just read about it, you need to experience it.",5.0,,"Came across some reviews and decided to use the last day of 2012 to checked out this place. Armed with a small umbrella and a bottle of water, I arrived at Kent Ridge MRT station alone. Walked to the end of Science park drive and hit the trail before noon. Fortunately it was a cloudy day but a downpour was imminent. I was immediately captivated by this beautiful park. Along the way I encountered many squirrels, beautiful birds and even a white parrot, a nice change from the usual pigeons, mynahs and pesky crows you see in this concrete jungle. Forty five minutes into the walk, it started to rain. Undeterred, I pushed on (thanks to the umbella I brought along), stopping at various intervals to soothe my fifty year old feet. The place had many directional signage but I still got confused by the maze of trails. Making my way across the Alexandra arch, I was unprepared for what was going to be a 1.3 km walk across a zig-zagging no step metal walkway up the steep slope towards Telok Blangah hill park, with no one else in sight. I got 'cold feet' looking down through the floor grating but at the same time admired those who build this remarkable walkway. Further walking brought me to the Henderson waves, a spectacular bridge high up across the road with wooden boards, I have to give credits for this one heck of an engineering feat. Moving quickly through Mount Faber park and down Marang trail, I arrived at Seah Im food centre for a much deserved late lunch. A meaningful way to spend 3 hours of my time. I am sure to be back again, this time with wife and daughter in tow. (You can't see it all in a rush, it's too big a place and it's best to enjoy nature the slow way.)"
,,Its a pity about the original path,4.0,,"I am a keen walker. One of my favourite walks in Singapore is from Mount Faber (accessed up the path from Marang Street at Harbourfront), across Mount Faber, then along to the Kent Ridge Part, itself a fascinating destination with lots of paths to explore, and the wonderful Bukit Chandu war memorial to experience.
The tree top walk from Telkok Blangah Hill park, through to Hort Park (another place worth lingering) is a delight. At tree top level, it's not ideal in the mid day sun-mad dogs and Englishmen etc-but on duck or in the early morning, it is a lovely walk. There are no great views per se, but the experience of being up where the birds nest is a delight.
I often look down to the original walking path along the floor of the forest. The old stairs leading to the path have long been closed off-at both ends of the walk. In the heat of the noon day sun, that is a pity, as down there, the shade goes for ever.
Singapore has some wonderful walks. This is one of the best. It is just a pity that there is no choice-uwp with the birds or along the ground in the shade."
,,Very enjoyable picturesque walk,5.0,,"I found it exciting to do west to east, though a bit confusing coming upon the children's garden from what felt like the back entrance. Not a difficult walk, but bring plenty of water for that Singapore sun! Note: the walk up to the pagoda for great views -- not worth it. I thought the views were just as good from the waves bridge."
,,Beautiful And Unique Walk,5.0,,"We were so delighted and happy to find this lovely hike in the midst of Singapore. My husband and I aren't into shopping, so when we had a stopover in this city for a couple of days, we quickly realized that we'd be stuck in a bunch of malls (after checking out Little India, Chinatown, and the Bay Gardens, of course!) if we didn't find something interesting to do outdoors. If you're here during one of the rainy seasons, then I recommend starting the walk from the western end, and then stopping at one of the restaurants at the Faber Hill section of the hike (which is near the end of the hike on the east side) for either a drink or supper. We never saw the monkeys that live amidst the forests that the path goes through, but we very much enjoyed walking on the elevated paths at the tops of the trees, and taking in the sounds of the birds and cicadas. If I'm ever in Singapore again, I'd definitely hike this trail again."
,,Hard to believe,5.0,,"It is hard to believe that you are in the middle of one of world's finance centres.the Southern Ridges is a series of parks connected various walkways. We started at The Reflections at Bukit Chandu and made our way via Holt Park, the stunning Forest Walk and Henderson Wave to Mt. Faber. The Faber Bistro is a great place for a lunch or refreshment after the walk."
,,Walk with a view,5.0,,"This was a walk that we had not even heard of until seeing it reviewed on Trip Advisor, and it turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip to Singapore, and a break from the built-up areas of the city. We followed the directions of a previous reviewer and started at Kent Park MRT. Unfortunately we came out at the wrong station exit (by the hospital) and started walking in the wrong direction. After a while we realised our mistake and turned around, and walked to the end of Science Park Drive where a path lead into Kent Park and the start of our walk. We found the walk to be sufficiently signposted along the way, and had toilet facilities, soft drinks and water dispensers, and there was a restaurant part way in Hort Park. According to the National Parks Board the Southern Ridges is some 9km in length, and I estimate that roughly 2km of that is a raised canopy walkway. It's quite a strenuous walk, particularly in the heat, but well worth it. However, although we did see some youngsters attempting the walk with their parents, I would suggest all but the adventurous type would find it quite boring. It did take us some hours to complete the walk, but we were strolling rather than hiking."
,,Favourite Singapore walk,5.0,,"Singapore is so urban that it takes imagination from its planners to provide enough green space and trails for all its inhabitants. Fortunately this is a great example: a linked series of short trails running along the ridges from NUS to Vivo City, each one with its own quirks and sights.

The trail is best walked from west to east and there are a number of starting points. To me the first interesting one is the beginning of the Canopy Walk which starts near the top of Pepys Road beyond Reflections at Bukit Chandu (worth visiting this before you start if you are into WWII history and haven't been there before).

The Canopy Walk does what it says on the tin: it is a high boardwalk built among the tops of the tree, giving an interesting perspective of the forest and including some useful information boards so you know what trees you are looking at.

Next comes the Floral Walk and Hort Park: you snake down the hill on a windy brick path and then through the wide formal gardens (there are 40 distinct small gardens to look at) and greenhouses of Hort Park. At the end of Hort Park there's a cafe which used to do quite good Thai food but is now reputedly rather poor: but at least you can get drinks. You can also start the walk from the car-park here if you want a shorter distance, as we often do (it's about an hour from here to the end). After the car park comes the Alexandra Arch, a handsome bridge with a metal geometric leaf-like design spanning Aexandra Road.

After the bridge, proceed up the metal walkway which forms the Forest Walk. This is quite a climb and takes you all the way back up to the top of the ridge, winding its way through the forest near the top, again at the level of the canopy for viewing. Quite often you will see birds here, and monkeys (keep your plastic bags hidden from them to avoid their pestering and do as the signs say and do not feed them). Views are excellent to the south from here.

After leaving the metal walkway, you continue along the forested ridge past or through a couple of outdoor gym areas, and then up a hill to the start of the Henderson Waves bridge. This bridge is even more of an architectural joy than the Alexanda Arch: it's over 120 feet in the air and spans the valley across to Mount Faber. It is designed to look a bit like a paper streamer in the wind, and inside it has a number of curves and steps enjoyed mostly by skateboarders. Views from here are also stunning and it's quite common to see couples having their wedding photos taken here.

At the end of the bridge, keep straight ahead on the Mount Faber loop. Don't bother taking the longer loop to the right - there are no decent views, just an extra kilometer to trudge if you go that way.

At the top of Mount Faber you see the Jewel Box, with several restaurants. We usually stop here at Sapphire for dinner: it's relatively informal and used to sweaty walkers, despite what it says on their website, and the once more the view as the sun sets and dark settles in is one of the best in Singapore.

Finally, if you don't get a cab from the Jewel Box, make your way down the steps which make up the Marang Trail to Vivo City and the shock of being in the largest and busiest (and most confusing) mall in Singapore - but at least there are plenty more places for food and drink if you need them."
,,"Very Nice Trails, A Bit Crowded In The Evenings",4.0,,My girlfriend and I walked about 5 km through The Southern Ridges in the evening and it was very nice. It was well-lit and the trails were not too difficult. Quite nice for a couple hours' walk.
,,Worth the effort,5.0,,"The adjoining parks of the Southern Ridges offers a lovely, quiet, Green experience in Singapore. We took a taxi to the middle...near the Henderson Waves (very high pedestrian bridge) and walked to the Kent Ridge Park...down the metal Forest Walk..and back...then over the H.Waves to Mount Faber Park (with its cable car to Sentosa Island)...and then down to the MRT station to travel back to central Singapore. The walk, though a little tiring in the humidity, was Lovely...with tropical scenery in quiet abundance. We will go back on our next trip!"
,,A great walk through some lovely areas,4.0,,"We loved this walk, through beautiful and diverse areas, with some great views. We started at Kent Ridge Park (a lovely area), walked through Hort Park, then via Telok Blanagh and Mt Faber down to the Harbour Front MRT (I'm estimating it was about 5kms). Come well-prepared for the heat and sun - sunblock, hat/parasol, and plenty of water. I found Hort Park the toughest section, as it's largely exposed to the sun, with little shade - stop at the visitors' centre (where maps and advice are available) and regenerate with a cold drink in the shade. (Toilets are also available here.) From Mt Faber, you can catch the cable car down to Harbour Front, but it's also only a relatively short downhill walk (about 15 minutes) to the MRT station if you prefer to walk all the way.
Following this route, you'll pass the Jewel Box, but this seemed to be largely a group of quite formal restaurants (not really appropriate for dropping in all hot and sweaty in your walking gear!) - so it might be wise to bring your own snacks.
One problem we did face was finding the access point to Kent Ridge Park at the very beginning of the walk - none of the locals seemed to know where it was! Here's how we did it: exit the Kent Ridge MRT station, turn left, and then walk on to Science Park Drive. Continue for about 500 metres - on your right, you'll see a building with an unusual fountain in its forecourt featuring sculptures of brains (yes, it was bizarre!). The security guards out the front couldn't help us, but the receptionist inside the building knew exactly where to go, and explained that the Kent Ridge Park entrance is around the side and to the rear of this building, down some steps. I know this sounds complicated, but the walk really was worth it!"
,,Decent outing,3.0,,"I started the trail from Bukit Chandu, got on at the Canopy Walk and ended it after the Forest Walk. Lots of trail info on the Singapore National Parks website, so I wont spend words on that.

We were 4 adults & 3 kids. It was a very sunny day and over the route there were only 2 (or 3) places where water was available. There is not much tree cover for the route mentioned above. My other grouse is that during the walk you periodically come across buildings & arterial roads; which I found a jarring experience. I recently hiked thru MacRitchie Reservoir & was expecting a similar experience; which, in retrospect was a mistake.

Canopy Walk: nice, but too short to register as an experience.
Hort Park: strangely devoid of large trees. It had a Butterfly Enclosure that was closed by the time we got there (~12:30 pm). The kids enjoyed the play areas, but I found them out of place.
Alexandra Arch: a pedestrian bridge with a claim to structural design
Forest Walk: quite good ... was fun & the highlight of the trip.

We walked down to the road after Forest Walk and took a cab to Vivocity (Harbourfront) for a late lunch.

Total walk time: 2.5 hours, with plenty of breaks."
,,Great place for a family outing,5.0,,"One route and it will connect you to Kent Ridge Park, Hort Park, Telok Blangah Hill and Mount Faber. Each place offer beautiful and scenic views."
,,A workout with Stunning Views,5.0,,"This was the absolute highlight of our trip to Singapore.

We took the LRT to Harbour Front station and then headed for the Marang Trail (exit D). The first part of the trail is really hard work, particularly in the heat, as you have to climb up a LOT of stairs (the guide book helpfully said that it is the equivalent of a 24 storey building!). Once at the top however there are bars and restaurants at the Jewel Box and the cable car to Sentosa Island. You can also get a taxi straight to the Jewel Box to avoid the climb).

We carried on following the Faber Walk to Henderson Waves which is an incredible structure and the perfect place for a photo stop. This leads to the hilltop walk and a restaurant where we stopped for a much needed cold drink before the terrace garden and the elevated walkway of the forest walk. This was quite exposed so make sure you have plenty of water with you as it got very hot with minimal shade.

We then crossed the Alexandra Arch to Hort Park which was a Gardeners paradise and really stunning gardens. I thought the 'Hort tips' were a particularly nice touch. By this point we ran out of energy so we climbed up the first part of the Canopy Walk to the museum at Bukit Chandu then followed the road down to Pasir Panjang Road where we caught the number 143 bus which took us straight back to Clarke Quay for just a few dollars (the Shell House stop on Clemenceau Ave).

Overall a fab, if tiring, day!"
,,Great View From The Highest Pedestrian Bridge In Singapore,4.0,,"Telok Blangah Hill Park & Henderson Waves is well-known for its scenic location and unique architecture, to the extent that its a popular venue for wedding photoshoots.

The biggest attraction here would be Henderson Waves. The largest pedestrian bridge in Singapore, and one of the highest, it offers fantastic city views in either direction. Another unique point is the architecture of Henderson Waves, a distinctive wave-like structure of undulating curved 'ribs', which also double as shelters. At night, the Henderson Waves are lit by LED.

Another major attraction is located within Telok Blangah Hill Park, known as the Terrace Garden. A series of large terraces, on which different flowers are grown, is a very pretty sight.

Telok Blangah Hill Park & Henderson Waves also houses Alkaff Mansion, a restored colonial building, which houses a restaurant and bar.

Personally, I felt Telok Blangah Hill Park & Henderson Waves is almost like a 'passing through' attraction spot... As part of the Southern Ridges, the attractions are spread out quite linear across the park. You could literally travel from one attraction point to another in a linear fashion.

If you're planning a visit, do note that admission is free, and allocate between 1 to 2 hours for viewing. Also, wear a good pair of shoes, and bring water!"
,,Superfun if you like hiking,5.0,,"The trail takes you from the city and all the way out to University of Singapore. You could do just a short walk or the complete walk, nice anyways. The start close to Vivo-city is in Faber park, where you could easy hike for a day alone. Recomend to bring a map/smartphone for navigation in case you get lost, as there are many parks connected. Bring water! No need what so ever to go with a group/guide."
,,For Nature Lovers,4.0,,"If you love nature walk, then Southern Ridges is just fit you. About 11 km long trail connecting one park to another, well.. I didn't get bored. I started walk around 8 am and finished it on 11 am, average walking speed. Starting point at Kent Ridge Park and end at Marang Trail that leads to Haberfront MRT. Quite fun, don't forget to bring mineral water with you."
,,Escape from the hustle and bustle,5.0,,"I only walked a small piece of the Southern Ridges, but it was well worth it. Roads and paths are very clean and well kept and there are a lot of roadsigns that help you determine your walking route. This is a good spot to enjoy nature in between shopping sprees for instance."
,,Scenic gentle walk through the southern city,4.0,,"Somewhat confusingly, the Southern Ridges walk consists of many separately labelled walks, stretching from Mount Faber Park, Telok Blangah Hill Park, Labrador Nature Reserve to Kent Ridge Park. The National Parks site provides a series of short maps (http://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/index.php?Itemid=73&id=62&option=com_visitorsguide&task=attractions) which may (or may not!) make things clearer. This review mainly only covers the Telok Blangah Hill Park, Henderson Waves and Forest Walk. Car access is via Telok Blangah Green, with several free parking lots. Heading west, there is the possibility of a rather steep climb up the Terrace Garden, a somewhat out-of-place set of terraces complete with stairs and ornate balustrades. The view from the top of the Terrace Garden is pretty good, mainly of the surrounding urban area but with glimpses of the sea to the south. Continuing west, the Forest Walk consists of metal bridge-walks leading down the slopes to Alexandra Road. The climb down is gentle and quite easy, even for those unaccustomed to exercise. The walkway passes over and through the secondary forests. Some recent earthfall has left some areas reasonably exposed and bare, so I would personally avoid walking from late morning to late afternoon.
Back again to starting point. From the Telok Blangah carpark, a moderate climb to the top of the hill brings you to Henderson Waves pedestrian bridge, which connects Telok Blangah hill with Mount Faber Hill. Worth visiting just to admire the clever undulating curves of the bridge.
To date, I haven't proceeded further into Mount Faber Park. But it looks just as interesting..."
,,I loved this walk,4.0,,"Through the tree tops and with views of Singapore - this was a walk which showed a different side of Singapore. We walked through gardens, jungle, past old Brittish colonial houses and really enjoyed being out with nature! Must do!"
,,So-so. The top-down view from the cable car is better.,3.0,,"This is for people who love nature and leisure walking. I went for a ride on the mount faber cable car after that and the view from up there was simply breathtaking.

Also, I believe this place is better known as Henderson Waves Bridge instead of the Southern Ridges..."
,,Long Rambling walk through the woods and parks for nature lovers,4.0,,"This is a good walk which spans a significant fraction of the southern coastline of Singapore. It takes one from West Coast Park through Clementi Woods, the National University of Singapore, Pasir Panjang Hill (Reflections@Bt Chandu is also there), Hort Park, Telok Blangah Hill, the Henderson Waves (the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore) and Mount Faber. This has now been extended to HarbourFront, and the newly opened Keppel Island nature trail.

The walk should be done in the early morning or in the evening as it can get very hot. The entire trail is very long but can be done in parts. The treetop walk between Hort Park and Telok Blangah Hill is recommended or the stretch between Hort Park and Pasir Panjang Hill.

The trail is lit at night and is good for sunrise or sunset walks."
,,Lovely half day,4.0,,"As far a city walks in the countryside go, this was pretty good. Highlights included views from the Marang Trail, the Henderson Waves and the Forest Walk. At night I think the Alexandra Arch would look good. We continued to the Canopy Walk-similar to Forest Walk and we were getting tired. In the Hortpark, the butterfly houses and glass houses were all locked, which was a pity.

We were there around 3-4 hours. MRT to Harbourfront, then 51 bus back from out near Vista park open Space.

Definitely a different side of Singapore. Free as well - good for those not into shopping."
,,Nice scenic walk,4.0,,"This is one of a few walks that you can find in Singapore. It is a park connector where you can visit 4 parks in 1 trip. The route was more scenic than Mac Ritchie Nature Reserve but it had a lot of staircases to climb no matter whether you start from West Coast Park, Kent Ridge Park or Mount Faber.

I went there with my colleagues on one Saturday Morning. We decided to start from Kent Ridge Park. We met up at Bouna Vista bus stop to take bus 92 to end of Science Park 1 where there is an entrance to Kent Ridge Park. By the way, the bus 92 does not go to Science Park 1 on Sundays.

The view at Kent Ridge Park looking over to Pasir Panjang was fantastic. We continued to walk to Hort Park or Horticulture Park. They had beautiful flowers and nicely designed landscape to showcase some outdoor landscape ideas. There was a restaurant if I remember correctly. Right after Hort Park is the Alexander Arch. After that there were more staircases to climb. I was quite impressed by the path they created to link Hort Park and Henderson Waves. When we got to Henderson Waves, it was quite cloudy and very windy. The wind was so strong and cold that we felt like we were in Genting, Malaysia. After some climbing stairs and walking, we finally reached Mount Faber.

The route was more scenic than Mac Ritchie Walk. I would choose one of these sunny mornings to go for this walk again. This time, I want to start from Mount Faber all the way to West Coast."
