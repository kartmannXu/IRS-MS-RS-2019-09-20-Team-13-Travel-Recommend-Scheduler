,,Impressive even if there is no race,5.0,,"The street circuit in Singapore is open for public and runners even when there is no race. The race is in September, but the lights are already installed and you can take a walk in the pit lane and see the finish line. A must see for Formula 1 fans and much cheaper outside the racing weekend."
,,Night Race - Must See,5.0,,"One of the few night races at a great place! The lights, the city buzz makes it an unforgettable experience! Celebrating on the pit lane made it a wonderful experience!"
,,Lovely location near the Singapore Flyer !!,5.0,,"F1 Singapore grand prix track is right next to the Flyer. We walked by the track to see the place up close. The view of the harbor and the Marina Bay Sands hotel with Flyer in the background is awesome !!!

The Singapore Grand Prix motor race forms part of the Formula One World Championship. The event takes place on the Marina Bay Street Circuit and was the inaugural night race and 1st street circuit in Asia designed for Formula One races !

Spaniard Fernando Alonso won the first Formula One edition of the Grand Prix, driving for the Renault team amid so called controversial circumstances. The Singapore Grand Prix will remain on the F1 calendar until at least 2021."
,,What a BUZZ,5.0,,"Walking around the Pit Lane and the Start/Finish line of the Singapore F1 Street Circuit was tight up there. Now, I’m not so sure we should have been there but, no one came near to say we shouldn’t. Best part of an hour wandering around the Pit Lane. Standing at P1 on the grid was awesome and totally surreal. A goal has been to see the Singapore Grand Prix but with the announcement of the 2020 Hanoi circuit and my love for Vietnam then I’m thinking it wins."
,,Absolutely amazing,5.0,,The circuit is located near Marina Bay. The circuit is a street circuit with amazing corners and Straight drives.
,,Absolutely brillaint,5.0,,"We were lucky enough to get 3 day ticket for this years Singapore Grand Prix, prior to and after racing so much to see and do, with Live Bands/Acts playing in various areas, the racing itself, although not a major fan was breath taking and the noise of the cars made the hairs on the back of your necks stand on end, great atmosphere and superb way to spend 3 evenings in Singapore"
,,Best GP of the year - 2018,5.0,,"Night GP under the lights. We purchased 3 day tickets from Gootickets which were delivered to the UK in good time. Due to the late start it ,means that one can have a useful day in the city before going to late in the afternoon.

Great music entertainment in all sectors, easy access and good standing areas to be found if one does not have a seat. Best free area was rather hidden away for corner 1,2 &3, well worth trying to find those. ."
,,Bucket list - Check!,5.0,,"It was always a dream of mine to watch F1 live, especially during the time when Michael Schumacher was still racing with Ferrari, however, since it is now 2018, he has since retired and actually suffered a debilitating head injury so it was Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen driving for Ferrari. Anyways, the Singapore GP was the reason why I went back to Singapore for the 2nd time this year. (First was in May with my family) I stayed with a friend who works there so I got away with free accommodations. Speaking of which, make sure to book way in advance to avoid the expensive rates especially during the race weekend. There are also tickets for the next year's race (2019) which you can buy now at a 30% discount. Make sure you familiarize yourself with Singapore's MRT as this will be your best friend going to places where the roads have been closed off due to the street circuit nature of the race. The concerts in the Padang Stadium before the race on Sunday was fun, this year (2018) Dua Lipa performed and it was a blast watching her live. (my daughter may have been jealous had she not switched to k-pop) One thing nice about the GP weekend, the air was festive, people were out in the streets up to the wee hours of the morning after the race, it was off to Clarkey for more drinks and food. And in all that, you never feel like you are in danger strolling the streets of Singapore. (Much safer than in my own country mind you) MRT and bus schedules have been extended to compensate for the influx of tourists to watch the GP (noticed that mostly were Australian? :) Rooting for their mate, Daniel Ricardo. I will most definitely go back again to watch them live, maybe when the son of Michael drives for Ferrari. :)"
,,Not the best race but thumb ups for entertainment,4.0,,"As street circuit with short straight and narrow street, not many exciting race action for F1 fan like me but since Malaysia GP dropped, Singapore now the only country in SEA offers F1 race. The ticket is quite above average but it includes world class concert and other actives like firework after race. Been purchased both walkabout and Bay Grandstand all were not so great. Bay grandstand offers magnificent view to Marina Bay and downtown and firework but very short straight. The public commentator was average, should have shown Sky F1 with Martin and Crofty. After first 10 laps will not be many action, we went down to get food. Thera were many eateries in the circuit. Tips of you get out from Padang stage, better exist via Jubille bridge."
,,Very entertaining event,5.0,,"I am not a big fans of F1 but I always excited and dream to attend F1 Singapore Night, because it will be the only night race in F1 series, so when it happen, I really really excited. I had seat in the Bay Grandstand which haven't had a lot to see, just a short straight line, but the whole experience was amaze me. Mostly how the arrange the event and of course the entertainment. It was really great. I hope I can come again."
,,Singapore F1,5.0,,"Great Experience, the lights the cars the entertainment. All round one of the best Live Events to attend"
,,3 stars for not the most exciting of races but 5 stars for fantastic city to visit.,3.0,,"Had a seat in the Bay Grandstand so only had a view of a short straight. Large screens however gave a good overall picture of the entire race. Great position however for the fireworks display afterwords and a great view of the city around the bay lit up at night. As it's mainly a street race there's not much chance of a lot of action anyway so not the best race for first timers. Singapore is a fantastic modern, vibrant, eclectic city however well worth a visit. Take the race in as part of a wider holiday perhaps with a short cruise around Malaysia and Thailand and you should have a wonderful memorable time like I did."
,,Worth the 14hr flight,5.0,,"I loved it. We have been to a few races and so far this was our favourite. The backdrop of the Singapore skyline takes your breath away.

The free concerts were amazing especially The Killers, but the highlight was getting close to the race action. We were sat in the Pit Grandstand for main race and it was worth every penny. We could almost touch the drivers and see all the build up to the race. There was a huge firework show at the end of the race.

We found the food and drinks prices reasonable but be prepare to queue, especially on the Sunday.

My top tip is wear comfy shoes and loose clothing, there is a lot of walking btw grandstand ect and it gets very hot. Also take an empty water bottle, as there are free filling stations around the circuit.

Choose you seat careful as we thought some of the stand did not offer great action.

There is clear signage around circuit and plenty of helpful staff if you get lost. I cannot wait to return."
,,On the grid,5.0,,"What a fantastic weekend first time at a F1 and 2nd stay at the Holiday Inn Clarke quay, hotel up to its excellent standards from entering to leaving words can't say enough about the F1 would highly recommend anybody to do this trip"
,,First timers,5.0,,"First time watching F1 live in singapore and it was tremendous. Seeing many great drivers under the night lights with amazing views. Also, the addition of music performance made it worth every penny. Would love to go to Singapore GP again."
,,Brilliant F1 Under Lights,5.0,,"I don't ,know why I have not reviewed this before , have been there 11 times . If you like motor racing this is one for your bucket list.
The action under the lights , under body sparks , glowing red hot disc rotors all add to the atmosphere. Just a pity they do not have more support races as the there a lot of free time to walk eat and drink if that's your thing , the after party entertainments concerts are also great with a wide variety of artists."
,,Simply brilliant,5.0,,"Probably the best organised even5 I’ve ever attended and when you consider it’s actually multiple events all in one location it’s even more impressive. The race is great but the concerts and other entertainment is fantastic.

We went from concert to race and back to concert easily, great food and drink options.

If you haven’t been put it on your bucket list."
,,Finally got here after 11 years,5.0,,"Ever since they first announced that Singapore was getting a grand prix and it was a night event, I have wanted to go....and finally after 11 years, I got to experience my first overseas GP. I have been to the Adelaide GP as an youngster and more recently, to Melbourne for a few races, but it does not compare to the show the Singaporeans put on. I purchased Super Pit Grandstand tickets for the 3 days and was not disappointed. In addition to the chorus of engines, the off track entertainment was brilliant. Seeing Liam Gallagher, Simply Red, the Sugar Hill Gang, Dua Lipa was great, but Martin Garrix to finish off the GP with some killer beats was the cherry on the top. Worth EVERY penny spent!!!

Only downer you expect at any event like this is the price of food and drinks....but you take the good with the bad."
,,Brilliant Experience,5.0,,"Singapore F1 is where the city truly shines in all aspect. The night race (on one in the F1 calendar) is a must for every fan.

It was so well organized with ample food choices (long but fast moving lines), enough drink stands, clean toilets and plenty of activities. There's a lot of walking so wear comfy shoes!

Even if you aren't a racing fan, go for the experience and other activities. Whilst the tickets are expensive, it's worth every penny even if you're there for the music performances. We saw The Killers, Liam Gallagher and others. The Killers played a full set too.

It was my first time but planning to return in 2019.

Tip: stay at Boat Quay or anywhere along that area. Walking distance but also great area to hangout."
,,Fabulous night grand prix show,5.0,,"That was one od the best . We had Marina bay grandstand tickets and that was the best choice for us. Everything was excellent - very safe, lots of places to bay food znd drink. Everyone very helpful working hard to make visitors happy. Beautiful views across Marina by the Bay, Merlion absolutely love it. Grate experience definitely will come back."
,,Must go to GP,5.0,,"What an event. We have been going for 7 years now, and always love it more than the previous year. The entertainment is second to none for an event. Singapore is such a safe place, that you can walk around at any time of night. The F1 precinct is just a full on buzz with people from all over the world. Every year they put on at least 1 world class act on one of the many stages around the track.
Do yourself a favour, and visit this A CLASS EVENT."
,,F1,5.0,,"Wow Singapore you know how to put on a show , so well organised and the concerts and fireworks are out of this world"
,,Wonderful backdrop for F1,5.0,,We had marina bay grandstand tickets. What a wonderful view. The fireworks were incredible The grandstand was a little disappointing fir the racing. You did not see very much of the cars
,,fabulous night grand prix,5.0,,"This is one of the best. I will admit there isnt much opportunity for overtaking on the track so perhaps its not the most exciting racing. However, everything is excellent to make a perfect experience. Lots of places to buy food at all different price points as there are permanent restaurants and stalls inside the track. The best entertainment lineups and loads of it. The Padang stage is amazing and huge. Beautiful views across the harbour and all the big attractions like Merlion, Marina by the Bay etc. Great fireworks show. Great big clear screens so you dont miss any of the action both on and off track ."
,,F1 Singapore - Wow,5.0,,"What can I say “once in a lifetime experience for us”.

We arrived in Singapore on Thursday do had a day to acclimatise and find our feet. We made our way to the circuit Friday to watch the practice and soak up the atmosphere. We found our seats and had the most spectacular view over the bay. Luckily it’s a night race so your views change as the sun sets. We watched practice from bay grandstand (Fri), qualifying from Stanford (Sat) and the race from the pit straight (sun). I’d highly recommend trying a combination to get a feel for the race.

The whole circuit is spectacular and the staff work extremely hard, it’s amazing to hear that the ushers are all volunteers. Singapore should be very proud of their teenagers who take time out to support this yearly event.

Food n drink is similarly priced to the bars/ restaurants in some areas of Singapore so you don’t feel like your over paying once your in. (Apart from the ice creams $6 was pricy) They are plenty of things to do once your in the venue. Entertainment and pop up stands are spread out but be prepared to walk lots as the entrance and stands are some walk away.

Race night is filled with lots of atmosphere and the headline acts play pre-race. However you miss it if your not seated near the stage as you’d not see the pre race schedule if you watched the acts.

We were lucky enough to get a guided tour of the Parc Ferme Saturday night which allowed us to get a sneaky peak of the behind the scenes of F1. We got to meet a few of the drivers too who hung around with their crews. Total dedication to their team given the day ahead they had."
,,Exciting time.,4.0,,"We can cross this off our bucket list. The crowds were large (340,000 over the 3 days) and the heat can make it unpleasant, but the atmosphere is good, even if you're not a GP fan. (I'm not.) The music entertainment was great- we liked Liam Gallagher and The Killers- and the race was fun, though not exciting- not many places for the drivers to pass.
The fact it's at night and is lit up makes it quite a spectacle. A good night (or 3.)"
,,F1 at Singapore,5.0,,"Saw 3 days of F1 events. Night time and utterly complex circuit. Very tight bends and difficult to overtake. But it's great to see. This time they tried the ultra soft Tyre. Saw 2 crashes, one of Force India car. Entertainment was good but the shows had Asian flavor. Beer was great and pricey. Worth a visit for the experience."
,,MUST SEE Event in Singapore,5.0,,"The F1 Grand Prix in Singapore is one of the coolest racing events in the world. It is a night race through the heart of the city streets. You can enjoy this race on the sidewalk, in the grandstands, or at a rooftop bar or hotel party. If you are in Singapore for this event or traveling in the region around this race, it is a MUST SEE."
,,"Iconic venue, Limited Views",4.0,,"A truly amazing city and one of the great iconic F1 races.
Also being at night it is very dramatic.
Very expensive for just about everything, limited views, limited overtaking during the race, with not enough large screens.
Quite well organised, but could do with more signs showing where the entrance gates are.
Great entertainment throughout the weekend with some huge acts, this year The Killers were sensational.
Wear comfortable shoes, lots of walking required and be prepared for huge crowds.
Set right in the heart of a Singapore city, so a dramatic skyline, with amazing firework display right after the race! After the race, recommend a meal and few drinks at Boat Quay.
Worth doing, a fantastic weekend, but for me, just the once!
Incidentally, watching Lewis Hamilton win AGAIN, made the trip all the more worthwhile.
We managed to get invited to Singapore Cricket Club for F1 qualifying, a great venue, superb location with great food and drinks service, also a good spot to watch and listen to the banks on the Pedang Stage!"
,,3rd time,5.0,,"This is our third Singapore F1 GP. Such a great event and so well organized. Not just for race fans either as there is so much going on including fabulous entertainment.
Acts such as Liam Gallagher and The Killers on the main stage and Bjorn Again on smaller stages. The action before the main race in the pit is very exciting.
Recommend getting a three day multi ticket which means a different stand each day with Pitstand for the race. Being a night race also makes it quite beautiful as the city lights up."
,,Atmospheric setting but views are limited unless you pay for expensive tickets,3.0,,"How much you enjoy the Singapore GP will probably be dependent on how much money you have and ultimately how good a ticket you buy. I was on a basic ticket in the Bay Grandstand. The view wasn’t very good. I felt like I was watching a tennis match. Instead of following the ball from right to left it was the cars passing by. Also, as this is a street track the track is surrounded by high fencing and the track is even lower down so cars following the racing line maybe obscured even further. I appreciate this is for safety but it doesn’t really help for the viewing experience. I did go to the free viewing points at times and you could see the cars and drivers a bit closer but the view is nothing special. These points are better for the driver’s parade though.

The positive side is the atmosphere and the glamorous and stunning area it is set in. It was a buzz to be there and for me great to see my favourite driver LH44 get an amazing pole and dominate and win. But in reality the best place to watch this sport is via TV. In fact most of the time that was all I was doing watching the screens opposite the track!

The zone 3 and 4 my ticket allowed had some good restaurants and bars and there were a few concerts over the three days. As expected souvenirs and programme were quite expensive but you see that at every sporting event. I found the security and staff a mixed bunch. Some were friendly and helpful others just seemed they wanted you to leave the place as soon as the various sessions were over. A bit annoying when I wanted to buy a shirt from a shop after.

At the end of the race I noticed people walking the track but our stand and zone were not allowed. I assume the higher cost areas allowed this. Getting out and to the MRT station wasn’t too bad considering the amount of people.

I loved the setting, loved the atmosphere at times and loved the result but I would not sit in the same area again. But I heard the zone 1 and 2 areas tickets are sold for $1000s. When I win the lotto I’ll come back and enjoy this event in style."
,,Wonderful events,5.0,,"The circuit is made up by enclosed public road in Marina area. So, most of all guests who are staying hotels in the center of city can reach the circuit within 30 minutes by public way like MRT or Bus. Particularly Singapore GP is night race, the circuit is opened around 2-3 pm in the race days. Guests can enjoy sightseeing in Singapore until circuit opening, and then can came to circuit by MRT easily. There are official stores in the center of the city like Orchard. I enjoyed sightseeing in daytime and Grand Prix in night time. Singapore GP is considered well for guests."
,,2nd Singapore Grand Prix,5.0,,"Came to the Grand Prix in 2017 and had 3 great days. This year, last minute decision, to come and only could get a Sunday Zone 4 walkabout ticket. Last year I had 3 day premium Zone 1-4 walkabout and pit lane Grand Stand ticket on the Friday and Saturday. With the Zone 4 ticket you can get great access to the track with some excellent viewing areas. I watched the race from the hairpin bend by the Fullerton Hotel. Great view. The tickets are all expensive but I felt that the Zone 4 Sunday ticket at $188 was good value."
,,Electrifying atmosphere,4.0,,"Bought the walkabout tickets for Day 1. It was really dazzling to see the cars whizz past. I also really love the Jay Chou concert, despite needing to stand for 2 hrs to wait for the concert to start. It was money well spent!"
,,Never gets old,5.0,,"The Race and all the entertainment options make the Singapore Grand prix a must see , just doesn't get old."
,,Must try!,5.0,,It is a 3 day night race in the downtown where world top F1 Racers come to fight for the champinship. Organiser was quite experienced as the security check and flow of programm were very smooth. Alot of food and beverage stalls and activities to do or just shopping the merchendise. LOVE the daily concert after the race. You can buy all 3 days tickets package cheaper. There are event guide and update on their website so you can prepare yourself.
,,Third GP and it keeps getting better,5.0,,This is our 3rd GP and it keeps getting better. Really good set up of entertainment and racing along with food and drink stalls. Well organised. Love it.
,,Vroom Vroom Night,4.0,,Worthy experience - go Once and you will be hooked - must do as it’s the only night race in the world
,,Expensive but a real rush!,5.0,,Expensive but so worth the splurge for race enthusiasts and people seeking a unique experience. I think it gives a real adrenaline rush. Very dependant on whether you like watching races.
,,Best race ever,5.0,,"This has to be the best race, the tickets are expensive but I always enjoy this race. I have gone to these races for the last 5 years. Pit grandstand good for race action at the pits and the start. Turn 1,2 3 grandstand good for overtake and see the car in action. Bay grandstand is good for the view of Singapore. Walkabout is good to see the race in different sectors. I normally go to the track on the Thursday to see the safety car in action. The food is good. The music is good too. Really good weekend."
,,Formula 1 Grand prix circuit,4.0,,"The Singapore Formula 1 Grand Prix race takes place in September each year. It is night time race which I always watch on TV with interest.

To be here at the Formula 1 circuit in person was a thrilling experience. I walked on the circuit where cars race at around 200mph. I saw the pit buildings complex.

One of race sponsors is Singapore Airlines - and their logo is painted on the circuit for all to see.

Across the water - you can see the Cloud Forest dome - and the Art and Science Museum.

You can hire an electric scooter to go round part of the circuit. This is something that is interesting to try out."
,,Free Fun if you know where to be,4.0,,"The first ever nighttime Grand Prix is certainly worth a watch for that reason alone. Far too expensive for me, however, if you can get to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel before 6pm on the day of the race, they will let you in to their top floor restaurant and night club which overlooks about a third of the circuit. After 6pm it can be $100!"
,,Not so much a review about the Grand Prix but....,5.0,,So this is not a review about the Grand Prix as such but more about the circuit. We went on the Singapore Flyer and had noticed the track. In one the of shops in the complex is an electric scooter hire place. For $30.00 you can hire these for approx half an hour and go around a small part of track. Mainly the straight and grid but also part of the stand and road.They are already staring to work to get it up and ready for September but were more then happy for us to zoom up and down the road. We were pretty much left alone (except for when we got onto the road!) but had so much fun.. would highly recommend doing something like this.. so different form your normal things to do in Singapore and again .. SO MUCH FUN!
,,A work in progress,4.0,,This will clearly be impressive and I wish I would be there for the excitement that is to come. Work is well underway and marked progress can be seen daily.
,,A must for any F1 fan,5.0,,"Every F1 fan should visit the Singapore GP, awesome facilities and setup, easy to get to and from with the MRT."
,,SUPERB AMAZING,5.0,,"I am a motorsport fans and i've been to Malaysia to watch motoGP and this is my first F1 watching experience. Eventhough Malaysia hosting their last F1 this year, i choosed to visit SingaporeGP because it's more convinience for me than visiting Sepang.

I bought the ticket online few months before and i exchanged it at stamford hotel without any problem, and thank god the entrance is near that hotel, you can also spend your time by hanging around the Raffless City Mall next to the entrance.

The race was so fuun! my seat was not that far from track so i could easily see the car coming and you know what, F1 car look more stunning at night!

I have ordered my ticket for 2018 SingaporeGP, definitely worth to visit if you are a motorsport fan"
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"Racing cars in the middle of the city. It doesn’t get any better than that. The race expense includes festival-like atmosphere with music, food and people...lots of people. Once. In a lifetime experience. If you ever get a chance to see this race or any other in another country, I would suggest you do it. You will not be disappointed!"
,,My city!,5.0,,"Ok so I maybe biased as this is my city. But nobody does formula 1 like Singapore. Its so much better at night time, so much better in a city. And we have unrivalled music and entertainment. I love the formula 1 weekend. Its just a shame that the hotels feel it is a time to fleece the foreign tourists by charging 3-4 times the standard nightly rates. Singapore is already expensive enough!"
,,Singapore GP is a Great,5.0,,"Attended the 2017 Singapore GP.

Venue: Easy to get to given Singapore's efficient transit system. Well-organized venue with plenty of seating and attendants are available throughout the venue to assist with finding seat or something to eat. Seats are right next to the action. Variety of food options too.

Race: The race was equally spectacular with a number of crashes, making for a surprising win for Hamilton, who started from 5th.The twists and turns make this one of the more challenging tracks on the race calendar, but the sights and sounds are fantastic.

Bonus:A big plus with the Singapore GP is the free concerts with great artists. This year had Ariana Grande, Seal and Lianne La Havas.

Had a great time and highly recommend to anyone, especially those attending a GP race for the first time."
,,Amazing for racing fans,4.0,,The much awaited annual F1 is a Singapore and almost everyone favourite. The adrenaline rush and cheer excites many and the track is spectacular. A must visit for fans.
,,What other F1 circuits to you get to stand on the starting grid?,5.0,,"I downloaded the formula 1 map of the Singapore circuit then made my way to the Grandstand + starting grid via the 'Promenade' MRT station. Walk towards the Singapore Flyer then go left and you see the Grandstand with the grid marked out. Even for someone with a minor interest in formula 1 Grand Prix this is fascinating but for anyone with a REAL interest, this is a must AND ITS FREE!!!"
,,Never fails to impress...,4.0,,"Despite the fact that this year's raceday starting with a moderate (in our standards) rain, it did little to dampen the mood for the race.

Although we were not seated at the start line where the spectacular first lap incident occurred, the reactions of the crowds around us could clearly be heard as the top 3 drivers took themselves out.

Races certainly can't be won at the first lap but it sure can be lost there.

Having been to a number of circuits around the world, it does help that Singapore circuit is the better connected one in terms of transport and I could get straight home within 30 mins after leaving the circuit."
,,Exploring Asia,5.0,,We visited as we were in Singapore even though there was no racing happening. We were able to walk the track near the pit lane and photograph the pit garages with the F1 pictures still up. A great experience for an F1 fan
,,Planned for years....finally got there,5.0,,Went with husband and friends and had a great time. Nice location. Surrounded by good views. Bars etc a bit expensive as expected. Good fun...even if I am not really a GP buff.
,,What an Adrenalin rushing experience,5.0,,"If you love Formula 1 you will love the Singapore Race. I can't say enough about the facilities at The Singapore race. From the food, drinks to the concerts and entertainment there is so much happening.

And of course the race! So exciting to watch! Being from Perth of course we were going for Daniel Riccardo and he didn't disappoint. But it doesn't matter who your going for just being there watching the action and being in the atmosphere you definitely get your money's worth. The Singapore people know how to organise events and do this well.

We loved it so much we are already booking to go back:D

They recommend you catch the train to the race because there is a huge line up for taxis's at the end and from personal experience I agree. We got a return ticket for the train the operaters at Vivo train station were so helpful and explained how all the routes work and where to get on and off to get to the race, easy, We had passes back to Sentosa so took the monerail from vivo it was a smooth ride to and from the race back to our resort.

Definitely recommend this event. So much to enjoy as well as everything else in Singapore."
,,Fantastic venue and amazing result!,5.0,,"We booked on line direct with Singapore GP which worked out slightly cheaper that F1.com, we opted to collect tickets when we got there just in case we forgot to take them!! We were instructed to collect them from Raffles City Convention Centre which was a short walk from our hotel (Marina Mandarin) or in easy reach of City Hall MRT station, it is accessed from Raffles City Mall. We collected the tickets on Thursday and there was only a short queue.
Entrance to the circuit on Friday for Practice sessions was easy. We were told to get the MRT there but it was actually quicker to walk and we could mainly go through Malls which were air conditioned - a blessing as it is very humid indeed. We were told to get MRT from Esplanade to Nicoll Highway to Gate 1 as we were in Turn 1 Grandstand but we walked through Marina Mall and Suntec to Gate 2 and followed the signs/crowds from there. There wasn't a very big queue to get in and security was reassuringly tight with bag searches and metal detectors, security staff were friendly and welcoming.
You aren't allowed to take food in and can only take a small bottle of water in with you. You are allowed a normal camera but not supposed to take large professional cameras which is understandable as they would block the view of those around you.
The seating is typical of major events with uncomfortable seats and not much room so you really get to know your neighbours!! Volunteers and visible numbering made finding seats really easy.
Turn 1 Grandstand had a good view of the end of the start/finish straight and then turns 1 and 2 as well as the pit exit. there were 2 large screens opposite us. We were in Section A4 Row 4 which only had one row in front of us as the Marshalls area was in front of that.
We were near to the smaller Village Stage which had some of the acts on - we saw Duran Duran and Seal but the main Padang Stage was a long walk away and although we had hoped to get to see Calvin Harris there after the race on Sunday by the time we had watched the celebrations and got lost about half way there we decided not too. There wasn't enough signage between the 2 ends of the circuit.
There were food stalls but the queues were long - especially on Sunday and the food offering wasn't great particularly for veggies, its worth getting a few bottles of water early on when you go in before the queues get too big as you need to drink plenty in the humidity.
The atmosphere in the Grandstand was good - we got a lot of stick during qualifying from all the Australian Fans surrounding us when Hamilton only managed 5th! We prayed for rain and got it at just the right time at the start of the race. This was the first wet race in 10 years - we were luckily under a motorway flyover so stayed dry! We were in an ideal position for the big crash at the beginning of the race and got our own back on our neighbours as Hamilton won!
You can get onto the track for the podium from Turn 1 Grandstand but there was a big rush to get onto track so we just watched on the screen instead.
There are plenty of toilets around and they are all kept clean and stocked with toilet paper and hand towels throughout the weekend.
There were Porsche and Ferrari Challenges for the supporting races which were exciting too.
Overall it was a fantastic weekend"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"As an avid F1 fan, i was excited to be able to attend my first live grand prix experience in Singapore. Personally, i think the event itself will cater to people who like F1 or if you don't, the off entertainment for the events will probably be enough to keep you entertained.

The whole atmosphere of the race is just absolutely amazing.

We had a combination ticket which we thought was of good value for money as it allows us to view the race/qualifying from different sections of the race track on different days. Getting around to and from the circuit is pretty convenient via public transport.

Though it's pretty costly overall to visit Singapore during the F1, especially with the soaring hotel prices for that weekend, but the whole experience makes it worth it."
,,Great Experience,4.0,,"Street circuit , very close to the real action
Racing around the night lights of beautiful Singapore
Besides the F1 race, there are Ferrari Challenge cup, lots of food, games, great concerts and entertainments by big name celebrities and best DJ in the world
Fireworks at the end of the race
Super well organized, everything is so orderly despite the crowd
What more could I ask for ?"
,,F1 - 2017,5.0,,"Wow, where do I start?

I have general walkabout tickets, which meant I had excess to Zone 4. This meant I had to watch the track action from the temporary bleacher. Because it's a street circuit you can't really see what's happening apart from the rest of the track, no matter where you are watching the race from, so when booking tickets keep an eye out for the screen so that you can follow the race.
After every day ends there is a international headliner which really makes the race worth it.
One major concern I have had is the main stage, there are very narrow steel gates.
It takes 20 mins or so for the crowd to get out, the risk of stamped is very high, I hope the organizers do something about this.
So in the end, if you are a F1 fan go for the race. (Keep in mind this is a street race) If you are not into F1 and are tagging along with someone, don't worry all the concerts and off stage entertainment and food will keep you happy.

So decide what tickets suit your needs the most and go for it, you won't regret it."
,,You better like F1 because this is the highlight of the year Megga Experiance,5.0,,"Well our family is F1 fans and I splashed out on air tickets and turn two seats was I disaponted hell No it was probably the best spent money .
The track is said to be on par with the big ones and it didn't disappoint as a night race it adds the experience we got to see drivers close ,up we got disappointed hamilton was going to come probably 5th we got exited it went to pot and the race changed or transformed the experience the crowd was electric cheering alive its hard to describe the orange army for vestapen cheering and adding to experience until he crashed . so this is a unmissable item the big wheel was free the entertainment is imense the acts cost a bomb to see are all free , if you get a pit walk take it , sum that up as unforgettable. this is a short one or I write pages because I loved it so much , buy your ticket early research the best seats and you will love it if your budgets small go for walk round access loads good places to stand not busy but dont miss the end track access to podium you need rite gate to get in also the drivers walk in at gate at certain times to get autographs or pictures , so Hello Singapore F1 2018 ,"
,,Stunning F1 Circuit,5.0,,Wonderful time in Singapore especially at the Grand Prix which includes access to many concerts and side shows throughout the weekend. You also get free access to the Singapore Flyer once inside the circuit. There are numerous food outlets and bars to choose from and the costs are on a par with anything outwith the venue.
,,Great Bang For Your Buck !,5.0,,"Only the second time attending the Singapore F1 night race and once again loved it.
Personally I feel the event caters for 3 sets of people.
Those that love their F1, those that want to attend the concerts and those like myself that are there for both.
While I would like to experience what zone 1 and 2 offer, I find it hard to justify the expense.
As in my previous attendance, I booked the 3 day Bay Grand Stand seats, as I feel this offers the best value for money.
You are guaranteed a seat, 2 large screens are directly opposite the stand, a superb view of Marina Bay, large undercroft area under the stand with food and drink outlets plus more large screens.....also great in the event of rain !
With this ticket you can still roam the walkabout areas in zones 3 and 4, which offer some good vantage points !

One thing that stands out with the Singapore event is the ease in which you access the track and also exiting....
Queues are minimal.
The SMRT put on extra trains post event to move people swiftly.
Or you can quite possibly just walk back to your hotel....many hotels will be accessible in a 15-20 minute walk.

Looking forward to attending a few more night races in Singapore, now it has been extended for a further 4 years :-)"
,,Singapore F1,5.0,,Everything you could ask for and more in F1! The part is alive in Singapore! The night race adds a whole new dimension to F1 racing. F1 purists will live this race!
,,great circuit,5.0,,One of the most interesting circuits in the F1. Very well organised. Ticket price includes an extensive entertainment program. Happy to hear that the contract was extended for another 4 years
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Into their 10th year the show was very well organised and efficient. We brought the tickets online in advance. Delivered on time. Checked all details before departure. A very pleasant evening. Worth the visit!
,,2017 10 year anniversary F1 Night race,5.0,,"Well I had the privilege of attending this event as a Flag Marshal, first time to Singapore and I loved every second of it. If you enjoy Motorsports and you have not been to this event at Singapore you have another 4 years to plan a trip with this event secured until 2021."
,,Best F1 Grand Prix,5.0,,"Well done Singapore. This grand prix is an event rather than a car race. There is so much atmosphere, it is hard to take it all in. They seem to get the entertainment right every year. With world class acts continuously around the track, you will never be bored. This year we noticed a lot more food and drink vendors, however, the ques are still very long, whilst there are no cars on track. I would highly recommend a visit to the Singapore F1 event to any enthusiast. The added bonus is that Singapore is a great Place in its own right."
,,best race and city to watch race,5.0,,"still cant believe that a city like singapore can shut down major areas and roads and hold the best race of the year,its a credit to organisers and the people of singapore,we always go for the 3 day pass in zone 4,plenty of things to see,do,eat,drink,some great spots to view race,went to first one in 08 and things have just got bigger and better every year,hope this race stays forever.SINGAPORE F1 IS A++++++++++++ ,we thank you for always putting on the best event on the F1 calander."
,,Great Grand Prix experience - 2017,5.0,,"Singapore is a great destination so one of the perfect times to visit is during the Singapore G.P. The event is extremely well organised and plenty to see and do for all ages. It was easy to have a great view of the race track. The entertainment was excellent between events and something to suit everyone. Adriana Grande was excellent, as was Duran Duran (we won't talk about The Chainsmokers which were very awful), Calvin Harris was very popular also. This was my first ever GP experience and one I hope to repeat in the future, especially as The Singapore Govt has just extended hosting this event for the next 4 years. The males in our group absolutely loved the entire experience."
,,What an amazing event,5.0,,"By far not the cheapest way to spend a weekend in Singapore but definitely a memory you won't forget.

Fast cars, great music and artists not to mention the rain and humidity.
Be prepared to feel damp constantly along with a hundred thousand other people all at the same time. What is not to love.

A very well organised event considering the logistic of putting this kind of thing on.

ONE COMPLAINT !!!!!
The organiser need to give people chance to get around the site after the race to see the headline acts.
It is impossible to get from Zone 1 to the main stage at The Padang to see the headline acts, missed half of the performance. Too many clashes with the programme.

That said I will be buying super early bird tickets as soon as they are released for 2018

Brilliant !!!!!"
,,2017 race,5.0,,Amazing set up For low budget the zone 4 us enough to see cars closely For top budget highly recommend booking room in fullerton top floor or MBS for view of the fireworks from the infinity pool
,,Great night,5.0,,"We came to Singapore to attend this event and we weren't disappointed. We checked out the venue on Thursday just to see where we were sitting and the Padang stage.

Pre race concert with Duran Duran was excellent as were our seats in the Bay Marina Stand.

The catering was really good and not as expensive as we thought it was going to be considering Singapore prices.

All the staff on duty at the venue were excellent very friendly and to be commended for the job they did.

We had a brilliant time."
,,Great event!,4.0,,Really great event! Free access to the Flyer was a plus! The concert behind the first coner shoul have ended before the drivers parade. It was impossible to hear the speaker. All in all the event was great!! We would have liked another winner 🙈
,,A must see,5.0,,"What an atmosphere
The first and best F1 night race. It's stunning. The atmosphere is electric
I've been to many Grand Prix and this is right up there
Everyone is so helpful and friendly
The track is amazing and the viewing great
So much more going on too. Some great bands in concert too
Even sitting in the rain to watch a thrilling opening lap. Just wonderful"
,,10th Anniversary,4.0,,"I was a guest in the first race and wanted to watch this 10th edition as then the announcement to extend the race circuit was not known. Of course it is now going for the next 4 years.
It was a wet start and Ferarri crashes out giving Hamilton and Mercedes the window and title.
Ground too wet to stay around.
Probably my last.
The crowd is big. I observed mostly foreigners in our Grandstand. I supposed this is tourism dollars at play."
,,Amazing time,5.0,,My first time here and I'm loving the energy. Tickets are pricey so try to find some corporate to sponsor you. Looking forward to qualifying and the actual race!
,,Singapore Grandpix,5.0,,"SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX
If you like fast cars and Formula 1, then a trip to see the Singapore Grand Prix is what you need to do. Great food and local culture, mixed with the fast pace and glitz of Grand Prix racing weekend. I got a ticket that gave me free entry to the Singapore Fyer, a huge ferris wheel located above the race track. I was able to spend the days sightseeing Singapore, and afternoons and evenings taking in the thrills and spills of the races. I managed to get up and close with Fernando Alonso, and had trackside location at the end of the start finish straight which was an amazing experience."
,,Singapore F1 - Only F1 Night Race,4.0,,"Come to Singapore F1 night race in September. The only night F1 race in the heart of a city. See the F1 cars race on actual city road with lighted Singapore skyscrapers in the background. Instagrammable night photos await.

Photos are the warm up weekend events to the actual race."
,,where i can sell the tickets,5.0,,"I've purchased two tickets for the Singaporean Grand Prix (esplanade waterfront grandstand on 16th of September) from Formula 1 web site,However, due to some unforeseen events that would prevent me from coming to Singapore. So when i contact F1 customer care they told me you can sell it to any Authorized dealer,so if it is possible to buy them from me or direct me to a place where i can sell them as it is impossible to attend the event and i will lose the tickets price.

I hope anyone can help me."
,,Love the Vibe,5.0,,"There's not much you can watch for the race. But you can find a super large screen in the middle of a field that usualy turned into concert stage for the main singer/entertainer.
The party vibe is superb. Very happy to be able to hang out until the race finished."
,,Arguably the best F1 track to visit,5.0,,"We attended the 2016 Singapore Grand Prix and out of all the other tracks I have visited, Singapore is arguably one of the best overall. It is not by any means the cheapest and due to the track being a street circuit there isn't one place that offers brilliant views. But what it lacks in pricing and views it more than makes up for in atmosphere, organisation and off-track activities.

We were at the Bay grand stand which is the cheapest grandstand overlooking the corner before the cars drive underneath the stand. This offers limited view of the cars but a great backdrop of the Marina Bay. We also got access to the free music events each night which included Bastille, Imagine Dragons and Queen.

It really appealed to those in the party who were less interested in the grand prix. Everyone is really friendly and informative and being in the city there is plenty of choices for food and drink. With easy access to the MRT system is makes it very easy to get away from the track after.

The Padang stage area was a great place to rest and catch some music and really just soak up the weekend, highly recommend visiting this part of the track if you are going for the F1."
,,Best of all the F1GPs,5.0,,"I have travelled to numerous F1 Grand Prix events, and I have to admit that Singapore F1 Grand Prix is my favourite hands down! The organisation is out of this world. The value for money and complimentary concerts spectacular. Just the best scenery and entertainment.
Marina Bay is lit up in all it's glory and the Merlion a chameleon of colours! I will go again and again. So enjoyed our visit to Singapore for the F1 Grand Prix."
,,Exhilarating and Free Views,5.0,,"I will focus this review on providing tips that is most useful:
- Don't bother to pre book tickets. You can get so many last minute deals at throw away prices on gumtree or carousell apps. Also many try to sell off excess inventory at Raffles or City Hall MRT
- Every stand offers its own uniqueness. So chose the stand that's best for your needs speed vs turns vs grandstand etc
- If you are not too keen to watch the after race concerts you can even sell off your tickets at carousell app and recover a part of your investment :)
- If you are not that type to invest 100s of $ to buy a ticket then some places inside Marina Mall emergency exit stairs offer free views and they are quite good spots. Hunt around some places during the qualification days and geo mark them for the race day.
- You can even book some restaurants on the 3nd or 3rd floor that offer the street view to the race. Nothing Beats a beer in hand inside ACed space ;)"
,,Must See,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore during the race, you HAVE to go. I had never been into F1, or seen a race, and after having seen this im hooked! I will be going to the Monaco Grand Prix this year all because of how amazing my experience here was. They do an amazing job putting this on."
,,Amazing amazing amazing,5.0,,"If there is one F1 circuit that I would go to every year it would be Singapore.

It's so well organised and the transport in and out of the GP is second to none. Forget driving, MTR is the only way to travel.

Beware, at the end of the race the marshalls escort you in one direction which is generally away from the MTR to avoid congestion. Walk towards the pits and away from turn 1 and 2.

If you have premium tickets it will get you on the Singapore Flyer too.

Enjoy"
,,F1 Singapore fantastic,5.0,,"This was the best f1 and city I have ever being to.. city and people are lovely . F1 itself was class and the concert's on after it was brill. The time we where there Bon Jove was playing and again he was fantastic..
Love that place and would defo go back.."
,,Great experience,5.0,,those loud car sound are music to my ears..... i just bought zone 4 ticket that is the cheaper one but it also worth it... be sure to eat before you go there because the food inside the venue is little bit pricey....
,,Night Racing,5.0,,"Had a great time on the Bayfront grandstand cheering for Vettel! Me and my husband was delighted and in awe to see this for the first time.

The F1 team and staffs are super friendly and very much accomodating esp when asking for directions. I got a small cut and leg pain due to the whole day walking and sightseeing, and medics are everywhere on standby to help. Thank you so much!

We already fell inlove with Singapore and surely be back next time for more."
,,Night racing,5.0,,"Superb racing, not just F1 but the support races too. Plenty of ticket options to suit all pockets. Great off track entertainment which has no rival elsewhere on the F1 calendar."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,Great time had by all. Just an incredible event packed with entertainment. Great way the spend a few evenings in Singapore. We cannot wait for next year! Truly a world class event in an amazing city!
,,Amazing,5.0,,"First time in Singapore and the whole weekend was amazing, a great line up of acts,the staff very friendly when helping find your seat. The atmosphere was amazing. Lots of choice of food, merchandise and an easy accessible location."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"The Grand Prix Festival including, the F1 Race itself, and the entertainment was superb. Night racing is spectacular of course with only Bahrain doing it, but the addition of Kylie and Queen on the Friday and the Saturday evenings, plus other bands, finished off the enjoyment to the full. Get the Grand Prix weekend on to your bucket list. You will never regret it!!"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"From ordering the tickets to the final show, it was well organised. Under the lights with the Singapore skyline as a backdrop and combined with the tropical climate, it's quite surreal.
Lots to do around the circuit. There's plenty of food outlets, the hawker stalls provide the best value. There are also shops, bars, souvenir stalls and even the main sponsor Singapore Airlines had a big exhibit.
The only gripe was the rather long walk to the far end of the Bay grandstand. This is probably to ensure the flow from just one end. But it's easy to walkabout if you fancy it and to view the action from the trackside or even rooftops.
Each night is topped off with live concerts in various areas. This year was headlined by Kylie Minogue and Queen. The winner of the race triggers off a wonderful firework display."
,,Great Event even for a non Rev Head,5.0,,"Attended the 2016 F1 Grand Prix in Singapore enjoyed the 3 days, my highlight was definitely the Queen concert with Adam Lambert ""what an entertainer"" Unfortunately Riccardo didn't win. Not sure if I would attend again but ticked it off the bucket list."
,,Incredible experience,5.0,,The best F1 experience. Atmosphere is great and the staff are friendly and all look happy to be there. Even converted my fiancé into a Formula 1 fan! I have been twice and both times have been amazing. Fingers crossed I get to go for a third time.
,,Singapore Grand Prix F1 Night Racing 2016,5.0,,"Weather you are not interested in F1 or GT, you should go.
Extremely awesome sight & sound of night racing will blow up your stereotype!!
Weather you are with friends or family, everyone can enjoy.
There are huge live of famous artist (2016 was Queen & Adam Lambert) and
lots of entertainer will make you happy!!
Moreover, many kinds of delicious F&B are waiting for you.
Make reservation for next year and pack up now!!"
,,Amazing event,5.0,,"I've been to a few F1's in Australia and Asian regions and by far this is the most organised sporting event I've been to. I order my tickets online in Australia and expectedly thought the collection of these passes would be a nightmare, couldn't be further from it. From the collection of the passes, the entertainment and public transportation was amazing and to top it all of an Australian came second. Thank you Singapore for enjoyable experience"
,,Best experience ever!,5.0,,"Travelled to Singapore for the F1 and it was absolutely amazing. Not even a Formula One fan however it was an amazing event. Every day and night there was something to do and I enjoyed every bit of it from the races to concerts, both in the arena and in downtown Singapore. I would suggest it to anyone, fans or not. My only advice is to wear breathable clothing and pack a fan! It's very hot in Singapore !"
,,What an amazing experience!!!,5.0,,"First time at the Formula 1 and what a great way too experience it in Singapore, the atmosphere and experience was just mind blowing. We had great seats in the grandstand sitting right on the finish line. Will definitely be back again!"
,,"First time F1 GP, amazing",5.0,,"Went on the Sunday. Sat in stand two rows from track and watch the Ferrari challenge, porsche cup and F1 finals. What a fantastic experience. The organisation of such an event in a crowded city is incredible. Look forward to the next"
,,Great for Racing & Music fans alike!,5.0,,"I was really lucky to catch the F1 circuit in Singapore! It's an amazing experience for racing fans & music fans alike. Besides the races, you can catch musical artists & other performers before & after the race.

A word of advice, if possible try to leave any bags/clutches at home as there is a security bag check at the gate. We were able to pass through much faster by keeping essentials in pockets alone."
,,the most complete formula 1 race,5.0,,"As compared with other formula 1 races/venues, this one is THE complete package. I find those reviews that gave poor or average reviews as queer because they feel its not worth it for different reasons. If you are an F1 enthusiast, or concerts, or just looking for a weekend that feels like a party each and every night, this place is for you. So to these critics, STOP complaining! To each to his own and this night race weekend provides that. There are other F1 races whose vantage points are superior to those in singapore f1. If so, go to those places as Sing F1 is obviously not for you. Mind you, this is a night race as other races are done during the day so if you want to stay under the sun, go to other races. A night race in my opinion provides a more pleasant experience.

For the complete package, an entrance fee allows the patron multiple choices of watching the race, several concerts, several booths of multitudes of activities. and if you like ferraris or porsches they also have their own race at late afternoons. By the way, this is the only F1 race that includes not just 1 concert, but at least 1 main concert every night for 3 nights. For this year's, we are talking of several. I was able to watch 4 out of the 6 either at Padang or at the Esplanade outdoor Theatre. The ultimate concert experience with Queen and Adam Lambert, and an exciting race with a close finish between Rosberg and Ricciardo. Yeah, you can watch it on TV. But its just the same as watching a live ppv boxing match: its different watching it on TV versus watching it live even if the protagonists are matchbox sizes. The noise of the formula 1 cars zooming, the rumble, the cheering of the different loyalists, you can't feel that on TV.

Expensive food and drinks but then again, such is the case when going to places like universal studios. regardless of the price of a cup of beer at $10, beer galore."
,,music is great,3.0,,"Not my favorite GP. General admin ticket gives you very restricted view of the track with the only good viewing points, being mid straights. I wouldn't pay to attend this GP again, other than to see a great band. There are plenty of places in nearby bars and shopping centers with free views of the race being a night race"
,,First F1 Experience - won't be the last!!! Wow!,5.0,,"We organised our 8 day trip to Singapore, and later found out the Grand Prix was on when we were due to arrive on the 2nd Race day. We were at the Grand Prix within 2.5hours of landing in Singapore.

Arriving there in the dark and in a hurry, it took a while to get our bearings. We missed most of the Pentatonix concert cause we got lost several times.

Once we got ourselves sorted - it was Wow Wow and more Wow.

We had tickets in the Bay Grandstand - I'm glad I had seats and not the walkabout tickets, as the heat etc, it was just nice to sit and watch the race or the big screen we had infront of us. When we go again, our kids will be much older - so we will spend more money on better seats for the two of us.

The concerts were fantastic. It was ashame Pentatonix was moved on the Saturday night, the stage for them was too small with such a large crowd wanting to see them.

Queen was amazing with Adam Lambert, Hasley was brilliant. I took my teenage daughter to the Padang stage to see her - and I am a fan now.

The food choices were excellent in some spots. Much better than others.

The F1 was definitely the highlight of our 8 days in Singapore. We will be back. Never been to an F1 before, only V8's - but we loved it. A fantastic atmosphere.

The even is extremely well run. Things don't run as well where I'm from - they were great.

Loved it."
,,Once in life time,5.0,,F1 night race in Singapore is amazing ! I went to 3 days event and it's not bord me at all. Went to the area every afternoon to see the GT race it's so fun. City race makes you so up close to the cars and even we bought tickets with set but still love to just find some standing spot. But the foods and drinks there are super expensive you just need to find a place near zone 3 a street with food booth you can get 8 for beer otherwise it's 12 at the most of the place.
,,Wow great event,5.0,,This was my first Grand Prix and I'm from the USA! This was amazing and the night race made it that much better! This is a must even if your not into the race. So much to do and see even concerts at night this year was Queen!! Wow!!
,,"F1 Hot, humid, fast and fun",5.0,,We organised tickets in the Esplanade stand. Easy to access off the MRT then a short stroll. Great view of Marina Bay from the stand. Lots of good eating at the stalls and many restaurants/bars nearby. Concerts too. Friendly crew. A fun night race
,,OMG!!!!!,5.0,,"Went for a week over the recent F1 period, booked tickets with BookF1, although the tickets we were allocated were abit naff to say we bought the most expensive and our request for the highest level not fulfilled. There were some spare seats in the next turn to us so we cheekily had those for the duration the race. So THE BEST SEATS are actually turn two not turn 1. We had head on views of all the cars as they left the grid. Fab race, fab environment. Have been to quite a few races now but this has to be the best organised. Every member of staff at the event was so smiley and helpful and I believe they volunteer - ten out of ten F1 Singapore. Can't fault."
,,What an experience!,5.0,,"I booked seats in the marina facing grandstand, called HOT TIX. What an amazing night view of the marina and buildings. You could hear the cars coming, and the would accelerate then do a massive deceleration into the hard left turn under the stadium. Instructions were clear to gain entry, I lived out east and would catch the 36 bus to Suntec and then walk to the 15mins into the GP areas. These tickets also gave us access to the concerts and were reasonably priced for the 3 days. Definitely worth the experience, I am not a big car racing fan but the atmosphere was great and well executed by the organisers."
,,City Night Race,5.0,,"It was very entertaining night race in the city. The post race concert are also entertaining, therefore we will get both the race and the concert."
,,Holiday of a Lifetime,5.0,,"Wow - Simply an Extravaganza that must rate with one of the worlds great event attractions; and F1 is only part of this great weekend spectacle. World class entertainment with something for everyone This year Kylie Minogue, Queen & Adam Lambert and KC & Sunshine Band were of my genre but much more. Took my sister and husband to their first F1 race - they were hooked. Combined the 3 day event with a 10 day vacation in Singapore. Impressive and memorable. We will come back."
,,Impressive!,4.0,,"F1 through the city! Wow, this is great stuff. I've attended many races and if you like F1, and you're around go for this race. What is different? You're able to be so close to the track, that you can really hear and feel the sound. Next to that, there are fantastic acts and performances after the race to enjoy. ( we had kylie minogue and queen, the real queen indeed). Recommendations: Go for zone 1 or 4. 2 if you really like to be in the singapore flyer, zone 3 is basically the Marina Bay grand stand, which is nice but not the best place to stay. Zone 4 walk about give you options at many places with a good view on the screen to watch the race. So depending on your budget, this is my recommendation. Prices for food and drinks are too high, but this is normal during f1 races. Don't think about it... take it and enjoy!"
,,Unbelievable Weekend...,5.0,,"Going to my first GP I didn't really know what to expect, but Singapore delivered big time!

We had the premier 3 day walkabout tickets and made good use of them, attending all three days and sampling what the GP has to offer.

Everything was brilliant - easy to get in, get around, helpful staff, well priced food and drink, could get very close to the track - everything.

Also the fact it is a night race with the city overlooking and lit up at night is breathtaking.

A highlight off the track was the opportunity to see Queen and Adam Lambert live after the action on the Saturday. Great show and great crowd singing along.

Overall a brilliant experience and one that I will look forward to revisiting in future!"
,,3 Great Nights of Entertainment,5.0,,"This year we chose the 3 Grandstand pass, so a different stand for each night. Good to see the action from different parts of the track and watching the racing live is always great. Add to that including all the concerts it make for a pretty well priced ticket. Fortunately for us the Bastille and Queen on Saturday night was right next to our stand so was easy to get too. If you care about the concerts then picking the Padang Grandstand would be a good choice.

A Danny Ric win would have capped off a great weekend of entertainment but unfortunately 2nd place it had to be, but still a very good result!"
,,Outstanding event,5.0,,"Came to Singapore for 6 days to experience Singapore and the F1 Grand Prix. After being involved in the Melbourne Grand Prix for a number of years, I always wanted to experience the the night race and all Singapore has to offer. It didn't fail to disappoint.

I spent the Thursday night walking around the precinct and surprisingly a lot it of it was not locked down and we had good access to many areas which gave us good feel for viewing platforms and locations.

For the price of the Zone Four ticket at $78 , we had great access to the practice sessions and great concerts by KC and the sunshine band and Kylie. As in previous reviews, to get to the main stage and great access you have to get their a little earlier. At the stage they has large screens and it was good chance to rest and enjoy the moment.

I enjoyed watching the qualifying session from the Marina Bay observation deck which gave a great overview of the track and Singapore city. Amazing views and well worth it. They also has screens on the observation deck which helped tracking the sessions.

The event speaks for itself. Great views, sights and the race result never failed to disappoint. Be prepared for the heat and humidity and keep your fluids up. Drinks can be quite expensive but this is not due to the event, just general Singapore pricing. Security at the event was high and I felt safe. Lots of volunteers and clearly a strong volunteering program.

Well done and be back next year no doubt. Any tips - book accomodation early as it gets quite expensive the closer you get to the track."
,,A Great Venue,5.0,,"One of the best venues for F1 of many that i have experienced.
The beer pricey at twenty singapore dollars, i expect to pay more inside the circuit but this was excessive as where the price of the seats, 620 British pounds each, compared with equivalent seats at Silverstone costing 380 pounds."
,,Overpriced,3.0,,"We paid for walk about tickets in Zone 4. We have been to the Indy 500 and felt Grand Prix was overpriced for the qualifying races on Saturday night. Lots of stairs and the escalators were not working. Few places to sit or see the cars. If you want to see one of the music venues arrive 1.5 hours before it begins. Each person is allowed one bottle of water to bring in. Make sure you do as it is hot and humid and prices are expensive on the grounds. The headline ""Queen"" concert was excellent and located on zone 4. If you are a Formula One fan I suppose it would be worth it. If you are just curious don't think it is worth your time and money. Hotels charge a huge increase in price when the Grand Prix is on. Swissotel on Stamford is directly across from gate 3 and an excellent location to stay. You can pay extra and have a room facing the race track. You can also take a 30 minute ride on the Singapore Flyer (42 story Ferris wheel) while the race is in progress and watch the cars running on the track as it goes directly around the attraction!"
,,2016 Singapore GP,4.0,,"Attended this years GP after booking 12 months earlier. Was so excited and wasn't let down. It was our first ever live GP and we chose Singapore because of its close proximity from Perth, and great weather. We weren't let down. The race was exhilarating!
Ticket collection was a breeze and the seats we were given were great. We sat in Padang on Friday, the Bay Saturday and Pit Straight for the race on Sunday. It was great to get a different perspective.
We absolutely loved watching the race live and having so many screens around with commentary was fantastic. We took radios but never used them. We bought food at the venue, which was pretty typical of food at most venues.
We support Daniel Riccardo and he nearly got there at the end. We really wanted to get on the track after the race to see the presentations, but only 1 gate opened along pit straight. With everyone in the grandstand trying to get through, we didn't make it onto the track until presentations had finished. This was our biggest disappointment. We could see people entering from all other directions, but we thought being so close, we would have been let out first. When we finally got onto the track, we had time for a couple of photos before being ushered off again, and the long walk out.
The only other disappointment was the size of the concert venue at Padang. I believe it was turned in the other direction from previous years. Not sure if this made the space smaller or larger but we could not get in, so had to watch the screens from outside the venue. Really wanted to see Queen, as they are one of our favourite bands. We weren't the only ones, there were 1000's who could not get in. We heard so many people complaining to the security that we were standing next to. Maybe they could increase the size next year.

But loved the whole experience and would do it again."
,,Loved every minute,5.0,,"Standing ovation to the organizers of the event. From the ticket purchase to ticket collection, from reaching the event to leaving it...every detail was carefully thought of and planned really well. The signage, the directions, the website, the staff around there, the place, ease to get around there...absolutely loved it! We are definitely going back next year."
,,Great!,5.0,,"I previously had no interest in F1 but was coincidentally in town so decided to go to the qualifying. Super well organised as you would expect, exciting nighttime racing and a great concert afterwards. I want to go again!"
,,Fantastic night race,5.0,,"Been to F1 races before bit never a night race. Brilliant. Anyone who is an F1 should try it if at all possible, Only downside 13 our flight from UK> No other negatives - love Singapore!"
,,A must do,5.0,,"Trip was in the planning for 12 months and we were not disappointed
Our first F1 race and boy what a race to pick
We didn't scrimp on the tickets and got a 3 day turn 1 grandstand ticket around £500 but worth every penny!
Best seat n the house you see turns 1,2 & 3 all the action on the first corner from the start
If your sat by a straight you just see a blur as the cars roar past
Other reviews mention earplugs and the noise we took them but you've just got to get in to the whole atmosphere and hear the sound of the engines
It might sound expensive but where else could you get 3 nights of racing plus 3 superb nights of concerts Kylie Minogue, Bastille, Queen, Imagine Dragons, Pentatonix & KC & the Sunshine Band plus Dynamo and scores of other local acts and entertainers
Few tips:- wear loose clothing it is hot humid and in the crowds at the end invariably uncomfortable wear flip flops take a portable fan
Eat at Singapore Flyer unless you like paying £8 for an un appetising burger or you really like nachos and hot dogs the food at the flyer is local dishes at a fraction of the price

If you are staying at the Marina Bay Sands Do Not go on to the track at the end of the race you can not get back off it and end up having to walk past your exit for the hotel by some considerable way only to then have to walk back all whilst dripping in sweat as it is so hot

Do take lots of photos do buy the best ticket you can afford and do go it is one of the best weekends and experiences of my life!"
,,"First F1 Race, it was awesome.",4.0,,"Watching F1 on tv is nothing to actually going to the race, as you don't get to fully experience the power of these cars. The sound of their engines, ripping by you, tires sparking on the pavement, ripping around corners, you can feel the vibration of the engine on the ground, and they go sooo fast its crazy.

Was in Singapore for 2 days, didn't know the grand prix existed here until the cab driver told us. Getting tickets, was easy in thought. I walked over to Raffel City and bought tickets for the walk about in zone 4 as it was the cheapest ticket. However, my recommendation is they need a more organized and efficient way of buying and collecting tickets. As i was the only one in line and still had to wait like 20 min until someone was able to help me.

The race was great, and entry was efficient and quick. With Zone 4 walk about, you can only enter the race at 2:30pm, no earlier. They had mini races and practices going on all day, there is music and food. They could use more stands selling water as it is HOT.

Stay hydrated, and if you have sensitive ears, bring ear plugs or headphones to block some of the noise."
,,Awesome night of Formula 1 racing!!,5.0,,"Last night was the 2016 Singapore Grand Prix, a mate and I had spent the past few days at the track for practice and qualifying but the main event was the F1 race and it didn't disappoint.

We purchased tickets early from the official website and set ourselves up in the Bay side grandstand. The tickets were $298 for the three day pass and picked up on arrival at the track from the ticketing booth within the Swissotel hotel at Cityhall MRT.

The whole weekend was amazing with entertainment both on and off track throughout the 3 days, it was the first time I have been to this event and it was definitely world class. The ticketing was exceptional and there are no fears when purchasing online from the official website.

The seating is very good in all stands and the hospitality of the hosts was wonderful. The beer was cold and the food pretty good around the track, there really was no need to leave until closing time. Best of all was Redbull Racings Daniel Riccardo he was exceptional and out drove his cars ability yet again. In the right car this bloke is a world champion!

I will be back again and loved every minute of the weekend well worth the trip."
,,"Outstanding- if you go to one GP, make it Singapore",4.0,,"Our second visit for the Singapore GP, and it confirmed all our impressions from last year -- it's a fantastic event!

Firstly, the venue. The street track is unbelievably well located around Marina Bay-- it is beautiful, interesting, and takes full advantage of everything the area has to offer. Secondly, getting there is a breeze-- lots of MRT stations service the track, and it couldn't be easier or cheaper getting there anywhere from Singapore. Thirdly, there are lots of existing bars and restaurants you can eat and drink in, plus the special pop ups for the event. The prices are pretty reasonable for a big event-- you don't feel you are getting ripped off. The security and all entry arrangements are as efficient as everything is in Singapore.

Then the races themselves. The night racing is terrific-- the cars gleam under the lights, photography is great, stands are well located, and the track is challenging and interesting. Plenty of big screens keep you up to date with all aspects of the race.

Finally, the entertainment is continuous, accessible, and of high quality. We saw Queen, Bastille and Imagine Dragon perform, and the staging and ease of access was great.

All up, a fabulous event- we will return!"
,,F1 in the Lion City,5.0,,Had a cracking time at the F1 last night. The venue is super friendly to the race patrons with great spots to view the race along with plenty of stalls for food drink and merchandise. Queen and Bastille were amazing. Would def recommend it.
,,Good evening out,4.0,,"We bought tickets online and picked up out tickets at booking office. From their 2 minute walk to entry. We had level 4 access which entitled is to wander around. You could see the cars at various spots on the track, more glimpses than anything. Many hawker stalls which we reasonably priced. Great views towards Mariners Bay."
,,First class event,5.0,,"Really excellent weekend and I am writing this review before the race itself ! The night street racing is fantastic to watch and the event is very well organised . For visitors to Singapore , the timings are great because you have most of the day to explore and see the sights . Within the circuit there is lots of entertainment provided with great live acts to finish the evening . Food and drink are plentiful but inevitably pretty expensive and if you want to rest your legs you can sit on the Padang and admire the views . Will definitely be back !"
,,Good night out,5.0,,"Qualifying rounds, and then Queen. Plenty of f&b stands, queues not too bad, event organised efficiently and safely."
,,F1 Singapore,5.0,,"Super experience to see the f1 cars trough a street circuit, seen many races but this is different and then when the night falls the brightness of the cars is so great to see !
Sounds trough the streets is making you feel youre alive !

It is a must see when youre an F1 fan and have the upportunity to go !

They are pretty strict on rules but thats the only thing, we hade a flag with us wich we were not able to use.

The rest it is clean nice and everything is arranged really good !

Have fun F1 fans !!"
,,The best grand prix,5.0,,I have been to Monza and Montreal but they do not compare to Singapore. Amazing event and venue. Easy to navigate
,,This has to be the best GP of the year,5.0,,"The night race in Singapore has its own unique atmosphere and is a truly great site. On the Sunday, they start racing at 8pm and finish at about 10pm so not too late. There is so much else going on though, very good artists on many stages throughout the circuit, be prepared to do loads of walking"
,,Once a year build up,4.0,,"After so many years of racing, one would expect a downturn in enthusiasm. However, when you walk along the track even before the race, you can feel the atmosphere building. Must come to walk track side at least once to understand why the buzz is around."
,,MONEY MONEY MONEY,3.0,,"Yes this is a negative review.

I've been to the F1 a few times. This is due to the friendly generosity from friends who benefitted from complimentary tickets, albeit sitting at a grandstand area.
I've had experience watching and experience the race and its surrounds from the Pit Grandstand, Turn 2 Grandstand, Padang Grandstand and walkabout.

To be very honest, it was hard to see who's driving in which car. You will still rely on the many big (mega big) tv screens to tell you what's going on track.
The race is far better to watch on your tv screen at home. At least the camera follow the track action from the leading pack through to the chasing and the pack at the end. Crashes are also shown (although see a crash LIVE on-location is far more exciting). But why are we hoping these drivers, driving at mad speeds, crash into one another? So that we can see damage? Or worse, so we can see crushed drivers corpse? Let's not be so morbid.

Anyway that's for the race.

What surrounds the race may be what others are looking for.
Stages for entertainment are set-up everywhere with the better acts at Zone1 while the mass throng to Padang for the post-race mega concert.

Let me tell you this, Zone1 is one place you'll be spending a lot of money to enter (IF you're buying, instead of benefitting from a friend's generosity). But the bands/performers... well know that it is not their solo concert and they are only there for a showpiece. So if you're a fan, track these stars to their own show instead of forking our crazy money for a 45min/1hr set. It really doesn't do justice to all your years of support. But hey, at least these stars get paid from F1 organisers. Or perhaps they've haven't been booked elsewhere so this is their only chance for an income.

Whatever the reason is, entertainment is so-so and not worth buying tickets for (unless you get them cheap/er from Carousell or eBay or some third-party seller). Lots of second hand dealers outside the gates. Some watch the race then attempt (sometimes successfully) to sell it to concert hunters who can't pay full price.
I say, that's economy. And that's also showing the F1 organisers a big bad finger for making F1 prices so damn expensive.

Oh yes, if you're from a foreign country, good luck. You'lll be paying TOP dollar for your stay in one of our hotels. Even backpack hostels have upped their prices cos we know you're coming, and you'll need at least 2 nights stay in our beautiful (money hungry) country.
So we'll bleed you.

Fancy saving your money on hotel? Sure. Here's an alternative. Buy a ticket to one of the after-race dance party. (if there are tickets still available). Perhaps cheaper than hotel. Plus you can sleep in the nightclub/disco and pretend that you're drunk. Then check into the circuit when day light comes.
Otherwise, good luck with your accomodation with some hotels even sold-out.

F&B inside the circuit is crazy. Food prices are jacked up so high. You're paying double for meals and drinks. Here's the standard. My local coffeeshop sells kopi at $1.20. Now you go compare the prices inside. Good luck.

So really, the ones who can really really really afford it are the ones in the Paddock Club. I would like to assume that they have all it takes to be there with millions of excess. (otherwise good luck to their justification for being in a zone that costs 3 months pay cheque for others).
These people get zipped around in buggies, have escorts to bring them to seats and even freeflow drinks and food (while we the paupers have to pay for our feed outside... heck they don't even leave scraps for us!)

Anyway I'm sour. I'm sour because the sheer sight of inequality... will be seen at the race. The have and the have-not.. and those trying to have (but actually have nothing).

Sad world we live in. Will share with you photos from my previous experience at F1."
,,F1 paddock club is unforgettable,5.0,,Once in your life you have got to experience the F1 paddock club. Access to the restaurants with top notch food and entertainment. There was a track walk and loads of champagne. Amazing views of the track and the F1 cars zooming by
,,The Best GP Ever,5.0,,"The GP is awesome, the atmosphere the music the entertainment, there is always something happening and as with everything in Singapore it is run brilliantly, from people directing you to where you need to be to easy access food stations. My only issue would be water, you need to drink a lot of it and it can get expensive. The music on Stages 4 are incredible with an awesome line up. Trip Advisor would let me choose September 2015, which is when we went, but we are going again in 2016 and I know Singapore won't disappoint. Remember to bring ear protectors for little ones or big ones but you can buy buds on the course and outside for around $1"
,,Fun. Great for music and party,5.0,,Been twice and SG GP always have great music acts and the atmosphere for party is amazing. Not to miss whilst in Asia.
,,One of the best GPs I have been to,5.0,,"Spectacular street race in a beautiful city. I have been twice to this GP and never been disappointed. The start and finish straight is not the best area to watch, rather find a good corner. The firework display at the end is brilliant and the music and entertainment that goes on around the track, before, during and after the GP is unbeatable. A really wonderful race to experience for all F1 fans"
,,Amaaaaaaazing Grand Prix,5.0,,"Everything is great. The city, the nightrace, the atmosphere. Nothing can beat a live sports event. Closer to any action is basically not possible."
,,Good Racing,5.0,,One of the most spectacular races of the F1 calendar and until the 2016 season was the only night race.
,,Vrrrroooom,5.0,,"True sports fans will know the feeling you get by being there live.
Some swear that they will get a better view by watching it on tv, live. But in all honesty, the tv doesn't allow you to smell burning rubber.
Singapore is proud to be the night street circuit host and I can see why. It's a great country, safe and clean, and very very efficient in erecting all the safety cages in preparation for the race. Price wise, it's affordable. Only a few thousands for 3-days of mad race fun.
Hotels may set you back a bit if you're a travelling tourist. But for the true love of sports, money must not matter. Start saving for next year's race, NOW!"
,,How Exciting is Something Boring to You?,3.0,,"I don't like watching car racing but it's less painful on tv because you can see so much more of what is going on. I think you need to like car racing to enjoy this. Otherwise, I'd say there's no reason to go unless you're really curious about the experience. It seems like a lot of foreigners travel here to see this. But once you're there, the cars zip past you as you spend 2-3 seconds appreciating the sight of them. After about 15 minutes, I was bored out of my mind. I don't drink alcohol so that doesn't help me either. The setup of the race is decent. It's neat to see the race in the city. The views as a spectator aren't that great in my opinion. If I had someone visiting me, I would not take them there unless they were really into this sort of thing. I also wouldn't recommend locals go here either. The only thing I hope is that I'll get an aerial view of the race someday.

My Summary:
If you're an enthusiast of this stuff, then go.
If your spouse or friend is trying to drag you to it, I don't recommend going.
Maybe the concerts are something you'd enjoy.
I'll never get tickets again."
,,Disappointing Experience,2.0,,This viewing for the spectator is very limited. From most viewing points the length of visible track is very short. The result is you watch a lot of the race on the big screens. Atmosphere was extremely smokey due to forest clearing fires in Indonesia. My wife has mobility issues and unfortunately there are a lot of steps and stairs to cope with to get around. Escalators at the central access area were turned of for Health and Safety reasons! Taxis reverted to fixed price regardless of distance and far more expensive than normal. We did not enjoy the Singapore GP. There are many very good alternatives and the Abu Dhabi GP is the gold standard for organisation and facilities.
,,Great atmosphere - really enjoyed!,5.0,,Even the walk around tickets were worth while! Grab a beer and some crab & soak up the atmosphere. A must see
,,Modern Day Classic Experience,5.0,,One of the wonders on the F1 circuit and I have been to many. Love the rainforest climate making a challenge for both visitor and driver. Stay for at least a week Singapore is amazing.
,,Fi weekend,5.0,,"I've seen many F1 races but Singapore is the best. Been 3 times and if I can would go every year. Even without the race, great place to visit."
,,Fun night out even for non-F1 fans,4.0,,"The Singapore F1 race is chockfull of events. Even if you are not into F1 or any sort of race, the events include an array of concerts by rock and popstars-du-jour. Among those that have performed are Maroon 5 and Bon Jovi etc. The race itself is so-so since there are few overtaking opportunities. There is always a safety car because of the inevitable accident or two. However, the offtrack events add a fun and festive atmosphere. If you're not into racing, consider getting a walkabout ticket to watch the concerts."
,,Over rated,1.0,,"Incredibly expensive nearly SGD $600 dollars, for an entrance ticket , and that is without a seat! The best corner (turn 7) and fastest place on the circuit does even have audience access to view. I wanted to take my son to see an F1 race but at $1200 for the both of us, to bunch up with other non-seaters and crane our necks to see the cars whiz by, simply isn't worth the outlay. The grandstand layout is also poor, in that the stands all view the straights, where nothing happens in an F1 race (you need to see corners) . The track itself is tight and bumpy with little passing opportunities and the current rules and cars make for very boring racing. Last years 1,2,3 start 1,2,3 on the grid By comparison a ticket at Daytona for my son is $20."
,,Best F1 Fixtrue of the year,5.0,,"Everything you need is on the circuit, once you enter the concerts etc are all there. Excellent entertainment program and on circuit facilities. The shuttles bus was directly in front of our hotel couldn't have worked out any better."
,,A very unique and fun experience,5.0,,"The setting for the Singapore GP is absolutely breathtaking. Seeing the whole of the central business district completely shut down and with all of the lighting installed is impressive. As you walk around and see the cars flying through, you just get this amazing feeling of adrenaline... it really is a wonderful experience. Coupled with some very nice acts (most years), it makes the somewhat high price of the tickets worth it. I have been twice, and not sure i will go every year, but if the shows are good, its worth it."
,,"Night race, stunning cityscape",4.0,,"Screeching engines roar, stunning backdrops from Museums, Cityhall, Padang and MBS. As the cars race across 200kmh, the crowd cheer.

We prefer walkabout tickets with my child, exploring the various corners. Stand near to the fence to feel the rush and adrenaline. In my opinion, Grandstand (static) seats are less exciting.

The crowd, the party atmosphere, the night lights.
F1 Singapore is simply magical."
,,What a Weekend,5.0,,"This was one of the main reasons i went to Singapore, this is a great weekend cars noise lots of action.
be prepared for a lot of walking and a lot of people
the food and drink i stupidly over priced but what do you expect at an event like this.
it is a great experience and if you can get there to go then you must"
,,THE TRACK IS 4X BRIGHTER THAN A STADIUM !!!,5.0,,"Choose the right ticket for you. The (massive) Marina Bay Circuit is divided into four zones, and there are trackside grandstands and bleachers in all of them (this map will make it a bit clearer). Racing takes place over three days (day 1 is practice, day 2 is practice and qualifiers, and day 3 is the race) and you can buy 3 different types of tickets:

Grandstand tickets (there are 6 different grandstands ranging from SG 298 for the Bay Grandstand to SGC1,288 for the premium Pit Grandstand);
Walkabout tickets (premier for accessing all 4 zones SGD498; or just Zone 4 Padang access SGD228; and
Combo ticket packages that give you a different combination of grandstands and walkabout zone access on each of the three days of racing (range from SGD598 to SGD988)."
,,best night race experience,5.0,,"loved the f1 experience at grand stand, street racing in september , it was clean and high security at all times. food was available at all grandstands."
,,Ok,3.0,,Best view of it I gunk is from the Singapore a Flyer wheel. Can imagine the smell of oil and raving.
,,Just next to flyer,3.0,,"I went there 2 weekends early morning because of two runs held there. As the building is mainly built for F1 race, the building seems unoccuppied most of the time, except during those weekends run or F1 races."
,,Too congested and expensive,2.0,,Tickets were too expensive and all we can see is only a small portion of the cars passing by. The only common thing everyone can hear is the screeching of the tyres..
,,CAR RACE,4.0,,This is a fun place a must F1 fans.Even if you are not come here in the evenings.A must see in here.Good for family and friends including kids.
,,the rubber meets the road here,4.0,,"Perhaps after the Monaco circuit this is the only other street circuit for F1 Grand Prix racing. The roads you drive on are the ones that host the iconic Singapore grand prix.As yu drive past the pit lanes and roads that have seen the likes of Schumacher and senna, you wonder what will be the experience of high voltage drama and charged nature of the raceday. comparing against the soft and fairly noiseless traffic on a normal day. A racing enthusiast must see. come september, the roads will transform. Be there."
,,GREAT ATMOSPHERE,5.0,,"Fantastic must go if you are in Singapore for this, the atmosphere is amazing great night highly recommend. We bought the walkabout tickets but we managed to see the cars racing, the concerts are always great too, wear comfy shoes :)"
,,One of the best F1 races in the season!,5.0,,Definitely the Singapore F1 night race is my favorite of all the F1 races. Lots of activities and concerts going on when the race is in full swing!
,,Good for F1 fans,5.0,,I am a formula 1 fan so to be able to walk through pit lane and the start and finish line is a lot of fun. It is close to the Singapore Flyer.
,,Jewel of F1,5.0,,"This is where all the action of the singapore grand prix is. During race weekend, this place transforms from a regular pit building, to a festivities filled carnival. Not to be missed if you are here for the race in September."
,,Grand Prix must,5.0,,Anyone intending visiting the Singapore Grand Prix any September will be most interested to visit the Grand Prix track and pit area to get a close feel for what it is like.
,,Highlight of the F1 calender,5.0,,"The F1 night race in Singapore is something everyone should try and see once in their lives.
To see this race spectacle with the Singapore skyline at night as a backdrop makes this the F1 race to beat all others.
Even if you are not an F1 fan the entertainment that comes as part of the race entry fee makes it worth going along.
The top music performers and bands regularly show up for this and all performances are in open air after the race.
Food & drink aplenty and a real party atmosphere at every race."
,,Very enjoyable,4.0,,"Singapore F1 is not the best track for racing because the overtaking is limited. However i love the atmosphere at F1 Singapore. The bands are always good, its safe and well organised."
,,Highlight,4.0,,"There is always a special buz at F1 Pit, there are world famous artist, smell of fame and money, noisy and a wonderful event"
,,Grand Prix trip,5.0,,"Went to Singapore Grand Prix in September. Purchased Bay Grandstand tickets accessed via gate 3. Probably not the best seats although view of the bay fantastic. Might do Stamford grand stand next year or splash out for zone 1 and 2.
If you're going be prepared for the heat - it's hot and humid and unless you're in hospitality, dress for the heat!
I waited until Sunday to buy tee shirts for the kids but many of the popular ones had sold out in sizes we needed - buy early to avoid disappointment.
Plenty of food and drink outlets - fairly basic but all ok.
I stayed at Carlton Hotel which was about a 10 min walk maximum to gate 3."
,,good for F1 fans,5.0,,we went here as our daughter is a F! fan but have to say I did enjoy it bars are expensive close by we paid £25 for 2 beers
,,Great Spectacle even if the racing this year is not that great,5.0,,"The epectacle of the night race is great and the constant events and music within the track all weekend are fantastic. Concerts after each days racing were greatt and worth the admission price alone. Food and drink within the track are very expensive and you are not allowed to bring in any from outside. I think we saw better racing in the support races than the main event, but that was expected with Mercedes dominance this year."
,,Great weekend,5.0,,This was a fantastic weekend. The car racing was amazing to see and the music to end the night was fantastic. More food and drink areas would be helpful as queues took a long time
,,Spectacular event but petty officials.,4.0,,"This was the 4th time we have been to the Singapore GP, as always it was well organised and spectacular. The cars look great under the lights, although the pollution haze took the edge off the colours and the view down the start straight this year. We had seats in the pit lane grandstand to see plenty of grid and pit stop action, get high up seats if you want to be able to see over the safety wall into the garages.

Every year we have gone the officials and police, although very well mannered, have been getting more and more authoritarian. Why do you have to walk down the side of a disused road 100 yards to the crossing point then all the way back? Does a flag pinned to the back of the stand fence, not obscuring any view, really require a talking to by the police and its removal? Not letting you in to the track at all until 1500, when the first cars are on track at 1500? Even after the race we were told to stand back 6 feet from the pit fence at the podium presentation, I can understand keeping back from the fence when the cars are racing but is that really necessary when the race is over and we were standing on the race track? Possibly if the police and officials put less effort into annoying race fans and more into track security the race may not be disrupted by people walking onto it. I hate to think what it will be like next year after this years safety car event.

On Thursday evening there is a ""Pitlane Experience"" with a chance to visit the pits and see the cars and teams. After paying a sizeable amount for your tickets you would think this would be open to any 3 day ticket holders, not in Singapore. It's only open to Singapore identity card holders! Can you imagine the uproar if that was tried in Europe?"
,,"F1, night race, view of the bay area",5.0,,"Thumbs up: Festive atmosphere, excited multi cultural crowd, and walk along the track; Thumbs down: Don't forget to walk on the track after the race or even if you have the seat, go walk around in the free standing area"
,,Always walk the track.,5.0,,Walk the track at night time and explore the empty pit buildings and get a beer from 7-11 below big wheel and sit on edge of track thinking about what takes place.
,,A fantastic city to go to for a F1 race,5.0,,"This was my second year going to Singapore, main reason being the F1 race. It's so fantastic, a large city and in its centre a F1 race! During daytime you can experience everything Singapore has to offer, in the evening you go to the race, (yes it's that easy accessible, by foot or by the Metro), and after the race you have the Singapore nightlife to experience."
,,Nice structure,5.0,,"The circuit is on the streets, they close it a few days before and the F1 is during the night. Such a nice experience"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"That was my best race even. The location, the shows, the people, the organisation. I'll be back!! For sure!!"
,,Don't bother: one can only see about 200 metres of track otherwise one watches it on Giant Screens.,1.0,,"This is not a place for the walking disabled and in fact any disabled. I walked about 10K on first day but slightly less on other two days. If one goes via Gate 3 one has to negotiate a metro (MRT) station in which no escalators or lifts are working. Long steep stair cases. Disabled toilets are far and few between. Best access is by taxi and the shortest routes are via hotels. When one is going home one has to pay a premium for a taxi at 55 Sing dollars ( £22.50) Staff have no idea about walking disabled access and one has to join long queues. There are no handrails on stairs in Grandstand. I actually fell down a flight of stairs here. There is no car parking. I was reduced to tears yet I have done numerous ""adventure"" holidays including dug out canoes in S. America."
,,Fantastic week,5.0,,"This is the F1 night race, spectacular and so enjoyable. In an ideal setting on river/bay with views to all the iconic Singapore skyline.
Super organised, relaxed and excellently executed, this is the race to be at.
Great facilities, brilliant viewing and facilities, bars and food spot on, including a flyer trip while racing was on. Great during daylight but fantastic once lit up.
An unforgettable experience, just loved my time here, helped by some up close fantastic racing and seats right on start line.
Music and concerts on the many stages were a highlight too -Pharrell, Spandau Ballet, Maroon 5 and Bon Jovi rocked us into the nights. Easy access to and from, great!
Wow."
,,Great weekend.,5.0,,"Great fun and very well organized, an event the whole family can enjoy. Probably one of the better grand prix to attend. Location and entertainment options are very good."
,,Race at night,5.0,,"Dont forget your ear plugs, yes i forgot mine and its a memorable day. The brrom brrom sound will rock in your head for 2 days atleast. But amazing to see the night race in the city. I went on friday after work and its very convenient to get there to commute back from there, not very crowded very well organized and easy to find your seats. The helpers really will give you advise and help you find your way."
,,Simply the Best,5.0,,This was my 5th Singapore GP but the 2015 one will be my all time favorite. I was able to shot some dream pictures and meet the Race winner. Absolutely unforgettable. Thank to Mr. Vettel that he been so patient with me.
,,"Great venue, well organised",5.0,,"We were based at Turn 2 at the end of the start straight and this proved to be a good place to watch from.

Gate 1 is close to the grandstands with a stage in between for the groups.

Excellent views, very efficiently organised. A bit hot and humid so take plenty of water.

Highly recommended."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"What more can you say! This has to be one of the most stunning race circuits in the world. The fact that it is a night race shows off the spectacular skyline .... absolutely incredible location! The fireworks going off along the finishing straight, followed by the full display are a fitting finale. Only down side was that we decided not to stay for the concerts. The intense heat and huge crowds all heading to the Pedang Stage were just too much so we opted for a leisurely walk to Clarke Quay for cocktails instead!"
,,Singapore Grand Prix A+,5.0,,Just the greatest experience ever. F1 at night is an amazing experience and is recommended to everyone
,,The original night race and still one of the best in the season,5.0,,Fantastic Grand Prix circuit & event. Atmosphere can't be beat. Compared to Abu Dhabi the concerts are very crowded and the fences can obscure the track for photography. Plenty to do though and though the pole sitter normally wins there is always a safety car or 2 here.
,,Great as usual!,5.0,,"The attraction is quite unique compared to other Grand Prix races around the world because Singapore has night racing. Variety of things to appreciate while you're at the races- from fine dining and wines to palmists and photo booths, and at the end of course the concert."
,,Zoom zoom,5.0,,Took seats next to the start grid. Noise was phenomenal as cars started. The race was brilliant Saturday qualifiers and Sunday final. Truly phenomenal even and totally well organised. So many people. All very polite with no rowdiness at all. Bon Jovi great but unable to get too close due to crowds. Food mediocre and plenty of drinks available. Never the less it was still utterly brilliant.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"What's not to love? It's Formula 1 in Singapore, at night. Easy to get to, wonderful atmosphere and great racing (certain retirements notwithstanding). The staff, in what appears to be the spirit of Singapore are amazingly friendly and helpful. Definitely worth a trip if you're a Formula 1 fan."
,,Wow F1 in night,4.0,,"With a backdrop of its spectacular cityscape, Singapore hosted the first night race on the Formula One calendar. The atmosphere around the flood-lit circuit is infectious. Utilising public roads around the Marina Bay area, the track includes fast straights as well as plenty of overtaking opportunities"
,,I liked the things I could see,5.0,,I was there just one week after the GP of Singapore. I couldn't get into the pit lane or building but I could still be on the F1 track. I made some cool pictures to remember the moments!
,,good night race,5.0,,The F1 experience was great. The whole city was buzzing. The bars were all full and there was alot of activity going on in and around the circuit area. We were seated in the stand to the right of the MBS so didn't have far to walk. The noise was rebounding all around the buildings but the experience was well worth the trip if you are an F1 fan. Just a pity Hamilton didn't finish.
,,F1 in the night,5.0,,"F1 in the night Amazing. Venue is top of the range. Public transport, MRT, the best to get there with plenty of trains for mass transportation of spectators fast, clean and aircondittioning to cool you."
,,Fun filled race,4.0,,Race in the city... be prepared for the heat and humidity on day time. Maybe they can put in more activity surrounding the race. easy access using public transport
,,Grand Prix Wonder,5.0,,Attending the Singapore Grand Prix was always a dream of mine. It did not disappoint. Tickets across from pit row and a hotel on the track with a balcony was nothing short of amazing. I'm ready to go back again!
,,F1 Night Race,5.0,,"I booked this on a whim, completely don't regret it what-so-ever.

I bought a combination pass; Friday on the Padang Straight, Saturday in the Bay Grandstand and Sunday in the Pit Grandstand.

It was a fantastic experience and I met some excellent people there.

Added bonus of the evenings music of Pharrell, Maroon 5 and Bon Jovi.

Would love to come back."
,,Perfect in every way!,5.0,,"If you're an F1 fan, the Singapore GP is a must. I've been to many other Grand Prix including certain gems such as Monaco. Singapore however, blows them all out of the water.

The event is organised with exceptional levels of attention to detail, which is further complemented by the natural backdrop of the cosmopolitan city and all it has to offer.

We had the 3-day grandstand combination tickets for Padang on Friday, Bay on Saturday (best backdrop in F1) and Pits Straight on Sunday. Would highly recommend these as it allows you to absorb the event and its many different areas across 3 days."
,,Great Night.,5.0,,"Had a brilliant night at the race, my first in Singapore ... My wife and I had a great time though and would definately like to go again."
,,Formula 1 Night Racing WOW,5.0,,"This was our first F1 race and the singapore round was one we always wanted to do, well done Singapore on putting on an amazing world class event. Everything is so well organised inside the circuit and throughout the city.

We came from Australia and got a 3 day pit combination which Friday was Padang Grandstand, Saturday Bay Grandstand and Sunday Raceday Pit Grandstand. We were very surprised when we got to the pit grandstand to be in line with 1st and 2nd on the grid.

We will be back for sure it's an amazing event"
,,street racing,4.0,,"the only place after monaco to have this facility, very accessible by public transport! how many other cities have roads which can have f1 race cars drive on them. a nice thing to do and have some fun"
,,An experience we will never forget,5.0,,"The Singapore F1 was an amazing experience which we really enjoyed. We went to the practice, qualifying and the race and enjoyed each one. We also stayed for Pharell Williams as he was one of the acts performing and he was brilliant. We would love to come back to the F1 again in Singapore. Accessing the track was easy using the SMRT and there was plenty of food outlets both near and within the track area."
,,3 Days Of Joy,5.0,,"My first foreign Grand Prix, and Singapore did not disappoint. We had a 3 day pass, Zone 4 and Zone 1 was excellent, the only thing that was not perfect was my fav driver Lewis retired (LOL), the whole organisation was well done."
,,wow....just wow,5.0,,"Ok so done the majority of the big races, Spa, Monza, Silverstone etc....nothing comes close to this. Senses are just blown away, sights sounds smells the heat. Everything about the experience was just incredible. Especially the organisation stewards and the after events - it is just something you have to experience. Race commentary on the big screens needs to sorted out tho! Stick sky on it next year!!!! Then I will be perfect!"
,,Just Go,5.0,,"We attended the F1 Grand Prix- so not actually a tour of the building. Singapore provided so many never to be forgotten moments. But my very favourite was, after the track invasion, we walked along the track, heading for the concert. The staff were in the Grandstands, clapping and cheering the spectators. Well Done Singapore F1"
,,Great fun at the night Grand Prix,5.0,,"This was my first Grand Prix and I wasn't disappointed - well organised, lots of fun, noise and colour - a great treat for any F1 fan"
,,Stunning event,5.0,,"If you are into F1 this is the place to be.

The whole city comes to life during the race weekend and with more things to do than you can imagine, it won't be long before you come back.
The night skyline and light show have to be seen to be appreciated, and river cruises just top it off.
The race and the city are a must for families and couples alike."
,,Thought I would hate it,5.0,,"I loved this - Pit Lane experience. I am not an F1 fan at all but this was so interesting and pretty special. I thought it was something that most people would enjoy - watching them practice their tyre changes , seeing the cars close up and walking on the track - all great!"
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"What an event! Singapore knows how to throw a party. It was hot and humid but I enjoyed the race, the food the drink and the party after. Congratulations to Singapore on putting on a hell of a show!"
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,First time watching a live Formula 1 race and now I'm hooked. Stayed right off the circuit which provided easy access to seats and walkabout area as well as a view of the track.
,,Don't miss it!,5.0,,"Fantastic facilities, wow what an event and would love to come again. Great entertainment and lively crowds. This place is lit up like daylight and no shortage of very friendly staff to answer your questions."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,We have visited a number of Gps around the world and bar Abu Dhabi this was one of the best. It was really well organised. Transport was not an issue and very cheap by tube. Loads of food and drink choices. Stunning view of the track. We were in Stamford which I wouldn't recommend as the view is limited but Searts were very close to the track and the cars looked stunning. the maroon five and Bon jovi concerts were brilliant. Would highly recommend a its to this GP
,,F1 lovers,5.0,,singapore is the only country where the race takes place on a race track as well as on the local roads there roads are well maintained. it happens in the month of September. one can watch from normal streets as well as from the race strack sittings
,,Awesome F1 Experience,5.0,,"The best F1 experience ! My first Grand Prix and what an amazing experience. Well defined layout and access with loads of activities running in parallel. I was seated in Bay Grandstand and if you are lucky enough to get seats in the first 10 rows, AWESOME ... just before turn 18. The cars arrive at 200 km/h and brake in front of you to enter the tunnel under the stands."
,,A race track thats a must for any f1 fan,5.0,,This little place called Singapore should give itself a good pat on the back so well run it would be hard to beat food verry good at track beer verry expensive congratulations on your 50 annlversary and good luck
,,Best race on the F1 Calendar with numerous background shows.,5.0,,"By far the best F1 race venue on the FI calendar nothing compares to Singapore, lots of roving acts around the circuit throughout the day and some top named acts for evening concerts. Food and drink stalls and hospitality areas. Go for the Turn 3 Grandstand package which provides you with food and drink throughout the day and access to most areas (not paddock or pit lane), plus you meet a great crowd of fellow F1 fans from around the globe. The SQ race staff and volunteers are always smiling and extremely helpful. A definite again for next year."
,,Must do for F1 fan,4.0,,"What can I say, you can't beat the atmosphere of a night race! The lights just make the spectacle so much better. We travelled from Aus and found the whole experience amazing. Well organised and very easy to get to, Taxis were quick and not a very long wait at all. Entertainment was good although we were in the most expensive section zone 1 and the good bands played in zone 4 which was a massive walk to get there. Food was good quality and reasonably priced. MY ONLY NEGATIVE WAS THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO FREE WATER, THIS IS A JOKE! WE PAID $1300 A TICKET AND THEN EXPECTED TO BUY WATER AT HIGH PRICES. A very hot and humid race and water should have definitely been free, other than that a 5 star event for a Motorsport fan."
,,Superb event!,5.0,,"Don't come to Singapore City over the 3 days when the GP is on if you don't like racing! The roads are closed & it must be chaos for residents/workers, but it is a fantastic event & brings a huge amount of tourism & money into the island.
We loved it! The circuit volunteers are excellent, the staff work do very hard to keep it clean all weekend, the entertainment is excellent - oh & the racing is pretty good too!
One of the best GP's on the F1 calendar.
Amazing!"
,,Fantastic F1race,5.0,,Wooh. Singapore can do it all .there was a big party celebration with the F1 drivers doing ramp walk with singapore celebrates .and than the race began . The sound and the vibrations could be felt .there was a great variety of food for food lovers .in all it was a great experience for race lovers .the fireworks were spendid . A night to remember .
,,Fantastic experience can't wait to do it again,5.0,,"Our first night race with the F1 and it was one heck of an experience. We had a 3 day package and had an absolute blast the event was very well organised ground staff were helpful and the evening entertainment after practise, qualifying and the race were just fantastic. I fully recommend coming here. I thought getting back home via the MRT would be bedlam but even the trains were super efficient."
,,Best Grand Prix race experience ever,5.0,,"The Singapore Grand Prix is simply stunning, and for any F1 fan contemplating a visit to Singapore for the race I would say ""go for it"". It isn't as expensive as you might think.
You can get very close to the circuit which really intensifies the sights smell and sounds of the F1 cars as they hurtle around the street circuit.
The staff are amazingly friendly, and even those with relatively tiresome/boring tasks remain enthusiastic and friendly throughout the event. Smiles were almost ubiquitous.
The city is spotless with no graffiti, and feels very safe.
Overall a once-in-a-lifetime experience I'm sure I will never forget.
I can't recommend it highly enough....."
,,Formula 1 Experience,5.0,,"Singapore Airlines Singapore Grand Prix is said to be the crown jewel of Formula 1 and it indeed is! Filled with many exciting thrills, the F1 street circuit is a one of a kind. It boasts the longest race that is held in the night and has never once not had the safety car go out on the actual race day! Singapore also organises nightly concerts from the likes of superstars such as Pharell William, Maroon 5, Katy Perry, Jennifer Lopez and many more yearly! There is just so much to do and see! While you are in Singapore, your F1 ticket does give you some privileges, do check it out. And with Singapore Airlines as the main sponsor, the race is spiced up with the World Class Airline's touch! A must see and do!"
,,Exceptional,5.0,,"I had never visited an F1 circuit, and my first experience was awesome at Singapore. This is a street circuit and the facilities they arranged during a short period of time was awesome. Kudos to the F1 arrangements group."
,,2015 race weekend excellent,5.0,,"On the down side I arrived at gate 2 at 2 pm because racing practice started at 3pm to be told gates didn't open until 3 pm so we were made to stand with no shelter no toilets facilities or anything they told me the scanners were programmed to start working at 3pm but I explained this is the 21st century and people programme the scanners and whilst we are outside we are not spending money ! .
This is my only gripe as everything else was first class the food wasn't overly priced or the drink .
Fully recommend. ....."
,,2015 F1 Singapore GP,3.0,,"Hear the sound of roaring engines from Formula One cars. Experience the only city night race. Singapore grand prix is being held annually at downtown district. Grab a seat, buckle up!"
,,Thrilling experience,5.0,,"This has been said to be one of the best street circuits in the world. I've always loved the F1 races but never had the chance to go. I got the chance to go and I absolutely loved it. Although, I wasn't prepared for the noise but the atmosphere was amazing and just being there and seeing all the action was simply brilliant."
,,"Throttle Fun it is,,!!",5.0,,"throttle is that what excites u ? zoooom,,, here u go u oughta be here , though we arent allowed to drive race the mean machines , you surely will have a feel of it,,"
,,A great weekend and very entertaining,4.0,,"The racing is not just confined to F1 but saloon cars and single seater other than the 'big boy F1' cars.

Singapore hosts it well and the event is a great fun long weekend.

It will be hot. You may get wet. You'll definitely enjoy the racing, the bands, the food and drink and the atmosphere."
,,The race and the city,4.0,,"Contemporary high rise casting light with the dusk. Then the sound of speed and the surrounds of crowds, lights, and beer were what I enjoyed there."
,,Loved walking around!,5.0,,"We came here on the off chance we could have a look around!
They had a small FREE event on!
We did and it was amazing!!!
We had our photo took and we even got to go karting.
We also got to see some lovely cars!
Good luck for the race weekend! #44"
,,Out of this world!,4.0,,An event of the century. Sorry if you missed it. 2015 event is coming soon. Preparing myself for another night of awesome and intriguing race. Buying a new SLR to capture the best shots!
,,Wasnt race time but still great to see,4.0,,"Although we didn't go for the race, we did go and have a look at the track and see the pits. Would be great to see all set up but still great seeing all those names above their paddock doors and the rubber marks from the race on the track."
,,Quite impresseive at is very public,5.0,,The track was quite impressive as I have never been on one before. The pits are easy to reach not kept away from the public. If you are a petrolhead you have to see it. And it's very easy to reach from the Marina as it is just across the bridge.
,,A great opportunity to gain an unhindered view of the starting grid,4.0,,Having recently visited Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi I was keen to see this on my visit to Singapore. They were in the process of preparing for the September event but was delighted when I was allowed to walk freely behind the scenes as the preparations were on-going. Good to stand next to Lewis Hamilton's garage for a photo and look down the track. Can't wait for the real event.
,,Great atmosphre,4.0,,"We had Bay grandstand seat where the cars go under you, lucky to be able to see the big TV screen because otherwise it’s only a short run for the cars before they disappear. Guess you have to pay the big bucks to actually see more of the race.

There’s lots of entertainment and food which can keep you busy. Worth going no matter what seats you have great day out for couples or families."
,,The High Light of the year,5.0,,"This glamorous annual event in Singapore offers the ultimate in the excitement , electric atmosphere of the crowd and the ultimate stars of the race car driving . The whole city celebrates the event in spirit . The deafning roar of the engines passing thru the predesignated routes is enough to bring the rush of being a participant here . The most sought after venue comes with a high price to seek a vantage point to watch ..be there along the route an experience to be here . If you can manage try it some time ."
,,Awesome seeing the F1 cars under the lights!,5.0,,"Been to the race every year since it started, and the entertainment just keeps getting better! Very happy to be in a country which hosts a grand prix!"
,,We were there but no cars,4.0,,"The two young guys I was with were f1 fans, and they wanted to see where it was run. We went to the starting line and they took photos. the workers were putting up the lights and other structures up."
,,lets go!!,5.0,,"awerosome, extreme, fantastic, spectacular place, and it has the atmosphere of race... really feel to driving f1 race"
,,Adrenaline rush not quite as amazing anymore,3.0,,"The F1 cars have since muffled their engines. Adrenaline not as amazing as the previous years. The food is great as always, very posh. however I would recommend it you watch at home, since the cars are fast you wont have the full view of the race. However if u are at the pit, theres quite abit of action there thus it still may be worth your time."
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"Unless there is special event like army exhibition, art exhibition or F1 event itself, there is nothing to do there."
,,Best F1 race ever,5.0,,I think this is the best night race I ever see until today combine with view of iconic building around Marina Bay.
,,Activity area,5.0,,"Every september they have races here , if you like F1 do go there JUST DONT MISS IT ! And go sit there for sometime if you want to see some car stunts :)"
,,Daytime postcard views of Marina Bay,4.0,,"http://www.singaporegp.sg Nice views of Marina Bay throughout the year for tourists, especially early in the mornings Walk left underneath The Helix bridge and towards the Singapore Flyer. There are boat rides from there to the Merlion Enjoy my reflections of water & Kampong Glam"
,,Go for the annual F1 Night Race!,3.0,,"This is where the main action for F1 happens.

The whole place is bustling during F1 season. If yo uare a ticket holder, you need to purchase the higher tiered/ priced tickets.

Outside of F1, this venue is used for Chingay, which happens in the earlier part of the calendar year, and the occasional private sale.

If you are walking/ running/ cycling, you can explore the parts around the building and imagine you are part of the F1 action!"
,,Great place if you are a f1 fan,5.0,,This is a great place to see the pits that are used for the f1 race in singapore. And also near it you can go fishing. It is an humongous track
,,ok for one time,4.0,,"visited this june, just a ok place nothing very special in it...people who are into f1 and racing may like to spend some time and click pics"
,,2014 Singapore F1 race,4.0,,"Place is huge with lots of activities going on everywhere, 2 main concert stage, various set up stores selling related brands merchandise, bring an umbrella though or prep a poncho because it's a long run to the carpark/pickup area without any shelter at all."
,,For F1 fan,4.0,,"This is an impressive place for people that are fond of F1. You get to walk on the circuit, see the pits and pass by the departure and the finish lines. It is nice to take pictures there...and when you watch the next Singapore F1, you get to say: I was there!"
,,If F1 is your thing then walk around,5.0,,"Just get this rite I went during Day out of season Wife loves F1 Son loves F1 we used hop on hop off bus stumbled over it then my son was suddenly for the fist time exited he loved it walking round the Pits no one around and freely look in the pits not worth it if your not F1 fan but I enjoyed it passed 20 min and left my lad exited think it was the only thing on the holiday he actually photographed LOL .
But as I said if your not F1 person give it a miss if you are then its a must ,"
,,walking on a f1 circuit is something unforgetable,5.0,,"when I visited singapore in may 2015 for 4 days ,the first thing I thought about it when I was there is to walk around the whole street circuit at least 2 times to enjoy every street and corners of the circuit .being F1 fan,it was just fantastic for me to walk there in the street which I just see every year the f1 cars speeds on them.this goes very well especially for the last corner near the flyer and the start finish line which is just dedicated for walking being part of water front walk area in marina bay area.highly recommended for every one visiting singapore"
,,Too far from the Padang,3.0,,"The F-1 Pit Building is ideal of you are privileged enough to be inside one of the hosted reception lounges overlooking the start and finish line of the F-! Race. But if you want to be in main area for food & entertainment in the Padang where most of the fun and action takes place, it's a long walk there and back."
,,GREAT PLACE TO WALK AROUND,4.0,,"Often one would catch consumer sales in the F1 pit building itself during off-race season and it is a nice straight stretch to walk about. The aircon is strong and powerful for a hot-summer day in Singapore! In the evening, it would be a nice place to jog around the pit and vicinity."
,,F1 fan,5.0,,"We got off the bus here (Singapore flyer) we were able to walk down the pit straight,stand on the start / finish lane and look at all the pit garages,for us this was great,there seemed no problem us doing this,no one stopped us"
,,F1 Fun,5.0,,"We love the Singapore F1. It's not just the race itself, but the amazing show that goes on all around it and Singapore just keeps getting better and better at hosting it... and I'm not even a huge F1 fan, but I'll go every year."
,,not interesting outside the race,2.0,,"If you are interested in the glamour aspect of Formula One, it may be interesting to see the race physically. Otherwise, it is much better to see the race on TV, because you can see the entire track.

Outside the race, the pit Building is not a priority when visiting Singapore."
,,SUPER EXCITEMENT,5.0,,One of the most thrilling & exiting sport to watch if you are Race & Car lover.Atmosphere is just awesome...
,,be ready to be 5000 usd poorer,4.0,,"its F1, its super cars, its super noisy, its super, eh, boring. unless you are an F1 fan, skip this place. i ain't an F1 fan but hell, might as well visit, for once... its different, its a night race. call me a pervert because i love to see crashes and i am pretty sure, crashes are not quite possible at this circuit."
,,For F1 Lovers only,5.0,,This place is worth visiting if you are an F1 lover. For all else it will probably prove to be a waste of time. I have never actually been to an F1 race but this was a good experience for me.
,,"Do it, if ur a die-hard fan!",4.0,,"Went there last yr.. Ear plugs were provided foc on-site, but the sound was deafening!
Any seat is a good seat.. N basically we sat at the stands for a wile, n then walked around the food n drink stalls..
Tho the beers n foods were pricy, ended up having a picnic on e grass n watched the race on e giant screen, instd of sitting at the stands! Hahha.. Was quite a starry nite out!"
,,A must for F1 fans,4.0,,"I would only recommend this to fans of F1, it's probably of little interest to anyone else. Walking along the pit straight and seeing the pit lane and the wall still adorned with the names of last years drivers and teams was pretty impressive for me, a long term fan of the sport who's never been to an actual race."
,,A Pleasant Surprise,5.0,,"Whilst we weren't here at the time of the race, being avid F1 followers, and stumbling accross this whilst on the Flyer, my partner and I walked the track from the Flyer, back towards the hotel, as far as we could. It was great...."
,,If you want to do an F1 race easy then Singapore is it.,5.0,,"It's not the cheapest race to go to (tickets usually around $1000 for the Zone 1 grandstands) but it is the best in terms of accessibility, organisation and atmosphere. Monaco might have it for bling but I defy you to sit under the stars watching F1 with a fabulous city lights backdrop and not be impressed. Access to the track from the city is the easiest of any circuit in the World and it's never really crowded. I've done three races here and it just gets better and better."
,,The only night track in F1,5.0,,If you got to watch the action during night then this is it! best in class lighting and an awesome track. I got to see this event twice..am lucky!
,,Visiting the F1 starting grid and the pit building - for free,4.0,,"The Singapore GP is one of the most amazing events during an F1 season. As a street circuit, the track has to be purpose built every time. But not quite from the scratch, since the pit building is there for good. As an F1 fan for life, I found it very interesting to take my morning walk checking out the pit building as well as walking the main straight and starting grid, that are closed for traffic but can be freely visited on foot. Recommended spot for race fans."
,,The coolest event in town,5.0,,"Don't miss live concerts, a free ride running or biking on the circuit before its closure for the first practice session, a view from the sky bars and enjoy the race. It's simply amazing."
,,Wow,4.0,,Loved it walking on the track leading up to the pits. Great experience. Worth a look if in the area. Just look for the giant wheel 8n 4he skyline you will get straight to it
,,Concrete and soulless,1.0,,"It's an artificial structure created for the one event of the year that if you are into that sort of thing, fine.

Otherwise it's a disgusting concrete eyesore with hideous archit... you know what I shan't even call it architecture because kids in school could draw something better.

If you are at the Singapore Flyer you could look down on the stain on the landscape that is this godawful building, take a photo and be glad you didn't waste your time wandering over there."
,,Fantastics night!!,5.0,,"I went to there for watching 3rd day(final) with my parents. We went to other areas for 1st day and 2nd day. In my experince, this area is best to enjoy F1 night race in Singapore. It was qute expencive. However, It is worth to go!I enjoyed the whole race. Especially, the moment of start of the final was awesome!! Although F1 engine was quiet compared to previous years, it was very excting and special atmosphore."
,,For all F1 fans.,4.0,,When visiting the flyer you can walk to the pits where all the driver names are still above the garage they used last year. You can also snap a photo of the finish line.
,,Great experience for the f1 event,5.0,,I had an excellent experience at the f1 pit building because I got to see the actual F1 drivers racing in the race in singapore
,,If you like F1 then you should have a look.,4.0,,"The pit lanes for the Singapore F1 track are just below the Singapore Flyer so you can easily just nip around the corner for a quick look.

The only thing to see is basically one corner of track and then the pit lane part. You can see all the names and different teams garages labelled up. You can also stand on the starting grid as well.

All in all we probably spent about 20-30 mins there maximum and most of that was taking various photos."
,,Worth a gander in you're a fan and are passing by,4.0,,"We went here this morning after a ride on the singapore flyer. Out of season so free just to stroll up and down the pit lane taking photos and standing on pole. Comes with a bit of purpose built track to mooch around (unlike the rest which is lost inside City roads.) bit grotty where the grandstand was, but worth a gander if you are a fan!"
,,Singapore Grand Prix - Excellent!,5.0,,"Was in Singapore this past September for the Singapore Grand Prix. This was an exhilarating experience over several days that it took place. We were staying at the nearby Marina Bay Sands and enjoyed the sound of the fast cars moving around the tracks during the practice laps and the actual night race itself. Enjoyed some spectacular views from the pool deck (Skypark) although a little limited but delightful nonetheless!

Moving around the track itself during the Grand Prix one needs to buy the correct pass but overall a fantastic and superb experience! Just something so thrilling about fast cars racing through the streets than just a pre-built circuit!

Anyone who gets the chance to see one of the Formula One Grand Prix that race through city streets such as Monaco, Macau or Singapore should go for it!"
,,My every year must go event,4.0,,"I became night car race lover when my officemate first intro this event to me for a photoshoot.

Every year without fail and in fact even during my pregnancy (it is not advisable) I will attend just to hear the vhoommm sounds of the cars.

Advisable to get the tickets during the early bird period and its fun.

Outside foods are not allowed and the foods and drinks sold inside the area (padang) is rather expensive.

Its nice racing atmosphere and there will be live concert at the stage at the padang too."
,,The most exciting F1 night race in the world,5.0,,"as mentioned by all the F1 racer, Singapore have the most tough street racing track and humility, i was here since the 1st F1 night race in 2008, ever since then, i'm always here to see my favourite driver"
,,Wonderful,4.0,,This is just at citi center and you do not have to make any efforts to book tickets. The road on which we are driving our cars in day turns to be a F1 pit in night. must watch.
,,Free or $5k,3.0,,"This is a purpose built building for F1. During the F1 season (September) the place is hyped with activity and during race weekend, its really a carnival. Exciting, beautiful and breath-taking. To get to one of the Pit building suites, you either have very important and rich friends or you have $5k to blow.

After the race, the place is usually free unless there are other small events. Notable would be Chingay which is Singapore own Mardi Grass. Its also usually used during the National Day Parade as a holding area. When its not used you can either walk through or better - cycle through and imagine you were Lewis Hamilton."
,,Worth a visit.,5.0,,"If you are a fan, this is worth going to. Its amazing to stand on pole position! A must for any fan!"
,,Only busy during F1 season,3.0,,"Its just a rectangular building, really nothing to see here. Its exciting during the F1 season though"
,,Enthralling,4.0,,The pit was hosting a lot of superbikes when I visited the place (Flyer). The flyer offered great views of the circuit.
,,FI race fever,5.0,,i think this race in singapore was the best one because i saw F1 race live for the first time and my favourite druver lewis hamilton won the race was amazing to watch him.
,,Money Making Machine F1,1.0,,Paid what we thought was acceptable as not mad F1 Fans but the tickets we purchase was not possible to see the cars on for a split second. the Robbie Williams concert was a total Wash out but he stayed on stage & gave an outstanding performance. souvenirs $75 sing for a red bull baseball cap would we go again no better to stay at home & watch it on TV but you will quickly see why Mr Ecclestone is a very rich man who's company does not give true value to customers
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"My partner is an avid F1 fan, and although I myself was not one I found visiting the pit building was well worth a visit. You still see all the signs from the previous years races and the grandstands are still up. Very pretty with the city lights"
,,Mixed review at the Singapore Night F1 Race,4.0,,"I was a guest and my husband was a volunteer at the F1 Grand Prix. Being a volunteer you get a pass for your guest to come along an enjoy the race, they allocated a grandstand for your guests. Hmmm the view was terrible, l couldnt see anything except the top of the cars, all l could see was the bay and people around me, l had to go up 5 flights of stairs to get to my seat which was hard and very uncomfortable.. The food was ridiculously priced. I could only enter at one gate and had to walk what seemed like for ever. The grandstand had no shade and the lack of on track activity made the day boring.
As a volunteer race marshal I felt that the event was run well and the marshals were looked after. Drinks and meals were provided for marshals and our corner had a shelter from the elements. All briefings were run well and uniforms and accreditation were easy to pick up. The after party was great and we even got a complimentary officials shirt and cap to keep. Unfortunately the lack of on track racing meant that the day dragged on somewhat. Add a few more categories to the schedule and this could be one of the best race events of the year. The track location is fantastic in the heart of the city and the circuit all lit up at night looks bright and spectacular."
,,Wow we.,4.0,,"Stayed in hotel opposite,it was fantastic ,noisy but you expect that.A great experience ,nothing to dislike."
,,Awesome,4.0,,It si really fabulous to see this race .. U l really love it and its very thrilling to see.. U wont find this in ur city as this kind of is not available in all countries
,,quite an experience,4.0,,"the lovely lit marina bay street circuit, is a sight to behold. One has to be there to experience it. Tickets are very expensive though, but worth an experience once in life if you are a F1 fan!"
,,First time F1 attendee - Singapore,5.0,,"Having never attended an F1 we were most fortunate to be able to go to the Singapore F1 this year. We purchased a three day dicker which offered superb value for money. The atmosphere was amazing, the entertainment was excellent and the race was a nail biter!

I would even say that the concession stands all around the event even offered value for money, everything seemed to be reasonably priced!"
,,Night race at Singapore road,5.0,,This is something one must see at Singapore . You can be a lucky one if you are there during this time. They do F1 in singapore normal road. We watched the Show from swissotel room .. it was a life time experience..
,,Best GP in the World!!!,5.0,,"I have been to a few F1 GPs, namely Monza, Melbourne, Sepang, Shanghai, etc. but to me the Singapore GP is simply the best. Nothing can describe the excitement you get while at the Singapore GP. Simply out of this world!!!"
,,Excellent F1 Night Race,5.0,,"This was my First F1 Race and it was an amazing experience. I got the tickets for the Sunday the Race Day and i was there for around 8 Hrs and i thoroughly enjoyed and the icing on the cake was the JLo performance. Though it was humid and there are lots of crowd, it was worth spending every penny and every second of it.

If you don't have a gallery ticket, try to find a place to watch the night race before it gets dark, as it will be difficult to get one afterwards. Get a Umbrella for hot sun. You will have lots of food and drink option inside so no need to worry on that."
,,Good value if you luck buy the tickets with someone after 11pm,5.0,,I really enjoyed watching singapore GP 2014 with my husband coz has just about this attraction but its a lucky day my husband get the tickets just brought only S$50 yeaayy its realy amazing and the tickets are too expensive if we buy through online or on the spot its must be sold out! This Race for the glamour it represent we had execellent seat arrengements for access and exit. I was more fun when ending acttraction they give us mini concert from J-Lo wooww i'M a big fan and we enjoyed for singing and dancing in the park until late night. For the year we will soon back to the sing and watching again singapore GP 2015... Yeaayy
,,Great Grand Prix,5.0,,"The organisers did a great job yearly and preparations are made weeks in advance so that the audience will not be disappointed.
High security measures are taken seriously.

The bursting sound of the Grand Prix is very piercing so you are advised to wear ear plugs inorder not to hurt your ears.

Must go event when you are in Singapore. Money well spent."
,,Great to have a race and a concert,5.0,,"This race is good for the glamour it represents: night race, international atmosphere, great artists, nice food. There are many attractions around the race going on at the same time so if not able or you feel the tickets are too expensive, there are plenty of places nearby to have fun and still hear and feel the ambiance"
,,amazing experience,5.0,,"I was at the Singtel Singapore night race in Sep 2013. One of the most amazing experiences of my life. the humidity and heat takes some getting used to, but it is a must for F1 fans."
,,Great Experience,5.0,,It was an experience I had planned for over a year. It was worth every minute of it. I saw the qualifying and the main race. We had excellent seats at turn 1 with a front view of the pit straight and starting grid. Excellent arrangements for access and exit. The live shows were added attractions but I was more focused on the race. The pit lane walk on the day before the practice sessions was an added bonus.
,,One and only F1 in city,5.0,,its the only F1 track which go through the city road... Awesome experience. Take a trip package the car will drive throughout that road... And you will feel different..
,,Great time.,5.0,,"Had a blast going to see the night race! It was a great experience. I have already been to the Montreal, Monaco, and Australian GP's so this was a nice addition. Thanks to The f1 races I've been able to see the world."
,,Real Street Racing,5.0,,They raced on a real street(s)! viewing race at night (minus the sun) is really enjoyable. And there are concerts after the race.
,,Over-priced,2.0,,"Over-priced, over-rated and only good if you have a corporate chalet and air conditioning.
The noise is enough to make you insane and unless you have a client to swoon or interested in fast cars and have money to burn it is an over the top nonsense."
,,"Not too great an imposition, except when the race is on.",3.0,,"This brief review attempts to address the question: For non-race fans, how much of a hassle is this event?

The brief answer is - generally low-interference if you don't want to move around on the surface in the race area, while the race is on. And, perhaps, for some hotels and f&b places which might put up prices.

I was in Singapore for most of September, the month of the last race. I generally stay in the ""heartlands"" away from downtown. But we had reasons to make several trips into the downtown area by car, bus, and MRT during the times of setup and taketown of race infrastructure.

Generally, setup did not interfere significantly with traffic flow during ordinary hours, despite the blockage of several details in roadways. At least, we did not encounter any significant disturbance.

Non race fans have complained about hotel prices at F1 times. Not staying in a hotel, I can't comment on that. I certainly saw pushing of ""promotional"" f&b ""events"" which I kept in mind and avoided. Traffic, as noted above, was not an issue IMHO, unless you want to move about town during race times. The solution? Stay off the roads in the area during those times, unless you have a ticket and are attending. Use the MRT, and enjoy things that are located elsewhere in Singapore. Or leave town for a few days.

Local media coverage of side issues related to this year's race was quite interesting. This is a break, as local media coverage of most issues is pretty sterile."
,,nice,4.0,,"I really enjoyed my holiday so much , I love all the things in this Hotel , good staff and good food , the breakfast was amazing, I will definitely come back for our Holiday next time"
,,F-1 Night Race,5.0,,Great event with lots of additional entertainment during the days of the races. Probably the best way to see the F-1 race anywhere.
,,First ever visit to a Grand Prix,4.0,,"Again a childhood dream come true, love motor racing and never been to anything quite like this. We had general walk around tickets so it was a bit of a squeeze at times to see, next time would pay more and be in a seat. The city backdrop with the street lighting on is stunning, the noise of the cars and speed they travel is beyond words. Very well organised and catered event with loads to do more than just watch the race..."
,,Lifetime dream come true,5.0,,All I can say well done Singapore it was brilliant showcase. The race was great and all arrangements from ticket collection was well oiled
,,Excellent Location for Grand Prix,5.0,,"Well organised evening races were well lit and after race entertainment was very good. Only complaint would be access to the toilets and exits were restricted after 9.30 at night not good at all,"
,,The Best,5.0,,"This is besides Monaco the best GP of the year. I come every year since the first race and will never miss it. The city, the people, the perfect organisation. The entertainment with Robby Williams, J Lo etc is the icing on the cake. There was just one glitch: When the rain started they where not prepared to led the people out of the restricted area which nearly made people panic and the young ushers seemed helpless."
,,Great Experience!,5.0,,Im not a F1 fan but I felt like going to the Grand Prix just to get involved and see how the F1 race cars are. The fact that the race is in the city of Singapore and of course at night is fascinating! Lots of happenings and people blending together and the noise from the race track is amazing! A must see if you are in Singapore during the race
,,Really nice Race.,5.0,,"During the grand prix Season, the city become more expensive and crowded. Almost imossible to walk at the Street."
,,Interesting but expensive,4.0,,"Pros
(1) big TVs with sound to let you know what is going on
(2) great crowd atmosphere
(3) good concerts to go to pre-race and post-race

Cons
(1) tickets can be expensive
(2) not easy to get to
(3) you can probably see more racing on TV
(4) not much overtaking as it is a narrow street circuit"
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,Definitily is a must go... besides the race has a lot of concerts.. And you can see the race from different place .. because is at the street... so you can choose a rooftop bar or hotel... or just be super near of the road... heeheh
,,Ear-Shattering Blur,3.0,,"There is no denying there is a magical thrill to be a part of a magnificent gathering where A-List celebrities of sorts vie for adoration if not attention. The unmistakable COOL is all encompassing.

Strutting around with your partner of choice in tow, is ego boosting and ultimate 'WOW' in such surroundings.

To see and be seen is great. The fringe concert acts comes highly recommended.

The night road race proper, however, is less entertaining. To glance roaring cars whisk by in a somewhat blur somehow doesn't seem entertaining to me.

Overall, a mixed outing for me. You can say I like the party but hated the scene."
,,"""Under lights, added to the atmosphere""",5.0,,"On arrival a few days before the event we had to collect our tickets from a conveniently located venue. This was so well organised we were in an out in a matter of minutes! The information within the ticket pack was varied, and very detailed offering everything available at the track, from world renowned restaurants to the biggest pop stars, and more importantly how to get to and from the track. We bought an EZ-Link card and topped it up and this was the quickest and possibly the cheapest option, and it worked well! Singapore is an expensive city to visit, but the prices for food and drinks at the track were of excellent quality and realistically priced. This was our first visit to F1 in Singapore and viewing it under lights was special! To fully appreciate the race and the brilliant entertainment on offer it pays to rest up on that day! We bought a three day ticket on Turn 1 which was an excellent viewing spot, and luckily we had an unrestricted view, but at the time of booking ask if there is a clear view because near to us was a steel enclosure which was part of the stair access and those spectators were very disappointed!"
,,Superb Formula 1 Venue,5.0,,"Exciting track, perfect organization, easy to access. The night race creates a special athmosphaere. Also you can do ""other"" touristic things during daytime."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"I've never visit F1 before but being in Singapore it makes it special. The organization of the event is very high and professional, we felt very comfortable and enjoyed what we saw. the race located next to historical hotel - and the view was just amazing. If every race was looking like this... ))"
,,Awesome concert experience!,5.0,,"The last day of the performances of SG Gran Priix 2014, we watched John Legend and J. Lo live. The crowd was so fun and crazy! It was one of the best concerts I've been to!"
,,Very well organised of Grand Prix F1 race,5.0,,Enjoyed this year's F1 races. Grand Prix Stand seats in front of the Pit Stops are the best. You get to see the cars at the starting point and every time they stop for refills/tyres change. Nice walking area around with John Legend's live concert.
,,What a night,4.0,,We had good seats in the Bay stand but we were lucky as it has a fairly short straight The entertainment during the 2 practice evenings and after the race itself were fantastic with Robbie Williams & Jenifer Lopez We'll worth the cost
,,"Well organised, good value, great location",5.0,,"Throughly enjoyable - well organised (queues not long; security sensible; lots of eating/drinking options within all price ranges; easy to get about within venue), great viewing options and not too expensive (options available). Happy to recommend and come again"
,,Still the best,5.0,,"This is my second visit in Singapore GP. Is one of the best places in this F1 season. I bought a package combinations 3 days, the first day on turn 2 grandstand, the second day in the padang grandstand, and the third day in the bay grandstand. Access to and from the very simple circuit, coupled with additional operational hours of MRT during this event. In addition to the race there is also the appearance of the world's top artists artists like J.Lo, robbie williams, mayday for this year."
,,Nothing else like it.,5.0,,Fantastic street circuit set against amazing singapore skyline. Been to a couple of Grand Prix but this is definitely my favourite.
,,Best GP to date,5.0,,"We visit a GP per year. This, of Silverstone, Valencia, KL is the best to date followed by Abu Dhabi. I was wary of another street race after Valencia but need not have been. We paid near top whack for the tickets, close to the grid, but the overall experience was worth it. It was easy to access, food and bars were easy to get to. Limited queues. Great view. After the qualies, the Robbie concert was superb. After the main race, the party (at the podium lounge) was also a great addition. All in all, not a cheap weekend but great fun."
,,Nerve thrilling,5.0,,Most excited as it take corner turn and blowing of the exhaust . The crowd was fanstatic and weather at night was cool and beautiful. .
,,Fantastic Race and Experience,5.0,,we had Pit grandstand tickets and close to the action. a brilliant race and experience and good spot to view some overtakes. saw the start line getaway and cars flying by. would defo do again
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,"Very beautiful night scene, the best formula one and the only night race, especially beautiful when watching on the Flyers. Looking forward to the next race."
,,Excellent experience,5.0,,"Was lucky to get hospitality so watched in comfort. General views look good too and spectacular as a night race and still unique globally (ex UAE).
Tickets pretty expensive but includes concert tickets and this year Robbie Williams on Saturday 100% better than J-Lo on Sunday.
A great experience to try at least once."
,,Fun If you have never been close to this type of action,4.0,,"First time seeing the F1 cars up close and the night racing adds an element of interest and fun. Concerts and music venues are certainly another way to pass the time, and the big screens are a great way to be able to keep up with the action all around the street course. I would recommend the walk about passes - somewhat restrictive so check where the concert performers will be so you don't get shut out, but otherwise anywhere where there is a curve on the course, set yourself up to watch the cars go through."
,,The only night GP Race on the calender,5.0,,The singaporean's do everything the best. You haven't seen a Grand Prix until you have seen the night race in Singapore. It adds a complete new dimension to Grand Prix Racing.
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"Having photographed F1 for a number of years and been a regular visitor to Singapore it seemed the obvious choice for my first F1 experience as a paying punter. Very different atmosphere to normal, but the influx of visitors with a single goal made it even more fun. Worth trawling the web for hotels as there are some great places within walking distance of the race that don't charge the earth."
,,Grand Prix,5.0,,"My first Grand Prix and I couldn't have chosen a better one to start with. The atmosphere is unbelievable, the facilities were great and the concert at the end was the good."
,,Awesome!!,5.0,,"It is a huge event with many things to do and see. Very special atmosphere with all the bright lights shining on the track and seeing the illuminated skyline in the background. The show went on even after the qualifying or the race, since Robbie Williams and JLo had a concert there. The drinks were a little bit pricy and for the general admission the start and finish line was far away. But an amazing experience!!"
,,Fun Times,5.0,,"They really go all out. Singapore is a Clean, Safe, Fun City. Didn t feel uncomfortable in any situation there."
,,100 STARS RATING...minus the humidity.,5.0,,"Good: -Excellent event management. -Enough accommodation choices from hostels to pricey hotels. Bad: -Most of the hotels i called jacked up their room rates by 300%. -Despite the detailed explanations on the brochures & website, the seating chart for buying tickets is confusing..."
,,F1's ONLY night-time street circuit - but avoid if you're Pregnant!,4.0,,"Yes... you may need to rob a bank and STILL end up with not even a shady hotel... but THIS event is worth it's salt (or fuel)... My country started Her first year as host with lots of teething issues but as years go by, I think we've done alright.

I've tried both the Grand Stand seats and the standing Walkabout zones over the years. Personally, I prefer the party-ish air of the Walkabout zone - particularly the Padang stage area. Turn up early for and soak in the festive atmosphere. Good food and beer, music, great company of friends, shop for souvenirs, and then dance the night away at the live concerts, which usually feature famous stars. My friends and I reckoned we'd attended some of the most value-for-money concerts. We've seen Shakira, Shaggy, Katy Perry and LINKIN PARK! I don't know who's dumb idea was it to get Justin ""Beaver"" last year though - weird to even send him to a Go-Kart race... Point is, this is not just a race event. It is a sports festival!

However, I do have a HUGE bone to pick with those expectant mothers at the race… WHY? Because they shouldn't even BE there! Amniotic fluid surrounding the foetus AMPLIFIES sound, which risk making the babies DEAF from the sound of the roaring F1 engine! Unborn babies are unable to wear earplugs! So if you're pregnant, please… stay at home for the love of your baby… you can attend next season!"
,,"Great event, superb entertainment laid on",5.0,,"This was the second visit I have made to the Singapore GP and along with Spa-Francochamps is my favourite circuit. The ability to buy a 3 day ticket being in a different grandstand each day is excellent as it gives one a chance to see most of the circuit. The concerts held during the GP are numerous and provide an excellent evening entertainment . Food at the circuit is quite varied and not too expensive. If you are in Zone 1 then the food outlets and shops around the Singapore flyer give really excellent value for a GP venue.
This year it poured with tropical rain for a couple of hours immediately after the qualifying and caught many people out. Even with a waterproof jacket and umbrella I got wet after an hour, but not drenched like most others. Remember to take waterproofs and an umbrella as heavy rainfall is not unusual in Singapore."
,,City comes to life!,5.0,,"My friends and I do an annual GP trip and Singapore night race is our favourite so far. The whole city comes to life, day and night, and the organisers do a fabulous job both inside and outside the circuit."
,,Many activities to engage in,5.0,,"Every year, I tell myself this will be my last F1. Yet I end up going back every year, be it for the superstar concerts, to shoot the cars in action, or just to soak in the atmosphere. The walkabout tickets are good if you are on a budget (just get to the viewing platforms 40mins before races start to get a good spot), otherwise buy tickets at the turns. Padang and Floating Stadium are on a straight track so sometimes the action is so fast, cars whizz past in a split second. Go for the concerts, you'll not regret. As races end at 10pm and concerts start at 10.30pm, best for you to make your way to the Padang from 9.30pm onwards as it will take time for you to get there."
,,Wow what a race,5.0,,"First ever visit, very well organised and a great atmosphere. Lots of families. A very safe and very well presented. Would highly recommend you go this event, could not fault anything at all"
,,Probably the best three days ever!,5.0,,"Having always wanted to visit a Grand Prix and being able to visit this fantastic City and go to the Grand Prix was Sublime.

The organisation and the staff and the whole three days were fantastic. Our Daughter a resident arranged brilliant tickets on all three days. The bonus of being able to see top stars Robbie Williams, in a monsoon and J-Lo close up was fantastic. Food could be either local street food hygienic and cheap and even the drinks not too expensive. On top of this Lewis Hamilton won."
,,Good experience,4.0,,I am not a fan of Formula One myself but went with my partner and it was really good. There was lots of concerts and seeing a night race was quite impressive. Plus the track is right in the middle of the city so you get to see all the nice buildings lit up when walking around.
,,More Than Just A Formula 1 Race,5.0,,"Price of admission (depending if you purchase one day or all 3 days, and zone access), includes world class pop and rock entertainment during the 3 days. In addition to the F1 race, there are also GP2 and Porsche Carrera Cup races. F1 race at night makes for comfortable viewing, with the spectacular downtown lights in the background."
,,Woo hooo!,5.0,,"This is a thoroughly well organised event.
When we picked up our tickets - without being asked - the girl gave us instructions on the best MRT journey to our entry gate.
We had purchased early bird tickets (over a year before!) and had seats in the front row of the centre of the pit straight stand. The proximity of the cars going flat out was a real buzz.

My only criticism was that we (and many others) were unable to see all of the drivers in the parade, as they exited their vintage cars at the pit lane entrance. Shame.
I live in Perth & Singapore is as close to us as the Melbourne GP! We will return one day!"
,,Great Weekend,5.0,,"I liked everything about it, well managed, easy to get around, although they seem to be cutting down on viewing areas in zone 4 year after year. Food choices are good and entertainment is awesome, always something to see, good track to watch the action as can get close to the the track, unlike other circuits."
,,Awesome one of the calendars best races,5.0,,"The Singapore F1 is one of the best races of the year and this year we decided to go. Singapore itself is a great and beautiful modern city and the race fits in great. Get there early to fully appreciate the area before enjoying a great race. Fireworks at the end and then a concert which this year saw Robbie Williams, Jennifer Lopez and John Legend amongst others. If you ever get chance to go do it."
,,Not to be missed - SG's best event,5.0,,"Grand Prix but civilised - with great organisation, easy access from city, food, excellent night race under lights. What's not to like? And this year's race was superb, all the better with Hamilton winning when you're surrounded by grim-faced Aussies."
,,this is IT baby.,4.0,,one of the best grand prix i've been too. singapore is very organized when it comes to the formula 1. this is my third time and i had no problems at all. they bring the biggest music acts from around the world too which is a bonus.
,,The best Grand Prix F1,5.0,,"This is the only difference of F1. It's not boring like other race. There are so many things going on at the same time. There are usually concert going on, famous singer, famous attraction and the best thins is the paddock club. Although it's cost a fortune, but they have everything there..sometime Michelin 1 star chef. So it's one stop entertainment. It's fun and it's at night."
,,Best F1 in the calender,4.0,,"It is a beauty to see all F1 cars shinning in the night. It is action packed three nights. Collection of the ticket from Swissotel should be improved. There were two or three queues. But there was no indication of which queue for what. But the staff were friendly. Inside the Circuit people who go to walk about are should be given little more facility. The Bill boards blocking the view should be removed. Food , Drinks and water cost is little on the high side. We have to spend quite some time in the queues."
,,Singapore knows how to party!,5.0,,"F1 is a spectacle. Singapore F1 is off the hook. Saw Ziggy Marley and JLo perform... The food and beer were slightly overpriced, but when watching million dollar cars race at night, do you need to be concerned about the price of gas?"
,,Amazing engine rev roar !,4.0,,"Because the Singapore GP ,on Marina Bay Circuit is a street sircuit ,its quite difficult to see much of the track.Many hotels and building surrounds this circuit.
The Night Race itself was totally awesome,as well as the historical F1 masters race ,the Porsche one make race , F1 practices and qualifying laps.The sensation of the real engine roar cannot be compared if you watched on TV.
We saw many performances and concerts during the SG Formula 1 race this year including Jennifer Lopez ,Robbie Williams , Lady in the Moon theatrical , etc.Totally awesome!
Foods are sold at mainly at Padang Field , quite pricey, hot dogs $ 12, Fries $8 ,Beer per glass $ 12-14.
Definitely worth to see , buy your tickets early ,because its far cheaper ,they already sell the 2015 tickets also , starting September 2014 !"
,,One-of-a-kind experience,5.0,,This F1 weekend tops them all. The only night race through a spectacular city course with world class entertainment all right there in the middle of downtown Singapore. This is without a doubt a must do if you're coming during this weekend!
,,So fast,4.0,,"Night racing was great, but so fast ended. A lot of people, a lot of cars, a lot of noize - and so many happiness and joy!"
,,Truly awesome,5.0,,"As regular attendees of the British Grand Prix, we couldn't wait to enjoy our first street race. Even with good grandstand seats, it's not easy to see much of the track but the atmosphere, especially as it starts to get dark, was amazing. Facilities are good and the quality of the entertainment was outstanding - great experience!"
,,expensive unless you like cars,1.0,,"Sorry... hate grand prix rather watch grass grow; unfortunately wife booked holiday on the same weekend, big mistake as would be expected EVERYTHING doubles in price BUT still had a wonderful time."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Easy access to the Gran Prix race track, MRT and hop-on hop-off bus route. Nice pool in which to cool down."
,,"Wow, Wow, Wow",5.0,,"Where else could you go for the weekend and only pay $450 to watch the F1 and see top international artists playing, which included Robbie Williams, John Legend, Jo-Lo, Pet Shop Boys and many more. Great value for money, although beware everything in town does increase in price over the particular weekend. With an additional 20% surcharge on hotels!"
,,Must Go,5.0,,Night F1 is must event in Singapore if you can really plan your visit during that time. Advisable to book hotels in advance for that. Fantastic experience and shouldn't miss this if you can really plan
,,Amazing event,5.0,,one of the best F1 Grands Prix that I have been to - worth the expense for a once in a lifetime adventure
,,Wow,5.0,,"Just loved it, well set up with easy access. A lot to do trackside between races, free concerts with big name entertainers. View of the city was incredible, would love to go back next year."
,,Amazing first GP experience,5.0,,"Fantastic atmosphere in zone 4 - don't miss the pre-race warm-up, we joined in with the African Dancing workshop which was great fun! We were able to watch the race from multiple viewpoints, and also had access to the big stage area which had screens showing the race and was where J-Lo performed afterwards."
,,Second time around,5.0,,"We were lucky enough to be at the first race and now this time, it was wonderful ,the addition of a dining precinct was great. The view from our stand over the Bay and to Marina Bay Complex is wonderful"
,,Ultimate grand prix event!,4.0,,"This is the ultimate grand prix event! The night racing was really cool with the Singapore skyline in the backdrop along with the Singapore Flyer (Wheel). We sat in the Bay Grandstands, which are the cheapest seats but the view of the Bay is amazing, especially when the fireworks show starts as soon as the race ends. We got to see J-Lo in concert afterwards and she was outstanding! The even organizers do a wonderful job of planning events and making the entire weekend about the grand prix. We highly recommend visiting Chinatown and Little India; good food and its a bit cheaper. Singapore is quite unique because of its diverse population: Chinese, Indian, and Malay, but the official language is English. A truly unique place :)

The only drawback is the fact that Singapore is very expensive, so be prepared to shell some serious cash for just about anything. We decided to splurge on lodging (Fairmont Singapore) because it was only 2 blocks from the circuit. Orchard Rd is the shopping district for Singapore, but it's quite pricey; nice stores though. We highly recommend visiting Chinatown and Little India for some good food and shopping for souvenirs."
,,VRRRRrrrrroooommmm!!,4.0,,"F1 in all it's splendor. City get's remodeled, stores get in on the action. The track is great, you can get something good to eat at Esplanade Theater during all the activities, or just go there for some air-conditioning.

The cars themselves are not that loud anymore. What you will see depends on the ticket or hotel you bought.

With the F1 stars in town, some malls organize events for you to get closer and maybe selfie/autograph.
So on and off track, worth a go, even if you thought you didn't like F1 all that much."
,,Good race at a well organised track,5.0,,"Given that this is a street track in the centre of a city, it was very well organised. We had seats in different stands each night, so, it was good to see the various places as the event progressed. Access to and from the track was very well organised.
Concerts during, between and after the sessions were very good, with a large mix of artists and musical styles.
Food and drink was reasonably affordable and from what I tried, very good."
,,Super Time!,5.0,,"Our first Grand Prix ever & what a place to see it! The only GP night race, fabulous views across the Marina Bay area & city whilst awaiting the F1 cars to whizz by, wonderful weather & several musical acts to see as well.
We bought a 3 night ticket for around £150 & also saw Robbie Williams, Ziggy Marley & JLo in concert (along with a Japanese boy band called Mayday which we didn't know but who were very good nevertheless). This was in addition to seeing the F1 practice run on Friday, the qualifying race on Saturday & then the actual race on Sunday. Absolute bargain & may well become an annual event for us!"
,,Just fantastic!,5.0,,"It was 3 days of great racing, food and entertainment. I had a 3 day-3 different grandstand ticket which was a great way to go! There was 40 international music acts included in the price. A great carnival of entertainment!"
,,Best Ever,5.0,,"The whole event was just fantastic, great atmosphere, great race with the fantastc backdrop of the Singapore skyline. Just watch for the price of food, it is cheaper at the off track venues."
,,Best race on the circuit,5.0,,"I have done the circuit a couple of years ago and returned in 2014. Definitely worth going to. We had Grandstand seats on T1 / T2; so had amazing view of the start line, pit straight and pit exit. Try to get seats higher up, as the fence is quite high and can cause focus problems with photography. Free concerts are great. Beer and food is expensive at the track Sing$15 for 330ml beer; visit the various bars in the track, we found one doing Tiger Beer for Sing$13 for 500ml."
,,Wow! What a show! Singapore really knows how to host a world-class event!,5.0,,"Amazing atmosphere, night track looks amazing, great setup and infrastructure for hosting this high profile event, and in a perfect inner city location well serviced by the local MRT public transport. Shop or sightsee by day, and enjoy the F1 by night. Fantastic event in a fabulous city! If only we could go every year….."
,,best GP of the year,5.0,,Until you experience a night race its hard to imagine the excitement ..Singapore is a perfect city as so much to do and lots of places stay open late so always able to eat and drink after the racing. The MRT is amazing and the new stop Promenade is close to track so much easier access now.
,,The best F1 Grand Prix to go to.,5.0,,"The night F1 GP in Singapore surpasses all the other races of the year for many reasons. Probably the most important reason is that access is so easy and so quick in comparison to other iconic races like Silverstone, Monza or Spa. Only Monaco compares to how quickly you can get to your grand stand seat but this is only if you are actually staying in Monte Carlo and not outside. The Singapore GP also offers continuos entertainment at the track with amazing acts when there is no on track action. Because it is a night race you also have the entire day to explore the city or just chill at the pool until its time to go to the track which is a great advantage if some of your party are not F1 fanatics. The people are more than helpful and very friendly as well which is a change from some other circuits. Just remember to pack a poncho because when it rains it pours."
,,The ticket price comes with live concerts and other entertainment!,5.0,,"F1 in Singapore ain't just about the cars... you are paying for an entire experience of soaking in the F1 fever... the party vibe... city sights over the entire 3 day event. Top performers are brought in each year such as Maroon 5, Mariah Carey, Katy Perry and this year (2014) was John Legend, Robbie Williams & Jennifer Lopez. Others would normally pay top dollar for such first-class acts but you get it all free with your F1 ticket AND you get to watch the thrilling road-burning grand prix action as well! So it's definitely not just a race! The excitement isn't just contained within the F1 track itself... the entire city gets into the fever and there are several places around Singapore that gets into the action with F1 themed events as well such as meet-and-greet driver sessions for the few days prior to the actual event (during the F1 week). Definitely a treat for all F1 fans! Oh yes! There are celebrity sightings during F1 season as well... So far, those who flew in specially for previous Singapore GP includes Paris Hilton, David Beckam & Gordon Ramsey (just to name a few). Happens only once a year usually around the 3rd weekend of September. So those who are intending to come check out the future Singapore Grand Prix events can already start planning around that schedule. Super early bird and early bird tickets are available for purchase so early planning does help!"
,,Singapore F1 GP Rally,5.0,,Superb organization!! Lots of security and volunteers and ushers and other attractions unlike any other F1 rally :)
,,Singapore F1 Grand Prix 2014,5.0,,"Despite lacking some of the Fan enthusiasm experienced at many tracks, I would highly reccomend the whole experience, pre-planning is essential as you will not see all of the on track action and concerts, so if for example you have to see the last nights concert get a ticket for the Padang part of the Circuit."
,,A must to visit for a true F1 fan!,5.0,,"Singapore F1 night race was unbelievable. We have been attending Melbourne race every year and it does not come close to the Singapore experience. The atmosphere in the city is incredible, tickets are more expensive but you get way more included. We choose a combination grand stand tickets, that had Padang Stand on Fri, Bay on Sat and Turn 1 on Sunday. If we go again, I would just go for zone 1 (turn 1 or 2) tickets. Padang was ok if you seat closer to the corner and you can see cars coming through, but Bay Stand was very disappointing. We were in dark blue section and you get an amazing view of Marina Bay but not so much of the track. The stand is huge and all you see if people walking to and from their seats the whole time. Turn 1 (section A8) was pretty good, we could clearly see the start of the race, pit exit and cars going through corner 1 into 2. What was also impressive is the sound quality as you can hear commentators very well most of the time.
I would definitely recommend staying on track even though hotel prices are extraordinary, it does add to the whole experience. We stayed at Marina Mandarin and it was perfectly placed to attend the race with most of the gates to any zones within very short walking distance, and you could see and hear the race from the balcony.
The best part was watching part of the race from Singapore Flyer, the view was incredible and you could see majority of the track. Surprisingly there was no line, and we watched the restart from the safety car from there. Would highly recommend but keep in mind you need to have zone 1 ticket to access.
Overall, this was an amazing Grand Prix to attend, it is so well organised with great facilities, huge variety of food available and tickets include heaps of other events. It was fantastic to get to see JLo and Robbie Williams as a part of the experience as well. It is worthwhile to have a poncho with you, as weather can change quickly and ponchos sell out quickly as we learned during Robbie Williams concert..."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"It's becoming a yearly visit for us.
I love that it's at night. The track looks so good under lights. F1's at Singapore are pretty hard to beat.
Esplanade waterfront is the best grandstand. You get to see more of the cars, better photo opportunities.
I like the food stalls right behind the grandstand at makansutra gluttons bay, also that there are plenty of bars, restaurants and proper clean toilets within the shopping centre area within minutes walk of this grandstand area.

The entertainment this year I found was much better. Although Robbie Williams concert was interrupted by rain the show still went on and he is a good performer. JLO was great, very entertaining.

With transport you really need to take note on your tickets what zone you are in so you know which gate to go to, and therefore where you need to get dropped off or which MRT station to get off etc.

Beware there are a lot of road closures so be prepared that even if you are staying nearby you may not be to access direct routes (e.g we stayed at Marina Bay Sands and we had to take taxi to and from to go long way around.

Fireworks are a nice touch, always love that.

Can't wait to come again!"
,,Great Race,5.0,,Hamilton almost blew it. Great idea for a night race in hot and humid Singapore Lots of color and excitement.
,,Fantastic Event,5.0,,"This was our second year at the Grand Prix, it is so well organised and well worth the visit a little pricey but then what isn't in Singapore, we hope to be back next year"
,,Best Grand Prix event to experience,5.0,,"Great entertainment around the track makes this the best Grand Prix on the calendar. I have been to many tracks including Spa, Melbourne, Silverstone, Sepang, Monza - the racing may be better at Monza or Spa but the Singapore event is the best as an all round event. Enjoy good food, bands and the sights of Singapore - plus a great race to watch. How good is that!"
,,"Not to be missed, brilliant night race",5.0,,"Have not been to the Grand Prix before in Singapore but it was amazing. We bought Zone 4 walkabout tickets and saw the race from all different places, have never been so close to the track. We had been to the Grand Prix in Malaysia but it was nothing as good and well organised as the one in Singapore. In Malaysia unless you pay out a fortune you cannot see anything. Well done to Singapore absolutely brilliant night."
,,Excellent Race & Crowd,5.0,,"The first time I attended this event, I was very impressed with the very professional organizers. Showcase outstanding. We can enjoy the race and a great variety of performances during the event. I want to come again next year. The crowd was also quite remarkable. I also really enjoyed the concert Robbie and J-Lo."
,,Once in a lifetime event,5.0,,"This event was run like a well-oiled machine (pun intended). The race was exhilarating, the ushers knew what to do, the F&B area was chilled out, social and had so much variety of food. However my fave part of the event is the venue. Where else can you watch a race and a concert in the middle of the city amidst Singapore's amazing skyline. We should really do more events here!"
,,Much More Than Just A Grand Prix,5.0,,"What can I say, nobody organises an event better than the Singaporeans. A grand prix right in the city centre, a picturesque, modern and yet historical city. And there is enough with in close proximity to keep any non Grand Prix loving members of the family happy. How about something like 60 live world class acts - this year including Robbie Williams, The Pet Shop Boys and J Lo for instance, all included in the price of the ticket. Inside the circuit or outside the circuit great food and beverage options and in Singapore all the shopping you can handle. A must see!"
,,"Terrible Views, Oversold, Waste of Money",2.0,,"The Zone 4 walk-about tickets are utterly worthless. I can't believe people keep funding this event. For the 2014 Race, the Zone 4 Tickets were $188. The entire course is covered in barricades about 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall and severely limits views of the cars.

The have ""standing room only"" grandstands that fill up quickly and become overcrowded. These are generally on straightaways and do not give a good perspective of the overall track. Anything outside of the grandstands were covered in black tarp that you could not see through.

Honestly, the best views we were able to get was from the bridge near the Fullerton hotel (didn't require money to stand on). The wheelchair platform had excellent views too, but you had to have a wheelchair to access it.

The Grand Prix staff are not knowledgeable of the race and can offer no advice on good places to sit. The entire execution was a joke compared to other professional sporting events I've attended.

The Zone 4 was a complete waste if you actually want to watch the race. If you're there for the concerts, carnival style games, hawker centers, etc. then I suppose those are offered. It does not justify charging $188 for a ticket.

I would suggest ponying up for a ticket that offers you a reserved seat. These should probably have a guaranteed view (I would hope). Zone 4 Walkabout is terrible though. I would not recommend purchasing this for future events."
,,Great Event,5.0,,"Recent attended F1 event in Singapore. The race takes place on the streets of Singapore under lights. The event also hosts a number of free world class perfomers this year JLo, Robbie Williams, John Legend to menation just a few. Therfe is always someting going on at this event between races, so you never get bored. There are plenty of food stalls and drinks with prices on the whole reasonable (by F1 standards at least)
If you are into F1 this needs to be on your bucket list, if you are visiting Singapore take a chance and visit, if only for the music acts."
,,Brilliant a not to miss event,5.0,,"The Grand Prix is amazing in singapore and a must attend event. We attended all three days and had an amazing time. The racing is great, the atmosphere is rocking and the food is terrific. The concerts and other free entertainment make the price of the ticket great value. We saw Robbie Williams who was truly amazing. JLO who was ok. The food in the hawker village is cheaper than the other areas in the park. The food was good quality with a good variety to choose from."
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,"We had turn 1 combo tickets which gave us entry to Pedang Grandstand on Friday, Bay on Saturday and Turn 1 Grandstand on Race night. Bought our tickets at early bird prices and seats were fantastic. This is our first time to live race and will definitely be going back. Were a little worried about prices for food and drink in the circuit but if you look around it's not too bad managed to get beers ( tins)for 5 dollars in the concert hall and 6 tigers for 50 dollars at Jamie's Italian Kitchen on race night. zone 4 and zone 1 had hawker markets where you could eat for around 8 dollars per main course with plenty of choice. We were able to take in one bottle of water/soft drink each but did see people being stopped from taking food in so we didn't bother trying. All in all a great time and Robbie Williams put on a great show despite it being torrential rain ( and we are not fans but take my hat off to him for his performance)"
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"If you are in town in September this is THE attraction of the year. Whether you are a F1 fan or not (I am not) the buzz of the night race and the excellent entertainment put on around the race is second to none. It's expensive, but if you buy a walkabout ticket there's access to the Padang where headline acts play. The grandstand tickets will get you much better views of the cars, but tbh if you're not a petrol head, you can catch glimpses of the race from the side of the track. We have been 3 years in a row and loved it every time. The only year we didn't have a waterproof poncho was this year........"
,,Worth every dollar!,5.0,,"Had the walkabout tickets so you could really hear the tyres screech and burn! Round after round, literally every minute for an intense hour or so u see the drivers battle it out....highly entertaining under the sparkling singapore skyline.

Getting to the Singapore race stands is as easy as abc with the downtown location and efficient mrt.

Am so glad we caught pet shop boys and mayday band too!

In short, the tickets were worth every single penny!"
,,Fantastic night race,2.0,,Fantastic night race. Great food. Great trackside attractions. But needs better transport to and from the race. Security guards are rude and are mindless sheep. Will not attend again due to poor management.
,,grand prix singapore,4.0,,The formula I grand prix in singapore is held in the night as the climate is cooler. I remember the loud sounds of the racing motors and Veittel winning the race with mark weber of Australia in third position. It was enjoyable and memorable
