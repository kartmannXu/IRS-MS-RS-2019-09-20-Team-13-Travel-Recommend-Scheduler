,,Changi WW II Tour,4.0,,Carol our guide was very passionate and knowledgeable about the subject matter. Unfortunately the museum is closed for renovations but the addition of Kranji war cemetery was excellent. Would recommend. The start at Pasir Ris and the finish at Kranji meant a long trip back to the airport. All in all though a learning experience and thoroughly enjoyed.
,,Interesting place to visit,5.0,,"A little difficult to get to from the city train and local bus but worth the time, very moving and educational"
,,Unfortunately all closed for renovation,4.0,,"But nonetheless this gets a 'very good' rating because the security guard behind the locked gate was exceptionally helpful and knowledgeable (no surprise really: before he retired he was one of the managers there). So, whilst not being able to walk around the place, we learnt a lot about Changi prison and the whole area. However, the restaurant next doors was open and we had a nice afternoon tea there."
,,Changi Museum under restoration,4.0,,"I'm sure this will be wonderful when completed, however in the meantime, only the Chapel is open to the public. This too will be closed for restoration as from January 2019 and the whole site will re-open in 2020."
,,Must see for a visit to Singapore,4.0,,Remember the atrocities of Japanese occupation and the treatment of the prisoners. Least we forget what occurred here. After can get a meal at the restaurant next door.
,,Unforgettable experience,5.0,,"Everyone whilst in Singapore should visit the Changi Museum which is housed in a replicated construction of the chapel which was in the Changi Prison. The personal stories of the suffering endured by some of the inmates under the Japanese occupation are quite poignant and brought tears to my eyes.
The primitive drawings provide a sketchy illustration of life in the prison and the artefacts and utensils crafted by the inmates demonstrate the ingenuity of the inmates as they struggle to survive against the terrible conditions they had to endure."
,,our afternoon on the Changi WW11 War trail coach tour,5.0,,"What a moving and informative tour with Carol Dragon as our guide. Polite and friendly and telling us the story of the occupation and war in Singapore during WW2. Carol knew the history and delivered is so well that we really didn't want to finish our day with her. She gave a personal perspective and could answer the many and varied questions that were asked of her.

I had an Uncle who was a POW in Changi so this tour was one I wanted to get the most out of and it certainly didn't disappoint.

Unfortunately the museum will not be complete until 202 so a return trip will on the wish list.
would highly recommend this tour and would like to thank Carol for her time and insight on our tour."
,,Excellent museum,4.0,,A very moving experience with comprehensive information about the Japanese occupation. Also an excellent gift shop selling some really interesting books.
,,First time we have visited Changi museum,4.0,,Very interesting but for me an upsetting experience I found it very emotional pleased I did it as it is part of history very well portrayed.
,,No Australian should miss this experience.,5.0,,It's not that big as I would have thought. It's not that imposing either. But go inside and definitely have a guide with you. The tour will over power you. Any one who has visited there is profoundly moved by the stories. It's a must for any Aussie.
,,Wonderful place to visit,5.0,,"This si simply a wonderful place to visit, with a timeless sense of just whta those of us wih family that suffered during the second world war either as civilians or solidiers went through simply to survive. A true testament to human endurance and cruelty and a reminder just how evil our species can be."
,,A personal pilgrimage,4.0,,"We have visited this museum on two separate occasions, and it was due to our desire to see it that we first made the long journey from the U.K.

My father in law was in the RAF during World War 2 and was captured by the Japanese and sent to Changi. He took part in the building of the infamous Burma Railway and suffered greatly at the hands of his captors. He survived and actually lived until he was over 90. He was a brave man and spoke little of the traumas he experienced, but he saw dozens of his comrades succumb to malnutrition, sickness and the inhuman treatment meted out to these young men. He, himself, suffered from innumerable bouts of malaria, including the very dangerous cerebral form, and was saved by the dropping of antibiotics by the American forces as they liberated the various camps in the jungle.

He was a survivor and we are so proud of the way he adapted to his brutal imprisonment.

So it had always been a dream of mine to visit the museum with my husband, his son.

We found the visit very moving, so much so that we were in tears in places. We had no idea of the variety of people who were imprisoned and tortured. It’s fascinating to see the artefacts, especially the amazing patchwork made by the women in prison, with hidden meanings.

The museum itself is in poor condition, and these wonderful artefacts are not displayed to their best advantage. It’s worrying to see them so unprotected and poorly displayed.
But the story these artefacts tell is amazing. Such bravery, such heartbreak, but such stories of great humanity - despite all the fear and the terrible conditions people supported each other, and shared their meagre rations, and performed in concerts, and tried to keep spirits up.

The chapel is very moving. We lit a candle for him and my husband left a message. Our 4 children flew out to join us for this moving pilgrimage.

We are pleased to hear the museum is being refurbished and we hope to be able to visit it again before too long."
,,A vist to a WW2 commemorative museum,4.0,,A first class extremely detailed museum of life in Singapore under the Japanese occupation 1942 - 1945. Some interesting relics including replica murals and a cell door from the old Changi Gaol.
,,A must visit place to reflect,3.0,,"A small and unassuming museum on the grounds of Changi Prison has lots of photos and stories about the internment of Australian, New Zealand, Indian, English and local's following the Japanese invasion during WWII. Eye opening stuff."
,,HISTORY AND SADNESS,4.0,,"You have to grit your teeth and remember with this one....heartbreaking, made me cry tot think about it all.....but would not have missed it......They ;live in my memory...."
,,Worth the travel to get there,5.0,,"If you are genuinely interested in the historical aspects or have family reason for visiting here then it is well worth the hour no.2 bus ride from China Town, it only costs $2,50 per person. Entrance is free.
We visited here because the wife had a relative imprisoned here for a while and wanted to leave something in his memory.
Even without this reason we would still have visited here because of its historical importance. The museum and chapel are both very poignant and moving and I think it would be impossible not to be touched by either.
The staff here are very friendly and helpful. There is also a reference library for anyone to use should they wish to.
Pleasant gardens and even a nice bar restaurant on the site."
,,Paying tribute to Dad,5.0,,"We travelled by coach to Changi Beach with our excellant guide Weina. She knew what she was talking about & explained a lot of new information to me. We then went to Changi Museum & a brilliant display of the torrid times in World War 2. The Chapel was very emotional & moving. As I wanted information on my Father who was interned there,I along with 5 other couples was taken into a separate area & shown some records in which we were able to find our loved ones. Such an emotional day & so much respect for the museum."
,,Very Moving,4.0,,"Spent a few hours here reading about and taking in the displays of the Singaporean & POW experiences of the Second World War

Being British & living in Australia with an Australian son and an uncle who was a prisoner of the Japanese at Changi I found the experience moving

My Son and I also spent some time looking through the registers of ex-pows and found three family namesakes two Australians & one British who died whilst in Captivity at the hands of the Japanese

A place for reflection to spend sometime to remember those that suffered and died so that we can live the life’s we do today"
,,Very moving,5.0,,"My godfather was a prisoner-of-war in Changi prison during WW2 so this was a very emotional experience for me seeing the museum. But even if you didn't have any personal connection with the prison or the war, this is a deeply moving story."
,,War trail tour,5.0,,Sha was a wonderfully passionate and friendly guide. He had so much to share and added a personal touch yet kept the sobriety of the subject matter. Took us right around the island which in itself added to the tour.
,,Wasted trip,1.0,,After spending 1 hour traveling on Singapore MRT arrived to be told closed for renovation. Reopening 2020. Maybe tourist authorities should have signs indicating the closure
,,Interesting,5.0,,Changi Musuem is quite small but so interesting. Everyone is so helpful in Singapore! You can also take a headset tour.
,,Fascinating experience!,5.0,,"As a child growing up in Malaysia, I often heard stories from my dad about the Japanese occupation of Malaya & Singapore during WW11 but little did I realised how much emotions that this visit to the old Changi Prison and War Memorial had evoked. The stories suddenly became a reminder of how much sufferings there was during the war. Sadly, though till this day, some of the older folks are still struggling to come to terms. The experience was fascinating and brought tears to my eyes. Much compliment to our guide who was very informative and made it a wonderful day."
,,Closed until 2020,1.0,,"Unfortunately the attraction closed for refurbishment the day before we visited. MRT, 20 mins on the bus only find that it would be closed until 2020. Other visitors arrived after us only be disappointed as well."
,,CLOSED UNTIL 2020!!!!!,1.0,,Do NOT lug all the way out to this museum - you will surely be disappointed that it is closed until some time in 2020! Extremely frustrating to discover after the loooong ride it here... with irritable teenager.
,,Lucky to visit as closing for a rebuild,5.0,,Part of the tour of the WW2 Japanese invasion of Singapore and I learned a lot more about what happened.
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,The museum presents a dark part of Singapore's history. The displays were tasteful and avoid overdramatising the horror of what would have been. Entry is free but the self guided audio tour costs $12 for two to share. It is a fair way out of town and requires changing from train to bus if on public transport.
,,An extremely informative and emotive museum,4.0,,"The museum and chapel are located on the site of the infamous Changi Prison which was demolished in the 1980s. The museum's exhibits are presented in what are by today's standards a somewhat old fashioned manner. It is especially meaningful for anyone who has relatives who were subjected to the bestiality of the Japanese The very moving letters displayed for relatives are testament to that.
The museum closed on the 1st April but the chapel will still by open for visitors. The museum will, apparently, be given a complete update and is scheduled to reopen next year."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"We went on an organised trip with Tour East, well worth it, with an excellent commentry from Woo, giving the full history of Singapore during and since the war."
,,A little sterile but very informative,5.0,,I wanted to go as I felt I owed to the people of Singapore to see how they had suffered at the hands of the Japanese. It was a well presented if not particularly well laid out exhibition.
,,Massively disappointing,2.0,,"The display for this important museum is extremely disappointing. You do not see any of the actual former gaol (prison) used by the POWs, and even the chapel isn’t original.

The information is limited, but the ex- POWs comments, paintings, stories of the important historical event are interesting.

Such a shame the museum itself is a massive let down, and I wouldn’t recommending driving from downtown Singapore to see this limited display."
,,Somewhat disappointing memorial to an event that shattered so many lives.,3.0,,"There are few tangible artefacts in the museum, and lots of reproductions or facsimilies. The museum serves a purpose for later generations who may not fully appreciate the events that led to the incarceration of so many men in such appalling conditions, but those looking for a more personal insight into the horrors that occurred there may be better advised to red survivors accounts in the various books available. I'm sure that the good people of Singapore will never allow these events to be forgotten, but equally, I understand that they do not want to be defined forever by them."
,,Moving an emotional,5.0,,A must for every visitor to Singapore. One can not imagine the horrors that took place. It makes you so appreciative following the sacrifice of others Lest we Forget
,,Half day tour,5.0,,Museum and chapel was very interesting. It was more emotional than I thought it would be. They had letters and photos from Australian families that had survived the prison in WW2 displayed
,,MOVING,5.0,,"Growing up after WW11 and as a child knowing some men who were POWs, I found this moving to the point of having a tear in my eye reading the comments of people who had been in Changi under the Japanese. It filled the gaps between what was said, and what actually happened, and I fully understand the hatred towards the Japenese. A must see, but it can be confronting and very Moving."
,,Worth more Time,5.0,,"We arrived at Changi Museum and Chapel, in pouring rain as part of a round Singapore day trip. Some of our number on the coach would have bypassed this in favour of a return to the ship! Really? This is an Iconic Memorial to those who were encarcerated there during WW2.

The Original Chapel had been build by the POW,s ...the original dismantled and taken to Australia in order to save it .... but the brass cross made by one POW from odd bits of brass is in situ. The museum is detailed, and beautifully put together warranting a lot more time than the 25 minutes we were given. A very sad part of history, but as always individual acts of heroism and stoicism shone through.
It isn’t mentioned, but ask before taking photographs inside the museum, as many of the displays are from personal collections.
No, this isn’t the actual prison ...it is being used by today’s prisoners, but the Museum has been put together with dedication in order the those of today can understand what others suffered."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"We enjoyed our visit here, very informative. We caught the bus to this place and enjoyed the ride with the locals, who also were very friendly and helpful."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"I learned so much from this museum including the impact of WWII on local Singaporeans - I had previously only thought of the impact on Australians. The museum is a little out of the way, but can be reached by MRT or taxi."
,,Very moving,5.0,,The Changi Prison Chapel Museum is not a large museum but one that should be visited during your visit to Singapore. We did the audio tour and hearing the stories from POW’s was very moving. There is a good display of documentation and artefacts on display. Please be aware that no photos are allowed to be taken during your visit inside the museum. Books and other literature are available for purchase in the gift shop at reasonable prices.
,,A totally dry display with almost no connection to the actual POW prison,1.0,,"Very disappointed with this museum which has been built outside the area formerly occupied by the infamous POW prison. The trip from downtown Singapore is, frankly, not worth it. You could get more information from a book. The museum is not accessible from the MRT train so it's taxi or number 2 bus.

Given the historical significance of the Changi POW prison, a room full of photos with descriptive text, even with the benefit of the audio guide, was really lame."
,,A must -- for all ages!,5.0,,"This museum is truly representative of many cultures, many centuries and such rich history. I learned a lot, and had such a delightful experience. I only wish I had more time. I highly recommend this museum for all ages."
,,Sad but important stop on a trip to Singapore,5.0,,"Call me ignorant, but I had no idea Singapore had a part in WWII, especially such a difficult one. I'm glad I made the effort to make it to the Changi Museum. The exhibits were difficult to look at at times, but informative and important. One thing that stuck with me for a long time was the art of prisoners in Changi. What a difficult period of a history."
,,Interesting,4.0,,It takes about 40 miniutes to get there by MRT and bus. The directions given in the Leaflet for the Museum down to the number of the bus stop.
,,Small but packed with interesting detail,4.0,,"I expected this museum to be rather more on the scale of the Auschwitz museum in Poland but it is much smaller, confined to one small building. However this building contains around 25 dioramas each with detailed descriptions, images and objects and you are given a very full picture of life in Singapore, leading up to the Japanese invasion and then in the years after both for the prisoners and for the residents. It is well worth-while hiring an audio guide. Unfortunately the museum is due to be closed for lengthy refurbishment so unless you are able to go before mid March 2018 there is no possibilityof a visit till perhaps 2020. Do check before attempting the journey out there since it is way out close to the airport. Once refurbished I would certainly consider visiting again as the life conditions for those there during the 39-45 war, soldiers and civilians, including the women caught up in the horrors, are portrayed with remarkable detail and insight."
,,interesting and moving,4.0,,"Well worth the trip to get here, by MRT and bus.
A small museum with plenty of reading, but well presented. very quiet when we went.
Covers the time after Japanese occupation in WW2.
Found the chapel murals and the story of Stanley Warren very moving.
After the visit, there's a good café/bar next door."
,,Nice History,5.0,,Simply speaking for history and museum lovers ... have never been one but this place is much much interesting than expected .. do visit .. a must for history lovers
,,An extension of the Battlebox experience,4.0,,"This museum is close to the airport and Chiangi Village. However, from central Singapore, one will need to take the metro and then transfer to a bus. The museum is free and focuses on Singapore during the Japanese occupation. We would recommend going on the Battlebox tour first, and then visit the Changi Museum to learn what happened after the British surrendered."
,,A small unique museum,3.0,,A less typical museum containing many artifacts from POW and interned civilians during WW2. The presentation of the artifacts is slightly cramped. One needs to do some reading to get the most out of this museum. We visited this location as part of a private tour.
,,A sober reminder that war should always be avoided,4.0,,"The photos, letters, drawings and paintings were all sober reminders of the horrors of war. For those fortunate not to have personally experienced a war, walking through this quiet museum, reviewing all the memorabilia left behind by the prisoners of war and looking at the photos was very sobering and moving. For those of us fortunate not to live in war torn countries, reading about wars that take place elsewhere or watching segments in the news on TV keeps the destruction on our fellow humans at a safe and somewhat dis-associative distance. This museum is a good reminder of the brutality of war and that we should prevent, not engage in war."
,,Very moving,4.0,,"This museum is very moving as it contains a lot of personal items, letters, etc. The museum is purpose-built and includes a replica church. It is easy to spend an hour here-or more if you use the attached restaurant where the food looked pretty good!
The museum is right next to the Changi road and the bus number 2 stops right outside."
,,Quite emotional,4.0,,"We went on a round island tour as my husband was quite keen to see the Changi memorial. There are a lot of photos and relics from the war. It gives an insight into what it was like for those people caught up in the war, not just the soldiers"
,,Emotional,5.0,,Remembering the soldiers who were imprisoned here during the occupation. Accounts come not from academics but those who were really there and knew what it was like. Somewhat out of the way but definitely worth visiting.
,,A peice of history,5.0,,"This museum tells a distressing story with respect and dignity. It does explains quietly and succinctly what happened when the Japanese forces took over Singapore after the British surrender. It doesn't dwell on the horrific, although it leaves no doubt about the suffering of those affected, rather it celebrates the triumphs of humanity especially through the places of worship created by the POW's. The Changi murials reproduced here, and their story, are very moving.
Well worth a visit, and easy to get to by bus 2 from Tanah Mereh MRT interchange. Allow approx 1-2 hours on site."
,,Very Moving,4.0,,"My husband and I visited on the day we were flying out as it is quite close to the airport, and quite out of town, this worked well as we checked our bags in at the airport prior. A little disappointed as the museum looks tired, and I believe that they could have covered so much more. However I believe they are closing in april for renovations, so lets hope they do a good job in bringing it up to the standard it deserves. We had done Battle Box before, so this gave a good insite as to what happens next. A bit biased being an aussie, but believe there should have been a section on Weary Dunlop and the hospital staff on what they contributed. Totally agree with others regarding the audio, well worth it to hear the extras and the moving interviews of some incredibly brave people. I understand that you cannot take photos inside the museum, but believe there should be other areas or a monument that you could take for your memories. The exterior of the building is boring, and you wouldn't even know where you are. The only negative was the groups going through with their guide, over powering the time of reflection that you are going through at your pace."
,,"Hard, but important to see",4.0,,"After Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942, thousands were imprisoned in the Changi peninsula. This chapel and museum are dedicated to the memory of all of the civilians and prisoners of war who suffered during the Japanese occupation of Singapore from 1942 to 1945.

The horrific life of the prisoners caused many to seek solace and comfort in religion and a number of chapels eventually eventually appeared, constructed by the POWs. They improvised with the scarce building material available. One POW painted five murals depicting biblical scenes, and those murals were instrumental in uplifting the morale of many POWs."
,,Great Small Museum,5.0,,"This place is a little out of the way, especially if you’re staying centrally (it can take 45 minutes to an hour to reach). It is very interesting though if history, and especially WWII is your thing.

I’d recommend paying the $8 for the audio guide. There are a LOT of information panels and the audio guides provide more colour and break up the monotony of reading so much. I’d allocate 1-2 hours to see it all, depending on how quickly you go through it. It took me 2 hours to complete the audio guide."
,,WWll history in Singapore,4.0,,"I visited with my husband as we are both interested in history particularly War history but also a family relative was a POW in the Changi camp in WWll. The museum charts the invasion of Singapore by the Japanese and the set up of the POW camp and prison. The conditions were awful and as we know history documents how abusive and cruel the Japanese were but the story also tells us of the amazing spirit of the British, Australian, Indian & Chinese who were held in these awful conditions including women and children. The museum is about 20/25 minute drive from the City depending where in the City you are staying but so worth the effort. There is also a very nice bar/restaurant right next door which I recommend."
,,Amazing tribute to a nightmarish era,5.0,,This Museum is a truly incredible record of a horror story. Visitors were absolutely silent and absorbed in reading the history of the event but regrettably our concentration was interrupted by a loud- mouthed Australian yobbo who was intent on sharing his knowledge of not only Changi but anything else which he felt compelled to share. A disgrace.
,,Pleasant & eductaional,5.0,,"This museum is a must-do! It is educational and interesting, and the audio tour really gives you a great knowledge Staff were very accommodating."
,,Remember the civilians too,5.0,,"Changi chapel and museum.

Well spaced and explained facility where the exhibits are relevant and interesting. Very somber by reason of it being a reflection of the suffering and hardships endured by the captured soldiers and civilian internees. What is given some, but not enough explaining are the hundreds of thousands of Singaporean civilians and other Asian indentured ‘labourers ‘ who too suffered and died during the occupation .....remember these people too."
,,A tribute to man's tenancity in adversity,5.0,,This is a small museum but it shows how we are able to cope under extreme pressure and torture. The murals should be better known and it is good that they are preserved in this museum. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Lest we forget,4.0,,"This was my second trip to the Changi Museum. The audio tour wasn’t available for my first visit and certainly enriched the experience. The Museum tells the story of the fall of Singapore in World War II, the internment of the defenders and civilians and the eventual recapture of the island state. It is very well done. As an Australian, this story is very dear to my heart. A must-see for anyone with a connection to the story."
,,Small. Lots to read.,4.0,,Plenty to read from World War II. Photo artificates and audio head set. I recommend going alone and listening to the rentable audio head set. I spent about 2.5 hours there and has in a rush as it was closing. You could spent 4 hours there if you read everthing word for word and listen to all of the audio.
,,Sunday exploration,5.0,,Decided to pop by after lunch... although living in Singapore i havent visited before. Interesting and awesome facts about our history and the sec9bd world war in the pacfic.. a must visit kinda place
,,Historical visit,4.0,,This was also on my to-do list and hubby & I really enjoyed the experience. We caught the bus almst to the door did the audio tour then had a delicious breakie at the nearby restaurant
,,A very moving place,4.0,,Experiencing the history presented in the museum was very moving and informative of a dark chapter in history. It is an easy trip by train and bus to get to the musuem. You will need about 2 hours to move through all the displays and the Chapel.
,,Awesome,4.0,,Historically rich and very uplifting. Good for family’s. Peaceful serene environment. Preferably weekday visitation in the morning or afternoon.
,,Interesting History,3.0,,"We had a couple of hours to kill before leaving from Singapore (Changi) Airport so we caught the train to the Changi Museum, got off too far down the track and then caught a taxi back. We should have just caught a taxi in the first place as it was only about SD$6. We enjoyed the museum, being Australians and hearing some of the stories about the hardships endured during WWII. Interesting readings on the walls and some interesting artefacts, especially the quilts made by the women prisoners of war. Entry is free and the ladies at the entrance and gift shop exit were very friendly."
,,Incredible place to visit,5.0,,We've just returned from a visit to Singapore and the excellent Changi Museum and Chapel. It is well set out with lots of information about WWII organised in such a way that your attention is captured from the start to the end of your visit. The audio guide is informative and interesting and the personal stories that are included bring the exhibits to life. The staff are extremely helpful and we would strongly recommend that you add this to your 'must do' list!
,,War History,4.0,,I really wanted to see this place as a friends grandfather was a POW here. It is a small memorial and museum but still very interesting. I found my friends relative in the book that they have all the people that spent time there recorded.
,,"Nice museum, feels a little detached",4.0,,"The collection is nice, it is a bit out of the way from downtown next to the airport, but worthe the trip. They have a rebuild of a chapel there, but compared to the world class National Museum it fall a bit short. However it is free and has a charm on its own. I was taken back a bit by the disrespect in the chapel by other visitors talking loudly. All in all it feel like there was a missed opportunity here, with the location being right there but no real connection to the location. The bar next to it feels out of place."
,,Take the audio tour!,5.0,,"Admission to Changi Museum is free, but take out the audio tour for $8.00. Not only do you get info about the different exhibits, there are options to hear first hand accounts from people who were there or involved with the topic, e.g. the story told by the son of how his father came by the Japanese swords & how they eventually ended up in the museum, or the account of a comfort woman.
The museum relies on pictures & artefacts but you can easily spend 3 or 4 hours in the few rooms, such is the wealth of information. Photography is not allowed inside the museum, just the Chapel & the outside walls.
A must-see for any visitor to Singapore."
,,A must see Tour,5.0,,My wife and I visited the Changi museum it was a wonderful tour very informative tour lasting about 3 hours well worth a look
,,Moving experience,4.0,,"Caught a Grab Taxi from Orchard Rd to Changi Museum around 1.00pm so it only cost 21.00 SDG.
The museum is free to enter and whilst it’s small not on the same scale as Hiroshima or Pearl Harbour, it certainly provides an emotional insight into what the prisoners went through. It was more personal to me as this is part of Australia’s history and seeing the horrendous inhumanities that the Australians, Kiwis, British and the Singaporeans were subjected to brought tears to my eyes.
I was there with my Husband and 2 teenage kids who found it very moving. We spent a couple of hours going through the exhibits ourselves (without the audio tour) and I would recommend all Australians visiting Singapore take the time to visit this museum."
,,Very moving experience - don't miss it,4.0,,"Visited with my husband and 3 teenage sons. We had a spare couple of hours on the way to the airport and the taxi driver offered to wait for us, as it is a bit out of the way and maybe not easy to get a maxi taxi (also solved the problem of what to do with our bags). We used the self guiding headsets and the commentary was very good, the displays were well presented and often heart breaking, but it tells a chapter of WW2 history that mustn't be forgotten."
,,Must do,5.0,,"A must do to pay respects and as a reminder how lucky one is now . Highly moving. Whilst you can't take photos in the museum, there's really no need as the articles and photos in the museum will stay with you forever. Allow a minimum of 1 hour. We did a half day Changi Museum and Chapel tour.


Photos (Optional)"
,,WarTime relic restored.,5.0,,"Quiet, a little far for travellers, but a historic site very well restored. What is seen is only the Chapel scrapped up by the POWs interned there. Old photos bring you back to the hardships faced as POW in WW2. Very well done surviving photos."
,,Small but informative,4.0,,"Getting there is a easy take the MTR to Tampines then a number 29 bus from bay 9. The bus stop is right outside the museum. If there are two of you the Audio tour costs $12 and well worth it. With victims stories and good commentary without being boring. The cafe is expensive, however there is a multitude of food outlets at the station which is much cheaper and perhaps a bit more authentic, at least you can sit with the locals and watch the interactions."
,,"Audio tour not really worth it, but excellent museum otherwise.",5.0,,"If you are in a hurry, augment your visit with the audio tour. But if you have about three hours to spare, the audio tour doesn't really too much to the experience, because the exhibits tell quite a rich story. An excellent museum overall."
,,Interested in the war history,5.0,,"The Changi Museum is well worth the visit, easily accessible via the MRT & Bus system.
The little museum has a great collection of war history memorabilia, artifacts & audio recordings with an adjoining chapel where you can pay your respects.

For a history buff, allow for 2-3hrs to go through the museum thoroughly to appreciate the collection."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,If you`re interested in the recent history of Singapore (WW2 British surrender of Singapore) then this Museum is well worth a look. We found the easiest way to get there was to catch the MRT to the airport and then catch a taxi from there but the driver explained on the way back that we should have incurred a flat $50 fee for being dropped back at the departure area to catch the MRT back so that may be something to consider ( He didn't charge us this on the day). The museum was compact but full of interesting information regarding the people of Singapore and how they suffered and survived through the Japanese occupation
,,The story of Singapore's surrender and the consequences - very moving,4.0,,"Not large a large museum but it captures the essence of the period a very moving experience; my wife’s step-grandfather was a prisoner. One leaves almost numbed by the brutality of the Japanese invaders, which the displays clearly show. If visiting by cab – the museum will call a cab if you need one for your return journey."
,,A no holes barred reminder of the horrors of war!,5.0,,Can't even begin to understand how the prisoners suffered in such appalling conditions. Their inventiveness and determination to survive was inspiring.
,,Poignant,5.0,,"I am 72. I was on my way to join my wife and family in New Zealand.I stopped-over in Singapore to catch up with Chinese friends, that I haven't seen in 30 years. I chose to stay in the Village Hotel in Changi providing a perfect base to explore this fascinating island,and on the first bus ride to Tampines Central, we passed the site of this museum. The very next day, before taking the MRT to Harbourside, I alighted and spent an emotional hour here. My uncle, Charles Edward Macklin, was captured at the fall of Singapore on the 15th February 1942, almost as soon as he had set up a defensive barrier across the Bukit Timah, the main road leading from the Johor Burhu crossing into the heart of the Lion City. He was incarcerated with many of the 50 thousands of others, and as a Army officer, a former middle-weight boxing champion in the services, and a secondee to the Indian Army, he received special treatment by the Japanese occupiers. Needless to say, I was deeply moved by the countless personal stories, the many artefacts, and in particular the replica of St.Luke's chapel, patron saint of hopeless cases., on the ground floor of the former Roberts Barracks, which brought some comfort to the prisoners in the Changi complex. It was deeply moving to view the Warren murals, based on the four New Testament Gospels, especially the Nativity with its depiction of the multi-racial 3 wise kings, and the words
""Peace on earth to men of goodwill""."
,,Good Museum,4.0,,We did this as part of a tour but we didn't have enough time here to look and read everything. Very informative. Well done.
,,Excellent museum,5.0,,"This gives all the facts of the British surrender and Japanese occupation in a clear, concise and very moving way. Well worth a visit and free entry."
,,A very good museum,5.0,,"Well worth the visit, take the MTR to Tanah merah and the no 2 bus to the museum, the travel is all covered by the tourist pass and the museum has an audio guide to rent ,it’s all very affordable.
Be prepared to spend 2 hours there it’s very well done ,covers the Changi Prison and the occupation of Singapore in great detail and a replica of the Changi Chapel finishes it off. The staff are great and very obliging and there is a cafe ."
,,Informative,3.0,,"We visited here after the Battle box and in the knowledge this museum is to close shortly for renovation. It doesn't compare to the Battlebox. This museum had a lot of reading, although there was also an audio tour on offer. The display were memories of people who had been interred as prisoners of war. It was insightful and I really enjoyed seeing the paintings done by inmates with limited materials. No photos inside."
,,A poignant visit of our trip.,5.0,,"Having lived in Singapore as a child, the atrocities of the war in Singapore were based on hearsay. This brought it all home, very vivid and thought provoking. Well worth a visit."
,,Changi War Museum,5.0,,This is a very moving experience for anyone who has an interest in the war in the Far East. The determination and the suffering of those who were imprisoned at Changi Prison Compound.
,,Due to close soon for renovation,5.0,,"After having visited the Battlebox this museum is a continuation of the history of Singapore during World War 2. The museum is free however I'd recommend paying for the audio tour, just $8.The exhibitions are excellent. The museum is due to close soon for renovation so keep an eye on the website before you visit. Now that the BLUE LINE MRT has been extended you can catch the MRT to Upper Changi station then bus no2 to the museum. The bus runs nearly every 10-15 mins."
,,"You should go here, it's disturbing but informative",5.0,,"A small museum to inform, and keep memories and history alive. A good little shop attached, small open chapel to pay your respects. Worth the taxi journey, the staff will book you a return taxi if you need one (make sure taxi takes you to museum not the actual jail next door!)"
,,Very Moving Experience,5.0,,A very moving experience seeing the history of POWs. Well set up and easy to access. Good displays and information
,,Moving,5.0,,I was moved by the photos and stories captured within the museum. It was well set out and documented and certainly portrayed the suffering of the POW. It was well attended by bus groups during our visit. I enjoyed our visit.
,,A must see when you visit Singapore,5.0,,"We went to Changi jail by MRT and bus, very moving place to visit. As a quilter, I was astonished to learn of the Changi Quilts, made by the women prisoners of war, must do some research on the English Quilt. Brave people, brave country."
,,"Focus on life in Singapore and in the Camp, not on the defense of Singapore",5.0,,"The last reviewer remarks that this museum focuses on life in Singapore under the Japanese plus, of course, life in the Changi Camp for both military and civilian prisoners. He laments the lack of content re the defense of Singapore. My father was a prisoner in Changi and was a soldier in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders which, I understand, was the last regiment to fight it's way down the Peninsula and across the causeway, and I therefore have some sympathy with that reviewer's view. There was only one mention of the Argylls that I could see in the entire museum (other than the long, long list of their dead in the summary books just inside the exit), so I would also have liked to see more about the military campaign related to the defense of Singapore - but I suspect that would be an entirely different museum. This museum is about the Camp and about life for the locals under Japanese occupation and assessed against that objective it is a success. While it is very low tech (but do get the audioguide which is definitely worthwhile), its thematic approach works quite well. There are relatively few physical artifacts but they are well used to highlight key areas such as health, food, how the prisoners entertained themselves and the like. I did think it was a little odd that no photographs were allowed given there were no copyright issues, but perhaps the curator thinks this is a mark of respect and he might be right. At the end of the day it's a fairly grim little museum, even for those with no family involvement. For me it brought home how much my generation owes to my father and his generation and how lucky we are that we haven't had to go through anything similar.

On a practical note don't let your hotel suggest hiring a car and driver (and certainly don't bother with the MRT). We got a taxi from Orchard Rd to the Museum for only S$14 and there was a taxi waiting outside when we got out (and if there isn't the staff will ring for one."
,,Ordinary and insular.,1.0,,"There is minimal mention of the Australian defensive involvent during the Japanese invasion of Singapore.
When you enter the exibition you will be asked to register
your name and country of origin.
On the day I visited all the visitors registering were from Australia.
I wonder if they walked away from this place feeling as angry and disappointed as I felt.
The exibition highlights the hardship and heroism of Singaporeans but falls very short of recognizing the Australian war effort in their very own back yard where our men who lost their lives trying to save theirs.

Can not endorse."
,,A very moving experience,5.0,,"A small but comprehensive museum that takes you through the experiences of the British POWs and Singaporean civilians in Changi jail and beyond after the Japanese conquest. It lists all the regiments involved and has display cases for each stage of the occupation with many personal accounts. There is a comprehensive library of this period of Singapore's history plus a very well-stocked bookshop. If you are interested in finding out about a specific person, there are books / lists in the library detailing all the occupants of the jail, both military and civilian."
,,WW2 History in Singapore,5.0,,"We visited Changi Museum during our trip to Singapore. We came here after we had done the Battle Box tour at Fort Canning which I would recommend to do first before coming here. It is a little bit of a trip to get here we had to get the MRT for 20 minutes then catch a taxi for another ten minutes but it is worth the trip. We opted to get the audio tour for $8 which is definitely worth it as it explains the exhibits really well. A great museum with lots of historical artifacts on display. It takes about an hour to complete the tour with the audio, worth the time though as you learn quite a lot. After the tour you can have a look at the replica chapel and also have the opportunity to light a candle in remembrance.

There is a nice little cafe out the back of the museum where you can grab lunch and something to drink which was nice to escape the heat for a bit."
,,Eye opening and educational,4.0,,"Every Wednesday and Saturday, the museum offers “war trail tours”, which takes you to key sites from the war.
They also offer “audio tours” which is what we did.
Sharing a head set, you are guided through a timeline of displays which had photos and materials/objects which held meaning from the war period. The head set spoke about each period of time and what events occurred, as well as heart wrenching stories told by people who lived through the war.
This museum is a must-do! It is educational and interesting, and the audio tour really gives you a personal account into life during WWII."
,,Interesting,5.0,,Changi Musuem is quite small but so interesting. We had the earphone commentary at a small cost but worth it. We decided to go on the way to the airport and allowed a few hours as we had lunch at the cafe next to the museum. Staff were very accommodating.
,,Changi Museum another must do,5.0,,"We wanted to visit Changi Museum as my father was captured at the fall of Singapore and endured horrendous conditions and cruelty under the Japanese for 3 1/2 years as he built the infamous railway.
The first thing to mention is the old gates and main wall to the old prison are still there but everything else way demolished to make way for the new prison.
We asked our taxi driver to take us as near to the old area as possible and he did so going right around the perimeter fence where you can also see the tops of the old gates from the rear of the new prison. Take a zoom lense with you for better pictures.
We then went into the museum which is full of facts and memorabilia from that period. You can also take a headset tour.
Being of such interest we we're there for ages reading all the information and looking at the books at the end. We learnt a lot about my father's incarceration which he would NEVER talk about.
If you are interested in the military history or have a relative who suffered here you must pay a visit. Read the messages left in the Chapel too.
From the centre of Singapore where I assume most people's hotel will be take a taxi as the MTR doesn't go near enough.
To get home simply ask the museum staff or lovely cafe people on site to order you one.
Everyone is so helpful in Singapore!"
,,More a Memorial than a Museum,5.0,,"Very sobering. A story I knew well, but very emotional being on the ground and in the space. To be taken in with respect and reflection. Not to be missed. All Australian's visiting Singapore should take a few hours to absorb this experience. Free but spend the extra for the audio tour."
,,Very Moving,5.0,,Was a prilgrimage as both our fathers were in the war and my wife's father was in Changi prison. Very sad but makes you appreciate the stupidity of war.
,,Moving,5.0,,"All Australians need to visit this museum, make sure you pay the $12 to share the audio tour, well worth the money.
We caught a local bus out there ( just ask the driver to stop for you cos the museum is a bit hard to see)
Afterwards we went back to the bus top & went on to Changi Village, where we walked around the beach & had a meal in the excellent hawker food centre. We then caught the bus back to the city ( from memory it was a no 2 bus but look it up)
Don't bother with an organised ""tour"" very easy to do yourself & subsequently at your own pace."
,,Thought provoking museum,5.0,,The Changi Museum is a really thought provoking place that makes you realize just how much the people of Singapore suffered during the Japanese occupation of Singapore.. My husband & myself were both tearful while seeing & hearing how traumatic it must have been during this most difficult time. It really is worth a visit.
,,Experience the truth of the Japanese Occupation in Singapore,5.0,,For the best and most genuine showcase of WW2 in Singapore. It may have been small but it is undeniably the most soul wreaking museum in Singapore. Experience the truth of the Japanese Occupation in Singapore.
,,Worth a trip if you are a history buff,4.0,,"Entry to the museum is free, and its $8 for a self guided audio tour.
Having grown up with the history, it is always interesting to hear about it again (as opposed to studying it) and learn about life under the Japanese. The defenders of Singapore - Chinese, Indians, Malays, and also a lot of Australians, are really to be proud of, and unfortunately you also feel for the suffering they experienced as well as how resourceful they can be."
,,Pilgrimage to Changi,5.0,,This was a must do when we were in Singapore as my wife's Grandfather had been imprisoned in Changi during the Second World War. The audio tour was comprehensive and the articles on display added to the experience. Overall it was a very moving experience.
,,Changi WW11 War Trail and Museum Tour,5.0,,"Our guide Eleanor ( apologies not absolutely sure) was one of the best travel guides I have had the pleasure to experience. She shared her wealth of knowledge and passion with this history in an enthralling, sensitive and fascinating manner.
History buffs will love this tour. Our group of seven totally were blown away with her story telling and clarity of language.
Thank you!!!"
,,A well done trip into history,5.0,,"We bought some friends to see the museum who were interested in the history of Changi and that period of the war. We were very impressed by the wonderful displays and story boards. There is an audio guide, but we didn't use it. It is all very easy and simple to follow, so children would also enjoy it. It was very moving seeing the terrible existence inside Changi and knowing how many lives were lost. But is also shows the wonderful resilience of the men, women and children through that time and bought out the best in people.
Hats off to the people who put this together and who maintain and run it free of charge. Thank you for giving us a look into the sad history around that time."
,,Interesting....,4.0,,"My Husband is a massive History buff, I am not, in saying that I quiet enjoyed the Changi Museum. It is very informative, while a bit sad to think that everything you read about there happened.

I would recommend paying a visit if you have done the battle box and the Old Ford Factory first."
,,75 years of History,4.0,,Great museum and Singapore is marking the 75th anniversary of WWI for them and the surrender to Japan. Lots of great history to see around Singapore.
,,Moving Experience,5.0,,"My family of four spent a couple of hours at the Chapel and Museum. We hired a Grab taxi from Singapore and back (20 minutes and 19SGD each way). We found the Chapel and Museum to be a very moving experience learning about the hardships of the camps during WW2. Free entry but definitely worth paying for an audio tour, which brings the displays to life."
,,Legacy,3.0,,"I came here as a promise to a friend. The place is free you do pay for the Audio. the complex is not big at all, it is surrounded by Changi Airport and the Mens prison. You are not allowed to take photos inside the Museum, not too sure why as there is not much in there to photograph, but you are allowed to take photos of the Chapel, make a donation or say prayers. As an Australian this is somewhat a significant place for me. The Cafe next door was nearly bigger than the Museum and the charges for coffee and food was too much. Obviously take full advantage of the pilgrims."
,,Deserves far higher than #19,5.0,,"Having known people or had family who fought in the war, seeing this memory was very touching. It personalises the tragedies far better than the European museums because it does not try to sensationalise anything, nor is there a political message. If you want to see what Southeast Asia experienced during the second world war, this is the place to visit."
,,"Second visit, still as moving",5.0,,"I visited this two years ago with teen no 1 so was pretty familiar with the displays but was still incredibly moved visiting a second time with teen number 2.

It was interesting just watching him move at his own speed.. He (15) is not normally big on reading museum information boxes, he just tends to move at a fairly rapid pace through museums, stopping at whatever catches his eye however he read pretty much every display box and was quite quiet and reserved afterwards. I could tell he was just processing it and needed time to take it all in, even though he did have a basic understanding of the story before going . The Individual tales moved him.

This is a must see for anyone interested in war history and certainly for any Australians because of the strong link to our war story. Its a bit tricky to get out there so we took a taxi to get there and then bus and metro home."
,,A Superb Display,5.0,,I already had a good general knowledge of what happened during 1942-45 but became even more aware of various events showing the best and worst aspects of mankind.
,,Worth a visit but,4.0,,"We caught the bus here from Singapore about 45 mins it sits next to the current prison unfortunately the original prison was torn down to make way for a new prison . We did the audio guide which is well worth it , it's not very big so even reading everything will only need a few hours .it seems fairly sanitised having read much on the subject the behaviour of the Japanese was not really explored in any detail.i felt it could have been much better but still worth a day out of our holidays, as an aside the cafe next door charged me the most expensive coffee I've had in my life a double shot cappuccino was S $12.00 and a 1 inch wedge of cake was $10.00 , after a heated exchange the cost was adjusted , just be super cautious before ordering"
,,A Sobering Must-See,5.0,,"This small WW2 memorial museum nearby the Changi prison complex - with an adjourning chapel, never ceases to sober one up in every visit - with its excellently curated photographs, sketches, various poignant memorabilia of ex-POWs; including the restored wall murals touchingly painted by an Australian ex-POW; recounting the sufferings of many nationalities defending this country during the War. Very nostalgic place especially for the older generation, including the British, Australians, and Indians, who fought and sacrificed here. A British chaplain having served here with the British Forces made a trip there with me, wrote to say it was a 'special highlight' of his 'last' visit here, as he is now in his 80s. And there - isn't that a photo of what my dad used to tell me about when I was younger - that rice was so scarce locals had to pick them off the streets in order to survive? - I now tell my son. Free of charge. Nearest MRT station is the Expo station or Changi Airport station - a 1.5 to 2 hrs' visit suffice."
,,tour east tour of Changi,5.0,,"we booked a tour of Changi thru tour east but it was a bit disappointing. We were only given a short time at Changi itself, not long enough to hire the headsets and go thru the whole museum. The museum itself is excellent but better value would be to take a taxi there and do the visit in your own time. You need at least an hour to thoroughly listen to all the commentary."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"We wanted to see this museum which is quite close to the present day prison. It recounts the history of Singapore before and after the Japanese invasion. It shows what life was like for the prisoners and supported with pictures, models and even quilts. A must for historians."
,,Quick visit on our stopover,5.0,,"Really interesting place, definitely worthwhile doing the audio tour. Maintained our children's interest, which is not something we can say for every museum."
,,I'm glad it's there,3.0,,"I'm glad there is a memorial in Changi, but I'd only go if you already know the history first. There was no sense of place. The memorial is not located at any significant point - there were several camp sites and this isn't one of them. The displays mention various locations, but there is no map to show where they all are. There was also no clear narrative that pulled the story together, just individual units in the interpretive displays. There are some mural reproductions, but otherwise, not much that you wouldn't appreciate just by reading a book. I was happy to pay for the audio tour as the museum itself is free, but I probably would have got as much from just reading the information around the displays. The audio book did give the 'voice' of the people involved. I also enjoyed the bus journey out to the area (and past the current goal)."
,,Interesting,5.0,,"Lot of educational info on the history of Changi through the 20th century and military themes. Displays of original items from WW2. Recreation of the Chapel from block 151 and the Changi murals. It is not possible to visit block 151 or see the originals as it is under the management of the current Singapore military in an active camp. You can have an audio tour, guided tour or just walk around at your own pace. Free entry. Good selection of books on sale."
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,"I visited the museum after the Battlebox tour and it proved a great combination. The museum is close to Changi airport (just $9 in a taxi) and public transport will also get you there. Entry us free and the $8 audio guide is worth purchasing. The displays are fascinating and moving, providing insight into the personal experiences of the people as well as the soldiers during the Japanese occupation. The staff are very friendly and helpful."
,,Interesting museum,3.0,,I found the museum interesting but unfortunately it was a part of a guided tour and the woman leading it was extremely long winded. I would have preferred to have wandered around by myself so I could have absorbed more of the exhibits.
,,"Very moving, and very well done",5.0,,"We visited Changi on a half day Hippo tour and spent just over an hour here ... which was just about right.
The detailed history, and the prisoner accounts of their internment was interesting, sad, and very moving. It gave me a much greater understanding of the pain the military (on both sides) and the local people went through at the hands of the Japanese.
Well worth a visit."
,,Changi half day tour - Journeys Pty Ltd - Happy Travels,5.0,,Helena was an absolutely wonderful tour leader; passionate and superbly informative! Thank you for an eye opening excursion. Warren and Elin (Brisbane)
,,Interesting,5.0,,"Walking through the museum gave us an insight to conditions and stories about the war & POW camps. While it was very sad, it is a reminder of the sacrifices that those people gave. Very memorable !!"
,,"A Gem, Will Worth the Time",5.0,,"Changi Prison, built by the British in the 1930s, was then used by the Japanese during WWII to imprison many POWs who received very harsh treatment and degradation. The tour takes you through Block 151 which has on exhibit murals painted by Stanley Warren, a prisoner during the war. The murals themselves attest to the spirits which rose above the degradation, and is worth the small admission fee and time spent at the museum. The construction of the facilities points to the importance the British placed on Singapore. Highly recommended."
,,very interesting,4.0,,"To anyone who has an interest in world war 2 will find the museum interesting.informative display of acounts from POWs to the japanese and the fall of singaporeI,Audio tours are available we spent probably just over 2hrs here and there is also a shop [ the lady behind the counter was friendly and im the guy who bought the print from you ] where you can buy books on the subject. Easy to get there we took the MRT from city hall tampines and then the bus no 29"
,,Very Moving,5.0,,"We caught the MRT and bus to the museum which was just across the road from the bus stop. Very moving to read about the treatment of the prisoners and listen to the audio guide of what happened at the time. Visiting the chapel and seeing photos of soldiers who perished in the jail was very emotional.
Admission is free. However there is a charge for the audio.
Well worth a visit if you are into the history of WW2 and Singapore."
,,Thought Provocking,4.0,,This is really confronting and must be challenging to those who are in their more senior years of 70 plus. It is real and presented in real time. It is poignant and sobering. Not really suitable for young children who are not cognisant of the history.
,,Excellent Tour and Guide,5.0,,My Husband and I did this tour on the 09/09/2017 after arriving at the wrong start point the helpful staff were quick to get us picked up and on our way. Our tour guide was Jao Ling ( I apologise if this is spelt incorrect) she was so informative knowledgeable respectful and passionate in her delivery of knowledge and history of the Changi WW11 Museum. My Grandad was a POW in Changi so it gave me a some insight as to what he endured and actually unfolded in Singapore.I highly recommend this tour
,,Very Interesting!,4.0,,"Anyone that has an interest in history aspect of World War 2 will find the Museum interesting to visit. Entry is free however there is a cost to hire the headsets. But you can take enough information out of the visit by just reading the displays. Reading about some of the atrocities can be confronting at times and reminds you why there should be no wars in this mixed up world of ours! The little gift shop has a great selection of books too! We caught a taxi from our hotel. After your visit if you cross the road to the bus stop opposite the museum, you can catch a bus to Changi Village and enjoy a meal at one of the many restaurants or hawker stalls."
,,"Worth a visit, great audio tour.",4.0,,"I knew a very minimal amount about Changi, but after taking the audio tour, I was absolutely moved in respect to the details of hardship. The museum is well worth a visit and is about a 25min cab ride from the CBD."
,,Distressing experience,3.0,,"This was really distressing. I could not leave quick enough. In retrospect I should probably not have gone. I had grown up hearing the stories of this time, from when my parents lived in Singapore in the 60s, but being confronted with it was a different matter and I found it overwhelming. I left in tears. Unkindness and inhumanity on such a scale with many awful details is just too much to take in for some people. I think it is important we know and do not forget yet at the same time in reality it can be very hard to take in and place yourself in the shoes of those who suffered. So I could not stay long or take everything in.
I took a taxi there from Changi Village having been assured a taxi back would be easy to find. It wasn't. The nearby road is solely residential and with the prison nearby it is not exactly taxi cruising central. The museum Visitor staff were incredibly kind and called a taxi for me after I had waited around on the off chance for one for some time, but of course you then have to pay a booking fee. So, if on your own be aware of this and make sure you have transport there and back.
Think carefully before going too about the emotional impact it will have on you and make sure you are up to it. I certainly wasn't."
,,Captivating Changi,5.0,,The museum is easy to get to by public transport. Just take the MRT to Tampines and walk through to the bus terminal where you catch bus no. 29. The terminal is well signposted and the bus queues are very clearly signposted. This museum is very interesting and tells the story of Singapore over the years. Definitely the place to go if you are interested in the history of Singapore.
,,A moving experience,5.0,,"We should all visit this museum - so we NEVER can repeat the atrocities of war again. It was humbling and very moving to hear the stories of so many who were there, but also to witness the undaunted human spirit, the inventiveness, the camaraderie and the sheer willpower that pulled so many through."
,,Very Sobering,4.0,,"It was never our intention to visit this museum, but we are glad we did! On this journey our intention was to visit the island of Pulau Ubin, but when we arrived at the ferry terminal the queues were massive ( it was a long weekend) We worked out it would take over an our to get on a boat, so we quickly came up with another plan. We had seen the Changi Museum from the bus on the way, so we decided to go there for a visit. We opted for the audio guide, which really enhanced our visit. The display was quite ""old style"" without any ""whizz bang"" technology, but given the subject matter of extreme cruelty, hardship and adversity it was more than suitable. After listening to the audio and looking at the displays you come away with such mixed feelings of admiration for the POW's strength of character, sorrow for their treatment and frustration that humanity still has not learned from the past. To get to the museum from Orchard Road we took the MRT and a bus and found it very easy ( we come from a country town without public transport- if we can do it anyone can) Some of the MRT journey was above ground and combined with the bus trip made the journey itself very interesting"
,,How did they survive!!!!,5.0,,Not easy to reach but worth the effort. Conducted tours and audio tours available. A great insight into the war and the role of Singapore. Hard to leave with a dry eye
,,For those that are interested only.,3.0,,While the operators have made a valiant attempt to capture the story of Changi its difficult to get a true perspective given the museum is not located at the original site. So if you are expecting a visit to the prison this won't be the case. The information is interesting and moving but some more creative displays and information would improve the experience and give it greater weight.
,,A recollection of memories of my time at RAF HOSPITAL CHANGI in the early 1970's very emotional,5.0,,"I visited this and other sites in connection with the Japanese conquest and occupation of Singapore 1042-1945, not our finest moment.... I heartily recommend a visit here"
,,Out of the way but interesting,4.0,,"Great informative display of the accounts from POWs and the fall of Singapore to the Japanese. Much of the story is told by quotes or excerpts from POW journals or writings, which gives a unique insight into the war rather than just reeling off facts and history.

If you prefer being spoon fed facts and history, battle box/national museum is more for you.

Also, it is quite out of the way. I did this on the way back from cycling around Pulao Ubin but feel if I had made the special trip here I'd be a by disappointed. It is essentially only 2-3 exhibit rooms, most of which is reading.

A nice free attraction you can expect to spend about an hour here."
,,You must vist!!!! An imprresive part of Singapore history,5.0,,"After one of the most important defeats of the British Empire, the Japanese invasion of Singapore by 1942, British, Indian, Australian,...soldiers were confined in Changi Prison until the end of war, August 1945. I recommend to you, from the bottom of my heart, reading the letters from the realtives of the prisoners. Get the audioguide.
It's far from touristic routes, but it worths. If you have enough time, take tour from the museum and visit unexplored areas."
,,A focus on the POW experience,4.0,,"This Museum is well worth a visit for anyone interested in the World War II prisoner of war experience in Singapore.

It's about a 20 min taxi ride from the city to the location which is not far from the airport.

The museum has an older style presentation and a strong focus on the prisoner of war experience (rather than the history of World War II).

Some very moving exhibits reminding one about the cruelty of war and the misery of defeat."
,,Important site - slightly disappointing,3.0,,"Eventually got to visit Changi POW museum and chapel - if I was visiting Singapore for just a few days I would not recommend the visit. It's a bit of a trip to get here compared to the many other attractions and anyone interested enough would probably know most of the information on display. That said it's a good display and audio guides very good. There is no real attempt to explain the site or what the layout was etc. It's pretty much a single gallery covering the prisons origins, fall of Singapore, POW and civilian internment. Quite a nice restaurant attached but only selling western food.

Anyone really interested in the the fall of Singapore, and the Japanese occupation would get more from visiting the Singapore national museum and the battle box both at Fort Canning and easy to do back to back."
,,Insightful museum filled with fascinating history,5.0,,We visited Changi museum on the referral of friends and family in England and we were not disappointed. One of the few tourist attractions with historic background we were pleasantly surprised at the size and quality of the museum especially given its free entry. Taxis were cheap from the city and we would throughly recommend!
,,OK but a bit superficial,3.0,,"I have always wanted to see this exhibit but was a bit disappointed. It's mostly pictures on the wall with minimal explanation, and rather crude ""recreations"" of the mirals and chapels in the Changi camp. OK if you have a personal connection, but th Museum of Singapore in the city is much more informative about the whole WW2 events."
,,A must do,5.0,,"This was the first place we visited in Singapore. I found it good to understand the city's history and how they have rebuilt since WW2. As Australians it was a moving and humbling experience. I certainly learnt a lot that I didn't know beforehand. The audio tour is a must. With free entry and only $8 to hire the headphones it's worth doing to get the most out of your visit.

We caught a taxi there and back and that was fine. Guest services at the museum were so helpful in organising a return taxi for us. Highly recommend a visit and not just for the history enthusiasts!"
,,Extremely Moving,5.0,,"For Australians visiting Singapore, a trip to the Changi Museum is a must. Find out what happened to Australia troops as well as to the locals when Singapore was invaded by the Japanese. A bit of very real and very important history."
,,Very moving tribute,3.0,,"We didn't pay the extra for the audio tour which in hindsight we should have as other people who did said it was great.
There was a lot of reading involved which was difficult for my dad as his eyesight isn't so great.
The tour was very moving and there were a lot of really interesting artifacts. A must for anyone interested in history."
,,A must place to visit,5.0,,"We missed this last visit so was a must this time. A great museum to get the local history of the hard times during the Japanese invasion of WW11. The hire of the audio is a must to help understand the hardships suffered, with some great commentary from people who were there. Easy to follow with very helpful staff along the way. Great little gift shop on the way out. Very well worth the visit and would highly recommend to all visitors coming to Singapore."
,,Reflective,5.0,,If you want to understand where Singapore has come from then I advise to visit this museum and get a full understanding g if the history. Had me in tears at times.
,,Sobering,5.0,,"Well recommended as a free of charge activity to learn about the WW2 history of Singapore. Plenty of public buses right to the entrance makes it an easy place to visit. Best to be combined with a visit to the great hawker area at Changi Village or the Changi Beach area, both only 5 minutes further on the bus."
,,Interesting museum,5.0,,A small museum out near Changi airport. Free entry but paid for the audio guide which gives a greater insight. Good overview of the lead up to Singapores surrender and the first hand accounts about occupation etc
,,Gorgeous place to learn,5.0,,teh changi chapel is there they have a cafe which has great pizza very educational and free for all great place to spend an afternoon or just a few hours to read it all
,,Peaceful place to reflect,5.0,,I highly recommend visiting Changi Museum & Chapel when visiting Singapore. It is easily accessed by taxi that does not cost much. I did not take up the audio tour preferring to read the displays which included very moving first hand accounts of life under Japanese occupation. It is a quiet place for reflection and well worth a visit.
,,Reflective,5.0,,"We visited this small, but interesting museum independently. It was well worthwhile despite not being heavily promoted. High percentage of Australian visitors- probably due to its relevance to history of Australia in WW2. Take time to read and reflect."
,,Interesting sad place to visit,5.0,,So cheap to enter but I recommend you pay or the headset for your walk through the exhibit. No photos to be taken which is understandable. It's very sad to see how the POW's and local people were treated by the Japanese a must see if you are visiting Singapore.
,,Take your time to read the words at each exhibit and reflect on Changi history,4.0,,We visited the Changi Museum as part of a day tour around Singapore. Only the front wall of the WW2 prison remains at its original (different site). The museum has some excellent displays and quite detailed stories of what occurred during WW2 in and around Changi Prison. It is sombre story as the conditions imposed by the Japanese were brutal. How anyone survived the prison is a minor miracle. The Ingenuity and durability of the prisoners was incredible. There is a small gift shop at the site. Well worth a visit.
,,Interesting Museum,5.0,,"Took bus 2 from Tahah Merah MRT from China Town, however on way back took Bus 29 to Tampines MRT ,as shorter wait time. I new some of the history surrounding this time however I was unaware that women and children were interned. The quilt on display and the audio attached, moving. Audio tour well worth it @ SG$8, gave more insight into the displays. No entrance fee. As Aussie soldiers POW a must see, in my opinion."
,,Audio tour is a must,5.0,,Bus 2 from Tanah Merah MRT will get you here. Takes 1-1.5 h total journey time from downtown Singapore. Aim to spend 2-3 hours here and definitely take the audio tour ($8). The museum is small in size but there is a lot to read and take in. The exhibition is all about the Japanese occupation years in Singapore and the Changi camp. A very moving experience. I would thoroughly recommend a visit.
,,Humbling history lesson,4.0,,"As a fan of all historical, it was a very humbling perspective and new understanding created by the self-guided tour and great exhibits and personal stories about the Singaporean experience during World War II. The facility and exhibits are both personal and poignant and offer a localized view of events that many may not have awareness of outside of Asia. It was a great visit to the past and worth the time to visit this terrific museum."
,,A respectful museum about the History,5.0,,"It has more information and interviews recorded in the audio guide, that helps us to understand more and easily about the display in the museum. I do appreciate the mini art room display about the history of it."
,,A must see in Singapore!,5.0,,Such a sad place but all Australian should visit to understand what took place. Getting there is a little difficult and involved a couple of buses (and lots of confusion) but eventually found it.
,,History lesson for all,5.0,,The presentation of such sobering events during the Occupation of Singapore during WW2 is very sensitively done but a very real lesson of the harshness and bruitality of war.
,,Everyone should visit the Museum,5.0,,"Despite numerous trips to Singapore I had never visited the Changi Museum before. It is a must-see! It provides a insight to how the British, Australian, New Zealand etc prisoners-of-war were treated by the Japanese occupation forces, as well as some history of how local Singaporeans were also mistreated, and their bravery at attempting to make things easier for POWs. It's not a big museum but is worth taking the time to look at the photos and read the stories."
,,Very interesting museum,5.0,,"A small museum very well done. A little bit out of the way but well worth the time taken to get there. Free to enter, you can pay for the audio tour which was excellent. A great and moving insight into the history of Singapore and the suffering of the allied forces and those interred during WW2."
,,Well done but sad,4.0,,"A moving, emotional but important museum for Australians, New Zealanders and British to visit, but also I was unaware how many Indians were interred. The personal accounts were very moving."
,,Sombre and tasteful memorial,4.0,,"Well put together sequence of how the Japanese treated especially westerners after the surrender in 1942. Leaves little to the imagination, and details many heroic acts. Not at original prison site, and really a museum of newspapers etc. Lovely temple/church, with many moving messages. $25 taxi best way from city - not easy to get a taxi back, so beware."
,,Great Insight to the Role of Changi Prison during the Japanese Occupation,5.0,,"The Changi Museum is located a few miles west of Changi village. To get there, take the East West MRT line to Tanah Merah station and then bus number 2 to the museum.

Although there is an audio guide, there is plenty of information to read to last several hours. There was some interesting art produced by some of the inmates, and the murals in the chapel by Stanley Warren were very touching.

Coupled with the Battlebox and the displays at the Ford Motor Factory, a very comprehensive view of Singapore before, during and after the Second World War is portrayed.

Admission is free and refreshments are available on site."
,,An emotional experience,5.0,,We had a tour guide us through the Changi Museum which was excellent & helped us understand what happened there. Very sad to hear what the prisoners experienced. I am pleased we visited the Museum.
,,Informative,5.0,,The Changi Museum is well worth a visit. We shared an audio tour which was very informative. It is very sobering to learn more about life in Singapore after the surrender.
,,"Poignant, sad, inspiring and highly informative",5.0,,"My husband, myself and our two teenage sons, 16 & 18, took a taxi out to the Changi Museum, situated near Changi Prison. It is not a big museum but it contains a lot of information and historical memorabilia that is very well presented and maintained. Entry is free but I strongly recommend that visitors hire an audioguide, excellent value at $8 and you will get so much more out of your visit. Our family spent 2 hours looking at all the displays and listening to the audioguide, we learnt a great deal about the invasion of Singapore by the Japanese in WWII and what life was like for the expats and locals who suffered greatly during the Japanese occupation. You can also see full-size replicas of the Changi biblical murals painted by a British POW."
,,An important story which demands to be heard...,4.0,,"With the destruction of the original Changi prison, the small and rather isolated site of the this museum looks initially unpromising. It is small but perfectly formed however, and evokes extremely well the harrowing capture, appalling treatment of, and incredible endurance and innovation of those captured in Singapore and held and Changi and in other Japanese camps. The audio tour is a vital addition, and does direct you to key exhibits - but it leaves plenty of time to read and look at the displays. There is far more to see than is covered on the audio tour, which has about 19 stations.
I've been on two occasions, three years apart, and apart from a reconfigured entrance desk, there did not seem to be much development of the museum. The story of the fall of Singapore stands by itself, of course, and this museum is focused very much on the human story - human suffering, human cruelty, but above all the triumph of the human spirit. The creativity and inventiveness of the captured soldiers is amazing; the compassion shown to them by others who helped, the extraordinary bravery and endurance of the prisoners - all are remarkable. But having said that, the stories - and the collection of artefacts - could perhaps be brought to life more vividly, by exploiting some of the innovations in museums and curatorship that now exist.
The shop is a missed opportunity, for example, and should contain far more educative material, for people who want to read, or learn more about the experiences of Changi. There is a small research area, but on both occasions I have visited it has had no use."
,,changi museum,5.0,,"What a sobering place to visit and the treatment of prisoners during the war. Well worth the visit and take the time to read the boards. One of the few free places to enter, you can get a guide or get headphones but we chose to read it ourselves and do at our leisure."
,,"History dictated very well, worth viewing.",5.0,,"You are given headphones with a recorded tour, so you can view at your leisure at each station. They have documented extremely well and photos/artifacts are of abundance to really illustrate the timeline of the war the Singaporeans went through from the Japanese. Makes you appreciate that war is a terrible place to be when you are not living under threat."
,,Lest we forget,4.0,,Harrowing and unsettling allow at least and hour and a half to go around this small well kept museum. I would recommend the audio tour. Consider doing after a tour of the Battlebox in Fort Canning so that you experience those dark days from those that lived through them.
,,Very moving experience,5.0,,"A cathartic experience and one not to miss if in Singapore. Easy to get to on public transport, but be prepared to spend 3-4 hours taking in the experience. Recommend paying the $8 for the audio tour...it provides first-hand experiences from the locals caught in the occupation."
,,Informative Tour,4.0,,Our guide Uina was brilliant. Her knowledge and passion about the war was excellent and provided a great insight to the Japanese invasion. A little disappointing that there is only one wall left from the prison so nothing to see there. The museum is small but interesting.
,,Moving experience of a dark time in history,5.0,,"An interesting and informative look into the modern history of Singapore. The audio tour was well worth the small cost. The museum is small and the story was moving but it was easy to spend a couple of hours here just looking at all of the exhibits.
It is an easy place to find using the MRT (train and bus) and the surrounding area showed another side of Singapore, with fewer high rise apartment blocks.
Highly recommended next time you are in Singapore."
,,Thought creating,4.0,,"Small but well defined and labelled.
Contains a lot of information that might not be known to all.
This was stories that in England of the fifteis but I am not sure how much is known today
The bus stops outside but check the area.
The restaurant in my mind is a bit jarring"
,,Small but interesting,4.0,,"The audio tour is a must, it highlights the plight of not just the military pow's but gives a great and thought provoking insight into the other POWs, local Singaporean Chinese, women and children. Was checking on a relative that was a POW during WWII, and the staff were extremely helpful taking time to answer queries and research answers. Easy to get to using MRT and bus service for a different experience."
,,Quite harrowing but excellent,5.0,,We 'enjoyed' the museum even though its content was quite hard to stomach at times due to the nature of the museum I.e. Japanese occupation during WWII. I enough highly recommend hiring audio players for a tour as you get more info that way.
,,Very well done,4.0,,"We were on a day tour that included a visit here. It's a small museum, well laid out and run. It tells the story in a way that doesn't pull any punches, but isn't inordinately confronting.
Spend 20 minutes here or 3 hours, it's up to you how much you want to take in, you'll find it time well spent.
Well worth the visit."
,,Changi Museum,5.0,,"Went yesterday with Helena , who was extremely informative and passionate about sharing this part of Singapore's history. Imagine my surprise when I saw a photo of my darling father when he was a POW at Changi. Very moving for me and honoured by Helena. A must for understanding so much more about Singapore's history."
,,"Important historically, sobering and well worth visiting",4.0,,"This is a sad place to visit in many ways, learning the history of what happened to those who suffered during the war, but we must learn from our history and remember our past so that we don't make the same mistakes again, well worth a visit, take the audio-tour that you have to pay for, you'll get much more out of your visit if you do."
,,A moving and reflective place to visit,5.0,,"We spent a morning at the Museum, and were very pleased we made the effort (it is a little off the tourist beaten track!). Lots to read, but we would recommend you take the audio tour as well, as there are interviews of some people who were actually imprisoned and lived through the experience - very moving. We would highly recommend Changi Museum to other visitors."
,,The Changi Museum,5.0,,"A wonderful memorial to the Singaporean people and the soldiers who fought and died in World War 2. Allow time to do the audio tour, to look at, read and see everything and take tissues. A very solemn but educational experience."
,,"An essential part of the ""Singapore Story""",5.0,,"As an Australian, it's hard to miss the stories of the Pacific theatre of WW2, particularly the Fall of Singapore and - to quote a history teacher of mine - ""The horrors of Changi"". Despite having visited Singapore a couple of times, I'd never quite had the chance to get out this far and see the museum.
My wife and I were able to join a bus tour operated by Singapore Walks, which is highly recommended as it put things into the appropriate context. The museum itself is quite small, but contains more than its fair share of important stories and reminders about this particularly dark time.

Other reviews have commented on the fact that a number of things (including the famous frescoes and the Chapel itself) are reproductions. A lot of this is due to souvenir-hunting - by my home country, in the case of the Chapel! - and the fact that Changi Prison itself is still a working maximum-security prison to this day, and that expansion of that structure has meant that some of the site has been taken over by the prison. To expect the staff of a maximum-security prison to let tourists traipse through and take photos is just silly, and frankly I was surprised when our guide told us that this had been the case during the 1980s.

As well as containing a lot of information about man's inhumanity to man, the museum also has some genuinely moving stories about the human spirit. The background to the photo of the smiling POW is startling, as are the stories behind the ""Two malarias and a cholera"" sketch and the frescoes. Additionally, it does a good job of debunking the ""guns were aiming in the wrong direction"" myth - the defences of Singapore weren't solely aimed at the Straits by any means, although their utility for an inland invasion was limited.

This is a sad place, most assuredly, and the recommendation from our guide that ""a dinner with alcohol"" would be a good antidote to the stories was well-received, but the history of the last century isn't just about sweetness and light by any means."
,,Very moving and informative,5.0,,We purchased the audio tour and caught the bus to Changi Museum - very moving and great history and detail - congratulations to the volunteers who run it.
,,Grandfather History Interest,5.0,,"Free entry, very helpful staff, informative records. The displays and written detail while gut wrenching was very informative. I took some photos along and the staff were very helpful in identifying landmarks where my Grandfather had visited before his capture. Historical books available for purchase. Cafe next door with free wifi."
,,moving and informative,5.0,,"Easy to get to by bus - not for small children, very informative and moving, a great tribute to those lost during the war - military and civilian alike."
,,Can be heart rendering,5.0,,Not a large museum but with the photos and explanations of what happened in this war prison is very moving and breaks your heart.
,,Very touching,4.0,,"I find it very hard to critique the Changi Museum and do it the justice it deserves. This is a very solemn place sharing many horrific memories of the victims of the atrocities committed by their captors.
I feel that there is a separation between what happened during World War II and the present and does not try and blame current generations for the sins of the past."
,,Very Moving Experience,5.0,,An extremely interesting museum full of good exhibits and very moving stories of an awful time in Singapore's history. I would recommend making your own way there (the public transport system is fantastic and easy to use) so you are not limited by time which could happen if you were on an organised tour. Entry to the museum is free but paying the $8 for the audio tour is well worth it.
,,Much to think about...,4.0,,"We travelled here by bus, very easy and cheap (No2 from Chinatown to opposite the attraction).
It was surprisingly small but packed a punch...
It was very cleverly done; we did not use a guide or the audio (you only pay if you use either of these services); we read the information both of us found it challenging and thought provoking. It is a must do to understand what Singapore went through at that time.
The copies of the chapel murals are outstanding as is the copy of one of the quilts made by the women. The embroidery of the names to be given to the men so that they knew who was there was inspirational way of communicating."
,,a sobering reminder,4.0,,"I had visited the changi prison museum many years ago which was a very moving experience, whilst this experience was a sobering reminder for everybody about the tragedy of war, probably not as good as they original"
,,Emotional Place to Visit,4.0,,"The museum is well set out and easy to visit. Although not huge it will take at least an hour to go through and view all the exhibits.
The place is somber and will evoke emotion even from the toughest. We owe the serviceman of WWII very much gratitude indeed."
,,Educating but sobering,5.0,,"We learnt a lot during our visit to the Changi Museum. I knew a little of the history of Singapore during WWII but this was a great way to gain a better understanding. It was very interesting but also very sobering, especially listening to the stories of some of the survivors, spoken in their own words.

Highly recommend a visit here if you are at all interested in history, and even if you're not!"
,,Trip Advisor Changi Museum POW Tour not worth $60 per person,4.0,,"Went on the Trip Advisor Changi Museum POW Tour at $60 per person. This was not value for money. Even though the Tour Guide advised us that she had been doing this for the past 16 years I was disappointed that she did not tailor the tour towards Australians as 98% of the tour participants were Australian with two Americans. It would have been better to just get ourselves to the museum and walk around the venue to read and look at the pictures. My Aunty who I attended with was connected to the history of the museum as her father was an Australian who was incarcerated in Changi for 3.5 years. This was supposed to be a moving experience for her to undertake, but the experience was not as we expected it to be.

Having the tour guide drone on for ages almost reciting word for word what was on show was a bit boring. As well as handing out laminated pictures. A suggestion would be for the buses to have a TV in them and provide an interesting slide show or short movie while you are on the bus. It is a very interesting place and in reality the tour guide should have given us background information that is not included in the museum. I was also surprised at how small the museum was. It is certainly not worth $60 per person."
,,"An important, but disappointing reminder of horror of Changi.",2.0,,"There's very little of the original prison to see here. It's not even on the same site. In short it's not Changi. Yes there are a few pieces of original memorabilia but don't expect to see actual buildings or cells (although there is a cell door and a uniform or two). Considering the numbers of civilians and service personnel who were starved, beaten or killed in Changi this is a very underdone memorial. Personally I think they deserve better than this.

The whole disastrous story is painstakingly spelt out but it's done with amateurish graphics and fuzzy photo reproductions.

I'm sure the volunteers who run it do so with the best intentions but really there's just not enough of the real Changi to make this a 'must visit' location. And the difficulty of reaching it with public transport just makes it more of a let down. There has to some way of marking this important and tragic event but this isn't it."
,,Well worth the effort,5.0,,This is a humble and profound retelling of a significant event in Singapore's and many other nations history. The cab ride is perhaps 25 min but only cost $18. Highly recommend it.
,,A long way to travel....,3.0,,"Travelled out to the Changi Museum from central Singapore via MRT and bus, took the best part of 50 minutes (a lot given the efficiency of public transport and the size of Singapore).

The museum houses a lot of interesting photo reproductions and articles from the war, but there was very little original memorabilia which a Museum should have to show.

Thankfully the museum is free (although it costs to hire an audio guide), the overall feel was of the effort being more than the outcome, it was disappointing and not really invoking the terror and horror of the prison,"
,,Forgotten part Singapore played in WW!!,5.0,,The Changi Museum is a must to visit even if your not into history or the wars. Free to get in but the $8 cost of the audio was well worth it just to lisien to those whi were there when Singapore fell & was occupied by the Japenese
,,A sombre reminder of the horrors of war,4.0,,A very quiet and tranquil museum that is off the tourist track. I was most moved by the chapel outside the museum that had notes penned by foreign visitors (largely British and Australian) whose relatives had been killed in Singapore during WWII.
,,Excellent overview of Singapore during WWII,4.0,,"Headed out to Changi Museum via bus 2 from Clarke Quay. It was so easy to find, just two stops after the current prison, which you truly cannot miss. The trip took around 70 minutes and the buses are frequent; fares are cheap.
The museum is free but you pay $8 for the audio tour or $6pp if sharing.
The museum is small but well set out and very informative giving an excellent summary of the prison's role during the war, the actions of the Japanese and the amazing acts of bravery and endurance by both POWs and civilians.
Highly recommended."
,,Really terrific history lesson - POW camp survival.,5.0,,"Very moving information and easy access. The audioguide was only charge and it was only $8 S - well worth it. Tons of history, - some quite disturbing so small children would not be advised (they'd probably be bored anyway). The historical aspect was so very informative, the true accounts on the audio really made you understand what it was like without having been there. We should never forget the sacrifices that generation made for our freedom and this museum will help with that goal."
,,A must place for Australians to visit.,5.0,,"Well worth spending some time contemplating how people suffered at Changi Prisong, under the Japanese, from February 1942 to the end of WW2 and how many of them suffered the sorrowful experience for the rest of their lives. The history displayed really makes you think."
,,What a waste war is,5.0,,"We did The Changi Museum as part of a round island tour with this following the Kranji War Memorial. What a brutal part of Singapore's history and a time to remember those who suffered during a war.
The museum has a replica of the chapel and lots of displays throughout the centre with relics, notes and pieces of history. A valuable contribution to the world about the horrors of war. Very well done"
,,Solem and confronting,5.0,,"this is a must on a visit to Singapore, an excellent account of what happened in those terrible years , take time to read and enjoy everything, there is a good cafe attatched clean rest rooms and a great book shop"
,,Moving experience,5.0,,Here you will find out so much about what Singapore is all about. The history is amazing and the whole experience was very moving. One of the highlights of our trip and will head there again next time we are in Singapore.
,,Well done,5.0,,The Changi museum and chapel we used the audio guide was informative and interesting. Well worth the visit museum entry is free just pay for the audio which was 6 or 8 dollars easy to listen to.
,,Reflective and educational,4.0,,"Allied prisoners of war went to either the Burmese Railway, or the Changi Prison, and few survived either destinations. This well kept museum uses some objects and many worded displays to retell the life of a World War Two prisoner living in the prison, including the kind of torture by the Japanese and tenacious spirit of prisoners.

The Chapel isn't much, but then it shows how little the prisoners had to live with."
,,Viewing of prisoner writings,5.0,,"Very moving experience, have been more than once. This historical reminder stays with you long after the visit"
,,Very interesting museum and worth a visit,4.0,,"This museum concerns the Japanese occupation of Singapore during World War 2. It is really interesting and the exhibits well done, although the topic is grim. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in military history."
,,For Hstory Buffs,4.0,,Get to know the history of Singapore at this museum. Very informative. A quiet place to compose your thoughts and think.
,,Good to see,3.0,,The Changi Museum is about the fall and regaining by the allies in ww2. It has good information and artifacts. It is free to enter.
,,Good History,3.0,,The museum depicts the both the tragedy and the heroism of the situation during the 2nd world war. A very informative museum which pictures and displays and true life stories.
,,A Reflection of the Past,5.0,,We visited here after spending Anzac Day at Hellfire Pass and Kanchanaburi War Cemetry. This is the beginning of the Burma /Thailand railway and the Sandakan Death March. Although the museum is small the information and displays tell a heart breaking story. For ex serving defence members and Singaporeans relatives of troubled locals this is a must visit. It is an eye opener and moving place to visit. Would recommend it to everyone. Our past should never be forgotten.
,,A Rather emotional experience,5.0,,"My Great uncle was captured as a POW in Singapore and after reading all the stories of the other POW's and what went on during the occupation of Singapore by the Japanese, I was very moved and horrified to learn some of the things people endured.
I found my Great uncles name in the list of POW's from Australia. A great memorial, to remind us of the horrors of war, and honor those who gave everything to defend our way of life."
,,Lest We Forget,5.0,,"If you're an Australian, this museum is a must. It's quite small, but packs an emotive punch. The audio tour was excellent; reasonably priced and very informative. The staff are super helpful and friendly too. Highly recommended."
,,Sad but good,4.0,,"Very sad to think this has happened. Audio tour can be done or for free you can read all the literature. Chapel is recreated well. Some very sad srories, love doesn't the poem very well done, and is free to do if you don't do the audio."
,,Sad,3.0,,Worth a visit to see how things were in the war and learn what all the people went through . very moving.
,,Memorable Museum,5.0,,"This is a small museum with small chapel. But nothing is small about the impression it will leave on you. The stories inside are so overwhelming.

Go to this place if you want to understand more about the war in this region during the Second World War. You will have a very good understanding of the sacrifices of the defenders of Singapore, made up of 8 nations.

A trip to this museum is definitely worth your time."
,,Very informative,4.0,,"The museum was small but full of facts and memorabilia of the battle of Singapore. The history of the prisoners was presented very well. We did a Changi WWII War Trail and Museum Tour through Viator. Our guide Helena was informative, interesting and passionate. Well worth it."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,Top place to visit and have the history explained of Singapore along with history making notes on how Singapore existed close to all amentaties
,,Humbled,5.0,,Having 2 uncles in Changi I was over come with emotion. A must see for both young and old. A very thoughtful place.
,,Important Historical Site,5.0,,A visit to the Changi Museum is worth the tour. With a family connection to the POW history it was sobering to visit the museum display and chapel. The display panels are well set out and very informative. You could spend longer here than provided on the tour.
,,A sad but compelling place to visit.,5.0,,"There is not much left of the original prison, but the displays and commentary are excellent. Visit the prison chapel just in the courtyard to enhance the story. You get a headset to give you a running commentary of the displays. So much suffering, not just the POW's, but the locals as well. A sad but compelling place to visit. A must for Australians."
,,Life in Singapore under Japanese occupation,4.0,,"Interesting displays and artefacts. The chapel is a replica of a type built in many of the prison camps. The subject matter promotes a sombre atmosphere, reverent to all who suffered. Used the optional ($8) audio tour, which was informative. Spent around 2 hours there."
,,We went on Anzac Day...,5.0,,"Well worth a visit...Bus #2 from Clark Quay about $4 return trip with the EZ card...Small museum with artifacts, free entry... We went on Anzac Day so it was a well worth the visit..."
,,Nice little musuem,4.0,,"Came here for a visit while on a work trip. It's not as big as I'd imagined, but still a very good museum and exhibition. Bus stop nearby so it's ok to get to, free admission or can pay for the audio tour which is good. Probably only 1-2hrs max and you've seen everything. Worth it though."
,,Great short visit,4.0,,"I had a free morning before I went out to the airport so decided to stop in at the Changi Museum. It is free to get in, but worth paying the S$8 for the guided tour as there really is a lot of information in the museum to read and listen to.

I love history so I was really fascinated reading about the conditions and time in Singapore during WW2. Very worth the visit if you enjoy history."
,,A look back,4.0,,Since my father-in-law spent about 6 months in the infamous Changi Prison - as a POW during WWII - this was a must see for us.
,,very moving visit,5.0,,"We were determined to visit this museum out of respect for those that gave their lives & to learn more about the fall of Singapore. It was a very emotional visit & I think important to us. Definitely recommend, the staff were wonderful & friendly."
,,Informative History Venue,4.0,,The Museum places all the happenings of the Fall and Occupation of Singapore in a local and world context. Many personal exhibits and relics bring forth the difficulties of surviving the daily horrors and treatment of the locals and prisoners. Many exhibits are a testimony to the ingenuity and creativity of those incarcerated
,,Moving Experience,5.0,,"The visit to the Changi Museum was one of the highlights of our visit to Singapore. Entry is free - the only cost is $8 for the self guided tour with headphones. I would recommend spending the $8 to hear the real stories from survivors.
Well worth the visit."
,,Good presentation,5.0,,"Good presentation of this part of Singapore's history, well displayed and easy to read boards with photographs. Well worth a visit (free entry) to appreciate this important aspect of history."
,,Good Chronology of the Occupation,5.0,,"This museum is an interesting place to visit. It shows only too well Singapores lack of readiness for the war and the advancing Japanese forces. Yamashita commanding the Japanese forces admits to being outnumbered enormously but his tactical advance gave him victory.

Lee Kuan Yew had scathing words to say of the British in this respect in his biography. The tales of hardship are evident from quotes and artifacts in the museum. The internees were varied and diverse. They endured hardship at the hands of the Japanese and tales of the period make sad recollection.

Then came two bombs - the Emperor didn't understand the first - when Hiroshima and Nagasaki had both been flattened it brought about a sense of reality and with it a surrender. Likewise Singapore returned to its old colonial masters - and Singapore was free again.

A very informative museum. Good airconditioning. Well worth a visit."
,,Very quiet and peaceful,5.0,,"We left the train at Tanah Merah station and caught the No 2 bus expecting an announcement of where to get off on the bus. After 10 minutes we asked someone who said we were going the wrong way so hopped off and crossed the road and the next bus driver told us where to get off. It is next to the Changi Prison. Very nice lady at the desk, we got headphones and spent about an hour or so looking at each part. We had a very nice hot meal at the café before catching the bus back."
,,A must,5.0,,This museum that brought tears to my eyes. A memories of the past in audio and visual. A real must on the Singapore trail
,,Very moving memorial.,5.0,,"My guide was fantastic and I would recommend that rather than just using the headphone tour. She shared information about her parents' and grandparents' experience of the war. Sad that the original prison is razed and that the chapel is a reconstruction, but the displays are very good. Singapore suffered terrible under the Japanese Occupation, and it's good to see how Australian, British, Indian, Dutch troops etc are honoured here."
,,An Moving Visit,4.0,,The Changi Museum is a must see destination stop in Singapore. There are audio tours and a range of artefacts that date back to the Second World War. Overall this was a very touching experience as you hear stories and read statistics from the Japanese invasion of Singapore.
,,Solemn Visit,5.0,,Brought some friends from Cambodia here to visit and see for themselves how war brought suffering and pain to us in Singapore. All my friends could identify with the experience chronicled here. An excellent way to remind ourselves of the evils of war.
,,A must visit,4.0,,"Having been to many exhibitions and resting place of our fallen soldiers and allied forces fallen ,this place is well worth a visit you can get a hearing device which will explain all the information at what you are seeing .would highly recommend to all Australians and commonwealth countries to go and visit ."
,,If you like your history this is a MUST,5.0,,"One afternoon over the weekend on a business trip the heavens opened (as it does in Singapore), with nothing to do I visited the museum. What a great place, very interesting tracing the history of Singapore and what went on, my grandad was here during the Japanese occupied period so it was even more interesting for me. A great way to spend 2/3 hours"
,,Very moving experience,5.0,,"Went here to find out about my wife's father who was a Japanese prisoner of war. Very informative museum even though the history was horrendous. Not much information about him but the lady there found his record on the database. My wife felt sad but somewhat relieved that he had come home after his imprisonment but, he had suffered from his experience for the rest of his short life"
,,A Must Do For All Australians.,5.0,,"This is a must do for all Australians. Spend an hour or two looking at the displays on a self guided tour with audio explaining everything.

There is no fee to enter so I left a donation to assist in the up keep.

I very humbling experience to remind us all how good our lives are compared to the life of an allied POW.

There are tour operators for a guided tour if you wish. I caught the train to Siemi MRT Station then a $6 taxi. Buses also stop at the Chapel."
,,Looking at history,4.0,,"A spare, yet nicely organised museum that looks carefully at an atrocious time in history. Bus number 2 or 29 from MRT station Taneh Merah gets you there. An understated museum in many ways, but very personal stories are shared here which makes it so very real and not so far away considering the seventy years since WWII. Liked the fact that many voices are represented here - POWs, Singaporeans from many backgrounds and some Japanese army personnel. Interesting variety of artefacts from that time are on display as we'll as heaps of photographs and some evocative paintings. Well worth the effort to visit. The audio tape is also very helpful."
,,Sad but fascinating,4.0,,The story of how the invading Japanese treated Singapore residents during World War Two is horrific but this Museum tells it tragically yet tenderly through many well documented first hand accounts.
,,A moment of history,4.0,,"It replicates the history of those who were interned as POW during WW2. Sometimes its just beastly, if you think about it, what humans can do to other humans, in war or greed or etc.
I didnt take the audio tour as we arrived about 430pm. Saw that others spent a few hours here. The pictures and their personal effects, were provoking enough. The narratives written on those displays were clear.
Overall, worth the time to get here and make a visit for a look in a moment of history."
,,Respecting the troops,5.0,,"I feel humbled to have been able to learn more about the shocking experiences of the allied troops at the hands of the Japs during the occupation of Singapore.
It is amazing what such a young, now independent country has become. A leader in most things.
Visit Singapore."
,,Too real,5.0,,This was well worth the time. The condition that these people lived under while in captivity was terrible. It is hard to believe how cruel humans can be to each other they were then and the still are in many places.
,,Disappointed,5.0,,The original prison of war camp has now been taken over by the present day prisoners so the museum struggles to replicate the history. It is worth a visit but we were somewhat disappointed.
,,Very Moving Experience,5.0,,This was a very moving experience. The guided audio tour was informative and well paced with the exhibition. Proud of our Aussie Defence personnel and civillians. Couldn't believe I spent three hours there. Easy to get to. Catch the green East/West line on the MRT. Get off at Tanah Merah and then get the No: 2 bus and get off at Bus stop # 97201. The Museum is just across the road. Lest We Forget.
,,Thought provoking,5.0,,"This is a place of historical importance that tells the true story of the consequences of the fall of Singapore in World War Two, and the tragic effect it had on not only the local people but our forces as well. A great learning experience that will appeal to all. We really loved the visit and will return in the future. Very well put together an highly recommended."
,,Very moving,4.0,,"Finished off a WWII tour here - small museum but the story behind it must be remembered.... I was especially interested in the Changi Quilts ...

No photos allowed in museum which was a shame - especially as there didn't appear to be a Museum Guidebook with the information in it ... if there had been it would be a 5⭐️ review!

Our guide was passionate and kept everyone interested... thank you Helena"
,,Solemn visit,4.0,,Quiet and solemn museum reflecting the gravity of the nature of the commemoration. Audio tour was quite helpful and they also have guided tours - check in advance for times and availability.
,,Need to do if in Singapore,5.0,,"We arrived here at opening time 9.30am and we got an audio piece that we used through the walk around the museum. Great information with what went on and the good thing is if you missed something while listening you could always go back on the audio pieces and listen again, plenty to read and some of the stories were sad to listen too, worth every cent, must Dom, after the walk through the resturant just outside the museum is also a great place for a bite to eat."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"We did this as part of a tour and only had about an hour to look round, which wasn't really long enough. There are lots of displays and 'boards' to read. I also hired an audio set, which was worth having, but could have done with longer to fully appreciate it. I had done the Battle Box tour in the morning at Fort Canning Park and for detail about the actual fall of Singapore that was much better. The Changi Museum focuses more on life as a prisoner of war. I suggest that if you have a feel for history at all, especially re WW2, then you should try to do at least one of these."
,,A jewel of history,5.0,,"It is very very easy to get to Changi Museum by bus, car or taxi. We took the bus from Singapore centre. The displays at the museum were excellent, a variety of pictures photographs and written accounts from the sometimes disturbing Japanese occupation of this part of the world, during the Second World War. Many nations were very badly treated by the occupiers, but personily I had not realised how very badly the Malaysian people were treated during this period, that came as a shock.
A very worthwhile and informative visit to a well kept museum."
,,"Moving, deeply moving",5.0,,"If you have read or seen King Rat or Empire of the Sun, you have seen Changi Prison. It was the scene of tremendous cruelty and brutality during WWII and this is a moving museum to remember those who lived and died within its walls.
It is somewhat out of the way but on an island that is only 28 miles by 14, nothing is too far. It is well worth the trip and a visit to the cemetery nearby where the British and Commonwealth dead are buried in a most tranquil and beautiful place.
It was coming up to school holidays when we visited and in both locations there were large groups of children. There was no disrespect or chaos. These children were being taught an important part of their heritage and treated with the respect it richly deserves."
,,Very powerful,5.0,,"I was surprised to find myself choking up with emotion during my visit here. The Changi Museum is one of the better museums in Singapore and does an excellent job of telling the story of the unimaginable hardships endured by PoW's, civilian internees and civilians during the Japanese Occupation. Pictures, quotes and only a small number of objects on show bring home how awful it must have been. I took the audio tour and it was very interesting as there isn't a huge amount of explanatory text around the displays. The replicas of the Chapel Murals are the unquestionable highlights. I can't imagine how the artist had the physical or emotional strength to paint the Crucifixion with the quote ""Father Forgive Them They Know Not What They Do"" amidst such suffering. It is a hike from the centre of town but rather easy to get to via the MRT and the Number 2 bus from Tanah Merah station. Well worth the effort."
,,Allow plenty of time,5.0,,It is actually free to get into the museum but you can purchase some head phones to hear a commentary for $8 per set. It is a very moving museum and horrible to think what our brave men went through. It is hard to read some of the comments as the lighting is not 100% but the pictures tell a sad story.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"I visited the previous museum 20 years ago,the new site is a wonderful improvement.
I strongly recommend the audio guide to really understand the story.This museum tastefully gives the moving story of all nations involved,and the hardship of the Singapore population.
I would add the people running the museum are first class,and are particularly helpful to the disabled."
,,Rememebr History,5.0,,"This houses the Changi prison which is turned into a museum today. There are strict rules of no video or photography so take time to read the scripts, banners and history. it reminds us of the brave soldiers from India, Australia, New Zealand and Britain who fought for independence. The museum is well structured and has a small chapel attached and a small souvenir store. If you are taking the round Island trip by a tour then this is a pit stop and you will like this place."
,,We WILL remember them,4.0,,"The museum is not big but can take a while to get through if you read everything.We were on the round the island tour bus so were limited at time at each stop which was sometimes not long enough.A graphic reminder that war is not pretty and that mankind can do hideous things to each other,not too different in todays world unfortunately,we do not learn over the years. A sad place to visit but important to Brits,Aussies and Kiwis especially. One has to reflect on the decisions made at the time and wonder,lest we forget."
,,Interesting History of Changi,4.0,,"Had the tour by head phones, very informative but also depressing. In all the tour last a couple of hours and afterwards you were able to if you had a family member who had been in Changi during the war you were able to get a print out of when they were captured etc. I managed to get my late Uncle George's records which I will treasure ."
,,Battlefield Tour,5.0,,No visit to si galore is complete without a visit tomthe museum and nearby prison. Brings home the horrors of what happened
,,Museum visit,5.0,,"A very moving place, tells the story of how troops were treated by the Japanese during the 2nd world war and how they survived the torture they suffered. Makes you great full for their sacrifice so that we could be free"
,,For such a big event .....,2.0,,For something that every Australian is at the very least aware of it was a .... It left a hole....... But I applaud that at least there is something
,,Great for Aussies,5.0,,"Excellent ,we really enjoyed the tour,,the museum is only small but has a lot to show and read ,very sad reading some of the stories"
,,Somber reflection,3.0,,"I visited this museum to honour the WW2 dead. It was very informative. You can hire an audio tour. Good photographs and mementos.

I would have liked to have seen a few more life size replicas of a camp (like bedding, work sites etc). The photos were good but a representation would have helped.

Free to enter. A fantastic cafe at the site."
,,Taking in HIstory,5.0,,"If it is a first time to Singapore then you should do Changi. The history of Singapore is quite an eye opener, especially if you are lucky enough to get a local guide."
,,Great,5.0,,"A moving & educational experience! Although I knew the Japanese attack on Singapore resulted in a huge loss of life, I was totally unaware just how enormous it was Thanks to Katherine for her assistance"
,,visit,4.0,,Informative but a bit long at over 2 hours. Good background to the war years and gruesome in places. Not he actual POW site but nearby.
,,Fasnanating insight to WW2 Singapore surrenders to Japan,4.0,,"We went on the original walking tours of Changi museum and throughly enjoyed our very personal insightful guide who knew so much detail of this era as her family had been effected by this section of the war. Would recommend this to every Aussie/Indian/Singaporean or British person to experience, a fight not many know about."
,,Holiday,5.0,,This is a very sad and moving tour. It really brings home the truth about cruelty and suffering our soldiers were inflicted with during their imprisonment. You can only hope that this deplorable situation will never happen again. May they rest in peace.
,,Changi World War II tour,5.0,,"Our guide JuLin was amazing. It is clear she has a real passion for the subject matter. He presentation in the brass cross had many of us in tears. Her presentation on what actually happened in the lead up to the surrender was excellent. As a serving member of the ADF I was very appreciative of her knowledge.
I can only imagine what those thousands of PIW and innocent civilians went through."
,,"Very informative, thought provoking afternoon.",4.0,,"We decided to do the audio tour which enabled you to read the many descriptive & personal letters whilst listening to additional & supporting information. No photography or video allowed in the museum. Having lived in Singapore for 2 1/2 years in the 70's as part of the British Army contingent we thought we were very familiar with Changi & the fall of Singapore, oh how wrong we were. The only thing missing was the old Changi Jail, this has been knocked down to enable expansion of a woman's prison. They have kept the original facade and you can see it on the way to the museum. However, there is an original cell door & part of the wall along with many artefacts donated by family members of some of the survivors. There are also beautiful murals originally painted by a prisoner and after much coaxing he helped restore them. The Chapel is a place for reflection. Well worth a visit. We went by MRT to Tanah Merah and you can either take a taxi or bus to the museum. The museum is free to enter and the audio is optional."
,,a must do,5.0,,A very well thought out museum. A place dedicated to keeping the history and memory of singapore and those who supported in the war. emotional photos and auditory acounts. all staff helpful. not expensive and on a bus route
,,Museum Visit,4.0,,This is a very well kept museum with good toilets and also somewhere to eat and drink also plenty of interesting items inside
,,A Must For Everyone,5.0,,Stories are told without the real horror of what happened here. It will make you think without giving you nightmares. A wonderful place to visit to show just how awful people can become through bullying and control.
,,Amazing piece of history,5.0,,"So moving and being able to read the stories and pieces of things that were there during occupation, only negative is not being allowed to take photos inside the museum."
,,Very moving place to visit,5.0,,"I knew that my uncle was involved in the Rimau project but because he was never a prisoner of war I did not expect to read about it at Changi. I believe the reesearch of tbe project gas overtaken the information displayed but that did not spoil my visit to the prison. I found the quilt to be particulary impressive.

We had a very pleasant lunch at the nearby Bark Cafe and were lucky to have the lion dance performed during oyr visit."
,,Some issues here...,3.0,,"I visited this place early in the morning. I was set aback by the photography prohibition, something which I always find senseless and really annoys me. Also the fact that the museum is located on a spot with no real importance for the subject affects the atmosphere... at least it affected my visiting experience.

Apart from these two notes, it's a nice little museum with an adequate collection of artifacts properly displayed and the staff is kind and polite."
,,Very emotional,4.0,,We caught a number 2 bus out to the museum which took over an hour from bugs junction so you need to allow the time subject to where you are staying. The museum was very informative and made us realise how lucky we are to live in this time and place. We learnt lots about the war which we did nit know and wished we could have seen inside the prison. The Tor of the museum took over an hour but worth every the time to go out here and back.
,,A must,5.0,,One of the best but smallest museums I have experienced that told a story of so much courage and hardship for both military and common people. not the easiest place to get to but a number 2 bus stops outside the door if going bu public transport. More than worth the effort.
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"Amazingly comprehensive collection of records, books, memorabillia, very helpful and friendly staff. So pleased we made the effort."
,,Reminder of a brutal past,3.0,,"Considering the historical impacts of events covered by this museum more attention to interpretation would help a new generation. The brutality of the Japanese was down played, as was the incompetance of the English military command in the fiasco. I wa pleased to see attention given to local Chinese and Malay populatios that risked so much."
,,Thought provoking,4.0,,Provides a good insight into what happened in Singapore during WW2 and the hardships endured by locals and soldiers.
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"Sadly you can no longer visit the prison, and consequently the memory seems to be fading. The museum is informative and respectful, but we really wanted to see and feel the actual prison, which in my opinion should've been preserved as an historical site out of respect for the POWs. My late grandfather was here at the end of the war in the pacific, and was hosted in Singapore and Changi to celebrate the 60 year anniversary. It would've been nice to be able to see what he saw."
,,Humbling experience,5.0,,"Every one should visit places like The Changi Museum, it is a reminder of the suffering of the brave women and men that had to endure over 3 years of hell."
,,Informative but sadly being forgotten,4.0,,"Caught 5 bus out to Changi Women's Prison and walked the rest. Bus trip itself well worth as you don't see anything much from MRT. Takes about an hour to travel the ~24km through the suburbs.

Museum itself was well worth it and the audio tour at two at $12 cheap (less than 2 coffees at the nearby bar). Lots to read and see about the history and terrible suffering of that time.

Sadly as the original museum site has been reclaimed by the expanding nearby prison the authenticity is fading. Thanks to the dedication of the curators it is still hanging in there but for how much longer who knows. Pity as it is really why Singapore is what it is today in part to the failure of the British Empire in its defence of the island.

Check it out and allow a full half day to do it."
,,There was an eerie quiet..when i started reading i knew why ?,4.0,,"This was quite out of the way but def worth the effort. it was about a $15 taxi ride for us. When we arrived i thought it was closed..but when i entered and everyone was silent..and reading..I knew it was the moving content that kept everyone quiet. I was very moved by the stories, the photos and some of the artefacts. I now know why my grandpa never spoke about his time during the war. It is right that all Australians should pay their respects at this memorial."
,,Harrowing,5.0,,It is so hard to believe the things that happen in war and what the people who were in Singapore when the Japanese arrived suffered. We should never forget
,,Very moving,5.0,,"It's a bit of a jaunt by public transport involving bus or busses as well as MRT, but well worth the effort.

The museum is free and features many pictures of the WW2 occupation and survivor quotes. It is impossible not to be moved. There isn't much on what happened after liberation, but there is a good little video on what happened before the surrender.

There is a nice gift shop, quite a few books for sale as well as some lovely batik bags.

There is also a restaurant with good food, although somewhat pricey.

On the bus, you get a good view of the current Changing prison complex which is huge."
,,Tribute to POW,4.0,,Visit of Changi Museum and Chapel. WWII Japanese occupation of SG with moving and touching individual stories behind. Tribute to all the POW (prisoners of war). Emotionnel experience.
,,Very moving,5.0,,Amazing place. Visited here a few years ago. Still a moving and humbling experience. Well worth a visit.
,,Moving,4.0,,"Went when I was 6 years old, over 50 years ago, and the horror still lives with me. Revisited recently and it has changed: the photos of the atrocities have mainly gone (so as to not antagonise trading partners perhaps, hopefully to promote the healing process) but as a memorial it is still moving. Ironically, the Japanese school is just down the road, a neat juxtaposition of two gaols ?"
,,Museum visit,4.0,,"very good portrayal of the history of Singapore, the horrors of war and the impact on the culture of the city from different regimes."
,,Very moving experience,5.0,,"My husband and I visited today. A very moving experience. Very few people here on a Sunday afternoon, so great to escape the Sunday crowds at other attractions. We hired the headset for the audio tour. It is $8 for one person or two can share, with two headsets plugged in, for $12. We highly recommend the headsets as the commentary is very moving, as survivors tell their personal stories. The shop is excellent and they sell books and other items at a very reasonable price. The café next door is great to have a drink and snack afterwards."
,,Very moving,5.0,,Excellent museum showing life as a prisoner of the Japanese during WW2 well worth a visit although it's very moving.also has an excellent restaurant just outside.
,,very interesting,5.0,,"Visited here during our recent stay in Singapore, very interesting and moving experience. The museum is free to enter and you pay 8 Singapore dollars for the hire of the audio equipment which is worth hiring as it allows you to hear peoples personal accounts.
We traveled by MRT which was easy, when you come out of the station there is a bus stop you take a number 2 bus it is quite a journey but not overly long, you see Changi prison on the right hand side and the museum is just after that."
,,The story of Changi,5.0,,"My wife, daughter and I made the trip out to Changi to honour the memory of my wife's grandfather. There were many memories for my wife of her grandfather and their talks about his life as a POW at Changi following the fall of Singapore. The visit to the museum was a silent affair, not sombre but respectful. The displays of memorabilia, photos and local stories gave another level of depth to this blot on the history of civilised people. We all took away something special from this place and would recommend the experience for anyone interested in the history of our people."
,,"Changi Museum, an informative attraction in Singapore, and its FOC!",5.0,,"A visit to Changi Museum which features about historic happenings of Singapore invaded by Japan during the 2ND war world period. I was surprised after reading the notes attached to the pictures that in fact countries like Australia (thousands military soldiers and nurses, with some beautiful young OZ nurses being captured and tortured by male Japanese as sex slaves), India (wow, India government sent over thousands of people to help Singapore fight the war and there were only very few survived and managed to return to India), British, even NZ who sent over their military pilots to bomb the Japanese troops. Indeed, it's very informative, educational and moving. As a Singaporean, I am not only moved by all these invaluable information but also feeling full of gratitude toward countries who had helped to defend for Singapore during the world war II. From the bottom of my heart, may I thank you all and your ancestors profusely! This museum certainly worth your visit and you should bring your children along to tell them how our heroic ancestors and foreigners had fought hard for Singapore. It's amazing to see how Singapore had survived through the war and since transformed from A Little Red Dot to now being the top Dragon in Asia."
,,Good experience but a little disappointing.,3.0,,"This was a good experience with some very poignant displays, but I have to say, my husband and I were both expecting more and thought it was actually based in the old prison, but it wasn't."
,,Changi Museum,5.0,,"This is a small museum but full of information about what is was like during WW2 for the people of Singapore, prisoners of Changi and others. It is free to get in, but we recommend hiring the headphones for a few dollars, to appreciate what it was really like. You can there using a taxi, but we found the MRT and bus easy to use and part of the experience."
,,Moving and informative,5.0,,"Easy to reach by MRT to Tanah Merah and then Bus No 2. An excellent museum, describing through photos and artefacts, life in Singapore during the Japanese invasion. It also commemorates the Allied POWs who suffered so badly in Changi internment camp. Replicas of the Changi Murals and the Changi Quilts are also on display.
In the courtyard there is a symbolic replica of the Changi Chapel. For extra information would advise the audio guide.
The shop has a very good selection of informative books."
,,The Changi Museum,4.0,,"My wife and I visited the Changi Museum not knowing what to expect after a solemn visit to Kranji War Cemetery ( a must do visit).
The displays were all well documented, although I thought a little bit ""Politically correct"" probably didn't really give any real details of the horrors encounterd by Allied Troops during WW2"
,,Experience the war in Singapore and remember how Changi reshaped Singapore,5.0,,"The war in Singapore has been hidden from many for years. A visit to the Changi Museum will uncover the history and story that changed Singapore after World War II. It is a sad place like all war museum , but we should not forget the memories of the sacrifices many made so that Singapore becomes the prosperous country it is today."
,,Very moving experience,4.0,,"This is well worth a visit, and I highly recommend you hire the audio tour because it's so clear and informative. Allow two hours as there's so much to read and see. Very quiet atmosphere, I think because the subject matter is so intense. The museum is out of the way, but worth the trip. We went by MTR then bus."
,,Moving experience,5.0,,"I caught public transport to the Changi Museum and at first glance, I thought I had come to the wrong place. I'm not sure what I expected to find, but having read quite a bit about the Japanese occupation of Singapore and life inside Changi prison during those years, I was initially a bit disappointed. It's such a 'big' story that I think I was looking for a 'bigger' experience.
But on reflection, this is exactly what Changi Museum should be. It's a small and quiet spot. The Museum & Chapel are really just places of reflection. The rather old-fashioned Museum allows the visitor to read individual stories of sadness and heroism. You leave with a sense of the 'spirit' of the people (civilians and POW's) imprisoned here."
,,Changi Museum,5.0,,"Whilst you can get there by public transport, you really need to get there by car or taxi.
It's only a small museum, but it is quite emotional. Spend half an hour in the Chapel - meditating, praying, relaxing or simply thinking about what you should be doing with your life.
It's not a modern museum - so no ""sight and sound"" displays, no smells(!) - but there is lots to see but it will require you to read things. You should, it is worth it and makes your realise the pain that wars cause. Some of the displays are excellent.
You could spend 15 minutes here or 4 hours, if you were to read everything.
If you have a car, have a drive round and see the Johor Guns and underground tunnels - very impressive - and, being Singapore, try the local sea food restaurants!!"
,,Interesting history and good audio tour,5.0,,"I visited this museum and found the place a wonderful tribute to all of those who suffered in the 2nd world war in Singapore. The stories of individuals hardship, suffering and tragedy moved me.

It's a shame the museum feels hidden away from the tourist places as it truly provides an account of what happened and the atrocities that took place.

All the stories & accounts I read about were moving. But the most moving was that of the women and children that suffered.

My heart was warmed by the stories of how they helped each other, used their faith to keep going . I was also encouraged at the ingenuity that pows showed amazing.

We met a taxi driver who was very pleasant and we asked why it seemed not many people acknowledged this. He said we wish to look forward. I think that that is a positive way to look at life .

However, I also believe that you have to know where you have come from in order to know where you are going.

Worth a visit to understand Singapore's history."
,,Don't underestimate this little museum.,5.0,,"This is a small museum but full of information about what is was like during WW2 for the people of Singapore, prisoners of changi and the detail of what actually happened and how Singapore found itself taken by the Japanese. It takes time to read and look at everything and the content can be hard hitting at times and may evoke emotion if you have any connection to Singapore, people or experience of the time, but it's well worth it the visit. The art work done by the prisoners is touching and revealing. There is a small chapel plus shop. I think they could expand on merchandise to make more money for the museum but at the same time what they do sell is very much in keeping with the site."
,,Humbling experience,5.0,,"Not widely advertised as a must see in Singapore and we only Visited here as my friend's father was a doctor during the war and incarcerated in Changi, so not my choice. But pleased I went, Such a humbling experience and a good history lesson.
It costs approx 20 $ from the city centre by taxi and entry is free. A headset costs 8$ and includes narratives by those incarcerated which are extremely moving.
For anyone interested in WW2 history it's a must. ( as is the bunker apparently but sadly we didn't have time to go there)"
,,"Humbleness, sadness and Inspiration",5.0,,"The Changi Museum is an excellent formula of simple, factual and delivered on a personal note, in many of the examples demonstrated. The audio tour is a big step up from the written text. It is a well laid out Museum in its timelines, subject material (military, the service men and women and the Singaporeans) and delivery of information. I was humbled, moved and inspired at the same time."
,,WWII history,4.0,,"An interesting visual, written and audio history of Singapore during WWII, but audio experience cost was moderate."
,,Moving,4.0,,This visit was part of a tour. Very moving to read the history from different perspectives. Very well presented & informative.
,,Must see place in Singapore,5.0,,"Admission is free, and it is very interesting place for those, who do not know anything about Singapore - animals and history."
,,A very moving experience!,5.0,,"It is hard to describe the museum as wonderful, as the history that it portrays is harsh and disturbing, but it is very well done! Not to be missed for history enthusiasts!"
,,Makes you sad and angry. But well worth it.,5.0,,"Took an audio tour of the chapel near Changi Prison, which outlines the history of the invasion of Singapore in WWII. It was an interesting place to visit, but as I said above it made me sad and angry. Nothing to do with the tour, just the content. Still recommend you go here."
,,A very moving experience and a must if one wants to glean some history,5.0,,"Avoided going in a group,tour as I knew I would be spending atleast 2+ hours there and also needed a cool Tiger beer afterwards. Travelled by metro (MRT) from City Hall on Green line to Tampines and then 29 bus to Changi Museum...cost $4 and took 1 hour. All very easy. Museum is free but you must have audio set for 8$ to get the deep feeling of what went on ...after absorbing the whole scene one can feel quite drained...a cool beer a must! Being a war enthusiast, allocate a day including transport and humidity"
,,So moving,5.0,,"The audio tour is fantastic and has moving interviews with survivors of the pow camp. I must admit it moved me to tears hearing about the brutality suffered by the prisoners of war. Very good exhibits. Reading what relatives had written in remberance to those who'd died was incredibly moving.
I would thoroughly recommend a visit to this museum."
,,Well worth a visit!,5.0,,"A must-see for those with relatives who were involved in the WWII invasion by Japan. Some very moving photographs, text, and descriptions of conditions, and stories of some very brave deeds in the most awful circumstances. Very moving."
,,Best curated World War 2 Museum in Singapore,5.0,,"Well curated and memorialized second world war museum.

Exhibits are tangible memories of the disaster that was the fall of Singapore in 1942.

Visit will leave you emotionally drained as it documents in detail the excesses and brutality of the Japanese occupation especially the inhuman and cruel treatment of prisoners of war. Should be compulsory for all Japanese students but the whole pacific war is whitewashed in their school system. Pity.

Even though the space is small, taking in all the museum will take about 1.5 hours at least. I'm a History major and teach it at the Community College level. I also specialised in East Asian and Military history at university. This museum is small but it has quality and can be spoken of in the same breath as the Museum of the Pacific War in Fredericksburg, Texas, USA, though it can't match it in sheer scale. Documents very well the British experience in the Far East and showcases their failings.

I make an annual visit with some of my students around Remembrance Day (the American equivalent of Memorial Day) and we also visit the Kranji War memorial.

Changi is a sleepy outpost so I suggest you plan to reach the museum in mid-afternoon and have dinner at Changi Village.There is an attached bistro which serves ice cold beer and excellent chicken wings."
,,Sobering Tour,5.0,,We visited the Changi museum as part of a Singapore Island tour. The museum gives an interesting and educational insight into the horrors endured by the people of Singapore during the Japanese occupation. Definitely worth a visit
,,A little disappointing,3.0,,"This really is only a museum with pictures and an audio tour. Whilst it does portray the terrors of the prisoners, it was a little disappointing."
,,worth visiting,3.0,,"The Changi Museum is an important part of history and is a must see if you visit Singapore,Changi resonates in the hearts and memories of many Australians as a place of great suffering. The Chapel is simple"
,,A must for history buffs,5.0,,"If your a history buff, or interested in WW2 and the fall of Singapore this place is a must visit attraction. You will gain insight into the events and atrocities that took place during the fall and occupation of Singapore."
,,"Lest we Forget - Australians, British and not least of all Singaporeans",4.0,,"I have spent many years studying the Second World War mostly in the European and Russian theatres and have only recently begun reading in some depth about the Pacific Theatre of the war. Changi resonates in the hearts and memories of many Australians as a place of great suffering. The Chapel is simple but walking in I felt a gentle and silent peace. Chapels, like all sacred places, are for believer and often for non-believer as well, containers and holders of memories. I felt that very strongly. From there into the museum where the story of the invasion of Singapore, its fall and the years of Japanese occupation told from the perspectives of defenders, attackers and occupiers was gripping. Most powerful were the accounts given by Singaporeans themselves - and some of that was very hard reading. I teared up more than once. Changi tells a story and holds a lesson, and offers reconciliation. Lest we Forget."
,,Worth visiting but needs a refresh,3.0,,The Changi Museum is an important part of history and is a must see if you visit Singapore however I think the keepers of Changi history need to start thinking about a more dynamic and interactive exhibition to keep the younger generation engaged. There are many fascinating and important aspects of this exhibition that are being lost in translation for the younger generation. We took the audio tour and it was great to have the story told - many in the first person accounts.
,,Respectful place keeping alive the memory of an important part of world history,5.0,,"We visited this museum as part of the War Trail walk which was a wonderful experience. The museum is a wonderful and respectful tribute to the many people of different backgrounds that suffered in and around Singapore. As an Australian teacher of history, I was touched by the lovely tributes made to the Australian and NZ forces. It is obvious that the museum staff go to great lengths to preserve and accurately reconstruct this part of Singaporean history which is so important to not only their own local people but to others from a variety of other countries around the world."
,,Museum,4.0,,We visited the museum and were very impressed. It has been moved but still some interesting reading and photographs. We caught the train to Tampines and then a number 29 bus that took us straight to the museum.
,,A respectful must if you have the time,4.0,,This museum is small but worth the visit particularly if you have a family connection or other connection. You only need an hour there. I visited the museum as part of a tour which I think was the best way if you are short on time or don't have a car. The tour was called Changi Chapel and Museum Half-Day Tour from Singapore and was run by Tour East Singapore but I booked through Viator and it cost about $35SGD. The tour went for 3 hours and included a quick walk around Kampong Glam and a wet market at a public housing area plus a drive through of Changi village and a drive past the Changi prison ruins and the Selarang camp gate.
,,Powerful experience and free!,5.0,,This museum was a hidden gem. It is small but full of powerful first-hand accounts of the Singapore experience under Japanese occupation. It is truly a testament to the human spirit. Well worth the trip.
,,Tears guaranteed!,5.0,,"At many points during my visit, I lost touch with reality and felt myself trapped in a Changi war cell. I strongly believe there is no better complement for a war museum.
Please spend 2-3 hrs and go over all the exhibits and displays. Highly recommend! Only negative is rip-off pricing at the bark café."
,,Museum and Chapel - Very Moving.,4.0,,"This memorial was very moving. It is a small museum with a replica of a chapel used by prisoners in the war. We hired audio sets and they gave commentry on the displays we were viewing.

We spent over an hour here looking at the displays and reading all of the information. Well worth a visit."
,,Tasteful and informative,5.0,,Very thoughtfully organised with an excellent audio tape which is to be recommended. Plenty of time for reflection and thought. Professionally staffed. Well worth dong some homework on the history of Singapore and the occupation before the visit.
,,A place for reflection,5.0,,"Allow for plenty of time here as you will want to linger longer than you think. Recommend the audio guide which adds the explanation and overall experience.

Great experience highlighting how during the worst of times, not just for the POWs but many many others, humanity will find a way to show the best in people"
,,"Was good, but...",4.0,,"We went here as part of a tour group from our ship, so we'd been given a lot of background information about the location beforehand.
I was disappointed that most of the original wall of the prison was covered by hessian fencing, so it was difficult to see.
Plus we had another tour group arrive at the same time - the guide was taking them around and explaining every section very loudly in great detail, making it difficult to see and read the exhibits in the first room, which isn't very wide. Not easy for people not in his group as most people have to read quite a bit of detail.
I thought there would be more information, but it was worthwhile to visit."
,,Provide Insight to WWII,3.0,,Quite a small place. Plenty of photos to remind us of what our grandparents and parents had gone thru during the war. Quite scary how people were being tortured. I am so lucky I was not born in that era.
,,Great Small Museum,5.0,,"The Changi Museum is a really excellent and well run free museum which sensitively covers the experiences of the Changi Prison during the period of the Second World War. It has a small chapel modelled on the actual chapel used by prisoners during the war. It is a serene, calm and very tastefully delivered experience with a good audio tour."
,,Educational and Fantastic Service,5.0,,"One can easily spend 1.5 to 2 hours in this small but wonderful museum that houses some amazing collection about the POWs, Japanese occupation etc. I actually learnt a lot in my 2 hours there - service staff are top-notch and personable. Even for a Singaporean - this is quite a gem."
,,Somber and educational,5.0,,Really glad we visited this historic POW prison. Excellent pictures and commentary help to describe life as a prisoner. We were really moved by the restored religious murals painted by a prisoner. Human spirit endures even in the worst circumstances.
,,Sadness etched in every line....but a powerful exhibition and testament to the strength of the human spirit,5.0,,"In terms of exhibits in Singapore, I can't honestly say that this is the easiest place to get to without a car, however it's possible and it's well worth it - a tad sad, but well worth it.

You go to MRT station Tanah Merah, walk outside the station and #2 bus will take you to Changi. It literally drops you right outside the museum. You get back the same way. It's cheap and easy, just be prepared to shove your way onto the bus if it's a public holiday!

You walk around the museum at your own pace, with free headphones. It's just such a powerful statement about the human spirit and how people can dig in and carry on. against all odds The exhibit opens with the fall of Singapore and the capture and subsequent appalling treatment of British, Malay and Indian soldiers. The loss of dignity in trying to survive was what hit me most and stays with me whilst writing this review.

All that said, this is not a traumatic experience. There are lovely exhibits of people's letters to each other, quilts made by imprisoned ladies and the like.

I understood much more about the fall of Singapore after this visit, and perhaps more importantly I appreciated the sacrifices of entire families and how courage can keep you alive."
,,A little amateur for such an important historic record,3.0,,"This is a must see for anyone interested in the Changi story, but I was dissappointed it was not of the standard of the National Museum."
,,Well presented..,5.0,,Really worth a visit to see the many artifacts and to read the personal stories. Easy to get to via the metro (MRT) and a bus ride.
,,A visit that is well worth taking,5.0,,"We arrived by public transport- MRT and then bus- not difficult to do. The museum is excellent. The audio tour is essential to appreciating the museum. The experiences shared are remarkable. We learnt a lot and appreciated the brief traumatic history of Singapore during the war.
I think the museum made for a very important contrast to the rest of Singapore. It made me reflect how amazing it is that this nation has recovered so splendidly from the dark war days. I think this is a must for anyone interested in history."
,,Moving,3.0,,"I thought this would be Changi prison from WW2, but it was a museum. The reflections from the war were very moving. An interesting place to visit."
,,A Must see,5.0,,What a wonderful museum take the time to talk to some of the staff members they can talk to you how this affected them as they lived through it. A must visit so well laid out.
,,Very moving,5.0,,"Only a small museum but well worth the visit if your interested in the history of Singapore during ww2.
Has a cafe area and an audio device if you decide to hire.Train or bus transport are options but we enjoyed the bus with its top deck veiw of the outer areas of Singapore"
,,Very moving,5.0,,"Easy to get to via MRT and/or bus. Free entry to the museum which has plenty of information on the displays but I would highly recommend the audio guide for which there is a small charge but gives you the added benefit of additional information and some personal interviews with former detainees.
Powerful content which gives an excellent insight to how the detainees suffered during the occupation on Singapore during WWII but also demonstrates how the human spirit shines through under the harshest conditions.
I would say this is a ""must see"" sight if you are interested in the history of Singapore."
,,A highlight of a round the world trip,5.0,,A moving experience highlighted by finding the name of a relative amongst the thousands of names in books at the conclusion of the tour. Easy to get to by public transport and a good cafe available for lunch. Audio tour well worth the cost.
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,"I visited Changi Museum for the second time with a group of Australian university students studying Singapore's history, culture and politics. We had a guided tour of the museum with Catherine, a deeply knowledgeable researcher and wonderful story teller. The museum’s exhibitions are excellent in their own right, but Catherine's stories really captured the attention and emotions of our students. The museum also offers audio tours which I'm sure would be interesting. Changi Museum plays an important role in researching, documenting and disseminating the stories of this period of history. We will be back next year. Highly recommended."
,,Fantastic museum and tribute to former inmates,5.0,,"A very well presented and moving exhibition. I wasn't sure what to expect but knowing the history of Singapore in WW2 i felt this was an extremely fitting tribute to their suffering and memory. The audio tour is an excellent addition to the experience. I spent about 2h here in total and certainly learned more about the harrowing experience of the former prisoners.

Certainly worth the effort to make it out there from the CBD and very straight forward via the MRT and bus service (bus 2 stops right outside)."
,,Moving experience,5.0,,"I was very impressed by this museum, it is fairly simple however quite powerful due to its content. I would highly recommend taking the audio tour, it adds a lot to the experience, especially the interviews with survivors. Make sure to take your time to read and listen to everything. It will give you a really good feel for the time of the occupation. It is moving to hear and read about some of the barbarity that happened, but at the same time, the resilience of the people to get through it is astounding.
The museum is easy to get to by public transport, you can get the number 2 bus all the way from the city (takes a while, but plenty to look at on the way), or take the MRT to Expo or Tanah Merah and pick the number 2 bus up from there.
As a side note, I also enjoyed walking around the area of the museum a bit. There are some lovely houses here."
,,Visited as part of the Round the Island War History Tour.,4.0,,"A compact museum with a wealth of history from the Japanese occupation of Singapore.YOu probably need to allow around an hour to visity, we had 45mins and it really wasn't long enough if you want to read the descriptions of the exhibits."
,,Moving,4.0,,If I read all of the stories on the information panels I would be an emotional wreck. If possible visit Battlebox prior to visit to understand the situation.
,,Changi museum,4.0,,I visited Changi Museum on the way to the airport which is a good way of combining a trip. The museum is essentially free unless you want an audio tour. It gives good personal accounts of the suffering endured during WW2.
,,worth the visit,4.0,,Transport was easy. We caught a No. 2 bus from our hotel on Victoria St (near the city) all the way to the Museum. A slow trip but comfortable and can look out at the city and suburbs on the way. the Museum was very informative and a very sad part of history. The museum tells the brutal story of Singapore under Japanese occupation. The Museum is free but there is audio for a small charge. The audio is not bad but a lot of the information on the audio is the same as what is written on the display. There are some good personal accounts worth listening to on the audio. The Museum was a very moving experience.
,,Woth a visit,5.0,,"spent the morning before going on our international flight to the Changi Museum and Chapel, we spent a total of 4 hours there reading the history of the War in Singapore, when I went to school it was never explained to us as kids as to actually visit Singapore and see the Changi museum and other historical War sites, I would recommend this tour for those interested in War History."
,,Sobering,5.0,,"A must for anyone interested in the wartime history of Singapore. Using photos, memorabilia and first hand accounts this museum brings home the harsh truth of Singapore under Japanese rule. A very respectful place with an excellent audio tour."
,,Very poignant and worth a visit,4.0,,We used our Singapore tourist pass to take the MRT and bus to the museum. Bought a poppy at the entrance. Excellent audio tour with very good exhibits. Really brings home what happened to Singapore during the Second World War. Restaurant next door was very good. Well worth a visit.
,,Changi Museum,5.0,,"This is a really moving experience. You need to take you time and absorb all of the displays. We hired the speaker system and it added to the experience. It is not an all singing-all dancing experience but it is worthwhile and very moving. It was great to see Australians, English Malay and Japanese all paying homage in the chapel.

To absorb the full expereince, you need at least 90 minutes to 2 hours."
,,Near the International airport and well worth a visit,5.0,,We had time to spend having come off a cruise and having a flight home in the evening as many are. Had spotted this on TA and went by cab from Changi airport. Well worth the visit which was in any case free. Interesting and varied displays which with an audio guide which was reasonably priced vividly depicted the events in Singapore during WW2. Went very well with a previous trip we did in the Battlebox underground bunker in Fort Canning park
,,good experience,4.0,,The museum is a tribute to all the people who lost their lives during the 2nd World War Japenese occupation of Signapore .. Not a museum fan but it was very informative and worth visiting
,,Memorial museum to those who died,4.0,,"There were only about 6 of us in our group, we had a wonderful guide who made us all laugh enroute. We passed ""Changi Jail"" entrance it is an enormous place, shortly after we arrived at the Museum. This is a very moving place and tells the story of occupation hardships and prisoners during the 2nd world war"
,,Pilgrimage,3.0,,"Visited because my father was a POW. Found it moving but a bit amateurish and often repetitive, Free to enter but audio guide is charged and also guilty of repitition of content. Best accessed by taxi since public transport awkward."
,,Lest we forget...,4.0,,"A sobering visit to the museum that commemorates those imprisoned in Singapore by the Japanese in WWII. Light entertainment? Definitely not, but probably required viewing."
,,The Horror of War,5.0,,Changi camp reminds us of the brutality of war and the resolve of humanity. It is a place for quiet reflection. The camp museum tells the story of the entire Battle of Singapore through the Japanese occupation. The personal memories of the prisoners come alive through the exhibits.
,,An emotional visit,5.0,,"An emotional visit to this well set up museum as my grandfather was a civilian prisoner at Changi.
We took the MRT to Tanah Merah then the number 2 bus. Asked the bus driver to tell us where to get off. No queue and quite quiet.
Museum is free but well worth paying for audio tour.
Particularly appreciated being able to light a candle for my grandfather, and see his name in the record books.
Had a nice lunch in the cafe afterwards."
,,Fascinating to learn about the history of the area,5.0,,I only called in for a quick look but ended up staying for ages. The history and artifacts surrounding the British and Australian forces with the local population is absolutely fascinating for anybody interested in world war 2 in the region.
,,A check reality,5.0,,I strongly suggest a visit to the museum as it tells you exactly the history of Singapore during the second world war.
,,Remembered in Remembrance Month,4.0,,An informative and moving visit. The audio guide is essential to getting the full picture. Bus 29 stops at the entrance. Took just over 2 hours. Nice and quiet allowing one to take as long as you like. Free entry. SGD$8 for the audio guide.
,,A moving experience,4.0,,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but found the museum to be quite moving. The self guided tour (audio guide recommended for $8.00) will take you through the struggles of people interred by the Japanese during WWII in Singapore.

Many years ago you could see some of the old structure, but that is now gone.

With family members held in Japanese camps in the region this place has special significance for me. If you're a WWII buff you'll find the tour interesting and some of the stories fascinating.

What an amazing hardship for both foreign citizens and military held in such horrific conditions for years!"
,,Extremely moving experience,5.0,,"As a person who's own parent was a POW (in Stanley Prison Hong Kong) during the second world war, the museum and the audio tour was an extremely moving experience. It brought to light the true horrors and hardships of war, and hopefully the lessons learnt and never to be experienced again. A must for history lovers and gives a great insight to the way of life in Singapore during those troubled times."
,,History of the Japanese occupation during WWII,4.0,,"This was an interesting and solemn museum that concentrates on the Japanese occupation of Singapore during WWII and the pow camp.
If your interested in Singapores WWII history I would suggest going to the Battlebox bunker first, which gives a good run down of the events that led to the surrender.
These two museums go hand in hand."
,,A marvelous place to visit at Singapore,4.0,,This is a must visit place atleast require 2 hours to enjoy fully. This Museum is very well maintained and staff are really helpful.
,,Tour Visit,5.0,,Visited as part of a tour. Was very moving and despite having some knowledge of the battle for Singapore the museum also taught us all something new. Make the time to visit you wont be disappointed.
,,Such a profound experience,4.0,,The visit to this museum was as I have said very profound and we should all remember these times so that they may never happen again.
,,A must for your to do list while in Singapore,5.0,,A must to see for every Australian whether or not you had a family member involved in the fall of Singapore. A very moving experience. I suggest allowing 1.5 hours for the visit to allow thorough reading of material on offer.
,,Small but you must visit.,5.0,,"This is a small museum with free entry but you can pay a few dollars to upgrade to an audio tour (well worth it). Lots of exhibits and allow a couple of hours for your visit.
We must remember the sacrifices of others during WWII.
A gem in Singapore."
,,Its ok,3.0,,I'd love to give it a higher rating but there wasn't enough there to merit the long journey out from the centre. We went on the mrt and bus. Be careful about getting off at the right stop as the bus drivers are not too helpful. As soon as you pass the new jail you are almost there.
,,Thought provoking.,5.0,,"We opted to travel privately, with taxi fare $20 each way from Clarke Quay. The lady in the gift shop called the taxi for the return trip.
Very well laid out and formatted presentation, which is enhanced by hiring the audio commentary for $8 per person (this is only available in English)."
,,Visit history of the dark times,4.0,,"Went to visit because of remembrance day, you will get to see a lot of testimonial from old soldiers, Singaporean and POW plus old evidences such as clothes, notes etc that take you back the days during Japanese invasion. Highly recommended if you are interested to that period of history. The museum itself is free admission so the exhibition is a bit small so dont expect something fancy or big scale. Optionally there are tours to take you around SIngapore to see old sites from war times but it cost up to SGD60 per person depends on the length."
,,"Informative and moving, a tribute to all those who fought for freedom",4.0,,"This is worth the trip out from the centre. We took the MRT to Tanah Merah (40 mins). Take bus stop 1 (turn right) after descending the escalator from station. Take the no. 2 bus which runs every 10-15 mins. Bus journey took 20 mins. Have some change for the ride, driver accepted SG$2 but it's slightly more. The museum is free but definitely worth paying the SG$8 for the self-guided audio. Allow 1.5 hrs. We read all the information on all 26 exhibits and it took us 2.5hrs. A lot of the artefacts (photos, love letters, recordings) are very moving which give you a good understanding of the atrocities suffered in Singapore during the 3.5 year Japanese occupation. An excellent museum and testimony to all those who died or suffered in WW2"
,,Piece of Singapore history.,3.0,,An interesting place. So sad that it actually existed. A testament to human strength and endurance. Only small museum remains. RIP.
,,Emotional,4.0,,"This place is very emotional, stories from the inhabitants during the Japanese invasion are moving to read. If you had relatives involved in the invasion or POWs then this is a pilgrimage.Very peaceful and respectful."
,,A moving place,4.0,,"A very moving place , take time to visit , and read and see what really went on in ww2 how could people survive in these conditions"
,,Worth a visit if you are of an age to remember.,4.0,,"We were taken by friends who are residents of Singapore to this musem. Although we were born just after the second world war, my wide and I were very aware of the history of Changi so for us it confirmed are understanding of situations in which Singapore residents had to endure. Very informative. Also, they have a lovely cafe where you can sit and chat with friends."
,,A wonderful educational opportunity,5.0,,"The Changi Museum describes the horrors of war and the occupation of Singapore in the WW11. Very well done both in written descriptions, pictures and headsets. We must forget. Easy to get to on the subway and bus."
,,Out of the way but a must visit!,5.0,,"The museum is free to enter you just pay for the audio set, they are a must to get the most out of your visit. If you are interested in the story of the fall of Singapore this is a must visit site. We got a taxi to the building but a local bus and MTR back into the city. The bus was so cheap and the stop is right by the museum. There is a nice cafe next to the museum for lunch or just coffee. I found the visit very moving and informative."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,It took a long time to get here and I found it to be very superficial. It felt as though all the emotion had been sucked out of the place.
,,Worth a visit and do the tour,4.0,,I really wanted to do this as I like Ve history and had family members here. The tour was well worth it and I made a large donation as well to keep the history alive. It was nice to see so many Singapore people bringing their children to learn the history. I learnt things I didn't know. I would be happy with a choice of 2 tours on being more in depth.
,,Its a bit of a journey but worth it if you are into history,4.0,,"I took bus 2 from my Condo recently to go to Changi Village but ended up getting out at the bus stop in front of this Museum. It was good walk around and draw in the history that surrounds this place.

If you are staying in the CBD or Orchard its a bit of a drive"
,,A moving experience,5.0,,"We visited The Changi Museum and decided to take a guided tour, rather than the audio tour. Catherine, our guide, was amazing and told many stories which brought to life the horrific experience for Singapore and Allied Forces in World War 11. It was not expensive and well worth the visit."
,,Very moving.,4.0,,Well worth the visit. Very moving experience and not overpriced. Take the headsets and listen at your leisure. Quite a small and intimate museum.
,,Very Moving,5.0,,"Went on the tour of Changi Museum and Chapel including a drive past when the Changi jail once was, there is only one wall left. It was a very moving experience where one can reflect on the life our Servicemen had during their internment."
,,Moving Experience,5.0,,Recommend you take MRT to Tampines and then Bus 29 to Changi museum. Bus driver really helpful will tell you when to get off. Got bus number 2 back which took us right back to Clarke Quay our next stop which was an hour journey but saw plenty of city. Bus fare was less than £1 each !!!
,,Interesting but lacking atmosphere.,3.0,,"Visited Changi museumn today . I did not feel that it was half as good as the Battle box tour in that having had to move out of the original prison there was no real atmosphere here despite the information being fairly good but again I felt it was not as concise as the Battle box tour.
Music blaring out of the cafe next to the museumn I thought was totally inappropriate, so we left and went elsewhere for our lunch."
,,Very interesting and thought provoking,4.0,,You can't really come to Singapore and not be aware of the history of Changi jail and the 2nd world war imprisonment of thousands of POWs. This brings the realities of what was entailed into sharp relief
,,A place that you must visit,5.0,,A well present and informed visit ....all of the staff were very knowledgable.... and the guided tour was fantastic
,,Very moving!,4.0,,"Well worth visiting but it's not walking distance from the MRT (cloest stations are Changi airport or Pasir Ris) so will need to bus or drive/taxi there. For a small museum there is lots on display and many of the detailed stories and pictures are very moving so expect to wipe away a tear or two as you read them. Probably need a good 2 hours to really take in everything on display. Some of the guided tours that visit Changi museum take in Johore battery and Changi beach which means less time at the museum - but visiting these places adds another dimension to your museum experience if combined together.

A very sombre and reflective place remembering Singapore's darkest days during WWII and those who paid the ultimate sacrifice. Definitely recommended."
,,Lest we forget,4.0,,A small but well organised museum which tracks Singapore's war history. There are a variety of photos and detailed captions to put you back in time to the 1940s during the Japanese occupation of the city. I believe it is appropriate for adults and children 10 and up. Worth a visit but as it is a fair way out link it with your airport flight as it is only a short taxi ride from there.
,,Changi Museum,5.0,,"A very well presented museum with helpful staff. We spent a couple of hours there at least, as there is so much information. Very illuminating but very sad to see how Singapore and its people were treated during WW2."
,,Very good museum covering the fall of Singapore!,4.0,,Very well laid out with a great variety of artefacts from the era of WWII and the fall of Singapore under the Brits. Lots to see and quite interactive. You will also see some of the exhibits at the Singapore National Museum. Definitely worth a trip here especially when combined with a bumboat trip out to Palau Ubin for a bike ride around the island.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,An emotional snapshot of the horrific conditions the allied POWs endured. Very well worth the trip. Shar (the guide) was 2nd to none. Excellent all round!
,,Place to reflect,5.0,,"The museum is a tribute to all the Service men, women, children and civilians who lost their lives during the 2nd World War Japenese occupation of Signapore. It gives real life accounts of the conditions endured by all and the unique coping stratergies that they developed to try and survive a brutal regime. Well worth a visit if you are interested in past history and should be combined with visits to the Battlebox to get a truer picture of events that ended up shaping the Singapore of today."
,,A must do!,5.0,,"This a definitely a must-do for everyone visiting Singapore. The guide was very informative of the events during WWII from 1941-1945, and it was so interesting learning about the stories from the Singaporean perspective (have only heard from an Australian perspective). Absolutely loved it!"
,,Living the history!,5.0,,"A lesson in ground realities for a generation who have not experienced the horrors of war. Very well organised and lots of information. It is worth taking the audio tour. When we came out of the museum and were sitting in the reconstructed Chapel, it was as though we had gone back in time. Kudos to the organisers! We reached the museum by taxi. It requires at least 3 hours to go through all the exhibits with the audio tour. So preferably plan it in the morning session. The museum closes at 5 pm."
,,Learn the amazing survival story of Commonwealth soldiers under the hands of Japan in World War 2,5.0,,"Imagine, arriving in place for couple of weeks then being imprisoned for around 3-4 years.

This is not an episode of 'Banged Up Abroad' but the story of brave Commonwealth soldiers sent to defend Singapore from Japan as it moved through South East Asia in 1942.

This is in short what happened to Australian Forces.

The Changi Museum tells the plight of brave men enduring brutal captors and how every day counted in taking care of your mates to survive the internment.

As an Australian, this is one of the key places to visit in its Military history.

I had been here in the 90s and it was great introducing some young friends to the story on this visit.

If you're an Australian staying in Singapore make it a point to visit the Museum. You will only need around an hour.

If you're getting a taxi or private car, its within 10mins max to the Airport.

Pay the driver to wait, it is well worth it!

This will make you proud to be an Australian."
,,Must do for Australians,5.0,,"This is an important Museum for all Australians to go to if they are in Singapore. This is part of our history and needs to be remembered.

I thought it could be confronting for my 11 year old son, and gave him to option to leave if he found it too much, but he found it very interesting and moving and ended up spending quite some time reflecting on the exhibits, especially the chapel. It put context to some of the lessons that he had done at school regarding WWII

I would not recommend it for younger children, as they could find it disturbing.

The audio tour is a must as the experience of ex-POWs brings the whole museum to life and makes the experience much more personal and very moving.

We caught the MRT and the number 2 Bus which goes right past the museum, but public transport does take some time. But good to see areas outside of the main CBD."
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"Although it brings back reminders of a time we'd all rather forget, I think it's important to visit such places so that we DO remember the atrocities of war and strive to ensure that this doesn't happen again."
,,A time to reflect and pause,3.0,,"Visited the Changi Museum. Never thought I would get here but made it.

I interviewed my Nana's neighbour a couple of decades ago, who was a Australian POW at the Changi prison who worked on the railway.

So this history has always been of interest.

I am unsure what i was expecting and for some reason may have expected more after reading up on the Changi prison and the Japanese exploits during the war.

The Museum is informative and worth a visit.

There is an area in the mock up chapel to light a candle in memory of loved ones and relatives who may have served or been a POW. So I paid tribute to Mr Gordon A Sutton QX14137 who helped me as a young teenager answer the questions I had about being a POW. A sense of closure and to remember him for his service and sacrifice.

Photos cannot be taken inside - I would have perhaps thought that the opportunity to take photos should be afforded given persons travel from afar to pay their respects. Whilst appreciating people visit to reflect and pause on the exploits of war and humanity, an opportunity to take some pics would have been appreciated.

There are also audio tours available for a charge to walk through the small Museum.

Need an hour at least to peruse the information boards etc on offer.

We visited via local tourism tours that can be booked. I perhaps was a little disappointed at the pricing and what was on offer at the museum.

In saying that, if you're interested in the WWII history and that of the Changi prison, then it's definitely worth a visit.

Lest We Forget"
,,Must see,5.0,,My husband and I visited the changi museum and it is definitely a must see. Very informative about what went on during the war
,,Changi museum,5.0,,We have just usuted and it was a great insight into to life as a POW we then had lunch at the bark cafe onsight and the service experience was excellent - can recommend doing the waffles with fruit and berries and Ice cream 😀
,,To the end this memory will remain,4.0,,"We made our own way to Changi Museum on the MRT East West line to Tanah Merah and the No 2 bus. The Museum is a quiet reflection of World War 2 POW life and Japanese occupation of the island. The museum has a collection of paintings, photographs and personal effects donated by former inmates. Among the collection is a series of paintings and sketches by a POW which provide valuable insight on the daily life of the internees during the occupation. May this memory never die as it is a lasting reminder of sheer brutality of mankind. Allow half a day for the round trip from your hotel in downtown Singapore. Whilst in this area a visit to Changi Beach for a stroll and lunch is worthwhile."
,,Changi Museum,5.0,,Great place to visit. As previous reviews use the audio tour. Catherine at the desk was very helpful in finding my Dad's old neighbours history as he was on the Burma railway. Very helpful.
,,Bit disappointing,3.0,,"Was really looking forward to this tour, but was a bit disappointed, as did not have very long at the museum itself to look around.
Visited several other sites on the way, my friend and I got the impression from the guide that it was all the British fault for the fall of Singapore. Perhaps because we was the only British on the tour and the rest were Australian !
Expected to spend much longer at the museum to look around at the exhibits but probably only spent 45 mins at the most there.
The guide was very informative, but would of been nice to spend more time exploring on our own"
,,Small but very interesting.,4.0,,"We visited this as part of a tour, we stopped off for 1 hr, this was just enough time.
The prison is still in use, so obviously you can't visit that, there is only a small piece of the original prison wall remaining ( this is shown on a tour)
If you are doing family research there is a book with names of the prisoners to look at.
A piece of History that must never be forgotten !!"
,,Singapore History and Remembering the Fallen,5.0,,"When the Japanese invaded Singapore they incarcerated the surrendering soldiers, murdered many Singapore citizens, and used many of both as slave labor.

The Japanese Commanding General Tomoyki Yamashita would later be hanged for his war crimes committed here and in the Philippines, particularly the Sook Ching massacres.

This Museum and Chapel is a remembrance shrine to those who died or who suffered during World War II. You will be able to learn much about the citizens and soldiers of Singapore and their courage and sacrifices under very difficult circumstances.

I really enjoyed visiting this museum and it is a wonderful opportunity to learn about the history of Singapore."
,,Hair raising,5.0,,Get a feel of history at this surreal museum which was once a prison. The simple layout can be deceiving as the information it gives is just hair raising and eye-opening.
,,I have been here twice,5.0,,"I first visited here with my fiancee, it is somewhere you should visit, it does send a chill up your spine, last month I took my 15 year old son, his only just old enough to be able to cope with the stories pictures and artifacts you will see here, bus's run past, head on to Changi open air food hall for a real taste of Singapore with the locals. you have more bus services and taxis here to get back to your hotel"
,,A solem place,5.0,,"My wife and I booked a tour which we meet at an SMRT station and the bus took us around the Changi precinct and to the museum, I was shocked to find out that you cannot actually visit the Changi prisoner of war camp from the 2nd world war as it is still a working prison but you can see the main gates and the walls from the road. The museum is well worth visiting and it really does show the cruelty of the Japanese in war, there are many stories that you can read of the sad fate of some and saviours who kept the survivors going. I was moved to tears by the sadness of the events that took place from the punishment for listening to a secret radio which was to have chopsticks placed in your ears and then rammed through the persons ear drums or being locked in the hole. A very moving and interesting display of the events that took place there."
,,Out of the way but worth it.,5.0,,"Get the audio tour, it makes all the difference. It's a bit out of the way but it's a subway from city hall then onto the 29 bus right to the door. Easy."
,,Changi Museum,4.0,,A bus stop is located within 50m of the museum making it an easy destination to get to and from. Audio guide available at a very reasonable cost. Well laid out and organised. Café and restroom available. Knowledgeable and friendly staff. Not suitable for young children. Recommended.
,,Moving exhibition,5.0,,I was shocked to realise that so much happened in Singapore during WW2. The British army collapsed and POWs were put into the prison along with ex pats. This place tells the story very well and leaves you with much to reflect on and a sense of hope because even in the cruellest of environments the human spit I can prevail.
,,A must do if you are interested in the history of Singapore,5.0,,Very interesting and moving experience. I wouldn't recommend this to families with small children because people take there own time to listen to the commentary and look at the displays and children wouldn't appreciate this. If you are a history buff this a must do.
,,A thoroughly enjoyable visit,5.0,,"Two couples, (one late 40s, one in their 60s) different expectations, but all came away appreciating the terror of war. We all thoroughly enjoyed the tour, came away feeling very sad for what the prisoners had gone through, but knowing the sacrifices they had made. A heart rending tour and worthy of a visit."
,,The peaceful place to learn history,5.0,,Is a beautiful place with rich history of singapore. No one should miss this place if you want to know more history during the WW2. There is bark cafe next to it. To get there. Catch a North East line yrain heading to pasir ris. Alight at Tanah merah. Take bus no 2 which is heading to changi village. Alight somewhere after the main gate of changi prison. Not sure. Ask the friendly bus captain to remind you when about to reach. After the visit. You can continue to take the bus and end the trip at the last stop which is the bus terminal. You can find local eatries and enjoy the beach after the meal.
,,Poignant but not enough info,3.0,,"It is true there are some powerful stories and images at Changi Museum but I was expecting much more. Having visited Hiroshima Museum and Auschwitz and having really walked away from them both with a clear picture of the history, the chronology and the stories...I left Changi Museum with a hazy picture of all of those. I just wished there was more in depth information, more in depth stories, more in depth images and that it was set up in a more ordered fashion.
It is primarily a whole lot of 3 or 4 line different quotes from different people which never really seemed to form a clear narrative and left me wanting more.
I appreciated the chapel and the art from the POWs but really felt disappointed upon leaving...I was looking to see where the proper museum was...I thought this was just a 'lead up' room."
,,A very moving experience,5.0,,"This is one thing that I wanted to do as my grandfather had been a prisoner of war, held here for the duration, after Singapore fell to the Japanese. We needed to take the train and then a local bus. It took about half the day but I was so glad to have seen the museum and chapel. A very moving experience for me."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,Anyone who know the history of Singapore knows about Changi. Beautifully displayed and very moving with recorded eye witness accounts. It's a must see!
,,A detailed insight into Singapore's hisotry,4.0,,"It is difficult to get to, but well worth the effort. I chose not to have the audio tour, and still found it very informative. Many artifacts and insights into what life was like during war time. 60-90 minutes is all you would need. It's a small museum but still contains plenty of information.

Note that no photography is allowed inside."
,,Rememberance,5.0,,Our last day in Singapore found this museum mrt and a bus ride a really good find for history lovers some truly amazing stories of pow's
,,Lest we forget!,5.0,,"Get the mrt to Tanah Merah and then the number 2 bus which will drop you off right outside. We owe these guys and girls so much and to think it was only 70 years ago! Kept in pristine condition, it's a really humbling and moving experience. Instead of going to another shopping plaza, take the time to visit. It's open every day and it's free to enter!"
,,Quite difficult to get to but worth it,4.0,,The museum is quite difficult to get to with a trip on the MRT and then a bus. On arrival it is not at the original site of the prison itself as the prison is still functioning and is quite small.That said it was interesting and the audio guide was well worth it. All in all it is a visit worth doing but probably not for young adults.
,,Extremely poignant,5.0,,"Built to commemorate the brave prisoners of Changi who had to endure horrific cruelty from the evil, occupying Japanese in WWII. Changi Prison Chapel is a replica of the chapel that was erected by Australian prisoners. More than 50,000 civilians as well as British, Australian and other nationality soldiers were imprisoned in Changi. Even though the original chapel was dismantled and dispatched to Australia, there is a replica chapel that was built in 1988. There are many paintings, letters, drawings and photographs that depict the pain and torment of the prisoners. One of its most poignant displays is the ‘Changi Murals’ that include a series of paintings based on Biblical themes by Stanley Warren, a British airman. These murals were finished using limited materials such as camouflage paint, crushed snooker chalk and aircraft paints. There is also a Brass Cross made of spent ammunition casings, from soldiers' guns. Most of the museum’s exhibits were donated by former prisoners of war and their families. It really is a must see place to go if visiting Singapore and the commentary headphones are very useful."
,,"So emotional and moving, full of incredible artifax.",5.0,,"We visited here as we had a cousin die after being captured by the Japs. When you walk around and read what happened in this terrible place, You cant imagine how anyone could treat their fellow humans this way. Every youngster should be told what happened there. We were asked by the museum supervisor if we needed help and she then researched our cousin, giving us new and vital information on his location and possible death. Thank you so much"
,,moving and informative,5.0,,"A bit of an effort to get here, however worth the exercise. happened to luck out with a guided tour with only 2 of us as we were the first there. Close to tears at places but in awe of the bravery of the prisoners. A must see for anyone with an interest in history."
,,Interesting Museum,3.0,,"We went out to this museum situated on the edge of the currently Changi jail to learn more out the history. The museum is full of artefacts. We purchased audio guides which had detailed explanations. However entry to the museum is free. It only takes an hour to listen to, read about and look at all the exhibits."
,,Emotional but enjoyable,5.0,,This was our second visit to the Changi War Museum and it was just as emotional this time as the last. You can walk and read at your leisure. There is also audio equipment available to use. The chapel is simple yet moving. Well worth a visit. There are tours that go there but we went by taxi so we had plenty of time there.
,,"A ""must see"" if you are visiting Singapore",5.0,,"A very close uncle of mine was captured in the fall of Singapore in 1942. He was imprisoned at Changi before being sent to Thailand to spend three years laboring on the construction of the death railway. He survived the war but it had such a traumatic effect that he was never able to talk much about it. In the little bits I gleaned, however, the horror of it came through and i have since learnt much more through reading and visiting sites like this. What took place was truly horrific and although the topic is not pleasant, it is nevertheless highly interesting to hear the stories and see how people could survive, although many, of course, did not. As a starter the sheer numbers tell there own story with 15000 prisoners being forced into a prison that was built for 3,400.

As time goes by it is important that people, especially the youth of today, do not forget what happened here so that they can ensure that it never happens again.

If you're visiting Singapore this museum is a must see and very much worth the visit."
,,Changi Museum Visit,5.0,,A must see when in singapore.. It tears your heart out when you hear the stories and read the history of what happened here. It makes you realise how truly lucky we are not to have to suffer the way those who lived in that time did.
,,Hidden treasure of history,4.0,,"This is a re-creation of the original Changi Prison that housed many POWs during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. While some in my group commented that it was ""too new"", I felt otherwise. Look past the white paint and nice wooden benches to get a feel of history of the place.

It is a solemn place, as the docent told us. Take your time to go through the exhibits, each is one of a kind, donated by the families of those who were interned there. Feel the sadness and the pain. Appreciate their sense of humour despite the deplorable conditions. Emerge richer for the experience.

Visitors from western countries will appreciate the place dedicated to their war dead. But I think Japanese visitors will find this place a shock to their system because this part of history is not taught in their schools. Regardless, it is an important place to visit, to learn and feel.

This place is accessible by public bus and a short walk. You will need about 2-3 hours to fully cover this place."
,,Small museum,3.0,,"This happened to be the museum that got my kid interested in World War II. It was a small museum with displays only. No interactive stuff. If you happen to be in the area, do visit.

We stayed in a Sentosa hotel and took a 30-minute cab ride to the museum. Was a bit disappointed to find it so small."
,,All visitors should venture out to Changi and visit to remember the hardships,5.0,,"Took the MRT to Tenah Mareh and then the number 2 bus to the museum which was quiet. It was peaceful and you were able to reflect on the experiences of POWs and the islanders during the War. Felt it was important that my pre-teen children visited to give them a contrast between modern day and what has gone before.

The audio sound guide enabled you to immerse yourself in the stories. Free entry and a small charge for the audio guides."
,,Full of History,4.0,,The chapel museum is the place where you come and learn about Singapore's history during WWII era. Renting an audio guide and walking around the museum takes you back to the time when war is coming and experience the struggle of the Singaporean.
,,War Museum,5.0,,allow a couple of hrs here as there is a lot to read or you can hire headphones for $8 well worth it if you don't like a lot of reading. it is well set out and entry is free. they also have a gift shop with books on the war. there is a great cafe on the premises with great food and about the same sort of prices as anywhere else. unfortinatly you can't take photos or video in there but it is definatly worth a visit
,,Great War history museum,4.0,,Get her by MRT and then bus- driver will tell you when to get off. Museum straight across road from the bus stop. Headphones are $8 each to hire or you can just read the walls. Entrance is free. Doesn't have all the fancy props like the National Museum but it's interesting and not crowded at all. Probably need about 1-1 1/2 hours to walk round with the headset.
,,War Museum,3.0,,"This didn't quite live up to my expectations, i was expecting to see more. Also the day we went it was extremely hot so no way could we sit at the outside restuarant for lunch."
,,Everybody should visit at least once,4.0,,"We went here on our round island tour, tour was brief but allowed enough time to read all the photo cards/boards, very informative, could be much bigger though as it is quite a small museum. We took our children ranging in age from 8-15 and they appreciated the sombre mood as it is very quiet in the museum as they read and viewed all the objects."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Changi museum. It gave me as an Australian a different perspective on Singapore during WWII, and added to my knowledge of Aust War history."
,,Quite an insight,4.0,,"I took my 12 year old son here as he had been studying WWII in school and he really appreciated it. It is not a very interactive museum and quite small but packed with information and given the compelling message my son read every panel in details, taking in the details about the war, the life of prisoners during the war, and the plight of many people here. Not a light day out but worth coming to see."
,,A real piece of history,5.0,,Just go and witness this. Its a real feature of Singapore's history and its got some tragic stories of such unnecessary suffering.
,,A humbling experience,5.0,,"Our family visited here a few days ago, to pay tribute to an uncle who survived Changi POW camp. His brother in law died in a battle in Malaya. I don’t know, who of the two were better off. The family at home did not have the luxury of the instant communications we enjoy today, so it was years before they knew anything.
On the subject of luxury, we enjoyed an air-conditioned tour and comfortable amenities. I felt humbled and sad, almost hypocritical.
We were enthusiastically greeted at the door by Catherine who is passionate about her tours. To be honest it was hard to absorb it all, and on another visit to Singapore I would most definitely have a return visit, if nothing else, to pay my respects.
This museum shows visitors the horror, the injustice and man’s cruelty to man. The story is starkly told. Catherine told us as much as she could in a one hour tour and told us that she could talk about this subject all day. Indeed her narrative often brought tears to my eyes and then she would slip in a little bit of ironic humor and I could just take a deep breath and move along to the next display.
I encourage anyone to visit here, especially Defense Force personnel/family, as we were. Or as baby boomers as we are, also.
Thank you Catherine for a moving experience. It added a different dimension to a beautiful Singapore visit."
,,Changi Museum,3.0,,"Did the Changi Museum 2 years ago. Was a little dissapointed with it. Don't get me wrong! There are things there to see and a audio tour, but, I thought it was a little lacking considering the enormity of what happened there."
,,Great museum,5.0,,Really worth the visit especially for Aussies. Small museum but jam packed with good quality displays and information. Catch bus number 2 from stand 1 from outside tanah merah station. Takes you straight to the door of the museum. We had lunch at the restaurant next door and that was good.
,,Disappointing museum,3.0,,"I have always wanted to come and see what I understood as a replica of the Changi POW camp. This tiny museum that holds valuable information on the history of the hardships of what the men endured just seems to only skim the surface of information. Having a great interest in the history of the war, a result of my father's involvement I found today's visit disappointing!"
,,Excellent encapsulation of the WWII experience in Singapore,5.0,,"I spent a good 3+ hours here. Even though it's a small museum, the photos and stories that you can listen to on audio or read on the walls are absolutely shocking and moving. If you are interested in the history of WWII, you won't want to miss this spot. I didn't realize how many people had died in Singapore during the Japanese occupation here from 1942 - 1945."
,,Touching history,5.0,,"An impressive story of the war, hardships and humanity; great for everyone with genuine interest in the world and Asia history."
,,Emotional visit,5.0,,Worth visiting. Found it a very emotional place thinking/seeing/sharing what people have been through (including members of my family)
,,Small museum but packed with history,5.0,,"I think it should be called a Memorial rather than a museum as the makeshift church there and the items within the museum are actually in memory of the prisoners who suffered during Singapore's Japanese occupation. Relatives of those who suffered or died, most of them Westerners from the UK or Australia still come and leave touching notes. Man's resilience in the face of hopelessness is exemplified as you see how the community within the walls came together to help each other with secret messages sown into quilts and Engineers, Teachers, etc tried to keep things humming and give some semblance of normalcy where there was none to be had."
,,Last minute visit,3.0,,We got to the Changi airport early for our flight home so decided to put our luggage in left luggage and catch a cab to the museum as it was only a short taxi ride away. My husband found it more interesting than I did as there is not a lot of good things to hear or read about. I did know the history already so this visit reinforced and exbanded on what we already knew. The personal stories were worth hearing. You get a talking device to listen to that can be used by two people. I am not sure I would have visited it if we were not near by but as we were not sorry we spent an hour here. I think if we had visited the actual site and the war graves it might have meant more.
,,Very interesting piece of Singapore history post war during Japanese occupation.,5.0,,"Off the beaten track but worth a visit. Tells the stories of ex pats who didn't make it out before the surrender to the Japanese, and were imprisoned here. The stories of the women particularly interesting."
,,Great piece of history.,5.0,,Great place to learn about the history and occupation of Japan during WW2. Expect to spend 1-3 hrs depending on how keen you are.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,The Changi Prison is definitely worth a visit. It gives you a lot of insight of the Japanese occupation and history of Singapore. The audio guide is worth the 8 dollar. Only downside is that there is no cell from the old prison anymore.
,,Out of town - but well worth the taxi ride,5.0,,"This is just a beautifully presented museum. It's free to explore and soak up the history (or pay small fee for audio commentary). Some areas will bring tears, others a smile. Spent about 1.5 hours here, then a coffee at the Bark Café to reminisce and share insights. Just wonderful."
,,Flash Back of WWII,4.0,,"If you are into history especially the WW II, then Changi Museum won't disappoint you.
There you will see old photographs of the POW during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, including letters and documents during that periods.

You can easily spend 2 hours or more at the museum and there is also a little open air chapel.

Visitors can also take a 45-minute guided In-House tours (in English) around the site."
,,Brutality of the Japanese occupation of Singapore,3.0,,"Came here recently for another visit, the last one being around 10 years ago. Photos aren't permitted inside the museum, but it's worth taking time to walk through and read the poignant stories of the victims of the Japanese occupation of Singapore in WWII. It's a little unfortunate that none of the original cells of Changi Prison were preserved to really give a clear reminder of actual conditions. But this is still a well designed museum with its sad history. Definitely worth a visit."
,,interesting,4.0,,can easily spend three or fours hours at this place and takes about half a day to complete at leisure
,,At last we made it!,5.0,,We have wanted to visit this Museum for years but never had the time.Its well worth the journey and should be combined with Fort Siloso and the Battlebox to complete your war time tour.
,,Sombre experience,5.0,,A good museum and worth the trip during a visit to Singapore. Looking past just numbers and dates in a history book to shed light on the real effect war had on the people of Singapore and the prisoners during the Japanese occupation. Very respectful and simple.
,,A poignant narrative,5.0,,"This is a really informative museum providing some though-provoking stories of WW2. The layout is good and allows the exhibits to tell the story. Definitely worth a visit to learn more about this period of history and how it affected Singapore. Easily accessible, only a short taxi ride from the airport, and accessible by bus."
,,A feel for history and a short ride to Changi village,4.0,,"Took a taxi because it was mid afternoon when we decided to go and there is no direct public transport (must transfer from train to bus) and were advised this would take at least an hour. Museum is not large but does a good job communicating the Changi prison story thru many personal mementos and stories. We used the headsets which were an oral version of the printed information with a few extras. I was touched seeing letters written by a prisoner and his family members with an address within blocks of my own home. We had seen some of the material at the Singapore Museum but that did not take away from our visit My only disappointment, and that was only due to not knowing better, was there was nothing left of the original prison but a prison doors and small items so it was hard to get a sense of scale. I was also surprised to see how close it was to Chengi prison and residences. Afterwards we crossed the street to the bus stop and took a short bus ride into Chengi Village which was a pleasant change from the hustle and bustle of Orchard Rd, etc. Nice park and walking path along the shoreline. Plenty of eating opportunities. A place were real people live. Good bus service from the Village to the train into the city."
,,Worth visiting for WW 2 history !,5.0,,"Its a small museum detailing the accounts of Singapore under Japanese occupation during World War II. There was much information about how Singapore fell, its defenders, stories of heroes. Very touching ! Set in a peaceful area not far from Changi Prison. It was not easy to find because there weren't any clear signs along the bus route. I stopped at the Changi Prison and had to ask several people for directions to get there."
,,Visit,5.0,,We had a look around and it is quite a lot to take in thinking that people can be like that to everyone.The people who work here are really lovely and even looked up a relative that was in the prison and gave as much information as they could.
,,A respectful museum.,5.0,,This museum was interesting and respectful with a detailed story of the past. It had a great headset audio tour that had lots of information and heaps of photos to go with it. The museum was easy to walk around and had a cafe and small gift shop. Worth a visit
,,Go!,5.0,,Guides knowledge was awesome and worth the trip.Stunning and so worth the cost of entry. Hire the headset
,,Amazing piece of history,5.0,,"Amazing piece of history, very interesting and insightful. Very peaceful . Worth a visit but is a little out of the way."
,,Educate your self,5.0,,Bars and birds - well have fun but you will miss the history of this country and what happened here in WWII. Most poinant a letter from a Japanese woman apologizing on behalf of her father and what he did while stationed here - a place of healing.
,,Changi Jail Chapel,5.0,,"A fascinating collection of artefacts, with good storyboards in a peaceful setting. The Chapel's murals and the personal stories were very moving."
,,a small museum that must be visited,4.0,,I am of an age to have met Far East PoWs and felt I had to visit Changi Museum my wife accompanied me. The museum is relatively small but well laid out. The notes in cabinets were simple and in many cases poignant. My wife was moved to tears during the visit.
,,Very Small,3.0,,"This museum is very small and it will only take you about an hour to go through it. Basically two rooms with lots of reading and photos. With all that went on during the Second World War I would have thought that the Singapore government would invest a little bit more money into making something more world class and a remembrance to the people that suffered during the war. Very disappointing. A lot of money is spent on theme parks, why not on history."
,,Must See,5.0,,A lot of reading I have visited twice - very informative worth a visit with a guide or on your own. .
,,Nice and peaceful place,4.0,,"Nice quiet peaceful church and museum. A place to understand/ reflect on the lives of POWs locked away in Singapore during World War II. A place to understand Singapore history better. Note: place can be warm at times. Time needed is about 90mins, descriptive audio headphones available for rental."
,,The disappointing visit,2.0,,"The Museum & Chapel are combined,The WW2 POW camp is series of photo,s and memobrilla mounted on the wall of the chapel, record of the various armed services involved is also on the wall to view.With out a guide giving commentary it is quite a task to read and sort out the poorly marked photo;s trying to bring them line with the script! Audio headphones is available at a cost. We felt that the terrible cost of life and cruelty has been sadly been lost with this condensed display,our tour guide spoke about the display on the way to the Museum, by the time we arrive at the Museum, the commentary was in-effective!
The cost is quite reasonable, But be prepared to be a bit dissappointed"
,,Hugely disappointing. Might as well be located in a more accessible location.,1.0,,"This is a grossly misleading ""attraction"" because you don't actually visit the WW2 prison at all and in fact catch only a glimpse of the front gate if you are lucky. Now I understand the original has been demolished but at least they could have allowed visitors to get close to the section of original wall and front gate that still remains. Instead this museum consists mostly of recreated chapels and a few photographs.

I have been to many such sites around the world and most are quite moving. I had visited the Battle Box on my previous trip to Singapore so I was familiar with the story of the fall of Singapore and the plight of the POWs. I felt badly cheated by this one having paid S$60 for a tour. If you want to go better to make your own way by SMT or a taxi from downtown if there are 2 or 3 of you. Better yet, save your money and go to The Battle Box which is terrific."
,,Not the Original!,3.0,,"Ok, let me preface this by saying, I knew that the original location or Changi Prison had been taken back by the Prisons Commission of Singapore, however, I thought that original artefacts would have been preserved, and there would be more acknowledgment of the prison itself as a structure to really show how people lived when there. I was horrified to learn differently. I had family friends interred at Changi and feel like their history has been erased. It is worth a small trip to learn about the history of you don't know it, but if you know a lot about the history, you may be really disappointed."
,,Excellent & Informative,5.0,,The museum is well laid out and the displays are very informative and well done. The museum informs about a part of WWII history I had not really been familiar with and I found it to be most interesting.
,,Go. You need to go.,3.0,,"This place is not a joyous experience, but it is an important one. The museum offers some very nice insights and the chapel was a very nice memorial to the horrors of the place. A very good museum, but most of the exhibits are 2D -- not very interactive but very informative."
,,Japanese Occupation Days,4.0,,"Visited Changi Chapel and Museum today. It's located in the little quiet part of Eastern Singapore, near to the Airport.

This place showcases the ugly side of WWII and the suffering the people taken during Japanese Occupation. The museum prohibits camera and video photography.

Little chapel also illustrates the remembrance of those who suffered and died during the WWII, also remembering those who managed to survived through God's will.

An hour to complete the site."
,,Bit of History,5.0,,"You need places like this to give you perspective in life! Great visit here, do the audio tour up get more info that way."
,,A glimpse into the past,5.0,,This museum is a stark reminder of the horrors of the Second World War in Singapore. It is however well worth a visit as the exhibition is well laid out and and thought provoking. It is an enduring reminder of mans inhumanity to man. I found it to be serene and very moving.
,,Honouring those that fought,4.0,,We took the option to not do the museum as part of a tour as we were really only interested in visiting the museum and not the add-ons. There are standard buses that run every 15 minutes but they take 90 minutes there and back and at a push the museum only takes a hour to go around. So rather than spend 3 hours on a bus for a 1 hour visit we chose to go by taxi. We have no complaints with the cabs who took the most direct route costing us $22 SGD and $20 SGD respectively in 20 minutes. The museum is a tribute to the fortitude of men and women under Japanese occupation in WWII. It is uncomplicated and treats the history with respect. There is no entry fee and the cost of the audio hire is a mere $8 SGD. If you get there right on 9:30 you will miss the buses which seemed to start coming around 10:30. Worth the visit.
,,History of Singapore,4.0,,"small quirky museum to learn about the ANZUK (Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom) forces during the World Wars in Singapore. There are some multimedia interaction, please behave when visiting. An hour is enough to cover the museum.

There is a small cafe BARK CAFE just next to it, serves cold beer and local delights."
,,Soul searching war memorial,5.0,,"We pre-booked this visit with Viator as a round the Island tour encompassing this within the Kranji war memorial stop, Whilst the arrangements by the Tour Company were excellent, there was insufficient time to fully explore and read the detailed information provided and was in part due to the time wasting aspect associated with the Bright Hill Temple inclusion (more under that heading).
The war memorial was as many have already witnessed in other countries, a reminder of the numbers of people who died, were mal-treated and the actual account of how Singapore fell to the Japanese.
If this historical episode interests you, you would be better getting public transport/taxi so that the time spent would be at your desire and not artificially controlled. Remember that the cost varies according to taxi colour and in ascending order the cheapest is blue/yellow, then maroon and lastly grey, with limos the highest. The underground is very clean, signs in English and very cheap.
The museum itself is well laid out and contains interesting facts clearly displayed on boards throughout, quotes from residents and soldiers and an opportunity to purchase books associated with the occupation of Singapore. The artefacts on display, demonstrate man's ingenuity in adverse conditions to exist, and make one marvel at the spirit of those affected as well as the atrocities mankind can inflict on each other.
Not a visit for young children, but a window on the horrors of war."
,,A very moving experience,5.0,,This was a fantastic tour. Be prepared as it is a very emotional experience. Allow a couple of hours as there is a lot to see and read as well as listening to the audio tour. One of the best things I did in Singapore and definitely the most meaningful.
,,The Changi Museum,5.0,,A poignant and very important reminder of what happened when the Nippon Army overrun Singapore in 1942 and put 3000 non-Singaporeans into Changi Prison including many husbands and wives. This museum is well worth a visit.
,,Interesting but not mandatory,3.0,,"Its worth a visit if your in singapore for a long stretch but be prepared to do a lot of reading. There is some exhibits, but essentially i found the musuem to be more of a memorial.
Dont take my opinion as a negative - if your into war history etc it is interesting and you could spend 3-4 hours in there, but the casual tourist will probably give it an hour before loosing interest."
,,Interesting visit,4.0,,As a person who has an interest in ww2 history I found the Changi Museum informative. We went on a tour which didn't give us a lot of time to read through all of the information in the museum. I would go again but at my own pace so that I can spend more time there.
,,Historical showpiece,4.0,,"The information are well documented and presented. Easy to browse and appreciate the artifacts. A small charming chapel like museum, the murals is a masterpiece"
,,Small but interesting,4.0,,"A small Museum dedicated to to prisoners of WWII, Many sad stories but certainly worth a visit to see how hard it was for not only the locals but all the allied forces."
,,Incredibly moving,5.0,,"The incredible story of mans inhumanity to man. A moving story of Changi in WW2, the lives of those that lived through the attrociities committed and the resilience of the human spirit."
,,Very historic,4.0,,"Do spend the time to hire the audio guide it makes it very interesting, otherwise all the reading can get tortuous. But it is fascinating and opens your eyes. We came away very saddened!"
,,well worth a visit,4.0,,we visited this museum because of loosing a relative in Singapore ww2 this museum is well laid out with audio for a small charge loads of pictures great for anyone to visit staff helpful. We were told this isn't a museum that locals visit as they don't like to remember the past as such which is a shame.
,,A Piece of Singapore's History,4.0,,"This is my second visit to this museum. It was originally sited at the Changi prison compound back relocated. The museum is free to visit and no photography allowed.

The displays in this museum explained the background of the prison from civilian to POW then to civilian again. It also showed displays of the the POWs that were locked in this prison during the Japanese occupation of Singapore.

There were 2 evoking piece of history that marked the visit worthy. The Force 136, and the volunteers that help the POWs to survive the war."
,,Humbling but well worth the visit,5.0,,"Went to Changi whilst in Singapore for a weekend. I would recommend this for anyone who has an interest in World War II history as a must see. I would recommend for others to take the tour to understand the historical significant of the relevant fall of Singapore and what the Singapore people experienced and the overall issues faced by the relevant soldiers who were interned there.
I would highly recommend the visit."
,,Loads of history,5.0,,"History of Prisoner of War well laid out in museum, many stories told thru pictures and tour guide. Can walk thru independently with personal walkie talkies or just on your own. All prisoner of war names are written up in books on premises."
,,Learned lots of information from this visit,4.0,,Great time here the staff were helpful and recommend the audio tour for $8SGD without it much of the valuable stories would be missed. A bit long winded to get there but worth it.
,,Very sobering and enlightening,4.0,,"I spent about 2 hours here and used the audio tour. The audio tour was OK but most of the info could just be read from the detailed information boards, (so long as you can read English ... there were no other languages).
The actual exhibits were interesting and well laid out but would not entertain kids."
,,brings you back to earth,5.0,,"such an emotional experience having learnt a lot about Changi from my dad it was a
must to actually visit and so glad i did.
Its a very sobering look into history shed more than a few tears reading some of the accounts from prisoners and guards alike.

LEST WE FORGET"
,,First time visit after many SG trips..,5.0,,"The title of my review adds to the guilt of not going sooner. I can in all honesty say that this visit, as an Australian moved me more than most other things I have visited in the past.

Do the guided tour, Shah (spelling is probably not right!) was fantastic and you can feel his passion in all the emotional stories he tells...I could have spent a full day taking in all the knowledge he has.

In short...this ain't Disneyland but a good presentation of stories that we all need to hear...fantastically orated by Shah and despite the tragic nature of the circumstances, many of the stories leave you feeling proud of the the selflessness often expressed by others.

Well Done!"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,An emotional experience although the building is a little disappointing. Great history with authentic exhibits
,,History we grew up with,4.0,,"Growing up in Australia, we well knew the story of the Changi prisoner of war camp and the extreme deprivation and cruelty which were a hallmark of this camp. What we didn't know was the extent of the camp and the vast number of nationalities involved. To see the loss and sacrifice of the other nations in this camp was moving. The museum very tastefully outlines what happened during this dark part of our shared history, and the impact it had on a lot of people. Whilst not situated on the original site, the museum serves to show what the camp was like and commemorates those that contributed to the way of life in the camp. For anyone who enjoys history, it is a very good place to visit. We travelled to Tampanes MRT station, then caught the number 29 bus to Changi Prison stop. Very easy."
,,A time for reflection,5.0,,"This is a must visit place in Singapore for any one who has been exposed in any way to , or had family connections with, the Japanese invasion of Singapore and the privation of the Changi incarceration of POW's from many nations particularly Australia. The exhibitions are excellent ...and very moving !"
,,"SIMPLE, INTERESTING, MOVING",4.0,,This is a small museum set out in a fairly simple manner with interesting exhibits showing aspects of life (and death) in Singapore during the Japanese occupation in WW2. Visiting this museum I found to be quite a moving experience.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"I found my visit informative and interesting but the actual building was a bit disappointing
The original prison no longer exists so the museum is housed in a small chapel.
It's a self guided tour with headphones and a recorded commentary for S$8 or S$6 to share between 2
It's easy enough to get there, take the MRT to Tanah Merah then catch the #2 bus to the museum, ask the bus driver to let you know when you get there.
I don't think that it's promoted or as funded as it should be, for an important historical location. Such a shame. Probably would be even more interesting if some of the original prison was still there"
,,Worth to Visit of you are interested in War History,5.0,,"A bit of a way out, next to Changi Airport in the well to do suburb of Changi. Just past the Singapore Prison. If you can perhaps go upon your arrival or on your way back to the airport. Though we enjoyed travelling the trains then a taxi to get there. For us we knew most of the history. But fabulous to get the Singaporean peoples involvement in the occupation. The outside chapel is wonderful and gave a full sense of appreciation living in such heat 24/7. $12 for a shared headphone. Otherwise free."
,,intense,5.0,,I have relatives who were in Changi Prison in the War and this was a very emotional visit for me but one every Australian should do
,,"Amazing, Educational, History a must to see & hear",5.0,,"I was not sure about visiting i thought it may be depressing ! how wrong was I, it was amazing!!!!!! this infact was one of the best thing i did on the holiday to Singapore. The Audio was brilliant some people told us they just read what was on the pictures, and it gave them the same details. Wrong, the audio information was very real, and had real depth to what was said about what happened in this war.
I will go again, on my next trip."
,,very full on but needed for a greater understanding,4.0,,The museum is small but has a lot of stories of POWs and others from the war. It is fantastic to see it well maintained. However reading the stories is quite full on. It is an important part of understanding of what POWs were going through back then.
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"My farther was caught by the Japanese’s. We were looking at records and Catherine came by and she was very friendly, helpful and we learnt so much about my father which we are indebted to Catherine could not learnt so much without Catherine’s assistance.

Great memorable visit went into chapel light a candle, posted a card, and walked slowly around the museum very informative.

We went ourselves and travelled there by MRT and bus and at end visit went into the adjacent restaurant.

A must"
,,Fascinating insight into WW2 History of Singapore,4.0,,"Decided to stop here before we were due at the airport for our flight, and certainly didn't regret it. A very good museum filled with detailed accounts of the area during WW2 as well as artefacts. Eye opening to an area that you often don't hear about and to the suffering of Singaporeans during the period. Would highly recommend a visit."
,,An informative Memory,4.0,,We took the bus from Bugis (about 50 minutes)to visit this small museum which had been recommended to us at a Far East Prisoner of War conference. Entry is free but we elected to purchase an audio tour for S$12. The museum covers the fall of Singapore during WW2 and gives an excellent perspective of how the civilian and ex-Pat population was adversely affected by the cruel events that ensued. There is a chapel as part of the museum and a small shop. There are lots of photos and interesting artifacts. Look out for the quilt made by female Pows and sent to the men's camp and which contains coded messages. There is a cafe adjacent to the museum. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Informative and Thought Provoking,4.0,,"A real eye opener. I thought I understood some of the history related to Changi, but I still leaned a lot. It is free as along as you don't take a handset, and there is plenty of information to read, so not sure whether you need the handset in all honesty. Got a bit confused about the flow of the information and exhibits in the first gallery, i.e. round the edges or side to side, but not sure it really matters (you'll understand when you see it!)."
,,Little museum that punches above its weight,5.0,,"The unassuming entrance facade of the Changi Museum might mislead visitors to only assume that there is just a replica of the St. Luke's Chapel and nothing else to see. Not so, step into what you see as a small air-conditioned room - I thought it was a tiny museum shop cum library, and wander into long annexes of exhibits, showcases, installations- all beautifully categorized and collated.

During the Japanese Occupation of Singapore during World War 2, the Changi Royal Air Force (RAF) base, Roberts Barracks Block 151 at Changi Military Base was turned into a make-shift hospital for prisoners-of-war of the Allied Forces. As disease and malnutrition was rife among the captives, the Christian chaplains ministering to the sick obtained permission from the Japanese commander to convert part of the ground floor of the hospital's ""Dysentery Wing"" (Blk. 151) into a chapel as a source of comfort and solace.

Known as St. Luke's Chapel, the chapel opened on 12 July 1942 for patients, and in particular, for the staff of 196, 197 and 198 Field Ambulances R.A.M.C.. Daily service was held with the distribution of Holy Communion. Of note were the altar rail, which was designed by an officer of the 18th Division, and built by the 18th Division Royal Engineers. The chapel's font was made by Captain Cook, 5th Suffolk Regiment.

It is also here that you can see the famous Changi Murals - a set of five biblical theme paintings - painted by Stanley Warren, a British bombardier and prisoner-of-war (POW) interned at the Changi Prison, during the Japanese occupation of Singapore in World War II. Completed under difficult conditions of sickness, limited materials and hardships and with a message of universal love and forgiveness, they helped to uplift the spirits of the POWs and sick when they sought refuge in the prison chapel.

The Chapel furnishings were moved to Selarang Barracks on 27 August 1943 and the areas closed in. The building and chapel were subsequently used by the Japanese Air Force as a storeroom. After the war, the walls of the chapel were distempered over, hiding the murals from view. They were forgotten until its rediscovery in 1958.

Due to their historical significance, an international search was conducted to locate the original painter in helping to restore the damaged and faded murals. Stanley was eventually found in 1959 and, after much persuasion, agreed to assist in the restoration project. Three trips - spanning a period of more than 20 years -to Singapore between 1963 to 1988 were made to restore his former paintings. Due to Stanley's advanced age, only four of the original murals were fully restored.

In 1988, Singapore built a replica Chapel and Museum next to the Changi Prison. When Changi Prison was expanded in 2001, the Chapel and Museum was relocated to a new site 1 km away and the Changi Chapel and Museum was officially established on 15 February 2001. Bernard Stogden, the son of Sgt. Harry Stogden, was invited to place the cross that his father made onto the wreathed altar in the new Chapel. He was claimed to have cried while doing so, as this was one of the only chances he got to interact with his father (through his work) as ""Harry"" Stogden died during the war.

The Museum has a fine collection of paintings, photographs and personal effects donated by former POWs. Among the collection is a series of paintings and sketches by a POW named William Haxworth which provide valuable insight on the daily life of the internees during the occupation. In 1986, Haxworth's wife donated a collection of over 400 paintings and sketches to the National Archives of Singapore.

Also in the museum is a collection of watercolour paintings by Mary Angela Bateman who was among the thousands of women and children held at Changi Prison for more than three years during the war."
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,We visited the museum during our honeymoon and were very impressed. We recommend hiring the audio guide as it is very informative and has live commentary from many past prisoners on their experience as a prisoner of the Japanese within the camp. We also found a record of a past relative that had been interned there during the occupation - that was unexpected to say the least so we will endeavor to find out more about what happened to him when we get to Scotland in a few weeks. Staff were very friendly and helpful and it was certainly worth the visit.
,,Very solemn place for every Australian,5.0,,A very effective exhibit between the history museum and outdoor chapel. Very nice to see young singaporeans visiting as part of their national service. The respect demonstrated was impressive.
,,World War memories,5.0,,"We are interested in the history of World Wars so we caught the bus to Changi museum, a short walk from the bus stop to the museum. We found it very interesting."
,,Life for civilians - Singapore in WW11,4.0,,"This interesting small museum is on the East end of the island. It tells the story of what happened to the civilian population, including British families, when the Island was overrun by the Japanese. Changi jail was were they were held in very primitive conditions. Photos, drawings and words tell the story together with artefacts. There is a small shop and a cafe."
,,Well worth a Visit,5.0,,This is quite a small museum and well worth a visit. It tells the story of the fall of Singapore and the occupation by the Japanese. Thought provoking!
,,Somewhat disappointing.,3.0,,No photos permitted and yet no brochure of the display offered/available. Only photos allowed are of outside in chapel area.
,,History,4.0,,We visited the Museum as part of our walking tour ( by bus). Although not as big as I expected it still showed a historical perspective of WW 11 life under Japanese occupation
,,A reminder of the terror of war,5.0,,A sobering experience. Listening to and reading the stories and reports makes one thankful we are not living in Such a dreadful era. A not to be missed tour for all.
,,Excellent history experience,5.0,,"I'll start by saying that we love finding out about the history of places we visit - if you don't like listening, reading and taking your time to fully absorb the information on offer then this museum will bore you. Entry was free unless you wanted the audio tour which cost £4 per person/audio set. The set up was simple - you follow the numbers around reading stuff on the wall and listening to the audio supplement on your headset. The museum inform you very effectively of the fall of Singapore in the Second World War and the aftermath. Thought provoking stuff. We really enjoyed the simplicity of this museum. History buffs will love it plus it's great to get out of the city centre and see more of the real Singapore. Well worth popping into the Bark Cafe which is attached to the museum for a beer afterward. 5 stars from me on this one."
,,A Must See,5.0,,"Changi Museum was a must see for us and we weren't disappointed. Though not on the original prison site (which now serves as a functioning prison) the museum offers an insightful look at life under Japanese oppression in WW11. There are twenty three numbered exhibits but you can peruse them at your leisure in any order. To get the most out of the experience I wholly recommend paying the $8.00 for the audio tour. Getting to the museum via public transport is cheap and easy. Take the MRT to Tanah Merah then the number 2 bus to the museum. When exiting the station, at the bottom of the stairs is a sign that says go left for the number 2 bus. Ignore the sign and go right. The number 2 bus stops just outside the station. Ask the driver to give you the heads up when you are getting close. There is a restaurant next door to the museum. It's a bit expensive by local standards but the food is very good especially the scallops wrapped in bacon."
,,Great Visit,5.0,,Found out just before we went to Singapore that my Great Uncle was POW at Changi so we made this a must visit. We were taken by the stories of hardship experienced at Changi. The young guy who greeted us and also went out of his way to find out some info about my Uncle was fantastic. He also has a personal story about Changi which was great and he should be recognised.
,,Take a taxi,4.0,,"This is not the original site but it does give one a great insight into the horrors of 1940's Singapore. A good tour but you may just want to walk around in the museum. My tip take a taxi to get there, there is a bus but the former is much much easier."
,,Moving,4.0,,"I am a brit living in Nz. I'd grown up knowing about WW1/WWE from family and education, etc. The horrors that occurred. Living in Nz I leaned about the horror of the ANZAC experienced in the war, through going here, it just puts into place what local and other colonies went through during the same times.... free to enter but worth paying a minimal amount for a audio tour, a moving and informative attraction."
,,Least we never forget,5.0,,A very sad place to visit I was not alive when the war happened so it was good for me to understand all the suffering these brave people endured the reconstruction of the chapel is wonderful.
,,Somber experience,4.0,,Very informative museum. Well laid out The headphone system was great for interactivity. As a grandson of a WW2 victim was sad to see what the brave men and women of Singapore and Penang and POWs of other countries went through
,,Interesting but thought it would have more,3.0,,"Changi Museum is on Changi Rd. It can be reached by train and bus. The website has all details.
The chapel here is a replica of the original located at Duntroon Officers College.
Entry is free, however it costs $8 each or $12 if you share for the audio self tour. It is a very interesting tour which provides a lot of information on what happened to Singapore during WW II with Japan.
The original gates to the prison are still in existence and are located at the new prison about 2 kilometres up the road. While behind shadecloth the gates can be seen for various angles.
It is certainly worth a visit for the perspective and information offered."
,,Reminder of the past,5.0,,"if you are interested in history, perhaps watched Tenko worth a visit, The museum detailed photographic evidence of life in the prison during war time"
,,Very moving experience,5.0,,"We visited Changi Museum early one morning, and took the self guided tour with the audio device and headset. As Australians, we were very moved by the sacrifice and bravery shown by Australians, allies and the local people who were subjected to the occupation during the war. A must for Australian and New Zealand visitors."
,,History of war in Singapore,4.0,,"What a great place to learn the misery and pain Singapore suffered from japanese in war. This we recommend for anybody to understand what people dont know occurred. Value for money was good $8 each self guided with headset and control unit to listen would not suggest tour guide, learn by listening and reading also don't go cheap for $6 each share with two headsets watched someone looked awkward with headsets connected one control unit."
,,Interesting,3.0,,Unfortunately I was on a tour and only had a limited time. The museum was interesting but you are not allowed to photograph once inside.
,,A Sombre reminder of WW2.,4.0,,"We travelled on the MRT to Tanah Merah Station then by bus 138 directly to the Museum. It is a relatively easy, but quite circuitous, trip from the city. We paid $8 each for an audio guide to the 24 display areas and learnt a lot about Singapore's place in the history of the war. We heard and saw first hand accounts of the atrocities handed out to the locals and allied soldiers.
This museum paints a graphic picture of a time that should never be forgotten and people who should always be remembered."
,,Important tourism,5.0,,"Some reviews say you can learn more from the Internet ... They miss the point completely.
This place looks very small but needs time to listen to the audio and read the detail. And then let it sink in. Sink in that it happened under your feet.

Very nicely done. Very powerful. Very important."
,,Terribly sad,4.0,,"I'm not going to dwell on this much except to say if you have kids , take them to the museum and show them what happened. It's worth the trip and it's free which is a rarity in Singapore"
,,Very Well Documented and Detailed Desciptions,5.0,,Tourists especially History Buffs must not miss this museum also known as Changi Chapel Museum where the atrocities of the Japanese during World War 2 and the Japanese Occupation are fully documented. It was painful to see what our ancestors had to survive because of the brainless and ruthless acts by the crazy japanese and it cannot be forgiven. A must visit for all Brits and Countries under the Commonwealth.
,,You could learn more off the Internet,3.0,,"Getting to the museum by train and bus from where I stayed in Singapore took nearly as long as the tour, so keep travelling time in mind if planning a visit.
Having seen many WWII museums around the world, I found this a little disappointing. Of course it provides an overview of the horrible period and there are a few relics and brief anecdotes but it didn't seem to capture the essence of what must have been an unbelievably horrific time for soldiers and civilians.
The audio review seemed to repeat much of what could be read and didn't add ""the enhanced experience"" we were promised, especially for the $8 per person. If you feel the urge to visit, I'd recommend not purchasing the audio.
Another option is to read a good book on the subject or at least trawl the Internet."
,,A Moving Experience,4.0,,My Father was in Singapore at the time of the invasion but managed to escape by submarine just before the invasion. Therefore a poignant visit.
,,Well Worth a Visit,4.0,,"As others have said, this small museum is free- a most pleasant surprise! It took us about 1hour 20mins by MRT to Tampines station and then bus to get there.
We found it very interesting and sobering. There is a lot to read.
I had not realised how many Indian soldiers were also POWs, nor how ingenious many of the prisoners became despite all the hardships, making needed items like footwear, soap out of very little.
Well worth a visit, especially if you have an interest in War History"
,,Thought provoking,4.0,,A very tasteful museum and tribute to a horrible and tragic part of world history. Let us hope the human race has learned a valuable lesson and not let such events occur again.
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,"We were pleasantly surprised to find there is no charge to visit this museum. They have done a marvellous job in telling the story of Changi POW Camp, we spent about 2 hours looking at and reading all the displays. After which we had a lunch and drinks at the restaurant attached to it. All in all a very informative visit. It is wheelchair friendly."
,,Visit to Changi Museum a trip back in time,4.0,,"The Changi Museum has photos, memorabilia and many stories of the life of Singaporeans, both locals and expatriates, in the lead up to and during the Japanese occupation in World War II. For anyone with relatives in the Changi prisoner of war camps, there are listings of everybody interned there, though I didn't find my great-uncle who was reputedly imprisoned there. Harrowing stories of bravery and deprivation give an insight into modern day Singapore."
,,Informative & entertaining,5.0,,"We went on the guided tour and our guide, Charl was absolutely excellent . Very informative but also respectful and passionate about the history of the prison and the inmates.
We visited on Anzac Day which made the experience even more special given we are Aussies. You could easily spend half to a full day there depending on your level of interest but even for the mere tourist it is still an interesting insight into the history of the region.
Well worth it"
,,WW2 FEPOW History,5.0,,"An excellent museum dedicated to the FEPOW'S, who were marched to Changi following the surrender to the Japanese during WW2.
The museum is out in the direction of the airport but well worth a visit if you are interested in WW2.
My personal interest being ex-army and proudly knowing a living survivor."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"If you are staying in the Little India or Bugis area, the easiest way to get to Changi is probably the number 2 bus from outside Stamford Primary school: $2.40 one way buses arrive every 15 minutes, have air conditioning and some are even double deckers so give a good view too for the 55 minute trip which drops you outside the museum. The Museum is free to enter but we took the audio tour at $8 each or $12 sharing a headset, and were very glad we did as the background stories and first hand accounts gave a deeper insight to events in this time and place. A pleasant cafe is just next door although prices are for tourists; the gift shop was however good value: stock is only small but I was delighted with my purchases."
,,Important story in the history of Singapore,5.0,,A very reverent and interesting museum with information regarding the 3 year occupation of Singapore during WW2. Either take the audio tour or a more personalised tour with one of the guides. If you had loved ones involved in the war leave a remembrance note on the wall in the chapel or light a candle. An important place to visit.
,,Informative & Heartbreaking,5.0,,"Everything you need to know about what happened to those poor soldiers. Extremely in depth, they even have quotes from people that were just students or civilians at the time. You can see everything from everyone's perspective."
,,Worth a visit.,5.0,,Nice little museum. Well laid out. The audio talk was worth while as it added some extra information to what was on the displays. VNice restaurant to have a meal there also. Very close to the airport so ideal for anyone with a couple of hours to kill on a stopover.
,,A reflective visit,4.0,,"It's important to visit this museum to preserve the memory of those that died and suffered in WW11. The museum itself is free but it is worth paying for the audio tour, to hear of the experiences of some who were there."
,,Moving Experience,4.0,,"My husband's uncle was a POW at Changi during WWII so for us this visit was personal. Besides the emotional attachment and although sad, the displays were informative and attempted to show all sides of the conflict - the prisoners, their captors and the local people. What we liked about the museum was that we could quietly reflect on the detailed information without some museum staffer constantly impacting on the solitude. The museum staff were extremely respectful."
,,A good place to learn about Singapore history,4.0,,"We visited this place in December 2015 during our trip to Singapore .
We were staying in nanyang university campus .
Hence we took a cab DELGRO which was i40 Hyundai car to change chapel and museum .
It took 25 mins to reach there and j think around 28 SGD.
The place is perfect for travellers who want to get in to the history of the place they are visiting .
It has a good historical events to offer from British empire in singapura and then Japanese rule and then again British .
Also has articles on how Singapore got independence from Malaysia .

It has a good small chapel too and a library .

I think neatest metro station is parsir ris which is about 2 miles .

Good place ."
,,Very moving,5.0,,"we visited this Museum as we used to live in Changi village 60 years ago. The museum is not very big but it packs a big punch. It is a great collection of photos, memorabilia and personal accounts of local people and Forces personnel. It was very informative and moving. I would recommend a visit."
,,This was good,4.0,,"You will not need all day here, however take a couple of hours if you can and read all about it. there is a place to get food there if you are hungry"
,,"Really is a ""must do"" in Singapore",5.0,,"This is a great place to go to really get an understanding of a part of the history of Singapore most of us think we know something about. It is a real eye opener! If you are organised enough book a tour guide, I just email them and make a booking, if you can't the audio tour is good too, just not as personal. The tour is $12 pp the audio guide is $6 pp.
It takes about 90 minutes to do the tour, depending on your level of interest.
Not great for very young children but school age kids would be fine."
,,Imperialism and nationalism,4.0,,"Recently, I organized an educational visit for my residents to the NEWater Visitor Center and the Changi Chapel Museum. Since we have a large group of residents, I sent in a notification of visit to the museum for approval and it was approved without much query.

At any one time, the museum can only accommodate 120 persons including walk-ins and groups and reserves the right to reject any visitor who come unannounced. The approval on the notification of visit is just an acknowledgement and does not mean that a guided tour is provided for the visit. Although admission is free, guided tour is charged.

We arrived at the museum at about 9.10 am but the entrance was locked as it only opens at 9.30 am. We waited patiently in the bus as the weather was extremely hot on that day. There were also few foreign visitors waiting outside the gate and by the time it opened at 9.30 am, we swarmed into the air-conditioned exhibition hall like school children going into the classroom.

This is the second time I visited the museum. It has not changed much since the last time I visited few years ago. Many of my residents were Mandarin speaking and I did my best to translate into Mandarin of what was on the exhibition panels. Most felt disgusted by the horrible sight of decapitated heads and starved skeletal bodies of the Prisoners of War.

Few of the `old aunties' residents who had suffered miserably during the Japanese invasion recalled the terrible massacre of the innocents and living in fear and phobia throughout the 3 years and 8 months of Japanese tyrannical rule.

Millions of precious lives perished during the Second World War. In my opinion, it was a war between the imperialist titans to capture and plunder the resources of the lands they lay their hands on.

The Allied Powers represented the western colonial powers who had stretched their claws into Asia much more earlier than the Japanese. The White Rajah were in Borneo; the Spaniards in Philippines, the French in Indo-China, the Dutch in Batavia and the Portuguese in Melaka.

The Meiji Restoration changed Japan into a technological advanced powerful nation who can challenged the Western imperialists and when both titans fight for resources, the impoverished and innocent people of the lands they plundered became the scapegoat and victims of the war.

Singapore is one of those lands exploited by the British East Indies Company as a port for trade to the Far East. The Fall of Singapore was from the clutch of one British imperialists to the tyrannical Japanese imperialists. Both the British and the Japanese were here to serve their own interests. Not only the locals suffered but the faithful and loyal servants of the British Colonial armed forces also suffered miserably during the wars. Many of them perished when they were sent to Burma to build the deadly railway.

The Second World War woke up the minds of those `stupid' people who lived on lands exploited by the colonialists and imperialists. The rise of nationalism open the eyes of those innocent people who were treated like servants by their colonial masters.

Blessed are the meek as they will inherit the Earth."
,,Take the time to visit,5.0,,"This is easily visited without the use of a tour group if you wish to go it alone.

My travelling companion and I were both equally keen on visiting this ""attraction"". Me as a student of Australian military history and he because his grandfather had been imprisoned there after the fall of Singapore to the Japanese during World War II.
The ride out there on public transport was easily managed and pretty much drops you outside the entrance. I believe it was bus route 2.
The prison & chapel museum is immaculately maintained and well worth spending the few dollars on the audio tour - this is not mandatory but certainly adds to the experience. We spent more than one hour there and could easily have spent more than two.
Although the tour is suitable for families it is advisable for parents to accompany their children throughout as some of the images are confronting - images of executions and civilian victims of bomb damage etc. The images are necessary to convey the depth of brutality that was visited upon the population and POWs.
I certainly came away with a much greater appreciation of the Battle, its aftermath and the tribulations suffered by many.
It was particularly noteworthy that all visitors seemed to treat the site with the respect it deserved, maintaining a respectful volume in conversation and treating the artifacts appropriately.
There is a very good book shop attached to the centre and a cafe adjacent to it, if you need time to reflect or just a nice cold drink.
Highly recommended"
,,Worth the trip out for some history,4.0,,"We shared a recording tour(two sets of headphones), was a very good, humbling experience. Well set up museum honouring ww2 and the effects on Singapore and soldiers.

The gift shop will call a taxi when you are ready to leave...
But first..

Go to the Bark Cafe next door, food and drinks are great. Beautiful quiet setting."
,,Must do tour,5.0,,My husband and I were very happy that we took this tour. It struck a chord with us as Australian's and enabled us to pay our respects to all who were interned there. The tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and made the tour a must do activity.
,,Highly Recommended!,5.0,,"Australia is a fairly ""young"" country so I always take the opportunity to learn more about our history, influence, & global impact such as it may be whenever I travel overseas.

Australian's like many others from Commonwealth countries made huge sacrifices in Singapore during WWII.

Aussies are mentioned several times throughout the Story of the Fall of Singapore during WWII and the subsequent occupation by the Japanese as documented at The Changi Museum.

There is a nominal charge to rent a headset to enhance your visit by listening to a number of audio presentations in addition to the material displayed on the walls throughout the premises.

Some audio stories are pretty harrowing so parents should consider screening first before allowing young kids to listen in.

The stories are very moving, highly emotional, and you cant help but feel sombre & solemn given the pain experienced by all in Singapore during these dark times.

A visit to the Museum itself is free...but I would recommend the audio as extra.

Its a good idea to bring along something to keep very young kids entertained...we took a media device which kept our 6yr old occupied throughout our visit...no disruption to other visitors or disrespect shown to the Museum.

Thanks to Catherine & Beverley for their assistance during our visit.

We opted to make use of taxi's to facilitate our visit but you can make use of nearby bus to connect with MRT as required."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Wow - great place !! So many amazing bits and pieces - got there early - no one around - best way to enjoy the sombre mood - war is so sad
,,A must - allow plenty of time,5.0,,"Although out of town, it was very easy to get to - the bus dropped us off right outside. The audio extra was well worth the small fee as this added to the visual tour. There were many personal accounts and horrific stories which made you think of the people and what they had to endure but also there were stories of strength and bravery. Take your time and some tissues - it was an emotional experience."
,,Vert interesting and educational,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the museum and found it quite sad and educational. This museum is a great memorial for the POW, their families and friends"
,,"Disappointed, wouldn't go back",3.0,,"Caught the MRT and bus to the museum. Paid for the audio tour but didn't get a feel for the place. I was really disappointed, this was one of my top things to do in Singapore. I just couldn't tap into the feeling and the experiences that people had, no interactive displays. Just thought is that it. I got more from my visit to the Singaporean National Museum than here, particularly for the Singaporean stories."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,Wonderful museum and a must seemfor those with a family connection to the horrors of WW2 and Changi. I visited having spent the previous day at Kranji War Cemetery. Shed more than a few tears.
,,Great insights and stories,5.0,,Nice 3 hour tour with very engaged tour guide. Highly recommended as a different view of Singapore than the usual tour of universal studio.
,,Really brings it home,5.0,,You cannot visit the Changi Museum without being humbled. It is a reminder of our inhumanity. We were profoundly moved. It is well worth the journey. It can be reached by a bus from Clarke Quay
,,Well worth the effort of getting there by No 2 or 29 Bus,5.0,,"While if you consider what the people who are mentioned inside the Museum went through during the Japanese occupation of Singapore, then getting there by either No 2 or 29 Bus which by the way is Air Conditioned and stops outside and is considerably cheaper than a Taxi or MRT ride it is nothing in comparison.

The stories that are depicted and spoken about on the Audio are very sad and quite emotional, which for me makes me value our freedom even more.

While the Museum is FREE, there is a charge for the Audio Tour, and a reduction is available if you have one unit and 2 sets of headphones.

Being from Wales (UK) as we came around to the room with the 5 Murals on the wall when we hit the button for the first audio playback the first thing we heard was a piece of the Welsh National Anthem, and the tears started!

It was however very sad to find that even though New Zealand had taken part in the conflict there was no mention of their efforts except for one display of information about the aircraft they used, and the fact that they brought down the first enemy aircraft even though their aircraft was inferior to the performance of the enemy aircraft.

Absolutely worth the effort of getting there, and a credit to the people who put the display and museum together."
,,Incredibly Moving,5.0,,"While the museum is a little out of the way, it is most definitely worth the trip to get to it. Only a small museum but so full of information about the war, the prisoners and the local people. We spent quiet a bit of time here reading all the information extensively. It is worth paying the small fee for the audio guide also. There are so many stories told and memories spoken about that it was impossible not to be moved to tears. The museum is a credit to the curators who have been respectful to the memory of those who suffered within the walls of Changi ... Those who survived and those who sadly died."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,It is a bit out of the way but easily accessibly by public transport and it is not the original location but this is still worth a visit. Its a small museum but give a good insight into the bravery of those who endured the harrowing conditions. Very moving place to visit
,,Very interesting and moving museum,4.0,,Great little museum. Very moving to see the stories and photos. Had a small cafe for a quick snack. Would recommend - it was worth the visit even though it is a bit outside of central Singapore.
,,memorable place to visit,5.0,,"This is a wonderful, although moving place to visit. The photos, in particular, are a testament to the courage, tenacity and resilience of the POWs and a sombre reminder of the futility of war."
,,Very worthwhile,5.0,,"I visited this museum as part of a half-day tour that also included the site of the Sook Ching massacre and the Johore Battery. I would have loved to have spent even more time looking around and reading all the many displays - there is a wealth of information and it is very moving indeed. I liked that the museum wasn't full of interactive displays, which I often find gimmicky and noisy; I enjoyed strolling around and reading at my own pace. I would highly recommend this museum to anyone with even a passing interest in history - it documents a very important period and does so respectfully and engagingly."
,,Disappointed,3.0,,We first saw changi museum quite a few years ago when it was on sentosa island in the old army military hospital. We decided to go see again in its new surroundings but were very disappointed with it. There was a lot of reading and no interactive displays. When you have to keep reading it becomes very boring and interest is lost.
,,Sobering,5.0,,"Visited the museum as part of an all-day round island tour that looked at the history of Singapore and the experiences of WWII. The museum has many exhibits and lots of written information, photos etc. It was very well done and informative if not a little sad and very sobering."
,,Emotional insight into man's inhumanity to man,4.0,,"Having read extensively about the imprisonment of allied troops, especially Australians, found the museum to be very well detailed and presented.

Easily read and understood exhibits - detailing the harsh extremes that the soldiers were subjected to.

It is disappointing that the museum as such is a purpose built stand alone building, with only a small portion of concrete wall of the original prison on display.

For some reason the Singaporean Government decided post - war to continue using a lot of the original prison building as a present day gaol. So it is difficult to get an appreciation of the actual conditions.

Having been fortunate enough to have visited Dachau, Auschwitz/Birkenhau and Mauthausen over the years - where you can see and feel the evil of the experiences suffered by inmates. It is unfortunate that at least some of the original Changi buildings have not been preserved.

The museum is still well worth a visit, however, it is just a museum and gift shop."
,,Changi Museum/Memorial,4.0,,"It was interesting to note how difficult it was to actually find the memorial-no-one seemed to know where we wanted to go despite the fact that the Changi Prison is enormous and the memorial is in a small corner of the property. Bus drivers, Taxi drivers and Hotel concierge we asked all thought we wanted to visit a prisoner there but none seemed to know exactly how to get there. We were surprised at this as Changi is a huge part of the history of Australia's connection with Singapore and the local people still express respect for the soldiers of Australia who fought here in WW2. After initial diificulties in working out where to go, an MRT officer set us onto the right bus and we found the memorial very easily in the end.
For a small fee, headphones make the experience a more informative interactive experience.
A very moving and worthwhile journey for anyone who needs to understand more about the connection between Australia, Singapore and the history of our people."
,,Sobering experience,5.0,,"You may think it not the place to go on an enjoyable holiday but it should not be missed or, like the Burma Railway Museum near the River Kwai, should not be forgotten."
,,Lest we forget,5.0,,As the world lurches and wrestles with conflict in Syria and bombs in Brussels this is a timely reminder of mans inhumanity to man. Elizabeth Choys story is heartbreaking as are so many others. Important at Easter to reflect on the sacrifice.
,,One of the best,5.0,,"Heard from the husband that this is one of Singapore's best museums and was not disappointed at all.

Entry to the museum is free, and you can opt for an audio tour at $8/adult. No photography/videography is allowed in the museum.

The museum, while small, offers an excellent experience. We were there for about an hour. It is incredibly informational and educational, with the history of the Japanese Occupation in WWII & the experience of the POWs then presented in a very understandable manner. There are photographs, artifacts, facts and accounts put together for an immersive experience. While the museum itself is not interactive, you will find yourself very much occupied reading about the Occupation.

The museum, while not air-conditioned, is well-ventilated with fans placed around. There are also benches within the museum that will let you read the displays comfortably.

The Changi Museum is an overall excellent choice that finds itself near the top spot in my list of favourite museums."
,,Small but interesting,4.0,,A little way outside the main tourist area but reachable by public transport (MRT and then bus). The museum has some interesting exhibits on the occupation of SIngapore.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"My grandfather was interned at Changi so my visit had a personal meaning. The museum provides an honest account of this period in history and is an awakening for some. There is an audio guide for a small fee which is worth getting. The museum is not big but what is there is very good. As you exit you walk through a gift shop, as you do, but look for the book of inmates (not for sale) held at Changi. I found my grandfather and details about his hut and dates of his internment. I believe one of the huts is to be restored.

It is accessible by public transport - train to Pasir Ris and a bus which has a stop outside the museum."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"We arrived late so we were unable to have the audio tour but in an hour we managed to read most of the writing on the exhibits"""
,,A Moving Experience,5.0,,Make sure you take your time and view the artefacts and listen to the stories as told by the survivors.
,,Touching Visit,4.0,,"The museum is better than what we expected. Reading the accounts of those who undergone the world war was really moving. ""Lest we forget"""
,,poignant reminder of the suffering endured by the Allied forces,5.0,,Visited the museum as I had read about the infamous Changi jail where so many soldiers suffered at the hands of the Japanese whilst in captivity
,,A solem reminder of dark days in WW2,4.0,,"It is one place that Australians should place on their itinerary when visiting Singapore.

The audio tour (we had one with 2 head phones) was an excellent way to connect with the pictures and static displays. There is one dialogue from Changi female survivor that is quite heart-wrenching, so it is not a 'fun' place.

There is a nice cafe ('The Bark') near the entrance where you can come back from what you have just experienced, have a drink, a snack, or a meal.

We bought a 3 day pass which covered the MRT and bus out and back. Which is easy to do in Singapore and interesting to take in the scenery. We got the SGD $10 deposit (each) on our last day and used it well during our stay."
,,Great little Museum,4.0,,We asked a taxi to take us to Changi and he did not speak to us the whole time. It wasn't until he went to drop us off at THE Changi prison we realised we didnt say memorial!! The driver relaxed and talked to us then - it was very funny. Approx $40 each way in a taxi and was very worthwhile for the history.
,,Very solemn,5.0,,"Make the effort and go to the museum and have some time to reflect. Very detailed examination of the impact of the war on Singapore, its citizens and defenders. We got there by a combination of MRT and bus. If you have the time on the way back, catch Bus Number 2 at the front gates which will take you on a great ride all the way back to Chinatown, it's a double decker and you get a great perspective of Singapore"
,,Very Moving,5.0,,"From the simple replica chapel to the various montages and relics recounting the history of the Japanese invasion of Singapore in 1942-5, to the messages left by later day relatives of those who perished or survived, this was a very moving visit for any Australian. How anyone can think that war is a good thing is surely countered in this museum, the hardships and deprivation endured by the prisoners and generally by the Singaporeans was astonishing."
,,Nostalgia visit with mother,5.0,,"I took my mother to the Museum as she had been here during ww2 but escaped to Oz,leaving her father to be captured by the Japanese and imprisioned in Changi and latterly Sime Rd. Mr Jeya gave us a personal tour and the Museum is well set out,and with the mass of photos and various memorabilia, clearly impacts upon you, what my Grandfather and others suffered during those dark war years. Brave,tough,resiliant people. ."
,,Changi Museum and Chapel,5.0,,"Our guide Sharol gave a moving and passionate account of a dark time in allied and local history. The stories of individuals imprisoned and their legacy, not only at the place but the effect on their families made it more poignant. The trials and tirbulations of the locals were also spoken about. Sharol spoke of the horror his own family experienced. My wife's uncle was incarcerated there in WW2. We went armed with his army details. We were provided with a printout of his Army record (one page which can be expanded on through the Australian War Memorial) but also a shown a book detailing his Unit's history where he was mentioned. If you ever go to Singapore, this is a must do."
,,A Must for Aussie visitors a big part. Of our war time history,5.0,,A must to for all visitors to Singapore Definitely recommend the MRT and number 2 bus to get there Entrance is free but well worth paying $8.00 for an audio recording of all the key points of interest
,,Pause for thought,5.0,,This is a small museum relating to the occupation during the Second World War and the use of Changi prison. Very well displayed and 45 minutes would be sufficient time to digest all. Very thought provoking and seating allows you to pause on the horrors of war and what suffering the population and forces endured. Free entry but charge of $8 for audio commentary.
,,A small but moving museum,3.0,,While only small it has a moving collection of WWII information and displays including a replica of the chapel.
,,WW2 Historical visit,5.0,,"You can drive to this museum, go by MRT and catch the nos 2 bus which drops you out side or a taxi ride is even easier. Get the grab a cab apt on your phone and life suddenly gets simple. This museum will move you to tears, it is free to go in but you need to pay $8 for the audio because it is worth it to hear the personal experience. Not for young children. Then have lunch at The Bark Cafe."
,,will this place remain for long?,4.0,,"i worry about these wonderful pockets of singapore
with so much history within the exhibits tis not a place
where one should rush through take your time and
feel the suffering of those who have been through war
lest we forget.
from here you can go walk along the coast at the
changi boardwalk... take a cab and tis near the
changi sailing club.. towards the end of the boardwalk
you may see the colour of the soil of singapore this
reddish clay... i enjoy very often this whole area
tis lovely and old fashion feel of the old singapore
the silence is lovely.."
,,WWII remembered in Singapore,5.0,,"A very sobering experience. The history of the prison under Japanese occupation is well presented and has many artifacts and artwork donated by former prisoners. It is free to enter but it is well worth renting the audio guide as it has many recordings of the experiences of actual prisoners. The staff, particularly Catherine are very helpful. Take the no. 29 bus from Tampines MRT to get there."
,,History to remember,5.0,,A thought provoking place to visit. An important chapter in the history of Singapore is depicted with sensitivity and care. Well worth the trip out to the museum.
,,Pity they knocked down the prison!,4.0,,Took this in a part of an East Coast tour. It was much smaller than I thought it would be although it contains some interesting material. I would heve been more taken with it had it been located in the actual prison itself - rather like Melbourne Gaol - but they took a decision to demolish all but the facade wall. Shame. However it is well worth a visit - particularly for those with a family connection to those troubled times.
,,Emotional and well presented,5.0,,We had some time getting off our cruise ship until our evening flight so thought this might be a good way to spend a few hours. Also it started to rain and didn't look as though it was going to stop any time soon. We checked our bags at the airport and took a taxi to the museum. The museum is free unless you want to pay for the head phones which give you a lot of extra information. My 10 year old wanted to hear children's stories so she had the head phones. Reading the information boards is just as good. It is very emotional and hard hitting. It is worth a visit to understand the history of the area. Most people just see the glitz of Singapore but it is so much more than that. One hint: don't buy bottled water from the restaurant on site. It cost $3.20 when you can buy in the gift shop for $1.20.
,,History,3.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our MRT/bus journey to the museum, which was fun and not difficult. The museum is interesting but is quite small and I cannot describe it as a ""must do"" attraction. The museum whilst in the vicinity of the old Changi Jail (the modern version can be seen from the bus) is not original at all. It is an interesting story of human survival which I expect will be more meaningful if you have a family connection to Singapore during WW2."
,,"The stories of very brave men and women,",5.0,,From the first exhibition the profound nature of all these WWII POW stories is experienced. A highlight of our visit to Singapore.
,,Hugely interesting!,5.0,,"We have just returned from Singapore during which time we visited the Changi Museum. We were surprise that the museum is not promoted more as it is of great interest. We had planned to visit to hopefully, obtain a little more knowledge of our family history and a Grandfather who was captured in Malaya/ Singapore. Much to our surprise, the curator Jon Cooper spent some one-to one- time with us and was able to trace our Grandfather and clarify his internment within Changi Prison. Many thanks to him - he is an inspiration and his enthusiasm is infectious!!"
,,Does The Job!,3.0,,"I knew very little about the Japanese occupation of Singapore before visiting here and I think I know at least enough to discuss it with someone now that I've been. Information is information and there's no rating it, but the delivery of it could be updated.

The museum is mostly boards with pictures and writing, which is fine, but lacks a bit of interactivity, and could do with a few more modern display methods I think. Worth getting the audio guide for a few dollars, the first hand accounts are particularly moving. Took us about 2 hours in total and we definitely saw everything there was to see."
,,CHANGI MUSEUM,5.0,,This museum displays Singapore’s wartime history during the Japanese Occupation. It's best to take the guided tour to explore this place.
,,Must See,5.0,,"I found the museum very moving and interesting, a lot of history about the fall of Singapore and also the Australians"
,,Thought provoking & informative,5.0,,We had an excellent guide who took us round the museum & brought alive the human stories of the Changi prison & the fall of Singapore from a personal viewpoint as his grandparents were alive during the war years. Our supposed 45 minute tour took 2 hours unbelievably as we just wanted it to never end it was so interesting. The restaurant was also excellent.
,,"Reading, reading, reading",3.0,,"Expected more from this, mostly reading, reading, reading and after some time you got a little tired of the reading. Nice try and what we read was good, but good have been a little more interestingly displayed."
,,Emotional and thought-provoking.,4.0,,"This museum really brings home to you the horrors of the events of WW2, and the terrible inhumanities suffered by the prisoners of war, both at the prison and on the Burma Railway. Terrible stories in this now peaceful setting. Lest we forget."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Very interesting small museum. A definite must is the audio guide which can be hired for $8 each which gives a better understanding of events during WW2. Thank you to Catherine for being so helpful.
,,Time to reflect,5.0,,Well laid out with the opportunity to take a more in depth experience at a cost. History depicted with artefacts and pictures.
,,Changi Chapel and Museum,5.0,,"The Changi Chapel and Museum tells the story of Japanese invasion and occupation if Singapore during WWII. I would definitely recommend renting the audio tour which highlights the hardships endured by the Singaporians and British during this time. As an American, I was taught only of the American role during WWII and not what other countries suffered during the war. Singapore was bombed the same day as Pearl Harbor and was invaded shortly thereafter. This museum chronicles this period with exhibits and many first hand testimonies."
,,An emotional visit,5.0,,"This museum and chapel tells the story of the civilian internees and the POWs in Singapore in WW2. It describes both the cruelty of the occupying forces and the resourcefulness of the prisoners and the part played by Singaporeans. It is quite an emotional place to visit but I think most people would appreciate it. No need to books tour, much cheaper just get a taxi there and back.
You could combine it with a visit to Kranji War Grave Cemetary."
,,Excellent WWII Museum,5.0,,"Located in Changi near the airport, this museum is, as others have said, a moving experience that recounts and recalls the horrors of World War II including the pain and suffering inflicted on the people and soldiers in Singapore from the time of its fall in 1942 thru liberation afew years later. Excellent displays/exhibits to be seen and even a mock-up of a chapel formerly used by POWs (both indoors and outdoors). If you're a history buff, this is a great starting point when reviewing WWII's Singapore history.

Admission is free. You can choose to pay for an audio tour though, which is very informative if you're new to the region's WWII history. Also, cannot recommend enough taking the Singapore Walks Changi WWII tour which includes this museum as its last stop, at which point you can stay here at the end of the tour. There's a bookstore at the exit and a small fridge with drinks for sale. Check MRT, there are buses available to this location.

Not appropriate for small kids given the grim nature of the exhibits and the need for silence and respect when walking thru."
,,History brought to Life,5.0,,"We have all read about the privations and cruelty suffered by those incarcerated in Changi prison during WW2. Whilst in Singapore,our tour operator travelBag arranged an excursion to the East coast of Singapore including a visit to the site of Changi prison and its remaining museum. Again our guide was their operator in Singapore, Tour East, who provided an excellent well informed lady, who brought the experience to life. The Timeline displayed an excellent record of the history of the Occupation and the photographs and artefacts were awesome. A visit to Singapore really must include a visit to Changi"
,,An Interesting place to visit.,4.0,,If you are interested in the history of the region then this is well worth a visit. A little out of the way to get to but Singapore's public transport is clean and cheap so just leave yourself plenty of time to get there.
,,"Respectful, free and very informative!",5.0,,"Really informative the museum itself is free. We used the english audio guides which was very helpful. They do 2 prices one to share a device and have 2 headphones for 2 people or one each. We had the 2headphones and one device. It was great! So informative. We spent about 3hours there as we were really taking in the information and reading everything but you could whizz round in about 30mins with the audio guide. The audio guide clips are short but lots of information and even voices of people who were pow.

Overall a very respectful day which did make me have a lump in my throat and a tear in my eye as i had a relative who was a pow there."
,,A very moving experience.,5.0,,"Located on the grounds of a former prison that became a WW II POW camp, this museum depicts the horrors faced by those held by the Japanese in Singapore from 1942 - 1945. Along with native Singaporeans, allied soldiers from Great Britain and Australia, as well as civilians, both women and children, were held here. Artifacts have been donated by their families for display, and prisoners' own words are often used to describe pictures shown."
,,WWII Tour,5.0,,A great tour of the museum and local Changi area with Sharul as our Journeys guide. Well worth it for a great perspective on what happened in Singapore
,,Nice little Museum,3.0,,"Nice little Museum telling you history of Japanese occupation in Singapore and their treatment of Allied forces. Little touchy for those who want to revisit memories of World War. Not so convenient location but easy connectivity by Public bus.

For tourist, can combine visit to Cchangi Chapel and Museum with Changi Village and beach which is nearby."
,,Never Forget,5.0,,"A lot of thought has gone into this museum to commemorate the history of the cruelties of the Japanese occupation and the suffering of the Singapore people and the allied forces personnel. This small museum creates a moving tribute to those who gave their lives and those who battled to survive through terrible hardships. Young adults and teens would be well advised to visit. Suggest you leave smartphones off.
There is now a good cafe/restaurant/bar outside since my last visit and the exhibits have been totally revamped. One of the best hours you can spend."
,,A must see for Australians,5.0,,Even though a lot of the original structure doesn't remain changi is an incredibly moving memorial to all the people that suffered in WW2. Sad & thought provoking displays
,,An Absolute Must,5.0,,"We visited The Changi Museum in January 2016. This is a small museum in physical size that packs a huge punch on the visitor attraction stakes. With a focus on the historical era around World War II, the museum contains so many informative and poignant displays that captivate us."
,,History lesson,4.0,,"Well worth visit and a great way to learn about this part of WW2. Pay the $8 and hire the audio headphones which are great and used at your pace. Take the MRT to Tanah Merah and take bus 2. As an earlier contributor said turn right at the bottom of the escalators as even though it says bus 2 is left, they leave from both sides of the MRT station so go right. If you want jump off bus 2 at Changi village and foreshore park then continue later with bus 2 along to the museum."
,,Respectful,4.0,,"A modest respectful museum. Bus stop right out front, plenty of parking. All flat, no steps so good for wheelchairs. Free admission, you only pay for an audio tour.

Probably not good for elementary school aged children, lots of reading, all pictures are black and white, no interactive displays.

Was surprised at the amount of information sourced from the Australian war museum and the lack of representation of the nurses who were there."
,,We don't appreciate how lucky we are.,5.0,,"Visit to the museum included in tour by 'The Original Singapore Walks'. The Guide was very knowledgeable and throughout the trip both the grim and the more less pleasant parts were described great detail - he could not have been better! The Museum is fascinating, having an amazing collection of artifacts which bring the whole atmosphere of the visit 'back to life'

I will undoubtedly repeat the tour on my next visit to Singapore

As my title states 'We don't appreciate how lucky we are'"
,,"Informative, small Museum",5.0,,This gave us a chance to take the MRT train out of the main part of the city and see where people live. We took it to the closest stop and then used Uber to get to the museum. The museum was interesting and informative about the Japanese occupation during WWII
,,Amazing For All,5.0,,"Really an amazing collection of artifact. You will definitely enjoy the visit and will be amazed by seeing the vast collection here. Come if you love history and nature. Fabulous place and most of all it isn't expensive at all, really economical place with lot to admire and learn"
,,Pay your respects and get educated at the same time.,5.0,,"Awesome museum. Took MRT and local bus 2 to the museum. Make sure you have shrapnel for the bus. $1.60 to the museum and it is bus shelter 1 at the bottom of the escalator,turn right.
Respectfully covers all the Comenwealth countries that sacrificed so much for our freedom and the locals too who some times get overlooked.
Once you have wiped your tears catch the same bus to Changi beach village for lunch. Found a micro brewery called ĺittle island brewery just past the food stalls. Awsome food and local tap beer (had spitfire on tap, my favorite beer, but went with the local pale ale. Walk it off in Changi beach park which is a great beach and park trails."
,,Very Moving,5.0,,Spent a Sunday afternoon here and took the audio tour - really interesting and well put together. Highly recommend to all
,,Respect,5.0,,"If you’ve got a spare couple of hours travel out to the museum and pay your respects to the men, women and children who endured the Japanese brutal occupation of Singapore during WW2. The headsets can be shared and give that extra understanding of the enormity of the suffering. Afterwards a cool drink in the adjacent restaurant prepares you for the return trip into the city. We took a taxis there and returned via the local bus and MRT."
,,Moving,5.0,,"Thankyou for sharing this amazing display of Singapore history .
We can never forget such significant events, and the hardships those endured.
a special thankyou to our tour guide Char ( ""Cheryl"") for a very informative insight to early Singapore.
very easy to get to using the train and bus service.
A visit to the Changi Museum is a must."
,,Very somber experience in a comprehensive museum,4.0,,"We chose to do the audio tour, which provided 25 comprehensive audio interpretations of the history and experiences at Changi prison during the Japanese occupation. In addition, there was a good selection of photographs, first-hand accounts and exhibits. Well worth visiting to gain an understanding of life during the early 1940s."
,,Lest we forget.,5.0,,A very sobering museum and one which is a testimony to both the resilience of man as well as the cruelty man can inflict on his fellow man. Take in the ingeniousness of the Australian Prisoners and their colleagues. And be aware that next door 2 fellow Australians lost their lives due to drugs.
,,Fascinating,5.0,,A great little museum. You only need a maximum of two hours to get round it. Very informative and accessible. Great cafe next door as well. Well worth the trip.
,,Detailed and moving museum,5.0,,"For all Singapore's museums, it's easy to miss the story of Singapore during WWII. This museum gives a good explanation of not only the history but also the human experiences during this period. While it may not be the shiniest or most modern of museums, the information is well-presented and accessible; you'll want an hour or two if you like to read everything.

It's quite far from Singapore's other attractions but easily reached by bus (we took one directly from Chinatown). For a whole day trip you can combine it with a trip to Pulau Ubin (return to the bus stop and continue on to Changi Village), or you could stop in Geylang for dinner on your way back."
,,Moving account........,3.0,,"Quite a distance out of the city but if you are interested in the history of Singapore it is worth a visit. Free to enter, the story unfolds depicting the horrors of the Japanese occupation between 1942-1945."
,,changi museum,5.0,,"Excellent place to visit, very informative, guide called Sharul extremely informative and very interesting. A must do visit. Coach takes you to Changi beach and museum. Camera a must. Just over 3 hours in total."
,,The Changi Museum,5.0,,"We spent a couple of hours at the museum, and it was a very touching experence, it baught tears to my wifes eyes when she read the stories and saw the photos.

Having spent some of my scool days in Singapor ( my father was in the air force ) I was aware of things that had happened during the war but the visit to changi was amazing.

Brian Leonard"
,,Emotional,4.0,,"Great if your a historian or interested in the WW2 POW etc. Somethings are deeply thought provoking. A truthful and witnessed accounts of the atrocities of war. The historian on site s well read and helped us un Earth the truth about our relatives last days as a Pow.
Worth a trip, not for young kids"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"The staff..... Jon, Shaml, Siti and Shabana were truly helpful. We had a great visit 12/10. There is so much to learn and it is brilliantly presented."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"It's only small, but it's worth a visit to learn a bit more about those imprisoned here during the war."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,The Changi Chapel Museum is worth the journey out of town. A reminder of a sad time in Singapore but well explained and respectfully represented. Catch a train to Tanah Merah (green line EW4) and then Bus 2 (in the direction of train travel). The bus stops at the Museum. After the museum go to the bus stop you got off and head to Changi Village. A slice of Singapore life out of the city.
,,Had to Visit,5.0,,Not everyone's cup of tea but if you have an interest in history or the second world war then this is a must. A really informative tour and having the opportunity to sit on pews used by the PoW's was quite the moment
,,Moving Experience,5.0,,The Chapel was awesome.The relics of the prisoners fascinating to see and very moving.Not the easiest place to get to but well worth the visit.
,,A trip back in time when many fought for our rights for freedom,5.0,,"A respectful place showing us a little of the conditions people faced and suffered through when Singapore was over run their enemies in WWII. It is a deep and meaningful visit.
Wow... I was fortunate to be there with only staff on an early visit just after they opened. Incredible experience. Lest We Forget!"
,,A must see,4.0,,"The Changi museum records a forgotten piece of history; the story of the thousands of Allied POWs who were held in Singapore during the second world war. although small, the place contains a huge amount of information and history, the difficulties of the prisoners are well documented and shown in such a compelling yet simple way that one is moved by the end of the tour.

A visit is highly recommended for anyone interested in the second world war."
,,A humbling place to visit when in Singapore. Highly recommended,5.0,,"A museum dedicated to all those civilian and military personnel held as Prisoners of War by the Japanese after the fall of Singapore in 1942. The exhibits are very informative and I would recommend paying extra for the audio guides as they add so much to the already informative displays. I visited the museum having read reviews prior to travelling and I was not disappointed. The curators have done an excellent job in providing an informative interaction whilst demonstrating sensitivity in what is a very emotional subject. I was able to pay my respects to my Uncle, a Gunner in the Anti Tank Regiment, held captive at Changi.
We used public transport to get to the museum and took the Metro to Tanah Mearah MRT and then took a number 2 bus which stops outside the museum. We travelled from Orchard MRT and the journey time was just under an hour. I would highly recommend this on the list of things to do for anyone visiting Singapore."
,,Worth It,5.0,,"We had time to spare before we flew out, so caught a taxi over here. Well worth the visit. So much history. Only tiny so can do in an hour depending on how fast you read"
,,Small but very interesting.. worth a visit,4.0,,"Lots of information, and well laid out to access to get a sense of this intense period in Singapore. The old prison is long gone but the museum is on the old site. I expected to be in and out in an hour. I was there for over 3 hours. An experience that I will not forget and highly recommend."
,,Round Island Tour,5.0,,"Visited the Changi Chapel and Museum as part of a day trip around the island. Very sobering. No photos are to be taken inside the museum which is out of respect for the ex POWs. Ladies should NOT wear mascara as if you are like me, you will be bawling your eyes out."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,Went to this as part of a tour. Very interesting. Had a great guide. Lots of informative stuff there.
,,Interesting.,5.0,,An interesting and educational little museum. Very insightful. Worth the 20min trip out of the city centre.
,,An excellent Museum and guide.,5.0,,"Quite a humbling experience and made more so by an excellent and knowledgeable guide Helena, a 4th generation Singaporean Helena left no question unanswered and has a deep understanding of the sacrifices made by the soldiers and interns during WW2. The chapel and museum were very well displayed and the timeline well informed, use the audio."
,,Educational tour of the Changi Museum,4.0,,"The chapel is a replica of the real one. Entering it was eye opening for one who would want to know what the war years were like. I was mesmerized by the accounts and the morbid pictures of the horrors of those victims and the abuse by the Japanese soldiers. I was the last to exit the museum. The Bark Cafe has a nice ambiance and the chicken wings were excellent, One could cool down with cocktails or mocktails."
,,changi prison museum,4.0,,This was a very emotional and educational day that was also fulfilling and enjoyable. The old prison is long gone but the museum is on the old site. I expected to be in and out in an hour. I was there for over 3 hours. An experience that I will not forget and highly recommend.
,,Smaller than expected,2.0,,"I would have thought that remembering those who suffered in WW2 would deserve something larger than this museum which is very small and comprised mostly of a replica chapel. Overpriced books, no guide, no advise to use the audio-found it a bit insulting to the war dead and survivors really."
,,Worth Visiting to know about the history of Singapore,4.0,,"This museum is dedicated to all the people who lived and died the in the World War II in Changhi, Singapore. It gives complete idea about the history of Singapore in very nicely. It was started in the Old Chaghi Prison Chapel in 1988. This was relocated to new replica of chapel next to the prison on 15th Feb. 2001, the 59th anniversary of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. The virtual museum is also launched from December 2014. Worth visiting if you are interested in the history."
,,Very small but very moving place.,3.0,,The presentation of what is there is great and very moving place to visit and get a better understanding of what the Australian soldiers went through. The place is very small which was surprising.
,,Sad and yet uplifting two hoursw,5.0,,"We were staying at the Crowne Plaza Changi and had some time to kill. This was an excellent choice. It is beautifully presented with a balanced point of view. Although we are history buffs, there was plenty of new info and some touching displays of artefacts from those once imprisoned there. A short $10 taxi ride from the hotel and close to Changi village if you want to go on to dine.."
,,Changi Museum,5.0,,"Very well set out and very informative. An emotional place to visit but so important to get the full perspective of the impact of the war on Singapore, from all aspects."
,,A humbling experience,5.0,,"A humbling and emotional experience. Educational and confronting at times, it has all the details of the Changi prison camps and the associated tragic and sad stories to go with them. A humbling reminder of the tortures of war. Well designed, we took our 10 and 6 year old with us and each of us shared a headset. The kids enjoyed listening to all the stories and hunting around together for each consecutive number to listen to. A worth whilst experience for every generation and a grim reminder of the cruelty of war."
,,Small museam only for those with a particular interest in this aspect of history,3.0,,"Small and free but a bit out of the way unless you have a particular interest in the war experience in Singapore
I wouldn't really recommend it
You may have difficulty getting a taxi out we were lucky as its not in a tourist area it is close to the airport"
,,History in bit size chunks!,5.0,,We used the audio guide to take us through this attractive museum and chapel that is dedicated to the Japanese invasion of Singapore and the aftermath. Very professional audio and exhibits making it very easy to spend 1-2 hours. The museum is accessible by MRT and bus. There is a pleasant outdoor cafe.
,,Sadness and Serenity,5.0,,"I saw a documentary on the Japanese Invasion of Singapore once, and ever since then I was very curious to visit this place. Recently was in the vicinity and hence decided to pay an impromptu visit.

There's this particular serenity and sadness about this place that I just can't describe. A good time for quiet reflection as one gets to view the photographs on display as well as listening to the audio depicting real life experiences of men and women being held captive under during the Occupation. Informative yet moving as it shows the suffering yet bravery of these POWs.

At the end of the chapel I lighted a candle and left the place with a lump in my throat."
,,An excellent museum - moving and educating!,5.0,,Get the MTR to Tanah Merah and then a no 2 bus from right outside the station to the door with a bus stop right outside for the return. An excellent portrayal of a truly awful time in the Second World War. Moving stories from survivors of a Black time in the history of the World.
,,"Very moving, informative and emotionally challenging",5.0,,My wife found her Great Grandfather listed in the Japanese Prisoner logs. The exhibits were very interesting and the replica Chapel had special moments. Take a hanky if British.
,,A quiet reflection,5.0,,"We went here on Remembrance Sunday 2015 - the service is at 8am so be early - very easy to get to - take the MTR and it's a 500m walk from there.

Very peaceful and if you have been to the arboretum in England it's very similar. - a great thing to do any time of the year."
,,A Moving Experience,5.0,,"During a recent stay to Singapore I had the opportunity to visit The Changi Museum. I found the experience incredibly moving.

My late father served during WW2 in the British Navy (HMS Indefatigable). His ship was bombed by the Japanese as they fought in the Coral sea.
Although a very young man at the time, he had vivid memories of this (having had the unpleasant task of being a stretcher bearer). He always felt proud of having served his country during the war, and as a family, we were all very proud of him too! With my father's history having served during the war, prompted me to want to visit this museum.
Visiting the Changi Museum (as with any other war memorial), my heart swelled with an enormous sense of pride and gratitude towards all those brave men and women who fought during WW1 and 2.

This museum, through the displays and audio presentations in particular, really brings home how much suffering took place at the hands of the barbaric Japanese army towards our POW's and the people of Singapore. I was moved to tears listening to stories shared through the audio headphones.
The displays are very informative, there are a couple of images (be warned) that are rather disturbing to see (and to steer the little ones away from), but sadly, that's how it was.

The chapel was also very interesting to see. You can light a candle pin a note on the board provided.

I would highly recommend visiting this museum.
It's an important part of the history of Singapore and should never be forgotten."
,,Most interesting day trip,5.0,,This is a great insight into part of the history of what the people of Singapore went threw during the war .
,,Lest we forget!,5.0,,"Changi Museum and Chapel are an excellent source of information about the difficult times experienced by many in the early 1940's. A really well curated memorial that should be on everyone's itinerary, as a reminder of just how difficult life was in those very dark days."
,,Very rewarding place to take grandchildren,5.0,,"I took one grandchild last year and look forward to taking another next year. I think as an Australian, it is very necessary visit for our grandchildren to realise what their forebears have been through for them."
,,Must go for any Australian,5.0,,"Took my wife and 2 teenage children. By the end of it my 16yr daughter asked if we could go the Australian National Museum in Canberra to learn more. Seeing and touching history is a lot different to reading about it. Yes it is a little bit out of the way and yes it isn't a big place, but absolutely worth it. Do the audio tour to get even more out it and light a candle in the chapel at the end."
,,Poignant and interesting experience always.,4.0,,"Interesting museum though small. A good look at local history during the Japanese occupation of Malaya and Singapore. A bit out of the city. Take a the MRT and then a connecting bus to get there. A fairly good cafe available for lunch etc. Lovely environment but service standards needs a boost. The museum staff can be more friendly in the future, I hope."
,,Tragic reminder of war,5.0,,"I am always fascinated by war and its consequences so this place meant something to me. This place is a piece of the puzzle of Singapore's WWII history and a reminder of the atrocity of the Japanese, a martial race of samurais and bushido. The poor defeated were slaughtered like sheep or tortured like tortoises. Churchill's words meant little to these poor souls here.
If you do come here, you should also try to go to the eastern extremity of Singapore, which is Changi Point and perhaps take a boat to visit Pulau Ubin, where you can see what Singapore was like 70 years back."
,,Changi War Trail and Museum,5.0,,"CHANGI WWII™ - A WAR TRAIL BY CHANGI MUSEUM is a trail that should be visited by tourists and locals alike! There's so much to see, hear and read at the museum. Knowledge gathered helps to value-add to what had been taught in schools! At the end of the trail I had a deeper understanding of Singapore's history and learnt to show more appreciation to those who have sacrificed regardless of race, language or religion."
,,Good to find out about the history of SG,5.0,,"Lots of interesting info on SG during the occupation by the Japanese, tells of the hardships all cultures felt during this time."
,,Dont waste time,1.0,,It is far away from city and nothing much to see there. Dont waste time. Can accessible by public transport. I dont see the attraction at all
,,"Very moving, done extremely well",5.0,,definitely worth a visit. museum done very well indeed. was very informative and moving. my husband and I booked on the coach trip to go and see a few other sites around Changi; think the tour is part of the museum
,,Changi Museum,4.0,,It is a place to visit to remind all of us about the history of the past and hopefully not to repeat it.
,,Moving,4.0,,"This is a really lovely attraction to visit. The story of Changi is a sad tale, very respectfully told, that is a great tribute to the human spirit. It's also lovely to get out of the inner city and see a different side of Singapore. We caught the bus, which was easy, and the helpful driver told us where to get off. After seeing the museum we enjoyed a coffee in the restaurant. I would recommend the Changi Museum to anyone visiting Singapore."
,,Important History Lesson,4.0,,"The Museum is quite smaller than expected, with only a part of the Changi Gaol wall still standing. A lot to read, which brings home the terrible experiences of the prisoners during WW2"
,,Moving and highly recommended to feel the nature of war,5.0,,"Visited the museum and was really moved - it is difficult to explain but you need to visit this and read and listen to all the accounts. This will make you think about war and its repercussions, the effect on people it has."
,,Changi WWII War Trail and Museum Tour,5.0,,"The museum itself was very moving, but this tour made the experience that much more memorable. In addition to the museum, you are taken to several other sites that were historically significant to the Singapore war effort during WW II. Our tour guide, Helena, was excellent. She's a native of Singapore and she was able to incorporate parts of her own history to the narrative. She was a wealth of knowledge and it was easily apparent that the trials and tribulations of Singapore during that time period were important to her. If you want to learn about the mindset of Singapore, past and present, this tour is a must."
,,Moving,5.0,,If you are interested in ww2 history definitely go. It is a bit of a way out of the city but ok to get here on the mrt and taxi. Take the audio tour to hear the words from the survivors of the Japanese invasion. Very moving
,,Historic lesson,5.0,,"As ex RAF Vet having served in Singapore early seventies, I felt it necessary to learn more of the Japanese occupation and the suffering endured by so many. The museum is well laid out and presented in an extremely respectful way and takes you on a very emotional journey"
,,To honor and remember those of WW2,5.0,,The museum is dedicated to the interns who stayed at Changi Prison during WW2. We should not forget the cruelty of war and that it also brings out the worse in mankind
,,Well presented history of Singapore's occupation. Very moving.,5.0,,Well presented history of Singapore's occupation. Very moving. Do take the audioguide. Helpful staff.
,,A solemn moment,4.0,,"We viisted the museum on a short trip to Singapore. I thought the museum and its exhibit was sad but at the same time inspiring that in the middle of such horror there were tales of inspiration, good deeds and the way the human spirit can survive.

I found the information very interesting but I would have preferred for the exhibits to be arranged in a chronological order. We used the audio tour which added to some interesting detail. The member of staff on duty at the reception desk was very helpful and friendly.

The museum can be eaily reached by bus SBS route 2."
,,"Lest we forget- A Story of Suffering, Humanity and Resilience",5.0,,"Most visitors to Singapore marvel at the modern metropolis and how far it has come over the past half century. The popular destinations in this island nation are the Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands Resort, Resorts World Sentosa and the Singapore Zoological Gardens. These landmarks tell the story of a successful multi-racial nation-state that, having been unceremoniously thrust into independence, fought against overwhelming odds to become a thriving first-world economy.

The Changi Museum and Chapel is not on the usual list of visitor attractions. This is probably because it is not, strictly speaking, an attraction at all. There are no magnificent structures, no rides for the children, no 4-D special visual effects, no restaurants (certainly no McDonalds), and no souvenir shops selling shirts with the ubiquitous ""I Love Singapore"" or ""My friend visited Singapore and all he got me was this lousy t-shirt"" messages. Tour operators will not receive any commission for bringing tourists to this place. There isn't even an admission fee to the Museum. If that is not bad enough, the 'Chapel' is not even the original building which was originally sited in what is now the Changi Prison Complex. The then Home Minister decided that it was impractical to maintain a significant historical monument in a working prison and ordered that it be demolished. The present 'Chapel' is merely a replica.

So, instead of a fun activity-filled raucous itinerary, this is what the Changi Museum and Chapel offers:

The place offers a quiet space that provides a historical account of how the British lost Malaya and Singapore to the Japanese Imperial Army; it tells how the arrogance and poor military tactics of the British Colonial authorities led to a swift and humiliating capitulation of the British military. Yet, despite the fumbling decisions of the British authority, there are stories of brave men from Britain Australia, New Zealand,India and Singapore who continued to resist the Japanese Imperial Army at every turn until the British surrender on 15 February 1942.

What follows next are personal accounts of a cruel life under the Japanese Occupation. There are accounts from the starved sickly prisoners of war and of the resilient, inventive locals who made much of little. All the stories tell of the anguish, humanity and hope of a community living in an inhuman environment.

The third chapter tells of the Japanese surrender, and how the British Colonial Masters returned to a changed people. It's not a long chapter because the other monuments around Singapore tell this part of the story.

And finally, the Chapel. The Chapel brings the various narratives together. Although only a replica, it is no less poignant as a place for the visitor to sit a while and reflect on the stories recounted in the Museum. Most importantly, the point of the stories, of the Museum and Chapel, is not to chastise the Japanese or British, but to remind us of the inhumanity that war brings. At the Memorial Board on the left of the Chapel, there are several garlands of Senbazuru (thousand origami cranes) offered by visiting groups of Japanese students. Each garland represents a wish that we will never again have to experience another war.

What the Changi Museum and Chapel offers then, is a place for stories about Singapore from 1941 to 1945; it tells the stories through the lives of the many different people who lived through those times; it promises to leave a deeper, perhaps even transformational, experience that none of the other Singapore attractions can offer.

Its message is simple - Lest we forget."
,,Sad part of Singapore's history,4.0,,"A very moving museum located not far from the original Changi Gaol. It's reminder of the Japanese occupation of Singapore and their appalling treatment of British, Australian, Indian POW's and not forgetting the ill treatment of the civilians from Malaya & Singapore. To get there I travelled from City Hall in city centre out to Tanah Merah then took bus No2 out to Changi Village. The museum is just pass the present day Changi Prison. I asked the bus driver to tell us when to get off and he was more then happy to help. It's free to get in but they do charge $8 for the audio tour. I'd suggest paying that as its got ex POW's historically recorded on it telling their terrible accounts while been held in captivity in Changi not to mention other interesting stuff..."
,,"Unknown piece of Singapore history to most foreigners, must visit!",5.0,,"Pleasantly surprised to visit this museum. Located in a quiet and far away place, not too crowded. Gives you a glimpse of Singapore history around WW II time. Very well maintained and presented. There is also a small chapel which is nice and quiet. Bonus was the cafe adjacent to the museum, which turned out to be excellent!"
,,Excellent museum,5.0,,I visited this museum on one of the Singapore Original Walks in June. Excellent tour.....but wanted to return and spend more time in the actual museum itself. Very moving place to visit.... and great cafe beside it for lunch/snacks.
,,Tragic,4.0,,This museum was very well presented with enough detailed information to keep you enthralled for some time. Was very interesting to see the local perspective of the occupation which is often missed in accounts of the Australian POW accounts. Well worth the $8 for the audio tour.
,,The least you can do to pay your respects,5.0,,"The horrors of the Japanese invasion and occupation of Singapore on the allied forces and locals were devastating and long lasting. The museum provides an eye opening but tasteful insight into the events that transpired.
A respectful and emotional way to honor those that gave so much. Light a candle and reflect on how such a lovely place as Singapore was born from such terrible sacrifice.
Staff are most helpful."
,,"Interesting, sad, very well presented.",4.0,,"It was very interesting, but sad, to visit this very well displayed museum. It was like walking thru a library, very quiet and moving. Amazing photos and displays. Well worth the visit."
,,Emotional,5.0,,"From the moment you walk through the doors, you can feel the respect and emotion of the era. A wonderful tribute to humanity."
,,"Visit , dwell, think , appreciate",5.0,,"A museum that delivers without pretension and how appropriate ! Make the effort to go, as its quite a way from the city centre . You will come away a better informed person."
,,Thought provoking museum.,5.0,,I went here as my father came to Singapore at the end of WW11. He spent 3 years putting Singapore back together. I had many photographs and wanted to visit the areas he had spoken about. People in the museum very helpful and gave me books to look at which had the same pictures in as my photographs and they were able to tell me about what remained and what has gone. Thank you.
,,A time to remember,5.0,,"This prison is a eye opener for the public .What the prisoners had to go through was unbelievable.There are plenty of space to collect your thoughts,and say a silent prayer"
,,This needs time so make your own way to Changi,4.0,,"As a child I was aware the fathers of several friends had spent time in Changi Prison during World War II. However, it was not until last week that I actually saw the site of such suffering. During a brief stopover in Singapore, we decided on a half-day tour with a museum visit as the focal point. While the tour itself provided a good overview of the Changi military and prison area, the most interesting part of the drive was through the high-rise suburbs of Singapore. The original Changi Prison has largely been torn down and the museum and chapel are located in a new building. In hindsight, I would not have tried to see this memorial to wartime suffering on a tour because the hour allotted was not nearly enough. I found myself clock-watching as I shuffled along in the crowd of people from the bus and did not really take much in. We later saw there were public buses that travel to the Changi area. They seemed a better bet."
,,A must see if you have the time,5.0,,"An moving tribute to the suffering of the wartime population of Singapore. Not easy to get to, but well worth the time spent getting there."
,,A shame that they hadn't kept the original buildings.,3.0,,Do the visit on your own. We did this as part of a City Tour. Didn't have enough time to have a really good look around.
,,Chilling and sombre memorial to the soldiers who died there.,5.0,,Must do trip if you visit Singapore. Very sobering experience and memorial. Short day trip easy to get to.
,,Interesting,3.0,,Went to Changi War museum which is about 30 minutes away from Singapore. It was quite interesting and walked quite sad of what happened to the POWS and how the suffering of the people. Recommend if you are history buff.
,,"Small, but Fascinating",4.0,,"This museum, outside of the city of Singapore, provides a good overview of the Japanese occupation of Singapore. Plan on 60-90 minutes, longer if you are particularly interested in WWII."
,,A Real Sense of History,4.0,,My grandfather was a prisoner at Changi during the war so this was very interesting. The museum is able to capture the sadness and reliance.
,,Very moving experience.,5.0,,"We did this as part of a round the island day tour of Singapore with Viator. I have always wanted to go there and pay my respects, it is very worthwhile to see and also confronting. Recommended to see."
,,Changi Museum and Chapel - eye opening,5.0,,"The museum is located in the outer areas of Singapore, not far from Changi airport. We were staying in Bras Basah and decided after reading other traveller reviews to take the MRT to the closest station (Tanah Merah) which is fairly straight forward and took about 30mins each way. From here you can either take a bus (#2) or take a cab. I'm not great with taking buses so we opted for a cab each way which was about $8 each way or so, and its about a 15min cab ride. The bus stations are located opposite to the MRT.

The museum is small but there is lots of reading to do/things to see. We also did the audio tour which I found to have extra information such as stories, opinions etc than what was on display, plus this was at your own pace. Some of the stories told on the audio tour I felt painted a good picture of the POW aspect.

I left with a greater understanding of WW2, Singapore and The Japanese Imperial Army. Worth a visit."
,,"Without the past, we won't be here",4.0,,A place packed with lots of memories from the past. Not a very accessible place and far out from most commercial malls but a place you have to visit at least once to know how much people went through for the peace and prosperity we have today.
,,WW2 Veterans visit,5.0,,"We visited here as a part of 37 passengers on a Far East Prisoner of War Pilgrimage from the united kingdom. This is an excellent museum telling the stroy of the battle for Singapore in 1942 and the subsequent capitulation. It then follows the plight of the prisoners of War with very accurate accounts, photos and artefacts."
,,Changi Museum and Chapel,4.0,,"We got to Changi Museum and Chapel by taking the MRT to Tanah Merah station then taking the number 2 bus to the museum. The museum is located at the stop after the woman's prison.

The original Changi Prison Museum was demolished in 2000 when Changi Prison was expanded. This new museum is 1 KM away from the original museum site. Entry is free.

The museum displays information about Singapore in the war and in particular what it was like to be a prisoner of war in Changi Prison.

I found the museum interesting and moving, but was not so pleased that it was forbidden to take photos inside. I wanted photos of the chapel murals, easily solved as I just bought the postcards, but I also wanted a photo of the quilts the women prisoners made and the prison cell door. There did not seem to be postcards of these.

I don't know what the original museum was like, but it is a shame they do not have a replica of a cell here as that would have been interesting. Instead they had an outline of a typical cell on the floor, but a model of a cell would have been better.

The museum had lots of interesting old photos and paintings and drawings done by the prisoners. These showed what life was like for them here. There were quotes from people involved in the prison which portrayed the prison from all angles: prisoners, guards, people living nearby. I thought this was good.

In the garden there was a replica chapel and the Changi Cross. The Changi Cross was made by Staff Sergeant Harry Stogden of the 18th Division Royal Army Ordnance Corps from a 4.5 inch Howitzer shell.

Part of Changi Museum is a replica of a Chapel. Its walls are decorated with copies of the Changi Murals.

The Changi Murals are five paintings created by Stanley Warren. Warren was a British prisoner-of-war. He was interned at Changi Prison, during the Japanese occupation of Singapore in World War II. He was a religious man and had worked as a commercial designer before the war.

His murals are amazing because he painted them while weak and ill with dysentry and in terrible pain. He also had very limited access to materials.

At the end of the war the murals were covered over and forgotten about. They were rediscovered in 1959, but no-one knew who had painted them.

A newspaper campaign was mounted in Britain by the Daily Mirror to locate the artist and Warren was eventually found in 1959. He was asked to return to Singapore to help restore his murals, but his experiences there had been so horrific he refused. After a great deal of persuasion, Warren came out to Singapore three times between 1963 and 1988 to restore his work.

One mural remains incomplete as it was badly damaged in the war and Stanley Warren died before he could finish restoring it.

The murals saved Warren's life. In September 1942, just a few weeks after he began his painting he was informed that his work party was to be sent to Thailand to help build the Thai-Burma Railway. A colonel in charge of the hospital stepped in and had Warren kept behind to finish his paintings. Almost all the men in his work party died building the railway.

The murals depict the Nativity, the Ascension, the Crucifixion, the Last Supper and the unfinished St Luke in Prison.

The original murals still exist in an army barracks, the ones in the museum chapel are replicas but they are still very very moving and wonderful to see.

There was a gift shop with postcards and books about Changi in the museum. Staff helped people research information about relatives who were imprisoned at Changi which I thought was good, too.

Next to the museum there is a cafe and toilets."
,,So we can not forget,5.0,,The museum is well set out even though it is not large. It was very informative especially from the Singaporian people's experiences. Coming from Australia we have heard of our countries experience during the WWII in Singapore this gave a better understanding a better rounded view.
,,Humbling,4.0,,"I love history but felt very shocked and humbled after visiting the Changi Museum and discovering through photos and stories of all the atrocities that were committed in Singapore during the 2nd World War. I had read and saw some documentaries on the subject but these were personal stories which really hit hard of the suffering and bravery of so many.

The museum is set up in stages and you can also hire a headset giving you a guide around the area which I did. There are a lot of paintings, photos and personal effects of POW's.

You are not allowed to take photographs but there is a nice garden bar next door where the staff are really nice and helpful and will arrange a taxi for you if required."
,,sad peaceful place,4.0,,worth a visit and sad it was free as we would have liked to give a donation. Very peaceful well worth the visit if only to make you realise the stupidity of war and what evil one human will do to another. Thought provocing.
,,Interesting titbits on the World War,4.0,,"Its a small museum but its completely free! However, if one wants the audio guide then there is a small fee. The admissions guy was so nice and sweet.
The exhibits were snapshots in the lives of people then - stories from a lot of well known people. It was interesting to note how even with the tainted eyes, it seemed to me to be written through the eyes of Singapore's colonial masters.
After the exhibition, there is a nice little open air chapel.
Its a nice way to spend a serene morning but it is a bit of a trek to come all the way here"
,,Moving,4.0,,"If you are staying in Singapore this is easily available by public transport, no need to use a taxi. The number two bus from the train takes about ten minutes and returns every 15minutes. The museum is free but the $8 SPD is worth spending on the recorded tour. The history of this POW camp needs to be a reminder to us all to stop wars."
,,Lest we forget,4.0,,The Changi museum pays homage to all those who lost their lives in WWII especially the POWs interned here. There are personal letters and effects on display and you can pin a note of your own on the board. Why not pop into The Bark Cafe for a spot of lunch or refreshment when you've finished the tour
,,Extraordinary,5.0,,This is an extraordinary experience. My tip is to ensure you do not tag on to a tour but to view each exhbit quietly by yourself.
,,History and culture,3.0,,"The museum is little tired and in need of some tlc but was very interesting. There are walls of information, soldiers writings, possessions and their conditions are very clearly labelled and placed around the walls. There is a replica of a chapel that is now located at Duntroon in which the men would seek spiritual comfort in what can't be imagined as other than tragic times. Very sobering and thought provoking."
,,Lest we should forget !,5.0,,"A sober reminder of the past. A reminder of the 'stories' my father told me of that terrible time suffered by the local population and the military. Recommended visitors make use of the audio tour.

A big thank you to the lady on bus who gave us directions, and to the friendly and helpful bus driver on the return journey who helped us to negotiate back to the MRT station"
,,Well worth the visit,4.0,,"The museum was a very humbling experience. Ensure you take the audio sets, they make the visit. Listening to the oral history and to the survivors stories was amazing and touching."
,,Moving,5.0,,"Well worth a visit. Not for the faint hearted but the peaceful location gives you the opportunity to reflect on the horrors of the past and, sadly, the fact that these types of things are still happening elsewhere in the world."
,,A moving tribute a must visit,5.0,,"A very educational and sensitive collection in memorial to Singapore turbulent times during the Japanese occupation. It's very important these times are not forgotten. The Chapel, although a reproduction of the original, provides a peaceful spot for contemplation after seeing the exhibits. I very much recommend this as a place to visit during a trip to Singapore, a very real reflection of that piece of history and very well maintained."
,,Humbling and fascinating,5.0,,A brilliant museum which provides a very human perspective on the Japanese occupation of Singapore. We opted to pay extra for audio tour which was well worth the money. Recommended.
,,Acient,5.0,,I went to Singapore for a vacation last year and couldn't say much about this museum. It was a great place to visit if anyone went to Singapore . I recommend for all to visit the museum thank you
,,Confronting but interesting,4.0,,"This is not a place to take children, there are very graphic photos and displays as part of the museum. That said, it is well worth the visit to learn about this important part of Singapore's history."
,,lest we forget,4.0,,The museum takes about an hour or two taking in all there is to learn. It has some very sobering information about this very sad and trying time in Singapore's history. I signed up for a walking tour which included the museum which was a mistake as we spent about 40 minutes on a bus getting very little additional information and paid S$50 for the privilege. Visit the museum on your own and it's free.
,,Changi Chapel and Museum,5.0,,We travelled there by SMRT and bus which was easy to do. Very moving experience to view all the exhibition and to read all the captions.
,,A Must-visit,5.0,,"Really fascinating visit to Changi Museum. Cost about 20 Singapore Dollars each way in a taxi from Orchard Road (it seemed a bit complicated using the train and bus) but entry to the museum is free. The museum itself is quite small but, even so, we found it contained enough interesting information to keep us there for almost two hours. So sad to see how the inmates of Changi Prison (and the locals) were treated by the invading Japanese and how much is still owed to those people and their families who had to experience the traumatic mental and physical repercussions on the return of the inmates after the surrender of the Japanese."
,,Not my favourite,3.0,,I was disappointed with this attraction. I had imagined being really drawn into the world of the prison. I know you don't visit the actual prison but there are many other places in the world where such a famous place would have some sort reconstruction to show what the conditions etc. were like. Instead of photos etc. The chapel was good to see but not enough for me. The Battle Box in Fort Canning Park was much more interesting and much cheaper to visit.
,,To see the Buddhas's tooth relic,5.0,,"so pretty and well maintained Buddhist temple located in the end of China town. it everyday open for public and the 4th story of too closed at 6 pm. so quite and peace full environment. the staff of this temple was so nice and friendly. Recommending to visit this temple for every Buddhist visit SG, to see the Buddha's tooth as a rear opportunity of their life."
,,Simple and moving,5.0,,This is not a whizz bang interactive museum with things that glow and click and buttons to push. Its simply a place to be reflective and consider and stop for a moment. Spend some time here
,,Get the audio tour...,5.0,,"Came here a few years ago and wanted to come back with some friends who hadn't visited. Did the audio tour this time which was really worth it. Set aside at least a couple of hours. It's a part of history I wasn't really aware of (apart from watching Tenko) and something everyone should find out about if you're in Singapore. Really well done and very moving. If you're looking for a food option nearby, get a taxi to the East Coast Seafood Centre for some chilli crab or the Changi Village hawker centre. It's also really close to the airport if you only have a short stopover."
,,Museum,4.0,,This place unlike everything else in Singapore is real and tells you about Singapore's history and its time during WW11.
,,Sombre Place to Recall Singapore's Past,4.0,,"Entrance is free, though a donation is requested in the chapel. A well thought out, small museum. Make sure to also include the Johore Battery on your visit as it is close by, and all connected historically. Lest We Forget."
,,A moving visit. we must never forget,5.0,,"Changi Museum is worth seeking out. We were able to negotiate the MRT and bus to get to the museum easily. Lunch at Changi Village is recommended.
The museum presents the story of the men interred during WW11 along with their captors and the deeds of many locals.The stories are moving and inspirational.
Lest we forget."
,,Somber and moving exhibits,5.0,,"The museum at Changi Chapel is well thought out and moving tribute to all those who suffered under the occupation of Singapore during WWII.
Personal accounts and photographs added to the impact of the displays. Worth the trip out of Singapore CBD to see this museum."
,,Lesson learned?,4.0,,Moving and it shows why the people of Singapore today have male conscription and a strong defence force. They feel they were let down by their British rulers and left at the mercy of the murderous Imperial Japanese Army. The lesson has been learned that they must be prepared to defend themselves as well as run a thriving economy.
,,Emotional and challenging,5.0,,"My late great-uncle was taken POW when Singapore fell in WWII, and having visited Singapore on many occasions I made the trip recently to the museum. While a very simply laid out museum it does not detract from, in fact it accentuates, the exhibits. Quietly walking around the halls you were conscious of the tears falling down the faces of the many grown men who were present - I have never been moved by anything such as this before. If in Singapore it really is worth the visit - and easy to get to/from the city centre itself ($15 for a taxi)"
,,Very emotional,5.0,,As an Australian this museum should be on everyone's bucket list to realise what all those men went through to give us our freedom. Men from all nations gave their lives so that we could be free. Very emotional.
,,A journey into Singapore's struggle in WWII,5.0,,"There is a lot of reading to do at this Museum, the objects on display do not tell the story by themselves. That said, the Museum shows the harrowing story of Singapore under the occupation of the Japanese during WWII, as well as the brutal Japanese treatment of prisoners of war. The experience is uplifting when you observe the strength of human spirit and compassion on display"
,,Very very moving,5.0,,"We made a point of going again to this museum as my brother n laws father spent three years in Changi during WW2.
An easy train and bus ride out. We had a helpful bus driver who pointed out where it was when we alighted.
Inside, no cameras, there is the choice of just walking through and reading or paying for a audio system.
Moving through and reading the messages and seeing the pictures, I could feel the presence and horror of what those prisoners endured at the hands of their captors.
Not a place to take small children due to the silence due to the silence requested of patrons plus it would incur on the privacy of anyone there remembering.
A place to visit,yes. A place to reflect, yes.
I happened to talk to a elderly Singaporean lady who was in her early teens during the Japanese occupation. When she spoke of the period one could see the pain reflected in her eyes. Sad."
,,Very respectful tribute to the victims of Japanese occupation,4.0,,Very well done and very reasonably priced. If you're interested in the history of Singapore then this is a must.
,,"New, local, perspective",4.0,,Although quite small the museum is packed with information and artefacts. For me the most impressive element is that the story is told from the perspective of Singaporeans as well as the major military countries involved. A truly moving and poignant experience.
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,"We took one of the arranged tours of the WWII sites and Changi museum as my wife's father had been held there by the Japanese. The tour was exceptional. Our guide, ""Sha"", was sensitive, knowledgeable and engaging and he made this a most memorable (if harrowing) visit."
,,Thought provoking,5.0,,"If you have little or no knowledge of what happened in Singapore under the Japanese occupation, but wanted to know, this is the place to visit. Although it focuses primarily on the treatment of British and Allied prisoners of war, it also gives an insight into conditions for the civilian population. A must visit location in my humble opinion."
,,Well worth the visit!,4.0,,"Changi Museum is a bit out of the way, however we felt the hour it took to get there was worth it. We travelled by MRT and bus which stopped right outside. Entry is free and we chose to read all the displays however there is an audio guide available for $8.

The museum provides a lot of background information from the point of view of all the parties concerned and is a moving tribute with many original artifacts on display. We learned much about the time and many of the stories were provided first hand by those who were involved at the time. We found it of great interest having connections to a couple of POW's incarcerated during WW2."
,,Heartbreaking stories,5.0,,"It was a privilege to go through the Changi Museum as my husband had two uncles that had been prisoners of war. One of them was a prisoner in Singapore and it was very heart breaking to see how he would have suffered. It is also wonderful to see that all of the memories are kept alive, hopefully to remind people that this kind of suffering must stop."
,,changi museum,3.0,,we went on coach trip to here not a lot to see would be of interest to people who lived through the japanese occupation coach trip about 30 dollars
,,CHANGI MUSEUM,5.0,,"We visited the Changi Museum with ""The Original Singapore Walks'. Our guide Sharul gave us a very informative and interesting tour of the museum. We were fortunate that it was a small group and Sharul was able to allow plenty of time to explain the museum. He knowledge was nothing short of excellent. Would certainly return to spend more time here! Recommend Journeys the tour operators as a reliable compant to deal with. Full marks."
,,Changi WWII War Trail and Museum Tour,5.0,,"We met at the train station and hopped on an air-conditioned coach. Our guide for the afternoon, Sharul (Shar) talked to us on the way to the museum. Shar works at the museum and was very knowledgable about the history, as well as being able to share more in depth stories with us. Once at the museum, Shar talked to us at the chapel, and explained the history of the recreated chapel, and how it came to be. He also told us the story of a family who were linked to the one original WWII artefact within the chapel. Shar then took us around several of the displays within the museum, again adding more detail and stories of the people within or behind each display. This was much more information than we ever could have found out by going through the museum by our selves.
There were two further parts of the tour, being driving (on the coach) to the 15 inch replica gun a short distance away, and then to Changi Beach. Again Shar provided more information that was available at the site itself.
The tour was very informative, sincere and moving. Shar was a brilliant guide and I would recommend anyone visiting the area to include the tour on their list of things to do and see."
,,Singapore WW11 Tour - Changi Museum War Trail,5.0,,"The best ever! Shan our tour guide was impressive, his knowledge and moving stories made the whole tour come to life. I didn't know much about the Singapore WW11 history before this tour I now have a very good understanding of what happened during the Japanese invasion to the prisoners of war. I highly recommend this tour and is on the top of our list of what to do in Singapore. Thank you Shan for a very moving 3.5 hours of history"
,,A moving experience...,5.0,,"Traveled there by bus. Very convenient stops. Plan to spend a bit of time here. A very moving experience, emotionally charged."
,,Simple but interesting,4.0,,"Interesting piece of Singapore's history. Some photos and artifacts, but mostly descriptions of historical events. Tastefully done."
,,Be prepared to shed a tear,5.0,,"A very emotional experience, take some tissues! Well worth a visit it took us over 2 hours with the audio tour as kept stopping it to really take in what I was hearing! A really shocking part of history, but I now have a better understanding of it. Very pleased I was persuaded by my husband to go."
,,Interesting eye opene,5.0,,"Visited the museum after reading about it on here. Entrance is free. The information is illuminating at the museum, and handles a difficult subject well. It was good to hear stories from the original people which is available through the audio guide."
,,Well worth a visit and close to airport,4.0,,"A great way to visit the museum is to go on your way to the airport, it is very close by. You can get a taxi to the museum and museum staff kindly store your luggage for you while you look around, when you are finished at the museum it is then only a short fare to the airport. Museum staff kindly rang for a cab for us.
It is free to get into the museum and we opted to get option audio sets to listen to a tour. We spent around 2 hours at the museum and it was a highly worthwhile experience."
,,Interesting,4.0,,Make sure you make use of the english commentary for each secrion. Worth paying out to get the full overview. Toilets are in the cafe next door. You have to pay to get in. Cant remember how much.
,,Moving place,4.0,,"very interesting and eye opener. Important place to visit and spend time in.
Be ready to read a bit (up to you how much), you can spend as much or as little time as you want, going between the photos and the stories.
we came in a raining day, I would recommend a taxi, the museum people booked us a taxi back, where very helpful."
,,Sad truth in history,3.0,,"A very somber reminder of WW2. A very small museum full of interesting memorabilia. The museum is sited in the old Changi Prison and is some distance out of the city in the suburbs, not the easiest location to reach but there is a bus stop right outside. Little tip, eat before you go as the restaurant located by the museum is expensive."
,,The horror of history,5.0,,"Learn what really happened to Singapore, the strength of its people against adversity.
The audio describes the moments in time that the world needs to learn from and ensure never happens again.
Tragic but true, take the time to remember those lost and take from their strength."
,,Sad history that no-one should forget,5.0,,This is not a museum to enjoy but one to remember what occurred to Singaporeans and the British and Australian armed forces captured. It was a moving experience. To read of the atrocities that occurred was disturbing but on teh other hand the displays show that no matter what extreme adversity can bring out the best and did among hte armed forces and Singaporean civilians
,,Lots of historical information in this museum,4.0,,"I have visited this museum a few times, but always after eating lunch at the restaurant located next door. I wish I had more time available to spend here as their appears to be a lot of historical information contained within a somewhat small museum.

For those interested in history and Singapore's involvement in WWII, this is a great place to start. I would probably not recommend this for families with younger children however as the majority of the museum exhibits are display cases and documents that might not provide as much interest to younger children."
,,Tales of Courage,5.0,,"The Changi Chapel is full of articles from the days of WW2,I have visited the Memorial many times,it is Heart wrenching,but necessary for younger generations to learn what happened & how the Prisoners coped,,also it tells of the plight of the civillians as well as the Soldiers,,The chapel can be reached using Bus number 2 from Singapore CBD or via MRT & Bus,It is a vital piece of ""Hallowed Ground"""
,,Must see,5.0,,"It was great to see such an interesting place as my husband's uncle was there during WW2. Great resources and very friendly, knowledgeable staff."
,,Very informative visit,5.0,,"Although this appears to be a relatively small place, there is lots to read. we also used the audio device which cost $8 but it explained everything. It was very informative.
The staff were very pleasant and helpful.
There are signs asking not to use cameras but people were.
I would recommend about three hours for the visit to take in all the information.
We went by taxi from the centre of Singapore and it cost $20. The nearest MRT station was a taxi ride away but I don't know exactly how far.
I wouldn't recommend you take young children"
,,Great visit,5.0,,This is a heavy museum to visit with all the story's on the wall about the treatment of prisoners and some the stuff that in the museum is very good worth a visit but need about half a day to read and take everything in
,,A very moving experience,5.0,,This museum portrays a very sad story of the cruelty and suffering inflicted on allied soldiers and the Singapore people during the Japanese occupation. A very moving experience.
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,"My husband and I were so impressed with our tour with Carol. We were so lucky to only have 6 in our group (4 Aussies and 2 Kiwis) and so she tailored the tour to what we wanted to hear and do. We could have spent almost 1 day listening to her and browsing through the museum, instead of the 3 hour visit. My husband’s father was a POW in Changi prison so being able to visit these areas, see the chapel (although not the original),wander through the museum, listen to the stories was a very moving and quite emotional experience. Being able to pay our respects also was so very important. The staff even printed out my husband’s father’s war history and details whilst he was imprisoned. There was so much to appreciate and we could have stayed longer…as it was we didn’t return back to Pasir Ris station till almost 6pm. It is an easy MRT trip to the meeting place and don’t be anxious if you wondering if you are at the right point for meeting your tour guide…literally stand at the steps at Exit B and she/he will be there around 2.00pm. Thank you Carol for an unforgettable experience."
,,Brings you back down to earth and realise the sacrifices made !,4.0,,"Well worth the time and effort, not difficult to find using the MRT and the local bus. The museum has an audio story telling device which is very interesting, some very good original documents and a well set out display of the atrocities the Japansese inflicted upon not only the British, Australian, Indian, New Zealand and other brave services, but also upon the Malayan and Singapore people's. Very moving"
,,Changi Musuem & guided tour,4.0,,"Booked guided two - 2 couples and guide. It was great and glad we did - well worth $12 each, then needed to go through museum ourselves to read and discover exhibits that the tour did not have time to cover. Museum is very small and you should know a bit of the history before you visit. Tour did not deliberately cover the atrocities committed by the Japanese soldiers but you did get a bit of understanding of how they were greatly outnumbered by the allied soldiers and still captured Singapore. Taxi from City $17 and 1 1/2 hr bus trip back as hard to get taxi for return."
,,Lest we Forget,5.0,,The Chapel is remarkable and the displays are extremely informative. There were many people present when I made my visit and yet the atmosphere was subdued and respectful. I left closed in deep thought.
,,Getting to Changi chapel and museum by public transport,5.0,,Caught the train from Chinatown station (changing at Outram Park) to Tampines voting $2.60. Caught bus 29 for $1.60 and alighted opposite the destination. The museum is very informative and has lots of interesting artefacts on display
,,Changi Chapel & Museum - Very Emotional Experience,5.0,,A very emotional experience. We used the audio tour and to hear from the mouths of actual survivors of the events during the fall of Singapore was very reflective. Nota huge attraction to see but full of history.
,,Be prepared to be moved,5.0,,"Quite a traumatic depiction of conditions, atrocities and the strength of the human spirit. No Photographs allowed. Allow plenty of time to fully peruse the excellent displays, explanations and reproductions of photographs and true stories."
,,Very small but very heart felt,4.0,,This is only small but really gives a sense of history. Many people have left messages for loved ones which is very touching and emotional
,,Change Museum,5.0,,Important place to visit to remember the past and horrors of war. Very well kept and important to future generations to understand what happened so we can live freely
,,Poignant; PoW Stanley Warren's murals; Harry Stogden’s Changi Cross.,4.0,,"Changi Chapel and Museum is a place which informs you of the atrocity of WWII in Asia. In the west, the teaching of the WWII focuses more on the suffering in the west, yet this museum in Singapore shares the similar painful history from another perspective.

Display: The displays were mainly posters and pictures and a few objects. You see lots of gruesome images too. You need to warn children beforehand before exposing them to some images.

St. Luke Chapel and Stanley Warren: There is a little replica of St. Luke chapel inside the museum, which also contains the replica of five uplifting Changi Murals created by PoW Stanley Warren. Stanley Warren painted the murals on two of the chapel’s walls between September 1942 and May 1943. These murals were originally located in Roberts Barracks Block 151 at the Changi Military Base, the former Changi Royal Air Force (RAF) base.

Stanley Warren’s Changi Murals and their captions include:

The Nativity: “Peace on earth to men of goodwill.”
The Ascension: “Go and teach the nations I am with you.”
The Crucifixion: “Father forgive them they know not what they do.”
The Last Supper: “Of the New Testament this is my blood which is shed for many.”
St. Luke in Prison: “Only Luke is with me.”

Changi Cross: At the entrance of the museum you will see a replica chapel, with a cross crafted by Sergeant Harry Stogden. Significantly the Changi Cross was made with a 4.5 inch Howitzer shell.

This museum is worth your visit to discover the hidden recent history in Singapore. However I feel that this museum needs to improve its storytelling, to link the past to the present, to connect better with its audience. The museum contains information, but how do we make the information relevant, to inform and inspire? This is a challenge."
,,A Very Moving Experiance,5.0,,"Visited here as part of a ""Round Island Tour"". The displays really put into perspective of what the prisoner's, both military and civilian went through, their ingenuity and their courage.A visit is Highly Recommended."
,,A sobering and worthwhile experience,4.0,,"I travel to Singapore for work a lot and I had been meaning to go for years but had never go around to it. I am really pleased that on this trip I took the time.
The museum isn't anything flash but it does tell the story of the fall of Singapore in WWII and the subsequent suffering of the Singaporean population really well. There are some heartbreaking stories and it provides a great insight into what has shaped Singapore of today. It's not a huge museum and you can easily get through in a couple of hours.
Entry into the museum is free, but I would strongly recommend hiring the audio guide - it was worth the 5 or so dollars I paid for it.
One thing to keep in mind is that it is located a long way from the Singapore CBD - next door to Changi Prison. You can get there by public transport, but it is a bit of a hike. I'd recommend you hire a taxi to get you there - it only take about 15 minutes and will cost less than $20."
,,"Far out of town, but worth the journey time if you are interested in learning about the Japanese occupation.",3.0,,This tiny museum and chapel provide the answers to questions you may have about the horrors of life in Changi Prison during the Japanese occupation of Singapore during the latter half of WW2.
,,Interesting history,4.0,,Very interesting historical museum. The displays really take you back to the war time and help you understand what it would have been like for the people living in Singapore at the time.
,,sad & sobering visit,5.0,,Very sobering visit here at the end of you 3 days in Singapore - as an Australian I found this very moving and a sad part of your history.
,,Moving and interesting experience,5.0,,"We visited Changi on a guided tour run by the Singapore historical society. We booked through the tourist information centre on Orchard Road, who were extremely helpful. The guide was friendly and knowlegeable. We made our way to a meeting point at an MRT station and met the tour guide there."
,,A sad story to tell,5.0,,A worthwhile visit if you any interest in the regions war history. Well laid out and good info on hand. Pretty grim story it tells but that was the 40's.
,,Interesting,4.0,,This is a very interesting museum to visit and be reminded of the terrible conditions endured by people during the occupation by the Japanese in WW2. Takes about one hour to visit. Nice cafe/restaurant on site. See the Change Museum website for instructions on MRT and bus numbers to catch.
,,Very informative,5.0,,Well worth the visit. The information provided is excellent and provides an insight into the suffering of the civilians and the military during the occupation of World War 2.
,,Interesting place to visit.,5.0,,Small but full of information. It is fascinating. I like to bring visitors here. There is also a small cafe to get refreshments. This is a nice place to visit en route to Pulau Ubin. It is well thought out and very thought provoking.
,,Inside View of World War II,5.0,,"Although small, the museum is very touching and gives you many views of the horrifying affects of war. Be sure to rent an audio device, it definitely is worth it for the museum. Story telling and pictures can give you so much about how much people went through in World War II.

There are frequent buses that pass by in front of the museum that you may take."
,,So much History and things to learn at this Museum.,5.0,,So much History and things to learn at this Museum. This is a must visit when visiting Singapore. Seeing what the Japanese did to prisoners of war during WWII is such an eye opener. We should never forget and never allow this to ever happen again.
,,Heartbreaking & moving,5.0,,I'm so glad we visited this chapel & museum. I was so overcome with grief after reading & listening to all the survivor accounts. It is a truly moving experience which should be part of everyone's trip to Singapore.
,,Great place to learn about Singaporean history.,5.0,,"My son and I went couple of weeks ago to visit this museum and we both enjoy the experience, the museum is very academic for adults and kids. Have a look if you have some time in Singapore."
,,Must see in Singapore,4.0,,This museum was great - it's pretty small but interesting.Two tips: public transport from the centre of town took us ages - cab is better. Also they shut the gates at 4.30 religiously so don't be late.
,,"Enlightening,but sobering Experience",5.0,,"The Changi Chapel and Museum is a sobering, but very worthwhile place to visit. Admission is free but we paid for an audio tour that gives extra information to that already in the displays. It is especially poignant to listen to former prisoners give harrowing details of their experiences. Not only does this museum display information about the male prisoners but also displays information about the women internees in Changi and the quilts they made to communicate with their menflik. The artwork of the prisoners and internees, especially the women internees, also provides an insight into their experience. We took the MRT to Tanah Merah and then caught the number 2 bus to the stop across the road from the Museum. The bus ride took us past the Changi jail and then past low rise apartments and single houses. This was an easy and interesting way to get to the museum."
,,Peaceful chapel and very interesting museum,4.0,,"My fiance and I travelled up to Changi Chapel and museum, parked up on our motorbike in their car park. We firstly walked around the museum, which was very informative into the war and it's background. I didn't know a lot about Singapore during the war, what happened the other side of the world and came away feeling like I knew a lot more. We walked out of the museum and into the area where the originally chapel still was held, which was very peaceful."
,,A place to remember,5.0,,"This museum provides a written and pictorial history of Changi prison and world war 2 in the Pacific. An important place for Australians who had relatives fighting in the war or imprisoned here. The chapel provides the opportunity to reflect and remember those who fought, survived and died."
,,Sobering Experience,5.0,,Extremely sobering. Would recommend it to those wanting some history and an insight into the fall of Singapore and the effect on its people.
,,Very Moving,5.0,,"This was a very moving place, we hired a guide who talked us through the whole place which I think is the best thing to do so you have a better understanding of the place and being Aussie this place was very significant to us."
,,Please visit,5.0,,This is a very sobering place to visit but is worth the time. You forget that it wasn't just Allied prisoners of war that suffered but Changi shows the true horror of this period. Well done to the people of Singapore for this sobering Musuem
,,A moving experience,5.0,,Having a grandmother who spent time as a pow in changi made this experience a very emotional one. Museum in very good shape and free of charge however I would recommend a paid audio guide only $8-. Also allow at least 2 hours to visit as there is plenty to see here.
,,Learn about World War 2 living conditions for POWs,4.0,,"This is located at the Eastern part of Singapore.

Here you can see the spartan and simple chapel used by the POWs during World War 2. There's even the Christian cross that was made from used ammunition casing by a POW who's was good with his hands.

There are many photos within the museum that shows the life of hardship during the Japanese Occupation.

An interesting exhibit is the Old Changi prison cell with actual dimensions marked on the floor. There's also an actual old wooden prison door from the old days.

This visit highlighted the importance of peace times that we are living in and the sacrifices that the soldiers went through, some even losing their lives. Salute them!

The location is a little out of the way, and I saw some tour buses bringing overseas visitors to this museum."
,,Moving and a must see for Australians,5.0,,"Well laid out, sensitively displayed history of a WWII Singapore incarceration of Australians, Brittish and others. Easy to get to by mrt and bus."
,,What a gem.,5.0,,What a find. This museum although a little difficult to find and get to is amazing. Very informative and interesting. It is well laid out. An absolute must for all tourists to Singapore.
,,A truly inspiring visit,5.0,,"We had Family friends who were here during the War and interned)and it was truly a location to visit during a stay in Singapore. Many Books have been written about the terrible atrocities here at Changi, but a visit here is truly Inspiring and not to be missed."
,,informative,5.0,,this is a good place to visit if you want to know more about how Singapore was affected by WW2. Do get the audio guide you will learn some interesting information.
,,a private visit for the appropriate commentary or group tour for more commercial,4.0,,"I visited Changi because of the war and find it very interesting, I did have a private guide giving us a full breakdown of the was camp etc, recommended."
,,Small tour made interesting by the tour guide and museum.,3.0,,"Visited the museum as part of a free tour (Changi and East Coast) we got in our trip package. Don't expect to see the original chapel as it was moved to Australia. This is a replica, typical of many chapels built during the war. The museum contains a very vivid account of the Singapore garrison surrender and subsequent horrors the local population and prisoners of war faced during the Japanese occupation. It is worth taking the time to read the plaques displayed."
,,Needed to see this,5.0,,Portrays the struggles and emotions of the occupation years. Quite moving. Recommend paying that little extra for the audio programme
,,Worth the trip especially if you like history,5.0,,"You can either catch a cab or get the no. 2 bus. Get off at the Changi Museum stop (one after the women's prison if you are heading in the Changi Beach direction). Entry to the museum is free and there is a moderate charge for an audio tour. You can take your time going to each display. The displays explain what life was like for civilians as well as captured soldiers. I don't find it anti-Japanese but its just very much to the point ie. this is what happened approach. Its all under AC and it has plenty places to sit if you get tired. The gift shop has some interesting books and knick-knacks. After the museum go and have a cool drink and something to eat at the adjoining Bark Cafe. The food and service is very good. Overall, I find it worth the trip out to Changi but if you think its too far, the Old Ford Factory (the place where the British surrendered to the Japanese) at Bukit Timah might be better for those on the western side of the island."
,,A small but powerful place.,4.0,,"Although quite small, the Changi Museum is very informative. It follows the Japanese invasion of Singapore and the subsequent internment of both military and civilian."
,,Must see!,5.0,,"Our guide through the Museum and Chapel was personally well informed about Changi. He had an aunt living in Singapore at the time of the Japanese invasion. He was respectful, informative, helpful and empathetic. Visiting the museum and Chapel was a deeply moving occasion. A must see!"
,,Must visit!,5.0,,"This should be a must-visit for everyone who comes to Singapore. Entry is free, audiotour is $8, and guided tour is $12 (45 minutes). They've done an amazing job collating the primary materials and stories from ex-POWs who were here, and it's truly an ever-evolving exercise, with so much work put in to ensure that stories are accurate and honour the memories shared. It also gives you a really interesting perspective on the effect of this part of WWII on Singapore and their subsequent history. My partner and I did the guided tour with Sha, and he was absolutely fantastic. Really made the history come alive with his passion and knowledge.

The museum is not far from the airport, so if you have a stopover it's definitely worth heading here. If you're staying in the city, it's pretty easy to get here if you go to Tanah Merah, then get Bus No 2 (at stop number 1, don't get confused like we did). It takes under an hour all up from the CBD."
,,A tasteful memorial.,4.0,,A very tasteful memorial to those incarcerated in Changi. It was only a shame I had such limited time to take it all in due to constraints imposed on a tour. If interested in the history one could easily spend a couple of hours here.
,,Moving and Informative,5.0,,"If you're shaky about your WW2 history or would like to know more, come to the Changi Museum. We went at the end of the working day and were the only ones there, which added to the intimate experience. We could not help but be deeply moved by the stories of the prisoners of war and the bravery of every-day people. Highly recommended"
,,Moving experience,5.0,,"Very good museum and well worth the journey to visit. Lots of informative displays to look at, would recommend."
,,Must visit if you're in the East,5.0,,"I've been here at least 3 times, and every time it sucks me in deeper. Its a small place but take the time to read as much as you can and be drawn into the stories and lives that passed."
,,Moving experience,5.0,,It's hard not to be moved by the pictorial representation of Japanese treatment of civilians and soldiers during the occupation of Singapore during WWII.
,,Do a tour,5.0,,"I booked with Viator the Changi Museum & East Coast half day tour. Really enjoyed it. It started at 2pm which meant we could plan things for the morning. It does cost about $50 but is well worth the money for the 3 hour tour. You get picked up from your hotel, driven around in an airconditioned coach, fantastic commentary & is is a great sampler of places to see on the east coast. We only had 9 people on our coach & it was brilliant. Changi as always is amazing and we had plenty of time to spend there. If you get Maggie as your guide you will not be disappointed. Stringly recommend this tour."
,,"Was interesting, but don't bother with the tour",3.0,,"Title is a bit harsh. The tour was ok. But it goes far too long and I would have preferred to save my $55 and simply read the info at the museum.
You do not get to tour the old prison as it has been torn down. They have a few interesting artifacts in the museum."
,,Poignant still,3.0,,Visited the original about 20 years ago and found this visit a little disappointing. The 'story' had been cleansed somewhat but the museum is a good space. Didn't visit on a tour but by ourselves and the trip was by metro then via taxi as its a little out of the way.
,,Worth a quick visit,4.0,,"Literally a 10 minute cab ride ( SGD$10) from Changi airport, this little attraction is worth a quick look. I spent no more than 45 minutes there and took my time reading all of the content and quotes.
It is a nice reminder of Singapore's exposure to World War 2 and those that died at the hands of the Japanese over those tumultuous years.
You can spend 10c and write a note or identify a loved one who was involved in this war and leave it on the board at the remembrance area.
There is a book shop/kiosk as well as a small restaurant.
There is no Taxi stand out the front and when I asked inside they said to just hail one down on the main road. I walked a good 10 minutes in the rain and heat before finding a cab, so it may be worthwhile organising a cab to pick you up an hour after you arrive to have that assurance."
,,Singapore's historic saga,5.0,,"Changi chapel museum is a must for go all those who are interested in singapore's history. Located close to the Changi prison, the museum offers a visual panorama of the life and experiences of Singapore's war years."
,,Absolutely must do.,5.0,,"My second visit and while this place is small and will only take a few hours of your time, it is a special place, especially popular with Aussies and Kiwis and Brits. Take your older children and 16 and up. Mine are 11 and 13 but really took it in and asked lots of questions. This is an emotional journey. It's off the beaten track. Get the MRT to Tanah Merah and cab it from there."
,,Worth seeing.,3.0,,"Worth a visit, especially to read about the local inhabitants horrible sufferings under Japanese occupation. But bear in mind that the chapel is just a recreation of the original, and nowhere near the original location."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Great little museum, the guide was fantastic and very knowledgeable. Its a bit out of the way but taxis aren't that expensive in Singapore and it was well worth a visit."
,,"A ""must see""",5.0,,"Very moving and informative. Beautifully presented in a way not to be maudlin, presented in a calm way, very interesting."
,,Moving Experience,5.0,,"I just moved to Singapore from New York City and took this tour to get a better sense of the country's history. Helena, my tour guide, was a captivating storyteller who packed a lot of information in the tour. She did a wonderful job. Highly recommended."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,We found the museum very interesting. Free entry and pay to hire audio guides which I would recommend. We enjoyed our visit though a little out of the way. Worth the trip.
,,food for thought.,5.0,,A very thought provoking time. Go for the audio tour as it gives you a lot of background Information. You will appreciate what the pow ' s went through
,,Visit to Changi war museum,5.0,,Heart wrenching stories of Japanese cruelty on the local populace during the WWII occupation of Singapore. Also some tales of epic courage and humanity. Horrors if war depicted among the pictures and stores. Not for the weak if heart
,,Excellent Museum and Memorial,5.0,,"A beautiful museum and tribute to those who suffered or paid the ultimate sacrifice during the Japanese occupation.
The exhibits are well presented with superb narrative and first-hand accounts. It is extremely thought provoking, and you leave with an admiration and respect for those who lived and suffered here. It is a 'must see' place when visiting Singapore, and a reminder of how we should never take freedom for granted.

Lest We Forget"
,,A bit disappointed,3.0,,"We have been to a number of war museums in Australia and Asia and this felt a bit sterile. The stories were well presented and the audio tour added to the information but I came out feeling like I hadn't seen anything new to add to the story of this horrific chapter of the war. Everything felt at arms length, the outline on the floor that indicated the amount of space each prisoner had was indicative but gave no sense of the cramped conditions.Reverence was there certainly but none of the grit and reality was allowed to escape from behind the glass.

The two exceptions were the recreated chapel and outside memorial. Something substantial I guess.

I am not explaining this well but for such an iconic site, it felt like I was being forced to feel something that was lacking in the actual museum."
,,Changi will challenge you and give you memories to keep for ever,5.0,,You can watch TV documentatries and read books but nothing comes close to visiting Changi and reading the letters which belonged to the prisoners and treading on the soil they did. This place is a short bus ride from Singapore; a short journey that will stay with you for many years. The atmosphere when I was there was quiet and reflective. Allow yourself time to sit and reflect in the chapel before heading back into the town.
,,a sobering moment,5.0,,"The Changi Chapel and Museum stands as a monument to the ability of humanity to rise like a phoenix from ashes. It also is a monument to the vast distance Singapore has travelled since the end of WWII. While not a ""fun"" visit like many other visits in Singapore, a visit to Changi Chapel uplifts the spirit."
,,Changi,5.0,,"Easy to reach on the metro. A not to be missed 2nd world war memorial. Lots of photos and information, you can spend hours reading all of this. It brings tears to the eyes."
,,Real Eye Opener for Me,5.0,,"I don't like museums at all. I just don't last long in them. This one captivated my interest. I'm from the US and there was stuff about WWII that I never realized before because I wasn't taught it in school. Actually, there was so much that I learned. I guess I was sort of upset that I didn't know more about the war and other countries who were involved in the fighting and the invasions. So for someone who had no interest in WWII at all before going here, I found this very interesting and thought provoking. It's probably not for everyone still but I would recommend it to most people and I would also say to do the audio tour because it just adds a lot to the experience even though you have to pay for it."
,,We visited this location as part of a tour,5.0,,"An eye opener for those who have heard about it but didn't know the full story behind it. A must see, and a little bit more time would have been great."
,,Very emotional,5.0,,Well worth the time to visit but make sure you do not rush as you need to read the posters and photo information. Well put together and was a very emotional visit for me
,,A Pilgrimage for All,5.0,,"A visit to the Changi Prison and Chapel Museum is a must-do for anyone who wants to learn the horror and terror of the Japanese occupation of Singapore in World War II from 1942 to 1945.

There are heart-rending letters, gruesome photos, sketches, drawings and artefacts which give an insight into the harrowing experience of the many thousands prisoners of war; detailing the endless pains, tortures, sicknesses, sufferings and humiliations faced by civilians and soldiers taken as POWs at the hands of the Japanese army during WWII.

The Changi Chapel built by the POWs, the ‘Changi Murals’ (a series of Biblical paintings) drawn by a British prisoner of war, Mr Stanley Warren and the Changi Quilt created and sewn by women interned by the Japanese in Changi Prison were the beacons that gave glimmers of faith, hope and encouragement that had kept morales up and ultimately ensured survival for the internees during their darkest period in 1942 - 1945.

Funnily, on the day of my visit, there were many people from Europe, America, Oceania and the locals but no Japanese in sight. Perhaps the Japanese tourists should make an effort to include Changi Prison and Chapel Museum as one of their must see places while visiting this beautiful island called Singapore."
,,Memorable and thought provoking,5.0,,Having had parents involved in WWII but not in Singapore this widened my knowledge of the Singapore and Changi experience and made me realize the futility of war and the strength of the human spirit.
,,Well worth a visit. Surprising for Singapore - it's free!,5.0,,"Surprisingly for Singapore, the museum is free! A fascinating experience, and you gain a greater understanding of the fall of Singapore, and the horrors of occupation during WWII. Highly recommend it. Either take a taxi, or join a bus tour to take in Kanji as well."
,,Changi Chapel and Museum,3.0,,"I was disappointed that Changi Prison no longer exists, the chapel and museum is worth a visit with some very interesting information available"
,,Interesting part of history,5.0,,It was very moving and interesting. I found my uncles name on the list of prisoners. There is also a nice cafe to eat at.
,,To hard to explain,5.0,,I had two uncles interned here during WW2. To visit and see only a portion of what they were subjected to is shameful. The stories of the civilian population is equally dreadful. This is a must see for everyone.
,,An interesting look at history,3.0,,It was interesting to hear the survivor accounts of the camp and the experiences of those caught up in the war. Everything was well presented and respectful. I was a little disappointed that so much of the display was a replica.
,,Thought provoking.,5.0,,"This beautiful chapel is definitely worth a visit as is the Museum which is attached to it. It is heart wrenching reading some of the letters and seeing the photographs, some of which are pretty graphic. Heart wrenching but definitely worth a visit."
,,Well worth it,5.0,,"We were a bit undecided whether this would be worth the effort on public transport but it definitely was. While small, this memorial is packed with information and tells the stories of life for the POWs, Europeans and locals in Singapore under the Japanese. As young Australians we learn so much about the wars and I think this is a must see for all Aussies, Brits and Singaporeans."
,,Interesting and sad too,5.0,,The chapel is lovely and thoroughly enjoyed the visit. Found the museum extremely interesting and spent most time there looking and reading all about everything. Good to visit
,,a ' must' spend some time visit to this historic and reverent place in Singapore and Asia past,2.0,,"this reverent place reflects history of what Singapore was and just what Singapore is to-day.
filled with memorabilia from prisoners of war and their daily struggle just to survive.
makes one reflect and the motto of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
we are not of different nationalities etc but we are all Singaporeans!
so lets build one nation and he has succeeded."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,My husband and I loved this museum. It tells of the tragedies that took place in the Japanese take over of Singapore. It is very well put together and informational!!! It took a good while to really read everything but it is worth it!
,,A bigger experience than expected,5.0,,"This is a small museum with a lot of information, it is well laid out and the staff were very helpful. The individual stories are very moving and I am glad to have been able to find the time to visit the museum and chapel. I learned a lot and was once again reminded of the sacrifices made by so many in the Second World War, and how things haven't changed in the respect that wars are still being fought and brutality is present in the world every day."
,,Fantastic - History,5.0,,Joanne was our host and really knew here Stuff - Very passionate and very informative - the Dark history of Singapore - DONT miss this tour its a must do!!!
,,Good Visit,4.0,,"Operating Hours
0930 - 1700 daily

FREE admission

You can get there by train AND bus or by bus but we decided that it wasn't worth the hassle of lugging our bags around since we came straight from the airport, and took a taxi instead.

The museum staff was very nice and polite. Our bags were left at the souvenir shop (opposite the entrance) which visitors will end up at after touring the museum. While entry is free, visitors can opt for audio tour at SG$8 per adult.

Some people might find the museum a bit text-heavy but I thought it was informative. Exhibition is mainly about the World War 2 (think Japanese Occupation). The items on display looked genuine and the letters brought tears to my eyes. One can't help feeling a bit sad (and depressed) while going through the exhibitions.

I love the drawings on the wall and the rainbow-coloured paper pelicans in particular. Expect to spend 1 to 2 hours here for casual visit. If you're planning to pay your respect at the chapel, perhaps even close to 3 hours.

Visitors can opt for the audio tour for a little fee."
,,Poignant and moving,4.0,,"This unassuming attraction is a must-see for visitors to Singapore to understand how the island struggled with the horrors of the Japanese occupation during the Second World War. The place is simply laid out and there is much factual information, though much of it very thought provoking."
,,Worth a visit. Lest we forget!,4.0,,An eye opening experience on the hardships endured by the brave people of Singapore throughout the time of the World War 2 Japanese occupation of Singapore. We took an audio tour for $8SD to guide and inform us of these sad years in Singapore's history although one could do without this option as the museum provided detailed written information on boards next to the exhibits. As an Australian it was also poignant to see the deep connection fostered between the people of Singapore and Australian prisoners of war.
,,A great history lesson,4.0,,"If your interested in the history of Singapore, WW2 and the horrors that took place during this period then this place requires a visit. However I would recommended visiting as part of a bus tour as we did, we received a guided tour of the museum and visited Changi prison and beach."
,,Cautious about going but felt I needed to because of the history,5.0,,"Even though this isn't the whole original prison, it certainly does a good job showing what it was like for the prisoners. It was very hard wrenching reading the letters and signs and I left there feeling really sad. It is incredible that one race in a war can be so cruel to other human beings, but that is war. Make sure you do go so it can be understood how important to prevent war."
,,A verey moving experience.,5.0,,Detailed museum showing the terrible conditions that where inflicted upon the residents of Singapore during the occupasion by the Japanese.
,,Haunting look at the past,4.0,,"I was not sure what to expect when I went into this museum, but while reading all of the displays I found myself mourning the past. This is a very well laid out museum and by the end of the self guided tour I was smiling.

This is a good site for anyone who, like me, is a fan of history."
,,Moving and humbling experience.,4.0,,"We had recently watched the film The Railway Man, with Colin Firth, about a British serviceman who was captured by the Japanese in WW2 and interred in Changi Prison in Singapore, and had been very moved by it. When we decided to visit Singapore, a visit to the prison itself seemed an obvious thing to do.

We used public transport to get there, MRT then bus, which probably took around 45 minutes and was easy and cheap but you could make the whole trip by taxi from the city or, alternatively, get a taxi from the MRT station where you would normally get on the bus, as there were plenty waiting.

The Chapel and Museum are free to enter, you only pay a small fee if you want audio, but the written displays are plentiful, full of information and easy to follow with lots of pictures and illustrations so it's only a matter of choice if you take audio, not a necessity.

It would be hard not to be moved by the things you read and the photos you see, it reminded me very much of our visit to Auschwitz, and the suffering that these poor people had to endure and the courage and fortitude that they showed, will take your breath away and leave you feeling very humbled. The murals painted on the Chapel Wall, and the fact that the British serviceman who painted them felt eventually able to return to Singapore and Changi to recreate them, despite the horrific memories it brought back, made me cry.

The Museum is not huge, your visit might only take around an hour but there's also a small shop to browse and a restaurant serving anything from cold drinks and coffee to snacks and full meals.

Man's inhumanity to man, yet also the courage which can shine through the human spirit when most needed, will seldom have been more starkly illustrated than by a visit to Changi"
,,A moment in History,5.0,,This was the second time I had visited this museum I was not disappointed the first time and still found more to look at during the second visit with my wife. We were both very moved with the experience.
,,Changi - Lest we Forget,5.0,,"As an ex military man and a returned from active service veteran, I am interested in all things military. Changi shows the history and the struggles of those held captive within the walls of this horror detention camp. Their deprivation was only made that worse by their captives, but those interred within held on to hope and rescue. The walls echo the horrors these men endured, the secret drawings and other writings make this a brilliant museum worth the time to visit and remember what sufferings they endured for our freedom. Lest we Forget.

,,Wonderful Display About Singapore During WW11,5.0,,Wonderful museum and recreated chapel are well worth a visit. Audio is S$8 and gives an excellent coverage of Singapore during WW11.
,,Moving,4.0,,"If you are considering this, then do it.
My family took a taxi arriving at 0930 at this inconspicuous building at the back of the current Changi prison. An unobtrusive entrance which belies a really important part of Singaporian, Australian, Malaysian, Indian and Chinese history. There was not a guide available at 0945 on the day, but the audio tour is well worth the minimal cost and it can be shared between two.

There are some graphic realities of the atrocities of war but these are delicately balanced with some lighter moments of life in Changi. The audio tour takes about an hour and most of it is in air conditioned buildings with seating available.
This is a moving tribute of a hugely significant part of the history of Asia where this small, but well curated museum marks the period. I hope one day it will be visited as often as it should be... in respect to all those who suffered in Singapore."
,,Worth a visit.,5.0,,Interesting Chapel and Museum. Part of history. One day I hope to maybe take my dad here. It was informative too. I have put we visited here back in August 2014 but it was actually back in 2007 (tripadvisor need to have a calendar attached).
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,I took a half day tour as I didn't want to go by public transport in the heat. The Museum was well presented and informative. The exhibition was clearly labelled and interesting.
,,great experience,5.0,,"wonderful insight to Singapore history, remarkable country with amazing people who showed us a amazing tour."
,,Small but moving.,4.0,,"We took an 11am tour and were the only ones on it. This took about 1&1/2 hrs. Our guide Jo was very easy to listen to and had lots of interesting stories and personal details. Being from Australia she took time to highlight the Australian stories, artefacts and memorabilia which was thoughtful. While this museum is not big it has a lot of information and has done a wonderful job to re-create some of the lost and inaccessible chapels, wall murals etc... While we do not have anyone from our family who was at Changi or in Asia during the war they were very helpful if you wanted to look up a family member. I took my 14yo son and he found it very interesting and we both felt proud to visit there and take time to remember and appreciate the people who suffered at Changi."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"The story of the war in the Asia/Pacific is not well known enough. The atrocities perpetrated by the invading Japanese forces against the local population and the POW need to be acknowledged and remembered. It is sad but also uplifting, stories of bravery mingled with stories of great incompetency by those in charge of the Allied defence of Singapore."
,,Small but worthwhile,4.0,,"The museum is small, but full of stories from people who survived the atrocities of the Japanese soldiers in WWII. Some of the stories are quite horrific and make you appreciate even more the sacrifice our soldiers made for us. It is easy to get to via the MRT and bus service."
,,Heartbreaking,4.0,,A must for Australians visiting Singapore. Could spend hours reading and looking at old photos of the atrocities committed by the Japanese during World War II.
,,A must see when you come to Singapore....,5.0,,"I am so glad I went on the tour of the WW2 Changi War Museum and Chapel... it was a humbling experience but at the same time quite emotional.... I would encourage anyone who comes to Singapore for a holiday to put this attraction on their agenda because I am sure they will lov it... it has changed me and the way I now look at things... the tour guide, Nancy, is a really lovely lady and she is very knowledge with regard to the events of the Singapore invasion in WW2."
,,Time for reflection,5.0,,"If you can find your way there, it is a part of history that many wished hasn't happened. Yet, it is a reminder of freedom lost and the torture by the japanese"
,,Second visit since 1989,5.0,,"June 15. What a wonderful & moving experience! Much more to see now. Got such a feeling of closeness to my brother Jim Moore who survived this terrible ordeal, yet spoke nothing of it. Am donating a copy of his diary Feb.'41 - Dec.'45., which was discovered after his death in '89. Suggest the guided tour in preference, ( from the front desk.)"
,,An excellent educational visit,5.0,,"An excellent educational visit. The exhibition provides detailed explanation with photo's, detailed documentation transcripts, a long with various items of what life was like in Singapore during the Japanese occupation. The audible story (units you can hire) are a must in order for you to lesson stories and gather more information on the exhibits and displays as you follow the sequence of events of the occupation. The heart rendering pain and suffering the prisoners went through under the Japanese and how they survived is an amazing account shown in the museum. There is an out door restaurant with a good menu of local food, the service is good and the food is of reasonable quality. Visiting this venue is free and well worth a visit."
,,Quiet & quaint,4.0,,This museum was great - it's pretty small but interesting. A place for reflection. Love to read the many notes left by visitors from around the world.
,,A very moving experience,4.0,,A visit to Changi Chapel and Museum cannot be classed as an enjoyable experience. It is very emotive and moving to gain a better insight into the sufferings of prisoners interned there. I am glad I went as a tribute to all who suffered there. The exhibits were well presented and enlightening. A hard subject well done!
,,Great insight into events of WWII,5.0,,We used a combination of train and bus to reach Changi cghapel. Joined a guided tour of the chapel where the guide was able to give a well informed tour of the chapel and discuss the events of the past and describe the significance of the museums exhibits..
,,Changi on the bucket list,4.0,,With 86 yo dad holding a new passport he had Changi on bucket list to pay respect to Aussie soldiers that didn't have a chance when Singapore surrendered. Passionate and brilliant orator made this tour very memorable and a time we should always remember with great sadness for the lost lives.
,,Singapore History,5.0,,"The original Changi Chapel and Museum was much better than the current one as it was on the site of the current prison. However, the displays in the museum are laid out much better than before. This is something not to be missed when visiting Singapore."
,,A must visit,5.0,,"I visited here twice and was moved both times. The first time I toured without a guide and just read the stories as I went around, the second time was an arranged tour. Both were fantastic. I was glad though that I had already been once as there was not as much time on the guided tour to read all the stories and take in all the photographs. Such a moving place to go and visit."
,,An eye opener,5.0,,Showed what our troops went through in Japanes hands. A must see for all Australian and British tourists. Especially teh young who seem to learn little about WWII
,,Changi memorial,3.0,,"I was surprised that this was as small as it was. It was a great exhibition, and I learned a lot about the war history of Singapore. Worth a visit, particularly for Australians."
,,History that needs to be told,4.0,,"In shiny, fancy Singapore it is easy to forget the turbulent past to which this memorial is dedicated. I visited for about 90 minutes before going to the airport for my flight and so glad I did. I self-guided myself through the exhibit/museum which was fine but if you don't like to read all the explanations of the displays then definitely pay for the audio tour. The museum tells the story of the end of the colonial age in Singapore and the fate of Europeans, Australians and Singaporese as the Japanese took over during WW II. Having also visited the sites at the bridge on the River Kwai in Thailand it was good to see this part of the story. A well done museum"
,,A fiitting memorial to those who suffered such oppression,5.0,,Visited here as part of a coach trip but went round the chapel and museum without a guide. The chapel is small but exceedingly touching especially the cross made by a British soldier as a POW. The museum is an excellent history lesson showing the brutality and horror the people of Singapore and the POWs and the hands of the Japanese occupiers. I knew quite a bit about the history but even I was shocked at the way there were treated but also shows their amazing strength to survive and be able to relate their stories. The saddest reflection of the visit is that this type of horror and brutality still goes on in the world today.
,,ex service members you need to go,5.0,,"words fail to explain the feelings,go see for you will be moved,Take the time and reflect and make sure it never happens again any where. ,"
,,What a great way to learn the history of Singapore.,4.0,,"This was a completely unknown part of history for me and the guide Shalam? was so passionate about the stories and the history of the war and Singapore. We had 2 kids with us (8 and 12) and he kept their attention for the whole 1.5 hour tour.
You need 2 hours to give this place justice and if you can do the tour, at $12 per adult it is great value. The museum is free if you just want to walk around.
I will definitely take all of my visitors here, it is a must visit."
,,A very interesting and touching slice of Singapore's history,5.0,,"The museum highlights the difficult times faced by Singaporeans and the Prisoners Of War, imprisoned at the Changi prison by the Japanese during World War II. It is a small museum which shows life in the prison during that time. Everyday objects of use, and personal belongings of the inmates are on display along with audio-visual commentary of the period. Also on display are murals paintings done by the prison inmates, most of which are realistic and touching. Very interesting and moving,

To get there, you can take the MRT to Tanah Merah station (East-West line/Green line) and then catch bus number 2 (which heads to Changi village), alight at bus stop B 09.

It would be a good idea to combine the visit along with an outing to Pulau Ubin island, which is a fifteen minute boat ride from the Changi village ferry terminal."
,,Changi Musuem,3.0,,"Not what we expected, not enough time spent there to actually read all the information that was there. Would have like a photo opportunity of the remains of the original wall."
,,It's a MUST Visit Museum,4.0,,"This museum is located quiet far from town in fact its more close to the airport so I suggest you to come here first after arriving at Singapore by Taxi or latest before you're going back to Changi.

The museum itselfs contains a lot of old photograph and some memorable things left from the WWII. It is quiet depressing to see how they're trying to survive under Japanese invasion but yet inspiring to see how they are able to survive in such a worst condition.

You also can see the replica of mural painting of St. Luke Chapel made by Stanley Warren. You can also see the process of mural restoration after the WWII.

In the middle court there is a open air chapel, St. Paul. as a remembrance of the victims of the WWII, there are plenty of wishing paper made by the local students displayed on the altar.

It is definitely a must see museum in order to see the Singapore's dark era before they turn to be a most developed country in South East Asia."
,,Remembering history,4.0,,"The Changi chapel is it historic building used to tell the story of the hardships in Singapore's history and that of her allies in the defence of Singapore during world war 2.
It is not a glamorous building nor is it intended to be but a representation with original artefacts including paintings and stories to share the atrocities It is not a glamorous building nor is it intended to be but a representation with original artefacts including paintings and stories to share the atrocities that occurred at the Japanese occupation during the Second World War.
The staff are fantastic, very knowledgeable and passionate and I would recommend allowing a couple of hours to share the experience ."
,,Every moving!!,5.0,,"The rain was the only disappointing part, everything was what we wanted for our short stay. Will return again as we still have things to do."
,,"Here you see how badly the Japanese treated there captured military prisnors, as well as families.",4.0,,"Thank you Singapore for protecting the old KZ and its documents etc. It is well worth a visit as has lots of photos, documents etc from both sides. It is well maintained and very interesting. It is easy to get to and the local people are extremely helpful and will show you how to get there,"
,,Very amazing & real journey,5.0,,"A must see, it's part of our history. Take a taxi there, it takes about an hour to go around. You get to listen through a microphone the whole way round"
,,A moving experience,5.0,,To see first hand the story of the POWs made me sad. But I am glad I went we all need to learn about the history of Singapore and what has made it into the great city it is today
,,Haunting,3.0,,"Stopped over the museum upon the recommendation of a friend. It is a very good look into what has happened during the Japanese occupation during WW2,

The chapel houses several anecdotes, stories and relics from the war.

Entrance is free, but photos are not allowed inside the chapel."
,,"It has changed since last visit,",5.0,,"We visited Changi Museum chapel many years ago when it was just an older wooden building. We hired information headphones to help you around the many new painting/photos. The chapel is still the same, but we think the museum it has lost some of the original character of yesteryear, but suspect it's got to keep up with modern times,. It's quite easy to get there by train and bus."
,,Australians should visit,4.0,,"All Australians young and old who visit Singapore should visit Changi chapel and museum it is not an easy tour but very worth while. We booked a tour with ""the original Singapore Walks"" our guide Whi Whi was great. The museum is trying new headsets systems to go with the tour they are just getting it going so there are a few hick ups that I am sure will be sorted out. the one thing I found lacking was that there was very limited choice in the gift shop ( other than some very good books) not that you would
expect fridge magnets and snow globes but they need to look at other places to see what they do."
,,Take a tissue,5.0,,"I met a friends father (a doctor) after he was repatriated to NZ from Changi after the war The memory of him was seared into my memory, the poor man was about 50kg, all skin and bones. I found the whole experience overwhelming. Very sad."
,,Changi War Museum,5.0,,Extremely informative and very touching .I felt humbled and emotional to read the stories of suffering by so many.
,,Special experience but could be boring for some,3.0,,"Free place for locals and tourist

Nice quaint altar with poppies and messages

Nice museum

Great place to visit on a weekday afternoon

Quite out of the place though, so its either driving or cabbing recommended

came here with my 'god mum' from Japan

friendly service

unfortunately not my cup of tea. for those who are into more indepth cultural would be nice for them

im more an excitement, shopping, eating and graphically morbid kind of guy like Killing fields in Cambodia."
,,Changi.,5.0,,"A sacrifice that should never be forgotten.The day we were there , there was a group from HMAS Perth, Good one lads. Pity about all the high fences covered in razor wire and cloth, would of liked to see more."
,,Well done reminder of the fall of Singapore,4.0,,"A well documented history of the changi prison from world war two, if you are history buff well worth the visit seeing artifacts, photos and memorabilia of prisoners at this prison site"
,,We MUST remember their sacrifice,5.0,,"As Australians, Changi holds a particular place in our hearts. So many of our countrymen lost their lives there and on the Thai-Burma railway after Japanese conquered Singapore. Our tour group met at the Pasir Ris MRT station and was all Australian. Our local guide, Wei Wei was lovely and very knowledgeable. We know that the Chapel is a replica as we have seen the original at Duntroon in Canberra, but it was faithfully reproduced. None of the prison is visible to the public as it is now incorporated into the present-day Changi Correction Facility. However, the Museum is very well done, with a few artefacts and a well laid out and informative display. Our tour also included Changi beach - beautiful and serene today. Thankfully there is no sign of the horrors of just over 70 years ago...."
,,A lot of reading but it is a story that needs telling.,4.0,,"This museum is not large but it gives a balanced insight into Singapore during WWII. I already knew a fair bit about the European prisoner of war camps and conditioned but I was pleased to learn about how the Chinese, Indian and Malay populations fared at this time. It was great to see the British women's quilt as I have seen the Australian one in Canberra and quilts are a special passion of mine. I was glad that I had the time to read the information - we has caught the train and then the bus so time was out own. There are a lot of books in the bookshop plus an extensive reference section for anyone who wants to research. Well worth a visit but perhaps not for children - too much reading and Adult themes."
,,Worth a Visit,5.0,,"We took a number 2 bus out to the Museum rather than a train as we thought we could have a look at things as we were going along. It was just on an hour trip each way. The museum itself isn't the most sophisticated I have ever been to, but reading the personal accounts of those who had lived through the experience of the Japanese occupation was very moving"
,,A sad but inspiring place,5.0,,"This was a difficult place to visit - the chapel especially was really atmospheric. when you understand some of what prisoners suffered here though, and visit the museum, their stories of survival are also inspiring"
,,Alternative side of SG,4.0,,"If you're into WW2 history and have sometime to spare,, this is highly recommended. Excellent exhibition showcasing SG under Japanese occupation. There's a small open space chapel inside the museum. But it's far away from the main city center. Might be a hassle to some."
,,Experience not to miss,5.0,,"My wife and I had a great half day here, we hired a guide at the museum who was extremely knowledgeable and encouraged us to explore at our own pace after the time with her. Wonderful experience not to be missed"
,,One of singapores best museums,5.0,,Visited this museum for the second time after an 8 year gap - well worth the revisit. It tells a very moving story of the inhumanity of war and gave us an excellent introduction to life in Singapore in the Second World War. Highly recommended.
,,A sober reminder of the war.,3.0,,The chapel is not an original from the Changi Prison but a replica. There is a small museum looking at the Japanese occupation from the last war. Not a pretty story really as so many people lost their lives in horrible circumstances.
,,Great summary of Singapore's involvement in WWII,4.0,,"It was my second visit, the first being in 2008. Nothing had changed, but I guess the history is still the same! Would have been nice to see a change of display though. Probably wouldn't go back a third time. The cafe/restuarant next door is very good, great food and cold beer. Buses aren't very regular and taxis are hard to catch back to the city, so best to plan your return journey if possible."
,,So moving - amazing place to visit,5.0,,"I went not 100% sure what to expect.
I left after an eye opening experience. It was so moving to see & hear what people when through during WW2 - both as a local or as an Allied force defending Singapore.
Make the time to go there.... and take tissues for the tears."
,,"Nothing to put on the Schedule, but when there its ok",3.0,,Its nothing really special. It has some average food stalls and is far away from the City Center. If you Travel to singapore skip it. If you love in Singapore do it once
,,Round Islands Tour,5.0,,"The information contained in the museum showed the horrors, in detail, that happened in Singapore during the war, The history, the tales, photos and sadness can all be experienced in this one place."
,,The trip to Chani Chapel and Museum,5.0,,"It is a very nice half day out and along the way one can see half of Singapore. The museum is clean, modern and interesting. It could be combined with a visit to a small Singaporean island nearby or on the way to Malaysia by ferry boat."
,,Museum,5.0,,"We had a day trip to Changi where POW were kept, the museum tells you what was happening during the war very graphic also the war graves are something to see very well looked after and very clean"
,,Lest We Forget.,5.0,,"Perhaps one for those historically interested but should be a visit for all. For if we do not learn from such history we may well repeat it,"
,,meaningful stories,5.0,,"We visited Changi Chapel and Museum in March 2015. The guide Sharul made the visit moving. He spoke with passion about the local prisoners and victims of the second world war, many of whom continued to care for their fellow human beings in the face of torture and death. A small war museum, but a big reminder of why it matters."
,,Underwhelmed,3.0,,Mr Grandfather was a WWII POW in Changi. I was expecting to be able to see at least of the prison so I could soak in the atmosphere and try my best to relive the emotions of the prisoners. Not able to as it is still a working prison. I found the Museum needs a lot more work to make it more interesting. The Chapel is also only a replica as the real one is in Canberra Australia at the War Memorial.
,,Worth it,5.0,,If you wanted any additional information about WWII in south east Asia then a visit here is a must. The tour guides know there information very well and is engaging.
,,Changi world war II,5.0,,It was very interesting and a very emotional experience well worth doing. I also learnt a great deal about the invasion of Singapore by the Japanese and Australia's involvement.
,,A Unique and Important Experience,5.0,,"Although this was difficult to see, I think it's important that everyone see this. It shows what happened to the British troops and local civilians when Japan conquered Singapore. In the midst of a prosperous peace, we must never forget the horrors of war."
,,Cultural,5.0,,"This museum was very humbling and emotional.....it gave the history of the Japanese occupation through to end of WW2... The personal stories are just so moving but you get an idea of how this nation suffered, including POW and ex pats....well worth the visit"
,,Changi Chapel and Museum,5.0,,"Very good place to go, see and read. Very sad to see what our Diggers had to go through. Lovely and friendly staff."
,,Very interesting and worth a visit,5.0,,Free to get in but I'd recommend paying the $8 to get the audio tour. Very informative and thought provoking. Great little restaurant attached with lovely food.
,,solem and alarming.,4.0,,"I took my 11 & 14 yo's to get a glimpse of some of the terrible things that war & conflict can result in. Even I got more than I expected, but it has presented in a respectful manner."
,,Very Moving,5.0,,We were advised that taking the organised tour which includes the chapel and museum was not a good idea because the time spent here is too short. So we made our own way there by MRT and bus which was straightforward enough. In the end we spent around 3 hours following the harrowing stories of the POW's. The museum is not large but it is brilliantly laid out and organised so that the entire story is easy to follow in a logical sequence. This is a must visit site !
,,Mildly disappointing,4.0,,having visited this on the back of a trip to Kranji I felt that this was an Ok experience but nothing exceptional. if you are on a tight time scale leave this one off your must do list
,,A sad insight into our joint Australian-Singaporean history,5.0,,"Displays were very well done with a mix of photographs, artefacts and stories/explanations. The $8 charge for the recorded commentary via headset was well worth it (entry is free), especially the short pieces recording people in their own words and voices."
,,Worthwile visit to understand more about the Asian World War II,4.0,,"From Changi Airport by taxi, however can be reached by bus from various locations of the city.

A visit of one to two hours are sufficient - lots to read inside and digest afterwards. World War II in Asia is not wellknown in Europe and there were a couple of ""light bulb moments"" when reading what had happened when and where in Asia.

I was very impressed about the story of Sgt Harry Stogden and the cross he made out of a 4.5 Howitzer shell - overall many sad stories."
,,ok,3.0,,"I caught a bus there , a bit of a journey , the display is informative but not very big , entrance is free , great pics from jap occupation ."
,,Forget it,1.0,,"First, its out of the way. Second, 5 minutes will do (to me, its like a place to have a break). Third, there ain't nothing to see (well, for some, even grasses can be an attraction so to each his own). My opinion, just Google, read it, save those pix and claim you have been there..."
,,emotional,4.0,,"World War II was a catastrophic event that affected lives of millions of people around the world. In Singapore, this tragedy was particularly painful for Prisoners-of-War (POWs) and civilians who were interned at the infamous Changi Prison during the Japanese Occupation. The Changi Museum is a abstemious reminder of this dark period, and sheds a light on the emotional events that unfolded here between 1942 and 1945. Here, you are able to view photographs, drawings and letters by prisoners and take a 45-minute guided tour around the site. The site aims to educate younger generations about both the horror and heroics that emerged during the war in Singapore. There are a comprehensive collection of books on Changi and the POW experience in the Far East at the museum shop. The Changi Museum also hopes to be a space where POWs and civilian prisoners and their families can find closure from the war. It has collected nearly 5,000 records of registered Civilian Internees who were interned in Singapore during the Japanese Occupation. It is moving to read the stories of the WWII prisoners and their courage under such horrendous conditions and of the locals who tried to help the prisoners. Unquestionably a must for anyone with an interest in the World War II account."
,,Worthwhile,4.0,,"This museum is a thoughtful and, I thought, worthwhile experience for visitors interested in the events that transpired there during the second world war. Because Changi prison is in fact still a prison, and rather a large one at that, the actual location of the exhibits are a little removed from the original but the photos, recollections and relics from that time give a good and somewhat chilling account of life in the prison for the allied pow""s under the control of the Japanese."
,,A pause for thought,5.0,,"This was a very moving experience, and thought provoking that People could endure so much. It says a lot about us as a species, good and bad. It also moved all of my travelling companions to tears."
,,Quietly understated suffering,4.0,,"This peaceful museum memorialises the internment of Australian and British troops and their families, along with the brutalisation of the Chinese who helped them, after the fall of Singapore to the Japanese. Many of the POWs were sent to work on the Burma-Thailand Railway. The museum is not in the actual Changi Prison but there’s a poignant replica of one of the chapels. Admission is free but it’s advisable to hire an audio guide for Sing$8. My interest stemmed from reading POW Russell Braddon’s The Naked Island, and the work of fellow internee, Leslie Greener; unbelievably, neither came out of the experience consumed by bitterness or hatred. Singapore National Museum currently has an exhibition on the history of Singapore and a visit there, followed by Changi Museum en route to the airport, is an efficient and instructive touristic strategy. The volunteers at Changi Museum are wonderful: and they will store your bags and provide a wheelchair if necessary."
,,Amazing look at history,5.0,,Touching to read the stories of the WWII prisoners and their courage under such horrific conditions and of the locals who tried to help the prisoners. Recommend going to Changi Museum.
,,Very good,5.0,,It made me very sad to see this museum. I never realised that the local people from Singapore had so much heartache during the war till I saw this place.
,,Highly emotional,5.0,,"I knew I would come here at some stage during my life, now as a sixty five year old.

It's difficult to describe Changi. None of my relatives had to endure this situation.

If you can cope with pain and suffering, this is the place.

The only place I can compare with this is when I toured the battlefields of the First World War in France a few years ago.

Changi is a place of tears, but also of hope and forgiveness."
,,A must for all Australians,5.0,,It is a must for Australians to understand the hardship endured by our heroes throughout the occupation of Singapore. A real honour to visit and go on the tour (45 minutes).
,,A place to spend a few hours of reflection.,4.0,,The museum and chapel are well worth a few hours visit. Reading up on the atrocities our troops endured in the hands of the Japanese. As well as the mistakes made by the commanders of our troops. Came from the city by Metro and changed onto a Bus for the last mile or two. Locals all very helpful.
,,Moving,5.0,,"Well worth the visit.not the easiest place to get to,but well worth it.very interesting,very emotional,a terrible time in history,we shouldn't forget."
,,Informative and emotional experience.,5.0,,"we were staying at Changi Village so it was very easy for us to get to the museum via the bus from outside our hotel. The exhibits are detailed and present a wide ranging perspective on the devastating impact of the Japanese invasion and occupation of Singapore for the locals as well as the service men and women imprisoned during WWII. There are detailed notes as well as evocative artefacts that capture not only the horror of the camp but also the ingenuity and resilience of the internees. I was particularly moved by the photographs and letters of the broken young men who survived and later came back as older, fatter and forgiving men.
Definitely a must for anyone with an interest in history."
,,moving experience,5.0,,"This is such an interesting museum but a very emotional place . It is very sad what happened there , Although I found it unusual that a Japanese school is next door"
,,A must visit,5.0,,I have previously been to other war memorial sights including Auschwitz and Dachau. I did not have alot of knowledge about the POWs in Changi or the Japanese occupation - this is a great place to learn about these moments in history. It is a shame that the museum is very small and most of the original locations eg: Changi Prison have all been demolished. I really hope more investment goes into preserving this memory and making sure that the Singapore Tourism Board value this site as a historical landmark.
,,Very clean and well done. Informative,5.0,,Changi museum well presented. Learnt a lot. Lest we forget. Must see if you are interested in the history of Singapore and what our great servicemen and women did. Not to be missed if you are a history buff.
,,Very well presented,5.0,,"Very interesting with harrowing stories for anyone,especially for me with a personal interest. Well worth a visit for anyone visiting Singapore."
,,Very moving,5.0,,"If you want to take a few minutes out to think about the contribution of others to our freedom of today, then get on the bus and visit the chapel and museum. You won't regret it."
,,An emotional visit,4.0,,The exhibits put one into the thoughts of those suffering in the prison . It provided a timely history lesson which we will not forget.
,,Very informative,4.0,,"Worth the trip, very moving, such a terrible time in history but presented in a sensitive way Would recommend it to all ages"
,,Too little time,4.0,,"I enjoyed the short time we had here, I could have done with another half hour so I could have read everything. For anyone with a feeling for the history of Singapore during the Occupation this is not to be missed. It was moving in its own way."
,,Jail visit with grandchildren,4.0,,"My grand daughters live in Singapore so I decided to take my grand children to visit the prison museum. We had such a lovely time well woth a visit. It was very informative with pictures and the history of ww2

We visited the cafe afterwards which was just ok nothing special.

We took the bus rather than a taxi which was a very exciting way for us all to travel."
,,Well worth the visit,4.0,,Museum is small but so very interesting. It is a poignant reminder of the atrocities of war. It isn't easy to get to but we took the MRT to the closest station then took as taxi which was very reasonable.
,,Changi Museum,4.0,,"I recently visited this museum & Chapel with my father who was a POW during the Japanese invasion . I found the Museum and Chapel to be a very quiet and interesting place to visit. The staff are very friendly and are very passionate about the place, and will take time to discuss the history with visitors. There is an audio tour for the museum available which is recommended. There is also a shop in the Museum which sells Singapore history books amongst other things related to the museum.
The museum itself is not as well known as it should be and even the taxi drivers are not sure of its location. If you get a taxi driver that is unsure then just explain that it is next to the Changi Jail which is the prison in Singapore.
Located next to the museum is a restaurant which I thought served great food and was very busy . The restaurant is in a very nice area .
I would recommend visiting the museum if you are into the history of Singapore. There is a bus route to the museum but if you were to get a taxi its pretty reasonable .
Don't forget to sign the visitors book in the museum shop.
There are tours available which have a fee . More details can be obtained from the museum website."
,,ANZAC DAY Z015,5.0,,"Away from home, Kranji Dawn Service for Anzac Day was to difficult re Taxi service etc. So decided to visit the Chiangi POW Chapel and Museum.. Terrible suffering at this place. Lest We Forget"
,,Should be on everyon's itinerary,5.0,,"Since we first visited over 20 years ago the site has been considerably sanitised and extensively added to. However it still portrays the horrible conditions experienced, not only by the prisoners of war but also the rest of the civilian population."
,,A Moving Experience,5.0,,My knowledge of the war time events in Singapore prior to this visit was pretty scant. The Museum remembers the brutalities suffered by POW s . The chapel with the cross made out of shell casings ( a very moving story about this cross will move even the stoniest of hearts ) was the highlight for me . Highly recommended.
,,Disappointing.,3.0,,"We took a tour of this infamous place as we had hoped to see a general indication of where my Uncle had been incarcerated as a POW.
Alas, this was not to be as there is nothing of the original jail to see.
What we did see was a very third rate 'museum' and a reproduction of the original Chapel.
The amenities were terrible and did not help the negative feelings of this visit.
I would have thought that as many local people also suffered terribly here that a more fitting memorial to all that were here would have been erected.
At least I was able to get a record of my Uncle's incarceration here which was also what I was hoping to find.
Unless you have family reasons to visit this place do not waste your time."
,,Excellent museum,5.0,,"My wife and I visited with our infant son. This meant that my wife spent most of the time consoling him as it's not the ideal place to visit with young children. However we are both significantly interested in military history and had long been looking forward to a chance to visit. It was well worth the effort. The museum is well laid out and can be covered in about 90 minutes with the audio guide ($8 following free entry) and some time to read the displays. We caught the MRT and then a taxi instead of the bus as we had a stroller. The trip was cheap and easy from central Singapore.

I'm currently reading ""The Long Road to Changi"" and this visit brought the book to life for me. However, prior knowledge is not necessary as the museum is quite comprehensive. A particular highlight was the chapel murals in the rear of the museum. I highly recommend this for anyone."
,,Worth the visit a real eye opener.,5.0,,"I enjoyed the visit and experience ( if enjoys can and should be used here ). The visit reminds one quite strongly that it just wasn't Allied servicemen that were interened and ill treated here. We oflen forget the European Civilians and locals alike who also survived this horror. I thank the Museam trust and Singapore for not letting us forget. I visited just 2 days before ANZAC day and could not help but see the oddnedd in the cafe being stocked up with KIRIN beer as well as others must b e some sense of Irony here of this.
Only fee was for the audio tour which I believe is a worthwhile option."
,,Well worth a visit to remind yourself of the history of Singapore,4.0,,It tackled a difficult subject in a good way. Some of the exhibits would benefit from clearer explanatory signs. Exceptionally helpful staff when it came to looking through their archives for a family member who was interred at Changi during the war.
,,A very sad place,3.0,,This is somewhere to visit that makes you realize how terrible these poor men had to go through but a very interesting experience and worth a visit.
,,A must do in Singapore - truly moving,5.0,,"I booked this tour for my partner and myself, and looked eagerly toward enjoying the tour. As a member of my family survived not only Changi prison, but also the infamous Burma Railway. My partner was along to support me, and we both thoroughly enjoyed the tour. Learning about the experiences of not only the 'British' soldiers, but also the other nationalities, and even the civilian population during the tour, was an eye opener.
Highly informative, and respectful to all nationalities concerned. So much so, that it is a must do for any Japanese students travelling through Singapore. My partner and I both shed tears at the memorial, and the concern from the guide was touching. I later explained the connection and the reason for the tears,
It was very moving for me, and I'm glad that I made the trip. To hear what my Grand Uncle went through gave me a greater appreciation for what I don't have to go through. Lest we Forget."
,,A moving experience,4.0,,"With Anzac Day approaching I thought it was important that we went here on our recent visit to Singapore.

A very well laid out museum with a large variety of exhibits as well as literature.

We particularly enjoyed the audio tour, which you can do at your own pace. Entrance to the museum is free, the audio tour from memory is $8 for adults and $4 for children.

I could have spent another couple of hours there easily.

Although not located centrally, the Singapore transport system is excellent and once out of the mtr, you just need to catch one bus.

A very worthwhile experience to see what they went through and the strength of the human spirit during the adversities."
,,For world war history fans.,4.0,,"One of my favourite museums in Singapore. You could join a tour or spend an afternoon reading there. Very good collection of stories and artefacts depicting how people lived then.

It's a little out of the way but worth a visit. There's a cafe just outside to take a break."
,,A moving experience,5.0,,Small but very moving. Get the audio tour and learn a lot about how men and women were treated by the Japanese Imperial Army in WWII. Very well done.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"It is a long way out of the city (we caught the MRT and bus) but worth a visit. Well laid out with a lot of information about the journey of the POW's.
It's not in the original spot where the actual prison was, but they have managed to keep the history alive. Very moving.
It is out on it's own though, it does have a cafe attached to it but is a bit expensive."
,,very well curated,4.0,,"not the most accessible by public transport, but worth the journey to understand the singapore war journey. self-tours with audio guides available. the chapel area allows guests to leave messages and light candles. but that part is not sheltered."
,,thought provoking,4.0,,"Spent the morning walking round the museum, good audio guide and exhibits. very evocative. easy to get to by public transport. good café next to museum. would recommend visiting."
,,Very Moving,5.0,,"I think if you are interested in World War 2 history, the Changi Museum and Chapal are well worth a visit. I had tears in my eyes as I read personal stories of the POWs. It was very moving. We had to take a train and a bus to get here but it wasn't overly difficult to do, it is out pass the airport. Next to it is an outdoor restaurant that was a bit pricey."
,,Sad,4.0,,We have been visiting WWII sites the last year or so. Those of us in the Western hemisphere really don't learn much about WWII in Asia. This museum provides a peak at the horror of the war in that part of the world. Man's inhumanity to man has no bounds nor geographical boundaries.
,,A tour not to be missed when in Singapore,5.0,,"A must for those people interested in the appalling treatment meted out by the Japanese army and the resilience of the defeated personnel and local people during the occupation. Our guide was brilliant, very friendly and answered most questions fully. The chapel and museum is excellent. If you are interested in this period of time in Singapore's history, then this excursion should not be missed."
,,do not mis it,5.0,,as i have been born before World War 2 it was a very moving visit. you should take at least 2 to 3 hours to see the museum.
,,A very moving and thought provoking experience.,5.0,,"Although the museum is small it has such a story to tell. The suffering and strength shown by so many is told in personal stories. It takes about 2.5 hours to read all the materials. You can get an audio tour. The chapel and the murals have their own personal insights. A place worth taking the time to visit, especially if you are interested our world history."
,,Good WWII Museum,5.0,,"Worth a visit for an hour or so. We stopped there on the island tour with Tour East If you are interested in WWII, go there."
,,Unforgettable school trip,5.0,,"Year 11 students from Phnom Penh, Cambodia's french school. 5 days and 4 nights school trip to Singapore with two teachers. Went to Changi museum last wednesday afternoon. Personally, it was the highlight of the trip. I learnt so much about the Japanese occupation, the Changi prison, the fate of prisoners of war, the suffering, the anguish and death. Moved me to tears. Loved the museum and loved the three hours tour spent with the best guide ever, Mohamad Sharul. The guy deserves a promotion. Definitely recommend the museum."
,,Thought provoking,4.0,,"We stayed at Changi Village Hotel so caught the bus from outside the hotel, approx 8 stops to the museum for S$1.50. This is a small but packed museum. It tells of the horrors in Singapore during WW2, with journals from prisoners etc so you really get a feel for what they went through. Very moving, thought provoking place to visit.
Free entry with the option of a guided or self-guided audio tours. It details

If you are in Singapore, it's well worth a visit."
,,Sad but excellent museum,5.0,,"I visited Changi chapel and museum and was very impressed by the museum's displays, friendly staff and excellent audio guide ($8).

Although covering a tragic time for the people of Singapore the information could not have been better presented and is complimented perfectly by the audio guide. I spent two and a half hours in the museum and chapel and learnt so much.

I travelled via public transport and can recommend travelling by MRT to Tanah Merah and then catching the number 2 bus. The bus stop and which side of the road to go to is clearly signposted and I would say the bus journey is about 15 minutes.

A definite visit if you are interested in the history of Singapore during ww2."
,,Part of an organised visit,5.0,,"A very moving couple of hours understanding the suffering imposed on the singaporeans and allies during the second world war. I watched ""The Railway Man"" after the visit which added poignancy to what I had seen."
,,very moving,5.0,,"I have been there on prior occasions, this time with my wife and 2 friends who had not been there before.
What a great tribute to the human spirit and mateship.
If going there does not move you I doubt you have a soul.
If you are in Singapore dont leave it off your schedule.
Easy to get to by taxi or bus.
take the MRT to Tanah Merah then a number 2 bus to the Museum, all public transport runs very frequently.
Tip, take the audio tour well worth it."
,,Just Do It!,5.0,,"Don't miss out on a Tour to Changi Chapel & Museum it is so enlightening! Not only will you discover the truth behind the fall of Singapore, you will be let into the lives of so many heroic people. We toured with Singapore Walks and our tour guide Nancy was fantastic!"
,,Changi Chapel,4.0,,A well set up & interesting display. Worth the price of the audio tour. We caught a cab from our hotel & ended up getting the bus back to the city which gave us an unplanned but fun tour of the suburbs for SGD1.50 Stay away from the onsight restaurant- overpriced & average food.
,,Packed with info and doesn't take long,5.0,,"Cost: free. The museum is small and packs so much information, as well as a huge punch. My party were moved to tears. Ideal for anyone interested in WW2"
,,Moving ....A fine little museum,5.0,,"I could not help be moved by this wonderful historic museum . The objects and especially the oral histories by those who were there made it memorable .
Also a wonderful volunteer helped to find a record of an uncle of mine who was a prisoner there under the brutal Japanese . I can just remember him as he did not survive long after his liberation and return to Australia .. he mentally and physically never recovered .

Well worth a visit by all especially Japanese people who need to know the real history.
note there is a restaurant attach but it seemed too pricey for me . jump on a bus or catch a cheap taxi up the road to Hawker stalls in Changi Village .

Some great art works by the internees where new to me . .
I recommend this very much!"
,,A Great Experience,5.0,,Every visitor is assured of an exciting experience at the Changi Chapel and Museum; The Westin Singapore is a great accommodation choice to consider.
,,A must visit.,5.0,,"As an Australian, I'm ashamed I didn't know more about the horrors of Singapore in WWII. I certainly did at the end of the tour.

The chapel is also a beautiful quiet spot to reflect on what happened during that moment in history after visiting the museum.

A must do for any Australian in Singapore. Grab the audio guide for an even better experience."
,,Top guide story teller,5.0,,I went on this tour with my 26 year old son Tom and we had an excellent guide who told many stories. The story telling I found to make the tour as the stories brought to life the times.
,,Musuem is very informative,4.0,,"The chapel is a replica. The musuem is not very big but it holds lots of information and the displays are well set out. Don 't miss the changi tree outside the museum, it has a small plaque at the base."
,,Bucket List Singapore,5.0,,"We chose the wrong tour to go to Changi which only allowed us 45mins in the museum, so check that out before you book. 45mins is not long enough and we had to return the next day with another tour to view the whole Museum. There is a tour that is 7hrs and includes lunch which is probably the most efficient if you have the time. Unfortunately we did not find this one in time. It was interesting to note that the original Changi Chapel is in the grounds of Royal Military College Duntroon in Canberra Australia and the one you are viewing in Singapore is a replica. That said it is still worth the visit young and old alike."
,,Poignant and stark reminder of mans inhumanity,5.0,,Easy to find on public transport. This museum evoked thoughts of singapores darker pask. I felt it was essential to expose my daughter to the historical reality of ww2 so that she understood the struggles that underpinned this ultra modern city state. An absolute must if you visit singapore.
,,Tour,5.0,,"A most worthwhile visit . The guide was excellent , informative and knowledgeable . The museum is not very big but the guide brought Ito life ."
,,"excellent museum,",5.0,,"We did an organised tour, which was very good. could have had more time at the museum because there is lots to see.
Very moving for me as my uncle was a ww 2 prisoner in Changi, then the Burma railway. He survived and returned to Tasmania."
,,Moving moment,4.0,,"Went here on then only day we had rain,and was way worth the visit.well presented and clean the. Ladies were lovely and very helpful.
The research and displays were well presented and very moving to see these peoples/history and stories from the war. and the pain theywenthrough ."
,,"Time has healed the wounds, but not forgotten them",5.0,,"The original Changi Prison from WW2 no longer stands, other than the front wall entrance gates & 2 guard towers. In its place is the new Changi Civilian Prison. However the suffering of Aussie POW's in the original Changi hell hole is now enshrined in the Changi Chapel & Museum. The Museum is very tastefully done, but does not shy away from showing visitors the suffering, the atrocious & cruel conditions our POW's endured at the hands of their Japanese captors. It also highlights their resilience, strong spirit and support for each other. It was most fitting, that on our tour, were 2 young Japanese visitors, who like us were appalled at what happens in times of war and shocked by the brutality of the Japanese Military during its time of occupation of Singapore. A timely reminder of what's gone before, but never to be forgotten"
,,Great little museum to visit,5.0,,"Although I had expected there to be more of the actual prison at this museum I was very impressed with the whole place. Usually there is a guided tour at 11.00 but not the day we went. We did however, rent the taped tour which was very informative. It took us through the whole museum in about 1 hour with lots of information along the way.

Would for sure recomend this museum for anyone interested in history, history of Singapore and WWII."
,,History of a saddened past.,5.0,,Changi is a must visit and an educational reminder to young children of the sacrifice of the residents and the brave soldiers of WW2 who suffered under the hardships of internment by the Japanese during the occupation of Singapore. It is a factual memorial of these hardships no matter how unpleasant it may be to be reminded of. Such an event should always be defended against in the future.
,,Good history lesson,5.0,,Very interesting learning about the occupation of Singapore in addition to life as a prisoner of war
,,Superb,5.0,,what a piece of history this place is a must see very educational for adults and maybe teens if interested very clean and tidy like all of singapore
,,Sad Part of Singapore History,5.0,,This must have been a desperate time in Singapore history. It's very well done. We took the audio tour and was well worth it. Lots of stories about the people who were imprisoned. Such courage. Lots of school children are brought here...so important that they never forget the price of freedom.
,,Visited museum in 2012 - Very moving,5.0,,"I lived in Changi when a child so really wanted to find out more about the area. The museum was extremely enlightening I did not know how badly the Singapore people had suffered in the WWII. I felt it was not Britains finest hour but it was very interesting, I was really pleased I went."
,,sobering,5.0,,"I am japanese and feel ashamed for what was done , it is a bit far out , caught the number two bus , well presented museum ."
,,war museum visit,5.0,,"We did a organised trip it was very good. only problem we found was the guide showed and talked about what was on show in museum she was very good. but when she finished she left us all to look at everything ourselves. but we found we needed more time to take everything in ourselves before we had to get back on bus, but still enjoyed this part of history"
,,A 'Must' for every generation,5.0,,"A chilling reminder of the cruel and terrifying levels of behaviour to which man will stoop.
Use of the audio equipment is vital here. Follow the museum, exhibit by exhibit.
Don't miss a single one.
It is a chilling and a sombre experience.
It is important that we pass this awesome knowledge to the following generations in order that a live chain of credulity be maintained through the decades.
We met people there whose fathers had been imprisoned at Changi.
I remember meeting several, friends of my father's, in my childhood .
In gung-ho Britain, we are only taught at school about the British prisoners there.
In fact there were so many others.
Indians, Singaporeans, Dutch, Scandinavian, Australians - the list is endless.
They must not be forgotten.
There is a book there with all the names.
Read it to absorb the enormity of their courage and suffering.
It is up to us now, to respect and guard their selfless, humbling legacy.
End up in the chapel and read the messages of those who have visited before you.."
,,Sad Memories,4.0,,"I took the Singapore Walks tour of Changi POW museum and some of the defences. As an Australians it was very moving visiting the museum given our losses there during WWII.

The guide was very good. I would recommend this tour for anyone interested in the experiences of soldiers and Chinese civilians during the Japanese occupation."
,,History that must be shared and remembered.,5.0,,A really interesting and informative museum with the exhibits displayed well & the audio tour very worthwhile. Be prepared for a emotional journey through the history of Changi and the suffering of the people during the war.
,,Sad but a necessary part of visiting Singapore,3.0,,"There is a small museum commemorating the years of the last war and Japanese occupation. There are a few artefacts and much printed material. It's all very sad but an appreciation of those times is important. The chapel is very small, the shop and catering facilities fairly primitive."
,,A must,5.0,,Very informative. Excellent guide. Humbling to see what some of our troops in WW2 had endured and risen above
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,"The museum is not massive but covers most aspects relating to the occupation of Singapore and subsequent liberation during WW2.

On first glance the museum looks light on but there is plenty of detail and artefacts and is worth taking the time to read the poignant stories. Ask the reception to book your return taxi ride back into the city (15 mins)."
,,Interesting bit of history,5.0,,"not to be missed, take a taxi here, use the headphones, very interesting place. The museum has good air con which makes it a comfortable place to visit."
,,Powerful Changi,3.0,,We visited the chapel and museum and can say we were pleased we did this at the end of our trip. Wouldn't have missed it however it raised some strong emotions reading the story of the experiences of the people during the 2nd world war
,,"Very well set out, interesting, well worth a visit",5.0,,"You can get here by MRT and bus (about an hour travel) or taxi - 20 minutes depending on traffic, about $20.
Most of the museum is indoors with aircon, only the chapel is outdoors.
This was very interesting and educational, about the Japanese occupation and prisoners of war. Well set out, not overly sensational, and tasteful.
Allow about an hour at least to get the most out of it.
Nice open air cafe (good fans to keep cool).
Recommended."
,,Very moving,5.0,,"We usually get told a great deal of information about the soldiers who suffered here, but I was pleasantly surprised on hearing about some of the locals who suffered and helped the prisoners. Very moving and very informative."
,,Poignant,5.0,,"As my father- in -law was a prisoner here,it was very sobering and horrific. Well laid out with some reproductions as the originals were destroyed. A must place to visit."
,,Small museum,3.0,,The museum is a little small and off the beaten track but displays some relics and info on the state of WWII prisoners. Good for history buffs of WWII.
,,Very moving,5.0,,Sensitively presented and very interesting. An ideal visit if you have a couple of hours to spare before taking a flight from Changi Airport. Audio guide is well worth the extra cost.
,,Very moving and informative,5.0,,"I was disappointed to discover how much of the original buildings etc had been destroyed and/or demolished some of them not that long ago! However the museum, its contents and the Chapel are certainly worth a visit, the audio is very moving with many accounts and recollections voiced by the people themselves who experienced some awful events. The chapel is a reconstruction but again very special in what it represents."
,,Very moving experience about WWII in Singapore,5.0,,"I visited this museum based on recommendations from Trip Advisor. I took public transportation, which was simple and easy to follow. There is a nice cafe next to the museum where I had lunch before going into the museum. I arrived outside of a guided tour window so I
paid the $8 for the self guided audio tour, which i highly recommend. There are easy to read sections and a corresponding number for the audio tours. Several of the sections can be quite disturbing as they highlighted the atrocities committed by the Japanese during the occupation of Singapore. There is a nice chapel outside to honor the memory of the interned. While the subject matter is intense, it's an important part of the history of Singapore, so a visit is highly recommended."
,,Very moving exhibit.,4.0,,You must get the audio guide to really appreciate this WWII museum to hear how the people suffered in their own words. Two people could share one for $12
,,very moving,5.0,,"It was lovely to visit here as it was new to me,when I lived in Singapore Changi prison and RAF Changi were still there standing.Its good to see that what happened at Changi prison all those years ago are not forgotten."
,,Very interesting and impressive,5.0,,"We went here because our friend's father was imprisoned here in WW11 as a POW. We had hoped to find something of his craft (he used to paint on the food tins) or in general about the Dutch POW's, but there was very little, it was mainly about the Australians and English. Beside that it was very interesting and I learned facts, especially about the local population, I never knew. Entry is free, SGD $ 8 for the audio Tour. We ended up having lunch in the restaurant and that was very good, albeit on the expensive side."
,,"""Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.""",4.0,,"A visit to this museum would be a high water mark of your visit to Singapore. The museum tells of the Japanese occupation in Singapore during the Second World War. One would come away after half a day at the museum with so many lessons and so much sadness. One learns of the horrors of war. You would be touched by the iconic sketch adopted as its insignia by the museum: ""Two malarias and a cholera"" - a sketch showing two emaciated prisoners suffering from malaria, propping up between them another inmate suffering from cholera. One learns too of the colonialists, who were in Singapore to exploit the ruled, and to enjoy themselves in the sun, leaving the island badly protected. They surrendered to the invading Japanese, even though they outnumbered the Japanese 6 to 1! One learns of the need to defend one's own country, because soldiers whose homes were in England would never defend an island not their home. In contrast, the local soldiers, in particular the Malays, fought bravely. Then there are the wall murals, large paintings by the POWs in the prison where they were interned, depicting scenes and quoting from the Bible. One in particular, portrays Christ on the cross and bears the inscription ""Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.""
This year marks the 70th anniversary of Japanese defeat in WW2. The refusal of the Japanese to apologize for their atrocities in the War, and rumblings about Prime Minister Mr Abe going to play with words about an outright apology, prompted me to write and pin up a note on the board. Written in Japanese (with the help of Iphone App), I wrote: ""Mr Abe, please apologize. Thank you."" Let's hope that some right minded Japanese (and there are of course many) would somehow help put things right, starting with the lies that are still being peddled in the Yakasuni Shrine in Tokyo."
,,Interesting and imformative,5.0,,The service was amazing and it saved you from the hot weather the museum shows a timeline of world war 2 and the battle for Singapore. we were treated greatly and we were able to find my great grandfather. I would recommend it to anyone else even if they didn't have any relatives that were part of the war.
,,Informative and respectful,5.0,,Excellent historical information and fantastic staff who go above and beyond to help research your questions! We are so happy we took the time to pay our respects and learn about our family's place in history. Thanks so much!!!
,,Very moving!,5.0,,"Visited here with Dad, was a very moving and emotional experience to read and view all of the history and pieces. Definitely worth visiting if you are history buff."
,,Changi,4.0,,"Worth a visit although of course the chapel is no longer in it's original place and it's not the original chapel, although the Cross is. Allow enough time to go round the museum, it's heart warming and heart rending at the same time."
,,Informative piece of history,4.0,,"If you are into military history then this is the place for you. My partner went here and said that it was very good, as it was very informative and educational. He also said that the displays were quite good as well.
The drive out is a little way - near airport, but he said that it was worth the taxi ride."
,,Truly moving,5.0,,"Like any museum or 'attraction' of this nature, some of the material contained therein will be disturbing/moving/upsetting but this particular museum is very much worth the visit. It's a bit awkward to get to by public transport so grab a taxi and save yourself the hassle. The museum is very well laid out, definitely shell out the few bucks for an audio tour (if you can't make an actual tour) as the audio most definitely enhances the experience and provides the human side of the terrible events of WWII. After seeing the museum there is a very lovely café outside where you can enjoy some lunch in the shade and mull on what happened in Singapore during the war."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Four of us got a taxi to changi chapel and museum our friends father was a prisoner during the war as were many others and and she wanted to see where he was held. if your in Singapore take a trip here it will make you appreciate what others went though for us
,,Really good discovery,5.0,,Great Mediterranean restaurant with wonderful atmosphere. Booking essential if you go during peak times.
,,A return to forgotten memories,5.0,,"It was not until I walked into the Museum and saw photo's of WW11 that it brought back to memories of Changi Military Base where I spent several months as a serving visiting soldier and visits to the Prison as guards, this is so trauma to those that have fought in a war but also shows how much harder it was for those that were imprisoned there as POW's, but I think it is a must see for all who visit Singapore, don't miss it."
,,A fitting memorial to a terrible era,5.0,,"The Changi Museum is beautifully laid out and the sound guide easy to use and informative. One is aware that there is not much left of the notorious Changi prison camp from the time of the Japanese occupation of 1942 to 1945. The artefacts are well displayed and the whole experience is a daunting reminder of what war does to the people involved. After a couple of hours we felt as though we had had enough of hearing terrible stories of man's inhumanity to man - it is a very thought provoking experience.

We come to Singapore often and have never visited Changi Museum before, probably because we come for a holiday and this is a very dark reminder of a horrible period in history.

David C"
,,A moving experience,4.0,,The trip to Changi Chapel and Museum was a very sad experience. The chapel is a replica and the museum is not the old prison. There is a prison nearby and part of the new prison has been built to look like the original. The museum tells you about how allied armed forces troops were treated from 1942-45 and also how the Chinese were also badly treated too. A very sad and thought provoking experience especially the muriels that were uncovered in the 1950s.
,,A very moving experience,5.0,,A visit to Changi Chapel and Museum is very well worth the effort of getting there. It was both very moving and interesting to learn of the fall of Singapore to the Japanese. I found it heartbreaking to learn of the savage cruelty suffered by the prisoners but also quite uplifting to hear of the way these difficulties were overcome by some. The audio tour is excellent along with the displays and information as you go round the museum and chapel.
,,Don't miss this,5.0,,"A fantastic place to visit, you must check it out and show your respect for all those who suffered so terribly in Changi Prison. Be prepared for some very harrowing sights and stories.

We even managed to find information about my wife Jill's uncle Jimmy who was a prisoner of war there before being marched off to Burma where he tragically died. A very emotive visit indeed"
,,A lesson learnt,4.0,,"Museum very moving. A great insight to the struggles of the native Singaporean people, as well as POW's incarcerated by the Japanese. Had no idea that Japan changed the name of Singapore and the time zone during their 2 year occupation! Great learning experience!"
,,Very moving memorial,5.0,,"This is a must for any visitors to Singapore. It is easy to reach via the MRT (under ground) then one short bus ride. Pictures, scripts and audio tour give details of the history of Changi prison and is presented very sympathetically, a very moving experience."
,,An outstanding history of Singapore,5.0,,"We forget how brutal the war was on Singapore. A bad military decision on the part of the British, led to devastating results. The museum is small, but very very packed with artifacts and information. A must-see."
,,The emotions ran strong,5.0,,"I believe that as a patriotic Australian with many family members in the military, this is a must to see and to pay one's respects. I lived in Singapore in 1972 and 1973 and all this was still in operation. The jail still operated as did the hospital. My daughter was born there. Now I go back and have memories many will not. I sit and look and wonder and my imagination runs riot. It's a place of serenity now where you can go and be thankful of how Singapore is now, such a safe environment. My experience is memories; yours will be new and you will need to read the information and truly imagine what it was like then. You will leave just a little bit of yourself there when you leave. It has that effect."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This is an incredibly truthful and thought provoking museum, I knew nothing of the occupation before hand. Even my 6 year old daughter understood the explanations and stories."
,,reminder of times gone by,4.0,,"This is an excellent exhibit, a little out of town but worth the effort. We were interested in understanding what happened in singapore during WWII. This is a well presented reminder of what happened during this time and a stark contrast from the singapore we see today."
,,Very poignant,4.0,,"Off the beaten track -as you would expect with this being next to a prison. The journey requires a train and bus if you aren't on a tour - however this MTR is simple enough to follow and the buses are regular cheap and clean.
In the museum it is worth getting an audio pack as this gives far more information than just reading the boards.
The chapel outside is a lovely area for reflection with sand from the beach where prisoners were taken and executed used for placing candles.
A place to visit and reflect ."
,,Very moving,5.0,,"A very moving place, the story of the suffering is hard to comprehend and the museum and chapel are definitely worth visiting."
,,An informative and moving visit......,4.0,,"This museum, is a bit off the beaten track but if you have a couple of hours to spare it is definitely well worth a visit. Free to enter and headsets are provided with a really informative tour which takes you through the various stations in the museum for a small fee. The chapel has been recreated along with paintings taken from the original chapel. The museum certainly portrays the horror of those few years back in World War 2. There are many pictures and photos and articles from the Japanese occupation. As always in these places there is the usual gift shop and a cafeteria attached too. As I said, well worth a visit."
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,"Take a taxi from the city, costs about 20 dollars. Tells the story of Singapore during the Japanese occupation. Not ashamed to say that I shed more than one tear at the bravery of the local population and the suffering of civilian and military personnel"
,,A terrible story told sympathetically,5.0,,Small museum that tells the whole story of the invasion of Singapore in 1942. If possible take the guided tour.
,,Very informative if a little old fashioned in style.,3.0,,This is a display greatly assisted by the audio guide. It is well worth a visit but don't expect children to want to spend more than a few minutes here. Having said that my wife and I found it very interesting and had to be thrown out at closing time. It gives another side to the happy go lucky Singapore we see today. I don't think there was an entry fee but you did have to pay for the audio guide.
,,Take the no. 2 bus all the way from downtown Singapore....,4.0,,"What we didn't realise was the no. 2 bus that starts near the Dorsett Hotel (where we were staying) goes all the way out to the Changi Chapel and Museum and saves you from having to catch train/s and then the no. 2 bus from the last station. The museum isn't well sign posted until you are upon it; so it pays to look out, or have the driver tell you when the stop is. Cause we were sitting upstairs on a double decker bus we missed the stop and had to walk back 500m to the museum. Once inside though we enjoyed the sombre wander and all that the museum had to offer, including a small chapel, souvenier shop and cafe (which was unfortunately closed due to Lunar New Year on our visit)."
,,Worth Visiting,4.0,,"I did not know much about the fall of singapore disaster, but after an hour or so in this museum, the details become clearer. So many lives lost, and not just Australians. I did not know about the many many Chinese and Indians that lost their lives. The museum is not outstanding but there are many interesting and sobering photos, and I recommend a visit particularly if you are from Aust, NZ, UK or India."
,,A Worthwhile Visit,5.0,,"To know a little more about Singapore's historical past in a different perspective, the Changi Chapel & Museum is a visit not to be missed. The murals drawn by the POW's during the Japanese Occupation really captured my attention and I started to enquire more about their sacrifice and how the chapel became such a place of seeking some peace and spiritual direction."
,,A Must See,5.0,,"Brilliant, for all Aussies it is a must see, all the documentation of those who were POW's are there, and the staff were very helpful."
,,Exploring Singapore's darkest hours,5.0,,A very moving tribute to the Allied forces and the people of Singapore who endured defeat and the Japanese occupation during World War ll. The documentation and first hand recollections are at times harrowing but what happened should never be forgotten. This museum brings the story to life.
,,Lovely memorial,5.0,,A beautiful and poignant reminder of what Singapore and the allies went through during the war. Some amazing stories of courage and survival
,,Worth it!,4.0,,"The Information provided are very interesting. The Way they are displayed are good, although we found the order a Little bit confusing. This is a great Place, bit unfortunately it is a Little hard to go there by Public Transport, coming from the Airport."
,,Very informative,4.0,,"I took this tour on Monday, 2/16 and Carol was our guide. She is extremely knowledgeable and narrates with passion. She gave much information about the Japanese strategical invasion and Australian/British (reluctant) surrender. An intriguing history but very sad for so many victims, both Asian and Occidental. I would have liked to peruse the Museum a little longer as I hold an interest in POW's and civilian experiences and survival, but overall this was a very good tour to take. I think those of us who had parents living and serving during WWII can probably relate to this more so than younger people, though they should be contemplative about this horrible time so as to realize what people did to survive (or sacrifice) during that time. JL, U.S.A."
,,A very moving visit,5.0,,Because of an uncle being in prison here it was a very important and moving visit for us. The story is told very well and the staff very helpful and interested in your family history.
,,Changi Chapel & Museum Tour,5.0,,Yesterday my husband & I went on this tour & have to say it is highly recommended. Our guide Carol was fantastic she is so full of knowledge. If you visited by yourself you would miss out of so much history. Highly recommended & if you are lucky enough to have Carol as your guide more so.
,,Far East Trip,5.0,,"Well worth the drive out to the museum , it shows the horror that
the prisoners had to endure and the story is told very well .But you need to spend at least an hour reading the stories, so perhaps a taxi is better ,than a tour as they rush you too much"
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,We visited on a weekday so not so many individual visitors but it was good to see Singapore school groups visiting. The museum is tastefully presented with a balanced synopsis of the fall of Singapore and the incarcerations by the Japanese. The information is easy to take on board and 90 minutes disappeared quickly. We didn't hire the audio guides so the visit was free. Transport links are very good - the no2 bus runs from outside the museum to connect with the MRT at Tana Merah. We're glad we visited. Note that there is no photography allowed inside.
,,"THIS IS A MUST, BUT VERY SAD",5.0,,"Even though they have moved the Chapel to outside the prison, it is very moving, they have a board with letters written by some of the prisoners during the war. The museum is incredible, and if it doesn't move you emotionally, I don't know what will. I would definitely visit, but you will have to take a taxi, or train and taxi"
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Although Changi museum is a bit out of the way it is definitely worth the visit. I paid an extra $8 for the audio tour as it made the experience a lot more immersive. Really hit home to see the hardship that the men, women and children went through during Japanese occupation. A must for history buffs!"
,,Thought provoking.,4.0,,This was a very interesting place to visit. There were not lots of people and it was easy to wander around at your own pace. We paid for the headphones which tell the story of the Changi gaol and the surrounding area and we spent two hours there. There is a restaurant next door which served a good mix of Eastern and Western dishes. A good place to go for a cool beer!
,,A salutory reminder of the sacrifice of an earlier generation,5.0,,Interesting history and very humbling. This is an important reminder of the courage and sacrifice of a previous generation at the hands of a terribly inhumane invading force.
,,So Personal,5.0,,"The personal stories, photographs and memories. The chapel murals and the work of the various artists brought home the feelings of the inmates and how they tried to cope. We expected to be there a short while but had lunch there and then went back to experience more."
,,"Moving, inspiring, and informative",4.0,,"Please make this museum a port of call, as the 2ndWW was a defining moment for Singapore. The residents and troops went through hell during the Japanese occupation, and this museum documents the facts figures and hardship that was endured by the locals and the defending troops."
,,Thank you,5.0,,"We paid $12 for a personal guided tour of this historic place, built on the barbaric acts of one country during the Second World War. Tears flowed as our guide took us through every minute of the role Singapore played in those years"
,,An Excellent Museum,5.0,,"First of all, how to get there.

It involves a combined MRT and bus travel. I suggest using the MRT to get to Tampines Station on the East West line (about 30 minutes from Orchard Road area). Tampines is a bus interchange. Walk through the market, turn left and go to berth 9 of the bus interchange, looking for Route 29 (Changi Village Loop route). The stop you are looking for is 6 stops from Tampines and is Stop 97201 on Upper Changi North Road called ""Opposite Changi Chapel Museum"", cross the road and you are there. About 1 hour journey each way.

The museum is open from 9.30am to 5.30pm Entry is free. Guided tours are $12, last 45 minutes and leave at 9.45, 11.00, 13.00,14.00 and 15.00.

The museum itself is a poignant tribute both to mans inhumanity to man as well as how humans cope under significant privation.

The displays are thoughtful and well laid out."
,,Very Moving,5.0,,"Well worth the visit, much like the Old Ford Museum with more detail. If the history of WWII in Asia is your thing it's a must see, however I would suggest this isn't for young children. There are a lot of facts, pictures and displays that relay what war did to this country. I can't state that we enjoyed it, rather we were moved and informed by the displayed facts. All adults should visit for sure."
,,Take the time to learn about the history of Singapore,5.0,,THis is a must if you wish to understand the history of Singapore. It is impossible to go through this place and not feel a deep respect for the people and their heritage. Try to get your taxi to wait as it is not near any taxi stands.
,,A Tough Chapter carefully presented,4.0,,"This place was never going to be easy to visit: it covers a highly sensitive time and sets of issues. So visit it carefully and seriously, and give time to seeing aspects of the recent past which, very sadly, seem to be repeated in our generation with other labels. You can join a formal tour or use audio equipment provided (which was our preference). The re-constructed Chapel was simple, open-air, but also poignant, as was the fact that this museum is located very close to the current (and huge) Changi Prison complex. You can reach it from the city centre on bus No 2 (from Victoria St), but it takes a while."
,,very moving,4.0,,"A lot of trouble has been taken in setting up this little place of pilgrimage. It is small but, given the material, more than enough to absorb. Not easy to get to by MRT but the bus stops nearby.
One suggestion - the Museum is a long way from the city and only (I think) has one food/drink outlet option. I wish, on this occasion, that we had brought a picnic."
,,"Quiet, comtemplative museum",5.0,,Although the fresco on display is not the original (that is inside a military compound some distance away). the small museum and chapel explain the history and significance of the Prisoner-of-war camp well. Parking available.
,,Gives an excellent account of conditions for the POWs in Changi,5.0,,I liked the fact that there was a lot about the local people and how they were treated as well as conditions for the Allied POWs
,,Excellent and interesting historical information..,4.0,,"I have to admit I was oblivious to the World War history of Singapore even though I have seen a few movies made about it. I am so glad our wonderful tour guide, Anna Ong, took us through and helped to explain it. Of course there are self-guided tours as well."
,,thought provoking,5.0,,"this was part of the tour I took today, but was the reason I had taken it in the first place. We were allowed just under an hour so didn't do the audio part as I wasn't sure I had time so I can't comment on it.
The museum is a u shaped building around a replica of one of the prisoners chapels. It is pretty well laid out and through various exhibits and testimony you get a snapshot of the hardships that were faced under the Japanese. You cannot take photos in the museum and it was nice change not to have to avoid them!"
,,Well worth seeing,5.0,,"This was brilliant, and the only charge was for the audio which was also great. I had recently seen the movie Railway Man and it helped to understand a bit more what the POW's went through."
,,Informative,5.0,,"We learnt a lot. If travelling here from Singapore central, I'd recommend visiting other places as well to make the most of the trip (we took bus and boat to Pulau Ubin)"
,,History,4.0,,"What happened here in the past is very Overwhelming for some people, but in saying that , the Museum is very well put together and very Tastefully done. If you have a few hrs. before your flts out of Singapore , it is worth a look, they also have a good Restaurant. For a quick bit to eat"
,,WE REMEMBER,5.0,,Photos and stories of real people and what happened to them make this place talk to you even if you weren't around at the time. I knew some people who were imprisoned here so it brought me closer to them and helped me understand what they suffered during WWII.
,,"Sobering museum, knowledgable docent",5.0,,"We went to this museum to honor my father in law who was a British soldier at the Fall of Singapore. I cannot compliment our docent, Kathryn, enough, who went out of her way to help us. From looking up his service number to sharing her research and knowledge along the tour she made this tour truly special."
,,moving experience,4.0,,"It's a well put together exhibition, chronicling the life of POWs under the Japanese. Many original letters and stories. Part of this moved me to tears"
,,More than you realise..,4.0,,Visited the museum in April 2014. You are able to have headsets to assist you with the displays. At first I said I did not want them but my husband and other family members had them. After a few minutes walking around the displays I realised I needed them to fully understand the impact of each the displays. It was very emotional at times as you actually heard people talking about their experiences. At one stage I found my sister in law sitting in front of a display with tears streaming down her face as she was quite overwhelmed by it. I would highly recommend a visit here. A truly moving experience.
,,very moving,5.0,,Came here on our last day and was really moved by this. I've always been interested in WW2 history and did not know much about the occupation in Singapore so was interested to learn about what had happened. Will never forget my experience here and has made me want to learn more about it.
,,Amazing view of a civilian wartime camp,4.0,,Expatriates in World War II were imprisoned at Changi. It's a stunning view at life in a prisoner of war camp that held women and children.
,,Great memorial to all those who suffered during the war!,5.0,,"The displays and audio tour are well worth looking at and tell some very interesting stories of the Japanese occupation, life and finally the liberation. Well worth a visit if you have the time."
,,Very interesting and noticed Tian Tian Chicken Rice on the way!,5.0,,"On bus about 5 stops before the museum I noticed the restaurant. Bef Jln something. We had tried to eat at the one in Maxwell Centre but the queue was crazy. I jumped off bus 2 on my way back from museum, walked in, had a nice table and enjoyed chicken rice. The museum was so interesting, very sobering. Definitely worth the one hour ride from Bugis."
,,Make the effort to go there,5.0,,"Use the efficient public transport system to get to this small but informative and thought-provoking museum. While the museum is surprisingly small, the exhibits are powerful in their simplicity. The audio tour is very good. Also, the Bark Cafe attached to the museum is not too bad a place to eat."
,,A must to understand Singapore,4.0,,Small but poignant museum that helps people understand the history of Singapore and what it went through to arrive where it is today. So many suffered and this in a small way shows the character of Singapore.
,,Well worth a visit.,5.0,,"Although a little out of the centre of Singapore, this small museum is easily accessed by the efficient public transport system. The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. There is no entrance fee but the audio tour, for which a modest payment is necessary, is very good and I would recommend it.

The museum tells the story of what Singapore was like during the Second World War. The exhibits contain ordinary objects that attained special significance and tell a moving tale. The fate of allied PoWs is simply but effectively told and the tour ends in a mock up of a chapel that they built (and which has since been moved). The altar cross, made by an English PoW is, however, original."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"this museum shows the strength of the human spirit. Very thought provoking. A way out of town, but easy to get to. Take the East West (green) MRT line to Tanah Merah. Then directly outside the station take a number 2 bus. Make sure you press the bell for the driver to stop at the museum. He knew a few of us were going, but still shot past the stop as no one pressed the bell!
We used the prepaid card (like an Oyster card) to get around, which can be bought for 12 dollars at the MRT stations. This gives you 7 dollars credit and can be easily topped up. Can be used on the underground and the buses (make sure you tap both in and out on the bus).
I think it cost about 10 dollars for the 2 of us there and back from Sentosa Island to the museum."
,,Not as expected,3.0,,"I must admit to being initially a little underwhelmed with the museum - it was not quite what I expected.
Although the museum delivered a very powerful message and it was very moving it didn't have the 'atmosphere' that I expected.
Maybe I was just expecting something different"
,,disappointing,1.0,,Saw more in movies on the war in this conflict. Not enough information. Nothing of original left standing.
,,Never forget.,5.0,,"What a brilliant place,so so sad to see what happened to prisoners,but how they survived and what they did does make you proud."
,,Very moving - important to remember,4.0,,"A well presented museum capturing the lives of both the POW's, the internees and the local villagers under the Japanese Occupation. Not easy viewing but always worthwhile to remind ourselves of both the good and evil of which humanity is capable. There are both audio tours and excellent conducted tours available but the exhibits are sufficiently moving on their own if you prefer reading and thinking. Choose what works best for you.
We ahad an excellent lunch at the on-site retsuarant."
,,A reminder of the hardship the Diggers endured,4.0,,I was surprised that the Museum was part of the Changi Prison which is still in operation. The museum was an eye opening experience and showed the progress of its use from the start of the invasion in World War 2. The various displays give a real sense of what the life was like there and the hardships endured by the prisoners. The displays include numerous items which were in use at the time. The written material allowed the visitor to gain a deeper understanding of events and how the people lived and died. It is a solemn place and it takes some time to move through the different areas. It really brought home just how poorly people can behave towards each other and yet the triumph of spirit of the prisoners to endure and survive.
,,Powerful stuff,4.0,,"This was a very moving museum which taught me a lot of things I did not know about Changi. Very well done and very respectful, well worth the time, 2 hours is more than enough. Entrance free, audio guides cost."
,,THIS IS MUST FOR THOSE WHO REMEMBER A SAD CHAPTER,5.0,,At first I was under-whelmed at the smaller size than I expected. BUT once I got inside and read (you need to take the time to stop and read) the presentations I was quietly moved. The stories were all presented in good taste and with respect. I could not have visited Singapore without a visit to 'Changi'.
,,Take your time,5.0,,We visited this location as part of a tour. A little bit more time would have been great. So much to read and understand about the wartime history of Singapore.
,,Changi Museum – a pantheon of undaunted spirit,4.0,,"Changi museum, a humble dwelling of WWII relics holds the colonial past of Singapore for history lovers and a unique sentiment for those who in some way connect to the havoc of WWII at Asian front. The Museum and the adjoining Chapel are situated at Upper Changi Road North, about 1km away from the Changi prison which was known for its notoriety during Japanese occupation of Singapore.
During my recent visit to Singapore, the museum topped my list of must-see places. I stayed at the Orchard Road; from there it took 20 minutes and 16 S$ in a taxi to reach the museum. I visited Singapore during Christmas, hence, the only day I could plan this visit was the day I returned, which was 27th December. I had an evening flight to catch, so reached the place sharp at 10 in the morning. The Changi village area that came my way while reaching the museum was far less crowded and soothing to the urban eyes due to the lush green surroundings. As I approached the unobtrusive building, the Chapel appeared near the gateway, the entrance to the museum was at the right side of it. Quite in contrast to the mad rush at the so called tourist attractions of the port city, this museum was calm and near empty. A certain aura of melancholy hung in the air which was hard to explain. The lady at the counter cordially explained the rules of visiting the museum; ‘not taking photographs inside’ was one of them. I opted for an audio tour @ 6S$ per person and started my exploration.

The Changi Chapel is a replica of the Chapel that was created at the Changi Prison during WWII. The brass cross at the centre was made by Staff Sergeant Harry Stogden from 4.5 Howitzer shell. At a board in a wall several visitors, most of them descendants of the POWs left loving notes that were definitely an added attraction and touched a chord within.

It took hardly half a day to visit the museum, but the experience was of a lifetime of exceptional courage, zest and above all the futility of war."
,,"Changi Chapel and Museum, Singapore",5.0,,"An emotional experience, well worth the visit. An eye opener for those who have heard about it but didn't know the full story behind it. A must see."
,,A History of Hardship,5.0,,"Changi is important to the family history of many, including Australians like me whose parents, grandparents or great-grandparents were held there for a shorter or longer time during World War II.
The museum has a great display of information and artefacts, laid out in an orderly progression around the building. I found the museum was a good way to introduce my children (14 & 12) to some of the darker parts of war - and the depths of compassion that can be found among people even in the cruelest times of their lives."
,,Very moving,5.0,,This is a must see. Although small it tells a powerful story of the difficulties faced during the occupation of Singapore. Very moving and sad.
,,very interesting - worth the visit,4.0,,"This was a very interesting experience you can do the audio tour $8 take a guided tour $12 roughly, the guided tour would have been great but time didn't allow for it, This museum is free and is a replica of the chapel that the prisoners of war built during their time in captivity, the museum itself has many different displays and lots to read, quotes and memories from prisoners very moving and also rises a feeling of anger that other human beings treated others like dirt. it was very informative, only downfall is no pictures allowed to be taken inside the museum except of the outdoor chapel, which is a bit of a shame as there is so much to read and take in and I asked before entering if they had a book with all the information that they had in the displays and they said yes in the gift shop so I didn't read everything but when I got to the gift shop they only had books that were written from certain prisoners point of view, It would be great if they made a book of the displays and information they have on display so you could read the information at a later time. Definitely worth the trip it takes about 30mins by mrt and the another 20mins or so on bus"
,,Good experience,5.0,,This is an insight to what happened to singapore during the invasion from japan. It shows what happened to prisioners in changi and also when they were made to work on the burma railway. It brought a tear to my eye with all the bravery of all these prisoners. We must not forget the suffering they went through . A excellent memorial but is not that well advertised as even the taxi driver asked if we knew the way
,,Lest We Forget,4.0,,"The easy way to the Museum is by taxi, and for the return trip the staff will call one for you. Air conditioning makes for a comfortable 1 1/2 -2 hour visit. Take the excellent audio tour and hear the voices from the past."
,,Worth Visiting,4.0,,"If you love history, then you must visit this place. Lots to learn about Singapore's history and how Japanese invaded during WWII. You get to learn so many things with the maps, photos and other infographics. It is worth spending few hours to know the moving history of Singapore.

Tip: This is very close to Changi Airport. If you are taking MRT from airport then alight at Tanah Merah MRT station. Ask, Passenger service officer which way to exit as you need to take a bus to reach the Museum. There is NO MRT station directly to the museum."
,,a very moving experience,5.0,,"Spent a couple of hours at this museum. Excellent presentation with photos, maps, illustrations and personal records. Full history of the events leading up to the occupation, the defence of Singapore, life in the city during the occupation and the fate of Allied prisoners of war.
Its a moving experience with some very distressing records yet many uplifting illustrations too.
As a army veteran I felt honoured to visit and in so many ways pay respect too."
,,Changi Museum,3.0,,Our visit to the museum was part of an organised trip by our hotel. There was not sufficient time to see the whole museum which gives a unique insight to the struggles of both locals and prisoners of war during the Second World War and the occupation of the Japanese. Certainly worth spending an hour here during your visit to Singapore. There is a cafe/ restaurant attached to the museum but I did not have time to sample its cuisine.
,,A Constant Reminder,4.0,,For those who had an understanding of the many countries involved with the defence of Singapore during WWII and the lost lives and terrible living conditions experienced then this is a worthwhile visit.
,,Moving place to visit.,5.0,,This is a very moving place and should be viewed by all so we do not forget the atrocities that happened during the war. Unfortunately we were on a tour and did not have near enough time to view it all as we would have liked. Plan on a minimum of 2-3 hours.
,,Very sad,5.0,,"After entering i was confronted by things i could not imagine, to think people did this to other human beings, it made me cry at the strength of the people of Singapore and the POW"
,,Interesting viewpoints on the Japanese occupation of Singapore,4.0,,Get a close up perspective of the hardship and cruelty suffered by the local population as well as POWs during the Japanese occupation during the 2nd world war.
,,Changi One on One,5.0,,"Brilliant, made an appointment to see Jon Cooper a British Military archaeologist, who assist me in looking up my family. You would need to make an appointment to see him, as he is not always at Changi Museum."
,,Beautifully done,5.0,,"I have wanted to visit Changi Museum for many, many years but this was the first time I managed to get there. Entry is free. The presentation of information, the chapel replica and customer service on the front desks is first class. Very moving and sympathetic to all nations who were involved in this significant part of Singaporean history. Thankyou."
,,Very well done & moving. Worth the effort to get there..,5.0,,"Although a bit off the beaten track a visit to Changi museum and chapel is very much worth the effort. We accessed by MRT to Tanah Merah and then a 10 min taxi altho the no 2 bus from the MRT works just as well as it stops outside the museum.

The museum is small but well presented. It is well worth getting the audio guide as this complements the displays excellently. The stories shared are very moving.

Highly Recommended !"
,,Changi Chapel and Museum,5.0,,This was a place I'd always wanted to visit having been an avid reader of WW11 novels and long time interest in Singaporean Colonial history. It has been conscientiously preserved and well worth a visit to fill in gaps on your knowledge about the history of South East Asia.
,,Very emotional,4.0,,I did a half day tour. Had a great guide and found very interesting. Museum is informative and well worth visiting.
,,Local WWII Experience,4.0,,"This is a small but well set out museum and memorial. I was interested to read about the experience of the local Singaporeans. I knew about the expat community and soldiers but it was interesting to learn about how the locals were treated.

Public transport to the museum was difficult from our accommodation (Clarke Quay) so we caught a taxi. We had to wait a while for a return taxi so if you have access to a phone it would be worth ringing for a taxi."
,,very moving place,5.0,,"Very moving place to visit, the museum is well kept and is a great place to visit if you are into WWII history about the Singapore invasion by the Japanese and the Prisoner of War jail at Changi Prison."
,,Def worth a visit,5.0,,A very insightful look into Singapores invasion in world war 2....I had no idea prior to this visit! A must see on your Singapore visit!
,,For the WWII history....,3.0,,"this is a small Chapel in Changi.
they have taken great pain to put together all the information available from the POW during WWII.

It is Air Condition!
It may takes you 2 hours if you go thru every exhibit carefully.
not suggested for the children and young.

you will appriecate the visit if you really like to know what POW went thru here during WWII.
this venue is a distance from town.
traveling by taxi from town will takes you 25mins.

this is a stand alone venue.

the good news is .... there is a cafe next to it.
you can have a coffee/ beer break before or after your visit."
,,A fitting tribute to Australian WWII soldiers.,5.0,,A quiet and somber venue which reflects on Australian soldiers involvement in Singapore. It reflects on the suffering endured and recalls on heroism exhibited by Australian soldiers without glorifying the horrors of war.
,,A place for contemplation,5.0,,"We have been to Singapore 5 times and every time we come here. There is a lot of thought provoking material here that is frank, honest and and difficult to take in all in one go so we always come back and read some more."
,,A very interesting visit.,5.0,,"The chapel and museum is about what happened in Singapore during the Japanese occupation. I had read about the railway and seen a number of films, but knew nothing about what happened in Singapore. A very interesting and sobering exhibition."
,,Excellent memorial,5.0,,"This is so well done and moving ,it brings to light to what happened in Singapore when it fell to the Japanese .As a daughter of a P O W who was in Changi it was quite enlighting and moving to read what my father and others went through"
,,You must pay a visit,5.0,,"No matter how short visiting this museum is a must. It details using first hand accounts of the many mistakes made by the Allies in the defence of Singapore and the terrible suffering of both the military and civilian populations. It is clear that the locals have never really forgiven the colonial power (British) for failing to defend the Island. It is very well set out and with the audio tour the story from the Singaporians, the soldiers and civilians unfolds. A bit of history we should never forget. If you have no previous knowledge of this episode in World War II it will not matter the museum tell the story clearly and passionately."
,,Definate thing to do,5.0,,"Brilliant! This is a MUST for everyone. I think to get the most out of the place you should hire the headsets. Hearing from people actually imprisioned at Changi, heartbreaking. Particularly about the Comfort Women, that I new nothing about. Made me cry."
,,"serene, poignant visit",4.0,,Changi Chapel is an aesthetically simple and elegant place for you to learn about and reflect on the lives of the POW during the Japanese Occupation. Quite out of the way but worth a visit
,,"Tasteful, provocative, yet an afterthought",4.0,,"It's a great monument, for an important part of Singapore, and associated countries.
My wife and I took the local public transport to reach it (maybe S$2 each way), entry is free. We did hire the S$12 audio for two option, and it made it a very memorable event.
The museum is modest, and has relied on many contributions of the family of former detainees, but has also cobbled together a well laid out story of the sorry tale. It is provocative, as it should be, at times emotional, and sometimes amusing.
We spent about 90 minutes wandering around the museum, which touchingly surrounds the poignant chapel. It is air conditioned.
I recommend taking the time to view this museum, and memorial. It is especially touching for Australians, but as I see, touchingly, also people from Japan, NZ, UK, USA, Malaysia, Holland, India and of course Singapore.
I am sad that it is a very modest facility, seemingly out of the way of the way, and away from the former POW camp site."
,,Remembering the Tenko series of the 80s in England,4.0,,Although the museum has relocated and not as enjoyable as my first visit 12 years ago. I would still recommend you visit. Less we forget the horrors of times passed.
,,Changi for Historians,4.0,,"This is a poignant place for a visit. The exhibits are most enlightening and serve to highlight the plight of all on the island, soldiers, sailors, airmen and, perhaps more importantly, the local populace who suffered badly under the administration of the Japanese.
I only wish that the museum had a visitors booklet on sale as there is so much to see and, since photography is not allowed (quite rightly), too much to remember.
The replica chapel area is quite an emotional area.
Everyone who visits Singapore should visit this attraction as it will serve to remind the world of the futility of war for generations."
,,Changi Museum,5.0,,"Must see when in Singapore, about an hour tour, guides grandparents where there when Japan invaded Singapore, very moving experience"
,,A story simply told,4.0,,"Another Commonwealth war site off the beaten track. An MRT and bus trip, but not difficult to get to once you understand the systems. Entry is free and we took the audio tour at Sing$8 each to take our time. Telling the story of the fall of Singapore in 1942, the Occupation through video, commentary and articles from the time. Simply told, my wife did not know the story and came out with a complete new outlook on Singapore. Unfortunately it is small and Changi Prison itself just up the road is actually used today as a Government prison so although you can see the gates and the towers you can't get access, so you have to picture Tenko in your head. Nicely kept and friendly staff."
,,Sobering exhibit,4.0,,"The staff at the museum were really warm and friendly. My friend and I went on their tour (SGD12/pax) and the lady was very patient and brought us all around the museum and told us stories about the war and the POWs then.

The museum is out of the way, much much farther away than any tourist attraction, but I would recommend going there in your free time. Most of the visitors are, according to the staff, families of or the POWs themselves. But I would recommend locals to visit this museum at least, and then have a bite at Changi Village which is just a bus ride away."
,,Moving & Memorable,5.0,,Visited Changi Museum today. The guide was knowledgeable yet sensitive and spoke in a profoundly moving way. In fact he made the visit!
,,moving and emotional,5.0,,"I have visited Changi Museum at least five times .... each time the feelings and emotions are the same if not deeper.

This is one place everyone should visit at some stage of their lives.

If you have ever had a family member as a POW, a visit is even more important.

The displays etc are amazing. There are books and other items for sale... and a cafe there too.

Take time to visit Changi, its not a place to rush through and you wont want to either."
,,Must Go,4.0,,"Well maintained and good audio guide available. Restaurant outside is a pleasant retreat form the heat although over priced.
It is a bid sad that the actual chapel is a replica and not the real thing!
Lots of history and lots of disturbing facts about the number of soldiers that died fighting the Japanese. Sobering experience for me - pity more young Singaporeans don't visit - they might learn to be a little more humble!
Lessons never to be forgotten."
,,Worthy place to visit,5.0,,"Plenty of information as you review what happened to POWS' and civilians during the occupation by Japanese soldiers in WW11. Sad for all concerned, however, it has to be looked at with great hope for the future thanks to the efforts of our men and women who endured for all of us. It was disturbing, but uplifting at the same time, especially with the wonderful initiatives and creations of some of the prisoners. I did not find any reference re Weary Dunlop, but may have missed that. The real prison is no longer, however, I think that is for the better. Thanks again to Singapore for keeping the story alive and thanks again to all who entered this horrible prison as POWS. You will never be forgotten."
,,a touching memorial,4.0,,"Having just read ""the Railway Man"", before we arrived in Singapore, I wanted to learn more about the history of WWII in that part of the world...I found the Changi Chapel very touching, and the museum even more so...but still thought that more history should have been presented there...The chapel is a replica with some absolutely spectacular original art done by one of the POW inmates (with immense skill and using the most unlikely materials for paint). The story of the prison itself, as it concerns the POW prison, is presented in photographs and lengthy text...along the walls in a small area adjoining the grounds still housing the Changi Prison. While descriptive, and evocative, I felt that so much more could have been said to honor all the brave men who were imprisoned there, many of whom died there. It was a tragic time in Singapore's history and I hope that the war museum is preserved and expanded to remind all men of the evil and tragedy of war..."
,,Interesting!,4.0,,It was quite sobering to visit this museum - would however have liked to have seen more of the real prison.
,,Humbling,4.0,,"It was a very moving place.
Emotions high knowing that my Grand Farther was a POW & to read about the conditions that he & his mates had to endure......... Words can't describe.

We found booking a tour was the better choice of getting around to all of the sites including the War Memorial."
,,Somber Museum Is Worth The Time,5.0,,"This somber museum reminds me of The Holocaust Museum and Dachau as it is a beautiful tribute to human bravery. It shows that many of the horrors that preceded WWII were occurring in various parts of the world. As the human suffering and mistreatment began in Europe, so was there suffering and mistreatment in Asia. Then came those who tried to defend and protect, and they became POWs with amazing strength and the ingenuity to laugh at their captors. I was proud of all the Allies - especially the Aussies who bore the brunt in this part of the world. We hear that history repeats itself...let's hope that it is not true in this case."
,,Interesting and moving,5.0,,"I think the museum presentation is excellent. Lots of photo-boards with short chunks of information, following various themes of the impact of the Japanese occupation on both civilian and POWs.

The recreation of the chapels is well done.

Allow plenty of time if you are interested in history. You don't need a guide, but I think it would add a lot to the experience and If you don't arrange a personal guide, there is an audio guide which I understand takes about 90 minutes.

Even if you are not that interested in history, you will still be moved by what you see.

However, I think young children will get bored."
,,Moving.,4.0,,"Quite a small museum and adjacent replica Chapel. Mainly consisting of photographs and artefacts belonging to prisoners and locals alike, with personal written records of their treatment and experiences whilst in Changhi prison. An audio guide is available at a small cost, but you can also read the accounts for yourself around the exhibits. Not as extensive as I expected but worth a visit."
,,War history,4.0,,"Was smaller than we expected, but got a guided tour from Henry who was very interesting and had a lot of knowledge that had been passed down from his family about life in Singapore during the war"
,,A Peaceful Place,5.0,,Didn't know this memorial was here a beautiful peaceful place to visit with lovely views of the city in the distance as well.
,,Display board history and some artifacts,3.0,,"Worth visiting, but not very dynamic. It consists of a lot of reading with some photos and mostly replica artifacts of the awful Japanese occupation and the plight of Singaporeans and Allied prisoners of war. There is a bar/restaurant adjacent. It will take quite a ride on MRT and bus to get there. On the way you will pass the current (rebuilt|) Changi Prison, which is worthwhile to see in itself |(from the outside, that is)."
,,Interesting but sad,4.0,,"We visited here on an organized tour, at the suggestion of the hotel concierge, rather than travel independently by taxi. It was an excellent suggestion. Learned things we never know about the Japanese occupation of Singapore. A bonus was that our tour guide was the son of parents who were detained here so he was able to relate very personal accounts. Could have easily spent another hour or so in the museum even though the tour did provide ample time. We are then able to see the surrounding area and stop at a local housing/shopping area and get a feel for everyday life in the residential area of Singapore."
,,"Very well presented, worth a visit",5.0,,"VISITED ON a tour so needed more time. Very interesting and moving, lots of info presented in a user friendly fashion. Loved the replica chapel."
,,Very informative visit and bitter sweet for those looking up war inmates!,5.0,,"The guide was very informative and thoughtful , allowing us time to find our relatives and show respect for our losses! An essential place to visit when in Singapore!"
,,Thought provoking,5.0,,"Changi prison and chapel is not on the original site, but the reconstruction and the museum give a very good insight into the prison and life there. We travelled by bus from the city centre which took about an hour, but this gave us a chance to see areas of the town which we would not have visited. I would recommend having a guided tour as the guide will explain many aspects of the prison clearly. Our guide took a lot of trouble to point out the fortitude of the prisoners and their comradeship and support for each other. She also explained that many of the Japanese soldiers were following orders, which if disobeyed would possibly lead to their own death. The focus of her talk was on the positive aspects of prison life. After her talk she gave us the opportunity to light a candle in remembrance of those who had been there and then we had additional time to look at exhibits again. This was a very moving experience."
,,Sobering reminder of our Galant military,4.0,,"They have done a great job of telling the story, well worth a visit. If you get a taxi there, museum staff will phone free for one to pick yu up as its not close to taxi or bus routes"
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,This museum has a vast collection well worth looking at and we would thoroughly recommend it to any one visiting Singapore. I is close to the airport and has excellent hotel accommodation around this area.
,,Surprised & a Little Disappointed,4.0,,"As former soldier I expected to be able to see the original Changi Prison, but sadly all that remains is two guard towers & the entrance of the 180 meters of the original front wall that remains and this cannot be seen up close as it is nestled behind a 3 meter high lattice fence covered with green mesh. The museum was quite moving and the chapel, although a replica of the original, gave the sense of what was experienced at that time."
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,A little effort to get there by public transport (MRT then bus or taxi) but worth the time. It provides a comprehensive account of the Japanese occupation of Singapore during WWII. A must see for Australian visitors in particular. A great bar / restaurant on the site as well.
,,Very Emotive,5.0,,Guide was very informative. Able to obtain information about relative who was POW. Very emotive visit.
,,Dad,5.0,,"Went to follow up my Fathers time spent in this Prison and was fortunate enough to speak with the Curator, who generously gave us his time to pull records and confirm all our details. A real credit to all involved in keeping this history alive and told."
,,Tells the Story of WW II,4.0,,This is a small museum that tells the story of the history of Singapore in the early 1900's thru the occupation by Japan during WW II. The photographs from the POW with a hidden camera of the reality of the war are impressive. The art work created by the prisoners is a must see at this stop. The museum has a gift show and area to buy drinks and snacks.
,,Sombre memories of WW2,4.0,,Singapore is not all about shopping & the modern day attractions. This island has a history and a visit to the Changi Museum will bring the reality of what people went through in 1943. The museum has been relocated and is not quite so poignant as it was in its original location. Well worth a visit however.
,,education and touching,5.0,,This is a very interesting and educational museum which gives an insight into the plight of the POW victims it is truly moving
,,Wrong message given,1.0,,"I hope Trip Advisor will permit this review to be published because my visit to Changi Museum was very emotional for all the wrong reasons.

I expected an historical display of photos and other memorabilia and an acknowledgement of the brave men who were imprisoned in Changi. Yes, there were photos, historical items, copies of relevant documents, but the impact of those displays was completely eroded by the staff member who was encouraging visitors to discuss the behaviour of the Japanese. She was even discussing with a Canadian tourist how disgusted a mother was when her son brought home a Japanese girlfriend. The staff member's continual loud berating of the Japanese was appalling. I asked her if the Museum's aim was the perpetuate a dislike for Japanese people and she replied that many people didn't like the Japanese. She then pointed to the Canadian tourist and said ""she hates Japanese"". I was in Singapore for a three-day stopover after five days in Japan. I manage a Japan/Australia youth program on behalf of my country and I can assure all readers that modern Japanese are friendly, overwhelmingly generous people. They are so kind to visiting international youth. I don't know any other culture that compares. For Changi Museum staff to be encouraging hatred after nearly 70 years is appalling. I have no other comments to make."
,,A MUST SEE,5.0,,There is always a problem when you are on a tour and a museum is included in the tour (not enough time). Although not large by museum standards you needed to read every document to get the feelings of our armed forces during the occupation of Singapore and the trials and tribulations of Changi POW Camp. I would advise anyone visiting Singapore to set one day aside just to visit Kranji War Memorial and Changi Chapel and Museum. Paul and Lorraine Milperra nsw Australia
,,The journey to Changi is long,3.0,,"When I got there I thought the displays could have been shown to better effect. Pity because it is a very interesting and moving ""museum"" - but difficult to examine in more depth."
,,Is got the artiee feel to it,3.0,,this is a place in occassionally visit for one reason or the other. Cuz is close to Loyang. Is place to unwind! but to the socialite seek further in town i would say :)
,,Memorable,4.0,,"Full of history and interesting stories to read, but for me I thought the Canberra war memorial museum alot more informative. For those people that lost loved ones in Singapore during that time, then yes very poignant to visit."
,,very moving,5.0,,This place is very special. Very well laid out and the museum is really informative. Worth a visit to remember those who were POW's in WW2 and the atrocities that those people faced. Very peaceful area at the chapel.
,,Emotional Visit,5.0,,"This is well worth the visit. We spent a few hours here and did the audio tour. It was an extremely moving and emotional experience and by doing the audio tour, we felt we really immersed ourselves in it."
,,Better for WWII Enthusiast,3.0,,Small place with emphasis on POWs. Chapel was rebuilt a few times over the course of time. Can complete the place in half an hour. Probably a good place to visit if you have a short stopover in Singapore since it is quite near to the airport.
,,Overpowering,5.0,,"The experience and feeling of overwhelming pride of how the troops endured pain ,starvation and suffering during there internment in ww2. I took the audio tour with my 93 year old father. A returning war veteran. The pride in his eyes made the whole trip worth while. We must never forget what one human being can do to another."
,,Oustanding,5.0,,"We spent a couple of hours here following our pilgrimage to the Kranji War Memorial and Cemetery at the opposite end of the city. The museum is a must for anyone remotely interested in the Japanese attack on Singapore and subsequent long occupation as well as the life of the allied POWs. Heaps of artefacts interspersed with loads of personal testimonials really bring the story to life. The museum has a restaurant and bar on site though they don’t serve many light snack items, mainly full meal choices. A trip to the museum does entail a journey of around 45 minutes to one hour depending where you are staying in Singapore and will probably entail use of the subway and local buses, which are efficient and frequent. Please make the effort to visit this museum, it’s worth it."
,,Moving experience,5.0,,"This is definitely worth the visit. The centre is only small but the memorabilia, photographs, letters and stories make the experience very moving. Entry is free. However my wife and I hired the audio tour and at just S$8- each it was worth it. There is a guided tour too, but we arrived just after a tour had commenced.

Photography inside the museum is not allowed.

We spent approximately 1 hour at the museum. There is a small cafe within the grounds of the museum. We did not use it so we cannot comment on it. The complex also has a small gift shop.

The centre is a fair distance from the Singapore CBD. As recommended in the tourist brochure we travelled by MRT to Tanah Merah station, then caught a bus to the museum. MRT and Bus costs are very cheap and a good experience too for tourists."
,,Worth the hour long trip out of Singapore,5.0,,"It was not easy to get to this museum. I arrived in Singapore before my hotel room was ready and saw a bus (no. 2) at Clarke Quay that went to Changi Village and stopped near the prison and museum. I journey took over an hour and I got off at the Prison, but didn't realise that this was the modern prison and not the prison museum which was about a mile further on, past the women's prison. It was, however, worth the effort as it was a moving and beautiful experience. The exhibition takes you through the invasion, British surrender that was probably the worst moment of WW2 for the Allies, and the occupation. All the horrors were depicted: the deportations, the rationing and lack of food, the fear, the torture of prisoners and the personal accounts of individuals such as the ""comfort women"". Although entry is free, it is worth paying for the audio guide. The staff were very helpful and informative. I stayed for two and a half hours. I thought drinks at the café were quite expensive."
,,Poignant,5.0,,"I knew someone who was interred as a POW in Changi, and I was expecting to see the actual prison grounds, but it is in a still-running prison, with only an original wall left that you see from the road.
The museum was really interesting, with a few original items from the POW's, but a lot of things are only replicas. The cross on the chapel was an original though, and it was good to sit down and reflect on the horrors of war, which, unfortunately, still goes on. We could have doe with more tour time - you have to be a speed reader to go through everything in the allotted tour time!"
,,Great experience,5.0,,This isn't the most technological up to date exhibit but it has raw power. Audio only available in English. Takes about 90 minutes to see everything. As an Aussie its a must see. It can't really convey the horrors of the railway but it tries. My step dad helped build the railway - it didn't come close to conveying the inhumanity of the Japanese camps. I really was moved and loved this exhibit.
,,Sober and reflective place to visit.,5.0,,"Entry to the museum is free, but I would highly recommend the audio tour - at time of writing, S$8 per set, or you can share one set between 2 with two sets of headphones for £12.

The museum itself is quite small, but the audio tour brings the exhibits to life, and has interviews with survivors of this brutal period. Some of the stories are heartbreaking.

It is a place to walk through slowly, take your time, and read/listen to everything there. It will really make you think, and understand what life was like under occupation."
,,A sense of history,4.0,,"The Chapel does an excellent job of presenting the events of the fall of Singapore and subsequent hardships of those detained. The exhibition combines the story in words and pictures with artefacts that bring the history alive. It is certainly worth getting the headset to get more of the details.
The restored wall paintings and the story behind them are memorable.
The simplicity of the chapel itself is a fitting place to spend a few minutes of quiet contemplation at the end."
,,Delightfully Interesting,5.0,,"I knew little about the impact of the Japanese on Singapore during WWII, where, Australian, British and India troops tried to help the Singapore locals from the invasion of the Japs. The short battle in which 10s of thousands of defending troops were placed in prison camps under extreme conditions, resulted in a occupation of nearly 4 years during WWII. As was the case where Japanese held prisoners, the conditions were inhuman, as the Japanese culture looked upon soldiers who surrendered as cowards. Their attitude was reflected in their disgusting handling of the prisoners. The tour last less than 4 hours and is well worth the time when in Singapore."
,,"I came, I saw.",5.0,,"My Dad was taken prisoner by the Japanese in Singapore and was imprisoned first of all in Changi Prison. The museum holds moving records of what it was like for the people imprisoned there; the chapel is a fitting memorial to them. For those who have no personal interest, I think it would still be a fascinating insight into this particular time in history."
,,Moving and informative,5.0,,"Took number 2 bus to get to museum; bus stops just outside. Although free to walk around I paid $8 for the audio tour which was well worth it. The coverage of the different nationalities who were interred in Changi and the descriptions of life in Singapore under Japanese occupation were really interesting. Also interesting to put the place in perspective including its location on the island, how the war came to the island and whereabouts the different barracks were. Very sobering."
,,A poignant reminder of the past,4.0,,"Changi museum is not the easiest of places to get to. We took the MRT to Tanah Merah and then a 20 minute bus ride. For anyone who wants an insight into the events that led to the Japanese invasion of Singapore and the consequent defeat of the Allies, this museum will reveal all.

The place is inevitably a tear jerker. Displays include personal letters between loved ones. Stories of the ultimate sacrifice by many individuals were heartbreaking and stories of those who put their own lives at great risk to save others can only restore one's faith in a trouble ridden world then. It was horrific to know how cruel a conquering force can be towards their prisoners and the local population. My wife and I weren't born then, but nonetheless the visit affected us, it was a humbling experience.

Not to be missed, take lots of tissues."
,,Moving & Informative,5.0,,"My family members & I visited Changi as part of a day tour. We were aware that it would include a lot of interesting facts & photographs specifically relating to WW2. We were even more surprised to find listings of family members who served & lost their lives in the Fall of Singapore, the staff were more then happy to help us in trying to pin pieces of our missing story together & have sent us on our way with much more hunting to do. The place is very humbling & the staff find no task too big or small. It is a must do I feel & will certainly recommend it to all I know."
,,"""A piece of history you may not know""",5.0,,"The tour guide we had, was very knowledgeable. We found the museum very interesting and moving. Taking a trip but in time certainly puts a prospective on ones own life. How the prisoners lived and survived, WWII. We bought the book ""Pacific War"".
Imaging the survival of the locals at the time. To correspond with what is at the museum, we have found little pieces of history related to WWII in around Singapore, especially Chinatown. But you have to keep your eyes open to the stories written on plagues."
,,History That You Wish Would Have Been Different,5.0,,"Very moving series of stations to stop and read, see and listen (I highly recommend getting the audio tour, as it brings to life the sadness of this experience on the Island)."
,,"Moving, Emotional and well worth a visit",4.0,,"Visited this Museum while in Singapore in October. Quite a moving experience to see how the prisons lived read their stories of their survival in WWll. Good collection of personal artefacts or the prisoners. The quaint chapel is lovely to see.

Free admission and parking but you can do an audio tour as well for a cost. Easily accessible by public transport (no. 2 bus from Singapore) drops you right outside. Open every day from 9.30.

Gift shop and snacks also available onsite."
,,Emotional,4.0,,"The horrors of war are well known and as the old saying goes, the first casualty of war is truth, so it's good to see the truth being told here by ex prisoners in their own words concerning the treatment they received, not only at the hands their maniacal captors, but also by the kindness of locals who risked all manner of retribution for their acts of humanity."
,,This is a Must whilst visiting Singapore!,5.0,,"what a great museum! Very thought provoking, sad and a reason why no one ever really wins a war! The audio tour is great...not a must but helpful. There is a lot of content to read and so allow yourself at least 3 hours. I wouldn't be inclined to take children until such time as they can read and take themselves around. Take your time to look in the gift shop at a large array of books and gifts , then treat yourself to a most delicious lunch and well deserved drink at the The Bark Cafe! This is a must do whilst in Singapore!"
,,Quiet place of reflection,4.0,,"This is a small area dedicated to the history of Changi as a Gaol and the period when it was used by the Japanese. As a Brit with a father who was interned here, I expected something different but I cannot describe what because my father never spoke about his time here.
The museum is laid out in a building surrounding the open air church shrine, both are suitable for wheelchair access. There is an audio tour that runs at various set times but I can't comment on that.
At present, there is a display dedicated to the Great War running along the middle of the museum - which isn't large."
,,Interesting snapshot of war history,4.0,,"Save this trip for your way back to the airport, as it's nearby.

A small, but informative museum, photos are not allowed inside the building.

Voices of captives are part of the exhibition, as are personal artefacts.

If you're a war history buff, you'll appreciate the extra lesson - but you don't get a sense of the location as the original prison and chapel have been bulldozed."
,,Aikido trip,5.0,,"If you have had family involved in the far east conflict of world war two or just interested in the history this is the place to visit. VERY MUCH SO.
Our group of eight all of various ages and sexes visited the museum with me as my farther was captured in Singapore and served on the Burma Siam railway. This was my second visit.
All of us were moved by the stories and history displayed in the museum. The staff are lovely and very helpful. It is also free of charge.
There is a restaurant attached to the museum which is very good also. Well worth a visit, but be prepared to take a handkerchief with you."
,,Must see,4.0,,"This was a very moving place. It has lots of photographs and with the audio tour, brings things to life. I could not believe how people were treated and the way they lived during the terrible time, very sad. We went by public transport and it was very easy to get to. Definitely worth a visit"
,,Inspirational and Humbling,5.0,,"Words are not enough to convey the emotional impact this museum has. Throughout the visit one has conflicting feelings of disgust at the depths to which humans can sink and of admiration for heights to which the spirit can soar, and prevail, in the worst of circumstances.In its use of exhibits, documents, information panels and art work it rates as one of the best museums I have seen anywhere. It's simultaneously inspiring and humbling. If you have children with you when you visit Singapore it is essential that they should see it - what happened here should never be forgotten. Wonderful!"
,,An Education,4.0,,"I was quite apprehensive about visiting here, but was taken by the emotion I felt. Quite a small exhibition and the chapel was small, but I learnt a lot about the bravery of these people imprisoned.

Not enjoyable but a must.

A very nice restaurant adjoining which was ready with good coffee."
,,Very moving,4.0,,I like this tour but found some of the displays confronting. You can go at your own pace and you get a personal iPod so you can listen at leisure and not feel rushed.
,,Felt very moved,4.0,,"The museum and chapel was well worth the effort, very moving as you read the stories and see the displays around the walls of the museum. Takes about an hour and half to go through it, we finished off with a light lunch at the Bark Cafe next door, food and service was great and reasonably priced also. We caught a taxi to and from our city hotel to the museum, takes about 20 minutes and cost $13 each way."
,,A Little Museum,3.0,,The Changi Chapel Museum is wonderful. It is small and leaves you wanting more as you do not get to enter any part of the prison. Only a replica of the chapel has been reproduced and is actively used. You should take at least two hours to read through the varied walled posters and exhibits. The book shop is also worth taking your time to find a topic of interest.
,,Very Informative,5.0,,"If you get a chance book yourself on an ""Original Walking Tour"" - Changi WW11. Part of the tour included a visit to the Chapel and Museum. The display was very informative, well organised and above all well air conditioned. Our guide on this tour was very knowledgeable and talked about many of the displays and then we were allowed to spend some time on our own, quietly taking it all in. Toilets and refreshments were also on site."
,,Not a lot to see.,3.0,,"The museum here is very informative but quite small. Because the old Changi jail is now replaced by a modern prison, and the chapel is used by Govt forces, you can't get to see anything of the actual wartime jail apart from a couple of watchtowers visible from the main road (and due to be demolished soon). Overall, a bit disappointing - must be more so for returning ex-inmates."
,,Thought-provoking,5.0,,"All those war-mongers on the loose today should be forced to visit this museum and reflect on how their actions impact on innocent people. The museum is quite restrained in its depiction of the Changi story but the overall effect lingers long after the visit. Little things I will remember, like an embroidered square in one of the women's quilts, with a Welsh dragon, leeks and ""Cymri am byth"". A very moving visit."
,,Changi trip,5.0,,Very emotional but definitely worth visiting. Guide on coach was so interesting telling us about life in Singapore and changi itself. It wasn't necessary to have guided tour of chapel and museum as it was all there to see
,,A place to remember,4.0,,"Changi was during the last world war the terrible prisoner's camp i,n Singapore ,where the Japonese kept the British, Australians, and others prisonners.....it was an awful place as they were very cruels....it was an horrific Time , so many innocents died,, were tortured....it is a must to visit and pay respect....but unfortunatly Changy camp as been altères, not much it left, it is a pity....but still the wooden Little chapel is still there to remember all the martyrs Who died..."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"I visited here as part of of a tour and while the gallery looks at a bit of a depressing subject, it is well presented and does look at the human spirit and how people managed to survive a horrific experience."
,,Revisit 2014,3.0,,"I visited Changi back in 2000 when I found it Raw and Real. In July I revisited and I found that it has been sanitised to appeal to the masses. It was such a horrific time in Singapore history for those that lived, died and those that survived that I believe it should have remained in situ. I completely respect the Australians that took it back to Australia piece by piece, it is a loss to Singapore"
,,Lest we forget,4.0,,"Put this on your must do list. Takes a couple of hours to have a good look around. Got there on the train and bus no 2. No problem getting there at all , takes 50 mins each way from city. Had meal at the adjacent restaurant, really nice with good selection."
,,History,3.0,,"A good place to learn about the past, it was a small, but very well laid out place, telling the sad story. We caught the train to Tanah Merah and then a bus to the museum, very easy to sort out. We did this on our own not as a organised tour. The museum was free."
,,Normal,4.0,,"I'm not a museum lover, so think it's quite good museum. But don't think I wil visit it again if come to Singapore."
,,Extremely Interesting,5.0,,A very emotional visit. Reading personal experiences makes you realise how lucky we are. So many list their lives. The cruelty to the prisoners was horrendous.
,,Excellent,5.0,,So sad but so uplifting at the same time. Take your time. Soak it all in. It's very moving. Shed a tear.
,,Interesting review,4.0,,"This tour was all that we had expected,we learnt more about the prisoners of war in ww 2. It was interesting to find out how Singapore is prepared for any future invasion if it was to come."
,,Very good,5.0,,One of those places that you MUST do once - it is a very informative place giving details and the history of the Japanese invasion of Singapore during WW2 - giving a fantastic display of the horrors suffered by the locals and military and their resolve in this adversity - it is a place I will never forget
,,History and War,4.0,,"Great audio guide with personal stories and pictures, memrobilla and artifacts.lots to see and read. Tells how it really was during the occupation. With a reconstucted chapel from one of the prison camps."
,,Very thoughtfully laid out museum,4.0,,"A very moving museum, remembering a very difficult and painful time for the Singaporean people and the Empire Troops who defended them. It is a sombre experience, but part of the heritage of what makes Singapore so special."
,,Poignant and thought-provoking,4.0,,"Worth the journey out to visit this small museum full of pictures and personal effects of POWs from World War II; eye-opening accounts of Singapore's involvement in WWII, free admission but accept donations so give generously to keep it running!"
,,Truth well told,5.0,,"The Japanese occupation of Singapore was so horrific its effects are still being felt today. This museum communicates so much about those sad times and helps visitors understand how the local inhabitants and the POWs imprisoned in the area were treated by their captors. It's not maudlin in any way, with a journalistic treatment of history, laid out simply and clearly in a series of displays. The audio guide is excellent and we found it best to move along to the next display, see the number and call up the appropriate information on the guide rather than trying to follow the numbers sequentially. If you have a relative or acquaintance who was imprisoned in Changi it's possible to find a record of them if you know the unit in which they served. Light a candle in the replica chapel and plan to visit Changi beach afterwards to complete your museum experience. It's hard to believe now just what happened there in the 1940s. There's also an excellent restaurant at the museum that's well worth a try."
,,Lest we forget,4.0,,"This small museum and chapel located beside Singapore's infamous Changi prison, is a simple yet powerful reminder of the atrocities experienced not only by the POW's but also by the citizens of Singapore during the Japanese occupation. Walking through the museum offers insight not only into the horror and hardship experienced during that time, but also of the resilience, fortitude and dogged determination of both a group of people and of a country of people to survive. Visiting 2014 Singapore is testament to that will of survival."
,,Visit Oct 2104,4.0,,"As I was staying at an airport hotel the journey was quick. As others had said this is a new build museuma and replica chapel, so don't expect old buildings. I did a personal tour and found lots of interesting material in the cabinets and a good audio guide. Fairly emotional as two family members we impacted by the fall of Singapore to the Japs. Took the bus back to the nearest MRT stop which was fairly straight forward.
Then headed to Fort Siloso hoping to see the imfamous guns facing the wrong way - long journey only to find it was closed for Halloween preparations. Ahhhhhh"
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"This is a ""must see"" if you are in Singapore. We went on an organised Round the Island Tour and this was one of the places we visited. The whole tour is well worth doing as it covered such a lot."
,,A History Lesson in Humanity,5.0,,"As a daughter and niece who was raised on stories of Changi and living with survivors amongst my parents friends, this was a journey I was destined to make. Our tour guide, her own family historians of Singapores past and hope for its future pulled no punches in describing the horror of war in Singapore and the lack of defence options. If we are to learn from the lack of humanity in war and that we are at the mercy of those who lead us into battle this is a good place to start.Although you are burdened with sadness you cannot help but hope that we will treat other human beings with respect rather than contempt should we be faced with the dilemma again."
,,Short tour long road there!,3.0,,"It is quite a distance from Town so took some time travelling. However the guide was very interesting and knows his stuff. He threw in some personal anecdotes so it was good. It is quite a small museum-we expected more but the content is good.
Also it has all been moved from the original site so feels a bit of a cheat. We could probably have just read the information ourselves without a guide, but it's not that expensive anyway."
,,Interesting artefacts,3.0,,"Visited Sept 2014 by myself as wife and daughter shopped in town. Sentimental visit as my grandfather was interned here by the Japanese before moving north to work on the railway. Chapel was replica of one in the prison, and museum contained donated photos, stories and transcripts of internees during the war. In all, quite poignant, especially, as I've been told stories of the place first hand. However, if one was expecting remains of the original camp to still exist in some form, then you will be disappointed."
,,Lest we forget,4.0,,The museum is excellent at highlighting not only the suffering of allied POWs but also the treatment of local residents by the Japanese during WW2. The replica chapel is poignant and shows the spirit of those who were imprisoned.
,,Important History but No Unique Benefit Visiting,3.0,,"This museum is a monument to an important part of Singapore's history.

As you visit the museum you will become aware the Changi Prison and chapel no longer exist. As such, very little is added to the experience either by the location of the building itself. I also didn't find it uniquely informative - I felt I have previously learnt more through watching documentaries and reading wikipedia.

I can only recommend visiting this museum if you are completely unaware of Singapore's wartime history, as this museum really only serves as a basic introduction."
,,Interesting and informative,4.0,,Lots of clearly presented information with plenty of personal stories from local residents and prisoners of war.
,,Changi Museum,5.0,,"Very, very moving. Recommend to everybody, a must experience. It's about $15 by cab from Marina Bay."
,,Slightly pricey but good food,5.0,,Extensive choice of Western or Asian food and makes a change from Singapore itself. Ideal if you're planning to visit the prison museum.
,,Special piece of history,4.0,,A little out of the way but a special experience for those who respect history. Make sure that you hire a headphone tour as it has the voices of some of the people who the museum features and gives a very personal account of the history here.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,A small chapel dedicated to all those who lost their lives in Singapore during the war. Something that any Australian interested in our history should take the opportunity to see. A very emotional place.
,,Moving experience but guided tours not offered,4.0,,"Despite checking on the web site before we left, when we arrived we were told guided tours were not being offered any more.It is still a mystery do for any Ozzie who visits Singapore. To try to understand what the men and women went through and to understand how any could forgive is beyond my reasoning.

We travelled by MRT East West line heading to Paris Ris alighting at Tanah Merah, turn right off the platform, under the road to the bus stop. No 2 bus. Do your self a favour and ask the driver to drop you off at the stop for Changi Chappel & Museum. About 40 minutes from town."
,,Must see for anyone interested in WW2 history and POW experience,5.0,,"We headed here independently without a bus tour, was about $20 taxi ride from the CBD area. This is a small museum with a replica chapel dating from the prisoner of war experience when the men needed to have a place of solace and prayer to guide them through what must have been the darkest days. We chose the guided tour, $12 per person, and had a delightful guide, Henry, who was extremely knowledgeable and spoke of his parents' experience which brought the history to life. The replica chapel has a brass cross that was made by a soldier from brass buckles and other metal scraps, and there is a moving story board about the soldier, Harry, and how his family reconnected with Singapore after the war many years later. There is also a replica of the murals on the chapel of St Luke that was in the prison, created by an artist who was a POW. Very moving to pay tribute to those who died for our freedom. Lots of boards to read, and audio guide available at $6 per person."
,,Emotional place to visit,5.0,,The Changi Chapel is a great place to visit. It tells the history of the POWs in WW2 in Singapore. The chapel is a replica but it's is a true replica. You cannot help but be moved by the story of what happened. The place is free to visit. You can leave a donation which seemed more than fair. very informative and worth the visit.
,,Could be much better !,3.0,,"The museum is a place to reflect on the atrocities of war and in particular what happened during the Japanese invasion in the 1940's. There are headphones which can be hired; 8 dollars - to tell the story but they take at least an hour to listen too as you stroll round the one storey building.
Quite a difficult review to write as the experience is moving when you think about what happened, but as an attraction the ""museum"" could be far better in design, layout, exhibits, lighting
When we were there coaches kept turning up and people were allowed 20 / 30 minutes before getting back on the bus."
,,Down History Memory Lane,4.0,,Loved the place that has been revamped. Enjoyed the video of real life history narration. Worth bring friends to visit.
,,Very Moving,5.0,,"This is quite a small museum but I recommend either the guided tour or the audio tour. There's a lot to read but the audio tour puts things in context and gives more information than reading alone.
It's not a place to visit if you need cheering up as it tells the history of the Japanese occupation of Singapore as well as a broader history of WW2 in Asia.
Free entry but audio tour is $8 and guided tour $12, but well worth the money."
,,Humbling and Emotional - A Must Visit for Australians,4.0,,"This little museum is well worth a visit. We spent 2-3 hours there and left quite emotionally sad. Just makes you realise, in a small way, what these people must have experienced during this most awful period. Laid out very well and enjoyed the earphone commentary. I would have liked to have seen more original bits and pieces from that time, not just replicas. Some of the stories told there are so tragic. Does take abit of getting to by public transport but well worth the effort. I'm a Kiwi and found this experience humbling so I do recommend Australians to visit and learn a little bit of what your people had to endure."
,,Interesting,4.0,,It was eaeier to walk round yourself rather than listen to the earphones and talk given through them. the benches being situated along one side were bad there could have been benches on both side would have made it easier
,,More a pilgrimage than an attraction,4.0,,"As my father was a Prisoner of War of the Japanese, having been among the British forces who surrendered and who later 'helped' build a railway, I couldn't let my brief visit to Singapore pass without taking a trip out to Changi. It was a longish journey from the city centre by public transport but worth the time and effort. The museum is free, but there is a small charge if one wants to rent a headset. The story of the occupation and the prison is told through photographs and, coupled with the audio, is a haunting reminder about our nations' sad history. There aren't many artefacts on display - maybe for good reason - and the museum could hardly be classed as an attraction. But it serves as both a reminder and memorial for some, and a lesson in history for others. Visit if you can and if you can make the time to do so."
,,Awesome dedication to our diggers,4.0,,Attended on an organized bus tour. The time allocated wasn't quite enough to read and absorb all the information in the museum as well as attend the chapel. The original chapel has been moved to Canberra (I think) so it was kind of weird to have a replica that doesn't resemble the original. However the museum s really good and makes up for that. As an Aussie I think it a must if in Singapore
,,"Moving, but few artefacts",4.0,,"The museum is mostly full of photos, and the audio sets bring them to life, but surprisingly few artefacts. nevertheless it is something of a pilgrimage for Aussies to visit the replica chapel and read the notes left to fallen comrades and relatives."
,,Such a moving experience.,5.0,,We paid to have someone tell us about the museum and the prison. She was wonderful. We were all moved by what we were told. Please go and learn about some of the Singapore History.
,,Historical place which all travellers should visit,5.0,,All travellers should visit this historical place to show respect to those who sacrificed all to give us our freedom today. Staff were very friendly and knowledgable.
,,History sadness,5.0,,This place was amazing to see and contained a LOT of historical information and it was very sad reading about it all. Spent a fair tie slowly making our way through and left the place in tears.
,,Changi,5.0,,"It was a couple of years ago, when I visited Changi Museum. Is it because I was a forces child that I had to go and visits these places? No it's out of respect to the people who died and were tortured by the Japanese while they occupied Singapore. I picked up an audio tape when first entering the museum and that left me to wander at my own speed and pace taking things in. The painting by the POW's were fantastic how many put their lives at risk doing them to let us know what it was like under the Japanese. I went to the chapel and will admit Where I shed a tear or two it was so emotional inside. After the visits there is a cafe where you can sit and reflect.Yes I will go back again, I am only sorry that I did not due it this year when I went back but I visited Kranji instead."
,,A Moving Reminder,4.0,,We visited the museum as part of an organised tour and had limited time to take in all the information. What we did get to see was very moving and a reminder of the atrocities of war and testomony to the resilience of our POW's. Well worth a the visit but would suggest that if you wanted to spend more time then use public transport to get to and from Changi.
,,Moving,5.0,,"One of the best museums I've been to anywhere in the world. I've been twice now, each time for over 3 hours, and I don't feel I've finished yet. Even though it's comparatively small, the stories are so interesting and moving. Highly recommended. The only drawback is the complicated journey to get there and back. You have to take the MRT to Tanah Merah or Tampines and then a bus. Mind you there's a lively and interesting suburban shopping centre and a decent food court at Tampines, so it's not all bad."
,,Moving Experience,5.0,,"We took the self guided audio your so we could move along alone at our own pace. If was very emotional and moving and found myself in tears at a few points. Some of the audio accounts are powerful and raw so be prepared to feel slightly overwhelmed!

I can tick this off my bucket list. I highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in the POW and their stories."
,,Needs revamped,3.0,,"There is so much material that is available to the museum and I do think that it should be re curated. The chapel is very impressive and it would be hard to improve on this.
Maybe I should have listened to the audio guide, but my tour did not leave enough time for this."
,,Lifetime dream,5.0,,This place takes on an atmosphere of its own. Everyone who visits is emotional and humbled. You can only take photos in the chapel but that is only right. Very informative and I am so glad I saw it.
,,Hotel organised tour,5.0,,"Looked at booking a Changi tour well before we landed in Singapore. Couldn't really find a tour that we liked. Not that there are many options as they are all basically the same 4 hr trip. My recommendation is to wait to you arrive at your hotel and speak to the tour desk. We found a tour by RMG tours through the desk for ~ 30 S$ which was a good $10 - $20 Sing cheaper than online and which included a walk through Arab Town.

Changi a must for all Australians."
,,LEFT A LUMP,5.0,,"i Wanted to visit Changi on our visit to Singapore and feel it is a 'must' for anyone who wants to learn about the history of the war in the Far East. I was a little disappointed that it is not the actual Changi as that is now part of the new prison and is inaccessble to visitors but seeing the letters, photographs and artefacts of the prisoners and hearing their stories left me moved. We had a small group guided tour which was just excellent and made the visit, We then watched a video of the experience of Elizabeth Choy, a lady who had been been held prisoner of the Japanese - her treatment was awful to hear.

I then had an audio guide which provided some more information and was well worth doing.

One very moving aspect was the strings of coloured paper flowers that have been left by Japanese children - as a sign of reconcillation - see my photographs.."
,,Changi we will remember you,5.0,,"After two hours in the museum listening to personal testimonies and witnessing photos & memorabilia charting the Japanese occupation of Singapore, the visit to the Chapel at the end was deeply moving – especially the juxtaposition of the notes from surviving relatives of POWs (one written just the day before my visit) and the Tsuru (collection of 1000 cranes symbolising of world peace) presented by Japanese schoolchildren. No photos allowed in the museum which adds to the sobriety of the place. Audio guide absolutely essential. The story of the murals in the reconstructed chapel was very interesting in itself. This museum is quite small but extraordinarily powerful in its emotional reach."
,,A moving experience,5.0,,This place is a 'must' for anyone who takes travel seriously and wants to learn about the places they visit. The prison/museum is a small building with a huge message. My only regret is that I did not have enough time there but it has made me want to find out more about this piece of history.
,,Man's inhumanity to man,5.0,,A very good insight of life in Singapore during the Japanese occupation. The people of that generation were really made of sterner stuff than generations that have followed.
,,A SLICE OF HISTORY,5.0,,"This site provides an important piece of history for all Australians...and others of course. Located on a very small part of the huge Changi Prison complex, it provides a graphic description of the horrors of the brutal invasion of Singapore and the heroics of the local population and the defending forces."
,,A fascinating reminder of the brutality and futility of war!,5.0,,"My wife and I visited today, and found it and making and fascinating experience, bringing very much to the fire the futility of war, and the extraordinary brutality of the Japanese during WW2.
An extraordinary reminder of the heart and spirit of the POW's - well worth the time to pay a very small respect for their spirit and sacrifice!!"
,,WW11 Memories,5.0,,"The chapel and museum is a must to see,. this museum is full of relics from the POW,s own survival kit and personnel effects."
,,A Little Bit Moving,4.0,,"The Chapel and Museum are simple yet informative, moving and important. This year is 100 years since WW1 and everyone is making great efforts to remember and reflect on the many lost souls from ALL wars. A visit to this museum will help you do just that. It is not all sad though, there are moving stories of friendship and heroism, and survival and determination. Mostly it is sad though. Mans inhumanity to man and the cruelty of war are clearly defined here. There is beauty in the artwork and murals produced at the time and the personal stories, heard in the tellers own words if you take the audio guide (which I highly recommend). An incredibly well documented and illustrated way to show those of us who have never had to make the sacrifices so many did, because they did. I recommend a visit to this site to anyone who is interested in history or humanity. Lest We Forget."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"This museum is quite small, but you need at least 2 hours to be able to read what's on offer plus more time to contemplate what life must have been like for the civilians and the pow's. Messages from family of pow's powerful. I was so moved I could not write a thing. How could you possibly imagine the courage these people needed to just survive. A must for my family to see so that this has less chance of happening again."
,,Moving,5.0,,It tells the history without the political correctness tells it as it is. See it and understand what these men and women went through.
,,A humbling experience,5.0,,Our guide was very knowledgeable and gave a lot of detail that I hadn't previously known. We can recommend the sgd12 tour as money well spent.
,,So moving,5.0,,"Going to Changi Chapel and museum was part of the itinery on our round the island tour, and I specifically chose this tour so that I could visit the chapel and museum. This was very moving, reading the stories of some of the men and woman who were captured. I would definitely recommend a visit"
,,Informative and interesting.,5.0,,"An emotive, informative and interesting look at the occupation of Singapore. Brilliant primary resources including first hand accounts from the survivors and a collection of photos and artefacts. Great value for money and a must see for anyone interested in history."
,,Very Moving Museum,5.0,,"This is an incredibly moving little museum that will take around 90 minutes to see properly... it's easily reached by public transport from the centre of Singapore and will actually allow you to see something other than High-Rises on the trip there.
Take tissues, the museum tells the story of the Japanese invasion of Singapore and it holds little back.. not graphic in terms of visuals though, so OK for kids."
,,"Moving tribute, worth a visit",5.0,,"With my father working in Singapore in the 1950's and living in the Changi area, this museum was a must for us. I wanted to find out more about what happened and why and the museum didn't fail. Good value for money $8 each for an audio tour. The museum wasn't large but very informative, well thought out and well presented. The cafe area was excellent offering a good selection of food and drink."
,,A sad reminder of the past,4.0,,This was part of the round Singapore tour that is available and is well worth a visit if only to remind ourselves of the barbaric way people treat each other during war times.
,,History,4.0,,"Museum tells the history of singpura now known as Singapore,how the Japanese occupied it and place they ruled,now they have reduced this premises from jail to museum and almost 500/600 mts from here you can see the replica of the big old gun used to destroy ships from invading singpura,the real guns have been buried."
,,Back in time,4.0,,Very informative Interesting interviews with past prisoners and guards Very moving A must for all that visit Changi
,,A sobering but enlightening tour,5.0,,"We went on the full Changi WW2 War Museum and trail tour which included a visit to the Changi Museum and Chapel. Our guide was a delightful lady called Whi Whi who entertained us with stories about her name and her upbringing.

She was very knowledgeable about the Changi prison, its history and the tales about the prisoners and their misfortunes at the hands of the Japanese. The tour included a bus trip to the Changi beach where the Japanese executed a number of prisoners and left their bodies to be swept out to sea.

A very interesting albeit sobering tour. My wife was almost in tears at the stories of the prisoners so take a hanky with you."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"You can get to the War Museum by MRT to Tanah Mera on the East/West Line (just 2 stops before Changi Airport. Then take bus No.2, for about 15 minutes. If you ask the driver he will alert you when you arrive at the bus stop across the road.

We arrived at 3pm, and it was fairly quiet, so it gave us two hours to explore all the exhibits, before closing time, which was just about perfect.

Admission is free, but if you want the headset, with various language commentary, it it 8 Sing dollars per set. It is worth noting that one unit will accommodate TWO sets of headphones, so a couple could share, and halve the costs.

It reality, if you are an English speaker/reader the headsets are unnecessary, as the information on the headset is virtually the same as the written information on display.

This museum is a stark reminder of man's inhumanity to man, and also underscores how complacent, stupid and naive the British stationed in Singapore were at that time, and that is coming from a ""British"" person!

Unlike when we visited the Ho Chi Min war Museum some years back, where there were quite a few visiting Americans, there was not a single Japanese visitor present!"
,,Memories not to forget,5.0,,Make enough time to go through the museum it will be worth it. Originally we planned to have a guided tour around the museum but didn't realise tours did not run on the day we wanted ( Monday) this could have been related to a celebration weekend that was happening so check your days we didn't and assumed it would be available . Our grandfather was a POW so this was a disappointment however we used the guided tour headsets which told the stories we needed to hear. Staff were very helpful in guiding us to different information . We spent 2-3 hrs there and were pleased to find a restaurant nearby to sit and chill for a bit with a cold drink. Caught the local bus there and back to Changi Village very easy to do. S$1.50 adult single they don't do return tickets and you need to have the correct change when you get on.
,,A good insight into the war,4.0,,The museum was very interesting in informing about the conditions an Singapore during the Japanese occupation. I like the fact that they played recordings of the actual people who were present at the time.
,,An eye opening rour,4.0,,"Changi & East Coast tour we booked at Orchard Hotel was fantastic. Our tour guide Benny was very knowledgable and pointed out points of interest the whole tour.
Changi museum was quite interesting but heart breaking at the same time.
Would definately recommend it to anyone"
,,A Must,5.0,,Go do it. Free entry and S$8 for a tour headset. Use the bus and MRT. Then catch the bust to Changi and catch a Bum Boat to Ubin S$2:50.
,,powerful stuff,5.0,,Again well worth a visit to try and understand the atrocities committed against the soldiers and population of Singapore
,,IN MEMORY OF MY BELOVED UNCLE,4.0,,"I used to visit the small chapel with the heartfelt, handwritten messages of remembrance pinned to the walls when it was the only memorial next to Changi Prison.. and wondered why there wasn't a more fitting tribute built around it.. and now there is. It is a bit 'in the middle of nowhere'.. but I am always moved to take a taxi out there and find a quiet spot to sit and remember my beloved Uncle.. and the horrors he (and all the other prisoners) must have suffered while building the Burma Railway.. He survived until the age of 72 years..It's now a fitting tribute.. and tells the story well.."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore it is worth a visit to the Changi Chapel and Museum.

I did the tour, which was a very reasonable 12SGD. The tour guide was called Henry and his knoweldge of the museum and the Japanese invasion of Singapore was immense and made the tour very interesting. He brought the stories about the Japanese occupation and people's experiences to life and dealt with some difficult issues in a very sensitive way."
,,Excellent World War II tour of Singapore,5.0,,"I took the ""End of Empire: Singapore 1942 Tour"" with the Changi Chapel and Museum (the company that operates the Chapel and Museum as well as the tour series is called Journeys), and it was a really excellent way to understand not only Singapore's tole in the war, but also the history and geography of the place. Changi takes historical scholarship very seriously, and this was a rigorous, well-researched tour; our guide Carol was knowledgable and attentive, and I would highly recommend her. Some of the notable sites we visited included Labrador Park, were several British gun emplacements have been preserved and which offered great views of the Straits; Alexandra Hospital, the site of a massacre by the Japanese; and Kranji Cemetery, the country's national military cemetery. One of the most impactful parts of the tour was how it emphasized the role played by the city's defenders from so many different backgrounds – Indian, Australian, Malay, British – and how the names of many have been lost to history.

Many of the tours on offer in Singapore are for a very general audience, and you find yourself crammed into an enormous group. Changi and Journerys offer some of the few specialty tours that are well-researched and intimate, offering the opportunity to ask questions and interact with the guide. This tour does not visit Changi, so I would highly recommend coupling this tour with a visit to the chapel and museum, and their other World War II tour that explores the local area."
,,Much needed experience,5.0,,"before even booking Singapore i planned on visiting the Changi Museum to get a real view on what it was like. I found it extremely informative, and it was a real learning experience. The chapel was quite and peaceful and the staff were extremely helpful. The bus route is right outside so it was easy to get too"
,,"Not bad, not amazing",3.0,,"We visited the Museum and chapel hoping to be apart of the tour that takes place on site, hoping it would give us a bit more than us just wandering around. We were told by the lady at the front that there would be no tours on this day due to the local army being taken around instead. Bugger. I purchased the audio tour and made my way around the venue. The stories and information displayed, was very interesting and terribly sad. I was hoping for a more powerful experience in regards to feel of the place, instead of standing in a very modern building. I guess it would have been nicer to be in the original buildings, however this is not possible with the continued growth of the Airport next door. The information provided was very interesting, but the venue itself doesn't truly convey the emotions or 'feel' of what it would have been like to be a POW during the time of occupation. Its a little sterile"
,,Changi visit,5.0,,Excellent but very emotional experience. Very well done. Worth paying for audio to hear recordings of survivors. Very respectfully done. Had a meal at the cafe. Great food & excellent staff.
,,History that should not be forgotten,5.0,,"We spent a few hours on our way to the airport. Staff were very accommodating in allowing us to store our bags while we went on the tour. The tour was excellent and very informative and as we were the only ones on the tour, we got a very personalised tour. I found it quite emotional and very humbling. You need at least 2 hours to be able to read all the information and take everything in. Highly recommend a visit."
,,Bit of history made for a somber afternoon,4.0,,"Really enjoyed this activity - lots of reading, looking and listening - definitely worth getting the audio tour. It was quiet when we were there - would not want to be there during peak times as the place is smallish and if crowed would miss a lot of the displays."
,,"Incredibly moving, even in its third site.",5.0,,"Although this chapel is a reconstruction of the original, the story that it tells should move anyone who visits."
,,Very moving experience,5.0,,"This is a very thought provoking display with some quite harrowing stories and pictures.
It should be a compulsory visit for everyone coming to Singapore - everyone should know what the local population, as well as the allied forces, had to suffer during the Japanese occupation from 1942."
,,Really Moving Experience,5.0,,"The museum is well worth going to.
The eyewitness accounts are harrowing in some instances.
It gives you an appreciation of the hell both the soldiers and civilians went through.
We had an uncle who was a POW there so it was particularly poignant for us.
Make the effort and go."
,,Will always break your heart,5.0,,"I can still remember where I was at school on VJ Day (Victory in Japan) in New Zealand. The barbarism of the Japanese Army was a recurring theme of my adolescence. Ironically, my Dad was a soldier in the NZ camp housing Japanese POWs. These memorial camps through out Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore will still break your heart for the brutality of humans towards each other and the resilience of the human spirit over such evils.
The Changi memorial has been downsized and re-located, for the sake of freeing up development land. Let's hope the next generation does not take that easy way when developers eye the present site. We must resist the efforts to minimize the inalienable messages that these memorials preserve."
,,Reflections,4.0,,It is a nice and quiet place to soak up more on the history and cruelty that has not passed too long ago. seeing the pictures of POW and their sufferings reminds me of how lucky i have been
,,Unashamed to say I shed a tear.,4.0,,I felt a real need to visit. To see and learn more of the history of this place is a must for all Australians. I left humbled but glad for the experience.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,We did a three hour trip of the ww2 war trail bus trip. Our guide carol dragon was fantastic and really gave us a interesting tour. She told many stories of how brave the pow and singorean people were. It's amazing how anyone can forgive the atrocities of ww2. We were taken to the beach where people were taken and machine gunned down. Changi museum has been done very well and is extremely moving. Thank you for sharing a different perspective.
,,Good corner of Singapore with old memories,4.0,,Good chapel that still exist in Singapore. Visited last year and felt it had some nice memory left untold there. If you are free do drop by there the next time.
,,Remember,5.0,,Changi war Museum is a real eye opener to what went on in Singapore when it was invaded by the Japanese. You need to spend the time to take it all in and that could be at least a couple of hours. There is a café and toilets for your convenience and don't miss the chapel. A worthwhile place to visit.
,,History Lesson,4.0,,Well worth taking the time out to see this and read the story behind the occupation and privations of the prisoners of war.
,,Not a disappointment at all,3.0,,"This small private museum has a very good collection of material, well displayed and captions (only a few quibbles). I've heard many Australians are disappointed that it's not larger and doesn't include the actual gaol itself. We have to remember that Changi Gaol is still an active prison and many of the old parts were long overdue for updating. The museum is an accurate portrayal of aspects of a dark period in the story of many countries."
,,Worth it,5.0,,The trip was worth it. Not large but very moving. Staff very helpful and $8 for audio was well worth the effort. Close to public transport.
,,warm atmosphere,4.0,,non air con place but atmosphere is nice for dinner. they has fans running. food is average. service is friendly
,,Changi Museum the Japanese and Singapore in War,4.0,,"Before World War II Changi was a small and peaceful village on the edges of this small island, with the Japanese invasion of the island this sleepy village was transformed into a horrific symbol of the inhumanity of man.

Changi Museum and Chapel is a poignant memorial to the atrocities inflicted upon both the civilian and military population of Singapore. With the use of photographs, letters and personal artefacts the suffering inflicted on the people is powerfully illustrated.

One personal testimony in particular is particularly moving, that of a young wife who was horribly tortured while her new husband was forced to witness her suffering and degradation.

Forget ‘attractions’ like Sentosa, the Garden at the Bay the Changi Museum is a must visit and one that will live in the memory for many years.

Take the audio visit but it can sometimes be a little disjointed and may not match with the exhibits."
,,A valued piece of History,5.0,,Walking around this area one can see and feel the terrible time the fall of Singapore was. This is a very sombre and deep thinking place to see. One needs to take a moment to member the sadness endured here. RIP. Worth visiting this sad time in History
,,A good summary of the impact of WWII on Singapore,4.0,,"Get the audio tour, it will save you a lot of reading - but be aware, not all tracks line up with the location numbers, and not all info is covered in the audio.
Lots of pictures and text. We arrived at the same time as a school group who because of their numbers were a bit noisy, so we waited for them to move on. They didn't stay too long so it was OK. Good to see the kids learning thier history."
,,Small museum with a lot of history,4.0,,The museum is small - a nice size that makes it possible to visit even with young children. The museum is well laid out and neatly ordered. Tracing over the wartime history of Singapore this museum is a must see among the series of war history museum.
,,This is a MUST see,5.0,,This is a must see while you are in Singapore. Well set out and easy too get around. Covers all of the fall of Singapore and the Death railway.
,,So glad we did this,4.0,,Very moving and interesting reflections on such a tragic event. I highly recommend getting the audio tour as is makes it all the more personal. We caught a taxi out to the museum which was about $25. We thought it was well worth it if you are short on time. Give yourself a couple of hours if you want yo have a really good look and listen to all the audio. I found it a very memorable and sometimes emotional experience.
,,Moving experience,5.0,,"Well laid out and very informative. Makes one realise how much we were not taught at school. A very balanced look at things and the longer term effects of the occupation,"
,,Story well told,4.0,,"We took the MRT to Tanah Mesah (on the line to the airport) and then the number 2 bus outside to make this very easy journey. This is a free exhibition however would recommend paying for the fabulous audio commentary which accompanies the story boards and artefacts. Very interesting and moving.
Thanks for the vote if you found this helpful. Happy travels."
,,A moving experience,4.0,,This was an important visit for us as Australians and is accessible by train and a bus which stops out front. The older children understood the significance of the visit but probably not suitable for children under school age. You are unable to take photos inside the museum and you need to pay a small fee for the audio tour which is worth listening to. It is a quiet and solemn place and certainly opens ones eyes to the tragedies experienced by those involved.
,,A moving experience,5.0,,"A good depiction of the occupation of Singapore and the POW's. I really enjoyed this. The audio was a good way to hear about everything, although it did not always match with the stations. A great look at history."
,,Small gem for history buffs,4.0,,"The Changi Chapel and Museum is not large, but the exhibits movingly tell the story of Singapore's occupation during World War II, mostly using photographs and items donated by survivors of the period."
,,Emotional and very insightful into POW'S in WW2,5.0,,This museum is very well set out and brings home how difficult it was for the POWS in the prison here. Take the audio tour as it explains so much about the suffering here under the Japanese. If you know of anyone who was kept in here there is a list of names and one of the staff was kind enough to photocopy the page which had my husbands uncle mentioned on it. Don't miss this as it's an eye opener in so many ways for Aussies especially.
,,Sombre,5.0,,"Wonderful piece of history. Easy to locate and get there on your own, however, as part of a tour, the tour guide was so informative. Really enjoyed this, my husband loves anything to do with either WW, so this was one of his highlights"
,,Remembrance,5.0,,Have visited the Chapel and Museum on each occasion we traveled to Singapore - a must see for people who remember the privations suffered by Allied service personnel during the WWII conflict - RIP to all who made the supreme sacrifice
,,Changi Chapel and Museum,5.0,,"Our group visited the Chapel and Museum on our last day in Singapore. As 3 of us were ex service personnel, it invoked sadness - man's inhumanity to man - and we left there visibly humbled but grateful to those who had suffered there, especially as my husband knew someone who had been imprisoned there."
,,Worth the visit,3.0,,"As a Australian the history of the Changi POW camps has interested me due to the number of Australians interned during WWII, therefore I found the visit interesting and informative. However the museum is small and the displays quite simple, but I would still recommend a visit."
,,This is a must see!,5.0,,"It is a very sad and sobering experience touring the Changi Chapel and Museum.
It tells of life in Singapore under the rule of the Japanese in the second world war.
You can pay for headphones to have an audio tour or you can walk around without free of charge.
The museum shop has some good books to buy and there is a restaurant there but it is a little pricey."
,,Reflective,4.0,,"If you are looking to see the POW camp it wont happen, the museum is a little U shaped building with so much history and information on the walls and the chapel is located in the middle of the U. We did an audio tour for $8.00 Singaporean per person, which helped you to understand a lot of the items on display than just seeing them there in their cases. There was so many written quotes from ex POW's and locals that survived the war and atrocities that were committed.
Totally worth the visit if you are interested in history."
,,We Will Remember Them,5.0,,"We went there by MRT & Bus No2, very easy to find with the bus stop outside the museum. My partner Sarah and I both being former British military spent a little over 2 hours reading all there was and looking at the exhibits. A very moving experience, which caused a lump in my throat several times. At the end there is a wall covered in military plaques and shields of the units that played a part in the defence of Singapore, my partner and I were disappointed to find that there was no plaque/shield dedicated to the British Military Nurses (QARANC) who played a major part in looking after wounded servicemen alongside the RAMC before the surrender to the Japanese."
,,Very moving,5.0,,"The audio tour is well done, although the numbers on the exhibits seemed not to be in numerical order. However, that was a minor. Loved hearing the stories from the survivors."
,,A Sober Experience for every Aussie,4.0,,"Very solemn very enlightening experience about a period of World War 2, that tells it in emotional stories of the inmates."
,,Moving experience,5.0,,"A story not often told is that of the fate of the little island of Singapore in World War II. This extraordinary little museum attempts to remedy that situation. The museum is free, but I highly recommend that you rent the audio for $8 SG dollars. You'll hear the stories of some of those who were involved at the time, in their own words. Fascinating and moving.

The highlight of the visit is the reproduction of the Changi Chapel. View the paintings on the wall closely. Though reproductions, they were reproduced by the man who first painted them in the 1940s.

It is very easy to get to from downtown on the #2 bus. Take it all the way until you see the signs. When you leave, take it back to where you came from."
,,Moving,5.0,,"If, like me, you are Australian and have a family history connecting you to Changi during WWII, then this is a very powerful place to visit. I went with my 12YO daughter and she was fine but would suggest you think twice before taking younger or impressionable kids. It's a little bit of a hike to get there on public transport but quite doable. Would be about 15 mins by taxi to airport. I highly recommend the audio tour."
,,History,5.0,,This is a very interesting place. There is not much to see as it is purely a museum. You need time to read the history of war to try and appreciate a liitle of what happened.
,,Memorable,5.0,,My husband's uncle had been in Changi so it meant a lot for him to visit. The museum was extremely interesting and very well set up. The chapel was a lovely way to commemorate those who had lived through the hardships of being POW's.
,,Worth the trip!,5.0,,We travelled from Somerset station and caught a train & a bus out to the museum which was easy to do. Arriving at the muesum we paid to do the audio headset tour which was good as it gave us the option to look at we wanted. It was very informative. The museum wasnt very busy when we arrived but then a tour bus arrived & the person doing the tour spoke very loudly throughtout the museum.
,,Very important place to visit,5.0,,"The Changi Museum has been very well put together. It is calm and quiet and the displays are very informative. It is worth paying a few dollars for the audio tour. It is very sad to hear the true stories of the POWs and the people of Singapore, all of whom suffered terribly. The museum staff have done an excellent job, it is definitely an important place to visit"
,,Great guide,4.0,,"I went on an organised tour.The guide was terrific as he gave us a short history of Singapore. as well as information about the culture of Singapore today.
My father was captured by the Japanese in Singapore and spent 3 1/2 years on the Burma railway, so I found the museum very informative and moving."
,,Serene,5.0,,Excellent audio guide with first hand accounts - very moving collection. Very easy to get to either by bus or by taxi. Really worth a visit!
,,For the Historian at heart,4.0,,"Changi Prison..... as it was called is out of the way a little, however if visited as part of a History and Military tour it is a worthwhile part of the war history of Singapore. Audio commentary is available, but a tour leader does it best. It is a very spiritual and moving place to visit especially if you originate from one of the countries who were involved in the action and subsequently had prisoners of war incarcerated in this prison. The buildings have been well preserved in their original state and are an experience in themselves to walk through. The chapel is worth the visit to light a candle and spend a little time reflecting on the prisoners who were there and what they had to endure."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Small but comprehensive collection that leads you through the horror of Changi during Japanese occupation. The audio guide is excellent and the first hand accounts are very moving. The museum showed the resilience and strength of the inmates. Very touching were the paper cranes gifted to the museum by Japanese school children.
,,Near to International Airport,5.0,,"A previous review mentioned this museum was a little out of the way. On our last day in Singapore we checked our luggage into the airport, then took a taxi to/from the Museum (about $11 each way). The entry fee was $8 p/p including the audio guide. The staff kindly offered to keep an eye on our cabin bags while we walked around the Museum. Along the way returning to the airport the taxi driver helpfully pointed out what remains of the original prison - a wall and some towers. The Museum curators have presented the history of Changi particularly well and this history includes the treatment of not only the POWs but also the civilians of Singapore. The shop has an interesting selection of books. One taxi driver recommended we also walk ""100m"" from the Museum to view a WWII cannon, however upon enquiry, it was 1km away and a replica and not looked after so I am glad we did not take up that suggestion!"
,,Very informative,4.0,,"Great museum, though a little out of the way. Interesting artefacts and the story was told well with the aid of the audio guide; even though mine kept blitzing out, the staff were very helpful with replacements. I guess I was sort of expecting to see a little more in terms of the actual prison site - but this was largely demolished, with only a few areas remaining which are part of the current prison. You can argue for the destruction/preservation of these monuments both ways, I guess."
,,Reflection,5.0,,With a grandfather who was a POW in Changi I found this site well worth the visit. A must for all Australians. Very helpful staff
,,History,5.0,,This was a very memorable and thought provoking visit to a place holding a lot of sombre and sad moments in time . Although a fitting tribute to those who suffered and fought for their survival and their countries
,,Changi POW museum- an emotional visit,5.0,,"I was reluctant to visit this place but my husband is interested in war history and also it was only 10 monites away from our hotel by a taxi. We went there first thing in the morning arrive just after its opening which is 10am. The admittance to the museum is free however renting audio guide cost us about $10 AUD for a device which is well worth to invest as it explains some of the exhibits. Taking photo is not permitted through out the museum except outdoor chapel. The place provides insight on how POW during the japanese occupation of Singapore lived in the prison. Also there are exhibit of some of the moving letters received by the POWs from their families back home during their imprisonment. Whether you are interested in the history or not, this is a place well worth a visit to appreciate to understand what local people and foreign soldiers had to go through to make Singapore has become today."
,,Lest We Forget,4.0,,"It's good to take a moment out of the hussel & bussel of modern Singapore, to reflect on the terrible experiences some people went through when Singapore fell to the Japanese Army in WW2. So many lives lost from many allied countries as well as local Singaporeans. I did the tour with the headphones and found the stories told at each exhibit very moving. The museum is a little bit out of town (close to the current Singaporean prisions0 but worth the taxi trip for anyone with family who fought in WW2 especially."
,,worth the effort,2.0,,"Despite the heat and long journey I found the effort worthwhile Well laid out,with original artefacts this place is a grim reminder of the terrors that were carried put in we3 I highly recommend this museum to anyone visiting singapore"
,,A moving tribute,4.0,,"Very informative and moving tribute A bit out of the way, we caught a taxi from the city, took 20 minutes Recommend getting the audio guide if you miss the hourly guided tours"
,,"Quiet place to visit, and have a drink or two",4.0,,"Beside the regular visit by WW2 relatives, this place is also a great place to chill out. A quiet place in Changi, you can have a beer or two, and good food menu. Price is a bit on the higher side for such location, but it's worth it. Would recommend some quiet time away from the loud and noisy places, if you wan to spend some quality time with your love one, and at the same time, understand a little bit of the WW2 history."
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"We used public transport, a combo of train and bus, to get to the museum which is in the suburbs. This took us past the original prison gates and the new prison. We took advantage of the audio commentary which supplied lots of background on each display and gave us a well rounded history. We only had just over an hour to spend but we were so pleased we took the time to do so. What struck me most, was on leaving the museum, firstly, the toilets were the least clean of any we accessed in 5 days of staying, (a bit disappointing) and there was a row of eucalyptus planted on the perimeter (made us proud to be Aussies). There is a cafe attached which seemed to attract many locals."
,,World War 2 Memories,5.0,,A good place to get people to relive the Jap Occupation and learn about the hardships the POWs and the ordinary people went through. It is a sobering reminder that war is not glorious even though it may be a necessary evil in human history.
,,worth a trip,5.0,,"the Chapel and the museum was very sad but worth a trip. the museum was presented well, and the staff were very friendly"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"We visited on an organised bus tour which allowed 45 mins, you really need at least an hour to read and take in all the history. Very moving and emotional visit, well worth the time and money"
,,An emotional visit!,4.0,,"A very informative and emotional visit in December 2012. Later we caught the bus to Changi Beach. Also emotional there, lots of history, some lovely walks lovely walks and a nearby market or restaurants to wind down!"
,,Changi Remembered...,4.0,,"A bit hard to find but even that is an adventure, Catching the MRT to Tanah Merah change to Bus no.2. When you get there its well worth the trip. The Museum is a little up the the road from the original and present Prison. Great afternoon listening to stories from a sad time in Singapores history you can do a tour or self guide with head sets. Caught the bus all the way back to the city, cheap sight seeing if you don't like trains and buses take a taxi.."
,,A sobering look at the cruelties of war time,5.0,,"If you're interested in WW2 history, you should make Changi Chapel and Museum a priority visit. I highly recommend the audio tour, but if you can get a docent-led tour that's even better. If you want to do some public bus sight seeing, take a ride on the #2 bus from Victoria Street all the way to the museum"
,,A moving experience in remembrance,5.0,,"It was very moving to walk quietly around the museum reading history and particularly the quotes from individuals who were there at the time. So much suffering and cruelty, so much strength, courage and caring. The exhibits are both sensitive and powerful.
There are audio tours available (8 Singapore dollars) and guided tours (12 dollars).
It is all on one level."
,,a little confronting,4.0,,As an Australian I had grown up with the stories of how Changi prison had impacted on the lives of Australian Soldiers. On vising this museum it really mad me realise just how poorly everybody living in Singapore at that time had been treated
,,A must,5.0,,Not to be missed for anyone with an interest in WW2 history. Travel there on bus number 2 for $1.60!
,,Interesting and moving,4.0,,"We spent to morning here, taking the metro and bus front the city, an easy journey. Singapore has a recent history that needs to be learned, it is not just a place for shping. We took a guided visit which was very interesting. I am partially sighted so both guided visits and audioguides are the best way to visit museums. Worth a visit if you want to learn about Singapore in the Second World War"
,,A time to remember and reflect,4.0,,Visited this Museum as part of a tour of the Island. Small but very well presented. Told the story and explained what happened in a non-sensational way. Lady at the shop was very helpful when I was searching for an item. Thoroughly recommended.
,,Highly emotional and educational visit - good for the soul,5.0,,"Had the opportunity to pay respects to the 'uncle I never knew' who died at sea after two years in Changi as a guest of the Japanese. The guide who takes you around the museum has such depth of knowledge about the battle for Singapore, the superb military tactics of the invaders and the sheer scale of the defeat for Percival and his defenders, but this does not distract you from the sheer depth of brutality of the guards and the amazing strength and stamina of the allied troops imprisoned there - an amazing story of the strength and victory, ultimately, of good over evil. We were close to tears at many stages of the guided visit."
,,A stroll in the afternoon.,4.0,,Took a stroll on the promenade and it was beautiful. The weather was very hot so we were glad of the outdoor seating to take a rest.
,,small but interesting,4.0,,I found this place very interesting with a good insight into how the war impacted singapore. well worth a visit with one of the tours.
,,Didn't know what to expect,4.0,,"But found this museum tastefully done. It packs a lot of information into the space allotted without falling into the trap of feeling cluttered. Just like so many other museums in Singapore (such as the Images of Singapore) the place is well thought out and spotlessly clean and done in a nice way.

Basically it is easy to pick up a tour that includes this (mine was with Viator) and you should be able to amble around it within an hour or so. There is a shop selling a range of books and not the usual sort of tacky souvenirs (a nice touch that) and some light refreshments were available.

The chapel itself is a small affair and a nice enough place to sit and ponder if that is your wont.

An attraction mainly of interest to UK, Australian, Indian/Pakistan and New Zealanders perhaps and then more generally to the armchair military historian. An excellent book on the subject of the fall of Singapore in WW2 is Singapore Burning. It doesn't actually cover the actual plight of the POW's but gives a great account of the Malaysian/Singapore campaign."
,,Very reverent place,5.0,,"A taxi is the easiest way to get there. $20 to $25 SGD. Some will wait for you if you want for a fee. We got a trip back with a taxi dropping others off, but if that hadn't happened, the #2 bus comes right back into town from out the front of the Museum. The Chapel and Museum are small but capture the history very well, You can walk alone, Audio tour or guided tour. It is free, you can leave a donation and a poppy at the chapel."
,,A moving experience,5.0,,My husband and I enjoyed this visit very much. It is unpretentious and very real. It was a terrible time for the P.o.w victims and their treatment was inhuman. I recommend you use the headset (about $8) for a more in depth experience. You can hear survivors recounts etc. we taxied from Clarke Quay because it was easier (cost $20 for half hour trip). Then the lady in souvenir shop rang us a taxi to get back. Entry is free.
,,Reflective,4.0,,"My grandfather was a prisoner in Changing before being transferred to his demise on the Thai Burma Railway. For me, this was a special place to visit but for people without a specific connection, I would say it is quite average."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"We did this tour as part of a group and were blessed to have our guide, Carol Dragon, give us the history of this war. Carol was amazing. I just loved listening to her stories and she had so much knowledge to share as she had a family member who was a POW. She knew her stuff and is a lovely person to boot. It was one of the best tours we had done in Singapore. Do yourself a favour and go, particularly if you are interested in war stories."
,,Well worth it - close to airport,4.0,,We went here from the city in a $26 taxi. The museum was very interesting and well worth the trip I would suggest for everyone to visit to here some interesting stories..
,,"Respectful, educational and interesting",5.0,,"After a simple ride on Singapore's public transport system (train to Tanah Merah then connecting to a bus) we made it to the museum with no fuss. The museum is in a quiet area behind the male and female prisons of Singapore. The exhibits were wonderfully informative about Australian POWs as well as the impact on Singaporean civilian life. A very informative, respectful and touching presentation of a dark period of time. There was a little wait for a public bus to take us back to Tanah Merah train station, but the stop was undercover, so not too hot."
,,Well worth a visit if you are at a loose end in Singapore,5.0,,"We visited this attraction as part of a bus tour, which was not the best way of doing it. There is far too much to see with too many people getting in the way as you move through.
Very moving especially if you are of the age where you are aware of losing family and friends during WW2.
We will go back there when next in Singapore, but next time we will take a taxi or public transport and try to time our visit for when there are no coach tours calling in.
Would I recommend it to others? Very definitely, yes."
,,Unpretentious and yet so moving,5.0,,"It is a small, simple, unpretentious museum, yet so well kept for a free admission place. There is just enough information to keep you focus and interested and the audio phone for 8 SGD is worth for the extra info and testimonies. It is simple but effective and terribly moving.

Not many taxis just passing by that area so avoid going on a rainy day or you might get stuck there for a while trying to call a cab.
There is a small car park and a restaurant open in evenings.
Plan between 1 and 1h30 visit."
,,Educational place,4.0,,A good place to learn about the past history of Japanese world war and it's really a good place for educational purpose because i learnt a lot there too.
,,recommended!,4.0,,the museum describe the world war ll and the quiet life of their ancestors. the path they had been through. this is the place for people look back the past and more preserve the present.
,,Thought provoking,4.0,,"I joined some colleagues for lunch next door and afterwards wondered through the museum, which is free! I'm no historian and I could have spent hours more reading the accounts of people effected by the Japanese take over during WWII. The receptionist was friendly and welcoming, the chapel, one inside and one out is quaint. Wish I had more time to spend there."
,,A moving experience,4.0,,A must if you have read any World War II stories about the Fall of Singapore or have a general interest in history. Well laid out Museum with interesting artifacts telling the story of very brave people. Standing in front of the Chapel was very moving.
,,a moving experience,4.0,,"A worthwhile visit if you are interested in history of the war,we went to pay tribute to lost family member and pay our respects,the atrocities are unimaginable and we came away feeling very humble and privileged to live at peace after what these men and woman sacrificed.There is a little wall of remembrance that you can leave a message in the hope that maybe someone elses famly will come along and perhaps have known our great Uncle.
It is a bit of a journey first by mtr then local bus but we chatted to such charming people on the way that it was worth it"
,,Aussies should visit - it's our history,4.0,,"This place really makes you think about what happened during this terrible time in history. The museum is very well set out and the audio guide tells the story very well. It really helps you understand the whole sad story, not only of the Australians, but of the local people and soldiers from all over Asia who suffered such atrocities in Singapore. Taxi fares are reasonably inexpensive in Singapore so it is well worth the trip to spend a couple of hours here."
,,Sad and important memorial to the war,5.0,,"The museum is well laid out and very very interesting, even for teenagers. The maps of how the war in the Pacific developed, and the exhibits of life in the POW camp are graphic but not too much to absorb."
,,Mans Inhumanity,4.0,,"The story portrayed here is of unnecessary suffering of Prisoners of War, both in the confines of the jail and those subjected to the horror of the Burma railway.
The museum treads lightly on the story it has to tell. It packs much information into its small area but none-the-less provides impact.
I have been to the Peace Park in Hiroshima and can only conclude in reflection that maybe the war did need to be brought to a rapid end."
,,A must visit,4.0,,This was a truly humbling & moving experience. The museum is well laid out & there is a good audio guide. Whilst going round you notice the respectful quietness of the visitors. Lest we Forget.
,,A moving account of Singapore during WW11,5.0,,"It seems somewhat banal to be rating an ""attraction"" that movingly retells the story of gthe horrors of life in Singapore under the short and brutal Japanese regime.
You rent headphones and listen to a poignant commentary while you look at various exhibits set out in a logical and easy to understand order. Whilst the POW's harrowing story is quite well known the appalling suffering of the local Singaporean population is not so well known and is well told with dignity in the Changi museum.
The exhibition finishes at a re-creation of the chapel built by the POWs and including some of the original items crafted by the prisioners. Relatives still come to visit and leave messages. All this makes it much more than a museum.
The CC&M is a pithy antedote to the hedonism of Singapore's eating and shopping culture if you want to get some perspective from a period of time that's still in the memory of elderly Singaporeans.
Note; the CC&M is not a big museum. If you're like us and I like to linger over every exhibit whilst my wife doesn't, it will take between 1 & 2 hours with a small cafe at the end where you can wait for those that take their time."
,,Was a little disappointing.,4.0,,"I understand the museum isn't on the actual site of the Changi prison, I was engrossed in the various stories and pictures around the museum, but felt something was missing, and am not exactly sure what it was. The museum is still worth a visit, especially if you have some direct links with Changi, Am looking forward to proposed developments including the actual Changi prison involved during WWII now that Singapore have built a new prison, maybe this will add the 'missing components' for me."
,,A glimpse of the past in Changi,5.0,,History and story on how the kindness of mankind exist in chaos and difficult time. Be prepare that the story of this real life events will moved you to tears.
,,A somber awakening,5.0,,"I went to Changi as my Parents were stationed in Singapore in the 60's They always raved about it so I thought I go and see the the history at this museum. While small we spent nearly three hours there its worth getting the audio tour and listening to all the vents, it shows me just how brave all the residents and service personnel were during the war out there. This is a must for anybody, it really opens your eyes and makes you appreciate more that they gave their tomorrows for our todays,"
,,Singapore 2014,4.0,,"Visited today 15th Mar 14, took the MRT to Tanah Merah, then No2 bus ($1.30), drops you right outside. Very interesting, but would defiantly recommend the $8 for the hand held recorder. Spend about 2hrs there, café at rear seemed dear. It’s a real shame that for what ever reason Singapore seems to have destroyed all evidence of their history. The museum attempts to take you back in time but unfortunately everything there is replica (building wise). Their web site gives good info. Properly a bit boring for kids, no interact things, just visual & reading."
,,Pay your respects,5.0,,We visited on a stop over in Singapore. 20 minute taxi journey from Singapore . Very moving history of the treatment of POWS. Small but we'll laid out and some exhibits very moving indeed. We'll worth a visit to pay your respects.
,,A slice of family history,4.0,,"My grandad was a POW here in the 2nd world war so visiting was a big deal. It was only to findthat the original prison has been replaced (as it seems has everything else in Singapore). The museum that is there now however is quaint and has some good stuff in it, telling the story from both sides of the story. Plus it was free to enter."
,,Small but interesting,4.0,,"This is not a very large museum, but it paints a very vivid picture of life in occupied Singapore. Well worth a visit."
,,Mocving Experience,5.0,,"Visited with my wife. Please note no photography is allowed in the chapel or museum.
The museum shows the horrors of those who suffered in the war with Japan especially those
who were incarcerated in Changi prison. The paintings and drawings shown by artists who
were prisoners are worth spending time viewing to help get a deeper understanding of what
the poor inmates endured.
As the museum and chapel are near the airport, taxi fares from the city centre are about $20 each way."
,,Very moving,5.0,,Spent several hours in the Chapel and Museum. The use of the audio system is well worth the S$8 as you hear accounts from people who where there
,,A bit disappointing,3.0,,"We chose to do the walking tour which took in the museum, the gun site and the beach where the chinese massacres were carried out. The museum was OK but strangely unatmospheric. Our guide talked far too much and left us too little time to actually look at the exhibits (which were mainly photographs wit explanatory details).

It is quite clear that the Singapore government is not interested in this bit of their history as the original murals in the prisoners chapel have not been seen for 8 years and are repotedly decaying and the gun site has been let to a bar!

Tru its not the proudest moment in British military history but it should be treated better than this."
,,History,4.0,,"tell it how it was under the Japanese , in a word , disgusting , even thats not a strong enough word .
Brave defenders with Hopeless British Generals , what a waste .
The Fantastically brave locals who were massacred in their 1000 s , especially the Chinese . the English treated them like Rubbish before 1941 , but the locals showed their Bravery to help Prisoners when possible on threat of death & Torture. Go there ."
,,should be visited but very moving,4.0,,"We went as we thought we should.Glad we did but it is very disturbing and moving. However,important to remember and not pretend such things did not happen.All school children
should be taken there. Easy to get to by bus or metro.The indomitability of the human spirit is uplifting and overwhelming."
,,never forgotten,5.0,,"A moving and serene experience. Definitely take the audio tour, the stories are harrowing and uplifting and so so moving. The museum staff were very helpful, and also are encouraging students to understand about what happened during the war so that it is never forgotten. Easy to get to by taxi or bus."
,,Harrowing as expected,3.0,,"Lots of information to learn to better undersand the situation in Singapore during WWII. Took a guided tour which was a nice way of doing it. Others in my group were disappointed with how little was original as opposed to replicas/relocations, however, I found that I learnt a lot and it was quite overwhelming as it was and the message was conveyed."
,,very moving,5.0,,"It was a very moving experience, I was almost moved to tears hearing of the plight of all the prisoners of war and seeing the relics from their time. The letters to their loved ones at home and the primitive tools they made to make their lives a little easier. A very tragic time in the history of Singapore. I was most interested to hear that the prisoners in those days were mostly Australians and British.Very sad"
,,A must see !,5.0,,"A moving tribute to those souls who endured hell from their opressors, a lot to see and take in but time is the least we can give to find the truth, very moving, our younger people need to know what happened during this dark period of time."
,,Worth a look,4.0,,"We enjoyed our visit & felt like we got a new perspective on the Japanese occupation of Singapore. Beware the additional $8.00 charge if you use the taxi on standby at the museum. There was no fee mentioned when we agreed to use the service but once we got to the airport, suddenly it cost more than the meter..."
,,A moving experience,5.0,,"I was travelling with my Father who was in Singapore in the forces in the late 50’s. Much has changed (obviously) since then, but he wanted to see Changi jail which was near to where he was stationed so we came here. It is a fabulous and very moving display of information and artefacts that capture the period of the Japanese occupation and thereafter in great detail. Its a little out of ’town’ but well worth it"
,,A moving experience,5.0,,Every visitor to Singapore should visit as they will learn so much about the hardships and bravery of the Singaporeans during WWII. We thought we'd be there for around an hour but ended up spending two and a half hours which seemed to fly past. The audio tour is excellent and the exhibits are well put together and some are extremely poignant. It is a truly humbling and moving experience.
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,Check out the culture and history of Singapore and learn more about the people and their civilisation - worth a trip whilst in Singapore for people of all ages.
,,A long trip to get there,3.0,,"took about 1.15 on public transport to get there, and managed to get a taxi back. its a long way out from the centre of singapore and we did enjoy the audio tour, but it is very small, and there are few original artefacts. the chapel is also a replica."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,The memorial is well laid out and contains many exhibits. I think 3 hours is a minimum visit. The chapel and museum is not on the exact site but still worth a visit. It's a short taxi ride from the airport for a few hours diversion while waited for our evening flight. The taxi driver threw a tantrum when we said we weren't going to the city as its about half the fare. The staff will call a taxi for the return trip.
,,Part of History,5.0,,A well presented review of a dramatic time in Singapore's recent history. Reflects the experience of both the people and armed forces through the Japanese occupation.
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,"We found the museum had so much information there, it was set out really well, had pictures, lots of stories, maps, definitely worth a visit, it's free but we gave a donation in tin, staff friendly and very helpful. We joined a tour there, but thinking back we could have just stayed there."
,,A glimpse of history,5.0,,"If you like history and would like to just have a glimpse of what it was like for the POWs during the Japanese Occupation then you should come else you can probably give it is a miss. It is very small and you do feel a sense melancholy but it is so far away from town. It's not really done up to be a grand museum or sorts, just a small chapel and museum to reflect about Singapore history thats all."
,,Moving,5.0,,My partner and I visited Changi along with other places on a full day tour of the island. Although a very sad reminder of the past it was a very enlightening experience to know what the prisoners went through to keep their hopes and spirits up. Such a well presented array of information and artifacts - a credit to all involved.
,,"""We will Not forget them""",5.0,,"If you have the slightest interest in the history of Singapore, and/or the WWII period, then a visit to the Changi Chapel and museum is ""A MUST"". The museum is very well laid out and extremely informative about this gruesome period of recent history. There were quite a few visitors when we were there, none of them Japanese ! It Might be a good idea for todays Japanese to understand what yesterdays Japanese perpetrated upon their fellow human beings, within the living memory of the few remaining that are still alive to tell the sorry tale !

If you are rightly moved by what you see at this commendable museum, I would suggest that you pop onto the MRT subway system and head out on the Red North/South Line to Kranji and pay your respects to the thousands of Allied/Commonwealth war dead that lie in the beautifully maintained ""Commonwealth War Graves Commission"" Cemetery at Kranji. It is only an easy ten minute stroll from the MRT station. Andrew Bruce, Dumfries, Scotland, U.K."
,,Good,5.0,,"Well laid out, good informative guide, small enough that you can see all in one morning. Would advise going"
,,Should not be forgotten,5.0,,"I learnt a great deal about this terrible period of history. I found it easy to follow the clearly set out and interesting information which outlined Singapore before the war, the surrender, conflict and rehabilitation. There were great artefacts and photos to enhance the experience. For adults who want to explore this period of history it is a must. We got there by train and bus but there needs to be better signposting so that tourists know when to get off the bus!"
,,Lest We Forget,5.0,,Well worth visiting to remember the extraordinary men and women who passed through Changi camp. The audio service is very useful too.
,,A must see,5.0,,I always visit Changi when in Singapore. A stark reminder of what man is capable of. One develops a greater respect for those who passed through these doors.
,,If you like WWII stories,4.0,,"I visited this place twice within a span of 3 days. I have this great appetite for war stories and this place appeared to be a reservoir for such stories. Looking through the names of prisoners who served as chaplains of the chapel during their internment, I came across a few familiar names; names that I came across from my other readings. I enjoyed looking at old B/W photographs of war years and reading the commentaries. I felt I had learned so much during these two visits."
,,THOUGHT PROVOKING - EXCELLENT,5.0,,In size this museum seems quite small but it took hours to go round. We did the audio tour and also stopped to read and look at all the exhibits and it is just so interesting. I think that all school children should see this in order to appreciate what their forebare went through as it really brings things home. A must do for any visitor to Singapore.
,,Changi,1.0,,"Very disappointed lack of history presented as an Australian, only told what they want us to know, especially by tour guide, need to be able to read, hear and see the facts"
,,not bad idea,2.0,,"visit once time there with my friends, place we found just oky,place is rely we dont understand for what,,,,,better we need much information next others"
,,Very emotional experience,5.0,,"Every Australian needs to pay their respects here when visiting Singapore. I have seen many places in the world but I was moved to tears on this tour. Words cannot describe the overwhelming pride and sadness for our soldiers who endured the horrific conditions as a POW here.
Interestingly, we had the audio tour, but I was more captivated by listening to one of the private tours which was held for trainee teachers on the day we visited.
Allow plenty of time for this visit. Give yourself time to absorb the information you hear...it is unforgettable."
,,Extremely moving,5.0,,The museum is an absolute must for any Australian visiting Singapore. It is very well done and the walking tour really captures what happened during the war.
,,Moving experience,5.0,,"I have visited this museum a few times over the past many years. The exhibition does change over time, and thus was worth re-visiting even if one has visited it in the past. For those interested in history the museum gives a good insight into the treatment of both internees and the civilian population during the war years. The museum itself is small, and contains many artefacts from the war period. It takes about 1-2 hours to absorb the exhibitions. It is located a distance from the city centre. The best way to get there is to take an MRT on the easr west line to Tanah Merah. Then walk out of the station to the bus stop and take a number 2 bus to the museum. It was a 15-20 minute trip by bus for me. If uncertain, just ask the driver or fellow passengers when to get off. They are very obliging and helpful. The bus stop is almost directly opposite the entrance to the museum. It is all very easy. You should allow at least a full morning or afternoon given the travel times by MRT, bus and time at the museum itself. It is well worth it, particularly to Australians given the prisoners of war interned there in WW2."
,,"Go here, not the departure lounge!",4.0,,"We made a deliberate plan to go here in our final hours in the country. We got to the airport, put our bags in 'storage' and came out again and took a taxi to Changi Chapel. You do need several hours and the purchase of the electronic info was worthwhile.
The stories are interesting and the message boards are very moving - it is sad that nothing is original, but the story behind that is part of Singapore too. Essential viewing for any student of history, since the story of Singapore has worldwide significance."
,,Let us not forget,4.0,,As well as a record of what happened in Singapore in WW2 if you do a tour you will share the stories of civilian citizens. The chapel is a replica of the chapel now in Canberra Australia. There is also a restaurant called the long house that serves tasty meals and drinks. Put this on your list as a must visit.
,,A very touching experience.,5.0,,"To see, read and walk through this place is such a touching ans sad experience, but so worthwhile. It is a must do on any Singapore itinerary. As well as the Kranji War Cemetary."
,,A poignant visit,4.0,,This is well worth a visit though the chapel is not the original one. The individual stories are very moving.
,,"Disturbing, moving, inspirational",5.0,,If you have a relative who was a POW this is a must. If you don't then it's still very highly recommended.
,,MUST VISIT HERE,4.0,,"Although the Chapel is not the original, it is still a very worthwhile place to visit. It illustrates very well what the inmates experienced and endured. The Chapel murals stopped me in my tracks. There is a place for contemplation and reflection for those who wish. In summary, this place is a must see for all who have an interest in what happened here in those years."
,,Somber,5.0,,Whilst this is off the beaten tourist trap it is well worth the effort to visit this historical place (especially if you have link from one of the many countries who have a link to Changi Prison during WWII).
,,Lest We Forget,5.0,,"As the years pass there is a risk that the sacrifice made by over 5,000 Australians
who died during or after the Fall of Singapore
could become forgotten.
Even if you do not have a personal connection with the Pacific War the Chapel
it is worth a visit.
Lest We Forget"
,,I would really like to give this a higher rating,2.0,,"As an Australian visiting Singapore, apart from enjoying Singapore for all it offers tourists, I wanted to remember those that suffered so much in times past and was looking forward to my visit to the Changi Chapel and Museum. Whilst it is a place were you can certainly reflect and contemplate times past, although it pains me to say it, this place to me seems somewhat of an opportunity lost and I left not really feeling terribly engaged or feeling as if I had gained a real appreciation of what the years in the 1940's must have been like under Japanese rule. In comparison, visiting Hiroshima earlier this year, viewing peace park, the dome and the museum I really did feel as if I had an appreciation of what Hiroshima was like after the bombing. I didn't go the Changi Chapel expecting theme park rides or a hoot or a day, I was looking to learn about life in the 1940's and feel connected in someway - unfortunately the place did not do it for me. The museum is very static and to me un-engaging. I tend to agree with the views expressed in some other reviews, that being that perhaps the museum is intent on not offending anyone but for me I didn't come away feeling much at all."
,,A 'must-see' for all ages over 10.,5.0,,"Moving & sometimes harrowing experience but a must-see, to remain aware such tyranny should never happen again. Having an interest in war history I had read about much of what I saw today but it was still hard to assess the reality of it in front of me. I was hoping to see one of the Quilts the female internees sewed that I'd read of. To know the story behind the quilts & then see one in the flesh was indescribable. Such workmanship with few supplies. Well laid-out, small museum. Allow 3hrs if history buff & you like to read all descriptions. Make sure you read the poem 'The Corporal and His Pal'--Anon.
There is an inscription on one item which says it all---I gave up Tomorrow, for you to have Today.
Was disappointed there wasn't much about the removal of the original Chapel to Duntroon, Canberra, which is also a 'must-see' but what is disappointment measured against such suffering?
Public transport is easy to get there & cheap-- Circle Line MRT to Payar Lebar, change to east/west line to Tanah Merah, then No 2 bus outside station(signposted in lower concourse) to Changi Chapel."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Well worth a visit, to see and understand how Singapore was affected from the Japanesse envisage! Although take some tissues with you!"
,,Informative and respectful,5.0,,"Just to get these out of the way:
1. Most locals don't even know it exists. Pretty under-advertised and may not even appear on the standard tourist itinerary
2. It is FAR away from anything, unless you are staying at one of the hotels near Changi area
3. The place does have operating hours. Duh! Please check before deciding to just appear there.
4. This place don't subscribe to Mel Gibson's type of gory re-creation (re: ""Passion of Christ""). It is a simple and respectful way of remembering an important part of Singapore history. Not necessarily taking sides of the war

I decided to just do it myself, without the explanations from the ear phones or the guides. Lots of information to read at each exhibit, and pretty sufficient. Take your time, and spend a good 2 hours.

Left the place with much added admiration of those who went through the war."
,,worth a look,5.0,,"Small but effective display of testimony from the prisoners, and some photos and art works. Items from the period too.
Chapel is a reconstruction but the emtion is there in the prisoners' words.

Catch a taxi. You can call one from the gift shop to get you back into town"
,,Harrowing but don't rush,5.0,,The Changi Chapel and Museum is a must-see for visitors to Singapore. Catch the MRT to Tanah Merah and the #2 bus for the museum. Entry is free but hire the audio tour headset to experience the full impact of the the museum and expect to be there for a good two hours. The gift shop has an interesting selection of books and memorabilia.
,,really far to get to by public transport,3.0,,There is no entrance fee but if you want to hire ear phones for commentary then pay $8 SGD. There are plenty of things to read though so no need to hire these really. It is really far to get to. I was staying in Orchard rd and had to take train and then switch to a 20-25 mins bus ride. All up including waiting time took 1.5hrs one way.
,,back in time,5.0,,"Although the museum is not on the site of the prison; as it is still the main prison it is just down the road, you drive pass and if you are on the top deck of a bus you can see one of the original watch towers. We felt a sense of calm in the museum which is well organised and you can have radio recorded guides which are very informative and easy to use. There are displays covering the time the Japanese were in charge / rule Singapore and it brought to mind the fact that it was the people of Singapore who suffered the most during that time. Australians were the highest single body captured and it was the British who released the prisoners.
Ir would be a good idea to take children to the site to help bring history to life for them but overall it is a suitable visit for everyone."
,,A walk on the classical Singapore,4.0,,"Changi Chapel and Museum is near the Changi prison and connected by bus service 29 from Tampines Bus Interchange. Its a small museum with entry free. You may get a optional audio tour for S$8 and its worth it.
The main exhibits are artifacts and photographs of the memories of World War II with respect to the battle of Singapore, Surrender of British troops in Singapore, Hardship faced by Singapore peoples during Japanese regime. Its a must watch place if you are fan of history."
,,A Reminder of the Past,5.0,,Every visitor to Singapore should visit the Chapel and Museum. The stories of the suffering and courage of the people who were subjected to the cruelty of the Japanese oppressors was awe inspiring. Tears flow but it is a visit not to be missed.
,,Respectful,5.0,,This is a fabulous memorial to a very tragic time in our history. The detail and information is very well presented and the headsets a great idea and commentary timed to suit your own pace. Lots of genuine articles and relics on display.
,,Moving experience,4.0,,I knew very little about Changi and in particular how much the local Chinse population suffered during the Japanese occuppation. I would recommend you get the audio guide which is very informative as it has a number of interviews with both the locals and prisoners of war. The museum gives you an excellent insight into this traumatic time in history.
,,A little of Singapore's past,5.0,,"I took my family here last march. For what it is Singapore has done an excellent job to provide you with some insight into the time and lives of those who lived in and durning the time of the occupation. I personally recommend taking the audio tour as it give you that little extra detail.

We'll work a trip"
,,Remembrance of WW2 Allied Prisoners,5.0,,Thousands of allied prisoners were interned in Singapore Changi Prison during WW2 by the Japanese after their victory and occupation of Singapore for several years. An excellent reminder and remembrance of the suffering at that time.
,,Definitely check it out,4.0,,"I came here on a whim by myself and I'm glad I went. There wasnt much people on the day, so it was quiet, and the place was smaller than I anticipated. But it was overwhelming with stories that help you understand what life was like in Singapore in the 40's and the stores immediately arrest you with their personal touches

A must if you think you are a cultured person"
,,Well worth a trip,4.0,,The buildings not the original building that was used in the war but it's got a lot stuff from the period and the chapel real interesting
,,Moving experience,4.0,,"I visited here as part of a tour group. It was a very moving experience, there are lots of quotes and photos from survivors and the departed. I was a bit disappointed that what we saw was a recreation rather than how it was."
,,Worth a Look,4.0,,"For all the history and war buffs out there this place is worth a look. Has lots of scenes, letters and history in the museum; just to see how the war affected Singapore and it's people."
,,Get to know Singapore's historu,4.0,,"A museum dedicated to Singapore's history during the Second World War. Take your time to browse through the magnificent wall paintings which were painstaking recreated from the originals by Bombardier Stanley Warren. The museum serves as an important educational institution and resource centre for all Singaporeans. No wonder Singaporeans are so proud of their country! If time permits, one should also take a ""seat"" at the chapel to get a feel of the place and think of the events that had taken place during the Japanese occupation unrevealing in one's mind!

To end the trip, there's a restaurant just next to the chapel where one could feast on good Western food. In order to get a taste on the various food, its advisable to order different food and share them."
,,Recreated but catches the atmosphere,5.0,,"Having read The Naked Island years ago and many other books about the fall of Singapore since, I was keen to visit Changi Prison. This museum is not the old prison but so thoughtfully laid out that you still get the feeling of what it was like not only to be a POW but also how the local people suffered during the Japanese occupation. We paid to take the guided tour and I would recommend doing so - our guide was so knowledgeable and informative. Afterwards we had time to wander around alone.

Well worth a visit."
,,Moving experience,5.0,,Well displayed and touching stories. The cafe next door is a must visit to refresh after the museum. They serve the best fries in Singapore
,,Go There and feel humbled,5.0,,If you have a slight interest in the history of Singapore then go and experience this museum. You will be humbled by the stories of the survivors of the Japanese occupation.
,,Collection & Recollections are outstanding,4.0,,"We shared an audio guide (it's free to enter so had no problem with paying for the audioguide). It provides a lot of extra information and contect for each display. Without the audio guide you would still have plenty of information to take in. Noticed there is also a research/library section near the gift shop with even more information/articles/books. Taxi there is easy and we took the bus back to right outside our hotel in Chinatown, bus also goes through Orchard Rd, just takes a while. Do not miss out on visiting."
,,Moving and emotional,4.0,,"They have done a fabulous job with this memorial between the words, the pictures and the sounds you get a feel for what happened and what people do to one another"
,,good,4.0,,"The museum was of a very high standard , showing the privations suffered there by many prisoners in the second world war ."
,,A Japanese Concentration Camp Site in Singapore,5.0,,"I ""collect"" these memorial sites wherever I go. I always want to remember the victims of these holocausts, wherever. Man needs constant reminding of his incredible cruelty to his fellow man.
I was moved greatly by the excellent reconstruction, preservation and conservation of this site and it's very good educational role."
,,"Good experience but more younger visitors needed, please",4.0,,"Singapore has a wealth of places that are worth visiting for their historical links to events that happened during WW2. Unfortunately, most of them aren't that publicised, so the museum and chapel at least represents one of the more well-known sites. While it's neither the original building nor does it stand on the original site, it does offer a place to reflect on and learn about the many sacrifices experienced by both the local residents and defenders of the island during the war years.

It's rather out of the way but not too difficult to get to via public transport. On the weekday I visited, the small car park was full, so it does get a good stream of visitors, often from overseas. It's also an important place for locals to visit and appreciate as well. And with much of the war generation advancing rapidly in age, there's plenty that the younger generations could learn here."
,,Weel Worth the Visit,5.0,,Whether you are a WWII buff or not this is well worth the visit! It provides just another great view into the very storied history of Singapore and the role that it has played throughout the ages. This was a great afternoon.
,,Hyped up,3.0,,"I have to be honest - I was a bit disappointed with this. There's so much hype about it, but the museum part was mainly just quotes presented in conjuction with a bit of information. Basically all of the items in there were replicas, including the whole chapel. It was interesting reading though, I learnt a lot."
,,Very moving,5.0,,Second time we have been. The museum and chapel are very well displayed and the memorabilia very emotional. Beautifully layer out. The cafe is still not very good and the loos poor.
,,Excellent,5.0,,Very moving but need to show some of the more horrible things that the Japanese did. The letters are hard hitting some will make you cry. Well worth the visit we liked the fact that children in Singapore have to visit this every year as a reminder of the war and that it should not be forgotten
,,Changi Chapel and Museum,4.0,,"A visit here is likely to leave you feeling conflicted. It is interesting from a historical perspective, with a sense of anger at the British mismanagement that led to the surrender of thousands of young Allied soldiers, but also sadness for the terrible barbarity and suffering inflicted upon these young men."
,,Interesting If You're Into Military History,4.0,,"I'm really into military history, especially WWII Pacific Theater and while this museum doesn't really talk about the Battle of Singapore, it deals more with the aftermath...with the tales of the soldiers after capture by the Japanese. Here, you get to see and learn about their trials and hardships during their years of captivity. When you go to the chapel, you will see handwritten notes from veterans and loved ones to these valiant men who served in the defense of Singapore."
,,Worth seeing,4.0,,All Brits and Australians should visit this museum and read the info it is a must. We need to learn by our past and think about where the world is heading taking into account a particular religion.
,,Memory lane,4.0,,"An excellent small museum commemorating Singapores role in WWII. Exhibition is very well done, text is easy to read and very evocative and you leave with a real understanding of the impact of the Japanese invasion. Enjoyed our visit!"
,,Memorable,5.0,,"A truly memorable place to visit. The exhibits there are so interesting, & upsetting when you realise what these prisoners went through. The stories written by former P.O.W are so detailed. A really nice place to go & see, remember & honor past heroes."
,,History lesson.,4.0,,I found out so much from my visit there. I never realized the actual chapel is now in Canberra. Well worth a visit.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,This museum may be small but it packs a lot of very interesting information in to it. We took the audio sets and they were well worth the money. Took us two hours to do the tour and is very worthwhile. Goes really in to depth about the pain and suffering of the Singaporeans and their fellow countrymen in the hands of the enemy.
,,Changi Chapel,5.0,,I last visited the chapel in 1993 and was very impressed with the work that has gone into making my latest visit such a worthwhile experience. My only regret was that the tour was not really long enough. I could have spent a bit more time there. Altogether it was a very emotional experience.
,,Short but poignant,5.0,,"The museum isn't big, nor is it easy to get to, but if you're interested in some of the region's history it's well worth a visit.

It's free, so no one should complain that they have to pay to get out to it. It's not big - it would take a maximum of two hours to get through - but it's full of information on everything from the initial Japanese invasion to the eventual surrender. Lots of pictures & artefacts from the all-too-recent era make it a fascinating place to go see if you have a spare few hours."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"This small museum is free unless you want the audio guide - we didn't need it and were happy to read the captions. The history is very interesting and we enjoyed it. There is a restaurant on site and a shop.

The journey by public transport is worth doing too as you go past the new prison - we took MRT to Tanah Merah station and then bus 2 to the museum. It is all signed and easy to do. Just have exact change for the bus (SGD1.30 per person) or ensure you have a smart card with money on it."
,,well worth a visit,5.0,,This Museum is understated in the tourism info' and a must see for anyone with any interest in Singapore's turbulent past. The Museum provides a vivid account of war time under Japanese occupation from the POW perspective. The Museum contains a many relics from the era. For a small fee an automated/ guided audio tour is available. Allow at least one hour. Getting there is easy. Just catch a No.2 bus to Changi Village from any bus stop near Bugis MRT (same side as Bugis Markets). The bus goes right past the museum about 6 stops from Changi Village.
,,Disappointing memorial to ones that we should never forget,2.0,,"Was really looking forward to visiting Changi but was left disappointed at how this was presented. There is nothing left of the old Changi Prision and the chance to see the conditions at first hand at how one people mistreated another. The museum is a mish mash of letters, photographs, drawings and artifacts which to my mind do not truly tell the story of Changi Prison and the suffering that was inflicted there."
,,An interesting part of Singapore's history.,4.0,,It is worth a trip to this museum if you are keen on World War Two history as you get a brief insight as to what was happening in Singapore at this time. I think I have learnt something new.
,,"A ""Must do in Singapore""",5.0,,"This was the third time I had visited Singapore and had resisted going here, not sure why, but wow it was a great experience, very humbling and a brilliant insight into how life was during the Japanese occupation......spine tingling stuff, make sure you pay the SGD6 to have the handset so you can listen to the stories whilst you wander around......."
,,Moving,5.0,,Changii chapel is part of the changi jail complex. It is moving and sad to see how the prisoners of war were treated. A must see visit that all teenagers and young people should see.
,,Really sad.,4.0,,"Although most of it is not original, it still reminds you of the atrocities that took place. It was particularly sad to read the messages on the notice board from family members today in memory of the internees."
,,Awe inspiring,5.0,,Amazing experience to see how the prisoners of war lived and how they got through their ordeal - a must visit
,,Full of history,5.0,,This is a must do visit. Full of history and a time to remember the events from the war. This does take you back in time and does get you thinking about how important the history is.
,,Moving experience,5.0,,To read the memories of people and also the dedications to the fallen or those who suffered was quite emotional. Very well done and a poignant visit.
,,Thought provoking.,5.0,,"For anyone who had a relative in Changi, this is a must. It gave me insight into my great Grandfather's life for the 2 years he was captive. Sadly, no photos allowed. I was told photos are on the website, but the website is down for the time being."
,,Changi WWII War Trail and Museum Tour,5.0,,One of the most informative tours and guides around (Helena). The details and insights made you feel for the inmates and locals during those difficult years. Looking forward to doing another tour with Helena.
,,Lest we Forget,4.0,,"Well worth a visit. A sobering place to experience - informative, evocative displays - photos and artefacts, along with written text, tell the story of the tragedies of WW2 in Singapore.
You'd need at least 90 minutes to view all display cases and reflect on what you are learning."
,,Terrible,1.0,,Arrived at 1626 advised closing at 1700. Lady at desk then told us we should use toilet at restaurant upon returning she had closed museum as last visitor at 1630 which she failed to tell us. Probably wanted to go home. A wasted visit very disappointing.
,,Changi - a moving experience,4.0,,"The visit was an organised trip, and was very moving telling you the story of the ordeal of the Allied troops and Singaporeans - a sobering experience, but worth the time spent there - could have spent longer."
,,Very moving.,5.0,,"This museum and chapel really bring home the dreadful experiences suffered in Singapore under Japanese rule. It also tells of the amazing resilience which humans are capable of.
I felt sad but also inspired.
I would recommend using a Singapore original walking tour. A coach picks you up from Pasir Ris MRT and takes you to the museum and other sites such as the battery and scene of the beqch massacre of chinese men.
The guide can give you a wealth of additional information"
,,Very poignant,5.0,,"We took the advice in a guide book and travelled here by public transport - the MRT to Tanah Mareh then the number 2 bus to outside the museum (have the correct change! Currently $3.60 for the bus for 2 persons)
The museum is out of town but is well worth a visit. It is free to enter but only $8 for the audio tour ($12 for a couple to share). The chapel is very serene and the displays simplistic but poignant.
Overall very thought provoking and pleasantly uncommercial.
Well worth a visit."
,,In Memorium,5.0,,We visited the site on a bus tour and we had limited time there but it was enough to sense the mood of the museum and the trials endured at the time of the second world war at the hands of the Japanese.
,,A sobering experience,5.0,,Take the time to visit the Changi Museum. The history is very interesting and the video interviews are worth spending the time to view. It is a quick and inexpensive trip by taxi. We caught the bus back into the city which was also an easy trip.
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"Visited here many years ago before it was renovated. I enjoyed it much more the first time and think its too commercialised now, and lost its emotional feel. Still good value for money, and perhaps if I hadnt seen it in its original state, I would have appreciated it more."
,,Moving,5.0,,Worth the time taken to get there by public transport. I had hoped that some of the original camp existed.
,,A lesson in history,4.0,,"Singapore nationals pride themselves on ""doing it right"". The history here is worth the time to read and take in a history lesson. You drive alongside the infamous prison and you will be totally amazed at the size of the place. BUT. In behind those walls are manufacturing plants. When the naughty people have to go for a little holiday then they are set to work in industry. A fantastic initiative. Digressing but SG has LESS than 2% re offence rate. Back to the subject. When you have completed your visit there is quite a variety of books to purchase on the history in WW! and WW2."
,,Love it!,4.0,,Love the history and story behind Changi Chapel during the WWII. Enjoy the peace and quietness at the chapel.
,,The Chapel as it was in 1971.,5.0,,"My husband was stationed at RAF Changi and we went to see the original chapel which was in the basement of one of the barrack blocks in 1971. During the occupation the whole of the Changi peninsular (which was a British military bases) was used by the Japanese as a POW Camp.
Some of the soldiers residential blocks were used as hospitals for various diseases requiring quarentine. The one housing the chapel was the Dysentery Block. The soldier who panted the ""Changi Murals"" originally, did so as a thank you to God for his recovery from his severe case of dysentery.
While he was ill he could often hear singing and wanted to know where it was coming from. He followed the singing until he found himself in the Chapel in the basement of the hospital block where he had been so ill. Paint of course was not available, so he and others gathered whatever they could to make colour, most of which was from plant dye and powdered rocks.

When the murals were found -many years later- during repairs to the building it took a lot of persuading to get the soldier to come back and restore his murals and doing so must have brought back many memories hard to deal with. It is my understanding that the Dulux paint company mixed the paints to the colours of the original murals.

,,informative and interesting,4.0,,Although we did cheat and take a cab to get here it is fairly accessible by public transport which we did on the way back. The museum is free although there is a charge for the audio guides - take one they provide a little more information than just reading the signs and are worth the $8 charge. You move round the museum based on the beginning of Changi through WW2 and the Japanese Occupation through to the end of the war. Each section provides a different insight into life at the prison and provides many thought provoking moments. Make sure you take your time to absorb the information provided. I now plan on learning and finding out more about this period of WW2 that I know relatively little in comparison to the European aspect of the war.
,,Moving....,5.0,,"It is easy to get to it using the #2 or #29 bus or use the MRT to Tampines MRT and a $6-8 taxi ride.

It is very moving. Entry is free but use the $8 self-guided audio tour. It is wonderfully understated, non commercial, educational and moving. Singapore has nailed it. The book store is well stocked and the staff well informed and helpful.

There are many handwritten notes too, take time to read them. It is a must do."
,,Changi,3.0,,"A 50 min bus trip from CBD gets one to Changi. Easiest to take a tour (cost around S$35pp) as public transport does not go direct and there are a couple of changes required, the last being a taxi ride. Changi museum is well done and modern in it's presentation. The Chapel is thought provoking and engenders respect if you think about it's history. It takes around 45 mins to see it all a reasonable pace.
Our tour also took in a Shopping Cnt and township for Malay Moslems where there are touristy nick nacks to buy."
,,Informative and Respectful,4.0,,We visited this location as part of a tour and had around 50 minutes to go through the Chapel and museum. A little bit more time would have been great. So much to read and understand about the wartime history of Singapore.
,,Very interesting,5.0,,This museum exhibits a number of items gathered from the 1940s occupation of Singapore by Japanese forces. The material is handled sensitively and presented in a clear and informative way. The museum also incorporates parts of the old Changi Prison's chapel. This is a must for those interested in WW2 history.
,,For his Father,5.0,,My husband 's Father was a Japanese prisoner of war was a poignant day and very interesting even for those families who were not affected by this historical tragedy.
,,A must do,5.0,,"This was number one on my Singapore to-do list, as my father was a POW here in WW2. It is only a small museum, but is very poignant. It is free to enter and I don't think you need the audio guide, as everything is well labelled. I enjoyed all parts of the exhibit, but you need to read a lot of information to truly appreciate it.
Definitely a place worth visiting, even if you don't have a personal connection. We need to remember those who suffered in war, not just the service men and women, but the civilian population as well. Changi Museum does this very well."
,,xu,5.0,,"great displays , tells the story of the prisoner of war held here during the japanese occupation of singapore , really absorbing"
,,Make the effort to visit Changi Chapel and Museum,5.0,,"The Changi Chapel and Museum is not on the main tourist trail of Singapore, however if you harbour an interest in the history World War 2 and Singapore’s struggles during the dark years between 1942-45 then this makes a perfect stop to learn more about the history and take time to reflect.

The Changi Chapel and Museum is dedicated to the prisoners of war and civilian internees who were incarcerated in Singapore during World War 2. The museum honours the memory of many who faced adversity with spirit and commitment. It inspires visitors with stories of courage and sacrifice through letters, photographs, drawings and personal artefacts. There are now new galleries, which trace the history of Changi from a rustic village to its role in the defence of Singapore. As well as a replica of the Changi Chapel in the courtyard, which shows us, a good example of simple churches/chapels built by internees as places of comfort.

The museum is open daily from 9.30am-5.00pm with last admissions at 4.30pm. Price is free, but it is $8.00 to rent a headset in a selection of languages, which help guide you around the museum. This isn’t a big museum and will probably only take you only an hour to cover. Please note no photos are allowed inside.

The Changi Chapel and Museum is quite a distance out of the city, the best way to get there is either by taxi which would take approximately 25 minutes and cost $25.00 on way or alternatively take the MRT along the green line to Tanah Merah $3.90 return, then get on bus number 2 which is conveniently located just outside the train station it takes ten minutes, drops you right outside the museum and costs just $1.70. It is a very safe and easy journey with good directions and signs.

Changi Chapel and Museum is well worth the journey out to it to learn about Singapore’s struggles during the years of 1942-45. Here you can reflect with others including family members on those dark times. Combine a trip here with trips to The Old Ford Factory, Reflections at Bukit Chandu and Kranji War Memorial to give you an overall view of Singapore during the World War 2 years."
,,World War 2 history!,4.0,,"This museum shows the plight of not only the english soldiers in Singapore when the Japanese took over, but the hardships of all other nations soldiers, and the appalling treatment of the civilian women."
,,Moving and educational,5.0,,"We went here because we had read Russell Braddon's book ""The Naked Island"" about his time here, in Pudu gaol in Malaysia and on the Thailand-Burma ""Death Railway"". The museum is tiny but it gives a very stark depiction of life under Japanese rule during WWII. As well as armed forces personnel, women and children were held here; conditions were desperately unsanitary and worsened by the captors' withholding of medicines and food, the latter in particular being available in abundance but kept from prisoners who had to pee on green shoots to try to get some vitamins into their diets. Well worth a visit to remember at what cost Singapore's prosperity was purchased."
,,Please visit.,4.0,,"Living in a peaceful, beautiful, democratic country it is necessary to visit this Museum to appreciate those who enabled me to this life."
,,Changhi POW Menorial,4.0,,"Went on a guided tour from the Mandarin Orchard to Changi where most older people will know as the prison camp set up by the Japs, to inter thousands of Allied military personnel. The tour showed the chapel plus many original implements crafted by out troops just in order to exist on a bowl of rice per day... Also saw the ""Changi"" trees., small as they may be as the display has been moved from its original site.. This tour should be on everyone's list when in Singapore, especially the younger generation, if only to have them realize the atrocities inflicted upon the prisoners during the Jap invasion of Malaya. There are many original writings by the prisoners. Only problem was, time not enough to take it all in. Need about 2 hours."
,,A very eye opening experience,5.0,,This was a great place to visit and learn. You get to see a lot of photos and artifacts collected and displayed. We got a cab there for the city center and for a cultural experience we got the bus back. Well worth the effort.
,,Made me think,4.0,,"The visit was profound for me. My uncle was a POW of the Japanese captured in Singapore, and fortunately survived. It made think, And respect his memory more, knowing only since, why he had been sharp at times. All their memories and sufferings shall live for ever."
,,A Must Visit,5.0,,"Changi Chapel and Museum is so well presented, very moving and enormously informative. I recommend it very highly to those spending time in Singapore."
,,A moving experience,5.0,,"We have a particular interest in both World Wars so this was a must for us to see. And we weren't disappointed. This is not a modern interactive museum aimed at children. Instead there are displays of artifacts and articles which need to be read and time taken over them. It was extremely moving reading the accounts and looking at the pictures and imagining what life must have been like for the residents of Singapore during the war. Most moving was the quilt sewn by the female prisoners. We liked the symbols of peace in the chapel.
We took the train to Tanah Merah and then the bus which dropped us right across the street from the museum. After our visit we had lunch in the little café next door. Well worth a visit if you enjoy history."
,,Must see,5.0,,"This is a great museum that I have been planning to visit for years, very emotional and detailed. Lest we forget!"
,,Very Moving,5.0,,"Gives a good history to WW2 and the conditions endured by the people and soliders in Singapore. Very difficult to listen to some of the stories but well done with a lot of respect, The wall paintings are exceptional."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Very moving account of the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in WWII, and the subject use of Changi Prison as a prisoner of war camp."
,,History buffs a must see,5.0,,History of Singapore during the war is honestly displayed here without overdoing the reality of what happen here. Impact on all on display - heart warming the humanising of the individuals telling their own story
,,Silent tribute,5.0,,"This was a truly humbling experience to visit the infamous prison/chapel, the home for many British servicemen during WWII. My own history teacher from secondary (high) school was inprisoned there and yet told no stories. Visiting makes you understand the horror of war and the reasons why so many never told their stories."
,,Changi with family of five,5.0,,"We really enjoyed changie. We visited on our way to airport before an international departure. We were there by 8.30 but didn't open until 9.30 so we paid a small fortune for our driver. This was worth it to us as we had personal connections to changi.
Thought the meuseum was done really well and the audio tour was great. We spent nearly two hours there. My son who is into his history could have stayed longer."
,,Moving,4.0,,"Whilst we all need to look forward, we also need constant reminders about our past and this chapel and museum does this through pictures, scripts and audio. We found it a bit difficult to access via MRT"
,,Thought provoking.,5.0,,"We spent a good two hours here and found it to be well put together and very interesting. It is free to just have a look or if you want an audio set it costs $8 from memory. The audio set was very useful in my opinion in not only explaining each display but it also had first hand accounts from people involved in this experience.
We also had a meal at the cafe in the grounds of the Chapel and it was very nice and the staff were very nice. I experienced my first Root Beer Floater here and is was very yum!"
,,"Informative, moving and enjoyable",4.0,,"This museum was great - take the audio tour to get the most out of it. The audio guide is informative and gives great detail over the occupation of Singapore by the Japanese, from invasion to surrender. It really is an eye-opener as to what went on.

There are some great bits and bobs here. Well worth the trip out!"
,,AROUND THE ISLAND – TOUR EAST SINGAPORE – VERY IMPRESSED.,5.0,,"Picked up at 8.30am and transferred to a very busy Singapore Flyer transfer. With everything running smoothly we were lucky to have a very informative tour guide (Philip). The tour to the Kranji War Memorial was very moving. On the bus on time and on to the next stop at the Bright Hill Temple. Philip again was very informative and took extra time to explain paintings on the walls. Lunch on the tip of Singapore overlooking Malaysia – the restaurant staff were extremely kind and the food was the best we’ve had on a tour in a long time. Next stop was the Changi Chapel and Museum. This was the highlight of the tour for us. The only negative I have here is that we wished we could have had a little extra time. (40 minutes was not enough). Next stop was Gardens by the Bay – we did most of this the day before (which we thoroughly recommend), but because of the short time once again, we opted for the $5 per person audio mini bus ride. This was an excellent way to get around the garden, if you didn’t have enough time (approx. 1day) to appreciate the gardens. If you are lucky enough to get Philip (who you can tell loves his job and history) we would thoroughly recommend this tour."
,,A wonderful piece of Australian History,5.0,,"Yep, the chapel is a replica (the original is in Canberra) but the chapel and museum hold so many pieces of war memorabilia that it is definitely worth a look."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,We travelled for approx 1 hour by train and bus to get to the museum. When we arrived we were told about the display and were recommended to pay for the audio which tells the story about the displays. I found the discription of the events as told by survivors to be very confronting and emotional. The museum gave me an understanding of what happened during WW2 and an appreciation of the people who gave their lives so others can live . Wonderful tribute and well worth a visit. There is a souvenier shop inside the museum and a cafe/resturant outside.
,,Excellent Moving Museum,5.0,,"I have taken many visitors to this museum and they all find it moving, educational and it explains about what happened to Singapore during WW11. The headphone tour makes it come alive and gives more information. They have a restaurant and shop."
,,A worthwhile visit,5.0,,So interesting and enlightening. Well worth a visit to see what all civilians and soldiers endured. Loved the little chapel and sat for a while there. Very peaceful in a busy city
,,A great tribute,5.0,,"Did this as a tour, and the guide was able to build the story of singapore prior to the invasion, so when we reached the museum, it just flowed on. We went to pay respect to those who suffered there, as there is a family and friend connection."
,,A walk down the history,4.0,,A place to visit if you want to know more about Singapore History. Bot too much but just a small dose of it. Takes about a couple of hours only and you can move on to Changi Village for some food. :)
,,Almost moved to tears.....,5.0,,"Highly moving and thought provoking. An essential part of Australian history and the substantial Australian military effort in S/E Asia during WW2. Adult entrance fee is $8 SGD and this comes whith head phones that provide commentary. The facility is very compact and well laid out. Staff are very friendly and keen to chat, particularly about where in Australia you come from. Getting there has several options. My ex-wife on her visit to Singapore caught a taxi and found that option quite viable. I took the train to the Tanah Merah station, turned right when exiting the station and then right again where I caught the number 2 bus (about 15 minutes ride) and got off at stop B09. These buses run about every 10 minutes but the heat waiting outside can be slightly oppressive and on the way back to the station the bus can get crowded and the ride is a bit slower. The souvenir shop has some intersting literature available for purchase. Overall, highly recommended for tourists / travellers of all ages and the highlight of my 2nd visit to Singapore."
,,Haunting personal stories from war time prisoners,4.0,,"In the hustle and bustle of life in modern Singapore it is easy to forget the nightmares the country endured during WWII, already almost 70 years ago. The Changi Museum is an important reminder of the past, and of how our forefathers suffered.

The museum is a most-do for any surviving family and friends of war vets and civilians who were imprisoned in Changi (close to 50,000 at its height), or anyone who lived through WWII. There are riveting personal accounts of the war, and many personal items like diaries, letters, postcards and keepsakes on display as well.

You can read my blog post about my recent visit here:
http://untouristsingapore.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/changi-chapel-and-museum/"
,,Must see for WWII tourists,5.0,,There isn't much to it and it's a long way out from the main drags of Singapore. But it's worth the effort. Gives one the sense of what occurred after the fall of Singapore and life under Japanese conquerors. Very interesting stuff. Our older kids (9 & 7) thoroughly enjoyed it.
,,Very moving...,5.0,,"Loved this place. A great tribute to the fallen. You can just wander around and view yourself, be part of a tour party or as we did have an audio guide while walking around. Very well done."
,,"History alive, but a shame no buildings can be accessed",4.0,,"Being an Aussie we had to go here. Getting there was interesting as we caught the MRT, but were given the wrong station by the hotel so had a longer cab ride, and our cabbie didn't know where it was (I ended up on google maps directing him).
But it was a worthwhile visit, and we learnt a great deal more about the conflict and the human stories from a different perspective. I was hoping to go through some of the old prison areas so was a little disappointed that we couldn't."
,,Somber reminder of Singapore's beginnings,5.0,,"This museum is a hidden little gem which should be experienced at least once, whether you're a tourist or local. Despite it's small size, the contents of the exhibition are precious. There's a good 45 min commentary via headphones which you can rent (for a fee) with more details of the exhibits, narrated by those who experienced WWII firsthand. Even without that, each exhibit has good descriptors, images and artifacts which you can go through at your own pace. This takes about the same time as the audio commentary. There're also wonderful replicas of the Changi Murals and an outdoor chapel, and even a floor drawing of what a prison cell was like in terms of size and layout. The entire experience left a deep impression in me as it's so easy to forget Singapore's past when you're around such a cosmopolitan and modern city state.

On the way to the Museum, you'll be able to see a different side of Singapore as you'll likely pass the present-day prison and industrial estates."
,,Deeply felt,4.0,,"The Museum display was on the whole excellently curated and - as all others have expressed - extremely sombre and deeply felt. The audio tour was excellent, really filling in skeletal knowledge and colouring it with the voices of those who were there. For an Australian it was refreshing to get the Singaporean perspective and the heroism and suffering of the locals was well chronicled, recognised and deeply moving.

There was, however, one really discordant note in the audio: hearing the traumatic, emotional memories of Jan O'Herne Ruff, her own voice and her own words, regarding Comfort Women and making the point re the trivialisation historically of women's role in Changi (and War) - so very moving especially when we consider that rape is still a sanctioned tool of war around the world - being followed by the honky tonk jazzy music and discussion of the lighter forms of entertainment in the camp seemed extraordinarily insensitive. I thought it may have just been me in a heightened state of emotion, but subsequently spoke to others in my party who also found it equally inappropriate - and almost reinforcing the trivialisation that was being discussed.

This aside, the Chapel and Museum was a really well put together memorial of a dark chapter. Well worth a visit"
,,A reminder of a worse time,4.0,,The Chapel and Museum are very well presented. The memorial is a reminder of a time when many suffered. It was a moving experience. The staff are very helpful.
,,"Small, but moving and informative",4.0,,"This was a sobering visit. After all the glam and modernity of Singapore, this was a good opportunity to reflect on the harhships of times past. The museum is small, but interesting and thought provoking. The trip on the bus takes longer than the visit itself. Mostly photographs and artefacts, with lots of information. Part of the old wall to the prison and gate still exists, up the road, but you are not allowed to photograph it as it is incorporated into the new prison facilities."
,,Changi Museum is a sobering place,5.0,,"The Changi Museum is out near the airport and describes a very sobering, sad time in the life of the Singaporeans and Australians who came to help them. The Japanese held them as prisoners for many years and it is amazing that any of them lived to get out. The chapel's murals are very life-affirming and helped the prisoners with their faith that one day this horror would end."
,,Very thought provoking.,5.0,,"After getting here on the bus, we were pleased that we went as we learnt so much. The museum is very well set out and there are audio guides for different languages although all the displays are in English.
We thought it would have been good to have seen the original gates to the prison, they are now hidden by the current prison since the museum moved.
Still a very good place to go."
,,Definitely worth a visit,4.0,,"No, it is not very big, and by other museum standards it is not very modern, however the Changi Museum is well worth a visit. The audio tour is a must, giving extra information to that on the exhibits. There is no cost to enter the museum, but the audio tour has a small fee.
The museum has an air of reverence about it, and an air of calm, which is as it should be, and this would be ruined by large scale interactive exhibits. It is a shrine to those who served, and yes, we did learn more about what they went through. Even our 11 year old found it fascinating.
My only comment would be that some of the texts on the exhibits were very small and I struggled to read them."
,,Great for restaurant location,3.0,,"The chapel is a converted church used for big events, which is strange. Nice to see if you happen to be going by for lunch/dinner at one of the 25 restaurants or so, but otherwise not worth the stop."
,,Very moving,5.0,,It gave me a better understanding of the hell our soldiers went thru and the in humane way they were treated. Very sad.
,,I was disappointed,2.0,,"I've read a lot about the Prisoners of War in Changi, and I expected much more from the museum. I believe these people deserve a lot more recognition than what I thought was a poor effort. The fact that you had to read everything, didn't make me feel like I was experiencing the way they suffered. I would have liked to have seen a recreation of the prison, with models depicting what happened there. However, we weren't advised about the audio tape, and so that may have turned the visit into a little more of a reality? (I believe the Changi exhibition in the Australian War Memorial in Canberra is better, and I will be making a special effort to see that)."
,,Very moving,5.0,,Well worth a visit .Well presented and very interesting .Also very moving .took a taxi out to the museum but apparently can get a bus .The museum will phone for a return taxi for you .
,,Audiotour excellent.,5.0,,This small but well done exhibit is must see for those interested in WW2 history.Our 12 yo twins listened to the audiotape intently.The chapel was very emotive.We combined the visit with a trip to Pulau Ubin on a Sunday so was great to see another side to Singapore.Very easy to get there by public transport.Bus no 2 went past museum to Changi Point Ferry to catch bumboat to island so an easy matter of catching bus back from ferry point to museum and then back to Tanah Merah MRT.
,,Interesting and Moving Museum,4.0,,"If you are interested in Singapore history this museum should be on your list to visit, even though it is on the outskirts of the city. It is a thought provoking museum, and particularly interesting if you want to learn about Colonial History of Singapore. Best to catch Bus #2 from Tanah Merah MRT station. Would suggest taking bus 2 into Changi Village to get something to eat or relax afterwards."
,,Very Moving Experience,4.0,,"This is a small museum near Changi airport, chronicling those interned in the prison during the Japanese occupation. This museum would be particular relevant to Australians many of whom suffered and died their. You need to allow 2 hours to visit this museum and make sure that when getting a Taxi that the driver clearly knows where it is, but that is another story. Highly recommended."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"As a family member of prisoner of war of Changhi we were very disappointed. We read a number of reviews on Trip Advisor before we went so weren't expecting much, but were still disappointed. It was a long way to get there via MRT and Bus and very little to see. We spent 45 minutes there, but that was really to draw time out until the next bus arrived. Not sure what we were expecting, but it wasn't what we got. We didn't feel like Changhi had a soul. We visited Sandakan (Borneo) in the same holiday and had a much better experience there."
,,A must do for everyone visiting Singapore.,5.0,,"We visited Changi museum as part of an around the Island tour of Singapore.
We chose this tour especially because of the visit to the Changi Chapel and Museum. The POW Camp has long gone but there are still some buildings left that were used and lots still of barb wired fences etc. The chapel is free to enter you only pay entrance for the Museum. Very thought provoking museum, to read and see photos etc of what happened to servicemen and women, to civilians and the people of Singapore. To think that this was man treating other people like this blows your mind.

There is a way to search records whilst you are there for any relatives you might have had at Changi, although you do need to know what regiment your relative was in before searching. I was delighted to find on display, an article made for a relative of mine by another prisoner (unfortunately photographs are forbidden inside the Museum), still I saw it and I stood there and drew it on some paper."
,,It's a pilgrimage,5.0,,"We visited Changi museum (for which there is a charge) it is very informative about the Japanese occupation, plenty to see. The church (no charge) it is lovely to sit in peace and read the many tributes to the fallen, I lit a candle to remember all the brave people who had lost their lives here."
,,Solemn place.,4.0,,"The POW camp has been gone a long time, but the museum and chapel gives you ample chances to get an idea of the horrors that went on there. Strange thing is that it seems that everyone knows someone who served their time there. There is a search capacity in the museum if you want to search for an ancestor that was there. Its done by regiments, so dont do what i did and find out after I got home the name of the regiment of the ancestor i was looking for. All very thought provoking."
,,Emotional,5.0,,"This was a great experience on how Singapore dealt with the attack of the advancing Japanese,the audio tour is the best way to go with personal stories from individuals imprisoned.The most heartbreaking but bravery and courage shown."
,,Peaceful hideout,5.0,,The chapel is an amazingly calm and serene place. The museum is well organised and informative. Focus is on the Japanese occupation of Singapore.
,,Emotional,5.0,,"Worth a visit read and listen to the stories of the servicemen and women, European civilian prisoners and the plight of Singaporeans. Then reflect on how badly humans can treat other people and abuse power and control."
,,Very moving account of POWs,5.0,,"well worth getting here as it is a very good and very moving account of history of not just singapore, but of allied forces during the occupation of japanese and the life of POWs during WW2"
,,Definitely worth getting the headset commentary,5.0,,"Definitely worth getting the headset commentary, but allow a good 2 hours to go round. Very moving account of the Occupation under the Japanese and the conditions in the POW camps."
,,A place to think!,4.0,,"First thing to remember is that this is effectively a reconstruction of the original chapel - but it is as authentic as possible. But the records, photos and exibits are all real. There is a sense of sadness and despair at man's inhumanity to man and you leave quiet but reflective - a must see place."
,,A historical site well worth visiting,5.0,,"Even though it was a relaxing holiday, a visit to the Changi Chapel and Museum was a must. Worth the effort getting there by MRT and bus. Very interesting to read and see pictures associated with this terrible time in our history. Recommend the audio tour and taking your time to read though everything and reflect."
,,Great half day trip,5.0,,We took an organised half day trip that also included the kanji war memorial. Even my 15 yr old daughter enjoyed this.
,,A Worthy Memorial,4.0,,"Our visit to the museum and chapel was a moving experience and the museum provided an insight to a sad chapter on Singapore's history during the Japanese occupation. Well worth a visit, if only to pay tribute to those who suffered during WW2."
,,Those poor Men,4.0,,I enjoyed this Museum more than i thought i would it must of been horrific for those Men And Women to endure the time they spent in that hell hole pay this place a visit it is weel worth it
,,Not what I expected,3.0,,"The story boards tell moving tales of people's experiences of the Japanese occupation i.e. horrendous.

However you cannot actually enter the prison camp site which is a shame because it would have been extraordinary to see the actual location where so many people were incarcerated and suffered awful treatment."
,,Never forget them,5.0,,This was our second visit to the Changi museum.... We took friends who had never been.. Good if not better the second time around..... A must do if you are in Singapore. We caught the train to Tanah Merah station and then got a taxi to the museum... Very easy to do... Don't miss doing this ....the self guided tour with headphones is good because you can take your time .
,,Changi Chapel and Museum at Upp Changi Rd North,2.0,,"This museum is about 30 km away from the city and the journey takes about 1 hour. You can walk round the museum in about 10 minutes. To aggravate matters, you are not allowed to take photographs and videos in the museum. This is the most stupid rule imposed on visitors to the museum. If they allow me to take a video and post it on You Tube or Tripadvisor Singapore , more tourists may be drawn to visit this museum. You get to see some old photographs and a plaque to commemorate the British and Australian soldiers who were incarcerated by the Japanese during WWII. There is nothing much to offer tourists and the National Heritage Board should close it down."
,,very moving,5.0,,This was a very moving experience. It went into real personal details about the experience of the soldiers as well as the citizensof Singapore during the Japanese Occupation.
,,moving,4.0,,"If a visit to the Changi chapel and museum does not leave a lump in your throat nothing will, it is incredible to see the evidence of the resilience of the POW's and the brutality they endured, a great thing to take teenage children to."
,,Sobering but worth it,5.0,,"If you have an interest in WW2 history, definitely go here. It's a small museum but well organized. It tells you about the Japanese invasion of Singapore and the life in Changi prison for the POWs. While it is sad to see the terrible things that happened, it is also uplifting to read of the bravery and fortitude of the prisoners. The staff are helpful if you have questions. No photos allowed inside."
,,Very moving,5.0,,"A very moving and poignant museum that tells the story of the World War 2 occupation of the island. Not recommended for younger children, but this is one of those places where we need to be reminded of what can happen in war time."
,,War History,3.0,,"The Museum tells the story of Japan's occupation of Singapore from 1942 - 1945. It tries to bring the history alive through the stories of those interned within Changi Prison and Changi Village. This included all foreigners and army personnel from Britain, Australia and the Netherlands.

The museum is small and the displays use some actual diaries, memorabilia, newspaper reports and photographs etc to tell the stories. However, the facilities are not original or in their original locations, some of the displays have trivia ( rope similar to that used in Changi) and I expected some film footage and interactive displays."
,,rememberance of those who suffered at the hand of the japanesse,5.0,,a most moving experience it gives you an insight of those poor P.O W 'S suffered at the hands of the japanesse in the second world war very emotional..
,,A little slice of history,4.0,,"Off the beaten track but a must go if you want a bit of Singapore which is real, not pre-packaged and commercialized. It is only a short drive away from Changi Village, a foodie heaven and should be part of the itinerary when you visit the Changi Chapel and Museum."
,,You have to visit this,5.0,,"Took a public bus from the city which drops you right outside.Its a sad tale but it shows you how
the captured people survived all the trauma and the ones that didnt
Everyone kids and all should visit this place
Its free to get in and they have a nice cafe on site"
,,Thought-provoking,5.0,,"Well presented, FREE entry (unless you wanted headphones). I didn't, the photos and the pieces spoke for themselves. Quite an emotional visit especially the personal messages from other visitors. Very moving indeed."
,,Small and not very accessible,2.0,,The exhibits make you very emotional. The place has lots of info related to the history of Changi Prison. The trip however is long by bus if you stay in the city area. There are nothing else nearby unless you do not mind making a trip just to spend an hour or two there.
,,Eye opening,5.0,,"Well worth a visit,very comprehensive coverage of Changi's history, but very moving, especially as I was an intern in Sime Road from 1942+..."
,,Worth visiting if you have an interest in WWII,4.0,,"Although the Chapel and Museum are quite small, there is a lot of information on display. Pictures and writings from soldiers and civilians. It is quite moving when reading some of the messages left in the Chapel by relatives of soldiers who died in Changi."
,,Worth A Visit,5.0,,"For Australian travellers, this is a must. The Museum tells the story of Japan's occupation of Singapore from 1942 - 1945 through the stories of those interned within Changi Prison and Changi Village. This included all foreigners and army personnel from Britain, Australia and the Netherlands."
,,A museum worth visiting....,4.0,,"If you are interested in history especially in the Japanese Occupation, you must visit this place. The museum is far from town but it is not isolated as it is accessible by public bus and taxis. There is so much to learn from this place."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Hard to find we got a taxi there, quite a moving place to visit,
history of Changi prison where British and Singapore prisoners
of war were kept by the Japanese, many photos, and interesting
artifacts to see, all credit to the Singapore people for keeping it
so nice, lovely little chapel where you can leave messages."
,,Poignant reminder of the suffering endured by the POWS,5.0,,"We visited this site as part of the Changi walking tour, we found the museum and the chapel very poignant and moving. We should not forget the suffering and torture these men endured and salute them for their courage."
,,Informative and moving,5.0,,"The museum, though fairly, small packs in a lot of information about the Japanese occupation and honours those who endured this period. Information is presented in an easy to read manner which choronicals Singapore both before, during and after the occupation. Quotes and personal stories used throughout are a great way to further aid understanding. Definitely worth the trip out of the centre to see."
,,A moving experince,5.0,,"Easy to get to by public transport, smaller than I expected but very complete. Told the story of those who were held ther in a very human way."
,,Lest we forget,5.0,,"A very sad period of history and a record of the awful things people do to each other. The courage of many of the ordinary folk of Singapore alongside the in-humane treatment of many prisoners of war and their interned families is recorded.
A reminder why we must all strive for peace and other ways of settling disagreements than resorting to violence and force"
,,well done,5.0,,"we have been before but we still enjoyed our second visit , presented very well , very interesting history , felt sorry for those who had to endure the suffering , worth seeing"
,,Lest we forget,5.0,,The history and what the men and woman went through we salute you all. Only down side a bit out of the way although the staff can organise a taxi for you
,,Not as authentic as I hoped,3.0,,"The museum is on the bus route, but we missed the stop because of a lack of visable signage from a crowded bus. There is lots of information but the displays are a bit too static and I was disappointed that the site is now removed from its origins so lacked some authenticity from my point of view. Still we paid our respects to the Australian and other service men who put up with so much and gave so much in those terrible war years."
,,Poignant,4.0,,"Entry to the museum is free, but the audio tour is S$6 for a shared headset or S$8 for a personal one.

The museum is rather small, and the exhibits featured photographs and memories of the war by survivors and POWs. I especially found the murals painted by Stanley Warren engaging.

One small point to note is that there are some minor flaws in the audio tour. The exhibits 8-9 are not clearly demarcated (e.g. you do not know which point to start reading according to the audio) and near the end of the tour, it links back to an exhibit at the front of the hall.

However, it was still informative and reminds us that our freedom was paid for by those who sacrificed their tomorrows for our today."
,,Informative and tragic,5.0,,We visited Changi Museum in May 2013 and the entire walk in memory of all the Prisoners and deaths during the occupation of Singapore by the Japanese was hard as the reality of the horrendous killings and torture of so many good people became clear as we listened with audio phone sets to some of the actual people who managed to survive this death camp. The displays in the Museum were realistic as actual photographs showing the starkness of the living or not living were shown.
,,Lest we forget,5.0,,"Excellent, informative & very worthwhile. We did the tour with Original Singapore Walks which was extremely worth while, the museum is brilliant, great if you can return later and spend more time to wander and read. The tour is a great way to get lots of history and information in a short space of time. Well worth doing if you have time!"
,,Reflect on the Japanese invasion of Singapore,3.0,,"Found this small museum interesting and informative. Free if not using head phones. We shared a head phone set for SG$6 each (individual head sets SG$8), but need to stay together, because of the ear phone cords. We stayed for 1 hour, as they closed at 5:00pm, but could have stayed longer. No photography allowed in museum, only outside. Lots of books on sale. Glad we visited the museum. Cost SG$20 for taxi from Little India to museum."
,,Evocative and poignant,5.0,,"Even though we study the second world war in high school history in the UK I didn't realise at all what occupation was like in Singapore and SE Asia. The museum is free to visit, but $S8 for the audio tour is really well-spent as you'll hear the voices of people who experienced the occupation. It's small, but took me just about an hour and a half to walk around, and I was really moved by it.

You can get bus #2 from central Singapore, and it took me around an hour or a bit less to make the journey, but it was definitely worth it."
,,Great place for Aussies to visit,5.0,,Good place to visit on what our Aussie POW's went through 1942-45. I visit it every time I go to Singapore just to reflect. The museum is free entry and the audio tour is $8-10. All proceeds go to the museum/chapel. This is 1 place you have to go on your Singapore trip if you are a Australian.
,,Sobering,3.0,,A good memorial to the war and the atrocities that happened however was very disappointed to see that it had been moved from its original spot and really expected something a bit more significant. Given the brevity of what happened during the war I expected something more significant. Essentially they have rebuilt one of the chapels the POWs built. Still it is very sobering and gives you a moment to pause and remember and it is very moving.
,,If you want to know more about Singapore's History then put this on your list,4.0,,"Entrance is free which amazed me. The history and the knowledge you will gain is impact full and moving. Singapore has recovered so quickly from which was a terrible time for their little island.

Whether your a tourist a local or a resident of Singapore take the time to visit,"
,,Great exhibition,5.0,,This Museum and Chapel is only 10 minutes from the Changi Village Hotel and is well worth the time to go and see. The exhibits have been well put together and covers many aspects of prison life. I would give yourself about 1 hour to go through the Museum as there is so much history to take in within the place.
,,Da's lucky Escape from Singapore!,5.0,,"A great museum, particularly if family were involved in Singapore during WW2. Dad escaped with an Evacuation Order the night before the surrender. He and 56 Argyll & Southerland Highlanders were allowed to leave for Sumatra on the RASC launch. In Padang, Dad couldn't get on the large Dutch troopship as the Argylls did but their ship was sunk by Japanese torpedos with no survivors. Dad scrounged deck space on an old Duch tramp steamer and made it to Columbo."
,,Amoving morning,5.0,,A small memorial with lots of information that was easily accessed from Lavender via the MRT and No5 bus from Semei to Changi womens prison and No 2 Bus from the prison to museum. The museum has an excellent audio guide for $8 or you can go without for free. The audio was worth the $8 with an excellent guide to the exhibits and extra interviews with survivors and contributors to the museum. I learned many new things on the day I visited Changi
,,"A must see, but very thought evoking.",4.0,,"I have to admit that I am an ex Army man who served in Singapore, Malaya and Borneo in the 1960's so I am aware of the history. I would not have missed this visit for anything but you cannot really say you enjoy it. It brings home once again ""man's inhumanity to man"". Do please go and acknowledge the sacrifices made by so many."
,,Fascinating and sobering,4.0,,"This museum is a little off the beaten path but is accessible by public transport if you want to go independantly.
If you take the time to read all the displays you will get a good idea of the events of the British Surrender and the Japanese Occupation. If you are more of a browser then this won't take you long as there aren't many artefacts as such. The museum is small but tells a story and does so very well. The only disappointment is that photography is not allowed at all. I'm not sure why. It is more likely to appeal to those with an interest in history but would be of less interest to those only casually interested, especially given how far off the beaten track it is."
,,Very thought provoking.,5.0,,"Had to come here as I had two great uncles who were Changi POW's. This museum had fantastic displays, a beautiful replica of the chapel and really good audio tour. It's well worth the $8S for the headset. The gift shop is great for books and they have a good reference library to help try and locate info on POW inmates."
,,Prison,5.0,,I had to vist this prison as we were interred there during the war .The Chapel next door to the prison has been rebuilt from the original timbers from the old one and it really is a beautiful and serene spot to gather one's thoughts. Read the book of remembrance. It will choke you up all those men and woman who died during the occupation by the Japanese. The Singaporeans have done a wonderful job. Fineally do visit Krangi Cemeteary and see all the beautiful well kept graves of our comrades who died for Freedom.Ken
,,in tears,5.0,,If you know nothing about Singaporean history in WWII you must visit. Whatever you do know will be confirmed in spades. Hugely moving experience
,,All that remains,5.0,,"Make sure you don't leave Singapore without taking the time to visit the Changi Museum. All that remains of the Changi Prison is here, a disturbing and moving reminder of terrible atrocities and suffering that come with war. An important historical site that will stay with you for years to come."
,,Time to reflect,4.0,,I liked reading the history. I would have liked to see some part of the prison. I would liked to have seen the list of people who had been kept there.
,,Very moving,5.0,,"There are places on the planet that have become infamous in name, this is one of them....do not keep away but look around to see the madness of war and the waste of lives"
,,Must visit,4.0,,"A very moving place to visit, some really good history is on display with interviews from people imprisoned during the war period.

A shame that the main prison area was demolished and little of the site kept.

MY wife and I hired the head sets ($8) and found them to be a great way to listen to the history. With the museum offering free entry this was a good way of paying something towards the cost of maintaining them facility."
,,A very moving experience,5.0,,"Wonderfully old fashioned museum. Be prepared to take a big box of tissues. It is very informative about the sufferings of the people of Singapore during the Japanese occupation. Not an easy experience, but one we should all be aware of."
,,Disapointing,2.0,,Much more could have been done to make it more interesting. The old Changi Jail has been torn down and the memorial moved a long way away. It would seem that Singapore wants to ignore it's history but history cannot be unmade!
,,Lacks atmosphere,3.0,,"We were disappointed by this. We expected much more of a sense of place and an evocation of the Changi experience. Sadly, the Changi POW jail went the way of much of Singapore's past. There's almost nothing to connect this attraction physically to the experience other than it's located in the large Changi district. That said, the displays are powerful and the personal stories heartbreaking and uplifting."
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,"This is an interesting museum, as it uses the voices of the people who were affected by the invasion of Singapore so it gives you a better feeling for the day to day realities of it. The exhibition is arranged a little confusingly as you have to move from one side of the room to another and back again to read it chronologically."
,,Not the monument to the dead and imprisoned I expected,2.0,,"Its free to go round this museum. And thats the positive. There are few real artefacts, mostly they are facsimiles. Shame.
The information is repeated several times in different places, so its a little boring. I found his detracted from the serious, sad information offered. Don't bother to buy the headset the same information s on the exhibits."
,,Changi Chapel & Museum,5.0,,Very good display of information and audio tour is worth the cost as admission is free. It provides a very good insight into the conditions experienced by prisoner's of war who were interned here during second world war.
,,A fitting memorial for those who died and suffered during WW2,5.0,,The curators have done a fine job in presenting a good history of the Japanese invasion and eventual incarceration of residents. The chapel is a solemn place in fitting with the experiences of those imprisoned and the many who died there. A must visit for those interested in History.
,,Moving,4.0,,"Ever since watching Tenko on the television, I'd really wanted to visit this site and wasn't disappointed - most of the stories were very moving and it continues to amaze me how humans can treat other humans with such viciousness. A quilter myself, I was especially touched by the Changi quilt, which I'd previously only seen in a magazine article."
,,A must do,5.0,,"Not the easiest place to get too, we ended up going by taxi $16 from the city centre, however is well worth the effort. Entrance is free but hiring the audio guide for $8 gives you more detail on what you will see. WW2 in Singapore was not Japan's finest hour and the courage of its prisoners during that time is a humbling experience and one I am very glad I did."
,,A 'must visit' for every student!,5.0,,Although one of the smallest museum i have known. This well-kept heritage site depicts our historical moment back in time when Singapore falls and Prisoner of Wars were taken .... and many killed. It shows artifacts and pictures of equipment used for torture and the life of allied forces PoW. A solemn place ending in a small make-shift chapel that PoWs yearn for hope in the faith they held firm to. Complete your visit chilling out with a Erdinger beer in the Barks' Cafe just outside this museum.
,,Changi Museum,5.0,,"The museum is very moving and worth the visit. The museum is small but to see all the exhibits and read the extracts of letters etc. will take some time, it is not a place to visit if you are in a hurry
The chapel is a copy the original is located in Canberra war memorial.The part I found disappointing was the cafe that felt very much out of place and in the wrong position."
,,Moving and a place to pay your respects.,5.0,,The records and photographs of the experiences of the prisoners at Changi during the war will remain with me always. Such suffering inflicted by humans on others should always be remembered so we can avoid such terrible things from happening again if possible.
,,Full Island Tour,5.0,,This place is well worth a stop. It has some amazing artefacts and stories of the Japanese Invasion and cruelty to the prisons. A terrific well priced gift shop unlike most places in Singapore and a Cafe off the side for refreshments. The staff were very helpful and obliging.
,,A sombre moment to reflect,5.0,,"This small Museum is very thought provoking, the exhibits are displayed in a way that brings all the horrors of the events to mind. The sheer enormity of the situation and the barbaric treatments carried out must never be forgotten. The Chapel is an oasis of peace and reflection and after the Museum and the traumatic experiences portrayed, it is almost tranquil. The cafe on site provides good food and drink at reasonable prices. Sadly due to the old Prison still being in use it is not possible to see the original Prison entrance with its imposing watchtowers. This is somewhere no visitor Singaore should miss. Easily accessed by Bus and MTR."
,,Only for historians,4.0,,"If you love History, this a place worth exploring. A nicely set up museum detailing the experiences of PoW. Not for the faint hearted. The paintings on walls are indeed a testimony of great faith..!"
,,Must see,5.0,,"Like Kranji war cemetery and the Battle Box, et al, this is an educational and historical reminder of the folly of war."
,,Moving experience and well presented,4.0,,"Yes I am Australian so Changi has always been a place I wanted to visit. It is not the original but that doesn't really matter as it has still captured the horror, bravery, friendship, sufferings and emotions experienced during the Japanese occupation. Strongly recommend you get the audio tour and then take your time (probably take 2-3 hours) and work your way through the exhibits. It is only a smallish museum but size does not detract from the amazing stories of survival. Take time to sit in the chapel and reflect on the human cost of war."
,,Moving visit,5.0,,"We spent a morning at the Changi Chapel and Museum, and walked through using the audio guide. It was a moving visit for us. Two days earlier we had been at the National Museum, and found this to be a more complete look at the aspect of the Japanese occupation and life for those in detention. The chapel murals were beautiful and we appreciated the look at the spiritual side of living under such oppression. We took bus 2 from Tanah Merah MRT station. The website has a map in English that helped us figure out where to get off. If you're not familiar with traveling by bus, be sure to let the driver know where you want to get off."
,,"It may be a replica, but what a place!",4.0,,"Why do people glorify war? The question cannot be answered sanely. But, pacifist or not, everyone needs to be jolted into the horrific and inhuman reality of it. The Changi Museum and Chapel is worth at least two hours of solemn listening, looking and learning.
It contains a sobering collection of artefacts, materials and pictures of the daily lives of the Prisoners of War. It covers the atrocities of war. It shows much about life, and death, not just of the POWs but those thousands of Singaporeans who were just rounded up and executed.
The religious symbolism is strong and makes those of use of no religious belief appreciate the strength that the images and practices of faith brought to those who suffered. Of course, it did not explain or answer anything, but amidst the cruelties of war, you grasp what hope you can.
Videos, audio visuals, letters, artifacts, replicas, murals: truly sobering."
,,A valuable historical remnder,4.0,,The museum brought home the events and sufferings of the people of Singapore during WWII and remind us of the horrific human potential for cruelty
,,A place away from the hustle and bustle.,3.0,,Decent food and drinks with reasonable pricing. I only stopped going there because they wouldn't have an area for smokers.
,,Meaningful museum experience,4.0,,"The artefacts fabricated and/or left by the prisoners, the handmade quilts, and the photos sear your memory. You may need tissues, especially viewing the Elizabeth Choy video. I recommend watching both videos. You cannot take photos, but there is a small gift shop. This museum is a must see for every visitor and resident!"
,,Simple and very moving,5.0,,"Such a simple chapel and museum but this makes it all the more moving. The museum chronicles shocking acts and then also great acts of bravery and humanity. The location is some way out from today's booming commercial city centre , but is , I think, well worth the time and effort to go."
,,Moving visit to those who gave so much,5.0,,Really informative museum about Changi Jail during the occupation of the Japanese in Singapore durig the 2nd World War.
,,Audio headset worth the cost,4.0,,"We took the MRT to Tanah Merah and then a bus to Changi. This was a good idea as it gave us a view of suburban Singapore. As well, we drove past the current Mens' and Womens' prisons which was a bit confronting.
The museum is modern, air conditioned and well laid out.We paid $S8 for the audio. It was well worth it. As well as background information at each section there were additional recordings of the actual people recounting their experiences. So it was not a static display their voices brought it to life. The reconstructed chapel had a wall where people have written their thoughts. This was a moving part. Likewise, lighting a candle had an emotional impact on me."
,,A must see,5.0,,"A very eye opening visit, a small museum, but good value and certainly had me thinking of all the things the Prisoner would have to have gone through in those days."
,,Informative museum,5.0,,Took the bus here and it was nice. Got to see different Singapore neighborhoods. The museum is worth the trip. Very nice displays with actual witness accounts of what happened during WWII. Sad and moving.
,,"""Lest we Forget""",5.0,,"Any visitor to Singapore should vist this Chapel and museum. A reminder of the spirit of the human race and the ""mateship"" of Aussies.The displays are very well presented. I found it so moving that I left in tears."
,,Sobering Reminder!,5.0,,The whole experience of walking through the museum and chapel at Changi was very emotional. Terrible experiences by those in captivity and wonderful stories of human resilience and hope.
,,Wartime History in Singapore,5.0,,Visit this 'snapshot in time' of the History of Singapore. A well-documented history of wartime Singapore for history buffs and those wishing to know more about the evolution of Singapore. Also take in Ford Museum (another tour).
,,sobering,5.0,,"a very interesting museum , a healthy reminder of some of the sacrifices made by veterans and local population"
,,"excellent, but some people need to learn respect",5.0,,"excellent, even my 10 year old enjoyed this tour, spoilt by people letting their children run wild in the chapel area while we were trying to convey a sense of respect to our son, and not getting their children out of our pictures."
,,World War II,5.0,,"Museum telling us what happen on World War II, try the audio tour, and try the Changi WWII trail on Saturday from 10 am to 1pm, you will learn a lot on WWII."
,,Makes you think,5.0,,"My husband wanted to visit here as he had a friend who had been here through the war,its amazingly quiet when you arrive,set out museum style and you can get audio to guide you round but we ended up just reading and looking at everything,set out really well so easy to follow,the chapel and the chapel paintings make you sit and realise the reality of it all.well worth visiting if your in Singapore."
,,History,5.0,,WOW - Stories very well told. We didn't take the tape - we just walked our way around and read all the stories. It is free admission. We caught a taxi both ways and it was approx A$10 each way from our city hotel. Worth a visit if you are interested in history.
,,Journeys Pte Ltd Changi Museum War Trails,4.0,,"Affilitated with The Original Singapore Walks.

Excellent coach-enabled walking tour of Changi Chapel and Museum as well as other significant locations relevant to war time Singapore.

There is nothing like having an informed tour guide. The tour leader customised the tour with stories pertinent to each of the four nationalities represented by our small group of nine in addition to the situation of Singaporeans, Malays, the Japanese, Chinese, and British Allies.

Because our time at the museum was taken up by the guided tour, a further return visit would give the opportunity to study displays for ourselves. However time was given for quite rememberance at the chapel."
,,So glad we went,5.0,,Did the audio tour of Changi Chapel and Museum and it was was so worth the trip out. Museum has many original artefacts from the time of the fall of Singapore and so much information. As an Australian and growing up with this as part of our history really enjoyed our visit.
,,Lest We Forget,4.0,,"It had moved since my last visit in 1986. The Chapel has been rebuilt and a modern museum. It is full of original artifacts and the memories of those who were there. Everybody should visit this site.
It is easy to reach on the No. 2 Changi Village bus in Bras Basah Rd or a taxi for about S$15."
,,Anyone of British heritage should visit,5.0,,Although it's not the easiest place to find it's worth a visit if only to understand some things about the second world war.
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"As a bit of a history buff, this was a great find. We were taken here by a local, you'd have trouble getting there otherwise. The stories and displays were outstanding, and you can't argue with the price!"
,,Worth a Visit.,4.0,,It is worth a visit to Changi. My husband could spend all day reading every little bit of information - a quick walk through would be sufficient for me.
,,A thoughtful visit,4.0,,Told the story of the invasion clearly. Not spectacular unlike much of Singapore but full of meaning and brought home the horror for those involved. A longish taxi ride to get there and back.
,,Respectful war memorial,4.0,,Well done for creating an informative and respectful memorial. Easy to get to via the #2 bus from Tanah Merah station. There is a cafe for lunch after. Cash only. Audio tour good value.
,,"Deeply, Deeply Moving...",5.0,,"Dedicated to the people and POW's of WWII during the Japanese occupation of Singapore. Dark evil days indeed. Catch bus 29 from Changi Village and it will drop you at the door. You will pass Changi Prison on the way. It is still an operational gaol. A small museum but poignant and deeply moving. Whether or not you had relatives as POW's or not. Very informative. The chapel is lovely. You can light a candle and write a remembrance note to leave on the board. A gift shop where you can purchase memorabilia and informative books on the occupation.
You will need to take your tissues...."
,,GO,5.0,,"Go as this tour was simply so good. Joo Lin , the guide, from Viator, was superb providing a passionate account of the history of Singpore with her own personal reminiscences. Interesting and somber. Food for thought."
,,Slice of Singapore's hidden history,5.0,,"This place is not on the tourist map and neither have many locals been here. It is one of the few places in SIngapore that captures the brutal occupation of Singapore by Japan during World War 2.

The museum chronicles the war and pays homage to the prisoners and defence forces who helped oust Japanese imperial forces.

The letters by some of the allied prisoners are especially sad and touching.

If you like history, this is a must visit as the Japanese occupation is known as of one of the darkest periods in Singapore's history owing to widespread lack of resources and brutality."
,,A moving experience,5.0,,We haven taken many visitors to this chapel and no one has left unaffected by what they have seen. It is a bit out of the way but a must for Singapore residents and visitors. An important part of the island's history and connected to so many other nationalities as well. A testimony to the horrors of war. Use the audio guide. It is helpful.
,,Detailed History,5.0,,The Changi Chapel and Museum provides a moving experience of the struggle Singapore endured during the Malaysia Crisis. It is an important historical site - and not to be missed by those interested in history. You can hire a cassette with headphones that will give you a running commentary of the different exhibitions. it is worthwhile as it gives you lots of information about the political times and how solders and citizens experienced events. You don't have to be a history buff to appreciate the sacrifice made by many. Highly recommend the Chapel and Museum as a half day tour. There is also a coffee shop and cafe nearby set in tranquil settings
,,Small but excellent insight into life in Singapore POW camps after it fell to the Japanses in WWII.,5.0,,"Excellent in-depth chronicle with stories and pictures and explanations of events in Singapore during WWII. Definitely worth getting the headset commentary, but allow a good 2 hours to go round. Very moving account of the Occupation under the Japanese and the conditions in the POW camps."
,,The best eye opener,5.0,,Go with an experienced tour guide called carol and open your eyes to everything. She was a book full of knowledge and had first hand stories.
,,Vey emotional visit,5.0,,Very emotional visit.Very informative true events seen and read throughout our visit. Thanks to the fallen who have allowed me to live in a conflict free world. A must visit for anyone visiting Singapore.
,,excellent,5.0,,Great short day trip and so much interesting history. Well worth a visit but small children may get bored. 2 hours would be enough time.
,,Lest we forget,5.0,,"A very moving place to visit, with an audio device the best way to take it all in and remember the sacrifices that were made by locals and foreigners alike. Lest we forget"
,,Very Powerful - well worth the trip,5.0,,we did a half day bus trip - FANTASTIC guide! The chapel itself was very sobering and heart wrenching. A must do for anyone interested in the history of our Asian region
,,End of Empire and its consequences,5.0,,So it has been moved from the original position but the quality of this museum is outstanding. I had two great uncles here before they were shipped off to construct that infamous railway in Thailand. It was so moving to learn about their experiences and to learn about the terrible treatment of the local Chinese people. This is frequently glossed over.
,,Moving,5.0,,This somewhere all young people of the free world should visit. Went with my 2 sons paid to have audio conmmentary. Gave them an understnding of what captured Troops wnt through in Changi and on the Burma railway. Not only this but how the local people suffered under Japanese occupation which in some respects was much worse
,,"Emotional Experience , bring your tissues",5.0,,"My family and i attended The Original Singapore Walks and the Changi Museum War Trails bus tour today. From start to finish it was a very informative , emotional experience. Our guide Carol was amazing and when she found out my husband was in the military added extra information that she thought would be relevant to him. It was also so informative that for the 3.5 hrs we were on tour that my 8 and 6 yr old hardly made a peep, and were so interested in what they had heard that they have not stopped asking questions all evening. I recommend this to anyone who has heard of Changi and has always wanted to know more about it. And bring your tissues as you may become quite emotional, i know i did."
,,Interesting visit,5.0,,"This was very interesting and not too big. The museum takes you round the history of the war, the fall of Singapore and the conditions of the prisioners and the residents. It was moving in places. Good places to eat."
,,A quiet reminder,5.0,,"Whilst a lot of people say the same thing, it's important to understand and respect what it was that the allies and Singaporeans went through as a result of the Japanese invasion. This is a place of respect, rememberance and thankfulness. There is no big fanfare, parade grounds per se, simply a quiet opportunity to read and listen to what happened. The audio tour is a must, it is simple to use, clearly articulated and well priced @ $8.00. Entry is free. I caught a taxi there and spent about 3 hours listening to what unfolded after the surrender to the Japanese. The stories told were unbiased, factual (as far as I understand) and presented in a respectful manner. One cannot visit such a place and not be moved by what unfolded. All who visit Singapore should add this to their itiniery."
,,Not that exciting,3.0,,"I am a big fan of WWII history, but this was not that great. Not to mention it was a long bus ride. I would skip this in the future."
,,Lest We Forget,5.0,,"Although the museum isn't huge in comparison to some museums in other parts of the world, it is very moving. The story boards coupled with the well narrated hired audio, which explains the displays (S$8.00), go part way to help us imagine just how tough conditions were within Changi Prison as a POW.
There's a lot of information contained within this smallish museum, some graphic, some quirky, stuff that makes it all the more personal and human. All of it interesting. I found the women's quilts very moving. These were used to pass messages via stitched symbols, initials and motifs.
Listening to the survivors stories (male & female) reinforces that they had so much guts and courage, mateship was alive and thriving within those walls and to think that many of them were young men and women.
Although you can't take photos in the museum, its OK to take them outside and in the Chapel area.
The Chapel area is a lovely shaded spot, with benches, where you can have time to reflection on what you have seen. For me the most moving part of the chapel were the strings of paper cranes that hang near the altar.
A point to remember is that this isn't the original site of the chapel, it was moved from inside the Changi Prison walls, those same walls with razor wire atop them, that you see when you arrive.
The Museum is open from 9.30am - 5.00pm (last entry 4.30pm) each day. Its free with the audio costing S$8.00 for adults.
I took a little over an hour to view the site but could had stayed longer if I didn't have another appointment to keep.
A taxi from the airport, return, cost approx S$20.00. Rather than asking the driver who took me there to wait, I hailed a return taxi from the roadside at the front of the museum. On a Sunday morning about 11am I only waited about 5-6minutes.
Restrooms are available, reasonably clean but could be better maintained.
There is a cafe on site but it wasn't open at my early arrival.
Well worth a visit."
,,Stop and Reflect,5.0,,"Allow a couple of hours at least for this moving look into history. We were fortunate to have an old soldier there at the same time who had been a P.O.W. and when asked replied ""yes,this is pretty much what it was like"""
,,A place of respect,5.0,,"Awe inspiring... Not much more to say. It is hard to fully comprehend the sacrifices others have made in the past on our behalf, and the fact that those sacrifices were made, for the most part, willingly, on our behalf. THAT is what is so awe inspiring....

How many young men, sub 20 years of age, would willingly volunteer to perhaps give up their lives to make the world a better place for their descendants now?"
,,A must do if your an Aussie!,5.0,,"We took a taxi here in January from the Botanic Gardens which cost us $13.00. The museum is much larger than I had thought, probably due to there being limited photos inside (as photography is prohibited inside the museum). One could spend hours reading all the plaques and browsing over all the items on display. Changi is much better equipped than the Battle Box, the audio tour is high tech, $8pp or $12 to share, well worth it with interesting and insightful stories to be told.
The staff are very friendly and helpful, even calling us a taxi whilst it was pouring down for our return trip to the station."
,,Reminder of the sacrifices made,5.0,,Being Australian it was well worth visiting. It is very small and took us about 30 minutes to do the museum and chapel. Caught a taxi there who waited for us while we visited.
,,Very moving expereance,5.0,,"This is a must ,to know what sacrifices people did for others and how the people of Singapore suffered. Ver"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Well laid out museum with some good displays and an excellent audio guide. Be aware this is not the original building, which was inside the current prison walls and a security risk. Despite that, no photos allowed. Public transport is good, ask your bus driver to call out when you reach the stop."
,,"Very moving, All Australians should visit",5.0,,"Had wanted to go here on several trips to Singapore and was well worth the wait. Very emotional experience and if you go, take the time to read all the boards. Suitable for young people also so they understand a little about the war period. Came away very moved and one of the best things I have seen in Singapore. As an Australia, I believe we should all see Changi Museum."
,,Lest We Forget,5.0,,"Friend and I visited yesterday. There is not much to see or interaction so I would not recommend this for young children. Essentially there are a serious of rooms with storyboards and a few artifacts. The storyboards are done well and are very informative. It is difficult to imagine as we stand in the iconic city that is modern day Singapore, that there were such turbulent and painful years.

The museum stands testament to this, to the thousands who suffered and to the heroism portrayed by so many as well as the simple acts of human kindness by ordinary people which usually led to them being beaten and tortured.

There is also a decent bookshop and a cafe. We did not try the cafe but did come away with a couple of books on the war years in Singapore.

A sobering hour or too but a must for anyone with an interest in the subject."
,,Sombre,5.0,,Was not what I was expecting. Just a building with stories as most of the prison has been destroyed. It's still a very sobering place to visit and I would recommend it to anyone interested. We had lunch at the cafe afterwards which was very nice and helped restore my mood.
,,A tribute to the POWs,5.0,,"This museum although small is a very moving location providing glimps into what it must have been like after the fall of Singapore. The number of Civilians, Service personal and women that died as a result of the occupation must never be forgotten. This tiny location is very important to both Western and Asian people. I think the most horific stories were those of the enslaved women. I believe this is a must for Australians who have parents that were service personel in WWII."
,,Emotional trip,5.0,,I visited the museum twice on this trip looking for relatives who were POW's. My search was successful but the experience is very emotional. Came away with some very interesting books and an experience that will remain with me for a very long time.
,,Moving and an important reminder of the horror of war,5.0,,"Well worth going direct from Chngi airport if you have 2 hours to spare. The museum is a tribute to the people of Singapore whose world came to an end on 15th February, 1942 when the British surrendered to the Japanese invaders, the biggest British military defeat of 19th century. it is a very moving and well presented museum which captures the impact and heroism of men and women interned there under their Japanese captors."
,,Evocative,5.0,,Very atmospheric and sometimes sad. Shows the history of the POWs from the British Commonwealth and how they lived and suffered in this place.
,,Very moving and interesting,4.0,,"I was quite ignorant (I am ashamed to say) of the history of Singapore before this trip - I knew the basic details, but not nearly enough. This chapel and museum is packed with authentic memorabilia, real life stories and accounts of the experience during that difficult time in Singapore's history. Remember to be respectful here ... visitors may experience deep emotions when they visit."
,,Worth a look,3.0,,"It was good to visit the Changi Chapel and Museum, we just took a train then a local bus. The facilities are not original or in their original locations which does make it as authentic. It was not a large facility but we were there a while, taking or time to read all of the information.

It did tell more of the stories from the point of view of the people who lived there at the time which was a great addition. There was not much information about the treatment of POWs."
,,Interesting if you like reading,4.0,,This is a well presented & documented museum. It is small and requires a lot of time to read the displays. It is a moving experience.
,,Worth the trip from town,5.0,,"Singapore had it rough in WWII. Occupied, decimated by war and disease. Sometimes the bright lights and big city that grew from that time obscure what the people endured. Changi Chapel and Museum celebrates the victory and respectfully remembers the not so distant past. This is a learning experience for teens and adults...not so good for wee children as it tells the full, unvarnished story of war."
,,Awesome and very interesting,5.0,,Our tour guide was Janet. She was amazing; spoke the best English and knew her history very well. She was a great communicator to both young and old and was very proud of her country.
,,"""History...come alive"".",4.0,,"PRO: ~An authentic place, which recreates the World War 2 atmosphere. ~Suitable for visitors of all ages. CON: ~Far away from the city, might be a put off for some, who are not willing to travel long distances."
,,Poingnant history,5.0,,A worthwhile visit for the history buff and those wishing to pay their respects to the Prisoners of War.
,,MOVING,4.0,,This is not as good as it could be as it is quite dated as museums go these days. However it is free and the staff are knowledgeable. The messages from families of inmates are moving.
,,Fascinating visit to the prison and museum well worth visiting,5.0,,"The prison had one of the original huts still there, it was a bamboo hut that the prisoners slept in. There was a mass graveyard where prisoners were burried. The museum was full of photos and memorabilia depicting what life was like in the prison and photos of the prisoners of war. The chapel had items that had been made by the prisoners. There was a book of rememberence for visitors to sign from all over the world. Really enjoyed this visit.....it was a complete eye opener."
,,Changi Chapel and Museum,5.0,,"Very sad place. I am English by birth and, but for the grace of God, I might have been in Singapore with my parents, who were British Navy. We were actually in Colombo, Ceylon, when Singapore was occupied and we, too, were evacuated from Colombo, when it was attacked by the Japanese. I did not go to Singapore until 1947 after the war ended. Changi is testimony to those brave men, women and children who did everything they could to survive until the war ended."
,,History,5.0,,A place to go if you are interested in war history. The terrible experiences the prisoners of war endured to stay alive one of the things that stuck in my mind was the very small cup which was filled with rice that was there daily diet they must have been so strong to survive the terrible cruelty. There is no charge for entry it's on the bus route.
,,Moving museum,5.0,,"It was a well presented museum showing the horrors of the POW's and the civilian population during the occupation of Singapore by the Japanese during WW11.Take the time to read some of the letters by veterans and their relatives, very moving."
,,Changi POW tour,4.0,,We did the Original Singapore Walks Changi WWII POW tour. It was extremely interesting and the visit to the museum was fascinating. I highly recommend it.
,,Very moving,4.0,,"Being Australian it was very emotional but something we all should see. It was also very informative, I learnt much more than I had known before in regards to the ingenuity of the many people that were caught up in this tragic part of history. A story of human survival and the strength the human spirit of all nations. The museum takes a good hour or more to see through and it is air conditioned."
,,Thoroughly interesting and worth the trip,5.0,,"By the end of your visit to the Changi Chapel and Museum you will have learnt an enormous amount and also truly feel the weight of the experiences by those who survived both Changi and the occupation of Singapore in WWII. Changi is best known as a POW camp but it was also a civilian internment camp, which is one of the many things I learnt during this trip.

It is not far out of town - a $15 taxi ride - there is no admission charge, and even if you choose not to get the audio guide (I find them distracting!) there is still a lot to take in. The bookshop is excellent, and the staff very obliging and called a taxi for me afterwards.

Not what you might normally think of when visiting Singapore on holiday, but absolutely worth the visit."
,,Interesting place in the east,5.0,,We intended to be a tourists for a day and moves around some interesting places of attractions and this was one of the attractions we visited. The only minus point is the location of the place.
,,worth doing in Singapore,5.0,,"We took a tour which was well worth it. Entry to the museum is free but with a guide who was very helpful and knowledgable, we learnt much more than if we had gone on our own."
,,Dramatic,5.0,,"The messages left from relations of those killed at Changi prison camp during the second world war made us so emotional, and humble everyone who visits Singapore should see this and understand what these poor British, Australian and commonwealth soldiers went through"
,,Quiet informative,5.0,,"It covers the history of 2nd world war and specially the involvements of Malays and Singapore in the War. Very good informations given. But skipped the role of Azad Hind Force (or Indian National Army), whose sacrifice is pioneer in the Indian Independent movement."
,,Interesting,4.0,,This was a great in sight into how and what the inmates had to put up with. It isn't a very large museum but has some interesting facts. It is a little disappointing that you can't see any of the actual prison. Worth visiting and has a fantastic cafe next door.
,,Very moving,5.0,,Recommend visiting here as in the glitz of modern Singapore it's easy to forget what happened in the past.
,,Buddha Tooth,5.0,,Gave a great insight into this culture. Atmospheric and interesting - well worth a visit. All part of the China Town experience and accesible from all areas.
,,We Should Remember Them......................,5.0,,"In amongst the wealth, youth and frenetic activity that is modern-day Singapore its easy to forget the horrors that were visited on Singapore and its people during WW2. The Changi Chapel & Museum should be on every visitors programme, not only to understand the terrible times had by the allies but also the atrocities meted out to thousands of locals........ Fans of the BBC's 'Tenko' programme will also be moved by this place, my partner was astonished when working out the the link!
Not too difficult to get too from Singapore city - MRT to Tanah Merah then Bus No.2 to the museum, the stop is opposite the museum after the modern day Woman's Prison - we found the Chinese bus driver and the various passengers more than happy to help us!
Its free to enter but we suggest the audio guide for a small fee. The little shop with helpful staff is well worth a visit afterwards, but if you want bottled water buy it from the shop not the outdoor restaurant - nearly double the price there!
Would recommend a visit here to anyone, perhaps tying it in with the Kranji Cemetary and Ford Factory for the full story"
,,Its a long way from town for very little,3.0,,"I found the location a little inexessible for something like this, and when i arrived I found very very little. Its wortha trip, but if you are on limited time I'd recommend going to fort cannington"
,,pause for thought,5.0,,"moments in history, like this need remembered.
Easy to get there, take the MRT to Tanah Merah, then get bus, No 2, at the stop on the opposite side of the road. The museum is the stop after the 'real prison'. When we went, we were the only tourists on the bus, and the driver called to us, when it was time to alight.
A nice half day can be spent walking, with audio commentary (small charge) thru the museum. There is also a cafe adjoining, good food, that the locals utilise. Well worth the effort."
,,Changi chapel,5.0,,This is as sacred to Aussies as Gallipoli. It has moved since I first visited and has been done up well. The history and sense of despair and hope is overwhelming- a must for all Ausssies.
,,A must for Aussies of all ages,5.0,,"Free entry, could hire an audio box for $8.
Well laid out and an education.
Had files of all soldiers imprisioned there. Need to allow at least half a day as it was a bit of a hassle getting there by bus but well worth it.
While in the area a visit to Changi village and beach is worth it. Good cheap food available."
,,The POWs perhaps deserve better.,3.0,,"We found this a little underinspiring. It is full of replicas of the original site, and didn't seem to do justice to the suffering and endurance of the POWs. Maybe because we had just visited the Krangi site, which is reverant and beautifully done. The museum at the Ford Factory is also a poignant reminder of their hardships."
,,A Tour of Respect,4.0,,A history lesson worth taking if even to pay your respects to our fallen soldiers. Brings to life the true horrors of war.
,,interesting museum about WWII,4.0,,"It is worthwhile to go to this museum. We went on one of the Singapore Walks tours, but it might be just as good or better to go by yourself and listen to the museum's audio tour."
,,Lest We Forget,5.0,,"We have been to the Chapel twice now, Oct 2009 and May 2011. Having read many publications on the Malay/Singapore Campaign it is an amazing experience being in the same area as the Late Weary Dunlop and Peter Chitty. The Museum itself is next to the current prison and the exhibition is very moving. At the going down of the sun, and in the morning. We will remember them."
,,Humbling,5.0,,"I booked this tour via email the day before, met with my tour group at the Pasir Ris train station & for $48SGD enjoyed 3 hours with our guide who shared moving stories about the struggles endured by P.O.W's and residents during the Japanese occupation. By coach we travelled to the Changi Museum, to view a replica Moster Gun, and to Changi Beach. We passed the site of the original Changi Prison where only a wall remains today, and briefly looked at the army barracks built by the British & used by the Singapore Army these days (no photo's allowed in the Museum, or of Singapores Army barracks)."
,,Saturday Visit,4.0,,"This is a very good museum that is very sympathetically thought out. The information and exhibits on display are very good. The audio devices on offer for S$8 were good value and well worth it.

It should be on your to do list if you Visit Singapore. I visited under my own steam, but there are organized trips with Guides as well that taking other WWII sites"
,,Memorable,5.0,,"who could fail to be moved when faced with the suffering of our boys in Changi, it is amazing to see how they were able to survive. Take a taxi, it is an awkward place to get too."
,,Fascinating insight,4.0,,We did a tour here and it was fascinating to learn about the POW camp. It was a moving experience but the museum is small and probably needs to spend some money in the next few years to make it more modern and appealing to a younger more technological visitor.
,,Very moving,5.0,,Simple presentation of this horrific story in first-person narrative was very powerful. Only place I have ever been - anywhere in the world - where there was absolute silence from visitors as they read the stories of those who suffered through this time. Lest we forget.
,,Very moving,4.0,,Had to go for my Mum who lost nursing friends in Singapore during the occupation. This is a splendid reminder of how bad things can be - and the triumph of hope and optimism over terror. Well done.
,,Well worthwhile,4.0,,"I was initially surprised that the isn't anything of the original camp to see, however, the museum is a very good representation of the events leading up to and during the occupation. Simply laid out and very moving. Man's inhumanity to man is on display here and worth seeing to ensure that we never forget. Lest we forget."
,,Changi,5.0,,"I found it harrowing to say the least. it also gave a great insight to what happened to other nationalities who live in singapore ,the ones you never hear about,These people suffered tremendously too. the resoursfullnes and courage of the people and prisoners alike made me feel very humble"
,,Changi gaol Singapore.,5.0,,"The museum is very informative and user friendly. The layout is easy to follow and each section of the events is well documented. There are very touching stories about local people who assisted the prisoners and these personal stories were very moving. Also there are many artefacts that had been made by the prisoners during WW2 to make their lives a little more tolerable. Also other exhibits made the whole experience more real. This all helped to bring the horrendous stories of hardship to life. The chapels, one inside and the other outside we're very moving places and readings some of the messages from family of prisoners who perished and stories of those who survived I thought made the whole experience very human and touching."
,,History come alive,4.0,,Alot smaller then we thought but well worth it with all the letters and historical photos describing the times with the Japanese occupation.Combine it with a round island tour and see it all.
,,Bit boring,2.0,,"Even though the trip was free from our travel agent, there was not a whole lot to see or do here. It is out near the airport, so about 30 minutes or so in the coach. Our guide was excellent, with oads of information to tell us about the area."
,,Wry informative,4.0,,Worth paying to get the audio tour you just won't get the same experience without it. Costs $8 each and you hire it from the gift store before going into the museum.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Very moving experience, which tells the history of WW2 which from what I was told is not taught in the local schools. For some reason Singaporeans don’t mention this part of their history, instead focusing on the present and future."
,,Worth the journey,5.0,,I found the location easy enough to get to using public transport (metro and bus) and just got the directions of the website. The place itself is right next to the womens prison . I have been to a lot of museums around the world but Changi just seemed different . It was very well put together with plenty of information even though it is relertivly small. You could get the audio set if you wanted but i prefer to do things my own way. It was a very moving experience and well worth a visit. My only negative i just thought it was a bit disrespectfull selling copies of the Japanese surrender documents. Even though I do understand places need money to operate I dont think this is the place to sell documents like that.
,,Moving Experience,5.0,,This place is quite a way out of the centre but persist. The museum is nearly all pictures and videos with some replicas of the chapel etc. The whole place is eerie and it feels like a place where man did terrible things to man. It is a very moving experience
,,A pilgrimage,4.0,,"Visiting the Changi Chapel and Museum is a pilgrimage for most Australians. Its a simple presentation & a bit hard to get to by public transport, but worth the bother & moving to visit."
,,Changi Memorial,5.0,,"Museum and chapel will affect different people in different ways, but you will be affected. Get the audio for $8."
,,Simple but effective,4.0,,"Simple but effective display. With pictures, service records, and audio tour. Easy to get to (involves one train and one bus)"
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"I lived in Australia for a few years and loved the 'Changi' TV series, which covered a group of women interned in Singapore's infamous prison.

So it was with great interest we visited the Chapel and Museum, and I have ot say the whole experience was typically Singaporean commercially correct: they completely understated the brutality of the place under Japanese rule. Presumably watered down so as not to offend the Japanese visitors.

Sellout."
,,Never fails to bring me to tears,5.0,,I never go to Singapore without paying my respects at the Changi Chapel and Museum - it's almost like an obligation now. The museum is fantastic and the exhibitions have been presented really well. The highlight of this place is the chapel. Reading the messages people have left for their loved ones is just heartbreaking. I would urge all Australians in particular to visit the museum and chapel.
,,A quiet stop,4.0,,"The Changi Chapel and Museum is a bit of a mecca for Western tourists, and you'll find a lot of white folk about in the galleries.
The displays and storyboards are well-balanced. They tell the story of POWs' mistreatment by the Japanese, but also look into the circumstances of the Japanese guards, rather than just treating them as pure evil.
It is a very small museum, and unless you've got a strong personal connection you won't want to spend more than an hour there. It takes about an hour by MRT from the city, so you need to decide whether you want to see it that much. Bus 2 stops right out front of the museum and runs right into the city. There are also buses connecting the museum with Tampines MRT where you can get a great feed at a hawker stand."
,,free entry easy to get to,4.0,,"free entry and bus right outside the front, very informative and moving, you can get a headset which would make it more informative."
,,A Humbling Experience,5.0,,"I was brought to tears by the humbling experience of seeing how others survived in captivity. It was not just the British or Australians who suffered, but Malays, Indonesians, and particularly the Chinese many of whom were massacared on the beaches.

The museum [more of a memorial] puts into perspective the complaints of our modern society.

Easy to reach from Changi Airport if you have a couple of hours transit time."
,,Small. Humble. Enlightening.,5.0,,"When I first stepped into this place I thought I would be done in like 5 minutes. Even though there are no stunning exhibits typical of larger museums, this one tells the story of WWII well. The audio tour would be worth it. After the visit, do head to the cafe next door."
,,Changi Chapel.,5.0,,The Changi Chapel is a very solemn place. The museum is not the faint hearted. It bought tears to my eyes as I walked around.
,,A Humbling Experience,5.0,,"So glad we took the time to come and visit the Museum. Surprisingly there was no fee on entry. We did pay the $8SGD for the audio tour which was very informative and interesting. Id allow about 1.5-2hours to visit. The museum tells a very somber and sad story but one that needs to be heard and remembered, I would highly recommend visiting."
,,Off the beaten track but well worth the visit,5.0,,"It was a bit of a cab ride to get there, but so pleased we put the effort in. The UK school system covers the European aspect of the 2nd World War, but very little on the African and South Asian aspects of the war are talked about. The museum is small in size, but it still took us 3 hours to do. We read everything there was to read and listened intently to the audio guide that was very reasonably priced. The museum itself is free of charge but a small donation is requested. The gift shop is very reasonably priced and was selling both relevant war history items and other less relevant but still appropriate items given it’s a war museum. I learnt a lot from the visit and was moved on more than one account. We finished our visit with a nice meal at the restaurant situated behind the museum which like the rest, was reasonably priced.

In summary, if you have any interest in history, this is a gripping and moving place to visit."
,,history,4.0,,"Very interesting for young and old, air con for museum which makes it enjoyable! Its a couple of hours of history about the WW2. Its on limb in terms of location but we tried to tie in with a visit to wet wild water park, which was closed for renos, not stated on their website though!"
,,Visit to the POW museum,5.0,,"This was a very interesting museum with the History of the fall of Singapore during the second World War and tue life tales of peoples experiences leading up to and after the capture of Singapore. It pulls no punches and brings it home to you how fortunate some of the world is today. The museum is free easily reached by Taxi from the centre of Singapore - about 14SD or if you want to be more adventurous you can get there by bus (No2) or by a combo of MRT (Train to Tampines) and bus (No49) which costs about 4.5SD.
Spent about 2and a half hours there. Lots of information clerly displayed and not too long to read thus maintaining your interest."
,,"Small place, big experience.",5.0,,"This is quite a small exhibit, and also free, but it is beautifully set out, and the guided audio tour was ($8) was excellent. It gave a tremendous view of live under the Japanese occupation. It is an area of history we can be a bit vague about - we all seem to know what happened in Europe, but perhaps not so much about the Pacific. The little chapel on the grounds is a touching and spiritual place. A really worth while experience."
,,Changi Museum,5.0,,The bus from Changi Village stops right outside the museum and there is one every 15 minutes. It was an important place for my two young children to learn more about the sacrifices made so they could live safely in Australia.
,,Lest we forget,4.0,,With the convenience of the metro and Bus2 and although rebuilt this should not be missed. Only complaint is how little of the story relates to the resident populations of the isthmus and island.
,,Informative and Moving - Unmissable,5.0,,This is an excellent museum (that is not quite the right word - it is more of a living display) with just the right amount of material to get a good idea of the fall of Singapore and the Japanese occupation and POW experience. It is essential to have the audio guide - it costs a few dollars but it is very well worth the money and it brings the exhibits to life. There is a good bookshop at the end of the tour (a must for me) and beyond that a restaurant. the lady in the bookshop very kindly phoned us a taxi. My only (slight) complaint was that the galleries were not well enough air-conditioned. A great and unmissable experience.
,,A few hours at Changi Museum,5.0,,"This is such a worthwhile place to visit to relate the history of Singapore under the Japanese occupation in WWII. As an Australian I found it quite moving, reading of the hardships suffered by all those under occupation but eventually the triumph of the human spirit. We used an audio-guide with headphones for about S$12 for a couple. The museum takes about 1.5hrs to move through. Very informative and well-presented. A must to relate the horrors of war and how people overcome what seem to be insurmountable odds."
,,Very informative,5.0,,A must place to visit. Very revealing and informative and Well presented. The museum is actually free to enter but you can hire an audio guide.
,,Vey emotional place to go,5.0,,"We went on a half day tour including the Chapel and Museum. We did not have enough time to really read and look at everything. Everybody should understand the story behind Changi.
Maybe a suggestion would be to go on your own by taxi, bus or train. That way you can stay as long as you like."
,,Nice Historical Site,5.0,,"This site houses history mainly about the Japanese occupation use of the Changi prison during WWII. There is a nice alfresco pub/cafe attached to it, and can enjoy nice food, beer, under the sky."
,,A humbleing experience,4.0,,"The fall of Singapore was terrible, brutal mascacres took place and man, women and children taken as prisoners of war. What better place to visit to see this then Changi museum. Detailed accounts by inmates of the day to day life and the atrocities. Take a handkerchief and be prepared to spend the rest of the day in reflection."
,,Lest we forget,4.0,,Yes this is worth a visit if the subject interests you. It is extremely well set out and the audio makes it a very personal experience just listening to the stories and at only $8 very reasonable. I didn't find too much information around the city advertising it - so had to investigate myself. Possibly more flyers at hotels needed. Taxi ride from raffles to museum around $17 also quite reasonable. There is also a gift shop with a range of books etc. a nice area to have a drink or some lunch. Definitely recommend the museum and chapel.
,,A Place to Reflect,5.0,,"I know that this sounds strange, but this was a lovely place to visit and reflect on the horrific things that happened to the wonderful people who were in Singapore during the Japanese Invasion.
As the niece of a POW here, I had researched beforehand, but did not realise the hardships that the actual people of Singapore endured as well. To say that they all went to hell and back is an understatement, but the courage they showed that you could read about and listen to here in the quiet museum and chapel, was an amazing experience, and I would recommend a visit here to anyone interested in this sad piece of our history."
,,Heart wrenching but worth the visit,5.0,,"This place is a must if you are interested in what happened during the second world war when Singapore was captured by the Japanese.

The stories, the photos and the memorabilia are fantastic, a credit to the people who have made this museum what it is. I found that I became very emotional after listening to audio of a Singapeon lady speaking of the torture she endured and again when reading the little notes and ""post its"" from family members and friends of POWs.

This is a visit I will never forget and I am very pleased to have been."
,,Somber Reminder,5.0,,Worth a visit just to remind or educate yourself about the fall of Singapore to the Japanese and the imprisonment of allied soldiers in world war two. Very sad really but interesting as well. Either get there by Taxi or MRT to the end of the line then taxi.
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"We took the MRT and then a bus to this place. It is very well done and is a moving memorial to the sufferring of the Allied POWs. Took the opportunity whilst we were out that way to go on to Changi Village - that was really enjoyable. Lunch in the food market was great. Also, take a 'bum boat' to Palau Ubin."
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,"Very good but appropriately sober presentation. Very informative. Admission is free, but recommend the excellent audio guide, well worth the (?) 8 SGD per person."
,,Time for reflection,5.0,,"As me father was a prisoiner of war here during WW2, it was mandatory for me to make a visit. It was a great experience from a personal perspective. The museum has some excellent historical photos and other memorabillia and the chapel is also well set up. This place is a time for reflection on what total waste war produces. Very well worth a visit and should be added to other Singapore attractions."
,,Interesting history tour,4.0,,"We visited the Changi Museum as part of a round island tour with Tour East. It was quite shocking to see the photos and read of the dreadful ordeal that the POW's endured, our tour guide did a marvelous job sharing the history of the Changi prison. The chapel is lovely, take your time strolling through it's a very somber quiet place for reflection.
There is also a open air restaurant onsite, we did not eat there but it is worth mentioning that it looked great and was quite busy at the time we visited (food looked and smelled delicious!)"
,,It should be made mandatory to visit this place,5.0,,"This is one of those places in the world where every person especially school children should be brought. It is perhaps akin to Auschwitz in its place in history and infamy. The stories told here are both shocking and humbling. It made me well up at times. The personal stories are incredible. The heroism of the changi prisoners and those people helping them survive truly astonishing. There are stories of torture by every means possible of electrocutions be headings crucifixions yet the men concerned never talked or gave away their comrades. Their are stories of secret transmitters of local people running the risk of torture and beheading to help the inmates. Of the solidarity of Australian, NZ, INdian, Malay soldiers all calling themselves British and being united against the Japanese some refused to give in the the Japanese by taking off their uniforms and proudly called themselves British and were therefore beheaded. The tales of living here in changi pow camp for years when a guard could kill you for no reason at all.

Some of the stories read like boys own stories of daring do, two Australian soldiers caught trying to escape were to be shot, one tried to spare the life of the other by saying he ordered his mate to escape but to no avail, the two men hugged read a passage from the bible refused blindfolds saluted smartly their commanding officers who were made to watch, they were then shot.

The museum contains a replica of the changing chapel as the original is inside the nearby barracks. The story of the murals is very touching and I was nearly in tears.

My tip is to get the audio guide as it tells you more and you can get two head phones per guide so you can share.

Give yourself about 90 mins at least to tour the exhibits. There are toilets in the restaurant next to the museum. I'm not quite sure why there is a bar next to the museum but hey I'm sure the troops would have appreciated it!

I mean this as no criticism and I direct this only at the Singapore authorities. This is a world history site along the lines of bergen Belsen aushwitz etc. I think the place deserves more development and access to the original chapel to do otherwise is not only doing a disservice to your visitors both national and international but the men women and children commemorated here! The Singapore govt really needs to sort this out!

Definitely visit changi it is mentioned in the history books, on tv, talked about, its part of world history and should be regarded as a must see."
,,A Sad Place to Visit but good for knowledge of the history,4.0,,"changi was a sad place to visit, but it was great to learn about the history. there are guides or audio options for museum tours or you can work at your own pace. the museum is very informative, clean and welcoming

in temrs of location its a fair way out - but is accessbile by train / bus. i recommened just taking a cab - it was about $30"
,,sad topic,4.0,,"the way the japanese treated their prisioners of war is doumented in great detail here and leaves no one in any doubt the horrors that they went through.
Entry is free although you do pay for the audio tour, the museum is well laid out and the exhibits are laid out for you to walk round in a circular fashion towards the chapel exit area.
got there by bus, no 2 takes you to the nearest mrt station and takes 10-15 mins, buy an E Z travel card as it is cheaper if you plan to travel aroun d abit using public transport."
,,Great Experience,5.0,,We had this as a part of an island tour including the Kranji War Cemetary. Very informative and experience worth having. Glad it wasn't me but am extremely pleased that these people sacrificed themselves like they did. Makes you very proud of our forefathers.
,,good place to gain knowledge,4.0,,"this had a special meaning for me as I had a friend that I use to work with that was taken prisoner in Singapore and spent time in Changi before he was was marched off to the burma railroad. Unfortuntely my friend has passed away now but walking through the chapel museum brought back memorys of the storys Peter told me. This I believe is a must if you have any interest in War History and a facinating place to visit, It is hard to believe human beings could actually treat other humans beings in this way. Sad history but important for people to know. I highly recommend a visit."
,,great to look around,5.0,,"for those interested go and have a look its free, just get their on the bus, no hassles from either city or most other places. Hire the Ear pieces. I like everything. this was my second time and i took a longer look at somethings. Study things and notice everything"
,,Come and see some history we all should be aware of,5.0,,A very pleasant day and well set up. Only small but some very good artifacts and stories of the people who were imprisoned by the Japanese in the second world war. A must for younger generations
,,Moving Tribute,4.0,,"Historical Sight and a good way to honour the brave and get a sense of the history. Quiet, peaceful and thought provoking."
,,Time to remember,5.0,,"The Museum was closed for renovation on my previous visit to Singapore some years ago much to my disappointment.
A moving experience that will provoke deep thought in those who take the time to visit the museum.
Access from our East Coast hotel appeared time consuming on the bus or train so we opted for a taxi. There is no taxi outside for the return trip, so either ring for one inside the museum or if you are lucky, as we were, grab one dropping someone off."
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,Our guide was fantastic. I learnt so much about Singapore but would have loved more time at Changi to read more. Highly recommended to anyone who has an interest in the beginnings and history of Singapore.
,,Good for History,4.0,,We visited here after having been to the Kanchanaburi region of Thailand to see some of the 'death railway'. Visiting Changi was a good closure to see where the prisoners had come from and where a few returned. The museum offered an audio tour which was quite interesting. We enjoyed the visit.
,,A well set out museum,5.0,,This is the 3rd time I have been here and each time I find something new.The audio tour is interesting and definitely the way to go.Gives a fantastic overview about a horrific part of Singapore's history.
,,A little disappointing,3.0,,For those travellers who do not know the story of Changi POW camp during WW11 this may have been Ok but as I am a 'history buff' I was disappointed- the real chapel is rebuilt in Canberra at the National War Memorial. However the taped history is very good to listen to.
,,A poignant reminder!,4.0,,"Visited the Changi Chapel and museum whilst on a stopover at Singapore. Its worth noting that if you have a couple of hours and dont want to go into the city, the chapel is only a 10 or so minute ride from the airport.
The chapel is free to enter and depicts the horrors of the Japanese occupation of Singapore in the war and the subsequent imprisonment at Changi of many POW's."
,,Don't miss this,5.0,,The museum is somewhat small but I could have spent hours there. Great collection of memorabilia from the Japanese occupation of Singapore. Memories written by survivors of that time were touching and comprehensive. The replica of the original chapel built by prisoners of war is well set out as is the rest of the museum. The small but comprehensive bookshop is well worth a visit.
,,Interesting,4.0,,"The popular accounts of the Pacific Theater in WWII do not include much about what happened in Singapore. This museum gives a very good description of a subject about which I knew little. It especially provides a fine and compelling account of life in the prison camp. The location is a little out of the way. If you are a little adventurous, you can use the bus. Otherwise, you will need to grab a taxi to get there."
,,A Tribute To Those Who Suffered During The War,3.0,,"Changi Chapel And Museum is a tribute to those imprisoned in Changi during World War II. Changi Chapel And Museum houses a collection of artwork and items by former prisoners-of-war (P.O.W.).

Of the highlights at Changi Chapel And Museum, the Changi Murals are the most well-known. A set of 5 paintings by Stanley Warren, the Changi Chapel And Museum houses a replica of these paintings in a re-created church interior.

At the centre of the Changi Chapel And Museum stands a replica of a Chapel, housing the Changi Cross. An original artifact, the Changi Cross is a brass cross, made by Harry Stogden from an artillery shell.

The Changi Chapel And Museum also pays tribute to the lesser known women interned here. This includes the Changi Quilts exhibit, and the paintings of Mary Angela Bateman in the War Time Artists exhibit.

If you're planning a visit, do note that while admission is free, a guided tour / audio tour costs $8, and is a more meaningful experience. Allocate between 1 to 2 hours for viewing."
,,A moving experience,4.0,,"this had special significance for me as my great uncle was a POW in Changi. However, friends who also visited also enjoyed (if that is the right word) the experience. A simple museum, which serves as a powerful reminder of what happened. Worth a visit and taking an hour or so to wander through."
,,Quaint,4.0,,It is pleasant to visit this single storied building. There is so much history here. A reminder of the need to defend one's country.
,,Moving experience,5.0,,The area is easy to reach by metro and a short walk. I visited to honour my father who was taken prisoner by the Japanese 70 years previously and was able to take part in a commerative service the first time I went. When I went back 3 weeks later there were no crowds and the peace of the site was very moving. The staff were helpful and pleasant though not very easy to find initially. It is worth the trip
,,Interesting,4.0,,loved the idea of looking at history ; yet in parts it was very hard to listen too... as in what actually happened by people who were there
,,Great History told!,5.0,,"This was very informative but it was a shame they moved the POW Cemetary to the otherside of town, we had a relative that died here and it was sad to know they had moved him without letting families know"
,,So memorable and glad I visited there!,5.0,,"It is free to get in but they offer you an audio programme at £4 each or £3 each if you share. If you have the money, I would recommend it as it makes your experience. The audio provides extra information and gives you the personal touch. The staff were very friendly and informative. Takes around 2 and a half hours using the audio. The muesum was incredible and moving. The muesum is in a excluded area so you will need to book a taxi for your way back as there will be no waiting. Also, there is a restaurant next to it if you get hungry or its lunch time. One of the best muesums ever!"
,,Very Moving,5.0,,"There isnt a whole lot to see here but every Australian should visit to learn about the incredible sacrifices our soldiers made for us and our country and to pay our respects to them for that sacrifice.
My dad was one of them, he spent 3 years in that hellhole.
I found it very moving. (Thanks dad xx)"
,,A little disappointing,3.0,,"A little disappointed there wasn't more to it in truth, I was expecting a lot more, though the museum was interesting. A little difficult to get to (certainly if you're on your own - taxis aren't cheap in Singapore) and whilst I'm pleased I went, I can assure you you're not missing much if you don't make the effort."
,,A moving experience,5.0,,"This was a very moving experience for us, but well worth the visit. Get the audio experience if you go."
,,Reminders of a dark past,4.0,,"The prison is now gone but the museum that remains provides a stark reminder of the brutalities of war. There are sufficient displays to give you a good picture of what life was like and it is quite sobering. Not a happy place, but very glad we visited."
,,Very moving experience,5.0,,Until i visited Changi Chapel and Museum I had very little idea of the agony the Singaporeans went through during WW11. It was a truly humbling experience
,,Very sad,4.0,,Excellent museum that shows the horror of Japanese occupation of Singapore. The stories are heart breaking.
,,ok,3.0,,A long way out for little gain although interesting it wasn't really worth the effort to get there
,,very moving,5.0,,the tour guide was excellent she gave us plenty of information and a time to havea a wonder around at the end well worth a visit makes you reflect on sucha tragic time in singapores history
,,A good learning experience,5.0,,"I had never learnt all that much about WW2 coming to Singapore at school, but I learnt a lot the day I went to Changi Museum. It was good to pay respect to those that lost their lives."
,,Excellent museam showing what happened in WW2,5.0,,"An small but amazing museam dedicated to what happened during WW2 and all the attrocities that the Japanese subjected their captives too in WW2.

For anyone remotly interested in history this is a must and even if you are not it is a sobering reminder of what happened only a relativly short time ago.

Its not in central Singapore but easily accessible via MRT and bus."
,,Do not miss this.,5.0,,We took a trip with the Original Singapore Walks on the 'Changi Museum War Trails - Changi WW11'. This organisation and its tour guide are exceptional. It was a very moving experience.
,,Moving,4.0,,This is a very moving experience and you realise just what the people of Singapore and the troops went throught during the war.
,,Very moving,4.0,,Allow about an hour here. The audio tour costs about $16 (Singapore dollars) but well worth it. From Chinatown it took us about an hour or so to get there using train and bus.
,,Not to be forgotten,4.0,,"Worth the travel out from the city, its a stark reminder of the past and shows how difficult survival was during WW2. We couldn't find the right tour...but the taxi from town actually works out far cheaper and quicker. the taxi driver on the way back was probably better than any guide we could have booked (lucky I guess). Expect to pay approx SG$20 each way.

Audio tour is a must (its just a few dollars)."
,,A moving experience,5.0,,"We learnt for the first time the good and bad about the conquering of Singapore by the Japanese during WW2 and we certainly learnt many lessons plus what all nationalities resident in Singapore had to endure. It is well worth dedicating a couple of hours to visiting and viewing the exhibition.

We were disappointed that we had to make an extra effort to find where the museum was and arrange transport."
,,sad but splendid,5.0,,"An excellent touristexperience, one that goes beyond the military experience and also showsthe civilian suffering. Well worth a visit"
,,Very informative,5.0,,"I did the audio tour which was definitely worth the $6 or so. It was interesting and wasn't over the top with the reading. If you have an interest in the second world war or want to learn more then go here. its a bit of a trek to get there from most places but the transport is reasonably easy to use, so i say do it!"
,,Terribly sad and a haunting experience.,5.0,,Wouldn't have missed it for the world although this prime example of man's inhumanity to man is sometimes hard to bear and I found myself - as did my partner - in tears on more than one occasion. Incredibly moving and a sobering thought that it all happened in the same decade in which I was born. Not long ago at all...
,,Lest We Forget,5.0,,"The history and personal accounts are very moving. This is a must do on any trip to Singapore. There is no entrance fee, and is a short S$12 taxi ride from Changi airport."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"This was an interesting museum and I suggest you buy the audio tour as it adds plenty of extras to the static displays. The stories provided a depth to the history and I came away with a good feel for both the horror that the war must have been, and the strength and resilience of the people that endured it."
,,Great piece of history,4.0,,"Tells the period during the war after the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. Lots of memories... food at the cafe good too. Recommended at least once for locals, and tourists."
,,Changi Chapel and Museum,4.0,,"I am a WWII history buff, and had seen the National Museum section on WWII on a previous visit as well the Ft. Canning bunker. I chose a tour that included the museum; we had about an hour, which was sufficient. They have a small gift shop that I appreciated (and purchased a shirt and four or five pins). Well worth the time."
,,Must visit for all those who sacrificed for our future,5.0,,"This was really on my husband's list to see and I thought I was their for the ride, but I was caught of guard and really felt moved by the experience. You must get the voice commentary as well. Please go"
,,Informative,4.0,,"It's free to enter, although we paid for the audio tour, which was money well spent as it contained lots of information and interviews which really brought the exhibits to life. I did not know very much about Singapore during WWII so I found my visit to the museum informative. We ate at the cafe located next to it, and the food was nice."
,,A very moving emotional experience.,5.0,,"This is a ""must do"" for all visitors to Singapore. We took a taxi from our hotel and took the audio tour.Returned by taxi also. If you wish to book with a tour company, you must wait until 10am on the day of your intended trip to be notified if they have enough numbers to do the tour, so, go independently and it is inexpensive and hassle-free."
,,A good museum to visit,4.0,,"This is a well kept and modern museum, free entry, about 20 mins taxi ride from the city. It tells the story of the WW2 POWs and has many original relics. Very moving and a good reminder of the suffering which took place in what is now a very modern city. To get back to the city is not straight forward, best bet is to flag a cab down on the street outside. Look out for the original prison walls and gateway still standing in front of the modern prison, you pass it on the right just before arriving at the museum."
,,Moving and Very Interesting,4.0,,My parents were visiting me from the UK and my Dad wanted to do this. It was very interesting and very moving and I recommend it to anybody who wants to hear what went in Singapore during the second world war. It's horrific but very interesting.
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,Very moving especially if you are from a country that was involved in this part of the war
,,Nice museum,3.0,,This isn't the actual chapel but a recreation. The museum is quite small and the displays are interesting. It's quite a long trip and would probably only we worth it if you're interested in war history.
,,very moving experience,4.0,,"My husband and I both had grandparents captured in singapore,so felt this was a must do. So glad we did it was a very moving experience.We spent quite some time reading the many letters etc . We chose to go by taxi and were glad that we did because a few of the tour buses that arrived just seemed to move everyone on quite rapidly,it is a place to spend some time and reflect."
,,Japanese occupation of Singapore,4.0,,A very informative and poignant visit ! and is free! Should be followed up with visit to Fort Canning bunker and Fort Siloso!
,,A Place of Reflection,4.0,,"Having viewed this years ago in its origional place, I find this a little disappointing it has lost something in the move, to me it is a place to reflect on the futility of war, my husband is a veteran of the Vietman war, and I find these places very moving, I take advantage to light a candle for soldiers departed and our youg soldiers of today on deployment."
,,Moved me to tears ...,5.0,,"Very moving to read messages and letters left by visitors to relatives (that some had never known) as a mark of respect.
In the museum there is an interesting patchwork quilt made by wives of prisoners which has secret hidden messages to their husbands -(obviously no other way of comunicating). One wife told her husband he had a baby son. Girl power 1942 style!"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Quite a distance from the city center but interesting to see what Singapore went through in the WWII. Everything nicley presented.
,,A PLACE FOR REFLECTION,5.0,,"I had seen film footage and read about the horrors of the war in Singapore. Nothing could have prepared me for the information contained within the Museum. Amazing photographs, personal accounts and stories of lives affected, punishment for locals found helping prisoners etc. Finishing at the Chapel was a moving experience. I didn't dislike anything, other than to say it's unbelievable what any human being can endure."
,,thoughtful and moving...,5.0,,"Most people know Changi, a thoughtful and moving experience, but do something joyful afterwards"
,,Really informative and well worth a visit,5.0,,"I visited this museum with family and we all thoroughly enjoyed reading more about Singapore's history, and the very brave residents who survived and died during this sad period in their history. I spent a good 2 hours at the museum and with the hire of the head sets I felt that I had had a really informative history lesson and we must never be allowed to forget to bravery of the Sngaporeans who gave their lives to make this the great country it is today."
,,A reverent and relevant place to visit .....,5.0,,"We visited here on ANZAC day 2012 and were deeply moved by the tales of sorrow and war within its walls. Whilst not a large museum, it nonetheless has a very powerful story to tell. And it does it very, very well."
,,A Humbling experience,5.0,,A bit hard to get to - reccomend a taxi but you get a real feel for waht the locals and teh soldiers went through. Despite teh barbaric treatment they kept their chins up. Somethign here for everyone as almost every nationality was impacted .
,,Very emotional,5.0,,"This was one of the main things we wanted to do whilst visiting Singapore having had family members as POW and who were made to work on the Burma railway.
I recommend that you pay for the audio set-S$8 each, to listen to whilst going through as you hear from the survivors what it was like to be a POW.
All I can say is thank you for giving your lives so that we can live the lives we have today."
,,Terrific and important Singapore history,5.0,,"After many visits to Singapore, we finally took the time to take a taxi out to Changi Chapel and Museum. We have been to many WWII historical places and this is world class. Excellent exhibits with a great audio recorded tour, so moving, and such an important part of Singapore, British and WWII history. Highly recommended!"
,,Mijnd blowing,5.0,,never realised till we went there exactly what had happened
,,Disappointed,2.0,,We were disappointed with our the Chapel& Museum - a long way out of singapore - $ 25 in a cab one way - Not really much to look at. I think the Australian / British & Singapore goverments could do a much better job
,,Unforgettable experience,5.0,,"We were so engrossed in our visit that the staff had to ask us to leave at closing time! The audio tape is very interesting, as are the innumerable displays, photos and video accounts by survivors of the horrors of the war. Don't leave Singapore without a trip here!"
,,A Real Eye openner,5.0,,"Superbly maintained and very poignant to see so many fallen from all over what was then the British Empire English, Scots Indians Australians all represented and bring home the enormous sacrifice made by all these heroes. From the top a lovely vista of Singapore very peaceful indeed"
,,A wonderful memorial to a stressful time of Singapore History,5.0,,Be prepared to spend several hours reading and exploring the amazing records of this sad period in the Singapore history. This was a very moving and emotional experience which was assisted by the excellent audio tool.
,,Great History lesson,4.0,,"This museum does a very good job of reviewing what happened to Singapore when it fell to the Japanese on Feb 15, 1942, and then how the people limped along until the Japanese surrendered 3 years and 8 months later. While it's not the prison that was used during the war, the photos and relics are enough to give you the idea of what it was like. I highly recommend the acoustiguide tour for the museum, just to get the full effect of what happened here. I admire the way all people who fought for Singapore heralded here. Think twice about young kids, however, because some of the photos are rather graphic."
,,Harrowing Experience,4.0,,As is the case with any war museum visit this is a harrowing experience. Wandering your way through the Changi museum you get a real insight into what happened in the war and the terrible experiences people were subjected to. Its a real reminder of how precious life is and how pointless wars really are. Thoroughly reccommend this to anyone interested in the history of singapore!
,,A place of peace,5.0,,worth going to see to remember the suffering of the POWs and the native Singaporeans
,,Emotional,4.0,,"Our guide, Helena, had an extensive knowledge of Changi and Singapore's part in WWII. Her ability to tell the story made this an unforgetable experience."
,,Sobering,3.0,,"Anyone with any knowledge of WW2 and what happened in Singapore and in particular to those captured should try to get here for a look. It puts history you may have read into perspective. Worth the time, and very sobering in outcomes. If you're into war history couple the visit here with one to the Kranji War Memorial."
,,very moving experience.,5.0,,A wonderful window into our history. every person who values their life should visist this place
,,Changi Chapel and Museum,4.0,,Well worth the trip. We travelled by MRT to Tanah Merah and then via bus. The bus driver was great - he must have noticed we were trying to figure out when to hop off and he called out and put 2 fingers in the air and then 1 when we were near the Chapel. We were so appreciative. It cost a small amount to hire the headphones to listen to the description of the displays in the Museum. Just be aware that the numbering does not follow all the way down one wall but changes over half way along. This is very moving and takes a couple of hours.
,,Long awaited visit,5.0,,My 91 year old aunt had been looking forward to this visit for years. She was not disappointed. Good guides chapel as expected.
,,changi review,4.0,,This museum is worth visiting and spending quite some time reading and looking at everything. It cannot be done in an hour with a tour guide breathing down your neck
,,Very informative,4.0,,Good place to visit. Need some time to be able to read all the information.
,,So moving,5.0,,Did a 'round the island' trip & this was the last place we visited - sad to hear that the Japanese children from the local school had no knowledge of the atrocities but the chapel & museum is a fantastic accolade to all who fell.
,,Small and neat,3.0,,"Small, educational, informative. But this chapel is rather well-hidden and is near the changi prison area. Not very accessible for tourists"
,,Worth a visit.,5.0,,"Our tour guide Wui Wui was wonderful, very informative and interesting. We went with a company who ran the Original Singapore Walks, they do several historical tours. You need to book $48/$30, our 13yr old really enjoyed it. Highly recommend."
,,"Historical significance. Small museum and site, though",3.0,,there is a lot of poignant history behind this place. It is a quaint little place so it may seem like a big effort to spend time (and a rather lengthy journey) to get here from the centre of Singapore. I still went there though....for the historical signifance.
,,An opportunity for reflection and to remember the past,4.0,,A sobering experience. Very interesting and also well worth a visit. A rather sombre place.
,,Don't let the size fool you....,4.0,,"The significance of this place gives an insight of soldiers and civilians incarcerated in Changi Prison. It is amazing how something so simple can give hope to the many, something like the war chapel in Orkney Islands."
,,Need more than an hour.,4.0,,"We came an hour before the museum closed and hired the audio tour after being told an hour would be long enough. It is if you do not want to read anything, and we missed out on the last section which was disappointing."
,,everyone should visit.,5.0,,"This should not be missed though it will take a little bit of effort to get to, it wasnt difficult. Its a very moving place which is a very important part of the history of what happened and how terrible the suffering was not only for the British Servicemen but the local population as well. I think if anything there should be more made to highlight the dark days that occured so that we do not forget what debt we owe and I would like to see something more in the central museums to highlight this period to more passing tourists so that they understand."
,,Excellent Insight,5.0,,"We took the Number 2 bus from New Bridge Street. The 1 hour journey for such a low fare was a great tour of the real city and much better value than a sight-seeing tour. The modern Changi Prison is an incredible site from the top-deck of the bus.

The museum is a sobering insight and if you have any interest in history, colonial and wartime, this is a must-see."
,,Wartime History,4.0,,"Visiting the site of the infamous Changhi Prison with the museum and chapel, setting out the narratives of experiences makes you very aware of the immense cruelty and suffering of our fathers and grandfathers in defence of Singapore and south east Asia. It is a must see for anyone with recent historical interest"
,,Harrowing but unmissable,5.0,,"A must for anyone with a feeling for 20th Century history. Even though you know roughly what to expect, when confronted by the details you are moved to tears. Take the bus for a scenic tour of Singapore."
,,Second world War Museum,5.0,,It gave a clear and frightening picture of the situation in Singapore during the war
,,Sad History of Changi,5.0,,A small memorial but very touching. You can do the tour in about 2 hours and there is a cafe next to it but quite expensive.
,,Very moving,4.0,,"We caught the no 2 bus from Peoples Center to Changi a good 30 min ride they run very frequently. The museum was very moving, we should never forget what those people endured.It is a lovely memorial.The restaurant at the front of the museum is a bit of a catch. expensive and average, it is only a few minutes further on the Changi Village to get more for your money"
,,Felt it could be a bit better,3.0,,"We have a family connections with Changi and so we were keen to go there and try are get an idea of what life was like as our relative never wanted to talk about it. However I could not help but feel that the museum was a little disappointing. Much of what is on offer takes the form of little quotes typed up in the various sections. The audio tour ($6) essentially reads out these quotes and the rest of the information on the walls and you don't really need it. The order of the museum also seems quite muddled jumping from military, to civilian and back to military.

It is hard to be upset with a free museum and in truth I'm not. I just expected more and felt the cafe attached blaring out the latest chart music, pretty distasteful considering what the museum represents. I didn't leave the museum feeling massively educated about the experience of the soldier. There is very little there."
,,A must see!,5.0,,"I am a wartime history buff. The museum staff presented the Changi story without fear or favour of being accused of anti-Japanese leanings. What you see actually happened. Thankfully, people move on."
,,Very Moving,5.0,,A free museum which brings home the reality of the Japanese invasion during WW2. Well worth a visit.
,,"Faith, spirit and hope",5.0,,This is a chapel that was used by the Allied PoWs during WWII when Singapore fell to the Japanese. There is sadness and hope here. Was moved from its original site to the current site now due to development.
,,A sobering experience,5.0,,The prison chapel and museum is free to visit and well worth the time. It's a little hard to find and a little out of the way but taxis are cheap and it cost less than $10 from the airport. With stunning displays and testimonials to those that were imprisoned it's an impressive site that will leave an imprint on you
,,Returning POW,5.0,,Went with dad who was a Japanese POW captured in Singapore. He was imprisoned in Changi.
,,Everyone Should Visit,5.0,,"However much or little you know about WW11 and the defence of Malaya and Singapore and the Japanese invasion this museum is well worth seeing

It tells the story of the Allies and of what suffering the local people endured under Japanese rule

Changi chapel has been recreated and the Changi murals have been copied"
,,If you know some WW2 History and excellent Museum.,5.0,,A very emotional place to visit if you know some history of this period of time. Half a day is plenty to see it all. If you get hungry take your own lunch unless you are prepared to pay big money for a meal. Also make sure you have the correct map location.
,,"Worth a visit, but not a whole day",3.0,,"The Changi chapel and museum provide an informative overview, and several poignant stories which illustrate the role of Singapore in WWII, as well as the role of the Allies and occupiers.

Definitely visit the museum if you wish to learn more about Singapore's involvement in the second world war, if you have friends or family history that you would like to acknowledge. There are poignant and illustrative stories, as well as an art gallery of works created by prisoners of the internment camp, and Singapore residents during the occupation.

This is a relatively small, u-shaped museum. Depending on your level of interest, you may wish to spend only a few hours.

If you prefer group learning, the Singapore Walks tour company offers a guided tour. It meets at an MRT station and offers an air-conditioned bus to go to the museum, which is on the outskirts of town, near the airport and site of the internment camp."
,,Memorial of WWII,1.0,,"As an area dedicated to the souls lost during this period, it is under decorated. Most does not even know of its purpose of existence even if they know where it is. An educative destination for the young ones nonetheless."
,,A nice museum run by passionate people,4.0,,"You won't regret a visit to this museum! The people behind it are very knowledgeable and want to share stories about the Japanese occupation of Singapore hoping that it is by sharing history and its tragedies that we can build a better world. I went twice and both times felt very moved and full of forgiveness; mission accomplished, hats off!"
,,Not what I expected,2.0,,"With a long and hot bus trip, I was definitely expecting a lot more. The museum itself is quite good and gives an insight into the life and experiences of those who lived during this period. The chapel though is a replica. Very basic and dirty restroom at the rear of the restaurant attached to this and the restaurant looked rather dirty and unappealing."
,,Out of the way,3.0,,"Interesting place to head to for an hour or so if you happen to be in the area, or if you are from Australian. I say this because the location is a bit out of the way, and it mainly showcases many of the Australian forces that fought during the war. It was a good experience, but once is good enough for me."
,,Thought provoking,5.0,,"Very peaceful, thought provoking and not at all commercialised."
,,Brought me to tears,5.0,,"We took the train and then hopped on a local bus to go out to Changi Chapel and Museum, this particular day stands out in our minds as one of the most moving days we have ever had on holidays. It is a place that I believe everyone needs to visit, On the day we visited, I was prepared to be emotional but it was even more so that I thought it would be. They tell a story that needs to be told, and it is a place for the Western World to give thanks to the many brave soldiers and citizens who suffered and lost their lives.

Afterwards we caught another bus down to Changi Village, there isn't a lot there, but it was lovely to go down and see it, we had a stroll around where I bought a couple of batik dresses, and we found a bottle shop that sells spirits are much more reasonable prices that you will get at the supermarkets in the City.

Do yourself a favour if you go to Singapore, and make sure you visit the Chapel and Museum, it is definately worthy of your time."
,,Changi,3.0,,For some reason I was disappointed in the tribute to our Australian soldiers.
,,Sad but must see,4.0,,The museum should really be visited so that more people can get a feel for what life was like in Singapore during the war. Museum is free but donation box there - cold heart of you cant't leave something .
,,Quaint and well put together,4.0,,"This is a lovely museum, shop and restaurant and the displays really tell the story of Singapore during the war years. The quiet chapel is a good place for reflection at the end of the exhibition."
,,Moving,4.0,,Small Museum and a recreation of one of the chapels from the notorious Changi POW camp.
,,Heartbreaking!,5.0,,A horrific story told with dignity and compassion. Very impressed.
,,lest we forget,4.0,,"pro: small chapel that brings memory back or at least historical side of world war II for understanding about heroes on the front line. poppies and postcards that interesting to be read.
con: bloody miles away from downtown. take bus nr 2 to direction changi village might can help."
,,Very poignant and well done museum,5.0,,"I thought it was a really well put together museum, very interesting and particularly meaningful for some of us with relatives who were held there in WW2. But those who had no connection to it still enjoyed it. It's very humbling and makes me feel lucky to not have been alive at that time.
A short bus ride to Changi Village which has good/cheap local dim sum places and the pier to get boats to Pulau Ubin – a good combined day trip."
,,A very worthwhile hour or so on a rainy afternoon,4.0,,"My husband and I were staying nearby at the Changi Village hotel. We were recommended to stop in from our cab driver who was a passionate history buff. W e also found several native Singaporians to be quite proud of their history, and specifically mentioned their role/circumstance related to World War II. So although not my typical interest I did feel encouraged to go. The museum is small, it takes about an hour to go through it. I believe the entrance fee was complimentary. They charge for the audio head set tour, which I found completely worthwhile. A little sheepish to say, but I did not know the experience that this country went through in the world at all. It was a nice lesson in some history for me, and I think the museum does a good job in presenting the information. Nice staff here too."
,,So sad,5.0,,Being an Australian I found this so sad. to think human beings could do this is disgusting
,,Very Sombre,5.0,,Everyone on the bus trip was moved and very quiet I don't think I would go back as I was so upset at seeing the photos and reading what was done. Even when we left everybody on the trip were quiet and some as upset as me.
,,Worth the time,5.0,,"Great, but you need time. We went on an organised tour and there was not enough time to see all this memorial has to show. Allow more than 1 hour."
,,Small but worth going to,4.0,,"From downtown Singapore you need to take the East (greenline) Undergorund to Tanah Merah and then the number 2 bus to get to this museum. It takes about 45mins to get there but is not difficult.
The museum is free but if you want to take an audioguide - we did and recommend it - there is a charge of SGD8 for 1 person or SGD12 for 2 people sharing.
The museum is quite small but the atmosphere is moving with the photographs and audio understated and poignant.
The Changi chapel is a replica but well done. There is a board where you can write comments or dedicate a personal note (SGD1 charge but ok). It was interesting and emotional reading some of these notes.
We have visited the Burma-Thai railway musuem outside of Bangkok which was more detailed than this museum but both are worth a visit especially,if like me, you had a close relative who fought in WW11."
,,"Out of the way, but worth the effort",5.0,,Very enlightening historic museum. Also very moving
,,A moving experience for all touched by the war in the PAcific,4.0,,"The Changi story is a well known part of the Australian and Allied history. The museum and chapel provide a poignant reminder the sacrifices made by those who served. The chapel, even relocated, seems to carry the aura of those who first established it.

The museum provides an interesting set of story lines, including the war in the Pacific, the life of those imprisoned, and of non-military inmates.

Overall worth a visit, and a tour guide with a good understanding of the history really enhances the experience."
,,An absorbing hour!,5.0,,"The museum is simply but effectively designed to give visitors a memorable experience. I found the displays absorbing and my visit has since encouraged me to read more about the tragic wartime experiences which Singapore had to endure. The journey from Clarke's Quay took over an hour using the RMT and the No 2 bus, but was worth it. Highly recommended!."
,,An emotional time,5.0,,We made a special trip to visit the museum and spent a few hours there. It was educational and poignant. Well set out and accessible. An important place for us as a family and we weren't disappointed.
,,Worth the journey,5.0,,We caught public transport here - very easy. The audio guides are a must have as there's so much detail to absorb. Very Australian flavour to the museum. Catch the bus out to Changi village afterwards (10 mins)
,,"A ""Historical"" Site",3.0,,"This Museum is located not too far from the Changi Prison, which still stands on the ground where the old prison cells were, of course the premise occupies more land than before. The Museum is a small hut, and if you are expecting something grand, you might be disappointed. That said, it is a place where visitors learn what were done to the Prisoners of War during the Japanese Occupation Period, needless to say by the Japanese soldiers. You might find it a very sad place to visit...

O, by the way, just sometime back, a cafe has been running near the Chapel...convenient, I would call it, but made the place lose its touch of value...just my personal opinion."
,,"One place well worth visiting to know more on WW2, the British and Japs, the locals who braved the wars, the atrocities at Chang",4.0,,"If you happen to be in Singapore and you've got some spare time to kill, make your way to this small but very authentic WW2 museum that provides many authentic experience and intimate knowledge about the war, struggles and pain of the POW. After that, either head to Bark Cafe for a meal or quick drink to quench that thirst or head down to the Johore Battery - the giant gun that was built to defend SG from the Japs which was never fires - and now houses a bistro and restaurant."
,,Worth the trek out to Changi for,4.0,,"Cracking little museum that's well worth the trip from the centre of town/where ever you're staying in Singapore. Interesting exhibits/anecdotes from people imprisoned there/involved, and a good experience to learn more about what happened in SG during the war for people with little prior knowledge."
,,Nice cafe style food,4.0,,Right outside the chapel is the Bark Cafe which serves good qulaity meals at a reasonable price. Been there a number fo times adn have not been dissappointed. Love the Club Sandwich and the Lime Juice
,,Very Sombre Experience,4.0,,"Hard to say it was enjoyable as it is a very sad place. Although I am glad we went as it is an important part of history. We went on a tour booked through Viator, our tour guide was Carol Dragon. Carol was an amazing guide bringing life to the war in Singapore."
,,Very enjoyable attraction with just the right level of information.,5.0,,"I found this attraction very enlightening. The audio tour is inexpensive and well worth getting. I particularly liked how the story is mainly told from the perspective of the people who lived throgh the occupation. It really brings the history alive.

You'll see a similar museum listed as part of the prison on many websites. Don't bother going there, there is nothing in the prison to see these days and you'll be turned away at the prison gate (as we found out!)."
,,Bringing me back to 40's,5.0,,"I came here with my ex only because he was an AU Navy, but turned out i was amazed with real stuff came from person brought me back then. It a should visit museum for history addict. But it's a bit far from MRT station, need to catch taxi to the nearest MRT station."
,,Can get a bus here but limited service!,3.0,,"It was worth the visit for me as I learnt about some of the terrible history that occured during the second world war by the Japanese imperial army at that time.

The photos and video/speaker system will make that clear. There is not a lot else to see in this area but there was only one restaurant open outside which was moderately priced."
,,Poignant place to visit and well worth the effort,5.0,,"This is not an easy place to get to - the MRT and then the bus. However, for anyone with an interest in WW11, you should make the effort. Definitely pay for the headphone commentary. You really get an insight into the events that lead up to the Japanese invasion of Singapore and what happened while they occupied the country from 1942-1945. As it was the anniversary of the sinking of the ships, there was a rememberance board - I did shed a sly tear.
The cafe next door is Ok for lunch too and thanks to the friendly bus driver for telling me where to alight!"
,,Decent tribute to WW II POW's and civilians,4.0,,"Visited Dec 2011. Easy to get to. Take MRT and then bus #2. The driver will kindly tell you when you've reached the right stop.

Free museum. The best , most educational part is the slide show at the beginning. Takes about 45 minutes to watch but it lays out the invasion of Malaysia very well.

You have to be patient and watch the whole thing and you get a great deal of info and the military people involved ( both Japanese and Brits ).

To get the most out of it you should take time to read each panel as it presents things chronologically .

Definitely worth a visit."
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"A moving experience, every visitor to Singapore should make the time and visit this worthwhile exhibition. Buses and train make it easy to visit. Good restaurant on site for lunch or a cool drink."
,,Moving and well worth seeing,5.0,,"I had not managed to visit the museum on my previous Singapore trip but made the effort to this time. Musuem is out of the city centre near the airport so easiest way to get there is by taxi.

Exhibition very well layed out and extremly moving. I had expected it to be very busy but even during the late morning it was quiet."
,,Must Visit in Singapore,4.0,,My father was POW in Changi and hence this was of particular importance to me. If you are interested in WW2 in the Far East then this is the place to visit. Excellent. HOWEVER they do not let you take photographs which was a real problem ....
,,History of the pacific war at its best,4.0,,I didn't know to much about the Pacific War before this visit. I now know about the what the Japanese did and who they did it to. An eye opening experience recommended to anyone.
,,Memorable,5.0,,"Had covered this part of WWII in school and uni quite extensively but was very interesting to go and see the first hand accounts. The museum was very informative, but very sad. I'm glad I went."
,,Personalises the horror,4.0,,"As well as lots of well-presented factual information about the Japanese invasion and occupation of Singapore, I found the personal reminiscences and artefacts, including the chapels themselves, gave me a much deeper understanding of the suffering, not only of the prisoners but the Singaporean people at large. We should never forget the brutality of the Japanese occupation of south-east Asia and China and memorials such as this are a wonderful way to teach the younger generations about the consequences of war.
Relatively easy to get to by public bus (even though the bus driver didn't stop at the nearest stop for me) and combine it with a relaxing seafood meal and drinks at Changi Village further down the road."
,,This is a reality check,5.0,,"I love Orchard and Chinatown and all the malls and restaurants and hustle and bustle, but this is a must to bring you back to reality. It's very poignant and moving. I'm not the sort to cry at films or the media, but if this doesn't make you think, and feel, nothing will. Lots of people mention how small it is - and that's part of the point. It's the simplicity and the fact that it's so humble, and has been presented just as it is, without the usual spin you get with everything, that really brings it all home to you. Take the time to think about Singapore's history - it didn't become a world-class city without a lot of suffering along the way."
,,Well worth a visit.,4.0,,"My wife and went to have a look at the museum as we thought it would make a change from the centre of Singapore.
We caught the train to Tanah Merah and jumped on the number 2 bus all straight forward.
We had lunch in the cafe next door which was excellent.
The museum and chapel althought on the small side is extremely interesting and moving, you could easily pass an hour or two there.
Certainly worth making the journey out there and seeing a bit of Singapore away from the centre.
Bootle45"
,,One room museum,3.0,,"We thought we'd get a look round the prison. All the info is good to read and poignant, you don't get a look round a prison. We enjoyed going on the bus to get to htis, its really easy to get around Singapore."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Really well designed museum. If you are stopping in Singapore for just a few hours, definitely swing by as it is close and will only take a couple of hours."
,,A must visit,5.0,,"This place is a must go for travelers in Singapore. It’s a memorial, indeed, a preserved monument for the ones who have fallen in the war with the Jap facists. They still keep it as it is with solid and cold walls, the chapel and the barbed fence. The tour guide is informative though. The entrance fee is not cheap but it just worths the money."
,,Small but very nice to spend an hour,5.0,,"The Changi Museum is very small and the tour leads its way in a circle round through the 5 zones and it ended at the gift shop. The area is small so the exhibitions are displayed very close together but many items are worth to see. The tour guide was friendly and had some interesting stories to tell us. It is very smart to end up in the souvenir store but the store has many items like small flags and statues, pots and pictures to buy home with a fair price."
,,Excellent place to visit,5.0,,"Add a somber note to your day, and realize the meaning of sacrifice. Very well presented exhibits. A bit off the beaten path. But at least the Bark Cafe next door is an excellent stop for nibbles & dribbles."
,,A well set up exhibit.,4.0,,"Visited Changi in respect for a relation who died on the Burma Railway. The exhibit is well set up and informative, it does leave one somewhat sad."
,,moving,4.0,,"Easy to get public bus ($2 each) to Changi which gives interesting views of Singapore away from the tourist centre. The musuem is quite small but very interesting and, we found, moving in the story it tells of the second world war experience."
,,Very Emotional,4.0,,Easy to get to via MRT. Very informative and highly emotional experience
,,Haunting memories,4.0,,"This museum centres around Japanese occupation of Singapore during the second world war. The storyboards are visual and informative, showing the lead up to the invasion, the occupation, and the eventual defeat of the occupying forces.

The brutality of that era is matched by some very human and humane stories, and some of the exhibits are a real window to the past.

Take the metro green line to the airport or to Tampines and then the bus. Go see it. It's a worthy memorial to all those who suffered.

And there's a very nice cafe to get your head back to happier times."
,,Escape the heavily touristed areas and visit the Changi Chapel and Museum,5.0,,"Take a break from the shopping in Singapore and visit the Chapel and Museum. Take a Heartlands and Changi tour which takes about 3 1/2 hours. Stops include the main streets of the Katong or Joo Chiat district, where aspects of the Straits, Chinese, Malay culture are preserved with colourfully decorated shopfronts and the reconstructed chapel and museum. There are many displays of memorabilia including letters and otgher first hand accounts of the years of internment by the Japanese during World War II. Very sad but enlighting to see what happened with the taking of Singapore."
,,"Well done, moving, worth seeing",5.0,,"This is an excellent and respectful museum to some very tragic times for the service people and civil population caught up in the Japanese invasion.
You need to make a special trip for this as its out by the airport and well away from the city centre.
Entry is free but I recommend the audio tour which was under $10 for two. A taxi would be about $15-20 but you can also get the MRT to Tampines for about $2 and taxi from there."
,,nice,4.0,,"it was a good experience to peak in the past of Singapore. kind of a heart-felt place. it's pretty far though, located in Changi but easily reached by bus."
,,Very moving,5.0,,So glad we made the effort to visit. Beautifully laid out cemetery. Record books available to view in open safe in wall of memorial.
,,Touching,5.0,,"Spent nearly all day here as my husbands Dad was a POW here under the Japanese, very interesting and touching. Well worth the train and bus ride out of town."
,,Changi Museum,4.0,,"Very informative if you are into this type of information. Brilliant cafe on site, very good value."
,,Moving - #1 Singapore Experience - Must do,5.0,,"It took me a while to write this review. The Changi Chapel and Museum is not a very big place, it is probably the smallest war museum I have been to, but it is an inspiring journey.

Jump on the East West (Green Line) MRT to Tanah Merah Station, and when you get off you walk across the road to the bus stops, take the #2 Bus. You will know when to get off because it is the stop just after the Women's prison, down a slight hill. Also the Bus Drivers are friendly enough, if you just ask him to stop at the Changi Museum - we sat downstairs and he just gave us a nod when it was time to get off. Journey time wasn't that long and I think it came to about SGD$3.00

First thing is to spend the SGD$8.00 to get the audio tour, you can share one but honestly my wife and I preferred to walk around alone. The order of the audio tour is a little bit out of whack but it is not too bad, just walk around the exhibits looking for the numbers that correspond. Some of the first hand experiences on the audio tour were haunting.

Take the time to absorb the place, I think we were there for about 2-3 hours (I honestly can't remember I lost track of time).

For me the most moving part is at the end the outside chapel - light a candle for all those who perished - sit down and just appreciate life and where you are. I am not usually one to be brought to tears at War Memorials but this place had such an aura around it I was a mess. Even typing this now I have the tingles through my spine.

Honestly amongst all the shopping and food and entertainment in Singapore, give yourselves a few hours and go learn about it's past.

It is a place for quiet reflection - something however sadly lost of many people visiting who try to take pictures and make a lot of noise. There were some big roudy groups there but we just hung back and waited for them to move on, made it much more enjoyable."
,,Great Museum....shame about the staff,3.0,,"Had the opportunity to visit the museum last week. Whilst the quality of the displays and the audio and visual information on hand was very informative I was less than impressed by the management.

The GM and Assistant GM seem to English ex pats. I get the idea they have been 'parachuted' into their roles. They caretianly seemed very uncomfortable assisting visitors with any information or in depth understanding beyond the information on display.

For those with a deeper interest there is a very good reference library on site but, again, its really up to you to find it and access the information.

Full marks to the long suffering women at reception. She seems to do most of the work .... from telling school kids to behave through sorting out problems and taking visitors enquiries et al.

Overall, given the history of Chango and the war years this could be presented in a much better and more professional way.

Lets hope they get their act together for the 70th Anniversary"
,,Take your time to really get the feel of what is all really about,5.0,,"We are golden Oldies (65 & 70 ) and we would class this as a must to see. It is really well laid out, but be prepared to do some reading as you wonder through..."
,,Incredible but very sad,5.0,,"A part of history, we all know the story, but until you get here & actually read & listen to the people who lived though it you will never know the whole story. We were moved to tears."
,,Awesome Experience,4.0,,This was a very moving experience to see what prisoners had to encounter many years ago. Also a must visit
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,We did this trip by ourselves and saved substantially on quoted tours. Easy to access - just catch MRT to Tanah Merah Station then a bus to the Musuem (directions at the station) and you only have to pay the transport (train is about $3 and the bus is $4 - exact fare needed for the bus our buy a travel card).
,,A must,5.0,,"Get a hold of the history and develop a better world view. Don't rush through, take your time and read the info at each exhibit. The coffee place next door was good too."
,,Refreshingly objective and content-rich destination,5.0,,"The Changi Museum was just the sort of museum I like.

The main display area features a series of themes, each illustrated with large photo collages, small authentic objects from the POWs, and thought-provoking quotes from disparate points of view.

Another room features art (sketches, cartoons, paintings) created by the POWs. There is also the reconstructed chapel, but I didn't focus on that aspect.

When you consider that the museum exists to document a time of cruel wartime occupation, it is surprisingly dignified and balanced and objective. All points of view are represented. The museum provides excellent food for thought as a result.

I was in the minority not using the audio guide, and people seemed to be engrossed by the guide, but I just don't like audio guides.

I found the visit quite profound and moving, and a refreshing contrast to the brasher and flashier 'visitor destinations' in Singapore.

Museum entry is free, but there's a charge for the audio guide.

I used my TouristPass to take the MRT to Tanah Merah, and then Bus 2 to just outside the museum. I asked the bus driver to let me know where to alight. Afterwards I took Bus 2 to its termination at Changi Village and then a bumboat to Pulau Ubin. The two destinations made a lovely day out away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre."
,,I am Surprised that this attraction ranked so low .... It deserved at least a Top 20 ranking,5.0,,"Before I start this review, let me be frank upfront. I am a Singaporean (born & bred here). But I have no business dealings what so ever with anyone and neither am I paid or have any financial gain as a result of me putting this review up. This is purely me writing just bcoz I want to write abt it, share it and really nothing else.

To start .... This is attraction name has been changed to Changi Museum. I went there on 16/10/11 and brought my Taiwanese friend along. It was he who asked me if I cld bring him to our local war museum or anything something like that. If not .... I do not know it even existed.

After looking up the internet & street directory, I saw it was located in the Eastern part of Singapore. It is located in Changi/Loyang (Just beside Changi Prison) .... about 10mins by cab from Changi Airport and accessible by bus and taxi only. There is no train stations nearby.

The entrance fee is free (With a couple of donation boxes inside) .... but if u need to rent a head set (at S$8 per Adult), u can do so at the reception.

This attraction is not very big. I should say .... this is a attraction whereby u have to stop, read, look in detail ..... think .... If u just look at the images present, u can finish it in 10 mins. But looking at just the images really defeats the purpose of coming to this attraction.

Basically this attraction focused on the 3 and a half years when Singapore was under Japanese rule during World War II (WWII). It shows how Singapore fell .... the fearful 3 years which people suffered during that time .... and finally the Japanese surrender in 1945.

Basically there is nothing good about war coz (to me) nobody wins. I as a local thought I knew enough of my own country's history .... but I was so wrong!!! Our textbooks only taught us the basic stuff .... the attraction showed me more!!! There was a lot not covered by our school texts ..... I will reveal one example here (I will not reveal more coz I really want to encourage more persons to visit this place!!! Locals included!!!) ..... I was really surprised when I saw a pic of the a transmitter radio being built into the boot of a Prisoner of War (POW) ..... that pic was in the 1940s and throughout the years ..... the japanese never found them!!! There are also some gruesome graphic pics .... in fact I dare say that there were more gruesome pics (which I had seen before) but not being displayed here.

Let me also say that a lot of the memorabilia were kind donations by collectors as well as by the HEROIC guardians of Singapore during the period of time. With this .... I (Wong Khang Woei) say a Big Big Big Thank You to all of them!!!

It is a real pity that there is only these few things this generation of visitors can see. It is a real pity more given the fact that this attraction is so small in scale. I really hope there are additions here in the near future so that it really becomes a WAR museum as it shld be.

Singapore is still considered a young country with no significant history to talk of .... but this WWII period of 1942 to 1945 deeply ingrains that particular generation and definitely defines what we are today .... whether directly or indirectly.

The more I read .... the more distraught I am. To the extent that there are tears in my eyes. I had to take a break (several times) before I continue reading on.

This is definitely your usual family attraction. More suitable for visitors who are interested in history, reading, not in a hurry type of mode ..... definitely I would advise, if u have kids, it is better not to bring them here.

I can also roughly guessed (part of the reason) why this attraction is situated in such a remote part of Singapore. This is because a lot of the happenings took place here back then .... thus situating in Changi/Loyang in fact made a lot of sense.

At the end of it, I just gave a donation without thinking twice. I also saw a tourist making a donation and I walked up to him to say a basic ""Thank you"". To which he looked bewildered.

I left with a heavy heart but nevertheless thinking how important Defense is to a small country like us.

If u are staying in the city areas like Orchard road. Coming here by cab will take u around 45 mins. If u are taking trains followed bus .... it will take u around 1 to 1 1/2 hrs including waiting time. It really depends on where u are coming from.

Basically .... if u are coming by cab, all u need is to tell the driver that u wish to go to ""Changi Museum which is next to Changi Prison"" ..... That will solve a lot of communication problems.

Alternatively u can (1) Take bus No. 2 from Tanah Merah MRT Station (EW4) or .... (2) Bus No. 26 from Tampines MRT (EW2).

Please also make sure that u tell the bus drivers to inform u when he is reaching your destination. That will solve a lot of hassle.

My hear really aches when I saw that Tripadvisor gave this attraction a ""Low"" no. 38 ..... To me, this attraction bears so significance to Singapore that it should be given a ranking of at least a Top 20!!!

Last but not least .... b4 I end ..... I would like to say this .....

To al the visitors who made a donation (no matter big or small) ..... THANK YOU!!!

To all the late guardians who help defended Singapore back then ..... THANK YOU!!!

To all the present as well as the future generations of the WWII heroes ..... THANK YOU!!!

To everyone out there ..... take care and good luck!!!"
,,Incredibly moving,5.0,,"Went to Changi with an international group of folks who were in Singapore attending a conference and everyone was moved by this sacred place. It reinforced history we had seen at the National Museum. Beautifully presented with many artifacts. Those interested in WWII should also visit the ""Box"" (British bunker on Canning Hill) - fascinating place."
,,Reflect,5.0,,Worth a visit - no entry fee - but do purchase an audio around$8.00. It will take you at least 1-5 hours to go around. We stayed at Clarke Quay and it took around 30 minutes by taxi ($16.00) you can order a return taxi from the museum shop - there is a $2.50 booking fee added to your taxi fare for the return journey - very worth while visit here.
,,"If you've read King Rat, you'll be visiting this historic site.",5.0,,"First on my list to do whilst in Singapore.
Took the MRT out to Expo on the East/West line and caught a cab from there. Be sure and ask for the Chapel and Museum or you could find yourself at Changi Prison itself.
Entrance is free but the audio tour was about SGD8. The staff are very good as is their knowledge of the museum.
The exhibits are to the point, detailed and not for the squeamish, but if you are visiting Changi there's a good chance you will know the history of this place.
If you don't know about Changi it is worth a visit to see what the Allied P.O.W endured.
Many story boards depict all the aspects of what life was like in Changi under Japanese rule.
Be prepared to have a few tears, especially around the Chapel.

Take a look at our travel map, we joined TA late in life and only review the places we have been to since joining. You may wish to trust our judgment on this special place."
,,A very different place.,5.0,,"I visited here in 2010. I came for personal reasons so this was maybe more of a pilgrimage than anything else (my father was here in 1945/46).

I really didn't know what to expect. I took a taxi here, you can get a bus but taxi was quicker. The entrance is kind of weird, in a good way though. There was a wedding party outside with bride and groom etc. I guess they came to use the catering facilities or something? I don't know but it was good to see knowing what suffering had gone on here.

The original jail has gone. This is maybe a good thing. Now is a museum given over to the occupation of Singapore and the jail and it's occupants as it was during the war.

I found it very interesting and a very level presentation. Also for a relatively small location it took a long time to walk through and digest. Admittably it's not going to be for everyone but I would still suggest to go and find out about - it's impotent to what Singapore is and so it's important to go.

The cost of the museum was not great. I would think that perhaps it's not the best for young kids as this is more of a traditional museum reading and listening (there is an excellent audio tour).

If you want to avoid the museum and just got to the chapel then you can. Take some time and sit and think about what happened there.

Is it for everyone? No i think probably not. But I am very glad I went. I hope you will be too."
,,Emotional journey into Singapore's history,5.0,,"We were transiting through Changi Airport and weren’t flying out for for seven hours so we had a good 5 hours to kill in Singapore. Rather than hanging around the airport we went through Immigration (free lollies!). Being interested in the history of World War 2, I wanted to visit the old Changi Jail where the POW’s were held by the Japanese.

My step-son's great-grandfather (Les Jerram) who was a WW1 Gallipoli veteran was held there after the British surrender in 1942. He was later shipped off to the railway camp packed into railway vans with no windows or water or food all the way up to Burma. His family were always amazed how he survived it and lived well into his 80's. So I was keen to learn more about Changi.

I went to Tourist Information at Changi Airport and asked “How do I get to Changi Jail?” The lady I spoke to was most helpful telling me the only way to go to Changi Jail was to commit a crime as the old Jail is now a maximum security penitentiary! She told us that we needed to visit the Changi Chapel and Museum which was rebuilt on a different site, and gave us a map and very clear directions.

Don’t be put off, its not far from the airport if you have 3 or 4 hours between flights and if you use the excellent Singapore public transport system, it will only cost you about $3 each way. We took the Skytrain to Terminal 3 (T3) then found the Changi Airport MRT Station located at the basement of Terminal 3 (accessible by lift and escalator).

We needed to take the west bound MRT train to Tanah Merah train station (EW4) which is an interchange between the main East West Line and the Changi Airport Extension line. Single trip tickets can be purchased from the ticket machines. The price of each single trip ticket depends on the distance/number of stations + S$1 refundable deposit. With the single trip tickets, when you return them at the ticket machines (by pushing the ""return deposit"" button) you can collect the S$1 refundable deposit.

From Tanah Merah station it was a short ride on the No.2 bus ($1.20) to Changi Museum and Chapel. From the Airport allow about 40 minutes getting there and you will need at least an hour to look around the Museum (although I got engrossed and spent closer to 2 hours there!).

I learnt a lot about the fall of Singapore from the displays, and I particularly liked the audio tour with commentary from survivors. The exhibits were very good giving you a real feel for the hardships of the prisoners and the local population who suffered under the occupation.

I enjoyed a close look at the replica cross stitched blankets that the “women of Changi” sewed. (Until I visited I didn’t even know there were women prisoners at Changi, some as young as 17).

From the first hall you move into the replica Chapel. The chapel has been completely rebuilt to its original state, they even got the same ex-POW who painted the murals in the original chapel to return in 1988 and paint the murals in the new Chapel.

I would recommend anyone who visits Singapore to visit this Museum. It is not graphic and the stories are told quite factually and it is unbiased. So even folks with children can educate their kids as to some of the history of Singapore and what the Singaporeans, British, Malays, Australians and Chinese etc. went through in this part of the world about 70 years ago.

I found it a very moving experience, especially some of the exhibits from the Burma Railway. The inscribed piece of railway iron almost had me in tears.

It is free entry and you can hire an audio set for $8 or share one for a couple dollars more and get the commentary. Later we went to the Cafe next door (through the long house) and got a jug of Coke and ice (for $10) and stood outside in the cool gardens – very refreshing and a peaceful opportunity to reflect on how much people sacrificed so that we can have the freedom that we have today."
,,The darkest days in vivid n moving potraits. A tribute to those who fought for Singapore,5.0,,"A small museum but packed in enough pictures to depict the darkest days in Singapore history. Shows the imprisonment of POWs and how human spirit triumph it all. A tribute to all who fought for Singapore. For those who wish to take public transport, take bus #2 from Tanah Merah MRT station. Though it would be much faster to take a taxi."
,,Don't miss seeing the Changi Chapel Chapel and the Krangi War Graves,5.0,,"Being interested in the history of World War II, I was mopst interested in seeing the reknown Changi Chapel and Museum. I wasn't disappointed! The chapel has been lovingly restored to it original state, complete with alter and original cross, hand made from a brass arfillery shell.

The museum depicts life in Singapore under Japanese rule - what stood out was the creativity of the prisoners and their never-give-up attitrude. Numerous items of interest are on show along with a range of photos, letters and poems.

On completion, the museum shop offers a wide range of items that can be purchased. These include books, photos, post cards and nic nacs. My only complaint was my time was limited as I was parf of a tour - I would have preferred to have had more than the 45 minutes allocated. Entry cost was minimal.

To compliment the experience, I recommend a journey to the Krangi War Cemetary where 23,000 Allied Service men are buried . A very serene hill looking towards the CBD, set amonst beautiful gardens. Simply take the MRT to Krangi station and then either walk the 1.5 klm or take the bus. There is no charge for this experience.

Both are a must do!"
,,Moving,5.0,,"Very moving experience, I learnt a lot about the fall of Singapore from my visit. Easy to get to from cdb, get off mrt at ew4 tanah merah and catch bus to door."
,,Worth the trip out there,4.0,,"It's a pity the musuem is so far out of the way. It should be a must see for all visitors to learn of the atrocities and hardship of those times during WW11. Comprehensive exhibition of the history of those few years. We hired the headset which was worth it.
Probably not having the same impact as a visit to the Battle Box at Fort Canning Park ( or Kranjii Cemetery ) but worth the visit as an added education experience. Cafe next door for when you get hungry / thirsty but don't get coffee --- it's horrible."
,,Worthes to go before heading to airport,4.0,,near the prison. Understood more about sg under japanese occupation. Learn fm it and felt sad
,,Very moving - worth a visit,4.0,,"I went with my husband not expecting to be able to relate to the contents of the museum, but because everything is displayed in such a simple and 'pure' way, ie very factual and real it is very effective. It is very moving but not graphic and enables you to think about the contents in your time. It is quite small but well worth a visit."
,,Such an emotional experience,5.0,,"Anyone visiting Singapre should take the time to visit Changi Chapel and Museum, to understand what was done to the POW's and the people of Singapore and why this mut never ever happen again. I'd read a great deal on Changi, my late father-in-law was a POW there for 5 years.... but until you walk through the museum and view some of the relics of this period; listen to recordings of people who had survived the most evil experiences at the hands of the enemy you have no concept really of what they endured; or how another human being could do the things they did.

""Lest We Forget"""
,,A must to visit,5.0,,"I visited the museum before I departed from Singapore Airport. I had an evening flight so I checked my bags in earlier than caught a cab from the airport. The cab cost $10 out and about $7 to get back again.

Do not attempt to take the underground and bus from the Airport it will take too long and for the sake of $17 it just is not worth it. The taxi took about 15 mins from the airport and you can hail a taxi when you leave the museum on the main road. I did not have to wait long and I waited in the bus stop on the side of the road facing towards to the airport.

I was reading about Freddy Spencer Chapman on the way over so I got a good understanding about life under Japanese rule, but being in the mid 30’s, never fully appreciated what it was like. It will take around 45-1hr to get you around; there are lots of information to read on people’s stories, general life at the time backed up by pictures and lots of artefacts. It was amazing to see some of the things the POW’s made out of every day materials to both amuse themselves and to survive.

The paintings that POW’s, nurses and other’s did at the time to depict what was going on was quite moving and they are on display for all to see. I would recommend anyone who visits Singapore to stop by. It is free to get in but there is a $8 charge for the audio set if you want it. It really is a very moving experience to visit this place and a great educational experience too.

When you leave the museum, there is an excellent restaurant attached and I had a fantastic meal, salmon steak with veg for $17 and it was cooked superbly. It would be a good idea if anyone who visits and does fly on to get some good food at this place as the ‘sit down’ food in the airport was not the best."
,,a must to understand the history of Singapore,5.0,,"I agree with all the previous reviews & would highly recommend going. Although sad, I do feel it is a MUST see to understand what happened during WW2 in Singapore.

We took 2 trains & a bus to get to the Changi Museum. In retrospect, it would have been a LOT better to just take a taxi so that is what I would recommend instead. It took 1 hour 15 minutes EACH way by public transport. We loved the museum as it is the WW2 history of Singapore and the POW's. We got the self-guided audio tour which we highly recommend. The museum isn't very big and the audio tape really explained the the situation leading up to and then after the surrender of Singapore. We did note that all of the visitors were older folks though."
,,Lest we forget. This is a moving and emotional experience,5.0,,"One of my relatives died in Changi during World War II.

This is a moving place to visit.

There is an excellent museum which tells the Changi story.

Also, there is a chapel, where you can light a candle and pay your respects.

They have a list of the persons who were imprisoned at Changi.

Changi pays a respectful and sombre tribute to those who made the supreme sacrifice."
,,Changi Prison - A Place of Honour and Respect,5.0,,"Changi Prison is one of the unique places to visit whilst in Singapore although it isn't for everyone. If you are British, Australian or New Zealander Changi means a lot more than just a prison, it is a place where many of our soldiers died whilst in captivity under the Japanese occupation.

Every time I go to Singapore I always make a trip to the prison to pay my respects to those that died and to reflect on the hardship imposed on those that survived. It is a wonderful place, well maintained by the Singaporeans and is an excellent venue to show your children how their ancestors fought, died and survived the atrocities that abound during wars.

Take the time to wander through the exhibits and read the stories of those that were captured at the fall of Singapore and the struggles that they endured until liberated by the Allied Forces. War is not pleasant and I would not wish it on anyone but for those of us who have served and fought Changi is an inspiration to all and a reminder of why we fight.

It is well worth the effort and time to visit."
,,Very Moving History,4.0,,"We visited Changi in October 2007 whilst in Singapore for a couple of days. Although it's a little off the beaten track, it's not hard to get to on Singapore's excellent public transport system - just a short train trip and bus ride away from the city (45 minutes or so). The new museum is about a kilometre down the road from the Changi Prison which makes a useful albeit odd landmark to know when to get off the bus.

The Museum and Chapel are incredibly moving. I thought I had a fairly good understanding of the history of that part of the world during WWII, but seeing the displays and reading the stories of survivors blew me away. We walked through ourselves, although there are guided tours. The exhibitions are well labelled and would be fine to view without an audioguide but the extra information and soundtrack of soldiers and Singaporeans telling their stories was well worth the eight bucks it cost to hire a unit. Others obviously thought so as well - it's one of the few tourist attractions I've visited where everyone was observing the requests for silence and no photography.

We probably spent about two hours at the site, which was enough to see everything comprehensively and have a cool drink in the cafe afterwards. Although many tourists passing through Singapore won't have Changi on their to-do list, I couldn't recommend it enough for anyone with more than a passing interest in the not-so-distant history of this lovely city."
,,Short history lesson,4.0,,"Changi Museum is out by the airport - easily accessible by MRT and bus. Admission is free, but the earphones cost about S$10 - less if shared. It's worth the cost! If you just walk thru, it'll take about 30 - 45 minutes to take in the displays and read everything. If you also listen to the narrative, it'll be twice as long, but you'll learn so much more. My 14 year old son loved it - read everything and listened attentively. He usually hates museums. It's a bit of a ""downer,"" as you hear about the civilians and POWs' harsh treatment. The end of the gallery focuses on some of the heros, so it ends on a high note."
,,An unforgettable experience.,5.0,,"This is another must-see for those interested in World War 2 history. While most people probably see this attraction as part of a tour group, I would suggest an independent visit for those who have a vested interest in the time period.

The Museum is accessible from a taxi (~20$ SGD from the city center) or the MRT with a stop at Tanah Merah then a short trip on the #2 bus.

Entry to the museum is on the left as you walk into the main building. Admission is free and worthwhile as such. However, they also offer an audio guide which I would highly suggest as it has numerous personalized stories, many told from the past prisoners themselves. Quotes from Lee Kuan Yew and Winston Churchill (fig 1) adorn the entry wall on the left which gives a good idea of how seriously this country takes the subject matter.

An interactive digital display to the right of the quotations provides a good overview of the events leading up to the invasion of Singapore in 1942 and subsequent surrender of the Allies. You could spend anywhere from a few minutes to an hour here depending on your knowledge of the time period.

From here, the audio guide takes one on a clockwise tour of the museum, providing a comprehensive overview of the time period focusing on the occupation. There are 25 stations on the audio guide which were all very, very well done. I can still recall several of the personal stories a week later, they really stick with you. The tour ends at the chapel in the center courtyard (fig 2), a reconstruction of those which originally were found in the prison.

As an aside, I found the fact that there were numerous Americans imprisoned with the Allied forces (fig 3) interesting, as I assumed they had no involvement in the Far East outside of the Phillipines.

A visit here is essential for understanding the history of Singapore and therefore the country itself."
,,CHangi War Museum,5.0,,"This beautiful museum has been set up as a memorial to those who suffered and died during the 2nd World War.

The museum is situated just outside the present Changi Prison and not far from the Changi Airport.

Admission is free, but you need to pay for a self guided tour. Looking back I really didn't need the self guided tour - the exhibits are self explanatory You need about an hour or two to do the museum justice.

I learnt so much! I knew that Australian soldiers were involved (my great uncle died there) but I had not understood the involvement of the local people and how they suffered -in particular the ethnic Chinese.

The museum is very easy to get to by public transport - train to Tanah Merah and then the number 2 bus, or you can get the number 2 bus from Victoria Street in the central down town Bugis area. My bus diver alerted me when we were at the stop."
,,Very emotional Visit,4.0,,"Visited the Changi Chapel & Museum whilst in Singapore recently. Both my husband and I found it very emotional and were reduced to tears immediately quite unexpectedly.
Definitely worth a visit to appreciate some of the history of Singapore and what the Singaporeans went through, as well as the Australians, Chinese, British etc.

Excellent Museum which really made you appreciate being Australian.
Then caught taxi into Changi Village itself, which has a reasonable beach but not much else there. Wouldn't recommend going into Changi itself."
,,Lest we forget.,4.0,,"I live in Sydney Australia and my father survived over 2 years working on the ""death railway"" in WW2.
On the way home from a resort holiday, my wife and I & two daughters (11 & 13 ) spent two days in Singapore.
Eager to learn more about what my father had experienced during the war we visited the Changi Chapel & museum.
Catching a taxi from Orchard Rd we arrived within 40 minutes at the museum. The taxi driver agreed to wait for 1 hour as the museum was ""quite small and this was all the time we would need"".
Admission is free and guided tours (at a small cost but recommended) are available.
The video story of Elizabeth Choy ( a nurse who was tortured for giving assistance to injured POW's ) was very moving.
We then spent two unforgettable hours as the guide explained events leading up to the invasion of Singapore, the origins of the work Changi, background information on the feats of courage and survival shown by the POW's.
The opportunity to write a message in the visitors book gave our children a chance to continue some family connection with an impotant part of world history.
We had a most moving and unforgettable experience !
We purchased some historical books and post cards to allow us to contnue to learn and understand what life was like in the 1940's for prisoners.
A must see for anyone with a family member who was affected by the invasion of Singapore.
Highly recommended - an experience not to be missed.
We returned to the city by Taxi at a total cost of $60 (including 2 hrs waiting time ). The Changi Chapel experience provides a spiritual contrast to the remainder of the afternoon spent shopping in Singapores modern temples of consumerism."
