There are plenty of restaurants to coose from. From Michelin star restaurant like Whitegrass and cheap pizza joints. But avoid the very expensive and bad serviced Lei Gardens Chinese restaurant.

It has a lot of different types of food and tapas so you can enjoy a business drink or tapas. Some of the restaurants are really great and friendly, others I feel are just taking advantage of the location and don't feel the need to have good service.

You can't really go wrong here, so go enjoy a game at one of the pubs, or after work drinks at another place with some satay chicken!

***PRO TIP: Go between 5pm - 9pm for Happy Hour drinks and save some cash! Drinks are expensive here."

If you are into building photography and or selfies, this is definitely a No.1 spot."

Chijmes is a haven to enjoy day or night, and an opportunity to relax in beautiful surrounds."

If it had been busy there may have been an excuse but there were only 2 other tables with diners and they all had their meals. What a disappointment!!!"
,,A hip and trendy convent.,4.0,,This current restaurant and entertainment venue is a far cry from its origin as a convent and orphanage.

This unique setting provides some splendid architectural features and is a good place to enjoy a meal at some point during your stay in Singapore.
,,"Popular, romantic, fun",4.0,,"After an early dinner at Lei Garden, we took an evening stroll through the busy Chijmes compound. We were surprised to discover how popular Chijmes has become since our last visit. We understand that the entire city block was a school (Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus Middle Education School) until 1983. The architecture of the chapel and school buildings is dramatically lighted, and there are many open areas for strolling or sitting. In addition to the ground level, there is a basement level for restaurant and bar tables, making the grounds look even more densely packed. The night time setting is so lovely that we intend to visit another restaurant (haven't picked one yet) at Chijmes just to be able to enjoy the festive evening environment and to return to our hotel through the City Hall MRT station."
,,The Place to Be,5.0,,"If you're ever wondering where to eat and need insperation, look no further than Chijmes.

,,Brilliant Atmosphere,5.0,,"I visited Chijmes after watching Crazy Rich Asians and trust me, it's a place worth going. It usually gets crowded at night but the view is truly spectacular.

,,Lively outdoor eateries and bars,4.0,,"This former convent school has been tastefully converted into restaurants and bars, on two layers with a sunken area. Obviously your dining experience would depend on where you ate and I cannot recall where my friend and I ended up for food and wine but we were outside in a convivial atmosphere. Its charming and set away from the city hustle and bustle."
,,Insights to old SG,5.0,,"As Raffles hotel is currently rebuilt, this place provides currently the best insight into the colonial history of SG. At night it is just wonderfully illuminated. Clearly worth the trip and maybe a drink or two..."
,,Beautiful & enchanting,4.0,,"If you do not know about it you won’t be able to make out what it encloses inside. As you enter the compound you are completely bowled over by the stunning & imposing architecture of the church building and the surroundings. The huge open spaces around the central structure highlight its grandeur although the day we visited it was all occupied by seating arrangement made to watch FIFA 2018 quarter finals on huge television screens.

There are many F&B outlets serving various cuisine and all were overly crowded. We went to Giardino Pizza Bar & Grill. They have the option of outside seating as well with nice view of the church. The service was quite fast inspite of huge rush and the preparations were tasty & portions big."

,,Pity it's one Big Bar,3.0,,"This I a beautiful old complex of buildings with lots of history and character associated with the growth of Singapore over three centuries(now).
A few years back it was a mixture of shops and restaurants. Now it seems to be wall to wall bars and restaurants - not that I have anything against them and there are without doubt some good places there to eat and relax, but it just seems to be a huge fall from grace(literally) to be a huge 'pub'.
Worth a visit to see these historic buildings and worth a visit to eat. if you want(plenty of choices, as I say)."
,,Plenty of character,4.0,,I regularly take the opportunity to walk through Chijmes when I get a chance. The structure remains a beautiful building and definitely worth a visit.

,,When you’re too old for Boat Quay....,5.0,,"When you’re too old for the very loud and buzzing Boat & Clarke Quay, and would like to actually hear what your dinner companion is saying, and are too aged and ugly to be of interest to 23-year old Australian backpackers downing shots, Chijmes is the place for you (and me).
It’s a gorgeous, colonial market place, all stucco columns and arched walkways and lovely courtyards. It has probably 30 restaurants, ranging from the cheap & cheerful Indochine, a hugely successful asian-fusion chain with lots of coctails the size of bird baths, to French fine dining.
It’s lively in a happy, civilized middle-aged kind of way."

This was my first time here, despite passing by many times when driving around Singapore, and the owners have indeed done a wonderful job in restoring this former Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ, hence the name of the current place) into a popular F&B venue for office workers...

The place we tried to day is Indochine@Chijmes.
Not being to familiar with the Asian cuisine it looked like a little gamble but an hour and a half later this gamble had turned into a smile and happy taste buds and pleasantly full belly.
The waiter was polite enough to ask how spicy I wanted the Tam Som salad, luckily, as the mildest version still has a little bite to it, very nice. Noodle and beef ball soup complemented by Cha Gio (delicious spring rolls) as main course was tasty and filling but light at the same time. Does it make any sense? :-)"

It was our last meal in Singapore before flying home we had a 3 course set lunch menu on the terrace of at the IndoChine restaurant which was shaded and with a view of the central courtyard. The food as is usual in Siingapore was very good and the set menu extremely good value."

Many restaurants from mid range to top end range and many bars with live football and huge screens
It's my favourite place after old botanical garden for after hours drinks and eating in Singapore"
,,Great place to enjoy a family dinner,5.0,,"An old church srrounded by buzzing eateries, cafes, lights, bean bags - Chijmes has a great ambience. We enjoyed a nice Spanish dinner here. The next day came back specially to sit in the corner cafe. The place is great for families and yound people alike."

,,A better but pricy place!,4.0,,"Looking for a place for drinks during a short visit. Searched TripAdvisor and decided to go because of positive comments. Not disappointed as it was a nice place especially at night when the lights on.

It's a high end good place with many outdoor restaurants and bars. Chijmes used be a girls' school with cathedral and classic classroom building and now converted to a eating place.

Interesting if you imagine those restaurants used be classrooms. Definitely worth visiting but again it's a high end place. Don't be cheap!"
,,Good,4.0,,"Trip was interesting, but there are a lot of people there. we was walking around about 2 hours, many good things to see"
,,Terrific selection of bars and restaurants,4.0,,"Chijmes is really great place to drop into if you are a first time visitor to Singapore. It comprises a number of bars and restaurants all in the same place and the setting is simply stunning. In the daytime you might think what is this all about, but go back at night and you will form a different opinion. However, almost without exception you will probably find it is pricey for both food and drinks, so at least be aware. Also, the price you see on a menu will not include 10% service charge and a 7% government tax, something you should think about before you consume too many drinks."
,,Evening drinks & food,5.0,,We strolled round CHIJMES in the daytime and were quite underwhelmed...but when we returned for a drink in the evening it was so pretty and a had a great atmosphere. Would recommend. Good for people watching too.

,,Spoilt for choice,4.0,,Within such a small place you are able to find restaurants of different flavours of food and price range. Do your research on the restaurants and make reservations before you arrive. If not you will be spoilt for choice and will be spending a time deciding what you want eat.
,,Too many great restaurants,4.0,,A nice gothic decoration place with a lot of restaurants to choose for your all day dining experience. I had tried IndoChine Restaurant and it’s not bad.
,,Great atmosphere for a pleasant evening meal,5.0,,"Chijmes was once the site of the Holy Infant convent and no visit is complete without reading the sad origins and the tales of the children left at the 'Gate' in the hope of a better life.

The Chijmes of today is a collection of restaurants, which cater for every need, surrounding a lovely grassy courtyard. I am sure anyone can find just what they want from the eclectic mixture"
,,WTA headquarters for the Women's Tennis Tournament!,5.0,,"Chijmes was the host for the WTA tournament in October. The courtyard was decorated with tennis displays and they had live updates on the matches. We went to check it out and won a prize at a trivia contest! The timing didn't work out for us to see the top players to go to a signing event, but it was fun to stop in while we were there. Beautiful grounds and atmosphere."
,,Plenty of Choices,5.0,,"Visited here twice in the last week and must say there is quite a diverse selection of restaurants for the discerning and less discerning and the simply hungry. If you just want a pint - Harry's is there to water you.

Great place to chill out as much as I miss Equinox. The old convent church is beautiful, even though marriage is not my cup of tea!!!

Come wander and find what suites you."

,,"Historic, but ...",3.0,,"More than a hundred years old, this used to be a convent school, and the CHIJ of CHIJMES was the school name

About 25 years ago they converted this place into a dining and drinking venue, with its ups and downs

Still somewhat popular, and even has 1-2 michelin star restaurants in its stable"
,,Beautiful venue but inherent problems never rectified by management,2.0,,Attended countless weddings at the beautiful Chijmes hall. Parking however has been a perennial problem. And the valet service takes advantage of this. $13 is pretty steep.. and a word of advise.. they don’t offer change!
,,Great 80s hangout,5.0,,"Been here many times and have always enjoyed the music and the service. I had my 1st date with my girlfriend there and decided I would propose to her and the staff there went out of their way to make it a memorable experience. Must thank Rahim for helping me with this wonderful day.
I think its a great place to be if you enjoy great 80s music and a crowd that enjoys live bands."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Recommended as to visit place whether you just want to enjoy the architecture of a complex used to be convent, church & school or for dining and drinking."
,,Amazing Piece of Architecture,5.0,,"The Chijmes is an amazing piece of architecture on top of its rich history and religious significance. When I visited on a Sunday, there was a wedding, so I wasn’t able to appreciate the interior as no visitor was allowed. The exterior has a white overall tone with line designs. Good for pictures on a sunny day (I came on a cloudy day so the pictures did not show the glorious side of it).

The Chijmes is 10-15 minutes walk from Bugis junction, 5-10 minutes walk from St. Andrews Cathedral, 20-30 minutes walk from the Merlion Park. I highly recommend one to explore the whole area on foot, if possible! Many to see and experience me beyond the basic tourist spots."
,,"Historic Architecture, Expensive Food",4.0,,"Historic Architecture Previously a Catholic Convent with a gothic style chapel. Good place for photography. Food Food and drinks are not cheap; but you do get what you pay for. Ambience is good, but gets real crowded when there are Happy Hour Deals."
,,Nice architecture,4.0,,Love the building because of the architecture. I went there to attend a wedding lately and really find it is a good option. There are a lot of restaurant there but is not for cheap eat. location wise is near to MRT.
,,Convenient to major hotels,4.0,,"Centrally located near hotels like Raffles and Fairmont, it offers so much choice in cafes and restaurants. It's a fascinating building and then you learn and appreciate it was once a convent - lots of interest just walking through."
,,"Fresh food, beautiful view",5.0,,"Went here with my aunt who is living in Hong Kong. There’s a beautiful path to walk around and enjoy the view of Chijmes and have some drinks.

It’s lots of fun if you can jump from restaurant to restaurant and tasting a little bit of each.

Great fun and suitable place for visiting family or even a date."
,,Abandoned,4.0,,"Once a Convent, started by Sister Mathilda Raclot in 1854 to save abandoned children, mainly Chinese, this is now a thriving place for many restaurants. It ceased functioning as a refuge in 1983, however the whole presence of the place has been maintained in its makeover. Really looks good at night."
,,Great historic area full of restaurants,4.0,,Old historic church and convent that has been developed over the years to have more and more bars/restaurants Good atmosphere with plenty of choices
,,Pretty restaurant hub,4.0,,Very enjoyable area to spend some hours at any of the many restaurants available. They made a good job renewing the place.
,,Beautiful Indoor/Outdoor Place to Eat or Grab a Drink,5.0,,"This is a great little spot to grab something to eat or for a drink in Singapore. Located close to Raffles and Raffles City. There is almost every cuisine available for both inside or outside dining.

The best restaurant I have experienced was the Coriander Leaf for amazing local inspired Cuisine. Definitely recommend a reservation or be adventurous at the chefs table, which is amazing to watch the chefs at work.

Since Singapore is so expensive I have found a need to find good Happy Hour deals. One of the highlights at Chijmes is the outdoor bar Bobby's, located below ground level. All drinks, including highballs and beers were $8.50, a great deal for Singapore."
,,Very chilled but vibrant place!,5.0,,"Set in stunning surroundings, there is a beautiful white church surrounded by lovely bars and restaurants - a great place to spend time in the day and evening. Thoroughly recommended by me!"
,,Brilliant resteraunt area,4.0,,Old converted Convent area now populated with Restaurants and Bars of all type. Great food variety as well as large screen sports bars
,,Avoid Indochine at Chijmes,1.0,,"After realising they charged $14 for a bottle of water we walked out. Absolutely crazy pricing, avoid at all costs, much better options!"
,,Wonderful place for bars and restaurants in a historic setting,5.0,,"I read about this area from this site, it is not well listed in the tour books at all.

It used to be a convent that has been converted to an event space and also an oasis of restaurants and bars in a small area with tons of busting activities near by.

There is a great Wikipedia listing of this place giving its history. Suffice it to say that now it is a fun place to tour near Raffles Hotel (walking distance) where you can get a drink or a good meal at some places that have fun/robust settings in an historic area. Pretty relaxed too. Worth the visit if you are walking by the area."
,,Serene dining,4.0,,"Whether you are dining indoor or outdoor in any of the many restaurants, having a meal here somehow make it special. Only downside is there is no convenient place to park so the nearest will be at the Raffles City mall parking and walk across the cross junction."
,,Charming dinner at IndoChine,5.0,,"Excellent Asian cuisine inside the Chijmes court. We tried a selection of their starters (avoiding the fried stuff that everyone does) and looking towards spicy salads and delicate dishes.
Quality and taste at our table with lovely service and price below 50SGD pp.
Book in advance on Fridays and weekends"
,,Entertainment District & Slice of History,4.0,,"We had reservations for dinner in the Chijmes complex, and arrived early with a bit of time to walk around--I wish we had a bit more. The buildings are the site of a former Catholic convent, with the deconsecrated chapel in the center creating a dramatic backdrop for the restaurants and bars around the perimeter. The convent was renowned for taking in the children of misfortune. Now, the historic buildings provide a totally different experience--of gastronomic experiences and festive events."
,,Love this place....,4.0,,Been coming here for years. Lots of places to eat and or drink . Great value happy hour!!! Wide variety of foods to choose from-something to pleas everyone....the actual builder no is beautiful next o a lovely church which is all lit up at night. Well worth a visit ...
,,CHIJMES is the beautiful church + gathering place for dining.,5.0,,"beautiful place for wedding or couple photo, a lot of different restaurants nearby with wonderful decoration and service"
,,A nice place hidden in the city,4.0,,This place was located beside our hotel and my friends in Singapore suggested we catch up there. The church and a little garden were good for picture taking and relaxing. We are spoiled for choice when it comes to food as there are wide selection of Asian to Western food. Quite a central place to meet up as my friends were like 1 to 2 stations away.
,,Great oasis in middle of city,5.0,,"There are few places in Singapore where the sounds of traffic fade, being surrounded by classic architecture with cool bars and great food. The layout is very clever with bars on the outer ""ring"" whilst the inner courtyard has a range of restaurants and cool bars. Downstairs are cheap eats and more pubs. A great place to chill out in the evening...."
,,Very nice place for drinks,4.0,,"This is a very nice place for drinks, the middle of an ancient convent, quite original! The place is holding several bars, we went to ""Privé"" which was very good :) Offering a large variety of cocktails, although a bit expensive"
,,Great Selection of Bars and Restaurants,5.0,,"Chijmes has a great selection of bars and restaurants in a lovely complex that was formerly a convent and still has an old church as its centre piece. El Mero Mero (Mexican) and Prive are recommended. Chijmes is frequented by some of the younger business set and is lively from late afternoon onwards, when the happy hours get underway.

On the corner opposite Raffles Hotel."

,,Dinner,4.0,,Just an evening before Singapore's Independence Day we went to this place It serves various cuisines The place has many/variety of restaurants But before placing orders just ensure that the happy hours or offers displayed r really applicable for today Else's order for an offer and end up paying more Nice quality and variety of food and drinks options
,,Nice & cozy place,4.0,,"Really nice to enjoy night at the cozy place, many cafe and bar around. Have a nice garden inside. Recomended place for enjoying a wonderful night."
,,Divine choice of restaurants,5.0,,"This is such an inspirational idea - turning a disused church into a restaurant park. Moa & Tiki, the NZ Bar and Grill, the Wharf Oyster Bar are both worth a visit but there are many cuisines available to choose from. A more raucous bar scene appears to be downstairs where there were large screen showing sports. Good maps available to show where restaurants are. Parking under the complex. Good MRT connections. Not to be missed for the atmosphere. Positively divine food."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Fantasies historical place, lovely on a weekend to meet friends a get some food. It's definitely worth a visit. The setting is beautiful."
,,CHIJMES can be so beautiful and peaceful on a weekday,5.0,,"A Beautiful Monday. Looking up the sky, it has a beautiful blue. I decided to detour. Here at CHIJMES, I discovered Singapore has a peaceful and beautiful views on a weekday!

So relaxing. If your inner child want to have a swing time, go ahead! If you love laying on the carpet grass or hammock looking up the blue sky, just do it! Pause to enjoy these little beautiful moments in life, no need to rush!"
,,Most amazing ambience,5.0,,It is not in every country that a place of worship is converted to an eatery. Chijmes is one such. A 132 year old catholic convent and chapel has been restored and upscaled to become a commercial centre of dining and shopping. The place has small boutique eateries and bars that are in sync with the atmosphere and definitely a to do for an evening well spent.
,,Amazing use of Historical Buildings,5.0,,"We weren’t really sure what to expect here but basically it is a group of historical buildings that now house numerous restaurants.

We liked it so much and it was handy to our hotel that we went here 3 times for dinner, eating at different restaurants each night. Looks amazing at night.

Most of the restaurants or bars also have special offers for discounts of meals or the entire bill, so shop around."
,,Any kind of food are available,5.0,,Its more fun at early night strolling on that side with lots of fancy drinks and finger food and heavy menu are available.
,,Visited by accident,5.0,,When you walk into chijmes it feels peaceful and calm. It is kind of quirky with a courtyard surrounded by eateries. There is a small grassed area with large cushions to lounge on within this secluded area. It was almost a hidden gem inside a modern city
,,"Lovely to visit, but I think has lost some of its charm",5.0,,"The Chijmes is a lovely place to visit full of a variety of restaurants offering a variety of tastes and a variety of prices which is great if you are looking for dining options. Only problem is that there are too many choices making selection difficult. Whilst this is still a beautiful place to visit, I think it has lost some of its charm from when we were last here 5 years ago. Then you had a small number of restaurants and a good range of other outlets to browse through. We bought a table runner and a couple of scarves last visit and were looking forward to some more shopping but were a bit disappointed to find that these outlets have now been replaced by restaurants"
,,Lovely spot in the Center,4.0,,Great place for drinks and something to eat. Kids enjoy them selfs on the grass were they can play and run around.

,,Great place to eat - lots of choice,4.0,,"Great range of food, from medium expensive to very expensive. Food to suit all tastes and bars to drench the thirst from walking in the heat. Worth strolling round to get a good feel of the old church and nunary"
,,An OK food arcade.,3.0,,"This is just a gimmicky food arcade in Singapore. It used to be a church, once, then converted to a shopping arcade with numerous food options. Other than some photo-ops - it's nothing special."
,,Beautiful church,4.0,,I went during the early afternoon. There were numerous restaurants in this area. There were also numerous people enjoying the grass areas. The church was closed due to a private event. I'm sure the nuns that created the Catholic convent known as the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) (圣婴女修院) and convent quarters known as Caldwell House are rolling in their graves.
,,"Around the church, nice atmosphere",4.0,,"Go to the church, grab a bite to eat, walk around. the neighbourhood is also nice, feels like proper colonial singapore."
,,Landmark in the city,5.0,,"We were attracted by the church then went inside and discovered it's no longer a church, but a place with lots of restaurants, good place for photos."
,,Wonderful and interesting location with good food choices,4.0,,"A friend of mine suggested coming here and we were not disappointed.

It's great to walk around and take in the old convent, then select one of the many restaurants that cater for many food tastes.

There are also bars and outside eating option.

Great fun and great quality all round."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"Impressive are. Trying something to eat without reservation on a Friday. Really difficult, but we found a good Japanese. Really nice surroundings."
,,Commercialized Heritage...,3.0,,It is one of the heritage places in Singapore commercialized for monetary value. Good to have meals and drinks and can watch footballs matches in crowded bars.
,,Interesting collection of restaurants and bars,4.0,,"I find it a little odd to turn a historic area into restaurants and bars, but maybe that's just me. Either way, there's lots of options for eating and drinking in a very cool and unique setting. It's worth walking through to see even if you don't ultimately eat here."
,,Overall a great place for indecisive eaters or casual drinking,4.0,,Thee are numerous places to eat and drink here and the grounds are well manicured. Most places offer air conditioning and some even have drink specials - a must in Singapore!
,,Good place for take dinner and drink,4.0,,"I'm in the hotel infront of ... only nees to cross the street to reach this building, nice garden inside in the middle of the high buildings. The food nothing to much special but the place and comodoty near hotel ia wonderfool"
,,Spoilt for choice at this conclave of restaurants,4.0,,"Chijmes has a unique atmosphere especially since its right in the middle of Singapore. Its a bit of haven away from he noise of the city given its 1 level below.
There are dozens of restaurants here to choose from as well as bars so there is going to be something that you will like."
,,Great spot for food and drinks,5.0,,"This historic building complex began life as a convent so the architecture is a nice change from the ultra modern Singapore. Their are numerous restaurants and bars to choose from. Some of the restaurants we have found particularly good are Lei Garden (Chinese Food), Bobby's has excellent burgers and beer an IndoChine offers nice Vietnamese style dishes."
,,Awesome Dinner Out,5.0,,"There are number of restaurants at Chijmes and each offers unique dishes of choice. Live band is played and prices would be slightly higher. However, the choices you have in food and the quality of them will amaze you."
,,A pleasant and picturesque oasis in Singapore.,4.0,,"This convent dating back to 1841 has housed restaurants, clubs and shops since 1983. It is a place that is both pleasant and picturesque where one can relax and refresh. The convent itself is an attractive piece of architecture that I recommend one visits whilst in Singapore."
,,Indochine-I Expected Better,3.0,,"Nice ambience and service was pretty good. From the menu items offered we were excited - sort of a Thai-Khmer-Lao fusion with some twists. For tapas we had Goi Cuon and smoked sausages, which were pretty good. The Aussie beef salad (paid extra for the prime beef) was lacking except for the beef which was very tender and tasty. I had the deep fried sea bass fillet which was lacking in taste as well. I used the chili mayo from the truffle fries which helped. Fries were good with a strong truffle taste and smell. The chocolatini was very nice. My Boston Beach Party was so strong I couldn't finish it. With drinks the tab was SD$235. At this price, it was average. See photos."
,,Great Place,4.0,,"Lots of different restaurants and nice bars, little oasis in the city, you enter it and it becomes quite. Had dinner in the IndoChine and can recommend that place to. Nice with the white church inside - one of my favourite places :-)"
,,Great place to eat.,4.0,,Just opposite Raffles this venue has a number of eating places facing into a middle court area. Good choice and if you're staying in Raffles then a short walk across the road.
,,Lots of dining and drinking options here...,5.0,,"We had gone to visit the Long Bar at Raffles Hotel but it was closed for renovation :( so we found ourselves in Chijmes instead. There are a lot of restaurants and bars to choose from but being the weekend, tables were hard to come by.

We found a bar at the lower level for a couple of beers before heading to Clarke Quay.

Great atmosphere."
,,Dinner with friends,4.0,,A real buzz to this place and so many places to chose from. Great atmosphere to meet as groups or a couple. Toilets are a bit of a walk otherwise this place is great
,,Top Quality Venue,5.0,,"A must visit evening venue when in Singapore, really smart with a wide range of bars, restaurants. Lots of Happy Hour drink promotions with live music, glorious courtyard setting with illuminated historic buildings."
,,A great place to visit,5.0,,"We were staying at Raffles Hotel, just across the road from Chijmes with a wonderful selection of retail shops and Restuarants for all tastes at very reasonable prices. Good for Lunch and it livens up in the evening for some great evening meals"
,,Beautiful setting,5.0,,We stopped by Chijmes when visiting the historical sites of Singapore. It's incredibly intricate and photogenic. Perfect spot if you like architecture photography.
,,Visit the religious buildings,4.0,,"Don't just visit the restuarants take the time to walk through the older buildings. We had a lovely quiet, restful look at the main hall with windows for each of the apostles. We are not particularly religious but it is nice to see this and how it sits amongst the restuarants and buzz."
,,Stunning Location,5.0,,"What can I say... Singapore is a beautiful city and Chijmes is just one of many jewels in its crown. Lots of retails, bars & restaurants. Easy Access and fantastic sights and sounds. Well worth a visit"
,,Consistent Indochine response,4.0,,"Having eaten at the Waterfront, treehouse and now Chimjes - all offer consistent level of service and experience.
We had salmon tartar - excellently spiced and good for two to share. Followed with chicken cashew mix and then beef cubes - both were delicious. The house wine 2 for 1 special was also good on the palate and the wallet. All in a good experience and was enough food for two. If we had been a bit hungrier we would have gone for one of the prawn options - looked interesting."
,,Good Fun and Good Food!,4.0,,There are lots of restaraunts and it's at a nice location. I celebrated new years here it was definitely a lot of fun. I would recomend this as a lazy sunday activity.

,,One of my favourite places in Singapore,5.0,,"Chijmes is one of the best places I visited in Singapore. The atmosphere is relaxed, chilled, and perfect for those hot nights when you want to sip mojitos and enjoy good food. So many restaurant choices to chose from and the architecture is stunning with a beautiful massive church in the front. I could easily return to singapore just for an evening here."
,,Hangout,4.0,,"Inside this building, you'll see varieties of pub, cafes and restaurants. Nice place to hangout with friends after work. Cozy place. Many choices of dishes. Worth to spend time there"
,,Nice restaurants!,4.0,,This is still a place with nice restaurants. But it looks like since a couple of years (even after the recent upgrade) it had lost his glamor. It's not that busy as a couple of years ago
,,Lots of choice,5.0,,"Lots of resteraunts, bars and cafes so plenty of choice. Really nice atmosphere and lovely setting. A walk around in the daytime allows you to admire the gardens and the buildings. Nighttime is lively and entertaining."
,,Old and beautiful,4.0,,This place is Old worlds charm .as its old catholic chapel .The place has a very good vibe to it . The food was good but bit expensive
,,Lovely spot for dinner,4.0,,"Such a cute little spot for dinner! Chijmes is an old historic building that was originally a convent built in the early 1900s. Today, it’s been retrofitted to house restaurants, shops, as well as serve as a venue for various entertainment purposes. I liked it in the evening more because the lights gave it a really warm and cozy environment and there’s live music! It’s just a beautiful outdoor space with restaurants that range from typical bar food to oysters and delectable seafood. Check it out if you want to escape the hawker centre scene!"
,,Great dinner venue,5.0,,"Beautiful setting of restaurants next to a church. Slightly above average price wise, but worth it just for the location Would definitely go back there if we returned to Singapore"
,,Chijmes,4.0,,"Originally a monastery, bombed by the Japanese during the war. It was being used as an orphanage. A wedding reception in process so I didn't get to go all the way in. Absolutely beautiful. Across from Carlton hotel."
,,Relax,5.0,,Quite beautiful area with lots of restaurants next to a beautiful church. Worthwhile to visit to get a drink or nice meal
,,Dinner venue,4.0,,A restored convent beautifully converted into a cluster of restaurants and eateries .A good place for an evening outing in a romantic setting
,,awesome,5.0,,"Great food, wonderful ambiance, so historic, excellent lay out. A must see even on a short trip. Very close to many attractions."
,,Beautiful wedding location,5.0,,"Came over for a wedding and was blown away. Absolutely stunning inside, and made the wedding 11/10. Would recommend anyone trying to find a great location to consider here."
,,Bad customer service,1.0,,"Went there two days ago. Seemed like the servers do not take pride in their jobs. Got seated, placed our orders and somehow none of the servers asked to keep the menus. The menus were just laying around our tables. FYI, the menus were big and eventually we had to put in on the empty seat beside us as there were no space on the table after all the dishes were served. Also, the calamari was really bad.

Lastly, we had to request for cutlery as they probably expected their customers to eat using their bare hands.

It is certainly located at a nice location but with such service provided, I am definitely going to visiting their neighbours instead."
,,Nice outdoor garden,4.0,,We were staying across the road from Chijmes at the Carlton hotel and decided to pop over on a Sunday evening for a predinner drink. The architecture of the building is beautiful and it opens up onto a lovely garden area. There are many restaurants and bars throughout the complex and many have great happy hour deals. We got a cocktail at a place called Prive which had good service and tasty drinks. If you are around the area it's definitely worth popping in and grabbing some food or a drink.
,,Highlander bar,5.0,,Great night here in September with partner. Very good live band and exceptional service. Not the cheapest place for a drink but then nowhere in Singapore is! Would definitely recommend and return.
,,Beautiful Heritage Building,5.0,,This is a very serene place in the afternoons and bustling in the evenings. Very nice for pictures and one of the nicest building hertiage in the city center. There are also many cafes and restaurants for a quick stop in between visiting the tourist attractions in the area like the Singapore Flyer.
,,So much choice in a great setting,5.0,,"There are so many places to eat and drink at Chijmes. If you can't find somwhere for your taste and pocket, I would me amazed! Not all restaurants have aircon and many are open air. Also be sure to check the prices first as the offerings here range from short order to Michelin Stars!

Look out for live musicians in the central grass area and position yourself depending on how much of them you want to hear."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,This area is really lovely with loads of places to eat to choose from. Everything you could think of to eat within the complex. Live entertainment in the evenings.
,,Beautiful garden in the middle of city,5.0,,"Excellent place to have beer with friends. Nice garden with trees, grass in the middle of city. All restaurants here look nice. Priv is excellent. I don't take no for an answer when it comes to picking my favorite table and they gave me what I wanted, so I am bribed :)"
,,Beautiful Courtyard and Pricey Restaurants,3.0,,"I have visited Chijmes many times and it just doesn't resonate with me. There are several restaurants and bars and good outdoor seating throughout.

Carnivore, a Brazilian Restaurant, is my favorite but it isn't in my Top Ten for places to eat in Singapore. This is a great venue for business parties or weddings but it will not appeal to families with children at all.

Not sure why an area like this is listed as something to do like an activity or tour rather than just a location for many restaurants."

Cheers!"
,,Hidden secret the locals know about.,4.0,,"Chijmes is a converted church grounds that takes up most of the block between Victoria St (continuation of Hill St), Bras Basah Rd, North Bridge Rd and Stamford Rd.
There must be in excess of 20 restaurants within Chijmes. From the street there doesn't seem to be much to identify it. I walked in one entry to check out a restaurant and saw a list of other restaurants - went outside- nothing; went inside along a corridor - many restaurants. On the way out discovered more restaurants.
Main entrance is Victoria St with free parking"
,,Nothing special,2.0,,"Take a look if you are around, but, definitely, don't deserve the tour. A lot of overpriced restaurants inside."
,,Beautiful spot for dinner,5.0,,"A beautiful old building with a gorgeous internal courtyard, filled with restaurants offering every type of cuisine at various price points. Perfect for a romantic dinner, the grounds are covered in pretty fairy lights and open air dining is just gorgeous. Definitely a nicer alternative to the quite touristy restaurant strip along Clarke Quay. No one accosting you telling you to choose their restaurant. The restaurants down on the bottom level often have live music too. Recommend this for couples, families, groups of friends, everybody. There are restaurants to suit all tastes and occasions."

,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,"This is a charming place full of places to eat and history. I have not seen a more clean and well maintained place before. Stopped by on our walk and enjoyed taking a rest in the garden, it was a pity it was early morning as it seemed such a great place to simply relax with a drink and watch the world go by. The old convent is well maintained a certainly a nice place to visit."

,,Don't walk past,5.0,,Have walked past this place many times and finally called in here last month. What a find! We ate and had drinks at a cafe on the first level. Food was good and beers were $5.90 a pint. Then went downstairs to the Irish Pub. Had the best Singapore Slings and they were $10 each. Great atmosphere in there.
,,Nice place but expensive,4.0,,"Expensive for drinks but great location good atmosphere, bars to cater to all tastes and easy to find food. A must go if your looking for good nightlife."
,,Pretty,3.0,,"Chijmes is old historical building complex. The old Catholic chapel itself is very pretty. Now this complex is host to several bars and many good Japanese restaurants. I think this place is worth to visit, if you are in this neighborhood. For casual western comfort food Bobby's Bistro or Prive are good options. Burgers are great."
,,Beautiful district,4.0,,"Headed down with some co-workers for dinner and was amazed how beautifully restored this area was. You many choices for dinning, both inside and out."
,,El Mero Mero,4.0,,Having submitted a review a couple of years ago saying not fantastic restaurants in Chijmes I have found a very good restaurant and drinks stop - El Mero Mero. For those that love traditional Mexican food you will love this and their speciality El Mero Mero tequila is to die for!
,,We had dinner at Indochine Chijmes,3.0,,"The place was packed ,which means that there is hardly any space between the tables.The vans blow to the maximum ,and therefore one has to speak very loudly.The food is not bad,but of a high standard fast food level.As we picked this restaurant while walking in the Chijmes area,we got the feeling to have chosen the wrong place."
,,"""Historical landmark""",4.0,,Historical landmark catholic school for girls of all ages that was occupied by Japanese during World war 2 and turned into supply building. Afterwards they turned it to special event building. Stain glass of disciples is still on the wall.
,,Dinner with an Experience to remember,5.0,,This place has an old & beautiful charm to it. It houses numerous outlets to cater to various taste buds - abundance of choice. A date night or a family night - this place is just about right.

,,Nice Surrounding,4.0,,"This place is quite good, beautiful church, quite garden, compounded with some bars and restaurants. Ideal place for wedding or other ceremony."
,,very serene.,3.0,,I was just in Japan last February and was eating Japanese food. I could not believe the the lines of dining in this area serves Japanese food though their workers are mostly Filipinos they don't measure with the Japanese standard of food quality and presentations.
,,Good place to visit,4.0,,"Didn't realized before that the place was actually a Catholic Church. Not sure if the Church is still active or not. My wife loved the place, good place to take photos. Many selection of restaurant, surprisingly there is Bebek Tepi Sawah, one of the Famous Restaurant from Bali."
,,Eat & Drink,3.0,,"Chijmes is a nice area in a colonial style setting with many bars, restaurants and small shops. During day time quite sleepy and not much happening, in the evening it starts to be alive. For a casual evening out a good location but unless you want to eat or drink not really worth visiting."
,,Colonial,4.0,,This area is the old colonial part of Singapore.The buildings are of old colonial style.There are lots of food out lets and bars.
,,Great dinner location,5.0,,"A great dinner location as the trees are decorated with fairy lights and there is often live music playing in one of the restaurants/bars. A wide variety of places to eat in, and on a warm clear evening, a lovely place for a casual drink."
,,Cool dining and entertainment hub,4.0,,It was before a church before it's conversion into a cool dining and entertainment hub in Bugis.BrasBasah precinct. I love the gothic-style architecture of the chapel building which was used before as a catholic convent known as the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ).

,,beautiful tourist trap,3.0,,"Chijmes is a gorgeous area central in Singapore. I was always impressed by the architecture of the place as it use to be a church. Filled with lots of restaurants and bars, my friends and i walked all over looking for a place to have dinner and decided to settle for a seafood place. Unfortunately the food and drinks was extremely disappointing. I would suggest that place for drinks just to experience the atmosphere but i would be wary of the food there."
,,Indochine Restaurant at the Chijmes serves warm homely Thai fare!,4.0,,"After watching the Sound & Light display at the Marina Sands this Sunday evening, we decided to vist the unique setting of the Chijmes! What was formerly a church with a charming courtyard is now serving an excellent variety of food apart from being a much sought after marriage centre, one hears. We stumbled across the Indochine here and did they serve a warm homely Thai meal with attendant courtesy and style. The Green Curry vegetable we had was simply excellent! We also tried the Papaya Salad, Rice paper rolls, Tofu dish and plain white rice. The hostess was charming & courteous and with two hungry sleepy children in tow, we were mighty grateful for the homely ambience and care! We will return."
,,Important historical building with some great places to eat,3.0,,"A number of reviewers mention this was a former church which is not exactly correct. The building was a Catholic convent with a chapel added some 60 years later, that is Chijmes Hall. The whole complex now has some great shops and restaurants"
,,Coriender Leaf Restaurant in Chijmes,5.0,,"Chijmes is a very interesting square Singapore. Formerly a Church, now is an entertainment centre with restaurants and bars. I want talk about a restaurant called Coriender Leaf. It's unique as it offers South Asian cuisine with an international flair. The creator chef is Samia, trained in New York city but with a South Asian origin.
Four of us tried a wide variety of dishes which were very tasty..in particular Frontier Chicken and Angus beef were outstanding. The quantity of food per order reminded me of Spanish Tapas..not enough for a meal. Needless to say, that we ordered enough dishes to make sure it was a full dinner.
The decor is simple and friendly. The atmosphere is casual but there is nothing casual about the food.
It's not cheap..we paid SGD 260 without any alcohol for four persons.
Service was efficient but not overwhelming."
,,Thanks for Evarything,5.0,,"One of the best place to eat, drink and visit . there are lots of restaurant which serves different types of cuisine. Get a chance visit Japanese BBQ restaurant and was good in all categories. good location."
,,Chijmes is a great place,5.0,,Such a beautiful place. Various dining choices. Lovely ambience. I went to Bebek Tepi Sawah and am very pleased with the food.
,,Food and music in a church of former glory,4.0,,"Chijmes used to be a church and you can still see that the building has stayed true to its roots. Not much has been altered to change the layout of the building. You can still see the gate of hope, where children were abandoned by families who could not afford to keep them or did not want them. Chijmes used to be a home to orphaned children and children from broken families, when the church moved to a new location, it was changed into a a group of eateries. The gate of hope still remains and is a reminder of Singapore's history."
,,Wonderful atmosphere in historic environmemt,5.0,,"We have been here a few times now on our visits to Singapore. The atmosphere is lovely (happy and friendly) and the old building itself is beautifully kept and lit, giving this place a very special feeling. We ate at what I think was a new Asian restaurant, Madam Butterfly. The meal was sensational, although a bit on the pricy side. Will make this a regular destination on future trips."
,,A place to be..,5.0,,"Chijmes (apparently pronounced just 'chimes') is a renovated Church and grounds to be a funky selection of excellent bars and restaurants, in rather central Singapore.

Given the huge variety of places to eat, drink, or just mingle and admire the design , you can't really go wrong.

If arriving by Taxi, ask that they drop you off at the front main entrance (most Taxis will drop you off anywhere around the square grounds, with its multiple minor entrances) to really take in the architecture."
,,Fantastic outing,4.0,,"These former convent grounds offer an amazing array of entertainment options. Food, drink, outdoor hangouts are numerous. Put it on your must see list, it'll take 2X visits."
,,Wedding reception at Chijmes restored Convent,5.0,,"This venue is out of this world amazing. An outstandingly stunning and beautiful space. Whoever did the catering, there was a member of staff called Tony who went out of his way to give me a substitute for the ""shark's fin"" soup course even tho I said I'd just go without that course. It may not have been the genuine shark fin as apparently sometimes restaurants say it is but it could be fake. The Tom yum soup alternative was spectacular, thanks Tony! Feedback: air con too cold/low for me, acoustics not great from where I sat when people spoke on mic but fixable.
Left my bag in toilet and someone handed to staff from restaurant nearest toilets (there are other restaurants between chapel and conveniences). phone and money all there :)"
,,Harry's @ Chijmes,5.0,,"Lunch at Harry's Chijmes was superb. Fast service, good taste, quality and quantity wise, right at the heart of the city. Flatbread was absolutely fantastic and cocktails were very refreshing. Looking forward to revisiting."
,,It is hard to find Al Fresco bar like this in Singapore,5.0,,We came here many times already and still love it like the first time. It is the best Al Fresco bar in Singapore. Our favorite is Prive. We love Summer Ale there with some dishes for dinner and the conversation can last forever. :)
,,Well done restauration of the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus,4.0,,"In the center of Singapore not far away of the Raffles Hotel the site of the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus is beautifull restorated. The old convent, church and schoolbuildings are now a complex of food and beverage oultets. Restauration is done with respect for the old historical elements. It's a nice agreeable place to visit. Information boards give some historical background about the place, the church, the Caldwell House. Inside Chijmess you have a large choice of restaurants but somewhat expensive. We recommanded a visit to this historical site."
,,Nice place,4.0,,"Life in Singapore is very fast and busy. So if you're looking for a nice, cool place to relax and unwind then I will recommend this place."
,,"Gothic chapel, 19th Century Convent and Al fresco dining!",4.0,,"No, the restaurant that you came looking for did not get converted to a chapel. You've just entered Chijmes - a 19th century convent, converted to a chic complex of F&B outlets. Sitting bang in the central area of Singapore, Chijmes offers an alternate dining experience, marrying historical charm and modern chicness.
There are a number of upscale restaurants, bars and bistros throughout the property. Check out their website for a complete list of tenants, so that you can plan the joint you want to visit. I especially liked the places offering al fresco dining, within a charming view of the lawns and chapel. There was even a small christmas market when I visited few weeks back!
Though not one of my favourites in Singapore, I will recommend Chijmes for a one time visit. It is a charming experience to dine inside a historic convent - be there for that experience!"
,,Gothic Style Chapel,5.0,,"The various buildings are related by design with the intent to form exterior spaces which would be pleasing for the users. The spaces contained within the whole block have been adapted for public use, and form one of the major buildings in the Central Area."
,,Pretty location,3.0,,"Somewhat expensive for what they serve. Nice ambiance, but very few guests and biring servece, try harder"
,,Beautiful ambience for dinner or meeting of friends or just to have a look at this unique place.,4.0,,"This is one place I would recommend tourist to visit as it is a place where the old meets the new. Transformed from a old convent to a modern setup with beautiful restaurants. You can enjoy the outdoor atmosphere and dine alfresco or indoors. Both are just as good. You have a wide choice of food here. My friends and I dined alfresco and had Ribs, Pork Chops & Sirloin Steak from BOBBY's @ CHIJMES. Transport to this place is very convenient. We took buses & the MRT (trains). Taxis are also easily available."
,,Singapore,5.0,,An old Convent restored and converted into the most beautiful area with lots of restaurants and entertainment area. Do the walk around Chijmes and discover the fascinating history of this remarkable place
,,A hidden gem,4.0,,"Chijmes is an old white washed church (French I'm led to believe) surrounded by bars and restaurants. A great location to try local or international cuisine and relax then a few drinks at the surrounding bars.
There is a taxi rank in front of the church to get you back to your hotel"
,,Special,4.0,,"This place is special, a former convent school turned into an upmarket trendy food and beverage haven. The church with its long aisle and high ceilings has become a favourite wedding and events venue. The many restaurants and cafe provide a wide array of world cuisine. Prices are steeper in this part of town, but the ambience is great!"
,,Interesting architecture,3.0,,"This is a very different spot in the centre of Singapore city worth walking around to see. Alas, almost all of the old buildings are now restaurants and bars, catering to the wealthy young Singaporeans and tourists, but during the day, you can get a sense of the former religious site."
,,fabulous setting,5.0,,"Wow. Just the most gorgeous setting, in an old converted Convent. This place is a warren of wonderful bars and resturants, you can get any type of food you can imagine here. It has options for all budgets too, from grab and go Sushi to plush cocktail lounges. At night it is stunningly lit, and is just an absolute pleasure to be in. As the main courtyard is sunk down, it also forms a bit of an outdoor oasis from the haze."
,,Nice place to spend night,5.0,,"Nice place to spend night. Lot of restaurants and bars either for diner or for drink only in very cosy atmosphere. I expected higher prices, but I was quite surprised when I saw that prices for drinks and food are generally some average prices for this area, even a little bit less compared to Clark Quay."
,,After renovation,4.0,,"This grand old dame still evokes childhood memories from 50 years ago when it was a convent school. After several renovations and refurbishments it is opening with new restaurants, new refreshed looks and an improved carpark. Certainly worth walking the grounds, taking in the chapel, enjoying a respite from the traffic outside the lovely walls and gardens."
,,Better to look at from the back :),3.0,,"The main church building stretches pretty deep into the back area, and in my opinion it's better to look at it from the back. There's a pretty spacious outdoor eating area too at the back courtyard with restaurants and such; there are even escalators in the back area to the basement level (outdoors) behind the church where there are more tables & chairs. Also in the back area of the church grounds are some ""information plates"" about the history of this place which goes quite way back, and I learned this was a religious school of sorts at one time.

The church seemed to be under renovation (including the outdoor basement level at the back as mentioned above) when I was here, so it was pretty barren inside, nothing even at the altar area on one end of the main room at the front.

Coming by MRT, one way to get here is to get off at Bras Basah station (yellow line); once you're on Bras Basah Rd. outside the station, turn left and take a short walk on Bras Basah to where it intersects with Victoria St. where you turn right onto Victoria and cross the street to the other side and you'll see the church right about on the corner of Bras Basah & Victoria; it takes just about five minutes or so. Alternatively, you could get off at City Hall station (green & red lines); once you've come out of the station, you're on North Bridge Rd. pretty much on the corner of North Bridge & Stamford (the corner just shortly to your right) where you turn left onto Stamford and walk a block until you hit Victoria, then turn right onto Victoria and the church will be on your right after about a one-block walk (towards Bras Basah); this way to the church takes slightly longer than coming from Bras Basah MRT as mentioned above."
,,We like Chijmes,4.0,,"The location and atmosphere is great, you have a bunch of places to eat and drink and there is always some music and entertainment......"
,,I'm inlove!,5.0,,"Had a crush with this place when I first saw it, Fell in love when I visited it. Fell even harder when I spent time at it. Tried almost all the restaurants in this place, drank almost all kinds of wine in this place. My favorite place in the world.. Paris is just the second. :p"
,,Chijmes,4.0,,This place was great - lots of bars and places to eat - not very accessible but could access some areas - not open early as lots of places in Singapore so would struggle if looking for an early lunch!
,,Harry's at Chijmes is great,5.0,,"The average meal is around $25 SD and the alcohol is charged at the normal rate. We paid $54 for a bottle of merlot. The meals were a decent size, as in you don't need to order an entree."
,,A must to see in Singapore,3.0,,nice place to hang out...the atmosphere changes from the Singaporean crowd. Good restaurant there and couple of nice bars to chill...
,,disappointed,1.0,,"When visiting Singapore we always visit Chijmes but after a break of 5 years we ere very disappointed to find that all the facinating little shops had gone and have been replaced by trendy retaurants.
I would love to know where the shops have relocated to."
,,An Old Cathedral with a Twist,4.0,,A restored Cathedral that has been converted into a string of restaurant and bars. A great place to hangout and spend the late evening. Beautiful setting and ambiance.
,,"Nice place, but expensive",4.0,,"I like this place's ambiance, its really hip and cool, it's a place you want to be seen by your friends or colleagues. However, you have to pay premium for pretty much the same stuff you can get anywhere in Singapore. I think it's worth it if you want to impress someone or you just feel like splurging, its up to you."
,,Picturesque,4.0,,We came here with friends for dinner. We liked the location as it was very pretty snd there seemed to be a great atmosphere. Worth a visit at night. We didn't see it in the day so can't comment on that.
,,Charming,5.0,,"This is a truly charming place, bustling with interesting events and people. The cathedral is such a beautiful hall. Excellent location for important life events like weddings."
,,Good food,4.0,,This was a little sanctuary for me while I was staying in Singapore. This place was full of food and it housed a luxury spa. There were so many restaurants there that I frequented and at night the place just lights up with so many visitors and sometimes lively performances. I would recommend going there when you visit.
,,Cozy place,5.0,,"This is place is very nice, cozy and good for photographer. Romantic place. They have a church. I love this place. They are some restaurants and bars here. And I found 'Bebek Tepi Sawah' at 2nd floor. That is a local reataurant in Ubud Bali. They have some boutique and most are ethnic boutique. This place also good for pre wedding photographer."
,,A COURTYARD AND AN OASIS IN A CITY,5.0,,"I have been visiting frequently this place since a child for half a century. I still love and visit this venue for all its goodness after more than half a century now.

This was once a Convent ( and a nunnery ) in the heart of a city before it open up to the public in a commercialised way. As you would have expected; quiet , tranquility and peacefulness ( of course solemnness ) are inherent characteristic of its environment. Such did'nt change as it open doors to the common public decades ago and it remains so. It just become even more relevant and needful to the hustle and bustles of the surrounding marketplace events and activities.

It is surrounding by a large university complex ( along Hill St), a reputed hotel ( along Bras Basah Rd), a long-time yet modern Raffles City shopping complex ( along North Bridge Rd ) and a contemporary; latest Capitol Mall ( along Stamford Rd ) ;embeded with MRT entry/exit points at all 4 corners. Perhaps that is why it is aptly to be a courtyard ( easy assessibility and resting respite ) and an oasis ( cooling down and yet nearness to commercial and personal needs for amenities even on its own ).

Many visitors may be distracted by the attraction in that vicinity and overlook this charming spot. I suggest they take a walk into this spot ; and discover it to be an interesting site not frequently highlighted in ""touristing"" brochure. And you would be delighted with this place ; anytime of the day or night ; to savour its fine environment which changes from between different splendours just as much as the sun and moon changes its basking ""shine"" over it. Entrance is free ."
,,A friend had a wedding there,5.0,,"A friend of mine had a her wedding there, the church was really lovely. It's not big but it's never about the size, right? There are bars,restaurants and several lawns around as well. It's a really cozy and relax place. Though I don't think the church is open for public, it's saved for special event like wedding sort of thing."
,,"Heart-warming Project ""For the Next 50 Years"" as Singapore's Jubilee",4.0,,"We were invited to a benefit concert staged at Chijmes by Singapore Creations Etc. The performance was created by the kids of the non-profit under guidance of the Founders.

It brought us to tears to see how a diverse ethnic group performed as ONE family supported each other and worked creatively to delight the audience.

The event was supported by the Singapore National Integration Council and a couple of other organizations and individuals."
,,nice place for lazy sunday,5.0,,"love the place, nice choice of bars.. I personally like Prive.. nice outdoor sitting area for a sunny day lazy drink drink"
,,Quick Look is Enough,3.0,,"A good atmosphere and definitely a sight to see, but not breathtaking or a new experience. We simply walked around for 10 minutes, did not bother to sit at any of the bars or restaurants.

The lighting is wonderful, but after a short stroll we felt done with the place. Stop by if you're in the area but don't come all the way out just for this."
,,Changed,3.0,,"I used to love this place for live music venues like insomnia, saddened this place closed last year, it was a Singapore institution, it's not the same Atmosphere in the area anymore since, some nice restaurant inside though it has to be said"
,,Beautiful Historic Complex,5.0,,This was once the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus and is a number of historic buildings that have been converted into a restaurant and entertainment centre. The main church which has been beautifully restored is used as a venue for special events like weddings. Beside it is the Caldwell House 1840-1 which is an important old Colonial House with a rounded front in the style of Anglo-Indian Villas. Behind the church are a series of historic convent buildings which are now restaurants and dance clubs. This is the ideal outcome for an obsolete historic property and a real asset to the downtown.
,,Classic style!,5.0,,"lot of restaurants, enjoyed to walking around the area, they also have live music on the garden which is so good, we love it yah! good place to visited when you have a chance to go to SG!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,One of the most beautiful places you can eat in Singapore. This re-purposed building truly has its own character and it is a must visit for everyone who wants to have a relaxed dinner or drink.
,,Simply awesome,5.0,,"A beautiful church converted to a restaurant / bar hub in the heart of Singapore. I was simply blown away by the gorgeous architecture and ambiance of the place...it's so unique that it's a must visit for any tourist.

The place is flooded with great bars and eateries. There is both indoor and out door options.

Highly recommended!"
,,Another amazing building that has been repurposed,4.0,,"Chijmes pronounced ""chimes"" is a historical convent now an upscale shopping centre and Singapore’s version of London’s Covent Gardens. CHIJMES (Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus Middle Education School) is a huge complex of buildings of great architectural diversity, ranging from Anglo French Gothic to Neoclassical. All over the complex are intricately designed metal staircases, handmade stained glass windows and tall grand spires. CHIJMES started in 1854 as a convent school set up by French nuns. It served as a school, pioneering education for girls in a time when people were poor and education for girls was not considered important. It was an orphanage for children whose parents could not afford to keep them. The Gate of Hope is a small grey door but it was a symbol of hope for many of the babies who were left at Chijmes. Due to poverty, many families left usually female babies there for the nuns of the convent to care for. Female babies born in the Year of the Tiger were regularly abandoned there by Chinese families who believed that female Tiger babies brought bad luck. This place is an integral part of Singapore’s history and its good to see it being used."
,,Lovely,5.0,,"Great complex, beautiful church looks lovely in the evening. Good choice of restaurants and bars lovely to sit outside with a cocktail I would return."
,,Favourite: Berlin Bar,4.0,,"Recently reopened with new tenants, and renovated courtyards, Chijmes is attracting crowds that used to frequent Clarke Quay. New bars and restaurants have opened up - but my favourite is The Berlin Bar in the basement of Chijmes, with a great band and DJ that spins Top 40s and Retro music, and a comfortable welcoming ambience with great service."
,,so good-looking,5.0,,"If you like take photos, you MUST go there! The building is handsome extremely,however you cannot imagine!"
,,"Interesting, to a point...",3.0,,"Beautiful colonial architecture, interesting story but what will forever be burned into my mind is that there is an APPLEBEES here - what an abomination! You would think in strictly controlled Singapore, there would be some sort of law preventing an APPLEBEES from polluting the local culture. The other establishments seemed to be legit, but I will ALWAYS remember feeling sick to my stomach when I set eyes upon America's shame..."
,,A classy place,5.0,,For people with a taste for the class - it to s a must .Reservation are needed to have a meal - plan well . It is on high end side . Worth the money .
,,Pretty Setting.. Lots of Choice,4.0,,"Chijmes is full of restaurants and bars and pitches mostly to the expat community and the tourists.. The renovated old barracks situated around the old church makes for a very pretty setting, especially at night."
,,Tantalise the taste buds.,5.0,,"Chijmes is the cultural hub of good food and great conversation. Spread out beneath what once was an old 19th Century Gothic chapel are the cafes and restaurants of an international flavour. Formal restaurants to casual bistro cuisine are your menus of choice. Chijmes will leave you wanting to come back and visit a new city each night, from the German brew, to the Japanese sushi - any connoisseur will be slave to the abundance of choice."
,,Harrys @ Chijmes,4.0,,"Visited Chijmes while in Singapore in June and had a very pleasant afternoon in Harry's Bar, very good service from Joseph - constantly checking to see if we would like more drinks and topping up of water - not something we tend to experience in Perth! Thanks Joseph - we will be back!"
,,Perfect location and such a beautiful historic building....,4.0,,"Staying at the Carlton just across the road mean't Chijmes was perfectly located to pop in and out for a meal, couple of quiet drinks or browsing in several of the gorgeous little boutiques."
,,Amazing Restos,3.0,,From outside who could have ever thought underneath this beautiful church is a bar and resto's. Yeah you heard me right there are bars behind this church. But they no longer do mass though.
,,Has changed over the years but still a favourite of mine,4.0,,"Still a lovely old building used as a pre nightlife haunt of bars and restaurants. Been going here since 1999 and has changed somewhat, was sad to see the loss of shrooms a few years ago. Has went under a couple of revamps since then with a good mix of different restaurants with a nice relaxed feel.
Certainly worth a look in as good meeting place to offer up a mixture of tastes."
,,Great F&B Destination!,5.0,,"This is a great F&B destination that you should visit.

It was formerly a convent that has been refurnished and now run by a private company.

The property has undergone major renovations and refurbishments, with some new tenants. This refreshes their F&B offerings, which include Japanese, Mexican, Scottish, Chinese and Asian.

With restaurants offering casual dining to fine dining, there is something for everyone. There are also watering holes which you can pop into after your meal, so that you can have a night cap after your meal.

An ideal all-in-one location for a night out in town!"
,,Harry's @ Chijmes,4.0,,Very nice place to have a chilled beer and hang out with mates !!! I have been to Chijmes several times - very chic !!! I would recommend it highly !
,,Handy if you're staying at The Carlton.,5.0,,A great place to visit if you're staying at the hotel across the road. We originally thought it was a venue for business lunches and that there was one aisle/street of cafes/restaurants but approached it from a different direction the next day and found it was much bigger than first thought. There is a lively vibe to the place and a variety of dining options/budgets. We opted for Japanese one night and American the next and we enjoyed both visits.
,,Relax environment good meal good friends,5.0,,"I recently went there looking for food with an overseas guest. Newly renovated and the whole area cleaned up, I love the vibes and the surrounding. I love the choices. I ended up at Harry's for beer and buffalo wings. Yummmm. You look up and there is a beautiful church just above....awesome space to hang out with friends."
,,Lots of restaurants and bars to choose from,4.0,,"Have been here a couple of times and on the last visit, today, found many restaurants have gone. There is still a good selection and I don't think you'll struggle to find somewhere to eat."
,,"A piece of Singapore History, newly revamped and ready to entice!",4.0,,"The restaurants here went through some major revamp. Some old names were kept while other moved on. There was a good mix of international cuisines where tourists and locals alike will enjoy. The overall revamp of chijmes seemed to be less predictable and ""touristy"" .prices of food are not low but there are better selections than before the revamp. I see many locals coming here too. The old building is left untouched with enough restoration work done. Good job in keeping this place intact and alive."
,,Good selection of eateries,4.0,,"If you don't know where to go for dinner in Singapore, Chijmes is a good location. It has a dozen or more eateries, and a cuisine for everyone."
,,Neat Place,4.0,,"I stayed at Carlton Hotel during my recent trip to Singapore which was directly across the street from Chijmes. It stretches a city block on every side and holds restaurants and bars. Came here to Toast Box for breakfast one morning. The next day, we took a stroll through the complex in the evening. The scene is bustling with restaurants yet peaceful with it's elegant decor. I didn't eat at any of the other restaurants or bars but you don't need to spend much time checking it out. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area."
,,Beautifully restored convent complex,4.0,,"Located diagonally opposite Raffles Hotel is Chijmes (pronounced as ""chimes"") which was gazetted as a national monument in 1990. Chijmes is an old Catholic Convent and the first building on the site commenced construction in 1840, other buildings including the chapel were added over time. After the convent closed in 1983 the complex was refurbished and now operates as a bar, dining and venue centre. Here the tourist has the opportunity to walk around the site, to take in the history and the many photo opportunities that exist, including ""The Gate of Hope"" where abandoned babies were left for the nuns to care for. The site is well worth a visit and while the bars and eateries are not the most competitively priced (but much more reasonable than the nearby Raffles Hotel), the tourist could easily spend time in this setting. The Esplanade and City Hall MRT stations are within easy walking distance."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"This is a late review, however came here year ago! It really us a hidden gem, pretty and a must when visiting the area."
,,Visit following Renovations,4.0,,"First visit following the recent renovations, place has changed quite a bit and a lot of the old venues have gone. As per other reviews there appear to be quite a few Japanese restaurants around the ground floor entrance... Harry's Bar is here along with a mix of Mexican, European (Highlander), American (Applebee's) and Singapore's Prive where we had a very good late breakfast.
Would be nice for a few more places to be open early where you could grab a coffee and breakfast...place is still geared for night time when it really comes alive. The de consecrated church now called Chijmes Hall is still a magnificent looking building day or night. Will be interested to see the place when all the outlets are open as there are still hoardings in place where new venues are planned. A few seats in the garden area would be good too, just to sit under the trees and enjoy this quiet spot during the day."
,,Beautifully Restored,4.0,,"A collection of newly restored buildings, lovely grounds and many restaurant choices. Just love the Cathedral, it's a beautiful building. A great place to sit, eat and relax by day and still take in a little buzz."
,,Peaceful and beautiful,4.0,,The entire Chijmes Centre is just beautiful and so well maintained. There are so many wonderful restaurants in the area and the picnic on the lawn is a must-do with kids. The church is beautifully restored. The Gate of Hope and the history surrounding the whole area is really interesting and worth the visit. Comes highly recommended!
,,One of the heritage attractions,4.0,,"It's really beautiful here! came here around evening, listening to a band singing basanova, a group of kids playing and jumping around, different racial groups chit-chatting and laughing, some more it was during sunset. Just simply stunning."
,,Great architecture - have fun pronouncing the name,4.0,,Chai-jimmies? Che-jims? Chi-jams? Chij-ammies? I know I certainly used all four to pronounce Chijmes. Sadly it was closed for restoration when we visited but it certainly looks impressive.
,,A place to just sit and relax without the hustle and bustle,5.0,,"I love the newly restored chijmes, I feel like I have found a little hidden gem just sitting amongst the towering buildings, hidden from the world by white washed walls and a stunning church. Inside you will find green gardens edged by trendy bars and restaurants, the food is great and the scenery is peaceful."
,,Enjoyable night out!,4.0,,"Had a very enjoyable meal at Chijmes, with a slight Scottish theme, staff in kilts! All meals were lovely and plenty of food on plates. The hot chocolate pudding for dessert was to die for!! Chocolate lovers heaven! Will defo eat here again. Lovely surrounding within an old Cathedral setting."
,,Beautifully restored to its former glory,5.0,,"There is nothing better than returning to a place you love, to see it fully restored to its former glory. I was at chijmes in July 14 when it was a renovation nightmare. Tonight to be able to walk into the stunning cathedral was just magical. I actually gave off one of those pathetic ghasps when walking into the beautifully restored church. They have developed the area and old convent to beautifully restore the old buildings, whilst carefully introducing modern restaurants. For fantastic bar deals head to highlander bar, which is outside but downstairs in the open airbasement area and Offers 50% off
cocktails, beers and wine until 9pm, a great location as you take in the cathedral that stands over the basement area. If your ever in Singapore please come and spend an evening here, just make sure you bring your camera."
,,"Newly renovated, very charming hangout spot",4.0,,"While renovation works are underway to restore this so very charming structure, restaurants and bars which are already opened truly brings this venue alive. Not your typical church, Chijmes has been converted into an entertainment spot where one can enjoy a great dinner and bar hop. A must visit if you've never been, or re-visit if you haven't been here since before the renovation."
,,So beautiful,5.0,,"I stay in Swissotel the Stamford and take a walk here before stat my day. Here is so beautiful with comfortable garden and white church. Also, here has many restaurants and bar. It's such a pity I didn't have chance to have a meal or drink here."
,,Not your usual entertainment venue,4.0,,"Chijmes is an interesting concept. They converted a former church and the associated properties into an interesting array of bars, restaurants and galleries. Here is secluded hideaway from the noise and traffic of Singapore's CBD. Although a tad pricey for the fare, the service and location makes for an enjoyable evening when you can actually hear the conversation at your table. Well recommended."
,,"Light and airy, lots of food choices",4.0,,"The recently renovated Chijmes is nicer than ever. It retains its interesting architecture in the form of the old, converted convent, and the well manicured lawns which provide welcome greenery in the heart of the city. There are a range of interesting restaurants, cafes and bars, including some exciting brand new eateries. These establishment offer a choice of pleasant alfresco dining, or eating in air-conditioned comfort, with the some of the restaurants being connected by light filled walkways with glass canopies."
,,A must go place if you are in singapore,4.0,,Have been in love with the place since the first time I went there...but it had been under renovation for quite some time...so did not think of it especially for bringing in the new year...but what a surprise it was to go there and since not everybody knew about its opening there were less people so finding a nice place on new years eve that is less crowded was a miracle....nice food good ambience and lovely evening ...
,,"""Oasis"" in Singapore",5.0,,"Do not if I misunderstood Chijmes because it is a lovely place with a church I believe it was and then also a place to go for drinks and food. They have some nice bars and restaurants and everything shielded from all traffic. It feels like you are not in a big city but a very tranquil place to enjoy, hang out with friends and loved ones and just doze off into the evening with some good food and drinks. Especially one place was super hip and we went there a couple of times during our visit - Privé. Very cool place with excellent food and good drinks."
,,If Jesus was alive he would go spare,4.0,,"Not sure if converting a convent into a place of drink and debauchery is the brightest idea - but it works
Its a great setting to just hang out and chill or party the night away

A variety of drinking holes and eateries and when the footie or other major sporting event is on - giant screens fill the courtyard and it becomes a cauldron of activity

Worth a visit"
,,A jewel deconsecrated to a cafe,3.0,,"Winner of Merit Award of UNESCO Asia Pacific Heritage Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation in 2002.

After a major conservation effort, it is now converted into a plaza of theme retail and mediocre food and beverage outlets interspersed with ample outdoor spaces and courtyards, cloistered walls and long, covered walkways.

A haven in the city, unfortunately is no more a place of worship."
,,A bit of a letdown - This time,3.0,,"We have been coming to Chijmes quite a few times over the past 5 years, but now it seems to have been overtaken by Japanese bars and restaurants and bigger chain bars. Before there was something for everyone but now it just seemed to corporate. No fashion and nik-nak shops, no Aussie bar, not many good happy hour deals which always draw people in and too much boom boom music at Harrys."
,,"Rats, ants, lizards, burnt pizza, heavily disguised included service charge and an £8 pint",1.0,,"See above. Maybe it's your thing. Not so much mine.

Rats over my feet, ants and lizards on my plate ( no 'bush tucker trial' ordered) pizza woeful, beer overpriced, service slack and disingenuous.

Nb. There are maybe decent places in the food complex - I was at 'P&C'."
,,Former convent,4.0,,After visiting Raffles hotel I decided to stroll across road to the Chijmes complex. Built in 1854 as Convent of holy infant Jesus. Chijmes has been transformed to a modern cafe/boutiques. I had a couple of drinks one evening. Value for money
,,Mediocre restaurants and bars,3.0,,"Nothing really special in this place. Fairly generic selection of bars and restaurants but nothing really spectacular. Popular place for drinks on a Thurs or Fri night,"
,,Cool hangout place with plenty of places for a drink and munch,4.0,,"It is a great place at a convenient location. Most places / joints are cool Veg options are limited. Harry's is recommended out there for its chicken, beer and flat breads (like pizza)"
,,Gorgeous setting,4.0,,"The building itself is great (definitely phot worthy) add in the many restaurant options, and the proximity to Raffles Hotel, and why would you not visit Chijmes when in Singapore? :)"
,,Soulless expat restaurant complex for those who want to avoid any kind of culture or atmosphere,1.0,,"This kind of place makes me embarrassed to be an expat. Painfully generic, they prioritise ""something for everyone"" over taste, interest and atmosphere. There's a disproportionate number of Japanese restaurants, an oyster bar, and several ""tick all the boxes"" generic pizza/pasta places. It's about the furthest away you can get from Singapore, whilst still in Singapore."
,,Not a church,3.0,,"This was once a beautiful church, now converted to events and restaurants. Most of the restaurants were Japanese and between service when we visited. Nice to see if you are in the area."
,,Nice place for a meal,5.0,,"There is currently some renovation going on, but, all of the restaurants were open. The setting is lovely and it's reasonably quiet given it's central location."
,,More food in a nice atmosphere,4.0,,"Built around a church building and its surrounds, chijmes is a selection of bars . and . restaurants.

Next to raffles shopping centre and city hall mrt station it is easily accessible.

The bars have live bands which rocks you through to the early hours of the morning but you can also find nice cosy restaurants.

Dining alfresco is also prominent in chijmes.

Have a try...you wont regret"
,,Romantic,4.0,,"If you wanna bring out your girlfriedn or wife to a nice and quiet spot in the city, you should book one of the restaurants at Chijmes. Its in the city center, just next to the Swissotel and Cityhall MRT, so very accessible. Theres an Argentinian restaurant that is good, and one high class chinese and a korean bbq restaurant (less romantic). The rest are bars for watching soccer."
,,Under Construction but please visit!,4.0,,This is a converted church and surrounds. It's a great little distraction from the busy shopping centers nearby and you can have a meal and/or a drink at one of the establishments in the vast grounds.
,,Restaurants of Singapore,4.0,,The old Chijmes has been turned into a variation of restaurants and pubs with a selection of Japanese restaurants of all types. A tad expensive but excellent food and presentation whichever restaurant you choose
,,A new experience and still beautiful,4.0,,"After reading reviews on Chijmes while in Singapore late July 2014, I was reluctant to go as the picture painted was not one of what I remembered of Chijmes and sounded like it was having a complete overhaul and not open. As we were staying opposite, we decided to give it a go. I myself did love the old Chijmes and the open air ambiance and hawkers stalls that I remembered from years ago, with the backdrop of the beautiful building which was originally a convent. This recent experience was completely different however I feel the place is amazing, Its just a modern version. Yes its different its now been decked out with funky bars and restaurants, but the food is amazing and service is extremely welcoming and warm. All staff in all the restaurants are very keen to welcome you to their establishment. After our first evening visit we ended up going back 3 days in a row for breakfast at Dimbulah. Amazing coffee and great service and extremely well priced. Dimbulah happened to have one of our favourite beers Kronenbourg 1664 Blanc which you can not get in Australia and here on tap for happy hour so we were won over instantly. Most of the restaurants are now open for business and the feel and ambiance was great. Its a modern electric atmosphere without being pretentious and opposite where we ate there was a fantastic wine bar. If you are after hawkers markets and the old chijmes then unfortunately no this is not the atmosphere now, but if you want to put on a summer dress, enjoy some tapas, wine, or a happy hour then give it a go. Its still a beautiful place to dine. My only cringe moment was seeing a Hogs Breath cafe at Chijmes and luckily its up the other end, but it just does not suit the venue apart from that it was a great experience."
,,Historic place. Featured architecture.,3.0,,"With religious history and of historical features. A couple was shooting video/photos in the place. Unluckily, the outer building was under construction at that time. A bit disturbing to the peaceful environment."
,,Over -hyped,2.0,,"I've been to Chijmes on many occasions in the past. After a gap of four years I returned to Singapore and revisited Chijmes. What a waste of time. The renovations, supposedly completed in May are no-where finished. There is no feeling to the place, no decent restaurants, no ambience of any kind. Gone are the interesting shops, the pleasant open space and vibe of the place. I don't know what the owners are planning - there was no-one to ask when I visited. But on the form I saw I will not bother to go back. One of the few disappointments of Singapore

Incidentally, with a spread of reviews earned by Chijmes. I do not see how it deserves a Certificate of Excellence by Trip Advisor"
,,Wait until later 2014 before trying for food/drink!,2.0,,Used to be really good place to go for various restaurants and pubs however most of it is currently closed for refurb which was really disappointing. Hopefully when it's complete some of the previous atmosphere and buzz will return.
,,History Outside Change Inside.,4.0,,A beautiful old building that was once a Convent. This is a sensational find amongst many in the CBD. A delightful piece of scenery from the outside. As with many opportunities in Singapore it is just easy to walk around and explore and find. There are many Churches in the CBD and many notable Civic Buildings that are presently under restoration. Many parts of Singapore are getting a much needed cut and polish.
,,Great for a quick photography stop,4.0,,"I think of the great things about Singapore is building preservation. CHIJMES is another one of them. Formerly a convent, it is converted to a destination of restaurants and bars. Even if the dining and drinking options there don't appeal to you, it makes a wonderful visit for how the convent architecture is now integrated into this night time destination which also means it's perfect for a quick photography stop."
,,Only Time will Tell,3.0,,Revisited Chijmes as we had fond memories from a previous visit but we should not have expected time to have stood still in Singapore. It had lost the character that we remembered so we did not stop but maybe when the refurbishments are complete it will have a better feel. Food was costly at one of the restaurants we investigated.
,,"Out with Old, In with New",4.0,,"Chijmes is undergoing major renovations. Worth a look if you're in the area. The first new venue opened two months ago, an Australian coffeehouse. A few more have opened since, and several others, including the Don Katsu sake cafe, will open soon. Dimbula's coffee is great, they serve breakfast till 1700, and have some tasty pastries: lamingtons and brownies. Good new addition.

Chijmes is a beautiful place to go, and I spent some memorable pleasant nights there on prior visits to Singapore. I wish them well, but alas, when it's out with the old, in with the new, sometimes what you lose is more valuable than what you gain.

There are very few things on earth stronger that Aussie espresso, but hundred-year-old Laphroaig is certainly one of them. Losing the best whisky bar East of Suez is quite a loss. Whisky connaisseurs needn't mourn. The Auld Alliance isn't dead; it's relocated to the RendezVous Hotel at where Bras Basah turns into Orchard. Rendezvous there instead of at Chijmes."
,,A Great Find,4.0,,"The Chijmes complex is surrounded by extremely high walls this is because it was a convent school for girls in a former life. It is located in the commercial area right behind the landmark Raffles Hotel.
The area has been transformed into a leisure area containing numerous bars and restaurants. It used to be much busier a few years ago but still is a fun place to go."
,,Buzzing in the evening,4.0,,"The Chijmes was originally the Catholic Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus. On Victoria Street it is close to the Commercial district and also close to Raffles Hotel. It looks like a private building from the outside and we only found it whilst looking for the Lei Garden Restaurant. The architecture is beautiful, with bars and restaurants in the convent buildings and in the cloisters. The building is under renovation so will definitely go back on my next visit to Singapore to see how it looks when finished.
Pour
Our hotel was on Orchard Road which was an easy walk back."
,,Rather less life than I was expecting,3.0,,"I was here many years ago, and had fond memories of a lively buzzing happening place. On my return though, I was rather underwhelmed. Admittedly, much of the complex is under renovation, to open in May - but still rather dead in the evenings with few places just to sit and have a drink"
,,Hidden Gem,5.0,,We found this venue by just walking the streets as it was not mentioned in the hotel info and from the outside it appears a bit private however once entering it is very inviting. We found a variety of different venues to eat at and the ambience adds to the overall experience. Overall a peasant experience and I doubt you would not find something enjoyable to eat !
,,Great Food and Ambience,4.0,,"This is Chijmes, an old church which now acts as a commercial/ community centre. A great place to get some excellent food from around the world.

We met some friends there for dinner and drinks and must say was quite awe'd by the place. On one side, sits a quaint church on the ground level and you sit in what is almost a basement, but open to air. On the other side you have a choice of restaurants and bars that serve all kinds for cuisine to suit your appetite.

I'm told that there are some nice shows and bands that play there normally, when we were there, there was a football match live on a big screen.

Definitely recommend this place for the ambience and food."
,,Old church converted into shopping centre and food court,3.0,,"The outside of the place is quite beautiful, especially in the sunshine. Other than that it's just a run of the mill shopping arcade and food court."
,,Only looks like a church.,3.0,,"What looks like a church at first (it was, in the past) is actually a mini shopping mall with shops, restaurant and cafes. Once you get over the fact the the building looks like a church from the outside, it's not particularly intersting inside."
,,Good place to meet up and decent food,4.0,,We met up with friends at Chijmes. The setting is cool and with the former chapel and surrounding buildings all lit up. We ate at Lava drinks were not too expensive i guess standard for singapore at $S10 a pint of beer and the food was decent. There was 4 of us and the bill came to about $80 with a few drinks so not too bad. We went around 8pm and was fairly quiet by time we had finished was pretty busy. There is plenty of choice to be had in the complex sushi as BBQ or italian or sushi to name a few. to BBQ to Pizza.
,,Quite fun!,4.0,,The church offers a fun backdrop to the Hogs Breath restaurant with great steak and wine. Relaxing place to sit and watch the world go by.
,,Great place - must go!,5.0,,"I felt completely stupid after realising, 2 days into my first time in Singapore, that the Chijmes centre was right opposite my hotel the Carlton! I'd read about it here and elsewhere, but hadn't made the connection ... I've always been churches and this, a de-consecrated former Catholic convent school that I could see from my hotel room, intrigued me.

On our second evening, wondering what to do after a so-so time in Chinatown, we decided to take a look. It consists of a number of restaurants, some offices and small shops. We wandered in, and were immediately faced with the 'Hogs Breath Aussie Bar'. Normally, living in Bangkok, I'd avoid something named like this like the plague, but in fact, it was great! Don't judge a book by its cover!

The waitresses were great, helpful and could not have been nicer. ( See further review) One in particular explained a lot about SG, where to go and what to do, the costs and a lot of information I'd have found hard to get in just 4 days.

The centre itself was intriguing, with spiral staircases, an open lower level with restaurants and great old style architecture.

Well worth a short visit, and I can certainly recommend the Aussie bar - and also very close to places like Bugis market, Chinatown and Bayfront, if you don't mind walking a little ..."
,,"Great place to eat & drink away the evening, live footie if interested!!",4.0,,"Great central location of several bars & restaurants in a lively plaza atmosphere, some have live music others rock the night away or just chill out and watch live footie, something for everyone. Enjoy."
,,Only in Singapore...,4.0,,"Beautiful old convent now used as a nightlife sanctuary of bars and restaurants. None of the restaurants are extraordinary but there is a nice tapas bars, standard pubs and Insomnia has fun, live music later in the evening. The only problem is that on busy nights the toilets are usually disgusting and devoid of toilet paper."
,,Come and dine at night,4.0,,"It's one of those great mix between old and new that you usually find in European countries. It's looks nice during the day, but even better during the night. Lot's of restaurants to choose from with laid back atmosphere of the ever busy city.. it's can be romantic, too :)"
,,Night city,5.0,,"Come here for dinner and bask in the chill out mood here. You are transported into a night city of it's own the moment you step into chijmes. Whip out your camera as the historical building makes for very beautiful night shots. Enchanting, I would say. Plenty of night bars and cafes."
,,Bars and restaurants around a beautiful convent,4.0,,"Chijmes, or Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus, is a Catholic convent along Victoria street.
The convent hall was built in 1904. It is a beautiful, well maintained convent hall, with a tall spire atop the front. The convent hall has it's front facing the main gate along Victoria street, and the other 3 sides have bars and restaurants that have a classical, traditional and beautiful setting beside the convent hall, are still lively and is a very nice place to spend an evening.
Among the restaurants is Carnivore, a Brazilian churrascaria.
I can't put my finger on it but there's something about the convent hall building that gives it a really nice, classically French look...."
,,Great Atmosphere,4.0,,Had dinner there two nights in a row. Lovely to sit out in the evening. Good variety of restaurants and the backdrop of the church in the grounds is nice. The bar with 100's of bottles of Scotch is an intriguing place.
,,Moderisation that Works,4.0,,"The people that have modenised this old Monastery have done the place proud. The central church has been turned into a banquet hall for weddings a functions, and then the surrounding buildings in a court yard arrangement have been turned over to bars and restaurants. So, shielded from the noise of the city outside, you can pick anyone of the many restaurants and sit for a drink and food with a well restored church as the backdrop. Worth a visit on two accounts, wonder around the old Monastery buildings and have a beer and meal in the evening."
,,recently renovated in October 2013.,5.0,,"The Good =)
~Testament on how old buildings can be made relevant for modern mixed-typed-developments.
~Plenty of F&B to choose from.

The Bad =(
~Expensive parking.
~Due to higher rentals here, F&B outlets are perceived to have marked-up-menu-prices.

My Tip for future visits:
~Park@ SMU Admin Building & walk across & save money."
,,"Beautiful architecture, unexpected find",4.0,,"We visited Chijmes for a work evening party - I wasn't sure what to expect, not being familiar with the venue. Very positive first impressions - the architecture is absolutely stunning, we visited Insomnia which is a club that features a live band in part of the converted building; a breath of fresh air going somewhere like this.

It's an intimate space but it managed to stay cosy rather than crowded, the live music was brilliant with a good selection of covers interspersed with a DJ playing from an old pulpit!

What should have felt slightly irreverent actually stayed classy throughout the evening - though I did leave before my colleagues, so who knows!"
,,Chimjes.,5.0,,"Really pleasant way to spend an evening with friends & family.

Restaurants to choose from in an old church,lovely surroundings,good quality food,drinks,& a nice ambience,the one we went to was called 'The Hogs Breath'.

It is next to a busy road,but as its set in a courtyard,you hardly notice it."
,,Memorable place,5.0,,"This was an old orphanage and girls convent school in the 19th century Singapore. My wife, sister and many friends studied here in the 1980s and 1990s. I hope that the relevant authorities will restore this old building and the chapel properly, befitting the legacy of Singapore's history."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"It's a very beautiful place near the City Hall/Bras basah MRT station.
I went here several times and tried the Pizzeria Giardino and Harry's. Both are very nice.
It seems like the place is part of the church that has been revamped and become one of the best nightlife center in Singapore."
,,Great alternative for dinner,4.0,,"Food is great, price is reasonable and the best part is that you can fell the romantic and beautiful view at night.."
,,Jugs of spirits......,5.0,,We went to Cuscaden - a quiet little bar in a corner of Chijmes. Live music every night which was nice to sit and listen after a day sightseeing. One of the benefits was the Jugs of spirits that they served which was pretty cheap when you compare it to a single glass. We both really enjoyed our night here and would come back if we return to Singapore
,,Lovely scenery,4.0,,"I had a great time at the chijmes when I visited. I went on a Saturday night and it was great. I've seen afew comments on here about appalling service which I didn't receive at all but it does depend on the place and also the person. I had fantastic service at the Brazilian BBQ and the food was delish. Quite expensive, spent about 530 but it was a great night with good food so it was worth it. The church itself is beautiful I can totally we why it's a wedding venue. Definitely visit again when in singapore."
,,Church and around it..,5.0,,"I just can say, you'll find a plenty of expensive food. Fine Dining. I would suggest you came at night so you can see the citylight around the complex. However, if you want cheap food, just come at evening... around 12 pm will be okay, find the promo from internet. Lots of restaurants with great discounts!"
,,Super spot,5.0,,"Chijmes is very near Raffles Hotel and I only came across it when looking for Raffles. It is an old nunnery, but even now in the hustle and bustle of the city, it offered a bit of cool and quiet. The place is full of bars and restaurants. Here you can get a Singapore sling much cheaper than at Raffles and it tastes better too because it is not a pre-mix.

There is an art gallery and the Hall there is beautiful.

Even if, like me, you are not eating or drinking or shopping or visiting the gallery at Chijmes, it is worth having a wonder around and marvelling at the scene."
,,A good visit on a leisure day,5.0,,"This once catholic convent, now turned into an art-gallery catches your eye as you are crossing Victoria Street. It is now used for commercial purposes that include dining, shopping and entertainment, providing a backdrop for musicals and theatrical performances. Do drop in this place when there's an ongoing event and you can have a look around the place"
,,Peaceful,4.0,,For months I walked past Chijmes without understanding exactly what was inside the courtyard. There are lots and lots of restaurants here - probably aimed more at the expat society or visitors than locals but its such a nice place to come to of an evening when the church is floodlit and the city building that surround you are all lit up. We now take our overseas visitors here for a drink and a meal.
,,A hidden gem in Singapore...,5.0,,Chijmes is one of my favorite places in Singapore. It used to be a church but now the grounds are full of bars and pubs. It is very close to the Singapore River so you can walk from there or you can take the MRT (City Hall MRT Station or Bras Basah MRT Station). Parking is a bit expensive so I would recommend that you take the MRT. This is a beautiful place to spend a relaxing evening/night (I think it is better in the evening/night)...and soak up the fantastic atmosphere.
,,Glad they kept this!,4.0,,"Oh, this is childhood memory. I wish my daughter will hold her wedding lunch/dinner here. Good food and just awesome sitting around looking up to the sky or absorbing the quietness in a busy city!"
,,Worth a look through,4.0,,"Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus was once a school in the heart of Singapore. CHIJMES Hall (赞美礼堂), and Caldwell House, now an art gallery, have both been gazetted as national monuments. The complex has been restored for commercial purposes as a dining, shopping and entertainment centre with ethnic restaurants, shops and a function hall. Worth a look and this venue has been gazetted by the UNESCO World Heritage. You will also find the oldest residential house on this site. Unfortunately the hall of the church is usually closed but occassionally you will find it brilliantly lit up with great chandelliers from the ceilings as I did on my visit."
,,2nd time at Cuscaden and it was just as much fun,4.0,,"First stumbled across the Cuscaden at CHIJMES as we were making our way back from the New Asia Bar.

We were just as impressed the second time around. Filipino wait staff left much to be desired but drink prices were reasonable and the crowd and atmosphere, coupled with the good live music certainly makes this a place worth visiting especially when you consider that there are so many other good venues within the ChIJmes complex."
,,Nice place to relax,4.0,,"This was across from my hotel. They have a great food selection, eat there a couple of evenings and the food was good. A couple of evenings they had live bands. It was fun to go hang out and listen to music before heading back to the hotel."
,,Office Friday Night Outing,4.0,,Great variety of bars and eating..Went to a Flamenco festival with a crowd from my office and it was a lot of fun.
,,INSOMIA ROCKS!!!,5.0,,i love this place....its where i meet my friends.....the bands are mix wirh locals and foreigners....the sound and food was excellent.....its a place where I can recommend to my friends when they need to unwind....
,,Romantic,4.0,,"Romantic place, perfect to celebrate anniversaries and valentines day with your loved ones. I was at Hogs Breath Cafe and the atmosphere was very vibrant, colourful yet romantic with its lightings and balloons."
,,Nice Place But Bad Management,3.0,,"I come and visit this place to take some pictures. At the time I was just starting out, suddenly admonished by security and asked permission and then give that information to take pictures in the area now have permission and pay."
,,Lots to do within walls,4.0,,It's an old converted church with the walled grounds converted into numerous eateries and shops. Depending on your time of visted it can be chilled...but it also houses some late night bars and clubs. Lunches are relaxed and tranquil . 3 a.m its rocking with clubs ...live bands and a few girlie bars ! No trouble...aggro free...lively...young...a bit risqué but it you dont want to go home until 6a.m...this is the place
,,Chijmes Area,3.0,,"Right nearby the Fairmont Singapore and Raffles Hotel, Chijmes is a shopping/nightclub/restaurant area in a converted Convent. Outside area is very nice with several places to eat and drink.

Beers are about $12 HKD for a pint (fairly typical) in the open bar. Sat and watched some soccer games. Service was fair, not exceptional but what do you expect from a bar.

I would definitely go back and recommend anyone visit if for no other reason than to see the very interesting architecture."
,,Nice place for dining in a calm historical setting,5.0,,You won't regret your visit there. It is one of rare places in Singapore which has a European feeling. You can eat well there too.
,,Disappointing transition from the original convent,3.0,,"Touted as a high end enclave, we were disappointed. Whilst the buildings have been preserved, the food options were limited and unappealing. Shops were minimal and high priced. The courtyard is delightful & a haven from the busy roads outside."
,,Beautiful building,4.0,,"The CHIJMES building and campus is beautiful and the chapel is a much sought after wedding venue. The food venues can be a bit hit and miss, however, and the turnover during the past few years reflects this. We mainly go to enjoy Carnivores, the Brazilian churrascaria. There are some pretty cool bars and intimate dining venues in the basement, our favourite being Cuscaden, which can be a great late-night chill out music venue. Sit in the courtyard and listen to live music."
,,A great selection of places to eat,4.0,,ALl the restaurants in this location are of great quality and you have many choices ranging from 5 start through to pizza in the outdoor area. Major sporting events are shown live in the courtyard here.
,,Devoid of atmosphere,3.0,,"In its rush to cover over anything remotely historic, Singapore is in danger of becoming a soulless “international” city state with no sense of itself (although the trade-off is the incredible economic success).

Chijmes exemplifies the trend, an old convent converted to a night spot with bars and restaurants. We ate at the Seoul Korean Charcoal BBQ, it was antiseptic in atmosphere (too much lighting) and the service was average. The server seemed to try hard but there was not a real sense of them trying to make the experience special, an example was that we ordered the Korean beer, when it arrived (already opened) we were given glasses with ice in them because the beer was not chilled. If we had known it was not chilled we would have ordered the tiger beer.

The food was similar, it was OK, but when persuaded to have the prawns they came frozen (given the massive local production of prawns, I would have expected that they were fresh).

All in all I wish that I could recommend a better place to eat but I am not certain they are found in abundance in Singapore."
,,Nice cafe style food and beer gardens,4.0,,If you are sick of going up to eat or being enclosed try Chijmes with its outdoor bars and café options. Drink during happy hour!
,,More for the drinks than for the dinner,4.0,,"Many pubs and restaurants. I've been here a few times for drinks with some friends. Not a typical favourite, but its worth a visit.. Probably not during the football seasons since it'll be really crowded and rowdy."
,,From Catholic school to shop-food center,3.0,,"Nothing special about it, many places inside where you can choose to go to shop, eat or party. different kind of western food restaurants, etc. The most interesting is to know than the Chives was and catholic school and not a church as usually thinks the people."
,,Beautiful romantic place in the evening,5.0,,Lovely place to visit for food or drinks on an evening with your other half. In the daytime most of the restaurants are closed and it doesn't look as nice.
,,not worth it,2.0,,"we had dinner few times in different restaurants there and the quality ( portion size) is not direct proportional with the price we've paid for.
For example we spent 100 SGD for two drinks and a pork menu in Senor Taco, a Mexican restaurant.
The food was not great (after waiting to be served for more than 30 min) and staff quite bored.

Instead I recommend bar and grill restaurant wich is opposite to Chijmes (next to German restaurant)"
,,Overpriced,2.0,,"Chijmes in any other Northern Hmisphere country would be great, a lovely open air plaza of high priced restaurants and bars, hoever doesn't fit here. The quality of food, prices and choice just don't meet the the freshness, quality or originality of the local choices."
,,"Nice enough location, shame about the food, the service, and the prices!",1.0,,"Severe case of image over substance... a tourist trap pretending to offer so much yet unable to deliver.
We tried the Spanish tapas bar - the food was inedible and bore scant relation to anything I've eaten in Spain - greasy, chewy and inedible!
Overpriced, certainly not an experience I wish to repeat! No second chances!"
,,Nothing amazing,3.0,,"Restaurants are over-priced and there is nothing really amazing about it, except for the old architecture. We went to the Brazilian restaurant there. We kept asking for the best Brazilian cut: picanha. But the waiter kept refusing to bring it in until my husband lost his temper and finally we had picanha 45 minutes later. Naturally, picanha is the most expensive cut there is and the restaurant serves you the cheaper cuts in order to save money. Tourists won't know the difference, but their problem was that there were a couple of Brazilians at our table. In addition, one of the waiters was really rude and crude in his manners. As for the other restaurants, I've heard of a few that could be good."
,,Interesting but with ordinary restaurants,3.0,,Interesting place with loads of history but generally restaurants are ordinary and quite expensive. Good for a lunch but wouldn't go back for dinner - there are much better places around.
,,Chijmes... More than just a church...,4.0,,Actually... it's just a chapel now i think...BUT... The place is surrounded by bars and restaurants.. And it has a great variety of them too... Spend a few days/nights checking this place out... Lots to do and see.
,,Former Convent School,4.0,,"CHIJmes used to house a convent school - Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ). Established during the colonial days of Singapore, it was (and still is) an all-girls' school. The teachers are no longer Catholic nuns though.

When land prices in Singapore started rising in the 1980s onwards, schools located in the Central Business District were relocated to the suburbs and fringe areas. The building of those schools that relocated earlier were torn down, for example, the site where Raffles Institution once stood was redeveloped into the existing Raffles City.

Other former school buildings (including this site) were spared that fate through adaptive conservation - The original structures were preserved, but taken over by private enterprises and converted to more lucrative uses, including retail and F&B.

The current name incorporated the initials of the former school, while sounding like the chimes of the school bells that used to ring regularly.

There are restaurants inside for a nice meal and a drink or two in the evenings. In the day time, especially the weekends, you may come across a wedding ceremony being held inside the former chapel.

Remember to walk along the outside of the boundary walls of the development. You will come across a small metallic gate along one of the walls. In the old days, girls and women who gave birth out of wedlock would leave their baby girls outside this gate. Baby girls were also abandoned because then, boys were deemed to be more precious and valuable because they carry on the family lineage. The kind nuns would take in these abandoned girls and adopt them.

Admire the architecture, enjoy the food and drinks, but do take some time to soak in the historicity of the place as well...."
,,Very Interesting!,3.0,,"A very interesting and nice place to just chill out (church turned into a dinning/ drinking forum) . I don't think the restaurants here are superb but if you are staying nearby, do visit at night."
,,Nostalgic Charm of the Good Old School Days,4.0,,This used to be my school for 10 years. The restallation work for the compound was very well done..... I can still vivdly remember most of my school days joy while I was having a drink after work in the evening with friends.
,,Wonderful place for a drink,4.0,,This is one of the prettiest places I've visited in Singapore. The atmosphere is great and it's the perfect place to have a drink and just enjoy the view :)
,,good restaurants and bars,5.0,,"this place is really nice, restaurants with very good food (the pizzas are really awesome) and you can eat outside :-)"
,,Wonderful setting and good choice of food,4.0,,"We headed for Chijmes after the obligatory but expensive visit to Raffles.
The setting and ambience are amazing, especially after dark, with the former chapel and surrounding buildings lit up.
We chose Harry's bar. Drinks were not too expensive and the food was really good. My only criticism was the servers seemed to get confused at to who was bringing what at points. We had to ask 3 times for water to be brought to the table. That small hiccup aside, the service was generally good and friendly.
There is plenty of choice to be had in the complex; from Sush to BBQ to Pizza and it seems to be a place that would be well worth visiting on a regular basis!"
,,A disappointment,2.0,,"This place was highly recommended but did not live up to the expectation. While the ambiance is good, the selection of restaurants is disappointing - a few restaurant chains are present here. We tired the tapas bar - the menu has some good and interesting Singapore interpretations of tapas however the service was slow and the wine terribly overpriced"
,,Great place to go on first night in Singapore,4.0,,"Old Church and convent converted into a restaurant precinct. Great place to go after dark with old buildings lit up, gardens and water features. There were lots of bars and restaurants, many of them packed on a Friday night. It was great to sit outside and soak up the atmosphere on our first night in Singapore. Food at the restaurant we went to was pretty average but it was worth going to see the place at night."
,,Relaxing atmosphere,4.0,,"This is well worth a visit in the evening for a chilled out drink or dinner. There are lots of bars, restaurants and small shops set in the grounds of an old monastery. I really like the atmosphere here and would recommend Fandango for tapas."
,,A great little hidden Gem of Bars and Restaurants,4.0,,"This church is surrounded by small bars and restaurants from harrys bar, to tapas to pizzas to japanese food, most styles are here. Prices are not bad with average main dishes ranging from $14 - $25 SGD many happy hour offers on from 5 - 8pm with some bars till 9pm. Nice area to sit outside away from traffic with lots going on."
,,"Bars, food and hookers",2.0,,"There are some good bars in here, and if you like football lsot of screens to watch on. Food is varied and plentiful. THe group of hookers onthe entrance is a killer - I want to see the game till full time, not ""love you long time"" - needs a small clean up. Money exchange guy also teid to give me a rate lwoer than advertise,d so beware rip offs at the entrance."
,,A lovely place to relax after a day's shopping.,4.0,,Chijmes is a very pretty self-contained area with some nice bars and restaurants where you can sit and relax and watch the world go by. The pizza place up top is great to go for a wine or two and there are some nice Japanese restaurants too.
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,Wonderful experience for me during the World Cup ! Being in the tent and cheering your team is one hell of a way to spend the evening! Especially if they win!
,,"A strange combination, but it works",4.0,,"Not something I would expect to see within the grounds of a former church and because of that seems strange to be a venue to party.

Surrounding the interior perimeter are a good choice of restaurants, bars and trinket shops. A good mix of to suit all tastes and budget.

I passed this place in the afternoon when it was relatively quiet but seems like this place comes more alive in the evening when I returned.

Good place for food & drink and in a great setting."
,,Is it still open??,2.0,,Nearly deserted when I met a friend there for lunch. The place which advertised as open all hours was emphatically closed. Walked all around looking for a substitute and no luck. We had to go elsewhere! Is chijmes still open for business? Not impressed.
,,Good selection,4.0,,"Lots of great bars and restaurants here, in a good location. Every taste is accommodated, from the simple to the elegant."
,,Lots of choice,4.0,,This is an old monastery near Reffles and City Hall. Well worth a visit - lots of choices for places to eat and drink.
,,Good food court,4.0,,Great restauant choices (from Thai to Japanese and western). The food was just great even tho it's a bit pricy. But again what would you expect from a restaurant in Singapore.
,,"Great surroundings, good dining options",4.0,,"Nice historical surroundings, particularly nice at night when lit up with great dining and bar options (from cheap tourist pubs to higher end food with pretty much every types of cuisine available), Some places with lovely outdoor seating. Convenient evening/lunch dining option for those staying around Raffles and Raffles City like those at Swissotel, Fairmont, or Carlton hotels. Nice to get out of the shopping centres into some nice historical surroundings across the road - even if it is a little but touristy."
,,Mainly food,3.0,,"Good and expensive places to eat here; other than that, there are better things to do an see. There is better shopping in the Orchard Road malls"
,,What have they done to the chapel???,4.0,,"the Convent of the Holy infant Jesus (CHIJ) closed when the URA / LTA decided that they wanted the land for a new MRT. The old structures were kept and the nuns took a lousy deal to relocate to Toa Payoh. I went to wedding reception in the chapel which has been desnactified but it still felt weird having a beer in a church!!!
Lots of restaurants here and good palce for a date...This is where I took my wife on our first date....it was her old primary school!"
,,Quaint European charm in the heart of Singapore,4.0,,"Accessible, good choice there are many places to choose from except Hogs Breath Cafe is way overpriced. Lots of expats."
,,It has everything,4.0,,Chijmes is great for dinner. They have all varieties of food and most bars are open till late on the weekends with good bands and entertainment.
,,Fun place!,4.0,,"Fun place to visit for dining out with friends or guests. Lots of options to choose from and can be happening on the weekends. DEAD on Sundays, however."
,,Nice location for intimate gatherings,4.0,,There are nice restaurants here. My personal favorite is Gyu Kaku. Pricey but if you want an intimate evening with good food go here. This looks lovely at night.
,,Predinner drinks at Chijmes,5.0,,great atmosphere especially after dark. A huge selection of resteraunts and tappas bar. There is even a Hogs Breath there.
,,Chijemes at night,4.0,,"If you are looking for a place to have pre dinner drinks, consider going to Chijmes. The best time to go is when it is night and all the fairy lights are lit in the trees and the chapel is lit up, it is very pretty and prefect to start a romantic night out or for a few drinks with friends."
,,Great selection of restaurants and bars all in one beautiful place,5.0,,"If you find your self in Singapore and fancy something to eat and drink but don't want to walk around looking for suitable places, just get a taxi to Chjimes, this converted church grounds is home to some of the best restaurants and bars in this part of Singapore."
,,Quiet place in the middle of the city,5.0,,Once a church & now converted to a sort of centre housing restaurants & pubs. Once inside the grounds you are shielded by the walls from the hustle & bustle of the city outside. A nice quiet place to sit out in the open or inside & have a meal or a drink. Food options are good.
,,Nice place to go for a meal,4.0,,I like the atmosphere here. No particular restaurant stands out but I can't remember any meals i did not enjoy. it is a nice place to stop by if you are in the area.
,,Great place to hang out,4.0,,"Chijmes is a great collection of bars and restaurants and always buzzing on the weekends. I've eaten at a couple of restaurants here like the Sun & Moon dinign, Lei garden and Indochine. It also has a really good bar tucked away near the entrance, which has a massive collection of whiskies and also serves Absinthe. Unfortunately I have forgotten the name!"
,,Worth a look,5.0,,"This is the shopping, bar and food court place converted from the old Convent and Convent school. It is well worth wandering around, but I think it is targetted at people younger than I am :-)

The old chapel is still there and is well worth a look."
,,Lounge and Food Court,5.0,,great place with expansive food court... good to lounge around...
,,"Beautiful location, some good restaurants",4.0,,"This is a charming location as an old convent. SOme of the restaurants are good, but warning also, some are a bit run down and grubby. Bit of a mixed bag."
,,Good bars and restaurants,4.0,,"Nice converted convent with many shops, restaurants and bars. Good evening destination for some drinks and a dinner if you've already been to Marina Bay area and Quays."
,,Good location but.....,3.0,,"Chijimes is well located, close to transport, not too far from Orchard, and close to many of the better hotels like Raffles, Swissotel, Carlton etc. Its a lovely old church building, which has been turned into assorted eating and drinking venues. However, from my times there, it is a bit of a hang out for the younger set and the would be's if could be's. The prices at some of the businesses are on the high side for Singapore. Its worth a look, but I suggest there are better and better value places to eat in Singapore."
,,"Over priced, but nicely situated",3.0,,"Chijmes is very much in the middle of SGP, a typical hang-out for yuppies with too much money for average food. The scenery is nice: church yard on two levels, close to Raffles Hotel and Swissotel. Was at a reception in the chapel recently - something different, but acoustics unbearable especially if it gets a bit noisy and some band tries to play. For all verbal addresses a real challenge - some serious rehearsals should be must before you try it for a function."
,,A Visit - Historical or Beverages Interest,4.0,,"If you are thinking of visiting this place for food and drink, it would satisfy some people's ""needs"". It is, however, not a place that is going to get all thumbs up.

If you are going there to make a trip done what this place used to be, then it is worth visiting. What I would suggest is to visit this place in the day and at night. Compare the differences and imagine you were once a novice who stayed / lived there. Stand in the courtyard, look up and imagine all those who once worked and lived there. Learn how to appreciate the beauty of it. It is a place worth visiting if you wish to know more of its historical background."
,,Great place where to eat,5.0,,"Plenty of restaurants in a really nice area. Worth a visit if you are hungry, especially at dinner"
,,Nice food and drinks,3.0,,Nice idea to convert this place to an eat and dine area. Building kept its usual construction and style. Nice array of bars and restaurants.
,,Senor Tacos - not that hot,2.0,,I was told the beef tacos were 100% pure US prime rib beef. Hard to believe - tasted a lot like lamb to me.
,,Can't put my finger on it but ...,2.0,,"THis place was a Convent then school for the longest time before the authorities took it back and converted it into an entertainment area with a promise of a vibrant bustling nightlife. Since its opening as CHIJMES some 10 or 12 years ago I think, it has never lived up to that promise. Today, there are some good restaurants there (interspersed with some bad ones too) and some pubs/bars but you don't get a good feeling about the place and it sometimes feels seedy despite everythihng. Add to it an exhorbitant valet only parking ($10) - don't feel the need to go there since there's plenty of other better places to go for a night out."
,,Trashy but fun,3.0,,"We went here late one night after a few drinks elsewhere. The band is great on a Saturday night, an Asian band singing 80's and 90's covers. Perfect after a few drinks. Some of the clientele are questionable but if you're in a big group it can be fun."
,,Where I would bring visitors/family to eat and drink!,4.0,,"Chijmes is actually a former catholic church and convent (the church is still in use) with the cells and gardens now turned into bars, restaurants and outdoor eating spaces.
This place is perfect for watching football and sports as a large outdoor courtyard, all in the shadow of the wonderfully illuminated church, has numerous big screens with plenty of seats and tables. Even so, it still gets very busy on weekends! One of the bars is even the Liverpool FC supporters club of Singapore official viewing place, so beware!
There is a large variety of restaurants and bars, ranging from the classy and expensive to the cheap(er) and dingy(er) but all in all this is probably one of the first places I'd bring any overseas visitor to eat/drink.
Recommended:
Cuscaden@Chijmes - the chicken wings and cheap jugs of San Miguel, often accompanied by live music, make this place a must.
Le Baroque - Down in the courtyard, this place always has good live music and is softer clubbing option to the 'superclubs' such as Zouk."
,,Not quit ethe attraction it was,3.0,,"Restaurants seem to be have gone down hill over the years, but still a relaxing place to go in the heart of the city. Have been to a wedding at the chapel which was amazing."
,,Chijmes go and see!,4.0,,"great ambience. Combination of pubs and variety of restaurants.
Always great to have a drink downstairs. For some reason they stopped showing soccer games on the large screens. sic!
Been many times at Chijmes, always passed by Insomnia Bar,which I finally did go into this time. Place itself, nothing special, but great band!! These guys actually make the place great and wind up the fun. Will go back again for a drink and dance:)
In conclusion, Chijmes is a nice place to go out with for a drink, dinner or dance."
,,Fun evening destination,4.0,,"Even if you didn't feel tempted by any of the wide range (but slightly expensive) restaurants in Chijmes, it would still be worth visiting to soak up the ambience.

From the outside, things are slightly unprepossessing - a whitewashed stone wall with an entrance at each corner of the block - but within it's much more pleasant. The central courtyard is the best place to hang out; there's a water feature, and when we visited (early evening, around 8pm) there was live music being played at the Insomnia bar in one corner of the space. It probably got going properly a few hours later - we had dinner and sloped off home because we were sleepy."
,,Good for a night out with friends. try to avoid mon - thursday,4.0,,"Many bars, good food, good happy hour prices, after happy hour quite expensive"
,,New live in old buildings,4.0,,I like the idea of old buildings and new live. The restaurants there are nice.
,,great bars,4.0,,"Insomnia is fun. Although mostly patroned by old white dudes with Asian female dates. Though to be fair, the crowd is a VERY mixed crowd. Live band is great - love their guitarist. Nice look & feel to this restaurant/bar complex based in an ex-church/school."
,,Old and ancient,3.0,,"It's one of those places you would enter, snap a few pictures, may....be....have a beer or coffee, and that's about it. Absolutely no color at all. Though if you trace back into history it would tell you more. Check out the history telling plaque near the old door along Victoria street."
,,All tastes and Fun under one roof!,5.0,,"From the outside, Chijmes looks like an old building - pretty non descriptive, but inside it is an aladdins cave of every kind of food and restaurant you could want. Great if you are craving western food like pizza, pub food or Mexican. There is a fabulous free club night called Insomnia here too where there is a live band most weekend nights. The whole place is lit up with fairy lights, but don't be fooled most of the boys are there to watch football."
,,Drinks and restaurants in fully restored convent,4.0,,"Do not expect to find religious activities. The place used to house a convent school until government land acquisition to turn it into a commercial complex. The place has been well restored and house many bars and good up market restaurants. These includes one of the best Chinese restaurants Lei Gardens, and the popular Japanese restaurant Sun.

I have just done a walking trail of the area ending at CHIJMES. It could take a full day or half a day, depends on whether you visit the museums as well. There are many beautiful gazetted buildings within the vincinity.
Hope this helps you to enjoy Singapore.

,,Dirty needs a good clean up,3.0,,Disappointingly dirty and condescending staff at the Tapas restaurant.
,,Great place to hang out,5.0,,"Awesome place. Great bars, clubs and eating places at the Chimes. Was a very favorite haunt while at business school and me and my event management buddies are looking at hosting events at the Chimes cathedral."
,,Female customer punched in face by manager,1.0,,"I was out with 2 friends at Le Baroque, enjoying a Saturday night out, until I was punched in the face by the manager/owner of the place. Before I continue, I am a petite, Australian female, with a professional career and cannot believe what happened to us by the staff at Le Baroque, Chijmes.

My friends and I took a half-full jug of beer that had been left at the table next to ours. I was scowled at by the waitresses and we were accused of stealing beer – this jug of beer had been left unfinished and was going to be disposed of. It seemed like a harmless act to take the jug of beer.

As a result, I was man-handled and yelled at by a number of bouncers and the manager, who were all extremely aggressive and violent. I was physically picked up and thrown outside.

I was completely disgraced by the unnecessary offensive behaviour from all of the staff. I exchanged some heated remarks, of which the manager felt justified to then punch me directly in the face. My nose was bleeding and I thought my nose was broken. My friends and I called the police and I spent the rest of the evening and morning at the hospital, where I had x-rays for my nose.

Luckily my nose is not broken, but very swollen and painful. I will now be disfigured for a week and have an acute headache from the pain. This is not acceptable behaviour by any man, especially to a woman and by any 'so-called' manager. I am new to Singapore and I thought I was in a respectable bar in a lovely setting like The Chijmes.

To ALL women, please reconsider going here. I am still in shock and feel completely violated."
,,Relaxing place. Good food.,4.0,,"Is quiet and relaxing inside the city. Good restaurants, but not cheap options"
,,Innovative use of space,3.0,,Recycling what was once the grounds of the CHIJ convent and it's chapel into a retail and recreational space while still honouring its past delicately...
,,Nice atmosphere,5.0,,Plenty of food and bars in a nice atmosphere. Place has a european style because of the church and the old monestery it is situated in.
,,Church or event hall?,3.0,,"The Chijmes complex has several restaurants but what interested me was the church. It has been converted to an event hall, and when I visited it was being fitted out for a big dinner or similar. The building is very cool – bright white and a classic church. I enjoyed walking through the church and photographing the lovely interior and nice artistic windows. Worth a look – not too far from Orchard Road if you want a break from shopping."
,,For a quick stop,3.0,,"Nothing to shout about, touristy. Go to have a look at the grounds, the church and have a pint. Then go somewhere else for the rest of the night if you don't want to blow your budget!"
,,"Venue for bars and restaurants, but not noteworthy as a tourist attraction",2.0,,"My guidebook described CHIJMES as a converted convent, which is true; but it shouldn't have been described as a tourist attraction worth seeing it in its own right. The former convent is rather plain, as most convents were, so if (like me) you go there expecting murals, stained glass, or ornate architecture, you'll be disappointed. The only reason to come here would be to visit the restaurants, bars, and boutique stores now contained within it. I visited here around midday on a weekday, and of course the bars were closed, but surprisingly so were many of the restaurants and stores. Half the TripAdvisor reviews of CHIJMES are actually reviews of Insomnia, a bar/club within CHIJMES, so perhaps that's the main draw here, and the place probably comes alive late at night. But if you're looking for historical or cultural sites, this is a place you can skip without a second thought."
,,"Chijmes restaurants, bars and boutiques",4.0,,Loved the Aussie bar especially when the rugby was on. Nice boutique and Japanese restaurant.
,,Olathe - fantastic shop at Chijmes,5.0,,"I love beautiful ""stuff"" and you will find plenty at Olathe. Asian style items for your home, clothing, gifts, etc. I go there every time I visit Singapore. Located at Chijmes."
,,cUSCADEN - NICE :),4.0,,"If you wanna get away from really loud live bands and chill at a quieter corner, Cuscaden is a good place to be. Good finger food and nice live music available here. I'd definitely go again. Soon. :P"
,,Loved the courtyard ambiance but the food could use some work @ Insomnia,3.0,,"Dined at one of the restaurants the borders the courtyard in Chimes called insomnia. We loved the atmosphere and the wait staff were pleasant & attentive enough. The food wasn't that great. I ordered the set meal (a fish, salad & dessert). All seemd pretty mediocre. My fiiance ordered a salad and between 2 drinks our bill totaled 100 SGD. It was much more than we would typically spend of so-so food. I wouldn't give this place a good recommendation unless you were just going for the drinks. Definitely stop by the Chimes. Very lovely and had live music & many other restaruants to pick from!"
,,acoustics music at cuscaden@chijmes,5.0,,open air concept bar... had very very good live acoustic music... two local guitarist /singers on saturtays ( but understand that there is a roster )... very decent bar prices too... closed on sundays...
,,Insomnia @ Chijmes - Appalling service - Avoid at all costs,1.0,,"Myself and some friends were at Insomnia and ordered cocktails, the round coming to over $100. One of the girls drank a little of hers, then moved the lime slice on the rim of the glass and noticed that the lime was covering a large broken bit of glass, and that the broken glass bits had fallen into the drink.

When we told the waiter we wanted a replacement drink, he looked unconcerned that our friend could have swallowed broken glass. He just came back with an unbroken glass and poured her drink into it.
We said that was unaccepable, so he took her drink away and would not offer a replacement.
When we complained to the manager, he finally offered half a replacement cocktail, as she had taken a sip from the previous glass.
Upon receipt of the half replacement ( a lot less that they had poured away), my friend remarked that it was practically water, almost no alcohol in it at all.
We complained again and the manager told us that was the best he was going to do, and if we didn't like it, we should leave.

We left, and I am therefore advising everyone else to not go."
,,Cuscaden @ Chijmes,5.0,,Brilliant pub-like bar in Chijmes. It can be found by following the live music - they have different duets performing 6 nights a week and are very good at fulfilling requests ! Azmi and all the staff are very friendly and obliging. The prices are very reasonable (especially when compared to The Raffles Long Bar which is very close by) - the best value is their early evening happy hour prices but buying San Miguel by the jug is good value ! They also serve food ('til quite late which is useful if you are looking for some grub rather than paying hotel prices) - thoroughly recommend the chicken wings (which was $SD 12 for 6 wings and 6 drumsticks) - they are scrumble ! Go along and try it out.... Don't think you'll be disappointed !
,,Best Performance!!,5.0,,"Chijmes..... what makes Chijmes my favourite place?? First Chijmes has the most beautiful ambiance and everybody would love it!!
Well what i want to say about the best Performance is that You go to ""Insomnia"" to lsiten to the Live band which has been there for 6 month you just wouldn't leave anymore!! They are great and everybody loves it!!! I'm living in Kuala Lumpur and I have to go to Singapore for my Studies!! I was there for 3 weeks and on the weekend there wasn't one place as nice as Insomnia@Chijmes. If you like to just Chill there are also some nice Pubs where you can relaxe with an Fontain in your back... Chijmes is somekind of two storage church area. In the middle they've got a Church, i don't know if it's still in use but it's really nice. If you go down into the basement you would love it there. They've got tables and chairs standing there from other Pubs and the Fontain which is underneath the church is lighted!!!
Like to chill or listening to Live Bands?? THIS is the Place. Open every day!!!
I'll just say Have fun and enjoy the Rhythm!!
bye Rabea"
