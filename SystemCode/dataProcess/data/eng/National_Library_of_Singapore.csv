,,borrowed some cookery books,5.0,,they have a good range of cookery books on loan and the librarian i met was indeed very helpful and tried all ways to find for me a particular cookbook which i had wanted to borrow.
,,Not worth it,2.0,,Don’t bother not much to see. A couple of exhibitions that’s about it. Normal library. Was expecting a lot more. Very little to say a bit disappointed.

,,Nice place to stop,4.0,,"Beautiful building downtown. Good place to cool off and relax. We were unable to get on their wifi without a Singapore phone number, dissapointing. Nice cafe outside too."
,,"SPEND TIME HERE, KNOWLEDGE IS POWER",5.0,,"If one loves books, then this is a must-visit place in Singapore. We could not realise that there can be such a large, varied and rich collection of books in the city/state of Singapore. We spent around 4 hours here but that was not at all enough. Wish we had some more time at hand"
,,Pleasant visit!,5.0,,NLB is extremely resourceful with their wide variety of resources. This multi story library provides sufficient space for everyone to study or work at. The seamless design of the building is also highly aesthetic.

,,Study lounge,1.0,,"My friend and I came to the national library to study in the study lounge. However, when we got there most seats were taken with peoples bags and books but no actual person there. We waited around for half an hour thinking that some people would come to claim there belongings but to our disappointment no one came."
,,Great place for leisure read,4.0,,"With Singapore hot weather, it is a cooling and cosy place to browse through the large collection of books and definitely you can find a book or two which is to your liking."
,,Still one of our favourite places to go to,5.0,,"The National Library of Singapore is good for so many reasons:
1. One of the largest libraries in Asia, 7 (or more) floors of books which are hard to find elsewhere.
2. Central location is great for meeting up with friends.
3. It has a mini-theatre space called the Black Box, a great space to support local arts and performances.
4. It also has unique exhibitions sometimes, most are free.
5. Study room is perfect for students, it has vending machines available for those study hunger pangs and...
6. Right outside the study room there is an outdoor rooftop garden! Great for catching some fresh air in between study blocks.

and now that we have kids...

7. The children's library at the basement is definitely one of the prettiest and most awesome, with a treehouse made up upcycled materials set up for the little readers, and a plethora of books to choose from, and in so many languages too, and literally books for all ages (from age zero!). Plenty of space and the clean carpets meant the little ones can enjoy reading at any corner of this children's library."
,,"VERY GREEN, VERY CLEAN, VERY NICE.",4.0,,"Singaporean are Sincerely Friendly, Hospitable, and helpful. Real Local Singaporean Foods are found in Numerous Hawker Centers. Foods are mainly Chinese, Malaysian , and Baralakan in Origins.....Fusion with Indonesian, and nearby countries. Excellent ...Inexpensive ....Fantastic Varieties....EAT till you drop....."
,,Perfect library!,5.0,,"You can't use camera inside and you don't need. Just free your mind to explore and enjoy the place to the fullest. So many books for lots of fields, stunning view to sit and read book next to, an exhibition for Sing student to showcase their invention. Clean and modern and bright and spacious and friendly venue!"
,,Biggest library in singapore,4.0,,The biggest library in Singapore. Has a lot of books and tables for people to read and study. Many students like to come here.
,,Interesting place to visit,4.0,,"Right in the heart of the CBD this attractive building has a number of interesting of exhibitions on Singapore, its history and culture. Makes an unusual visit. And it is free and the staff are very friendly."
,,Kids Fest,3.0,,"I came here to see a show, I found it to be very expensive for 1 hour. I would reconsider and take the kids somewhere else."
,,One the best public library in the world,5.0,,The library is open to the public and you are able to just read any books on the shelves. You can sit comfortably in the well lighted and air-conditioned area.
,,Conducive,5.0,,NLB is a place to go to for students who are looking for a conducive environment to prepare for their exams. Just remember to come slightly earlier to get a seat.
,,Good place to read but...,4.0,,"I come here often to read and while I really like this library for its vast collection, central location and cleanliness, some aspects can be improved - there are many seats around but despite signs informing patrons not to use the library as a napping place, many patrons especially senior folks seem to use the library as a nap spot with free A/C, depriving those who come to the library and really want to read/research of space and seats. The last time I came, a whole row of armchairs had been removed, meaning even lesser seats...
I hope something can be done so that those who really use the library to read can find seats/spaces :)
1 highlight about this library is the Book exchange at the basement. Well done and thank you for this! Would be great if other libraries had this feature too."
,,Library,4.0,,"Very convenient and accessible by different public transport. The library is bright, friendly, aspirational spaces as overall ambient is good ."
,,Modern,5.0,,One of the best place to go to; so many updates you can learn about the area. Digital format has been utilized.
,,One of the best libraries and more,5.0,,"Wide selection of books and resources - good for research and leisure.
Bright, spacious, well-maintained facilities. Free wifi.
You can come here to study, only thing is that you cannot leave your things unattended for too long or the people patrolling will come and remove it.
Not just a library - it has a theatre box that hosts performances, a cafe, and exhibitions on rotation that are 100% worth visiting."
,,Very conducive place to study,4.0,,"The library has many seats and many levels that have seats. However during the peak exam periods there will be a huge crowd, so there will be a need to go earlier in order to garuntee a spot. But other than that, it is a very conducive place to get work done."
,,Astounding place.,5.0,,"So spacious, clean and organised....like most places in Singapore. I was gobsmacked by the display on there at the moment of Indian Gods......stunning."
,,Peace,5.0,,A great place to visit when you want to have peace and time away from the busy street. They have endless amounts of books when you can spend eternity there!
,,Wonderful and Free.,5.0,,There's always a great exhibition on and the killer views from up top are great. Also easy to get to
,,Convenient,5.0,,"Near city, many storeys of various books sections, study area, WIFI enabled, near MRT, shopping malls and many eating place available"
,,World class exhibitions on the 10th Floor,5.0,,"I recently learnt that the National Library mounts excellent world class exhibitions at the 10th Floor gallery. The current exhibition on early local advertising ( spanning late 19th C to early 20th C ) is superbly designed, engaging and content rich. I was captivated by the range of visuals and felt much nostalgia for the bygone days. The ads were beautifully designed and there were some with really quirky text . Allow 2-3 hours and bring a sweater , its cold inside !"
,,Whoa.,4.0,,"I've never seen a city-state so dedicated to promoting reading and literacy. Librarians are helpful and the venues are adaptable to the needs and time restraints of people. They have branches in malls, which make them accessible to people all the more."
,,Good library,2.0,,This is a very good library with a wide variety of books but I fail to see how it qualifies as tourist attraction.
,,Award-winning building,4.0,,"For architecture enthusiasts, the national library is a must visit in Singapore. Located near Bugis Junction (LRT station: Bugis), the building is open to visitors. Sometimes, exhibitions are held in the building such as one during our visit on early advertising in Singapore. Higher floors of the building provide good view of the city skyline on a clear day."
,,Many have changed,4.0,,It has been a long while since I last stepped into a library. So I decided to bring my little one to visit. I am surprise to see the huge collection of books and we could easily spend the whole afternoon there looking through the books.
,,Nice one !,4.0,,"Very nice to see such a huge collection of books, periodicals etc. A nice place for an avid reader to go for !"
,,technology at its best,5.0,,"the building itself is so beautiful. do go up to the various sky deck to view their roof top gardens. the only down part was there are no free internet (for tourist). everything needs a nets card (ie, cashless) so it was hard for tourist to log in to internet."
,,best library lolz,5.0,,I usually visit this library frequently on weekends but I did find a set of Encyclopaedia Britannica books in the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library lvl 8. In the central one that is in basement one there are newspapers and there are also FOREIGN ONES IN PRINT.
,,Amazing and Comfortable Place to Study,5.0,,"I came here due to I have to look for any reference books for my Undergraduate Thesis. I was happy due to I found the book that I am looking for. The location is very strategic and its closer from Bugis Area. I took the hotel nearby and I came here for three days and happy. Many students, researchers, or even visitors from overseas came here. The staffs are very helpful and all guidance is available everywhere. Also the internet is 4G service and quite fast. This place is fully recommended to visit."
,,National Library Singapore,4.0,,Great collection of books and nice place to do some quiet research and work.. Singaporean can loan the books free..
,,Huge Library!!,5.0,,"The national library here is the largest in Singapore and housed in a tall building.

You can find all kinds of reference materials,magazines,newspapers and there are a lot of tables and seats for people who enjoy spending hours just to read.

A great clean and conducive place to serve this purpose and it is located just across the road from Hotel Intercontinental."
,,For book lovers,5.0,,"I always drop by to visit NLB when I'm around. It's always nice going in into the community library at the basement, or browse around the available exhibitions at the same building. The children will love the children sections, with many books selections available. During weekends, there're storytelling in both English and Mandarin at certain timings. The library also held workshops that are mostly free, but need advanced registration. Check out their website for more details."
,,Books for checkout are on the bottom floor,3.0,,"Not a ton of selection if you're used to a more extensive library system. Many books we wanted were not in the library or would be only available in several months as the wait lists are long and perhaps the amount of copies is few. Plenty of seating if you want to hangout and read somewhere that isn't your home. Large space, but I don't find the layout very pleasing. The children's section looks nice. We were going to get a library card, but decided against it. The card costs ~40-50sqd a year and you have to pay for the card with an ATM card that has a pin number."
,,For those who like Libraries,5.0,,We came across the Library as we were exploring the city. The library has an extensive collection in multiple languages. There were also on display lego minature replicas of some of the famous Singapore building.
,,Great and Quiet Place to Study,5.0,,"Great place to study, can get crowded at times but all in all it's good! There's a wide range of books"
,,the peaceful serenity place for reading,5.0,,"this is absolutely the excellent place highly recommended for the people who looking for the nice place to read a book without suffering from any other noisy chatting unpleasant disturbance sound.

according to my observation, most of the people who come to this place always respect the rules or regulation and avoid disturbing each other, speak very carefully, softly to each other.

from my experience, this kind of gentle civilized manner is quite difficult to find in some other societies (or countries).

Honestly, this is very big surprised, amazing and impressive for the outsider person imagination,"
,,good place,4.0,,"Though it need a little bit of touching up here and there, it stil is an impressive building. Not something I owuld especially go to mind you. I had ot be there for work."
,,Good place to sit down and read,4.0,,The national library is nearby Bugis Junction and Suntec City. This place is quite popular with students heading over there to study over the weekend. There are also many areas in the library which have table and chairs for siting down to study. The staff at the library are also very helpful and polite.
,,"Lovely place, like a fairytale",5.0,,"My daughter 18+ months loved this beautiful area at the children’s section. It is like being in a fairytale. Beautiful, calm, and lots of books for the kids to enjoy."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Not the same sort of beauty as the grand dame libraries in the US (this isn't the Boston library for example) but modern and striking. I love the enclosed green space (fifth floor?) with a view of the city. Green lush greenhouse sort of place in amidst the peacefulness of the building. Great.
,,Inspirational,5.0,,This is the most amazing library I've ever been too. It's huge and dynamic and user friendly. Great architecture too.
,,THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LIBRARY IN THE WORLD,5.0,,I drove by this amazing building on my way to the hotel from the airport and I realized I just had to go see it. From the ground level the building looks incredibly futuristic and makes an excellent spot for architectural photography. It's open to anyone and there are books on just about anything so that's great but the most amazing part was when I headed upstairs to the higher floors to see the view from the city in this amazing library. Of course be careful not to disturb all the students working in quiet but the law library has rows upon rows of fun knowledge and if you're lucky and ask a nice guard about a spot for a nice view then you will have one of the best views of the city.
,,Not exactly the British Library but very well worth a visit,5.0,,"National Library doesn't necessarily mean exactly what it is, but they do have a very good collection, which is expanding all the time."
,,Amazing collection of books,5.0,,"The NL of Singapore has an excellent collection of books for all ages. We are regular members of the library and the kids really enjoy spending time and exploring the books. You can easily spend an entire day here reading, as it is quite comfortable, peaceful and quiet."
,,Best book lovers massive,4.0,,"Massive this library is massive and have several levels,the main place read is level just before level one and has great books on all subjects ..travel,cooking,language etc etc..could spend all day here"
,,Spectacular and impressing,4.0,,"This complex is one of the most spectacular library buildings I ever seen. A place for learning, but also for socializing."
,,NO FREE WIFI FOR TOURIST,1.0,,"I tried to connect there, but it didn't work, so asked the reception if I can get connect with WiFi,. No, it was not possible if you are a tourist -without SG phone number-, cause you need to receive a confirmation code on your phone. I didn't receive any message, and the guy behind the reception wasn't able for to help me farther, he said you can better go and be connect in a cafe.

I was there with a reason, that I could work! And a library must be an open place for everybody!"
,,Endurable place..,4.0,,My 6yo daughter loves to spend time here. Especially their tree house although its a little bit small and only provide max 25 kids. The books collection are very various and in good condition. Well designed interior for children. Nice place to spend whether its rain or sunny outside.
,,Easy to spend a whole day.,4.0,,"A great place for those who love to read. You can easily spend a whole day, even multiple days if you like. It's so huge, that you can easily get lost. Very comfortable seats in pretty corners. If you want to take a break from reading, go to the terrace for a splendid view of all that represents Singapore.."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"never bored with this special place. maybe strange but yes, because of this library I want to come here everyday. a lot of this can be done. not an ordinary library. Love this place"
,,Relaxing quiet reading corner in the city.,4.0,,"With more than 7 floors of creative, culture and art all in one building. Theater hall at the top floor, art exhibition hall at middle and ground floor and few floor with lots of books for book lovers. You should not miss this place if you stay around the area, relax yourself with some reading and art experience."
,,Peacful Libarary to spend the Afternoon in,5.0,,"This library is huge, with many floors of books. The best part is that the children section often hold many different workshops. The children section has comfortable chairs and an organised library system that makes it easier to search for desired books."
,,Huge - paradise for book lovers,5.0,,"Its a multistorey library which is huge as well as amazing. Its a readers paradise, lot of places and silent corners to read, people even walk up with their laptops and ipads to sit n work in silence. Food outlets as well to eat nearby. Its a wonderful collection of books."
,,What a library should be,5.0,,"If you like libraries, you'll like this. Great selection of books. Clean, airy building. Recommendation for improvement: needs more seating."
,,Amazing Building,5.0,,"So elegantly constructed, easy to move around with so clear directional signs. Millions of book to read and so much to learn. Really a nice place to study."
,,Back again to N L S,5.0,,Back again to N L S This Excellent site opposite to my hotel Always attracted me Huge and great science land mark
,,"Central location, easily accessible",4.0,,"The National library is easily accessible, has lots of room and place to rest even if you aren’t there to read. Huge book selection, quiet enough as most people are considerate."
,,Wonderland for kids,5.0,,I would not have gone there but this place is great for kids . With endless section of books and separate children section having a tree house like small l forest etc & much more
,,Nice escape from the rain,4.0,,I ducked in here during a rain storm. I was nice to get reacquainted with the library. An endless selection of magazines and a children's section with a tree house for kids to sit in while reading. Ran out of time or would have returned with my 8 y/o. There's also a cafe with coffee and snacks.
,,Good research section,4.0,,"Very centrally located and with a fair number of eateries to lunch before your visit. Restroom is spacious and clean and the lending section has local literature and plenty of fiction for browsing and borrowing. Too many people are sleeping in the seals alongside the fiction section though so it’s hard to find a seat when you lug your choices from the shelves to browse before borrowing.
The best place though is the research section on a higher floor where you can refer to the many books on specialised topics not found in the other branches. From critical works on drama and theatre to heavy volumes on design and architecture this is as good as a university library."
,,Visit to Central Public Library,5.0,,"Always finds this library stocked with good and sufficient books. A relax place to browse, select, do a 1st reading before borrowing the books. Very peaceful, clean and comfortable place.
During this period, one can borrow up to 16 books. It is amazing ♡♡♡☆☆☆
Love this place!"
,,Your kind of Library,5.0,,"You will find basically everything in this library. Huge space. There are business, information technology, children, psychology books and the whole nine yards. It is also comfortable to do your research and studies in this library. Even when you get hungry, there is a coffeeshop inside it. Lockers are provided too."
,,very cool building and collection,5.0,,"Apart from all the books, the building is architecturally interesting, with a cool glass elevator. Definitely go up to a floor where they're having a special exhibit - in November 2017 it was on historical Malay texts and was fascinating, very well done. No charge, near the museums, totally worth a stop. Of course I am a librarian so I might be biased!"
,,Theatre,3.0,,"Opened about 10 years ago, this library has a theatre space as well which i've gone to several times. Came here today for another play"
,,Take a moment for a break,5.0,,"Do not hesitate to stop by the café, They prepare exclusive food. Another plus on the top of the architecture of the building, it’s facilities and its exhibitions."
,,Good design,4.0,,"We had passed the building often but this time we had a couple of exhibitions we wanted to view. One was a small display of a local musician and friend of ours and the other was an exhibit of Malay manuscripts and early books.

The building is easy to get to and find. There are at least four MRT stations within a short walk and numerous bus stops nearby.

The staff are very helpful and courteous and the amenities are excellent. Free lockers for your stuff is a nice feature. The toilets are clean, the elevators work well, and the layout for books, magazines, and newspapers are well spaced.
The exhibitions are well curated and the captions well thought out and written.

Well worth a visit even if it's just to look around."
,,Peaceful,5.0,,"I love this library, so big and peaceful. but the best feature is it looks very organised and tidy :)"
,,Education,5.0,,"During my visit, I got back in time and figured my college life in Singapore... sadly I got to reality soon."
,,Nice place to read books,5.0,,I visit NLB regularly on Sun while waiting for kid enrichment class. It has different floors for different purposes.
,,Cold and bland ...,1.0,,None of the uniqueness/warmth from the original national library are present. It is the same as all the other library ... why come here then?
,,Surprising,5.0,,"I met an old friend of mine in Bugis by arrangement. Actually, the Chinese lady hat I met was my girlfriend sixty years ago. Don't laugh. Although I live in UK we have remained in touch over the years. Anyway, after our latest meeting we had coffee together and as we were within walking distance of the library we opted to go there. We explored every floor as neither of us had been before. Most floors had well organised lending sections and reference sections. I dont know whether the book sections are unique in that they have to cater for three different languages, but they appear to do it well.
However, the highlight of our visit was the upper floors of the library which was, in fact, a museum highlighting the development of Singapore island from the very early years. Information was well presented and informative."
,,Books and Learning,5.0,,"The place is very cozy from the entrance. Located near an MRT station and shopping arcade, the National Library is a haven for readers or people who need some personal time with books. The library has a massive collection of books, people can read wherever they want, be it on the floor or on the table. One can just hang out there without reading books and enjoy the time with their friends."
,,The Queen of the Sciences (for tourists),4.0,,"As a tourist you cannot borrow books. Fair enough. You can hang out though, just catch some A.C. before heading back out. I recommend taking the elevator up to... I think the 13th floor... for an impressive view. Go into the feferenxe section of that floor and all the way to the window on the left... then right again. Bertie Russell said ""a map is an algorithm of logic"" or something like that. Hope this is logical enoigh for you.

LOCAL TIP: take the far elevator facing south. That's the last one on the left as you approach. You will get a superb view and feel like Charlie Bucket in his mate's Great Glass Elevator."
,,MY FAVORITE PLACE ON EARTH,5.0,,"Visited this place twice: September 2016 and May 2017.

I'm not exaggerating, this library is my favorite place not only in Singapore, but on earth. I always feel at ease in this place. You could find any updated collection by your interest in all of Singaporean's languages. My personal favorite is the English art book section. Although, it's pretty crowded for a library during college's final exam period.

Outside the book sections, the corridors and hallways are very spacious, you could find students doing various assignments along the way.

When I first came here in September 2016, I stumbled across a historical exhibition in the 10th floor and I gotta say, the best literary exhibition I've ever been to.

Another thing I love about this establishment are the free lockers. I was backpacking and stayed at some acquaintances who were working by the day so I had no places to put my belongings. Thankfully I found this place and I put them all in these lockers. Although, mind you the lockers are only available as long as the library's open, and they would sweep out everything in the lockers in the night. Nevertheless, it's pretty handy for urban traveller. And also, the locker is fairly small. I had to separate my belongings into small bags to 3 different lockers."
,,"Something different from just sightseeing, eating and shopping",4.0,,"If you are looking for something different from just sightseeing, eating, and shipping in singapore."
,,This is amazing!,5.0,,This is a really amazing Library that I've ever visit in my life. There have cafe shop at Level 3. I've spent time reading my book there and enjoy my coffee when my day off!
,,Excellent Library - Good place to rest and read for tourists,5.0,,Review by Dr Sim. Excellent library with good air-conditioner. Good place for tourists to rest and catch up on some local reading. Regards Dr Sim
,,nice,5.0,,"tosn of book eateries below access to rented computers, new facilities withparkign available and itis a huge place in town"
,,Best place to calm your soul,5.0,,Whenever im in town i wouldnt miss the chance to stop by at the National Library. The air conditioning system is superb especially when you spent the day walking around town. Enjoyed the child section the most (yes i know im an adult) but i couldnt help it to spent some time around that area.
,,Singapore National Library,5.0,,One of the best city libraries! Different levels and sections for different interests. Electronic checking in/out for books. Separate large area for children
,,High tech & modern library,4.0,,Swrving citizens and visitors---we took our family here reading and getting more info about Singapore and SE Asia. We enjoyed it and the srtaff was very helpful to our family.
,,Amazing collection and architecture: must stop by children's section and 10th floor,5.0,,"This place makes reading even more fun, I swear. The children’s section is a wonderland- it’s like an artificial forest with a Kinect station, a weather-learning section, and all the children’s books and educational CD’s you can play with on the computers. Go to the 10th floor for the reference section and nice view. The reference section is extremely complete, even with ASEAN resources, and it's an amazing workplace. There’s a running campaign that encourages peope to read called National Reading day and there are lots of book exchange corners."
,,Improved general lending section,4.0,,"It used to feel a lot more crowded, had shortage of chairs, messed up newspapers but they've solved all those challenges.
Feels much more spacious, I found seats at lunchtime and the papers are mounted to reading tables so they are in great shape but the reader has to move from paper to paper. Very civilized"
,,"Big library, nice food around",5.0,,"There is a lot of restaurants around it. Even foreigners can go in to browse the books as it is open. If you take lift to the higher level, you can see some beautiful scene of Singapore"
,,Membership is highly recommended,5.0,,"If you are s book worm or slightly interested in books this is a must visit especially is you are a resident of SG. I highly recommend becoming a member as they have a wide selection of books for all ages. They also offer various activities in the larger libraries for kids like story time, dress up areas, play areas etc.

You can book specific books online and their library app has been recently updated making it easier to renew lib bks.

They also have cafe adjacent to most library offering affordable meals and drinks.

The wifi is not great and the computer stations with internet are very very slow.

In the school holiday months they always have special events and offers going on. Like now you can borrow twice the number of books on 1 membership."
,,A Shining Beacon For Nerds,5.0,,"Singapore has a very extensive and top-quality library system for a small nation of only a few million people, and the National Library near Bugis is the crown jewel. The actual branch component of the library, secreted away in the basement, is nothing special but the upper floors compose one of the best Research Libraries on Southeast Asia in the world (and their collection of non-SE Asian material is also quite good).

It is a Research Library, so you can't check out any of the books. And it is Singapore, so there are lots of rules about where to sit, photocopying materials, bags and so on and so forth. But their collection of audio-visual material, magazines, periodicals and books is extensive. Not everything is on display, so if you are really doing a deep dive into some back-issue of Indonesia Moeda from 1931 or something, you'll have to check with the friendly and knowledgeable staff.

The design is all floor-to-ceiling windows which give pretty great views of the City (partially obstructed by some neighboring high-rises). On the 16th floor they often host special events in the POD, which require pre-registration. You take a separate elevator up, and it is basically a glass-walled pod giving you breath-taking 360 degree views of the city. If you have the time, I would recommend you check out an event at the POD, but the Library also hosts hundreds of other events for braniacs all the time so check their website or Facebook page. There is even a Drama Centre, but I have never personally been to see a show.

During school periods it is often filled with little nerd kids studiously working, which should tell you something about the culture and society of Singapore. In Los Angeles, libraries are usually filled with homeless people, but in Singapore it's where kids come to hang out and get nerdy."
,,Interesting Library,3.0,,"The library is very big and occupies a few floors in the building. However I did find the staff very helpful in trying to find information on family tree matters. As yet, Singapore does not have much regarding family tree; it is a topic not yet of interest to many locals although I did find two books that can be useful for anyone who would like to start their family tree as the book has good tips and places of contact where to get started. The library is neat and tidy and there are plenty of sitting areas for those who want to spend time reading or for students. For the visitor is great place to escape from the outside busy streets and hot temperature just to have some quiet time reading or searching the websites on computers in air-conditioned rooms."
,,Fantastic Collection of Books,5.0,,1.Lots of books for all the subjects. 2. Their KID section is specially very good. 3. Study books for different classes are also available.
,,Partial view of the city from floor 11,5.0,,"If you love (partial) views of the city from the top, the National Library has plenty of it. And it is free of charge and air conditioned. Take the lift to the 11th floor and walk into the reference area. The anal part of the reference library is that you have to place your bag in the locker (free of charge) on the same floor. If you wish to bring your bag into the library, the security guard will check for food and drinks (illogical, right?). Walk to the right and you will enjoy the city view from the ceiling to floor glass windows. If you are not impressed, walk to the left and walk the open stairway to the 10th floor. Or, take the lift to the 5th floor and enjoy the outdoor garden. I love the serenity here. Or, you could visit the public library in the basement and conduct some pseudo sociology study on why there are so many elderly men snoring and not reading at the library. And, no one seems flustered by the sight (or sound). You could be the first one."
,,Beautiful Architecture,5.0,,"I went here by accident. I was kinda lost at that time while trying to get back to my hotel. When I got in, I was surprised with the beautiful architecture! I guess this place is perfect for family and suitable for kids but the queue is quite long to some attractions. I also enjoyed the performance of some musicians there. I didn't spend much time here but it was a nice experience. Will recommend this place for sure."

The building has good views and is a famously ""green"" sustainable building. Definitely worth a short visit to get a feel for Singapore history."

Great for locals (for reading and recreational), for students (amazing collection of research journals, papers and books) and Tourists!

The selection is rather wide and many reference materials can be only found here.

Only the public library's books are available for borrowing, while the Lee Kong Chian's are for reference only. Also a open air garden on the 5th floor which offer some view of the city.

With a fantatstic online system, items can be searched, found where located, borrowed items extended and even ordered. Drop-off at any library.
The Libraries themeselves are well appointed, comforatble and with stations for study, reading or just browsing the newspapers and magazines.
Singaporeans should be proud of this facility which is sadly in decline where I come from - UK - especially for the elderly."
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"We spent a couple of hours here, the highlights were the children's treehouse library, the newspaper department with an international selection of newspapers, hard copy and on-line.

,,Excellent library with very vast collection,5.0,,"I went here to celebrate the end of nanowrimo but ended up going up and down the whole place to enjoy the collection, working on my story, plus visiting some of the exhibition that they have there. My friend also came here several months after for a research that we were doing, and found rare copies of antique books that was very useful to our project. The building itself is beautiful and nice to visit. Not really a tourist destination, but if you have time and need some peace and quite amongst thousands of books... this is the place!"
,,Books Everywhere!!,5.0,,The library is so enormous. Tons of books are available and the staff are courteous enough to lend a hand in looking for what you need. I guess the library is a complete vault of reading materials and references. I visited it almost weekly to borrow books and you can return the books thru it public libraries scattered within the island.
,,Surprised so consumer friendly and no just books,3.0,,"What's nice about this building is that
- lots of alfresco but covered outdoor space pedestrians are encouraged to linger
- nice Hans food outlet for typical ocal cuisine, noodles, kaya toast etc.
- Wifi! students arent moved on so often meet up and hang out here
- Don't miss the gardens on building top
- Did you know there are several performance spaces within the library? I was attending theatre in the BlackBox theatre on 5th floor."
,,Great Space,3.0,,"Interesting exterior architecture and spaces, including the large plaza where you can sit down and read or relax outside under cover or not. Sometimes there are exhibits in the plaza or indoors on the interior levels. The library definitely has lots of great books in a clean, organized setting on multiple floors. Taking the elevator to different floors is fun because every area just outside the elevators has a great view of surrounding buildings. The reason for my modest rating is because there are lots and lots of open/empty interior spaces but very few areas to sit down with a book or study or just set your things down a minute while you open a book and take notes. There are almost no seats, no tables, no benches, no study rooms. Quite a surprise in a way, but I think other reviews mentioned something similar.
The good thing is, the library is near Bugis MRT, shops, eateries, etc. Very good location. Easy to find."
,,A great place to spend some time.,5.0,,If you think singapore is too commercialise then probably you should come here to spend half day or so. it 's free entry. free wifi provided - you have to do a simple registration with the counter in the lobby. many good books and sometimes there is exhibition or some stage presentation. a cafe with simple food is downstairs.
,,natinal library,4.0,,This is the most modern and sofiscated library in Singapore . It has a large collection of books .you can place the names of the books you would like to borrow and renew it on line .I love to come here .
,,A treasure trove of information,4.0,,"Besides being well stocked with books, there are sometimes exhibitions in the grounds which cater to different types of interests. The view from the Pod on the top floor is nice but you get to access it only if you hold tickets to events held there."
,,A dream for readers,4.0,,"A dream for readers, for an annual membership card pay you directly S $ 45 which is high price if they do not read much.
but just step into this library and make reading.
quantum Fisca and psychology, however, there is not much choice in this library but you can still visit the other Bib's."
,,calm and peacefull place,5.0,,I attended a seminar here and also been to the library. Very nice and clean environment. Love the ambience and the setting.
,,Great place to spend some quiet time.,5.0,,"We take our young children to the regional libraries quite often but a recent trip to the National Library makes the suburban ones pale in comparison.
Not only is the National Library a beautiful building architecturally... inside it is quite grand and there's lots of nooks and crannies to take a book and sit (or just sit without using a book). Of course, there're are computer terminals and many spaces to sit with your own notebook/laptop, but he National Library still ""feels like a library"", not a computer lab!"
,,Book paradise!,5.0,,"You can find everything in here, even you're not in membership read as much as you want. Absolutely I love it!!!"
,,Book lovers' paradise,4.0,,Signing up for a membership with the National Library is super easy and the variety of books available plus the extensive library network makes this a worthwhile investment.
,,Heaven for bookworms!,5.0,,"We just saw this building when we attended the mass at St. Joseph's Cathedral, which is just across the library. I was amazed on how big their national library is. So we agreed to check it out. I think it has 13 floors? We only visited the public library section which is in the basement.
No need to register or anything. You can read any book in this section. But you have to read it inside the library. I love this section because they have different collection of books, from business, technical, fiction, etc. They have computers if you want to hear or watch media files.
Love, love this library!"
,,So great,4.0,,"I love reading book so when I decided to go to Singapore, I immediately wanted to go here. The library has many different sections, and I definitely loved the kid's section. There was a tree house and the staff will tell story in there! How interesting!"
,,I was surprised how beautiful the National Library of Singapore is!,4.0,,"We didn't plan the visit to the National Library of Singapore in our itinerary. This was a last-minute request of my bookworm friend.

The National Library came out as an unexpected surprise for me! The library was huge and modern. It had several storeys and the public reading room had a nice reading area. There was also a reading section specially designed for kids! There were really lots of books and other publications. There were mangas, even!"
,,day and night trips,5.0,,"the best library in the world. Highly modern building and facilities. All the best collection of books for students, kids, young and old, can be found in this library."
,,Well Kept Treasure,4.0,,"It would be better if they carry newer titles at the main building at Bras Basah

Offers plenty of seats for serious people who wants to read / study / research

I love that Librarians will go around monitoring to ensure that no one 'chope' (book) a seat without being physically there. Note that a lot of youngsters do that and it's annoying because it's taking up space for serious people who need a space for studying / researching

Besides that I think the Librarians also did a good job to ensure no one sleeps in there! The library is not a place to sleep!! It's a place to read and study. I see a lot of elderly people and sons youths doing that!

Ways to improve is, they should have more plug point for people who bring their own laptop / tablet to charge. It's certainly not enough!"
,,Good place to learn the history of Singapore,4.0,,We visited here as we had read it was worthwhile place to visit in Trip Advisor.It was easy walking distance from our hotel so made sense to visit here. The exhibition about early Singapore is on the 10th floor. There was some good information on the Raffles family and other early settlers. Singapore was celebrating it's 51st year so there was quite a lot about the early days of Singapore. The cafe on the 3rd floor opens at 11.00 and we were ready for a cup of coffee by then. It was nice to be in out of the heat for a little while.
,,lovely place with huge collection,5.0,,"as with other places in Singapore, the library was impressive too. they allow you to check out as many magazines as you wish. It was amazing! After getting 2 magazines per visit that too for a week in US libraries, it was a sheer delight to have a horde of magazines to read on a rainy day here in Singapore. And there are many rainy days !;)"
,,Place where I get recharged,5.0,,"How many times I go there.. but it's always feels fresh. so much of wealth of books and great place to read that book and get your thoughts cleared. Very nice for family as well, introduce your kids to books and let them pick up the reading habit."

,,Visit From The Stacks exhibition at Level 10,4.0,,"An awesome exhibition showing never seen before documents and photos from Singapore's early days. We saw letters written by Sir Stamford Raffles to his Dad, Nursery Rhymes translated to malay to teach the kids, and a Malay-hokkien dictionary to teach the Hokkien basic Malay terms! Till 28 Aug 2016."
,,Meant to be an icon,3.0,,"The building has elaborated design with huge budget on architectural treatment to the whole façade. It was meant to impress from outside, obviously. In terms of facility, it is one of the better libraries in Spore such as more supporting staff and materials for borrowing. The culture of users is the problem and has never changed. Many users were allowed to talk loudly both to someone or on the mobile, sleep in the armchair, cross bared feet on seats, hog on papers that has time limit, hog seat in area meant for reading library material but doing own work. The experience using the library just does not fulfil basic expectation from a main library."
,,State-of-the-art library,5.0,,"I love the National Library. I'm sorry the old one was knocked down but this is state-of-the-art. I look forward to plays or talks at the national library but most of all just to working in there.

,,Award winning building,4.0,,A well designed building that minimizes utilities usage by making use of various features to get air and light within the building. Cool architecture to study and spend time in.
,,Amazing,4.0,,Using this library past 8 years. Its architecture impressed me. Lending library is located in the basements. As usual 24 hrs drop box is placed there. Reference materials are on higher stories. Small events are happen there. One of the best library i ever visited.
,,Feat of Collections and Public Engagement,5.0,,"I originally went to the National Library in order to go on a volunteer guided tour of their special collections exhibit ""From the Stacks"". What I found was a well curated exhibit much bigger than expected. The volunteer was incredibly enthusiastic, had tons of knowledge about the materials and also knowledge as a citizen she opted to share.

I ate at the cafe outside the first floor entrance while listening to a free concert hosted by the library. The study room was wonderful as well. I found it really entrancing to walk around the building and seeing how much the library has to offer. If there are any other exhibits in the future I will be sure to attend and highly recommend!"
,,Relaxed and quick.,3.0,,If you need a coffee and a light lunch the cafe at the library will do. Nothing to flash and menu not huge but food is reasonless price and quality wise. A great place to people watch.
,,One of the Best Public Library !,5.0,,"NLB is located in the city centre near Bugis Junction and Marina shopping belts. Thus if you are sick of shopping and want to have a quiet moment, this is the best place to go. The basement is for general public with wide collection of books. For those who need more research materials and info can make your way to the higher floors which has the reference sections that comprises of huge collection of books and journals.
There is a cafe outside the library which provides meals and beverages. The library is next to Bras Brasah Complex which is the place where you can find many bookshops and walking distance to Charlton and Raffles Hotel. A very central location and you can take a MRT train to either Bras Brasah station or City Hall station.

It is true that I have never worked as a librarian, but I find the story that national libraries have to tell about their people is fascinating. Since it was founded by Sir Stamford Raffles, Singapore has gone ahead in leaps and bounds. It is entralling to look at the collection of the National Library of Singapore; it tells a story as no other institution can. I have been there several times."
,,quiet place,5.0,,"A very modern library in a vibrant city, nice view when you go to level seven of this building. Remember to keep quiet when in the library"

Letters were included from people from a variety of occupations and levels of society extolling the virtues of this man. It was tear-jerking and a fine tribute and worth some time to read and view."
,,Interesting and well-put together exhibition,4.0,,We entered the National Library perchance as we were in that area. There was an ongoing exhibition called 'From the Stacks' which showcased rare pictures and documents of early Singapore. It was an interesting experience as we came to know little nuggets of Singapore's history. The exhibition was very well laid out with interactive sections and videos to watch. We could even pick up a picture each of early Singapore. The bonus was the lovely view from the courtyard on the 10th floor.
,,Impressive Kids Zone ~ My Tree House,4.0,,"We specifically visited the kids area called ""My Tree House"" and my kids loved it. They offered a good variety of children's books. We had a little nice break from the tourist spots and spent a quiet morning reading on the lovely tree house! Highly recommended for families traveling with kids."
,,Too boring and fake facts,2.0,,The stuffs in there were too boring and most of the articles were untrue. Some of the facts on singapore are fabricated as well.
,,The perfect example of a modern library!,5.0,,"This building is amazing, many floors, historical collections, an incredible children's library area, some excellent services that include bringing one's own unwanted books to donate, good staff, clean, quiet and generally awesome.

,,Excellent place in Singapore - a real discovery!,5.0,,"The Library is so well planned and stocked up, we really enjoyed it! There is also an excellent reference library on 8th and other floors for the serious readers. The collection is VAST. If you go to 8th floor and write down your research subject (can be just anything you have picked up for reading) and you get a special table to go and read.

So we went to have a look. A magnificent building. We went to the 10 th floor to their gallery. They had an exhibition called From The Stacks--- highlights of the National Library. It goes until August. I found it most interesting. They had letters that Raffles had written to his cousin. I was able to sit in an easy chair and hear them read aloud. If you love books and history you will enjoy this. Don't think kids would find it very interesting. An enjoyable morning for us.
,,"Books, Reference, Knowledge!",5.0,,"The National Library is awesome if you need a place to gather some knowledge. Very well built and all the books are categorized conveniently. Spent almost a whole day not realizing the passing of the time. Very clean and conveniently located by the Bras Basah MRT Station.

Next to the Library is the Bras Basah Complex which is full of bookstores!"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,I'm a library trustee so I had an odd interest in seeing this building. It's pretty convenient to the Raffles Hotel and offers some interesting views of the area as you get higher.

,,One of the Best places to visit in Singapore Frequently,5.0,,"Singapore Library is a place where we frequent every week.
The first impression I got when I saw the Library building is the awe on the size.
This is a huge building around 14 stories. The Car park is available even in peak hours.
The Basement is where the public library is availble from where the several books can be borrowed. There is a special enclave for children ( tree house ) which is frequented by children.
The other floors are dedicated to particular topics and how well there are stocked."

,,A good overview of Singapore's history,4.0,,"Visiting this museum on our first day in Singapore helped us understand the influences that have shaped Singapore and how it has come to be the nation that it is today. We were hoping that it would be a bit more kid friendly for our 6 year old, but it was a bit beyond her. We were disappointed that the kids area was closed.
Overall, it is an excellent museum with very creative multimedia exhibits. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Great place to chill and read,5.0,,"I liked the basement where you can read in the outdoor garden section. When I need to do some work on laptop, I will head to the reference sections at the upper floors with high ceilings, huge desks and power sockets."

,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"If you are a book lover or innovation, this is one place that is worth the visit. It is very well managed and maintained. The library is spread up and down in different floors. They have an IT system that would amaze you. The system makes borrowing to returning of books a breeze. I could spend the whole afternoon there."
,,Great place to instill early reading in kids,5.0,,The only library I know that is baby & toddler friendly. It has a vast & special forest theme reading area with tons of children books. We love the monthly free story telling session in different languages. Kids were even given free sculpted balloons at the end of it!
,,It has everything I need!,5.0,,"Unfortunately, I couldn't avail of the $52 yearly membership for non-citizens as I wasn't planning on staying that long; however, over 3 visits to the library, I've found books on every topic that I love, leading me to believe that it probably has all the books one could ask for! Enjoyed the few hours I was able to spend there browsing through varied sections."
,,Informative,5.0,,"It's not called National Library for nothing. Really one of the best libraries in Singapore.

Has many books that you can't find in regional/neighbourhood libraries, not including the reference books.

Also frequently has theatre/drama works being performed there.

Only gripe is that a lot of locals tend to crowd this place during exam periods. Lunch hours are also quite bad because a lot of locals go to the basement (general library section) to either read or sleep."
,,Fantastic Library,5.0,,"One of the best thing about living in Singapore is the opportunity to spend time in the National Libraries.

Love spending time here going through the various collections of books. The membership is just like $50 a year for expats and you can take like 8 books and return it within 21 days.

Been a member for 4 years and have really enjoyed reading books from business, management, fiction, religion, sports, spiriituality etc.. You can drop books in anyone of the libraries so that is a big benefit. Believe have grown more by becoming a member and rekindling my avid reader spirit

Embrace the excitement of ""intellectual curiosity if you continue to learn, you will find yourself always young."""
,,Library love affair,5.0,,"I love the Sg public libraries! Each one is different from the other and they all have great selections of books and other media. The main library on Victoria is very comfortable and it's always full of people: students, adults and seniors. You can stay there reading a novel or borrow a book to learn a new craft. The building also has a theater for drama/acting enthusiasts. Definitely a place to go to for booklovers."
,,Massive and Rich,5.0,,You are able to find any book in this place unless the book/journal you are looking for is not published. Silence is the priority and a lot of comers obey that.
,,Awesome Library and Collections,5.0,,"Centrally located just opposite the famous shopping place, Bugis Junction, you can totally in love with this library whether you love books or not.

For me personally, i fall in love with this library,the books, the collections, and how efficient the systems are, since the first time I came in 2008.

You are free to come and explore the library though you are a tourist. Just remember that you are not allowed to borrow the books and make noise inside the library :)

Btw, there is another cool library that you must visit beside this one. It's library@orchard central. Very bery cool library so far!"
,,Playful Kids Section!,5.0,,I always believe that reading is a good activity for kids. I purposely took a detour to the National Library to see the beautiful section that they have for kids. The whole roof was covered with recycled plastic bottles and there was a mini tree to climb on (using stairs :)). This library also hosts different reading activities with kids which will be useful in encouraging kids to read (esp the one with reading difficulties).
,,Landmark.,4.0,,"This is one of a handful of well-designed, aesthetically-pleasing buildings I like in Singapore. Comprising 14 floors, it houses the Central Public Library, the Drama Centre, a very useful Reference Library, and a pretty viewing point + discussion area

Visitors are advised not to access the top floor (the library's admin centre - closed to the public) and observe the basic etiquette.

That said, please feel free to browse the large collection of books and materials, most of which are available in English.

The Library has lockers (free of charge) for visitors using the Reference Library on the upper floors. F&B is served at a cafe on the third floor. The Drama Centre regularly hosts up-and-coming theatre performances at an affordable price.

The Library building is on the itinerary of the annual ArchiWalks, during the Architecture Festival period; also the host of many cultural events, such as the Singapore Writers Festival."
,,A must Visit to round up Singpore trip,5.0,,"National museum of Singapore probably gave me the best feeling of being in Singapore in terms of inheriting various exciting information about the country. The museum is easy to find, has an entrance fee. Inside, there are PLENTY to learn about Singapore. They give free Audio tape recorders to play sound clips when you enter a different room to describe most of the things that are in front. The guides were very nice too.
Overall, do yourself a favor and visit it, you'll like Singapore even more."
,,"Not just the library, the whole building is nice",5.0,,"There is a large branch of the Public Library in the basement, and always some exhibitions on level 1 and above. Parking available."
,,The iconic public National Library of Singapore,5.0,,"The National Library of Singapore is located at 100 Victoria Street. You can reach this place by taking a train and alighting at the Bugis MRT station. Walk about 50 m and you will reach the library.
This is a multi storey library which houses thousands of books including English, Chinese , Malay and Tamil editions. There is a research library on the 11th floor. The public toilets are well maintained round the clock. Visitors have to leave their bags in the lockers provided as this is a security measure.
In the 1820s Sir Stamford Raffles proposed the establishment of a public library and the old library was started in Stamford Road near the National Museum . It was later moved to an 11 304 sq m site at Victoria St. The new library is very spacious and on the first level there is a canteen where library users could take a meal or a drink. This is a place worth visiting for all tourists."

,,"Great collection, outstanding value",5.0,,"The National Library is an amazing resource to tap into in Singapore - it has a vast collection of books, very affordable rates for borrowing the books, a great space to sit and read and a convenient system where you can drop the books off at any National library location across the city."
,,"Nice library, but lacking some personality",4.0,,"I love to visit major libraries when I visit new cities for the first time. It tells you a lot about the people, the place, and the history. Often, the main library is an older building with an exciting architecture and many major reading rooms with personality. I didn't find that here at the National Library of Singapore. However, as I said, I was looking to learn a little about the place and people, and I think I did.

The building is fairly modern with a good collection of newspapers and books in English and Asian languages. There was a nice little lounge-respite reading area towards the back that had an outside area too. In the lobby, there was a very nice display of old Singapore books in cases and a sign pointing out the history of the library. My favorite part, however, was the comic strip like signs above the escalator on the way in. They were in English and actually quite funny. One compared old 80's Horror Movies to your experience today when receiving the overdue book bill. I can imagine it is expensive, as many things in Singapore are. If you are like me and enjoy visiting libraries, I think you'll enjoy a visit -- especially since there are other things to see and do in the area, like the huge Bugis Junction shopping mall nearby. Just don't expect an old library building with amazing architecture or lots of interesting nooks and crannies and old reading rooms. This is a much more modern experience, where some portion of the library's offerings are digital. I was surprised that I didn't see more interactive digital learning experiences for young people. Maybe it's there and I didn't find it."

This will be a great place, located at the central of Singapore and easy to access. It has the most collection of book in Singapore with cosy environment.

But if you are just passing by, head to the first underground floor and rest your legs while catching up with an edition of the Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, or New York Times. You might be missing those after all your Southeast Asia backpacking."
,,Never Pay Late Fees Again,5.0,,"In addition to have several floors of paper books that can be checked out and read at home, the National Public Library offers lots of great services that make reading books more convenient, like e-books and audio books.

,,A haven for those with time to spare for reading.,5.0,,A great place to visit if you want to look up reference books or read local and overseas newspapers and magazines.

,,One of my favourite places in the little Red Dot,5.0,,"I have been a member of the NLB for a few years now and it is one of my favourite places in Singapore. Its facilities and systems are among the best in the world. I also love the kids section, and brought my kids there regularly to choose and borrow their books and develop a love for reading.
One of my favourite things is the reservation system that allows you to easily reserve and borrow a book that is not present in the library next to you."

Its the main library building, and it has a comprehensive collection of over 600,000 books that will appeal to audiences from children to adults who have specialised interest.

Its spread out over many floors, so its rather spacious. At the top of the building, there's also an auditorium. If you can access the top floor, you will be greeted with a great view!

There is also a cafe on the ground floor if you need a coffee or snack."
,,very comprehensive 16-storey library a very helpful staff ; a quiet place to read,4.0,,"The library is a 16-storey, two-block development situated in the city's Civic District. The blocks are linked by skybridges on every floor. It houses two libraries, the Central Public Library in Basement 1 and the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library from Levels 7 to 13. It also houses the Drama Centre from Levels 2 to 5.

On the 16th floor, there is a closed viewing point called The Pod. It is only used for functions and events, and is not a viewing gallery. From the Pod, it has a panoramic view of the island of Singapore, outlying islands, and also neighbouring countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia.

There are also many gardens in the building but only 2 are opened to the public.

On the first floor are the main entrance and a café.

It is not really a tourist spot. But if you look for a book an any subject for your studies, your work on your pleasure, you may find it there because the library is extremely comprehensive and the staff very helpful and friendly.

It is a great place to read in a quiet space. You don't have access to wifi inside the building."
,,An interesting interlude,4.0,,"We enjoyed our visit to the library. The outside gardens on higher floors had good views across the local area and it was interesting to see a small exhibition.

As a public library it is free to enter and you can move about this quiet building without interruption. There are good lifts if you have mobility issues and it is possible to reach the higher floors and the outside gardens easily.

Obviously the primary function of the building is to serve the local populous and as a result the exhibition inside was quite small; but at least someone had taken the time to create one."
,,Great public resource,5.0,,"The Singapore Library is an awesome public resource. Being a traveller to Singapore, I love the fact that it is open to anyone and everyone who cares to walk in, without requiring membership or registration.

I've also found myself in Singapore on research and fact-finding missions before, and the Library has served as an excellent place for reference on several of those trips as well. It's great to see the country's commitment to the building of knowledge and open education so admirably executed. And the library is also great to appreciate on an architectural scale as well, with the reading spaced focused around the huge glass windows and natural lighting.

One of my favourite places in Singapore."
,,The best library I have ever visited,5.0,,"This library opens everyday until 9 p.m. What's better than that? After you feel your feet tired already, you can simply sit in this cool library and have fun reading some interesting books here. There are many choices of books here. I read some Japanese manga, some Marvel comics, and Personal Finance for dummies. I visited this place on one Sunday. Since I stay in hostel around Bugis, I just walked there. It's quite full with visitors. It took me some minutes to finally get a seat. It's enjoyable seeing many people, young and old, reading happily. The staffs are energetic and very active putting back books we have finished reading. The downside probably is the absence of free wifi for non citizens of Singapore. But this just made me more focused on my reading rather than getting distracted by internet. All in all, it feels great spending time here. This is definitely my most favorite place in Singapore."
,,Just another library,4.0,,"Honestly its just another library. We have many libraries around Singapore called Singapore public library. These places are for people to borrow books or read books there. If you want see library with cooler design or the more unusual ones. You can visit 5 different polytechnic (college) in Singapore. According to my friends from other colleges, my college which is Republic Polytechnic, located in woodlands (North of Singapore), is worth a visit. Of course, u have to look like a student or a teacher to enter."

The kids are free to read on a chair, slumped on the floor or whatever position they're comfortable in. There are book reading schedules as well."
,,An incredibly modern facility providing spectacular services!,5.0,,"Over the past 20 years, the National Library has become likely the very best source for information of all types in Asia. Originally a somewhat sleepy book-oriented facility, the National Library has embraced technology in a stunning fashion. Initiating computer-based services, serving not just library patrons, but also every residence in the government housing blocks (as well, of course all residents and visitors to Singapore), the Library pioneered the service of providing access to worldwide collections. Digital collections, ranging from movies, art and artifacts are also available to the user."

,,Not just a common library.,4.0,,"Feel impressed by their building by categorized different subject into different levels for the ease of book lovers or students.

,,A must visit for experience even if u r not a book lover,5.0,,"National library is an imposing structure in central business district of Singapore. It's at a 3-4 minutes walking distance from Bugis and Bras Basah stations. Located at corner of the road, the 15 story structure appears like a jumbo club sandwich.

National library board has several smaller and 4 regional libraries across the island. The national library building at Bugus is the head office or the main library. Entry is free.

NL is a great place to sit and read. There is a big open space in its premises which is often used by students for group discussion, guitar playing or rehearsals. It is also used for exhibitions. There is a book drop facility as well as a cafe there.

The library is open till 9 pm daily and closed on public holidays.

Library houses books in 4 official languages in Singapore - English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil. The collection is rich and huge. You can also place a request for a book which you can't find there and they will procure the same in a week or two if they find the book will be useful.

Library also provides Internet facility and research rooms, group discussion rooms, photocopying facilities, drinking water, toilets and free lockers.

The basement is borrowing and children section where readers can read newspapers, magazines and books as well as borrow the books and CDs.

The upper floors are reference section floors where readers can sit and read but are not allowed to borrow books.

The ambience is simply superb with a great city views. There are free lockers outside each floor on reference section for safekeeping your eatables and own books which you may be stopped from taking inside.

Some floors are used for exhibitions and some are rented out to foreign universities and theaters.

The library is a must visit for its experience even if you are not a book buff."
,,Bookish,4.0,,"Have an interesting time by going up to the information desk and asking them : ""well what books do you have?"""
,,"Splendid building, great views, important exhibition.",5.0,,"We’ve often passed, but this is the first time we’ve been inside. Everybody should see the building, and the map exhibition is well worth a visit. The exhibition ends July 2015 but one map in the lobby (and that’s a very interesting one) is permanent. The exhibition is free, so everybody should spend a short time here.
Maps of Singapore are on Level 11, while maps of the region are on Level 10. We particularly enjoyed learning how the maps were prepared using different methods over the years, also we were interested to see the maps drawn by the British during the war showing the Japanese advance across Malaysia and into Singapore. And we managed to pick out our hotel on a map dating from the 1950s.
In addition to the maps, there are seating areas with stunning views of the city.
If you have time, also visit Level 8, where there is currently a display of books on Singapore’s history, doubtless available for reading after the exhibition ends. We learnt a lot here. Mr Lee Kuan Yew (the first prime minister) had a skill for seeing the big picture and for noting when even small details were wrong. See how that ability has improved the city.
Excellent toilets are available on various floors. There’s a cafe just outside the library as well as another in the building, but this time we had a snack in Bugis Junction which is just across the road.
We spent a couple of hours here, and didn’t see everything. The more you know of Singapore the longer you’ll want to spend seeing how the city changed over the years. But all visitors will enjoy a brief visit to this exhibition, a look at this beautiful building and a chance to enjoy the view from it."
,,My favourite library,3.0,,"Love to visit this library. Can spend the whole Saturday morning here if I am not working. Also, the location is near the shopping malls so after reading you can enjoy some retail therapy."
,,Central & well - stocked,5.0,,"A place to read & rest. Quiet but busy with many readers with families or friends. A restaurant is near the entrance for tired feet & hungry readers. A meaningful place if one needs to get information Counter staff are very helpful, approachable & friendly."
,,"Books, Oh Books",4.0,,The place is heaven for book lover. there is even old collection like newspaper collection that you can access. remember to shut off your phone and be indulge in this book heaven. and you can sit here and read books all day long. and the collection is more then those neighbourhood library.
,,National Library -- popular with students and book-lovers,5.0,,"Building is imposing-looking but the constant stream of readers, students and the odd tourists make this a vibrant and attractive place to visit. There are exhibitions all the time, eg the current one on Singapore's Early Maps, on Level 10. The balcony on this level has been turned into a nice garden with tall green plants -- a good place to relax and enjoy bird's eye views of the neighbourhood. ."
,,awesome for a quiet afternoon!,5.0,,"It may not be popular choice when on vacation, but my Singaporean hubby insisted we visit with the kids. This was our children's first time in Singapore. We weren't disappointed! You'd be hard pressed to find a library more impressive anywhere. There are several levels, escalators, amazing views through large glass windows, and it's crazy how efficient and organized it is! This is a place you can lounge and read with your kids, with beautiful displays and cheerful, comfy seating areas. If you need a day to just decompress, add this place to your itinerary."
,,Watch out for the special exhibitions,5.0,,"Excellent library, but from a toursist point of view, the key thing is too watch oout for their exhibitions.

Free to enter, and very well done. I am a regular visitor, but I particularly enjoyed the Raffles exhibition there. Many interesting exhibits, including many letters written by Sir Stamford Raffles."
,,More than books...,4.0,,More than just a library when there are always plenty of events like exhibitions (both indoor and outdoor) taking place and it's also a place where one can check on the newspaper archive dated back to the 19th century.
,,"A welcoming ""green"" building near Chijmes and the Raffles Hotel",4.0,,"Though I haven't visited many national libraries, this modern building struck as me as inviting, comfortable and easy to reach from all parts of Singapore. It's a respectable example of energy effcient design fit nicely into its surroundings. We rode the elevator to an upper floor and discovered that the building is home to UNLV Singapore school of hotel administration."
,,Expected More,3.0,,"This multilevel building is much more than a library. Problem is, the signage is not very clear and I was unable to find the books - they were located in the basement. There was a large selection of travel-related books, although much of it was dated - I guess the internet is a more reliable and up to date reference these days. For a city such as Singapore I expected a more dramatic, architecturally-inspiring structure. Lounges and reading rooms located on upper floors with natural lighting would have been nice. The only natural light filtering into the basement was from the small garden - barely enough places to sit for more than 5-10 people."
,,Decent selection of books,3.0,,The National Library is quite an impressive place with a wide ranging collection of books. There's also a fairly decent theatre located in the building for plays (unfortunately there are very few good plays in Singapore though). Otherwise the building itself is a fairly standard modern construction.
,,Functional And Modern But Not The Most Beautiful,3.0,,"This is a modern, ""green"" national library seeking to be a repository of information and knowledge as well as a core for the reading movement and literary groups. Locals who compare this central library with the less modern satellite libraries throughout Singapore will rate it highly. However in my opinion it pales in iconic degree relative to the old national library at Stamford Road. This is also not one of the most beautiful libraries in the world or in Asia. If one had been to the Bhutan National Library, Beitou Library in Taiwan, Sasson Library in India or the National Peoples' Library in China, you will think that the Singapore library is just an office block. I am not even comparing against Bibliotheque in France, Escorial in Spain, or Abbey in Switzerland, Trinity in Ireland or the Central Library of Vancouver. It is a library built on a very tight piece of land; possibly due to high land costs.

The note for international travellers is:

1) Visit this library and spend no more than 15 mins for photo-ops as part of a larger itinerary covering places like Bras Brasah bookstores or art museums or design centre;

2) Check out their website and call in advance about events. A visit that tie in with events is always more meaningful than a mere look-see;

There is a cafe on the ground floor. There are no souvenier shops. I can't see how it can be rated as an attraction for international travellers.

The library is between the City Hall subway and Bugis Junction subway stations."
,,Epic library,5.0,,"The library is so huge and has plenty of books. I can find many kinds of books including fiction, and non fiction.
One thing that I do not like from this library is it has no returning cart at each session, so I have to walk kinda far to put back the book"
,,Very interesting and helpful library,5.0,,I used to be here when I was a student. It is just 5 minutes walking distance from Bugis MRT. There will be different level for different majors. Materials are huge and well-maintained. I'm falling in love with this NLB always!
,,Big library with a vast collection of books,4.0,,"I don't have to mentioned how big this library is. It's vast collections of books is something that you can look forward too.

However, there are also students studying there, which is fine if they are using the library materials. Most of them just require the power point for their laptops, which is a bummer and deprived others from using it."
,,Biggest library in Singapore,4.0,,"This is the largest library in Singapore. You could easily spend a day in the basement searching for books. If you love books, this is worth a visit."
,,not a boring library,4.0,,amazing design there is even huge trees in the library very convenient the design of the bldg outside is jaw dropping clean and modern inside
,,Biggest Library I have explored,5.0,,"It is really huge with every possible Books , movies etc available Very peaceful seating with the view of the city"
,,Good reading and escape theheat,3.0,,"This is probably ine of the biggest library I have ever been to, it has so many levels and loads of collection! I was attarcted by the exhibiton and started to wandered more and discovered so many genres to read and good chairs around too"
,,National Library of singapore,4.0,,"Located at victoria street and near to the MRT train station, it is centrally positioned.There are many books of various kinds and journals in particular SES journal where I gather data for my research project in finance at Victoria University"
,,extensive collections of books,3.0,,"quiet and calm place, you can read all day. nice facilities. I used to come here twice a week during my study. love it!"
,,Dream come true for bookworms,4.0,,This library has a huge array of books - especially the reference sections! Recommended for their history section.
,,i dream of getting locked up in here!!,5.0,,"A bookworms ultimate haunt in Singland!!! It's got everything - life, death, drama, controversy, sex, murder, mystery, etc. All to be enjoyed in the quietude of an abbey or monastry. Check out the high-rise garden on one of the top floors! Never get tored of this place even when there's nothing else going on!"
,,A beautiful building if nothing else.,4.0,,"Sorry but a library is a library. As it was just by our hotel, The Intercontinental, I popped in to have a look. I did enjoy the architecture of the building but perhaps I should have taken more time to do some research or something."
,,Good Place to study or reading book,5.0,,Good place to study things and alots of knowledge in this library than others. This building have a study rooms to public. Good place to have quiet and peace area to relax.
,,24 Hours Service,4.0,,"I came here when they held an event called ""Hands: Gift of a Generation"" placed outside the main building. There's a video show presenting the country's founding father. However, i got impressed on how they manage the library circulation. Yes, they put 24-hours bookdrop for returning the books."
,,Check out what is the visiting exibition,5.0,,"I have dropped in here on many visits to Singapore, sometimes nothing is going on, but other times the visiting exibits are amazing, I learned more here in a feew hours about ancient trade routes and their impacts on each communities language, food and populations than all other Museums and the likes I have visited, they do a great job and it is worth going to see whats up while you are in town."
,,Impressive and extensive,4.0,,"For research, it is unbeatable. However, make sure you have a cell phone that works in Singapore if you want to use the WiFi. When you go to use it, it will ask for your cell phone number and then sends you a password to your phone. Without that password, you can't access their WiFi service. Fortunately, there is a Coffee Beanery nearby that has free WiFi if you need it."
,,Enjoyed a browse,4.0,,Great shelter from the heat whilst on holiday but also to take some quiet time. But really I went because I love to visit the main library in every city I travel to.
,,Attraction?,4.0,,"Surprised this is listed as an attraction. The National Library is definitely a nice place to read, relax, borrow books but not sure if it will appeal to tourists?"
,,Very Huge and Nice Collection!,5.0,,I went there continuosly for almost 2 months. You can sit and read the whole with so many books to pick from! Although I wish they could increase the collection of some competitive exams.
,,For some quiet time,3.0,,"The National Library of Singapore is a great place for some quiet time and away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore. If you are in the Bugis area and love quietness and books this is the place to be, if not don't bother. ;p"
,,I love our National Library,5.0,,"To get access to reference materials, books and also videos...i love going to our libraries in Singapore. Sometimes if I want to get more artistic and drama influenced materials i will head down to the library at the Esplanade.
http://www.zsiti.com/2014/04/a-weekend-at-libraryesplanade.html

Going to the library also is a means of stress relief from work :)"
,,"Library, theatre, art gallery in one",4.0,,A treasure trove for the bibliophile. HOsts interesting theatre plays. Check out art shows. Tip? There's a guided tour of the facilities:)
,,Great facilities,5.0,,"One thing that I like about the libraries in Singapore is that they close at night. They are open to all, even though I am not a Singaporean. The National Library on Victoria Street is one of my favourites. It is a good a place to enjoy reading and has wonderful facilities. The recently opened children's section at the basement will bring joy to the kids with the world's first green library for kids."
,,Good collection,5.0,,Very collection of varied books. Very informative too. we enjoyed visiting the library. Would recommend for one time visit.
,,"Many level, quiet place",5.0,,"Great place to do your self study because if one level if filled, there are many other level to find space and do your study, so you can try it next time if you are looking for a space to study but avoid weekend!"
,,excellent,4.0,,"excellent 7 floor of the library. good place for people to enjoy reading time. they devide each floor have special function. the magazine floor, reference floor, ..."
,,The largest book collection!,4.0,,The largest book collection with a great reference section however a little too busy! .. And parking is costly!
,,Quiet and refreshing,5.0,,"I always feel lucky and appreciative of the free library facilities that my government gives to our people. Those library books that I borrowed broaden my outlook of life and add spice of inspiration and motivation towards living a better quality of life. I started borrowing books from our library almost 30 years ago and I have seen the changes that our libaries went through and the number of new books in the library is always increasing. Lately, for those 50 yrs and above (locals), we can also surf the internet for free for an hour every day. At the comfort of air-condition and a quiet ambience, there are not many places in Singapore which really attract my heart to it. They are also built very conveniently in shopping malls and you can find them almost at most constituencies. You can take a rest in the library enjoying the coolness and the serene environment after a tired walk in the mall. It is extremely rejuvenating. I can really say that we have one of the best library systems in this part of the world having visited libraries in Taiwan, China, Brunei, Malaysia, etc."
,,"Lovely, windy open-air areas with nice views.",5.0,,"I LOVE the library system in Singapore. I think it's one of the best in the world, at least for its citizens and members. It's comfortable, beautifully-maintained, obviously well-funded and well-staffed, and it has excellent, current collections. It was the second library in the world to rent out iPads, and also rents out other electronic equipment like Kindles. And conducts regular workshops on all sorts of things according to community needs and demand. I went this particular branch (this is the headquarters, I think) for the first time a few days ago, and took the lifts to the floor on which there were these sweet, shaded little outdoor ""gardens"", with stone paths and wooden benches and platforms to sit on. They were windy and cool, and offered lovely views of the area. People have commented that they were disappointed that the library isn't housed in some fancy gorgeous building and that it's functional. I think that what they don't realise is that there are very well-stocked branches all over the island, and the library in Singapore is, yes, functional, rather than a show-off piece of loveliness where you can't borrow books, most of the collections are in stacks, and you have to pay a fortune to photocopy what you need to borrow. This is a library that serves its purpose. And, frankly, I don't see anything wrong with the building. It's modern. Singapore a modern city."
,,For the Bookfellows,5.0,,"My friend brought me to the Central Library in Bugis to show me how awesome their library system is. I have to admit, I was duly impressed. The library houses several floors of books for research and leisure reading. The building itself if open and airy, which invites a positive environment for readers and researchers. There are stations available to plug your laptop in and couches all over the place. They also have stacks of audiobooks available. The kids also have their own area which is decorated like a mini-jungle. It's one place I think is worth spending a quiet afternoon in. I loved the place so much I wanted to wrap it and bring it home."
,,One of the best libraries in Asia,5.0,,"Granted I haven't been to the libraries in China or Japan, but Singapore's library system is pretty damn good...high tech, comprehensive, and current. The National Library has a great location is housed in pretty cool architecture. Staff are super friendly and all kinds of facilities abound including great searchable computer databases, with easy to find material."
,,Library,5.0,,"always a favoutite haunt of mine . execellent service , excellent place to find good books .the cafes are good and always vibrant."
,,Great resources for family history research,4.0,,Having come to Singapore specifically to research my family history I found this library inviting and all of the staff very helpful.
,,National Library Singapoe,4.0,,"Want to get away from the ""madding crowd"", a visit to the National Library is the place. Not only is there a vast collection of books but also there are regular exhibitions. I went to an exhibition ""Roots"" tracing family histories; it traced the roots of two families, and the methodology used by both families. The free resource guide provided was brilliantly produced."
,,Worth dropping by,3.0,,"Conveniently situated in town (a 10 minute walk from Bugis MRT), the National Library is an impressive building housing the largest collection of books. Do check out whether there are any ongoing exhibitions on different floors or even outside the library before dropping by. Otherwise, one could always recharge and read up at various floors and there are even plenty of power sockets available for free.

However, it gets especially crowded during the examination period to the extent there is a queue formed before 10AM. Security checks (bag checks) are also required before entering and exiting at certain floors and to avoid going through too many of them, use the staircases within the floor.

Opened from 10AM - 9PM"
,,A good place for 'mugging',4.0,,"Quiet, brightly lit and conducive - a perfect place to study! Not to mention power sockets are available."
,,Fruitful information,5.0,,"i love this place, it gave me a lot of information of Singapore culture & People. I think you will appreciate these once you visit to the new country"
,,Library with a history,5.0,,"To many singaporeans, this is a library with a history. Take a tour and experience for yourself the daily lives of the locals. Visiting the library is very much part of the locals ' everyday activities."
,,NLS,4.0,,It's near Orchard with huge facilities and you can enjoy some arts too. Excellent facilities where you can return the library books at any library nationwide even though the library is closed using NFC tag in the books.
,,Various Exhibits,4.0,,Various exhibits free of entry charge. Street Names and WW2 Farrer Park were both very good. The exhibition halls are on the higher floors. Bags have to be left in the free lockers outside.
,,Complete Collection,4.0,,"V nice and quite place to read. A really wide range of collection. Children section is quietly tuck away unable to cant hear the sound from children section at all from other sections.
V beautiful children section space for both children and parents. A place very rich in arts and culture"
,,Not a typical tourist attraction,5.0,,"We unexpectedly went to the library but if you are passing it is worth a visit. It is enormous, very modern, well organised and inviting. Not like any other public library I've visited."
,,The place to chill after Bugis Mania,5.0,,"The world will be a better place if only people spend more time at the library. But not so useful a tip in a review website.
I like to start the weekend at Bugis junction across the narrow street of Middle Road where there are many shops to explore. To rest the legs and gather my thoughts and senses, I like to find spot at the library to read for at least an hour.
The library is well stocked with current magazines, books and other publications. Most weekends, there will be an exhibit, a writer giving talks or both. Or catch a play at the theatre on the upper floor in the same premise."
,,Lovely Children's Corner,4.0,,"This is the main library and it is centrally located. It also includes the Drama Centre on levels 3 to 5 (I think). The children's section is lovely and fun for kids, with a treehouse and lots of reading areas. Some of the chairs can even double up as rocking ""horses"". This section is very well decorated and kid friendly!"
,,Good resources for all,5.0,,"Library has been my favorite place even in this Internet era. The National Library has variety of literatures to comic book, also electronic medias. Whether you have specific item to look for or just browsing around, this place is always fun to visit."
,,It's a library,3.0,,"At number 22 on the list and close to the hotel I was staying at I thought I had better drop in for a look. I was a little disappointed on what I found. Yes there are lots of books, but that is what a library is for. Often National librarys are housed in impressive buildings and have significant manuscripts and books to look at, the building is nothing special in Singapores collection of modern and old buildings and although I walked around for 40 minutes I didn't find any exhibitions or displays of any interest. A bit of artwork from some artist and a school could only provoke mild interest from me. This library is functional rather than somewhere for the tourist, for the local it is a place to get out of the heat and read some of the many world newspapers that were available, but I wouldn't add this to your places to visit in Singapore if you are travelling through."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Awesome is the one word to describe the National Library. Great place especially for peace of mind :)
,,Library at a busy plc,4.0,,This library is open to public. Great range of books and audio books to choose from. Near bugis and bras basah mrt.
,,Huge miracle of books,5.0,,I visited this library for a workshop and once on a casual visit. It has huge collections of books and very modern architecture.
,,A wide variety of books available,3.0,,"The service provided by the library is good, there are many books here, and it is free for everyone to visit. You have to be a member to borrow library materials and fees may be levied on foreigners. Tourists are not allowed to borrow any materials. There are also many reference books not available for borrowing. On Saturdays, the crowd is there even before 9am. The students like to use the study lounge on level 5 for their schoolwork, however I also see many using other levels that are reserved for library book users only. The security allowed the students to bring their bags into the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library even though it is forbidden by library rules. Hence, on weekends, it is hard to find a seat, to enjoy the library books. Using of handphones, making calls and taking photos in the library is strictly forbidden, but many are still doing it, especially many visitors like to go to level 11, and take photos of the Singapore skyline there."
,,Who doesn't love books?,5.0,,"The Singapore National Library is really a big achievement,in my opinion. There are National Libraries all over Singapore so you can definitely be sure that you will have one near you. The library is gigantic and beautiful . All the books are arranged neatly on the shelves. It is that neat that it is arranged alphabetically and numerally. It's architectural design is breathtaking and definitely worth going to . Though there are some libraries which are pretty old, the new ones are amazing. Like the one near Parkway Parade, it's beautiful ! The library has literally EVERY book there is, ranging from young children books to adult books. Every time I go there, I find the book I look for. In fact, there are so much interesting books, sometimes, you just want to take all of them and borrow them. The National Library near Parkway Parade, even had a coffee shop inside, though I don't eat or drink there even though the aroma is delightful."
,,Always proud of our libraries,5.0,,"Having been to over 20 countries, I truly appreciate our libraries which are so well stocked with a good range of books, videos, audios etc. what I like is that they make them accessible by having small branches all over the island. You can reserve books and ask to collect them at a branch near you. Even recommend books for them to purchase. I often borrow anywhere between 10 to 20 books and videos for my whole family each time. A great treat."
,,great library,3.0,,"located on an 11,304-square metre site between Bugis Junction and the Bras Basah Complex at 100, Victoria Street.The MRT stations nearby.The blocks are linked by skybridges on every floor. It houses two libraries, the Central Public Library in Basement 1 and the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library from Levels 7 to 13. It also houses the Drama Centre from Levels 2 to 5, which is managed by the National Arts Council."
,,Huge!,5.0,,"Went here to watch a show in Drama Centre Theatre. Came too early so we decided to walk around in the building. Turns out that its so informative, big and the architecture is very nice. Too bad we came during sunday so its a bit packed."
,,Huge collection of books!,5.0,,"I visited this library lat month, it is located in a modern 11 storey building. Each floor is dedicated with different categories of books, easy accessbile by MRT and bus. Free Wifi if you registered with Spore Telco (M1). For foreigners, you can visit ans use the facilities except borrowing anything from the library. You can do that by joining as member for a fee. After visit the library, you can visit bugis junction which is just accross the road. Ride a bicycle there is encouraged too ;) You can easily find any books/ reading materials because the collection is huge! Locker storage is available in every floor."
,,worth a visit if you are staying nearby,4.0,,Beautiful building with excellent resources & great views of Singapore from the higher floors. Can get busy during exam times. Get a cold drink and sit and people watch in the open area near the entrance.
,,Public Library in Singapore,5.0,,"There are many public libraries here in Singapore - and the library I like best is the library@esplanade. This is a special library located within the Esplanade (Theatres by the Bay) and it is unique with its collection of music and arts - books and CDs and there is also a wide collection of DVDs (movies) including classics which are available on loan.

For a first time visitor to our public libraries, if you should be anywhere near the Marina Bay area - do come to visit the Library at the Esplanade (take a lift to the top floor) and enjoy the unique reading and studying and research ambience of this special library!

Happy Visit to Singapore!"
,,National library of Singapore,5.0,,National library of Singapore is located beside Bras Basah Complex and the building consists of few libraries at respective floors.

That' why you can find books you want. It's so quiet and clean, so this place is suit to study although there are a lot of people. In addition, this library has student lounge. Therefore, you can study comfortable.
Besides, because information staffs are so kind, if you have any troubles, you can ask them. They will solve your problem politely.
If you are a tourist, you cannot borrow a book. But it is worth going there to see a lot of varieties of the books and small museum."
,,Great selection of books and ambience,5.0,,"If you didn't know better, you would have thought this futuristic building was an office building. All the books are in very good condition and there's a wide selection to suit all. Go for the Reference Libraries - there's lots of treasures in there, and you can easily spend an entire day reading! The city view from the top is also pretty good."

,,Bras Basah Library,4.0,,"This is a book lover's Home Away from Home! Depending on your personality and preference, you'll find a comfortable niche to research and mug away... Enjoyed Levels 7 & 8 the best.

,,If you are reader,3.0,,"Its probably a more local hang out place or youngsters or uncles/aunties (who are after the daily papers and getting good seats).

But doesn't mind it's not worth to visit if you love to read. One must agree that Singapore government put a lot of efforts to let anyone who love to read or wish to learn. There are many community libraries islandwide."

,,Great Service !,5.0,,"The easy borrowing impressed me!
Books are tagged with RFID and you can just place up to 6 books on the scanner.
The scanner scans all books together and your account is updated!

The reservation service is also helpful.
You can go online to reserve a book from other branches, and have it delivered to the branch nearest to you when it is available! All for a token fee which is lower than the bus fare!

We love visiting the main library at Victoria for its collection & ambience.
Also attended several plays at the auditorium before.
Each visit usually includes popping over to Bras Basah Complex nearby for art supplies & stationery. And ends with a meal at the restaurant (Hans) on the ground floor!"
,,Views from the elevator not to be missed !,5.0,,For free information on Singapore and SE Asia you can always use the library and its resources.

,,Cheerful and scholarly,4.0,,"NLB has several locations; I visit the Clementi branch frequently ( 5th floor of Clementi Mall incorporating the MRT station and bus interchange) It is a well laid-out cheerfully decorated place with helpful staff. Normally, you can get a chair which is not possible in more popular NLB outlets like the Central Library"

,,Great Library,4.0,,"One of the finest libraries I have ever visited, huge collection of books. Enjoyed visiting their building and collection."
,,Pillar of Singapore,5.0,,"After almost 15+ years I entered into a library for the sake of my kids. After the Alexandria library that I toured, this is the best library I have ever seen. Equal importance given to all kinds of books for all ages and most importantly the habit of book reading is cultivated which shapes up a person. More than my daughter I like visiting it these days."
,,Very useful,5.0,,"These libraries are just so useful for everyone. You can borrow books, DVD's, PC games, and magazines for FREE. It's so easy for anyone to find things they need, or to borrow things. They also have things in different languages, such as Chinese, Malay and more. The staff was really nice, and they try their best to help us whenever we need it. There are different leveled books for Children, Young Adults, and Adults, and different genres too."

,,book lovers paradise,5.0,,"the National Library just behind my home at Toa Payoh is the most wonderful place.
books ,newspapers,dvds ...you name it and its there.
FREE for availing there if you are not a member.for a small price as an annual membership if you want to take them home.
it so happened that my daughter joined during the offer and promotion period.so at a time she could avail of 16 books,dvds magazines,,,YES SIXTEEN at a time for home issue.
I also attended a STAR GAZING program conducted there for the common public.
very informative study of the sky and also the then happening SUPERMOON was discussed.Due to the HAZE,we did not actually use the telescope that day,but the speaker was so very descriptive that I could literally see what he said..Mr Gary Lee was the speaker for that evening.
the library also had organised an ORIGAMI class for the general public free of cost.
personally I did not attend.
the range of languages that the books are available is amazing.english,Malay,chinese and Tamil were the languages available.
there is a newspaper reading section also.beautifully secured newspapers are on the reading tables for us to read and I also noticed a QUIET reading section.here the previous days news papers are there for people to take down notes or references.
one word,a treasure of knowledge in a clean ambience.gr8 place."
,,The BEST library in Singapore,5.0,,"If you are bored and lonely, and wish to read something, head down to this chic and contemporary library in the heartland of Singapore at Bugis. It has some of the best collections of books (in terms of variety) and so far is the biggest and best library in Singapore. It is also ideal for any student to camp down here for their finals preparation as the environment is tranquil and conducive for studying and reading. I enjoy visiting this library whenever I am free and have lots of time. It is just located next to Bugis shopping area and Bras Brasah, where you can shop till you drop or to browse some second-hand books at Bras Brasah. Moreover, there will always be free exhibitions in the ground floor where interesting themes about Singapore culture are presented. Toilets are clean and plentiful. Nevertheless, you may wish to expect crowds during weekends or near exam period as there will be many parents who will bring their kids or there will be many undergraduates who take up most of the tables."
,,Must visit Library,5.0,,"If you have children, this library is a must visit! Children have play area where they can read and enjoy stories that can shape their minds. So much comic books for teenagers as well. They have been labeled as the green library for children."
,,10 floors of reading & non-reading exploration!,5.0,,"Good:
-1 floor dedicated to exhibitions.
-Water dispensers are provided on selected floors.
-2 floors dedicated to a mid-sized theatre, showing plays & musicals.
-Able to read the paper-copies of international newspapers.
-Able to read the latest issues of magazines.
-Ample terminals for surfing the Internet.
-Opens from 10am to 9pm.

Bad:
-Only 1 floor for the borrowing of books.
-Cafe on the ground floor is pricey."
,,Great Place to be.,4.0,,"As a book lover, I am inclined to love libraries but this one the best with activities for kids etc so I can go hide and read my stuff."
,,A great network of public libraries,5.0,,"A great network of public libraries for the benefits of not just the citizen but for every one who lives or comes to Singapore. A friendly network of public libraries, which reminded me of the unfriendly and unpleasant experience with public libraries overseas particularly in Europe."
,,Contains everything you're looking for in a library,5.0,,"It's huge, it's conveniently located in the city, it's clean, it's quiet, it has lots of books - cds - dvds, it offers photocopy services. This place has everything you could possibly look for in a library. Very well-maintained! (If you're looking for a weird experience, try using the lift back and forth to the highest & lowest level - it goes very fast, it's sensational :P)"
,,Great Library for a great City,5.0,,Other countries should visit the national library in Singapore to see how a public library should be like and how it should serve its people. Kudos to city and its government for this magnificent addition to the quality of life for adults and youth alike.
,,"Books, books and more books",3.0,,There's a variety of well categorized books to choose from. Usually quiet and gives one a sense of peace while doing some quiet reading.
,,huge collection of books...,5.0,,"the staff are accommodating and the library facilities are excellent :) i did passed my qualifying exams.....coz, i got a peaceful space to review"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,The roof terrace is very nice. Gives a good view. There is a small exhibit about campaigns in Singapore which tell a lot about the history of this state.
,,Knowledge Trove,5.0,,"Good for locals as a knowledge source, but nothing much for tourists, other than the occasional exhibits. Check NLB website for details."
,,Different perspective,4.0,,"I have always wanted to pay this library a visit each time I found myself in Singapore. Finally I managed to spend a few hours in this wonderful complex. I went straight downstairs into the Central Public Library. It was a bit noisy as there were many children around and there was some renovation works going on. However, I was very pleased with the plenty choices of books and newspapers from around the globe. Interestingly, this library has a good collection of books in all of Singapore's national languages.

Would definitely try to visit again and maybe head upstairs to experience the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library."
,,"Friendly staff, nice collections",5.0,,"As a confirmed bibliophile, I visit libraries for fun. Staff was helpful, and I spent about 2 hours browsing around. It provided a refreshing contrast to the bustling malls in Singapore."
,,the location and the atmosphere especially the parking lots,5.0,,i like that the library has alot of choices and selections for me to choose from and that its suitable for all ages.
,,So many books!,4.0,,"There are so many books! They have books for all ages, children, teens and adults. You can borrow the books and give them back anytime you want."
,,Good place to spend some quiet time,3.0,,A good place to spend some quiet time to read your favorite novels and magazines. Location is just next to Bugis Junction.
,,Everything you could ever want... and more.,5.0,,The National Library in Singapore is a monument unto itself - it really does have every last bit of detail on just about any subject one could possibly imagine. The Building is kept cool and quiet and there are study areas provided so that you can work at a desk using the books and other media provided at your own comfort. The staff were very helpful and kind.
,,Good selection with some limitations,4.0,,"You do not find everything at the National Library in Singapore, just as you definitely would not find all books anywhere here, simply due to the tough censorship here. But the library has a fair collection of books. The only thing I don't like is that the ambience feels a bit dark and depressing, specially at the children's area. I am not sure if this has been changed since I last went there."
,,library,5.0,,"good collection of books for reading and reference.can be used as reading room also.no entry fees,even if you are a foreigner.you have to pay only in case you borrow books."
,,LIB,5.0,,you will surely feel how much Singapore government cares about giving a good education conditions to it people. well organized and easy to borrow any book or references online or or by walk in
,,NLB Singapore,4.0,,"I'm in awed with the huge collections, cleanliness of the place. Very well kept, nice place to read and study. It's very crowded though."
,,Rip off,2.0,,"If you are a 'foreigner' you get to pay a hefty $50 fee.

Perhaps it would be worthwhile if the DVD collection wasn't measly or if the lib. allowed you to request inter library loans for free. However, on top of $50 membership there is a $1.99 fee for reserving and requesting movies. If youare a foreign expat from the US and are used to the FREE facilities at public libraries (even for non-citizens) you'll be majorly dissapointed.

Now on to the positives: The location at NEX mall is awesome ( that's what i frequent the most). I like that you can check out magazines. Overall, book and magazine collection is good."
,,'5 star' Library,5.0,,"Look no further, this is the place where you will find a huge collection of reading material, it is much quieter too (especially in the upper floors) than most regional libraries that I've been to which have a limited range of books, are noisier, especially those situated in shopping malls (more like a bookshop than library). There are plenty of seats at the borrowing section in the basement and I've also visited the study lounge located at the fifth floor which is amazingly quiet."
,,Biiiiiiiiiiiiiig,4.0,,Your neighborhood library doesn't have the stuff you need for your thesis? Head on down to the NLB and feel grown up and important while researching for stuff in a large quiet area where you can easily doze off in your own thoughts.
,,Heaven amongst books,5.0,,"What a wonderful library. The thirteen floors are all efficiently and well stocked and staffed. The Asian collection on three upper floors is amazing. Access to rare documents is relatively easy with efficient service available to provide you with the document or information you requite for your research (or reading pleasure).
In addition to the excellent service provided by the National Library itself the regional libraries throughout Singapore are almost like a cohesive whole, offering efficient and pleasant assistance.
It is a pleasure to visit each and all of Singapore's libraries."
,,Big collection of books,5.0,,Big collection of books! Borrowing section is on level B1. The rest of the section are reference sections. There is also a theater in building.
,,I love this place!!! - channeling my inner geek,5.0,,"So, if you love books (like me) and you like to read (like me), you will love this place.

I love it because:
1. It's big - most probably you will find what you're looking for here
2. It's FREE - free for anyone to read :-)
3. It's clean and orderly and systematic - a microcosm of Singapore
4. It's accessible
5. It's suitable for anyone - kids to adults
6. Location is great - it's near bras basah complex, bugis junction, and many other interesting places.
7. Design and architecture - it's well thought of, well-planned, and well-designed.

Overall, if you have time in Singapore, you can drop by here, take a break, and see how the Singaporeans enjoy these kinds of facilities."
,,Informative exhibition on Raffles,5.0,,"Was there to check out the books (a wonderful selection) but the exhibition on Stamford Raffles was informative too. Enjoyed the polite yet attentive staff. The library is clean, spacious and very welcoming. I'd go again!"
,,Modern,4.0,,"New building with exception eference material and environment. Stiudents will love it. As will researchers, built with the modern world in mind."
,,Excellent kids area,5.0,,"It was the September term break, and I had to bring my restless girls somewhere. And then I remembered they'd never been to the main Library. It was a wonderful decision. The kids area was huge, with books well organised by age group. My girls actually managed to spend a few quiet hours in the library. And I had time to slowly browse the cookbook section and picked up some beautiful books. Pity a lot of the books from popular children's series were unavailable."
,,Excellent place to visit,5.0,,"We are new to the Town, which will be pretty easy if you read through the passage. We thought we ought to be members of the local library; we went to the National Library in Victoria Street, which is pretty close to our house.
We found the library to be a huge structure which is pretty well maintained, compared to the libraries which we had seen in the places where we lived earlier.
The total building is called as the national library building out of which only the basement holds the national library and other floors have different functions. There is a reference library situated within the building, which I have seen quite a few people visit.
The library has large collection of fiction work, as I like it the most so the place has become a frequent visiting place for me.
There is a collection of Newspapers, magazines which are printed in other countries collected here. As an avid reader I find this place a entertaining place where there is an abundance of wealth.
To become a member for foreigners a fee of 53.30 is charged for a year. I am not sure about the fee for the locals, with this people can borrow 8 in no of articles at any given time which is pretty helpful.
There is an outdoor garden present which is called the bamboo garden, it is a pleasant place to sit and read in the evenings.
The main drawback which I feel is that there is no manual intervention in the whole process, for ex: I returned a book in a stall which is used for collecting the book, even after 3 weeks they are not able to locate the book and I am charged a fine for the same, which I think would have been eradicated if the same process to issue a book is followed.
There is a children section, which I think is not well replenished. There is a section for audio and video section too.
Over all I think it is a nice place to visit and spend time."
,,Prefer the regional libraries,3.0,,"Most of the time, we visited the libary for the kids. We felt that the area for the kids are not as cosy and still prefer the regional library like the one in Jurong."
,,Very organized!,4.0,,The library is so neat & complete reading material. Even is a place for us to chill inside and read some magazines will do to kill sometime.
,,heaven for readers,5.0,,"During our stay in Singapore on Aug 2012, my son insisted that he wanted to visit national library on brass basah road. The building is modern. Excellent service n place n friendly staff."
,,Quiet and cool,5.0,,"It's like a little haven being so quiet and cool. Great selection on magazines and newspapers, which you can read without being a member."
,,Good study place + great materials,4.0,,"Huge number of resources available - from Singaporean court archives to fiction - you can find floors of material in this place. Security is tight though... you have to place your belongings in lockers before entering certain floors - to prevent people from stealing library material, of course. A good place to study - the large tables and chairs are ideal for studying and teenagers flock here almost every day."
,,information,4.0,,There are a number of branches and it is convenient to borrow books. It is also an advantage the you can return books in the book drop.
,,Treasure trove in the city,5.0,,"Wonderful public service. Helpful staff. Quiet spots in the reference sections. IT enabled. AV collection, newspapers and magazine sections are pretty extensive too. Crowded in the weekends. Main branch is at Bras Basah but one can also return books at any of the branches island wide. Not as historic as many other libraries in the world, but certainly a very functional library."
,,Get a library card,4.0,,"I come here often with my daughter to borrow books. I have found some quite amazing stuff hidden away in the various sections. If you are interested in Asian history, there is a lot of stuff which will blow you away. well managed and clean,"
,,Cool facility - in more ways than one,5.0,,Great place to hang out to escape the outdoor heat - everyone else does! Lots of comfortable seating and you can spend a pleasant couple of hours browsing the excellent selection of English Language books - interrupted only by the sound of gentle snoring! Good sized children section too. Note that they are grateful for good quality donations..... books are so expensive in SG it is a good cause ......
,,Interesting building with wonderful content,4.0,,As a book lover the National Library is a wonderful place to stay. It is well layed out and easy to get what you need. Staff is very friendly and helpful too.
,,Excellent collections,5.0,,A excellent collection of books. And its easily accessible as its located near to the Bugi MRT station.
,,well organized,3.0,,"During my visit (31st May 2012) there was an exhibition of the history of Singapore street names, which gave a good overview of the general history of this city state. Also on display, the history of the Library."

,,Great collection of books,4.0,,The comprehensive collection of books - from bestsellers to esoteric compilations - at the library is something it can be proud of. You need a membership to take books out though.
,,a Library that quench your thirst for Knowledge,4.0,,"with 11 stories of books in-house, and huge range of books to choose from, very resourceful, its a library sure to satisfy your thirst. a very modern building with the comfort of your home. time to time it also hold exhibitions."
,,Excellent Library,5.0,,I have been visiting the National Library of Singapore since I was a kid. There are many libraries around Singapore and you can visit anyone of them to borrow books and return them at any branches.
,,"Lovely modern building, helpful staff and good resources",5.0,,"This is probably not a tourist attraction per se, but if you need to shelter from the rain or are researching anything, it's terrific. The building is large and modern - lots of glass and steel. Resources related to Singapore itself are on the 11th floor - well laid out, extensive and very helpful staff.

There is a nice cafe outside on the ground between the library and the next building. Just further along is a building that is full of second hand book shops."
,,Worth the deout,4.0,,"Beautiful building with nice city views (although not the highest), free internet access, and lots of space to sit, read, do your emails. Always an interesting exhibition or two on and a good programme of free events and talks. Only a few minutes' walk from Raffles Hotel and worth the 'detour' to see living Singapore."
