,,Picturesque waterside restaurants,5.0,,"This place is another one to add in your Singapore to-do list. It's famous for its chic bars & clubs, beautiful riverside restaurants and little bit of flea shopping.
They have an impressive line up of various cuisines and I don't have to say much about Singapore food; they are delicious!!

Great place to visit with family and friends. One can grab a drink from one of the many bars or try some of the signature dishes. Or just take a stroll around to just absorb the energetic mood around."
,,Party time all evening and night,4.0,,"Clarke Quay has a buzz about it constantly. A bit quieter in the day it takes off as people head to riverside bars and restaurants. There is much aplenty, river cruises and every type of cuisine imaginable."
,,Always lively in the evening!,5.0,,"Our most recent short stay in Singapore saw us visit Clarke Quay on two separate occasions.
When we visited in the early evening, it was full of people out to enjoy themselves with a drink, snacks or a meal. There were also many people shopping in the shopping mall located adjacent to the quay. We had been to Clarke Quay a number of times in the evening during previous visits to Singapore and each time the area has been teeming with people out to enjoy themselves.
Our second visit to Clarke Quay during our most recent stay in Singapore, occurred late on a Monday afternoon. This experience was a complete contrast to our evening visit. There had just been a brief tropical downpour and not surprisingly, the area was almost deserted. There were also a large number of bars, cafes and restaurants which had not yet opened for business. Consequently, there was a completely different feel to the area.
The recommendation then is that to experience the true vibe of Clarke Quay, it is best to visit during the evening hours – quite possibility the later, the better!"
,,Expensive so look around,4.0,,"This place is beautiful but utterly expensive and beers are around $17AUD after happy hour. A bottle of Water is $6AUD and most restaurants sell or dont serve any water at all which I think is terrible. I guess they just want you drink alcohol. So BYO water.

So here's a little guide to help. There are bars like tipsy gypsy near the Clarke quay mrt that have 3 Heineken for $12. There is a 7/11 in boat quay which is just a short walk down from a bar called skinnys lounge that serves tap tiger beer for $5 which is the cheapest I saw. Outside is a seating area where you can sit next to the river drinking it too. There is a nice place called SQUE which is a long outdoor dining area at riverside (across bridge from Clarke quay) which has 1 for 1 drink specials all day up to 11pm i think. I picked up two tigers for $12 one night and my sister 2 cocktails for $18. That's cheap in this area believe me.
Food is also ridiculous at Clarke quay so if want a cheaper option go to Liang court. They have asian dishes between $5 - $15 and is right next to Clarke quay. I would also suggest visiting satay by the bay in gardens by the bay which was lovely and pretty cheap. Of course there is the food inside shopping malls too and this includes marina bay sands. Food court on lower floor.is large and cheap.

If you want to go there I noticed Boat quay seems like a bit of red light district with a few girly bars. There are many working girls at Clarke quay too especially at a bar called highlander which has an age limit for men (no men under 28 and now I know why :) Music was good but Beer here is about $17. Clarke quay is nice but so expensive and I have been to.tokyo and it's far worse than that. Good for a beer or two or a meal or two but wouldn't spend all my time there unless you are rich :)"
,,Good time on the River,4.0,,Night time is great with all the buildings lighted up and the boats playing the River. Can also catch live music especially on weekends. The building facades on one side is retained from when Quay was used as cargo dock. Plenty of restaurants.
,,"Great fun, senses overload!",4.0,,"This was an awesome place to go for dinner! It was great fun, wonderful lights, colours, smells and a fantastic atmosphere. Lots of cafes & restaurants to choose from. A definite must visit - even watching the world go by on the river was fun. The only thing which could have improved our experience was the volume - we were there for a meal with friends, early evening, not to dance - & the music was so loud we could barely hold a conversation across the table. That being said, if we ever return to Singapore - we'll definitely go back for another meal!"
,,Very good,4.0,,A nice collection of bars and restaurants with good prices. You can also enjoy a walk along the river and enjoy the scenery.
,,Fun evening on the water,3.0,,Clarke Quay is a nice place to spend the evening and get some more upscale food that doesn’t break the bank. The mood was fun and there was something for everyone.
,,Great dining area,4.0,,Clarke Quay is a great area for either lunch or a night out. Lots of restaurants and bars in a pedestrianised area alongside the Singapore River
,,Very stylish,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a myst see if you are going to Singapore.

It was created initially as a group of 1950s chop houses but now it is colourful and cosmopolitan and us a dream to see from a boat during the evening.

You can walk around the shop front with say and night stopping for a drink or something to eat. There is something for everyone.

At 8pm you will see the fountain abd light show in the water ..... don't miss it. It's free and is set to music. Put it on your bucket list."
,,Great entertainment district,5.0,,"Something for everyone. Restaurants, bars, music......people watch or just walk along the water enjoying the lights on the buildings."
,,"Sherin Nafie Cairo, Egypt",4.0,,Clarke Quay is an amazing place that comes to life in the evening. Lots of restaurants & bars serving international food. I enjoyed tte lobster salad at TCC (The Connoisseur Concerto). Great place to take a stroll in the evening & enjoy live music. We took the river cruise from there & all of us (adults & teenagers greatly enjoyed it.
,,Fun place,5.0,,We visited to have a look around and decided to go on a night cruise. After the cruise we went to a bar and got a cocktail as it was happy hour
,,Do not miss a visit here,5.0,,This area of Singapore is sublime . There is so much to keep you busy from great river trips to eating places old places to view and new. great both in the day and night .
,,CLARKE QUAY,4.0,,"This is a great area to wander around in the evenings with a vast choice of restaurants - many of them on the river. The visual night delights of lights, boats etc add to the atmosphere. Beware though when ordering meals - what sounds reasonable can quickly become over priced as the rates quoted on the menus do not include the 24% tax."
,,Nightlife at its best,4.0,,"If you like music, pubbing and don't mind crowd then this is the place.. Choose your music and place.. Recommend Crazy elephant if you've crossed the dancing phase of your life and prefer your drink, live band and some good rock."
,,Ambiance,5.0,,So many bars and restaurants to check out. Give yourself lots of time to explore and stroll the different venues. Food from all over the world. Live music is everywhere.
,,So mamy SUAT BUT !,5.0,,Clarke QUAY is the best to relax in Singapore Variety of Foods almost all international kitchens in the presence of people from different cities of the WORLD
,,Comes alive in the eveni,4.0,,"Very quiet during the day - struggle to find a bar or restaurant open , but in the evening / night it comes alive and is really worth a visit"
,,Go there at night!,4.0,,"The few nights I was in Singapore we always went to Clarke Quay to drink at one of the many many bars. There's really something for every taste, food and drinks wise. Either you can sit outside one of the relaxed pubs half the night and drink your beer, or you hit one of the clubs and dance the night away with locals which are welcome like they knew you 10 years already. If you wanna get to know Singapore's night-life in a excited but safe environment this is the place to go."
,,Must Do,4.0,,Another part of Singapore that is on the must visit list is Clark Quay full of bars and eateries and colourful buildings set on the river either visit during the day (not as crowded) or at night when the area is s lot more livler
,,Lovely Area for the evening.,5.0,,"Absolute fun for the evening after spending a day at the Zoo or somewhere else. Great walk by the water and lights. There are tons of restos, amazing lights and laser and music playing around the places. Nice to walk around the area. You will see many eateries, the turkish ice cream man. Most places are sea food eateries so there might be less option if you are vegetarian or vegan. But you can manage. The river cruise is absolutely a must to do. Really great place for the evening."
,,Great spot,4.0,,"Great spot to walk thru and get happy hour drinks. They say happy hour but it’s an all day happy hour price. Some places are reasonably priced, other places are ridiculous. Food can be very pricy so do your homework. Get off the main drag for cheaper food. The seafood is charged by the weight so be careful."
,,Great place to spend and evening!,5.0,,"This place is buzzing with great restaurants, bars, boat trips, view points and, in the early evenings, really nice lighting. There are also fun fair rides and a giant bungee pod.

This is a good place to relax at the end of a hard working week."
,,Night life hub,5.0,,"Clarke quay is a night life hub in Singapore.
You will find pubs and bars here.
Pub/bar hopping is the best thing you can do here.
Loud music, lights, food, drinks and friends.. perfect evening.
It's filled with tourist and locals.
Enjoy the cool breeze and a chilled beer.
Loved the vibes here."
,,Great nightlife,5.0,,"We went out to Clarke Quay on a Thursday night and weren't sure what to expect, but it was absolutely packed. The bars were all heaving and the atmosphere was great. We particularly liked the Scottish bar which was free to enter and showed live music then had a DJ later on."
,,A great place to be.,4.0,,We were staying at Clarke Quay at the Park Regis hotel. Clarke Quay is great for bars and restaurants. So much choice. What ever your tastes Clarke Quay can accomodate you fully. It is a pricier place to visit as it is so popular with people. There is always a vibrant buzz especially in the evening and can get very busy at weekends. Very colourful at night. Worth taking a boat trip along the the river with a camera. Well worth visiting.
,,Great place to catch a cruise!,4.0,,"We were here during the day so it was rather tame, but is surely hopping at night. We caught a Singapore River Cruise from here. The downside of Clarke Quay was that we were hassled by touts there more than anywhere else in Singapore."
,,Fabulous vibe!!!,5.0,,There are many restaurants and bars on the Quay for you to select from or can do a bit of a bar hopping which we did one evening. It is also lovely to just walk along the Quay and enjoy the vibe... There are little bridges and quiet areas to sit and enjoy an ice cream!! There is an ice cream vendor - a Turkish Ice cream cart - worth watching his display!! It is quite an entertaining the way he serves his ice creams!!!
,,Great Night life!,5.0,,This place is a thing of beauty with all lights on! A must visit while you are in Singapore to enjoy the night life and vibrant nature of the city.
,,Must visit,4.0,,"A must visit heaps of bars and restaurants. Can catch a bum boat from this location. Wear some comfy shoes. If you are more adventurous has a reverse bungee jump,good luck."
,,Great for nightlife,5.0,,"So many things going on here. From the giant bungee swing thing, to river roar cruises, bars, restaurants and nightlife. Clarke Quay is the place to head in Singapore for some nightlife."
,,Come for the nightlife,5.0,,"This place is pumping at night!
You have plenty of bars & restaurants to choose from and it’s easy to get to via the MRT!
We came here a few times during our singapore trip as it was so close to our hotel and were never disappointed.
We drank, we ate and we even got to enjoy the live bands and cuban dancers!
Definitely recommend adding this to your list if you ever in singapore!"
,,nightlife,5.0,,everything you would want is here eating clubs happy hours live entertainment a very vibrant place to people watch have a few beers or just watch the boats going up and down the river but be warned this is a very expensive city so work out how much you think you will need and double it
,,Lots of options,4.0,,"Clark Quay is a good place to visit on the weekends, as there are a lot of places to eat and drink.

It is a bit expensive and a worthwhile place to visit, as it has a great atmosphere/vibe -not for those who prefer a bit of peace and quiet (visit during the day as it not as hectic).

Have a meal near the water and enjoy."
,,Best place to be seen on a Friday night.,4.0,,The number of bars and establishments that offer nocturnal entertainment makes this area the best place to spend a Friday night with friends and fellow visitors to Singapore. Be sure to enjoy Tiger Beer in the area as there are promos or freebies being given to lucky patrons.
,,Many options,4.0,,Nice place with several excellent options of food. You can have a nice steak or a chili crab! Also Brazilian churrascaria and Spanish Tapas are options available. Beside the river is nice.
,,More Than O Quay,4.0,,This is a great place to go for food and entertainment. The quay is loaded with places to eat with indoor and outdoor dining. Plenty of pubs so you can watch a game on TV. Several places also had live music to listen to. Most of the area is covered from the rain and sun. You can also get a boat ride on the river if you like or your kids can play with the water fountain. At night there are also several clubs to go to.
,,Gone downhill by going upmarket!,2.0,,"This place used to be so good to visit with many hawker stalls, lots of sateh, market stalls, even an Indian Elvis! Now all that has gone and there is just a group of overpriced noisy restaurants."
,,SO Lively,5.0,,Yes...its so lively and food lovers gathered beside the river and had their foods and gossiping.Must visit to there.
,,Amazing place amazing food,5.0,,This place has a nice and cozy ambiance and the food was served in big portions. The Chinese cuisines here are awesome!
,,Great for sightseeing,3.0,,"The last I was here was probably 15 years ago! Clarke Quay is mostly about two things, strolling along the river and food. My favourite thing to do at this place is of coz strolling along the river and sitting along the river. The nearby shopping mall are Clarke Quay Central and Liang Court. Eventhough they have a lot of restaurant and cafe along the river, there aren't many restaurant that cater for muslim (halal food), so its quiet difficult for a muslim to dine in at this area. Clarke Quay offer a river cruise along the river. Eventhough its quiet expensive, its worthed to try."
,,It's party time,5.0,,"People who love to party... This is it. Has a huge list of restraunts and pubs, live music, you will be never thrown out for choices, this place can give you what you want. You can hop restraunt and party till 1 am on a weekday. This place has a very positive vibe."
,,Not an afternoon spot,4.0,,"We went in the afternoon and while it is a nice area, not much going on in the day. Would need to go back in the evening. Close to MRT, so easy to get to. Also walking distance to Chinatown."
,,Great choice,5.0,,Could not wish for a better choice of restaurants and bars in or one place. Clean safe and easily accessed. Highly recommend..
,,Great place for meals and entertaiment,4.0,,"If you're wanting to experience modern Singapore, then Clarke Quay is the place to be. Do not come here if you want to see historical singapore. The quay has many restaurants and bars to enjoy a good night out. I cycled here on a saturday morning, and it was fantastic. Came back in the wee hours and the place was well and alive. Prices, as expected, for a night out is on the dearer side."
,,Awesome location,5.0,,"Spent 6 nights staying here. The location is awesome. So close to restaurants, bars and public transport. Well worth the stay."
,,Dining and entertainment spot,4.0,,"Another historic wharf turned into a dining and entertainment spot. There is a lot more going on here than at Boat Quay, with much nicer restaurant and shopping options."
,,Tourist trap,3.0,,"Clarke Quay is your typical waterfront tourist trap with none of the charm of a place such as San Antonio. The brightly painted colorful buildings evoke images of Malay/Indian areas like Hajj Street and Bo-Kaap in Cape Town, but have none of the authentic charm.

There's a slew of bars, restaurants and clubs that cater to wealthy tourists, expats and those of their ilk with prices and options to match that clientele. I might have liked this 15 years ago, but it did very little for me."
,,Singapore’s Soho!,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is the best place in Singapore for a night out! Sort of the Soho of Singapore! With loads of restaurants and bars this place is colourful, vibrant and full of life!"
,,Fun and fiesty,4.0,,Lots of fun bats and restaurants to visit here. Afternoon into night as the sun is setting to get a seat and have a few sundowners.
,,Very good place for a night out by riverside,4.0,,Nice place to do pub hopping. This place is very lively in the evening with spectacular light displays. You can enjoy your dinner in one of the riverside restaurants. One of the starting point for River cruise is Clarke Quay. You will find live music in plenty.
,,Awesome place,5.0,,This is a great place for an afternoon or evening drink. Loads to do and see with some fantastic photo opportunities .
,,Lovely ambiance,4.0,,We went this place one night on our stay in Singapore. The night lights are so beautiful. There was music and dance all over. We really had a nice time. A must see at night.
,,lovely place to spend an evening,4.0,,"Situated on the side of the river Clark Quay is packed with bars and restaurants , so may places to eat and drink you can come back every night for something different , just a great place to relax and take in the atmosphere, we also took a river cruise one night which was very good"
,,My favourite place in Singapore,5.0,,"I love Clarke quay!
It has everything - shopping amazing restaurants , great bars atmosphere and pretty lights !
We came here our first night and brought friends back the second night - we lived it so much !!
Many choices for food , fabulous atmosphere and set on the beautiful water
Just stunning !!"
,,A must-visit for live music and nightlife,5.0,,"We were blown away with how many great bars with live music there were at Clarke Quay and will certainly be back again next time we’re in Singapore. There’s something for everyone in a great setting along the canal/river which is still compact enough that you can wander past just about all of the dozens of bars before settling on your favourite. Alternatively, spend the entire night doing a bar crawl and checking out the music!

The area draws a really eclectic mix of people of all ages and with different interests. You can go proper clubbing or you can just as easily sit at an Irish pub and listen to some classic pub tunes.

Most places are open until the early hours of the morning, so visiting Clarke Quay is something you can do without any trouble if you’ve got a dinner reservation elsewhere in the city.

It’s highly recommended for anyone visiting Singapore!"
,,So many food options,5.0,,"Personally I think a great choice of location for dinner out. Super easy to get to from the MRT station and so much variety.

Can choose something with a view over the water or inside the covered area for people watching.

Was here during one of the football matches and they had a large screen playing this for those who don’t want to miss out."
,,Wonderful for a night out,5.0,,"Great bars, fantastic vibe, live music, good food. Seems to attract a younger crowd. It gets really busy so come early to book a spot at your favorite place."
,,Haven for Food,4.0,,Clarke Quay riverside is quite busy in evenings with variety of food joints and bars. You may find all global dishes but prices are bit expensive. Some of the bars and pubs are really noisy where as you can find place for nice evening cozy dinner as well. Very well maintained!
,,Decent food offerings,3.0,,"I came by excited to visit the Japanese supermarket only to find out (from the concierge) that they had closed...nooo.
But the locks of love event was going on and I was able to get a free lock by just flashing my passport at the concierge services.
The food offerings didn't entice me too much (especially since hawker centers are only a few MRT stops away!)
The view from outside the mall in front of the water was lovely though! Gotta get a picture of those colorful houses. I didn't stay around too long for the night scene to come alive."
,,Lovely place for dinner and hanging out,5.0,,"The place is on a lake and full of restaurants. All restaurants are good and the service is excellent. Try the crab, it is an experience by itself."
,,Mostly Restaurants and Bars,4.0,,We were staying at The Park Avenue Suites which are a few minutes away from Clarke Quay area. During the day you can have a lovely stroll along the river most of the people you see around are tourists here for the River Cruises which are lovely. At night there is a totally different vibe as all the lights come on and the Bars and Restaurants in the area come alive again a lot of the people are foreigners living or visiting Singapore. As you'd expect most of the restaurants and bars are expensive but if you just wanna get some drinks sometimes they have great deals.
,,Absolute let down,1.0,,"What an absolute let down of a place. It’s full of restaurants and bars but not in a good way. The place is overpriced, all the bars having their own music and you’re lost in too many different musics and food is just not good"
,,Great food and drinks,5.0,,This is a fantastic place at night for dinner and drinks. It has some fantastic restaurants right on the river and also has a great variety of different food options. Cool bars too!
,,Party place nr 1 in Singapore,5.0,,"A lot of pubs, seats both inside and outside...a lot of people every day in the evening.
Take a «taxi boat» from the Marina Bay and up to Clarke Quay, a nice trip.
This is not a cheap area....as almost everything in Singapore but it’s worth it.
Have fun, party on"
,,Awesome place to visit!,5.0,,"Riverfront walk with old and new structures, many pubs and eateries, hotels...visit at night when the area comes alive with locals and tourists alike, great atmosphere and fun for all!"
,,Singapore's entertainment capital - Clarke Quay,4.0,,"top entertainment venue in Singapore. this area probably has the most number of venues providing live music entertainment.

there are a big range of musical genres and some of my favourites will have to be Crazy Elephant, (IMHO the blues rock capital of Singapore), Le Noir, Pump room, McGettigan's.

there is a range of local and international cuisine to tinkle our taste buds.

situated next to the river, there is a beautiful walk under blinking lights in the evening. in the day, it is still a lovely place, walking under the alien like canopy.

as this is a touristy area, do know that the prices will not be cheap. however, this is the biggest collective of entertainment, drinks and food, with plenty of human traffic and party vibes.

let us not forget that Zouk is also now located here - the #1 party disco venue in town, graced by some of the best DJs in the region.

come and taste Singapore's entertainment at her finest."
,,Lively part of the city,4.0,,"During the day this is a great place for a stroll and watch the world go by, admiring the different varieties of boats on the water. Plenty of bars and restaurants overlook the water giving great options for a relaxing drink. In the evening, especially at the weekend, the place turns into a really lively spot packed with people. With the lighting on the surrounding buildings the atmosphere is totally different but despite the crowds still feels welcoming and safe. If you’re looking for somewhere central to pass some relaxing time then it’s certainly worth coming past here."
,,A Stark contrast,5.0,,"My auntie used to stay here in one of the old shop houses in the 1970s to 1080s. I still remember visiting her in those days, when the river was infested with rubbish and bum boats, transporting goods in and out of Singapore.

As I visited these days, it is so much different compared to those days. The river has been cleared up and the warehouses and shop houses are now lined up with upscale restaurants and bars.

A stark difference to the olden days."
,,I heart clarke quay,5.0,,"If youre all about the nightlife n goin out, this place is the bomb, good food good nightclubs and wicked lights, also during the day its pretty kool to see the river and checkout the views"
,,Always a fun place.,4.0,,"Whenever we come to Singapore, we will visit Clarke Quay at least once for a meal and to watch the world go by. The many bars and restaurants are always popular, and the food is good."
,,Touristy,3.0,,"We stayed in the Novotel Clark Quay and were extremely pleased with the hotel and the location. Clark Quay is an extremely lively colection of bars and restaurants which are installed in the old wharf buildings. However, these bars and restaurants are very touristy and don’t really reflect any of rhe local culture. They also seemed to be very expensive. The Quay is well worth a visit for a cold drink as it is the complete opposite to the gleaming, modern, Singapore. Visit then go elsewhere for a decent meal."
,,Don't think we saw it at its best,3.0,,Plenty of restaurants and shops all after your custom. Think it would be better at night (based on other reviews) but we ran out of time :o(
,,Clarke Quay,4.0,,"Getting to Clarke Quay by train is easy, Get off the MRT at Raffles Place (we found that best). Initially we were going to get a river cruise around the waterway but as it wasn't leaving for 15 minutes we decided to do a bit of walk around, we ended up walking all the way around. The food shops alone the south bank are great, there is a wide variety of foods and you can sit overlooking the river and have a bite to eat with a drink, very relaxing. Walking further along the south bank cross over one of the bridges and on the north side there are some interesting building Parliament House, Concert Centre, Museums etc. Crossing over Anderson Bridge walk along Fullerton Road see the Merlion and then have a walk through the Fullerton Hotel (public access is OK. mmmm if only I could afford to stay there). After doing the walk around we decided there no need to catch the river cruise so had a great lunch at a restaurant and enjoyed the view."
,,Nightlife,5.0,,A great place to relax in the evening in one of the bars or restaurants. MRT for Clarke Quay is easily accessible.
,,"Clarke Quay - an evening, unforgetable",5.0,,Clarke Quay is a beautiful contrast between old European styled mansions and sky kissing high rise buildings. The promenade is encouraging. Lots of restaurants are there to offer dishes. Specially crab fried with pepper was fabulous!
,,Good place to chill,4.0,,"One of the best places of Singapore to chill and enjoy night life with pub, discos , restaurants, boat ride and bars . Must go place if you are in Singapore"
,,Clarke Quay,4.0,,"This place place is one of the famous areas in singaphore and It called Clarke Quay
because was named after Sir Andrew Clarke, Singapore's second Governor and Governor of the Straits Settlements from 1873 to 1875, who played a key role in positioning Singapore as the main port for the Malay states of Perak, Selangor and Sungei Ujong. This area are five blocks of restored warehouses house various restaurants and nightclubs. There are also moored Chinese junks (tongkangs) that have been refurbished into floating pubs and restaurants. This area fantastic for eating because variety of cusines with cool night life.Also, there are cool shopping mall in this area. you must see.

,"
,,Plenty of Food Options but Very Loud,4.0,,A really good selection restaurants and bars to choose from that will satisfy any appetite - most places are pretty expensive and drinks are very pricey for what you get. The place is very busy one the evening gets going and can be very loud as most places have live music blasting from open stages / areas. Plenty of places to catch a cab and a nice walk or place to take a cruise around the bay.
,,Full of life,4.0,,"This place is where all the night time life is, it gets very busy, but is a great scene, tons of restauramts and bars."
,,Great night life,4.0,,"This was a great place to have a few drinks if your into nightlife.
The drinks weren’t cheap- about $15 a cocktail and the same for a beer. $45 for 5 tiger beers which is pretty steep.
I would recommend a snack and one drink if your on a budget just for the atmosphere. The lights and the river boats create a really nice vibe."
,,City night spot,4.0,,"Nothing happens here during the day but at night its full of bars, clubs, ice cream parlours and ok food. Happy hour is popular due to price of drink. The night we were here was the festiival of fun which passed a couple of hours"
,,Quay experience,5.0,,It’s a one of a kind unique place. A must visit. It has grown dramatically over the years. Guys don’t miss it if you’re coming to Singapore
,,Nice,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a riverside shopping and leisure complex area located in downtown Singapore. It has Singapore’s most exciting nightlife scenes. Nearby you can find pedestrian mall, Singapore River, Asian Civilizations Museum, The G-Max Reverse Bungy, Art-2 Gallery Singapore and Fort Canning Park. It is 8 min walk from Philatelic Museum. Clarke Quay was named after Singapore's second Governor (1873 to 1875), Sir Andrew Clarke."
,,A must for Indians,5.0,,"Open air buffet, lots of cuisines. Indian food is available. Near to singapore river ~ you can take a boat ride as well . Night life is good . I love this place ."
,,Relaxing,5.0,,"By day it is such a relaxing place. You can just have a seat somewhere, eating your snacks and watching boats at the river. At night a crowded place especially for tourists who seek fun and night life at the bars."
,,Night life hub,3.0,,Lots of restaurants and noisy bars. Very crowded during the week end. Quality is fine. Just too noisy
,,Experience the Singaporean Night Life,3.0,,"Went here together with my sister, and her friend. It is the place to be if you want to experience the good o'l life after an exhausting day since it is the ""party place"" of Singapore. Various activities can also be done here (aside from being merry while getting drunk) which we didn't try since we went here at night time.

We just tried its ""Happy Hour"" thing.

Anyway, just find an establishment suitable for what you're looking for to ensure that you will go home happy, and satisfied for what you had ordered, and for the money you spent."
,,If You Cant Find A Place To Eat Here....,4.0,,"A really neat pedestrian friendly area full of restaurants and bars. I was surprised that i could not even find one souvenir shop here but once i found it was a great place for restaurants, my husband and i returned for a really nice dinner. While the prices are a bit on the higher side, if you consider where you are and you have a leisurely dinner on one of the outside patios (hopefully you will hear some live music nearby), you should be pretty happy here. We were here on a weekend and because there are so many restaurants, none of them were too crowded that we couldn't get a table right away, so you have lots of choices."
,,Nightlife,4.0,,"I was here on a Sunday afternoon and it was calm, but you can tell there is a lot of nightlife here. They have enormous shade structures and misters to keep it cool. Bright colorful buildings. Not much to do, but eat and club, but it had a cool vibe."
,,Lots of Restaurants to Choose From,3.0,,"We decided to visit area for an evening meal.Plenty to choose from and alot of places have happy hour deals with cheaper drink prices etc. Vietnam restaurant we visited had 50% off beer ,wine and cocktails till 9pm.Not the cheapest area to eat and a bit too touristy for us but pleasant by the
river.Might be bit expensive especially later in the evening."
,,"A Hoping Location for Restaurants, Bars & Cafes",4.0,,"The Clarke Quay area is pretty sleepy during the day except for the river cruises that run throughout the day. There are two different companies that operate the river cruise tours. Both do a very good job. At night the area comes to life with many restaurant, bars and cafes. The LED lighting domes that line the walkways are beautiful to see at night. The riverside seating pods are in need of refurbishment and are breaking apart and outdated.

BOTTOM LINE: Except for taking a river cruise during the day, nighttime is where the action is here. Their are some nice restaurants here in the area. The riverside pods need replaced. The area is easy to catch a taxi throughout the day. MY RATING: 7/10"
,,Amazing at night,5.0,,"Very amazing entertainment at night. My favorite Friday and Saturday night is very buzzing... Many food, bar, cafe. Enjoy the night with beautiful girl. Eat at restaurant on edge of river. The light show is great."
,,Clarke Quay - Great Entertainment location.,5.0,,"Our hotel was close to Clarke Quay, and we spend a few evenings at Clarke Quay for dinner. great location to spend the evening, with many food and drink establishments. There are several river tour options available....consider the evening laser show tour which takes you to the harbour to view the show."
,,Interesting but not cheap,3.0,,"We went to Clarke Quay on three nights of our stay in Singapore.

The location is great and it really comes alive at night, there are so many places to eat and drink.

It is your typical tourist trap where the prices are elevated but for a few extra bucks, the ambiance and atmosphere is worth it.

The are heaps of restaurants out in the open on both sides of the river with quite a lot of cuisines to chose from .. if you don't want to eat, it is great to have a few drinks and just chill out.

It is within walking distance of most hotels and worth a visit.

The best nights are Friday and Saturday when it is really buzzing ... just sit and watch the light show."
,,Not for daylight,3.0,,I assume this is meant to only be visited at night. Next to nothibg was open during the afternoon. We were pushed to even get a can of softdrink. Boat cruise kiosk luckily had drinks for sale.
,,Excellent area to stay,5.0,,We loved this area. This was where our hotel was located. A wonderful area to dine and beautiful riverfront.
,,Lively Quarter,5.0,,Very crowded evenings. But nice decorations and light. You can do some attractions (some bungee swing). Beer is expensive as usual. Many clubs here.
,,Clarke Quay is a good starting point to walk along the Singapore River,5.0,,"Starting from Clarke Quay, the walk along the Singapore River is a MUST. Aside from shopping, this walk has to rank among the top 3 things to do. Because:
1. It is easily accessible - MRT station = Clarke Quay.
2. A walk along the river covers many things; from Heritage Buildings; to Museums(eg museum of Asian Civilizations); to famous hotels(eg Fullerton Hotel); to famous sights(eg Merloin & Park); to shopping malls.. etc
3. The walk can be taken at night when the lights are varied and beautiful; or during the day when things are open.
4. It can be tailored to your time requirements - one hour or four.
5. Must see sights include: Clarke Quay's heritage buildings; Merloin; Museum of Asian Civilizations...
6. Refreshments are plentiful."
,,Where Asian meets European,3.0,,"Clarke Quay is where European culture meets Asia. You can drink German beer, eat English fish and chips and go for Italian pizza. But you’ll feel at home, and not at home all at the same time.

I ordered a stout in one bar - a popular English beer - and it was over-chilled and frankly not that nice.

Restaurants are relatively expensive, but this is the beating booming heart of tourist town - so what did you expect? And booming is the word because it’s super loud.

We ate inside an Indonesian restaurant one night, because I’d have needed ear defenders to sit outside. Lively, this area definitely is. If that isn’t your scene, try the nearby genteel Robertson Quay which feels more cafe culture than clubbing."
,,Must visit for night life in Singapore,4.0,,It is located besides Singapore rivers.maybe pubs and restaurants are present over here special for nightlife and which are open till early morning.river cruise can also be taken from here.
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"This seemed to be the most happening part of Singapore. There are pubs, bars, restaurants, you can choose what you like to do. Some bars also have live music. We visit on a Friday night and the atmosphere was really good. The food here is awesome, there is a wide variety you can choose from. This place has a really nice buzz and will not disappoint. There is also the Singapore river cruise which ends at the Merlion."
,,Interesting place for a stoll,5.0,,"This place is where Singapore comes alive. The river looks quite nice from evening till night. Come here enjoy a glass or two of beer, have dinner and take a long walk up to the Marina Bay."
,,Spore River,5.0,,"If you cant sleep you could just go here and stay for a while, enjoying some foods (so many foods here) and if you just want to kill some time you could just sit on the river bank and feel the wind. One thing that i like from Clarke Quay, this places is alive and dont sleep"
,,Alive and Loud,5.0,,For sure a place for someone who likes to sit in middle of lots of cafe and pubs and clubs and restaurants. Food is very good and many nice club around. Music and crowd is also very nice. Mostly teenagers and young people will love to visit it.
,,Still good place to be at,4.0,,"Just stayed near Clarke Quay recently after 20 years not being there, and although is looking tired its still great place to be at night..Good bars, good restaurants & just a great old vibe"
,,Great night life great food food great atmosphere,5.0,,"Great place to just walk around at night, plenty of restaurants and bars like everywhere in singapore felt totally safe and secure"
,,Clarke Quay @ Singapore,5.0,,"A riverside Quay in Singapore of historical significance. It is located in Singapore river planning area nearby MRT North East line station. Originally a commerce centre, currently a popular tourist spot and popular for large array of restaurants , bars, nightclubs along the river. Centre of Singapore nightlife.
There is large shopping mall in the vicinity. Also it is one of the boating terminals for Singapore river cruise. Evenings are beautiful with colourful illumination. Very picturesque !"
,,Great Singapore landmark,4.0,,"A pretty lively evening venue. As I came with my family, I avoided the bars and clubs, but still found it very enjoyable walking around the area. The buildings and evening lights make this place vibrant, and with the wide variety of food available, I'm sure you'll find something you fancy."
,,Nice area by river,3.0,,We got off the hop on hop off bus yellow line at Clark quay. Area has a great variety of restaurants however only a few are open for lunch. The river boats depart from Clark quay. This area is more vibrant after 5:00 pm as all the restaurant are open. Pretty area with a nice long walking path along the river.
,,Enjoy the views,4.0,,Rather than eat at Clarke Quay due to the expensive nature of the restaurants we used it as our main departure for our travels. The beauty is that there is a metro station there connecting you to Chinatown(1 stop away) and other major Singapore sights. We also used it to catch the river ferry which was definitely worth $25 for the 40 minute ride that showed you the length of the Waterfront right down to Marina Bay Sands. A nice place to stroll especially at night when it is lit up.
,,Birthday celebration,5.0,,"Jumbo Seafood, Clarke Quay. Excellent for pepper and chilli crabs. They always have a long line and wait for seating but they are very accommodating. We love sitting outside by the river when we eat our crabs. Service is very quick and businesslike, but some service staff are very friendly and will take time to answer questions. You have to pay the price for crabs but it is one experience you must enjoy in Singapore."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"We were expecting more to be going on but when we were there it was very quiet and most of the bars and restaurants were closed,it was a Sunday afternoon so perhaps that was why.There were some boats to take a trip along the river but most were half empty."
,,Lovely waterfront area full of life and action !!1,4.0,,Clarke Quay is a lovely waterfront area where one can see a lot of locals and tourists roaming around or enjoying meals or a cup of coffee by the several restaurants n coffee shops around. There are a few nice places to shop around as well. One can go for a lovely river cruise from here ! Loved the atmosphere here and the Cosmopolitan crowd from different nationalities blending in. The place looks especially beautiful by evening time and at night.
,,Very average,2.0,,"Completely dead during the day, despite most of the bars and restaurants being open. Nicely lit up at night with a central fountain which is good for kids to splash around in. The restaurants are obviously more expensive than equivalents elsewhere in Singapore as this is a major tourist trap. There really isn't anything to do apart from eating/drinking. The old warehouses that line the banks of the river have been nicely painted in different colours which really is not what they used to look like when this was a working area. The river is nice and clean and river cruises are quite popular. The most interesting part of this area are the several old bridges that cross the river. However, one short visit was enough. The whole area looks artificial."
,,Warning ⚠️,2.0,,"Please be aware when being approached at Clarke Quay Singapore riverfront restaurants, tourists are getting ripped off big times, always check your bill and ask questions when something is not adding up and enjoy 😉"
,,A good spot for shopping and eating,4.0,,A great array of all types of shop and eating places. Helpful staff and worth a visit if only to look.
,,Disappointing,1.0,,May be I was misinformed but I came expecting to see old warehouses and quaint restaurants. What I saw were old warehouses turned into trashy bars covered with plastic roofing and at 5pm it was dead. Cold and soul less.
,,"Nice spot, but expensive",4.0,,"A great spot to enjoy an evening drink along the river with so many places to choose from, meals here aren’t cheap but good quality eating places, shame it doesn’t open for Breakfast as would be nice spot to enjoy morning coffee"
,,Warning: Highly Addictive!,5.0,,"If repeat visits are the yardstick, Clarke Quay must be my personal #1 attraction in Singapore: I go there all the time. I took my Thai partner there once, and Nok insisted on returning every night. On our last visit, we were showing some American friends around SE Asia and took them to Clarke Quay on our second night; they insisted on returning every night after that. I and an American friend both stay at hotels close to Clarke Quay whenever we go to Singapore. I reviewed my pick--Park Hotel Clarke Quay—in TA a few years ago; he stays elsewhere, but addiction to Clarke Quay is the common driver for both our choices.

From Lighters to Lee: Once upon a time when Victoria reigned, deep-draught ships would arrive off Singapore laden with coals from Newcastle or what-have-you, and moor offshore. Flat-bottomed lighters would head out to the ships, take off their cargo, and scull up the shallow Singapore River to godowns (warehouses) where the cargo would be stored for transshipment. Lighters then sculled back with tea from China, cloves from the Indies and other outbound cargo to the ships. Godowns lined both banks of the river all the way up to Clarke Quay and beyond. The Chinese lightermen were the nexus between the godowns and the ships. Singapore godowns were the nexus beween the Yangtze and the Hooghly, Yokohama and Bombay, Asia and the West. I’ve seen black-and-white films of the lighters and bumboats on the Singapore River in the ‘20s, and the sheer level of activity is astonishing. But nothing lasts forever, and with the development of modern port facilities, deep-water vessels now load and unload cargos via cranes shoreside, while lighters, bumboats and riverside godowns were all rendered obsolete. “Thank heavens, about time” as far as aggressive real-estate developers were concerned, since that meant they could now demolish all the godowns and build prime-market riverfront high-rises like Maybank Tower in their place. But, as the wrecking balls moved inexorably upriver, the wise government of Lee Kwan Yew intervened. Prime Minister Lee always took the long view, and noted the unconstrained demoliton of Singapore’s historic areas with a jaundiced eye. His government mandated that the godowns of Clarke Quay should be restored, preserved, and converted to other commercial uses, and that construction on other quays along the river should reflect the unique historic architecture of the river-banks. After his retirement, rules were relaxed, but without Prime Minister Lee, there would be no Clarke Quay today.

Visually Stunning: Take one look at Clarke Quay today and it’s plain to see that Lee’s commendable goal of historic preservation has been substantially—what’s the nautical term?--chucked overboard, altered course, run aground?—something like that. But the good ship SS Clarke Quay hasn’t been entirely sunk: if you keep your eyes down and stare along the waterline, Clarke Quay does have the look and feel of those old godowns, even if the originals weren’t painted in pastel colours.

Hexa-functional Brollies: If you raise you eyes up to rooftop level, however, your view is dominated by a spectacular network of ultra-modern, gigantic, inter-connected umbrellas (I extolled their virtues in a TA review of Kuala Lumpur’s Chinatown a few years ago, where similar structures pale by comparison). Now, a proper British brolly is strictly single-purpose: it just keeps you dry when it rains. But an ombrelle in France had at least two raisons d'être: as a parapluie it (1) protects you from the rain, and as a parasol it (2) protects you from the sun’s heat. In the tropics, you’ll still see brollies used for both these reasons: try hiking around Jaipur or Bangkok in hot season, and you’ll start using one yourself. In the West, parasols were also once used because they (3) kept milady’s complexion as pale as possible. Having seen many a Western lass working on her tan in Miami, Copacabana, Bondi and Sentosa, I conclude the odds of any of them actually wanting snow-white complexions nowadays are considerably lower than the odds of their being addressed as “milady.” Still, throw it in and you’ve got a grand total of three functions.

Now, at Clarke Quay, those King Kong-sized umbrellas serve six—count ‘em—six different purposes:

(1) Keeping you dry: the brollies are right over the pedestrian walkways, and interconnect, so rainwater will flow from brolly to brolly and finally cascade into gutters that divert it away; hence, you can wander through Clarke Quay dry-shod in a monsoon deluge.
(2) Keeping you cool: between their cooling system and shade, the brollies can reduce Clarke Quay’s ambient temperatures by up to 4 degrees Celsius (7 Fahrenheit), quite useful if you arrive at 4:00 pm on a real scorcher.
(3) Keeping you enthralled: after sundown the brollies begin a fabulous light-show, slowly morphing from one colour to the next; there aren’t too many 100% free nightly light shows anywhere; Da Nang’s Dragon Bridge is the only serious competitor I can think of in Asia.
(4) Keeping you occupied: it’s hard to ignore the spectacular brollies by day, and impossible by night, so you’ll be occupied not only enjoying the fabulous light show, but taking vast numbers of selfies, groufies, or just photos and videos of the view. Pick your restaurant, order, and then start taking stills and videos. You won’t be twiddling your thumbs, checking your watch, drumming your fingers, and wondering “when oh when will they ever come out with my porridge?”
(5) Keeping you coming: yes, Clarke Quay is an upscale eating, drinking, and shopping complex, but Singapore has lots of similar complexes, including riverside ones on other quays, and depending on exactly what you want, Clarke Quay might not be the best place to go. But it’s so spectacularly beautiful and unique—thanks to the brollies—that you just prefer to keep coming back, which is critical for Clarke Quay management and vendors; and finally
(6) Keeping milady’s complexion as pale as possible, which may be an obsolete concept in the West, but is still very much alive and kicking in Asia, to the point that I once caught Nok actually under-packing for a flight to Rangoon (“good heavens, are you ill?”) only to see her a week later cramming that suitcase to the gills with thanaka for herself, her daugher and other ladies back in Thailand, where they can’t obtain the legendary Burmese paste (“oh, now I get it.”).

The Smorgasbord: Take your pick of Asian: Clarke Quay has Chinese, Indian and Malay (Indonesian) restaurants, as well as Japanese, Vietnamese, and Thai. Western choices include an Aussie seafood house, British and Irish pubs, a steakhouse, a Spanish tapas bar, German and Cuban restaurants, as well as more downscale taco joints, chicken wing joints, and many more that I didn’t mention. Oh yes, also lots of serious bars and other nightlife. I suspect a Clarke Quay location makes a restaurant or pub bit pricier than comparable establishments elsewhere in town (which is saying something, since Singapore is very expensive indeed compared to any other SE Asian capital) but I think you’re amply compensated by being here. And note: if you cross the Malacca Bridge to get to the right bank of the river, you’ll find another phalanx of restaurants, technically not part of Clarke Quay, but affording a better view if you can get an outdoor table: one of them is my standby, Breworkz. (They’ve decided to make the Malacca Bridge Read, but so far the bridge is still illiterate, so I still call it Malacca).

Entertainment Roulette: Sorry, Can’t Hear a Word You’re Saying: There’s a stage in the center of Clarke Quay where you can hear live music, as well as impromptu street musicians working from the opposite bank or playing from the middle of the bridge. The music’s a bit of a roulette wheel spin: sometimes you get a real winner; other times it’s not your cup of tea, and skull-splitting to boot. One time, a rock band at Clarke Quay was so loud that my waitress couldn’t hear my order: what made this memorable, was that I wasn’t even AT Clarke Quay—I was upriver at the far end of Richardson Quay! If you suffer from tinnitis you might want to carry along some ear-plugs. Despite that occasional nuisance, however, I can’t imagine our ever going to Singapore without spending at least one night at Clarke Quay, even during the wet season. Five stars of course! (see Clarke Quay by Day, Clarke Quay by Night, and Malacca Bridge photos)."
,,Touristy Stuff,3.0,,"It's a charming little area with restaurants right along the water and the skyscrapers lining the opposite riverbank, but it's super touristy. Food is expensive. Worth a walk-through, though, even if---like me---you enjoy the vibe and ambiance of more authentic neighborhoods."

,,Choose the side of the river in the shade,3.0,,"Our biggest mistake about walking along the river esplanade was walking on the side that was in full sun with practically no shade or relief from the heat, instead we needed to cross over the river from Fort Canning Park and walk next to Boat Quay which looked more interesting in regards to shops and cafes."
,,Fun place,5.0,,Lots of clubs and restaurants. You also can get the boat ride from Clarke quay. A fun place to go especially for the young.

,,An Amazing Vibrant Part of Singapore never to be missed,5.0,,"This is one of the most vibrant locations in Singapore. Packed with restaurants and bars and majority of them have entertainment in some form, be it a band, solo performance. Then there is the funny Turkish ice-cream man.

,,Good for hang out,5.0,,"Great for hangout and connected by metro for commute.
U can enjoy the open air places for food and drinks. Boat Cruise is available which is costly but worth enjoying. Plan to visit after the sunset as views are amazing and spectacular.

,,Touristy,3.0,,"This seems to be the place for all tourists to go at night.. lots of bars and restaurants to suit all palettes.. however, it was all a bit touristy and one couldn't get over the feeling of being over-charged and taken for a ride. Not the best experience."
,,A Cultrual Experience!,4.0,,"This place was a little overwhelming with the crowds... but that's to be expected! They had some good restaurant options for those who aren't feeling in the mood to find a local joint or a ""diamond in the rough"". Probably the best deal you can get in this area is the Shawarma place in there. It was a sandwich and two beers for less that 20 bucks, great deal.

Also had a great live concert series there too! It's just a fun place to hang out for awhile."
,,Good to walk around at any time,4.0,,Clarke Quay continues to expand a get more and more restaurants and shops. Very enjoyable just to walk around and enjoy the river.

,,Entertainment and Food galore,5.0,,"This place has everything: restaurants for every food, music, street players, river cruises, TV’s to watch those special sporting events.

The surroundings at night are very appealing with the bright lights everywhere.

Not far away is Boat Quay which adds to the variety.

Great spot nonetheless with a nice relaxed feel."
,,It’s ok,3.0,,We visited during the day so it was very quiet. There are so many bars and restaurants to choose from. We had some nice light lunch in a Thai bar. You can tell it gets busy at night though and the alcohol offers everywhere suggest the type of crowd it may attract. Worth a visit but it’s definitely not my favourite place in Singapore.
,,walking and boar Ride,5.0,,"A happening place where you can spend time from Evening to late night.

,,Great energy & Vibe,5.0,,Yes it might be touristy but it’s still one of those places you end up on a night out. Great bars and clubs. Lots of eating options too. If you’re up for a lively & fun night then it’s the place to be. Prive Bar - outdoor seating has a great view for people watching. Cuba libre if you’re up for something a little different - great band and dancing shoes is a must.

,,Singapore trip 2018,5.0,,We wine and dine at Clarke Quay had a good time night life was great after day time touring.. our hotel is a block away from Clarke Quay so many different restaurants around Clarke Quay along the river side very close to marina sand bay..

This area is beautiful, even at night"
,,Great restaurant variety,5.0,,Clarke Quay is an interesting collection of restaurants and bars along the river. You can find almost any kind of food you are looking for along with live music. Several restaurants have very pleasant seating along the river for a nice evening meal. It is over priced but the ambiance is what you are paying for.
,,Historic Quay,4.0,,"The Quay is famous for its stunning waterside restaurants and exciting collection of bars and clubs, probably more suited to a younger generation than us oldies. It's still a nice area to stroll and enjoy, but other than the Singapore River, our interests centered on the cultural and historic attractions nearby. There are a number of older buildings with the former Central Fire Station a stand-out. Singapore skillfully blend the historic with the modern."
,,Simply fabulous!!!,5.0,,"Clarke’s Quay ... fantastic area , great bars & restaurants, some we’re doing deals . Food and drink . And live entertainment ,and a good vibe to the area , and the hop on , off bus . Great way to see city and cheep , taxis were inexpensive as well. We stopped at Swisshotel merchant which was a perfect position . Friendly staff .good clean rooms. Strongly recommended. Chow Jon . Ali"
,,Clarke Quay,3.0,,Clarke Quay is mainly for Western tourists. It's a get away to relax in a more Western-style atomosphere but yet with an Asian flair. If you are not into the 'touristy' thing then this is not the place for you.
,,Incredible,5.0,,"What can you say about Clark quay ?, the sheer choice of bars and restaurant is incredible, I can spend a good hour, trying to decide where to eat, because of so many good places to choose from, and the quality of the food is amazing, the atmosphere and backdrop to this venue is also quite magical, a must visit , when in Singapore"

,,A fun area for a night out,4.0,,"Visited during night. A fun area for dinner/drinks. Eat and drink by the river. People watch, go dancing, by some stuff you don't really need (or do)."
,,"A must place to visit, but expensive",4.0,,"This is a great place to visit and you should be sure to go there when in Singapore. The nightlife is great, and a stroll through in the early evening see's it coming to life.
There are restaurants a plenty, but they're on the costly side, and some aren't that good a quality."
,,Food by the river,4.0,,"Good place to walk around in the evening and explore. We had food by the river in one of the restaurant there. Overall good, however the food was expensive compared to other places in Singapore."
,,New waterfront,3.0,,"As I came to Singapore a few years ago, I didn’t remake this place. So, I suppose that this is a newly created tourist attraction. There are many restaurants and bars along the quay. You can also take a boat for sightseeing."
,,Vibrant and lively,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is a vibrant and lively place by night.
It has lots of bars, cafes and restaurants. This is where it all happens in Singapore - as it is an entertainment hot spot.

By day it is a fairly quiet area. The buildings have been tastefully painted and are colourful.

I think it is worth visiting the area for the experience. You will be spoiled for choice as there are many eating places."
,,Nice to look at But,2.0,,The colourful buildings and boat like awnings look great but in my opinion hide a general running down of an area that was special but needs to start trying again. We were disappointed.
,,Nightlife in Singapore,4.0,,A very vibrant area but just for restaurants and bars. Good for a walk around by the water but mainly at night its just for eating and drinking. Lots of choice of place to eat and crowds of people.
,,Party Destination,4.0,,"The liveliest nightlife spot in Singapore with number of night clubs, live band, restaurants, cafes and bars. Best place for drinking and dining. River boat dining is also an option here. It was fun to go back to our hotel on the Trishaw."
,,Colourful night view,4.0,,"Good for a night stroll, lots of restaurants and clubs along the river. Colourful night view good for taking pictures. Convenient and easily accessible by MRT."
,,Highly recommended place for a visit,4.0,,"There are lots of shops and restaurants nearby. What I like the most is the colorful buildings and architecture nearby. I particular like the vibrant colors of pink, yellow, blue etc. especially with the windows. It’s brings out different vibe about this place. Lots of bars, music at night and it’s by the river walk"
,,"All you need Restaurants, Clubs, and Cafes",4.0,,"A modern place that have restaurants, Cafes, and Clubs. the start of the beauty begin after 5 pm. also you can enjoy a boat trip on the river to have a closer look to Marina Bay Sands and Singapore skyscraper."

,,Place to be on a weekend!!!,4.0,,"A must visit for people travelling to Singapore. Amazing bars right along the riverbelt. This was my third visit to Singapore and couldn’t have completed my trip without a visit on a Friday night at Clarke quay. Enjoy a nice drink and some good music, would recommend people to visit Clarke quay during late. evenings if u guys love to party."
,,Great place for a spot of lunch with a view,5.0,,The numerous eateries along this historic quay on the Singapore River make it an ideal spot for a leisurely al fresco lunch while enjoying views of the city. It was quiet when we visited for a lateish lunch mid-week but is probably heaving in the evenings and at weekends. The choice of food is huge - from English pub to typically Singaporean - and you’re sure to find something to satisfy both you and your budget.
,,Needs an ipgrafe,3.0,,"I last visited Clarke Quay in 2006 and not much has changed. I caught the MRT there for lunch, however, lots of the restaurants and bars open for the evening. Clarke Quay is a unique, conserved historical landmark located along the Singapore River. Great to catch a ‘bum boat’ river cruise and at night admire the large colourful umbrellas that cover the restaurants."
,,Fun place with lots of options,5.0,,Eating and entertainment every direction in a very enjoyable setting. I will definitely return the next time I am in Singapore.
,,Mirror of night life at Singapore,5.0,,"The place is a must watch if someone enjoys night life, lights, songs and partying.. Not sure how popular it is for tourists, but if someone has time should visit and take a glimpse of the flamboyant night life at Simgapore..."
,,Lively evenings,5.0,,Perfect area for some eating and drinking on weekdays. It has loads of live bands so its ends up in a mix. Good bar and good restaurant. Nice are to walk in. But be aware that service and food take time
,,"Lively place - bars, food, music and clubs",4.0,,"Clarke quay is in the centre of Singapore by the water. We went twice in the evening and it is an extremely lively place with parades of bars with live music, food and drinks. Lots of people, lots of noise and fun. If you like enjoying restaurants, bars, live music, drinking, and a late night it is highly recommended."
,,Must-visit in singapore,5.0,,"You can experience internationalized nightlife because almost every single one of foregin travellers gathers and hangout, with a number of local singaporians. Reverse-bungee is a bonus for adrenaline-pumping, I recommend to try this with a bit drunken state. With the help of a little alcohol, doubled-up excitement of course too much drunken will be problematic such as vomiting afterwards"
,,Chill and relax,4.0,,"Chill and relax after long business meeting or hectic day. Good food outlets, nice open ambience deals on drinks though beer seems everybody's favorite."
,,Nice mix of fun and romance,4.0,,"This place is pretty interesting and offers not only a walk by the river side, a view of the ferrys on the river, a dinner by river side, but also offers a huge bunch of bars and restaurants that are buzzing in the night."
,,Clarke Quay Singapore,4.0,,Lovely for an evening stroll by the river which you can walk all the way to Boat Quay.. Lots of restaurants to catch a bite or drinks but price are quite pricey... worth to explore if you are first time to Singapore..
,,Real Singapore or Commercialised Singapore ?,4.0,,"Enjoyed our visit to Clarke Quay and certainly an abundant and varied offering of restaurants, cafes, night clubs and bars. The colonial architecture is incredibly interesting however you have to look past 21st century signage. Well worth a visit to explore Clarke Quay and what it has to offer."
,,Vibrant social area,5.0,,"Conveniently accessible via public transport, this area is a social hub for visitors & locals. Sporting many popular restaurants, bars, & cafes, this location, while busy during the day, comes alive at night. Many options to choose from. Take time to wander around & see what is available. There is something to suit all tastes & price ranges. Highly recommended."
,,Commercialised eating drinking night club area.,4.0,,"Disappointing spoilt colonial area. Very commercialised westernised restaurants. Worth a walk through and stop for a drink, but far better quality restaurants elsewhere in Singapore."
,,This place has everything,5.0,,"Whether you are after a quiet drink, a nice meal or some live music you will find it here. The number of quality restaurants and bars is amazing. From fine dining to finger food you will find it here. About 8pm the live music starts which is not to loud to not be able to enjoy your dinner and conversation.
Also there are numerous outdoor waterfront dining options, this place is great."
,,Obligatory,5.0,,"Clark Quay is a must visit place in Singapore. Lots to do and see there and there is bound to be something for everyone, if not, you can always say you've been there. There are quite a number of worse places you can visit."
,,Spoilt for choice,4.0,,"A concentrated block of tourist-oriented restaurants and night spots. Don't look for bargains, or even fine cuisine, but if you are looking for lots of music and party vibe, look no further."
,,Nice Atmosphere,4.0,,"We visit during a weekday's night and it seems better than in weekend as the place was not too crowded with people. There are lots of choice for bar, pubs and restaurant, with all types of cuisine that you can choose. Good for a beer and bites but cannot expect to have engaged service as everything need to move fast."
,,A taste of Singapore’s nightlife,5.0,,Clarke Quay is certainly the best place to see and experience the nightlife in Singapore. Countless bars and clubs in one big area. Bar hopping is possible. We enjoyed Clarke Quay. It did not disappoint.
,,Don’t go during the day as everything is closed.,2.0,,We had heard that Clarke Quay was a great place to visit but we were not told to only go at night. Pretty much all of the restaurants are closed until 12pm and they are expensive. There is not much else to do before that....More
,,Place is good but not value for money,2.0,,This is like. The most expensive street in Singapore to visit for night life. Night life here is very expensive not value for. Money. Would rather suggest some local places for beers and food. They shut lal food orders by 1030. Very average for the...More
,,"Crass, loud and tacky",2.0,,"This place has gone more feral since I last visited it, many years ago. Bars and food outlets that could be in any down market tourist strip, pretty much anywhere in the western world. Expensive and very, very average. No doubt appeals to some because...More"
,,Place to go drinking at night,3.0,,"Very busy in the evening time, lots of bars trying to compete. We actually enjoyed it more from a little across the river having a beer from the 7-11."
,,"Cool at night, boring in the day",3.0,,"In the daytime it’s pretty boring and overpriced, but at night it gets much better and more lively. Good to kill time but wouldn’t necessarily be the first thing that comes to mind when I would recommend in Singapore."
,,Lively area,4.0,,At night this place can be loud and busy. Plenty of eateries and bars but nicer to have a stroll and look rather than sit and get your ears pounded with competing outlets. Worth a look and great for a lively evening but not if...More

,,Sights and shopping,5.0,,"We stayed at the Novotel Clarke Quay which we found to be an excellent location. Close by to the MRT which is the best way to access Gardens By The Bay and watch the light show at night.
The hop on hop off bus is only a 10 min walk away and is a good way to get to Little India,China Town and a number of great shopping places such as Orchard Road.
Clarke Quay also has good shopping and a huge array of food outlets and bars which are spread out along the river.
Would recommend the food court in Liang Square next to the Novotel for a variety of dishes at much cheaper prices,and you can get a cold beer here as well."
,,Wide selection of food,5.0,,"Very nice food court: all the various types of world's cuisine, each of them located in a dedicated area (divided by origin). Suggest to go there for dinner, since it's much more characteristic and scenographic. Metro station: get off at Clarke Quay."
,,Great ambiance... many choices.. lots of fun!!!!!,5.0,,"We specifically visited Clarke Quay and really liked the variety of choices of pubs, clubs and restaurants. From Hooters to local named brands, there is something for everyone. Many places feature live music with local artists with a variety of styles to suit all ages and tastes.
Come see... you will find something to you liking, from the local spicy crab to the more traditional choices...."
,,Boat Quay and Clarke Quay night life and great view (Indicated details HOW TO GET THERE),5.0,,"Take a leisure walk between Boat Quay and Clarke Quay and enjoy the view.

,,Clench your teeth,3.0,,"Neon-lit and packed with bars and restaurants. There must be some laws against conversation in the city, because wherever you go, music is turned up to eleven. Each bar tries to outvolume the next. If you like that sort of thing you’ll love Clarke quay. If you don’t, it’s pure, fillings-rattling hell."
,,Worth a visit at night!,4.0,,We’ve visited Clarke Quay a couple of times over the years. It’s not a cheap tourist strip but worth a visit. There are heaps of restaurants & bars for all tastes. I think the best time is at night when the different coloured lights come on. You can also do a river cruise from here.
,,Singapore’s top hotspot!,5.0,,"Easily one of the best area in Singapore. This area is very lively in the evenings and especially on weekends! With the many river side restaurants and karaoke, people dancing by the rivers. Clarke quay is such a delight.

,,Fine Dinning and Fun Clubs,5.0,,"It was very alive during the night, it has clubs and restaurants and bars everywhere, so you a lot of variety to choose from! On Wednesdays a lot of places have ""ladies night"" and offer special promotions. It was full of people and music both locals and foreigners! Great place for nightlife!"
,,Humming,5.0,,Always come here for a drink when we are in town. You've got to walk around and suss out the best happy hours to suit you. Personally don't eat here as its very expensive and touristy and you are better off heading to a market or China town
,,Great place to hang out!,5.0,,"This is where you want to be on a night out.
The place is full of nice and reasonably priced dining venues and drink bars. Plenty of choice to satisfy all tastes.
In the evening the place is crowded and live bands start their show.

,,Good atmosphere,4.0,,"There is a street of pubs and restaurants near the riverside, opposite Liamg Court shopping centre. Love the atmos here!"
,,Restaurants along the water,3.0,,"Worth a stroll along the river or catch a boat ride, or stop for a meal at the many restaurants. These are the main daytime activities."
,,Great for walking,4.0,,"There is a wide variety of restaurants but the best part is a walk along the river, watching the bumboats and looking at the beautiful sculptures lining the waterway. There's an active nightlife here, but we did not participate in the bar scene. We did, however, get ice cream cones one night and watch a Michael Jackson impersonator play to a lively crowd along the walkway. The crowd seemed to consist of both locals and tourists."
,,Cool place,4.0,,"Very nice place on the banks of Singapore river for couples and friends to spend the night out for a drink or for dinner, really great atmosphere. Nothing much for families and not very suitable for young children."
,,Good for a night out with friends ... nothing much special for families,3.0,,"Clarke quay is a sort of a big pub with live music and lot of crowd gatherings in the night time. There is a big swing where people enjoy some adventurous rides and enjoy the whole night. Just ok for families. Nothing much to do. If you wana tick one more destination in your list of to do things in Singapore, can visit once.. nothing special about it."
,,A vibrant place,4.0,,This is modern singapore and tourist central. A expensive place to be. A round of drinks cost the same as our eating out bill.

,,Family,5.0,,"Fun, filling and exciting . This place is full of music surrounded by restaurants and live bands. It’s actually an open space but when you walk by , it feels like air conditioned . It’s a place for people who loves music and food . My kids and my nieces and nephew had a good time here ."
,,Time your trip for needs and companions,5.0,,"During the day, many places are quiet or not yet open. A good time to get a feel for the place and decide where you will go for lunch or dinner.

As the day goes on more party goers start to pile in. The later it gets the harder it becomes to get a table anywhere for a meal. Be patient and you'll find the one and there's plenty of entertainment around. Kilt wearing gents serving at the Highlander, belly dancers at other venues, lots of live music.

We have been there at 9/10pm and it's a club and drinks centre but it's not feral. It's still safe feeling and pleasant. Just a lot more crowded."

,,"IF YOU NEED A RESTAURANT, JUST COME HERE",5.0,,I have never seen so many places to eat in one place. I walked from one end of Clarke Quay to the other. A long way and full of restaurants. Whatever you want to eat is here. It is worth visiting just to take in the atmosphere.
,,Hub of nightlife,5.0,,"Many many bars and restaurants litter the quay, which is extremely popular both during the day and night. In the day it's also popular with children due to the fountain in the centre. There are good toilet facilities on site and lovely views of the city and river."
,,Dinner and Drinks,4.0,,The place is full of bars and restaurants. It comes to life once the sun sets and locals come out to enjoy the night life. The ongoing football world cup made the atmosphere even more exiting. During our stay we came here several times to eat dinner and lunch. For obvious reasons evenings were much more exiting than the day time.
,,klark-kee,3.0,,"we were tempted to stay beyond midnight in this riverbank hub because it was so much fun spending the evening with dear old friends but the only public transport available is the taxi which charges double. since our limited budget is getting tighter, we could not risk staying further.

clarke quay is the go-to place when you want to enjoy SG at night. you can even come back in the morning for a river cruise."
,,Clarke Quay,4.0,,"A good place to visit preferably in evening till late night & suits to people of all ages. If you get tired popping to adjacent mall to cool off from hot & humid climate outdoor.

Spare sometime & do visit this place, will love it. This place is popular among Tourist for Night life."
,,A little tired from the first visit,2.0,,We last visited Clarke Quay in 2015 and previously in 2012 and 2009. Over the time it has changed from a vibrant hub to one now where during the day there is not much happening with many areas closed. Maybe it's different at night but regardless it is certainly looking a little run down.
,,amazing night life...,5.0,,"we have been to clarke Quay on Saturday night during our Singapore trip, it is full of life and it is among most happening place in town in terms of night life, crowd here was awesome there are lots of night clubs here which never let you down."
,,Loads of Bars & Dining Options,4.0,,"Clarke Quay was a great place to visit for the night. We picked a random bar along the river and people watched. We then walked through the lanes of dining & drinking options which are sure to please all preferences. Some bars are clearly for a younger crowd, but I would still take my parents to Clarke Quay given the variety of dining & bar options. We went to Rosso Vino for dinner and would highly recommend this restaurant. It's just a 5 minute walk from Clarke Quay, but worth the walk."
,,Busy nightlife entertainment area,4.0,,"Very good to excellent (4 or 5 stars) for location - e.g. if you stay at a hotel in this area. Close to transport (MRT, buses, taxis), the river, Fort Canning Park, etc. I easily walked along the river to the many attractions at Marina Bay. Very pleasant stroll. There are several shopping malls around for various cuisine eateries, supermarket and other needs. Near the river itself there is a concentration of restaurants, pubs, bars and clubs (including a dance venue). Really livens up at night with colour and crowds. Can get quite noisy. Some of the entertainment area appears bit tacky (perhaps 3 stars) but 5 stars to others."
,,Night life!,5.0,,"Clarke quay was probably my most visited place during my stay in Singapore. This is where most of the night life is and the area is filled with tons of bars and restaurants and every night is filled with all kinds of people until sunrise. In the middle of all the buildings, that are in the shape of a cross pretty much, there is a big fountain area with water spraying up from the ground and he whole entire place is covered by big umbrella looking structures that light up and change colors all night long.

There is so much music and clubs, and even bought drinks can get pretty pricey in Singapore the experience is a good time. Many people crowd the bridge that leads over the canal to Clarke quay and it’s a great way to people watch and enjoy the night with some friends. There’s also a big swing that you can pay to ride, and boats that will take you up and down the canal. Great place to be and always a lot of fun!"
,,Lovely,5.0,,"Visited here with my daughter, felt very cosmopolitan, great choice of restaurant's to choose from right on the riverfront. Boat trips accessible here. Vibrant and fun and close by to shopping centres too."
,,Night vibes,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is by the Singapore River, close to the Central Business District. It's within walking distance from the MRT station.

,,Second visit not so good,3.0,,This was our second time on Clarke Quay with the first being about 8 years ago. For us it seemed to have lost its shine a bit on this trip it was not as clean and I certainly do not remember the large number of fresh vomit marks on the ground that there was this time. It is still as expensive as I remember I got charged $25 for a pint of local beer and a soft drink in one establishment...I won’t be rushing back.
,,"Club, bar & pub",4.0,,Famous night time area that's full of choices for alcohol consumption. There is a lot of choices there and have different promotion from time to time. Especially crowded during weekend and ladies night. Very happening and must visit at least once when come to Singapore.

,,The centre of Singapore - Party hard,5.0,,Clarke Quay is where the action is. Was a sight to behold on the night of the Champions trophy final with the whole deck bathed in Liverpool red (though liverpool sadly lost) Nice places to eat and a good place to grab dinner every evening. Some restaurants tend to close relatively early though (Hutong has last orders at 10 pm) so be careful to check on that.

,,Awesome Place for Nightlife,5.0,,"We arrived here about 10pm, to find the place heaving. It was so busy with people that walking through the area is quite daunting. There are so many different types of bars and restaurants, some with live music. There is also an area with a couple of extreme rides.
We did find that most venues were overpriced."
,,Dinner,4.0,,Rather pricey joints line this area but the atmosphere is special and worth a visit. Modern restaurants and bars are in abundance. Check the prices first before you order.

,,Great entertainment area,4.0,,Wonderful and easy to walk around. Recommend staying in this area when you visit Singapore. Good night life and lots of restaurants. Be aware of the fact that wine is expensive and so good to go sometime after five when most restaurants have happy hour until about 7 or 8 for two for the price of one. This is also where you get the bumboat cruises and can see the evening lights.
,,"Pubs, clubs, bars and river cruises",5.0,,This is the place to go for a night out. Loads of options whether drinking or eating. Worth a visit. River cruises are there also
,,Clarke Quay - The clubbing scene,5.0,,"Pronounced as Clarkey, is a place that's filled with clubs, bars & restaurants galore, a tad bit expensive but super quality you will surely savour the food. The clubs are happening as well. the entire walkway faces the river where you can just chill have a beer with some snacks ( do remember to clean up after). We personally loved the food and the vibe of the place, plenty of karaoke, live bands and the works. Do visit on a saturday night."
,,Not for us,3.0,,We went during the day on a Sunday so it was quite busy with several tourist parties. The whole area looks a bit tired and worn none of which probably shows at night! There are so many eateries that you need trip advisor to help to know where to start! Lots of fast food which adds to the aroma! We wouldn't say this was a must do as there was really not much going for it except the history and a cool breeze coming off the river!
,,"CLARKE QUAY, A LOT OF RESTAURANTS AND BOATS ON THE RIVER.",4.0,,"I stayed 8 nights in Singapore in May 2018. Clarke Quay was a place which I first saw during the famous touristical river cruise, which last more or less 45 minutes and saw how the place looked like from the river side. On next day,I went by metro to see it live, by day and used the chance to eat there. It's quite empty during the day but I guess it worths to be there during the night, when it should be much more animated and noisy. The place is nice to see, but honestly speaking, nothing really exceptionnal, except maybe the view on Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
I will soon add some photos to my review for you to see what I'm talking about.

,,Plenty of nightlife,4.0,,"Along the promenade by Clarke Quay, there are numerous restaurants, clubs and bars and all of which open until the early hours of the morning. All water facing, they look over Singapore River and glow during the evening with vibrancy and are generally always busy.

There are some British and Irish style bars, seafood dine-in restaurants and a Hindi-music playing club among many others.

The Quay is also a short walk from The Fullerton Hotel and nearby bridges such as Anderson and Elgin Bridge can be used to cross the river.

We stayed in the area, in a hotel nearby, and sat looking over the river one night and the lights sprawling across Singapore City. This area is certainly one of the more lively areas you’re likely to find in Singapore."
,,Lots of restaurants and the place to be for nightlife,4.0,,"My wife and I have recently returned from our first visit to Singapore.

Our hotel - The Miramar, was located across the river from Robertson Quay which is a relatively short walk to Clarke Quay. When I researched accommodation in Singapore and after speaking to our travel agent we did decided we wanted to be near Clarke Quay which is a tourist mecca.

We often walked from our hotel along the river to Clarke Quay but mainly during the day. On our last night we visited the Clarke Quay area at night and couldn't believe how the area came alive with people. All the restaurants were open along with night clubs and it had a vibrant feel to it.

Definitely worth a visit at night and for the river boat cruises during the day. We were glad that stayed in the area and wouldn't hesitate in going back."
,,You can have a great day with unforgettable memories.,4.0,,"The best time to visit this place is at night, during the daytime not many people around. When we visited the place was crowded. You can find so many places to eat and drink. Clubs and bars are everywhere.

Apart from that, you can go for a boat ride on the Singapore River that lies at the heart of the Clarke Quay and also you can do some fun activities.

In near vicinity, there are places like Hong San See Temple, Central Fire Station & Civil Defence Heritage Gallery, G-Max Reverse Bungy, Fort Canning Park etc. You will have to reserve another day or two to cover all these things."

When we visited the place was packed, the atmosphere was great. We walked around for awhile and then decided on the restaurant. There is so much to look at and experience. The kids wanted to go on the Giant Sling Shot but were to young. You can hire Segways or scooters to get around. I would only do this during the day as to many people at night.

Lots of shopping to be done and as everything is open late there is no hurry to get around.

Catch the SMRT is the easiest way to get there, or we did catch a taxi and it cost $9 from Somerset."
,,Party Like A Rock Star,5.0,,If you are looking for a nightlife in Singapore this is your place. So many pubs & clubs in one corner. The clubs will charge you entry fee which can be redeemed with drinks. We went on weekdays & still the crowd & music was overwhelming. A little expensive but this what Singapore is all about. Try highlander!
,,Bar hopping,5.0,,"Out of the entire modern and strict district there is this place where hundreds of others get together and enjoy the evenings.

,,Dowdy and cheap looking,3.0,,"I guess there must have been a time, probably when this place was first developed, when it looked the bees knees. Now it just looks dowdy, downmarket and cheap. It also feels rather tight and shoehorned in. Maybe it's better at night"

,,Nice place to hangout in the evening,4.0,,"This is one happening place in the city. With bars, cafes, restaurants on either side of the river, this place is a really happening one.You can even start your river cruise from here. The restaurant on the river side are a little expensive but worth the view and ambience. Don't visit little saigon restaurant here unless you are from vietnam :). I really like the music and ambience in the bars here. A must visit in Singapore"
,,Expensive - but worth the visit,4.0,,"Clarke quay isn’t the cheapest place to have dinner while you are in Singapore. You can tell it’s definitely been developed to cater for western tourists. But there’s not much you won’t find here. The range of restaurants and cuisines, bars, lounges abc clubs is just amazing. If you had the cash you could try a new restaurant everyday and not get bored.
However, it’s not the cheapest place and you know you can find a good meal elsewhere for much less. But if you want to experience Singapore you need to come down for a walk around and try a restaurant or a pub for the experience. It is a truly beautiful part of Singapore."
,,Riverside dining,5.0,,"Clarke Quay has so much variety in the way of restaurants, something for everyone. A lot of the restaurants have water views & you can also take a ferry ride along the river. There’s also a shopping centre there with a mixture of different stores & cafes."

You can enjoy walking around as I did or you can sit and enjoy food and different drinks. The way it is organized takes the breath away. Clean, safe, beautiful and dynamic place to visit. There are many hotels around such as Holiday Inn express Clarke Quay, and Novetel hotel. The transportations are easy and plenty."
,,New Kid on the Block,5.0,,"There's a new restaurant in town and it's great. The restaurant is called ""The Ranch"" and it's been a long time since I have tasted steaks quite like theirs The kitchen would make Gordon Ramsay proud and no I'm not being paid for this review.The only thing I can say is get it while it's hot. I just can't see this restaurant being able to hold the menu price for the top notch quality and service they are giving their customers. If your in Clarke Quay Singapore then pay them a visit. You won't be sorry."

,,Great food choices,4.0,,"Whilst billed as the cool place for young adults to meet, eat and drink, it is a,so good for family dining earlier in the evening.

It’s lively and noisy within the covered street area but quieter spots are available by the river.

Most bars / restaurants run happy hours during the early evening with a pint / bottle of lager / glass of wine / selected spirits running at about $10 each, miss the discounted time and you’ll get no change from $15 per drink. Dining options are huge but prices similar; most main courses between $15 - $30 each.

,,"Beautiful spot, expect to pay for it though",4.0,,"This is a great spot full of tons of food and bar options. It is rather touristy, but sometimes that’s what you’re looking for. You can also take a bumboat (at a cost) down the river. Expect high prices, as you’ll find in Singapore food is either super cheap at things like hawkers, or pricey at restaurants. If you have the cash, try out the chili crab."
,,Nice walk but expensive dining,4.0,,Very similar to nearby Robertson Quay. Quiet during the day but the many bars and restaurants come alive at night. Nice walk but expensive dining!
,,Good place for night out with friends,4.0,,I like Japanese restaurant there very delicious and this place is just walking distance from hotel that I stayed which is Holiday Inn Clarke Quay.

-Nice place to have a cold beer ( as you may know, Alcohol was expensive in Singapore though) ; I had a good beer at 'Harris International' and relaxed outside.
-Lots of eateries facing the Quay and also inside the Malls .
-This is a relaxing, enjoyable and a fun place to spend a few hours lazily.

This apart from sadley raffles having a 1.2 billion refurbishment sadley arrived to find closed until mid year this year, hopefully have one next time around not 26 years though since last wow experience, as this place simply has no land or room left expansion is the amazing high rise buildings tower blocks even these have shops galore.

,,Definitely a night spot,3.0,,"Slow as molasses during the day. Sunny and hot means little shade, but some spots along the quay have umbrellas, fans, etc. Would have been better at night, I'm sure. Drinks are expensive, but that's the case everywhere in Singapore."

,,a mainstay in Singapore !,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is the iconic place to go whenever you think of Singapore. The colorful and festive scenes are open 7 days a week, night and day with plenty of sites to see and experience including shopping, restaurants, and pubs. I always make a point of visiting here whenever I'm in Singapore regardless of the limited time I have. A trip to Singapore would not be complete without a visit to Clare Quay. I feel that a visit here in the evenings is perhaps the most special time to visit since the weather is cooler and the lights throughout the venue are spectacular and the mood is busy and festive. I would recommend this place as a mandatory stop whenever visiting Singapore."
,,Great day or evening (OR BOTH!!),5.0,,Great place to relax in during day or when busy in evenings. Good restaurants (specially Hooters) for a reasonable priced meal and a Tiger Beer and just watch the goings on the River. Same in evening when lights are on.
,,The best,5.0,,One of my Favorite places is Singapore for Dinner & drinks as lots & lots of options or even for a stroll .Just love this area beside the river which makes it wonderful .
,,First night,4.0,,"Having arrived early evening we dumped our bags, showered and headed for Clarke Quays. This is a must for any tourist or even resident in Singapore. The place has a real buzz with live music, bars and restaurants for all tastes & ages. Just walking around the streets is an experience but the food is definitely worth sampling especially along the river bank. The main walk through areas are covered with canopies and cool air circulation making it a very pleasant walk. Everyone seems very happy, pleasant and there's no trace of antisocial behaviour anywhere.
Definitely worth a night or two!"
,,Great place to spend an evening,4.0,,Great variety of restaurants (including the first Hooters In Asia). Great views of the river. Just a good night out without a heap of drunks making a nuisance of themselves
,,Dinner walk,4.0,,"It is along Singapore River and the second quay after Boat Quay from the mouth of the river. It is also having the most activities such as shopping centers, restaurants, pubs, water taxi stands, reverse bungee jump, etc.. Of course the price tags are also high especially those selling seafoods along the river.
It is nice to walk during the evening or night as the lighting will bring out the beauty of the place. The place can be reach by public transports - buses & train. It is also near China town."
,,Good night life,5.0,,Great for drinking and plenty of places to eat great music places very busy take a boat ride along the river bear is very cheap here
,,Come for the view not the food,4.0,,"I think the view is more attracting to me rather than food. For about same food quality, we must pay more compare to other place in Singapore. I think most of food seller in Singapore have good hygiene. So no point to eat here if it was not for the ambience.
Well this is my personal opinion. Other may see it differently."
,,Very romantic,5.0,,"At night, it is very romantic and ideal for a secluded dinner for two, followed by a couple of cocktails. I'd recommend going on one of the boat cruises available in the canal - The take you up the river, pointing out some of the important and interesting sights. We were charmed by the nightlife"
,,Great place for nightlife and eating out,4.0,,Clarke Quay is one of the best places in Singapore to eat out with views of the river and to have fun into the night. The standard of restaurants is high as is the selection of food. You can also get a boat ride form here. Both up and down the river are other great places to eat and drink and be merry and can easily be reached by walking or by crossing the bridge.
,,Everything you want in one place - but after dark,4.0,,"Great area of Singapore with many eatery and drinking places to call into, doesn't really fire until late afternoon or early evening, but you won't be short of what and where to eat. ideally central to most hotels and has a fairly quick taxi rank that can get you to your hotel when needed.Good place to get on the ""Bumboats"" and have a river cruise down to see the light show at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Go for the 7.30 pm trip and have dinner afterwards Clarke Quay"
,,nightlife,3.0,,This is where the Nightlife in Singapore happens. Lots of (expensive) restaurants and bars and nightclubs. It gets very busy during the weekends and Singapore's biggest nightclub Zouk is attracting most of the crowds... Not my cup of tea though. Too expensive food and drinks. Don't fall for the tourist trap that they call Chili crab. Super expensive and it is just crab with chilis.
,,Great place with lots of cafes and lounges and good nightlife,5.0,,The Clarke Quay is a great place if you are looking for a happening nightlife in Singapore. The place is beaming with people and has a no. of bars and cafes. The drinks here is surely expensive and we went during the happy hours which was still ok! Overall a great place with very lively atmosphere. The river view is also very nice.
,,'Singapore is so boring'.,5.0,,"No it's not. Come here for a drink on the weekend and you'll change your mind: it was just as busy and fun as other places in SE Asia. Yes, it is more expensive than Bangkok, Boracay, Ho Chi Minh or Kuta, but it's also a lot cleaner and less seedy. Anyway, there are tonnes of bars to try and I would happily go back. In particular, Chupito's was good for shots and McGettigan's if there's sport on TV."
,,"Great place for lunch, dinner, and some night life",5.0,,We stayed at the Novotel and this place was right beside it. The Clarke Quay is really cool with lots of different restaurants and things to do. I was really happy that this place was so close. so much better than having hotel food all the time.
,,A very nice place to walk around during an evening,4.0,,A must place to walk around during an evening if you are visiting Singapore. Lots of restaurants and bars with live LOUD music.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"We went there to have drinks and honestly, the alcohol is very overpriced and most bars seemed overly fancy. Many young people were sitting on the bridge and drinking beer bought at the corner store. We finally found a spot on the bridge and it was honestly WAY more fun than sitting at any bar. Who knew a few cans of beer and sitting on the side of a bridge could turn out so fun!"
,,Beautiful Riverside Area with Shops and Restaurants,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a splendid place for a stroll and a meal by the riverside, especially at night. when the place is lit beautifully. There's lots of energy here, with street musicians and plenty of restaurants along both sides of the river. All of this is connected by bridges and pedestrian walkways. Not to be missed!"
,,Nice to see,3.0,,Everyone raves about this place so had to be done. We had a nice walk along the river here and enjoyed a drink at lunchtime. I imagine it’s very busy at night and loud too seems more for a younger crowd. Lots of good drink deals and so many options for food and nightlife. Music blaring from all directions. Interesting buildings all painted in different colours and obviously the area has been looked after. Good to see but didn’t feel it was that special.
,,"Lively with lots of peeps, food options, drinks",4.0,,"A relaxed night, with Music, Drinks although heavy on the pocket. But a must go to place if you are in Singapore and enjoy music and some stroll"

Live music with good club/dancing scene. Not too crowded any night I was there, but still good vibe."
,,Absolute fun!,5.0,,"We came here twice and had absolute fun! The majority of the nightlife is here! You can find bars, nightclubs, restaurants and so on. You can take the train and it is within walking distance of the station. Once inside be prepared to pay hefty prices for alcoholic beverages!

You can walk down the boardwalk/river, great vibe at night! You can easily catch a taxi from here after a late night out."
,,A night river cruise is a must to do.,5.0,,"Whilst perhaps you may think a little expensive but not really for Singapore the night trips on the river are brilliant. To see everywhere all lit up is spectacular. Marina Bay Sands Hotel, The Fullerton Bay Hotel, The Wheel, All the office blocks and bridges look stunning on a clear night. Have done the trip during the day as well which is okay but have to say the night trip is the best. If you love your photography you will be snapping away the whole trip."
,,Visit this place every time we come to Singapore,4.0,,"Its got a great vibe and lovely wide promenades to walk along the river. The BumBoats still operate from here if you want to take a slow boat ride down the river to the Marina. There is a train station located at Clarke Quay, a huge shopping centre & lots of eateries all in close proximity."
,,Enchanted views by the bay,5.0,,Take a evening walk from merllein park. Just follow the river . It will lead you to Clarke quay through green parks. It looks beautiful when the sun sets and the lights from the restaurants reflects from the water. There are so many options to eat and have a drink on the river Bay. Amazing walk under the stars .
,,We loved this venue,5.0,,"This area was somewhat recently recently extensively renovated, with the addition of giant umbrella style coverings of the spaces between the buildings, allowing for all weather use of the many venues that offer outdoor as well as indoor seating. We were here last night during intermittent heavy rainstorms, and were able to sit outside, under he canopies, without any hint of rain. The area is chock full of restaurants, bars, and music venues, with something for everyone. It's a very lively scene at almost all times. It is also a main embarkation point for the popular river cruises, and is handy to the MRT. For us, it was a must see location in Singapore, where food and drinks can be had at what for Singapore, are reasonable prices."
,,Rocking......PARTY ALL NIGHT.,4.0,,"It was our first evening in Singapore and all the teenage kids were extremely excited to visit the Clarke quay.
What's Good.......it is one of the most happening part of Singapore due to it's vibrant nightlife and some nearby attractions and most importantly the Singapore River.
Clarke quay is located close to Chinatown and many good hotel chains are located in this belt.
The party scene was quite happening for youngsters and loads of party animals kept on hitting the scene late in the night, we left the place around 3 am in the morning.
Conclusion......a must visit place for party lover's,looking forward to spend some quality time.."
,,Def a different scene than downtown,4.0,,"This is a cool Hangout area for perhaps a younger crowd....to do bar hopping....eating at restaurants etc. Most of all the restaurant have seating on the river's edge for your view while drinking/eating.
Not as clean compared to rest of city. Didn't like getting harassed each time we walked up & down the street from the waiting staff to ""eat at their restaurant."""
,,Cool place to hang around,5.0,,"This is a beautiful round about surrounding the river of the beautiful Singapore. There is lot of pub, restaurant and the atmosphere gets electrifying at the evening time. You will find a cosmopolitan global crowd enjoying in the cosy environment of the surroundings. The restaurant are all types , sea food, continental to local Singaporean food and a nice boat ride in the rever will make the evening even more beautiful. You just can not miss the attaraction of the place if you are in Singapore. The light and glitter of the area can not be missed"
,,Really great place to hang out and people watch,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is one of our favourite places to hang out when is Singapore lots of places to eat and drink, you can sit on the river front and get a good meal or drink at a reasonable price, quick walk to Chinatown from there.

Really worth a couple of hours to look around of just sit down and watch the world go by."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, you must visit Clarke Quay! It's a great place, with a lot of restaurants and bars, where you can find many kinds of food and drinks. At night the place is specially interesting, because of all the artistic illumination. So fun and so beautiful! Definitely a must go!"

,,Overpriced but enjoyable,3.0,,"Nice place to spend the night and have a couple of drinks. Crowded and noisy, but take that in a good way. That’s the place to go if you enjoy the nightlife. Quite expensive, though. Had a gin and tonic at Highlanders that costed me three times as much as I’m used to pay. The music was great and the crowd was young and charming."
,,Excellent place to eat and enjoy a drink with your friends and family,5.0,,Loved this place. What an atmosphere!!! It has many restaurants and bars with an awesome view. A must visit place in singapore
,,Great place to be for a night out,5.0,,Read that CQ was the place to be in Singapore during night time. It was so true! Loved coming here. It is more expensive because you are one waterfront. Many drink deals and some food specials (prepare to spend a bit). You can take the night time river boat cruise for 25 Singapore dollars from here too. Lively atmosphere and there are even some live music and night clubs here. Theres also a giant swing that you can go on (up to four people) that will launch you over the river. Worth to check out!
,,Vibrant place,5.0,,"This is a very colourful and vibrant place at night. There are so many different places to eat, that it becomes a challenge to choose something. Lovely waterfront views to be had at several restaurants. An amazing place and definitely worth a night visit."
,,tourist trap!,2.0,,"visited last night after several years absence. too noisy, too touristy and too crowded.
tried a bar for a couple of drinks .. that was overpriced and the the cocktails were poorly mixed and disappointing. we then chose the Japanese restaurant where we managed to have the worst Japanese meal we have had for a long time. best thing about Clarke Quay for us was getting a taxi to take us back to our hotel."
,,Good place to spend your evening,4.0,,Really nice and comparatively quiet place to spend your evenings especially with family and kids. A lot of bars and restaurants are therearound. You can also enjoy reverse bungee jump ride. Don't forget to take a walk on Ord Bridge and cruise ride.
,,Great nightlife,5.0,,This is a great place if you like a bit of lively nightlife. It has loads of bars and a variety of restaurants and eating places. It's also undercover in case it rains. There is an MRT station close by and through the day you can get a river cruise down the Singapore river
,,Run of the mill tourist hotspot,3.0,,Plenty of places to eat and drink here in slightly more upmarket setting (and prices) than say Chinatown or Little India. There are boat rides and bungy type experiences for those with large wallets and a taste for something different
,,Tourist place,4.0,,"Was in this area few year ago and quite like it. This time I come back and absolutely it is not the same. Too crowded and noisy however what we can expect when you come to most of the most touristic place.

Regardless, it is good to sit at some of the bar by the river and have a great view. Was one of the bar but I forget the name, it is great place with good live music performance...."
,,"The sort of place that appears to have a collective hangover until 11.30am,",4.0,,"Adult playground, a brash loud area that now stretches over both sides of the Singapore River. A fun place to be with a huge choice of restaurants, bars and late shopping malls with a MRT station on the southern bank, making access extremely easy. It is the sort of place that appears to have a collective hangover until 11.30am, and with just cause..then the party life starts again."
,,Best nightlife in Singapore,5.0,,"This place is very happening, if you visit it in the night. Bursting with restaurants and pubs with great live music bands playing in the entrance. Combined with the view of a river, this place certainly has the best nightlife in Singapore. Make sure you visit this place after 10:30 PM. Walk the entire area to see the place and dine at a restaurant you like. Really loved the experience and looking forward to visiting again."
,,So fun!,5.0,,The best place to walk around and have drinks. Everything is beautiful and you have many options of bars and restaurants. Very easy to get there since there’s an MTR station. I suggest you going there around 5:30pm.
,,Many bars and restaurants.,3.0,,"This place has many eateries and bars to chose from, som of which are along the banks of the River. If you are unsure, there are plenty to chose from."
,,Food paradise of the Far East..xx,5.0,,"This place is like a nation's gastronomical paradise...as you can find practically every nation's cuisine here. The prices may vary depending upon what you fancy eating..xx My nephew wanted to eat pizza and we did just that. The most amazing thing happened as well as we were eating our pizza sitted outside the restaurant patio..there was a free Belly dancing performance on display just next door which was rather eye catching but simply superb. Its a great place to chill out for some cocktails, other alcohol beverages and international menus to choose from. Its also a great place to take the river cruise from Clarke Quay but the Q can be quite a wait especially in the humidity.
This review is about the eatery at Clarke Quay . We drove there and I guess if you take the MRT then its Clarke Quay station that you need to get off at."
,,Amazing atmosphere with River views,5.0,,Great place for bar hopping and food. Plenty of choices for night clubs and great views of the river and boat rides.
,,Convenient,3.0,,"Its like a huge entertainment district. Bars, restaurants and even some fast food places. Can be very loud due to live music. The good thing is that its covered with a roof- handy in a city where it rains a lot."
,,Great variety,5.0,,"We were staying at the Swissôtel Merchant Court and wandered over to Clarke Quay numerous times during our five night stay, whether just for a wander or to eat or drink, each time it was a great experience. We were lucky to see the river festival during our stay so it made our experiences even more magical.
We ate at a few places and enjoyed drinks one night at an Irish bar, it was great being outside but under cover, especially when a thunder and lightning storm passed over!
Relaxing and entertaining place to visit!"
,,Interesting afternoon,4.0,,"Clarke Quay seems like it would be a vibrant place to be at night. We went in the midday laziness, so there wasn't much happening except for lunch deals on the waterfront. Aside from the usual shopping malls, I found Clarke Quay to be really interesting, architecturally, as there were boats used as shop fronts, colourful terraces and heritage buildings. I recommend seeing it all via water. See if you can get on a river cruise so you can sit in the shade, and learn about the area."
,,Must see,5.0,,Night life district with beautiful bars. The place is like open air but with a roof. Must see also if you don’t have interest in night life.
,,Three day stopover,4.0,,"A perfect choice for a much needed stopover on the way to/from Australia. All the restaurants you could wish for as well as nice areas to walk, either during the daytime or evening. Would recommend."
,,Night life is great,5.0,,"We had dinner here, if you can’t find something you like then it doesn’t exist, live entertainment, great food, great views this place has it all"
,,Bars and restaurants,3.0,,"This is one of the places to come to experience nightlife in Singapore. There are plenty of different bars and restaurants to try. During the day it's very hot around here and there are less people as a result. At night, however, it's much more lively."
,,Terrible service and food never arrived !!!,1.0,,"Would like to make a Long short but there's a lot to say...
I went for a quick bite on Xmas eve and I just order 10 pcs of traditional hooter wings and 2 small btl of water (me and my wife).
After roughly 40 min of waiting, they bring me BBQ American wings which was not what I ordered and I send it back.
I immediately understood that something was wrong with my order since I keep seeing staff around with that wrong order, kind of panicking and pass the plate to each other.
No worries I work in f&b industries as well, i can understand, so I decided to wait a bit more but I asked what happened, and they said they send my food to another table (so they basically did try to give me the food of that table seeing if I might not realise).
After another 10 min the food didn't arrive so I decided to leave and I asked the bill:
amazingly after nearly 50 min waiting for my food that never arrived, they had the brave to give me the bill of 2 water $4.70.
At that point, I called the ""manager"" (i believe Filipino or Malay/Indo) and I asked if for him it's correct that after wait 50 min and never get my food I pay 2 small btl of water. His answer was ""yes if you are in f&b you should know how does it work in Xmas eve!""
Fair enough I shake his hand I paid and I left, but now dear ""manager"" enjoy the 1 star review, it's all for U!! Merry Xmas bro :* !!
...And for you GM of Hooters try to hire a real floor manager who can handle complaints and jammed order situations next time, not just a waiter.
Cheers"
,,Nice area with plenty restaurants,4.0,,"Came here again after visiting in December 2014, The Clarke quay is full of restaurants, pubs and cafes. The locations looks great in the evenings with colorful lights and waterfront views. The place gets really busy in the evenings and almost all the cuisine restaurants are available here. There is a loud music going around and long chair tables put outside the all the restaurants. There is a fancy fountain put in place in between which drags the tourist attention."

,,Honeymoon,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a great place to visit if staying in Singapore. We visited in November and as it’s the rainy season, we got wet! However, ClarkeQuay is almost all undercover. The taxi dropped us off and the canopy was overhead and all the walkways are covered.
There are a great assortment of bars and restaurants, the ones on the waters edge looked to be a bit more authentic than the ones on the covered streets. It is quite westernised though and a little bit too clean if you know what I mean. We visited twice, once in the afternoon and once in the evening, it was a much better vibe in the evening as the bars were all busy. It’s worth crossing the bridge to the other side as their are some great bars there too. We ate in Price, it was lovely, the chilli crab was amazing but it wasn’t as original as we’d had in other places, it’s a chain after all. My husband loved The Pumpkin Room and micro brewery.
It’s definitely worth a visit whilst in Singapore in the evening, it’s got bars all together so a good night is to be had. .... especially if it’s raining!"

,,Great location,4.0,,Originally went here to catch a boat for river cruise but ended up staying for dinner and drinks as well.

We were staying at the near by Holiday Inn Express at Clarke Quay, the location of this hotel is very central to the town center and a short walking distance to the shopping district. Singapore is a very safe city and going from one attraction to another by taxi is very convenience and not expensive, but every time ask the taxi driver for a receipt to ensure he will not overcharging you."
,,Fabulous Atmosphere....,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit, it's very central and easy to find by foot or train. There's lots of food options to choose from and it's great to people watch their. There's less options for lunch as most places are closed but the odd one is open."

,,A hive of activity day and night.,5.0,,"Clarke Quay Singapore is most definitely worth visiting.

Whether you wish to book a river cruise, experience the vast shopping mall, or relax and eat near the river watching the world go by, then there is something for everyone to do.

The mall itself is not for the faint hearted for sure. Multiple floors and a colour coding system to get your head around, but once mastered it then becomes quite easy to navigate. The basement area is a vast array of the most fabulous eateries. Reasonably priced with some essential shops added for good measure too.

There are some fabulous clothing boutiques as well as stores aimed at the tourist market.

One thing you will notice about the mall and surrounding area, it is scrupulously clean and well kept and there are concierge that can speak English and aid with certain requirements if one feels a little daunted.

I had the most amazing chilli chicken and noodles from a fixed price menu. $6. Excellent value and so tasty. A good way of seeing which are the better areas to eat at is to look to see where the locals migrate too. Whilst there may be a language barrier. The menus are visual which makes it a lot easier to order from!

The bars are a little expensive, however a lot cheaper than drinking in the hotel. There quite literally is something for everyone. A hive of activity day and night!"
,,Wow of a Location,5.0,,"It's all happening at Clarke Quay.

You can jump aboard a boat cruise, enjoy a drink and food at the many bars or grab a meal at the plethora of waterside restaurants.

All the bars offer happy hours with some running from lunchtime till 6pm. Most offer buckets of 5 beers for a discount and the bar snack seem reasonable. A number had live music from around 8pm.

The area is beautiful with fabulous lighting along the riverfront. You really must visit this area especially at night!"

,,Looking around Singapore,5.0,,"Wow, what a great place to dine and sit and enjoy the beautiful balmy nights and relax, with a drink in hand. The diverse range of foods, cultures were amazing and smells of these, hit your nostrils, and we were in food heaven. The choice was amazing and hard, so we walked the length of the quay to decide, then over the bridge to check out the other side of the river, looking a every menu as we went. It was a beautiful night and we were in no hurry, we took our time. To much selection. So after about an hour we decided on Mexican, it was terrific. There is so much to pick from, yes there are different styles of Asian cuisines, Irish Pub, Mexican, Italian, steakhouse, and there are so many more. One great place for food diversity. When finished we walked back the our hotel on Marina Bay along the river past the Fullerton Hotel, some of the large range of museums and the convention centre, which from the air looks like two great eyes. Great place to eat, but don’t get there much before 11-12 am if you want lunch they are only just opening, as they stay open late."
,,Very modern vibe,4.0,,Nice complex filled with restaurants. More suited to adults as it is filled with bars and live music. Nice with family for an early dinner and a stroll. Reminds me of The Grove in L.A.

There is a lot of energy and ambiance and being on the water gives you a great view of parts of the city and access to the the water taxis and tours.

There are pubs with live band, English pubs etc. You can also find numerous restaurants serving Western, Asian, Middle Eastern etc. The famous Zouk Club in Singapore is at Clarke Quay too.

I recommend Clarke Quay for some adult fun. It’s a nice place to hang out, have dinner and listen to live music. Once you’re done with the live music, you can head to clubs for a bit of dancing. Don’t worry about transportation as taxis galore till the wee hours of the morning. Clarke Quay is a place you’ll enjoy yourselves for sure."

,,Pretentious Quay,1.0,,"We strolled through here one night, thinking it might be like the wharfs in Sydney, Australia. We were hugely disappointed in not only the ridiculously high prices of the restaurant food, but also highly irritated by the waiters and waitresses at the bars and restaurants. Beware that they will try to offer you some sort of special deal, such as “Buy 1 meal, get one free”, “eat at our restaurant and for each main meal you order, we will give you a free beer etc”. We learned that these are just tricks to get you seated and committed to ordering and in fact they will not honour any of the special deals they used to lure you in off the footpath!"
,,Busy place lots to do and fantastic views,5.0,,"Best in the evening from what we saw. I would recommend getting the water taxi from here to the Marina bay Sands, or vice versa. Lots of restaurants, bars and cruises all around this area, a great location to start or end your evening."
,,Busy place to eat,3.0,,"A busy place with plenty of choice of food & drink venues with live music & loads of us tourists- not very authentic but the food was good & the views along the river were nice.
As expected the prices are more here as they hike the costs for the tourists but the choice is ours at the end of the day as to where we go for food.
The river cruises also go from this area & the Quay is very different during the day."
,,Super Touristy,5.0,,"This place is bustling with tourists most of the times. However, it is still a fun and relaxing place to be. The best time to go is around sunset. The glistening rays illuminating the entire place looks surreal. Dinner by the water is expensive but worth it. After dinner one can spend a calm time sitting by the river and enjoying the breeze."
,,Touristy but fun,4.0,,"This Quay is one of the main tourist areas on the River. It provides great views of the Singapore Skyline and also of the River. Lots of bars and restaurants and mostly tourists. Not a lot of locals come here, with good reason.

Much better at night than during the day time. The boats from the River stop here too.

I enjoyed the variety of the area, but it has some international chains now, which to me is a detraction.

Worth a visit early one evening during your visit."
,,"Nice, alive and also expensive",4.0,,"A very nice build star formation of very nice and tasty restaurants.. if you like to go for a dinner were a lot of people are around, just to feel like in the middle of singapure, you have to go there.. it‘s not a quite place for dinning.. but it‘s not like noisy, it‘s more alive there.. you can choose a lot of restaurants.. live music and and and.. but the price is also really high there. For example a pizza and one burger cost around 50SGD together. And the beer in this area is around 12 dollars for a big size..."
,,Great place to be,5.0,,"Lots of things to do here, especially nightlife, different bars and restaurants. It's a lively but safe place and great scenery."
,,A nice walk and a pleasant river safari!,4.0,,"It’s a wonderful place for a walk at night . On the river side, you see mAny restaurants and cafes glittering in wonderful lights with their reflections falling in the river. Though there are no proper places to sit, you enjoy your walk there. In the day time you can go for a river safari with the charge of about 22 SGD. During this safari you may see the merlion, the marina bay sands building and the buildings of many banks. The boat ride is truly enjoyable."
,,"Clark Quay is nice, but wait until after 5PM.",4.0,,"Not too much is open before 4PM and the place is like a ghost town before then. At night it's bustling with live music, outdoor dining, boats ferrying up and down the river and crowds of people."
,,Stunning in the evening,5.0,,We walked from the Art Science museum to Clarke Quay in the evening. It was magical. Even the water taxis were lit up. Had a meal at one of the many restaurants and watched the canopies over the quay change colour.
,,"OK, but Boat Quay is better",3.0,,"Clarke Quay is one of those ""must-dos"" that you kind of have to do, but you don't need to spend too much time here. Honestly, it's super-touristy and nothing that interesting or exceptional.

Check it out, but if you're looking for something more authentic and laid back, head on over to Boat Quay instead. It's much nicer and has a more pleasant feel. It has become more polished and touristy in recent years, but it gives you a better idea of what Singapore used to be like."
,,Don't Swing by on a Sunday morning!,3.0,,"My fault more than anything but don't bother coming past here sunday before mid afternoon as not much is open. Having said that, the area is a great little mix of bars and eateries in older style buildings with a great feel to it. I am sure when it is going it is a pumping eatery with lots of atmosphere. Lots of non-traditional style places like pubs and Italian restaurants even a Hooters exists for those who are game. Well worth a visit when busy but skip sunday before mid afternoon."
,,Great Memories,4.0,,"I have visited Singapore continuously for five years and spent almost the entire month of May there when my elder son was working there ( 2005 - 2010 ) I have such fond memories of that place.Language, food, commuting was no problem at all with people who were very friendly and willing to help. One can find the Tamils, the Chinese there and one can see the cultural influence.Neat and clean and people sit a lot of civic sense which is a part of their culture. Clark Quay has changed a lot down a period of time but had a lot of restaurants and the ambience was simply superb as they have a variety of sea food joints and one of the best place for those who love to taste a crab .

,,Clarke Quay F1 Weekend!,5.0,,Singapore nights are always stunning! With cool lights and great place to hang out like Clarke Quay! It's a bonus that the country is very safe as well.:)
,,Best place to see the rustic Singapore by the river,4.0,,This place has managed to keep the rustic charm of the buildings and filled with restaurants and pubs frequent by mostly tourist and locals. Nice view of the Singapore skyline while having dinner. It is also very close to the Merlion park and Sir Stamford Raffles statue.
,,Tourist area. Experience probably depends on time of day,3.0,,"We visited for a drink during the afternoon. It's by the river which isn't great as rivers go. There is a bit of traffic from a few tourist boats but it's not particularly scenic.
Lots of bars and places to eat. Prices adjusted upwards as you might expect. Probably more fun in the evening when I suspect it would be a bit more lively"
,,Great restaurants,5.0,,A lovely vibrant area with many bars and restaurants. Plenty of choice for everyone's needs and tastes. Great by day and night. Boat trip down the river showed us a different view from the walk down the quay. Really recommend here. We thoroughly enjoyed it in the day and at night.
,,Mcgettigans clarke street Clarke quays,4.0,,A really nice pub with good customer service. Let's be honest alcohol in Singapore isn't cheap but this pub is really nice but it does lessen the result of the bill. Sometimes you just have to do what you want to do .
,,Really disappointed,2.0,,This is nothing but a cheap tourist hub. Most of the restaurants weren't even of asian inspiration. Waste of time really as we had high expectations.
,,Fun Fun Fun!,5.0,,"Went to Clarke Quay on my first night and absolutely loved it and kept coming back. This place has great ambience with a wide variety of restaurants, bars, clubs etc. Highly recommend to visit, or just to walk around and soak in the vibe."
,,Business trip location,3.0,,We needed to come to Singapore for business and opted for Clarke quay based on travel agent recommendations. It was a lovely spot but I must be honest. The architecture was all over the place which made it a little confusing. But it was a lovely spot close to our hotel and so many good food options it was crazy! A great location for the purposes of our trip.
,,Great riverside restaurants and bars,4.0,,"Plenty of dining options here. Not cheap - if you want cheap better to go to Chinatown. But pay a bit more at Clark Quay and you get a table on the beautiful riverbank where you can watch the boats and people comes down go. There are several pretty neon- lit bridges crossing the river, so it is easy to go for a 30 minute stroll after dinner. You can walk along the riverbank on one side, then cross over and return to your starting point on the other side of the river with different views. Would certainly do this again."
,,Tourist hot spot.,5.0,,"This place is a tourist hot spot. There are a lot of bars and restaurants. Halal options are available (venture around, one of them is The Shiraz). More alive during night. There's a Zouk club too. You can book a return river cruise ( or you can also drop off at Marina Bay and Merlion park - request at ticket booth).

Do expect the food price will be a bit pricey.

Best experience around Clarke Quay is at night - the scenery is beautiful."
,,nightlife,5.0,,"so many attraction and you can enjoy the river by boat, enjoy the street musician along the bridge. I visited this place in night, I found so many cafe, food, handicraft and night club."
,,Great Nightlife Venue,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is full of life and well worth a visit. There is a huge choice of restaurants and bars. If you want to meet people and do the nightclub scene it is ideal but you can also just enjoy a drink during happy hour and soak-up the atmosphere, or take a ferry trip on the river and see the light show. Plenty of shopping for those so inclined. It's a very tourist centric location with prices to match but lots of fun."
,,Clarke Quay ... Map included,4.0,,"Usually known for its nightlife, Clarke Quay is very pleasant during the day as well. Many restaurants and cafes are open during the day. Drink coffee by the river or chinese hot-pot. Today we had pizza at Motorino Pizza and it was excellent, slightly chewy crust, very traditional."
,,Evening drinks,5.0,,"Lots of bars and restaurants to choose from, all have drinks deals and of course happy hour normally from 5/6pm till 9pm. As you will expect Singapore is not cheap for drinks a pint will set you back around £8 and cocktails £10. Great for people watching, live music as some bars. Weekends it's busy, we went on a Monday and it was still lively. Amazing Choice of food and bar types from pubs to up market cocktail bars."
,,Vibrant dinner venue,4.0,,"Situated by the Singapore river, various restaurants right on the river banks. Stroll along the riverbank for an unforgettable experience . With plenty of places to eat and drink at, this seems to be quite a popular place with both tourists and local Singaporeans."
,,Best Nightlife in Singapore :)),5.0,,"If you want to enjoy nightlife in Singapore then this place is for you.
Over 100 Restaurants and many good hotels around this place is a must visit in Singapore itinerary.
World Cuisine on the river side , excellent views a must go for everyone .
There is river ride for a ticket price and some swings as well.
Best Night Clubs which closes late in the morning.
Overall a great place for having dinner and spend time with family and friends riverside :))"
,,Great spot for evening stroll. But is also where tourists go to be with other tourists,3.0,,Pretty at night but is tourist hot spot so everything overpriced and food poor quality. If you are looking for trashy bars to hang out with plenty of drunk touists then this is your place. If you want to experience the real Singapore then keep going.
,,Beautiful place!,5.0,,Have visited the place today because we wanted to take a river cruise. It is a very beautiful area worth visiting. It has a large mall at the front and you can easily access it by bus.
,,Vibrant dinner venue,5.0,,Situated by the Singapore river various restaurants dot the river banks. All manner of food are to be found. Stroll along the riverbank for an unforgettable experience .
,,Good place for leisurely walks,4.0,,"We were staying in that area, so walking around Clarke Quay was our way of unwinding at the end of the day. With plenty of paces to eat and drink at, this seems to be quite a popular place with both tourists and local Singaporeans."
,,Always lots to see and do!,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is a colourful and vibrant entertainment, dining and shopping area located on both sides of the Singapore River. We try to ensure that we fit in a visit to Clarke Quay each time that we are in Singapore.
During our most recent short stay in Singapore, we managed to squeeze in yet another visit to Clarke Quay. As had been our previous experiences, during visits to Clarke Quay, the place was alive with people and colourful lighting during the early hours of the evening. We enjoyed a pleasant meal at a riverside cafe and then took a nice stroll around the quay to soak up some of the vibrant atmosphere.
Highly recommended as a place to visit for any tourist holidaying in Singapore!"
,,Nice spot to enjoy a drink,4.0,,"I had an afternoon off and made my way to Clarke Quay to have a bit of lunch. There are quite a few restaurants on the water with more bars and restaurants behind the waterfront, plenty to choose from. There was a modest range of cusines as well. I settled for a chinese restaurant (canr recall the name) and enjoyed a quiet beer soaking up the atmosphere with a bit of food. Some bars/restaurants play music a bit loud which spoiled things a little bit. There is a lot of older buildings here although the place does not feel old as there are a lot of modern addditions. Definitely worth a visit when in Singapore."
,,Night out in Singapore,4.0,,"If you are a Foodie and You like night life, then this is the place to be in Singapore. Have your dinner by the waterfront, have some magical ice cream, sway to the sound of grooving music...."
,,Restaurant,4.0,,We went here for our first diner in asia. Finding a place for diner is easy here. Very crowded but nice to look and to be seen. Queue for the entrace of a restaurant was new for us :-)
,,Great nighttime visit,4.0,,"A great place to eat, drink and people watch. The atmosphere after dark is a definite do for most types. Plenty of bars and restaurants serving all types of food"
,,Walk along day or night. Its alive,5.0,,During the day take a long walk along the river and enjoy the hustle and bustle of singapore. Come back at night for dinner a d its completely a different place. People food shops. Its alive. Very clean and safe. Food prices are high in this area but the quality of the food is good. MRT. Clarke Quay. Also uts a 10 min walk from China town.
,,Best by night,5.0,,"Great night life area. Good bars and restaurants. Travel up and down the river, enjoy the rides. Enjoy afew drinks at the restaurants and sit back and enjoy the music playing from speakers.....very festive."
,,Nice Area with Great Nightlife,4.0,,"I'm glad I went back to Clarke Quay by night as to be quite honest, I didn't think that much of it by day. It's okay I suppose but a bit dead and there are far nice and mote picturesque quays in Singapore.
In fairness though, it is really buzzing at night and has some great bars. The lights of the city, skyscrapers and neon and the reflection off the river make for a great atmosphere.
I still prefer Boat Quay but Clarke is a good option too, especially if you're out for the night!"
,,Ugly Place,1.0,,"Singapore has somehow destroyed what should be a nice part of the river. Ugly canopy, ugly plastic booth style outside eating areas and poor restaurants. It's hideous. Hideous. Singapore does not know when to stop and keep things simple. No. Throw money at things, put in theme park type attractions everywhere.......stop it. Go to East Coast Road (Katong area) for great atmosphere and food and NOT this ugly over priced mess."
,,If you can't find a good time here...,4.0,,"...you aren't going to find it!! The whole scene at Clarke Quay is a virtual smorgasbord of indoor and outdoor restaurants and bars on the canal that cover virtually every taste and specialty from low cost to high-end. There is live music at many places all along the canal so expect the volume to be pumped up as the night continues for the ongoing and growing throng of people that come looking for a good time. If you ever have that ""not sure what I feel like tonight but want to get out"" kind of night in Singapore you won't be disappointed by the outdoor experience and abundant options for food, drinks, music and people watching at the Quay."
,,Nice to walk by - not as spectacular as the ratings imply...,3.0,,"Clarke Quay is a cosy area and worth walking by. However, it's not as spectacular as the 4,5 average rating implies. We did not get to visit Clarke Quay at evening/night time, and I would recommend anyone that has the time do to so."
,,Nice place,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is one of the night attraction places to visit. Hang around the river with the boat all over, the kids very happy with it. Bar and resto at surrounding with a live band. And also we can enjoy the river with a famous Singapore Uncle ice cream which only cost SGD1.5"
,,Brilliant nightlife,5.0,,Nice place to relax and chill out by the river. Lots and lots of nice bars. Give Hooters a miss as its awful and expensive even by Singapore standards. Follow the happy hours like all the locals.
,,Caught the boat,4.0,,"Catch a boat, stroll and enjoy the architecture, have a drink or a meal. It's all here at Clark Quay and very easy to access from the CBD.."
,,Loving place to sit by at night,4.0,,"Clerk Quay is a lovely place to sit at night and watch the ferries and people, the ferries are a bit on the expensive side $25 each for about a 15 minute ride. Mostly Chinese and Japanese on these cruises didn't really many other people."
,,A beautiful and romantic place in Singapore,5.0,,"It is a very romantic place. Better go at night to see different lights lit on. It is very different from the harbour view of Hong Kong as it is so colourful with blue, purple, red and even green lights. If you travel with your loved one, you should not miss this place. If you have more time, better join the laser show cruise if possible. It is SGD 38 and SGD 22 for adults and kids respectively."
,,"Very expensive, similar to Darling Harbour, Sydney",2.0,,"We were told this was a must to visit but after a long walk we were sorely disappointed. The restaurants are extremely expensive. We found a steak restaurant where you cook your own on the hot stone and they wanted $99 a streak, so we gave that a miss. We ended up at Hooters which was terrible and over $250 which was ridiculous. Definitely did not enjoy this area at all. All the restaurants were expensive and definitely not family orientated. It was very much like Darling Harbour In Sydney which we don't like either. We found there to be no real atmosphere. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, especially if you have a family"
,,Relaxing drink,5.0,,I relax here.i order a drink and watching the boats come and go. It was so refreshing from a day of tiredness. You must visit this area.
,,Stunning view,5.0,,"The night view was stunning . Very impressive. You could have a drink the bar.many pubs and bar ,restaurants there. One of my favorite place."
,,Popular area with good restaurants.,4.0,,"We had a hotel in the Clarke Quay general area, and were pleased to find so many good restaurants within easy walking distance from the hotel,. And especially Clarke Quay Central. We went on a Sunday night, and the area was crowded with people out for a meal or socialising. Very good."
,,Go to Boat Quay instead,3.0,,"We went to Boat Quay first and then walked along the riverfront to the more famous Clarke Quay.
After Boat Quay we were a little underwhelmed by Clarke Quay and just stopped for Drink before continuing on our way.

It also apparently gets quite load and busy an night."
,,An amazing place to visit,5.0,,What an amazing place! So many dining/drinking venues plus street stalls. A must see for visitors of all ages - simply wander about and soak up the atmosphere. Best of an evening
,,Chill Vibes,5.0,,One of the most relaxing places to be . Just by sitting by the river and enjoying the views of this place can you relax you immediately. The night life is the most popping in this place and best if you are an avid drinker/club goer.
,,Great place for nightlife,5.0,,"Its an amazing place, good music,river by the side, have a quality time there and enjo to the fullest."
,,A joy ride for kids,4.0,,"A ride in the old Singapore style bumboats across Singapore river and Marina bay. It's a joy ride for the kids as it covers Boat Quay, Clarke Quay and Marina Bay. You would love the trip around the Marina bay. It's just beautiful. Start or end at Clarke quay with some good seafood restaurants! Don't forget to have the Turkish ice cream! Kids love the catching the cup game!"
,,Happening,5.0,,"A place to juat go after office, enjoy live music with a glass of a beer. Lot of people around to meet and share experiences."
,,Beautiful Nightlife,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is the go-to-place for experiencing Singapore's nightlife. It is a very vibrant area having amazing restaurants, pubs, dance clubs, street shows and much more. Once you are there, you will not be disappointed."
,,a must do!!!,5.0,,"We were staying at the Novotel, Clarke Quay. We loved being here, it was buzzing. The beautiful colour changing canopies, the fountains in the middle and air conditioning outside!!. Food was everything you could want, food from all around the world. Great Bars as well.
We visited Jumbo Seafood, where I had the chilli crab, needed gloves for this, Hot Stones, Wings, Quayside Seafood and a great burger place right in the centre. It wasn't cheap but nothing in Singapore is. We did looked for deals on buy one get one free cocktails and food (Hot Stones). We also eat inside the mall at a recommended street food place. the only place I didn't like was the Hot Pot."
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"The Quay is kind of interesting during the day with brightly coloured buildings and trips on the waterway, but it really comes alive at night.
Lights, noise tons of people and what seems like a endless number and variety of restaurants highlighted by neon in a series of twisting laneways - basically it's a case of a surprise around every corner, and there are many many corners in this compact space.
You can eat indoors or out at most places. We elected for Korean BBQ in the laneway and watched the nightlife laugh past us while we drank our beer and ate our fill.
Highly recommend the visit, even if it's not your thing you'll definitely have another thing to talk about when you return home"
,,Fantastic food and great views,5.0,,I loved the many bars and restaurants that are located in Clarke Quay and the views over the river are great day and night. The Tent restaurant is a must it is a cross of Chinese & Indian food done a Mongolian style
,,Sparkling!,5.0,,The night scenery around Clarke Quay is truly sparkling. The colours are resplendent and the ambience buzzing. Only thing lacking is a temperature drop of 10 deg C to drive away the warm and sweaty feeling.
,,Good mix of places to eat,4.0,,Clark Quay is one of the main areas where there is an abundance of restaurants in Singapore. Much of the focus is international food with restaurants featuring almost every region of the world and to cater for all tastes found there. I went there for lunch where most of the restaurants had a set $15 menu
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"Singapore is an amazing place to visit. Have been 6 times now and it changes every time. Gardens in the bay is well worth a visit, especially at night time when they have a firework display to music. Tells you all about the history of Singapore. Well worth a visit."

,,A must visit for experiencing Nightlife of Singapore,4.0,,"Mostly western tourist food with expensive drinks but still the most vibrant and exciting night life i have seen in Singapore,Give it a go.Most places have a happy hour from 5/6pm it's a vibrant area that is full of live music and fun.There number of good clubs/Lounge in the area and place is open until late."
,,Can't do Singapore without Clarke quay,5.0,,"Simply as the review title says if you've never been to Singapore and it's your first visit then you must do Clarke Quay particularly as the sun goes down, pubs bars clubs restaurants not necessarily too cheap, however something for everyone."
,,Great eating place,5.0,,Late Afternoon or Evening is the best time to go here. Go early as the selection of eating places and various happy hours need to be sussed out before choosing where to eat & drink.
,,A must for night life,4.0,,Most places have a happy hour from 5/6pm it's a vibrant area that is full of live music and fun. Mostly western tourist food with again expensive drinks. The most vibrant and exciting night life i have seen in my time in Singapore. Give it a go.
,,Great area!,5.0,,"Plenty of bars/restaurants but the only seem to open late afternoon which is frustrating as so many different establishments to try but not enough time. Plenty of different cuisines to try, bars to visit and nightclubs."
,,Busy place,3.0,,"Wide choice of restaurants there (Asian and western cuisines), many bars or pubs, but definitely too crowded and above all noisy. Music is set at full blast almost everywhere, even inside, so it really spoils your moments there as you cannot talk much.
Most of the people are youngsters having drinks and looking for company maybe, so we did not enjoy it that much.
Having said that, it is woh the walk along the river and for whomeever wants, there is also possibilty to dine on the river."
,,A neat place,4.0,,"I was here in the morning. It appears to be a night time area. Numerous restaurants, a few tourist activities are in the area. It's near the Coleman Bridge and old Hill Street Police Station."

,,Really nice night out!,5.0,,"The atmosphere is really nice and lively, particularly during weekends. Nice people, nice food, nice views, nice atmosphere... what more could you ask for?
It can get a little crowded, but still very nice. If you are into clubbing, this is one great place for it!"

,,Just enjoy the atmosphere,5.0,,"Just come to enjoy the atmosphere with everyone here. The place were just located next to the Singapore River, and well organize for clubbing and photo shooting at the night."
,,Warned but not deterred.,4.0,,"Gauzy neon atrophied first and then the underlying undulations. Time, stopped.

Wafted simulacra, insistent tannins.

How I'd gone on this long I didn't know. But there was nothing and no one to stop me now. Roman-a-clef dualism and threshold perceptions. The door knocked on but not yet opened.

I thought about it for a while before going back, not quite sure whether I wanted to face that again but knowing that I had no other choice, really."
,,Must visit at night - great atmosphere and restaurants,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is my favourite night-time spot in Singapore and I normally stay in that area. The quay-side dining variety is extensive, restaurant quality is very good and the entertainment is excellent. Great for singles, couples and families."
,,Good place to spend an evening BUT charm is waning,4.0,,"Great place to hangout after hrs with friends or colleagues for quick drink and bite. Offers array of options. However the charm is fast waning. Empty streets, empty bars tend to give a desolate feel to the place at time. Weekends might be best choice."
,,MuChos restaurant not so muchness,3.0,,"Pleasant atmosphere and weather was good for the occasion, Saturday 27 May 2017. Music, drinks and the like. Had a meal at Muchos. Tasty and reasonably priced but the drinks were disappointing. The tide was out on one beer by about 3 centimetres and I could not taste the tequila or the pineapple / coconut flavour in the pinna colada."
,,Bars and restaurants,4.0,,"Clarke Quay looks pretty at night and you can treat yourself to a boat ride, which probably isn't cheap. I had a drink and sat in one of the bars, seems to be a popular place at the weekend to unwind. Lots and lots of places to choose from, some with decent drinks deals, others without"
,,rainy day visit,4.0,,"We went on a hot rainy day in May. What we didnt realise is that it is primarily a night time venue so very few of the restaurants were open. Its a very pretty place but taking in the view by water is the better option. There are set lunches available at a very reasonable price, and no crowds either if you wish to visit in the day"
,,Clarke Quay at night,4.0,,"We visited at night, what a great atmosphere and prices ( by Singapore standards) were pretty reasonable. Lots to see and a big range of different restaurants to choose from. Not a 'touristy' as we'd expected, which was good."
,,Nice setting for bars and restaurants,5.0,,"Went here a couple of times during our stay in Singapore Lots going on, wide variety of restaurants and bars to choose from Prices weren't to high for the area Really enjoyed each place we went to"
,,Never ending fun,5.0,,"WoooooWwww place to be in Singapore for night out lovers. Lots of bar, clubs, sit out areas. HOWEVER if you want to have real fun in strict budget, follow BYOB n enjoy to the fullest. Amazing place and free music coming to your ears from all around."
,,Exploring nightlife in singapore,5.0,,"Wanted to explore nightlife in singapore and went to Clarke. It's a happening place with lots of bars, clubs. Wanted to go to ftv club but they allow only couple entry."
,,A must in Singapore,4.0,,"I alway go here when I am in town. I love the buzz and the fuzz going on. All you will ever dream of in food and drinks. Several good hotels located near and also near to public transport. Only setback is the general price level, which is high. But by all means go there!"

,,Nice location for dinner,4.0,,Plenty of restaurants and bars and a nice location on the river makes this a good choice for a night out.
,,Singapores Nightlife,5.0,,"Given Singapores highly regulated nature which includes a 'sin tax' for alcohol I was quite surprised to find such a vibrant nightlife scene in the heart of the city. We travelled to Clarke Quay on the North-East line, getting off at the Clarke Quay station. We came here at night and ate at one of the seafood restaurants (Jumbo seafood restaurant). I was surprised at the number of bars and presence of live music which was fantastic. There are significant penalities for public drinking in singapore although perhaps it isn't enforced so tightly here as people were openly consuming convenience store liquor on the bridge. Alcohol is expensive by Australian standards but isn't too exorbiant. I had a good time here and I would recommend other tourists come here at night for a drink or two."

There were bars open for happy hour and snacks - but food options were minimal.

We walked around for an hour, had a few drinks but were hungry so we left.

So the lesson is go there later - I assume around 8pm would be the earliest you should try"
,,"Top spot, top food",5.0,,Great little find. We shared a few tapas plates which was more than enough. Alcohol prices were reasonable. Food prices were good and the food was very tasty.

,,Bustling area with restaurants and bars,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is a bustling neighborhood along riverside. It has lots of restaurants and bars, along with stores.

At daytime its not as busy as night time. It looked like it is major destination for expats and locals alike for their pubs and bars while they watch their favorite sports on the evening.

When we visited on a Saturday evening, there was a live band playing on the center stage. The place was really full with people.

We came to Clarke Quay by the wsy of the River Cruise, so it is quite beautiful to see all the lights from businesses along the river at night.

Overall do visit it for a nice meal, would be fun."

It's a good size and no way did I see or even visit a handful of the places there. Live music in some places and good DJ's in others. A water feature in the middle that young children were around around in as well. Most of the places have happy hours that finish around 9pm. I highly recommend this area for a night out or dinner with a good atmosphere!
,,Something/Some time for everyone,4.0,,"I visited here during the day time and wasn't sure what to expect knowing that it really came to life at night.

,,Fantastic location,4.0,,"I wasn't sure what to expect when arriving here but I was pleasantly surprised!! This place has every cuisine under the roof; Thai, Chinese, Mexican, American style, Irish etc. Mixed in are some bars/pubs and nightclubs.

If you are sea food lover, you can easily find tasty see food. Evening is the perfect time to be here."
,,iconic landmark in singapore,4.0,,"The riverside Clarke Quay and Boat Quay districts is a buzzy area full of restos and discos where locals and expats intertwine. The live music scene is noteworthy with multitude of disco-bars starting by Clarke Quay’s Crazy Elephant bar and continuing with Cuba Libre Café & Bar if you like Latin music.

But throughout Singapore that is not the case and Clarke Quay is a good example of Singapore's desire to show the world that a good night life is a part of having a good life.
,,Getting worse,3.0,,"Been to this place every time I've been in Singapore the last years. This place is sure getting worse.
Prices are much higher, while service is getting worse. And it's getting more or less into a tourist trap.
But if you'rein Singapore for the first time, justgo for a walk thereto see what's the fuzz is all about... if you have time..."
,,Good place to go for dinner and drinks but a bit pricey!,4.0,,Don't get there too early... from about 6.30pm onwards a good atmosphere. Great lighting when sun goes down.

,,Last Night in Singapore - group of 11 pax,5.0,,A great bar and night life district from restaurants on the water to bars and clubs in the many streets intercepting the banks. Lots of people all the time and great atmpshere
,,Went here with high hopes.,2.0,,"Sadly not a lot here for us, lots of expensive places to eat and none of them that appealing to us. Had a walk down both sides and I have to say it was very uneventful, so we basically got the train back out again. A waste of time for us but you may think differently, if you visit. Oh and went for an ice cram and they had the oddest flavours, so off we went. Aww well."

,,Great view,4.0,,Many restaurant can be found here. Price range from low to high . Cool view though . Use sunburn coz the weather in singapore is damn hot ...
,,Lively but forgettable (and pretty expensive),3.0,,"Clarke Quay seems to be very popular with tourists and expats more than locals and though the are has plenty of bars, restaurants, clubs and cafes and is very lively in the evening, it manages to be a bit characterless with a vaguely shopping mall / airport lounge vibe (except for the river and the heat).
And most places tend to be pretty expensive and not exactly worth the money."
,,A evening of life time,5.0,,"Visiting Singapore is a odd combination of business & leisure. Clarke quay makes it an evening of life time. The are many bar/pub restaurant that you can choose. The evening is so well spirited with combination of any spirit and sea food. The hangout options are many as well ranging from stags, galz, family and the list is on n on n on.

Most of the area is undercover, so don't let the weather put you off."

It was easy enough to fight a place for a food - plenty of choice!
We went to VLV for food - incredibly good. We stayed for a drink after food in there club to. We then went on to the Irish bar where we stayed for a while and watched the rugby (they have all sports on). We then went on to the Huntsman - great live music bar!

,,Vibrant and entertaining,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is one of our favorite places in Singapore. Situated along the river, it offers an endless choice of picturesque outdoor cafes and restaurants serving every kind of food imaginable. Its vibrant night life provides the perfect place to relax and enjoy a drink with friends. Bumboats ply the river, stopping at colorful jetties on both sides.

The Elgin Bridge provides a good vantage point from which to take pictures of Clarke Quay. If you prefer a quieter atmosphere, cross over Elgin Bridge and stroll along the riverbank on the Boat Quay side. Follow the path that leads to the Coleman Bridge. After enjoying views of the river from the bridge, circle back to Clarke Quay. If bungee jumping is your thing, stop by at G-Max Reverse Bungey along the way. No doubt about it – Clarke Quay provides it all!"
,,another option to hangout in singapore,4.0,,"I went to clarke quay on evening, I walked around, here are a lot of restaurant ,cafe or bar and finally I took dinner in one of restaurant, for the price is expensive but anyway when you waiting your menu order coming, you can seeing the boat that crosses the river also you can heard live music from some of cafe's there. In another side, when I went there, they have one attraction is riding bicycle on a rope and this attraction open for general visitors."
,,A welcome oasis,4.0,,"Arrived here early in morning, but our luggage was taken care of and we sat beside the pool until our room was available. We were unable to find out where to get drinks, which would have been nice.
Little information was given as to where breakfast was served, and the signs to various parts of the hotel were few and far between.
The porterage was wonderful and taxis, appeared as if by magic... couldn't fault the attention given.
Breakfasts were good, once we had found the venue, and the rooms were cool, clean and comfortable. Recommended"
,,Vibrant and Colourful,4.0,,A beautiful part of the city that has plenty of riverside shops and shops all with a higher price range than elsewhere in the city due to location. Still a pretty area to visit.
,,Love Love this place,5.0,,"Absolutely my top place to visit in Singapore. Love just sitting and watching the hussel and bussel of this place. So much to see, eat, drink. So many different cultures. Photographers dream."
,,Nightlife in Singapore,4.0,,"Although we were here on a Tuesday night, the atmosphere was no less electrifying. A mind boggling selection of restaurants, concept bars and buzzing nightlife can offer you an after sunset indulgence. I guess since it was close to the financial district we saw a lot of office crowd enjoying their meals here. The lights ,music and choice of food was perfect ."
,,One of the Liveliest place of Singapore,5.0,,The place goes Lively at night with streets full of locals and tourists along with multiple eating joints in the place. Beautiful fountain in the center of this place makes it more beautiful. A small river is there wherein Dinner in Boat can be an option. Must go place for every tourist. Your tour operator will not guide you such place because he will suggest you to go on Dinner Cruise because it is paid and he is going to earn from that. But i can assure you that this place is much better than a going on a dinner cruise.
,,Vibrant,5.0,,"This is the place to be at night.
It's does get seriously busy !!
Lots of bars and restaurants to choose from.
Lots going on until the early hours.
Lots of live music, sport on the tv's
Lots of different choices of food on offer
Highly recommend"
,,Nice area but a rip off,1.0,,Ate and drank in two places which were awful. Very expensive and poor quality. Advise anyone that visits to have a walk around but do not have anything there. Go to China town or little India for meals and drinks.
,,Go on a guided Tour,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is very interesting. I went on a guided tour and learned alot about the history of Singapore including ""Raffles"" , Reseviours, Trading Routes etc.... Shopping and Restauraunts are abundant from the Quay"
,,amazing plce,5.0,,love spending my evenings across the quay for dinner and drinks. everyone there was wonderful. the people in Singapore are amazing people with an amazing culture
,,Great location with action for the kids and great food and dining options,4.0,,We arrived around 8pm and our teenage kids did the reverse bungy at student rates of $35 each (bring student ID). Then went up to the main area along Clarke and Read St. Very funky area with modern bars and pubs most with live music and happy hour drinks until 9pm. Well worth the visit during the evening and the dining areas are under cover.
,,Touristy jumble of bars,1.0,,"One of the desk agents at our hotel, suggested we visit this area for a nice dinner, not knowing the area we expected much better when we arrived. Typical tacky tourist area where the focus is on drinking next to the water. It was like going to an urban downtown city where young adults want to let things go. For Singapore, you have much finer options including the luxury hotels in the middle of the city. I would not recommend this area at all."
,,Great Night Out,5.0,,"I met some girlfriends out in Clark Quay, Singapore last weekend and what an experience. Lots of energy and fun things to do. Great music with different bars and restaurants along the river. If your in Singapore and want a fun night I highly recommend this place."

A great collection of bars and restaurants all in one easy to navigate area. Also lots of places have live music. So it's easy to stroll around until you find one that suits you. Also sports bars and some higher end eateries."
,,Very classy,4.0,,"We liked this area. It is quiet during the day, but alive in the evenings. There are lots of restaurants, a bit more expensive than Orchard Road though, but nice. There is live music and entertainment here in the evenings as well. This area lies on the edge of the river and you can take a river cruise all along the river from here too."
,,Amazing Day Or Night,4.0,,"One of fantastic place to be seen in Singapore day or night and really you will enjoy your time with family a lot of cafe and resturant with amazing water view or you can have a cruise with kids
You can have also shopping or walking and catch one of the bridges to walk on"
,,"Nightlife in Singapore, but it's really expensive!",4.0,,"Lots of places to dine and drink here. This is where the nightlife in Singapore is, but it's very expensive to have a drink, so do keep that in mind. It's a nice walk by the river, taking in the sights and sounds."
,,"Clarke quay , nightlife in Singapore",5.0,,"It was my first night at Singapore so after check-In in hotel I went there by MRT, it was next to station , perfect place for nightlife ."
,,Very quiet during the day,2.0,,We went to find one particular restuarant for lunch and unfortunately it had closed. We chose somewhere else and had a nice meal but overall there was no atmosphere in the daytime.
,,Great Location and Awesome Opportunities to Shop and Dine,4.0,,"Our hotel is right in the Clarke Quay area (across from the metro stop NE5 for Clarke Quay), and so we went walking along the River area. There are, of course, many shopping areas and LOTS of food and beverage establishments! While this is certainly a popular area for tourists, you'll see that the locals also spend a lot of time here."
,,Great fun,5.0,,"We'd visited Singapore 25 years ago when Clarke Quay was just starting up and there were no more than a handful of restaurants. Nowadays it's an incredibly popular area packed with bars, clubs, brewpubs and restaurants of all description. We had intended to visit other neighbourhoods of the city during our 5 night stay, but we somehow never got further than Clark Quay. Be prepared to pay top dollar for your food and drink, but several places have a Happy Hour which softens the blow a little. We stayed at the Park Hotel which was a ten-minute stroll."
,,Great Hangout Place!,5.0,,"At Clarke Quay there are many bars and restaurants and a lot of good vibe.
Went there with friends in the evening and we had a great time sitting in a U.S airforce base called wings bar.
Alcohol is pretty expensive, but it's the singapore expensive.
There is also a cieling that covers the place from the rain.
A must see."
,,Beautiful place - a must see!,4.0,,"This area of Singapore is gorgeous!
With the river running through and restaurants lined up ... there is something for everyone! When we finished eating and we're leaving, the sun had set, everything was lit up and it was beautiful!
Be sure to go there for an evening dinner!"
,,Fantastic!!,5.0,,"One of the most happening night life in the world I guess. This is awesome some old wear houses converted into to the most happening pubs in Singapore. Very thing was great music, people, very organised, lively full of life n vibrance. A must go for all. Just n experience. Its open till 4-5am."
,,Good but pricey if you wanna buy anything,3.0,,nice place with best fare city has to offer. decent vibe. many snooty people worse so the staff at eating places. good for short walk around and some nice photos.
,,the party district,4.0,,"we spent new year's eve here and headed for the fireworks after. This place gets as good as it gets for having a great time, good food, by the river, clean, live performances, disc's and pubs of every kind. and happy hours till 8. Loved it!"
,,Went to my dentist and had great food after,5.0,,"My dentist is at B1-01, Tooth Angels! The best dentist I have seen - Dr Chia does Wisdom Teeth surgery that is painless, with quick recovery due to his exclusive method of surgery and stitching.

After my 6 monthly dental checkup, I went upstairs to #01-15, Kings & Barrels, and the food was delicious!
They have live bands, all local Singaporean bands, and a fun dj to boot.

Highly recommended!"
,,Expensive and touristy,3.0,,"Real mixed bag of bars and restaurants here. Some friendly some rude, all expensive. Nice location and good overall atmosphere though"
,,Nightlife,4.0,,"A great place packed with pubs, restaurants, clubs and many more. Every single night plenty of tourists and local people will be there. A little expensive but in Singapore it's something normal"
,,Ok but...,3.0,,"This is location ok to check out as one of the sights on the map, but don't expect anything unique, just really more of the same, but all a little run down and in need of a good clean, which is unusual for Singapore. Perhaps it is the focus on bars and restaurants that bring life after dark. The mall is more of the same, and there are better malls in Singapore... so if you are after bars and restaurants go here, but you will need to make a reservation at some... all in all ok, but ..."
,,Must visit in night,5.0,,"After a whole day work, lot of local and tourist people proceed towards this place. It is full of pubs, restaurants, boating, dancing and many other activity. It is centrally located. In night this place is really alive."
,,"Visit at night for views, entertainment and sights / music.",4.0,,"Visit at night for great views, live music, river cruises, every restaurant you can think of. He night river cruise is worth the money."
,,Nice quiet place,5.0,,we did a boat trip up the river and learnt about the history of Singapore and the history of the Quay ..the houses and shops along the shores are very nice and plenty of restaurants
,,Attractions of Singapore - Clarke Quay,5.0,,"The ideal place for urban explorers to hang out with friends and colleagues.
The Place is crowded with professionals and tourists alike.
Check out the place for the following reasons:
- Plenty of Pubs serving mainstream (carlsberg, tiger, asahi) and draft beers (liquor is expensive in SG though)
- Lots of interesting food joints all across the river valley (try sea foods from local, thai, indonesian and indian restaurants)
- The River walk leading up to the merlion is a must for the energy and vibe it presents
- Try out the bungee and boat ride if interested

-"
,,Luxurious,4.0,,"I personally didn't drink or dine here but walked around, it's certainly beautiful at night and there is plenty of choice. Great vibes but prepare to pay a large bill!"
,,Dinner,5.0,,Sashi was very gracious and made sure that my Guinness was always full. The traditional fare made it difficult to choose but went with the Irish Burger. Excellent! Stop in for a great experience
,,Fun at Night,5.0,,"While in Singapore, wander over to Clarke Quay. It is full of shops, hotels, restaurants (try the Chili Crab!), bars, nice waking paths along the water and boat rides. We go at night since it is cooler and the lights on the high rise buildings and hotels shine. Try a boat ride around the harbor which can be narrated or not and do it when the fire works show is scheduled. Taxi stands are easy to find. Try it."
,,"Interesting venue for eating, drinking and having fun",4.0,,"I was staying at a nice hotel near the business district and Chinatown and wanted to go for a short walk one evening and discover another part of this fascinating city. I was pleasantly surprised to walk into the Clarke Quay area quite quickly. It was early evening but the place was already quite vibrant with the many bars, pubs, restaurants and cafeteria. There was live music at some of the bars which you could enjoy also from outside. And the brightly illuminated boats on the river were chugging backwards and forwards with the partying clientele.

Such a nice place to get some atmosphere and wile away the time with an entertaining evening."
,,Awesome Night Experience,5.0,,The place offers splendid nightlife. Amazing eateries and loud music. It is fun packed and the river cruise is lovely. Must go place in Singapore
,,Great night life!,4.0,,"Very spectacular setting once the sun goes down and the light come on.
Don't be bullied into walking into the first restaurant, walk the entire stretch to see what all is on offer.
The river cruises also lovely - peaceful now that the boats are battery operated"
,,Great pulse but expensive,4.0,,"A great place to stay while in Singapore as the best nighttime excitement seems to be here.

My tips-
shopping is probably better left to orchard road
$$$- even a basic, pretty ordinary tasting meal at one of the bars or river/ nearby restaurants will set you back more than the equivalent back home (for me, Australia ). Stick to the food halls on the bottom of any mall if you are on a budget.
- vibrant at night, not much happens in Clarke quay during the day making it a good place for a quiet drink or book by the water, but definitely not as a stand alone day time visit"
,,Buzzing Nightlife,5.0,,"Really buzzing over the weekends.. the lounges and restaurants by the Singapore river are really amazing with lots to offer people from food to live music!

It was a wonderful experience and would definitely recommend this for couples or friends looking for a great night out!"
,,"""A place where you can experience a lot.""",5.0,,"Going to Clarke Quay is so easy with riding the MRT and alighting at the Clarke Quay Station which is connected to the Clarke Quay Central Mall.

INSIDE THE CLARKE QUAY CENTRAL MALL:
If I remember correctly, only 3-4 floors are dedicated for the mall. The mall itself is smaller compared to the other malls I've been to in SG. I was disappointed to stroll around as some of the boutiques closes as early as 5pm. With the very few boutiques to check out from, I haven't bought any here. As for the foodcourt area, since the mall is small, it only has a few selection. Good thing that you can eat in the restaurants outside; just be ready to spend but if you're on a budget you can go to a nearby mall which is just a walking distance from this mall.

As soon as you stepped out of the mall, you're already in the SINGAPORE RIVER because it's just a few steps from the mall. Going here in the late afternoon is best so you can see the beauty around and you can feel the cool breeze of the river. I can't believe that back in the 1970's, the river is horribly dirty. The best time to do a river cruise is during the sunset until the time it darks so you can see the beauty of the places around with and without lighting. The fee for a roundtrip boat ride is $25/pax. On your cruise, you can see the Marina Bay Area. You can also alight here if you wish too so you don't need to ride a cab or MRT just to get there.

CLARKE QUAY RIVERSIDE RESTAURANTS:
It is best to visit this place at night time because this is a place where you can drink and dine with your family or friends. Dining at one of the restaurants beside the river is a unique experience as you can feel the cool air at night, enjoy the great music around and mesmerized with the lights around. One of the most famous place here is the Hooters but this is not recommended for a group with kids, otherwise, a couple can enjoy dining in one of the fine dining restos here. This is also the best place where you can meet people of different races."
,,Food and Drink,5.0,,Always stay near Clarke Quay when visiting Singapore on business. Really good choice of restaurants and bars and a real happening area any day of the week.
,,Fun place to be late into the night!,4.0,,"Clarke quay (clarkee..they say).Great atmosphere, amazing set of bands with an even better collection of songs, perfect for all ages! Night life is great, neat and comfortable ambience!"
,,Fantastic atmosphere,4.0,,"Fantastic atmosphere, expensive food, this area is brilliant for going out at night when you don't have to be careful about money. I guess this is true for Singapore in general.

We just wished that there had been a bit more variety, price wise. But every restaurant and bar is expensive and every restaurant and bar adds a service charge and tax.

But walking around is a must."
,,Nice but touristic,4.0,,"Nice to visit in the evening when you want to go out for some food and a drink.

But be aware, this id's not the real Singapore! This is a place to go out for tourists. Very crowed and expensive with a lot of noise / music..."
,,Neat pub atmosphere,4.0,,"Have a feeling that this is the best pub area in Singapore, it is covered on the top but still giving you an outdoor feeling. It is an attraction point for both locals and tourists in the evenings, almost all places have happy hour option. It would have been an easily 5 stars if there were more options for international kitchen."
,,Happening place,3.0,,Good place for evening hangout with variety of foods and restaurants. Must visit place in Singapore.
,,great place,5.0,,"went to singapore few weeks ago,highly recommended clarke quay. it was a raining day but still can have some nice photo with family.it is a great place"
,,Buzzing atmosphere,5.0,,We went here at New Year and all bars and clubs were absolutely jumping. Very very busy which made it difficult to order drinks at times. Really enjoyed our night and returned the following when less busy. Lots of places to chose from and can hop from one to another.
,,Lively place during evening,5.0,,"I went on Saturday evening and there was lot of crowd. With all the illumination, the place was looking more lively. There were free belly dancing sessions going on next to the stadium near Clarke Quay. Lots of street food options are available near by. You can also go for boating in the river. This place is famous among tourists and locals, both."
,,Great place for a break from shopping,5.0,,Clarke Quay is a haven in the middle of the city. Try the boat trip for 25sd to see another view of the city. Great place for lunch and in the evening it is a great spot for a drink.
,,Great place,5.0,,"A very vibrant place full of restaurants, bars and night clubs. It's overlooking a river where you can take some boat trips . Lots of live bands. It's open till 2am during workdays and for later during weekend as I understood. You can get all sorts of restaurants and most of the serving excellent food."
,,Cool place to quickly visit and have lunch/dinner,3.0,,Not a place I would try go back to. Not much to do there really apart from dinner and/or lunch. Was cool to see it at night and if you want to you can take a boat up the river to the marina bay. We did have a great dinner there so would defiantly go try something there for food. Seemed good prices to!
,,Lively little food and nightlife hub,4.0,,"One of the happening places in SG, loads of restaurants across all genres and few nightclubs. Many of the restaurants and bars feature live music and fun activities... The atmosphere is really fun here, good place to get wasted and enjoy the night.

There is also reverse bungee in this place, didn't go for it myself."
,,Definitely recommend for a nice dinner and coctails with live music..,5.0,,Great dinner options afterwards around 11 all bars opened and live music started in many bars.. definitely recommend for a nice night!
,,Lovely and lively,5.0,,"Everything you want is here. Fun noise party live music, various types of food, sit down places and above all classy crowd. You feel safe here and there is something for the family to do. Walk around, listen to live music , take a little river side or just see the strange sights. It's got it all going. It's as classy as it was many years ago when I was here. I would say come and Clarke quay in singapore"
,,Great place to hangout,5.0,,Clarke Quay is one of the best place to hangout in Singapore. It has great bars and night clubs. The place is filled with restaurants (both costly and economical). We visited the place around 2 times in our 6 days trip.
,,"Great bars, restaurants",4.0,,"Stayed in Clarke Quay for New Years after a cruise. Not much happening during the day but at night it seems the place to be. The lighting and amount of people around every night creates a great atmosphere. Had a sensational NYE, no signs of violence or anyone being a pain, just thousands of people out to enjoy themselves. A venue here for everyone regardless of age etc. Will be back, hopefully for Chines NY one year."
,,Great place for food and a night out,5.0,,"Clarke quay Is an area located with many restaurants, bars and clubs. In the day, you can enjoy delicious up scale food from many ethnicities such as Persian, Japanese, local ""Zi Char"" etc. It offers scenic river rides but the area is beautiful enough on its own.

At night, the party goers start arriving and activities continue till after midnight.

The area also have 2 malls and a train station"
,,LenR,4.0,,"This place has a great atmosphere, we felt it more during the evening, when everything comes alive, the waterfront is lit up and all the restaurants are buzzing with people. Can't fault this place walk round and take it all in. You can take the boat from here to cruise up the river."
,,Historic and interesting,4.0,,"At some time in your Singapore stay you should visit Clarke Quay and see some of the old buildings and iron bridges from the colonial era. There are many riverside bars and restaurants, some of which have happy hours. It is easy to get to and from metro stations. It is actually not too far to walk to from Orchard Road. Chinatown is also within walking distance."
,,Vibrant place,4.0,,This place is full of bars and restaurants and is a very vibrant place to be in. We were there on a Monday and even then we could see a lot of people. You have lot of spaces to walk around the waterbody. The bars are little pricey though.
,,Serenity with colors,5.0,,"Stroll along the Singapore river with its many outdoor cafes and bars. Bustling with mostly young pedestrians and tourists it is a good place to hang out on a lazy sunday afternoon.

There are various shops in nearby Liang Court as well as Clarke Quay mall. Chinatown is within walking distance. Public transport easily available eg train, buses, taxi."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The only place in singapore that made me feel in a different country/environment was there. Loved how living this place was with all bars, live music, restaurants and people around."
,,"Fun idea, overpriced",3.0,,"I'm married to a foodie, so he was overjoyed to find a place that was just restaurants. Great concept, but the restaurants that we tried had average food with above average price tags. Go during happy hour and eat somewhere else."
,,Night life,4.0,,"This is the place where it's most happening at night. There are a numbers of clubs and pubs along the river, not forgetting restaurants as well. There is this catapult ride right at the corner. I believe one can also enjoy a leisure cruise ride along the river as well."
,,Lots of restaurants,4.0,,We went to for a walk along the river and Clark Quay has an abundance of restaurants offering all types of food. This is where you go to do the river cruise
,,Clark Quay's show stealer is The Noir,5.0,,"If you are looking for some good fun (specially as a couple or with friends and even alone!) then Clarke Quay is the place to be. Walking distance from Boat Quay, CQ is a hub for music and drinks and is an all night party place in Singapore. You would specially enjoy The Noir (the half open bar) which has inside and outside seating. The singer has a lovely voice and good choice of songs people swoon an dance on. Make sure you drink slowly. The place earns good points on variety and the overall show all pubs put up. You are sure to enjoy your first few trips here, after which it can feel mundane and you may feel like going elsewhere."
,,Fantastic spot with so much on offer at night,5.0,,"What a fabulous place, very busy at night. It is lit up beautifully with so many lights. First night I just sat and had a drink and watched the lights, went for dinner twice and had lunch.
There are so many restaurants and bars and live music, it makes it a little hard to choose (but in a good way)
A vibrant place with so much on offer. If visiting Singapore I would highly recommend this spot."
,,Excellent nightlife,4.0,,"We have visited Clarke Quay numerous times as it's a great place to eat. This time we were staying at the Novotel which basically sits on top of Clarke Quay. The area is famous for its nightlife & restaurants so it's best to visit at night.

It's very easily accessible by boat, bus or the MRT. The historical buildings mostly restored warehouses are very interesting now converted into nightclubs.

Singapore river cruise operates & laser show cruises are accessible from Clarke Quay & river taxi service is also available."
,,"Nice atmosphere, sea of lights in the evening, live music",4.0,,"there are different bars and restaurants offering different kind of food, great for sitting outside, bars with great live music. As there are a lot of bars very close to each other, it can get really loud, so choose your location considering if you rather want to have a dinner and talk, or if it can get loud while you're having a drink. Even if Clarke Quay is nothing super special or unique, I absolutely enjoyed the evening, the view and the music - would go there again anytime when visiting Singapore"
,,An Evening Out,4.0,,"Excellent place which is easily accessible by MRT or bus. Best to go for a dinner and then opt for other activities later on. But if you are doing the reverse bungee then do that BEFORE dinner!
There are plenty of restaurants catering to almost any type of cuisine, all located among the renovated warehouse which have been part of the river for as long as one can remember.
Before dinner you can shop at nearby shopping centers or simply hang around and enjoy the scenic view as the sun sets. If you have a little time you can try riding one of the old fashioned bumboats that now cater to tourists and locals.
After dinner, choose to have drinks in one of the many bars or catch some live music or dance the night away. There is even a Kareoke studio on one of the second levels.
All in all its good fun whether you are there as a couple, a family, or with a group of friends.
Just a word of caution, try to avoid taxis that ask for a fixed fare to ferry you, they appear in the wee hours of the morning when people are light headed. This practice is illegal. Always insist on a metered fare, or use Uder or Grab."
,,Great place to shop or eat,4.0,,"Along the river, several shops, sites and places to eat in the heart of Singapore. Minutes away from several other sites and easily accessible by subway too !"
,,Exciting Clarke Quay,5.0,,"Upon our arrival we had checked into the Novatel Hotel which is 1 minute walk to Clarke Quay.
During the day its nice and quiet so you can easily enjoy a nice lunch and enjoy the view that it has to offer.
Go back during the evening and the atmosphere has changed to no end, the place is buzzing with all the bars and eateries packed with customers and a great place to walk around and enjoy.
If you are looking for something to eat the best way is to have a good look around before you take a seat, and if its packed with a line up you know the food is good.
Go somewhere quiet and be like us and be let down dramatically with a very poor meal.
Just take it all in and enjoy a great place to be."
,,Amazing Place...,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is an amazing place to walk, grab some food and spend some hours specially @ evening!!!.
It can be accessed using the metro (MTR) and there is a cheap boat tour you can take from there that show the beautiful night and illuminated buildings of Singapore.
Cheap and Beautiful attraction. Will definitely go again!"
,,Excellent place,4.0,,"Nice place for a romantic walk, nice riverside walk... Both side of the river have diff typenof experience... You will enjoy drink here as well."
,,Lovely spot in the evening,4.0,,"Wonderful spot to grab some dinner, drinks, and people watch! It’s located right along the river, so it’s nice a nice spot to unwind after a long day. There are tons of restaurants, bars, and cafes to choose from. For those who like a more active take, it’s also a wonderful spot to go for a jog - just keep following the river and you’ll wind up someplace nice.

It’s kind of touristy, but there appeared to be a large expat community here too - or maybe I just caught it during happy hour so everyone was out and about.

You can also catch the river cruise here too that will take you out to Marina Bay and the waterfront.

Side tip: I would recommend checking it out in the evening. It’s quite pretty when all the lights come on."
,,Nice place to spend an evening,4.0,,We took the MRT to Clarke quay and its walking distance from the MRT. Lot of restaurants and cafes around the riverside. You can spend around 30-40 minutes by the riverside and enjoy the hustle and bustle. We ate some tacos at Senor Tacos. Not many vegetarian options but lively place to to enjoy some good music and drinks. The river cruise is a good option too.
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"There are plenty of cafes , restaurants and bars River side just makes it more beautiful There is a lot of hustle n bustle, live music etc You can also get a river cruise ride from here My fav place in singapore"
,,Best at night.,3.0,,Great place for restaurants and bars. Night visit is definitely the way to go to take in the lively atmosphere.
,,Great for a diner evening,5.0,,"Great restaurants, great for dinner with friends or business partners. In December and January it is not so hot and humid, just very nice and enjoyable."
,,"Overrated, overpriced and Over it",2.0,,"We stayed in signapore for two nights near circual quay and went there of a meal and drinks. Well that was a lesson in how to charge. Not really a good meal either. We tried the boat which went around the quay and for 25 each for a 40minute trip it was a waste of time.
Personally I don't rate signapore. Very expensive and not a real lot to do there."
,,Lively but Costly,3.0,,"Great little area with plenty of bars, restaurants and cafes all with a great atmosphere. Some look onto the water and others have good music and entertainment, but in general it is overpriced and not worth the value."
,,Good places to spend your evening,4.0,,"I arrived at this place around 4pm, and not much things I can do here, since all the resto and pub are still preparing their table. You can visit the mall across the river if you get there early. Spend some time sitting by the river while enjoying ice cream is one option that you can have after strolling around Singapore with sun shine bright during the day"
,,A Great area for Dinner,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is definitely one of the night spots of Singapore and worth a visit for dinner one night. There are ample restaurants to choose from so no need to book anything. Its a very lively and vibrant scene with lots happening.
From here the River cruises leave - this is well worth doing - either before of after dinner."
,,Electric,4.0,,"Well, it is an extremely popular and equally expensive waterfront destination. Lined with the best of restaurants as well as entertainment, Clarke Quay is a must go place on every Singapore tourist.

Great for dining as well as live music and clubbing. Priced in a higher side, be sure to chose your outlet well."
,,Great way to see the city from the water,4.0,,"We spent a few days in Singapore for business. We took the two day hop on, hop off tour bus for two days and were able to see the whole city and plan our visits better as a result. One evening we went to the river area and had a nice dinner along he water. Then we walked to Clarke Quay and took a water taxi to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. Definitely worth the trip; there are multiple enjoyable views, great ambiance and it is faster than taking a regular taxi. Recommended."
,,Nightlife,5.0,,"We walked around here and along the water after eating at chili's and drinking at cafe iguana, there's plenty of nightclubs and restaurants open till late... drinks in Singapore are very expensive even with the deals they offer. Cannot wait to go on the river cruise from here"
,,Good bars and restaurants and atmosphere,4.0,,A bit calmer and in my opinion better the Boat Quay for the over 40's. Its still very lively and has a great buzz
,,Beautiful architecture,4.0,,This is a lovely place to walk along the bank of the canal (river?) and stop for a beer or two. Disappointed to see the appearance of a Hooters since I've last visited but the place is still nice and there are less trashy places to grab a cold beer!
,,Nice and tasty,5.0,,You will go there anyway because its near many other activities and attractions. Its beautiful place with great food and great atmosphare. We loved it
,,The place situated in heart of the city and is alive whole night,4.0,,WOW. I go there for pub crawl/hopping. The place is full of clubs which are open till 4AM. Most of them are little pricey which goes well with SIngapore standards.
,,Top Notch Night Life,5.0,,"Full of life. It's filled up with restaurants, bars, disco, pubs. Somehow the food and drinks can be a little bit more expensive than any other places."
,,A Good place to visit at night.,4.0,,This is a good place to visit at night. There are plenty of restaurants and drinks in this area. In the day time this place is actually very quiet. So if you're looking for a night life then this is the place for it.
,,Late Night Attraction,4.0,,This is the right place for you who wants to spend your night by drinking beer and have a small snack while chatting with friends and accompanied by live music all the night long. There are so many type of bar you could visit and with an amazing view along the riverside.
,,Fun all night long,5.0,,"Best place to drink , music, dance, fun and walk around in Singapore. Life is start after 10 pm in there . You can find lovely live music in here."
,,Return visit,5.0,,"We stayed at this hotel on our stopover between NZ and London. We had stayed here at the start of our holiday too. We were greeted like old friends and Afiq made a real effort to help us when he could. Our flight was late at night, so the hotel staff made sure we could have a late check out of 3pm. We had a whole day visiting the sites in Singapore. We were hot and tired by the time we got back to the hotel ready for our transfer to the airport, we had checked out at 3pm, it was now 8pm. We were offered a room so that we could shower and change - what joy!"

,,See the city from the River,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a must-see if you're in Singapore. Wonderfully coloured buildings, plenty of restaurants and bars and the best place to get the bum-boat for a cruise around the river. The river cruise came with an informational audio talk so I learned plenty about the city. Always busy here and seems to be open 24/7! Loved it here and will always visit when in Singapore."
,,A bit for everyone,4.0,,"Nice area for casual stroll, casual dining or casual drinks along the river. The temperature around here settles quite a bit on the afternoon which makes for good place to hang out in at night."
,,Just plain Fun!!!,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is just a fun place...lots of shops, tons of restaurants...grab a brew and some fries and people watch. Great seafood, great beers, ethnic restaurants. Full of hotels, some pretty pricey. Great variety of architecture...love the pastel colors on many of the old buildings Feel the energy here, look at the boat traffic, you can't help but smile...an amazing place."

,,A good place for night life,5.0,,"There are many restaurants and bars , quay jumbo is a good place to eat pepper crab, after supper, we took a walk along the river, bought some snacks to taste. Almost like after 9:00PM, there were many people gathering in quay jumbo. People can take alcohol drink here, listen to music, we chose to go to the river bar where we could look at the Singapore river cruise, the scenery was good too. Coloured lights, on both sides of the bustling crowd, rivers sat sightseeing boat where greet passengers who were extremely excited, feeling a little Venice belongs to the most lively bar regional. Everyone eating drinking chatting, listening to the live band singing, enjoy the good time in Singapore"

,,Fun Place to Eat and Drink,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is an expats best friend in Singapore, with a tremendous variety of restaurants and pubs sufficient to meet everyone's tastes. The prices are a little steep but I think the ambiance is worth it."
,,Busy and bustling.,4.0,,"This is an excellent place for food and drink with numerous different restaurants offering a huge selection of food styles. However, be aware that the beer prices are through the roof, although most of Singapore is suffering with this now.
A modern design and very popular this is worth a visit whilst staying in the area."
,,MUST GO for party animals,5.0,,this is THE place to be in the evening in Singapore if you are looking for a good atmosphere and cheaper drinks. We were there on 30th October which happened to be Deepavali and Halloween so Im no sure if the mood was heightened by the festivities or not. Amazingly the young adults celebrate Halloweenover here by dressing up which is something Im not used to coming from the UK (its our children who celebrate)
,,Popular but will hit your purse,3.0,,"Visiting the one of the quays in Singapore for a meal is a must. Geared to tourists, Clarke Quay offers a lively night scene with restaurants and bars aplenty. A meal at one of the restaurants along the river in the cooler evening weather is lovely. Be warned though it is not cheap, so limit your visit to one meal and then venture to other eateries throughout Singapore. Head down the river to Robertson Quay which has a little more class about it!"
,,Lively place for evenings!,5.0,,"Situated along the riverside, this is a very lively and crowded place in evening. lots of riverside restaurant options with wide range of cuisines and drinks. Nice place to walk around and enjoy the evening."
,,If this the modern Singapore give me the traditional.,3.0,,"If you wish to see the real Singapore this is not the place to visit. Interesting to walk round to look at the many restaurants and noisy bars, most catering for tourists and as such charging premium prices. A walk beside the river is pleasant and the cleanliness of the river and area is a credit to the government"
,,Amazing place to hang out!!!,5.0,,Beautiful place for hanging out with lots of restaurants in walking distances. You bring your family for a weekend stroll as well.
,,A must for visitors ..,4.0,,"Have a drink , dinner at one of the many restaurants and bars. Its also historical area. Go for a ride on the sampan which travels along the Singapore River . Especially in the night, everything all lit up, buildings,singapore flyer, merlion and along the river banks."
,,Cool place to get some drinks in singapore,4.0,,Looking for a late night spot to get some drinks.. this seemed to be the place to go. Hard to find a good craft beer after 11 though when Brewerkz closes.
,,Relaxing 😎,4.0,,"We visited the area a couple of times for dinner. Not straying to far on our choice of western style cuisine, there are plenty of options here, depending on what sort of theme you like.
On one of our visits we did the river cruise which was great, leaving from Clarke Quay and moving around to Marina Bay and back.
We didn't get the opportunity to spend too much time here on our visits, but this would be a great spot to sit back for a few hours with a few drinks and some food"
,,Fantastic food with a view,5.0,,"Mainly a eating/drinking precint with the only problem being that there are to many restaurants to choose from.
Most have a great view of the river and/or vibe and look to serve good food.
Not the cheapest area to eat in especially if you have a hungry family to feed."
,,"Thrush, Venue, Clubbing circuit",5.0,,"Nice place for evening after daily sightseeing

There are many restaurants, bars and clubs, and also atmosphere is clubbish. Variety of choice of kitchens it the middle there is sign boards which show the locations of each restaurant or bar. Many restaurants and bars stop to serve main course at 21-30 so better if you want to have a choice of food start not later than 20-00 then you can go on with drinks and music. Many places have live music, live bands who are doing well and making good show. Drinks are quite expensive.

I recommend this place for visit and have a nice party and fun…."
,,Definitely go in the evening,5.0,,"Great place to go out , walk around , listen to music , tons of restaurant , bars , life music , seafood , total casual and fun but loud ..so not for romantic dinner"
,,Clarke Quay,4.0,,"Excellent place, nt the cheapest definitely, it WILL cost money, but so many choices of food and bars with live music, and one of the best ice cream salesman anywhere in the world I'm guessing with his simple tricks for the kids. I'm going back there."
,,Very nice,5.0,,"We visited Clarke Quay in the evening on a very warm balmy evening. It seem not only an area for visitors but for the locals; people in suits and young adults. It's a area full of restaurants, cafe and mostl with outdoor seating options to take full advantage of the beautiful area, the very comfortable weather, and to people watch! Of course, there is always shopping as well!"
,,Night Life in SG,5.0,,"Restaurants near Singapore River serving different cuisines. Bars, restaurants, music & party. Tourists can also enjoy the Singapore River Cruise from Clark Quay to Marina Bay."
,,Just can't miss it!!!,5.0,,"We spent our first evening in Singapore at Clarke Quay. This is place is not really suitable for kids under 8 years as there is nothing much for them to do. But otherwise it's a great place for young adults and couples.

The walk along the river is beautiful. There are multi-cusine restaurants including the very famous Hooters. Food for every palate is available here.

DON'T MISS THE 2 adventure rides. They are the best adventure rides that one can do in Singapore. The adrenaline rush that you get after these rides is something that I can still recollect.

There is a 1 hour boat ride too, but I suggest that you walk along the river and enjoy the evening."

,,Nice place for evening hangout,4.0,,"Singapore's party place, happening night life, all sorts of branded restaurants like Jambo, Hooters, Harrys, Sheraj and so on. Great view of Singapore river and it;s lit up every where just as the sun sets. You can enjoy your boat ride on Singapore river spending 50 bucks all the way to Marina Bay and back to clarke."
,,Not really much during the day,3.0,,"Pretty quiet during the day, sure it must come to life in the night, seems if you want places to eat out and drink this may be the place."
,,Stop over,4.0,,"When the sun comes out and after 4pm this is the best hive of activity for a stopover night out, great range of restaurants and bars, we loved it, would use this place again, but takes lots of cash."
,,"Storm The Stores By Day, Stomp The Pubs At Night",3.0,,"Clarke Quay is hardly a 'happening' place.

But it is the ultimate testimony to the government's effort to clean up the river. Something visitors might like to go green about.

Worth a stroll - shopping around ""The Central"" & ""Liang Court"" in airconditioned comfort in the day.

The nocturnal scene erupts in the outdoors... the sidewalk cafes, the riverside bars.

Spot the Reverse Bungee fair ride, Jim Beaming through the pubs, Johnny Walker's wisdom running wild.

There's food too ...lots of yum - well appointed and accordingly priced.

Expect tourist types, bored expats, trendy young locals.

Curious Singaporeans cruise by to make up the numbers. Most are dating couples waiting to be moonstruck.

It is no wonder that the eateries and pubs lining the river, mostly fronted by Filipina wait staff, zoom in on foreigners rather than on locals.

At night, the lights are garish, the blared competing music noisy, the stiffling haze of second hand cigarette smoke (even in the open) bury any expectation of relief.

A night visit can be worth the experience. How much one spends depends on one's resolve and budget... though people watching can be just as fun and not plunder your wallet.

Considering the wharf, godowns and riverine trade related Raj-era structures (including bridges), now quaintly dressed and colored for different mercantile purposes, the place seems happily rejuvenated.

The abundance of like offerings, pricing practice and exposure to the elements ( rain & sun) should be addressed lest it start taking a toll on takings."
,,Beautiful walk on weekday evenings,4.0,,Beautiful walk on weekday evenings. Avoid on weekends and Friday due to the crowds and rowdy people there
,,Nice place to visit,5.0,,"The view and ambience in the night were really alive. I walked and my friend took a picture in front of the Clarke Quay name across the river.

,,Lame,1.0,,"Nothing but a line of over priced restaurants and bars by a river, most of which are not open during the day. I am aware this is a more happening place at night but one would think there would be something more there for whose who wish to visit during the day.

It was very expensive too. We paid $50 for basic fish and chips and an entrée sized fried rice!!

It's not even nicely done up as other cities which have riverside dining and bars. The decoration of the whole place is lame and has plastic trimmings which are dirty. Honestly not sure what the hype is about."
,,Singapore Night,4.0,,"Well the place is bustling after sunset, lots of people,lots of noise,lots of restaurant and Bar. its a crazy place.You have choice of all types of food, which is great, but generally prices are above average in Singapore standard!! the view is as scenic as it goes in singapore, you can sit by the river and enjoy the view and have a nice dinner.

,,Great place to Eat,5.0,,"We were fortunate enough to be staying in a hotel minutes from Clarke Quay, so we visited this area mostly every day of our 7 day stay.

It was always very quiet in the morning (like most places), not much open. But from the afternoon and especially the evening, the place was a hype of activity. There is pretty much every cuisine imaginable. Otherwise you can jump on a boat and do a river tour, or just sit somewhere abit quiet having a drink taking it all in.

There is also a MRT here which brought us home from Sentosa one night (only 4 stops away).

Clarke Quay Central is a multi storey shopping centre. Some great places to eat here also. We visited a coffee shop in here daily for my long black - which I later learned to be an Americano???"
,,Fabulous party place,5.0,,"Even before we went to Singapore we had been told to visit CQ by multiple friends and we thought it would probably be a complete let down after all the build up. Turned out that we were completely wrong and the place DID actually live up to the expectations! Numerous bars throng the riverfront and there's some fabulous places with a good expat crowd, vibrant music and plenty of food options. Must visit for an evening of fun."
,,"Bars,Restraunts very lively at night..worth visiting.",5.0,,"This is basically a quay side area by the Singapore river that has recently been developed in to a pleasant eating and drinking area.
The us a central 'square' area surrounded by bars etc.
You can also pick up a 40 minute river cruise from here, they also gave a double bungee catapult chair attraction at night.
Nice atmosphere worth a wander."
,,Noisy but full of atmosphere,4.0,,"A great place for couples, groups and friends but not somewhere for kids! It has loads of bars and a few restaurants too and the prices aren't too high. It's a really vibrant, colourful and pretty place on the waters edge."

This place goes lively post 10. Do visit!
,,Nice for an evening stroll,4.0,,"This area is really buzzing in the evenings with bright lights, music and lots of people. Plenty of restaurants to choose from offering all kinds of cuisines. Great setting with all the old warehouse buildings and alongside the Singapore River.
We had dinner at Rennthai restaurant where the service was definitely lacking. Also there was a 2 for 1 offer on the beer but they didn't tell us until we had paid the bill and were leaving. They should have offered it while we were still eating our meal."

Great place for gathering and chit chat while enjoying the breeze along the river. I like this place. A must to visit every time i come to Singapore.
,,"Good hang out place, it's stil humid though",4.0,,"Clarke Quay is the hottest place in SG (figuratively and literally, well I guess SG in general is extremely humid) where all the cool kids hang out at ;). There are a lot of clubs and bars you can choose from."
,,Always a holy place,5.0,,"Whenever I go to Clarke, it always cheers me up. Bars playin music so loud, and all those happy ppl having a good time after work or on a weekend. Reminds me that no matter what happens in life, it's always important to have a ""let go"" time. On a side note, the Turn over of the bars and stores are really fast (high rent, I guess)"
,,Fun,4.0,,"Nice place to stay at night, theres a bit for everybody, its all about the choice you make to wich club, restaurant or bar you wanne go, but enough for everybody.
We loved the relax atmosphere from all the parts we have seen, only thing is when you make it late its a bit of a disater to get a taxi. They are arround but just dont want to bring you somewhere.
We hade know idea and asked arround but seems to be a common problem"
,,Enjoy evening at Clarke Quay,4.0,,"Listening some musics while having dinner and drink at the front of Clarke Quay, very relaxing and meet so many traveler and local people who love to relax and enjoy the atmosphere after work.

,,Mesmerizing evening,5.0,,"This is most happening place in the evening. The places has many eateries and bars serving thai, singapore, malay, continental food. It is most popular more among international tourists from Europe, Japan, US. It is very expensive. One need to have budget of USD 75 to 100 for a couple for an evening and dinner here.

,,Night time at Clarke Quay,3.0,,"The first attraction that welcomed us at Clarke Quay was the Singapore River. There were lots of people sitting on the riverside and there were boats that cruise the entire length of the river. I noticed Clarke Quay isn’t all about night life with sexy girls in various bars. There were several restaurants with beautiful glass facade while others have attractive seats to stay for the night. There were plenty of tourists strolling around with cameras on their hands. Walking near the riverside was lovelier at night because of lights illuminating the water. And the crowd got more livelier. Indeed, we had a great night at Clarke Quay."

,,Historic Quay,3.0,,"Clarke Quay on the Singapore River is named after Sir Andrew Clarke, the second Governor of Singapore from 1873 to 1875.

Sir Andrew played a key role in the development of Singapore as a major regional port, and thus ultimately as an international port.

It is part of a popular walk along the banks of the Singapore River and at night is the hub of several nightclubs, including Zirca.

It is also one of the points for embarking on river cruises."
,,Perfect night spot,4.0,,"Vibrant and fun at night, full of places to eat and drink. Could be good for those that like to party. You can get a boat ride to Marina Bay to watch the light or fountain show, I don't recommend it. Waste of time and money especially if you have seen the Burj Khalifa fountain at Dubai. I would say stick to the quay walk around and enjoy."
,,Vibrant by night!,4.0,,"Visit during the day and it is a relatively quiet spot, but by dusk, the whole quarter is heaving with life. Take your pick of restaurants and bars, each one bristling with customers and pelting out their own brand of music. It can be quite an assault on the eyes and ears by the end of the evening, but great fun. Plenty to see and do."
,,"Tiny but with all the possibility & energy, Yeah it's Singapore !",5.0,,"In the before, I talked to myself, well it's a small country to look all by one hour car trip.
However after I visited Singapore in 10 years later, it totally blow my mind away !
Lots of green trees by the streets on my way to Clarke Quay, restaurants providing yummy foods at various country cuisines, I took the small boat to reach different tour places, some with shopping malls, others I saw the street artistic show.
To have a beer, taste the great food with relaxing mind here, is my sincere suggestion. Magic Singapore !"
,,Dinner and drinks,4.0,,"Very lively place with many options of restaurants and bars, by the river. Nice relaxed atmosphere. Many tourists. On the pricey-side vs other dinning options in Singapore."
,,So different by night!,5.0,,"Arriving early, we wandered along here around 9am this morning and it was deserted. However is evening (after a few hours kip....) it was alive, kicking and screaming out for people to add to its identity. So atmospheric with great bars, restaurants and places to hang out, not that we hang out much at our age. Brilliant vibe, one of the places to walk through at night and savour."

,,Quiet mid-week visit.,3.0,,Been to Clarke Quay many times and this was on of the most quiet evenings I have ever experienced. Still a nice place for drinks or dinner and a bit of people watching. Shop around - prices vary a lot.
,,Cruising the river,4.0,,"It was nice to take a walk along the Clark Quay (CQ) especially at night. The place was good, cozy and clean as usual (everybody knows how clean Singapore).
You could enjoy just for sight seeing , having drink or lunch, dinner at the restaurants ,cafes or pubs along the CQ. Just enjoyed seeing the atmosphere of the place. After all, nothing to do over there.
Food Price was expensive, not recommended for budget traveler.

Wanna cruise the river? Just took the small ship and cruising the river, it took about 1 - 2 hour, and you could stop at Merlion Park. One of The Singapore's Landmark or icon. It was crowded when getting night."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Had an amazing time here good variation of music and food the atmosphere is electric and friendly and definite must do when in singapore Friday and Saturday nights are buzzing with music and people

,,Watch out for the chilli crab!,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is great for a night out -live music ,bars and restaurants everywhere.
Prices for booze is expensive though even in happy hour.
One major rookie error was the night I ordered chilli crab.I have never ordered crab before and the waitress asked what size crab I would like (well I said medium) big mistake it was huge!!.
I assumed the cost of the crab would be similar to all the other items on the menu.(another rookie mistake).The cost of the crab exceeded £70.0-I nearly fell through the floor.(my wife is still giggling at my reaction)
Really enjoyed it though -too much to eat all of it."

,,Clarke Quay @ Singapore,3.0,,"Though recommended by friends as a place to party, I did not enjoy the Clarke Quay area all that much. However, there are lots of pubs and bars here to keep the party crowd pleased."
,,Tourist Trap,2.0,,"I read so many positive reviews before travelling to Singapore re: Clarke Quay. I guess I should have paid a little more attention to what I was reading about. Everyone we spoke to in Singapore and all of the cabbies kept pushing us to go to this place. So we went.

No doubt it was busy and people were having a great time. I cannot remember the name of the place where we stopped to rest our feet after a long day and have a couple beers, but it was almost $40 . . . what a shock!!

I guess it depends on your interests. Not really into the bar scene, so to me it was just a bunch of drunk tourists paying far too much for food and beverages.

I loved the city, but will not be returning to Clarke Quay."
,,Bit of everything for everybody,4.0,,"Clarke Quay could be classified as party central for going out at night. There's a bit of everything for everybody priced in the medium to high range. You'll find bars with good music - enjoyed the bands in The Highlander Bar and The Warehouse across the road, and a wide assortment of food covering all tastes.

Just bring your wallet, as you will go through a few dollars if you really want to enjoy yourself!!!!!!"
,,Weekend Night at the Clarke Quay is the place to be!,5.0,,"Great to have an entire zone that parties all night on the weekend. This is the definitive nightlife district of Singapore and a must visit. We bar hopped on a Saturday night (expensive!), had a great time sampling a drink or a bite along the way. Highly recommend."
,,Awesome Place for Nightlife in Singapore.,4.0,,Huge number of Pubs and nightclubs with different flavours of music and F&B. Very safe. and air-conditioned despite being outdoor. Liquor can be bit expensive though (which seems to be the case in Singapore) however the ambiance compensates that. Can smoke outdoor in most places.

I visited it during the day, and there were a lot of restaurants and shops in the area which are unique at first but then become repetitive. Certainly looks better at night. If you are visiting china town, you can walk to Clark Quay, it is nearby but don't plan a day for it.

Restaurants and bars here change often so check recent reviews for the latest and best places to go."
,,Cool place,3.0,,"We found it by accident using the train. It's a cool little place. There are bars and restaurants all along the river and it feels like a little party island.

Tip: We bit the queue by using Uber."

Lots of colourful lights make for really great photo opportunities and it is a really great place to spend a night to enjoy a truly unique Singapore experience."
,,Colourful evening destination,4.0,,It's buzzy with office workers after hours. Great meeting point for all especially the young. Lots of bars and eateries. Lots of colour in the architectural sculptures . This is also the place to get onto a boat and travel the Singapore river ( which we declined due to lack of time ).
,,Not that appealing for the middle-aged,3.0,,"Our conference hotel was located at Clarke Quay, and it would not have been my first choice of location.

,,Good for nightclubbing,4.0,,"Clarke Quay used to be Singapore most vibrant shophouses area in the Singapore Port, until the Government decided to ""clean"" it.

,,Happy😊😊,4.0,,Good place to enjoy night ambience. Sight seeing and eat many kind of food also ice cream attraction that quite funny.

You will find all types of food here (Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Indian, American, etc...)
Its great to have good food & beer in a hot place like Singapore.

,,Clark Quay,5.0,,A very quaint area by Singapore River. The architectural design around the river's edge is fantastic. There are many Bars and Cafes to suit people's needs.

,,Nightlife at it's best...a must visit in Singapore,4.0,,"To visit the place , get down at Clarke Quay MRT ( NE5 ).. pl do visit the place after the dusk...The best way to move around the place is to take a boat trip.. The view from the boat is mesmerizing and one must not miss it..You may walk along the river for around a km.. This part of the city never sleeps and will provide you all kind of entertainment like best of the foods ( you may find the joints expensive, but anyway Singapore is expensive).. You may try the Srilankan giant crabs from the riverside food stalls in case you don;t like to bear the expense of fine dining... or cuppa coffee from Starbuck...to enjoy the place on foot , do take the Boat Quay , Fullerton route to reach Esplanade to see the fascinating panoramic view, including the iconic Merlion.. in case you are interested, you may take part in activities like reverse Bungy, which throws you up at a lightning speed...4 - 5 hours will simply fly off in this amazing place..

In case you prefer to travel by MRT.. do keep in your mind that that last MRT from NE5 will be 12 (north bound ) and 11.50 (south bound), after that you need to hire a taxi to come back.."

,,Vibrant living,5.0,,"What a place to walk and take in street music, bars, foodie places. Some is under cover but you can walk through the shops at Clarke Quay mall, and then get lunch or dinner in one of the many bars and restaurants on offer.

,,Great Party Spot,5.0,,"Having the ability to walk a few meters and find a new bar with a new theme is great. You have sports bars, shots bars, whiskey bars and most every type of food under the sun.

Watch as there are quite a few clusters of prostitutes in the area."

Restaurants became busier as dusk arrived - the buildings, boats and bridges lit up.

,,STUNNING VIEWS AND AMBIANCE,5.0,,"Clark Quay has a been my favorite place in Singapore. It actually becomes lively only after 7 PM . Its the best place in Singapore for a great ambiance , amazing view great food and riverside bars.
One can simply sit by the river and enjoy the mesmerizing view of the place. If in Singapore, this is absolutely a must to visit place. For the thrill seekers, there is reverse bungy, which catapults you to dizzying heights in micro seconds.

,,Great mix of colonial and new,5.0,,"Singapore is a relatively difficult place to walk around due to the heat/ humidity, but it is worth a walk around this area to see the Fullerton hotel (very grand atrium) the Scottish built bridge (ok biased) and the mix of other colonial buildings and tree lined boulevards set against the backdrop of the marina & business district. A relatively short 30 minute walk around, but a great ground view"

For aussies there is a bar that shows both rugby and aussie rules footy live. Beautiful place to enjoy beautiful food
,,Too western,3.0,,"It's pretty at night and good for happy hour drinks, but seems like an odd choice if you come here on holiday from a western country. It's just like being at home! There's no Singapore local culture to be seen, if you want that, head to satay street (Boon Tat Street) for al fresco dining SG style."

It's gorgeous at night all lit up with neon lights, long boats go by, people are dancing in bars, drinks are served in chic open air restaurants and the food is amazing.

A lot to walk around and see for free, good shopping and good downtown Singapore vibe. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Drink specials before 9pm,4.0,,"Great area to visit after the sun has gone down, but get there earlier as a lot of places have 2 for 1 drinks or half price/cheap deals from 5-9pm, depending where you go. Can get expensive once happy hour is over."
,,Clarke Quay way nback in the 2000 and now! WOW what a change,5.0,,"Singapore was almost second home to me for 7 + years and for my husband 14 years! so Clarke Quay was not a new attraction when we revisited Singapore in 2015 Dec after retirement in 2012. Clarke Quay has almost become a very iconic attraction but as it happens with progress the eating places are now getting to be a rip off-One has to be real careful where they go to dine and check if the prices are not a tourist rip off( happened to us despite having been locals almost years ago!
I love this pace as it full of energy and its not just weekends but each day the vibrancy starts around 6.30 Pm and continues till early hours if you are up to it-

One can walk and admire the opposite side Robertson Quay or take a ferry ride or just cross the bridge
I can fill pages singing praises of various places in Singapore but I shall stop and not get carried away"
,,Experience Singapore Night Life !,5.0,,"The best place to sit leisurely with a glass of wine and enjoy the night pub culture of Singapore. It offers choice of restaurants and nightclubs. There are also moored Chinese junks that have been refurbished into floating pubs and restaurants. Have a look at The Cannery, The Arena, The Circa, The G-MAX reverse bungee, Hooters and Indochine. If you have more time enjoy cruise on the Singapore River. One of its most popular attractions is its exciting host of CQ's signature events happening once every quarter."
,,Great place for hang out,4.0,,"It is a good place for a long walk with much more food option, more view and more active river compare to marina bay."
,,Best place for dinner,4.0,,"Hello,

Clarke quay riverside is best place to visit during evening... there are lot of restaurants and pubs along Riverside which makes it a perfect place for dinner... i would recommend this place to any of the tourist... just be aware that the meal price of restaurants is little bit on higher side."
,,Dull and disappointing,3.0,,"I was last here in 2012 and really enjoyed Clarke Quay. So, it was one of my first picks for this trip. I wish I hadn't bothered.
What used to be a vibrant colourful and fun area, is now run-down drab and slightly boring.
Half of the restaurants were closed - the others were like a flag without wind - limp. Food wasn't that great either."
,,How the mighty are fallen,1.0,,"Visited Clarke Quay this past Sunday afternoon hoping to enjoy lunch. Mothers Day no less. What a spectacular disappointment. The whole place looked run down, nothing was polished, many places were shut and part of the area resembled a ghost town! Far, far from the heydays of only 5-10 years before.

Shame, a real shame!"
,,An Amazing Friday Night,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is truly a happening place especially at the weekend.

We took the MRT - a single stop from Dhoby Ghaut and walked along first to Boat Quay and then to Clarke Quay. A couple of beers and a good walkabout taking in the sights and sounds of people having a fun evening.

The Persian Restaurant Shiraz even had a belly dancer performing outdoors .....

The river boats were cruising the Singapore River.

We spent a couple of hours here only as we depart Singapore tomorrow morning.

A great way to end our brief visit."
,,Livley night out,5.0,,Great place to visit ar night although be prepared to pay for it as it is pretty expensive. Open late for food which is great with loads of options. Would go again Would recomend to others!
,,Amazing at night,5.0,,"Modern life and hurry here. U can enjoy many things here, drinking or playing. Good scenes and cool at night. Chill out wit friends will be fun"
,,Must visit hang out place night life esp,5.0,,"Like Marina bay sands this is also one of the fascinating place in Singapore attracting tourist and must visit. Located on yhe bank of Singapore river and between China town and city this place offers perfect night out or even day out especially for youngsters. Full of night life this one must be one of the best in the world for night life.
Must visit for boozers and those who loves night life."
,,Great place to visit and so lively!,5.0,,So many restaurants and riverside cafe's! This is the place to go for a lively nightlife! A daytime visit isn't as crowded but equally entertaining. We went to place one of our love locks on the other side of the river but stayed for the great food and entertainment!
,,Super place to visit in the evenings,4.0,,"Very lively place with many riverside cafe's. Apart from river side cafe's, there are a whole lot of clubs and restaurants !"
,,"Waterfront nightlife. Expats area, relax and party all in one place",5.0,,"This is the place you go if you want to enjoy Singapore's nightlife. It is the area were the expats meet and were everything happens.
It is both an area to relax and to enjoy the night. I went the couple of nights during my stay in Singapore. It is one of the best areas of Singapore, from the relaxing restaurants in the waterfront area with live music while you watch the cruise boats pass by to the bars and clubs to party later on.
Definitely a place to go for food and drinks at night time. You won't be disappointed.
Plus during the daytime there are lots of shops to go spend your money."
,,Vibrant lively waterfront venue.,5.0,,"Clarke quay and Boat quay are on opposite sides of the river in the shadow of the China bank. Both are lively colourful places to visit, for drinks food but Clark quay has lots if music too. It also has shaded streets with tree like canopies, and clooling jets of air. In the centre is a water feature where children of all ages seem drawn to splash and play and pose for selfies. It is easy to get to, well served by boats on the river side and taxis on the river valley road.
Venues from ""wings"" a USAF Themed bar with servers dressed in scanty air force uniforms and a replica plane over the bar. Lots of outside seating and live music, happy hour typically till 7pm half price drinks. By 9 am it's bustling and more music and dj music spilling out on to the streets. We visited The Warehouse bar and resturant that is home to one of Singapore’s best rock bands Tania. Headed by legendary guitarist Zul, they are popular for covering classic rock hits from Pink Floyd to the Beatles, they perform on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday & Monday nights. Be prepared for loud music, and bring a torch to read the menu as like all good music venues, it's quite dark.
Some venues offer karaoke, some have age restrictions bring photo id to gain access to these.
When you want the toilets they are outside the venues in shared facilities."
,,Watch the world go by,5.0,,A great place to watch the world go by. You can see all the expat workers come for a drink after work or a bite to eat. There is cuisine from all corners of the globe. Great in the afternoon or early evening. Lovely colourful buildings.
,,relax by the river side,4.0,,Its such a great environment at the quay by the river. you get free wifi if you are close to the mall for an hour. We loved just sitting by the river side and watching the ferry pass by. There are many eating open café and restaurants. Jumbo crabs is the most popular. spending an evening with friends with open bar and good music is amazing.
,,multiple cuisines and many places to sip a drink whilst watching the river,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is lined with restaurants and bars. there are many restaurants vying for your dinner dollar. Soo many cuisines and decors to choose from. This is a hub of night time activity, also great to taste/try during lunchtime. Near the river, and bustling with activities. Mind you I wouldn't eat before trying the slingshot chair ride that is located on the side of the quay, it may repeat on you :) the ride is stomach turning just watch (or maybe just for me??). Close to fort canning park and boat quay. This is a great place to get a waterside view of Singapore and take a riverboat cruise as well."
,,I lived it!,5.0,,"A place full of life both by day and especially by night. Plenty of restaurants of all cuisines of the world, plenty of expats, plenty of music and good time. You can find whatever type of fun you want there. You can also take a boat to find out more about the river, the bay and the history. We were out every night until 3am when bar literarely close down and the people are invited out. That's pretty funny but we liked it so much we couldn't have been upset."
,,Best place to enjoy Night life,5.0,,"As Clarke quay is has some best clubs and restaurants. Visiting their at night is quite amazing.
You can find various types of Restaurant and pubs.
And sitting at Clarke quay bridge drinking and enjoying with your buddies is just awesome experience .
Must visit if you are interested in Night life ."
,,Clarke Quay and its many restarants,4.0,,"Whilst staying in Singapore, you must make a visit to Clarke Quay one evening. There are some excellent eating holes, but the vibes you get from just being there are fantastic. The lights come on, and the boats go along the river."
,,Beautiful views!!,5.0,,"Clarke Quay has endless bars and restaurants. If you can't find something here to eat, there is something wrong with you. Plenty of bars to drink in, restaurants to eat in and beautiful views."
,,Great photo opportunities,4.0,,Boats chug up and down. Seats belonging to cafes are along the edge of the water. Visit the modern shopping mall on one side of the water and shophouses on the other side. If it rains go to the basement and look at shops. Fountains entertain children.
,,Buzzing all the time,5.0,,"It was amazing to see the buzz in this area. Very hip, you can grab a drink from the nearby shops and have one on at the quay. Food is also in abundance. Great experience"
,,loved this place,5.0,,awesome place to visit. lots of hotel with variety of foods. nice place to seat and the enjoy the people out there.
,,Rugby 7's After Party,5.0,,This area is a must for tourists who enjoy the nightlife. Nice alfresco dining options on the water. The bars are almost pub style. The open air stage errected for the Rugby 7's after party was a great idea. Unfortunately the 'Fern n Kiwi' has closed down.
,,Hit and miss,3.0,,"We came here on our 1st night in Singapore for dinner after reading this was where the best nightlife was. In the end we really weren't impressed, the reviews are right about the atmosphere of the area but that's about it.

From a distance all the little restaurants and bars lining the river appear to be the perfect place for a romantic meal but you'd be better eating somewhere else. The restaurants looking out over the river are more interested in squeezing as many tourists in as physically possible than anything else. We ended up paying $120 for a very substandard meal (1 starter, 2 mains, no desserts or drinks).

I would suggest eating somewhere else beforehand and just take a stroll up here in the evening and stop off in a few places for a drink. The atmosphere walking around is lovely and theres loads of street acts and performers to keep you entertained."
,,Vibrant place to Nightlife.. In SG,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a must visit place at night...I took MRT to reach .The Riverside bridges , restaurants were illuminated with colourful lights and the reflection glittered in the river...River Boat cruises were plying in the river bay....As I walked along the Riverside I was stunned to ve look at the majestic Fullerton Hotel glittering in spectacular lights.. Bars and restaurants were in full swing with tourists and travellers around the world. The pathways were decorated with lights and its fascinating fountains and the buildings were exquisitely flavoured in various styles...of thematic designs. The Riverside restaurants and bars and the ambience gave a memorable feel of the vibrant night life..."
,,Worht a visit,4.0,,"We went to Clarke Quay several times and it is worth a visit. There are plenty of places to eat and drink. They also have boat rides down the river if you want.

Everyone wants you to eat in their restaurant so check out others first before you make up your mind.
We ate in a Mexican restaurant, not cheap however it was nice food.
If you want cheap food go to a food court and you can eat for $4 Singapore dollars or go to a restaurant and pay £40 Singapore dollars."
,,Nice place,4.0,,Stayed here for 5 days and felt the area a very good one. The place was easily accessible via MRT. A busy place during both weekdays and weekends.
,,Wide variety,5.0,,"Went here twice during trip to Singapore. Many restaurants and bars. Lots of live music, dinner on the water and nice outdoor seating."
,,Walk your evening,4.0,,"You can start your boat ride from here, Its a nice experience. Have food options, can get busy with lots of crowds. Its a good place for your evening walk."
,,Greate Atmosphere with nightlight,5.0,,"It is pretty during the day and night with all colorful building and all restaurants there.
I feel happy and peaceful, jsut sit and see everything, people walking, top of the building changing the color and colorful life. There are a lot of restaurants and bars for having a dinner and good for drinker with great atmosphere beside the Singapore river."
,,Well Connected and Good Attraction for water lover,4.0,,Good Place for water lover and nice breeze along with river and fountain. Lot of restaurants and fun activities. nice location
,,Awesome Quay Experience,5.0,,This place is located right along the canal leading up to the river. It comes alive at night and the place literally gets converted into a giant party arena. It is a covered place lined with bars and restaurants serving cuisine from all over the world. Bar hopping would be a great place over here as the options are immense. Drinks and Food is not very cheap but if you are a visitor its a great place to be. This place is easily accessible by taxis and even late night or early mornings taxis are available.
,,Clarke quays,3.0,,"popular for dinner, I am not, still, convinced. Have had the traditional blackpeppar crab there?. Tapas, it was tapas but with no taste or quality. said this, there are places that might be good. We looked for a good Lebanese, the ones that serves middle eastern food was very touristic and had not a very genuine menu. Still, this is very popular with tourists and local. Not sure."
,,Boat Quay,5.0,,"spending the night in this place and chilled out with my friends. really love the scene, the food and the river."
,,Clarke Quay,5.0,,Clarke Quay is a 'must visit' place in Singapore. Full of trendy restaurants and bars with lovely views of the Singapore river.
,,"An expat staple, not adventurous",4.0,,"Read Bridge is definitely the highlight. Sitting on the bridge with some cans of beer and people watching is a uniquely Singaporean experience which I highly recommend.
The surrounding bars etc are exactly what you'd expect. Aimed at expats who want to drink but can afford $11++ per pint. Not a place for cheap drinking but a decent night overall"
,,Good place to spend an evening,3.0,,"We had a couple of beers and a meal. Enjoyed the vibe down by the river. It's a cool, if expensive, place to hang out. We loved the live local young rock band playing on the riverfront. Excellent!"
,,Best place for nightlife in singapore,4.0,,Live and happy place for night life . Too many bars and restaurant for drinking and eating . Live music in many bars. Nice ceiling design .
,,Dreadful place,1.0,,"Loud, sleezy, cheap and tacky food. Dirty. The most plastic place in Asia. But, obviously enjoyed by many due to the huge crowds. If 2-4-1 tequilas are your thing, enjoy!!"
,,Hot during the day!,3.0,,Do not visit during the day!...It can be really hot and not so lively as compared to at night. Can do boat riding and couple of malls nearby for shopping
,,A place for food and drinks at night,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a place for food and drinks at NIGHT. There are many pubs, restaurants and clubs over there. There are a lot of visitors in this place at night and a bit too crowded. Pay attention to those drunk people. The fountains at the centre of Clarke Quay is interesting. You can also take a boat trip along Singapore River there. The place is a good place for taking photographs.

However, there is nothing exciting at day time."
,,beautiful place especially night stroll,5.0,,"Its a beauuuutifullll place
You can spend hours walking about so many eating joints and roadside activities
Don't miss the Turkish Ice cream
The man juggles a lot before handing you the Icecream
Right opposite you can check for AnnaLakshmi .....A pure veg food place run by some family helping voluntarily .... they serve you with great hospitality .....and there charges for food ...... Eat to your fill and pay to your heart .......whatsoever the value for food your heart feels at that moment ....I was very impressed
Boating at Clarke Quay is very enjoyable at night . the view is awesome with all the lights .
not cheap but great fun"
,,Great,5.0,,"Great night, great food, great bar, great few. Great place to hang out, dine and party. Recomended place in Singapore"
,,Fantastic nightlife,5.0,,"If you like a buzzing nightlife and lots of atmosphere then this is the place to be. There are lots of places to eat and drink and plenty of seating for people watching, the music is booming and the general vibe is busy. We really enjoyed a couple of hours mooching about then decided to head somewhere a little quieter but I did love it."
,,Great place to chill,4.0,,"Fun to walk along the quay, dine, or have a few drinks. Not the cheapest place in town but lots of options and it's fun."
,,Best destination for night out,4.0,,"Its a best destination for night out. Lots of pubs, bars, and eating joints if you are fish lover then its a best place to eat."
,,A Right Good Laugh but not the Cheapest,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is another one of the must see places in Singapore. During the day it is relaxing with little shops and places to eat. By night it goes mad with live music, bars, restaurants and clubs. The place is great fun and you can sit on the bridge and veg out if you want. There is a little shop which sells cheaper beer if you can find it then sit on the bridge and listen to the chaos.
The slight downside is that it is expensive to drink alcohol in Singapore, twice the price of British pubs. The advantage is that you are outside in 75 degree heat and get all the entertainment as an extra. The place itself at night has the fountains as a centerpiece and they are not to be missed. By day the kids play in it, by night it changes colour. Food is not that expensive in comparison to the alcohol. Clarke Quay has its own MRT station which is under the shopping mall. It is a bit of a hike to get out but once out its great.
Its best to go before happy hour which finishes at 2100. The local brew is Tiger Beer which is okay but I found a place serving the Australian VB which I much prefer. After happy hour the prices can vary, up to S$18 so be selective about where you drink. Look out for special promotions such as ladies night where girlies get 2 for 1. My Wife fell in love with Lychee Martinis. This is a little bit of madness in an otherwise ordered country. Go there its great fun."
,,Lively and entertaining,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is a must if your looking for night life in Singapore, there is a wide array of bars and restaurants, just a short walk to the bars along the river. As with other water/river fronting locations the bars and restaurants here can be over priced"
,,Ideal place to spend an evening,5.0,,"Live music, drinks and all kinds of food available here. Take river cruise to enjoy the beauty of this place.you must spend atleast one evening there."
,,Good place for a relaxed evening,4.0,,"We were in the neighbourhood and stumbled upon this place while looking for a place for drinks. Ended up doing dinner and drinks, along with the much popular boat ride."
,,quay for the nights...,5.0,,"a must visit for foodies. alight at Clarke Quay MRT station and come out to the world of cuisines on the quay. enjoy ur beer n food in the cool breeze at the river quay. its the happening place with crowd, music n taste. best time to visit 8pm-midnight."
,,Very lively and plenty of options,4.0,,"We visit during the night time. Plenty of restaurants, bars and clubs. We had dinner in one place and stopped for a drink in another. Prices are similar to London and a gin and tonic is around S$25. Definitely is worth a visit."
,,"Lively, a must visit place in the night",5.0,,"A very lively place full of life with different types of eateries, bars, live music, dance. You can spend a whole evening to late night enjoying the atmosphere. Busy during weekends but more lively."
,,Another good plave,5.0,,This is another good place in Singapore for some good food and drinks. This place has lots of restaurants and clubs and is very popular with the locals. It's very crowded in the evening with young people.Opens till early morning
,,A really great atmosphere,4.0,,"I got here at night after a day of travelling and was really impressed. There are great views over the river, live music, clean streets, and plenty of bars and eateries. It's walking distance to Chinatown and Marina Bay."
,,Clark Quay (Key) day and night,5.0,,"Many years back I had the chance to visit the Quay in Singapore. It was a night visit but it seemed fairly low key. Not much excitement going on but it did seem the place to be if you were looking for some fun and drinks.

Years later I was able to come back and see how it has changed so much. The Quay has a great number of restaurants, pubs, bars and what appears to be dance clubs.

During the day it is fairly low key. Not much going on. In the evenings towards sunset, the place starts to pick up significantly.

I had a late lunch at the Hooters here with a plan to visit the Night Safari later. The Hooters seems to have changed a bit from my last visit but it is still a good time with good food. They also appear to have an outdoor seating area now.

Towards the end of the key closest to the Bay is the reverse bungee machine if you are into thrill seeking. At this point you can start to get a good view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel that looks like a boat on supports. Photo added.

It is easy to get to the Quay via taxi or MRT. The cost of entertainment and food at the Quay is mid range. No real cheap eats here. There are some photo opportunities for the FB selfie crowd. My main like about the Quay is it is clean, organized and there is little chance of getting run over like in many other venues around Asia similar to this.

It does rain a bit in Singapore and we nearly got caught in it. There are enough covered areas in the Quay that you are able to move around a bit or continue on with your festivities outdoors without fear of being soaked."
,,Funky place,4.0,,This place buzzes and has an energy about it that I can't describe. It's funky but expensive. This is where the hip crowd hangs out
,,Colourful attraction,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is easily accessible by MRT and we arrived on the Good Friday public holiday just as the sun was beginning to set, so we decided to take a bumboat ride in order to see the buildings around Marina Bay begin to light up.

The ride cost $25 per person and I believe it was good value. The narration with historical information was useful and images of what Singapore used to be like in bygone years were shown on a television screen at the front of the boat, giving a then and now perspective.

Our timing was perfect as we were able to see the buildings and quays gradually light up. It was a very impressive sight.

We didn't eat at Clarke Quay because we weren't hungry at that time so, after a walk around and a look in Central Mall and Liang Mall, decided to leave. By this time, around 8.30 p.m., it was becoming very crowded.

Definitely a colourful, buzzing place!"
,,A must see tourist attraction,5.0,,This is a great place to visit day and night. In the daytime it is quieter but you get to appreciate the beautiful old buildings in a rainbow of colours. At night it comes alive with all the restaurants and bars. The giant sling shot is very interesting to observe. We weren't game enough to try it but it was fun to watch people being flung into the air with lots of screams. The Swissotel Merchant Court Hotel is right there in Clarke Quay and a great place to stay if you want to make the most of Clarke Quay.
,,Most happening place in Singapore,5.0,,Amazing party place to get an ideal night life experience of Singapore. Restaurants of all types of cuisines available.
,,Lively,4.0,,"It gets pretty lively in the evenings. Over the years during my Singapore visits, I've found it quite nice to just sit by the water and do some people watching. Has plenty of food eating options. Does get a little too touristy. But the ambience can be pretty nice on certain evenings."
,,Bars and restaurants next to an unused quay,5.0,,"The place come alive in the night, lots of bars and restaurants with live music. Or just sit on the side of quay and let the atmosphere sink in."
,,Chilling night to spend,3.0,,"This area are packed with restaurants and bars. Its alive when nights come. During the day It seems dead. Full of entertainment. Here are also where the GX5 located for the people who loves adrenaline can check them out. Instead of bars and restaurants, You can buy drinks and snacks and chill by the quays with friends."
,,Beautiful Fine Dine Place,5.0,,Visit this place for a romantic fine dine with your partner. It is bit crowded so you might have to wait to get your favorite place.
,,Famous places for Nightlife activities,4.0,,"Wanna drink, dance, watch soccer, listen to live music, or enjoy the night view of Singapore river? This place will be the correct destination. With a lot of bars, pubs, and some restaurants around, it is a nice place to spend your weekend."
,,Busy and Touristy,4.0,,"This is one of the must see places in Singapore so you will find tourists at every bar, pub, or restaurant here. It's very lively in the evening. It was actually very nice when we were there during sun set, walking along the river with a little breeze was definitely soothing and enjoyable. We did not eat or drink there but totally enjoyed the atmosphere."
,,EVENINGS,4.0,,A happening place in the evenings.A good choice of restaurants.You can order from different places at the same time..The prices are good.
,,Very vibrant,5.0,,"Had dinner at one of the riverside restaurants (can't remember the name). Very expensive (it appeared most restaurants were). Walked along river - heaps of people and activities, with colourful lighting. Had great fun taking and uploading selfies on the social media wall, watching people do the reverse bungy jump, people watching etc."
,,"Not open during the morning, but catch a boat!",3.0,,We stopped by here in the morning and it was like a ghost town. Don't bother coming prior to midday as no one is open - not even for breakfast. If you do come be sure to catch a boat and go for a tour around the bay. Well worthwhile.
,,great lively buzzing place,5.0,,loved clarke quay it's vibrant and busy great to sit nd people watch. loved it. it is a little pricey but hey ho.
,,Busy area with all you could want,5.0,,If you're looking to eat and don't mind paying 'tourist' prices (although I'm not convinced they're that much higher than elsewhere in central Singapore) then head to Clarke Quay. There's every cuisine you can imagine in a well laid out and busy restaurant and bar scene.
,,Just meh,3.0,,"Splurge if you have extra, get some stuff at 7-11 before 10 and sit on the streets. Great place for people watching. Defs a very ""Western"" area for drinking and partying"
,,"A lively, bustling night life location.",4.0,,"One of a number of quay locations found along the river, Clarke Quay is an active area to visit for early evening food, drinks & thrills but comes even more alive later in the night when the night clubs and themed discotheques come alive.
You can catch a river boat cruise from here, which is probably the best location as you will cover the full extent of the river, back and forth from Marina Bay. Well worth a trip. Also for the real thrill seekers there are two 'reverse' bungee jump rides available. Not for the faint hearted, even when just watching!
There are number of themed bars & restaurants, such as Wings, which is an aviation 'Top Gun' style location. Others include Bollywood, the Highlands and Aussie bar types.
For young families I would suggest going early evening but for those that like to 'shake a mean hoof' then there is plenty on offer. Some 'interesting' local cover bands appear later in the evening also, mainly doing 80's stuff. A particular Metallica track will haunt me forever."
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,"If you are looking for scenery, fantastic eateries, colonial history and a great stroll along a historic waterfront, you have come to the right place. Affordable dinning with a flare for local favorites. Forget the burgers and fries....try the local flavors and have memories of a lifetime."
,,Great centre,4.0,,Nice mix of bars and restaurants in a clean complex next to the river. Plenty of offers and happy hours to enjoy
,,unwinding...,5.0,,"best place to just sit and chill, enjoy company and unwind after a long tiring day. good place to enjoy food and peace at the creek"
,,It's pretty much just bars and clubs these days,2.0,,"There used to be some nice restaurants and cafes around Clarke Quay, but these days is mostly just (expensive) bars and clubs. Personally, I find Clarke Quay rather boring for that reason."
,,Nightlife & Dining,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is the best place to experience the Singapore Nightlife. Lots of clubs and restaurants, with great views of the Singapore River. Weekends are crowded. Dining is pricey but worth it. Try pub hopping offered by hostels, its cheap and fun"
,,Truly Singaporea,5.0,,"Grt place to hang out.
Lots of restaurants of different cuisines and breweries, pubs and its carnival atmosphere

If you find its expensive walk to bridge pick up your drink from nearby stores and enjoy ur evening.
Don't forget the Iran ice cream maker near the entry of bridge."
,,View - Restaurants - Night life,4.0,,"I went to Clarke quay at night and it's really a nice place. A lot of restaurant choices and good view. Good for drinking too. It's more for teens and adults.

Restaurant that I would recommend would definitely be Keisuke Lobster King , it's a ramen place! Super good! Probably one of the best ramen place I've been to. It opens around 6pm and closes at 5 am. Line could be long but definitely worth the wait. If big group, you might have a hard time because the place is pretty small but believe me. It's a must try! It's lobster ramen after all."
,,CQ has it all,5.0,,"Visited on several occasions over a one week vacation, as our hotel was walking distance from CQ.
Clarke Quay has it all from excellent variety of restaurants with any type of cuisine you desire, plenty bars, nightclubs & an amazing atmosphere of an evening.
Highly recommend for all age groups & will definitely return when visiting Singapore."

On the bay of river many pubs and restaurants, open restaurants offering various type of food and drinks. One can enjoy full night here. Here also available river safari and u see Singapore city from the middle. Evening in this area is very good. You can spend a good and enjoyable evening here with your dear."
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"Wife and I stayed at the Swissotel right next to the Riverside area in Clarke Quay. We took the bum boat river cruise that was informative and an enjoyable trip down the river and back. For nightlife and restaurants it's all here. Huge variety of food choices, clean boardwalk and fun things to do. You won't be disappointed staying anywhere near this area as its easy walking distance to many hotels that are reasonable in price. In addition it is only a $10 taxi ride to the marina waterfront and the Flyer."
,,The bars & restaurants of singapore,4.0,,"Having 3 days in Singapore we often came to Clarke quay in the evenings just for the nice atmosphere, you will not pay more for a drink in Asia though, $60-$70 for 4 drinks was enough each night, food quite prices too"
,,Bumboat Ride is a Must,5.0,,"I went to this place to get a view of Singapore skyline. The fare costs S$25 and we were told to get a small change since the guy didn't have a change. They only accept cash. The ride was smooth and educational. Definitely worth it because you could see all Singapore skylines, such as Merlion, Esplanade, etc. from the boat. Perfect for picture taking."
,,Great vibe.,4.0,,"Wandered down here from Raffles and was not disappointed. The place was buzzing and had a great vibe about it. The clustered eateries cater for any taste and ample bars and venues with live music made it easy to while away a few hours. As with the majority of Singaporean licensed premises, beverage prices are high so finding an establishment with an extended 'happy hour' is a distinct advantage."
,,Lots of fun,4.0,,I went here on my last night in Singapore and had dinner. Lots of interesting choices. Definitely worth a visit!
,,Appeals to locals and tourists,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is a great watering hole that appeals to locals and tourists. Made up of old warehouses and shops along the river, they've all been converted into restaurants and pubs. You'll find a wide array of different kinds of fare. There's something for families looking for good food, singles looking for a place to mingle, business people wanting a place to entertain, tourists looking for a good time, and youths simply looking for a place to hang. Just bring money."

There are many shops that front onto the Quay also so a bit to eat and a wander around the shops is lovely."
,,Good for evenings - food and nightlife,4.0,,We easily walked to Clarke Quay from Marina Bay. While there we visited several bars and food stalls. Shiraz Mazzeh had good chicken kabab and fries. We went to Beer Market on the early side so I don't think it was as exciting as it could be but still a fun concept for a bar. McGettigan's had a nice area for sitting outside and a good happy hour. Chupitos Shots bar has very interestingly named shots. The area was decorated for the holidays and quite festive.

We have been here before but never on a Friday, believe me it is one of the most happening places on week ends and therefore a must visit. The place have many small lounges, restaurants and clubs. We were just strolling down there and saw a group of local teenagers perform street dance in front of a lounge (a second DJ was playing outside the lounge), eventually few more guys joined them and it became a treat to watch them show their improvised dance moves. Awesome experience! Then there was a small pub with a small live band, whose drummer just killed it, so awesome again. Do visit the place on a week end and be surprised."
,,Clarke Quay is a wonderful place to hang out in the evenings.,4.0,,Clarke Quay is a place where I can say you can wind up your day with some nice food and a drink to your taste. Not to mention that some may find this an expensive place to eat but there are some good restaurants which will work up your appetite. There are good pubs if you have a budget to have a drink or two. Menus are on display at the entrance of the restaurants. You can decide what food you want and if the price is right. Before I forget to mention there is a 7Eleven near the bridge where you can buy a chilled beer and sit on the bridge looking at the water front and having a nice and quiet evening all by yourself which I find sometimes so relaxing and gives you your own space and if you have your friends.......... then a wonderful time together.
,,Very nice night view,5.0,,Great place for a night out in singapore. Food and beers are a mandatory combo while basking in the river lights. Also located there is the reverse bungee and the river cruise...
,,"Good night view, but be careful women tourists",4.0,,"This place has beautiful night view, so overall I was satisfied. I and friend bought chicken, some liquids and snacks at convenient store and ate them deliciously.(Singapore doesn't sell beer at late time at convinient store) However, I went there with one female friend(I'm also woman) and we took pictures together, then one singapore man approached to us and wanted us to go dancing club with him. He said his friends are waiting for us. We didn't want to go clubs, so we tried again and again to drive him away from us.(Even he looked like wanted to follow to our hotel) One side of Clarke Quay is full of clubs, so really crowded at late time, but the other side is quiet and calm, so we played at there. And also, I recommend you to bring umbrella, because we had to run to building to escape rain. Singapore's rain comes mostly in short time, but we're so embarassed during raining."
,,Nightlife at it's best by the side of Singapore River,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is the old harbor area situated along the Singapore River, which is now converted into a leisure area with plenty of restaurants, clubs, pubs, cafes, bars and shops. There is plenty of nightlife with the whole area getting so crowded and lively during the night time. The bright neon lights and the sound of bands coming out from the bars and nightclubs makes the place very vibrant.

You can walk through the street by the side of the river, shop at the numerous shops or dine at any of the riverside restaurants, with excellent views of the Singapore river. There are plenty of discotheques and night clubs also making it a partygoer’s paradise.

You can take the river cruise from Clarke Quay or Boat Quay. We went for a 30 minutes cruise from Liang Court passing by Riverside Point, Clarke Quay, Coleman Bridge, Boat Quay, Financial District, Raffles Landing Site, Asian Civilisations Museum, Fulleron and Cavenaugh Bridge, Merlion, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Esplanade and back to Liang Court. There were hardly five people in the boat, but the ride was really enjoyable.

Later we walked down the street to have dinner at Jumbo Seafood, one of the finest seafood restaurants in the city. You can find plenty of restaurants serving different cuisines form various parts of the world.

Clarke Quay river side restaurants are perfect for relaxing in the evenings, while enjoying the river views and the city of Singapore.

The nearest MRT station is Clarke Quay. River taxi service is available from Raffles Place MRT Station. City Hall MRT and Raffles Place MRT are short walks from Clarke Quay."

It's also got old-fashioned shophouses and new architecture mixing together which makes it a must for a good night out in Singapore!"

,,"A must visit while in Singapore,",4.0,,"Buzzing, vibrant and with so, so much choice, Clarke Quay deserves at least one visit while in Singapore.

,,"Eat, drink and be hip.",4.0,,"A ""happening"" nightlife venue, alcohol consumption laws notwithstanding. Also home to Singapore's irreverent tourist trap - the ""Reverse Bungee"". Take a walk down the river towards the Esplanade, or up towards the ambient watering holes at Robertson Quay and Md. Sultan Road.

Or just sit with some friends on the steps by the water. Hang on to your stuff: phones, bags and the occasional shoe have been known to be knocked into the river out of carelessness.

On a related note, do not litter."
,,Exited Trip,4.0,,"Once you've visited this place i assure you that you would like to comeback. This place was so entertaining, starting with the food, the crowd, the ambiance. There is one spot for adrenaline play....yesss i dont dare to try😂😂"
,,Good place to hangout with friends.,4.0,,"This place bustles with joy and sparkles almost everyday. This is one of the best places in Singapore, with some of the best restaurants and pubs around. This has great connectivity to Conrad, Marina, or Park Royal hotels."
,,Great place to get together....,3.0,,"Clarke Quay has always been my favourite hang out with friends and dine with family as well business purposes. I've been away for awhile and my return this sept, Clarke Quay remain the same, the vibes, the people, of course new restaurant and club up and running. Definitely great place for foreigner, expatriate and tourist for sure. Well done Singapore. You did it again."
,,A must at night once in Singapore.,5.0,,"A must visit on your itinerary at night.Loads of activities to do once there like cruise, pubbing, clubbing,shopping, eating,strolling,thrill rides etc. Never a dull moment. Loads of good restaurants and clubs to enjoy through the night. Important thing is that its completely safe to stroll around alone with kids even past 10 pm. Since we reached there past 10 pm we missed the last cruise which i would have loved, Nevertheless a stroll on Clarke Quay was enjoyable. We also enjoyed having a snack by the waterside."
,,Great night out!,5.0,,"Excellent party vibe, plenty to do (eating, drinking, nightclubs, music bands, shopping, thrill rides, boat rides etc) and see (people watch, strolling, etc) in fact whatever your mood takes your fancy. Not cheap particularly if drinking (prices progressively increase throughout the evening after the Happy Hour at venues) but largely compensated by the safe and friendly environment in this area. A great night out."
,,Must place at night,5.0,,This is a must visit place for any visit to Singapore. There are many pubs and restaurants here. Got a good buzz about it. Partly covered and some sections by the water front. Food places by the water are good.
,,Entertaining,4.0,,"A great place for a variety of pubs, clubs and resteraunts in the same area. Though everything is a bit more expensive. The nearest MRT is the one under the Merchant Court hotel and is less than 5 minutes walk to Clarke Quay."
,,Watch the boats passing by while enjoying the breeze and a cold drink,5.0,,"The best way to close a day in Singapore. Although processo are high, the effort is worthy, the atmosphere is very plkeasant."
,,Happening nightspot,4.0,,"It is a active nightspot, lined with various restaurants serving a variety of cuisines. This is also the spot from where we took our Singapore river cruise. Had dinner in an Indian restaurant, which was quite expensive."
,,There is something for everyone both day and night,4.0,,"We were staying next to Clarke Quay on this trip, and having visited there let time as well were keen to once again enjoy the food and nightlife on offer. We were staying at Jackson Quay which is a five minute walk further along the river, or a short boat ride and took the opportunity to visit during the day. While much of the nightlife area is shut there is some shopping to be done in the malls around as well as food houses which are located in the buildings as well. There are some interesting shops including silk sellers and antiquities - very stunning Chinese art and items. It is really just a matter of walking around and checking out the buildings. You can even just walk across the road and up the hill to Fort Channing. This is the amazing thing about Singapore everything is within a small (and I mean small area) and you can access most by walking, though the weather and cheap cost of the taxi's seems to encourage people to ride. The sad part with that is there are so meant things that you miss.
However Clarke Quay comes into its own at night when it truly comes alive. There is an abundance of food and drink, dancing or just sit and watch the world go by. Here is a complete range of food types and costs to caters for all tastes. We took the kids there on the first trip and they went off with friends to explore the area and were safe the entire time. This trip we went down there a number of times during day and night and enjoyed the different faces presented. The Slingshot and other rides draw a crowd especially when both go off together. If you want you can escape by catching a boat ride up and down the river. Now here is an interesting point - the Singapore river is by and large a water storage area for the city and starts behind the city and runs down to Merlion Bay. You can catch a water taxi up to just past Jackson Quay or down. Either way the trip, while providing a great view of many of the Cities attractions, is short."
,,Great vibe,5.0,,"Cool place to visit something for everyone, night clubs , great bars , Jumbo Seafood with an awesome view , cool place to hang out especially on Wednesday nights as its Ladies night and free drinks for ladies"
,,Good place next to River,5.0,,"Always busy with tourist and locals. nice view from there as you can see marina bay sands, parliament house. atmosphere in the evening is totally different than day time. There are many restaurant and bars for eating and buzz."
,,Among the most lively places!,5.0,,"Clarke is among the most lively places and truly captures the spirit of Singapore. You can go at any time of the day and spend hours there. Evenings are beautiful with lightings, amazing crowd and some superb restaurents & pubs, the nightlife is worth experiencing!

A 40 mins River cruize is a good way to see the whole place Clarke quay + Boat quay without troubling your legs much! ;) You can see Supreme court, MBS, Flyer, Esplanade and some of the best architecture high rise corporate towers!

For food or just for spending time with your loved ones, this is a rocking place."
,,Awesome Central Location,5.0,,"Highly recommend staying in Clarke Quay - awesome location and vibe, trains close by. i would definately stay in this area again! Property to mention - NOVOTEL CLARKE QUAY - fabulous all round hotel!"
,,Good place to hang out by the river,4.0,,"There are restaurants, cafes, along the river, perfect for hang out at night, but the price is not for backpacker"
,,Chose carefully!,3.0,,"A noisy tourist area on the quay, with dozens of restaurants competing for business, and to have their music heard above their neighbours. Waterfront area tends to be a little quieter than the indoor market area. We went to 'Hot Stones' restaurant on the waterfront where you cook your own food on a .....hot stone. Tempted in by the buy-one-get-one-free offer on the surf & turf and a voucher from the restaurant for $40 off any food spend over $100. Surf and turf was great. Very fresh meat and very tasty. One of our party had a chicken Caesar which was generous in its quantities of mayonnaise and chicken skin. Of course, once it came to paying I was then told that I couldn't use the $40 voucher with the buy-one-get-one-free offer, but as I was told I could when they gave me the voucher I refused to pay the full amount and insisted on the lower price which they grudgingly accepted. As other reviewers have said, beware of scams on Clarke Quay. Wouldn't go back to Hot Stones restaurant again - evening marred by having to argue with dishonest restaurant staff about the bill."
,,Colourful Place,5.0,,"A very colorful place at night. It has a floating restaurant, clubs, pubs, restaurants , a boat ride, etc. If you don't like to do anything here just go for a walk at night."
,,Finally someplace to smoke without standing.,4.0,,"I leave around 2am on Mon, open air, allow to smoke at smoking area. Not so expensive on Mon, promotion everywhere but watch out for ++ behind the price, might be beyond your imagine. Tips: Look for the nett price item, or ask them how much its gonna be.
Nightlife is expensive compare to Thailand and Malaysia, if you love to drink, just buy a ticket to Malaysia or Thailand, near enough. By the way, for my experience on Nov 15, promotion for beer is 10SGD *nett price."
,,More bars and restaurants,3.0,,So many places to chose from all with people outside trying to tempt you in. Prices are pretty steep but the views are great. Everywhere looks better in the evening with all the lights twinkling.
,,Night life with options for everyone,5.0,,"A great place to hang-out after hours. Amazing places with live bands ( jazz, rock etc. ), karaoke , pool table etc. You got a place for everyone. Restaurants and foods from all parts of the world, be the kebabs or american burgers. Italian or chinese. You would wish to spend every night of your holiday in Singapore at this place. The place is bustling with activity at 2 am too. Must try the Reverse Bungy & the Gmax ( it closes down around midnight ).Its filled with places to suit every pocket !"
,,Really nice walk,4.0,,Nice walk along the river to Clarke Quay worth a visit. Was quiet when we walked through but we will go back at night to sample it as it had a nice relaxed feel

,,Enjoy the night view,5.0,,"If you wanna sit or walk with your friends near the water, enjoy a little night view, later find some places to eat, Clarke Quay would be an ideal place. Colorful light make this evening a beautiful one, many restaurants and bars to choose. Or you can just walk around, try to take a nice picture from different angle. Make this night memorable."
,,Variety of options for dining and nightlife,4.0,,"Lifehack for boozers on a budget: Buy some liquor duty free when landing at Changi Airport. Pour some in a portable container and drink it on Clarke Quay's Read Bridge before 10:30 PM. Then go have fun at Clarke Quay!

As for Clarke Quay, there's a plethora of restaurants and bars in the area. Late at night, the riverfront is better for eating and casual drinking, while the covered indoor area has the pubs and clubs thumping loud music. Overall, a good place to have a night on the town with your friends."
,,like this place,4.0,,My friend bought some snacks & took us there. It not too large but clean and crowded area. We stayed over 2 hours then go to see the fireworks. Great!
,,not much happening in early evening,3.0,,"Went there just as restaurants were opening for the night and it was pretty slow. I guess the area ramps up much later in the evening. Cool looking places, but not whole lot going on."
,,Lively but expensive,3.0,,"While the quay has many restaurants and bars to choose from, and we saw a fair sized crowd to provide atmosphere, I found the restaurants were very expensive for the quality of food they were serving. Due to the costs and lack of value for money, I couldn't recommend this district for families."
,,GO for weekend,5.0,,If you want to go for enjoy this is the right place in Singapore. Here lots of Bars and Restaurant is there.. you will hear loud music everywhere. You can buy beer from outside n drink on the river bridge. There is one Arabian restaurant is there and they entertain with belly dance for customers..dont miss this dance

Fewof them nice discs as well...

A romantic dinner by the quey..several hotels adjoining the river would be nice... even candle light dinner is available..

If you want a quieter place can go over the bridge to other side of river and there also very nice options for dining avaialble.

Dont miss walking on bridge and sitting with your partner on the river bank observing the calm water and rush on other side of banks in bars..its quiet exceptional experience."
,,Good night life,4.0,,One of the best places to visit in Singapore at night Lot of bars and pubs in this area Nice lighting in the night.
,,Expensive.,4.0,,"There are lots of bars and restaurants where you can come enjoy a drink and dinner, but everything here is very expensive. It's nice to sit out by the Singapore River, especially at night when everything is lit up and pretty. There's a reverse bungee ride if you're brave. Once here was enough for me during my visit."
,,Must go 2 party,4.0,,Nice place to eat and to party. Nice clubs.expensive but everything is Nice.just to drink Pr dance.you câm. Also take dinner.must go
,,Best night life in Singapore,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is where the best night life in Singapore is, clubs, pubs and restaurants across the river for a mile or more of fun. The place gets moving after 22.00 and is very popular among locals and tourists. Some street food available and young locals like to seat and drink a beer or something they bring on the promenada of the river. Prices tend to be high in the clubs and restaurants in this area."

,,The place to go for a meal options,4.0,,"A great place for drink and to sit and enjoy a meal.
Right on the Singapore river there are heaps of nice options from heaps of different cultures.
Also just a nice spot to walk along the river and enjoy an ice-cream on a hot day,"
,,Great place with many varied restaurants,5.0,,Walked the length of Clarke Quay recently watching every menu board and listening to each hawker tell me their best pricing on beers. We eventually found a place selling Jugs of Anchor Beer at S$9 each an unbelievable price and it was nice and cold so we sat at the River side and drank 2 jugs between 2 of us and had a few Spring rolls. We sat at 3pm and happy hour only expired at 7pm what a great deal. Worth the walk and review. The view is great and the beer lovly and cold
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Our hotel was right in the middle of this and the views were amazing. There is food for every taste and a lovely afternoon stroll!!
,,"Go to Clarke Quay at nighttime, heaps of restaurants to choose from!",4.0,,Clarke Quay is a great spot for food and drinks with heaps of variety of choices. It has its own MRT stop so its super easy to get to and is a nice change to the glitz and glamour of Marina Bay.
,,You should visit Clarke Quay day or night,4.0,,"We went for dinner and the festive atmosphere with music and lights made our evening. For those concerned with safety, the police were visible and everyone seemed well behaved even though it was very busy.
Many hotels are located in this vibey district on the river. The lights on the boats and buildings are lovely to see. Restaurants abound in every food type available. I would say that a stay in Singapore would be incomplete without a visit to Clarke Quay."

,,Great Atmosphere,5.0,,"We asked our hotel staff where to find the best Chilli Crab in Singapore and they were emphatic it was at Clarke Quay. This tourist hub boasts restaurants of almost every cuisine as well as bars and clubs.
Safe for families but you'll probably want to eat earlier before the music levels start ramping up. If you'd like a romantic dinner, head riverside and enjoy the lights and the passing boats, or if you want to party, head to where all the noise is coming from."
,,The Center of Singapore Night Life,4.0,,"At least, that's what it seemed to me. A tremendous variety of restaurants, bars, cabarets, music both live and recorded, and it seems like every variety of alcoholic beverage ever conceived by mankind. So all in all, a really fun place. During the Christmas season, the decorations are nice. You can also arrange a boat ride to see the skyline -- worth doing in the evening and easy to do as the quay is directly on the river.
Have a great time. Hope this brief review was helpful."
,,Great location,5.0,,So much going on in the night. Great food. Fantastic live entertainment. Child friendly and great presentation during Christmas.

You can find all kinds of pubs and restaurants here with....They have girls night out on tuesdays with free booz for all the girls..Riverside dining is an added feature..."
,,Overpriced,3.0,,"Clarke quay is a place to wander round and maybe stop for one drink or a snack because at the price of food and drink around here is extortionate.It can be nice and pleasant sitting by the riverside watching the tour boats go to and fro and also to take a trip on one of these boats down to the lion statue and back.the hop off hop on bus stops here and probably an idea to jump off walk around and jump on to somewhere else.A word of caution if you eat here and order chilli crab,look out for the weight of crab because it can work out extremely expensive buying by the gram.At night bars are very busy with loud music but again look for happy hours or 2 for 1 drinks."
,,Nice Place for Dining and Walking,4.0,,This place is located near Singapore River. It is walking distance from China Town and Marina Bay. This plca is very popular for dining and clubbing. It is also very nice for walks.
,,"Nice place for walk, dining and clubbing",5.0,,"It was Halloween night when we went there. It was very crowded yet we enjoyed the live band shows on stage.

,,Evening place,5.0,,"The place comes alive in the evenings. Good place to spend time. The variety of restaurants, hangout places can keep one occupied till late in the night."
,,Great place but not wheelchair/pram friendly!,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is an amazing place, full of life, action, and a great 'buzz'. Unfortunately our visit there was marred by the difficulties we encountered in accessing it with the wheelchair I needed to use at the time. After being told by our Hotel we would be able to get there with a wheelchair, we were disappointed to get the the other side of the beautiful Read Bridge and be confronted by about 15 steep steps with no ramp in sight! Quite upsetting and bewildering since it is a pedestrian bridge - would think it would cater for disabled people and families with prams! We found our way across by trekking up to Hill Street traffic bridge but then, to access the river-side walk, had to negotiate our way down a slope, with a choice or grass/dirt or a very impractical cratered cement surface! Thankfully, once we finally made it to Clarke Quay we found it to be an fantastic place and had an amazing meal at the Butchers Club. Would get a taxi next time though!"
,,Superb Place for night life,5.0,,"It was a great experience in Clarke Quay with my family, as I had spend around 6 hrs. in this beautiful place.

,,A good and lively place for spending an evening/s,4.0,,"We went there with our family just for a short time in the evening. It was crowded. Beautifully lit, colorful and lively with music everywhere.

Beautiful Singapore river and a arc bridge looks fantastic.

There were boat rides. Boats are beautifully decorated. Those boats looked like electrical boats with no noise.

Lots of food places along the side of Singapore river.

There is also a reverse bungee jumping, if you are adventurous.

Overall a lively place for a long/short evening to spend time."
,,It's a must. Don't miss it !!,5.0,,"A fun place to visit at night for dinner. Very crowded on Saturday
night when we were there for a meal. Please go across the bridge
to the other side of the river as the menu price is cheaper.
The open air seatings were full so we had to have dinner inside
but still enjoyed seeing the activities outside through the glass
window. Very pleasant experience for a night out in Singapore.
Be there ! We shall return !"
,,Pretty,4.0,,"My husband and I visited and walked around. There are various eateries and the place is very colourful. It's probably best to go at night to see the lights, have a drink and eat. Very clean, as is Singapore. Worth a visit."
,,Very touristy,3.0,,We went here the first day we had in Singapore .Hot weather as always.Went there at lunchtime midweek.Almost deserted so kept on being pestered by the restaurants to have a beer and something to eat.Walking on over the bridge some beautiful architecture.I am sure it's very different at night.

,,Perfect,5.0,,"Clarke quay is amazing at night, a massive social hub that will put anyone in a good mood! I watched the 2015 Rugby World Cup here and had dinner on 2 occasions, I would recommend anyone travelling to Singapore on holidays to just visit at night time for dinner! I wouldn't recommend day time if it's hot because there isn't much aircon and the quay is beautifully lighten up at night! Plenty of restaurants and pubs"
,,Too Touristy and a place for the drinking culture,3.0,,"We had a brief look at Clarke Quay and it was just full of tourists doing what they do on a Friday and Saturday night in England. If you like that sort of thing its fine, but we come abroad for the local and historic culture, not the sort of thing we can get at home."
,,NIGHTLIFE,5.0,,"Its a wonderful place for stags/ couples for nightlife. It has many bars , pubs , riverside multi cuisine restaurant. It starts at 6 in the evening and ends early mornings around 4."
,,Visit in the evening,5.0,,"It's an area full of the bars and clubs so better visit in the evening to get a glass of vine or party if you into that.

,,Stunning waterside restaurants,5.0,,Clarke Quay is famous for its stunning waterside restaurants and exciting collection of bars and clubs..

Please be prepared to shell out few extra dollars as the place is much costlier than China Town
,,The place for food and drinks,5.0,,Great place for food and light shopping in the day and live music and alcoholic drinks at the night. Come here during October and join in the beer festival. There's no way you cannot find a place with alcohol within your budget. You can practically drink till dawn here. Tired and need coffee? There's 2 cafes around the area and a 24 hour fast food within walking distance.

,,Singapore’s Pulse,5.0,,"You want to adopt the wait and watch policy while in Singapore, go and spend some time in Clark Quay. Just walk along and take a table in one of the hundreds of restaurant, order a drink for yourself and watch time passing by. What Connaught place is for Delhi, Park Street is for Calcutta, Carter road is for Mumbai – Clark Quay is for Singapore.

When you are in Singapore visit to Clarke Quay has to be on the agenda. It’s always busy and buzzing in the evenings so much so that it can be difficult to get a table in some of the quayside restaurants. The surrounding areas have some great choice of food in really nice settings. However beware when in Singapore, don't expect a cheap night out."

,,Great Nightlife,5.0,,"Pretty live spot. I went here in 2013 as part of a layover in Singapore.

Pretty large area, but expensive, a Corona was $12!!! It was nuts! But overall its a cool spot but you can't wear tank tops or wife beaters or ""singlets"" as they call them out there to any of the night clubs.

Overall, good spot if you are looking for generic night life. I saw a fight there too, hahaha"

,,A must visit!,5.0,,What a wonderful way to spend the afternoon and night. Stroll along the river front and check out all the restaurants. Stop for a drink and watch the life of Singapore. As the sun sets and the lights all come on you can enjoy more drinks or a fabulous dinner in one of the many restaurants. The opportunity for a relaxing time while taking in the real Singapore.
,,stunning at night,4.0,,"wow, so pretty here, walking around by the harbour, and at night its lit up like a Christmas tree! so peaceful just sitting on the steps staring at the lights, but if you like the hustle and bustle there are lots of great restaurants and bars."
,,Funky Town,4.0,,"Really enjoyed the vibe of this place after dark. Restaurants everywhere, lots of people out and about and entertainment on offer. Great place to meet friends for a meal with lots of different cultures on offer or just a great place to hang out like the locals. You can take a river cruise. Great place on the balmy Singapore nights."
,,bottom's up (drink),4.0,,"This place also ""must visit place list"" when you go to singapore. Especially for traveller who like to party or looking for good restaurant with lot of people or hangout with drink beers"
,,Garishly painted set of restaurants by the river,5.0,,Very lively in the evening though not all restaurants open late. Worth visiting for the colourful paint schemes and to have a drink by the river.
,,Great locations to chill out at night,5.0,,"I went there during May 2015, there was a music festival going on and I tried the 'G-max Reverse Bungy'. It was a crazy and extremely exciting experience. I also enjoyed the pub and bars around there, full of tourist and expats."
,,Fun filled Place. Must Visit.,5.0,,"Clark Quay is a must visit place. River Banks, entertainment street, Bungy jump, high rise ride, lots of fun... While I was in Singapore, I used to visit this place every weekend. Lots of Fun."
,,Great place for tourists,5.0,,"almost the hub of activities here in singapore .you'll find everything from the best bars ,a great setting to some gigs and live acts particularly on weekends"
,,Recommended walk,5.0,,"Pleasant and nice walking area close to the bay. Nice shops, possible boat tour, vibrant, young atmosphere. I would go in the evening and catch the light show."
,,Social Gathering,4.0,,Clarke Quay is clearly a place that folks go to hang out. It has a huge number of bars and restaurants and is frankly a fun place to be. Problem is deciding which one(s) to go into. Was there mid week but heard it gets really busy on a Friday and Saturday night. Seemed busy anyway.
,,Good place to visit at night time.,4.0,,It's good place to visit and hangout in the night time with your friends. It's very nice atmosphere and easy to go!
,,Pub food and booze,3.0,,Good for pub food and booze at night. Great atmosphere if you are into those two things. Quite boring if you are not interested in drinking.
,,Beautiful evening hangout,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is one place that HAS to be visited!
Best time- evening till night. The lights are spectacular and you absolutely love the sight of the river with the lighted boats in it cruising along.
The countless restaurants around will set the mood for any evening. Walk around and cross over the bridge...spend time at any one of the eateries.... Nothing to regret at all. One another attraction- there is a fun ride in which the people sit in a cage like chair and shot in the air above, much like a vertical catapult!!!"
,,Great atmosphere at night,5.0,,Wandered up from Chinatown on a Friday night. A lot of variety for food and drinks and plenty of nightlife - Oktoberfest was in full swing! Took a night cruise on the river - highly recommended especially if there is a bit of breeze.
,,Looking Rather Worn,3.0,,"Clarke Quay is probably the better known of the riverside attractions in Singapore but I think it's perceived popularity has lulled it into a sense of security as I believe Boat Quay and Robertson Quay are far better destinations. Also, while its two neighbours are alive and bustling from midday onwards, Clarke Quay only seems to wake up at night, during the day it just looks grimy, dirty and dead. I think certainly Boat Quay has far more to offer in terms of number, range and variety of restaurants and bars while Robertson Quay is more upmarket, cleaner and more attractive.

I think a major upgrade and face lift is needed otherwise it's going to become somewhat seedy."
,,family room,5.0,,"what a beautiful place.the rooms were large real family rooms, nothing was to hard for these people to help you with. Lovely pool to swim in. Great breakfast"
,,Nice walk way for morning or afternoon activity and a happening place at night,4.0,,Nice walk way for morning or afternoon activity and a happening place at night. One can do river cruise as well. Good place for food lovers as well.
,,Better at night,4.0,,"If you are going to visit here then night-time is obviously best when the place has come alive. In the morning it is just like walking by a river with a lot of closed restaurants around. When it is 'open' then it has a lot more going for it - the hustle bustle of a lot of people, bars, restaurants and night clubs. Was here 5 years ago as well and it definitely is looking in need of a bit of 'touch up' these days"
,,a must place to go at night,5.0,,good for all ages great atmosphere loads of places to eat and drink boat restaraunts all lit up live music whole area looks great at night don`t miss it
,,The best Singapore's nightlife scene,5.0,,This venue really attracted me with the view that has been organised by the Government. Either you choose to sit down in the many cafés / clubs there or in the stairs that face the Singapore river with the boats on it. I love being here personally.. I can enjoy the beautiful voice from café's singer or I can overlook to people who take the G-Max Reverse Bungy which is a landmark in Clarke Quay.
,,Amazing place to while the evening,5.0,,"A friend took us to the Clarke experience & what a place it turned out to be. Food stalls from most countries, non stop entertainment the beauty of the place it self & of course the crowds. It was the perfect place to end the day"
,,OK to visit,4.0,,"We went to Clarke Quay on a Sunday afternoon by MTR very easy to get there. It is a bit run down, definitely in need of a 'face lift'. We had a drink and small meal in one of the Restaurants that was pleasant as we had a table near the river edge.
I think this place would have more atmosphere at night and would look better in the night lights."
,,Nice view from the small bay,4.0,,"An interesting and tourist heavy area. The bum boat ride gave us a good view from the water with a photo op for the Merlion. The boat plays a tape of what you are seeing so you also get a bit of background. Lots of places to eat or catch a cold drink (and you'll want one). a fun, busy and safe place to explore."
,,Singapore river,5.0,,Singapore river. Clark Quay Dinning..... Go around Singapore river with boat Challenge your adrenalin
,,A friend of mine suggested me to go and I have been there... amazing!,5.0,,Clarke Quay in Singapore is the new river spot by the British architecture firm Alsop. A well done job made by architects and engineers as a strong collaboration that has been crucial to the success of the project. The redevelopment of the river front gives the area a new identity where past and present flow in a rush of excitement. It consists of covering through an Eco-roof the path way along the riverside and also between old shop-houses and warehouses and creating a fountain at the cross of the streets.
,,Suited for relaxing water-side evening,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is surrounded by water on its sides, and hosts many restaurants and clubs. It's among the most happening places in Singapore if you are planning a visit in the evening/night. Surrounded by colourful fountains at almost each entry, you can expect to be welcomed by some amazing street performances before you make your way to the restaurants around the water. Go for the view alone, it'll relax your mind.

There are a wide variety of restaurants, including India's own - Pind Balluchi (Punjabi) - though we went for local cuisine since we wanted to experiment.

But if you are a VEGETARIAN, be prepared to explain them what NOT TO INCLUDE in the meal - they confuse veg with vegetables and can get you non-veg food with more veggies in it. Also, the food is on the expensive side - a plate of rice and another of noodles costed us $24 total."
,,a nice place to chill,4.0,,"if your in singapore and want to explore its night life, this is the place. a lot of pubs and clubs to let your hair loose. the bridge which is an iconic place has died down after the new liquor laws."
,,"Restaurants, hotels and bars",4.0,,"Just about every restaurant type imaginable. Probably hundreds of different beers and drinks. It has atmosphere, although in some spots it's a little grotty. The walk along the river is pleasant although on a hot day it's too sweaty, thus the need to stop for a beer. It's a night time spot, hardly too many people there in the day. Rock up after 8.00pm and have a drink and a meal. Good stuff. There's the river cruising for the older folks and night clubs for the young at heart."
,,Good food and atmosphere~,4.0,,"I have been to Clarke Quay several times in the past on my business trips to Singapore. However, this recent visit was my first with my family (with small kids). This time, I only visited during the day to eat at a nearby restaurant and to take the river cruise from there . Clarke Quay is very different between day and night. I must say...the atmosphere at night is much better. All in all, Clarke Quay is a definite place to visit while in Singapore, especially at night."
,,Quite Dull during the day,4.0,,"Very quiet during the day, a lot of reviews about buzzing @ night however. Known for a spot for great night life, not much to do during the day. Some old looking buildings, shades of faded colour on them for a bit of an olden look.

Although the Bumboat hop on/off point is located at Clarke Quay, it is a pretty good starting point, although night time would be a better go for the Bumboat as well."
,,Expensive nigt,2.0,,Went to a few bars here. Looked amazing but very bad customer service in the 4 bars we went to. Going back for afl finals to a diff bar
,,Great atmosphere,5.0,,A good place to come and enjoy a drink or have a meal in one of the many many bars or restaurant's in the night good vibrant place lot of action.
,,Lively bar scene,3.0,,This is like London Soho but beside a river. Ideal for expats and the younger travelers looking for a party night out. Loads of bars and cafe-diners to choose from. The main streets are under cover so you can still enjoy the outdoor atmosphere while its pouring down. For a more sedate and refined view of Clarks Quay just crosas the Bridge and sit in Harrys and watch the world pass by.
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"All in the family visited this amazing place every evening, not just for food but for walking long hours on river side. Bridges on river are so cool in the night that you can fall in love with the place."
,,"Quite by Day, Buzzing by Night",4.0,,"The converted warehouse in the Quay are now filled with restaurants and Cafe. The place is very quiet during the day, but in the evening is restaurants and nightclubs change this into a lively place."
,,"Loud, Expensive, Overrated. Give it a miss!",3.0,,"Not my idea of a fun night out, this place is a hotspot for teenagers and early 20's youngsters looking to get drunk and loud. Mixed in with blaring music, crowded 'nightclubs' and a few working girls, this place is, contrary to public opinion, very avoidable."
,,Peaceful & teeming with activity at same time!!,5.0,,Whether you are looking for a peaceful time by riverside on a dark calm evening or looking for an adventurous extreme sport to lift you 50feet above ground in less than a minute then Clark quay is a place. Popular among tourist and locals alike but simply not a place for tourist not to miss
,,Decent option for nightlife in Singapore,3.0,,"Clarke Quay is full of many restaurants, bars and live music. A decent option for nightlife in Singapore. The dining options are average; while the number of restaurants are sufficient, don't expect a high quality dining experience here in general. There are some average options for bars and live music, and most places are open late. Convenient to get to by public transport including MRT (Purple or Green lines)."
,,Nice place to spend weekend evening,4.0,,"Celebrated Halloween in Clarke quay ... It's a nice place with number of clubs and food joint ... My personal favorites are Attica and Shiraj ... For clubbing and for food

If you are in Singapore then this is one of the place to enjoy night life"
,,Upmarket Boat Key,4.0,,"Clark Key is the alter ego to nearby Boat Key. It is modern and slick, more representitive of today's Singapore. The bars and restaurants tend toward comfort food for expats and tourist. The food is good, but pricey. it's also a wonderful place to sit and watch the world go by. You can also pick up a boat tour or water taxi and enjoy the trip down to Marina Bay"
,,Feeling homesick?,2.0,,"Well, if you are, then--and only then--should you hang out at Clarke Quay i.e. expat central. Frankly, I didn't travel 8k miles to have some wings at Hooters... The only instance I can see enjoying this brief shopping and eating zone is if you're an expat resident living unwillingly in SG. Otherwise, make tracks to the nearest food court and avoid this."
,,Just a cool vibe and atmosphere,4.0,,"Yes, its touristy, yes its expensive, and YES its a great people watching smorgasbord. I went here twice to eat, and it was a blast. Definitely go here. It is safe, and you don't HAVE to buy anything, can just go people watch. Especially the Bungee ride!"
,,The place to be,4.0,,The place to be for nightlife. Ample bars and clubs to choose from. Just a warning that the booze is not cheap! $40+ for a jug of beer. Was stung $150 for a 4lt tiger tower. Ask the price before ordering.
,,A nice place to enjoy the night life,4.0,,"A nice place to enjoy the night life. You can find almost everything here! Unique restaurants, cool merchandise stall and amazing ambience."
,,Quite place,5.0,,Was a quite place of morning took my breakfast down there ate every morning watch the boats go by But also great attraction with lots food and shopping. It picks up of a evening with lots stuff going on
,,Amazing Night life,5.0,,A must visit place to see a real night life in Singapore..A quiet place on a river bank to hang around..You can have a boat ride too..On the other part of Clarke Quay..decent night life view..A walking Street..Excellent experience..Must watch..

,,BEAUTIFUL,5.0,,"Amazing place to just walk around, listen to music, chill.. Lovely ambience for light conversation and photography."
,,Not much during the day but better at night.,4.0,,"I first visited in the daytime and nothing much was open and there were few people about, but I returned at night and the place was packed, bars and restaurants were open and the vibe was much better."
,,All about bars and restaurants,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is a lovely area on the waterfront surrounded by primarily lots of bars and restaurants, with some shopping thrown in as well.

It's a big tourist area at night and is a noisy area with lots of loud music due to all the bars and restaurants vying for everyone's attention.

It's a nice area to relax after a day of sightseeing."
,,Super touristy but a fun night out,3.0,,A fun night out with a multitude of bars and restaurants... but expect many drunk expats and even more tourists. The other side of the bridge (more the business side) has some nicer bars and restaurants worth checking out.
,,Shopping and Nightlife,4.0,,"Clarke quay is a must visit after a hard day at work. While most of Singapore closes by 8 pm, the restaurants here are open late. There is a wide choice of cuisines to suit every palate. Sit by the river and watch the boats sail lazily by. Or move further inside for fine dining options. The area is very lively and colorful at night.

For the shopaholics, there are shopping malls across the river. You can also buy river cruise tickets at the quay.

A must see attraction in Singapore."
,,Fab place,5.0,,"One place in Singapore you simply can't miss to go.. night or day. This is such a lively place.

There are so many eatries and night clubs at one end and such calm and mesmerising restaurants by the river on the other side.

Clarke quay also plays you host to some of the amazing food. MUST GO!!!"
,,Nice nightlife area!,4.0,,I walked around here both daytime and nighttime and enjoyed the feeling of being in the area. It's more fun at night though as you can see the cool lights and the weather starts to cool down so you can sit outside and enjoy the atmosphere by the river.
,,Very busy but very good,5.0,,"When in Singapore this has to be on the agenda at least once. Very busy and buzzing in the evenings, it can be difficult to get a table in some of the quayside restaurants but much better than sitting inside. Great choice of food in a really nice setting. As always in Singapore, don't expect a cheap night out."
,,Good place,3.0,,This is one of the popular place i though. If you come here dont worry about the food. Many couple come here at the night and enjoy the river. Of course you can take a boat too.
,,Night attractions at Singapore,5.0,,"Titled it like a search word. How cheesy of me but true. I did it on the morning. Because daughter wanted to Gmax. A crazy ride that shoots a metal frame in a split second high into the sky. Adrenaline junkies please note!
At night, it's a different bustle/energy. I think more beautiful. Dancing fountains. Colourful lights. Gummy gooey turkish ice cream. Short ribs. Tiger beer. Chinese restaurant- Ma pa Tofu. Satiating. Period"
,,Full of lights,4.0,,"A must go place especially at night, very lively , full of lights , countless number of restaurants (with all types of cuisine) , coffee shops and bars."
,,Lively attraction,4.0,,"I heard about this place many times before, but it's not until this time I could visit it. It's an entirely different place of Singapore compared to other places. The area in the centre is very lively (at night) with lots of restaurants and bar (with all types of cuisines and cultures), whilst in day time it's leisurely with several coffee shops and bars along the river. The boat trip looks kinda fun. What I like most is dining at restaurants which have seats along the river, really amazing."
,,Clark Quay,5.0,,Fun and interesting place to walk around and stop for a meal or drink. Many restaurants to chose from. Staff friendly and nice to sit by the river and watch the boats sail past
,,A must when visiting singapore,5.0,,This place is a must go at might when visiting singapore Great atmosphere with awesome lighting from the building and the boats in the river with many top restaurants in the area Check out Jumbo restaurant that serves an award winning chilli crab
,,Nice place,4.0,,This palce is a good place to relax after a hard day around in Singapore. There is a lot of good eating places here and a good night life. Al so smaller kids fell okay here
,,Lots of activity and restaurants,4.0,,"We stayed here at the Novotel. Good location, lots happening at night but dead during the day. Close enough to the MRT and you can walk towards the marina fairly easily. Fort Canning Park is nearby and worth the climb. Great choice of restaurants but don't expect it to be cheap or service to be great. Nice to sit by the water though and food quality is good."
,,Singapore without a doubt,4.0,,"Don't show up before 6 because CQ does not wake up until the sun is about to set. Of course, this is Singapore so it won't be girls gone wild or spring break in Miami but it's a great place to enjoy a few beers and dinner. Maybe a little overpriced, but it's S'pore so sit back and enjoy it."
,,Great place to eat and people watch,5.0,,"Clarke Quay has a great variety of restaurants and bars to suit all tastes. Outside dining in the evening heat was just great. Even with a 2 year old, there was lots of music for her to be entertained."
,,Good night activity,4.0,,"Decided to have a look at Clarke Quay in the night time as against the day on previous trip.

There are plenty of places to eat and a number of good bars available. Prices look to be a bit high but restaurants will do you a bargain in competition with each other.

There is also the opportunity for a boat ride - we didn't take that opportunity as there were lineups and we just wanted to have a meal.

All in all - a nice place to spend the evening."
,,Great place to experience Singapore's nightlife,4.0,,"We had a wonderful weekend in Singapore completed by visiting Clark quay on Friday night. But I guess this place is always alive at night, any day of the week! So definitely recommended if you are in Singapore & looking to have fun with your friends or a partner."
,,Perfect place for night life,5.0,,Clarke Quay is the place for Singapore' s night life. A variety of pubs and restaurant all lined up add to the spirit and the vibrancy of the place. It's also famous for its multi-cuisine restaurants.
,,Fun place to be in,5.0,,"Definitely a place to go if you are in Singapore. Especially in the evening. The day I was in Singapore, there was a music festival happening here on a saturday night. Which made this place more lively and fun. We went from one bar to another. There are several to choose from. Many bands playing."
,,Wonderful Nightlife,5.0,,"Congrats on Spore on an excellent nightlife spot, was so much better than a decade ago when I was here. Simply delightful and entertaining place!"
,,Great spot to Eat & Drink the night away,4.0,,Bet at night time to visit with so many eateries and places to party at. Loved the colourful buildings and the walk along the Quay. Shopping centre nearby and take the MRT to get there.
,,Great spot for people watching,4.0,,"What a great spot in Singapore. It is always bustling with a mix of bars and restaurants and people of all ages. You can easily spend hours relaxing, eating, drinking and people watching."
,,DInner venue,4.0,,"Ideal place to search for a restaurant for dinner while walking by the SIngapore river. Just if you're not in the market for a drink or dinner, don't bother"
,,One place,4.0,,"Its a place with so many things to do and lots of good food avaiable too ,other than the usual shopping ,we can sit by the seaside ..nice and relaxing"
,,Best Place to hang out,4.0,,"There are a lot of food eateries, pubs and drinking place you could found at Clarke Quay. It is definitely a nice place to hang out. I was there to try out Jumbo Seafood, and walk around after my dinner there. Very nice place to come at night. It is beautiful and you will be attracted by all of the restaurants here."
,,Expensive Nightlife in Singapore,4.0,,"There are many restaurants to chose from and a shopping mall across from the street of restaurants. Nightlife is active, as you can see many parties nearby on that same street, and even you'll see some musical performers out on the street. The cuisines around Clarke Quay vary and include Indian, Thai, Chinese, Western, Seafood, and others. However, this food is extremely pricey, even for Singapore standards. Don't regularly eat here unless you can afford it. Make sure while you eat you capture the view of the many colors of Clarke Quay buildings and the water below.

There are some ride attractions around the area, should that be your interest. There is a boat ride on the water below the restaurant area and there is a slingshot coaster nearby, which is great for thrill seekers. It can often get busy and sometimes a wait will be required before you get to sit down.

It's nearby other attractions in central tourist Singapore, as well as the MRT, so be sure to stop by for a view if you're not eating!"
,,Best Party Place in Singapore,4.0,,"If you really want to see how good a night life does Singapore have, then visit this Clarke quay on a Friday or Saturday evening !! This place is electric on weekends and just turns into a big party place during nights! Food, Bars, Pubs, Clarke quay has everything! For those who love adventure, the crazy trampoline is suggested!"
,,Night or day,4.0,,"Worth a visit, lots of foodie places, themed venues (Hooters etc.), bum boats up and down the river, night or day."
,,Great area for tourists night out.,3.0,,"This area is suitable for all ages. They have fun place for kids. A lots of choices for restaurants, pubs, boat ride and night clubs. I brought all my first time visitors here and they're enjoyed."
,,Good place to have fun,5.0,,Great to spent time here with your friends. Use the happy hour to get the drinks cheaper. The bars are open to dance and having fun.
,,Cute but be aware,4.0,,Prices at many of the restaurants in this charming area can be deceptive so make sure you know what you're getting into. Perfect for a stroll to see both old and new buildings or on your way to the more modern harbor.
,,Great night life,5.0,,"Not far from our hotel, so we decided to walk there and have a look for somewhere to have dinner. It is an extremely busy place with many restaurants, nightclubs and bars. Chose an Indian Restaurant where we sat overlooking the river. colourful. Certainly not the cheapest area to dine in but a great place if you want a view and colourful lights."
,,Beautiful scenery,4.0,,"This place is a must if you're planning to visit Singapore. The icon for Singapore, Merlion, is close by. There are many restaurants and bars, tourists, local and expatriates often spend time here during the evening after work. Right across the bay, you can see the Marina Bay Sands, one of the most beautiful hotels in the world. I would say spending two hours here would be sufficient unless you spend time eating in one of the restaurants."
,,Good for a walk and for food too,4.0,,"A busy area when dinner time starts, and until late at night...
It is quite crowded and might be noisy too, but it is worth going there once.
The place offers a great choice of restaurants Spanish, Persian, steaks etc, and several bars of course for long drinks and beers after dinner!
Not the most picturesque place of the city, but intersting to discover."
,,Cool area.,5.0,,"Great place to check out both in the day and at night, but I would chose night if you have to. Overpriced area but it's so pretty and colorful."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"We took the MRT to get to Clarke quay as we had seen it from the river last time we were in Singapore. We were so disappointed. Staff seemed miserable, place was very grubby. There are much nicer places to spend a day in Singapore, unfortunately this is not one of them."
,,One of the highlights of the trip!,5.0,,"We loved the Clarke Quay. We had a nice seafood dinner at a table by the river, then took a bumboat ride down the river to Marina Bay. We love the boat ride down the river underneath all the lighted bridges, passing all the other brightly lit bumboats. When we reached the Marina Bay, we were able to stop and watch the light show. It was good, but watching it from Merlion Park several days later was much better. We still enjoyed out night out on the boat and at Clarke Quay. The lights and the fountains, and river views make this a wonderful place to spend an evening in Singapore!"
,,Hang out street,4.0,,"Nice place to spend evening with friends ,variety of food n drinks. Look out for drinks offers n pizza r really gud"
,,Good atmosphere,4.0,,There is a good atmosphere and almost full of people all times at night... Many different places to go out... Drinks are a bit expensive though...
,,nightlife in singapore,3.0,,"Nice ambience but over pricey for the food. If you want to have cheaper one, get proper meal inside of mall (at basement)."
,,Food,4.0,,"This place is good to have a walk along the riverside during the afternoon. There were a variety of restaurants to choose from. It was nice to sit outside near the riverside to enjoy your lunch/dinner. The nightlife is better here, as the atmosphere is better and lots of bars around this area. There is a small shopping mall nearby and the MRT is just a few minutes away!"
,,Artifical but entertaining,3.0,,As Singapore itself it's new and lacks a bit of charme. But if you are there for good fun in a lot of different bars and restaurants then it is a sweet shop for adults.
,,"Full of life, colour and people",5.0,,"We always make a point of visiting Clarke Quay whilst staying in Singapore. During the evening, it is a vibrant, happening area full of waterside bars, restaurants, cafes, arcades, shopping malls etc., etc. (the area tends to be a bit quiet during the daylight hours)
During our most recent visit, we twice enjoyed dinner at a nice café located there, overlooking the river. Gentle breezes off the river sometimes provide some relief from the oppressive humidity of Singapore’s tropical climate.
If you choose to do so, you can board a “bum boat” at Clarke Quay for a scenic river cruise.
However if you just want to wander around the area, you will find buskers providing street entertainment, mobile vendors selling ice cream and various activities aimed at occupying and entertaining the young and “young at heart”.
If however, you just want to spend some time taking a breather and having a rest you can just sit quietly and watch the world, water and boats go by. However finding a public bench to sit on, to do so, may be something of a challenge.
Clarke Quay is recommended as a place to visit for couples, family groups and anyone simply seeking an enjoyable night out or just wanting to sit quietly and “chill’."
,,Party place...,4.0,,"Clark Quay is a great place just to walk around and take in the atmosphere...colourful and vibrant with the river flowing by & bridges lit up for the evening; great for taking photos day or night. There's a great selection of food stalls & restaurants to eat and drink, bars and clubs for all kind of entertainment or even relax by the river.

The river cruise is fun, especially at night, however, don't opt for the dinner cruises as these are at inflated prices. Eat from any of the food stalls lining the Quay & take the river cruise at $30 Singapore dollars. There's a fountain at the centre & its fun to watch kids and adults dodge the fountain flows. The various bars also project shows on large wide screen TVs.
The place can get very crowded & during evenings so would need to keep an eye on young kids."
,,Great night,4.0,,we spent a couple nights on the Clarke quay and it was great nice bars and some great restaurants I recommend For a all round good night
,,Disney land meets Singapore,3.0,,"Before visiting we saw a report on the news about the struggle to get customers here, especially families. I think the venue was lovely, we loved the boat trip we did, the look of the place was a bit plastic but unusual enough to be fun.

The restaurants looked lovely by the water especially at night, BUT there were no child friendly eateries, the prices were really high for Singapore ($7 for a soft drink but $8 for a beer)!! I feel this venue has a long way to go to move from the drinking night out venue it's known for to attracting families in the day or early evening.

But, if you would like to visit somewhere different, and a bit theme park like then go,."
,,Clarke Quay is a must see,5.0,,"We ate at Motorito near the water. Saturday afternoon. Delicious Marguerita pizza, great house wine, fabulous helpful charming staff and we watched the world go by. Fantastic allround. Clarke Quay is buzzy and fun a must see when in Singapore"
,,A great vase for a stay in Singapore,5.0,,A great place to stay n Singapore as its convenient to get around on the MRT and on foot and in the evenings it comes to life when the bars and restaurants fill up. Good to see the boats go by.
,,"Overpriced food, too many people, some very bad restaurants",1.0,,"Not worth going to, unless you like to DRINK!

The most popular(?) restaurant consistently has a 40-60 minute queue during dinner time. The queue system is ridiculous and works by phone numbers - if they can't call you, or if you miss the phone call, tough luck.

Many restaurants here impose the extra 10% tax, so you are paying 17% tax. Ridiculous. If you look at the individual restaurant reviews, you'll rarely see anything over 6.5/10.

If this is one of the best places that Singapore has to offer, I am deeply disappointed."
,,"Fun, great view, lots of choice",5.0,,"A really nice place to have a nice stroll along the river side and have a bite to eat! There is lots of food choice, anything you can think of they had a Restuarant for it all in one area! The views were really pretty! The drinks are quite pricey but food is response! It's kind of outside but under shelter to so doesn't matter if it's sunny or raining!"
,,Singapore...lovely but very expensive,4.0,,"Clark Quay is fantastic with music and lots of bars and restaurants. BUT coming from Australia where the rate is 1 of 1 the food was very expensive and beer drinkers...even if you had a feed, you needed to look for a 2 for 1 deal and even then it was around $9 a pint. This actually seems to be a trend across Singapore. Its a very expensive place unless your rate is in your favour. Its been 6 years since I was last there and personally I could not afford more than a day or 2 there"
,,Great Nightlife,4.0,,"Clarke Quay, that s the place to go in the evening. The boattrip on the river really has a great view. The prices are a little high in the restaurants here so if you want to save a little money maybe eat at one of the food courts before you go here."
,,Great Selection For Entertainment,4.0,,We visited on our first evening. It offers a great selection of places to eat and drink. Some of course end in the evening and others into the early morning. Nice place to take a short walk and photos if needed
,,Great Place To visit,5.0,,"I was visiting Singapore for work by myself, it was a great place just to walk around and take in the atmosphere... as well great places to eat!"
,,"Food, food, drink and food!",4.0,,"Great place to find all manor of foods from around the world. Take a stroll a long the quay and out into the bay were you can experience the de verse architecture of Singapore. There further you come away from the bay the cheaper the food, wine and beer becomes. Well worth the walk."
,,Excellent place for a night out....,4.0,,"An excellent place to visit at night even with your kids. There are wide range of restaurants, bars and clubs for all kind of entertainment or even relax by the river watching the boats go by."
,,Amazingly Beautiful Experience,5.0,,This is a must do activity after 8 pm and I am so sorry no one on Trip Advisor mentioned the laser show and the fountains show every night at 9.30.We took a river cruise at 9 and absolutely loved the experience. Don't waste money on dinner cruises at inflated prices. Walk to Clarke Quay eat wherever you want to and take the river cruise at $30 Singapore dollars and enjoy . there are amazing food stalls selling food at inflated prices but less than grossly inflated restaurant prices
,,Nice place for chill,4.0,,"At Clarke Quay, you can enjoy food, night life, lots of fun activities here. You can also enjoy boat ride in the Singapore river. You can get all types of food here."
,,Where it is happening,4.0,,"Staying at the Novotel Clark Quay put my wife and I right in the middle of Clarke Quay. Right in the heart of Singapore it is close to the MRT, bus stops and boats. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes to choose from to meet your needs. At night the excitements starts. Plenty of taxis if you need to get somewhere fast. It is colourful and vibrant, great for taking photos day or night. Check it out."
,,Vibrant place morphs at night,4.0,,"One stop on the MTR from Chinatown Clarke Quay is abuzz of an evening and night time. On one side of the river there are bars and nightclubs and restaurants as well as the Reverse Bungy Ride- a great area for people watching or great viewing of other peoples terror rides- are you game? Highly recommend a visit here at night unless you have young children ( under 10 years) - then come during the day- I dont suggest bringing them here at night -- as it may be a bit overwhelming with the crowds of drinkers partygoers and clubbers lining the boulevard.
This place is noisy and reminds me of the Sound System battles of the West Indies in the mid 60's with all the bars fighting to have the loudest music- But at least a lot of the music is Live- great for local artists and I am fully supportive of local musos . 100 meters along from the Bungy Ride is the bridge over the river with the Marketplace hawker food stalls where there is a great selection of food - only one tent serving beer though and all the tables/benches were full so we decided to move on to try to find another eating spot - but we will come back - but earlier in the evening maybe . Thde Irish pub is set on the corner and has Live sports on the screen -"
,,nice riverside view,4.0,,It is a good riverside area. A good place for evening and night walk. The surrounding area is very clean. Really enjoyed walking around here with my friend during my trip.
,,Superb Nightlife,5.0,,"u can stay the whole night here. lotta pubs and restaurants, festive atmosphere. just unwind . chilled out place."
,,Relaxing area to walk,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is an interesting relaxing area. Stop at a bar, restaurant or night club for entertainment. Or watch kids and family dodge the fountain flows in the center. Bars such as Harrys show football(soccer) games on large wide screen TVs. A great atmosphere when Liverpool plays Manchester United for example. Clarke quay is a connecting area to walk and cross the river to continue on down Boat Quay to the Fullerton for example."
,,Great place for hang out!,5.0,,"Clarke Quay - Singapore’s choice dining and entertainment destination. You should walks along the river or through the beautiful covered streets of Clarke Quay. Please buy an ice cream and enjoy:))
A must visit place , especially for the young and i really like this place!!!"
,,Vibrant busy noisy fun place,5.0,,"I love Clarke Quay especially at night it's so pretty with all the lights and the boats on the river.It comes alive at night very busy,lots of people,plenty of restaurants to choose from prices reasonable for Singapore ,bars,nightclubs certainly attracts a huge crowd ,security around there is pretty intense with armed
police presence evident"
,,Restaurant's and Bar's,4.0,,"A lot different restaurant 's and bar's, nice to walk around, very quite during a the day than at night."
,,You can't go wrong here.,5.0,,"Robertsons and Clake's quays are just ace. There is a pup/club/restruant to suit the mood/taste any time of day. I was also there last year during the World Cup (football naturally!) and the atmosphere was absolutely brilliant, one night it was the Germans who were on another it was the Dutch (no Scotland I'm afraid, ah well, here's hoping we maybe make it next time!!!) I just love Singapore, so clean, and it's like the Hanging Gardens of Babylon in most places. Just luv it."
,,"Nice in the day, tacky at night",3.0,,"The pastel colours of the quay are charming and it's a nice place to wonder during the day. Come nighttime it turns into a slightly tacky place with in-your-face music blasting from all directions, not my thing."
,,GREAT PLACE TO ENJOY NIGHTLIFE,5.0,,Its best to go in the evening for it a strip of bars and restaurants. It has a wide selection of different cuisine. Its nice to hang out and people watch and with friends too.
,,Singapore's Best Party Place,5.0,,Singapore visit will never be complete without having a night party ad the best place to get drunk is Clarke Quay. Best selection of Bars and Restaurants. Its a hell of a fun place.
,,Bum boat ride,5.0,,"We enjoyed our walk around the quay area, then stumbled on the bum boat ride. This was offered in a very friendly manner, we discussed our concerns about getting home so late, as we would be missing the very last red hop on and off bus from there. The lady was most helpful. Told us where and how to get home. The cruise was fantastic right on sunset too. Thank you."
,,nice selection,4.0,,This strip of bars and restaurants has a bit of everything for everyone. We had a 24 hour layover in Singapore and went here in the evening to grab a bite to eat. It is really nicely lit up at night and I liked all the different colors of the buildings. The restaurants are good but like everything in Singapore not cheap.
,,a definiate visit,5.0,,"the hearta nd sole of the food and drink scene in Singapore.

if you cannot find something to eat here you must be the fussiest person in the world, there is fine dining, mid range dining and cheap dining. At night time the lights come and river boats are up and down with tours. The dearer eateries are in the trendy part, the more towards Marina Bay you go the better value they become as you move away from the expensive part.

nice and safe and very clean, enjoyed some lovely Indian food at an Indian restaurant just up from Hooters."
,,Fun place with something for everyone,4.0,,"Best in the early evening and I would suggest view from the Central Mall side first.... less busy and food a bit cheaper! Walk along and see the street art , listen to the buskers and try some unusual ice cream flavours from Hokkaido.. Clarke Quay."
,,A leisurely stroll along the Clarke Quay,5.0,,"Whether it is a fine dining choice or an affordable set lunch option, Clarke Quay is the option that Singapore offers its guests. Some of these you can try includes Fullhouse Signature, District 10, Octapas, The Highlander, Peony Jade, Catch Beer and Batter, Hooters Singapore and Ras: The Essence of India to name a few. The place also offers numerous leisure and entertainment options like GX5 and Tang Music Box."
,,Great restaurants and boat trips,5.0,,Lovely place to visit on an evening for a good meal as lots to choose from and also visit during the day and take a boat ride along the Singapore River. Well worth visiting and lovely area to stay in too
,,Bit crowded but nice,4.0,,We've been here yesterday and it was our first impression of Singapore. It was very crowded and the food was a bit expensive. The atmosphere though is incredible and I loved all the colourful lights!
,,Superb joint for meeting friends and beer,5.0,,What best you can get when you sit across the river and the best beer of the town with amazing crowd and superb music. In one week I have been there thrice and simply loved the place. Highly recommended.
,,Lots of eateries and cafés,4.0,,"This is probably the hippest place in Singapore, lots of places to eat and drink; Restaurants, Bars and Cafés. For a westerner tourist, this is where you'll want to visit for night life and to feel a little familiar.

You can do boat tours from here, and shopping is close by."
,,Visit at night,3.0,,"Pleasant evening walk during the hotter season, night lights etc really add to the atmosphere of an energetic city"
,,Somewhere to eat and drink Singapore,4.0,,"For somewhere for everyone's tastes you can't beat along the river at any of the quaysides, and our choice would be Clarke Quay. With a wide variety of different bars, cafes and restaurants there is bound to be something for you! Make sure you get there for 'happy hour' as it will definitely help with the Singapore prices and some place offer 2 hours."
,,A Place for Nightlife Style,5.0,,"Clarke Quary is my FAV place to chill out with my friends, we always tend to go there after we've dinner together. I like to sitting down at the side of river with the alcohol with friends, and like the wind that blow through my hairs that my mind are all clear in peacefully. This is totally the place for those who love nightlife/clubbing/pub to chill out their friends/love/boyfriend/girlfriend,etc."
,,Great spot to walk around and eat at night,5.0,,"I love this area to stroll around, select a restaurant and enjoy a lovely meal. Plenty of bars for a drink before or after or with a light bar menu/deal instead. Plenty of choice of cuisine....simething for everyone. Gets busy so better to head diwn early or a bit later once those early starters are leaving. We were a party of 8 and managed to get a table around 8.30pm after a few tries."
,,The most happening place in Singapore,5.0,,"If you are first time or returning tourist or business professional one must hangout around this place in the evening. Try and make it by 6pm in the evening , the whole atmosphere will be awesome that too on a weekend it will be so lively. Lots of restaurants,bars and pubs and people will be flooded everywhere, dancing to the tunes having good drinks. You can reach out to Raffles Place or City Hall by train from anywhere you are in the city by EastLine, NS. Especially the view of Marina bay and the colourful lights and laser lights makes you thrilled. Most of restaurants and pubs operated till 12.00 am in the midnight."
,,Nice place - Worth a visit,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a definite place to visit if you are looking for a night out with some food and a few drinks.

There are plenty of restaurants and cuisines to choose from and a number of bars too.

Clarke Quay is also a nice place to go for a walk around."

,,A huge range of restaurants,4.0,,"About every cuisine you can think of surrounds the quay. Bustling and interesting during the day, lit up by multi-coloured lights at night, so great at any time."
,,Night-time visit required!,4.0,,Great place to go on week-nights or weekends. Place is full of party-goers. Good but a bit pricy food joints. 7-11 right across the bridge for affordable liquor. Stand by the bridge or sit on the stairs. The place looks absolutely BEAUTIFUL at night.
,,Great nightlife,4.0,,There is so many options for drink and food here your split for choice. Some for the restaurants and bars a overpriced. This are gets very crowded and noisy not a place for young children.
,,Eat by the waterside,4.0,,"loved the chilli crab, a local favourite which I had never attacked previously. Need to get your hands dirty to get most meat from the claws. Made use of tools to eat that you would normally see in a motor repair shop!"
,,Too crowded,3.0,,"Clarke Quay is great for you if you love the nightlife. It's basically lined up with nice restaurants and bars that cater to every social person. Expect everything here to be pricey, though."
,,Good vibe but overpriced,3.0,,"Nice nightlife area, with a good friendly vibe and plenty of bars, restaurant and food places. Loses marks for the cost - most of the places are very expensive."
,,Clarke Quay,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a must visit place for first time visitors or returning ones like us who visit every year .its grown over the years and now there is absolutely everything there whether it be great restaurants bars late night clubbing or simply soaking up a very lively atmosphere lots of fun lighting.but just fancying an ice cream there is an amusing old fashioned ice cream stall on the river side and kids ab love it there the man looks a bit clown like and importantly the ice cream is amazing . Other attractions are a sling shot thrill ride for the brave!!! and if you arnt staying at say the Merchants Court Hotel actually on the Quay the MRT is next door to that for convenience.
So a good place to visit either to stay or get to easily by the MRT or taxi."
,,A must nightlife,4.0,,"Amazing place where to meet the live music , dance, pubs, bars and a lot of restaurant. In the evenings the place is colorful and bright and just make you confortable and relaxed to forget all the fatigue of the day."

,,Clarke Quay,5.0,,"The music , dance, pubs and bars are just amazing. The evenings are colorful and bright and just makes u forget all fatigue with some excellent food."
,,Lots to see and do and amazing restaurants,5.0,,We took a cab to and from. Don't panic if you leave the area in the wee hours of the morning as they have a very civilized taxi cue line and it moves quickly. You can watch brave souls pay to ride on the huge sling shot while sipping on an Aussie beer. WE returned three times to try different restaurants. One night we took the night cruise up to Marina Bay and timed it for the light show. Do not miss this area.....magic I say!
,,Live Music,5.0,,"This is the place to be if you enjoy live music be it Jazz,Reggae or Rock n roll you will find it here very good service at most of the restaurants,be early if you want a table or a place to sit"
,,Great place to visit!,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is a very happening place in Singapore. It is filled with restaurants, shops and beautiful views of river. This place is filled with a lot of crowd at nights. A pleasant experience for people of all ages."
,,Best Pubs in Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore is not complete without a nightout at Clarke Square. Hounded by pubs offering a variety of music to food from all over the world. This is something which is a must when in Singapore. The ambiance is extremely chilled out. Further most of the places offer unlimited drinks for ladies , so its an offer one cannot refuse."
,,A must for Singapore nightlife,5.0,,"This is a really impressive collection of bars and restaurants. If you are going out in the evening in Singapore, this is a must see.

The bars a mostly outside, along the rivers edge. There is plenty of music and street entertainment.

The restaurants have live crabs and lobsters for you to choose from, and some of those crabs are enormous.

Caution though, Singapore is an expensive place. When you go to these outdoor bars, there isn't usually a price list, and you pay your tab when you leave. This can lead to an expensive bill, some of the beers can be £8-£10, so it can get expensive real quick. But as long as you are mindful, then you are guaranteed a good night,"
,,We had 3 enjoyable meals at Clarke Quary,4.0,,"We were in Singapore for 3 days before joining a cruise ship. Clarke Quay is the ideal place for a night out, a good number of restaurants and bars, many that have live music, can be easily accessed by the super underground system."
,,Must visited place,5.0,,"During last year visit with my family, we went there by river cruise from merlion park.
This place at night was full with bars/pubs , resto and merchands stall.
Alot of entertainment but i wont suggest for family dine in with kids where smoking and alcohol drinks everywhere."
,,Great place at night,4.0,,A must see place for all tourists especially at night so many places to eat don't miss this for shopping eating or watch the world go by loads of little stalls selling all manor of Nic nacs.
,,A melting pot of a nightspot!,4.0,,"An intriguing fusion of European Nightlife with Peranakan Architecture, Clarke Quay stands out as the place to unwind in Singapore."
,,The night life part of the city,5.0,,"This place while would have its day time beauty as well, but its real calling comes at night and thats purely because of its location. With restaurants adjoining the riverfront and some of them on the rivers on boats, it gives you a good vibe. Yes, the restaurants are expensive but you do not go here to eat. You soak in the environ, sit down in one of the river side restaurants, to first have your meal and then maybe move into one in many clubs. The shophouses have been done up beautifully and its a good nighttime attraction. It also houses the G Max ride, which you can try if you are adventouros."
,,A really happening place,4.0,,Clarke quay in singapore is a world in itself. This is located by the singapore river and is always crowded with young and old alike. There are numerous restaurants serving cuisines from all over the world.The river cruise and the reverse bungee are an added attraction to this place.The malls around the place are good. Can spend an evening here
,,Visit at night,4.0,,"During the day this is basically just a thoroughfare to get from one side to the other... at night though it is quite a different story. Being a teetotaller I am not into bar hopping, but it was still fun to visit.

This is NOT a cultural experience <g>."
,,Tourist attraction,4.0,,"Decided to see what all the fuss is about and realised after looking at the menus of the cafes and restaurants that the prices are over the top. It was nice to walk up and down the river looking at the buildings, renovated shop houses and the hotels but my husband and I didn't eat here as we thought it was too expensive."
,,Lots of F&B and Entertainment Outlets,4.0,,"This is located along Singapore River and come evenings, this place is crowded with people who's heading to one of the many eateries here.

There are a wide range of food cuisine available and if you fancy a drink instead, you can find a place to cater to your wants or fancy.

Some of the eateries are located along the riverside and if you choose to sit al fresco, you can watch the world sail by and people-watch!

Do visit!"
,,More eating outlets than you can poke a stick at,4.0,,"An amazing choice of fine foods, drinks, eating styles and comfort zones. Either hang out on the river bank or go inside to a finer dining experience - the atmosphere and experiences on Clark Quay were fantastic. Oh - and shopping is also an option..."
,,Family vacation,4.0,,"Great place to enjoy beautiful view and food, the place comes alive at night ,a restaurant named Ras which serves Indian cuisine is good if you like Indian food , they have an outdoor space where they serve food by the river. Great place to hop around and have different tasty foods and some beer"
,,Buzzing with energy... a bit for all,5.0,,"Clarke Quay can easily be defined as a miniature Singapore. The diversity, youthful energy, well thought out outlay, a bit for everyone to eat and do added to a perfect outside-inside layout encashing on a riverside... Singapore yet again lives up to its standards in creating a world class destination with elan.

While some restaurants like the Hutons and Renn Thai are the imposters offering very average fairs for fine dine rates... but mostly the offerings at other places are reasonably dofferentiated. Across the river in the kerbside of riverside mall... the jumbo seafood and cafe iguana continue to be my favorites even after a decade of visiting the city reasonably frequently."
,,Lively night life!,4.0,,"Such a lively night life this place has! Shots, party, chill, name it. This place can give a perfect night out if you really are into it. I don't usually go on a night out, but when I came here, I wouldn't mind going back!"
,,Don't go during the day.,3.0,,"After leaving Merlion Park we jumped on the Singapore River Cruise boats and headed to Clarke Quay. The river cruise was great but arriving in Clarke Quay at 3 O'clock in the after noon was a big mistake as not much was open and no people around.
I think Hooters was the main shop open and their prices are way to high.
The cheapest way to get here is on the subway. (SMRT)."
,,Buzzing Place at Night,4.0,,"One may visit this place at night. It is a buzzing place in Singapore. It is located on both sides of river. There are plenty of eateries, restaurants & bars are available on both sides of river. One can get variety of food at this place. There are number of hawkers, which sell some unique things. River cruises are also available during day & night."
,,tourist trap but alive,4.0,,"clark quay interesting place although a tourist trap it is a lively place to wander .the selection of foods from all over the world mostly western is good and by Singapore standards priced a little high . the cruise on the river to see the evening light show is well worth the effort ,starts about 7.30 and takes 80 minutes $38 per person"
,,A happening place,4.0,,"A happening place by the night with lots of music around, young people and games to play. Good restaurants with free flowing booze , dance and music. A must visit place , especially for the young"
,,"Nice river view, but expensive food.",4.0,,"Very pretty during the day. And very pretty during the night too. We had dinner in one of the restaurants. The view was nice, and the food was decent. But you could get just about the same fare or even better with much better prices at the bigger hawkers market."
,,Good eats but pricey,4.0,,"Took a cab from our hotel to Clarke Quay one night. The place was packed with tourists and locals. We went there to take a boat ride to the Merlion. Clarke Quay is filled with restaurants and wine bars which cater to a broad spectrum. Though it is also a main tourist attraction when you are in Singapore. Some might like it, some might get turned off by the noise and the crowd. Restaurants tend to be pricier than some of the other places which is typical of ""tourist traps"". If you are visiting Singapore and you have time to spare, I guess Clarke Quay is a good stop over but for me, I prefer going there at lunch time when it's a lot more quieter and easier to get a table. But in the evenings, it takes on a different character."
,,if you like it noisy and crowded then do not miss it,3.0,,Clarke Quay is nice in the late afternoon but in the evening it is packed with tourists including noise from different bars and restaurants. Mabe good for a young crowd but we prefer a more relaxing atmosphere which you won't find there. So go there to take the boat for a harbour tour which is worth it especially in the evenings.
,,Great place to eat & watch the world go by,5.0,,"The atmosphere of this place is very different, depending on what time of day you visit, Before lunch it is almost deserted, in the afternoon it it a nice place to have a drink & snack, but the place really comes to life at dinner time & beyond. There are lots & lots of restaurants and bars to choose from and it is a fun place to people watch."
,,COMPLETE ATMOSPHERE CHANGE - APPEAL TO SOME NOT OTHERS,3.0,,"This has been upgraded considerably from the last time I was there. It is now ALL restaurants with plenty of places to drink, but for me I was looking for the more traditional street hawkers that use to line the main street at night along with restaurants, and some cheap market like stalls, long gone I expect. Now, this is not a place for a cheap family meal, and is more of an adult venue at night, admittedly a place to sit back, relax and have a few drinks in one of the many many restaurants, just wasn't for me, but it depends who you are and who with."
,,Go early evening for dinner/stroll,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is a great area to go for dinner, a drink or just a stroll early evening is good, not too busy, Colourful buildings, great atmosphere, and highly recommend to catch a bumboat ride up the Singapore River from here in the evening. We decided to go one way from Clarke Quay to Marina Bay and watch the night laser show. The river trip is beautiful and relaxing. Note this is not a shopping area, its an entertainment area, restaurants, bars, clubs, with a couple of souvenir stands."
,,Let's dance here!,5.0,,"Omg! The night view in here is wonderful! Most of the bar and pub are with very good atmosphere, lots of them has live band show. Music started, let's dance!"
,,Lively nightspot,4.0,,"A cab driver in Singapore once told me ""You'll never go hungry in Singapore"". From the various hawker stalls to food centers in Chinatown and Little India to all the posh cafés and restaurants, Singapore has your stomach covered.

Clarke Quay though is my choice to get my dose of liquor. Pick your poison, Sake to Scotch to Bourbon to the always popular Singapore Sling, Clarke Quaye has your liver covered."
,,Good lively evening place with street of restaurants and sit-out,4.0,,"Good place in the evening with multiple options of restaurants and bars. You can spend some time talking a walk and if you want to save money, carry your own drinks and drink along side the lake. :)"
,,Night out,5.0,,Place was full of life and the atmosphere was very relaxed. We took a trip around and the amount of places for food and drink was amazing.
,,One of Singapore good night hubs,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a historical riverside quay. Today, the are five blocks of restored warehouses house where you can find various restaurants and nightclubs. There are also moored Chinese junks that have been refurbished into floating pubs and restaurants.

Today, this is a major social and tourist component of Singapore attractiveness, and this area has been popular for many decades.

You will enjoy it more at night for its casual and lively atmosphere."
,,Shopping in the 21st Century and food choice impressive,4.0,,Clarke Quay sits just up the Singapore River from the CBD with all its skyscrapers and its a great place for a beer a meal or to explore shops or to eat. There are lovely eating areas out over the river served by the neighbouring restaurants which have fabulous atmosphere. I recommend it.
,,Pub area,3.0,,Pleasant walk along the river up to Clarksville Quay but not impressed with what just seemed to be a row of pubs & restaurants none of which looked enticing to stop at. Suppose it's because food in Singapore is so good & plentiful these venues don't seem anything special
,,A Real Entertainment Complex Remember To Bring Your Wallet,5.0,,Although the food and drinks are a little pricey. This is a great place to be introduced to the Singapore lifestyle. Inside the shopping centre there is a huge range of international and local Singapore brands. I bought a selection of locally made silk scarves.
,,A must visit atleast once,5.0,,I would suggest go to Clarke Quay atleast 3 times. You will never get bored of it. There are variety of restaurants & time passes by like never before. If you manage to get a dining table next to the lake nothing like it. Enjoy drinks & sea food. Excellent place.
,,A must see area for dining and nightlife,5.0,,"Clearly Clarke Quay is a hub of dining and nightlife that has stood the test of time. You can get just about any type of food here and prices range from moderate to expensive. Dining on the river is a must do on your trip and there are a few nice bars with live music in the area,"
,,Amazing atmoshpere,5.0,,I lived in Singapore for a while and used to visit Clarke Quay quite often. It is a great place to walk along the river and have a decent meal at any of the restaurants in that area.
,,Relax along the Singapore River,5.0,,"It was wonderful to do nothing and just sit along the river. Restaurants are multi-type (but expensive), great place to take a walk around."
,,Interesting Quay,4.0,,"Another interesting place to grab a bite or drink within the area.

It's quite small area but we like the ambience.

Just eating and watching people pass by.. A hangout for the locals I guess but we didn't spent too much time here since its kinda crowded. But a cool way to just hang around for the young ones or couples."
,,Interesting place with lots of variety of food and drink,3.0,,"I had heard of Clarke Quay before visiting Singapore and it was stressed to me as a must see. Well, its a lot of hype and its not so flash. Its a real eclectic area of pubs from Ireland, Scotland, Australia, Japan USA, Germany and probably more that I didn't see. So lots of different beers to try if that's what you want. None of it is cheap and the place by day seems run down. Peeling paint and grubby walls don't do much for me. By night I imagine its probably a bit of a buzz, but for the generation or two younger than me I can live without it. Singapore is a beautiful and vibrant city but Clarke Quay doesn't really fit that image any more. Still, I can say I have been there."
,,Clarke Quay,5.0,,"Just a few meters away from the Esplanade is the Merlion Park and One Fullerton, a host of offices and restaurants that have the terminal for the river taxis which cruise the Singapore River to-and-fro Clarke Quay or Riverside Point, another host of restaurants."
,,Nightlife,4.0,,"We went to clarke quay for a look and ended up having a feed, listening to music and people watching. Enjoyed the fact that we could walk from our hotel Swissotel. The prices are not cheap but the food was amazing. To for a walk or look great spot"
,,Night visit,5.0,,"This place was buzzing with people at night time,there are bars and restaurants galore,everywhere is clean including public toilets,there are some fountains in the centre which are very pretty,it was perfectly safe to walk around here even very late at night,"
,,Must visit at night,4.0,,If you visit here you must visit at night. The place lights up and is great just to sit back and take in the moment. If you visit Singapore this is a must see.
,,Quick relax,5.0,,"Nice place to plan a evening spin. The night won't end early, so bring all your energy! Night clubs and bars have variety choices of flavor. KTV is also nice if you like to yell your heart out."
,,"Great to visit, ridiculous to drink if not during Happy hours",3.0,,I thought India was expensive for alcohol. Then I visited Singapore. Granted that this is an expensive Asian city by any standards. But SGD 18-19 for a pint of beer is ridiculous. We visited about 4 bars here on Wednesday night which is ladies night. It wasn't crowded. Just the right number of people so that the place doesn't feel empty but at the same time no queues anywhere. But the drinks were just crazy expensive. There's a bunch of bars here so you can hop around for every drink. This was the only place I visited for alcohol so I don't have a yardstick but this was expensive by most standards.
,,Great Nightlife and hour cruise.,5.0,,We had heard there was a little cruise at night so we went to one of the offices and got on a small boat that was going to stop at the light show at the Marina Bay. There were 14 people on the boat and a Singapore Sling or beer was served. We had a great time. The lights on the buildings were awesome. The pictures portrayed on the waters at the Marina Bay were incredible. Don't miss!!
,,Fun even if you don't want to drink/club,4.0,,"Been here a few times now both on nights out and just walking through. Even if you don't want to drink it's a nice walk with live music, everything lit up and a great atmosphere. In the evening it really looks a lot nicer than you would expect for the main drinking area of a city! All bars seem to serve the signature Singapore Sling and it's well worth a try. Be warned of bars with extremely loud music, I would advice sitting outside if possible to allow an actual conversation to occur."
,,Brilliant place,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a brilliant night spot. Dozens of waterfront restaurants to choose from, bars, markets, nightspots"
,,Like London's Piccadilly Circus/Leicester Square,3.0,,"An Irish pub, karaoke bars, a Mexican restaurant, a Turkish restaurant... Not very authentic Singapore around these parts but if bustling nightlife and clubs is what you're after - this is the place for you!"
,,Best Irish Bar in Clarke Quay,5.0,,"There are many bars and restaurants in Clarke Quay, however for the sports minded, a visit to Clarke Quay cannot be without visiting McGettigans. They have all sports covered with live coverage of all major international events. The food is amazing with a selection of bar snacks with traditional bangers and mash right through to a full 3 course selection. The ambience, location and great staff provide for a fantastic and well recommended visit. Well done to Brendan and his team."
,,Nice hangout place!,5.0,,Clark Quay is packed with nice restaurants and bars so its a great place to hangout with your friend or family.😀
,,The Most Happening place in Singapore,4.0,,"your visit to Singapore is incomplete, if you have not visited Clarke Quay. A complex having more than 70 different restaurants, serving world cuisine along with micro brewery etc. Well connected with MRT and the place rocks in the evening"
,,Serene and peaceful,4.0,,"They have a line of stairs leading down to the river. One could simply sit down and enjoy this place. It is clean, quite and peaceful."
,,Stroll around n click n eat,4.0,,"In a nice weather, Clarke Quay can be the best place to hang around or just sit at a river side restaurant.

The place lights up with colorful vibrant lights and it is no less than a rainbow of boats and joints.

Pros:
1. Glitter
2. Food
3. River side

Cons:
1. You hate sitting outside

Overall rating: 8.5/10"

,,The Night life!,4.0,,"This is the place to go for the night life lots of bars, and restaurants . During the day we took a nice ride down the Singapore river stopped for lunch and then hop on again and then went to the Casino great day."
,,VENICE QUAY,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a historical riverside quay in Singapore. The quay is situated upstream from the mouth of the Singapore River and Boat Quay. At present, five blocks of restored warehouses house various restaurants and nightclubs. There are also moored Chinese junks that have been refurbished into floating pubs and restaurants. The Cannery is one of the anchor tenants of the place. There are over 5 different concepts in one block.

A new Soho concept development come shopping centre called The Central, above the MRT station, you can enjoy the night and have some fun or you can just sitting at the river bank, looking at the boats and crowd while enjoying the beautiful river at night. it’s a must when visiting Singapore."
,,Bland,2.0,,"A couple noisy bars, clubs and restaurants, not worth a daytime visit, full of people trying to get you to go into their restaurants, maybe better at night but certainly nothing special in the day, perhaps good for shopping inside."
,,"Booze, Dancing, Food..",5.0,,"Awesome place to visit at nite.. Love to bar hop from one place to another as there is just so many to choose from!
U can either dine by the river or move inside to the many clubs n bars lined the pathways..
""Highlander"" n is one awesome place with live band music n good drinks.."
,,Very Peaceful and Romantic,5.0,,"My wife and me spent 3 hours, just sitting on the shore of Singapore river and talking to each other. there are lots of eating joints, Bars, and Discs to enjoy in this area. But the best part is you can sit here for long with your loved ones and observe the silence of water."
,,must see,5.0,,"A lively area with original buildings on the river. there are plentiful and varied restaurants, later the area livens up with night clubs. A good shopping mall is built around the underground station. Riverboats take tourists up and sown the river."
,,hip and fancy area on a riverside,5.0,,"if you want to have to enjoy the night and have some fun, then you should visit clarke quay.

the riverside area that is hip and fancy with many bars and pub with live music throughout the night.

or you can just siting at the river bank, looking at the boats and crowd while enjoying the beautiful river at night.

this is also a must visit in singapore at night.

don't forget to dress nicely :-)"
,,Night life spot....,5.0,,i had heard a lot about this place from others. the right time to visit is after 8pm and that too on weekends. The whole singapore comes to life here. u can enjoy the river cruise also from here. food is very expensive here. u get a very good atmosphere here...
,,Loved it,4.0,,"Plenty of restaurants, lovely and enjoyable place. Very clean. Free music (band). Night life was safe everyone was friendly. Service fantastic"
,,bustling spot,5.0,,"Lots to choose from under lights next to the canal. From pubs to 5 star, just a bit pricey but great ambience."
,,Lively!,5.0,,"Loads of restaurants, bars and nightclubs to choose from. Great for a stroll along and choose wherever takes your fancy. We went in the evening when it really comes to life."
,,THE Party Place in Singapore,5.0,,"CQ is an absolute delight. A dull day-time area magically transforms into this high-pitched, pulsating party spot at night! It has a plethora of restaurants, pubs, bars, something to suit every taste...and then some! We stayed at the Somerset Liang Court next door, and came to CQ for dinner almost every other night. However, take advantage of the competition and scout around for bargains- happy hours sometimes go on till midnight! A beer is normally $10-15, so its not that cheap too. Another favourite pass-time is to just carry a beer or two, sit on the wide edges of the bridge crossing over to the South (Read Bridge) and take in the views and the pulse. Even if you're in Singapore for ONE night, you must visit Clarke Quay."
,,Lively,5.0,,"Brilliant!

I visited Clarke Quay both in the day time and night time

During the day there's lots of restaurants and bars and there's a huge shopping mall down one side of the quay. There's quite a relaxed chilled out atmosphere :-)!

All through the day and night there are boat trips along the quay all the way down to the Mariana Bay.

At night time the quays lit up with lots of bright lights and all the bars and restaurants and busy with all types of people. There's many karaoke bars and also live bands playing.

I'd recommend a visit even if your not dining out, family's are very much welcome all day long."
,,One of my favourite hangout places,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a riverside walk with lots of cafes, restaurants, and bars that you must visit whenever you go to singapore. You can take a boat tour from clarke quay that will take you around the river. Its worth it"
,,Lovely night out lots to choose from,5.0,,"We went there to see if we could find something for dinner that we would all like (2adults 3 kids) there are hundreds of restaurants to choose from we had dinner at the Irish pub which was great , we wandered around for a good hour and a half after dinner which was lovely"
,,Clarke Quay,4.0,,"At least one visit to Clarke Quay is a must for any visitor to Singapore to experience the many excellent restaurants, bars and nightlife."
,,Plethora of restaurants!,5.0,,"Clarque Quay is definitely a place to visit for an evening meal. There is a wide variety of restaurants offering different types of gastronomy. You may eat outside on the quay or inside depending on your location. Though popular with visitors and locals, it is a quiet spot to grab a bite in the evening."
,,Nice Waterfront,4.0,,"We took a long walk to reach this place and it was not disappointing. The water front is very quite and relaxing place. Its a good hangout place, lots of food and drinks option here."
,,Fun place to be at night!,5.0,,Nice place to meet friends for dinner or supper. and enjoying time after that with clubs and pubs around.
,,happening place,3.0,,Lots of places to eat but honestly we found it tough to pick a spot.. ofcourse it was raining and that made things pretty unpleasant... Finally had tacos! Went to Jumbos acroos the road but there was a hour long wait... overall it wasn't a mind blowing experience but i suppose it is a stop for all first time travelers
,,place to be in,5.0,,"simply wow experience, seems whole of the singapore gets together on friday eve, boat ride, the rides, the atmoshpere is simply superb"
,,Lively nighspot,4.0,,"This was my second visit to Clarke Quay. It has changed.

The first time it was very restaurant orientated now it's throbbing nightlife with the food playing second fiddle. Every restaurant offers special drink offers or happy hours.

So if you are after a wide food choice with the food the main focus, it's probably best to go elsewhere but if you want lively clubs and party time it's spot on with lots of choice.

For such a lively venue it is also very safe and has a distinct lack of loud ill mannered drunken people.

Take advantage of the drink offers and the prices are not too bad for Singapore.

There is plenty of choice and variety."
,,Heaps to see and do,4.0,,"Amazing colours on old buildings, many eateries (although more expensive) and walkways make it accessible to other places. Right near the MRT, so easy to get to."
,,Bustling centre,5.0,,"A hive of activity, there's always something going on here. Lots of restaurants and shops to choose from. Makes a nice walk to just follow the river."
,,One stop shop if you are eager to splurge,3.0,,"This is where you get rid of your extra S$:s! Clarke quay is an entertainment center for party people offering all kinds of pubs, restaurants and night clubs side by side. The only problem for us was that the prices are sky high, even for Singapore standards. But if you are in a total party mode, take your credit card here for a good time daily from around six till wee hours."
,,Awesome atmosphere!,5.0,,"One of my favorite spots in Singapore! Either walking by the river from Clarque Quay till Boat Quay and Marina Bay at daytime, or sitting by the river with a drink at night, I find it a very special place to just wander or leave the time pass! Sometimes crowded but somehow relaxing at the same time."
,,Crowded.,3.0,,"An enormous attraction with plenty of restaurants and bars for night owls to enjoy. If you prefer observing life, then I guess you can wander for a bit and watch boats pass by on the glowing surface of the river in the evening."
,,Nightlife and a lot of restaurants to choose from,4.0,,We ate here twice at night because we like the ambiance and good people watching. Had a very nice meal at Harry's.
,,Lively,3.0,,This place comes to life at night. Very busy and expensive. But a great night out loads to see day & night. Drinks expensive in certain places.
,,FULL OF LIFE - ESP AT NIGHT!!!!!,5.0,,"A great place to visit in Singapore.

We looked around all the nearby shops. We ate at a number of the eateries along the river, including 'Hooters' and 'Chilis'. We took a river cruise from Clarke Quay back to Marina Bay.

Considering how busy Clarke Quay gets, it is a very clean area. On one occasion, we witnessed a man water blasting the walkway over one of the bridges.

At night, Clarke Quay really comes to life, with people everywhere.

It's very relaxing, sitting at a nice waterfront table and eating a good meal, while watching all the cruise boats float by with their colorful lights."
,,Where’s the Singapore Smile?,2.0,,"We have been traveling to Asia every year for the past 10 years and are always open to visiting new countries. Had someone given us some indication like what we are about to write up about Singapore, we would have gone else where.
No disrepect to the Singaporeans but our 3-night-trip was extremely disappointing…

We had visited Singapore in all its glory in the 90’s- great food, great shopping, the warm hospitality etc… Everything done with a smile ☺
We arrived in Singapore on 4th April. We understand that the nation was in mourning over the loss of their first leader, Lee Kwan Yew. However, it didn’t seem to make a difference to where we went…

We stayed in a budget hotel- Holiday Inn Express on Clarke Quay. At AUD$200/ night, the room was tiny (reminded us of a Tunes Hotel in KL). So there’s no bell boy to meet us at the front (reminding ourselves that it is a budget hotel). Did we get a decent “welcome greeting”- not really. Pay the amount owing from booking.com (which ended up being AUD$60 more- what’s with that??), given our keys and told us where the elevator was (again, reminding ourselves that this was a Singaporean budget hotel).. We were told that this hotel is central to most of the attractions but don’t forget Singapore is such a small island. It doesn’t take very long to get from one end to the other… Breakfast was quite poor… Were there any smiles from the staff or a friendly good morning? –none to be seen…

Singapore is not cheap and is no way a Shopper’s Haven as many have noted in their reviews… So with open minds, we tried to make the most of our trip and follow what’s supposed to be the main attractions on the island. We did the following. You can read our reviews for each attraction/ place in relevant TripAdvisor spots:
• River Explorer
• Flower Dome +Cloud Forest
• Sky on 57
• Clarke Quay
• Laut Pa sat
• Universal Studio
• HRC
• Orchard Road Shopping
• Little India
• China Town

I’m sure there are so many other things to see and do but seriously. With the dollar to dollar rate being the same, we ended up spending over $1000 over 3 nights (not including the hotel or buying any souvenirs). That’s just crazy!

So what’s Singapore become? It’s an economical growing island and one of the most wealthiest countries in the world. OK- Go Singapore go! BUT if we keep hearing everything costs the Singpaoreans $40 million or $250million to build this or that… who’s paying for that? The locals and/ or the visitors?

So in our observation (and please note it is our observation) we concluded that everything really costs in Singapore. They are wanting to be looked at like any other Western nation- we’re fine with that and will know next time it’s cheaper to go to the Gold Coast and visit all the Theme Parks and stay at the Hilton for half the price (I did my maths).

To describe the physical land of Singapore, amuses us. It’s like a theme- park island. It’s artificial, contrived, almost to the point of being “bad taste” design. There are no real natural landmarks and that’s pretty disturbing. Had I known I was visiting a “man made” island, I would have gone to a place like Dubai.

As far as being tri-cultural… The majority of the citizens are Chinese. All the Indians seem to be clustered into areas in and around Little India and the Malays were hardly to be seen…

BUT the biggest disappointment to see is the absence of a pure and genuine hospitable nation. We were totally in shock by the many rude encounters by the locals and perhaps this is due to the influx of foreign workers posing as locals who shouldn’t be in the hospitality industry at all. Most taxi drivers couldn’t speak English and were very dismissive (more then 15 trips- I counted).
The moment you give them a tip, it’s a whole new positive scenario…

Like wise with restaurants in Malls. We averaged about AUD$130/ dinner and in 2 restaurants they got our orders wrong. (???) Thankfully, in China Town (Smith Street) they cater for foreigners and were much friendlier and cheaper. But AUD$10 corkage charge is a bit much, don’t you think?

Have a look at our other reviews. It wasn’t all a loss. But if you are on a shoe string budget and you happen to land in Singapore… hop on a coach to Kuala Lumpur. You’ll find everything and more and most importantly suit any kind of budget. Cheap as!

On a last redeeming note, I got my first Singapore smile from a Malay lady at the Airport. She greeted me with the warmest smile and told me, “Have a nice day”. Yes it was at McDonalds."
,,Visit Clarke Quay at night time. You won't regret it!,5.0,,"We make Clark Quay the last place to visit since it's also near the Chinatown and it's night time. The lights are soo amazing with so many people at all corners. A very nice place to stay too for families, friends, and couples."
,,A perfect place for week end!!,5.0,,"I have been to this place and I must say one of the best places in Singapore.
If u wanna c wht multi cultured multi lingual place look like then this is the perfect spot.
Not only that you can enjoy number of cuisines from all over the world. If u are a party goer you can also party there as this place also has pubs and discs.
Best time to visit is weekend which starts late Friday night.
Perfect spot for couples who like to stroll by the river..."
,,Allow time to see it all.,5.0,,"This amazing place takes several hours to stroll through and absorb the large variety of eating outlets. Wonderful renovation of riverside buildings, retaining much of the original character, with modern fittings and gourmet food."
,,A Good evening or night walk,4.0,,"I went there in the evening and half the shops were just opening,so basically half ofthem were empty. go there a bit late,perfect ambience for an evening pub time."
,,Nice way to spend a few hours,4.0,,We spent an evening here. Lots of options for bars and food. Very pleasant walking around and listening to live music. Good lively atmosphere.
,,Fun for a walk,4.0,,"This looks a bit artificial but it's fun to walk through the area. It's also free. The area is also central to several other places on the agendas of most tourists. Look at a map and see how it all fits together. As for paying for food and other things, the other reviews should give you clues. Let's just say that there are cheaper places to eat in Singapore that are just as much fun."
,,A wonderful walk!,4.0,,"If you want to see a very unique place, Clarke Quay is the place to go in Singapore! The nerdy City Planner in me loved the adaptive re-use of this area to make it a hip shopping/food district. It is colourful, and it's a place that catches your eye! It was fairly quiet during the day time, although I'm sure it was more busy in the evenings with bars and restaurants opening. For sightseeing purposes, definitely worth the visit!"
,,A good night out.,4.0,,"A great place to visit at night, located along the river. There a many restaurants and night clubs to be had. You will be spoilt for choice. Nice boat rides from here along the river. Bands play and theres always some entertainment available. Theres water founatins which is great for the kids to play in and cool off. They have sling balls to ride if you dare, but fun just to watch. A great night/afternoon out."
,,A good way to the end the day!,5.0,,"After having a long day - went to Clarke Quay and had no expectations, only to find a lovely well lit place with lots of choices for F& B, something for everyone. With a walk way and rides as well. Great to unwind and relax after a long day!"
,,Totally overpriced,2.0,,"This is the Darling Harbour of Singapore and like it it is totally overpriced .
Multiply what you would expect to pay elsewhere by 5 or 10 and you may get close .
We had a reasonably priced jug f beer at one which said it was only $9 but it turned out to be $12 with GST and taxes and surcharges added (false advertising ) and turned unfriendly when we decided not to eat there .
Worth a stroll along but eat just a street away or go to nearby Little China .
Not recommended for eating at ."
,,Good range of restaurants,4.0,,"Good range of restaurants and bars, but a little touristy for my liking. They have some good lunch promotions at Clarke Quay. HOWEVER, avoid the Chinese restaurants on the boats, at all costs."
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,they have many shops and restaurants. nice place to hang out since its waterfront concept. You may want to go for a river cruise too.
,,Great meal and drinks at Little Saigon,4.0,,"Our family of 4 had a lovely end to the day at Little Saigon.

2 beers, 3 mocktails, 2 soft drinks, 1 coffee, 2 calamari, 1 Pho soup and a serve of spring rolls for SGD 160.

Sat overlooking the river and enjoyed very attentive service.

Would happily return next time we're in the area."
,,Great for unwinding,4.0,,Good for destressing after work. Ambiance is for young generation who likes to hang out with friends and coworkers. With good view!
,,Comes Alive at Night,4.0,,"A great vibrant area to wander around at night - lots of bars and places to eat, very atmospheric at Christmas too."
,,Singapore history and a food Mecca all in one,5.0,,"Whether you like history or food and drink, this is a must visit in Singapore either during the day or at night, or better still, both.
The colourful shop front houses along the water attest to the way the area developed and provide a great backdrop to the multitude of restaurants along the river. You would never go hungry in the area with a plethora of cuisines to choose from.
Just looking at the live seafood in the tanks as you stroll along reinforces just how cosmopolitan Singapore is."
,,lively vibrant place to chill out,5.0,,lovely restaurants... try the singapore sling in the bars .. I loved the nights. dont miss a night out at clarke quay
,,great place,4.0,,"Number of restaurants across the river. Enjoy food, beer, music and good weather. Worth visiting while you are in Singapore."
,,Clubs and pubs,4.0,,"You have to visit this place if you want to unwind with your friends. The place is popular on Wednesday fri sat ! Other than that , it's the usual bar and restaurant. There are many clubs and bars of different genre of music around."
,,Fun,5.0,,"There are numerous restaurants bars along the river. Many have decent happy hour options for drinks. There is a very good mix of tourist and locals.

We got there at 9:30 on a Saturday night and it was busy, but fun busy. This is a great place for evening bar hopping as many bars and restaurant’s have live bands, and they were quite good when we were there.

Do stop for ice cream (even if you don’t have kids), or at least to watch the “Mado Turkish Ice Cream” man, he’s great.

Keep in mind that the metro stops running at midnight and if your hotel isn’t near by you will need to find alternative transportation."
,,Perfect to unwind,5.0,,"After a hectic day at one of the many parks or shopping malls in Singapore, Clarke Quay is the perfect place to unwind. There is a happy buzz about the place, and lots of cuisines to choose from at the many water-side eating places. We were a little apprehensive about taking our toddler with us there at night, assuming that this was more of a couple's hangout, but we had no choice but to take him along. Thankfully, the dancing fountains in the centre of the square at Clarke Quay kept him happy, and we really had a good time. You can easily spend a couple of hours or more just relaxing there. And once is just not enough at Clarke Quay. So make sure to visit the place at the beginning of your trip, so you can come back again."
,,A WOW!!! for city life in Singapore,5.0,,"Super Location, Great Variety and a lot......of restaurants and pubs in one area Also, the attaching river makes and kind of romantic and makes the whole placejust perfect........for spending the night in Singapore."
,,Perfect place to chill by the water,4.0,,"Come evening and clark quay is the place to be. Live music, happy hours, good food... Lots of cuisines to choose from..there is something for everyone.."
,,You have to have a look but very touristy,4.0,,"We walked along the quays every day of our stay as we were staying in the area and it is a nice place to sit with a cold beer and watch the world go by but you're gonna pay for the privilege,if you want a more authentic Singapore eating option go inland 1 block and you will find lots of local eateries,plastic tables on the pavement,but they are always packed with locals and bankers alike enjoying the great food and great prices. Not as posh as the quays but much more satisfying in my opinion"
,,Amazing nightlife at Clarke Quay,4.0,,Clarke quay in Singapore is an ideal place you can spend your whole evening without spending even 10$ by just having a beer can and enjoy the quay with your friends or by spending 1000$ having a grand get together with your family and friends. Though it could get crowded at the weekends midnight but you won't mind that either if you just want to mesmerise yourself just in your circle of friends and ignoring the others :)
,,Nice afternoon and evening out,4.0,,"Great place to hang out with drinks or a meal. A wonderful choice of places to eat and drink. Try the boat trip around the bay, it covers all the major points of interest, as well as a great view of the Merlion."
,,Love it!!,5.0,,I really love this place. I enjoyed walking around. There are many many pubs and restaurants and a lot of enteratainment. Very good!! Well done!!
,,Good food stalls,4.0,,"We visited Clarke Quay twice whilst on holiday in Singapore. On a week day, there seemed to be less people about, however, on Saturday, the place explodes with people. Great beer places, great restaurants and great atmosphere. A thoroughly fantastic time had on both occasions.
The only negative would be for adults with young children. The Singapore river does not have any fences and kids being kids, you would have to watch them closely."
,,Nite life,5.0,,"Great place to visit It's good at day, great at night Nice place to relax and unwind after busy tiring day Place turn lively at night with lots of restaurant, cafe and bistro by the river side"
,,The place to go,4.0,,"What more do you need? It has it all. Go daytime and the place is bereft of people. Go night time and it is very busy. Bars and restaurants are everywhere. Shopping is nearby on both sides of the river. What ever food you like, you'll find it right here.

Only downside, I thought London was expensive. This place makes London seem cheap. Expensive, very!"
,,really buzzing place.,5.0,,We loved going to Clarkes Quay both day and night time.Its really buzzing at night full of eating places.You can do a river cruise from there that is well worth doing.WE did it during the day and at night well worth doing both plenty to see.Definately a must place to go to.
,,RELAX,5.0,,"Quite a quaint place .A small water course converted in to an open environ to relax,relish and enjoy the fun along with the crowds"
,,"Bright, noisy, brash",3.0,,Very busy and popular but not my cup of tea. Too noisy and brash. Loads of bars and restaurants - in fact thats all there seems to be here - catering for the younger crowd I think. It's all new and a bit like a shopping centre with no sense of Singapore history or culture. I'm sure there are some good places here but we just wandered through - which is ok in itself - but didn't stop.
,,Night Life of Singapore,5.0,,"This is the place to visit to enjoy the night life of Singapore. Amazing place. You do not need to go inside any club , but the crowd at midnight is worth being one of them."
,,Great place to eat drink or sit around,5.0,,"Great place to get some really good food or to get something to drink or you can sit a the riverside and relax, you can do some shopping, very nice place, again a little expensive but great foods"
,,Clarke Quay is a must visit place whenever you are in Singapore,4.0,,"In Singapore, I was in love with this colorful place.
This vibrant piece of the city appealed to me as an interesting array of entertainment, color, life, diversity and more.
Clarke Quay is a must visit place whenever you are in Singapore. In the evening it makes a perfect place to stroll around hand in hand with anyone you love. In the night, its absolutely colorful as the water reflects all that it receives. The pictures below speak for themselves.

,,Unique harbour in Singapore,4.0,,"I was unfortunate not able to see Clarke Quay in the evening. So I only got the chance to see it in the afternoon, when the sun is still shining brightly and no street lamps light on. But surprisingly, live music never ceases during the afternoon, and all shops are attractively taking customers to buy something on their own shops. To walk around, just shopping a little, and just to sightsee everything; only took me about 1,5 hours. But if you want to enjoy the atmosphere of being there, especially with your romantic partner; this is a great place, and worth your visit for about possibly 3 hours.
Remember that all attractions could be watched with no cost, EXCEPT if you decide to buy something on any shops."
,,Regular visitor,5.0,,"My colleagues and I were regular visitors until our destinations changed. Clarke quay is a place where there is always an enormous amount of choice for places to eat and drink,on the water front. Stroll through the lanes and browse menus before you decide. So many options to suit every palate and budget and its a 15minute walk from the Swisshotel the Stamford!"
,,Lively night atmosphere for a price,3.0,,"Clarke Quay is obviously a popular area for clubs, bars, and food. All this is fine as long as you are willing to pay for overpriced food and drinks for that lively night atmosphere. For those visiting SIngapore, the Clarke Quay does not reflect the SIngapore that I would want to remember."
,,good place,4.0,,"it is a good place to hang out, to have some drinks, the view is nice, the evening even better.
so many places to eat.
had dinner in one of the restaurant here, i forgot the name of the chinese restaurant on the second floor but it was really good"
,,Clarke Quay is the ideal place for a night out,4.0,,"There's a good number of restaurants and bars, many that have live music. Can be easily accessed by the super underground system."
,,very colorful!,5.0,,"This is a really cool area to walk around, lots of restaurants, pubs, etc, lots of colorful buildings which are interesting. We walked around here for a couple of hours and then found a restaurant on the river where we could watch fireworks as it was over Christmas holidays that we were there."
,,Go here in the evening for dinner and live music,5.0,,This is a fantastic area to spend a lively night.It has lots of bars and restaurants on the river and just behind very cool bars and music bars.OK it is expensive but this is Singapore and you will have a good time !
,,Walk besides the banks,4.0,,"A must visit for having a great variety of food, just along side the quays with fun around, Romantic"
,,You will enjoy spending an evening here,5.0,,"Wanted a place to eat, drink and relax first night in Singapore. Excellent food choices and vibrant colourful atmosphere. At night this place comes alive and I think this is good place for couples, friends hanging out, or families; don't think you can go too far wrong! Enjoyed a two for one offer for a Singapore Sling $ 19 total... This shows you don't have to pay Raffles Prices to have your Sling experience! Easy to get to using the MRT as well."
,,Worth a look but over-priced food & drink,3.0,,"This is a spectacular place and I have visited here on both of my visits. Clarke Quay is alive with the hustle and bustle of people and given that it is situated on the banks of the Singapore River provides a lot more than just cafes, bars and restaurants.

Unfortunately, the food, alcohol and just about everything is extremely overpriced. Prices start at $13.50 for a stubby (small bottle) of beer, Middies were $16 so if you are thinking of settling in, check your wallets and cards to make sure you have lots of funds. Everything here is subject to Service and GST after the price so be aware that the ++ means an extra 17% on top of your bill so don't be surprised.

We stopped and had a Pizza which cost $27 after ++. It had next to no topping and was the same size as a standard Domino Pizza. To put this in comparison you can buy this for $6 including GST at home (Perth - which is regarded to be expensive) but the cheap pizzas have more topping and tastier. I think too much emphasis is placed upon the profit margin. I realise that rent would be high and hence needing higher costs but this is outrageous. At any rate, I knew this and still bought something but thought others should be aware that it is an expensive place to dine.

On the flip side, it is a place which is worth a walk through just to get the vibe of the action and see the colourful nightlife. It is worth a visit but just think about eating and drinking elsewhere."
,,Nightlife !,5.0,,"This is the word that comes to your mind when u hear of Clarke quay. Discs, pubs, restaurants and much more to explore in this little but crowded area.

The bridge connecting Clarke and boat quay is a very nice place to sit and chat with your friends / family.

Also, if you are a group of friends then i would suggest you take some beers and sit and enjoy the chilled wind at night during winters ( Oct to Jan )

A must go place if in Singapore !"
,,Fab!!!,5.0,,We went here for our river cruise that was excellent. The quay itself is a stunning little area. Very quiet in the mornings bust busy in the afternoon and evening. There are plenty of shops and restaurants around and we could have sat all day watching the boats come and go. Also a great place for people watching!! Worth a visit if in Singapore.
,,an experience!,5.0,,"I love Clarke Quay, no matter what night of the week, there is always something happening there. The bars and restaurants are quirky and draw you in quickly and when the river lights up, it is a truly gorgeous sight! It can be a bit too intense and some older family members have said it was slightly seedy, but I still think everyone should see it. It is such a good night out with a range of bars with cheap drinks! As an Aussie, there are a few Australian bars that you can spot from a mile away! When leaving later at night, book a cab as it can be hard to get one, as it is the central clubbing district. I went there with my parents and partner and each time had a ball, there was something for my parents for dinner and choices for my partner and I afterwards! It is a bit out of the way, so either catch the MRT or a cab home. Definitely a fun night out, whatever time you go at =)"
,,Lots of bars mediocre restaurants,3.0,,A lot of bars offering 2 for 1 drinks prior to about 9pm. Good for meeting friends however we went there for food and although the location on the river was nice the restaurants weren't all that great. If you want to see the boats on the river or take in a bar scene go visit. It was also a bit of hassle getting a cab out of there late at night.
,,Great,4.0,,We stayed at the Park Hotel so spent most evening around the bars and restaurants of Clarke Quay.Here you will have lots of choices of restaurants and bars so well worth a visit.
,,A good night out,5.0,,"It is what it is , a well organized cluster or bars restaurants and night clubs , at the side of a canal , and while I would recommend this as a restaurant destination I would recommend it as s good night out for a couple , friends and business colleagues ."
,,A little tacky...,3.0,,Lots of bars and restaurants located by the water. More fore teenagers and late nights rather than a more sophisticated locale. Easy to get to by Metro or water taxi.
,,Cool Place,3.0,,"OK, Clark Quay is cool, but it is definitely set up for the younger crowd. It is expensive, and rap music was playing at the outdoor restaurant we visited. The food was great, but the place itself was a little too much for us and a bit overpriced."
,,Quay nightlife.,5.0,,"Throughout the day the area is quiet with maybe a few places open for lunch and drinks.Nightime,from around 7pm it goes nutso.Loads of bars,eateries,shopping etc The place is packed.Eating,drinking,chatting,laughing,music,All the neon lights that surround the place.Bumboats,The Flyer,bridges give the river a great atmosphere .Touts are all over to get you into there joints.The sounds and smells are amazing.Remember,Singapore is expensive and everything is ++.There are some combo meal/drinks deals around but read the small print.Taxis and MRT close by.Ive been here many times and have never felt unsafe or have witnessed any drug dealing.Not a place for the kiddies though."
,,Bars. Restaurants. Clean views. Nice people.,5.0,,The title describes best of this attraction. Never get tired of the sight of skyscrapers. The choice of places to eat is never ending - any cuisines! Shopping is good too. The bars! The bars! Where else in Singapore but here....
,,Perfect Evening,5.0,,"We almost didn't go because a local said it was ""touristy""...but we ARE tourists and we enjoyed it immensely.

The Quay is all lit up at night and there are plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from: Spanish tapas, Mexican fare, seafood, you name it. I highly recommend having dinner and then hopping on one of the bumboat tours. We took the cheapest one (more expensive are the tours that include an on-board bar or that take you past the lightshow at the Sands) and we loved it. All of the buildings and bridges along the river are lit up, the commentary was interesting, and Singapore's warm evening breeze was intoxicating. It took about 45 minutes. Overall, a very romantic evening and a perfect end to our stay in Singapore.

Tip: Don't go during the day. This is a really a place to experience in the evening."
,,Lively with vast choice of restaurants,4.0,,"Having only 4 nights in Singapore we highly recommend Clarke Quay for a massive choice of restaurants and bars. Great lovely atmosphere, well worth the visit"
,,Not Bad,3.0,,"Clarke Quay has one or two interesting bars and restaurants, it's great if you're with a crowd and intent on boozing the night away. Not particularly interesting or romantic for a couple, just a collection of mainly dull restaurants and bars and unavoidable television screens showing the latest football matches. The Rosso Vino restaurant is pleasant and stands out and Wine Connection too. A somewhat sanitised version of an area in the old Singapore."
,,Nightlife,4.0,,Didnt really go here to shop but to hang out for the night. The place is so lively with different restaurants bustling with sounds and bands. A mini-amusement park with rides in one area and you can take the river tour too. Shops are also available. Very crowded at night.
,,Interesting place,4.0,,"This area has developed over the past few years into a lively and interesting place to come to for a good meal and entertainment. Things have changed here a lot in the past 40 years when i first came to Singapore and its good that some things have improved , then again sad so much of the old Singapore that we loved has been demolished . here you can still see a little of how it once was."
,,Superb,5.0,,"Weekends are just amazing. The atmosphere was exceptional. I went just to see this famous place and kept on coming everyday for the whole period of my stay. The pubs , discs and the restaurants were all awesome. The crowd is superb and electrifying. The cool breeze near the bridge or near the river is just a major positive."
,,Livily part of town at night,5.0,,Plenty of bars and restaurants located at Clarke Quay. Also with a roof over this area you do not get wet when it rains. Good atmosphere here.
,,Entertaining,4.0,,"Great riverside hangout spot. Lots of bars, restaurants and outdoor activities. If your in Singapore you need to visit this spot at least once, I went a night and the atmosphere was good."
,,Over-rated but See-able,2.0,,"Okay, we're in our fifties and from New Zealand, but of all the places we saw and visited in Singapore, the left bank side of Clarke Quay was the most disappointing.
Food and drink prices seemed higher than elsewhere we visited in Singapore.
All headline prices on the menu will be plus 10% service fee and then tax!!! This was not necessarily obvious. Other locations, everything is included in the price or 'no service fee'.
Drinks are expensive - even at half-price 'Happy Hour' - compared to other places we visited in Singapore.
The behaviour of the ex-pat groups of men walking the Quay, even at this dusk hour, was not encouraging.
If you're a visitor, younger and into night-life then this is one of the places to go.
Determined to eat looking out on the Quay, we tried the quieter other side (right bank) for suitable restaurants. This was better - more transparent menus, better food and drink prices... and quieter. Lovely!
Train stations are never far away, and we headed back to our hotel satisfied."
,,If you like people watching...,4.0,,"Clarke Quay has a huge range of restaurants and bars and is very touristy which I usually try and keep away from. However the atmosphere here is great, and you can find anything you are after here. If you are on your own on business, its a good place to go and mingle in the hustle and bustle."
,,Nice chill out spot,4.0,,"After a long day at USS, we managed to squeeze some time for Clarke Quay. We didn't party or club at the pubs/bars/club. We bought our drinks and some finger foods from the supermarket and chill along the river with free music from across where the bars/pubs at. You could see many teens and friends chilling out late night along the river. We were there around 940pm and decided to take the last train back to the hotel.
Just across us, alight to the bars/clubs there were two skyscrapers rides for those who's feeling real adventurous. Nice evening at Clarke quay."
,,Clubbing and Nightlife,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is a historical riverside quay in Singapore, located within the Singapore River Planning Area. The quay is situated upstream from the mouth of the Singapore River and Boat Quay.
Clarke Quay was named after Sir Andrew Clarke, Singapore's second Governor and Governor of the Straits Settlements from 1873 to 1875, who played a key role in positioning Singapore as the main port for the Malay states of Perak, Selangor and Sungei Ujong.
It is best to visit the place at night as you will be able to wine, dine and have a good time amidst the brightly lighted up place. There is so much to see and so many places to go to. There are trendy bars, clubs and restaurants. If you like Japanese food, you should visit Kuro where you can also order cocktails and enjoy the live band. However, if you like fast food, you should go to Hot Dogs and Senor Tacos, and have a beer to go with the food. For those who like Indian food, Pint and Curries is the place to go. If you have a lot of energy, go dancing at f. club, adding glitz and glamour to your night life . If you like to have a drink in a luxurious and exclusive setting, visit the trendy bars like Highlander and Pump Room. Or if we do not wish to do anything in particular, try people watching . Believe me, you will have a good time.
River cruises and river taxies on the Singapore River can also be accessed from Clarke Quay."
,,More upmarket than Boat Quay,4.0,,"The Clarke Quay area is renovated in steps in the past years and present a charming face to the tourist. Streets are covered with sunshade. Many upmarket restaurants, pubs and night clubs are located along Clarke Quay and the streets in the area. Across the Singapore River rises the massive building of Clarke Quay Central shopping Mall with access to the Underground train station."
,,Great place for drinks or meal out,4.0,,We went for drinks here one evening and it is a lovely setting on the harbour front. Plenty of places to choose from and looks lovely lit up at night.
,,Touristy but still attractive,5.0,,"The original ""Singapore"" boasting the few remaining ""shop houses"" for which This great city was famous for in years gone by. Sadly the hawkers & their food stalls have been replaced by lines of fairly pricey restaurants & cafes......but it's still an attractive, clean & safe place to visit to join a boat trip or just to soak up what the old Singapore was really like."
,,very nice pub,5.0,,very well maintained nice people good regulation over drinking not allowed nice music nice ambiance. on till late at night
,,A fun hip place to hang out and find food,4.0,,Lots of drinking and dining choices here. Most with a great setting and many with a river view. It's a cool place to visit and spend some time! Good photo ops.
,,Restaurants uninspiring,3.0,,"It was our first night in Singapore but Saturday night at Clarke Quay was a disappointment. Little did we know, at that time, that Chinatown was not too far away with an amazing array of food choices. Too garish and loud for us. Plenty of bars and buzz for those looking for such."
,,"Excellent facilities, great food places, great pubs and great views.",5.0,,"This place rocks! Not only is it an awesome shopping centre with brands I've never even heard of, but it has loads of restaurants to choose from, including a hawker style market to enjoy food as well. Clean, quiet, and you can spend as little or as much time as you like. There is an MRT station within the facility, and it also serves the port as well, so you can buy souvenirs too. Make this part of your trip to Singapore."
,,Really like it.,5.0,,"We are staying here for 3 nights & really like it. It is s really nice place to walk around. Loys of restaurants, bars & great views everywhere."
,,"Global singapore, after sundown",5.0,,"If you like people, music, dancing, food then head here after 8 pm, anyday.
Don in your evening stuff, carry your plastics, and be ready to have a good time, as most of the folks at Clark Quay are here for. It's very very cosmopolitan, with locals, expats and tourists mingling.
With many joints of various tastes of food, music, setting etc it's a great place to go hopping. If I am in Singapore and unoccupied, I am here from 8 pm (till sometimes 4 am)."
,,Night revelry,5.0,,"This is a must for all tourists who enjoy busy and viby night life. You are spoilt for choice, and my advice would be to soak up the atmosphere by pub and restaurant crawling. the restaurants will generally allow you to have drinks only. We chose many restaurants that overlooked the river and enjoyed our drinks, the evening breeze and the atmosphere"
,,A great place to hang out at night,4.0,,"If someone told you that Clarke Quay is opened throughout the night, please know that it does not apply to all restaurants. We went there on the last night of our trip to Singapore. We had heard a lot about it from everyone. The area is lively reverberating with music and happy noises of people making merry. It is a hub of eateries with outside seating. We reached Clarke Quay at 10pm and by that time two restaurants facing the road started winding up.

There is a Pind Balluchi up there onto which every India would resort. It was also closing by that time. I believe weekends and weekdays are all alike here - totally lively and active until morning.

There is diverse choice ranging from Moroccan to Mexican, Cuban and Italian. You will feel safe and you will also find a drop back at anytime."
,,Great Way To Enjoy The Singapore Night,3.0,,This place comes alive after dark. The expats are in full swing and the energy is great. Bars and restaurants are of a good value considering you are in tourist town. Great place to walk and observe.
,,Saturday Night!,5.0,,"Go on a saturday, and you will fell how people enjoy their lives, amazing restaurants, live music, food, lovely nightlife upto 4 am!"
,,The city alive in the night,4.0,,"The perfect location to show your visiting friends to the night life of Singapore for the very first time. Showcases the Singapore River view as you walk down Clarke Quay, past bars after restaurants after pubs and clubs. This part of town stay alive till the wee hours of the morning, even in the middle of the week. You haven't seen Singapore nightlife if you haven't been here."
,,The night is always young at Clarke Quay,4.0,,"The best place to visit this place is after 8pm at night. The restaurants along the river banks have food all night. A lot of clubbing areas as well. The boats are very quite so not much noise, probably they are electric boats. A boat ride is highly recommended (approx 30 mins) along the river at night.
Beautiful place to be. The food and services are little costly, but the atmosphere is amazing. Don't forget to be well dressed when you visit here."
,,one of the most beautiful place to b at when in singapore,5.0,,get a jug of draught and enjoy the riverside cool breeze. have any kind of cuisine you want. very beautiful place in evenings till late night. right adjacent to clarke quay mrt.
,,Best at night,5.0,,This is a great place for a meal or just to wander along the Singapore River and see the city lit up. Easy to get to on he the MTR and you can while away a couple of hours quite easily.
,,Great for evening drinks,5.0,,"Clarke Quay comes alive at sunset, the brightfully coloured buildings of local bars and restaurants open and there is a huge selection of places to choose from. Many clubs as well. It gets a bit crowded, so I would recommend not getting totally wasted and keeping your wits about, but otherwise enjoy and have fun. This is a place to try the famous Singapore Sling!"
,,"Comes alive in the evening, riverside with many nice dining options",4.0,,"Enjoy the evening breeze, a river cruise or relax with a drink in one of the pubs...whichever way you want to spend it, Clarke Quay would offer you a nice evening. From pizza to kebabs, tacos to sushi, it offers very good dining options (lot of them having nice riverside seating options). Place is full of life with many people coming to spend their evening or have dinner. we only went around 10 pm for a dinner therefore not commenting on other parts of the day...."
,,Night comes alive,4.0,,"Our first time here and we came around 6.30pm and WOW! The place comes alive. It was crowded. Mind you, we were here for the 2015 countdown. Lots n lots of night life activities around..Pubs, Bars, Cafes, Restaurants. There's even the River Cruise n we had to Q very long for our turn. Packed with young people n families, too. Very happening place. Well, it surely is a nice place to chill out."
,,New Years Eve,5.0,,"Amazing, people and restaurants everywhere. What an experience it was. Trouble getting a taxi after midnight though. Some told us they took until 6.00am the next morning trying to get a taxi back to their accommodation after Countdown!"
,,Touristy place for Amusment,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is best for spending an evening with friends; there is one bar after the other; many people walking around, it’s nice scenery near the river. Music playing in nearly every pub. You can choose which you like most and you will find one. Only drawback is the very high price you are charged."
,,Loved this area for an evening out,5.0,,"Hip, fun, lots of music, great spot for a romantic date or for hanging out with friends. Many restaurant options, lots of bars. Definitely a special area for a night out."
,,Peaceful evening!,5.0,,"The atmosphere is great, yet very peaceful. The view is stunningly beautiful and close to shopping malls!"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Great spot to visit. Shopping Centre, restaurants and bars. Water taxis to get there and a short walk from the MRT station. Second time here and loved it during the day as much as at night. Definitely more ambiance at night!"
,,A great spot for a drink or a bite to eat,4.0,,We came here on our last night in Singapore and really enjoyed our time here. The area is filled with lots of bars and restaurants as well as live entertainment. There are plenty of little market stalls around as well which are great to browse through. I thoroughly recommend an evening spent in Clarke Quay during your time in Singapore; whether it be for a quick drink or a more leisurely meal where you can sit back and people watch.
,,astonishing lights!,5.0,,"i went to Clarke Quay all by alone at night. all the lights are so stunning. I enjoy Clarke Quay by sitting on the bridge gazing at the nights and boats passed by. You also can find many activities inside the plaza, i saw a (maybe turkey?) dancer dancing in the front of one restaurant. There's also a slingshot rides if you want to take on the edge of this place. But i didn't had a chance to eat even in one of the restaurants, because the price of the food is quite expensive (for me). But still, this place is so enjoyable even without money."
,,Beautiful place on riverside with old-world charm..,4.0,,"Was on a family trip to Singapore and visited this place during my stay. Pretty vibrant area with loads of amazing restaurants serving a variety of cuisines. Looks even more spectacular when lighted during night. Very colourful. We took a boat ride which was fun, you could see merlion and marina bay sands/fullerton hotels during boat ride. Nice place to spend some time when in Singapore. And yes you do get some awesome photo opportunities too!!"
,,Brilliant area to visit,5.0,,Whether by day time or night time this is a great area to visit. It is very central and vibrant with a great choices of restaurants and bars and shops along the length of the quays. Well worth a visit.
,,afterparty on the riverside,5.0,,"This is the best after-party spot in downtown Singapore. If you visit Singapore for one night only, just take the metro train and get off at Clark Quay - follow the signs for Clark Quay side exit and walk along the Singapore river all the way up to Boat Quay. There are many night clubs, restaurants and bars in the place, though the ones along the riverside are a bit expensive. We noticed that one could just buy beer for a convenience store and sit around on the Read bridge that connects both sides of the river. No matter which side of the river you are, you will get some awesome photo opportunities. Also at around 8pm there is a a light show on the far side on the roof of Marina Bay Sands hotel."
,,Enjoy Historical Buildings Along The Singapore River,4.0,,This was a colorful part of Singapore and very scenic along the river. It was fun to boat watch and people watch here in the late afternoon as the sun was setting. This place had giant shades built above the streets to keep the temperature downs and the party spirits up. I enjoyed this history and architecture here and will come back next time for some night life action.
,,This is where the night life starts at 10pm,5.0,,"Noisy, happy, vibrant and a great place to dine out.... every culinary choice was available at every price as well....so search for something easy and take in the sights and sounds.
Walk around the side streets or along the river... we were there for the Christmas decorations and these were tasteful and attractive...NOT tacky"
,,Great Place to watch Singapore Night life,4.0,,"Good to have a drink and watch as it all passes by. Boats travel up and down the river, restaurants are right along the edges and Bars have live music. This has to be nightlife capital for Singapore, and it was extremely busy when we went on two occasions. Food and Drinks were a bit more pricey here than other places we went to."
,,Singapore's Night Life,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is one of the famous place for night life in Singapore. There are a lot of pubs, Bars, Restaurants opening from afternoon till late night . And it's nearest Mrt is Clarke Quay. It's also very easy to hail a taxi if you are going back late night. A place not to be missed for late night drinkers!"
,,Great palce to have a drink,4.0,,"With a lot of options, its a Great place to have a drink. Its not a cheap área, so you will not find cheap drinks, but a beautiful palce to stay for a couple hours."
,,A Nightlife Place in Singapore,4.0,,"A place for you to have your nightlife here. There is a river next to the Clarke Quay which make this place a cool one at night. There are many bars and restaurants (quite expensive) here, you need to choose wisely the place you want to go, because some of them are not really friendly. The illuminating lamps in the fountain (at the centre) are wonderful. Overall, this place will meet your expectation and satisfy your nightlife needs."
,,Vibrant and noisy,3.0,,"Lively, vibrant and colourful dining area with numerous bars and restaurants, some on barges some in newly restored colonial buildings, that are full to the brim each evening. For those looking for a little more excitement then there’s the G-MAX Reverse Bungy that propels riders into the air and part way across the river. For those that are young at heart then this is probably ‘the’ place to be in the evening. However, for us it was just a little too noisy and hectic for us to enjoy it, so we dined elsewhere."
,,Touristville!!,3.0,,"If you have to go to Clarke Quay, that is fine, there is plenty to see and do. But, it is where every tourist in Singapore goes and where every tourist gets ripped off with inflated prices for everything. But, having said that, it is a place to visit, plenty of music to choose from and it never seems to close down. Take the MRT to the Clarke Quay station, a lot cheaper than taking a cab."
,,Good for nightlife,4.0,,"The best time to be at Clarke is from evening-night. During the day time you will hardly find anyone and the streets are typically dead but since the place is close to the marina bay and the ocean financial center one will find lot of crowd at night but that's the part to be seen. There are lots of options of dinning and especially drinking.
There are small small adjacent bars all around the place and depending on the crowd the staff of a particular bar will behave. If they see that there is lot of people coming in then the serive definitely becomes slow.
The place has options for Indian food too so one need not to worry. The place is close to MRT so one can walk easily and definitely a place to visit once you are in Singapore. :)"
,,Very cool place to visti by night,5.0,,Great vibes by nights. The lighting and atmosphere is really nice. A lot of possibilities to go out and have dinner or drinks. Easygoing experience.
,,All-in-one Nightlife hub,5.0,,"must visit..tons of classy restaurants at Clarke Quay..its an area buzzing with Bars, cafes,pubs and a variety of places to choose from..don't forget to try the Reverse Bunjee !..its quite a crazy experience.."
,,"Many bars and rests, good for a drink",3.0,,"It is supposed that this place is a must visit if you are in Singapore. We found it very crowded and noisy but I think that's the point. Lots of small bars and restaurants. Do not expect anything like gourmet or fancy food. Mostly beer snacks.

Bar staff (visited various) is normally rude. Didn't feel very welcomed as other parts of Asia. Probably that's the way the city is.

The place is good to walk a little bit a have a beer. Then continue with your trip."
,,Buzzing Night Life,3.0,,"Still not convinced whether I enjoy the vibe about Clarke Quay at night. Certainly the range of restaurants available is excellent and there are good crowds. It is perhaps a little too crowded for me, with a mostly western crowd who are often less than sober. As such, there is a somewhat ""stag party"" feel about the place. We visited a couple of restaurants which were good, but nothing special. The Tang Music Box was fun, but a little expensive and was annoyed that they did not sell bottled water.
It is a pretty place with the quay and quaint boats. The shopping near by is good. I have no doubt that this area will continue to be very popular, so do check it out. We did not find anything exceptional about the restaurants and I found the crowds a little off putting."
,,Clarke Quay,5.0,,A truly exceptional area on the Singapore river where some of the best restaurants and bars can be found in an exciting atmosphere. An absolute must-visit place in Singapore.
,,great nightlife,5.0,,"lots of good restaurants, bars, places to sit by the river and chill of an evening. Good variety of music to suit all ages, lovely safe atmosphere. Lights from buildings and river boats make for a very beautiful view at night"
,,Go at night,3.0,,"Okay, I didn't know - this area is practically dead during the day. Some of the restaurants were open, but I got the impression that it really comes alive after dark. Great location - waterfront. And lot's of dining and drinking options."
,,"Great for night time wanders, loads to see and do",5.0,,"Every type of food you can imagine, in quirky eateries. The lights are great, atmosphere is noisy and busy. Boat trips available and great for people watching. Lots of local young people having picnics and drinks at riverside."
,,Do not miss this fun spot!,5.0,,"We learned of this area after we were already in Singapore, and we were so happy that we went there. It was lively with many bars and restaurants right on the water. The atmosphere was so nice and at night it was lit up so pretty. Great for walking around, eating, drinking, or whatever you desire."
,,Best in the evening,4.0,,"Nice atmosphere, great choice of restaurants and bars. Easy to get to via the MRT. Very quiet in the daytime, much more lively in the evenings."
,,Take a Break...Have a Beer,4.0,,"Singapore is hot and humid, at least to a Canadian, so while wandering around this turned out to be a great place to stop and have a beer. A Cold beer. The food was pretty good too, and there were a number of bars and restaurants. But mostly bars. Grab a seat under an umbrella, by the river, and just watch the world go by.

This place is definitely on my list for my next visit to Singapore."
,,"Not bustling, no atmosphere",3.0,,"I arrived at Clarke Quay after 1.00PM on a Friday. Very few people were in the area. Only two cafes/restaurants were open. I expected the area to be bustling but it wasn't. Perhaps the crowds come out at night. Clarke Quay is built around two narrow strips of river with restaurants and cafes on either side. There are other shops too but apart from those, the area is just a man-made attraction. Quite disappointing really. It was a humid day and there is NO PUBLIC SEATING. I would like to have sat and watched people go by but could not find a seat. The closed cafes had roped off their outdoor seating areas."
,,If in Singapore - dont miss this place !!,4.0,,"What an unexpected surprise I got when we arrived in this lovely place. Full of bars and restaurants suitable for all ages and tastes.
You can walk around all evening till the wee hours.
The river and the lighting together with all the cosmopolitan people that are there giuve the place a reat atmosphere and the good food to be found there rounds it all off for a great time to be had for all ages and tastes."
,,Very good,4.0,,It is such a happening place especially at night. It's fun to walk just around and go to different restaurants/nightclubs. Also it looks amazing at night.
,,Nice walk,3.0,,"This place is a nice walk in the evenings. There are a lots of restaurants around this place, so good place to spend an evening."
,,Always visit when in town,4.0,,Have been coming here for years and love it. Not cheep (but Singapore isn't). River has been cleaned up and a great place to have a beer and look at the crowds. Has a great vibe.
,,Great Night Life,5.0,,"We had a lovely evening here. Had great food and tried new things. Lychee martini cocktails!!! Great. Lots of eating and drinking and dancing!! Evening visit better than going in the day time, when most of the places are closed."
,,variety of pubs and restaurants,5.0,,Clarke quay has a great vibe about it. Food and drink is quite expensive in the area but a lot of the places have some good happy hour offers. There is a light show and fountains from the floor that a worth seeing in the early evening.
,,A Taste of Singapore Nightlife,4.0,,The Clarke Quay is a favorite spot for a night out in Singapore. It is a cool place to walk around and see the river. It is teeming with life at dusk until late at night. This is accessible by MRT through the Central Mall MRT Station.There are hosts of night clubs and upscale restaurants in the area. I think the only cheap item you can buy here is an ice cream sandwich sold by a Turkish man.
,,Quay side,3.0,,Been here before and loved it.This time sad to say it looks a bit scruffy and needs some TLC . Though it does look better at night when it's all lit up and plenty of people are about.
,,Food too expensive,3.0,,"nothing economical and good. All very expensive and not very good. It was very pretty to walk around, and just enjoy the atmosphere."
,,Very nice place to walk!,4.0,,"Really nice area to walk around, beautiful views of the river! There are tons of really avid hawkers with the restaurants, which was annoying, but the rest of the experience was nice."
,,Venture there in the night,4.0,,This place never sleeps. A great time to go there is in the night when it is teeming with activities. A walk through the area and you would know the most popular night spots to hit at. You get all kinds of music and all kinds of food.
,,Plenty of bars & restaurants to try,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is usually fairly high up on the list for most visitors to see when in Singapore. but it's more of an entertainment district with bars, pubs, nightclubs and restaurants than it is a shopping area. Very interesting to walk through at night, but fairly quiet during the day."
,,great place to hand around at night!,5.0,,"great night clubs , nice people, many of them are young.. every way you go you can listen to music or go into a bar.. there are few attraction in the area as well as restaurants."
,,Great night life and people watching,4.0,,A lot of restaurants and watering holes. Great variety of food. Enjoyed walking around and taking the sights in. My first visit to Singapore.
,,Clark Quay as it should be wonderful,4.0,,"Awesome place but I think frequented by Expats and Tourists more than Locals
The Happy hours are good
but On a Saturday was awesome and on a thursday looked crowded but if you actually ventured in and around most of the places were half full
Clubes like Club Libra rated and rated were half
But a place to visit again definitely
One side is hip and happening and the other side is subdued and ...
Some of the plaxes or quite a lot of them stop serving food around 10.30 or 11 and that means you hunt for food
the type of reverse bungee is good but overpriced"
,,Most happening place in singapore,5.0,,"A must visit for young travellers - the place offers all cuisines and great clubs, has adventure rides and the waterfront area is someplace you can spend hours chatting with your friends."
,,Never been bored to come back here!,5.0,,"1. A great cities view with sunset background, definitely came here around 4 PM is the best time and stayed until midnight.
2. Walking around and enjoy the restaurants and cafes architecture.
3. Take a lot of picture around.
4. Walk along is more fun rather take a Singapore River Cruise - in my opinion.
5. If you're hungry or thirsty, foods and drinks are everywhere.
6. After the sunset, the shows begin ^_^:
* Hanging around, you will find that in this one area, like you have hanging around at the bars, cafes, and restos around the world.... well almost... :D
* Best spot to capture the laser show from Marina Bay Sand
* A lot of beautiful scenic citylights view
* Choose one outlet for a great dinner, one or more cafe to zip a coffee or tea, and beers or more if you want to.

Just don't forget to bring your Camera! ^_^"
,,Lively place especially in night...,5.0,,We went in the evening and came back after mid night. Its a lively place with loads of restaurants aroound. Dont miss it give it a try especially in night.
,,"Clean, colourful and great to wander",5.0,,"Got off the hop-on-hop-off here to take the boat tour but ended up spending a hour walking around the area to see the sights. The area has been beautifully restored, both pathways and buildings, with plenty of interesting and colourful buildings to see. The only warning is that as this is a prime tourist area food and drinks are overpriced, so if you need a cool drink walk over the bridge where you will find a little 7/11."
,,ex pats and the untouchables,5.0,,"Clark Quay, is a Mecca for gawping nouveau riche Chinese wankers who think that there sweatshop dollars can make the rest of the world kowtow!
They seem to come and stare in awe at the decadent westerners who cant quite get their heads around the fact that Singapore and China actually exist and function.
I suppose in these two blatant dictatorships there must be some semblance of order.
Anyway Clark Key is a place to see."
,,Busy. Vibrant. Colourful. Fun.,4.0,,"There's always loads going on here at Clarke quay.

The kids enjoyed the noise and party atmosphere and so did I.

There is plenty to eat and drink and your definitely going to find something that you like.

There are some great sights as you walk around in both sides of the river.

We stayed at the Swiss Hotel which is also in Clarke Quay and when we come back at Christmas will do the same."
,,great hang out,4.0,,"My mom and dad enjoyed a beer or two! very lively, very expensive beer but we had great family bonding. there's a park around, so if want to get out of party you can always opt to walk away!"
,,restaurant all around,5.0,,during friday night clarke quay was so busy and the place is vibrant with a lot of people passing by and coming to this place to enjoy life eat different foods and drinks their favorite beverage. foods around like seafood are most ordered. this is the center of singapore during the nights.
,,Only for Adults,4.0,,This is a type of market in which see many professional Escorts and many pubs in this area. If you are with friends then you should visit this place. Avoid if with family. There are many discotheques and pubs in the surrounding and its a happening place to visit in night time.
,,River boat tours start from here,4.0,,"It's a selection of restaurant and bars of which some over look the Singapore River. Here you will find the pier and booking office for the river cruises.
There is both inside and outside seating areas. I would imagine this area is buzzing in the evenings.
What a better view to enjoy your drink and watch the world go by.
This is also a stop for the Hop on Bus."
,,More of a night-time venue.,3.0,,After our visit to Boat Quay we wandered over to Clarkes' to find much of closed until the evening. Most of the bars and restaurants were shut and the main business was being done at the boat piers where you can go for a harbour and river trip. We wandered around but eventually crossed the river to a bar which was open. It's an interesting place but obviously mainly in the evening.
,,"Fantastic Place .... Grab a drink , chill out or go maaaaaaad !!!!",5.0,,"Clarke's basically a chilled out collection of Bars and Restaurants at one street in Singapore .
Good Music , great food and drinks and basically to take a walk around the place .

Other than the Bars there are 2 extreme Sports machines installed right at the end of the Street where you can do Reverse Bungy or Extreme Sling Shot . Both at least a Level 4 or Level 5 extreme sport ( although pretty short )

All in all , after the whole day of shopping or city touring in Singapore ... you go there to drift and chill out ."
,,Excellent hang out joint,5.0,,"There is just this buzz about Clarke Quay. Amazing line up of restaurnats and bars with a lot of activities, this is a place that should not be missed on the trip to Singapore."
,,best street @ night,5.0,,Had two great nights dining at this street which is quite busy at night.You have so many dining options.Very good envoirement at night and a must go for coupels and people how love good food and night life.However as usual you wont find much of cheap place to eat in this street.Will definitely come again in my next trip to Singapore.
,,Great,4.0,,"Great atmosphere, nice area for live music pubs. The area has all you need but the price is abit high compared to other place in Singapore."
,,Great place at night,5.0,,"We went a couple of nights. Great atmosphere, good places to have a meal and a drink. Like everywhere in Singapore not cheap but very enjoyable. We ate one night overlooking water at Fremantle restaurant that had great view and half price fish and chips and beer. Second night we ate at steakhouse and had an excellent meal. Great place to visit if you want a bit of atmosphere."
,,Buzz Place To Be,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is certainly a place full of action, restaurants and bars with live music and is spread out over a fairly large area. We ambled around on a Sunday night so don't know if it would be any different during the working week.
There are restaurants by the score on both sides of the quay with some perched beautifully on the edge of the Singapore River providing romantic settings for couples to enjoy. You should find something to suit IF you can afford the insanely inflated prices of everything on offer. It is typical Singapore with a very cosmopolitan array of restaurants.
The upside down bungy jump has to be seen to be believed. It literally is a slingshot.
Really worth a visit"
,,Busy Nightlife spot,4.0,,"Love the different bars here, and the food was great too. I was with a korean friend and she finds Boss Korean BBQ in clarke quay passable and close to authentic.

I also walked in to a bar that plays great Salsa music and enjoyed dancing til wee hours!

Everyone should definitely visit here."
,,May be fun if you have company,3.0,,"I went to Clark Quay. Being a single guy visiting on business didn't do me any favors as it turns out Clark Quay is definitely for the groupies, couples, and families. A person on his own might get bored. Yes, there are lots of restaurants, watering holes and live band pubs but nothing that stands out. Maybe I've had better too often so it comes off tame.

It is nice to see all the lights on either side of the Canal/River or whatever you want to call it that runs on one side of Clark Quay. Not sure how expensive it really is - I walked into a place, had a few beers and didn't find it expensive as such.

If you're alone and an extrovert then perhaps it could be fun but otherwise its a place you go with a group (friends, family, colleagues). Boring if you're a lone wolf."
,,Cool area for going out,4.0,,"We liked the Clarke Quay area for its restaurants and live music pubs. The area has all you need from restaurants, pubs, hanging out areas, ATMs, cabs right in front lining up to take u wherever u need and it's all covered up very high in the air with some huge umbrellas to protect you from a potential rain. The prices (like everywhere in Singapore) are kind of high."
,,Wonderful place to visit,5.0,,My partner and I visited Clarke Quay at night to find some where to eat dinner. There were many choices available and the ambiance near the river was beautiful. We found a lovely Spanish Restaurant over looking the river with its colorful lights and boats cruising past. We walked around after dinner enjoying the sights and the wonderful weather. I would definitely return to Clarke Quay.
,,Super expensive- lots of fun.,3.0,,"Buzzing nightlife, bars and restaurants! There’s a really amazing atmosphere but it’s crazy expensive. My boyfriend and I went for a drink before going on a night time boat trip around the harbour, I had a gin and tonic, he had a pint and it was... $30 (£15). Luckily it was ‘Happy Hour’, if we’d arrived 20 minutes later the same drinks would have been $60 (£30). Crazy- we didn’t stay for anymore drinks and didn’t dare look at the menus for food! Despite the price, I’m glad we experienced it, I just have to go back with some more money next time."
,,Beautiful! Party place!,4.0,,"Here there are restaurants, shops, cafés, bars and clubs in a row! Small streets filled with happy-hours! Beautiful to sit by the river at night, you can find whatever music genre you like! There is even a vending machine that sells shoes! Ah!"
,,Party and eating,4.0,,"Clark quay is by the river.
.and the whole length of the promenade are full of bars and restaurants serving local and western cuisine.

We.went.there on.a.weekday night and its packed mostly with expatriates working in singapore.

Weekends are.usually very busy at.clark.quay with the bars and.cluba doing good business"
,,Beautiful every night,5.0,,"I've visited Clarke Quay for 3 nights in a row, it has a great number and mix of restaurants, bars, cafes, and at night full with life and beautiful ambiance, best to have dinner then enjoy the night views around the river and bridge, highly recommend to visit."
,,Lovely to look at,4.0,,"Strolled around the quay during the day time, it is very picturesque. I love all the colours of the houses. The boats cruising down the river were nice to watch. Not much happening restaurant wise tho. Close to mrt line."
,,Riverwalk,4.0,,Walked along riverfront Clark Quay at night lots of atmosphere we stopped for a drink on a boat bar 4 Pina Coladas $80.00!!! Restaurants are very expensive nice place to check out.
,,"Food, more food, bars and shopping!",5.0,,"Picture sitting overlooking a river, colourful buildings line the riverbank, lots of bars, restaurants, markets, shops and a reverse bungy!

The reverse bungy was awesome! Great view from up there, once you remember to open your eyes after being shot up into the air at a great rate of knots. The bar is definitely a good stop after that ride to have a cool ale or a cocktail to refresh yourself after tumbling 360 degrees on the bungy.

The markets are colourful and fund, have everything from drones, clothes, a palm reader, bags to shoes, jewellery and art.

We ate at the Moroccan restaurant next to the markets and the food was magnificent, I had lamb and the spices were delicate and fragrant.

Clarke Quay is a great place to spend a day, afternoon or evening. You can also catch a river cruise from there up to Marina Bay - takes about 40 minutes and a nice way to see part of the city."
,,Great atmosphere,5.0,,This place has a great vibe. Plenty of restaurants and bars. People everywhere at night. Great atmosphere.
,,Good place to wind up your day,3.0,,"If you're an Indian, then this place looks like Har ki paudi (ganges ghat) in Haridwar with swanky restaurants built around it :) It has multiple staircase to the river below.

I went there during evening just to relax sitting by the river. It has a good mix of lively atmosphere (looking at the numerous pubs/restaurants on the river side) plus serenity."
,,Night life,5.0,,"This is a great and exotic place for all the fun and enjoy. There are 100s of restaurant and bars which are at the height during the night. Most stunning views of water channel and with lights around. Recommended place for night life lover, with couple or alone."
,,Just the place to Go to at the end of the day,5.0,,"SO many food options, place is vibrant and energetic with all the tourist and locals in the evening post office hours here just to relax and wind down. the many bars and restaurants have various deals almost everynight"
,,Amazing food & drinks at an awesome price!,5.0,,"We would start off at Wings at Clarke Quay for happy hour between 5-6. All drinks half price and the cocktails were amazing. One night we went it was the barman's bday so I let him choose my drinks and he was inventing cocktails. Great atmosphere, great prices, friendly staff.
Next we would move onto Kuro Japanese Restaurant just opposite. Happy hour was 1 for 1 on beers, wine and cider and this was an amazing restaurant we kept going back to. The quality of the food was incredible, the staff were attentive and friendly and it was really reasonably priced. We kept going back night after night!!
Mulligans the Irish bar was a major disappointment. The prices seemed good to start however the food quality was average, the staff were not interested and the portion sizes were ridiculously small.
Loved the overall atmosphere of Clarke's Quay, the colourful waterfalls and local street entertainment. Very glad we got accom in this area!"
,,Vibrant & Exciting,5.0,,"We visited Clarke quay for a bite to eat on our two day stop over from Australia to the uk. We arrived about 8pm and was amazed by the variety of riverside and alley café and restaurant's. Although it was midweek the place was buzzing the choice of food was incredible and as usual the whole area was spotlessly clean. The cost of the meal and drinks were reasonable,but if you can get there before 7pm the ""happy hour"" prices make it even better"
,,:),4.0,,Loved this place.... Lovely to relax and just walk around after a long day of sightseeing and shopping.... So chilled out.... N just lovely.... A tad bit expensive but well worth visiting
,,Very Trendy!,4.0,,"This is by far the most trendiest place in all of Singapore! The area is located directly on the river and with easy access to all of the river boat tours. The place is jam packed with tourist from all over the world as there is so many different types of restaurants and bars to go to. The great thing about Clarke Quay is that there are so many theme restaurants to go to from Persian, to Japanese and all in between. The place is also buzzing on Saturday nights with a bunch of people gathering along the river and on the bridge leading to the main area.

There is also all sorts of live entertainment everywhere you look and with all different genres. The drinks are always ""Happy Hour"" according to all of the host/hostesses, but it is just a way to get you in their restaurant/bars and then its on! $12/beers, $16 wine and $20 for cocktails, the bill goes up very quickly! That being said, the food is always phenomenal and the experience, even better! A must do while in Singapore!"
,,Ecxiting but expensive!!,4.0,,"Singapore is known as the mist expensive city nowadays in terms if daily cost of living but be prepared to burn more dollars in this place. Clark Quay offers a lot of restaurants, bars and clubs. The place is quite a part district but burning $500 per night is something that's not so hard to do.."
,,Vibrant and exciting,5.0,,"We visited Clarke quay for a bite to eat on our two day stop over from Australia to the uk. We arrived about 8pm and was amazed by the variety of riverside and alley café and restaurant's. Although it was midweek the place was buzzing the choice of food was incredible and as usual the whole area was spotlessly clean. The cost of the meal and drinks were reasonable,but if you can get there before 7pm the ""happy hour"" prices make it even better"
,,One of Singapore's heartbeats.,4.0,,"Mostly restaurants and nightclubs, but a great place to visit and just chill out whether for lunch, dinner or late night partying. A very good variety of restaurants and foods .. what to choose!! At night this place hums. Beautiful lights, happy vibrant crowds, the lure of the river and the colorfully lit bumboats. Take a river cruise, come back for a drink or meal, watch the people. Just a cool place to hang out."
,,Great place to hang around late evenings.,5.0,,"A nice place to see a blend of locals and tourists hanging out here in the evenings. Lots of variety in drinks, food and music. Great place to unwind after a tiring but awesome site seeing tour around the city."

I have not had time to visit one by one , but I definitely try it another chance .

,,Vibrant,4.0,,"If you are not sure what to eat you will be spoilt for choice here. Lots of dining options. Plus you can take a boat tour from here or you can wander into Fort canning for a leisurely walk.
Clarke Quay has a nice energy about it."
,,Food galore,4.0,,"Great venue. Loved the way the area is under cover especially when the rains hit. Food from all over the world but sadly lacking is the availability of Satay, plenty of Pizza, Steak, Fish & Chips & Thai but no local food."
,,A Must Visit for Singapore At Night,4.0,,"If you want to know what nightlife is like in Singapore, you got to visit Clarke Quay. There's a whole range of restaurants to choose from western to asian cuisines. And when you're done, you can take a walk along the quay, and perhaps go for the Singapore River Cruise in one of the many few stations around (about 40mins round trip).

And when you're done seeing Singapore from the river cruise, you can join one of the many pubs and they do play some nice musics.

Definitely recommended to visit, however only call out is the main bridge have no ramp which means if you are pushing a pram / stroller you may need to carry it down the bridge on the very steep steps."
,,"Clarke Quay, A Great Evening Out",4.0,,"Clarke Quay in Singapore is a great place to spend an evening. Here you will find stores, assorted restaurants, bars featuring entertainment, or just sit and have a cocktail while watching the boats travel up and down the Singapore River. There is no shortage of action here, Dine inside, dine outside, walk along the river in the moonlight. Whatever you're looking for in an eveing out, you're sure to have a good time here."
,,Nightlife in Singapore,4.0,,"If you are planning to check out the night life in Singapore, then this place is a must to visit. The place is situated by the riverside and has open air pubs along with closed room discs. The environment is nice and thursday nights are special, as thursday nights are women nights. Taxis are available all through out the night. A Seven Eleven store is also present nearby."
,,Nice place for a hang-out,5.0,,I just went for a walk to Clarke Quay for a hangout after a busy day. I am just sorry I had to go back to my hotel early. Will definitely visit next time I am in Singapore.
,,Neat place to visit for night life,4.0,,"Walking around Clarke Quay is pretty cool - especially in the evenings. Lots of night life - food, bars, etc. and a water taxi as well."
,,Vibrant Bars and Restaurants by the Singapore River,3.0,,"Bustling with lights and music from bars and restaurants, Clarke Quay is the quintessential central for nightlife in Singapore. This labrinth of vibrant streets hosts a selection of cuisines and bars with influences of different cultures. A good place for a drink or two. Since it does cater to tourists, food is expensive and taste, not at par. But worth a visit!

Very centrally located. Cross over the bridge from Clarke Quay MRT."
,,Riverside dining and atmosphere,4.0,,A great place to dine at night bustling with all age groups and a selection of restaurants and pubs that will confuse you. Remember most restaurants start closing food around 10.30pm but go there the first night you are in Singapore
,,Vibrant night life ...,4.0,,"This location is very historic and gives you a good feel of the early days in Singapore. There are a lot of restaurants with a variety of dishes, so after dark it is awesome to be around here.
The sightseeing bus stops here on the yellow route, so take time out to visit this area.
I also took a Singapore River Cruise from this area."
,,Vibrant area,4.0,,"My friend and I spent an evening at Clarke Quay just for dining and to enjoy the atmosphere. In the first restaurant we choose we were told we were not allowed smoking so we went to another one near the river. The food was wonderful and so was the view.All the area was quite busy but not crowded, we enjoyed the lights and the people chilling out during the night.A must if you have time in Singapore."
,,To feel old Singapore,4.0,,"When I was in Singapore and visitor come to Singapore from Japan, I always bring the visitor to Clarke Quay after working for dinner.
Clarke Quay is one of famous place in Singapore, usually visitor go there a story of their travels.
Clarke Quay many years ago to be used as actual quay along the Singapore river for trading at that time, after that to be changed to tourist attraction by using previous trading building.
Please go to Clarke Quay to feel old Singapore."
,,Foodies delight,5.0,,"So many places to eat lunch or dinner, some of the best seafood ever especially the Singapore Chili Mud Crab, watch the prices though they usually price per 100 grams!"
,,"Aweful and rude. Overpriced food, bad night life",1.0,,"Went here for dinner and a bit of dancing.
Found the food to be very overpriced for what it was, $26 for a main.
The band came on, after a song was played we were asked if we wanted a drink. After saying no because we had already had dinner and a drink we were told we had to have a drink to stay.

Considering the band was out of time, the dance floor was about the size of a bathroom a coke cost $8 and they were demanding we buy a drink that we didn't want we left.

advice to others,
If you want to dance go to union square.
if you want good food go anywhere else"
,,An enchanting evening on Singapore river,5.0,,An evening i spent cruising in the bum boat on singapore river will be one of the memorable evenings of my life. It was at clarke quay that i boarded the boat and as the boat set sailing it threw sights that is inexplicable. I have shared my experiences and story in my blogpost. Do read here if you care to know http://www.shreshar.blogspot.in/2014/07/an-evening-by-singapore-river.html
,,Average but busy...,3.0,,"Have placed an overall average review, as it is just a location on the river front that has loads of restaurants and bars. Restaurant wise, just busy, and usually a waiting time of between 10-15 minutes on entering some restaurants, and a serving time of 45-minutes. This is only in some properties, but obviously the better ones. Load of bars located on the water front and further into the back of the Quay, with some clubs as well.

Worth the visit, would recommend to go around 6-pm if eating, and then leave before the taxi ranks become 100-meters in length. Those going for the night life, don't think it really gets going club wise until after midnight. Overall it is worth the visit for a stroll and soak up the atmosphere, but for this looking for a more romantic relaxed atmosphere, would go else where."
,,Holiday In Singapore,5.0,,"Got to do this at night... Amazing buzz on the streets, all sorts of cuisines. River boat night tours... Lights and atmosphere is something else! Bars and clubs are fantastic!!!!"
,,Good place to dine and drink at night,5.0,,"I had good experience here. We took the river cruise from clarke quay and they brought us to great sightseeings. After, we had dinner and got some drinks from wings. They serve one of the spiciest buffalo wings in the world. I had one piece just to try it(i so love spicy food). Shopping centers and restaurants are all over the place. Indeed a good experience."
,,Always love this place,5.0,,"I have been here on several visits to Singapore. I love the buzz of this place, the variety of restaurants and the awesome river. It is a great place to spend an evening having a meal and drink and watching people pass by. I always make sure I go to Clarke Quay for Western food or Chili Crab."
,,must visit for a weekend late night out,5.0,,"LIKE: variety of the bars and its food variety too. u cud spend 4-5 hours just going pub hopping/ food starter tastings/ or fine dine.
restaurants by the water close early... the centrally located ones are best for the action.
DISLIKE: guys only groups are charged anywhere between SG$25-SG$40pp for a beer pint & be at a place."
,,Great location!,5.0,,"We walked to Clarke Quay from our hotel & it's a pleasant walk along the river. When you get there, there is a wide range of restaurants, cafés, bars & of course shops. It's so clean, inviting & with the wide arcades, you don't feel that it's crowded at all. There's plenty of free entertainment and at night the scenery along the river is very pretty."
,,night life,5.0,,Great place to visit for night time entertainment. Something for everyone young and old. It really starts to come alive around 10pm
,,Lively With Lots of Choice,4.0,,"Lively area filled with locals and tourists. Lots of Nightclubs, Bars and restaurants to choose from here so booking is probably wise. Most restaurants and nightclubs appeared expensive, however Wednesday night is Ladies night where drinks and entry for ladies are free."
,,"Great Variety, One Feature Surprisingly Missing",4.0,,"Just spent three days staying at Clarke Quay and spent each evening here. I really enjoyed the variety of small and large bars and myriad restaurants from all over the world. You can truly get a taste of everything here, and the street party feel to the place is really great. It is family friendly too, and whilst I didn't stay past 10pm, I didn't think there was much rabble around (might have been a different story at 3am!).

The only thing about the place that surprised and disappointed me a little is that very, very few of the establishments have wifi. These days, especially in SE Asia, that seems to be pretty much mandatory, and it is certainly something I look for when I'm away on my own and feel like chilling out with a few beers in the evening, watching a bit of sport and chatting with the family online. If more places had wifi or even if the management of the place put wifi on for the whole of Clarke Quay, I think that would be a good enhancement. But overall, it's a winner of a place and a great way to spend the evening in Singapore."
,,Lovely atmosphere,5.0,,"Had a great Singapore chilli crab meal here with business colleagues, great atmosphere on the whole area, clean and many restaurants and bars to choose from. Not cheap but nothing in Singapore is too cheap these days. A lovely evening as dusk sets in."

,,Lively,4.0,,"Its a lively place with many eating and entertainment options. We tried the boat ride on the Singapore river, it was a nice way to see the iconic Singapore landmarks, and my daughter thoroughly enjoyed her Reverse Bungy, an experience not to be forgotten easily. Many of the eateries are over priced though."
,,Best Place to Know Stranger,5.0,,"I was in Singapore for a workshop that time, after it was finished I feel a bit bored and my friends kinda tired cause we were working realy hard for the workshop. So I decided just to hang around by myself to this place. It was realy crowded at the bridge. I braved myself to talk to some people then I met three french guys, we were having an interesting conversation, drinking beer together and then went to party on Attica. Was an awesome night, too bad that I didn't keep in touch with them, I was too drunk hahaaha"
,,Drinking and Partying area,4.0,,It's the biggest and most popular nightspot area with so many bars restaurants and clubs.. All open to 4 am and western style
,,great night spot,4.0,,"plenty of good resturants to choose from, most with nice views of the water and ferries. We were in a restaurant with nice view by 7pm but it got quite busy after that."

All types of restaurant. Book jambo for chili crab if you can. Otherwise, lots of live seafood offered by the restaurant on boat quay. Cuisine ranging from Chinese, Indian, Thai, Malay, western and more.

Night view and drinking the night away. Hooters is here too!"
,,THE nightlife of Singapore,5.0,,"From the tiny bars with dynamic classic rock cover bands, to neon lit bars with young locals raving to Bruno Mars, to ethnic restaurants that showcase Japanese BBQ or Persian food, you can really find anything here. The combination of beer, dancing, live music, lights and lots of people looking for a good time just culminates into a beautiful nightlife."
,,Buzzing at night,5.0,,This is the place to go if you want to have a good meal and watch the world go by. It livens up at night and all the lights make it a great place to view. If your a camera buff and want to take a good camera shot looking down on Clark quay then go into the shopping mall and I think it was the fourth floor or if not the 5th floor where you can go out to an area that used to be a bar and set your tripod and camera up and take as many pictures as you want. Not too many people know about this spot(well until now) so it is very quiet there - even if you are not a camera buff it's a great view.
,,Nice!!,4.0,,"Liked the variety - so much to do , in one place. Loads of food, music , boat ride , etc.
My husband and I had a problem deciding where to have seafood - too many places to pick from!!! Eventually picked &glad with our choice!!"
,,Awesome night life,4.0,,"Great to have so many pubs and bars on your door step, but nothing is open before 11am. Beautiful spot to watch the lights and boats going by while having dinner."
,,Best place!,5.0,,This is the best place for eating out! It is right on the river and has great entertainment too. With night movies during summer and a beautiful water feature show.
,,A must go,5.0,,"I usually don't say that about any place but if you don't go to Clarke Quay in your Singapore trip, the trip is incomplete. In the evening around 11PM, I went there and was baffled by the energy of the place, it was crowded like hell and not with tourist but local students, exchange students and young locals you could hardly find a place to sit. The whole ambience had such energy and liveliness.

The place has so many options for dinning, partying, that you get confused which one to chose. To put it in a literal way it seems to be one big party going on, with music, beautiful crowd from across the globe and amazing food options. I personally so loved the place that whenever I would go back, CQ is a must in evening."
,,Colorful scenic views,5.0,,"Behaved ambience during the day yet fun-filled merriment during the night. Experience 30-minute cruise from Clarke Quay going to Marina Bay at an affordable cost, with usually a Filipino tourist guide on board. Bars and food stalls line the area by the quay."
,,cool and hip,4.0,,"I visited Clarke Quay on a Saturday night and you can imagine why. This hip neighborhood attracts a mixed crowd of tourists (like me), young locals (like my friends) and a lot of exchange students from all over the world. So if you are looking for a young party crowd, this is probably the place where you can start your evening.

Its full of bars, restaurants and clubs. However one tip: Singaporean love food, so if you want to go and have dinner somewhere, you might want to check out where there is a queue or where a lot of people are inside. The selection here is lush and meets young and old and for every taste there is a suitable restaurant or club. Even if the prices are slightly higher than the average in Singapore I still highly recommend this neighborhood for an evening."
,,The place to be and to be seen!,4.0,,"It is as if though there is a new restaurant, bar/pub or club newly established everytime we visit Clarke Quay! The area comes alive in the evenings and the ambience is vibrant with a melting pot of different cuisine and watering holes. This time around too, CQ didn't disappoint. Chupito's - a must visit!
The ideal place to go with family and friends to enoy great food and drink over the waterfront."
,,Must Go,5.0,,"Great place in the evening,you will regret if you miss it , you can enjoy the view of buildings over the river also enjoying food and drink with music which will make you relax"
,,Restaurant Paradise!!!,5.0,,Loved this place. So much restaurant and bars to choose from. Its a nice place to hangout with your friends and family.
,,Clarke Quay for Food !!,4.0,,This location along the Singapore River is food mecca with choices galore. It is nearly deserted during the day but at night it is full steam ahead with activity. The water taxi service seems to have got its act together so transport has been improved from adjacent areas but taxis are low price anyway. Unfortunately however this river front precinct is getting very tired and it is only nightfall that covers its sad age. But food is what this area is all about and that is a sound plus.
,,Perfect place for an evening in Singapore,5.0,,"Nice place to go to in Singapore with a variety of restaurants and bars to choose from. I was disappointed when my favourite Mongolian food joint Tent disappeared, but there were many more there that made up for that loss. Whether its for an after business meet tank up with colleagues or a meal out with friends or a romantic evening out... this place is the single prescription. No visit of mine to Singapore is complete without a evening at Clarke Quay"
,,Loved the ambience,5.0,,"If you want to relax and enjoy good food after a city tour, Clarke Quay is a place to be.. Many cuisines to choose from. We checked out Café Iguana, a Mexican resto and loved their Cheese Quesadillas. The Margarita was also delish!"
,,Pulsating Singapore nightlife,5.0,,"Tourists and young Singaporeans frequent this place all day and night; also couples for a romantic dinner. Fun America's also here with its beautiful Hooters Girls counterpart in the East. To pump your adrenaline, there's G-MAX at the entrance, a reverse bungy that will turn your stomach first before mealtime. Eat and be merry!"
,,"Vibrant, particularly at Night",4.0,,Good to visit in the evening and stroll around catching the atmosphere. Lots of places to eat but not necessarily cheaply. Usually a lot going in to keep you entertained.
,,A pleasant place to visit day or night,5.0,,"This place gives me many pleasant feelings: relaxing when I see the boats passing by the river, exciting when I experience the vibrant night life, fun when I walk around and see many beautiful restaurant buildings, etc. I love the cool breezy surrounding of this lovely place, especially right after a marathon shopping spree!"
,,Definitely worth a visit,4.0,,Its a nice street with lots to see and lots to do. We tried to go to Jumbo which is here but couldn't get in because we didn't know you needed reservations. We got there before it opened and there was a lineup.
,,great eateries,4.0,,worth a look if you want a great riverside dining experience. Check out Jumbo seafood for their chilli crab!
,,Good place to meet and greet,4.0,,"Clarke quay is a good place to meet people, lots of choice of different types of restaurant or just sit and sip at a bar and watch the world go by"
,,Night Life,5.0,,"If you are after night-life at Singapore, this is the place to be heading. A strip of restaurants, cafes and bars located on the edge of the river. The famous Seafood Jumbo is also located here, and their Chili Crabs is a must try !"
,,Watch out for the ++,1.0,,"Went for a drink which was clearly marked at $9.50 but when we got it service charge and gst were added taking it to almost $12 which in my mind is far too expensive for a glass of draught Tiger beer.
Can't remember the name of the place but it was on Clarke Quay and that price was meant to be half price happy hour so be warned."
,,Clarke Quay by Night,5.0,,"Excellent entertainment! Even before arrive at the site we cross the beautiful bridge, some lovers must love this! And the crab was excellent at the Jumbo Restaurant."
,,Nightlife,5.0,,"It`s great place for people who like nightlife. Many restaurants, clubs, shops, cafe etc. Many people who want to have great fun. Specially hospital`s club - it`s amazing :)"
,,Awesome place,4.0,,"Ultimate place for nightlife in SIngapore. Lots of eating & drinking options. Typically happy hours are on till 7-8 pm, so make the most of it :)"
,,The Quay under the stars,4.0,,"Just parking yourself along this bustling narrow river on a Saturday night is a feast for the senses. Our favourite spot is right in front of The Central close to the river cruise station. The colourful cruise boats take on and discharge a host of nationalities babbling in all languages grasping their cameras tightly anticipating the sights to behold or beheld. The river is narrow enough at this point to be able to take in the sights and sounds at the other side. Invariably there would be music coming from a band playing at a free concert punctuated by the screams of the riders on the 'Slingshot', a ride that hurtles its occupants high into the night sky. Both banks are filled with people strolling and taking in the atmosphere of the lights and sounds. Great Chill-out spot!"
,,The place to be on weekends,5.0,,"Keep yourself free on weekends in singapore because this is the place to be during weekends.
You will find restaurants serving cuisines from around the world and there are also a numerous night clubs you can go to.
A drink on the bridge is a must."
,,The place to be - for night life in singapore,5.0,,"It's still nice and good for river cruise & food in the day, but in the night it gets awesome. The waterfront is such a captivating view with the kaleidoscopic colors from various eateries and neon signs. Ultimate heaven for sea food lovers, for trying various cuisines, like I explored Indonesian, for drinks, for fun, for music, for belle dancing. This place never sleeps and the whole aura gets you high without a pint of beer.
Though all can come, there isn't much of walking or anything to trouble older family members and children, but best enjoyed by young couples."
,,NiteLife Begins Here,5.0,,"Got to visit this happening place during our Singapore Visit in April 2014. Its not to be missed attraction especially if you know how brighten could be a nite. Even though we don't booze, it make you feel high. Place is full of restaurants & bars along the riverside. Heard in evening hours there are boat rides also. We reached this place arround 10:00 pm but it felt like ""Nite has just begun:"" here. We were there till 12:30 and it was quite safe & decent. There are cops around always, but they sounds so friendly. You can stay at this place till 4 in morning and can avail cabs anytime.

""I will love to wander there again and soon"""
,,A place to be at.... during late evenings or night...,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is always buzzing with life and activities. You don’t have to look for this place, it will itself makes its presence notable that you won’t miss it. The waterfront godowns play host to a colourful kaleidoscope of restaurants serving Chinese, Italian, Mediterranean and local cuisine. Lots of shopping. And clubs around.

Definitely a place for youngsters!!"
,,Amazing vibe and great party street,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is the place to be on a Friday and Saturday night! With its cool crowd mix with tourist and party goers, it has an amazing vibe and the architecture and design of the place is great for photos!

With a mixture of pubs, clubs and restaurants to choose from. Clarke Quay is usually the de facto place I would bring my overseas friends for a night of good food, good drink and party! :D

If you are looking to paint the town red and party like there's no tomorrow, this is the place to be! Would highly recommend this over boat quay, which is more of a drinking hole with some scam restaurants.

Tip: If you are planning to enter a bar or a club, do note that they do not allow shorts/berms/slippers. (only works if you are at a beach party)

Interesting to note: Clarke Quay has recently seen a few street walking transvestites (they look thai) after 11pm. So for those looking for a night of fun, be careful who you bring back home.. hahah"
,,Bustling place,4.0,,"Fresh off the plane, we explored Clarke Quay's nightlife with bleary, jet lagged eyes. Saw some good bars, restaurants and clubs and watched adventurous people take on the reverse bungee. Managed to catch a glimpse of the Marina Bay Sands light show. Quite a spectacle to cross Read Bridge and see all the students drinking (but not littering, of course!) before their nights out began. It was pre-drinking/pre-gaming on a level I'd never seen before.

Definitely seemed a lot more lively during the evening than during the day when we visited again later but a great first taste of Singapore."
,,Nice vibe!,4.0,,"Our local friends took us there during a week night and it was very quiet. Guess on weekends it would really be buzzing.

Lots of bar and restaurant choices and located on the waterfront. For those game there is a reverse bungy.

Id love to return on a weekend."
,,Happening place,5.0,,"Have been here quite awhile and this place is still awesome. Nightclubs and bars all over the place. Lots of variety of foods too.

Good place to chill out the evening away. Some bars have live music. Which ever kind of fun you seeking you can find it here."
,,More a night place,3.0,,We visited during the day and it was rather quiet except restaurants with patrons. The pewter shop here is quite interesting. Maybe bettet to visit at night.
,,Lively,4.0,,"This has a stress of a bridge where lots of expats and local bring their drinks and food and have a small party, it also has lots of hawkers type restaurants of various cuisine with good decor. Worth a visit in the night."
,,Wonderful place!,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a very lively place, lot of people around, many restaurants, good food, good drinks. Night life is superb & full of music & lights. Enjoyed night life here & had memorable time with friends."
,,Best Place to visit,5.0,,Best place to visit in night.... awesome food available. Also try night safari to see perfect view of high rise buildings.
,,A different side of Singapore,4.0,,"We had a good night at Clarke Quay, a meal followed by a few drinks. The meal we had was at Little Saigon which was very tasty and gave us excellent views out over the river.

Clarke Quay is really busy and frenetic during the evening, but we had a good time.

We agreed that this is not authentic Singapore, but it is what it is."
,,good place to hang out and have a drink,4.0,,"drink and loud music, crowded, clean as always. nice river view. very relaxing and romantic good place to hang out at night after a busy day."
,,Trevligt område,4.0,,"(Since I find Tripadvisors translation bad I will try (on my not so perfect english) translate my rewiev after the swedish version)

Väl värt ett besök på kvällen för en drink. Området är jätte fint och stämningen är mycket trevlig! En liten pärla faktiskt!

Well worth a visit in the evening for a drink. The area is really nice and the atmosphere is very good! A little gem indeed!"
,,not my favourite part of Singapore,3.0,,"Clarke Quay is on the north side of the river. It's a gaudy, crass and very busy tourist area, jam packed with people, bars and restaurants buzzing at night. A must go if that appeals to you but it really was not my favourite part of Singapore, I much preferred the Fullerton Road area for food and bars."
,,Excellent chillrax area,5.0,,I went to have dinner with friends. We took very long time to choose which one because there were many cool places and different kind of music. It's cool place to relax with friends.
,,Not a very attractive area,3.0,,"Some Singaporeans abbreviate this place to Clarky. Its a slang language called Singlish which can be really confusing. Boakey is Boat Quay.
Clarke Quay is on the north side of the river, a gaudy and crass counterpart to the far nicer Boat Quay closer to the centre. I would skip this place."
,,Eat till you drop,5.0,,"Clarke quay comes to life at night with food that caters for every taste,you will not be disappointed,after your visit, take a boat trip along the river and take in the buzz......"
,,Go Here for Food,3.0,,"i was looking for food for my dinner, turned out, i picked burger, french fries, and soda from Burger King nearby. I sit at the edge of Singapore river. I ate while looking some boats moving and listening to music out of nowhere."
,,Sleazy pick up spot,3.0,,"Went to Clarke quay as we read a lot about it before our holiday and it sounded great,I found it to be dirty, full of sleazy men eyeing up my daughters and generally a bit creepy."
,,Average to good,3.0,,"Now don't take the three star review the wrong way, let me explain;

Firstly Clarke Quay is merely the name of an area by the Singapore River. It has much going for it - there are a few nice buildings, there is the very clean though very docile Singapore River and it is a nice stroll. You can head towards Anderson Bridge and go around to the Merlion Park or you can fetch up at one of the many tempting eateries. And it's the latter that is really the main reason to come here.

But that's it. Do not go out of your way to sample Clarke Quay because you'll pass along it anyway in your travels to places such as the Asian Civilisations Museum. The only reason you'd seek it out is if you are after some hearty fare or perhaps some drinking spots."
,,Too crowded for me,3.0,,"Lots of restaurants, masses of people, very crowded. There is a good atmosphere and it is very central. Just not my favourite part of Singapore."
,,A lively place to spend an evening,4.0,,"Lots of restaurants, and a big ""swing"" ride. Quite a lot of it is under shades to keep off the worst of the sun or rain."
,,Entertaining,4.0,,"Good Food, Good Music, Good crowd...all in all an entertaining way to spend your evenings. Absolutely Lively atmosphere...and if you are game can try out the reverse Bungee"
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"Great vibe, trendy restaurants and bars, awesome variety of food to please all tastes. I would recommend late afternoon drinks followed by dinner in on of these amazing restaurants"
,,"Busy, busy, busy.",5.0,,"If you are looking for a very busy place to sine, drink or just people watch this is it. Located right on the waterfront it is chock a block with shops, restaurants and bars all doing a thriving trade."
,,Great place for a cold mug,5.0,,"During my stopover in Singapore on my flight to Dubai, I called my college “booze” buddies to take me around town for a cold mug. These guys never failed to entertain their long lost Mug Buddy, I enjoyed two different mugs of original German Lager brewed to its identity. I even forgot both their names but it was a great time for a beer. There were a lot different nationalities, each enjoying their own crowd. Different bars with their own concept are lined up along this strip adjacent to the lake. The table we took nearest to the lake complimented this bubbly froth in our hands.

Till the next stop."
,,Amazing place!,4.0,,"This was one of my favourite places in Singapore. I only visited it during the night and I was in love. The riverside is just buzzing with people, bars/pubs and restaurants. There are so many different places to visit and not enough time. I just loved all the different themed bars and all the different types of food! Just beware though its a little pricey if your on a budget to come down here and eat and drink."
,,"A tourist area of bars and restaurants, exciting and young",3.0,,"This is a night spot on the river, very busy on the weekend we were there. Lots of bars and restaurants in one busy surrounding. It looks like a place for young people to hang out and have fun. In a similar style of place, I preferred the Esplanade area when I visited Singapore last time."
,,Romantic,4.0,,"When the night is coming, this place turns in to a romantic place. We can sit near the river and see the lights everywhere. There is a lot of pub/bar to have your beer."
,,Favourite spot,5.0,,What a sensational spot. Many choices of quality food and great bars in an area steeped in history. Really is a spot to visit. Went to lunch and stayed for dinner!
,,food time!!,4.0,,Gorgeous location with delicious food..one of the best sea food served in Singapore.. Amazing place to eat and have a good evening beside the river...evening is best time to visit the place to enjoy the beauty..
,,"Shopping, food, MRT",4.0,,"Lots to see, great for people watching. Vibrant at night. Interesting shopping. Great food court in basement of shopping centre. Lots of clubs - busy on weekends. Definitely worth a visit. Go before sun-down, have dinner and enjoy the night life"
,,Beautiful eating area on the river.,4.0,,Lots of eateries here with a diverse variety. But during the day most of the eateries are closed and service very slow. I nice leisurely place to stroll and take in the sights. Lots of shopping other dude if river at Central too.
,,Way home in the night,1.0,,"Now, I have twice taken something else than a cab to get home after partying in Singapore, once a rickshaw and once a party-minibus. Both times they totally ripped me off and even threatened me to bring me to the police station if I won't pay the price they charge in the end.
Therefore, I would recommend everyone to get a normal cab and avoid any of these fancy looking vehicles."
,,The place to go!,4.0,,Clark Quay is the night destination in Singapore to grab a drink and great dinner. There are like so many places to eat....
,,great area of town,5.0,,"Had a lot of fun here. There are lots of shopping areas, bars and restaurants here. If you can't find something to eat here you were not hungry. Everything from Singapore food to Irish even a Hooters. Its easy to get to by taxi, train, or water taxi. Late at night some of the restaurants turn into clubs so if partying is what you want to do you can do it here as well. A lot of the restaurants have outdoor seating and allow smoking outside. Go here if you want a lot of options and not everything is expensive."
,,Very touristy feel,3.0,,"It's odd: Clarke Quay isn't just for tourists; there's plenty of bars and night clubs the locals attend, too. But it feels like a tourist trap, quite artificial, not authentic. If you like that sort of thing, there's plenty of food and drinks on offer, and I guess for nightlife enthusiasts it can't be missed. Not to my tastes, but I can see the interest."
,,A party area,4.0,,"One day on our visit to Singapore we walked around Clarke Quay in the morning and it was pretty well deserted. We came back in the evening and it was like a different place. Lots of bars, restaurants and entertainment. This area definitely comes to life at night."
,,Plenty of choice,5.0,,Great location for dinner/drinks. Plenty of choice & quick service. Not open for breakfast though but there is a starbucks & bakery cafe at Central which is across the bridge (or McDonalds/Starbucks next to the Novotel which is nextdoor)
,,After Dinner Excitement,4.0,,"Whereas Boat Quay, just a five minute walk down the river offers a genteel waterfront dining and drinking experience from lunch to dinner and after, Clarke Quay is generally closed all day ( I found out by experience ) and does not come to life until after dark

It offers good restaurants and very average restaurants and live music with a lively vibe. I am 51 years old and was travelling with my wife but if I was younger and/or on a trip with business colleagues it would have been Boat Quay for dinner then the stroll to Clarke Quay for after dinner entertainment."
,,Full of Life,5.0,,This is a place where you can recharge yourself after the long day of Singapore enjoyment. Live music makes the environment wonderful. A lot of restaurant are there to provide quality food river side. A refreshing place where cool wind blows every-time. Night is the best time to visit Clarke Quay.
,,"great ambience, great food, great place to hangout...",5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a riverside promenade located at the banks of Singapore River. To reach there by MRT get to the Clarke Quay MRT station and exit towards the Eu Tong Sen St. Once you come out of the station keep walking to your left on the pedestrian path. As you walk little over 100 mtrs you will notice a bridge ahead of you… the Singapore River flows below that bridge. Without going over the bridge keep walking at your left till you reach the river bank (you will notice a yellow pillar with “Central” written on it). As you reach the river bank turn left and keep walking till you see a bridge on your right. You will also notice large “Clarke Quay” sign on the right side of the river. As you reach the bridge you will see an array of restaurants on the other side of the river bank. That is where you need to go.

The area is full of restaurants and bars… There is one set of restaurants on the river bank where you can have your food while watching the river view. There are also another set of bars and restaurants at the back side. The back side area is like a cross street and covered under a lovely canopy with subdued lighting. At the centre of this canopy area there is a floor fountain. The canopy area spreads on four directions from here. While the canopy area is more lively and vibrant the riverside area offers great view. Finding a seat in a riverside restaurant can be a little tricky though. Almost all restaurants offer great food… the riverside ones are a bit expensive.

There is boat ride booth at the quay and a reverse bungee on the right side of the quay… It’s a place you will definitely enjoy."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"recommended for couple travelers.. many tourists, bars and pubs. The food here is awesome by the way"
,,Good walk in the night,4.0,,"Good view for walking in the crowd near of river. Good view, good talk, with lovely people, and stop to drink in paulaner."
,,Something for Everyone!,5.0,,"What a vibrant place day or night! Every kind of restaurant and bar you can imagine and amazing people watching. Great no matter your age! Once the sun goes down, every place lights up and the energy goes to another level. If you're young and want to have a drink where there is pumping music, there are many choices. If you want a more quiet experience, be it a restaurant or bar, you have those choices as well. It seems everyone meets up here. You'll probably find yourself going back more than once!

This is also where you get the river cruise from ... a MUST DO!"
,,"Nice views, but poor choice for a meal",2.0,,"I agree with some reviews which give good marks for nice night life, and perhaps for a few drinks.

But don't count on finding good food. My experience may not be representative of the place. I asked a few restaurants what they charged for corkage. The answer was they had standardized it at S$50. I thought this was steep! It's one thing to charge for service (and it should be commensurate with the price set) but another to gang up and charge an exorbitant amount for bringing a bottle of your favorite wine.

We ended up drinking tiger beer with our food. The bill for 8 of us came to S$460, perhaps not expensive if you consider this was a prime tourist destination. But we ordered portions only for four, and I'm sure my companions did want some more. (We resolved to buy ice cream from Hokkaido ice cream, but it was closed when we got there.)

My advice is: stop here for just a few drinks and move somewhere else if you want to enjoy a meal. You could even spend less for much better value."
,,"Fun, lively area to go at night",4.0,,"Lots of restaurants, bars and cafes down here. A good buzz and gets very crowded on the weekend evenings. Singapore River boat tours also leave from here and they are $22 per person and last for 40 minutes. Some restaurants can be really pricey, so check the menu before you go in. Easiest way to get here is taxi or MRT to Clarke Quay station."
,,Lively,4.0,,Loads of bars and restaurants here. Great to walk around in the evening. Downside is that it is expensive compared to other places - Robinson Walks nearby is much cheaper.
,,Perfect for young traveler,4.0,,"Nice spot for cheap beer and a variety of bars and restaurant. I used to visit this place several years back when I was in my twenties and single. Now that I have 4 year old son tag along, I decided to visit the Central and took pictures with Clarke Quay as the background, perfect."
,,Best Place for Pub Goers,4.0,,"Clarke Quay, Singapore’s choice dining and entertainment destination, is full of colorful buildings housing antiques, restaurants, hip cafes, jazz clubs and more. Day or night, one can enjoy variety of food, drinks, music and entertainment all conveniently located in the same vicinity separated by short walks along the river or through the beautiful covered streets of Clarke Quay. At night, the entire area is lit up with colorful lights. Enjoy Drinks with music in the evening. Nice place for pub goers. Do not forget to eat Mado Turkish Ice Cream served by a funny man. Different experience at Day & Night visit. Clarke Quay MRT Station is located within the vicinity. The Central, a shopping centre is situated above the MRT station. The G-MAX reverse bungee, the first in Singapore, is located at the entrance which opened in November 2003. River cruises and river taxis on the Singapore River can be accessed from Clarke Quay. To find out the latest updates and happenings at Clarke Quay, log on to www.clarkequay.com.sg for more."
,,Good Evening and Night,4.0,,"Ten minutes walk from Fullerton Hotel where we were staying ,so we used to go frequently.nice and busy at evening and remain open till late night.food is good but overpriced as most Singapore prices"
,,"Avoid if you are seeking a quiet, relaxed meal",1.0,,"Lots of over-priced bars and restaurants catering to tourists. A place to go to drink a lot of beer with your mates, but not a place to go for an enjoyable meal."
,,so much food!,4.0,,"Great place to visit in the late afternoon for some drinks along the waterfront. Always happy hour at every food outlet . Great variety of food places and decently priced but not real cheap. This place is focused on the tourists, average price for an average couple dining would be around 60-120 with a few drinks each , you can get the same elswhere at local eateries for around 20-40"
,,Nocturnal Concoction: Relax-Booze-Music-Party,4.0,,"This is the place for those who wants to end the day to enjoy, relax and meet some people. Lots of bars and restaurant to choose from. Foods are great. Search for reasonable food prices. Music is everywhere. Bustling with people - most are expats. Situated along the river and occupies a stretch of it. Great views. Bright lights. Must visit this place!"
,,Bars and Restaurants,5.0,,"Lots of choice for bars and restaurants in the area. Conveniently located near Chinatown as well, very walking distance."
,,Great night out,5.0,,"Clarke quay is a great night out. Lots of restaurants and bars at reasonable prices considering Singapore's prices. Fresh seafood is in abundance and fresh. The restauranteurs are all very friendly and touting for your patronage. Some will even offer you free drinks if you dine in their establishment. A lot of the restaurants are al fresco and by the river, bright colourful lanterns and lights enhance the atmosphere. Its a nice change from the norm. We enjoyed our night so much we will be going back in May 14 and wont miss out on Clark quay for a night out. The earlier the better as it can get very busy. Train station is very close by, but get a cab as it will be quicker and cheap."
,,Night Spot Popular with Expariates,4.0,,"Numerous restaurants and a busy night spot. This is the place to go to be seen. Pricey restaurants. Lovely area to stroll around in the evening, as the river front is beautiful at night."
,,Good.,4.0,,"This site has all kinds of restaurants and some shops and bars. It is a good place to dine, the view is very nice, with the river just beside the Clarke Quay area. There are nightclubs too but this place should be better and crowded from thursday to saturday (or during the high season). I went there on a tuesday, so it was very calm with few people dining and walking around."
,,Evening Out,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is the ideal place for a night out, a good number of restaurants and bars, many that have live music. We were in Singapore for 3 days before joining a cruise ship. We had 3 enjoyable meals at Clarke Quary, Can be easily accessed by the super underground system."
,,Dreadful,1.0,,"What a shame that this once amazing quay has been turned into a music blarring, light flashing tourist trap. You really could be anywhere in the world. No sense of Singapore here at all. Beer is outrageously expensive and even though there a a vast number of places to eat, not one that offers Malaysian or traditional Singaporean food.

Having visited here a few times in the past it was a real disapointment to go down to the quay, struggle to find somewhere to eat, only to pay a fortune for really dreaful food.

If you want every type of cuisine EXCEPT that of the country you are in, then this is the place for you, If you are looking for traditional Malaysian/Singaporean food - head to Maxwell Road Hawker Center."
,,awesome place...,5.0,,this place is worth going n seeing while in singapore.this is just awesome n beautiful sply at night.the whole view v cool n v enjoyed it thoroughly.u can sit there n take a long walk also.the ambiance is superb..the place is full of dining n drinking options and ya u can shop also.
,,More eating outlets!!,5.0,,"More eating outlets than you can poke a stick at!! An amazing choice of fine foods, drinks, eating styles and comfort zoes!! Either hang out on the river bank or go inside to a finer dining experience - the atmosphere and experiences on Clark Quay were fantastic!! Oh - and shopping is also an option!"
,,Nightlife in Singapore,4.0,,If you want to have fun this is the place. It is located near the river and it is an entertainment zone plenty of restaurants and some of them offer live music. If you want to have a dinner it is better to go early in order to find a seat.
,,Fantastic atmosphere,4.0,,Clark Quay is a great place to visit of an evening. The meals can be a bit pricey but you pay for the views! Wonderful place to have an enjoyable drink and to take a relaxing river cruise. This experience should not be missed when visiting Singapore.
,,"Lively Scene, Lovely View",5.0,,"Clarke Quay (pronounced “key”) came highly recommended by a friend who lived in Singapore, especially for nightlife. I was in town with my cousin and an 8 year old, so late nights were out of the question. Still lots of things to do, including hopping on a Bumboat for a one-hour river cruise or simply strolling along the riverbanks and stopping at the many sculptures and structures along the way.

In general, Singapore is an expensive place to dine (unless you go to the local Food Centers) but they do have some bars/lounges along Clarke Quay that offer 50% off drink prices during happy hour from 4pm-8pm. I had a glass of chardonnay, originally S$15 or about US$12 (almost the same price as SF bars), half price at S$7.50. Dinner was at Oktapas, with the Paella Valenciana at S$40 (US$32). It was plenty for 2 people to share.

If you have the stamina, walk along the riverbank all the way to the Merlion (about a 20-30 minute walk, depending on your pace).

It's a great place to sip cocktails, people watch, and spend an afternoon or evening. Definitely worth a visit."
,,"Lively place, especially night time",5.0,,"Great location and place full of bars, restaurants and shops. Night time this area gets really crowded. Easy to get, because MRT and water taxi stations are right there"
,,A hot spot with hot prices...,3.0,,"A very lively place in the evening with plenty of places to eat, drink and party - in fact it was probably the party hot-spot in the city. Easily accessible from the underground it's not far from anywhere if you are staying centrally. We ate in a very busy quayside restaurant and without drinks came out with a £75 bill and left still hungry! So, beware of where you eat and look at the menu and prices before you go in. Unless you want that quayside experience which we did not think was worth the money, look at other restaurants just off the main walkway - we looked and they were far more reasonable. Possibly a little too commercial a location for us and not really authentic which was the experience we were looking for - a bit like going to Docklands on a busy Saturday night."
,,Is it too late for Clarke Quay 2.0?,2.0,,"Clarke Quay has been around for quite awhile now. The Wikipedia article on Clarke Quay summarizes some of that history, though some of that article seems to be written by the PR folks for the developers - or by someone else who cannot really see what *could* be done with this historic and strategically located space, rather than what ""is typically done by folks copying the 'festival market' approach of uninspired chain restaurants and their localized clones."" As of this writing, the Wikipedia article, for example, touts Hooters as a ""notable"" feature of Clarke Quay. ***That may say more about the place than the Clarke Quay PR team may intend..***

Pros include:
A heritage area partly restored and partly rebuilt.
Relatively easy to get to.
Blends with Boat Quay to form a larger area. (Indeed, I consider the two to be one area.)
Possibly, a good use for the waterfront.

Cons include:
Unoriginal. Misguided: if Hooters is a ""notable"" feature of the place, what might that indicate?
Over hyped.
In terms of urban planning, late 20th century ""tacky""?
Prices that go with ""over-hyped"".
Did I say over-hyped?
Same-same as other places around the world.
One could imagine **much** more unique, characterful, vibrant, and/or good-value uses of this space.
Did I say ""derivative"", not very original?

It's not often that I venture from the heartlands into the city. I have never been a ""salaryman"" working in a downtown office building. If I had been, I might be more likely to visit Boat-Clarke Quay for a mug with mates before heading back home to the heartlands after a grueling day at the workplace. Or, considering the prices vs quality here, maybe not. As a value seeker, I would have to plan long and hard to maximize value from this area. And I might not be very successful, even after such thinking/planning.

If you're a visitor, is a typical neo-place with somewhat more expensive food/drinks, in such a pseudo-restoration atmosphere a good place to visit? Or is a more unique-to-Singapore hawker centre or other venue a more authentic and pleasant good value? I vote for the latter, as there's a good diversity of such more unique places - in almost every part of the city.

But YMMV, of course."
,,A Singapore hot spot,4.0,,"Lime it or not, Clarke Quay is a nightlife area and something for everyone, have had some great nights and some ordinary but NO bad nights. Music, food and entertainment, a place to enjoy the day or night with a river view. Not for everyone but a place that we always check out, not quite an icon but not far off!!!."
,,Best Party scene in Singapore,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is the place to be if you want to experience the night life in Singapore. It is situated by the river and in December the weather was beautiful. Clarke Quay has a host of fine dine restaurants and clubs. The place is pulsating with night life. Energy, glamour, and Fun.

We went to this Club called Attica which I would very much recommend. It has a entry of SGD 30 on a Saturday Night, with 2 drinks complimentary. Zouk is also another party place about 2 kms from Clarke Quay, I think. Its just that it can be so crowded that you can't even move.

Food is expensive here. So if you are on a budget, come on a full stomach and nibble on the starters and drinks."
,,Walk by the Harbour,5.0,,This is a place where you can come after all your shopping and sight seeing of the city and relax. You can take a ride in the ferry by the harbour and there are a lot of riverside restuarants over looking Marina Bay and harbour. Must visit in Singapore
,,Lovely Riverside Walk but Expensive,3.0,,"This is a very touristy area of Singapore and is mainly populated by Western travellers. If you're on a budget, dont plant to eat here as everything is very expensive. Liquor is extremely expensive so you'd actually be better off consuming some items from your hotel's minibar as far as prices go. The atmosphere is relaxing and there is a very cosmopolitan feel to the place with people from all nationalities rubbing shoulders and cuisine from many parts of the world being represented."
,,A place to experience nightlife in Singapore!,4.0,,"Singapore being a ""early-shutdown"" city, there are not much places to have a late night dinner. Clarke Quay is one of the rare surroundings where you find diners open till late at night - and as it is on the side of Singapore river, it is a nice place to see and enjoy the city lights at night! Food prices are a tad steep, but go for the experience once."
,,Expensive,3.0,,We wanted to experience the local food and culture. It was hard to local cuisine reasonably priced. In hindsight we should have gone to the hawkers markets.
,,Very Loud,4.0,,A lot of options or loud options mostly. Lots of restaurants and cafes. Very late night shops. So go there if you want to dine very late.
,,Great options!,5.0,,"The place is full of restaurant and bars and it's a wonderful option for Singapore's by night. It also has a river side which is very beautiful and romantic. For couples or friends ""Clarke Quay"" is a must to visit!"
,,The good place for enjoy the night life in Singapore,4.0,,"If you go to singapore and you are couple or with friends, here is the place for hanging out in Singapore. The Best time for going here is at night, enjoy dinner here ( a little bit expensive but worth it) and try the Slig shoot or the reverse bungee jump. If don;t want spend some dollars just walking around and take some pictures also nice."
,,Best place to Hang out,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is one of the places to visit in the evening with all the shops, entertainment, bars, clubs and restaurants you will not be bored. The Bridge is one of the best places to buy ur own booze and Hang out . both locals and tourists go to chill out. there is a bridge to cross over to the other side of the river. There are also river cruises in this area. It's definitely worth visiting however food and drinks are on the pricey side."
,,HEAPS better at night time.,5.0,,"Lovely by day, but a million times better by night.
Like a lot of things in Asia, Clarke Quay really comes to life at night time. Be prepared to wait for a table at a café, and for it to be busy and loud but it all adds to the atmosphere.
Take your camera as there's some really pretty pictures to be taken...also the waitresses at Hooters are prettier and bustier at night time!"
,,Many options. Great party/bar area- pricey&commercial,3.0,,"Many options. Great party/bar area- pricey&commercial Interesting to walk through and maybe one night.....I found it a bit too kitschy, commercial and unrelaxed. But great for a fun night outh with friends or people watching"
,,Night Life,4.0,,"Great place to spend the night!

there's plenty of bars, bands, restaurants and a little bit of cheap shopping in this lively part of town. We went to a few bars (they are all expensive for drinks) and enjoyed the various types of bands playing. We even watched the guys at the Turkish ice cream stand playing tricks on people who purchased the ice cream (it's really funny, if you find the Turkich ice cream stand, make sure you buy one!).

It's a great place to have dinner and spend your night out."
,,Comes alive in the evening,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is one of the places to visit in the evening with all the shops, entertainment, bars, clubs and restaurants you will not be bored. It appears to be the place where both locals and tourists go to chill out.

It has an MRT station close by and there is a bridge to cross over to the other side of the river. There are also river cruises in this area.

It's definitely worth visiting however food and drinks are on the pricey side."
,,What A Great Location,4.0,,"Clever use of the water with ferries taking people for rides, a fantastic variety of restaurants, use of colour and nightlife, Clarke Quay is a great way to spend an evening in Singapore. Plenty of shops adjoining the waterfront also."
,,Clarke Quay The Place to Eat in Singapore,5.0,,"The only drawback with the Clarke Quay area in Singapore as far as eating is concerned is the massive choice of venues makes us 'spoiled for choice'. Everything form Asian cuisine in all forms through European is available. The Quay is very central by taxi, train or even walking from various hotels. We chose Renn Thai, a favourite of mine, and it proved again to be a great decision yet again. We had a riverside table with good breezes even in the middle of the day and great views of the passing taxi boats and tourist boats."
,,Nice place for hangout,4.0,,"Nice place to hangout with friends, for countdown as there are plenty of bars and cafes. Very accessible with MRT. After a good dinner, can try a river cruise till Merlion or Marina Bay."
,,THE place to be at night,5.0,,"We spent two nights in Singapore and had supper at Clarke Quay both nights. This is the place to at night. There is a wide variety of restaurants catering for western and asian tastes. Food is a bit expensive there, but we just went there for drinks after having supper elsewhere. Clarke Quay is a favourite among locals and tourists. You can also catch the riverboat at Clarke Quay. There is a bridge linking the two sides of the river. Clarke Quay MRT station is right next to the Quay and there is also a mall next to it."
,,"Atmosphere, but overpriced",3.0,,"It's certainly vibrant, and worth a visit, but even the days when the Sate club vendors were there are a distant memory. Food was overpriced, and drinks required a mortgage on your house. Ok, not that bad, but $6-9 for a soft drink ? really ?

We had steak dinners which was pleasent, but hardly worth s$200 for only 3 people.

Visit for the ambiance, dine somewhere else."
,,Great place to chill out,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is definitely the place to go during evening onwards. There are lots of bars, clubs and eateries that are at both side of the Singapore River. We went on the Saturday night and the place is buzz with people, both party-goers and diners. After dinner, we bought some drinks and sat along the Singapore River and chill out, like the rest of the people there. A great place!"
,,The place soars the spirits,5.0,,"Its like a page out of a fairy tale..except all the characters have grown up now and are enjoying life. Its the kind of place which instantly raises your spirits, makes you youthful and really just feel alive. There are gyrating bodies on one end and silent musers on the other. It has a quaint lttle bridge to 'take you to the other side' :) and awesome food and drinks to sate your palette. Saturday night- please make a date with this place!"
,,Happy thoughts and a well spent night.,5.0,,"I love this place. There are so many attractions from malls, cafes, restaurants, street performers to even the bridge itself. I enjoyed the 40min river cruise just looking over the beautifully constructed buildings.

This place has a lot to offer. Make sure not to miss this place when on SG. You can choose to dine in a fancy restaurant or just sit on the bridge. The sights and the people are really interesting."
,,The place to be,4.0,,"You don't have to get drunk or anything to enjoy this place! Wether you're into live music or Hooters Clarke Quay's got it for you :)
If I were to say what to do there it would be to buy a couple of beers before sitting down by the water and look at time go by along with the boats."
,,Pluses and Minuses,3.0,,"Clark Quay by day is a great place to roam around and have a pleasant lunch at one of the many restaurants/cafes/bars. It has been refurbished since we were last in Singapore 10+ years ago. Even by day it has a pleasant atmosphere and there are not many people around. It is also a place where you can join a pleasant river cruise.
At night, it turns into a noisy and expensive nightlife arena. As soon as the natives finish work, they appear to gravitate to this area. I didn't notice too many tourists in the area after dark except some younger people who enjoy clubbing. It does however, provide some entertainment to ""people-watch"" for the price of a beer."
,,Awesome night out,5.0,,"Wow, they have done a really great job designing the river front and making it a hot spot for people to come hang out. Full of clubs and restaurants every night is buzzing with activity. Lots of hot girls walking around and many cafes you can just sit on the patio have a few drinks and people watch. Then once you are ready head to one of the many clubs only a few feet away! Makes for easy club hopping! A little expensive, but definitely worth it!!"
,,Not for me,2.0,,Went to Clarke Quay Singapore in November 2013. Busy place with lots of restaurants and bars. I was put off by the high prices and then found out that most places served shark fin soup which I found appalling considering the well documented cruel fishing methods for shark fin. I won't go back and shame on Singapore for allowing shark fin on the menu.
,,Greedy landlords,1.0,,Went to Clark quay Monday night and was ripped off totally un the price of drinks before you buy a drink guys check there prices don't let the youngsters bring them to you 85 sing for 3wines and a glass of bubbly what a rip off never again
,,Relaxing,5.0,,"If you are traveling around South-East Asia for a long time and want to ""feel"" the Europe for a short time to make a little break from completely different environment, then you should go to Singapore and visit Clarke Quay. I was there just few days before Christmas and there was a show with Christmas songs every evening in front of shopping center Central. I have enjoyed very much sitting near the river, eating expensive chocolate and listening to the Christmas songs on 28 C :)"
,,Nice place to hangout in the evening,4.0,,"This is the place where you can spend your time in the evening and you will not get bored . There are more number of restaurants and bars where you can order some food and enjoy the place with light music. When we went there , in one of the restaurant they had arranged a belly dance which was really nice to watch. And you can sit along side the river with your pair"
,,Good for partying if that's your scene,3.0,,"This area really has not a great deal to do during the day (except for the shops) most of the bars and restaurants don't open till late. this area is would be great if you are looking to party till the early hours, the crowds get big about 11pm with a lot of people drinking and eating till the wee hour. this area is expensive, like the rest of Singapore. you can get the water taxi or a sight seeing river cruise from here an is good. lots of food options at night and a couple during the day, but mainly expensive semi fine dining. there is a lot of people sitting around drinking on the bridge at night (not causing trouble) and I would recommend this area to people that are after the party scene."
,,FREE ENTRY FOR CLUBS,5.0,,"Bianca Supper club replaced Forbidden city. Luxurious interior club with posh sofas, prices are real reasonable. Contact Amberlin for FREE Guestlist and drinks only for LADIES! RSVP@ 96524333"
,,For those who like drinking and dancing,2.0,,"There's lots of Bar and Pub, for those who love to be drunk and Disco all the night. But the view of the bay front and the breeze is good. can take a beer there but if you don't like to be disturb by loud noise of the music and chitchat. just skip this place."
,,nice place for jogging,4.0,,"day and night, clarke quay must not be missed in singapore. i am not a party goers so i prefer visit this place in afternoon."
,,A Singapore highlight for the vibrant nightlife and the riverside location,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is an excellent area to visit in Singapore, especially on a Friday or Saturday evening.

It's a major nightlife area with restaurants, cafés and bars. Also, there are street side stalls adding to the atmosphere.

During the day, it's a good place to visit as well, particularly as it is located near to severL other attractions, so it is a good place to include in a day trip.

I recommend you go on one of the 40 minute cruises- a round trip from Clarke Quay- good value at SGD 20.

Highly recommended"
,,Hard to believe it's Singapore - could be Europe,5.0,,"Extremely picturesque and colourful. Good for restaurants, bars and shopping. We spent time there after taking the boat trip along the river (excellent - provides wonderful photo opportunities of the Singapore panorama inc the Merlion and Marina Bays Sands). We noticed that restaurants were expensive but would provide a good night out in lovely surroundings. Very easy to get to by tube."
,,The nightlife of Singapore,4.0,,If you would like to see the nightlife of Singapore this area is the best especially at the weekend but note that the prices are damn expansive.
,,great atmosphere for great ripp off,4.0,,"do not buy any food there before you know what do you get for your money!!!!!!!!!!!
the MENUS there are very deceptive,,,,,,,what you read on the menu covers only the basic item only then you you have to pay extra for rice or potato or veges or sauce.... if you buy an item for 30 dollars from the menu it might end up being 60 dollars after you get the side dishes ....
highly recommend SHIRAZ middle eastern restaurant especially the fast kebab sandwiches,,,they are great and well priced.... if buy alcohole or soft drinks go get them from 7 eleven for half the price..... the place is a must to visit in the night"
,,Lovely place to spend your evenings,4.0,,My family thorougly enjoyed the atmosphere with live bands and good food.This place is amazing as you see all varities of restaurants
,,Great place for dinner!,5.0,,Great restaurant options for dinner and night life. We went several times while in Singapore for business and it was great to relax and have some good food. I highly recommend it.
,,Food Food Food,5.0,,"This place rocks. Foodies will enjoy this place. The evenings are lovely here with all types of cuisine. Personally, I tried the Persian one in Clarke Quay including Hummus. Good experience and lively people. Fun.....!"
,,One Stop for Food & Drink,5.0,,"If your looking for a one stop place, with a variety for food, This is the place, It has from bars, restaurants to night clubs. There was one club, which the theme was a hospital. :-)"
,,Chill out,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is a nightime playground for adults with many bars,clubs and restaurants by the quayside"
,,For eating and entertainment this is THE place to be,5.0,,We came here after a nighttime river cruise and boy does it rock. There are hundreds of bars and restaurants lining the river banks and there is every cuisine under the sun to choose from. Don't miss out if you are in Singapore.
,,A huge range of restaurants,4.0,,A great place to wander around and soak up the multicultural atmosphere. A great range of restaurants to choose from without the hassle of people trying to talk you into eating in their restaurant. Night time offers the colours of the lights and great atmosphere. Well worth a visit.
,,great nightlife,5.0,,"It is a wonderful place, and it is buzzing with people during weekend nights. Lots of restaurants and pubs along the Singapore River. Definitely a good place to chill out! Enjoyed the place with my boyfriend."
,,amazing place,5.0,,anyone who goes to Singapore must visit Clarke quay had the most amazing meal at freemantle fish restaurant looking over the river I can't praise this place enough
,,Great atmosphere and dinner options,4.0,,Terrific place to finish for dinner and drinks. Probably 30+ dinner options and great water fountains and lights in the middle. Kids loved the ice-cream guy who does tricks with the ice creams and just the general buzz in the place. Certainly recommend a visit if looking for dinner options one evening.
,,Bumboats cruise a must,4.0,,"Took a bumboat cruise on the Singapore river which was great. Finally we could see and hear about Singapore's heritage and see some of the old Singapore. Had a lovely captain and assistant and it was great that we were the only two on the boat . Clarke Quay was deserted in the morning as it comes to life at night with all the restaurants there. $20 each was good value.
Went back later at night to have a drink at the brewery on the other side of the quay.
Be aware that nothing opens until night so if you want a coffee look elsewhere."
,,Amazing Lights in the Evening,4.0,,"Went on the evening cruise.....amazing but cruise a bit of a rip off, as it was very short, although there was a commentary and a video. There was a lot of Japanese on board who practically took over the boat, and we could not get off the seats to take any pictures. Also went on the Singapore Flyer, a good experience with fantastic views. Lots of good eateries and entertainment all around the Quay."
,,Great Nightlife Options,4.0,,"If you are from Manila/ the Philippines, Clarke Quay would be your version of Eastwood City. There are many bars to choose from, the view is good (city lights and marina bay), people relaxed, laid back and service is great. It has a posh-y, hip and young vibe.

During the day, it would be a great area for strolling, taking pictures, etc. At night, though, it's best left for the younger set.

Until that point in our trip we had been wondering where all the good looking people in Singapore were, and jokingly made the conclusion they were hiding in Clarke Quay. :) In short, singles and ladies: this would be a great place to meet new people."
,,the cruise wasn't worth it,3.0,,"Went there one night to see the night life and take the return boat cruise to the marina bay. Paid SGD20 each and waited about 20 minutes for the boat. It was a very smooth, quiet and pleasant enough ride lasting about 40 minutes, with a video commentary on the various sights along the way. It only went as far as the helix bridge at the Marina Bay Sands (MBS) before turning back. Having already been to the esplanade and MBS, we didn't really see anything new and felt that it wasn't value for money. Perhaps, one should time it to be on the boat at the bay to coincide with the laser show at MBS for a more memorable experience - easier said than done!

Back at Clarke Quay, the fountains were not on at the central square as they were preparing a make-shift stage or something there. Many food choices but few really halal restaurants. The Indonesian one looked quiet, and the Moroccan place looked more like a bar or nightclub with people drinking outside. So, we took the MRT to the esplanade and ate at Gluttons by the Bay."
,,Fantastic addition to Singapore's nightlife and entertainment!,5.0,,"Singapore really is my favourite city, and Clarke Quay is now one of my favourite places in Singapore to visit! Beautifully lit up at night, sitting by the Singapore river, the atmosphere is relaxed, the food is delicious, and there is plenty of choice! What more could you ask for!"
,,A beautiful and relaxing evening by the river,4.0,,"Transportation is easy., access via Clarke Quay MRT. A safe and lively place even at night. A scenery that not to be missed !"
,,Clarke Quay...take the kids,4.0,,"One of the first things you will see here are the water fountains. Take a change of clothes for the kids or take them in their bathers as they are permitted to have fun in and through the fountains. Of a night they are multi coloured and are quit an attraction. Heaps of places to eat and later into the night the nightclubs come alive so time for the littlies to be back at the hotel and into bed.
Earlier in the evening there are stalls to entice your dollars from the pocket. The only hassil we had here was a person dressed in orange that almost demanded that we give him money for his faith.BUT dont let that put you off as it was only one occasion.
You can take a river cruise on eco friendly vessels. All up a good spot for the family"
,,Very good fun!,5.0,,"Great spot, very clean and with heaps to do. Fabulous restaurants boasting a array of cuisines and all of great quality. For people in Perth, Australia there is a little restaurant called Fremantle, very, very cute! Cant wait to explore again in January 2014!!! :):)"
,,Great fun,5.0,,We took a boat from Marina Bay to Clarke quay in the evening.... The ride was one of the most thrilling one we ever had... The view of buildings lit up was unbelievable. Lots of restaurants out there. Do try roadside ice cream.
,,Great place to go at night,5.0,,Lots and lots of restaurants to eat all situated on the river front. Very pretty at night and always felt safe no matter how late in the night it was. Don't forget to take a river cruise well worth the money and the lights of Marina Bay are awesome.
,,Awesome Nightlife in Singapore,5.0,,"Almost all bars and clubs worth visiting are within walking distance of one another. There is something for almost everyone. There is a real party atmosphere every weekend, and it is great whether you are looking to dance or just looking to have a drink and people-watch"
,,Best night life,5.0,,"People sit on the bridge with their friends here, or hang out at bars, They have boat ride , nice ambience , beautiful lamps , nice crowd , this is a must visit place for you tourists !"
,,Tacky and overpriced,3.0,,"We were unimpressed with Clarke Quay. It is very touristy with lots of bright lights, bars and American restaurants. The food and drinks are expensive, and we didn't think the view or ambiance were anything special.

Restaurants are packed most nights and you'll definitely need a reservation to eat anywhere decent. We ended up eating at Fremantle Seafood market which is was one of the only places we could get a table and it was awful."
,,Expensive touristy but nice view,3.0,,"Prices are at a high, very tourist oriented, but the place is nice and great to stroll or see the sun set with friends. Try a terrace over the water and go on ladoes night or happy hour to save"
,,Wasn't for me,3.0,,"If you like modern plazas with glitzy lights, this is the place for you. In terms of authenticity, it's a bit lacking and you feel you could be anywhere in the world. It all depends on what you are looking for, I imagine it's a great place for singletons to be and be seen."
,,Great place for eating/nightlife,5.0,,"I was lucky enough to stay at a hotel right next to Clarke Quay, so I went out there every night. It was quite a struggle to pick where to eat every night, since everything looked great. A lot of very diverse restaurants, bars and clubs. Drinks are a bit expensive by European standards, but the food is not. Very vibrant and colourfull, especially during the night. Every second bar had a live band. many free toilets, and incredibly clean. As a girl going out alone, this was probably the place I felt safest at night."
,,Fantastic place to spend a long evening,4.0,,"A really chilled out place to spend time with friends with rows and rows of restaurants to spoil you for choice ranging from Indian, Lebanese, Mexican to Oriental, Thai and Continental. Each lane leads one to Vibrant Colours in the form of neat rows of buildings, street vendors, live bands playing awesome music and light emanating from above. Countless eateries leaves one confused but excited at the prospect of trying their food. A Must Visit for anyone going to Singapore."
,,Best Singapore evening hangout,4.0,,"One of the best places for one to let his/her hair down on a weekday or a weekend. It has bars, eateries, discos and riverside restaurants that are open till wee hours of the night (2am on weekdays and 4am on weekends).

There are eateries from different cuisines and almost all of the good places have a live band or loud/dance music. One can chose from spanish food (Octapas - has live band) to mexican (Senor Taco) to Indonesian (Bayang Balinese) to Indin or Persian or Western. The persian places also serve hookah and have belly dancers that sway to persian and indian/bollywood numbers.

One can also buy cheap beer from nearby seven elevens and sit next to the river (if low on budget). There is also a bungee jumping place right next to Clarke Quay, which has a group swing too for the more adventurous ones.

Overall a lively and buzzing place on evenings (spent my 30th Birthday here)"
,,Fabulous buzzy vibe in the evenings,5.0,,We went for supper at Clarkes Quay and wished we had time to return again. We loved the vibrant atmosphere and the choice of restaurants. We ate at a Mexican which was excellent. Wish we had time to go on the boats too. Also good shops.
,,A row of restaurants,3.0,,"By water this looks quite charming. By foot there is nothing here of the past apart from presumably the buildings but now which are all restaurants at ground level, full of posters, plastic seating areas and people hassling you to come into their restaurant if you happen to pause for a nano second to look at a menu. There is a lot of choice here, including the pick-your-own live seafood to have cooked for you, so something for every palate. Clearly popular at lunchtimes and evenings, it however felt rather commercial and a bit grotty."
,,Make reservations on the weekend,4.0,,"This was a great place to visit and we only wish we'd thought to make reservations for a riverside table at any of the restaurants. We chose to dine at Indochine, which was excellent and had fantastic decor."
,,Wonderful at night,5.0,,"We went to Clarke Quay twice. Once to watch the Bledisloe Cup at Boomarang Restaurant (fantastic for expats but expensive) and the second time to go for a river cruise. The quay is brilliant at night, lively and lots of places to drink and eat. The bumboat rides are great with a cool breeze and a view of the city with its lights and sights. Walking around at night we didn't feel unsafe at all. Go for the happy hour, great value!"
,,Best Night spot in town,5.0,,If you want to grab a beer or just chill. Bars at this location is a perfect setting if your travelling alone or with company...!Chill with a glass of beer while enjoying the best view of the river.
,,A great place to spend your evening(or your whole night !),4.0,,"Every time we go to Singapore , we cannot miss visit this venue.From everyplace in Singapore , Clarke Quay is acessible with taxi's or hop off the Clarke Quay MRT exit via the Central shopping mall exit.Best time to visit Clarke Quay is in the afternoon.Stunning view colourful lights from the buildings, especially the River Side Point, and all the buildings that surrounds this area.International variety of foods can be found in riverside restaurants ,Vietnamese (Little Saigon) , HotStone , Jumbo Seafood,Spanish Tapas etc.We tried the Little Saigon , the Pork dishes was astounding.These restaurants are quite expensive compared to other areas in Singapore ,but worth to try , while enjoying the view of the Singapore River.Laser shows can be seen flashing at night.At piers here you can experience the Singapore River Cruise and also can experience the G-Max Catapult attraction here.Many bars and pubs also scattered around.We visited Attica (nice and crowded club), the Forbidden City ( Resto and Club ) , the Arena ( Club ).A must visit to spend your night away in Singapore in this lively place."
,,Food and Drinks,4.0,,It does not look as good in the morning as it does at night but it is still a place to go if you want to walk and see what is available to eat and drink. You can try the Turkish ice cream and eat while you walk. cross to the other side of the bridge for more options. Try Gmax and the swing... My brother who lives in Singapore said the service there is great and tourist friendly unlike in many other places in Singapore where you might think people are rude. Look for the colorful police station if you are walking.
,,"Vibrant, colourful evening",5.0,,"I went to Clark Quay with my partner and my parents for my birthday celebrations. It was a Sunday evening so we weren't sure what would be open, but lucky for us 90% of the venues were open. It is definitely an interesting place with a great deal to see, do and drink on the river. We walked up and down the main streets (which were for pedestrians only) which were lined with colorful bars and restaurants. The river is beautiful and there are many restaurants which take advantage of this with their alfresco dining. The main square is a wide open space, which I believe is sometimes used for concerts but nothing was happening that night. It was very amusing to see some of Singapores finest ladies of the night (and transgendered ladies) trying to solicit international visitors in the square. I'm not sure what the atmosphere is during the day, but perhaps if you have kids, save the visit for when you can arrange a sitter as the whole place is geared very much towards adults after dark.

There was a range of bars to suit all tastes - a dance bar that smelled like beer playing loud techno with bright aqua LED lights, a traditional Irish pub, a Canadian themed pub (complete with stag horn chandeliers, which was great) and a small fighter-pilot themed bar serving drinks and cocktail food where the staff were dressed in Amelia Aerhart type outfits, complete with comical flying goggles and hot-pants. The absolute best experience was in the Indochine Forbidden City complex where Terracotta Soldiers, rainbow LEDs, exotic liquor shots, harem-type furniture and impossibly loud music made for an excellent end to the evening (even though we were literally the only people in the place other than staff).

Overall I think Clark Quay is definitely worth an evening, or two, or three. There is plenty to see and an abundance of restaurants and bars to seek out. I wish we had more time there, I would try the restaurant with the Shisha pipes and belly-dancers, or the restaurant complete with paper lantern lighting and a giant Sakura tree in the middle of the space. Excellent fun, go there right now."
,,Good place to have a few drinks and a meal in a lively environment next to the Singapore river,4.0,,Loads of places for you to drink and eat in a really lively environment both on the river and inside. Definitely worth a visit. You can find a lot of different food types here including restaurants that cater for kids. There is also a Bungy type ride here as well as the ability the go through the quay on a boat ride. I suggest you take the river taxi and see all three quays plus the Merlion and go past Marina sands. There are also some hotels here if you want to stay centrally such as the Swissotel. Gets really busy in the evening and opens till late.
,,Beauty ... By the River ... Must Visit,4.0,,"A very nice place to sit by through your evening. With the beautiful riverside set up, it looks n feels really soothing. And if you are into drinking there are 100s of open air bars that look really classy. The evening can be spent effortlessly with family or friend.

If that is not enough you can take on the boar ride takes you for a round in the same rive that i am speaking about. Also for those adrenaline drive enthusiasts there are this extreme swings that looked scary and thus I didnt try.

Do try to spend one evening here on your Singapore visit."
,,Good place,5.0,,"Its a. Fun place to hang, live music restaurants, different types of foods. I like the place singapore felt alive."
,,Nice boat ride,4.0,,"Nice place to spend a wonderful evening by the river side, They have some good food joints. Go for a river cruise with an audio tour which talks about the history of this beautiful city, $18 for 40 mins ride, you get some really nice view of the city which includes Merlion and Marina Sands."
,,Nice little Bazar of Restaurant,4.0,,"Nice old quay. This quay looks very old and historical but around this place there are many modern fine restaurants. Its a great place to eat-out. But what I found more interesting is a city round trip by a old fashioned chinese boat. The boat starts from the quay and ends here as well. This boat trip allows you to have good look of the city. You can take real good photoes of the city from the boat.

Only thing I didnt like is the water of the river that looks dirty and stinky."
,,A must go place..,5.0,,"It is a wonderful place to hangout on a saturday night in singapore.. The music, the crowd, clubs, people, attractions is a must try..!!

Been there several times, never bored.. I was watching the slingshot and the swing attraction for about an hour, before i bought my ticket and get on to one of those..

And you will be able to see singapore while attached to a cable for seconds.. But it is incredible.."
,,Walk along it!,5.0,,"You'll find bunggee jumping out there! Hahahaha, anyway, the other part fun is that you can hop in to boat, take a look along the river, or just waling around. You'll love the night life over here."
,,Lots of things to see and do.,4.0,,"We stayed at a hotel right on Clarke Quay and every evening we would grab an icecream and just sit and watch the world go by. There is a huge choice of restaurants, clubs, cafes and shopping. Or you can watch the bungee jumpers! Clarke Quay is a great place to be."
,,Has lots to offer the city traveller,4.0,,"Has lots to offer the city traveller. As I said, shops, restaurants and good nightlife. You can some great pictures as well - it reminds me a little of Disneyland. You can also take a boat trip along the river from here."
,,Great Place To Wander Around ... Grab A Bite!,5.0,,"The atmosphere at Clarke Quay is relaxed and we had a very pleasant evening here ... just strolling around, enjoying the sights. Watched a few brave souls on the bungee ride. Had an excellent meal at a steak restaurant. After a few days of sightseeing, this was a very nice relaxed experience. We would definitely go back!"
,,For a fun evening.,5.0,,My family and I spent three evenings in the Clarke Quay area during our recent trip to Sinapore. The restaurants and bars all appear to be great and the stalls and street entertainment are all good. We have been to Singapore many times on business but previously have not been to this area. If nothing else just sit and watch the people go by.
,,great experience,5.0,,"Did the boat cruise that also on a full moon night which adds to the experience though with so many lights chances of Moonlight are very rare but the presence of full moon itself is great.Before the boat ride had dinner at one the many restaurants near the boat ride centre.all sorts of food is available, sea food thai chinese , and also indian veg/ non veg .It is a place to be visited after sunset.If you cross the bridge and are at boat quay there are many more restaurtants ,

The half an hour boat ride starting from clarke quay passing through river quay and then going to marina bay with all those sky scrappers and Merlion is a treat for the eyes"
,,Must Do Boat Ride,4.0,,"There is a vibe at Clarke Quay like Sydney Harbour, San Francisco and the Cape Town Waterfront. Seeing the Singapore CBD from the river is a delight. Get off half way and enjoy the Flyer too."
,,"Wow, nightlife, people, clubs, eating",5.0,,"Must see and do if you visit Singapore, will regret if u don't. Stayed in Novotel just behind, well worth staying there to be part of the action. Great people watching for all, dining options, shopping, light show. Activities every night, especially on Monday nights when one would think Friday and weekends would be more popular"
,,Nice place for a walk,4.0,,This comes in one of the happening places in Singapore called Clarke's Cay. The reflection of the city lights in the water gives a pristine view in the night.
,,Must go if in town,4.0,,"Place is really awesome. The place is on both sides of the river, one is quite side and other filled with clubs and bars. If you just want to see and enjoy the place and not go to some bar then you can sit on staircase near the river with your own drinks. It is best when there is some wind as otherwise it gets really humid to sit outside. There is 7/11 shop nearby from where you can buy drinks and sit outside. There is bungy jumping and water boat ride also, but it was not that great...one can easily skip this."
,,must go for a drink at night,5.0,,"good place ,lights ,cafe,bar ,night cruise,and well designed along the river side makes this place the heart of nightlife in singapore"
,,the it spot,5.0,,"Great place to sit somewhere and people watch. Most places have outdoor seating with food and looks like the night life area.

Be warned pricey as heck ( went to 3 bars avg beer 18).
Wonder if hooters that pricey??

Tons of ""ladies"" asking for good time if your into that.
net great place to get a drink, dance a bit, people watch"
,,Worth A Visit,3.0,,"We found it to be quite reminiscent of Darling Harbour in Sydney.

Nice to walk through and look around, but the restaurants and bars seemed quite overpriced to us (although probably what you would expect in a top tourist area).

We had a couple of quiet (happy hour) drinks and a snack in one of the waterfront restaurants, soaked up the atmosphere, and were then quite happy to go elsewhere for our dinner."
,,The best night life in the city,5.0,,"Whether you are in search of restaurants, cafe, bars or clubs, this place has all of them. The place is really live at night. A good time to hang out and spend the night together with friends or partner."
,,Fun eats,5.0,,"I prefer Clarke Quay at night where the bright lights come alive. You can take a river boat ride from here, or dine in one of the restaurants and enjoy a chilli crab meal, or simply hang out with friends and take in the beautiful ambiance. It is close to the MRT station and the mall, so it's accessible."
,,Food everywhere,5.0,,Clarke quay has many many restaurants of all different cuisines. Not a cheap place to eat but food at most places is good. Very lively at night not so much during the day. Can recommend coriander leaf bistro for dinner.
,,This place is wild,4.0,,"Totally cool. When people in Singapore want to unwind this is where to come. Filled with clubs, wine bars and food. Light , light and more lights . My daughter through the water spounts with changing lights were awesome and enjoyed playing in them with other kids in the steamy singapre evening. Were there in April 2012. I loved the way evryone hangs out on the ridge drinking and smoking with there friends. It is not scary at all, no brawls etc..Go at night time,"
,,Many choices of food!,4.0,,"Many restaurants to choose between, there is something for everyone. Nice located next to the river."
,,Nice Place to hangout !!,4.0,,"It is a Lively place with lots of good restaurant along side river & nearby. Good ambience, dances, shows even you can enjoy swings in this place. Enjoy Turkey Ice cream. You will love it the way in which he gives the Ice cream. one can make video of it. It is 5 SGD ice cream but worth it.
Drop down at Clarke Quay MRT just a small walk to this place."
,,"Only at night, not a day thing!",4.0,,"We stayed next door to Clarke Quay so walked through the area on numerous occasions. Was surprised that most things were closed during the day. As the day draws to a close the place really comes alive, there are numerous restaurants of pretty much all types of food. Lots of little market type stalls, bars and night clubs. In the middle of the 4 parts there is a big fountain that the kids all seemed to enjoy playing in. They have the reverse bungy and several river cruises that leave from here. It is an interesting place to just stroll around. We ate at 2 different restaurants during our time in Singapore, they were both nice but also quite expensive compared to the rest of Singapore. The Steaks we found worth spending a bit more money on but the Asian type food, we thought it was nicer and 10 times cheaper in any of the several food courts outside Clarke quay."
,,"Resturants, coffe shops and lights",4.0,,"""Clarke "" as the licals call it is a fun place to eat, sit in coffe shops and walk between the beautifull surroundings, there you can also take a ride in the river to see the city from a different angle, it is fun especially at night!!!"
,,Sparkling nights,4.0,,"We were absolutely charmed by this lively, bustling place. There were live belly dances happening in front of some restaurants. The whole atmosphere was like one big party happening all over. The views of the river and boats and surrounding with the twinkling lights are fascinating. Very enjoyable evening. Except for one small grievance, we had dinner at one of the restaurants 'Hutong' lining the riverfront, the food was just okay. Without warning they handed the bill at 11pm, saying they are closing down, when almost all the other restaurants were open till midnight. The worst part was the amount we had to pay for the less than satisfactory dinner. Exorbitant! Choose your restaurant wisely. Otherwise Clarke Quay is a very very enjoyable place especially at night."
,,Great place on a Saturday night.,4.0,,"My wife and I spent two weekends in Singapore recently and on both occassions had dinner and drinks down near the river and entertainment areas, great for choice of venus and the safe relaxed atmosphere, lots to see and do whether actively involved or just watching the world walk past in a few hours.

Ferry service and river boats coming and going every few minutes will take you all the way down river and out into the marina bay to see the skyline at night time which is quite spectacular."
,,Well worth a look,4.0,,"Touristy but close to train and some great photo opportunities. Not cheap but well laid out with plenty of variety - great people watching opportunities. Plenty of bar and eating options. Overall, a nice setting by the river."
,,Awesome place,5.0,,Visited here on numerous trips to Singapore. Clarke Quay has a fantastic atmosphere with numerous restaurants & bars in a truely beautiful setting along the river.
,,Awesome Place,5.0,,"Went to Clarke Quay one evening while in Singapore, this place is awesome! Bars, restaurants, shops all along the waterfront. There is an overhead covering the promenade outdoor area that is spectacular. Place was packed with people enjoying a great evening out. Highly recommend one takes this place in at least one while in Singapore."
,,great atmosphere,5.0,,this is a great area to hang out. lots of restaurants and bars along the river. we ate at a singaporean restaurant overlooking the river. lots to watch as so much happening here. locals and tourists enjoying themselves.
,,Cool place,4.0,,"If one place screams out Singapore, it's Clarke Quay!

Singapore is a really cool place, and there are cool bars, restaurants and shops on Clarke Quay

You can also catch the hop-on hop-off bus from there, and lots of boat trips run from there too

Our hotel was in Clarke Quay, so took a stroll during the day and of an evening

At night it's really busy, and a fun place to go for a beer or some dinner

During the day, it's more chilled out

Definitely worth some time walking around here"
,,A great place to spend a evening to eat drink or just browse whilst in Singapre.,4.0,,"This is one of the lively hip places to spend an evening when in Singapore on the river banks most evenings it's a busy place full of sound and lights, we went first on a saturday and it was heaving with shows , singers and people having fun.There are restaurants providing dishes from all over the world or you can just sit on the steps of the banks and watch the world go by. The constant flow of pleasure craft moving up and down the river (which you can travel on) just adds to the atmosphere. Trip this out if you have the time and see the sands boats on top of the hotel in the bar .so lights camera, action and have fun."
,,Party Quay !,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a sight to behold especially in the evenings, with all the colorful lights and the music from all the pubs resonating to a good effect. It's the place to party and if you are a tourist here, it is a must visit place even if you are not much of a drinker. The wave of people that you pass in one quick tour of the pubs on both sides of the Singapore river connected by a bridge is just overwhelming. One can also opt for the Singapore River Cruise and get a good look at the either shore lined with boat shaped bars and some famous international chains. It has the perfect spot for any type of visit, be it for a couple or a group of friends or as a family. For the adventure enthusiasts, there is the 5G ride which is sure to give a jolt in your stomach. Overall a very enjoyable experience and one of the best places for a Saturday night out."
,,A happening place on weekend nights,4.0,,"The area behind the bridge comes to life at night and there are many themed pubs and restaurants. One of them was themed on a hospital and had laid out hospital beds for seating complete with white bed sheets. The drinks were served in pouches which were hanged by the nurses on the bedside stand and the juice was to be had from the IV line. It is not the only quirky place on the quay. Also there are the regular Hagendas and coffee chains here. Bungee jumping and giant swing are not far either. Dancing , dining or simply people watching, Clarke quay on weekends is an experience to remember."
,,Value for the money,3.0,,"Stayed there for just 3 nights, hotel is good value for what you pay, breakfast was ok, internet only in the lobby after you ask the reception for the password. Staff could be a little bit more professional."
,,A MUST for tourists....,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is one section along the Singapore River and is characterized by huge 'umbrella-like' structures that keep the rain and bright sun out. It is a fantastic area for tourists and locals alike. It's made up of bars/pubs/restaurants of all different types/flavors. Lots of ATMs and bathrooms around. In the center of this area is a fountain area....lots of fun for kids and adults. Many times they have bands or events in this center fountain area (the fountains are turned off obviously). You can reach Clarke Quay via the MRT (Clarke Quay station). Parking can be expensive & hard to find so the MRT is your best bet. Great for adults, families, kids and don't forget to bring your camera. Can be very quiet in the morning but it is spectacular and usually buzzing by late afternoon. If you are only in Singapore for a few days, you don't want to miss this."
,,Night View of Clarke Quay is Wonderful:),4.0,,"I spend day and night in clarke Quay and got a boat to look around the river. In the day the view is good but at night it is wonderful view, the light of the building spread on the river. What an amazing night, romantic night. I recommend you guys to come there at night to enjoy the most beautiful of Clarke Quay :)"
,,Beautiful by night,4.0,,"We decided to take a look around Clarke Quay one night for a meal and drinks. They have an enormous amount of variety here; with something for everyone.

We felt comfortable just strolling around and taking in all the sights and sounds whilst soaking up the atmosphere around us. It really is spectacular at night. There is no shortage of bars or food outlets to choose from. The only downside is that it is very pricey especially for drinks. I found drink prices over double that of other areas visited but I suppose that is to be expected in an area that supports nightlife and partying.

If your happy to stroll around and watch the lit up ferries travelling along the quay and enjoy the hustle and bustle of people enjoying themselves, then this worth a night time venture."
,,Amazing time at an amazing place,5.0,,"This place is rockin' come night fall. Everything you could possibly need.. Music, beer, friendly outgoing people, diverse attractions and awesome drunk people food. This place is a must go but make sure you don't work the next day, chances are you won't want to leave and when u do it will be close to 7 am. Have fun and be safe, hail a cab"
,,Best place to be at night,5.0,,"its an excellent place, full of music and life and it goes on till early morning.
Would recommend the Chupitos bar for the variety of shots that they offer
and the Pump room for the live performances and the whole live atmosphere out there..
on the contrast the Aquanova restaurant bar was a complete disappointment and will not recommend it.

all in all nice place to be with friends and party late night...!!!"
,,Go when dark comes.,4.0,,It was completely dead during the day but wow did things light up in the evening. Music and bars were open and a nice atmosphere. There were a lot of youths and clubs.
,,Excellent place for all age group,5.0,,"I have been in S'pore from last 3+ yrs and I have visited this place almost 20 times atleast, this place has its own charm which is unbeatable.

Without any reason or occasion also this place is beautiful and extra-ordinary.

On special occasions its outstanding, this place gets decorated in each and every occasion, like new year, valentine day, chines new year etc

Its has scenic view, bars, sports activity and lounge etc

So much to write but I would say that its your time to go there and see it"
,,One of the best places in SG,4.0,,"Last year, our friend brought us here on a Friday night and it was a blast! After a hearty dinner at Hooter's, we got to ride on the water taxi for free. The view was just amazing, especially when the ride was by the Marina Bay sands. The ride also had this woman playing a guitar which was very good, and it made the trip more soothing. I think we really had a good view of Singapore from this place. We even got the chance to watch this foreign band play and had a great time. Would surely come back to this place when we have a chance to go back to SG."
,,This place is a blast !!!!,5.0,,"If you are in singapore, you have to be here on weekend. The place goes crazy and lively at night. So much to do in a single night, eat drink dance do whatever you want to ... awesome place. Crowded place."
,,Great Nightlife,5.0,,Nice place to chill there . There is G-max to those who love thrilling rides. There's a lots of bars and clubs. or you can just choose to sit at Clarke Quay River .
,,nice place,4.0,,"A little pricey, but you have access to many restaurants, and bars. the place is beautiful, be careful, if you don't like crowds, avoid certain nigths on the week."
,,Great night live,4.0,,"I like the atmosphere, there are so many restaurant to be chosen. So many culture to be seen, so many taste we can find. Ease your eyes..."
,,Blessed to have this area in Singapore,5.0,,"As a Singaporean, I consider myself and our country very lucky to have this area (clarke quay) surrounded by beautiful restaurants, river views, bars and clubs. It's really one of the highlights for anyone visiting. Its very beautiful, especially by night and a lot of fun. We go as often as we can as locals, but do keep in mind it does tend to get a bit pricy. Enjoy."
,,Why do guide books recommend this?,2.0,,"Clarke Quay is recommended in several guidebooks and on Trip Advisor, I'm really not sure why. To me it looks dated and tired. The main attraction seems to be for tourists who are looking to drink a jug or three of beer as that is what is advertised in most bar windows. If you are into that scene then Clarke Quay will probably work for you, if not look elsewhere."
,,Tourist rip off,2.0,,"There is nothing special about Clarke Quai except for the price of the food. Very basic food, almost fast food quality, for a very high price. Nice place to walk through, but don't stay there for dinner. It is a just a tourist trap."
,,Very Cool area and buzzing at night,4.0,,"We saw CQ at both day and night and it is definitely a fantastic place to visit at anytime of day! The nightime atmosphere is a full on party, with the streets lined full of people drinking and hanging out, bars all packed too.

Being singapore it was very expensive wherever you chose, however we found a lovely relaxing place on the water front to chill out to some great live acoustic music called 'The Lillypad' which i highly reccomend visiting!"
,,Nightlife at it's best!,5.0,,"Fantastic Clarke Quay - comes alive at night - with lots of riverside bars and restaurants, so a perfect place to hangout.... ;-)"
,,Good place and a lot of options.,4.0,,If you are a budget traveler this is the place you will find interesting. You can bring your own liquor and drink on the Bridge. You have lot of options to choose from if you plan to eat one of the places here. Very crowded during the the weekends. But nice place to visit. I met a few Indians while i was drinking on the bridge. You will always meet some people and can just have fun with them or join them along.
,,Full of bars for night life,5.0,,"- restaurants / bars served by the live music (not all restaurant have this)
- a lot of pretty girls that makes your nose bleeding lol
- try the ball games (don't know the name) if you want some adrenalin sport
- all open until 2am"
,,Too less time to explore,4.0,,A must see for pub goers. The atmosphere there is fantastic and too many pubs to be check out. Most of them also offer varieties of food as well.
,,Changed so much over the years,3.0,,"Clarke Quay has five blocks of restored warehouses with more than 15O restaurants, bars and nightclubs.
For us it is nowhere as good as it was years ago so if you go there don't bother going during the day as its a stinking hot concrete jungle with hardly anything open at all.

Night time is totally different!
Clarke Quay is always busy and extremely popular at night, the hard part is deciding which restaurant to eat in! There are so many choices, try the King Satay Club, our favorites there are satays of course and murtabah. There are also moored floating restaurants.

Clarke Quay has changed so much and for us has lost some of its appeal. Last visit we decided to have dinner there at the Highlander, unfortunately we were hit by a huge storm and the big awnings could not handle the rain so everyone had to go inside to eat their meals.

It was terrible, more like a nightclub and so noisy, worst part was it was so dark you could hardly see what you were eating. The prices here were crazy, but it is a tourist area so they can get away with it. Our bill for 2 x Bangers and Mash, 2 small Tiger beers and 2 ice teas was S$120 - about A$94. The food was not good either!"
,,Good Spanish band,5.0,,"I love the band. They played very well unlike other clubs. Band members have a good interaction with crowd. Service not too bad. Personally,I think no other band can sing latino song as good as them. I'm always to Cuba every two Weeks once. Salsaaaaaaaaaa"
,,Bit Expensive !!!,3.0,,"Everyone said it's awesome but really i didn't find anything like that only if you like drinks and you have a budget to spend in pub,bar then only I guess you can enjoy except that only walk around water nothing special."
,,What an unbelievable place..,5.0,,"What an unbelievable place this is. From the myriad of bars and restaurants to the thrill of the reverse bungey it is certainly party central and the place to go. On top of that the ""working"" ladies patrol this area quite openly and if you are walking alone expect to be approached frequently. A word of warning to the uninitiated though. There are many ladyboys here and at first glance they look like any gorgeous Asian woman and if you are going to partake of any service double check first! I wouldn't recommend the Crocodile Dundee grab though, be a little more subtle. For people watching it is an absolute must so park yourself in one of the many bars that lead into the central square and be prepared for a fantastic night."
,,"Very quaint, great restaurants, shops and good nightlife",5.0,,"Has lots to offer the city traveller. As I said, shops, restaurants and good nightlife. You can some great pictures as well - it reminds me a little of Disneyland. You can also take a boat trip along the river from here."
,,Clarke Quay,5.0,,Also a must visit place in Singapore. During night the place is really wonderful because of the lightening of the buildings around the place..
,,Not to be missed,4.0,,"A beautiful place colorful and picturesque, it is a pleasure to go there during the day and night.
It is one of my favorite places in Singapore, one of those places where I never get tired of going there.
I love especially during the night with its many bars and restaurants open until late in the thousands of lights that illuminate the nights of this place, full of life and young people who flock to the café and some place where you can listen to live music .
Really a beautiful corner of Singapore which I highly recommend to visit, even only for a few hours."
,,Quirky but commercial,3.0,,"We found Clarke Quay to be fabulous at night and wonderous to walk around with everything lit up and lots of entertainment in the streets, however the food was expensive and very commercial, certainly not the place to go for a traditional Singapore experience, but it was fun."
,,Very Nice Place To Spend The Evening,4.0,,"This area is full of pubs, clubs and lovely restaurants finished with good views of surroundings city architect and river flowing through it. Its a must visit place while you're in singapore. Also if you like clubbing try the club call Attica here."
,,atmosphere excellent,4.0,,"More bars and restaurants than you could possibly visit in a year, very popular with ex-pats and holiday makers, excellent buzz, pull up a beer and people watch"
,,Hive of activity,4.0,,"Bars, restaurants, night clubs, casual dining, carnival rides, we walked around surprised at the amount of people out and about enjoying all this area had to offer. One side has lots of night clubs that was filled with 20 year olds and on other side of river was more for all ages wanting some fun"
,,Superb Eat out be here on Friday evening,5.0,,"Come see and enjoy food here. Food from the world and beer beer beer. Daytime is equally attractive with happy hours on beer till 7 pm and never miss the Friday evening here, Music, beer and dance all over."
,,Bistros and More Lights!,5.0,,You'll surely enjoy bar-hopping and resto-dining experiences in Clark Quay. Plus the GX5 is just around the corner. My wife walked hand-in-hand and had a romantic night. Families should also come and see the place.
,,Hopping part of Singapore at night!!!,5.0,,"First, do the river boat tour at night. A totally awesome view of the city and it's buildings. This place is jam packed with bars and nightclubs so be prepared to party."
,,Buzzing with life,4.0,,"We came to clarke quay at about 10 p.m in the night, and the area was buzzing with activity.
There are a lot of restaurants, bars, cafes etc around this area, and walking through them fills your senses with a variety of smells, tastes and sounds.
We sat at a pub and then a pizzeria, and the atmosphere was good overall, so was the food.
there were small shops as well, but we didnt explore the entire area. We easily got a cab to return to our hotel at night, and it was a good night out."
,,Must Visit Place,5.0,,This is the place which is totally different at night compared to Day.. It has everything at night.. Food + Music + Dance + Drink + River Side And much more
,,Superb!!!,5.0,,Full of glitter....lot of options....nice area........ We can get more crazy friends from different countries .....!!!!! Must Go to have some mixed fun
,,I am totally in Love with this Place,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a collection of everything. it will blow your mind away. Doesn’t matter what you like. Because, this place is full of everything.

If you are at Clarke for dinner…
You have hundreds of choices. Indian, Chinese, Italian.. Anything..

If you are looking for adventure – you have the G-MAX Reverse Bungee & GX-5 Extreme Swing.
I recommend it’s worth every penny you spend (even its $45 for a 2-3 minute adventure).

If you go there to Party, Just walk around… there are plenty of cool clubs.
DO NOT waste your time standing on the queue of “Club Attica”.
There is a nice club called “Play House”, it’s really nice club and drinks and music is awesome. First go there and enjoy. Later you can try ""Club Attica""

If you go to Singapore, visit Clarke Quay , eat, drink, dance and meet new people."
,,Lit up at night,4.0,,"Clarke quay is the place to be in the evening. There are lots of bars, cafes and restaurants along the river. You can hop onto one of the river boats for a short cruise - we enjoyed a free boat ride as this came free with our Hop on Hop off bus ticket."
,,In love with this place,5.0,,"It is definitely a relaxing place for stopover after whole day of walking-tour.
Have a sip of your beverage and sit at the stairs by the waterside in the evening, that's the best thing ever.
The view is mesmerizing and you can simple feel tranquility with the romantic feeling.
It is just a nice place for you enjoy by the waterside without spending any cost.. =]"
,,Enjoy the experience,5.0,,"If holidaying in Singapore, try to fit in a Saturday evening visit to Clarke Quay and adjoining Boat Quay. The atmosphere is electric and most of Singapore's population seems to be there, particularly the youngsters. The riverside is crammed full of restaurants, cafes and bars, you are spoilt for choice. There is hustle, bustle, music, fabulous lighting, but you never seem to be under any pressure, and you feel so safe. For good free entertainment, spend a little time watching the crazy bungee jumpers!"
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"Lots to do - reverse bungee jumping and giant swing for adrenaline junkies; sitting by the water side for the calm or romantic; or dance and drinks. Whatever catches your fancy, there's a lot to do. Of course, you need money in your pocket otherwise, just sit by the water or walk through - those cost nothing."
,,average place,3.0,,"Its a nice surrounding but nothing much to say about. Its good if you are with some friends to enjoy the evening. The beers are overpriced. Food is expensive.Check the menus and prices
before you take a seat. To be there once is okay. Not more .That will only empty your pocket for no reason!"
,,Clarke Quay,4.0,,"Being from Baltimore, MD, I can appreciate a waterfront marketplace and entertainment complex. Clarke Quay delivers the goods. Cool restaurants, shopping and neat design."
,,Good place for Dine and Drink,4.0,,"Nice place to dine and drink in open area. Price is reasonable among the restaurant, just walk through and read the menu before sit down. Not hurry, there is lot of restaurants and shops along both sides of the river."
,,Just OK,3.0,,Not what we expected after all the hype! Overpriced beer and food - cross the river and eat in the markets at the shopping centre. Nice place to sit and watch the crowds go by but more of a place for the 20 - 30 year olds
,,lovely way to spend an evening,5.0,,"We enjoyed a couple of late evenings in Clarke Quay. The atmosphere was buzzing and so many people there. I was surprised at how many expats there were at some of the pubs and bars. Jam packed in. We had already had dinner so just enjoyed a drink or too and people watched for a while.

It was so nice to see people drinking and enjoying themselves peacfully so unlike the pub scene in Perth Australia where the young people are drunk and fights break out night after night. Yes I would go there again."
,,Still Pleasant but Tatty,3.0,,"Clarke Quay is a mecca for tourists and it has a great riverside ambience, although after not having visited it for a few years found it somewhat crowded. Sadly its getting very tired looking, and rundown, from pavement condition to paintwork it needs some upkeep, so a victim of its own success. Of course you pay a price premium for restaurants and no doubt rents for business is sky high. For an occasional night out is great and enjoyed eating chilli crab at Jumbo seafood and a beer with work friends at the Bungy bar which is of course next to the screams of the Bungy attraction."
,,Nice joint,3.0,,"Place to hangout for day time beer or night time hangout. There's lots of choices here to hangout with your friends, from cheap beer place to more expensive one. The place have a singapore river view with some quite windy air."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"Its a beautiful place to be with your loved ones. Sitting on the riverside having food and coffee ..
Such an amazing experience, as it was drizzling when my husband and me were having food at ""tcc restaurant"" , which was at the riverside. Very lively and amazing place to visit and spend some hours. Also there is a boat quay ride for people who wants to enjoy the river view."
,,nice...,4.0,,"boating from clarke quay along the river is nice...a good way to spend an evening..
delicious sea food also available...
and famous for its nightlife...so many pubs, catering almost all geographical locations.. ;)
and while you are walking, there is a good chance dat u miit b surprised with a cabaret show in any one of the pubs...usually held outside..."
,,Nice ambience!!,5.0,,Very nice ambience with very lively environment around... Most of the pubs n restaurants have live music playing..a must visit place for youngsters who want to experience Singapore's night life..
,,Fun place,5.0,,The hotel tell us to try here and it was very fun place.Many bars and resturants with cover when raining. We like very much walking round and buying from counters there and we had deliciuous ice cream from funny man wit bell hat! Nice food at Pump Resturant with music and no cover charge.
,,Clarke Quay - a taste of everything,4.0,,"With such a variety of restaurants, bars and clubs, Clarke Quay has a variety of different tastes and experiences. Shopping in the area along the Singapore River is quite good with a real variety there too. Everything from up-market to average consumers seems to be accessible.

Admittedly, I went to Hooters in Clarke Quay a couple of times. It was the first time that I had been to one with service outdoors. It was a nice touch as the outdoor area was beside the river. All in all, a good experience"
,,Nice place,4.0,,"It is a nice spot where spend the evening/night with friends, there a lot of bars and restaurants (sea food) around the river. One evening you have to spend there.!"
,,Nice night out by the river....,5.0,,"I have always loved the Clarke Quay area with it's quaint shops, although I was a bit worried by the UFO looking additions that went up in the mid noughties, I have to admit I do still love the feel that the area has.

It is a pleasant area, with some great restaurants, nice bars and great river views. A visit to Singapore is not complete for me without dinner at Clarke Quay."
,,"Restaurants, bars and oh don't forget their thrill rides!",5.0,,"We actually went here for the thrill rides, Extreme swing and G-max reverse bungy. Really crowded at night with lots of tourists,street performers, restaurants and bars. We really find it enjoyable at night, watching you riding their thrill rides and screaming your lungs out!

SGD69 for the 2 rides. While SGD45 if separately.
MRTs are closing at 11:30pm, so if you'll be riding a taxi past midnight, expect that there will be a surcharge."
,,Night Out in Singapore,4.0,,Restaurants along this area are usually full around dinner time. Most people be it local or tourist tend to hang out at Clark Quay for dinner and a beer or two after work. Have a pleasant stroll after dinner while enjoying the breeze.
,,Nightlife Personified,5.0,,"Clarke Quay to be has always been the hub of nightlife in Singapore. With its riverside bars and eateries and the extended CQ across the water fountain junction, there is doubt if one can not like this place.
For a good night out, one can always find a place suitable to his/her own mood and liking. The numerous cafes. bars, restaurants and the takeaway joints cater to all cuisines and taste buds. Friday and Saturday nights are exceptionally crowded when the locals outnumber the tourists. Well people here definitely know how to party and there is no other place like Clarke Quay. Bar Hopping is a pleasure here and not a nightmare .

Having said that, one can always go to this place before sunset ..."
,,Nice area on the river side.,4.0,,Clark Quay. One of the favourite areas of Singpore. Saterday evenings it is packed with locals and expats who work and live in Singapore. Bit too crowded sometimes. Very expensive.... A small bottle of beer can easily cost 15 Sing Dollar.
,,Great to walk ... but not to eat,3.0,,This is really a place that tourists eat and there are much better places to eat than here. However it's a great place to walk around and then theres also the bumboats.
,,"Ok for a look-see, but touristy & overpriced",3.0,,"REALLY crowded on xmas eve, but a LOT more sparse the next night.

Convenient little stand to buy tickets for the DUCKtours and Hop on Hop off buses, but the rest of it is pricey touristy stuff (i.e. Hooters, Turkish ice cream, bars, restaurants) that I can experience anywhere else, so I opted not to partake in favor of some more memorable Singaporean experiences. :P

Despite all the commercial stuff, Clarke Quay also offers a nice view of Central Mall from across the brown river. And there is also 24-hour 7-Eleven nearby to stock up on drinks and snacks."
,,Great place for clubbing with friends...,4.0,,"My visit to clarke quay was awesome... Although i didnt try the ""bungee"", it looked like fun... Lots of great places to eat by the riverside... A must visit for a fun filled evening with friends..."
,,Perfect place to hangout and spend and awesome time with friends,5.0,,"The whole place is no nicely done!
Beside the river.
Numerous bars and restaurants.
GMAX Reverse Bungee. ALL IN ONE PLACE
Its really nice and if you want to have fun hangout with your friends and also drink its a spot for you.
Very nice crowd and gathering and always happening.
I had been to GMAX which is a MUST MUST visit for everyone."
,,Great for hanging out and people watching,4.0,,"At night, this place is like Canary Wharf on speed. Crammed with restaurants serving all types of cuisine you can think of. There's even a Hooters here! (tough to choose between the chicken wings or breasts though). Bars galore and plenty of live music so there is something for everyone here!"
,,Great place to chill & have dinner,5.0,,"We love to chill out for some drinks on Fridays at Clarke quay as there are a huge variety of restaurants in this area. Food can be a little costly at the restaurants here as its a prime location. I would highly recommend peony jade restaurant located here, they serve delicious Chinese cuisines here. Remember to reserve seats for weekends!"
,,A River Side Bar and Restaurant Complex,4.0,,"This is supposed to be one of the historic river quays that has been turned into a bsr and restaurant complex. It is very difficult to see much of anything historic, but, at night, it does come alive as a large number of bars and restaurants vie for your business. There are many different cuisines on offer, but prices are rather high by Singapore standards. We found that many restaurants had plenty of tables during our visit.
A nice area to stroll and people watch and some great night photo opportunities and very easy access from the subway system."
,,Nice for an evening,4.0,,Took a bumblebee boat ride which lasted about 20 minutes. It was included in the cost of our excursion from the cruise ship so I don't know what the price to do is on it's own but they are constantly busy. A good way to see a bit of the river. Lots of bars and restaurants but be prepared to spend big $. Singapore is expensive. Ate at a Japanese restaurant on the Quay. Don't recall the name but I don't think there are too many and it was ok. We got lucky and caught them at Happy Hour so so a beer was only $5.00. Beer usually goes for about $15.00. There is a bungy type ride that holds about 4 people and looks hair raising.
,,Eat...drink..hangout,4.0,,"This area is just along side Singapore river. The place has numerous hotels serving various cuisines and pubs. The place come to life after evening. Yes the food and drinks are costly compared to other restaturants due to the location.

Also this is boarding point for bumblebee river taxi which operates till 10 pm. So you can take night ride of river and Marina bau area. The boat quay is just opposite side of Clark quay on other side of river."
,,Nice for a beer. Singapore prices tho,4.0,,"Plenty of food, Bars, Entertainment here.. nice food along the river boat rides look nice.. spent new years here had fun.. but people in Singapore dont know how to get loose, or there not allowed..hahaha"
,,River view point.,4.0,,Nice way to enjoy the river view while you eating or drinking a glass of beer . Nice restaurants difrent cousine (Italian mex Japan among the others . Me and my wife we try one of the japan rest. Which was great..
,,Pretentious,2.0,,Great if you want lots or noisy bars! Disliked the fact that it was not really for families. Recommend Boat Quay instead.
,,lots to do,4.0,,"great place comes alive at night lots of bars and restaurants , sit and watch singapore walk by , all under cover too stay dry even in the rainy times, well worth a visit"
,,"Tell the taxi driver, ""Clark Kee!""",4.0,,"Quay is pronounced ""kee"" (for all you Americans that think Quay could rhyme with day), but of course I didn't know that until I got corrected by the 2nd taxi driver after I pointed to it written down in my notebook. The first taxi driver tried to correct me, but I shook my head when he said Clark ""Kee."" I didn't come here for the variety of bars or clubs, which seem like magnets for foreign tourists. I came here because it was a thriving place to hang out for free by the river at night with music, a cool view--watched daring people get launched on bungee rides across the river, and lots of local and touristy people. I came here actually on two occasions: first by subway-convenient access-to chill by the river and second by taxi to board the boat tour during the day and enjoy a relaxing foot massage inside the mall at Wan Yang."
,,Something for everyone,4.0,,"Fantastic place heaps of eats,drinks and things to look at and do.the night life here is great and it seems that the whole of Sinapore comes here to party after dark."
,,Looking to Party ? or for a boat on the river ?,3.0,,"Clarke Quay is a hub of local nightlife and shopping, with entertainment, and many bars and restaurants, all of which seemed pretty expensive to us. We ended up eating in a food court in a shopping mall on our evening visit there, having the previous day eaten in an Irish pub there and paid over the odds in our opinion for a couple of beers some chips and fish goujons (over $45 Singapore dollars !)

If you like the party atmosphere and have deep pockets this could well be the place for you !

You can also pick up the river cruises from here."
,,Great way to spend the night,5.0,,"Clark Quay is a must visit in Singapore . Amazing selection of restaurants and cafes , street performers , and great romantic views ."
,,Great stretch of nightlife,4.0,,"If you're looking for the ultimate nightlife paired with endless amount of friendly people to meet, then Clarke Quay is the place after 10pm. Some places even close at 5am for the ones that just can't get enough of it."
,,"A Singapore MUST! A shopping, dining, entertainment and cultural focal point! Tip: check their website",5.0,,"You could easily make a whole day at and around Clarke Quay, with several highlights.

It's easily accessible by MRT.

Stroll around the area, and look around at the shops, cafes, bars and restaurants.

You can take a Bumboat tour along the Singapore River.

Have lunch at one of the riverside restaurants- a good choice is Brewerkz, where they have a good range of lunch specials.

In the evening, there's a range of bars and nightclubs.

It's a focal point for celebration of festivals- check the official website for a diary of events. They will have street stalls and entertainers- adding to the festive ambience.

It's a vibrant and fun place to visit- highly recommended.

In the immediate vicinity, there are several parks and museums- adding to the overall experience."
,,"Great Place, Perfect Amnbience, and Paradise for Food Lover",5.0,,"The Jumbo Restaurant at Riverside was a really great place for food lover and best place to hang on with! I've seen there also a live band that was really goo with a night view. Music, ambience, the foods, and the restaurant just can say I love it perfectly. I surely will come over this place reall soon. Been here for 2 times. But still, love the night view when I catch the dinner here. And the waiter was so friendly and entertaining!"
,,girls night out,4.0,,"we had a fantastic night out full of fun lots of dancing .The live band was brilliant .Hospitality was very warm and they made sure we had every thing we needed . atmosphere was electric .
If you want to have fun and dance the night away this is the place to be for all ages .
Be there or be square !"
,,the place for food lovers,4.0,,"You can find almost any kind of food here. There are rows of restaurants and bars you can choose from. Pick a table near the river to get the best view, especially at night time. The Jumbo restaurant at Riverside is one of the most famous seafood place, but you need to reserve a table to eat there."
,,Stunning surroundings but expensive,3.0,,Many millions of dollars have been spent creating a stunning bar and restaurant experience in the heart of the city. It is a great place to watch ex-pat bankers spending their bonuses - you can even join in if you can live with the prices for drinks and food which are verging on a total rip-off in many of the establishments. The toilet facilities for some restaurants are very basic considering the overall standard of the development. The older pubs and restaurants at nearby Boat Quay offer better value.
,,Day or night both are equally enjoyable....,5.0,,"Every time it looks better...such a place is Singapore ! Tourists might find Clarke Quay is the best during day & night both during their stay in Singapore . The picturesque view of Singapore river and its surroundings will attract them so immensely that it will be difficult to leave the place like me! Evenings are enjoyed with different activities...loud music, crowded restaurants, bright lights all around and most importantly the aroma of sea food... so tempting . No specific name of restaurant is required all are having wide range of choices, in fact it will be difficult to select what to order.A perfect spot for photo shoot."
,,A great hangout in midst of it all,5.0,,"Great ambiance, large selection of restaurants, bars and clubs to choose from. Most establishments are good quality and above. Wonderful for an evening out with business colleagues or friends."
,,A great selection of bars and restaurants,5.0,,We sat in tapas restaurant that had a great singer that night and enjoyed overlooking the water and fine service. Food looked good too. Clarke Quay offers variety of bars and restaurants and is lively till late night.
,,Take stroll but eat inside,4.0,,"We were supposed to eat by the river, but being on a tight budget surely did not allow us to do this. But that doesn't mean that we can't enjoy the view. So we walked around the river and checked out the restaurants, we even took some of photos of the lovely Christmas decor surrounding the malls. When we were done walking and started to feel hungry, we went at the basement of the mall and looked if we can eat there. Luckily, there was this corner named Porky Pork which was I think, Filipino-owned. They had their version of lechon and longganisa which we ordered. It was delicious and just right."
,,A very surprising restaurant visit,5.0,,"We had seen Clarke Quay from Singapore's hop-on, hop-off bus and the many restaurants along the river so decided to visit. It looked very nice with approx 30 restaurants overlooking the river, so plenty of choices. What we hadn't seen were the 100 approx extra venues that connect to the Quay in side streets. These range from restaurants, to pubs, to night clubs. They are all under roof, so no matter what Singapore's weather is doing you will be dry, even in the alfresco venues. The ambience is great with lots of music playing nearby somewhere. Well worth an evening visit for tourists."
,,"Nightlife, relaxing...the best Vibes!",5.0,,"One of the best places and highly recommended places in Singapore.
everytime we go to Singapore we go to Clarke quay..day and night.
The nightlife in Clarke quay is fantastic! beautiful resturants, music playing, dessert stores ..everything!
It is soo chill and viby to walk around at night and have laughs with friends and family.
Amazing vibe! Definatly go there while in Singapore.!"
,,One of The best place in Singapore!,4.0,,"last time i visited singapore i was in a business trip i stayed there for four month, my singaporean friend told me about this place so i went there! the night clubs and the restaurants in clarke quay is fantastic! I, highly recommended."
,,Good place to stay for travellers,4.0,,"A good place to hang out, chill with friends, stroll with lovers and simply people-watch. A tad too commercialized for my taste though. Food is overpriced and crowds are overwhelming on weekends. I prefer Robertson Quay where there is better food and lesser people."
,,A place to relax!,4.0,,"It was my forth time to Singapore and always go there as it's just so perfect place to relax. City with sky high buildings and this is the only place for me to get the breeze. Foods stalls are available to your taste. If you have family, you can go together with them to chit chat talk while you are sitting by the river. A must place to see in Singapore and I'll definitely will go there again."
,,"Clarke Quay, A Singapore Treasure",5.0,,"There was a time in its rush to development when Singapore indulged in a spree of demolition. Down came the traditional and picturesque shop-houses and colonial buildings and up went the ubiquitous non-descript skyscrapers – temples to mammon and globalisation. Then one morning someone realised that with every scoop of the dumper truck, Singapore’s history and heritage were being discarded.

Who, this person must have reasoned, wants to travel to a small island to look at the same slabs of glass and concrete that can be seen more conveniently at home? For Clarke Quay this was fortunate indeed.

From Singapore’s early days Clarke Quay was a transit hub, connecting the interior with Stamford Raffles original trading post, at the mouth of the Singapore River. For well over a century, until the early 1960’s, it continued in this role, until congestion, pollution and the development of Kepple Harbour sounded its death knell. Inevitably the Quay fell into disuse and dereliction.

Its salvation came in 1977 when the Quay was cleaned up, rebuilt and declared a conservation area: its revitalization began. The shop houses and go-downs along this palm lined river walkway were painted in pastel tints of blues, pinks, and greens, and their window shutters having a striking contrast of bright primary colours. The day I spent at the Quay was perfect; a tropical blue sky was dappled with high fluffy clouds.

Named after Singapore’s second Governor, Clarke Quay attracts a cosmopolitan crowd, from young and trendy to mature and sophisticated, who come to appreciate a lively shopping, and entertainment experience, that also boasts a Saturday flea market.

The bumboats that take tourists along the River revel in unlikely names such as Singapore Explorer and Quay Challenger, taking one of these boats along the River is to travel into Singapore’s past. Then with appetite roaring there is no better way to enjoy a meal than at one of the Quay’s many restaurants and cafes. Of course you will find ‘fusion’ food, but also a range of international cuisine; you can eat your way from Italian pastas and pizzas, through the whole gamut of South East Asian food: Indian, Thai, Malay, Vietnamese. The food hall serves value-for-money-grub and gives an authentic taste of Asian fare that makes little concession to the western palate it is definitely worth a visit.

Al fresco eating stimulates the appetite it rouses the thirst too. No worry, Clarke Quay has a number of pubs that provide something for everyone. Fancy some hip hop while you sip? Try Coco Carib, a pub where you can relax by the river and listen to the sounds of hip hop, reggae and salsa. They also have a limited menu but their mutton or chicken curry is a delicious steal at only eight dollars.

Hooters a little way down the Quay has live music every night, Wednesday is given over to a girls night of Ab Fab proportions; a great watering hole for the young and the young at heart. On the other hand, if it’s a quiet moment that you want as you dream by the gently flowing waters there are a number of other bars that will cater to the more reflective you.

The Cannery is a Victorian warehouse that now houses restaurants, entertainment and shopping malls. The Cannery and the attractive side streets are a bargain hunters playground. Hawaiian shirts, sarongs, ties, shirts and shorts, fancy goods and bric-a-brac all at knock down prices.

Clarke Quay offers the foot weary tourist a great antidote to the hustle and bustle of modern Singapore that is just on its doorstep. Its many bars and restaurants provide a link to the past while viewing the future."
,,Good place to to go at night,4.0,,"Regularly busy and vibrant. Bars always welcoming. Beware that drinks are expensive out of happy hour, 7 til 9 PM on weekdays, not sure on weekends."
,,Torremolinos!!,2.0,,A night time stroll down Clarke Quay and Boat Quay was like braving the beach front in a second division Spanish seaside town. Hassle from every restaurant. Picturesque in the daytime but I wouldn't bother at night.
,,Great food carts!,4.0,,"We stayed locally and found Clarke Quay a great place to cheaply sample the local food. Initially we were going to try the chilli crab at one of the restaurants but once we saw the wonderful selection of food carts opted to eat off them instead. It meant we got to eat a lot of 'samples' and try a bigger selection of cuisine. Steamed dumplings, samosa, chilli crab - it's all there! The only draw back was there was literally nowhere to sit and eat - you have to eat standing up while walking.

The restaurants themselves were nice if you're after a sit-down meal.

It was the mid autumn festival during our stay so the chinese displays were everywhere - colourful and fun, great for photos!"
,,Good eating place,4.0,,Visit this place to have a wide variety of food from different cuisines across the world. I loved the an American pub there which serves fantastic beer.
,,The place to be,5.0,,"There is something for everyone here, not only sight-seeing but food outlets. The Quay has river cruises, walks, shopping, nightlife, it is hub for all ages and families, very clean, safe yet quiet if your hotel is close as our was."
,,Best visited during sunset/ after dusk,4.0,,"A must visit. One of the most beautiful areas of Singapore. Great place for a walk during sunset, and then dinner n drinks. Lots of good restaurants and bars lined up along the river. Most restaurants offer outdoor seating, and have happy hours upto 8pm (good deals on beer).
View pictures for more..."
,,Colourful place at night,5.0,,"We visited Clarke Quay three times during our stay in Singapore for dinner or lunch. It was directly opposite our hotel the Swissotel Merchant Court. Clarke Quay comes alive at night with lots of lights, music and people around the many restaurants and bars. For the best dining experience, grab a table in the outdoor terrace areas overlooking the Singapore River."
,,Not what it used to be ....,3.0,,"I guess it depends what you want, but what used to be an ecclectic mix of bars, eateries and little shopping arcades, is now pretty much exclusively pricey (and largely over priced) trendy bars and restaurants.

It is withine easy wolking distance of Furama City Centre Hotel, where we were staying. I suppose it is still worth one visit while you're in town, however to me it has lost its charm and atmosphere, but if you want somewhere heaving and hectic for a night out, this is the place to be."
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"We walked here from our Hotel and enjoyed the nightlife, lights and people passing by. This place has a real vibe about it at night. Enjoy a Hippo ride on the water and a meal right on the riverbank. Plenty of restaurants to choose from Thai, Indian, Japanese with seafood also in abundance. Was very popular when we were there just before the Grand Prix and many restaurants were fully booked. Watch out for taxi drivers in this area as one tried to rip us off on our return trip back to the Hotel."
,,Has become very touristy... of the bad kind,4.0,,"In my first visit to Clarke quay many years ago it still had the very distant feel of Asia, now it seems to be a strip of bar after bar catering to tourists (of the bad kind) and no longer has that appeal it had many years ago."
,,Take a Boat Ride before you take a walk around,5.0,,"Grab a ticket and go on a 40 or 60 min boat ride of the area and get the commentary on-board. It is a great perspective from which to see this area and a lovely restful way to cope with the humidity. You will see some old and new architecture/bridges/homes/etc.. so a good way to see how the city has evolved. After the boat ride, take a walk around the restaurants and shops. A couple of hours is all you need to keep aside but you will get a better idea of how the locals live and play."
,,Like being at a bar at home,3.0,,"Clarke Quay is a really buzzing hotspot, but there is nothing different about this place than any bar area in the world.

However if you are after a big night, and want nothing more than to bar hop- this place is perfect.

The drinks in singapore are expensive though so be warned, one drink will set you back £10 irrespective of what you are drinking! Though this is not limited to Clarke quay.

The area is covered though which is an advantage especially in areas of such tropical weather.

Beware the area is trawling with ""ladies of the night""..."
,,Mulligans Irish Pub @ Clark Quay Singapore,4.0,,"The band 'Acoustic Trip"" is absolutely great! Tables are big beer barrels, ambient has a nostalgic touch. Great music! Cheers!"
,,Essential for a weekend evening drink!,5.0,,"Clarke Quay (same MRT stop) is a must to go out on a weekend, however it is not cheap; it is a thriving atmosphere with lots of people and lots of entertainment/music- every other bar has something on. It is also home of the ""soon to be famous"" hooters bar.

BBs bar next to the bungee offers a good view of it, but be warned of their changing of pricing; first pint was $16, then the same pint was $20 (no it hadn't changed from happy hour), friends also had a problem with Barman not serving what they asked for and trying to charge for more expensive vodka- keep your receipt to re order the same!

You can work your way down the quay, and most bars have an outside area overlooking the river."
,,Can't go wrong here,4.0,,"Tastefully put together preserving the former warehouses that once were the heart of this area.

Plenty of choice for all food tastes, somewhere to have a drink or dance through the night. Because of the location there is a premium on the prices here so be prepared if on a budget.

Conveniently you can also take a river cruise from here and at reasonable prices."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Fell in love with Clarke Quay. Walking around at night and looking at all the bright lights and quirky bars/restaurants was a great experience.
,,What a great place to spend the night,5.0,,"We arrived early evening and looked for somewhere to eat. There are an amazing amount of choices to pick from and there is something available everywhere along the way.

After dinner we kicked on and visited a few of the bars and found some great drink specials. It was a great way to start of the night."
,,Very cosmopolitan,5.0,,A lovely area in a stunning city offering something for every palette from every country in the world. The atmosphere is fun and relaxed
,,An experience but expensive,4.0,,Clarke Quay was a great experience if a little touristy and v expensive - saying that we visited on two night and ate at two different restaurants and it was lovely just sitting outside and watching the world go by
,,"Boat Ride, good food and great place to enjoy Sunset",4.0,,"From Marina bay we went to Clarke quay by a boat ride. The boat cost around SGD 18 (back and forth) or 12 (one ride) per person. After arrived in Clarke, we then enjoying a Mexican restaurant (sorry, I forgot the name). The frozen margarita was delicious, as well as the chicken enchilada. Great place to enjoying sun set, near the river with good drinks and tasty food. Definitely will come back!"
,,Busy during Grand Prix week,4.0,,"It is a buzzing area at night, and when we were there, they had a Chinese Horoscope celebration. It looked lovely, along with the other buildings all lit up. We ate at Harry's Bar. This was OK, nothing special though. The atmosphere was good fun, but a little busy for us."
,,Quiet during the day. Hectic at night.,4.0,,"This is a beautiful spot in Singapore.
While it may seem like a rather sleepy place during the day, things start to warm up as the sun sets.
Numerous cafes, restaurants, bars and clubs make this a noisy (if even - too hectic) place to hang out in.
During late night (especially on weekends), the place is packed with people - either people coming to party, or people (tourists, mostly), who come to se people partying.
Try it during the day, first. Then come back after 9:00PM to see just how different 9and beautiful) the place looks at night."
,,Hard to find halal food here,4.0,,Only few cafe and restaurant here providing halal food in this place. Sometime if we traveling we also want to try many kind of food that cant be found at our place.
,,People Watch while sinking a cold one,4.0,,"POssibly a bit too sanitised for a nightspot on the river - but still a good evening out to drink beet and people watch and enjoy the lights, water features and acts in the various bars along the waterfront."
,,A Place to chill out,4.0,,"The first thing that pop in to my mind, whenever i get tired from work is Clark quey. its a place where you can chill out and relax together with your friends. A place for great food and great music."
,,Clarke Quay great night out,5.0,,"We did the Hippo river cruise, was great loved the views of Singapore at night and the light show from the rooftops of the high rise buildings.
Zillions of restaurants to choose from but felt like just good old fish and chips, so we brought some at Fremantle fish and chips and they were excellent, really nice fish crunchy batter throughly enjoyed them, and good value for money.
The Quay has a great vibe, look forward to going again next trip."
,,Nice walk,5.0,,"After walking around the concrete jungle of Singapore, this quay is like a bit of fresh air. Water, open spaces, nice contrast of small houses and skyscrappers... Nice setting and great to sit down and watch the boats pass by...."
,,Horrible service,1.0,,"Seems like a nice place until you get stuck at the bar - first ordering (20+ min for what's probably their signature drink - a cuba libre), then getting your change back (another 20+ minutes for no clear reason).

An obvious waste of time when you're trying to have a nice time with your friends."
,,Where the Party is at,5.0,,"Clarke Quay, in simple terms, is where Singapore's best nightlife is.

Better visited at night where everything comes to life, Clarke Quay is bustling with life and colors. The place is surrounded with bars and restaurants for the young and young at heart. It has a very nice ambiance which is a major plus! Food choices offer wide range of cuisine. If you're on the adventurous side, you can try the reverse bungee which is a hit to visitors. The place is flocked by both locals and tourists.

Only an enjoyable experience would one have in Clarke Quay so spend your night (or nights) away here because it'll surely be worth it!"
,,Great Place to Eat,4.0,,We made Clarkes Quay our favourite eating spot during our week in Singapore and ate well at Coffee Connoisseurs a couple of times and Harry's bar on the other side of the river. Only downside was the extraordinary price of wine which took us by surprise but that was so at all restaurants we ate at in Singapore
,,Amazing at night!,5.0,,"Whilst in Singapore we went to Clarke Quay every night. It is so beautiful and colourful with many different restuarants for every cuisine (chinese/japanese/thai/american/irish/persian/italian the lot!) which can be eaten in the center of the quay or next to the river. It was busy with lots of locals and tourists which gave it a great atmosphere. There are a few nightclubs and bars to choose from, and every Wednesday night is ladies night where girls can get free drinks and other really good deals, so dress to impress!"
,,Comes to Life at Night,4.0,,"Clarek Quay is known for the restuarants, bars, river and night ambiance and you certainly feel that. Good to stroll around and see where it leads you, a real pleasant and enjoyable experience."
,,so lovely....so refreshing.....delightful place,5.0,,I fell in love with Clark Quay. I love to go here in the evening because of the refreshing ambiance and the colorful glow of lights. The many fine dining restaurants around make you hungry and sit and eat such delicious foods of different variety and taste. A nice to meet new friends too. I love Clark Quay.
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,There are plenty of hotels and bars to choose from and most of the hotels are crowded as well and don't forget the river cruise by night
,,Sensational,5.0,,Clark quay is one place in Singapore which you cannot miss. Most happening after it gets dark. If you had a tiring day head to Clark quay to have some fun!
,,Great atmosphere,5.0,,Plenty of places to choose from to eat at. Atmosphere in the evenings great. Loved the cocktails at SQue
,,Nice place for a drink,3.0,,"We visited Clarke Quay a couple of times for a drink at one of the bars - wine is very expensive in Singapore, so try to come during happy hour, when you can often get two glasses for the price of one. There are many cafes and restaurants to choose from, it's pleasant to look out over the river, and there's a relaxed if busy ambience.
Clarke Quay is definitely preferable to Boat Quay, which we found full of aggressive touting - a real tourist trap, complete with over-charging (one trick is to offer you free drinks, then up the food bill to compensate...avoid like the plague)."
,,Clarke Quay,5.0,,Great atmosphere...plenty of restaurants and bars. Had lunch and a few beers at the Pump Room. Easy to get to via the Underground. Found a great electronics store nearby. Picked up some bargains. Had a great day.
,,Amazing place.,5.0,,"Great, relaxing place. Lots of restaurants and clubs. And feels very secure. Overall, life to the full."
,,Best selection of eating establishments in one small place,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is like Dr. Jeckel and Mr.Hyde, visit during the day and have a leisurely drink in a quiet atmosphere along with a light lunch or come later in the evening and revel in the liveliness with lots of entertainment from live music in some establishments to watching people do reverse bungy strapped into a steel cage.

Recommended eating / drinking establishments are the Pump Room and the Highlander"
,,Yummy Chilli and Pepper Crab,5.0,,Try the Chilli or Peppered crab at Jumbo Restaurant. It is something to die for! I prefer the Peppered Crab better than the Chilli though. Try also the Ice Cream sandwiched in a bread or biscuit after dining for dessert.
,,Awesome and friendly nightlife.,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a must see at night, the place is party central. Monday nights are very quiet compared to a Wednesday to Sunday and some of the best nightclubs may be shut on Mondays. To eat, drink and party here can be a little expensive but is well worth it IMO but many backpackers make a night of it just sitting on the footbridge socializing and drinking their duty-free liquor. This place parties hard until almost daybreak, so rest up during the day, put on your sexiest outfit and wear your dancing shoes."
,,The Pump Room on Clarke Quay is amazing,5.0,,"We had so much fun with the live band at the Pump Room in Clark Quay, the music was wonderful with a great atmosphere"
,,Lots of restaurants,5.0,,Clarke Quay is a superb evening venue for a wide choice of restaurants. You can also swing through the air if you wish on a specially erected 'crane'!
,,Great place to walk around at night,5.0,,Do you like taking photos? Well Clarke Quay at night is for you!!!
,,Great Evening spot,5.0,,"Little pricey but awesome. Restaurants on the river. river boat cruises, couple other attractions. Lights & reflections off the river. I was there on a Monday night & was told its a slow night but it was buzzing. Cool hip crowd mixed w/ the tourist. Good energy spot. Assortment of restaurants.
Tip = go at night!"
,,A must,5.0,,An evening boat trip at Clarke Quay is a must and experience the light and sound show first hand.
,,Hangout!!,5.0,,"loved the variety of cuisine available.. awesome food.. great place to hang out..good crowd..especially during weekends friday, saturday sunday..a confirmed good time with your friends and family. dont miss to eat the natural made icecreams and shorma rolls"
,,Best place to go at night...,4.0,,If you are in Singapore then it's worth a visit to Clarke and make sure you go at night as it's beautifully lit around that time...i belive it's one of the most happening place in Singapore...You will get a lot of riverside restaurants and bars there and if you wish you could also take a cruise on the Singapore river which runs along Clarke...All in all it made my Saturday night...
,,Great place to spend the evening,5.0,,"Especially at night a colorfull area with lots of restaurants, bars and clubs."
,,Multitude of bars and restaurants,4.0,,If you are in Singapore it is always worth a vist to Clarke Quay. Lots and lots of bars and restaurants to choose from. Nice walk down the riverside and boat trips a plenty.
,,awesome night scenery,4.0,,"You will definitely enjoy the view at Clarke Quay if you go at night. The lights are spectacular. You can even go on a River Cruise that travels along the singapore river (i hope i got the name of the river right). You will appreciate the place more if it's not raining.

To go there, alight at Clarke Quay station (NE line - the purple line). It's just a roughly 2 min walk. If you're just up for the view and have no intentions of drinking or eating, you can spend less than an hour on this place."
,,Singapore Night Life Preview,4.0,,"You want to see how the night life in Singapore is? Visit Clarke Quay! Basically a pedestrian mall situated upstream on the Singapore river housing night clubs and restaurants. You'll find many famous bars/ clubs including The Hooters. It's a mad mad happening place with great bars, live bands and good food. Clarke Quay MRT station is situated beneath the shopping center called ""Central Mall"".

Tips: Avoid Tuesday nights. Wanna have fun? Go on Wednesdays instead. It's the ladies night."
,,DON'T GO TO CUBA LIBRE IN CLARKE QUAY SINGAPORE,1.0,,"Bad service! This evening, had dinner there with friends. First, they kept coming to our table a few times to clean up our plates before we finished our food! Second, they gave us the bill before we finished eating and drinking! I mean, we ordered big meal for dinner and some alcohol drinks. Remain you that food and drinks are bloody expensive here. Why did they keep asking? Kicking us out of the place? We are middle age women and descent and we have good money! I asked them many questions to find out why! Is there time limit for eating and drinking there? Do we have to order more drinks? I dont think we are loud. Anyway, BAD CUBA LIBRE IN CLARKE QUAY SINGAPORE!"
,,Crowd Source,4.0,,"If you like night life, just go here, if you like to see how the youth spend their night, just go here."
,,Great place to visit in the evening,4.0,,"This is a good place to visit late in the evenings. Many restaurants line this place, though most looked pricey.
A 45 minute boat tour of Singapore is a must do. It covers most areas of Singapore and you have a great view of the Marina Bay Sands Singapore, which does a spectacular laser show every? evening."
,,Must see at night,4.0,,"Anyone who visits Singapore should see the city at night, especially Clarke Quay. It is very expensive for a drink or meal so I suggest expore Chinatown first and have a meal there (I had a beautiuful pepper steak stir fry and large beer for about $10.00 AUD) and then walk to Clarke Quay. Clarke Quay has plenty of street entertainment and a great little ferry trip out into the harbour where some great photos can be taken of the sights and lights."
,,So expensive,2.0,,"Went here for a night out, but the price of alcohol was ridiculous, even by European standards! It's nothing to do with local taxes as beer can be purchased for much cheaper in other areas of the city. SG$20 for a bottle is a joke."
,,Great restaurant area (not really shopping),4.0,,Very nice area of restaurants in covered pedestrian mall. Almost every type of food is represented and there are some reasonably priced options. Dead during the day but comes alive at night and much nicer than Boat Quay.
,,All you need is time and money!,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is named in honour of Sir Andrew Clarke, Singapore's second Governor. Located near the mouth of the Singapore River, this place was apparently at the heart of commercial activity during the late 19th century - this is also where Singapore set out on its journey to commercial greatness, some 150 years ago.

In its current avatar however, Clarke Quay has been converted into a mall, a huge retail area and an upmarket food locale especially for al fresco dining and exotic dining options. The place does have a distinctly bohemian ambience in parts, and has also acquired a well deserved reputation as being the hub of Singapore's nightclubs, with prices to match of course! Waterfront warehouses and godowns have been carefully restored to accommodate pubs and restaurants, and if that's your taste, modified Chinese junks offer floating versions of the same.

There is a lot you can do at Clarke Quay depending on the time AND the money you have to spend here...

Hint 1: Clarke Quay is at its best when the sun goes down - so be there after 6pm if you really want to catch the ""buzz"" that makes this place very special. After 6pm on weekends - even better!

Hint 2: Among the best ways to explore the Singapore River is to use the hop on hop off Bumble Bee River taxis available at the quay. Old world trishaws and bumboats are other good options to consider.

Hint 3: If you are in the mood to splurge, Riverside Point offers popular and unique dining options like Brewerkz, Jumbo Seafood Restaurant and Café Iguana. Needless to add, its a most relaxing atmosphere and there's no better way to watch the sun go down than over some great food and wine.

Hint 4: If you want to do something different, do the Royal Selangor Process Demonstration Tour. There is also Royal Selangor's School of Hard Knocks program, where you can discover how to create your own pewter dish. Apparently, you'll even be given a certificate along with your pewter creation.

Hint 5: If you are up to the challenge, and the long queues, go for the G-Max reverse Bungee, an open cradle where you are strapped in and then catapulted to a height of some 200 feet at 200km/hr!

Clarke Quay - where all you need is time and money!"
,,"Pleasant, but expensive",3.0,,"Clarke Quay has many nice spots for eating and drinking, several of which are along the riverside. It is also a very safe area, unlike many other eating and drinking spots around the world. Easily accessible via the MRT (Clarke Quay station). The downside is that it is very expensive to buy a beer and even more so to buy a glass of wine, because of very high local taxes."
,,Serene and entertaining,5.0,,"This riverside area of Singapore is the perfect way to unwind on a busy holiday trip. Its the perfect place to sit and admire the surroundings, or to take a quiet stroll by the riverside. And if you suddenly have the urge to go partying just get into any of the bars/clubs and have a great time. They have even started bungee jumping there, which has a long long line. I would recommend everyone to go their twice during their stay and once during the weekend. Its worth every visit."
,,Well worth a look,4.0,,Great atmosphere and lots of food choices and bars which should mean there is something for everyone. Easy to get to via MRT and with a shopping mall close by.
,,Great Place to Chill at Night,5.0,,"All we can say is this place was lovely. It may be the best place to experience Singapore night life and clubbing. So many restaurants along the riverbank, but pricey though."
,,Asian experience,5.0,,"Loved this area,smells of different food cultures,color,and people relaxed and safe"
,,Geared towards tourists but fun,4.0,,I like walking here at night to people watch. There are some good restaurants but not the best value.
,,Great place to hang out!,4.0,,"With a lot of food choices, variety of late night entertainment. There's a fancy pubs, restaurants, along the river. You can just hang out enjoying the foods while having some nice talk with friends or family. It's like a small version of Venice. Don't miss to try the Turkish Ice Cream! It's so unique experience. There's a GMAX Reverse Bungy around the corner if you dare to feel some thrill!"
,,"'Terrific Atmosphere, Live Musics, gr8 place to spend evening'",4.0,,"Hi,

If you want a live atmoshphere, good food, pubs or just simply want to sit by the river side or wanna to do a bungy jumping....Clarke is the place to be in.

You will hv a memorable evening....best time to visit is after 9-10 pm.
Place is in the heart of the city so commuting is not a problem....however avoid very late at night as getting a taxi may be a problem...advisable to prebook a taxi.

This place is live till 2 am in the morning. If you are in Singapore do not miss this place."
,,MEMORABLE QUAY,5.0,,"What comes on your mind when you heard RIVER?? Water...water and only water...But here, there are so many things to do when you go along side the river. All nice and warm atmosphere and also well known as the old Singapore, you can have many interesting food with cheap price of course and not to mentioned that the boat attraction. When you have your dinner on the boat, they can proudly present you a traditional Chinese songs with the traditional guitar."
,,Love It,4.0,,"I was amazed at the food choices you can find at Clarke Quay. And there's a lot of attractions which are accessible by foot---Victoria Theatre, Asian Civilations Museum, Sir Thomas Raffles monument, Gmax Reverse Bungy, and Esplanade Park and the ice cream carts loaded with durian ice cream sandwiched in either wafers or bread!"
,,Nice place for hanging out,4.0,,"Yes, this is a place where you can find loads of Bars and Nightclubs. I visit on of them, Hooters. Ordered hooters sling. Suprisingly, it was excellent :). The price is okay, but it's hard to find a seat coz all of the tables are packed. So if you want to hang out with your friends (big group) better come earlier to get a seat."
,,Best place to Hang Out,5.0,,We tries Hooters chicken wings which located here. Nice and excellent menu to try. Too many restaurant and good relax atmosphere.
,,Great Restaurants,5.0,,huge variety of restaurants and it turns into a hot spot for night life and clubbing after 11pm on weekends
,,Attractive but expensive tourist trap!,4.0,,Pretty place to visit - but eat in the Food Court at Liang Court - restaurants are quite pricey
,,The place is cool ...,4.0,,"Most of people said this place is mid-high class. But there is turkish ice cream that just $5 each. Taste the ice cream with the view and sit near the bridge. Enjoy it ,,,, cool .... *~*"
,,an pleasant place,5.0,,It's good place for ppl to take a walk or have a meal with family or friends there. U can choose to go to shopping mall or have awesome meal around there.
,,wednesday night is ladies night =),4.0,,"I went here 1st time to watch F1 (2010), and i did all tours like duck tours, sentosa, zoo, birdpark, etc. Now its my 2nd time in SG, just transitting for 1 and half day. I didnt experience the night scene in SG, we decided to discover Clarke Quay.
Luckily, its wed's night, its ladies night, we get a lot of freebies like sling, house pours, if u want to get drunk =), even free entrance to some bars.
Theres a lot of resto to choose from.
If u get kinda late, buses are everywhere, and its safe to walk around SG even in unholy hours."
,,Great spot for an evening meal/drink,5.0,,"Clarke Quay offers a myriad of eateries and bars set against a waterfront, which is lit with an exciting array of colours. Yes it is expensive, especially for backpackers like us, but it is worth it - even if I was shocked to have paid 9 SGD for a standard sized Tiger Beer!!

We only went to Clarke Quay on the last of our three nights - would definitely return in the future."
,,"Don't do the boat cruise, just walk through the promenade",4.0,,"It 's a very enjoyable walk, starting from the marina and going up stream. Lots of places to eat or just chill out, watching the boats cruising the river"
,,A kaleidoscope of colors and light at night.,4.0,,"A place to dine,a place to dance, a place to sing, a place where you can just sit and watch all the light and glamour,music buzzing all night and same time you can feel the calmness of the place.

It is a much wanted and perfect break from a hectic week.For more info :

,,Great place to visit,4.0,,"Mulligans, Microbrewery & 2 places overlooking the river - all great :)"
,,great place to spend the evening,5.0,,great atmosphere. tens of restaurants and bars to chose. or just walk around...we simply loved it.
,,Entertainment and Dining Hub,5.0,,Wow what a night. Plenty of restaraunts and bars situated around a small bay which flows to Marina Bay. Great view of the Marina Bay Hotel at night.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I have been to Singapore many times, but this was my first visit to Clarke Quay. Wow - I can't believe we didn't go here before. There are so many restaurants to choose from and the atmosphere is fantastic."
,,One of my favorites places in Singapore,5.0,,"If you like the night , this is one of the best places to go in Singapore. Lots of bars and resturants. Very nice , really, a must go place. Reverse bumging jump, Beer market, really nice to hang out with friends."
,,Nice But Expensive,3.0,,Nice view of the water but food and drinks are so overpriced it was hard to enjoy it. There are a lot of choices of bars and restaurants for anyone's taste.
,,Not suitable for children,3.0,,"Go at night. Vibrant and fun. Bars and pubs are everywhere. Very good for friends gathering. The beer was reasonable priced but food was expensive. There were lots of stalls selling ornaments and interesting items mainly for youngsters. Few shopping malls at the riverside but we did not check it out. However, this place was noisy and crowded. Not suitable for young children and old adults as well. But, the riverside was breathtaking. To me, there was nothing special about the boat ride."
,,Night Out at Clarke Quay,5.0,,"Our fav spot at Clarke Quay is the MicroBrewery 'Pump Room'.
They brew their own beer and after 10.30pm the resident band 'Jive Talking' plays
popular covers from the 70's, 80's, 90' and today.
It's gets very busy on fridays and saturdays along with a long queue, so it's best to go on a wednesday or thursday."
,,Party time!!,4.0,,"Nice place with great dining options. Hawker street is close by and you get a great choice of crab there and other seafood.
Turns into a party atmosphere as the sun goes down with the many pubs and night clubs in the area pumping up their music. Travelling to and from no issue at all, you can use the MRT during the day and simply hire a taxi after a night of hard partying :)"
,,Place only for Grown Ups,4.0,,"If you are with children do not visit this place after Nine in the Evening.
As we were a couple we enjoyed a lot.
At times the Crowd is very Rowdy but overall it is a typically nightout place.
Experience is good if you are fed up of the everyday boring routine of Office.
Situated by the side of the lake and with young people around having drinks and enjoying music you feel like you are out of the world.
Do visit the place if you are in Singapore."
,,Love the scene!,5.0,,Walking along clarke quay and the river gave me a breathe of fresh air. The stroll was worth it and we end upt taking lots of pictures and eating a $1.20 ice cream!!!
,,OKI DOKI OKKK!,4.0,,"Actually im arrived and chilled out earlier, my friend said this place such the most happening place to chill out in Singapore. I found many older expatriates ummm.. such aint fabulous view actually. So after walked around my fams&I prefer one of cafe in center of Clarke Quay it located besides the fountain with the fancy light, awesome! it was definitely brought cozy atmosphere. Im tryed their special beer it was tasted good bit sweety but nice tasted! The price are quite expensive but if you come before 5 pm you’re gonna get happy hour prices. Clarke Quay offering many clubs,cafe&lounge with differences interior. It was pretty cool! it will be more excite if you go with your mates or friends than your parents. And I highly recommend you to prefer the cafe closer with singapore river because the view looks more beautifull at night."
,,"For some, but not others",3.0,,"Clarke Quay in the early morning is a fairly pleasant place to walk alongside the river, with the Asian Civilisation Museum visible and Marina Bay in the distance. However, once the restauranteurs wake up, you can't go more than 5 paces without somebody asking whether you want something to eat or not. You could be tooling down there with a sandwich hanging out of your mouth and they'd still try to entice you in for a meal.

The centre of Clarke Quay is a covered over collection of bars, rather like an alcoholic's idea of a mall. Come the evening it's packed full of bright young things. If you're young and/or dumb, that may be great, but I have a feeling that as you get older, you'll tire of exorbitant drink prices, not particularly friendly service, and crowds of people bumping up against you.

On the other hand, it's where everyone thinks everyone drinks, and while I hate to help to perpetuate a self-perpetuating myth, if you want to be around a crowd of tourists and have (too much) booze, Clarke Quay is probably the place for you."
,,very overpriced for drinking and dinning,4.0,,lots of people. make sure you do the night river boat cruise from the far side of the quay good local experience
,,Expensive and for youngsters,3.0,,Quayside restaurants are expensive. Comes alive at night.
,,Interesting mall with even more interesting architecture,4.0,,"Went there with colleagues to have a beer. Ended up in an British pub and paid $15 for each beer. Remember, this is Singapore. The place is your typical modern city outdoor city mall with shops, restaurants and bars. Very busy and you will find the usual things you find in any international mall. Several good restaurants in the area and you can entertain yourself window shopping while you are there, checking the boats and people-watching. The most striking feature are the famous canopy holders. Check the photographs as they are self-explanatory. The question is: was it on purpose or just they did not notice? A funny conversational piece, if you pardon the pun.
Anyway, if you are in Singapore you should visit."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"So many places to eat and drink, you would never tire of looking for somewhere different to eat every night of the week, would recommend to everyone, well worth a visit."
,,Night life very good with music,5.0,,"Very nice place to go y night, very good restaurants, bars, alive music. We went to the river and made a sigthseeng by boat very nice !! We went there two nigths and for me it was the best place to go in Singapore by nigth."
,,a taste of the old,4.0,,"Very impressed with this area very clean and a sense of secruity where ever we went but all over the area you get the impression of things are not cheap ,now when i say cheap i dont expect everything for nothing and let me say this trip to Singapore and Hong Kong did not cost us a $ because it was part of an inheritence ,but to the average person on a holiday you like to get value for your money and i cant see it in Singapore"
,,Accessible and very entertaining,4.0,,"We loved this place as it was smack at the MRT station and bustling with people. Everybody shoud try sitting by the Singapore River with a bottle of Heiniken and a couple of buddies - it is really, really great. Bonus: it is free."
,,One of the bests in Asia,5.0,,"You'll be delighted by atmospher of Clarke Quay, lot's of pubs, bars and clubs. We went to Aqua Nova which was great, a band including 8 artists where performing! Very well just covering greatest hits of Rock & R&B, but there was no food or good snack to order."
,,The Area To Stay,5.0,,Visiting Singapore and want to be in the middle of the action and nightlife ..then Clarke Quay ..in my opinion is the area to be ..we stayed at the Merchant Court but also in the same area is the Novotel ..The Park and others..lots of eateries and bars that go into the early hours of the monring...once the sun goes down Clarke Quay come to life
,,Clark Quay,5.0,,"Great atmosphere, looks like this place never sleeps..."
,,Chav city!,2.0,,"We were really looking forward to going back to Clarke Quay as it had been 12 years since our last visit and we loved it then. But what a dissapointment! It is now nothing more than a rowdy, tacky tourist trap that has lost all it's charm and individualism it once had. It's horrible and doesn't do Singapore justice - it's been ruined and we'll never go back. horrid!!"
,,If you don`t know what to eat where to eat go there =),4.0,,An area where you can find lots of restaurants and bars. Most of them are overpriced since the area is touristic. I advice you to pick a place along the water and enjoy the evening in a chilling atmosphere. You can find calmer restaurants if you walk away from the center of it. We had great dinner in an italian restaurant. It was pricey but worth it.
,,Crowded zombieland,3.0,,"Mostly crowded with expats and tourists. Many bars and restaurants of the generic type. Clarke Quay seems to be popular because there are few other social places to go in small Singapore, outside of the malls, food courts and the integrated resorts. I am told that the place is popular with teenagers and other youngsters, but we are well past that age. Brewerks, a bar, and Cafe Iguana (Mexican food) are good casual places for families."
,,"LIke a big, expensive mall food court on the water",3.0,,"This place reninds me of either Vegas (not in the most flattering ways) or the food court at the local mall..... Lots of different dining options - which makes it easy to visit with a group. And lots of bars a few feet from one another, which makes barhopping easy.

However this place has no soul whatsoever. The restaurants and bars have themes (look - the Bollywood bar! The South American steakhouse! The Russian bar! Taces! Hooters!) but are about as authentic as a facade in Vegas.

Nothing objectionable (except the prices) but this isn't my cup of tea. After 6 days in China one of my coworkers was delighted to eat somewhere without any fear of winding up with 'unusual' foods on her plate, so if that leaves you nodding your head this could be for you.

All things being equal I would give it a miss."
,,best place to enjoy night life,5.0,,"well..... i simply dont have words to describe my experience of going to this wonderful place..... must say that this place is fullof life at the middle of the night .......

visit this place for the best eateries in Singapore.....

a must go place esp during the weekends :)"
,,Lovely relaxing place by the water!! But very expensive!!!,5.0,,I loved the area but it was so expensive!! Much more than other places!! It is a reAlly nice are with lots of cool bars and restUrants!! I went to an Indian restaurant on the riverfront which was gorgeous! Great place to have a nice bottle of wine some good food and look out over the water!! It is expensive but worth it :) gorgeous views and great vibe about the place!! :)
,,Too touristy for me,2.0,,"I really didn't like Clarke Quay. It was way too touristy. Full of chain restaurants and western food. Why bother going to Asia if that's what you want to experience. If you are into bars, bland expensive food and nightclubbing this is the place for you."
,,A must!!,5.0,,Clarke Quay is a must for ambience and choice of restaurants. They have everything there - even a Hooters!!!! There is music being played everywhere and restaurants catering to all cuisines. Highly recommend a stop here for a great night out.
,,cool place to hangout with friends,5.0,,"get late there so you can feel the pulse of singapore night life .....
excellent place to have a drink and go pub hopping with live music playing and dancing going on , its a must visit place .in particullay i like cuban club with salsa dance going on . its just at the entrance .
Itt has number of spas as well , thou never tried one ."
,,Beautiful night view,4.0,,"Beautiful night view, too bad it was raining when we got here so we did not manage to take many photos. There are a lot of bars and restaurants along the riverside where you can sit down and enjoy the view."
,,Drink and Feel!,5.0,,"I spent my last night in Singapore by visiting Clarke Quay. Its easy-to-reach-location gives you an access to go here anytime, it takes only about 15 minutes by MRT from my hotel in Kallang. Best time to spend your time here is of course at night. I spent a day going to Orchard before I decided to enjoy the rest of the day at Clarke Quay. You can easily find my restaurants, wine bars, entertainment spots or retail shops here. I took a glass of cold cointreau at one of the bars there (it was 17 SGD/glass). The price of foods and beverages vary widely, depends on the place. But don't worry, there is also some special offers, if you're lucky enough. Note that, this is a heaven of drinks. Many types of beer, wine, and liquor are here.
Somehow Clarke Quay has become an icon in Singapore. Many workers or even tourists spend their rest of the day here, eat, drink, and feel the atmosphere."
,,Popular Night Spot,4.0,,Some good bars to attend. Seemed to be heavily populated with tourists but a good place to have a drink on one night of a stay in Singapore
,,Amazing innovative attractions,5.0,,It is great to visit ans have yiur dinner and nightlife there especially when it comes to restaurant and bars. Dont miss it while you are in singapore
,,BRILLIANT,5.0,,"The boat ride is some experience, the visuals r beautiful at night.There are a lot of quality food outlets at Clarke Quay.I had Chinese food and it was delicious.Highly recommended!!"
,,Night Life!,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is a great location to meet friends and party! With themed bars on every corner, you are sure to find your fit. We favor Shiraz Persian Cuisine due to their great staff, perfect mojitos, and hookas! Sit outside to see the professional belly dancers perform every hour."
,,Perfect for young people,4.0,,Very pretty at night. Lots of restaurants & nightclubs. Filled with lots of young adults having fun. Not so much fun for people looking for local color. Struck me as being a very tourist-y spot.
,,Clark Quay : emotionally bonded to !,5.0,,"I first visited Clark Quay as a surprise birthday location for my grand niece on the 31st of July, 2006. Found the experience almost totally out of the world. Next visit was on my own birthday (with slightly enlarged family) in October, 2009, and the latest being the current one when I spent almost 4 hours photographing Clarke Quay (and the surrounding area) from morning (almost deserted) till late in the night. And, it was the first time ever that are filled two 32 Gb memory cards in a single day !

We of course had a gala dinner at 'Ivory The Indian Kitchen' - facing the Singapore River with a gorgeous view of Clarke Quay. All in all some premium time at Clarke Quay ... a place I feel emotionally bonded to ever since I visited it with my family way back on that wonderful BIRTHDAY July, 2006."
,,Two Thumbs up,4.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore make sure you visit Clarke Quay and do the boat ride. Make sure you do it at night. Sit on the right hand side of the boat to get a better view.

After the ride take a nice stroll along the banks where there are thousands of dining options for you to have nice quiet dinner.

Very good location :)"
,,awesome at nite,4.0,,"the place is rite where u want it to be, after a stroll at marina bay, reach this place across the river, it has a grouopof activities at it, some gravity capsule, which is kinda expensive, but worhty iof a try. i prefered to do it at genting highlands. good eatries along the path"
,,"Lots of restaurants, bars, pubs",4.0,,"Clarke Quay = Party town after 5p. Lots of restaurants, bars, pubs, clubs...it's always busy and filled with locals and visitors"
,,"A change of pace - slow by day, quick by night.... Clarke Quay",3.0,,A visit to Clarke Quay is definitely worth it for a look at this well known eating and drinking destination. During the day you can have a good look at the architecture and sights of the area - its quiet and there is hardly anyone around. At night - its busy with a range of food and drink areas in and around Clarke Quay itself. If we had more time we would have caught a water taxi/ferry down to the Marina Bay area from the pier at Clarke Quay. Go and have a look.
,,Very nice place,5.0,,It is a vibrant place. real good for nite-life and bar hoppers. Families should also come ghere to see the buzz.. Shiraz is a great but very expensive to eat. Dont eat Munchos-mexican restaurant-the service ver very poor and food is average.
,,A trip to Singapore cannot be complete without dining here,4.0,,We had dinner as a part of a night tour package we had booked. They made us dine at one of the upscale seafood restaurants in Clarke facing the bay area. The place is really apt for seafood lovers as the crab meat and fish served to us were amazing! It maybe worthwhile spending your time around the area and having a walk.
,,wonderful & exciting!,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is brilliant! loads & loads of nice restaurants ( all be it a little expensive) but it is a tourist area so this is expected! great atmosphere, wide range of bars, from Irish, Scottish, Mongolian to the odd CLINIC BAR! HAHA this place is funny, it basically has gold wheel chairs for its seats and you can have drinks that come in a ""drip"" bag! its is a gimmicky place but fun to see! Hooters is also on Clarke Quay and there are alot of nightclubs too which dont get going till at least 12am! it is very busy but also a very safe place to bring your children and everyone can enjoy it."
,,Excellent Variety of Restuarant's in a great location,5.0,,"Stayed at the Swissotel and our room overlooked Clarke Quay. Great choice of restuarant's offering a variety of food form different countries. Ate there on 4 occassions during our 8 days stay. Take a bumboat ride on the river at night and see all the lights and sights along the river bank. Great area to stay as it is close to many attraction also. We were there during Halloween , it really comes alive on Friday and Saturday nights and is quieter on week night. Well worth a visit if just for the light and brightly painted buildings."
,,Clarke Quay is Amazing,5.0,,"THis has to be the most vibrant and buzzing square in Singapore for the night life lovers. SO many places to eat, so many pubs to vist. Its like u need come back every night to try all places. Amazing feel and mood of the crowd. Frequented by a lot of youngsters. Feels like so London some times. I remember visting Hooters and Red Dot for freshly brewed beers"
,,Love this place,4.0,,"It might be uncommon but I still prefer this place compare to Orchard Road, Sentosa Island or Marina. The best thing about Singapore is, it is very clean and organized, but somehow I feel it is too ""cold"", including the people. This place seemed has more 'lively', diverse and warm aura in my opinion."
,,Key to the night life,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is named after Sir Andrew Clarke, Singapore's second Governor. Clarke Quay is also the name of a road along the quay, part of which has since been converted into a pedestrian mall.

Clarke Quay was the centre of commerce during the late 19th century. Today, Clarke Quay is still buzzing with life and activity. It is now five blocks of restored warehouses that has various restaurants, nightclubs, with hotels and shopping malls in its vicinity. Along the river are moored boats that carry tourists, tonnkangs a few that have been used a refurbished pubs.

River cruises and river taxis on the Singapore River can be accessed from Clarke Quay. Clarke Quay MRT Station is located nearby allowing tourists easy access by subway trains.

It is busy but subdued during the daytime. A good time to walk, take some pictures, get your bearing and have an ice cream or a light snack. In the evening it is bustling, there is some sort of light show, entertainers here and there, the food is expensive, if you are counting the pennies drop into the food courts in the nearby malls."
,,Spoilt for choice when dining....but expensive,4.0,,"We caught the MRT to Clarke Quay and it was only a short walk to this restored and revamped warehouse area.
The plethora of riverside dining/night club establishments comes into its own in the evening although it is a beautiful area to stroll along day and night.

We dined in a little restaurant closer to the river as it was out in the open.
It was a magical evening and the neon lights gave the water an eerie atmosphere. However as with most of Singapore’s fine dining restaurants, dining is expensive.

Next time we may just bring some take away, cross the bridge and watch the action from the other side.
There is always something going on along the river and every so often we saw an old 'bumboat' with tourists snapping away with their cameras.

Enjoy your visit!"
,,Brilliant spot to spend an evening,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is a brilliant night spot. Dozens of waterfront restaurants to choose from, bars, markets, nightspots. It's just great on a warm evening to stroll through and find somewhere snazzy for a pre-dinner drink before choosing somewhere to dine. My partner and I loved it and will visit again for sure."
,,Expensive but worth it!!,5.0,,"We went here several times on our trip to Singapore. During the F1 week it was busy every night but afterwards it became quieter on a weeknight. It's a must-do on a weekend!! Lot's of entertainment, great food and a buzzing atmosphere! The drinks are a little expensive (especially at the clinic bar) but it is well worth it."
,,Lovely location,5.0,,"After a long day, we decided not to go into a restaurant for a sit down meal. We ended up with takeaway from McDonald's, but ate sitting on the nearby steps leading to the water as the sun went down. A thoroughly pleasant evening in ideal surroundings."
,,The place to be and goes off everynight I believe,4.0,,"We went there on a tuesday night to go to Jumbo Seafood for dinner. After that we walked around clark quay and wow theres alot of people and most if not all the bars were open and each place their own type of music and you could just see and feel the livelihood of the place.

Its amazing that there was alot opened and alot of people still out and this was a tuesday night! i can't imagine how more lively it would be if it was on a weekend but was glad we managed to pass clark quay during our stay in singapore.

Certainly if we had another night, we'd try and stay at clark quay a little bit longer but all good. If your in singapore and want to hit the town any time of the week, come here for dinner and hang ten with the locals/tourists! :)"
,,Enjoy the night out,5.0,,"Singapore is a small place but in this small place u need to check out Clarke Quay~~~ this is the foreigners hangout and also where Singapore who want to socialize with foreigners :)

Clarke Quay is a place where u chill out with the guys or your girlfriend for a good night out with music, dance, shopping and yes a lot of tiger beer :)"
,,Cool place to be with friends!,4.0,,"This is a must-see place when you are with friends. It's hip and trendy. It's probably best to go here during night-time so that you'll see the colorful lights of the place. There are a lot of good places to eat and drink here, from Persian to American to Italian and Singaporean. Just a warning though, the prices are somewhat steep, especially for budget travelers. We went here during a weekday, and the place was full of expatriates having drinks. It was fun to roam around here half-drunk and to people-watch."
,,Great area for a night out.,4.0,,"Can't fault plenty of choice if you like seafood.All age groups very safe and family friendly. Maybe the goverment of Perth should take a look at how the river front can be used,and maybe the transport system to."
,,"Romantic, trendy, enjoyable",5.0,,"I've been here once before and did not regret going a second time. The atmosphere is very lively, and gives you a feel of festiveness. You feel like a tourist, even if you are local :)

Only annoying thing is the restaurant waiters keep shoving the menus in your face as you walk along the restaurants searching for a place to eat. But it's a must visit for Singapore. Excellent view. You can also go on a boat ride, which is very nice too. Must go!"
,,wonderful,5.0,,"very nice place full of restaurants of different cultures Turkish, Iranian, US, English, Far East"
,,We love the colorful Lights of this Place,4.0,,"To go here, the most comfortable way is riding the MRT. Nearest MRT Station is a Station 'Clarke Quay'. You will arrive at a Shopping Mall, get the Exit way and have a little walk to go to Calrke Quay (maybe you will need a little direction from a security duty there). Clarke Quay is the most cool to be visited at 6 pm upwards. because in its Singapore sunset at around 7.30pm, so the sparkling lights could be more cool if seen when the day was getting dark.

Clarke Quay is a collection of dozens of cafes and restaurant (especially the Seafood & pasta), star Hotel, Shopping Malls, Office, etc. They are packed with colorful unique buildings. Here we can also take Water Taxi.

Sign in Clarke Quay itself if just going for a walk, is free. Unless you want to try hanging out in one of the cafe / restayrant. IYou can get your Turkish Ice Cream come with a magic attraction too here. One horn ice cream cost S$5."
,,Quite a 'happening' place,4.0,,"This area is great for a walk, especially by the river after sundown. Lively place, and a special market on weekends by the river. Good area to stay in too."
,,enjoy ur nightlife here,4.0,,it's colorful n relaxing nightspot there're serveral bars here
,,Let's experience wonderful nightlife here,5.0,,"We found this a wonderful place to enjoy singapore's nightlife. Coming here and you'll see how much colorful the night it is. From Marina Bay, you can make a stroll through stores all of kinds. The Clinic Bar is our favorite stop during the tour in Singapore, although it's quite expensive. however, I believe it's value for money."
,,A happening place,5.0,,"This is one of the happening evening and nightspots in Singapore. Be there by 8.00 and one can experience the crowd building up as the night progresses. The place is known for shopping, nightlife and dining options.
Good place for an evening stroll. Some of the restaurants are located on the banks of the river. Had a good meal at one of the joints here.
Something worth going is the nightclub, Zirca. Cover charge is S$16 till 11.00 pm and S$30 thereafter. The crowd starts building up post midnight and lasts till wee hours. Most of the crowd is young and college-going. Music is loud, apt for the crowd and overall atmosphere electric. The place looks safe even for single females.
Overall good night-out option"
,,A nice way to spend the evening in Singapore,4.0,,"We enjoy visiting Clark Quay when in Singapore. Its colorful, relaxing and has lots of restaurants and bars to choose from. Its a very nice way to spend a few evening hours on the water.

You can see the Marina Bay light show from Clark Quay and some adventurous tourist trying some crazy bungee activities, you can also stroll down the river towards Boat Quay and onwards to Marina Bay (20-30 minutes walk).

We recommend stopping by Clark Quay for at least 1 dinner and evening out on a trip to Singapore."
,,Don’t miss this area,4.0,,We spend one night over there and there’re several bars and some nice restaurants to go. We went to the Clinic Bar and it was a little expensive but worth it :)
,,Top Hot Spot for Dinner/ Walk/ Drink/ Simple Shopping at Night,5.0,,"Its a very live spot to spend some time at Night, amazingly enjoyable whether for a walk, dinner or drink.
Some Restaurants are overlooking the river..
Really enjoyed dinner at the Hot Stones restaurant; great experience & delicious food.
Also having a cup of coffee at a cute lil cafe overlooking the river is totally charming...

A must"
,,The location for food & drinks at night in Singapore,4.0,,You will meet locals and tourists from all over the world at Clarke Quay. I realized that they have added a shopping mall. Jumbo seafood is crowded as always but there are other good options at Clarke Quay. Just check it out. And if you need to grap a cab few minutes before midnight is not a good time since there is a huge queue! Try 30 min after midnight for better chances - but a surcharge apply.
,,A fine addition to an already great city to visit,4.0,,"Clark Quay is just a very pleasant place to visit in the heart of Singapore. There are many restaurant and bar options on both sides of the river and decent shopping and covered areas if you feel the urge to duck inside for some air conditioning or to avoid the rain. You can see the Marina Bay light show from Clark Quay now which is ok.

It seems that lunch time and happy hour prices are still significantly lower than in the evening, as we discovered this past weekend (no different than in recent years past).

We recommend stopping by Clark Quay at least once during a trip to Singapore. Its a nice evening out."
,,singapore at night,4.0,,"CQ is the place to be at night...........esp on the weekend....
weekdays may be quiet but weekend is difficult to walk around........

Visited Bar called Shanghai Dolly with my Chinese Colleague......
pity I couldnt understand a word being sung (Chinese tracks), the place was still electrifying with energy and vigour.....
Eventually,the DJ played some English music which was rocking and everyone seemed to join in the fun, singing and party......neat place...do try

Clinic is another cool hangount where the set-up is that of a hospital----wheel chairs, injections, medical chairs, gloves and the works......was packed so couldnt saty too long as started getting claustrophobic, even outside Clinic....

Alot of other good Bar and Pubs to check out in the are, as well as G-Max Bungee.....didnt have it in me to do it....will do though one day...

CQ is absolutely the best, most energetic place to be on a weekend in Singapore...dont miss it !!"
,,I love Tomo Izakaya@Clarke Quay,4.0,,"Tomo izakaya is a Japanese casual dining restaurant in clarke quay. Worth of Value. During 5pm tp 7pm, they offer buy 1 get 1 free sapporo beer promotion. I also found out that they do offer $15 nett bento box during lunch time..but i missed it.=="""
,,Friendly place,5.0,,"It has everything. It had a lot of restaurants and bars. At night, it is very romantic and very nice. People were really nice and friendly. This is good place for young people and couple."
,,one of the best place to hangout with friends,4.0,,"This place is flooded with Bars and it has a roof. More importantly, you're allow to smoke in the ""open air"" indoor area, which I believe is the only place in the city where one can drink while having a smoke legally.

the place is big and spacious, clean and attractive looking too. Bars and Pubs in different themes are located in the boardwalk. It is excellent to come here and enjoy a drink after a long day of travel in the city.

Access: MRT Clarke Quay Station"
,,Lovely and frienly place,5.0,,"Clarke's Quay is a lovely spot on the Singapore River where has bunch of restaurants and bars surrounded it. You can easily find every type of food you want to Chinese, Indian, and Italian and so on. It is extremely lovely in the night time."
,,Clarke Quay -- Great Place to spend the evening in Singapore,5.0,,"Now this is one place we were sure going to miss, if not for a last minute change of plans.

I was feeling down a bit ( tired with the running around of last 2 - days)--

We ( me, my wife kaumudi and son Arastoo) had been busy catching up with the major attractions, going to the major shopping areas .. like Mustafa and the Siam Lin Square - - - more about them in another post.

So where was I ? Aaah !! I was talking about my/our weariness ( kaumudi insists that we alll were tired, not only me) and the fact that we were all set to start packing for the next days departure ( early morning, never liked the early get ups and flight catching) . We had nothing special to do .. so we thought why not take our son Arastoo on the Metro Ride of Singapore.. we have not travelled on Delhi Metro.. so wanted to catch the btter option -- Singapore Metro..

So the metro it was.. and when we asked wich staation to go to .. somebody suggestd we try the station near Clarke Quay..

Bless the man..We did as advised and got near Clarqe Quay.. the sight enticed us..

The boats on the river always attract us and like bee to a flower we made our way for boarding a cruise on the river.. a different experience...

When the lights came out, on the onset of darkness, the place became lively..

One should learn from the Singaporeans how to market the little things they have.. how to beautify and package things to make them tourist spots..

The river was lined with restraunts of different types., there were benches to rest and see the people and the river go by..

There was an Turkish Ice cream man who was serving Ice cream cones with the flourish and mannerisms of a magician.. it was not so much the ice cream but the magical way of serving it made him and his stall a great attraction ..

Sitting there one feels rested and rejuvenated ..I f one has tie, one should take a seatin one of those bars with seats just on the river sid.. enjoy the drinks, food and and relax.. aaah... the very thought is soothing"
,,"Clark Quay, Singapore",5.0,,"A place where Singapore River flows. Having numerous category of restaurants, cafe, pubs and shopping, you will find one that suits you. Alfresco dinning is also one of the highlights of Clark Quay. Comes evening, you will feel the vibrant side of Clark Quay. To add on to the exclusive experience, hop on to the Singapore River Cruise where you can experience the Heart Beat of the River."
,,Lacking nothing,5.0,,"I was in Singapore for business. I was one of few Americans, as most tourists/business people are from Europe, but I didn't feel treated any differently. Clarke Quay was the highlight of my time there. Shopping, food, nightlife. It has everything. High end retail stores to decent prices stores. Awesome pedicures. Everyone was extremely nice. As an American - I had to prepare myself for alcohol and cigarette sticker shock. I don't smoke so I saved on that - but I enjoy an adult beverage on occasion. Be prepared to spend upwards of $20 - $25 for ONE drink. I understood the reasons behind the cost, so I gladly paid for it. It is the cleanest and safest country I've ever been to and I will make it back there one day for vacation. I LOVE IT!"
,,A Singapore highlight!,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is an entertainment, dining and nightlife focal point in Singapore.

It is on the river, and you can do a Bumboat river tour, which is an interesting and inexpensive way to see the sights in a leisurely fashion.

There are a large number of restaurants and bars. I recommend Brewerkz, which is a microbrewery and steak place. You can sit outside (shaded) and watch the world go by, while munching on the largest hamburger you've seen!

No mattter what your taste, you're likely to find somewhere which will cater to your taste in food!

In the evening, Clarke Quay transforms into a vibrant area bustling with people- there's a great atmosphere.

Highly recommended"
,,CQ is the place for Entertainment,4.0,,"Clarke Quay (CQ) had come a long way since I first visited more than 10 years ago. Before then it was not very developed and only with a hawker center. The transformation to become the happening place in Singapore sure made CQ the must visit place, esp. at night for dinner, drinks and fun activities for all ages.
We stayed at nearby hotel(the Park hotel, see separate review) on new year's eve and we were not disappointed with the festivities at CQ that night. There were bands, carnival parties roaming all corridors and boy, it was packed with humanities. As residents of USA, we were not used to such closed human contacts. But hey, it was party time so everyone had a good time.
The ambience maybe a bit artificial, with all that neon lights on the river bank and trees, and gimmicky restaurants like The Clinic. The food/drinks prices maybe quite high. You can even say that CQ was designed like a theme park tailored to tourists. But heck, it's quite unique in its own way. Overall, CQ experience was enjoyable and quite memorable."
,,Worth Visiting,3.0,,"My friend and I went to have dinner at one of the Japanese Restaurant, Tomo Izakaya. The first restaurant that you will see after you've crossed the bridge. We ate California Maki (sgd 10), potato salad (sgd 8), soft shell crab temaki (sgd 6), tempura udon (sgd 12), yaki arabiki sausage (sgd 8) and 2 green teas (sg 4). Total were sgd 50.85 for two. It was awesome! Also we have visited The Clinic. We had 2 bottles of hoegaarden for sgd 30."
,,Very romantic and trendy!,4.0,,"Clarke Quay is a must visit in Singapore. There are endless restuarants and bars, each with a different cuisine or theme.

At night, it is very romantic and ideal for a secluded dinner for two, followed by a couple of cocktails.

I'd recommend going on one of the boat cruises available in the canal - The take you up the river, pointing out some of the important and interesting sights."
,,Great food and atmosphere,5.0,,"We stayed at the Novotel so we ended up eating somewhere different in Clarke Quay every night. Everywhere was excellent. A great atmopshere, we had great service everwhere, particularly the Malaysian restaurant. We really enjoyed wondering around Clarke Quay and would definitely recommend a visit."
,,"Pleasant evenings at Clark Quay,beware of taxi rides",5.0,,"We were charmed by the nightlife as well as the serenity of simply sitting at the stairs by the canal. Very romantic. Watch exciting bungee ride nearby. if you dont feel like going for a full meal, go to Subway at Central Shopping mall ground floor $ 3.9 for a sub. Transportation to and from this area is easy as plenty of buses ply on this route.
Beware of taxi cabs as they charge an exorbitant amount while on-baording from the area known as CBD.
Dont forget your camera as you will take some memorable photos !"
,,Must See in Singapore,5.0,,"Clarke Quay is paradise in Singapore, whether you want to spend your evening at an expensive bar or resteraunt, or simply take a walk around the beautiful masterpiece.
There is a wide variety to select from for an experience - Indian Resteraunt RAS offers delicious indian food, Hooters - women don't rollerblade - and yet its packed, crazy elephant, fbar, Noir, shiraz- with its grandeur and belly dancer, there is plenty on offer and is definately a must visit.
Its a place you can take your family to, nothing to be embarassed by at all.
I didn't take a cruise down the Quay. but its very recommended.
Its expensive but on a special night its definately worth every buck.
theres also extreme entertainment and adventure in the form of the ""Reverse Bunjee"" and ""Extreme Swing"" which is again a must do for the adrenalin seekers, they even offer to take a video of your experience for a good package deal!
Its simply fantastic - get to it and enjoy :)
Its obvously a destination to visit by night!"
,,A must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Wanna see the nite life of Singapore...then Clarke Quay is the place to visit.. Pubs, Disc and great music Also, another attraction of Clarke Quay is the Reverse Bungy Jump and Extreme Swing.. great rides"
,,Hot Nightspot,4.0,,"Clarke's Quay is easily accessible by taxi or MRT. It is a lovely spot on the Singapore river, that has a TON of restaurants and bars. You can find literally every type of food you wish...Cuban, Indian, Italian, American, Tapas, Mongol etc. It is quite lovely in the evening, and bumping at night with lots of clubs. Hooters is packed almost nightly. You can also catch the Bumboat tours from here, as well as try the reverse Bungy or Xtreme swing. Fun place to get a meal or spend a Friday Night."
