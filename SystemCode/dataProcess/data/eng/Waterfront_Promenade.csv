,,"Stunning, Vibrant Waterfront",5.0,,"Singapore’s Waterfront Promenade, magnificent architecture, stunning Marina Bay Sands hotel and shopping arena dominates Marina Bay; the Waterfront Promenade is a 3.5 kilometre stretch that loops around it. Vibrant Marina Bay comes alive spectacularly at night, bathed in multicolour lights from various attractions. Water & laser show is regularly shown in the evenings at Marina Bay waterfront promenade. I have gait/walking challenges (stroke), all sightseeing has to be well-researched and not overly taxing; I wear a legbrace. Easy walking; sensational area."

,,Stunning area for shops and entertainment,5.0,,"We arrived during day light and were amazed by the architecture, the shops and the bay. As night fell we found a bar where we could enjoy a meal and watch the colorful light on water show. We decided to head back to our hotel as an event at the convention centre finished. The style in Singapore is seriously smart but this would have outshone the Oscars and was more Princess Margaret at the Debutante`s Ball. Well done ladies (and gents)"
,,Marina Bay Singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay and Waterfront is flanked by great architecture and the best people watching. We were there for Week of New Years Eve 2018. The area was so crowded we only saw part of the fireworks (if you go get there early in day for a place to view) Next night we watched the free light and water show. Spectacular! Not to be missed.
The helix bridge makes great photographs as it changes colors at night!
We did not visit the ART Science Museum.
The food was expensive (everything in Singapore is expensive) but everything we ate was great!"
,,Yet another highlight,5.0,,"Lovely place to walk, sit & people watch - far better at night, the city seems to come alive and its a little cooler as well, caught the end of the light show which looked stunning, we didn't have time to return but would have liked to see the whole show."
,,Lovely place to take a evening stroll !,5.0,,"The Waterfront promenade, as its name would suggest, is a 3-4 kms along the bay walkway near Marina bay area. The promenade is beautifully designed with an environment friendly recreation area. There are several mist sprays to relieve tourists and visitors from the extreme humid Singapore heat. They have also installed breeze shelters with motion sensor fans to take a break during the walk around the bay.
The promenade gives a nice closeup view of the bay.

This place also serves as a viewing area for various public events organised here regularly. We enjoyed the special midnight firework show from here on the New year !!! We sat at the bayfront and enjoyed lovely sunset.

Spectra is one of the largest light and water show in Southeast Asia which tales place here. This is a free spectacle featuring a delightful show of laser lights and water fountains accompanied by orchestra music twice every night. It is best viewed from the Event Plaza.

Then there is the famous Helix Bridge which connects Marina Centre to Marina South. This uniquely designed beautiful pedestrian bridge has a double helix that resembles the DNA. There are 4 viewing platforms located along the bridge for people to enjoy breathtaking views of Singapore skyline.

One can also see the ArtScience Museum which is a lotus-designed building that forms part of Marina Bay Sands.

Overall must visit promenade in Singapore to soak in the fun, frolic and spirit of Singapore !!!"

,,"Safe, spectacular area to visit day or night.",5.0,,"Visited just at the end of Chinese New Year Celebrations. Absolute bonus for us as there were multiple light displays around the whole of the Marina area. We visited here on numerous occasions both day and night. Day time is great for marvelling at the architecture, museums, etc. Night time is amazing, lots of people out enjoying the cooler time, including young families. Light show is spectacular, even if watching it for the third or fourth time. We viewed it from different positions on the boardwalk, got very wet on one occasion, but well worth the up-close experience."

,,Wonderful walk at night time,5.0,,"Although beautiful during the day, the waterfront is spectacular at night.

If you are going to the waterfront to specifically see this, it may be worth checking to see if it is visible again."
,,Peaceful evening walks,5.0,,"Skyscrapers on one side and river on the other. Offers a soothing experience and breathtaking view, especially in the evenings"
,,Very excellent combination of light - water - sound,5.0,,"The contribution of sound/music made me very happy to enjoy the show, super touching and amazing. The dance of light was awesome and magical it brought water movement into farther level that I didn't imagine before. A little bit sad as people coming all stood up and try to capture the scene, instead of sitting and sharing space with others to enjoy the water."
,,"UNREAL! The Most Beautiful Waterfront in the World! PERFECT ""10""",5.0,,"I have seen waterfront skylines and promenades all over the world, but I give the Singapore bay promenade my #1 VOTE. Nothing comes close with the highlight being the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Whether you are here for business, catching a cruise or vacation, don't miss seeing this beautiful bay. There is so much to see including Merlion the water shooting lion/fish statue in the harbor.

,,Night Cruise,5.0,,A must do to see the skyline from a river cruise. See the 15 minute laser light and fountain show that you will not be able to see this up close.

,,Lovely day or night,5.0,,This is a lovely place to sit and enjoy a beer or cocktail or two! (although drinks are not cheap anywhere in Singapor!) The fountain show at night is good. It is a very vibrant area where you just sit and watch the world go by.

,,Very Nice,5.0,,"Our hotel was nearby, so we spent every evening strolling the promenade. It was a relief to get a break from the sun and take in the breeze from the bay.

There are shows every night at 8 and 9pm. We found it quite comfortable to attend the SuperTree 7:45 show and the 9pm promenade show. No rush, which is our goal when on vacation.

,,Best views are from river ferry,5.0,,Visited the Waterfront Promenade first time on the Marina Bay Sands boardwalk during the day. A nice easy walk that gives you a good view of the city. The 2nd time we visited was much more spectacular. We caught a river ferry from Clarke Quay which took us close up and personal to many areas of the Waterfront Promenade. No queues and unobstructed views of the main sights such as the Merlion fountain and Marina Bay Sands hotel. The ferry stops in at the Waterfront Promenade in front of the Marina Sands Complex. As the whole Promenade is lit up at night with vibrant colours it truly is quite magical to see

,,Terrific to see in daylight & at night!,5.0,,"There are really several ""Waterfront Promenades""-- including one near the city centre, another along the River and one near Marina Bay. All are connected-- and the walk at night (which is very safe) is ""cooler"" and more readily achieved. The one at city centre displays the diverse/modern architecture, whereas the one along the river has more historic/mature buildings. The walk near the Marina Bay complex also features a fascinating & free laser/light show (about 20 minutes in duration) every evening. TripAdvisor has awarded this walk its ""Certificate of Excellence"". The walk-- in total or in parts, is a definite must see- some during the day and some at night!

I hope that this Review has been helpful."

Late evening as darkness falls, the crowds thin, and there is plenty of space.

,,A great destination to admire Singapore's impressive architecture,4.0,,"Waterfront Promenade is the place to visit to be dazzled by Singapore’s impressive architecture, the likes of Marina Bay Sands Skypark and ArtScience Museum. The promenade stretches three and a half kilometres around the bay connected by the pedestrian Helix and Jubilee Bridges and is easy to stroll and take in all the points of interest. By day there is minimal shade so be sun smart and carry water."
,,Nice place to stroll,4.0,,"In the evening there is a free of charge light show of about 20 Minutes which is worth to see, no guide necessary, just ask , it is outside the mall. You can walk safe along the bay ( some 100 Meter) then I recommend to join the River walk which is also safe and bring you to some historic places."

,,Central to tourist Singapore,4.0,,Of course the Merlion takes pride of place here but we walked from the restaurants in front of the Fullerton (must stay here one day!) across the bridge towards the Theaters on the Bay and along the embankment - it was New Years eve and preparations were underway for the countdown - we stopped at the open air stage for a rest and it rained buckets for about an hour but then brightened allowing us to continue along the Promenade - great views some shady spots with benches and lots of food and beverage vendors - great way to spend a morning

There are quite a few bridges crossing from one side to the other, with nice views. At night, however, the waterfront comes alive with lights and music and food. It is like one long street party. The bridges are lighted too. In addition to walking, you can take the ""Water Bee"" boat tour. This costs $18 one way or more for a round trip. It is kind of a fun way to see the waterfront without having to walk it. The area could be considered to be romantic or a party scene."

It's free of cost and post that you may want to walk around the promenade.
,,Beautiful Place To Walk,5.0,,"The Waterfront Promenade is a lovely place to stroll at any time of the day, but at night, with colourful lights twinkling from the buildings all around the view is mesmerising.

,,Beautiful Walk,5.0,,Beautiful place to take a stroll. Connected well via 2 or 3 MRT station. The best part is that outside the metro station you can hire a Bi-Cyle and go around this place. There are also eScooters available. However you need to be careful of the tourists who tend to walk around. Its beautiful scenic place. Though one side looks like very Metropolitian and busy with office goers the other side of this surrounded by water is pretty. Walking along this path you can go to Merlion and Esplande
,,DO NOT MISS....amazing light show,5.0,,This is an experience worth Singapore visit. The laser light show is amazing. The changing colors and synchronization was beautiful. Sit a bit far away probably on the opposite side of the Marina Bay (near Esplanade) to get a better view DO NOT MISS.

,,"Cityscape, waterfront, people watch, whirlpool,",5.0,,"Walking along the promenade, wide enough to land a small airplane, even though there were a lot of people it didn't feel overwhelmingly crowded. The sights and sounds of the water front, fountain and laser light show all blended together in a montage of sounds, sights, smells, tastes and touch. Something for all the senses. Each architectural and engineering marvel is set off artistically with light, color and shadow. The walkway bridge with its twisting red tunnel of lights was like walking into fantasies."
,,The show quality is degrading so as the people,2.0,,"If you have visited or live in Dubai, the show in Singapore is just plain average. Even if I compare to the same show years back, it was better like 5 years ago with fire and laser. It was so dissapointing visiting Singapore again now, it is not that clean anymore, same old buildings, same entertainments, more irritating and some people we met in Singapore are just too selfish (im not generalizing here)."
,,Beautiful at night....,5.0,,The lights at night absolutely make it a great place to visit whilst enjoying the local delights at the restaurants/cafes
,,Visit at around 6pm onwards,4.0,,"There is a laser light show and water fountain display which goes on just after 6pm every day. Be there on time as it is only done once so if you miss it, you will have to come back another day. You may want to bring something to sit on (like paper bag or towel) as you will be seated along the benches infront of the Waterfront Promenade.

The light show is great, as well as the fountain display, it definitely should not be missed when you are in the area around the time when it starts."

,,A great scenic walk (in the park),5.0,,"This is a walk which all harbourfront cities in the world shoulds have.

Living in Hong Kong i / we sorely miss something of that quality around victoria harbour. Despite many initiatives of local individuals or companies suggesting harbour vitalisation these have not found the interest of the rulers of Hong Kong who simply handed over Hong Kong to the local developers (end of moaning).

The waterfront promenade is best to visit at the beginnig of the sunset, then walking into the night from the bay towards and along Boat Quay and Clark Quay.

I loved the old iron bridges in front of the Fullerton hotel as well as the park in front of the historic building / museums in there.

We came during preparation time for the Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix and the fences everywhere - even in the park - did spoil the impression a bit.

A great walk in the evening ending up in a restaurant or bar at Boat Quay or Clarke Quay make this a certainly memorable ""must'walk""."
,,Accidentally visited,4.0,,"Got off at the wrong MRT Station when heading to Gardens by the Bay and ended up here. Got a decent coffee at the Northern end and enjoyed the harbour view.

Try to enjoy the water and lights free of charge show from the Event Plaza and don't forget to record every moment with your camera, you will not regret it."

,,Stunning views,5.0,,"The nightly laser show is something to behold amongst the starry, glittery lights of the city. Visit the top of the marine Sand hotel for a stunning view - paying to get onto the viewing deck is a waste of money. Stay at the bar above it and get the same view for nothing."

,,place to unwind,5.0,,"The waterfront promenade is a delight to be in, especially in the evenings with the gentle breeze and the amazing light and water show once the sun sets.

,,Wonderland at night,5.0,,"If you have visited the waterfront promenade during the day, do yourself a favor and revisit it at night. What a magical feast, water, lasers and music, blend to create an amazing fairytale atmosphere. Just pure magic."

,,Wow !! What a fabulous riverside walk around the Jubilee Promenade,5.0,,"We did the Promenade Walk over two days. We started at Clarke Quay on day one and finished at the Marine Barage with a stop on the Singapore Flyer. Then a couple of days later we started at Boat Quay on the city side of the river and walked to Gardens By The Bay.

This is a fabulous flat walk dotted with historic and modern buildings, fabulous modern sculptures and sculptures that tell the stories of the rivers marine and trading past. The walk can be busy with tourist groups around the underpass to Merlion Park.

People - walking, running, practising the art Tai Chi, enjoying fine food at restaurants or little shops attached to the entrances of the MRT underground malls.

The promenade is very green with parks, trees and open spaces where you can picnic or work out as we saw some groups doing. The promenade feels extremely safe both day and night so no worries if you go out alone late at night which I did a couple of nights, always heaps of happy locals or tourists about taking the great sights of the Marine Basin.

I would highly recommend this walk - it's easy, lots of interest in the different architecture and all the great sculptures."
,,Promenade,5.0,,"If you make it so far to see the city, you need a few hours to walk along the Waterfront Promenade, and take in all the beauty."
,,great at night!,4.0,,"enjoy the free Spectra show, which is getting better i think from the last time i saw it 3-4 years ago. strolling along the river also nice."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,walking along the promenade late in the afternoon watching the lights come on as night approached dinner on the sidewalk watching the laser light show. couldn't get better!
,,Excellent space to hangout,5.0,,"It is a different space when compared to my first visit some years ago. A huge choice of shopping, food options and of course one cannot miss the light , water show in the evening,, simply Marvellous"
,,Beautiful at night,5.0,,"If you go to Singapore and you didn't spend an evening here, you definitely missed out on a highlight of Singapore. The atmosphere at night, with the beautiful lights of the city as backdrop is just breathtaking. And the nightly water and lights show is something you can't miss."
,,Its really a wonderful sight,4.0,,Worth a viist and spend time and enjoy the views. Its leisurely and certsinly can spend long hours there.
,,Waterfront Promenade,5.0,,Great place to walk around during the day and night. Highly recommend seeing the light/laser show at 8pm or 9pm too!
,,Entertaining,4.0,,"I love the music and the lights, very minimal but soothing in the ear. Nice to have an entertainment at night."
,,Light show is amazing,4.0,,Time your shopping or dinner to view the nightly light show. It has been changed to include addtional lights placed in the inner harbor. It is free...but get there early to grab a serat.
,,a lovely walk at night,4.0,,this is a great place for a stroll by the river but if you stop for something to drink or eat expect to pay tourist prices
,,"GREAT TIME TO WALK AND TO ENJOY WATERFRONT PROMENADE, MAY 2018.",5.0,,"During a 6 nights stay in Marina Bay Sands Hotel and 2 nights in Mandarin Oriental Hotel, I took the opportunity to walk several times along Waterfront Promenade. The most interesting parts are Helix Bridge, Merlion Statue (the big and the small one), the view on Marina Bay Sands Hotel and river cruise boats. It is really nice to do it by night, as the colors and light show in the evening are really of high quality and relaxing. Expect many people all around as this place is very touristic and many people like to make selfies all around the place.
Be aware of potential thunderstorms, which can start very fast and be very strong for a while. Try the river cruise also, which will give you the opportunity to see with different views of all the area. Last thing, the price for food in this area are very high compare with food price in Chinatown or in Little India.
I will soon add some photos to my review, for you to see what I'm talking about.

The Olympic Walk is where you’ll commonly see a lot of runners and people generally exercising. The small piers are available to sit on and watch everyone milling around the spitting Merlion Fountain and there are several tiny ice cream parties open until late allowing you to wander aimlessly around The Marina in the humid conditions without a care in the world.

The water and laser show Spectra was another amusement that made me forget how tired I was.

It was quiet on the Marina Bay waterfront promenade and banks of the 3.2-kilometre, Singapore River. J enjoyed the scenery on both sides; the breeze was blowing, while I walked and waited for the night to come. The area is especially beautiful after sunset, when all lit up.

At one time it was extremely important as a trade route and for commerce. Today, besides the office towers along its banks and nearby, there are lots of places to stroll, chill out, dine, and enjoy a few drinks.

Luckily the afternoon storm had passed over when we exited the station so we made the short walk to The Fountain of Wealth. After making a wish we proceeded to the Helix bridge, Great views of the Singapore flyer & Marina bay sands hotel. Once at the Helix bridge we tried to get to the waterfront but the way was blocked off for some event at The Float @ Marina Bay so we had to walk around the back of the grandstand.

The waterfront is breezy and full of cheers and laughter. A great place to unwind and lots of restaurants to check out. The Merlion also had a display of projected images at night, making it a colourful attraction of its own.

,,Well designed Promenade,4.0,,"The waterfront promenade provides a great spot to view the water and laser light show Spectra. The promenade is very ""buzzy"" and was busy on each occasion we went. I think the area could do with a few more food outlets and some more seating but all in all it remains a water promenade area that is well designed and I wish my home city of Perth had taken notice of when they designed Elizabeth Quay which is a poor cousin by comparison."
,,A MUST,4.0,,If you are in Singapore -then this is a must see experience. Take it all in - spend a few hours and enjoy.

Arrive around 15 - 20 min earlier and go to the pier that is located right near to the Louis Vuiton store. You will find plenty of spaces there to watch the show. After the show, try Singapore local food in a nice place, located in the food court of the shopping mall that is in front of the water show. You need to look for the Food Republic, which is in the L1 floor of the mall where you will find probably around 15 - 20 different types of small restaurants, serving all types of asian foods, need to try!!"

,,Very busy and great atmosphere,4.0,,"Loads of bars and restaurants all types, lights at night are fantastic, loads of great atmosphere on a Friday & Saturday night.

,,Spectacular at Night,5.0,,A lovely and extremely safe place to promenade in the evening and enjoy the spectacular light show and see the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and other landmarks lit up. Some good photo opportunities.
,,Lively Light Show,5.0,,"One of the best place to end your tour or day. We had a dinner along the area, walked through the promenade and of course took some pictures. The place is picturesque not only during the day but I must say I like it better at night. For persons who wants to chill/drink there are bars near the area too.
After our walk, we watch the lively water laser light show at the event plaza along the promenade... I suggest that for better view, secure a seat early."
,,Busy area - worth a visit for the atmosphere and lights but expensive to eat and drink,2.0,,"Atmospheric area are rear of the Fullerton Hotel. Lots of bars and people drinking outside - mainly office workers after work and such like. The cafes all tout for business as you walk outside - enter at your peril if yo are on a budget, Simple food like spring roles or Sate will cost you more than the finest hotels charge and if you go for seafood from the tanks, make sure you have enough cash or a credit card.. Worth a visit but move on to Marine bay to eat."
,,Pleasant promenade,5.0,,"We walked along the promenade after seeing the laser and fireworks display at night , very safe to walk along. Lots to see at night with all the light s too."
,,Great to spend the evening,5.0,,"As we visited around Chinese New Year, the promenade was busier than usual with the River Hongboa taking place, so there was a stage on 'The Float' as well as CNY exhibits, the stage near the concert halls which were all entertaining. The bonus was a firework display every evening at 9pm.

From here it is easy to access other parts of the marina such as the Fullerton area, the helix bridge to the gardens, and the Raffles Place area.

Having been numerous times since 1989, it is amazing to see the transformation of the area from an empty area of recently reclaimed land to what it is today.

There are literally hundreds of places to eat and drink, but they are rather expensive compared with other places, and if you value your budget, then better to dine elsewhere."
,,"Great night walk, fun to walk past early in the morning although everything is closed",5.0,,"Between the Esplanade bridge, theatres and several restaurants the waterfront offers a great experience for anybody looking to get something to eat, walking around or just wanting to relax for a bit with a marvellous view of the Marina Bay Sands and the Merlion.

Getting here is not too much of a problem, either go to the city hall or raffles place subway station. I particularly found the city hall station easier as I got disoriented in raffles place and the GPS can be a little weird next to the high rise buildings.

Now, can you find here? good food, a nice atmosphere and depending on the time people jogging, taking photos, hordes of tourists or people trying to relax and have nice food (at night). We were part of three of these groups as we do not run in Singapore ;)

I do need to warn you, early in the morning (or in the morning in general) everything is close. I am not quite sure when it gets active but if you drop by at 6 pm or later you will find it quite alive.

The recommendation here is: come at night to enjoy it, otherwise just walk past straight to the helix bridge or the Esplanade bridge as it will be sort of dead otherwise."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Enjoyed walking around the waterfront. Is very beautiful at night and when we where there last week, had little markets on the promenade. Worst a look and the kids will love it too."
,,Pleasantly Releaving,4.0,,"The Waterfront has been created with iconic Water Marlon having the Lion face representing Singapore- The City of Lion. The area is full of activities giving panoramic view of the Marina Bay Sands Park and other buildings across. The water front is large and neat and has facilities for every one. It is the place from where one can board ferries to have river side view of Singapore, the old settlement area."
,,Nice walk about,5.0,,"We had a nice morning walk with some coffee and it was wonderful. Once again so clean and up keep was spot on. Weather was great, nice and cool."
,,Lots of tourists,4.0,,"Great area to walk around and people watch. The architecture is fabulous and you ma even run into a large group of people that exercise to musik. The restaurants and bars are geered towards tourists. If you want something authentic, walk through here look at it and than go eat somewhere else. It will most likely be cheaper and better and more authentic"
,,A lovely walk both day and evening,5.0,,There is always so much going on and you get a welcome breeze from the water. Many of the city's interesting places are along by the river and the skyline is brilliant.
,,What fun!,4.0,,"It's fun to stroll along the riverfront and enjoy the sights, sounds, and smells. As there are a myriad of cafes, restaurants and permanent food carts, you can enjoy a meal or snack. The only downside is walking there as the entries to underpasses below the highway are not clearly marked."
,,A Great Place for a Stroll,5.0,,The waterfront promenade is a great place for an evening stroll. There are several shops and cafe outlets to browse through and relax.
,,BEAUTIFUL,5.0,,The Waterfront Promenade is walkable. We walked it at 1am and during the day many times. So much to see. The Waterfront is clean and feels safe. There are museums along the way to visit.

,,Best view of Singapore,5.0,,Greatest view on the Marina bay - take the walking bridge from Marina Bay Sands to the Durian Theaters and make sure to have a drink on the rooftop of the Theaters!
,,Lovely Walk,5.0,,Great place to take a walk and take some pictures. Lots of impressive architecture and photo opportunities. Also Plenty Restaurants of all varieties to experience.
,,Lights and river cruise,4.0,,We enjoyed the light works display. The river cruise is a simple show off the Singapore River and learn how the conservation works to restore the clean water. Evening time is the best time for the river cruise.
,,Best spot in Singapore,5.0,,"On our first night we stumbled across the promenade as the night began and it just blew me away. To see all the lights from the skyscrapers, the bridge - its all so magical lit up at night.
Definitely walk around the whole area to appreciate the view from all angles - there is nowhere like it in the world for me.
There's a great light show too on every night, sometimes twice in a night done to music and great to see."

,,Vibrant both by day and by night,4.0,,"The Waterfront Promenade refers to the entire area surrounding Marina Bay in Singapore. It offers you a great view of the bay and of all the famous structures in the area (such as the Merlion Park, the Esplanade, the Helix Bridge, the Marina Bay Sands hotel, etc.). To cover the whole area you would have to walk (or drive) all the way from Collyer Quay, then along Esplanade Drive, up to Bayfront Avenue (or vice-versa). The whole area is visible from the upper deck of Marina Bay Sands hotel.

Waterfront Promenade is a vibrant center of activities both by day and by night. It has a long line up of shops, parks, restaurants, entertainment venues, docking areas, hotels, and so forth. Indeed, there's no dull moment when you're in the area. As expected, it is highly visited by both locals and tourists alike. The place offers you great backgrounds for your photo shoots (although sometimes it is hard to get a shot with no photo bombers in the frame).

For first timers to Singapore, a visit to the Waterfront Promenade is a must. It is good to visit the place especially early in the morning or in late afternoon when the temperature is no longer that elevated. Night offers you a totally different view of the bay, with all the modern structures well lit. The best way to enjoy the place is by walking around the entire bay. Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to walk for hours, in this case. :D"

The promenade also has an array of restaurants with drink deals and happy hours - somewhat pricey, however - but it is Singapore.
During the day, it's a lovely stroll, with the beautiful skyline looking down upon you, and a fun statue of a chicken hidden by a mall. Quaint boats pass through, highlighting the contrast of Singapore the futuristic city, with Singapore of the past."

,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"We went to the hotel and up to the viewing platform (£12) and the views are spectacular. The hotel itself has hundreds of shops and restaurants which you can use, We also did a river boat cruise and went up the flyer, again great views and well worth the trip."
,,Scenic!,5.0,,"Everywhere you look you see something else that is magnificant. No other way to describe it. From the skyscrapers, to the bay, to the marina itself, just incredible. We spent two hours walking around and just admiring the view before taking dinner. Well worth a stroll. Easy to walk and the scene at night is incredible."
,,Huge location,5.0,,"surely Singapore's most representative attraction is its bay embedded in skyscrapers and luxury hotels. do not miss the lights and water games at the 21st, in front of the Sand Marina."
,,Beautiful View,5.0,,"The Waterfront Promenade is a beautiful place to visit. Great views of the city, lots of places to dine and shop. Just spectacular at night!"
,,scenic view,3.0,,nice views during various times of the day. spending here is on the high side. many fun art installations in the outdoor too.

,,I could have been lost,3.0,,"OK so the gardens by the bay, include cloud forest, flower dome, super tree and many other little sections, The Promenade is a decking that walks beside the river, free and pleasant, but nothing to write home about!"
,,Another lovely part of Singapore,5.0,,"This is just another lovely part of the city to visit, you can see the merlion in this area and the infamous marina bay sands amazing"
,,Really great lights show in the evening,5.0,,"I visited Singapore with my husband and parents for 6 days in August. One of the evenings we caught the MRT to Bayfront station to walk and watch the Supertree Groove lights display at 6:45, then we caught the MRT again to Raffles place to wander and watch the 8pm lights show from the steps by the Merlion - great view! Both light events are free and awesome. We would highly recommend the Waterfront Promenade show. It includes lasers, lights, fountains and a number of buildings. Lots of places for dinner and dessert in this area as well to make an evening of it. Some people were watching from the boats on the water, but it is more expensive and just as nice from the land. I think if you were on the Marina Sands side of the water you would not get the same experience with the lights on the buildings, but would see more of the water fountains."
,,The Water/Light Show was Incredible,5.0,,Stumbled upon the Water/Light Show by accident. Started at 9pm on Friday night. The music was perfectly timed to the lights and water. We were mesmerized.
,,Water Talking,5.0,,"This is one of the exclusive shows you can get for free!!
The Show is on the opposite side of Merlion and on top of Marina sands Market.This a tales of River and Water- with Fountains and laser doing the talking- Its a special Artform they have created- definitely not to be missed."

,,Lazy stroll.,4.0,,"clean, unclustered and a nice walk to take in the view of the city and surrounds.looks better at night."
,,Terrific views and sightseeing along the way!,4.0,,"Very impressive waterfront which includes restaurants, bars, cafes and attractions along the way. It includes many of the quay's including Boat, Clarke, Robertson. People watching, photo taking opportunities and good eats. Night time is also a great time to see this promenade and area. One of the highlights in the CBD area and along the Singapore River."
,,Visit,5.0,,Great place to be near the sea in a busy city. Watch the waters lap close by and hear the sound of the sea. A great view of the urban landscape that is singapore. See the lights of buildings as the sun sets

,,Wonderful at night,4.0,,Waterfront promenade is wonderful at night. There is a light and water show. Also boat ride is available.
,,An evening stroll,5.0,,what a wonderful place to take a stroll - best in evening with all the lights around the bay. Walk all around the marina in 40 minutes and take in a cool drink or smoothy at one of the many outlets en route.
,,As Nice A Waterfront As You'll Ever See,4.0,,"Singapore is a beautiful city and perhaps the most picturesque part of it is it's waterfront. Aside from the water itself, the skyscrapers and Marina Bay Sands Hotel make the view really attractive, especially as the sun goes down and the golden light is reflected in the glass on the buildings and then lster as they light up.
The Merlion Fountain is another good spot along the promenade and the Gardens By the Bay and Supertree Grove are not far.
The promenade is wide, very even and easy to walk along. Lots and lots of bars, cafes and restaurants night and there are plenty of benches and viewing points to sit and enjoy the views.
A beautiful walk, one that I recommend is built into any itinerary by folks visiting Singapore."
,,"Night tour on a bum boat, just spectacular",5.0,,After a vigorous trishaw ride to Clarke Quay it was time for our boat ride. We had background commentary in the boat and we had a glorious ride along the waterfront. Under bridges past all the building with the highlight the laser show at Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The whole ride was spectacular and everyone in our group really enjoyed the ride. This is a must do again ride on our visit to Singapore.
,,Nice view of the waterfront,5.0,,"This place is easily accessible using either bus, MRT or taxi. But to travel to here, I would like to recommend the usage of MRT as it is more convenient for traveling. You can alight at promenade MRT ( CIRCLE LINE ) ( YELLOW LINE ) or Marina Bay MRT ( RED LINE ). These place is a stone throw from Marina Bay Sands.

At this place, you can get a beautiful view of the nights lights of Singapore City. These place is also very nice and windy to walk."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"I walk in two nights here and I have this view from my bed from the hotel Marina Mandarin, and I sleep with my eyes open to remind all my life this view.

,,Awesome Light Show,5.0,,"We were wondering around the Marina Sands resort & as we were leaving to get a boat back to our Motel we stumbled on the Water light show, how spectacular it was. Highly recommend a visit."
,,Walk in the night,4.0,,Very pleasant walking all the way. You have a nice view everywhere you stand. During the night you can see the lights and it is completely different.
,,YOU ASKED: Is the Merlion even worth that minus 1?,4.0,,"Something for most everyone:

History buffs (who even says that?) can enjoy The Fullerton Hotel.

Architecture enthusiasts can marvel at the world's highest valued real estate in the MBS.

Romantics can wander hand in hand by the water.

Those more committed to the struggle can join a bootcamp or running group in the early evening.

Those made of money can eat crab and sip cocktails with a view.

The rest of us can go to Gluttons.

Everyone can be awed by the fact that what we are looking at is 'reclaimed land' and there is a reason why Beach Road is now far from the beach, and that Customs House is now a bar nestled inside a fresh water reservoir that is crucial to providing the country with its fresh drinking water, rather than a sinking colonial office on a boggy mangrove marsh.

So why only 4 stars? Minus 1 star for old mate Merlion. He is rubbish."
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,"This promenade links the sites of Singapore in one beautiful walk along its waterfront. Plenty of bars and restaurants to pop into as you enjoy a stroll along it, I highly recommend getting out and doing this if you are able to. The walk is free, open day and night and a photographers dream!"

,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I could sit there all evening and watch the beautiful light show (it's free!) and bask in the warm breeze. Good for family, couples and solo travellers too."
,,Great walk in the evening,5.0,,"As the sun goes down start from Merlion statue for the photo opportunities, then walk round to Gluttons Bay or some cheep eats. On the weekends there is often a free show at the outdoor theatre and on a warm night it is a good area to just sit and take in lights of the city, or the water/light show from a distance. Walk on round past the floating stage and onto the Helix Bridge. Photo places from the bridge. Across the bridge and into the shopping Mall which is huge, but didn't forget to pop out to see the water/light show from this side as well. Too early, don't worry there are a few bars around the area for a beer while you wait. The walk round the last part of the bay is nice and flat and the less touristy, but a nice walk anyway."
,,Lovely and romantic promenade,5.0,,We started our walk from the Clarke Quay. You would see a lot of tourist spots along the promenade. Better go early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid heat. Bring a portable fan and water spray for cooling down. There would not be shortage of water as you can find convenient stores easily.

,,Walk this,5.0,,Walk this. And night and day. There are so wonderful images. Take many photos. I will remember this forever.
,,Awesome,4.0,,"I know that the word 'promenade' elicits connotations of walking but I cheated. I was staying at the Raffles Hotel on Beach Road, where outside, on the corner, I ran into a local guy offering bicycle tours. So I thought what the heck, let's do something different. So I did.

I paid about $35 Singapore dollars for what amounted to being biked through the CBD, He did the work, I didn't. We passed through the CBD, past the Flyer and onto the Formula 1 pit lane, before ending at the Waterfront Promeande. And from here I did do some token walking.

The surrounds are impressive, the pavements and walkways clean and the mob of selfie-sticks everywhere.

Well worth the time to absorb what is an amazing city. Just let your feet do the walking."
,,"Relaxing, breath taking",5.0,,"Nice place to relax or sit down after a long walk especialy if you came from Esplanade or Merlion Park..worth sitting there until night so that you can watch Marina Bay musical and colorful fountain of lights from afar.

,,Enjoyable walk,5.0,,"I caught the MRT to Raffles Place and then walked along the river past the Fullerton Hotel and crossed the street to the Merlion.

I then continued walking along the Waterfront Promenade passing the Theaters and Esplanade Mall. Along the way I bought a refreshing coconut ice cream from a vendor's van. I continued on until I reached Promenade MRT station.

Even though it was a hot day, I came across many tourists and also local family groups with little children playing on their scooters."
,,Waterfront,2.0,,Rubbish. Not worth the time or effort. Good photography. Taxi difficult to find. Overpriced food. Nothing fancy here. Best to move along.

A great open space to wander taking in the view of the city, the light show, the water show, the water taxis or just the water, with no hawkers, no speeding push bikes or tacky tourist stalls, selling rubbish.
It is good the way Singapore sees the bigger picture of tourism and gives the tourist areas where they not only feel safe 24 hours a day, but can enjoy the area with out fear of being ripped off or pestered.
Take the time to enjoy, night was my preference"

It is sincerely a smorgasbord of top rank photo and video ops. However, it is also stone-paved and to see everything, you will be doing *lots* of walking. Likely for hours. Without exaggeration, mountain climbing is easier on your feet and ankles. With the right footwear, you'll be fine. Without, you will be suffering for the next 3 days. Best be prepared."

The second choice for this place would be a day stroll if you are alright with some heat and humidity. Dress light and as always, comfortable footwear.

I probably took a dozen pictures or more because every night the lights and the water seem to be different. While the rest of the city is asleep, the waterfront is getting brighter and more serene. These place is a great get away to enjoy the city scape of Singapore.
I am so amazed at how the government and the locals maintain the cleanliness and peace of the place. Not even one police on sight. Even with the big crowd on weekends and festivals still there is zero crime. How do they do it? ( discipline and love of country probably) Kudos! to the discipline of Singaporeans."

,,Good Place to Chill,4.0,,The waterfront promenade is located right where 90% of Singapore's attractions are i.e Marina Bay. You can see everything from there and it is a nice place to sit and enjoy as well as take in the view. It can get hot so better to come there during twilight although it will get crowded thereafter.
,,Nice light show to fill your sight seeing itinerary,3.0,,"We took the MRT and it involves a lot of walking. It is nice to relax and sit by the tables near the waterfront. Drinks and snacks are expensive, so bring your own if you prefer. To get a good view of the light show, you will need to stand next to the railing as it could get crowded. I had to stand on the table to see the images projected onthe light. Before the light show there was a lady singing live being accompanied by a guitar. When they finished we waited a couple minutes before the light show began from one of the boats in the water. I think the event is also very popular to local tourists so it was packed."

,,A must see in Singapore!,5.0,,"Head down to the Esplanade Theatre on Raffles Ave, and on the waterfront you can experience the nightly lightshow from Marina Bay Sands. There is terraced seating at the outdoor theatre with greast views of the Merlion and city skyline to the right. Beside the Theatre is a very popular Hawker food centre called Makansutra Gluttons Bay. Worth a visit, but hard to find a seat."
,,Good For A Romantic Walk,4.0,,"You can actually take a walk all the way around the bay. We find it most suitable for a slow relaxing walk after dinner. Cool breeze, nice views and many places to stop for a rest or take a picture. Highly recommended for couples."
,,Amazing night views,5.0,,"It is possible to walk completely around the waterfront, though if you do it by day several stops for refreshments are advised! Opposite the Marina Bay Sands Hotel is a good place to watch the nightly light and laser show. The River cruise boats ply their trade at various points around the waterfront and a 40 minute evening trip on the river gives a different perspective to the Singapore skyline. There are plenty of places on the Business District side of the waterfront to eat although most of the restaurants there are fairly expensive. However Chinatown is not far away where good street food, at reasonable prices, can be found. The Helix Bridge takes you over the river to Marina Bay Sands complex and is a very popular spot to take photos. The route is also very popular with local running clubs and cyclists so keep a lookout! There are many bars and restaurants along the waterfront fronting MBS."

Great View of the City skyline , also of the buildings which line the waterway , there are the older colonial buildings which are wonderfully lit up at night , as are the modern day structures , it's a great area to see and visit , you always feel safe in Singapore , I think all the criminals are to scared to live there ! , it also has is a Large Casino in the complex as well , and I mean LARGE ! . The whole area is well worth visiting , if you can .....do it ! ."
,,"Great view of the city, Overhyped laser show",4.0,,The evening view of the city is something to really see. The buildings and their subtle lighting are a good photo opportunity. At 8pm they have a laser show which at the ground level is not all that spectacular. (and too crowded for poeple to see) For guest on top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel - they might get a much better view
,,Unmissable,5.0,,"However short your visit to Singapore, whether it's a short stopover or part of a South-East Asia journey, if you miss the waterfront you will have omitted one of the most scenic and atmospheric parts of the city. The waterfront promenade stretches from the end of the Quays at the grand Fullerton Hotel and the small Merlion Park, across Jubilee Bridge, around the bay to the Helix Bridge and the impressive Marina Bay Sands. In all directions the skyline is stunning. We made the huge mistake of not visiting during the evening which will certainly be rectified on our next visit."

,,Great views but worth the cost?,3.0,,"There are a number of bars and restaurants along the promenade and these will have amazing views across the may to the Marina Bay Hotel but boy, it's expensive. Singapore is very very expensive, (in the tourist areas) but this was eye watering. We were looking for dinner but having checked menus at three different places we were looking at the equivalent of £200 for one course and a bottle of wine. We walked away."

It's good to combine the walk with the Singapore River Cruise to get a good perspective from different angles."

,,Great area with lots to explore,5.0,,"Great for a stroll. Can be very hot by day so take plenty of water with you...

Although one morning we actually got caught in a humid thunderstorm which came out of nowhere! Having little protection made our way to shelter under a bridge near the Merlion close to Jubilee Walk the SG50 anniversary walkway. After about 30 minutes the worst was over but what a downpour!

The area itself is fantastic. You can see views of the Marina Bay Sands, Merlion, the business district lit up by night with multiple colours reflecting off the water. Visit Makansutra Gluttons Bay in the evening (which we can highly recommend for the local satay and casual drinks, an area of street food with views) onwards to The Helix bridge, lotus flower ArtScience museum, into The Shoppes Luxury shopping mall with restaurants. Outside the mall we had a great view of the evening light show.

Also of note, in this top area Singapore hold their Jazz Festival (approx March time, but check their website) which you can purchase tickets for, or just soak up the sounds of the live jazz bands sitting in bars nearby. Great atmosphere.

If you continue in this direction you can also walk to the Gardens by the Bay and Supertrees area.

All of the above are in walking distance. There is so much to explore you could easily spend several days here."

,,Vibrant Singapore,5.0,,"The waterfront Promenade in Singapore is a must do at night. The lights, activity and vibe in this area is great. When the lights come on Singapore looks its best - and the light show across the water is a must to see at least once. Boat trips along the water at night give a different feel to daytime and is worth doing."
,,Impressive,3.0,,"This was a very interesting walk. Singapore buildings, statues, and views of traffic on the water make this walk well worth while."
,,Beautiful by Day - Outstanding by Night!,4.0,,"Walking the Promenade day or night is a lovely way to enjoy the sights of Singapore. Many restaurants ring the Promenade including a hawkers market that is made for tourists, not locals. The are several stops to get on and off the bumboats. Spectacular by night when the Marina Sands is highlighted in neon and there is a light and sound show. Pretty at all times of day and night."

Beautiful place and near have other nice place where can visit."

,,CELEBRATED NEW YEAR HERE,4.0,,"Great place to see the NY fireworks, came early and found a good spot to enjoy our evening picnic and champagne. Cant beat the location and view. Much better than spending a fortune for a NY celebration at one of the clubs or restaurants"
,,Nice and quiet,5.0,,Though when you enter through the Marina Sands shops and mall it is an amazingly quiet place considering you cross millions of people!
,,Two visits - one night and one day,5.0,,"Excellent both day and night. But at night there's the laser light show. These seemed to be on the hour and were a lot of fun from street level. Lots of people walking, running, biking, roller blading in the evening, lots of people sitting on the steps chatting, a real community feel. Very safe of course, and great views of the city. A very nice walk."
,,Amazing Laser Show,5.0,,"Visited the shoppes unplanned, went out towards the promenade and found that a show of some kind will start shortly which turned out to be an amazing experience with a video displayed on water mist cluds created through high pressure jets and backed by special effects and lasers... excellent experience"
,,Great walk with views!,5.0,,The promenade covers a large area and so you will need some time to fully take in the sights and sounds. Great opportunity to take great photos of the marina bay area or relax and enjoy a meal or a drink in the many bars and restaurants.

,,"Night, action, laser show.",5.0,,"The promenade is surprisingly long (including the walk around to Marina Bay Sands shopping). It extends the promenade the early English settlers used to use in the balmy tropical evenings. It surrounds Marina Bay, which now is part of Singapore's water system. Take an afternoon walk along the promenade, stopping for food, shops, a wander through the mall, a visit to the Fullerton, and a stroll around the DNA-inspired bridge. Do consider a return in the evening. Catch the ferry from Clarke Quay early evening and go shopping in Marina Bay shops, grab a bite to eat and be there for the 9:45PM laser show. This area has history and modernity all happening amongst vibrant cultural edifices."
,,Spectacular at night,5.0,,"Gorgeous views, the water light show is impressive and the entire area is well laid out and spotless, great for photo takers."
,,A pleasant walk,4.0,,"Relaxed easy walking, lovely at night. Probably better as the days are hot and walking not as pleasant"
,,lovely,5.0,,"As everyone has said, this is a very nice place to walk. The views are beautiful. There are many restaurants and other places to stop along the way. It can get hot in the middle of the day and there isn't much shade, so this is better done in the morning or early evening.

If you happen to be there when they are setting up for the Formula 1 race, some parts might be blocked, so beware."
,,disappointing display,3.0,,"you needto be close to the hotel to get the full effect of this display, if you want to hear the music. If you want to see the lights, then you need to be on the other side of the water, but you cant hear the music...........catch 22"
,,Amazing,5.0,,We visited this absolutely stunning and amazing place in both daylight and at night. The night time is simply stunning as the whole river front and bay is a stunning visual event in it self.

Walked from Clarke Quay to Marina Bay to watch the fireworks and back and plenty to see along the way."
,,Pleasant walk along the bay,4.0,,"Nothing special here. Just a pleasant garden setting next to the river with plenty of places to sit and relax. We passed through here during the day when it was hot, along the way from the Merlion to the Flyer. So we visited by accident. Very nice all the same."
,,A Good PLace To Relax,4.0,,"The waterfront promenade is a good place to rest after a long and tiring day. The water show is good , though the story line is not clear. Its free and there are bubbles if little kids are feeling bored."
,,Night bus tour and Boat cruise,5.0,,"Well worth spending time on an evening bus and boat cruise. The night light and laser presentation was worth the effort, expense and time and left us a memorable experice. Hopefully will be back agin in the future"
,,Singapore light show - such a disappointment,2.0,,"Tonight we travelled to the waterfront anticipating to see an exciting light and water show, similar to those experienced on Hong Kong harbour. We had seen several photos advertising the show and had no reason to expect that it wouldn't measure up. After watching the 15 minute show, where a few lasers were projected over holograms playing on spraying water, we were left wondering ""is that it?"" Very lacklustre and disappointing.

The city lit up at night is a beautiful sight from the waterfront. The light show adds nothing at all."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The best time to walk on the promenade would be at sundown when all the lights around come on. The Laser show on the promenade is breathtaking!
,,Mesmerizing,5.0,,We took a boat ride to the promenade. It was a beautiful site. We were surprised by a live performance at the Promenade. So if you have time and don't know where to go and what to do...straightaway head to the waterfront.

,,Heart of singapore,4.0,,A nice place to walk around sunset as it has beautiful views of Singapore. A must see place for tourist.
,,To be enjoyed day and night,5.0,,"Singapore's waterfront offers a lot for the tourist. The 'Marina Bay Sands', 'Esplanade' and merlion are all situated here, so it's a great place to soak up the culture of Singapore or do a bit of people-watching either from the promenade itself or from one of its rooftop bars.
At night it becomes busier, but pleasantly so which only adds to it's atmosphere.
Plus, there's a great vendor cart that sells fantastic coconut ice cream to ward away the city's fiendish heat!"

There are lots of great views along the way, with gardens on the land side housing great sculpture pieces, the Singapore symbol spouting water into the marina, river cruises around the bay, a lot of restaurants and bars, and numerous seating areas to rest the weary feet. There is a breeze across the water so it doesn't feel blistering hot even at midday. If you are lucky you may see some otters, and there are lots of turtles basking on the wooden struts under the broadwalk. It gets very busy at the weekend so keep that in mind if you'd like a quieter stroll."

We spent the evening here in the outside seating area of a bar and enjoyed the views and the local attractions then returned to the bar and we took it in turns to wander off and take as many pictures as possible.
The view immediately in front of where we were sitting was always changing.
I took pictures of hundreds of people while waiting for the lazer show.
Walkers , runners, couples of all ages, cyclists, believe it or not a tandam cycle and the beautiful lady on the back seat was doing nothing but enjoying the view and waving at people as her sweaty partner did all the peddling!
I stepped out to take some pictures and nearly got run over by two guys on roll a blades they even had lights on the blades like mini car headlights.
There was no bumping or crashing into each other everyone moved around everyone else no matter what they were doing it was beautiful calm experience. There were brides and grooms just strolling around, crowds of people taking their pictures.
A Chinese family walked in to the seating area and begged a Blonde lady and her two blonde daughters to have selfies with them.
A large good looking Asian man and his bodyguard walked past and he was mobbed by dozens of Asian people for photos and signatures, he took it really well smiled and carried on.
There are lots of attractions to see within Singapore, if you have a moment enjoy the Bay and all it has to offer during the day, come back after dark it is amazing."
,,Excellent view,4.0,,"The laser show with music and the scenery with a lot of people is really interesting. We tried to catch the best picture and watched the laser for minutes and enjoyed it.

,,A great walk even in the rain!,5.0,,"This was a great way to see this interesting part of Singapore. Despite the weather I must have taken hundreds of photos. The sites are mainly modern but there are plenty of traditional sites as well - the Merlion, the Fullerton hotel and numerous interesting features such as the youth Olympic walk, the Helix Bridge, a floating football pitch and Theatres on the Bay with an excellent view from the roof. This walk is well worth doing."
,,Great spot for after work drinks,5.0,,"Great spot to meet clients and friends, cheap bar food, expensive drinks and good selection of resturants nearby for something more substantial. Looks great at night."
,,Impressive Area But Fairly Sterile,3.0,,On a good day it is very impressive with the expanse of water and the high rise buildings but it lacks any real atmosphere. It is modern Singapore at its best and worth a visit.

,,busy area,4.0,,this place reminded me of the area around dubai mall. it is cool for a one time visit. make it at night
,,Really pretty but expected a little more,3.0,,"Pretty views over the waterfront, expected a little more from the light show. Maybe it was from where we were stood that let it down a bit. Should have gone to the opposite side.
Lots of places to eat and drink around here. Bet some of the hotels near by would have good room views of the waterfront too.
It's all flat for easy walking, strollers, wheelchairs etc and where there are steps there are also ramps."

Clean, safe, amazing architecture, few of the most important city's landmarks are situated here. You can also go for river cruise from here. Gardens by the Bay are 15 min walk away. You can take subway directly form great Marina Bay Mall. The Mall itself is state-of-the-art. Marina bay must be seen both by day and night. Do not miss night light-music-fountains show which is played every evening (three times)"

Must visit spot in Singapore. Never miss the Waterfront promenade if you are in Singapore, even you are there for a day (evening!), or one week.

I specially recommend to visit this place evening and keep at least 3-4 hours. We got down at raffles city MRT and started a walk from Fullerton Hotel went on to walk till Esplanade mall. On your way, you could spend some time at Merlion statue.At 8 PM, light show started from Marina bay by sands hotel and it was enthralling. Please watch this from Esplanade mall side. One could head enjoy a beer or drink at Esplanade mall. This takes almost a hour or so. Then through the park , walk again towards Fullerton hotel side and proceed walk along Singapore river. You find lot of food/ joints along the way and enjoy your meal at leisure.

From the Promenade you can look across the Bay to the marvels of modern Singapore built on land that has been reclaimed from the ocean, things like Marina Bay Sands, the Flower Dome and the Forest Dome in Gardens by the Bay.

Along the Promenade are numerous restaurants are bars where you can stop for a drink or lunch, sitting outside overlooking the Bay.

,,Impressive at night,5.0,,"On business with limited free time, so I chose to visit the Marina Bay area to take in the sights and have a lite evening meal. I was not disappointed - it was very impressive, with plenty of selection for coffee, snacks and lite bites.

,,Nice walk,4.0,,"This waterfront promenade is a lovely place to sit and people watch, take in the views, and watch the Laser show (which occurs every evening and is worth seeing).

By day the scenic walk is alluring but by night you will be captivated by the celestial visions on display.

This is a truly spectacular waterfront walk, with opportunties to stop and have a drink at a bar, grab a bite to eat at a cafe or restaurant or delight in some coconut ice cream from a hawkers stand. Perhaps you would just like to sit and watch the world go by or even engage in some people watching.

,,Beautiful view,5.0,,This is a fantastic place to view the attractions on the bay side. The views are just awesome.You can go for a cruise ride too
,,Best Approaching Sundown,5.0,,"Since the waterfront promenade is an open area, it is best if you find yourselves visiting this place approaching sundown so that the heat won't annoy you.

The city views are fantastic."
,,Very relaxing and beautiful venue,5.0,,"Visited on two evenings on a there'd day stay in Singapore.
Location is superb, overlooking the harbour, but doubly so in the evenings when the whole area is illuminated.

,,A stroll along the promenade,4.0,,"We caught the MRT to Promenade and then walked along the promenade to Glutton's Bay Hawker Centre where we had a meal.

We then sat on the steps near the hawker centre and watched the laser show coming from the Marina Bay Sand Hotel. There was a lot of the show that we couldn't see, but the lights were nice anyway.

We then strolled further along the Promenade where there were lots of people jogging and walking and made our way to Esplanade MRT station where we caught the train back to our hotel.

Next time, when we're not so tired, we'll try walking further around the bay as I'm sure there's a lot more to see."
,,Good place to see the Merlions,5.0,,Great place to stroll and possibly get a drink. You can see the Merlions (yes there is a small one) on the promenade.
,,Enjoy the view,4.0,,"Similar to the skydeck, the view from the waterfront promenade is amazing. You can see the skyline of Singapore. Great during daytime and nighttime. There are also some restaurants, bars and cafes on the promenade and of course the shopping center, hotel and casino are also right there."
,,Fireworks: New Year's Eve Viewing from Waterfront Promenade,3.0,,"December 31, 2016 - We arrived at the promenade at Marina Bay around 8pm and was surprised that people were already staking out their spots for the midnight fireworks. So, we found a spot and waited for 4 hours. During our wait, we had a chance to talk with families around us and that helped to pass the time as we learned more about Singapore. Also, we were able to see two Wonder Full Light and Sound Shows that are visible from the promenade. I reviewed the Light and Sound Shows under a separate review.

As far as the fireworks go, it was not the best fireworks display we have seen. It is a beautiful location with Marina Bay below the fireworks and the incredible skyline just across the Bay, including the famed Fullerton Hotel and the Merlion at the Merlion Park.

Unfortunately, the Bay is like a fishbowl shaped like a horseshoe. Without a breeze, the smoke from the fireworks just hangs in the air and continues to accumulate. The first couple of minutes of the fireworks were spectacular because there was very little smoke. However, as the fireworks progressed to the entire 15 minutes, including the finale, the smoke really took away from the visual impact of the fireworks. In my opinion, they should have the finale first while the sky is still clear of the smoke.

Having been somewhat critical, it was still worth standing for 4 hours because it is a once in a lifetime opportunity. And, we talked with people and saw the Wonder Full Light and Sound show. The crowds after the fireworks were all going for the metro so it was shoulder to shoulder; added to the experience."
,,"Ultramodern, clean, colorful water and light show!",4.0,,"Singapore is famous for shopping, activities, dining and entertainment... Take a walk along the waterfront, experience the wonder of Southeast Asia's largest light and water show. Watch how the laser lights lighted up the sky, and how the water reflected the colourful lights... It's so amazing!"
,,Wonderful clean area,5.0,,We spent many hours exploring this area. There is a great variety of attractions and a pleasure to walk around such clean surrounds.
,,My evening place :-),4.0,,I stop by Singapore often. And there is nowhere else I like to be in the evenings than here. I love the ambience of the place. Taking a stroll is a lovely experience and then there are those light displays too!
,,Promenade with Watet and Light Show,4.0,,"Lovely place for a stroll or jog down the promenade. Was a lovely water and light show on the night we were there but it was hard to see because of the wind factor. Also adults tend to push in front of the poor little children. So my advice is to go early as possible, stay at the top area as oppossed to the lower and keep your children close to you"
,,Great place for an evening or night stroll,4.0,,"An attractive place to have a leisurely stroll, the water in background of buildings look good in the evening and even better in the night with all the lights."
,,For a Quiet Stroll in the evening,4.0,,Singapore is a safe place for quiet strolls in the evening. Sometimes people gather for Tai-Chi or meet for fun.
,,great walk,5.0,,nice place to walk around sightseeing and shop - flowers everywhere. plenty of stores and places to eat
,,Amazing,5.0,,This waterfront is amazing you'll never get bored walking in someway spiral way alongside the sea always encountering interesting modern art sculptures. There are satay stands and coffee shops closer to the shoppers mall.
,,Busy waterfront with lots of places to eat,4.0,,"Busy, many restaurants (not all good though), huge shopping center in the back (all the usual luxury labels). There is also a light show twice after dark with crowds watching. The lightshow in the Gardens by the Bay is more impressive."
,,Spectacular Nighttime Display,5.0,,Come down here at night and you wont be disappointed with the night time laser and firework display.
,,great for an evening walk with skyline,4.0,,"The skyline is not too big but still nice to see at night. The Promenade is very clean (as almost everything in Singapore) and once traveling to Singapore definitely worth a visit. Once you are at Watefront Promenade already, dont forget to see the Shopping Malls at Marina Bay on the opposite side of the bay."
,,Great way to see the city lights and light show on the bay,4.0,,"Great night time activity with a good choice of places to eat and drink. Make sure you see the lights on the bar, which is a laser light show that runs every night."
,,Wide Open Space,4.0,,Strolling along the waterfront was relaxing and enjoyable. It was hot but manageable. It's a good place not only to see the sights but also people-watching. We were there in the day time and did not get to see the light show. Will have to go back!
,,It's very nice to see the nighttime life of Singapore,4.0,,It was amazing views with vibrant buzz and modern feel .great place to be visit among cloud people that will drop you to take many photos every minutes.

,,nice to see the night time lights,4.0,,"nice to see the night time lights. and listen to the music. lots of local there, the music finishes around 10.00"
,,Nice after a hot day,4.0,,The walk along the waterfront is so enjoyable after a hot day. Stay and watch the light show and make sure you stand close to the rail as you get the spray from the jets which is really cooling!
,,A lovely area,4.0,,Walked along the waterfront and sat by the water taking in all the sights. Unfortunately our timing was wrong and we missed the light show. Hopefully if we return we will get it right then.
,,Awesome Surpise,5.0,,We were walking along the waterfront and caught the light show by accident. We loved it. It was free and fun and free :) This is just one of the many great things about this city
,,Nice place for an evening stroll,5.0,,"Given the humid weather in Singapore for most time of the year, the waterfront offers a welcome place in the evenings to go for a walk and enjoy outdoor and night views. The views from the top are fabulous and nice. A lots of restaurants and shopping around within walking distance. If you have a few hours to kill this would be a good choice."
,,Not Bellagio,3.0,,Went to see the laser and light show . Although it was ok if you have seen the fountains of The Bellagio at Vegas then you will be disappointed
,,Pleasant place to have a stroll,3.0,,There are lots of things to see along the waterfront. You can while away a few hours just wandering up and down having a look at the remarkable architecture of the city.
,,The best place to be in Singapore,5.0,,Amazing views with vibrant buzz and modern feel .great place to be whatever the time and always busy.
,,Wonderful light show!!,5.0,,"After 5 years of working at the vicinity, i manage to watch the wonderful light show!! Its super amazing!! And its totally free!! Really recommend for tourists and locals!!"
,,Lazer show,3.0,,"I was really looking forward to this show and got a good position on the Bay to watch, but left a bit dissapointed as have been led to believe it was wonderful, but would say was very average. Very dissapointed."
,,stunning view,4.0,,"cool promenade with nice view and a lot of restaurant, bars and cafes near by. This place is the best in the night with bright night light, the view is stunning. What is important, this place is very clean and safe"
,,Lovely views,5.0,,We did a china town tour which included a boat tour and a ride on rickshaw. The views were fantastic and lots of lovely lights.
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"Nice promenade with nice view and very good offer of restaurant, bars and cafes. This place is the best in the evening, the view is stunning. What is important, this place is very clean and safe (However Singapore itself is clean and very safe)."
,,NICE PLACE TO WALK,4.0,,"Anice place to walk and to see a lot of atraction now was at the evening a lot of light around , you can of course also eat and dring there."
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"Walk along here either during the day or at night and its always busy. Nice views, clean and lots of photo opportunites."
,,Great Views Around Marina Bay,5.0,,Stroll around here from later afternoon to evening for a more relaxing experience. It can get hot if you stroll around here during the day. There are lots of snack places around but they are quite expensive.
,,Peaceful stroll,5.0,,I found Waterfront promenade very relaxing and absolutely loved the sculptures of flowers created by world known artist Ana Tzarev.
,,Plenty of choice and variety of food.,4.0,,"Take a walk along this promenade and choose from many different eateries. We tried Mexican, Seafood, Australian and American style eateries. All pretty good, The RedHouse for seafood is great but is really popular so either book (choose and outside table for a quieter dinner) or be prepared to wait for about 15 mins. Lots of walkers in the evening and sometimes you have to negotiate with bikes and scooters. Leads down to Clarke Quay and Boat Quay and also a place to pick up the River Taxi, worth a trip."
,,Loving it,5.0,,"The vibe, as attraction, as chill out place, to join shoppers, walkers, photographers. buy icecream and just watch and relax. Night or day."
,,Brilliant spot for day and night,5.0,,"You can spend time and walk around there half day evening and time fly. There are many spots where you can take so many different photos. It's very clean and organize. There are many areas for sitting down and relax. I have expectation to see the night light show at night but it's disappointed because I barely see anything, not sure if it's different depending on each day or not. But the views are so overwhelming and feel like this is Singapore."
,,Singapore in a pill,4.0,,"yes is more than necessary to go around following the Promenade. The water on one side and buildings and boutiques on the other side are exactly what Singapore is (practicla , friendly and efficient). I especially like the boardwalk at te foot of Marina Sand Bay Hotel , from where the view is the best to me"
,,"Night Tour of this area is very pretty, travelled via a tour bus with dinner included.",5.0,,"A nice tour along the waterfront is just lovely, good eating places especially if you like seafood, just know that they may ask you to choose your dinner whilst it is still alive which might make some visitors a little guilty. All I can say is the crab tasted great."
,,Great place for a stroll,5.0,,"The Waterfront Promenade is a lovely place to go for a stroll, perhaps stop for a drink or a meal in one of the restaurants/bars. At night the light show is excellent."
,,"Lightshows, boutiques, museums",5.0,,A capitalist wonderland. More high end boutiques and expensive cocktails than imaginable. And tons of people -- one of the few major tourist attractions where one sees Singaporians [who may be priced out of most others]. Nightly lazer light shows on the river. All sorts of impromtu performances. A great museum. A hotel tower that will take you to the top view platform for a very hefty fee. But the rest of the walking around is free. Don't miss the pedestrian walkway to the other side of the rider [Raffles Road]
,,wow,5.0,,During night or during day. Tis up to you when you will go there but you have to go there anyway. Unique.
,,Lovely area for walking,4.0,,"A great vantage point to see the Singapore skyline and walking alongside the water is always pleasant. There is lots to do and see here - the Merlion stature, the Science museum, the Helix bridge and there is also an interesting mall with its own canal running through it."
,,Wonderful place to go and just sit and look!,5.0,,"The views and photo opportunities are myriad here and all are wonderful whether you are looking at the business district skyscrapers,the Merlion,the helical bridge,museum or the Marina Bay Hotel.There's plenty of shade in certain parts where you take in these views and be relatively cool or sketch them as I did!Interesting birds in the trees and the Indonesian workers asleep on the pavement add interest!!"
,,Lovely walk along the river,5.0,,"If you can stand the heat and humidity, this is a great walk, from the bridge next to the Ritz-Carlton, along to Fullerton Bay and beyond. It's all pathway, so easy to manage"
,,"It beautiful, but the food prices are out of this world",4.0,,"Great for a look, awesome shots of Marina bay and the waterfront. We stopped for a beer and paid $18, lets just say we didn't have 2! Its a lovely walk."
,,Great views of the many mazing buildings,4.0,,"A relaxed stroll with wonderful views especially at night, good for window shopping, unless you have a very healthy credit card then you're in the right place. Try to time it with the light show"
,,Try to ger here as the sun rises,5.0,,"But any time of day, this promenade offers you a series of amazing views of the city's waterfront, financial district and original colonial buildings."
,,Good place to see 3 iconic objects in Singapore,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is probably the most pictured structure when people are gathering around the waterfront promenade, and it's not difficult to understand why. Another 2 iconic objects are the original Merlion fountain and the durian roofed Esplanade performing arts centre. A good place to see 3 iconic objects in 1 stop."
,,Great evening outing,5.0,,We went down 2 evenings in a row and they had free bands on for entertainment and all the lights on the river.
,,Don't miss the boat tour,5.0,,"We got a 3-day MRT pass in Singapore. With that we rode their underground and buses free for 3 whole days. In additional, we got a ticket to have a boat ride at the waterfront at night. This was an exceptional boat ride, which took us to see all major scenic attractions surrounding marina bay. The boat was clean and equipped with comfortable, modern furniture. This was a memorable ride."
,,recommended,5.0,,"Photos opportunities ,very nice experience ,love this coconut gelato they selling by the waterfront walkway"
,,Good laser show,4.0,,Good place to have dinner and enjoy laser show. check the timing in website and reserve a table in restaurant nearby
,,Stunning by night,5.0,,View this vista from the North bank of the river looking onto the South bank. Go at night when all the lights are on. The river banks are busy and perfectly safe
,,Very nice espacially in the evening,5.0,,"It is very nice, especially in the evening when they have live music and a show of lights. There are many places where you can have a drink or a meal."
,,AWESOOOOOMEEEEEEEEEE!!,5.0,,lovely experience.. my daughter had a blast..she loved the splashes which come onto you in between and best part of the show was--- all ofit!!
,,Stunning night views,4.0,,Very quiet in the morning- starts getting busy in the afternoon but you really have to do it by night and would highly recommend taking a bumboat ride by both day and night from here.
,,Great walk around,5.0,,"Always good for a great walk around in Singapore. Enjoy the view, relax and simply have the city leave a very pleasant impression on you. Then you know what Singapore is all about."
,,Lovely views,3.0,,"Here, you can get some fantastic views of Singapore at day and at night. There is also a food and beverage area with some choice. Hot by day, so be careful!"
,,Another great place for Happy Hour,4.0,,We went for the Pepper Crab and to walk around. Another very 'it' place for younger crowds during Happy Hour and at night. And this is where you can see the laser show from the Skypark.
,,Nice for an evening,4.0,,"The promenade has some restaurants on it which are attached to the shoppes mall. All quite nice but not really authentic Asian food. More like pub food / Italian, there was one Japanese place along the prom though.
There is an area right by the water where there is lots of seating for people watching the laser show (free). Here were hot food and drinks stalls and there was live music and it was lively.

Only issue was the whole promenade seemed to die at about 10pm (it was a weeknight). Restaurants were closing and people disappearing which was disappointing

we went to the promenade at marina bay sands and saw the light show for the second time, after first seeing it from a boat ride. Honestly - it's a completely different experience. The show has videos and images projected into water jets which are awesome and you just don't see any of this unless you're on the Marina bay sands side of the water. If in the boat you don't see it and so you basically miss the story behind the show."
,,If you enjoy walking in 100F heat with almost 100% humidity ...,1.0,,"If you did, this is the perfect activity for you. You will sweat like a pig and be sunburnt to a crisp. But if you don't enjoy being subject to this, go somewhere else. The ""views"" aren't great and there's really nothing to do."
,,Excellent at night,4.0,,"A night this place is lovely. The lights form the CBD make the place look like something out of a movie.

I was here for the lunar new year and they were using the old Olympic seating area and surroundings for the celebrations. I suspect they put things on quite a lot here. If you walk the other way you can follow the river and end up Clarke Quay where you can grab an expensive beer or two."
,,You Cannot Afford to Miss This,5.0,,"This is wow wow wow on every level. It is a tourist attraction yet local people see it as a location to meet and socialise and the views are spectacular.

The views by day are super but by night the views become spectacular as every building is illuminated and people to some out to see and be seen.
There are eateries, drinking holes and from time to time activities for the children to do - there is even a bandstand.
DO IT. IT'S SO GREAT.
And it costs nothing to look so enjoy great views for free."
,,Nice walk here,4.0,,A nice place to have a walk in the evening. Some restaurants in the concert hall. Great views of the marina bay area. Was there during Chinese New Year so some great festivities at the Float.
,,Spotless,4.0,,Lovely area but prices for a drink were prohibitive! 16 dollars for a lager it was sipped very slowly !
,,great sightseeing,5.0,,We walked along here at night but missed the lightshow. Everywhere along the bay here is beautiful!!
,,One of the world's best city walks.,5.0,,"Even if just starting at the Merlion there is a fabulous path / boardwalk all the way around to the Helix Bridge passing by the magnificent Fullerton Hotel, through the reception lobby of another exquisite hotel, past loads of new sculptures, in through the Marina Bay Mall (access to the Gardens by the Bay is on your left after the Chanel shop and left again and up the escalator) and continue through the Mall and out to the giant Lotus flower sculpture/art gallery and over the Helix pedestrian bridge. At night there are even free concerts, we even watched 'Level 42'!! A totally unexpected bonus!!
A few trees along the bottom of the harbour will give some welcome shade ..... and all the while you'll be looking up at the Marina Bay hotel and thinking ""WOW"""
,,Excellent especially at night,5.0,,"What a view. The waterfront is a must for any visitor to Singapore. By day it is bustling with tourists snapping the Merlion from all angles; by night it is transformed into a hive of activity, bright lights, music, light displays and an iconic beauty that once seen will surely never be forgotten."
,,lovely,4.0,,Very nice area and kept very clean. Plenty of seating areas and an indoor section to escape the humidity for a while.
,,Fun evening with great views and food,4.0,,Lovely location for a foodie evening and cocktails. Lots of food choices and gorgeous views! My favourite place for an evening out.
,,Magic all the way,5.0,,"Excellent magical an once in a life time experience , highly recommend to anyone. Start early and experience everything along the way and be there for the night light show"
,,Cool waterfront promenade ... great for a stroll at night ... too exposed during the day in muggy Singapore!,4.0,,Cool waterfront promenade ... great for a stroll at night ... too exposed during the day in muggy Singapore! Had a good stroll during my stay there ... cool to view the Skyline.
,,Somewhat dissapointing,3.0,,Evening laser show was not as good as expected and the shopping mall on the promenade is spectacularly expensive. All together pleasant experience after dusk in chilled breeze.
,,Best walk in Singapore,4.0,,It is one of those places where you should visit when the sky is dark and the sky scrapers are glittering with lights. There is water with ferry rides which make it a very soothing experience. There are some open air eating joints around and the place is good.
,,Very nice nice evening walk,5.0,,"This is a great location to have a nice walk before or after dinner. The best is when the sun is down / it is dark outside, so you can see the hotel nicely lit up. You can actually walk all the way around and during the walk have a cocktail or a snack somewhere."
,,Nice Waterfront in the City but...,3.0,,"A good place for stroll to see the fantastic skyline lighting up in the evening. We went especially for the Sound and Light Show which unfortunately is not very impressive. The lightshow video theme is tacky and the music choice pretty poor. We also planned to have something to eat and a beer, which are hugely overpriced, but found it was a cash free Zone with only cards accepted - so be warned."
,,Great to walk round,4.0,,"Great to walk round both day and night. Good views of Flyer, Merlion, City Skyline and the impressive Marina Bay Sands. Nice atmosphere."
,,Superb view,4.0,,Enjoy a breathtaking view of the towering skyscrapers of Singapore all lit up at night. Take a leisurely stroll on the promenade.
,,great place to watch the lightshow at night,5.0,,"My Singapore friend took me there to watch the light show at night and it was perfect! Really enjoyed the cool video, laser and music show. Singapore is amazing!"
,,Glittering night!,4.0,,This is another USP for the night attraction. Light show is amazing no matter from where you observe from deck or from the merlion!
,,Nice,5.0,,"Nice to go in evening. Just behind the hotel, they have a laser show in the evenings. It's a nice walk on the river side."
,,Great to walk around at night,4.0,,"Great place to walk around at night, take in the free laser light show over the water at approx. 8pm every evening. We circled around the promenade, took in the show and then back to our hotel - great way to see the city at night."
,,Atypical thing to do in Singapore,5.0,,We arrived to Singapore late evening and headed straight for the waterfront as it looked great for views and ambiance. Lots to look at while walking about and managed to feel a cooling breeze!
,,Best view overlooking Singapore CDB,5.0,,"the place is just so ideal to sit and relax early in the evening, it also offers the best view of Singapore CBD. The water and light show is also worth to see, you may see it twice at 8 pm and 9.30 pm from sunday to thursday and additional show at 11 pm on friday and saturday"
,,Interesting and fun to experience,5.0,,"The promenade is interesting and fun for an afternoon walk. Interesting sights and visitors with many eateries and bars along the edge. Stroll a little, then stop for a refreshment while taking in passing foot traffic and boats, then stroll some more. We loved this, doing it twice during our visit."
,,"Great during the day, fantastic at night",4.0,,"There are many things to see and experience on the promenade. Dining, entertainment, sights, pubs, music and people watching. The experience is multiplied at night when the lights make place seem magical"
,,Great place to visit in the evening,5.0,,"A must visit place in the evenings to enjoy the beautiful scenery, some great picture perfect photographs for postcards and some good place to eat. Usually crowded on the weekends."
,,Wonderful night show,5.0,,This place comes alive at night. Everything is illuminated and the show at the waters edge is great to watch.
,,Must do activity,5.0,,This is a must activity for tourists in Singapore. Great people watching and scenery. Be ready to deal with hot weather.
,,Great free show!,5.0,,Must see for at least one of the nights if possible. It's a free light show with music and worth seeing.
,,Amazing view,5.0,,Magnificent view of Singapore and Gardens on the Bay from the 57th floor. Go up to the bar also and check out the view from another angle.
,,"Romantic place, especially during twilight time",5.0,,"Many restaurants, with amazing view to the marina. If you have some time off, and just like to relax a little, this is a great spot"
,,great views,5.0,,Great place to walk and take in the amazing back drop of Marina Bay Sands and the high rises the opposite side of the bay. Plenty of bars and eateries to chose from. In the evening all lit up it really is an amazing spectacle.
,,Promenade,5.0,,The best time to visit this place is during late evening when everything is lighted up and the view is simply the best.. Do not miss the New Year Fireworks here
,,Beautiful place both day and nigth,5.0,,If you like sky scrapers you will love it. The lotus flower an amazing building. Worth a visit. Great view if you go up in Marina Bay Sands for a look over Singapore.
,,Beautiful way to spend a night!,5.0,,A beautiful waterfront where you can walk around and take in a lot of the sights. The Marina Bay Sands is located on the waterfront and provides some of the best views of the waterfront promenade!
,,Sound & Light show worth seeing but nothing to rave about!,3.0,,"Having heard so much of the Marina Bay waterfront and the evening Sound & Light show there, we were keen to not miss it this time around, while in Singapore. The waterfront was truly colourful with the row of lights alongside the Fullerton Hotel complex showing off the tall office blocks of the CBD area on one side and the Singapore Merlion on the other. The 20 minute Sound & Light show though was less impressive than one had expected. Drawing on a laser display from the towering Marina Bay Sands Hotel the show while colourful, lacked an impressive central focal point! It was pleasant though weather wise at the waterfront."
,,Such a wonderful n relaxing atmosphere,5.0,,Loved the lazer show from Marina Bay Sands.. the surrounding atmosphere was v.inviting.Lots of foods to choose from. Loved the whole experience.An iconic landmark of Singapore.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Had a morning walking tour of the waterfront and public buildings, it took four hours but a great way to see singapore"
,,Beautiful spot to walk and admire the view,4.0,,Just loved this area.So accessable and so much to see.Stop for a coffee or a drink and just watch people go by.Good ecletic array of building types that all seem to blend.Sit and watch the water and the boats go by.place you spend hours at.
,,One of the world's best cityscapes,5.0,,"You must take in the view of the skyline as dusk descends and the colored lights of the skyscrapers begin to reflect in the waters of Marina Bay, from the Esplanade. Also lots of free concerts and shows at the Esplanade waterfront, plus the twice-nightly laser shows from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel across the Bay."
,,Not that much there,3.0,,"It is really all restaurants, bars and looking at the Marina Bay complex. Not that much to it. Go ther if you want to find some decent places that eat or have a drink. Don't go there if you are expecting to see much else!"
,,Very good experience,5.0,,"Very good experience, nice views.. A surreal feeling sitting there viewing the skyline, water, peaceful"
,,Lovely area with lots to see,4.0,,"A wonderful area and great for photos especially at night of the financial district and the bay, there are lots of eating places around the bay and a relaxed atmosphere ,and safe."
,,jan 2016,4.0,,"Nice place to see. Good awater front, must see the fountain show, it has a small story on laser projection. enjoy"
,,"Good walk, good views",5.0,,A good short walk to see the sights of the new city. Good views of marina bay and the business area always with water at hand and boats on the river.
,,Great One!,5.0,,We had a great time walking around there. It's a very nice area but if you want to stop for a drink be aware of quite expensive alcohol.
,,Chill out...,4.0,,"A nice place to chill out - walk around, enjoy the resort, flyers, little eateries, restaurants - great by day and by night."
,,Excellent view,5.0,,I happen to be there last year in March. Could not see the place in the evening however the day view itself was great. Would recommend to visit the place in the evening time
,,nice to visit,5.0,,"You will always end up somewhere on the promenade, day or night, there are many things to see both night and day, it pays to shop around for eateries, depending on your taste and what you would like to pay."
,,Lovely walk!,5.0,,"We got dropped off at the riverside park area and walked the entire promenade to the Marina Bat Sands resort area and Singapore flyer. The large Merlion statue platform, etc. a very nice walk that takes you past a lot of restaurants and a few parks. We walked both sides in the rain and it was very nice. There is a water taxi as well that looked fun. You can only get off at one stop so we chose to walk. We are glad we did!"
,,Awesome walk & experience,5.0,,"We walked the Esplanade at the harbor front by the Fullerton Hotel. It's a great experience by day and an awesome one by night. Singapore has so many out of this world architectural features and many of them are lit up at night. Plus, on the opposite side of the harbor there is an outstanding light show twice an evening after dark."
,,"Truly lovely walk at night, great photos - MUCH better than during the day!",5.0,,"Your only problems on this lovely marina side walk will be 1) keeping camera still enough (turn flash off, obvs) to get the great photos the view deserves and 2) keeping your partner happy if they're not into photography!

So much to see and take in - just don't forget to be romantic too!

Absolute must do - and free of course."
,,Great place after dark.,5.0,,After hectic shopping one can just sit here and enjoy his drink and eat great food on the Waterfront. The place has nice restaurants and some have live music at times.
,,A wonderful place to walk and relax.,5.0,,South East Asia is special. The sights and sounds makes it easy to place myself in Singapore back in the early days of it's colonial history. What a place it must have been. As long as you were English. Walking the strand along the river is so relaxing. As safe as safe can be. That's Singapore. What a pleasure. After the heat of the hot Singapore day there is nothing like a cracked spicy crab and a glass of wine relaxing by the riverside. Taking the boat tour along the river is fun. People watching and eating is the mission of the day. You can spend a few bucks with no problem but the experience is not to be missed. I prefer the smaller street hawks of Bugis Street but a night out along the river is really special and not forgotten.
,,A Lovely Area To Walk Around At Night,5.0,,"This is a lovely place to walk around in the evening with stunning views of the financial district as well as the waterfront and Marina Bay Sands. There are bars, restaurants (including Makansutra Glutton's Bay food centre) and an open air theatre with free performances to enjoy."
,,Singapore Waterfront Marina,4.0,,Fantastic area for a walk by day or night. Stunning night scene with bars and restaurants in abundance. It rained for a part of our time and even though no rain-coat it still was a great experience. A definite must do if in Singapore
,,Fun way to fill in 15 mins or so,5.0,,"The light show along the Singapore promenade is fun if you like to be outdoors enjoying the cooler evenings.It is a beautiful display of coloured lights splashed across the buildings that line Marina Bay,best viewed looking across to the Marina Bay Sands hotel as they have a laser show coming from the top of their hotel.It's on every evening at 8 and 9 pm and if you are down near the Merlion you will hear the music that goes with it.
We stayed at the Swisshotel on Stamford with a harbour view and had a wonderful view of the show from our room as well."

,,Nice and beautiful view,5.0,,"We love this place. A must come as you do not need to pay anything for the light show. I always enjoy light show that are longer, and this meets my expectation. Colorful light show. and relaxing at the same time."
,,"Perfect for chilling out, enjoying the sunset and people watching",5.0,,"There are always lots of people hanging/chilling one one of the many benches, seating areas at the Waterfront Promenade. It's decks are so long and wide that it never feels crowded. Just sitting there and watch walkers, bikers, skaters and Segway-ers pass by is a relaxing pastime."

,,Promenade strolling,5.0,,"This walk around the waterfront is worth doing especially at night. What you can do is watch the laser show from the marina Bay sands side, then walk around to the other side where the Merlin state is and watch it from there. For me that is the best as you will see the whole Marina Bay Sands hotel and surrounds light show must better than the small water laser one in front"
,,A lovely experience,5.0,,We went to the promenade for the daily music and lights show and it was great - we've been to Disney a few times so it's not the first time for laser shows etc but this was really good. It's free and there was plenty of space to sit and watch the show
,,Wonderful at day and night,4.0,,"I walked along the promenade on the first morning I arrived In Singapore. From the helix, clock-wise. and then the same route again on my last evening, after the sun went down. Walking around it takes quite some time, maybe 2 hours or so. If you have a short layover, lots of time to kill, or want to go jogging, this would be a good place to go. In the morning you can observe all the business people rushing to work, enjoying a relatively quiet promenade, sitting down here and there on benches along the water, grabbing a cup of coffee or tea. In the evening it becomes really colourful, and it's filled with tourists, enjoying the lights and the cool(er) Singapore weather. The area around the Merlion Lion is ALWAYS crowded, but there is also a Starbucks and a bar/resto to sit outside, under tastefully arranged lights."

The Event Plaza holds a light and sound show called “Wonder Full” daily at 8pm and 9.30pm with an additional show on Fridays and Saturdays at 11pm. “Wonder Full” is a display of lasers, searchlights, video projectors, fountains and a sound track. This show is absolutely free and is not to be missed."
,,Awesome views & beauty.........,4.0,,"This has got to be the best place in Singapore ( at ground level) to catch the awesome beauty of modern Singapore . Especially at night, where the amazing lightings on the buildings/surroundings creates a vibrant & beautiful contrast against the vast dark sky & background.

The iconic Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort (MBS) stand so beautifully in the background & the majestic Merlion spouting water into the sea, & the promenade is being ""surrounded"" 360 degrees by many awesome skyscrapers, Singapore Flyer, 5 Stars hotels, huge malls & the unique 'Durian' Esplanade theatre.

Would recommend coming here both in the day & night as the experience & atmosphere are very different. Take the River Cruise if you like to move closer to MBS, etc.

There is an interesting night Laser display from atop Marina Bay Sands hotel- think only on weekends & at about 8-8.15pm.

Take the MRT to Esplanade station. Once on street level, one can easily see the skyscraper offices/ MBS in background. Start your walk from here towards there. You will see the sea, MBS, Esplanade, Merlion on the left of the promenade walk.
The other nearest station is Raffles Place but it is easier to find place from Esplanade station."
,,Beautiful skyline,5.0,,"Singapore has one of the best skylines I have ever visited. A nice walk from Marina Bay waterfront all the way to One Fullerton then to Esplanade takes about an hour of super relaxed and short stroll with frequent stoppages for phototaking.

Why Esplanade the last stop because it has free outdoor music that you can revel in if you want! Not only that, there are nice bars and restaurants over there that you can visit if you are hungry or thirsty!"
,,Beautiful at night,5.0,,This is one of those places you can spend the day shopping and the evening eating and taking in the night lights. Well worth the time spent here. The prices are a bit steep but that is what you pay to be a tourist.
,,"Lovely Views, great walk, lots to see...",5.0,,"Get a real taste of the new parts of Singapore, surrounded by excellent architectural wonders of Singapore; Clifford Pier, The Fullerton Hotel, The Esplanade, to Marina Bay Sands and fabulous food at every point. I recommend this as a evening walk due to the wonderful lights and cooler temperature.."
,,A great place to enjoy the city scenery,5.0,,"This is a good place to take a walk especially at night. All those lovely city lights that shows the robust city which grows in prosperity. You will also be able to catch and experience Southeast Asia's largest light and water show. It is a 13-minute showpiece of visual effects by the waterfront, where the universal tale of the journey of life is told through the use of electric light and laser effects. Showtimes are at 8pm and 9.30pm, don't miss it. They have a third at 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays. Don't worry about the price because it is free of charge.

Do ask around if you are uncertain and I am sure most will be willing to show you the way."

Be warned - this is the main tourist hub and you'll have to jostle people out of the way if you want a picture with the merlions!
,,Nice too see,4.0,,"Youve got a nice view off the whole marina bay complex. Many people come together @ 8pm and later ( i think 9:30pm ) again to take pictures and enjoy the lasershow.

,,Always Spectacular View,4.0,,"The light, laser show, and water show are all spectacular. Always a nice view and vibe around here as you can see Merlion Park, MBS, Esplanades. Safe place for walking around with your friends, families, or your loved one. This is one of the must visit place when you come to Singapore. Anyway, it’s like all connected.

,,Stunning vistas,5.0,,"I am not generally a great fan of cities, but the waterfront promenade around the Singapore Harbour is so dramatic one can't help but be mesmerized by its surroundings. The elegant, sleek buildings soar into the sky with glamour and pizzazz.

The impeccable quality of this city is highly evident from the promenade."
,,Another man-made attraction,4.0,,"The ambience is laid-back and relaxed. Lots of locals as well as tourists come to the promenade to eat, walk and just get out and about. The laser light show from the Marina Bay Sands hotel was not very impressive, even though we had heard great things about it."

,,Great Way To See Downtown Singapore,4.0,,"This area has tons of hotels, shops, and the merlion. We went during the day and at night. I would suggest seeing everything at night when it is lit up and you can catch the laser light and fire show from Marina Bay Sands Hotel. This is also a great picture opportunity. We saw tons of boats floating by in the bay at this time, so maybe you can kill 2 birds with 1 stone and look into a night time boat ride through the bay."

,,place for watching the light show at night,4.0,,"a fine spot to watch the light show at night. If you watch the night light show from the Sands, you will miss the Sands itself, so there's nothing much really, despite the Sands being the tallest iconic building around. So this should be the top spot for it."
,,Expensive Food,4.0,,Just crazy food and drink prices around here and not great quality food for some. Be careful. We got charged and extra 20% for tax and service. I refused to pay it as it was not noted on the menu. Bad luck for them. The food was disgusting this was a Chinese run place by the Lion near the underpass. Don't go there.
,,A nice place to stroll at night,4.0,,It's a nice place to go to in the evening or night. I recommend that you do this the first day you land in Singapore i.e. when you are tired and don't want to talk too much. There are food stalls offering juices and ice-creams. There are even full-service restaurants. The flyer is nearby so you can just walk down to it to get on it.
,,more beautiful at night,5.0,,great place for photography. don't forget to stay for the light and water show. every night 8pm & 930pm. but you cannot see both at the same time. for the light show u have to be across the marina bay as the laser lights are from the roofs of mbs.

Laser light shows provide a Disney glamour to this vista. Upper end shops line the ground floors of the hotels in the area.

,,Nice walkway along the river,3.0,,The waterfront promenade is a long nice walkway along the river. It was nice to walk in the evening to see the lights. There are nice restaurants along the promenade with the view of the river.

,,Night Show,5.0,,We went there for the free night show with music and lights that they have everyday. We coupled it with another night show that goes on in Gardens by the Bay. The Gardens by Bay show starts 30 mins after this ends. The show here was definitely better amongst the two. It is advisable to get in early and find a nice spot to look sit and enjoy the show.
,,Best Place for Night Hangout,5.0,,Waterfront Promenade is a pretty cool place for evening hangouts.

,,Highly lively place to visit,5.0,,"stopped by here a few nights running as there was a concert and gig going on, but even without any of those, it is still a very happening place to go, and the scenery is very futuristic with all those fancy tower blocks all lit up.
on of my simple highlights was a dancing water fountain show with lights and music followed by a projection video on to mist created water fountains to give an almost holographic effect to it....works really well actually as well.
be warned that this is not a cheap part of town and the bars and clubs can easily charge £5/£10, S$10/S£20 for a pint of beer, but if you shop around you can still find the Hawkers and street stalls selling cheap food for a reasonable £2.50-£4 S$5-8."
,,"Get out and walk, especially in the evening.",5.0,,"Even though it's hot in Singapore, the evening walk on the promenade should not be missed. The architecture, and especially the lighting are inspiring. Live music is easy to find. Anywhere you eat in Singapore it's good food, too.

,,Bursting with life.,5.0,,"The waterfront promenade is a fantastic area with many many bars and restaurants which over looks the marina area. It is spotlessly clean and is the perfect area to watch one of the twice nightly light shows.
During the day it's not overly busy and you can take a relaxing walk along the promenade and take in the sites, have a drink, something to eat or you can take a water taxi from here which goes as far along as the Singapore flyer and back but you can get off at various stops and get back on later.
As the evening comes around the promenade comes alive with people, the bars and restaurants fill. Then there is the light show which appears to be mostly at the opposite side of the marina so you are in the ideal viewing spot.
Great experience."

The Marina Sands Bay Hotel will be in front of you accross the bay. There are laser shows at 8pm and 9.30pm and also at 11pm some days (please check with your hotel or the internet).

,,Top Tips!,5.0,,"The waterfront is great during the day or night!
The light shows start @ 8:00pm make sure your on the lionfish side looking at the hotel. For the Best Views.
You can also get a water taxi these are about $15 and will also take you to watch the light show @ no extra cost.

If you want a top tip, the sky deck is quite expensive for what it is @ the marina bay. So rather than paying for a tourist ticket, simply dress smart and go to the bar.
You get an alcoholic drink for the same price of ticket! Plus all the views!
The desk to ask is at the end of the tower.
Just make sure your 18 plus and have ID.
If you want to eat you can have a seat with a view.
This is information I was given by a local guide."

,,Beautiful part of Singapore,5.0,,Absolutely beautiful. Lovely to walk around or sit in the evening just to relax. There was a lovely breeze there too which was a nice break from the heat!
,,Nice and romantic,5.0,,"Beautiful and a must. There are water shows everyday at 8:30 and 10:30 PM if I am not mistaken. They are fun to watch but not really my taste (found it super kitsch). But at least it's free and it's a nice distraction.
All the restaurants and bars on the promenade are super expensive but if you have the means, the setting is worth it ;)
The walk is agreeable and romantic."
,,Pretty promenade,4.0,,"Walking here reminded us of walking on London's South Bank - a mix of old and new style buildings, and we had the nice grey weather to match it (we came during monsoon season). It's a nice walk and worth doing."

,,Comparable to Sydney Harbour views!,5.0,,"If you are looking for fantastic views of a modern metropolis city, this is the place to visit.

Best experienced at night when its cooler and the lights reflect off the watery canvas. Its a circular route that takes in the modern (MBS, helix bridge, esplanade) and historical (singapore river, collyer quay, old post office at fullerton).

You dont need to join a tour, the sights are free and a leisurely stroll ard the circuit takes about 3-4 hours.

Most pubs and restaurants around the area are naturally expensive (this IS the heart of the cbd cum tourist hotspot after all) so my advice is to pack a picnic and enjoy the views before you continue."
,,Great place to visit at night,5.0,,The water front of Singapore is amazing. I recommend going to the gardens at marina bay at dusk and the visit the waterfront at night
,,Clean and Entertaining,5.0,,If visiting you must walk the Promenade. A good selection of food stalls in the food market. Stay for the lights at night and be amazed.
,,The landmark of city,4.0,,"You can find this place just in front of merlion statue. The night landscape was more beautiful compared to day landscape. If you like to take picture or selfie alot, you should visit this one."
,,Picturesque View,5.0,,"This place gives you the best view of Singapore waterfront. Awesome place to click photographs with such a wonderful background, both during the day and night."
,,Perfect for an evening stroll,5.0,,"A truly impressive view by night, cool and easy to walk. Start at Marina Bay Shopping Mall viewing gallery by the water to see the musical fountain show with fireworks at 8p.m. daily. Then walk past the super-luxury Louis Vuittton shop on the water, then the Art Science Museum shaped like huge lotus, then cross onto the colourful curly Helix Bridge to the promenade along the water's edge on the other side. Stroll all the way to the Esplanade, then on to the Merlion. If it's a Saturday or Sunday evening, there's free music performances at the outdoor theatre at the Esplanade at 8.45p.m."
,,Stunning area by day and night,5.0,,"We arrived in Singapore at night so went to the waterfront for a walk. It was very beautiful as all the building lights were on. We decided to do a boat ride around the marina, highly recommended. We also made sure we caught the marina bay sands laser show pretty much every night at 8pm onwards.
The following day we visited the waterfront in the day, and it was very nice especially when the sun came out. There were plenty of restaurants and little stalls selling drinks and ice creams, even towards the evenings had locals practising tai chi.
You can't come to Singapore without a walk around the promenade."
,,The wow factor,5.0,,"Such an amazing place to visit and take great photos. Does getting busy during the day and at sunset, however, worth the experience."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I first visited Singapore in early 1964 and I have been back dozens of times since, but I never fail to be enchanted by its waterfront promenade. Although no longer a working waterway I still find it fascinating.

Much has changed, many former landmarks are gone, replaced by new landmarks 50 or so storeys taller, but it still charms. The shophouses that line its north bank remain and the area between the promenade and the City Hall was undergoing a complete transformation and upgrading for Singapore's 50th anniversary celebrations. I look forward to our nnext visit to enjoy the completed works."
,,Atmospheric cross-cultural city centre,5.0,,Great centre of the city which combines the old with the new in terms of architecture and history.

,,great views of Marina Bay,4.0,,Nothing much to do here but to look at the amazing buildings surrounding Marina Bay. If the heat is too much you can go into the Marina Bay Sands 'Shoppes'.
,,necklace of attractions,5.0,,"The waterfront promenade creates a continuous route along the waterfront and links up the necklace of attractions at the Marina Centre, Collyer Quay and Bayfront areas. Visitors will be able to interact, stroll in the mist, play in the fountain or simply soak in a panoramic view of the Bay from any spot on the promenade. The paved and landscaped promenade forms a key pedestrian link between the developments at Clifford Pier and the Marina Bay Sands. It also acts as a viewing platform for events in and around Marina Bay."

,,Lovely shopping and eating,5.0,,It has a great shopping centre with many nice restaurants and cafes as well as access to Sentosa island.
,,Make sure you see the Light Show,4.0,,Was a nice place to chill out and enjoy the city skyscrapers lit up at night. Was a busy area but didn't feel like I was crowded which was nice. Make sure you come at night to see the Light Show - extremely spectacular.

,,Waterfront Promenade,4.0,,Definitely locals and tourists favorite area. Very pleasant to walk specially at night and when the lights from the buildings starts to come up and the cooling breeze coming from the waters. Whatever time of the day and night there will always be people walking around.
,,Visit at night,5.0,,"Fantastic place to walk round from Marina Bay to the Fullerton. Cooler in the evening with slight breeze, the lights, buildings and buzz are are captivating. Locals gather by the promenade and walkways to pass away the evening and an enjoyable way to pass the time it is too..

Saw an excellent Fireworks display on the Saturday evening, the Singapore 50th celebrations based around the waterfront will no doubt be impressive."
,,3.5 and 8k options - great for early morning run,5.0,,"Typical city skyline run but without having to push through walkers, runners and cyclists..... Quiet and peaceful way to take an early morning run with an inspiring backdrop."
,,Pleasant walk,5.0,,"Liked the pedestrian bridge, the Lotus Flower and the ponds with the beautiful lotus flowers, the solar powered fans, the clever floating platform with the soccer pitch!"

,,"Your bags are unpacked, what now?",4.0,,"This is one of those ideal 'first day in a new city' activities where you may be feeling a bit tired from your flight, unsure about the layout of the city but keen to just get out of your hotel and start exploring. The waterfront promenade is a great way to stretch your legs, gain your bearings and take in some of the iconic views of the comparatively new Marina precinct. You can take a long walk from the Marina Bay Sands, via Merlion Park to the Singapore Flyer. Or fairly much all points in between, Promenade MRT or Bayside MRT on the circle line are both good access points. If you're not so keen on walking there are numerous watering holes and restaurants where you can pull up a chair and watch the world go by. A great way to start your Singapore adventure."
,,great views,4.0,,"Had a good evening here. Easy to get to. Great views of the Merlion, Marina Sands (looked great as the red moon shone bright between 2 of its towers), reasonably priced restaurants. Well worth a stroll, nice and relaxed."
,,nice sights,5.0,,You can eat at a nice restaurant or take a lunch with you and take your time strolling along and enjoy a relaxing saunter while you enjoy the view across the riverside.
,,Nice stroll after work or to end the day,5.0,,"I worked in the Central Business District (CBD) and used to stroll here after work to catch some breeze; it's great for that. It's windy in the evenings (a great comfort for sunny and humid Singapore), there are bars and cafes nestled along the bay, and you get too see the classic Singapore skyline-- the Esplanade on the left, then the Marina Bay Sands, and on the extreme right the new financial district known as Marina Bay. As a Singaporean, it's perhaps one of the views in my country I'm really proud of having."
,,Experience the BEAUTY,4.0,,"You can sit and chill there for hours. Really! It's so well planned and beautifully executed, with a weather like SG, you can go there every single day :)"
,,Pleasant stroll by the river,4.0,,"Nice to stroll by the river and take in the sights as you go, the high-rise buildings of the CBD dwarfing the older colonial buildings, Merlion Park, the bumboats plying their trade on the river and it's equally nice at night, with all the bright city lights twinkling and the laser show from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. We saw, and heard, as we walked, a wonderful Jazz singer called Melissa Tham performing a free show at the outdoor theatre on the waterfront, much appreciated by the large crowd who'd gathered to listen. Just one of the special moments Singapore can often surprise you with.

It's sometimes a little bit fresher down there with the cooler air coming off the water, no bad thing at all in a Singapore July!"
,,enjoy and relax,5.0,,one of the best places to hang out and relax or do some sport. there is also a great spot to get some food.
,,Poor light & water show,2.0,,I wonder what the hype was all about. The sound quality was very poor. I donno wht they were trying to show through various images on water. There was no story or theme. Over all a very poor light sound and water show.
,,Stay for the Light Show,4.0,,"The Promenade is great to walk or run along, make sure you visit at night and stay for the light show! You can grab take away from the food hall or eat at one of the cafes along the water but to get a great view of the light show sit at the amphitheatre."

,,Great Promenade,5.0,,"Beautifully thought out, nothing to dislike. Like all of Singapore it was scrupulously clean and well presented."
,,Just ok to walk with the view,3.0,,"Good for watching MBS show and for a eve walk, but very small place, they have many dining options from chili crab rest and some chinese fine dining dim sum to spanish tapas and Starbucks, but be aware, those places close pretty early, only Starbucks is 24 hours around!"
,,Great views especially at night,5.0,,"Great views and photo taking opportunities are abundant along the waterfront.

You can go for dinner first in one of the huge number of restaurants nearby and go for a walk along the waterfront to walk off those calories.

The views have changed in the last 10 years. The marina bay sands complex plays a prominent role in the background now.

A light show arnd 8pm can be seen from the sands complex so it's just right for after dinner."
,,Breathtaking at Sunset!,5.0,,Few city skylines have this impressive an effect when the sun is going down and the lights are coming on. Have been there to see this many many times ... it just keeps drawing me back!
,,At your Leisure,5.0,,"As with all great cities that come alive at night the Waterfront promenade is a dazzling sight to behold.From the lights along the Helix bridge to the rising spaceship that is Marina Bay Sands. Meander your way along the route that links all the attractions around the bay. At any point a great photo will ensue. The promenade gives you direct access to the Big Wheel, the merlion fountain and the beautiful gardens of the bay, just to name a few. Your leisurely stroll at any time of the day or night will have you experiencing the panoramic views."
,,Top spot,5.0,,"Beautiful, clean and great atmosphere. Visit at night to catch the laser light show. We sat right near the Merlion and had a great view."
,,A Walk on the Waterfront,4.0,,"This was within walking distance of our hotel, and well worth the effort. Very crowded at peak times especially around the Merlion. Also worth taking a boat trip while you are there, which will drop you off at the big wheel if you like. Get the hop on hop off bus back."
,,Good Sights..,4.0,,"Again one of those touristy things you would do, is take a walk by the river and see the lights of Singapore. It is good for a leisurely walk in the evening probably end it with a light show in the end. I would still recommend taking a bout tour to get a different feel of Singapore at night."
,,Nice waterfront view,3.0,,The venue for National Day Parade. A nice place to just sit and chi chat on a cool evening or night.
,,Great views of much of Singapore !,5.0,,"Magic night time light show on the water, an amazing convergence of light, music and sound. You should go to experience Southeast Asia's largest light and water show !!"

,,A wonderful stroll during the evening,5.0,,"An easy, engaging and enjoyable stroll from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel (tip - take the MRT to Harbourfront) right around the bay to the other side of the harbour mouth near Marina Square. There's a nightly light show and heaps of people-watching along the way."
,,Great food,4.0,,Some really nice restaurants around this area. Take a stroll around and when you're done go on the boat ride to see the sights - sit outside - nice breeze. The only thing I didn't like is the service. Singapore was always renowned for great service but this generation seems to have missed learning about that.
,,If only Singapore weren't so humid!,5.0,,"Our friend from rural Australia his Chinese wife, who live very near the equator in an industrial & manufacturing Provence, coped better with our walk around the stunning waterfront promenade than we did, as we are unused to such enduring humidity.
Singapore is certainly the showpiece of Asia & this promenade a great opportunity to see the marina bay & waterfront shops & museum."
,,"Great place to walk, eat and shop! Good views too!",5.0,,"Great place to walk, eat and shop! Good views too! Inexpensive local stall type eating places that are good! Try the Chicken Rice or kabobs. Lots of people eating the crab dinners. Looked delicious. Early evening a nice breeze off the water and not hot even in late June. Great place to snap some wonderful pictures. So safe in Singapore you can walk anywhere without concern. No cons at all. Just a delightful, casual, inexpensive evening."
,,Night walk best???,4.0,,"Singapore city skyline is a delightful sight. Add to that the Marina Bay Sands, and the ArtScience Museum on one side, and the Singapore Flyer on the other, you really do have a world class viewing spectacle,

In my opinion the promenade is best at night - take your camera and tripod, and afterwards grab a satay at the nearby markets. On the night we were there there were various live performances as well.

Great photography - great atmosphere."

,,Nice walk at night,5.0,,"Even just walk around at the waterfront promenade alone at night, it's safe and a lot people there. Got live music, see the fireworks and Wonderfull show at night."
,,amazing promenade,5.0,,Its incredible what clever thinking people can produce on reclaimed land. An awe inspiring walk. Go at night and watch the light show at marina nay sands. it's free and well worth the crowds to watch.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Stunned by the beauty of the merlion, jurong bird park and the fountain of wealth, this is a place where you can rest, wonder and be at peace with your inner self especially in the night. Spectacular lighting and the beauty of diversity of the location where travelers from across the world visit this place. The boat journey was amazing."
,,High End Waterfront,5.0,,"Clean, safe, popular place to go day or night. It's mostly high-end shops and restaurants but the views of the city around the waterfront are world-class. Nice place for an afternoon sightseeing walk or a business lunch but there's not much else to do here if you're not interested in shopping.

Excellent location for people watching."
,,The best of Singapore,5.0,,"The waterfront promenade at Marina Bay has been my most unforgettable visit in Singapore so far. It was a deeply calming experience to lounge on the stairs leading to the promenade and stair at the Singapore skyline and the extraordinary array of buildings framing the arc on the other side of the waterfront. Starting with the Singapore flyer and the double helix bridge, the arc has the Marina Bay Skylark hotel with its inimitable canoe spanning three vertical buildings and a range of other bank and financial service offices leading all the way upto the Fullerton hotel and the Merlion. I went by around 6 and waited till the lights came on the buildings at 7pm. One can never forget the awe and wonder that is felt when the skyline comes ablaze and the waterfront glitters with the ambient light from the buildings. I had to tear myself away from the waterfront when it was time to leave. Hope to return to the waterfront several times during my stay here."
,,Take a walk,4.0,,"I believe the best way to see a city is to take a walk and walking around the Waterfront Promenade was no exception. It was well worth he experience! You see much more walking than being in a coach/taxi etc. However, when walking in the tropical heat and humidity ensure you have plent of water to stay hydrated."
,,Pleasant Place,4.0,,"The Promenade is a great place to wander around and people watch. Of course there are activities and sights, but the best part is just checking out all the different people -- tourists and locals alike -- who come to spend time here."
,,By day or night,5.0,,This is a great place to stroll by day or by night. There are lovely views across the water and I like the mix of old and new buildings that can be seen. Plenty of places for a drink or some thing to eat too.
,,Disappointing,4.0,,Totally disappointed. I enjoyed the place over 20 years ago. Progressed has removed the charm of the hawker stands and infused the area with expensive fine dinning hot spots and very little character
,,Nice view and walking promonade,4.0,,"Very nice place to walk, relax and enjoy the view of Marina Bay Sands and the financial district. Also the Merlion, Singapores symbol, is located there. Along the walk you will find a lot of bars and restaurants. Parking facilities are nearby"
,,Incredible Views,5.0,,"This is the place to be for all photographers as well as those who just like to take in the beautiful sights. The laser show at night is a little disappointing; however, don't miss it. The skyline is truly something to behold."
,,Atmospheric,4.0,,"Whilst the live pop music was very loud on the waterfront, it was a truly wonderful atmosphere to see so many people enjoying themselves in the warm evening air. Bars are everywhere without any trouble of misbehaving. There are laser lights onto the marina water and lots of eating establishments. Added to this is a good view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel which, whilst not attractive to me, does give you the opportunity to view it close up. I would visit again during the evening time but it is too hot for me during the day time in that area."
,,That view,5.0,,Those skyscrapers are awesome. Promenade is a lovely place to chill and take your time. Lots of runners around it though.
,,Waterfront walk,5.0,,"This is a must visit when in Singapore, beautiful walk along the harbour foreshore, brilliant buildings in the background for some great photo shots, stunning in fact. The architecture is amazing and plenty of restaurants for a enjoyable lunch. Highly recommend it."
,,Trip to Asia June 2015,4.0,,"You must go in the evening there are several light shows, at 8pm, at 9pm and 11pm. So if you miss one just plan the next one. Very nice effect with water and lights and lasers and fire."
,,High-end products shopping,4.0,,If you are looking for some place cool in Singapore this would be it. It is definitely a shopping mall but they have taken it up a notch. All international high-end brands are there. The place has great aesthetic and architectural value as well. It is conveniently near the MRT station so no worries.
,,Must visit,4.0,,The must visit place when arrived in Singapore.Nice place & perfect view to took photo.Easy to buy a drink at near by kiosk.
,,Great place to experience the Marina Bay - City Skyline,5.0,,"This is centrally located at the Marina Bay area, which is bounded by Marina Bay Sands, Fullerton, collyer Quay and the new skyscrapers at Marina Bay Financial Centre.

You can walk around the whole bay area and the path is rather flat, so you need not worry about climbing up and down stairs.

Around the promenade, you can experience different city skyline views.

Best time to visit is the late afternoon, where you can enjoy the scenery in daylight and when the sun sets, the glittering lights from the buildings around."
,,Light Show,4.0,,The light show is amazing! However don't stay at the front row or you will get wet! I got wet a lot! Nearby you can take good pictures with the night view.
,,Wait until after sunset,4.0,,"Getting there early, just before sunset and waiting for the MBS light show is well worth it. Nice atmosphere."

,,walked along quietly and at slow pace,4.0,,view most charming water ways pleasant views and good walk ways would go back when in city again with no hesitation
,,Great city skyline at night,4.0,,"It's great just to wander in this area. You can walk through the Marine Bay Sands complex, window shop in the likes of Louis Vuitton etc, eat at one of the cafes outside the mall, see the bright lights (I think the lights on the underside of the 'boat' on top of the MBS change colour!) see the Supertree Grove lit up an the two eco domes. There is also a bridge with lights that change colour."
,,SYMBOL OF SINGAPORE,3.0,,Its the symbol of SINGAPORE . It symbolises Singapore as a tourist spot. Its a great place to take photographs. The night view is just mind boggling .
,,Spectacular views and great food,4.0,,"A fantastic place to go for an evening stroll.

With perfect views of Marina Bay and many shops and restaurants along the promenade its a great location.

If you want to capture a photo with the Marina Bay hotel or the Merlion then this is the place you need to go.

There are many restaurants, food places, stalls to visit on your way along with a variety of dishes - western, Indian, Chinese, Indonesian, Singaporean etc.

Really nice atmosphere."
,,"Beautiful and relaxing,",5.0,,"It is so nice to walk along this waterfront as it has lots to look at,,,and take your time doing it,,,it is very beautiful at night,,"
,,Beautiful to Walk Around,4.0,,Its beautiful to see but not amazing. No need to spend more than half an hour walking in that area. It shows you the bay but there are several other ways to see the bay. Such as on a boat or from the Skypark.
,,Pleasant walk,3.0,,Pleasant walk along the waterfront to see the Merlion and also the Skyline. Starbucks has great outdoor seating right on the waterfront. Wait until dusk when the Merlion and other buildings are lit up
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,What a magnificent area of Singapore. Went during the day and wish we could have gone at night. A real pleasure.

,,Great 9:30pm show,5.0,,"This is a must when you're at Singapore.

What's great about it is, it's absolutely free.

You just need to be there before its show schedule. We were there by 6Pm. We had our dinner at the Marina bay Sands resto then by 8pm we headed to the waterfront. While waiting for the show, you can also enjoy the view since the sun hasn't set yet. At Singapore, sometimes the sun sets at 8:30 pm.

It's an Amazing show! It will start to get crowded by 9pm. Make sure you get there early to get the best seats ;)"
,,Impressive waterfront,5.0,,We walked along part of the Marina Bay promenade in the early evening. It is a spectacular visual display and makes for a very enjoyable walk. I would recommend visiting the waterfront in daylight as well as in the evening to get the full effect and to plan some time to really enjoy the promenade and gardens.
,,Nice place for a walk,4.0,,"The Promenade is a huge open space for a bit of outdoor hanging out. It's great especially if you're a family with small children; you can let them run around in a safe open space and wait for them to wear themselves out. The Singapore skyline is also pretty awesome from here, especially at night."
,,Easy walking area.,4.0,,"For a slow down of pace, this area has food and drink for every taste. I like the icecream in bread from the icecream man for $1 and to sit and watch the world go by."

,,One of My Favorite Runs,5.0,,"If you'd like to run, take a long walk or bike ride in Singapore, this is your path. It's world class. You can run on the Formula 1 track part of the way. Its is around 5 km long and most of it is tree lined shade, so if you can't make it TOO early, don't worry. It connects up with the Marina Bay promenade, heritage route and riverside opposite Boat Quay, so you can extend up to 20 km r/t if you want. Its all on hard even surfaces and there are toilets and places to buy that bottle of water you may require."
,,awesome place,5.0,,Beautiful place.. just stroll there in the evening. Have food or drinks or just simply walk dere. Garden by Bay is in that same campus
,,As expected,5.0,,The waterfront was undersome work however it was as expected. Lined with pubs and restaurants - a perfect place for bar hopping and walk in the evening.
,,"Great views, good place to hang out",4.0,,"A must do for Singapore: the place to be, so it can be very crowded.
There are varied areas around it from the glitzy and near empty Marina Mall shopping mall to the floating soccer pitch where we watched an amateur game, to the very quiet eastern side.
Eating places around it, and in city centre generally, are way over priced in my view. I couldn't wait to get back to the local food stalls for cheap and excellent Asian food."
,,Skyline is the word,4.0,,"Nice view of the skyline!! You will find pubs, casinos, mall all in here. More-so marina bay towers looks fascinating. Can visit it at any time of the day & looks equally happening."
,,best veiw of Singapore,5.0,,"well, this is the best place to take a walk or jogging along the reiverside with best sunrise or sunset view to entire views along the road. you can relax at the bars or restaurents at outdoors at MBS enjoy a beer or wines with freiends after works or brunchs with family, love it!!"

,,Lovely place to be,4.0,,"Ideal place to be in the evening. Plenty of pubs and cafe's to eat. You can walk all the way around and up to the quays.
If you are lucky on the weekends they have live music bands around. Small food street tucked in as well."

,,Beautiful way for time pass,4.0,,Liked everything about it.. Cool breeze nice place to hang out beautiful view of the singaporean skyline
,,one of the most photographed place,3.0,,"you are not come to Singapore yet, if there is no pic of you here.. Its Free, nice place, but crowd.. especially in holiday season. The good time to take pic is around 9 to 10.30 (good light for picture)."
,,Spectacular view,5.0,,"Panoramic view of the Marina Bay Sands, the Singapore flyer and the Helix Bridge from the Merlion Park. Stroll along the waterfront if you need a leisurely walk. Several eateries to fill your stomach if you are hungry. Best time to go is in the evening when most buildings are lighted up."
,,Nice stroll along local restaurants,4.0,,This is a nice walk but be prepared to be hassled every five steps by restaurant waiters and waitresses who try to lure you inside
,,Visual spectacular. Decent,3.0,,"The Singapore flyer , Merlion etc is all around here. Though its a architectural spectacular and has dazzling light shows at 1945 daily it somehow did not awe me. Period.
It is however a grand affair with laser lights from right on top and other light shows. Viewing it from the merlion side is probably the best place.
There is no fee.
Cheers !"
,,Great place!,5.0,,"Take a walk by the water, check out the skyline, see a free show at the waterfront auditorium, get a bite to eat or a cocktail..."
,,Small skyline,4.0,,Small skyline not that high but it does stay as one thing to be seen in Singapore at night. Very beautiful view on the marina bay building.
,,end of cruise,5.0,,we walked here from hotel good view of Singapore river on way to merlion park plenty of shade on the way
,,Lovely Serene sight,5.0,,A brilliant location with the sights and a serene calm spreads as you spend more and more time. The place comes to live by sun down when all the lights are on. Take the flyer to get a bird's eye view of the city.
,,What a joy.,5.0,,"We went for a walk around at night, we visited some stalls. We felt safe walking around at night in Singapore. We just took our time and enjoyed our walk."
,,"Great Nightlife, expensive food and drink",5.0,,A great way to spend an evening walking along the promenade people watching and watching the ferries going back and forth. Food is over priced but that is Singapore for you.
,,Where Merlion and historic SG is,3.0,,"You got to go, it's where the city's symbol, the Merlion is.
You get a up close look at the Merlion and can take good pictures of Mirana Bay Sands from across.
But... the Sands really blocked ocean view from the promenade if you ask me."
,,best view in singapore,5.0,,I love!! Spend a little time walking around marina area is a great kind to see the city. Don't miss the free show in esplanade waterfront theatre. You must go to Makansutra Gluttons Bay to eat the famous chilli crab...cheaper than the others place in singapore and fabulous. Enjoy waterfront!
,,great walk up the waterfront,5.0,,"full of restaurants and eateries some cooking fresh food in woks in the street venues , the only thing i didnt like was the constant pestering of the various restaurant owners and workers , to eat at theirs and when your walking down a strip of them and theres a lot of them it can be a patience tester , very busy bustling street , but if you sit at one of the waterfront tables decked out in fairy lights , its quite romantic"
,,Relax,5.0,,Nice to chill out here and relax. People watching and nearby shopping. It is beside the river and you can see Merlion.
,,Nice ambience,4.0,,This is one of the best sanitized waterfront areas anywhere in SE Asia. In the evenings if it's not raining it has good breezes and many nice cafes cheek by jowl. We Italians love al fresco dining and the waterfront is full of such wonderful places. The stillness among so many diners can only be broken by the rude loud laughter of tourists.
,,Joys in Singapore,3.0,,Still in greening process. More shades of tree would help. Good setup to wait for the outlying ferries though.
,,PEOPLE WATCHING,4.0,,"Great area to go at night, lights very magical. You can have a full meal at one of the many options of just drinks and nibbles. Find a bar with live music and sit back and enjoy"
,,See the City from Water,4.0,,The Boat Ride is very interesting and takes you round the waterfront & The tour is also hop on & hop off. We got down in 3 places and we could have taken two three more stops if we had time. Overall it gives you a different view of Singapore.
,,Take a wander,5.0,,Take a wander along the waterfront and take in the sights. Makre sure you visit the Gluttons Bay food stall area - satay to die for!
,,Pleasant place in the evenings,3.0,,"The Waterfront Promenade is an open wooden-decked area next to the river and provides a nice place to just sit, relax and take in the views. Evening/nights are better since the weather is cooler and the brightly lit skyscrapers provide a colourful vista. The best thing is the Marina Bay Sands laser show every evening at about 8 (check detailed timings). The promenade is the best place to view it. Best suited to rest for some time after sightseeing, before entering the Shoppes at MBS for shopping or dinner!"
,,Nice walk around the bay with a lot to see,5.0,,I liked to be near the water with an amazing weather and all those nice buildings to look at. There are several place to have a drink or eat something around the bay.
,,Great evening stroll,5.0,,"Definitely visit the promenade in the evening to get the best views and experience. See the lights from all the hotels, Marina Bay Sands, super trees at Gardens by the Bay. Great during the day too, but our favourite place in the evening for a stroll."

,,"A wonderful walk from the city centre, past the Cloud Forest etc. back to the city",5.0,,"This is about a 6 km walk right around but well worth the effort. The waterfront has some lovely restaurants, amazing shopping centre if you are rich, rich and water views. There are places where you can stop, sit down and relax. We did it to catch the sunset. It was quite busy with joggers, bootcamps and other walkers but still very laid back."
,,Clean and Fantastic !!,5.0,,Good place to capture the Icons of Singapore. Your visit to Singapore would be incomplete without this. This is very good place to walk. Have multiple options for nice restaurants. Waterfront Promenade offers extensive views of Marina Bay Sands and the business district high rises. A place you would like to spend more time and relax.
,,Great place for a free romantic date:-),4.0,,"Looking for a place to bring your date and on budget? Well this place is free!! You can even bring your own food and drinks and just sit here since they have a big staircase for you to sit down have a drink and enjoy the view. I been here lots of times, 3 times with friends and four times with my husband. We love going to this place in the afternoon and wAit for the sunset. Lots of tourist here but it's big enough to accommodate lots of people.
The marina bay sand will offer a free show twice a day, 8 pm and 9 pm show. The laser lights are spectacular!!!

This place is free, and you can stay here as much as you want.

Relaxing, peaceful and great scenery."
,,"Great way to kill time, take a walk.",4.0,,"I enjoyed walking along the promenade in the evening, checking out the lights of the city and some people watching. I found the restaurants there to have slow service and high prices. I chose to use the promenade as a running route in the early AM, and it was an excellent choice. Enjoy the sights of the river, a few early morning boats and other runners and walkers."
,,take time to take a stroll,4.0,,Be prepared with drinking water and good walking shoes. 35 degrees is hot so keep that in mind. Beautiful sights. Expensive waterfront restaurants.

My wife and I prefer going in the evenings to watch the light show and enjoy the cool evening breeze. If you go to Singapore, you should definitely give this place a visit."
,,Waterfront,5.0,,"The Waterfront was a nice area to stroll around,and a great place for photos. You could see the Marina Sands Hotel Complex with its very unique top and the Science Museum that is like a mini Sydney opera house but shaped as Lotus leaves. The waterfront is also a good place to people watch and soak in the culture."
,,Lovely area to walk regardless of day or night,4.0,,"There are plenty of eateries, bars, shopping, places to get out of the humidity. Not the cheapest of places to go, but definitely worthy of checking it out."

From our Marina Bay Sands hotel, it didn't take long to walk around the waterfront, to the awesome Merlion statue, Clark Quay etc.

A must to visit during the day and at night and there are a selection of restaurants to choose from. On one particular night as we were strolling by they had a couple of guys playing music on their guitars and singing which was great. Little things like this really make up the atmosphere.
,,Modern and stylish,5.0,,"An architectural jewel, modern and surrealistic. Great place for walking, shopping, skating, jogging, resting or just for admiring the great view of Singapore's business district and the river"
,,Interesting day and night,4.0,,You can enter the waterfront from a number of areas and it's an interesting walk by day or night. The Art & Science Museum is accessed via the waterfront and you can walk across the interesting helix bridge. If you make the complete loop you will also see the Merliion. I'm not sure what the big draw of this statue is but it is an icon of Singapore. The waterfront is quite beautiful at night as the helix bridge is lit up as is the MBS hotel and the museum. There is a little light show on the water. If you can only go once I would say make it at night. If you go by day bring lots of water (electrolyte water is best) and a bandana to wipe your face as it's hot and humid.
,,Luxory walk,5.0,,"The walks along the waterfront were very nice especially at night. The buildings were impressively, especially the Hotel Marina Bay Sands with the intergrieten shoppingmal. In the evening there was a laser light show. We have also made a cruise. Is also worthwhile."

,,Great place to see the skyline,5.0,,"I was most impressed with the buildings in Singapore, and this is the place to see them. There's the world's largest ferris wheel at the end of the pier, and vistas on both the financial district and the newer hotel district. A must see."
,,A really good location and to visit,5.0,,Part of the recent reclaimed from the sea development. Just superb. Such good planning and a real credit to the Singapore Authorities

,,Fantastic place,5.0,,"we have visited this many times over last 7 years of our visit to singapore
each time we spend atleast couple of hours
the change of colours of Merlion , the laser show in the sky , the tranquil water of the bay , the lights from buildings across the bay , the festive mood of people ( although this time the no of people were much less because of death of the first Prime minister of the country -- it is of course my guess ) , is very relaxing
It is also a very nice place to walk or just sit
we , being a little elderly , do not walk much but just sit

we shall again go and visit when we go back this september -- it simply does not become stale with us"
,,Wow !!!,5.0,,"I live this place alot !!! I can only say "" wow"" many times when i entered this place..amazing, beautiful and really excite you"
,,Lovely walk,4.0,,This is a highlight of a visit to Singapore. Evening is particularly good as the lights shine bright over the water and the views are stunning.
,,"Restaurants, Shopping and Light Show",4.0,,"This is the area more specifically located directly in front of the Marina Bay Sands Mall and offers a promenade that runs from the Helix Bridge and connects all the way around to the downtown area.

The promenade offers a wide variety of restaurants, some of which are right on the front and accessible from the promenade and others which are in the Mall but have doors opening onto the promenade.

The restaurants offer everything from 5 star deluxe to single slice pizza's and therefore caters for everybody. There was also an ice-cream shop which was great because the weather was quite warm.

There is an unique museum, perhaps the most uniquely shaped museum we have ever seen, also on the promenade, as well as a well organized boat ride which you can take to cross the Marina Bay to the other side.

As the evening sets in there is a light, water and music show which is complimentary and certainly worth getting a standing room only front position against one of the railings. They use an unusual system that creates dancing and faces and other forms and shapes from the water and is something we have not seen anywhere else in the world. They are not competing with the show at the Bellagio or the Dubai Fountains, it is something completely different and well worth seeing!

On a foot note it is safe, clean and suitable for everyone!"
,,A Walk to Remember in Singapore Waterfront,5.0,,"We enjoyed a stroll around the waterfront area taking in the sights of Marina Bay, Cultural centre and the Singapore Lion plus the myriad of ferries tooting and shuffling their way around the bay. Magic."
,,Good use of water,5.0,,"The effort was simply brilliant. The story telling and the concept deserves a pat. The light, sound and water made the show a dreamy affair."
,,lovely place for an evening stroll,4.0,,"The waterfront ambiance, and the many views of this remarkable city lent the promenade a special atmosphere that virtually begged for picture taking."
,,Great sight,5.0,,It was not too crowded and really clean. a great walk with views of the theatre and of course the Merlion
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Without a doubt, this is one of the most memorable experiences in Singapore. It's just amazing how much planning and effort has been taken to ensure anyone visiting is both welcome and comfortable. Good signage everywhere you go so - no getting lost."
,,Warm atmosphere,5.0,,"Nice place for cooling out and in the same time I liked the warm atmosphere. Like being in a small, old sea town yet in shadows of all those steel and glass skyscrapers."
,,Promenade,5.0,,"Come at dusk and enjoy a stroll or put on your running shoes and join the many sporty types. This is a very pleasant place to spend some time, to shop, to have something to eat, to sit after a long day."
,,Lovely to stroll along ona beautiful day,4.0,,Gorgeous walk during the morning. Great landmarks and architecture. Courteous and pleasant people. No unruly behaviour anywhere. Everyone looked smart albeit casual. How pleasant is that? Loved it.
,,bright and colourful,5.0,,"Eclectic array of locals and visitors enjoying the surroundings without any drama or chaos. Bars and restaurants with live music and karaoke, something for everyone, sling shot and swing for the kids and kids at heart, beautiful views and so many options for eating for every budget"
,,Absolutely marvelous,5.0,,"Views all along are unbelievely amazing. Architectural landmarks (Marina Bay Sands hotel, The Fullerton, Downtown skyscrapers) are staged and put in display as you walk.
Everything is upscale and nice. Up to the hand railling which is architecturally sophisticated and flower beds now and then.
Really worth the walk."
,,Very pretty,5.0,,"This is quite a walk from one end to the other,but it is well worth it. Watch out for cyclists but they are very courteous."
,,easy walk,5.0,,Easy walking viewing the waterfront. The light show on the water was a little disappointing. The display of lights was great
,,just too good,5.0,,the place is just lovely with some excellent dining options and some good places to shop for high fashion stuff
,,Perfect for a morning run or evening walk,5.0,,"The waterfront promenade is beautiful! We spent a portion of each day, usually morning or evening, jogging or walking the promenade. Either way it's the perfect way to get a view of the scenery Singapore offers - from the financial district to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and background gardens. Taking a boat tour is a great way to take in all the sights and promenade as well. There is a nice amphitheatre north side of the promenade that had live bands (classical music) playing a few nights during our visit so definitely check this out as well."
,,Excellent place to be in for a evening stride.,4.0,,Me & my spouse loved the evening stride and a close walk we had at the place. I always cherished and liked the waterfronts which has clear water and nice scenic view all around the globe. So another feather to singapore's amazing attractions.
,,See the water exhibition,4.0,,There is a great water and lights exhibition at night. It is worth seeing but get there 30 minutes early to get a seat!
,,The place for excitement,5.0,,"This is such a great place to visit - whether just for a stroll to see the lights of Singapore at night, to meet friends, go to dinner or dancing. Wide variety of restaurants and cafes with open air seating, taking advantage of the lovely night time temperatures. Everywhere there are coloured lights and I felt very safe. A few Persian restaurants had belly dancers performing for customers in the outdoor area, but passers by could see them as well. All the bridges crossing the river are lit up at night and it's really magical. Clarke Quay has an enormous outdoor area with sail shades up high from building to building, so protected from the sun or rain. Whatever the weather, you can still go out and enjoy yourself. There is also a large ground level fountain with hundreds of water spouts, good for keeping cool on hot days."
,,Exciting and great range of things to see,5.0,,"Loved it. So vibrant at night with lights and sounds. There was a carnival feel about the place. We went there on my birthday for a seafood feast and bumboat ride and were not disappointed. Range of restaurants to choose from was a little overwhelming but we managed to find one and ate right on the river side. Be prepared for the final bill as there are additional charges we didn't know about. Service charge and GST. Had my one and only Singapore Sling there at $16 which I thought was a bargain compared to the $26 at Raffles Hotel! Overall, food much more expensive in this area but for one night or two, well worth it.
Bumboat ride is a must do and recommend it at night when all the lights and colours are on show. Great perspective of the city from the river. Thoroughly recommend to do the cruise with the light show. You pay an extra $5 but well worth it as it takes you to right in front of Marina Bay Sands and you get a waterfront view of the laser light show they have at 9.30pm. Just magical. Lots of places that sell bumboat ride tickets from so spoilt for choice. You can't not do the Waterfront Promenade when in Singapore."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,A great place to see the skyline of Singapore and to people watch. Easily reached by public transit and full of restaurants as well.
,,Worth the plane fare all by itself. A must see,5.0,,"You can't help but enjoy Singapore's waterfront. There are shops, gambling casinos, hotels, and restaurants. It costs next to nothing to get there and you can stroll around for hours without being bored. They have light and sound shows three times a night. (Definitely go at night). You may want to visit the top of the Marina Sands hotel for a view from atop, although they do charge for the lift."
,,Good place for a relaxing walk,4.0,,"After visiting the Cloud Forest, Bay sands, etc, its a good place to just stroll around and watch the bay area and glittering lights. There are many restaurants and cafes to spend a good evening."

,,Great Views,5.0,,"Well worth a walk around the promenade, great view of the all the landmarks especially at night. Lots of joggers so be vigilant or you will get bumped"
,,A great Evening at Waterfront Promenade,4.0,,"We were lucky visiting Singapore in February when the Chinese New Year celebrations were going on ! Just dropped in after visiting the Singapore flier in the evening, as it is a short walk of a couple of minutes. And the Waterfront Promenade was just there in all its grandeur, with lighting, stage shows, and with all the scenic beauty of the surroundings, besides the nice cool breeze ! A place not to be missed."
,,very clean,5.0,,The waterfront promenade is very well maintained. Its just adjacent to Merilion & Fullerton hotel. It has lot of eat out joints with lots of coffee shops & a chilling beer with frnds would be lovely. Also a lazer show is conducted everyday at 8pm.
,,Pleasant walking,4.0,,It is good ambling along the marina waterfront but at the end of the day it is just a place to wander along and take in the sights. There are places to eat and have a drink but the thing I'll remember most was the ice cream sandwich we got from a street vendor for SD1.50 - bargain. Have to say I thought the light show a bit disappointing.
,,An amazing place,5.0,,"A great place to walk, at or just relax and enjoy the sights. This is a very safe place no matter what time of night or day."
,,Nice place to relax,5.0,,"Just find a nice place to sit and relax, while enjoying a drink and the fantastic view of the bay and the marina bay sands hotel just opposite. There is a stop point to catch a boat down Singapore river right in front"
,,Great view of skyscrapers and Marina Bay Sands.,4.0,,"Totally a must in Singapore. Many skyscrapers, Marina Bay Sands. Always busy, vibrant. Don't miss the daily light show at the Marina Bay at 8.00pm or 9.30pm."
,,Worth a Walk,5.0,,The city planners have certainly done their homework judging by this waterfront. We strolled along and stopped to have a drink and just do some people watching. The lights of the city at night are beautiful along with the reflection in the water. The bridges are lit up at night and look absolutely stunning and there are observation platforms all along the bridge. We watched a beautiful bride and groom have their wedding pictures done. Well worth the stroll especially at night.
,,Beautiful sunset walk,4.0,,Avoid the walk mid-day because there is limited shade. Morning or late afternoon is best. It's a must do in a city that has undergone spectacular development over the last decade and the waterfront stands out with Marina Bay nearby.
,,Excellent Promenade fro Evening Stroll.,5.0,,"We love to arrive early before dinner and observe the traffic throughout the whole area. The Waterfront Promenade became a destination for tourists, a meeting place for lovers, and a get-together for a drink for business men. Therefore the traffic of various crowds converged into the site was a sight to observe. There are several dining outlets in the Esplanade. Therefore the activities in the promenade last through out the evening. For the younger crowds, there are several night light and fun games carry on throughout the area."
,,Waterfront,5.0,,We visited the waterfront by day & by night and it is much more beautiful at night The Merlion is wonderful lit up at night
,,Time for festival,5.0,,"We went there at the end of february and suprisingly there were a festival for chinese new year. Many folks were there for taking photograph, jogging, enjoying scenery and of course trying a lot of street food. The chinese themed decoration itself became the most interesting object for taking photographs. And the street food there will be heartwarming for the cold night."

,,There you understand how Singaporeans keep happy,5.0,,"Do this on a Saturday night, walk along all the canals/rivers of Singapore with the many, many restaurants. Watch out for tourist trap restaurants, read the reviews first."
,,Take time to stroll,5.0,,"This is a need area (aka Go Down)...very cute, restored historic buildings with nice variety of restaurants and shops. A must go"
,,Spectacular - worth a visit,5.0,,"We had spent the day in Gardens by the Bay and had dinner at Satay by the Bay so our day was off to a flying start and anything would have been difficult to top our day.

We walked across the walkway which led into the shopping centre that faces this waterfront. We heard that there was to be a laser/water show and we were in for a pleasant surprise.

It simply was spectacular with lights and images being projected into enormous sprays of water. This show went on for about 30 minutes but the best part was that it is absolutely free.

If you are in Singapore make sure you time a show into your day. You wont be disappointed."
,,City Planners get an A+,5.0,,Promenades matter and this one rates right up there. The promendade gives one a 360 degree feel for the entire bay area. It is wide and wonderful. Take the time to walk it!

,,Excellent place for photos,4.0,,"It is necessary to come at 20:00 and 21:30 to the Merlion and to watch show of fountains and lasers. And of course to make photos on this background. Unfortunately, there are a lot of such people in this time."
,,Take in the atmosphere,5.0,,"Took the waterfront on a number of occasions on our trip. Always seemed to be something going on. Sound and light show on the water, yacht racing in the harbour, people watching from one one of the bars. (only gripe was bars on waterfront did not serve Tiger, only imported beers...why?)"
,,Chinese new year,4.0,,"Visited and had a few drinks on New Years eve. Lovely atmosphere, great laser show. Drinks were pricey but they are everywhere. China town cheaper for alcohol"

,,A decent walk,4.0,,"The waterfront promenade runs from the city centre out to the Singapore Flyer, alongside the river and Marina Bay. It is a great place to get views of the city skyline, and those interested in F1 racing will have fun spotting the red painted corners which form part of the circuit. The promenade effectively ends at the Pit Building alongside the start\finish straight."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"Loved it! It's the best place to have a walk in the evening, if you are fond of jogging it's even better. For those who would like to exercise or for those who like to sit down and relax enjoying the spectacular city views.. So basically everyone can come down and appreciate some time here."
,,The Happening Place in Singapore.,5.0,,"There is so much to see and do in Singapore. A walk around the Waterfront Promenade is well worth the time and energy. Wear comfortable shoes. If you get tired of walking, find a Taxi stand and line up and find a ride. Singapore also had an efficient, cheap and easy to navigate MRT system."
,,Anytime Superb views,5.0,,"Views are stunning whether day or night. Good place to have a romantic walk after dinner, excellent views and this place is always kept clean. There is always some crowd walking, jogging, relaxing, hugging.

,,Cool place to hangout,5.0,,"We walked along the promenade, taking in the sights of this awesome location.

But make sure you are off the boat on in position for there light show.

You will find bars, restaurants to cater for every taste and budget, ice cream stalls and coffee shops, some thing for everyone. Although there are always lots of people milling around it never seems busy which is probably because of the laid back pace here, the only people moving faster than a slow amble are the countless joggers.

,,my views,4.0,,"a place to roam around. very huge. the aquarium is very huge with rare variety of sea animals. Chance to see the jelly fish of different variety. Star fish, had a chance to touch them. Rough body. The most central place is just like to relax and see the various variety of fishes moving as if playing for you."
,,nice stroll,5.0,,"A little hot and humid if the weather is nice but nice bars and cafes around if you get thirsty ;) Never crowded if you just want to relax, especialy if its raining."
,,New Year's Eve,5.0,,"Although we spent time here for most of the days we were in Singapore, we never saw the water show apparently running every night. But we witnessed the New Year's Eve fireworks which was beautiful and very well organized. Pleasant area suitable for strolls and running and just walking and enjoying the beauty of the city."
,,Beautiful day or night,5.0,,"As all the other reviewers have noted, this place offers up some splendid nighttime scenery. I came here both during the day and night and find them both equally good. The only thing that compromised the experience was bad weather, but that cannot be helped.
Just keep an eye out for cyclists and other pedestrians - it can be a little bit messy at times."
,,A lovely walk,4.0,,"we walked all the way around the waterfront, Marina bay and back up where Fullerton is. It is a long walk but well worth it to see it from all sides. At the bottom, the city side are rest areas with shades and even fans. And it works."
,,Relaxing,5.0,,Very pleasant area from which you can see the free water/light show at 8-30 pm outside the Marina Bay Hotel. Well worth a visit
,,Night view,5.0,,Water show to be viewed from the MBS side at 8pm. Lightning show to be viewed from the merlion side at 9.30pm. Its free. Come early to take a long walk around from the merlion to MBS.
,,nice evening,5.0,,We have a walk around the promenade after dinner. The atmosphere was fantastic. There was live music and the weather has cool down a bit made it even better for a walk. The beautiful Marina Bay Sands is right in front of us and the Merlin is on the other side. It's really relaxing.
,,Good place to walk down,5.0,,Great place to walk across the waterfront and you can walk down from Clarke Quay to Merlion walking on the side of the waterfront. Its a good track for the joggers. I thoroughly enjoyed.
,,A wonderful walk!,5.0,,"Day or night, if visiting Singapore this attraction is a must. Built right on the city harbor this outdoor walk is attractive, clean and a great place for picture taking in this city / state. Do not miss the newly opened Waterfront Promenade of Singapore."
,,One beautiful evening,5.0,,One of the best attractions in Singapore! Came here one evening after spending the whole day touring..it was relatively early but the place was already swarming with people. We enjoyed the lights and the music and would that we can come back here sometime in the near future with the children..
,,Great evening visit,5.0,,"The best views and magic is after sunset. But get there a little beforehand for a ""perfect"" picture of the Singapore skyline (tip: best photos are right before the sky gets completey dark). This can be a romantic stroll, but we had our grown kids with us. The light show (projected images on a water curtain with music) was definitely worhwhile. There's also a light show at the Garden by the Bay, but I wasn't very impressed with it (lights up and down the Super Trees), so I'd recommend you skip that since the timing overlaps the better light show at the Promenade. There's also the Helix bridge (also great photo ops at night) nearby. And of course, there's all the high end shops and Casino (bring your passport for free entry if you're non-Singaporean) - worth a look just for the sake (unless you're made of money, then you can shop to your heart's content)."
,,Take Time for A Stroll,5.0,,There is so much to see with all of the new construction that is reshaping the waterfront in Singapore. Looking across from the old historic city to the new Marina Bay with the Merlion spouting is a lovely setting.
,,beautifl,5.0,,"a great place to walk around, to sight see, enjoy a bite to eat/drink and to shop...The scenery/waterfront is great...when using the bathroom, make sure you bring your own bum wipes, only one western toilet..."
,,wow,5.0,,"So clean, and peaceful. Creaky lovely. It's a wonderful area and well worth a visit.""....."".............."
,,A wonderful place,4.0,,"I found the promenade a wonderful place to sit and people watch, letting the world go by. I love Singapore!"
,,Colourful evening,4.0,,After the complete sight seeing once must just sit beside the Merlion and enjoy this beautiful light and sound music giving a perfect bliss
,,Good outing!,4.0,,"A wonderful place to be at in the evenings, where you can just enjoy a walk in the evenings with friends or just enjoy some live music performance in the vicinity!"
,,Light show at 8pm every evening,4.0,,"The Marina Bay is indeed very impressive, especially when the light show takes place, at 8pm every evening. I was expecting a bit more though, closer to the Belaggio in Las Vegas, but although simpler, it is still a nice show to watch. For me, the most impressive part was getting up on the boat on top of the buildings and watching the view from up there - well worth the 23 dollars per person to get there"
,,Just Beautiful,4.0,,"Beautiful! Walk here at night and you got a really nice vibe of singapore with all the buildings,lights, and the people. Enjoy the waterfall performance at about 21.30 pm at front of the shoppe. Very nice."
,,Stunning views,5.0,,We walked around the Promenade from Marina Bay shops to visit the Merlion. The walk was stunning and it was great walking in the shadow of the massive skyscrapers with the fantastic view of the Marina.
,,waterfront promenade,4.0,,A great place for photo op...also a wonderful place to watch the light shows at Marina Bay Sands. The tranquility of the surrounding makes for a great stroll at night.
,,excellent night stroll,5.0,,"The view is spectacular! great restaurants, great shopping! water taxi available to cross the bay if desired. A must see!"
,,Just walk the area day AND evening - brilliant!,4.0,,"See the glamourous modern high-rise buildings mixed with the architecture of old Singapore. Sit, eat and drink (drink can be expensive but there are cheaper options to look for!) and watch the world go by or take a break and nip into the air conditioned shopping malls. Walk the full ""circuit"" from the river around to Marina Bay. Take a boat cruise and see the sights from a different perspective. Do all this and then go back again in the evening time."
,,Good view,3.0,,I guess it's better viewed at night. The architectural designs are great to look at. It's good to exercise and walk around and marvel at the beauty of this city. It was also here that I tried Wall's ice cream.
,,Walk and enjoy!,5.0,,"We spent some time walking, sightseeing, and enjoying Singapore. Walk with no particular plan, and take in this entire area. It is a good way to explore Singapore."
,,Relaxing Promenade,5.0,,"A calm and relaxing promenade awaits you after you end your experience on The Singapore Flyer.

Depart from the Flyer area and walk straight towards the Promenade whereby you will see joggers or passerbys. Just gaze at the harbour or walk leisurely to take in the harmless strong winds. You can see the Gardens by the Bay in the far distance and that make you wonder what is that beautiful attraction appealing you to visit.

If you feel like a meal or snack or drink there are cafes nearby after a stroll.

Sunset is my best time to take in beautiful relaxing Singapore even though the busy financial district is nearby."
,,What a feat! Vive la Singapore!,5.0,,A production that must make all Singaporeans proud. The water and light show is unmatched by anything similar anywhere in the world. You have to see it to believe it. No cost to it. A 20 minutes treat at Singapore Government's expense.
,,Brilliant place!,5.0,,Fantastic atmosphere both during the day and at night. So much to see and do - could have spent days in that area alone!! Well worth a visit.
,,Beautiful during the day...stunning at night...feels very man-made,4.0,,"The Waterfront Promenade in Singapore reminds me a bit of Dubai but better. It feels very man-made (and is) but it is also absolutely beautiful. Whether viewing from a rooftop bar, hotel across the way or driving through the city, it is worth checking out anytime you are in Singapore."
,,Amazing view of Singapore lights from the bay,4.0,,"This is a very nice spot to view Singapore in the evening.Skyscrapers , and the amazing view of the Singaproe River , Marina Bay Sands Hotel could be viewed here.
At night ,a scheduled wonderful light show will illuminate the bay.Its free , and should not be missed."
,,Great views,5.0,,Great views of singapores attractions. Many photo opportunities. And good exercise opportunity. Restaurants also gyro ice nice views
,,Good,4.0,,"Should go there once in evening on your trip to Singapore. Walk by the waterfront, enjoy the cool breeze and views"
,,Great place for a stroll,5.0,,"I love going for a walk at the Waterfront Promenade and applaud the city for developing this area so well. It is a popular place for exercise enthusiasts and when the weather is a bit cool in the evenings, it is a lovely place to spend some time."
,,evening show,4.0,,"There is lot to do in evening but one must try out show .Its amazing
and in open you can enjoy with family and can observe from hotel marina bay as well.colours were soothing to see and figures were seen in fountain which was again beautiful."
,,First time at the Promenade,4.0,,"Although we have been to Singapore many times nevere ventured into Marina Mall before - Its Huge , has a lot of the Expensive shops But also some great (reasonable) eating places including a great dumplings shop. Go try Go see - Not just for shopping and the Arts and Science Museum nearby is worth visiting too"
,,City centre stroll,4.0,,"Start at the Merlion statue and just stroll around the marina. The walk can be exhausting in the heat of the day, but there are numerous places to stop for refreshments. Plus some shade is provided by the taller buildings of the city, and you can cool off in the Marina Bay Sands Mall. The Mall also has a very good hawker food centre. The Merlion is also a good place to start a walk of the Singapore River. In the evening there is the free light show, which is very pleasant in the cool of the evening."
,,A boatride through the waterways is a fantastic way to view the waterfront.,5.0,,"A night boat ride through the waterway is a classic way to view Singapore Waterfront. The harbour is lined with restaurants and shopping areas. If you want a closer look, try a pedicab ride. You are taken through Chinatown and the quaint little streets that run down to the waterfront."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Nice area to walk around and take in the different views. However, the light show was disappointing."
,,Plenty of places to eat and drink,4.0,,"A pleasant place to spend a day or go early evening for dinner and drinks. Lovely views of Marina Bay, The Sands Sky Park and the Singapore Flyer."
,,A Touch Of History,5.0,,Love wondering along here admiring the statues and reading the history. Nothing to dislike along here.
,,A must-see in Singapore,4.0,,"A trip to Singapore isn't complete without a walk along the river — the best way to gape at architectural marvels like the Marina Bay Sands, the ArtScience museum, and the Esplanade.

The river walk is lovely by day, but dazzling at night. My advice: go twice."
,,Fantastic at night,4.0,,"We went out on a boat ride to see the lights, water and laser show and it was amazing! Defo worth a visit either by boat or you can view the show from the promenade. Bring your camera or phone and take pics as the show is amazing. Music and lights and buildings change color and the lasers across the river. It only last 10/15mins but defo worth stopping by at 8pm. Its on daily."
,,Incredible view at night!,5.0,,"We hesitated to go on this side of the bay as we were staying at Marina Bay Sands and that the view from there was spectacular, but for the last evening we decided to give it a try and went to see Merlion the famous emblematic statue next to the Fullerton hotel, and that was a great decision!!
the view of the bay from the waterfront promenade is incredible at night! we took at least 50 photos... each nicer than the other...
the view of the hotel, the museum and the big 'wheel' are really nice.
It gives another dimension to that bay! plus there are bars and restaurant around.
We recommend!"
,,Very nice area to walk around!,5.0,,"In true Singaporean style, this enjoyable area is fun, clean, green and pleasant for walking and taking photos of the lovely skyline. Don't skip this area, even if you justspend a short time there!"
,,Loved it,5.0,,Night walk on the promenade is fantastic. Just have some ice-cream or Gelato and walk around in the night breeze
,,Entertaining,5.0,,"A great place for an evening stroll. Watch the fountain display, eat at a restaurant or just sit and watch the world go by. Very relaxing."
,,Easy and Enjoyable Walk,4.0,,I spent a couple of hours walking around the waterfront promenade and take pictures. It is very clean with plenty of walking room. There are resting areas along the waterfront where you can stop and take breaks and enjoy the views. The only area that was crowded was around the lion statue.
,,Beautiful. Magical.,4.0,,Was at Singapore early this month and this was my first actual touristy thing done here. Sitting near MerLion and watching the magical light show that starts at around 8 I guess. Source is Kudeta I believe which is a high rise night club that I ventured later on during the evening. Must visit at night. Pick a beer and watch the magic unfold.
,,Nice for relaxation,4.0,,"Really nice a place. Also the shows are great with the water and laser light, quite thrilling. Would recommend the show (they got a Time schedule for it)."
,,Very lively place,4.0,,"Its a nice walk at the waterfront promenade and you get a very good view of the city high rises as well as the Marina Bay Sands. There is a nice laser show from Marina Bay in the evening, which you can enjoy from here as well.
You will find a lot of tourists here and its a very lively place, with some options to have a quick bite."
,,Must go...must see,5.0,,"Day or night the walk around the waterfront is certainly worth the effort. Best to avoid the middle of the day because of the heat and make sure your camera battery is fully charged! Easy to get to on the MRT and at night time it is absolutely amazing with the light show and all the buildings floodlit. You can combine it with visiting the shops at Marina Bay Sands or, if you want to lose your money, there is always the casino.
There is the brilliantly designed helix bridge and on a clear day you get a glimpse of part of Indonesia.
We went twice - daytime and again at night. During the day there was a youth percussion band playing with great enthusiasm and obviously enjoying themselves. You will get good views of the Merlion and the skyscrapers of the financial district. There is a good mixture of old and new architecture with the old colonial style post office ( now a hotel) and the ultra modern Marina Bay Sands hotel. There is even a floating football pitch!

Definitely recommended ."
,,Great City Views,4.0,,"I walked from the area around the Singapore Flyer to the Esplanade Theatres on the Bay. A nice, leisurely walk with front-row views of the Marina Reservoir, Marina Bay Sands, the ArtScience Museum and the city skyline. There are plenty of places to stop for a drink or a meal - from food carts to upscale dining. I went during the daytime and there were walkers and joggers enjoying the promenade."
,,Nice place to stroll and take family,5.0,,Lots of places to eat and stroll. Every ethnic food is represented and food in Singapore is amazing and good. Day time it's dead but at night it is spectacular

,,Great Place for an Evening Stroll,4.0,,"The Waterfront Promenade is an amazing place which you can visit for free in this expensive city. The nice architectural designs of the surrounding buildings provide a good photo opportunity anytime of the day but more colorful at night. The free laser light, fire and water show is a big treat. Cheap but good dining options are available in the nearby hawker market."
,,Great place for an early morning walk,4.0,,"This is a great place to see the sights of Marina Bay. I walked early in the morning just before sunrise and the rising sun is awesome off the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. In addition, there are no crowds at that time and it is otherworldly."

,,Amazing light show,5.0,,"the waterfront is a great place to have lunch , watch the sun set or even sunrise if your up that early. I was there for this spectacular light and water show, it was amazing. Good place also to just chill with a book or some peaceful time alone"
,,A lot of action for free,4.0,,"We went uninformed for an evening stroll on the Waterfront Promenade and enjoyed great views of the city by night and the architecture around the bay, a free concert, a stunning laser/water/fire/light show. The atmosphere was really enjoyable. We only regret eating in a restaurant, when a hawker market was just around the corner, with much cheaper and delicious food (there was room for a desert :D)."
,,Nice place to spend evening,5.0,,One of the best place in Singapore to relax in evening. View is amazing treat to your eyes. Laser show is must to see.
,,plenty to see,4.0,,"Lovely atmosphere especially at night when it is cooler.
Laser light show was well worth the watch.

Almost as much for ice cream.
There are plenty of easy walking areas and jogging tracks."
,,Nice stroll lots to see,4.0,,"Probably nicer in the evening when its a bit cooler but we loved our walk along the waterfront.

Lots of nice col shaded areas to sit and relax and a host of small cafes, restaurants and bars en route."
,,laser show madness!,5.0,,"the waterfront is an incredible treat to disconnect with the craziness of the heat and city. Go at night, to see the city in lights, and DO NOT miss the laser show (which, is utterly amazing).!!!"
,,Work,4.0,,I enjoyed the walk along the river most nights. They are doing some building work near Clarke Quay but then again when isn't there building work going on in Singapore.
,,Have to agree with others,4.0,,Worth the view. High tech business district with matching infrastructure. Nuff said.think it was designed for tourists this way
,,Nice place to go for a leisurely stroll esp in the evening,5.0,,Go in the evening when the weather is cool and the lights from the buildings nearby make this place an ideal place for a romantic stroll after dinner and drinks. :D
,,Lots to pick from,5.0,,"Right on the water looking across to Marina Bay, the Promenade boasts several restaurants with indoor and outdoor seating. In a city as expensive as Singapore, the prices are more normal and the selection if quite good, from an Irish Pug to Thai, fish and chips, Indonesian, pizza and on. Something here for all, and the prices are, well, pretty good, compared to others in the city."
,,"A tourist spot, and indeed it is a refreshing track for jogging and walking",4.0,,Comfortable walkway linking Marina Bay Sands to Fullerton Hotel. Relaxing and refreshing. Lots of small shops/stalls for drinks/snacks/ice-cream. At times there are performances. Quite a joyful area.
,,Relaxing walk,4.0,,The walk around the place is so relaxing and the various sights which are pleasantly well lit is a feast for the eyes. There is always so much of life and energy in this area.....even solo travellers would not feel alone. The numerous restaurants along the path make it has something to offer for every taste bud. It is always best to simply wander around the place without having any specific destination on mind.
,,pleasant surprise,5.0,,"I have to say that the walk along the promenade was so relaxing, despite the many people about, I think I could have walked all night, the stunning view helped, as the Singapore skyline is one of the best I've ever seen. we sat in the bar watching the lazer show from the marina bay sands hotel. such a wonderful place."

Definitely plan on just meandering without a destination, letting yourself discover what may be around the corner."
,,Popular place,4.0,,"Lovely place, very scenic popular at night, sat watching the light show across the bay, lots of busy restaurants. There was dance classes on in 1 area which was fun to watch, great place to take lots of pics, a safe feeling even at night with so many people about"

,,What a buzzy Place !!!,5.0,,"We tried to get into the ""Jumbo"" Restaurant , but we were in Singapore during a Bank Holiday time and it was over booked. There were other great things to do and places to eat. The whole place was buzzing with people ."

,,"Spectacular view, great memories and photos.",5.0,,"In my opinion the best way to fully enjoy Waterfront Promenade is by taking a ferry during the laser show. You can get a ferry at Clarks Quay (ticket during the laser show is bit more expensive - 30$) The trip takes about 1 hour, including 15 minutes stop for the show."
,,Waterfront promenade,5.0,,A very modern uprated prominade with adequate seating.The only drawaback was the amount of building work going on adjacent the the promenade ( new very large school being built)

,,Visit it by night,4.0,,"Waterfront Promenade offers visitors at night a fantastic and scenic view on the quay in front of Marina Bay. If possible, take notice of the beautiful Fullerton Hotel. It's not as fantastic as The Marina Bay Sands Hotel but much more of a architectural jewel in the crown of Singapore."

,,Accidental water and lights show... Catch it if you can!,3.0,,"We did not intend on going to see this water and lights show at teh water front but happened to be in the area and stumbled upon it. Quite well done on the whole, very cool images projected from the top of the building onto water spray. Images move across from one jet stream to another. Some people seemed to be watching form boats too which would be great!"
,,"Nice for a stroll, a good dinner and a drink",4.0,,"The atmosphere at the Waterfront Promenade is very relaxed with plenty of people coming there to have a good time over dinner or a drink. There is a big variety of restaurants and bars, so that everyone should be able to find something catering to his taste.

Try the river boat tour in the evening slowly cruising by the nice panorama of Waterfront Promenade."

,,Beautiful promenade,5.0,,"The views of the Singapore skyline are simply breathtaking. The show of Music, Water & Fire at the feet of the Marina Bay Sands was very beautiful."
,,A good walk...not good for the wallet,5.0,,"This has to be Singapore's sightseeing highlight, visually spectacular especially at sunset but some of the prices for drinks are outlandish....add on the ++ and your wallet will soon be empty. Singapore is now more expensive than Australia and is pricing itself out of the tourist market, especially for Asia"
,,Romantic stroll,5.0,,"Great views of the city to get to many of the sites, especially at night. Watch out for the heat during the day."
,,Nice place to relax,4.0,,"Together with my colleague I visited this place several times. Great location to unwind and have a drink and enjoy the views. If you are there at the right time you can also enjoy a firework-, light show."

,,Enjoyable way to see the core of the city,4.0,,I had a 4 hour layover in the city and ran out of the airport to maximize my sightseeing! Walking along the promenade was definately worth the craziness of getting out of the airport and making it back in time to get to the gate for the flight out. I opted for the train ride out of the airport and skipped the busses that offer guided tours.
,,amazing laser show,4.0,,"never missed this free show while you go to Marina Bay. this water-fire-light-sound show, can give you some goosebumps while watching it set the time for every 8PM and 9.30PM everyday just don't miss it"
,,Nice for walk but that's it...,4.0,,"Nice to walk along but once done that's it...too many expensive bars and restaurants nothing worth shouting home about, the light show is a major disappointment such a shame that all the businesses aren't involved and join in as the bar music plays over the music from the light show."
,,Clean & pleasant.,4.0,,Clean & pleasant with great views of the Marina Bay area & the imposing Marina Bay Hotel. Take the oppportunity to have a look inside the famous Fukkerton Hotel too whilst you're there.
,,Buzzing,4.0,,"We were there the night before the F1 race, and it was teeming with the rich and cosmopolitan set. Can be pricey, and be on rip-off-alert throughout, and you'll enjoy it."

,,Waterfront Promenade,5.0,,This area is just spectacular and the best time I think is to go there just on sunset where you see the transition from day to night. It never ceases to take my breath away with the beauty of it all and to top off the sunset you can wait until 8.00pm or 9.30pm each night and watch the digital water and fire display which even though I have seen lots and lots of times never ceases to amaze me.

All in all a wonderful place"
,,Great place to walk around at night,5.0,,"Although we were in Singapore for only 3 nights, we managed to find out way to the Waterfront Promenade for 2 out of the 3.

,,Bridge Over Travelled Waters,4.0,,"If you can get past the balmy humidity that is Singapore, and if you have a cool partner in hand, the Waterfront Promenade is a guaranteed breeze!

Take in the stretch between the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay and Marina Bay Sands. Day or night ... there are ample photo opportunities. Your starting and ending points have airconditioned malls and washrooms.

Pace your stroll but stock up on cold drinks as there aren't cold drinks stalls or vending machines along the way. But then again... there are no loos along the way too.

Sometimes, ice cream carts ply the route. But do not expect Haagen Daz.

Spy on bumboats riders doing the Singapore River, See how the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort's Surfboard eye the Esplanade's Durians. Take in the Merlion and Fullerton Hotel. People watch. Gardens By The Bay, The Singapore Flyer, The Helix Bridge, The Benjamin Sheares Bridge. The vehicular Bayfront Bridge. Yup,,, it might not be a bridge too far... but rather, a bridge too much.

If only there were buskers to liven things more. And pit stops with seats and cold drinks."

,,By bicycle is a great way to visit,4.0,,"A great way to visit is by bicycle. There didn't appear to be any restrictions, which is surprising considering regulations on lots of other activities. We could ride across the Helix bridge, by the Gardens, etc. Sure, it is hard when it’s hot, but you can cover more ground on a bike. We bicycled the waterfront while they were setting up for the Singapore National Day fireworks."

,,Enjoyable Laser Light show,5.0,,Walked across after spending afternoon at Gardens by the Bay and staying to watch light show in trees (a must do). Took lift to top of Marina Bay Hotel to take in the view then walked back to Promenade for Laser Light show and glad we did. Better and different from what we expected.
,,Great walking tour with amazing view,5.0,,"Came here during the month of March this location had a lot of free events during the night. Free concerts indoors and outdoors. Escape the heat and relax at one of the outdoor concerts and wait for the light show. There are plenty of high end restaurants and bars around the area. If your looking for cheaper options head down to the food court at the Marina Bay. Can easily spend a day here so make sure to wear a comfortable shoes.

,,Unbeatable Views,5.0,,"My second visit in the same year, and still enjoyed it immensely. I had a lovely walk after photographing the firework rehearsals from Esplanade rooftop. Also managed to get a couple more shots here. The place is safe to walk and even to do photography. I wanted to take some long exposure shots from here, so spent another hour along the promenade in very comfortable surroundings. The scenery is just unbeatable. And it's a great place to people watch and just follow the busy buzz of cars, boats, people, and lights!"
,,Magnificent lights and sightseeing can be seen here,5.0,,Walking along the Marina promenade is worth visiting. I've enjoyed the colorful lights and watershows from this area. Nice to take photos and magnificent shots from your camera. Better to arrive here in the late afternoon.
,,Great place for photos,4.0,,"Singapore is clean and organized like everyone said. And this area of the city is simply nice to walk around. When I visited ,there was someone singing at a square ,which added up more to our relaxing night in the country.

It's like : Oh that is pretty but it doesn't have a wow factor to it."

,,Lots of Construction Work,3.0,,"Difficult to enjoy a walk around the Promenade because of all the construction work going on. Large areas cordoned off, so you end up walking all the busy roads part of the way. Will be nice once all the work is finished."
,,Essentially Singapore,4.0,,"The waterfront promenade gives you access to the bay views from different vantage points. This attraction can be covered in the day or night time and is wonderful to see. During National Day (9th Aug) it is also a fabulous place to watch the fireworks.

You can also visit the infamous Merlion which is in the area. Also a great place for photographers!"

There is a wide choice of restaurants although we chose to eat at an excellent local hawker centre.

dislike: not anything yet. but yes, at the bars if going without girls, you could be fleeced into buying a cover charge or directly at the bar a pint of beer for almost SG$30. Its a rip off by the servers that time."

,,"Beautiful place, a bit too artificial",4.0,,"A really well manicured and presented walk with breathtaking views in the evening. I, being more of a nature buff, prefer things a bit more wild and not so well presented and manicured. That apart, the place is worth going to time and again especially if you prefer cityscapes. The view of the marina and the bay is awesome and the setting sun adds a whole new dimension to the view."
,,cityscape viewing,3.0,,Good place to run & breathe after an exhausting shopping binge at the nearby MBS shopping mall. Best to go here really early or in the late afternoon at Sunset to view Singapore's cityscape. There's a floating LV store here.

Some of the riverside areas are under construction but you can ignore these as these areas are not really distracting."

But what a change so far. Well done Singapore!"
,,Take a stroll,5.0,,"Lovely strolling around and just taking in the views. There is just so much you can look at that you can spend a whole day there, spent a bit of time checking out the Merlion sitting eating ice cream and strolling down past the buildings."
