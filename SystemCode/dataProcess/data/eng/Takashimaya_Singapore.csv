,,A giant department store with style!,5.0,,"Our most recent visit to Singapore, saw us once again spending a few hours shopping along Orchard Road. While there, we dropped into the Takashimaya department store to see if they had anything which we wanted to buy.
We had been to this department store several times before during previous visits to Singapore. Consequently, we were aware that they stocked quality products some of which were sold at good prices, if you happened to be there when there was a sale on. Unfortunately this visit did not coincide with a sale.
Anyway, we did enjoy spending some time in the store, exploring some of the clothing departments spread over a number of expansive floors of the department store. There was certainly plenty of quality merchandise on offer, including some departments which had a distinctly Japanese flavour.
A visit to this department store is recommended for tourists who enjoy shopping for and purchasing good quality products."
,,Loved the bookstore,5.0,,"Takashimaya is an upmarket, elegant department store with top fashion labels from all over the world (including an Asian favourite of mine, Shanghai Tang). What made it unique for us, though, during a recent stay in Singapore, was the book shop, Kinokuniya books. It is a wonderful, huge, with excellent selections of books in English and Mandarin, bookstore, where one can spend hours and hours browsing and exploring. For my boys, the biggest treasure were the shelves with Manga books (in English too!), where they found their favorite ones to purchase before they were made available in Europe. They were so happy! We spent many hours there. Highly recommended!"
,,Planning to shop but found a nice food court,4.0,,"Was there to shop but excitedly found the food court, very clean and some of great food selection, they even have a Japanese food only corner. Reasonable price and staff there quite accommodating. Will be back for sure."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"Located in Orchard Road, Takashimaya is a mall & Japanese department store. U can find all high end & street brands there, as well as a supermarket, discount area in the basement & an amazing food court & food hall. Worth a visit for some good shopping & lunch."
,,Unique,5.0,,It's not like all the other Malls on Orchard it's a Japanese owned building with a huge Japanese departmental store and many high end stores on top levels. There is always a sale on the lower levels you can find some really good bargains here.
,,Best Shopping Location In Singapore,5.0,,"Takashimaya Singapore is definitely our favorite shopping destination in Singapore.

For those that know Selfridges in London, this is similar but with an amazing Japanese tilt.

They have incredible sales at different times in the year including a massive toy sale in the basement.

My wife received incredible service from a lady called Molly in the ladies handbag department.
She remembered us from our previous trip to Singapore and was so incredible in terms of her product knowledge and customer service. A real sales lady as well. I don’t think they make people like her anymore. A big thank you from South Africa !

The food hall amazing with plenty of tasters and everything could possible want to eat.

Luggage is excellent, I bought an amazing Japanese wheely.

Bento box shopping was also fun this time. They have a great selection.

My only complaint is that they aren’t open till 12 pm every night ! They close normally at 21:30.

Can’t wait to be back."
,,One of the bigger malls along orchard road,4.0,,"This is a Japanese owned mega mall along the famous orchard road. Mega international brand names like Chanel and LV have their boutiques here. In terms of dining options, there is aplenty from your value meals at the food court to more upscale restaurants; all can be found here."
,,Lots of lovely shops,4.0,,"There's a large department store and lots of lovely shops in Takashimaya. On the higher end, but they had a sale going on when we went."
,,Great department store on Orchard Road,4.0,,"Takashimaya is a nice place to shop as the store is well laid out and very big and we can usually find whatever we are looking for.

We came here to buy toys for the children as the selection is pretty good. For children's clothing we were actually looking for a swimsuit or bikini for my daughter but found that they mostly had luxury branded ones or they were too expensive. Also I would say in general that the children's clothes selection was not very extensive. I will also mention that the store clerks in the clothing department were not particular helpful.

For myself I bought an RFID Signal Blocker Credit Card holder as Takashimaya were one of the stores that seemed to have a really good selection and held several brands. i had previously looked in Paragon and Tang's but didn't find what I was looking for. I eventually bought a leather branded one that holds 5 embossed credit or debit cards that neatly fits into my wallet for about S$33. We also bought a Bodum electric milk frother.

One of our favourite areas of this store is the basement food court which also has a fantastic bakery. There is also a Cold Storage supermarket here which is very convenient."
,,Average,3.0,,"Not unlike most other malls in Singapore, has a premium wing with all high end labels and a large Dept. Store. Had a look around but didn't shop much here, Paragon opposite it seemed much better.."
,,Amazing department store,5.0,,"The food section is really impressive. The bakeries, fruit department, sweets and ice cream are outstanding. I could spend the whole afternoon at Takashimaya and I would never get bored. It’s obviously pricy but it’s worth for the quality."
,,A place for everyone,5.0,,"SALES, Food AND PROMOTIONAL AREA on basement 2 and sometimes live shows for children. Wide range of food selection in a food court abd little stores. Takashimaya departmental store basement 1 offers promotional area at reasonable prices."
,,Lovely shopping mall!!!,4.0,,This is one of the old high end shopping malls in Singapore. They do have a very good cold storage as well. I will love strolling around Takashimaya. This time when I was there they had a sale at the basement. I got some branded makeup for very reasonable prices.
,,Disappointed this time.,1.0,,"Things changed.
This one was a one of our favourite department store, but not this time.

visited there on weekday to buy some stuff for Kitchen, it was not busy day.
There were many staff chatting not doing so much on that floor that day.
I ask for help to find a stock of the products but all I got was

""Over there.""

from two of staff from the section near by.

we understood that was not their section, so asked them to find somebody, but they did not even try to find right person who can help us.

we dropped everything we suppose to buy, gave up the shopping, cause we got impression they do not willing to sell anything there.

so moved to up stairs went to cafe instead, decided to have lunch so hopefully make us feel bit better.
but not...

The staff at the cafe entrance who was on the phone continuously, ignore us and never had eye contact with us, not even gave us a gesture ""wait for a moment, please"" or some kind of greetings.

we got tired at this stage, so just stood there like a lemon.

Few minutes later, finally the waitress came out from inside and guided us to the seat.
The menu looks fantastic, It was much more selection of the food than before.
I chose the one written ""NEW!"", and looking forward to try.

Then waiter came out and just said

""Can not order this."" ...
no why, or ""excuse me"", or ""sorry but we can not serve this today"".

He just said

""Can Not"".

so another one made us disappointed.

also maybe their cook left for home or rest or something, cause many customers waited unusually long time till get their food, even there wasn't busy at that time.

There were some ""tell tell sign"".
the first staff I asked for help at kitchen supplies floor, she had very lousy hair just like she never combed it before.
A sales person in Takashimaya...?

also that staff at the cafe entrance - she did not even look at us, on the phone continuously, totally ignore.

what's happened to Takashimaya?
The liveliness has clearly disappeared.
just brand name only like somebody wrote in their comment ..

we wish if Takashimaya written somewhere;

""we show our products but we do not sell to you here"",

then we did not have to waste our time to go there, instead go somewhere else to buy stuff.

pity."
,,店員全く売る気無し、高島屋,1.0,,"平日で店は空いていた。
キッチンまわりの商品を扱うフロアとなっている地下もガラガラで、店員は店員同士でおしゃべりしたり、お皿を拭いてるふり？程度。
コーヒーポットを買いたいが、スタッフがそのコーナーにはいなかったので、３メートルも離れていない場所で皿を見ていたスタッフに、「この商品のストックはありますか？　あそこにスタッフがいないので、誰か呼んでもらえますか？」と英語で聞いたら、
その店員に、
「それはここじゃない。あっち。」と指さされただけ。

「スタッフがいないからあなたに聞いたんだけど？」と言ったけど、再び
「あっち( ""Over there!"" ) 」　と言われた。

そちらの方向に一緒に歩いて行って誰かを探してくれるのかと思いきや、その気配全く見せず。
仕方ないので、キャッシャー方面に向かい、周辺でスタッフ同士で喋っていた店員に、同じ質問をした。ここでもまた、

「Over there! (あっちで聞いて）」と一言。

”売る気ゼロ店員”たちの対応が、あまりにバカらしく思えたので、買おうと思って手に持っていた他の商品達もその辺に置いて、そのフロアを出た。
高島屋デパートの商品が売り物で無いなら、最初からそう書いておいてくれれば、わざわざここに足を運ぶ無駄もなく、別の店で買い物する時間に充てられた筈。

買い物は諦め、憤慨した気持ちを切り変えて、同じ高島屋内にあるカフェで遅めのランチをしようと移動。
ところがここでも、入り口で出迎えを任されている店員が、私たちが来ても会釈もせず、携帯電話の相手と会話し続けた。
目を合わせようとも、「ちょっとお待ちください。」のゼスチャーもなく。
呆れてボーッと立っていたら、ようやく気付いたのか、店内から別のウェイトレスが出てきて対応。
以前より内容が更に充実したメニューに目を通し、「NEW!」（新メニュー）と書かれた一皿を楽しみに注文したら、しばらくしてから店員が戻ってきて、
「これは注文できません。」と言われ、変更を余儀なくされた。

？？！！

ヤル気なし。高島屋店内

そう言えば最初にストックのことで聞いた店員も、髪がえらいボサボサだった。
一流デパートだと思っていたが、まともな人材不足なのか。
それ以外にも店内にはフラフラしてる手持ち無沙汰の店員がたくさんいた。
これだけの人員のお給料払うの大変だろうに。
儲け過ぎていて売る必要がもう無いのか、それとも近いうちに倒産でもしちゃうのか？
誰も気にしてない状況が、変な印象を残した。

何回も使ってきたが、今までにない酷い体験。
貴重な時間を無駄にされたので、本当は一つのポイント評価も付けたく無い。

Do not waste your time in this place.
In the Kitchen stuff floor, there are many staff but I got impression that they are not friendly, not willing to sell the products, not help to find a stock or find the right person for you. (they did not even try)
it's a big pity they wasted my time."
,,Brand names only,3.0,,This is a really fancy mall filled with a lot of designer brands...not much offerings for those seeking not to break the bank buying things. Also a bit confusing to navigate...or maybe I just didn't explore it enough?
,,good Mall,5.0,,"Takashimaya Shopping Centre offers the ultimate shopping experience on Orchard Road, with over 110 specialty stores spanning across 6 levels of shopping .I Enjoyed shopping in this mall it for everyone. The toliet was clean and not crowded."
,,Stores Galore,5.0,,"Our hotel on Orchard Road was very close to here so we shopped here a few times and yes we did get a few bargains.
There are stores galore with quite a few restaurants and cafes too.
There is no smoking inside or out the front of the stores which is always good if you are a non smoker.
Toilet facilities are kept in a clean condition."
,,A very confusing mall.,2.0,,"Sorry... but this mall is very confusing. I mean.. its nice... its big... but i think its a large department store more than it is a mall.. few stabd alone concept brands and the whole property is mostly just their own department stores. You can pretty much find all the brands here... cosmetics... bags... shoes... but they're all department store like. Which means... a few models and sizes per brand here and there. But u dont see complete lineups. Mostly out of atocks or sizes for shoes.. whether for adults or kids.

Also... some places are not connected to some... so i kinda find this place confusing."
,,Great place for the whole family - very baby friendly,5.0,,Taka has everything for everyone. The toilets are clean and they have diaper changing facilities & breastfeeding room for mommies with little ones. There is also a huge variety of food for people with different tastes or budget.
,,Luxurios,4.0,,Excellent place to buy luxury goods. All most all global brands are available here. It is always full of visitors. Very bright and vibrant place. Neat and clean. Must visit.
,,Big Mall on Orchard Road,4.0,,"I have been to Takashimaya Mall on Orchard Road, Singapore, multiple times. It houses most of the well known global brands , including some of the luxury brands.

The mall is always buzzing with people because of it's locational advantage.You will almost always find what you are looking for ,with choices."
,,Favorit store,5.0,,My Favorit Store in Singapore! All can be found in the garment and household section! As well the food outlets are excellent!
,,"THE place to go to, if you have no idea what to get",5.0,,"I have periodically patronised Taka since the time it opened in Singapore. I dare say I have hardly been disappointed whenever I come to get something, whether for myself or as a gift. And when I don’t know what to buy for presents, I will think of Taka, and I will almost always get something suitable. That’s how amazing this place is. Things are not on the cheap, but variety and quality will be what you get here.

Of numerous malls in Singapore, Taka survives well (Yaohan closed, John little closed, Robinson’s consolidated, Isetan is treading gingerly, Metro is hanging on the fringe, OG is afraid to expand) despite sprouting malls, shops and online shopping in the island. This speaks something BIG of this shopping centre."
,,One good Japanese Mall with humongous Departmental Outlet,4.0,,"Takashimaya is located in prime location of Orchard Road, use circle line to reach this place. They have 5 floor of departmental store which offers you every thing by everything i meant everything. Its bit crowded on weekend so avoid visiting for any shopping purpose. Also it has fine Japanese Restaurants for dining Overall a great place to visit if you love Japanese culture. A must visit thing in Singapore"
,,More high class,4.0,,"Another very high class orchard road shopping unit. This one has a lot of bonuses. A free fashion show which was really busy and first class presentations.
Another treat is the food hall. Lots of free samples. Wonderful smells, variety of foods even more than Harrods.
Don't walk past it's worth a visit."
,,Disgusting Service,1.0,,"Terrible service.

Last week (6/12/2018)
Went back to the cashier less than 5 minutes later for another paper bag because the one that was given to me was torn. Staff was reluctant and questioned if I purchased anything.
I literally went to purchase 200 over dollars worth of things 5 minutes ago and it wasn’t even crowded or was there a queue behind me.
How much could a paper bag cost that the staff have to be so doubtful when a guest ask for another one?
As a young customer, I felt that the staff were judging my financial independence.
Purchased from Braun Buffel counter and Waterman/Parker counter. Staff were okay, had to highly compliment the tall and lean (Filipino, I believe) gentleman who was extremely patient and lovely.

Today (16/12/2018)
Went to purchase a Moleskin notebook. No staff was there hence I thought I just had to take the item straight to the cashier. When I was about to leave, staff rudely told me to go over to her. Wrote on a piece of invoice without even speaking to me and told me to pay and come back.
Paid, and went back to the Moleskin counter, no staff was around hence I went to the nearest staff. Told her I’m here to collect my item and she took her own sweet time to keep the spectacles into the casing, and pass the invoice to another lady that was chatting with another staff. I believe that lady was the in-charge of Moleskin counter. She rudely asked for my receipt, which was with my companion, collecting another item. I told the staff that the receipt will be here soon and she merely stood there and wait. When my companion came, and we showed her the receipt, she took her own sweet time again to take the notebook and asked if it’s the one and she merely passed it to me without saying anything else.

What the fu*k is this service. Good thing I wasn’t in a rush. With such service in a Japanese department store, you have disgraced the efficiency of the Japanese. In the heart of the country, the shopping town of Singapore, the service here is pathetic and I hope no tourists.... which I doubt they will receive similar treatment since they’d be, well, financially independent.

I am in the service industry and I understand that guests are paying a high price not just for the luxurious product but also for the service. I understand that there are many part timers here and that they are not as passionate. However, if you’re willing to let these pathetic little flies ruin the reputation and guest satisfaction, please continue with what you’re doing.

Cheers."
,,Department store,4.0,,"Takashimaya is a department store and shopping complex on Orchard Road, selling everything you could possibly need.. we particularly like the kitchen and household sections which reminds us of a European department store.

Downstairs in the open plan basement is usually a temporary shopping area with a themed shop.. at the moment they are selling Christmas decorations and toys.

The best shop within this complex is however Kinokuniya, the Japanese bookstore... An ideal place to get your paperbacks in Asia (although not inexpensive)."
,,Department store,4.0,,"Straight from japan and the most successful . Isetan, yaohan and sogo don’t have the track record. A good supermarket, food hall, household department. I get a lot of bedroom and kitchen supplies here"
,,If you are looking for the Kinokuniya flagship store,5.0,,"I love this mall for its Kinokuniya main stores on the level 4. The store is the biggest one in Singapore. You can easily reach this mall from Orchard MRT through its basement walkway. Other shops available in this mall include Cartier, Céline, Chanel, Chopard, Dior, Fendi, Louis Vuitton, The Hour Glass, Tiffany & Co., and Van Cleef & Arpels."
,,Best mall,4.0,,This is the best mall in Singapore all the best brands are here and the building is beautifully decorated
,,Sooooo Many Shoppers!,5.0,,We started at the basement with the various food corners where it was extremely difficult to walk. Gradually made it to the 4th which was less crowded at 7 PM on a weekday. This department store seems to carry just about everything
,,Symbol of Orchard Road shopping belt,5.0,,"If you are a tourist, you have to stop by in Takashimaya. For the last 20-30 years, this has certainly served as the place to go to for shopping and to enjoy the sights and sounds of Orchard Road."

,,Visit to Takashimaya Singapore,4.0,,There is a lot of shops that sell food and clothes in Takashimaya. The food sold inside comes in different variety and cuisines as well.
,,One of the best Yong Tau Foo,4.0,,"Busy, noisy and crowded food court, avoid peak lunch time period between 1-2pm anything after or before that peak period is fine, as you can then fine a table and seats to enjoy your meal. There are a variety of stores here you can get fried noodles, noodles in soup etc but the best thing here is the Yong Tou Foo in soup form. Abosultely delicious."

The mall is always very lively and crowded with people due to its proximity to the nearby MRT stations."
,,Pleasant Respite from the Heat,4.0,,"On Orchard Street this Japanese department store has a good food hall on the B2 level. There are many different types of food to choose from and the air conditioning provides a good break from the heat. Also it was moon cake season when we were there and they had a huge section of vendors selling many varieties of this treat. This department store is a good place to take a break, especially if you don’t have one in your hometown."
,,Classy mall,5.0,,This Japanese mall in the middle of Orchard road is an ideal place for shoppers looking for real good brands and even the food is great
,,Excellent,5.0,,"I suppose this place sums up Singapore. Classy and expensive . However its fun located in the middle of Orchard Rd a short walk from either Orchard or Somerset stations. Its a large department store in its own right with the normal high end shops in the surrounding Mall. Ideal to people watch and enjoy cafe and coffee.
You can walk through underground to Orchard station if you just keep going down on the escalator and watch for signs"
,,Great for shopping,5.0,,"This is my favourite department store in Singapore. Great selection of goods, many different brands. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Excellent Choice for Shopping!,5.0,,Takashimaya has always been my priority everytime I visit Singapore. Good location with a variety of choices when it comes to food and shopping with a good quality of products. Many brands are available with many options which makes you wanna spend the rest of your day around if you're a shopping lover! This shopping mall is highly recommended to those who plan to make Singapore as your next destination.
,,Nice shopping mall in Singapore,5.0,,"Takashimaya shopping center its one of the biggest and best malls in Singapore.
I like it alot due to different key brands available as an option for shopping.
Plus the food court has different varieties of food to choose from different countries.
The only things which confused us is the layout of the malls it self where you might get lost where did you and where to finish.
But over all, most recommended shopping malls in Singapore"
,,T for Trip To Takashimaya Shopping Mall,5.0,,"This is my favorite shopping centre in Singapore. Mainly for its good variety of great quality products and all those great quality restaurants and Japanese foods. Best times to visit is during their Big Singapore Sales in July to August. And, I am BACK! ;)"
,,takashimaya got it all,3.0,,"the ambiance would make you feel like you hit it big and can just shop around in every store without ever looking at the price. but alas, reality sets in and all you can afford is a quick meal in their various fast food stalls.

takashimaya is a tongue-twister for the unfamiliar but once you get used to this shopping center, you’ll not go anywhere else.

there is a very good seafood restaurant at the upper floor which name escapes me. the food was scrumptious."
,,My go to place,5.0,,Always my first stop when I’m in Singapore and a few more times in between. Wonderful for a wide variety of things but particularly love the kitchen and household section.
,,A huge mall with everything,5.0,,"Connected to Wisma Atria, Ion and Orchard Mrt, is also connected to Lucky Plaza via underpass. It houses all the luxury brands down to medium level brands. Many restaurants to choose from, small eateries, fastfood and cafes too.

Currently there’s a food fair at the main atrium. Departmental store also has Great Singapore Sale. Toilets are plenty, with diaper changing facilities. Best baby room for pumping and making mil is at L4 kids dept.

Food court and stalls at the basement with many food fairs concurrent. There’s a cold storage supermarket too.

Great place to shop!"
,,Great on a hot day,4.0,,The mall is connected to Wismatria via an underground walkway. It's open and great to walk around with kids. The departmental store is seperate for the side that has all outlets.
,,Japanese shopping center,3.0,,A Japanese shopping center. There were a lot of small food stores at the bottom with a supermarket. There were also small stores in this shopping center.
,,Great store worst service ever,1.0,,We went to the sport section with intent of purcahsing sport items. The system is that a salesman gives you a note that needs to be paid. The problem is that the sales person is not available and when you need to pay the note no till is open for payment. Service is non existing . We then attempted to purchase an electronic item. Lots of sales personal on the floor but none that are willing to assist. Lots of potential but you really have to know what your preferred item is and be ready to spend time and effort to buy it.
,,Ordinary a mall,4.0,,Orchad road so many shooping mall Here basement 1 floor and have many good brand tools I like massage tools and look cheap but all japan and singapore nice brands

,,Mall Shopping,4.0,,Takashimaya located on Orchard street is located in the heart of Singapore tourist shopping destination. We found some relatively good bargains at reasonable prices. The wi fi was good and the toilets are clean and well maintained. Generally the staff were friendly efficient and the product knowledge was good. With so many options available in the great city of Singapore I would suggest you still consider visiting.
,,"High-end shops, basement area with great selection of international food",4.0,,"For me, what sets Takashimaya apart from other Orchard malls is the basement area where there are a lot of stalls selling international food. The selections here are well-curated and almost always delicious! Some notable finds include the baumkuchen (tree ring cake) and various Japanese delicacies."
,,A disappointment,1.0,,"I had been to Singapore 24 years ago when I visited takashimaya for the first time, and was very impressed.
This time , however , it is just like any other mall. Nothing really stands out, and in the home appliance sections the workers didn’t really know much about the products, nor did they understand English so well.
Wouldn’t advise anyone to go out of their way for this ."
,,A mall that has almost everything.,3.0,,A mall that almost everything. Worth a visit. Located at orchard mrt. The basement has a lot of tasty food.
,,Shopping And Eating Galore,4.0,,"Huge department store at shopping street mecca , Orchard Road. Many high end luxury brands , from Louis Vuitton, Hermes and even Goyard among others. Hard to find stores are there , like the Kinokuniya book shop . Expensive restaurants like Imperial Treasure and Crystal Jade. So many things to see in such a short time."
,,Huge department store,5.0,,"Huge department store of Orchard Road. Inside there are almost , when I visited it was crowded with people."

,,Very nice,5.0,,"There are plenty of department stores along Orchard Rd but Takashimaya is a step above. Prices I browsed were on par with others, some a bit cheaper Very nicely presented, excellent variety, a worthwhile experience"
,,Absolutely Terrible Service,1.0,,"Had an awful experience. Although I was entitled to a free gift, the cashier initially refused and was really rude. Their ""customer service ambassador"" Eugene Chin was even ruder. He was extremely dismissive and simply refused to speak to us, thinking that giving us the silent treatment was the right thing to do. What a disgrace!"
,,The food court is so cool!,4.0,,"Is a fact that this shopping mall has a lot of good shops that can distract you for hours. But what I really like about Takashimaya is its food court in the basement level. It's so cool!
With a good range of foods and a good price, you can have a very local experience there. And if you're not in the mood for something typical, there is also a nice bakery and many pastry shops to try. I really recommend!"
,,A lovely shopping complex offering many high end stores & also worth a visit is the Takashimaya department store within.,4.0,,"Many levels of shops to see, a great food court on the lower level, the only thing which I would suggest could be improved is the taxi stand area, given the amount of time we had to wait, they need to install more seating benches."
,,Upper market mall.,3.0,,"This has the same brand names as Ion, just up the road. Every top end name with prices to match. If you like a name on your fashion, this is the place to be. Also has a large number of high end jewellery stores."
,,"Boring mall, more geared towards tourists",3.0,,"Classic shopping mall in Singapore, not that many items even though its spread over 5 floors. May be good for tourists looking to window shop."
,,A great department store for shopping experts,5.0,,"Unlike most other shopping centres in this all through shopping-friendly city, this is a department store. You who have visited famous landmarks regarding department stores, such as Harvey Nichols, KADEWE, Barneys, NK, Selfridges etc. know what kind of department stores it is about. Extremely beautiful, design on every floor and good service right through. Here you will find everything; from fun design brands to pure luxury. On the bottom floor, you will find a great food market, both to sit down and buy with. We recommend the floor plan for furnishings and kitchen utensils. And, don't forget your passport if you want to shop taxfree. And generally, if you've come to visit flying Singapore Airlines: always bring proof - you never know when you'll get discount just for choosing that airline!"
,,Not bad,4.0,,The mall was big and there was alot of things that i cannot afford but there were many affordable things so its a good experience
,,Department store,3.0,,"This is a department store within Ngee Ann City complex. A branch of the famed chain from japan

Has got some of the luxury brands and pretty similar to any other high end department stores. I specifically come here to buy sheridan bed sheets and pillows

The basement food hall is probably the highlight for many, just like in japan"
,,Abundant variety !!,5.0,,Unlimited variety ... crew with wonderful attitude ... price range from medium to high ... with limited cheap goods. House at Ngee Ann city and a great food court at B2. A place not to be missed for shopping. My fav is Luggage at Level 3
,,Many Things To Buy,4.0,,We go to Takashimaya just about every single day as it is close to our hotel. There are many things to look at and buy. There are lots of Japan type of food at the basement which is a must try for all. I love to go to the Supermarket Cold storage for sushi as it is always freshly made and quite tasty.
,,High end departmental store,4.0,,This is the high end departmental store from Japan. They have a nice selection of premium brands and household items. The supermarket in the basement has a wide range of imported items.
,,Upmarket shopping mall,4.0,,"Despite boasting an international selection of foods and branded products, the shopping mall caters for the mainstream crowd as well. There is plenty of affordable food in the basement foodcourt, and usually events are held in the centre atrium. They include adhoc bag sales, children/toy sales, mooncake sampling, Christmas decorations sales, etc! Good effort in keeping the mall catered for the needs / and festive!"
,,Had my best meal in their cold storage supermarket!!!👍👍👍,5.0,,"Their food court has dropped in quality but their supermarket selection cold storage sushi is probably the best selection outside of tsukiji market in Japan hehe.

I got a bunch of ikura sushi and after 730 the lady drops the price by 40% as she wants them sold. So fresh and yummy! Best meal all under 18$sgd"
,,Takashimaya...,4.0,,Takashimaya is a department store located in singapore and I visited the one located at orchard road. Its a full fledged departmental store ranging from kitchen ware to previous jewellery which makes it a paradise for the shopping freaks. Food court is available at the basement satisfied the needs of your tummy once you get tired of shopping...
,,1st visit to Pandora counter,5.0,,"My 1st visit to know at the much talked abt Pandora accessories. Welcomed by Mr Lill. Very attentive and patient when he introduced to various designs. After much comparing and trying, finally bought my first beautiful Pandora bangle and charms! Kudos to Mr Lill on his professionalism which makes me want to revisit again for more purchase! If you guys arnd town to purchase any Pandora, drop by and look for Mr Lill! visit"
,,Big Department Store,4.0,,"Takashimaya remains a popular shopping destination for locals and tourists alike. No matter what time of day or year, the store is always packed. I reckon its the biggest department store in Singapore, bigger than the likes of Isetan and Tang’s.

Why Takashimaya is popular is due to the variety of items they carry which range from designer brands to every day wear. There are individual boutiques like Hermès, Bally, Ralph Lauren etc but you can also find reasonable priced brands like Van Heusen etc. You can shop and break the bank at Takashimaya or you don’t need to. You can find everything under 1 roof from men’s wear, women’s, children’s, golfing equipment, sportswear, Japanese delicatessen etc.

You can’t miss visiting Takashimaya if you’re on Orchard Road. You can buy almost everything you need here without needing to visit other shops. Highly recommended if you just want a one stop department store to shop."
,,Choices of luxury,5.0,,"I have not been to Takaimaya for a while now. Super big mall with varieties. Went when they were having a Takashimaya members sales. There were a lot of stuff on sales, household, food, clothes, etc. the crowd was pack, especially where many were grabbing the timberland shoes on sale. I also pick out a few of the exercise apparels, which were quite good deal. Even the Takashimaya village food area got lots of food to pick from. I highly recommend, especially when the sales are on"
,,Shopping and eating,4.0,,Takashimaya is a huge department store full of designer goods. It has an impressive supermarket in the basement as well as a huge food court which offers wide variety of cuisine in a busy environment. Each dish costs about S$6.
,,Iconic,5.0,,"Shopping center and office block that has been around for a long time and still so relevant. I'm back here twice on 2 days. Dinner here yesterday but unfortunately was caught with leaving at closing time and had difficulty getting a taxi. Today was to buy a present, top up on coffee pods, grocery and sushi for lunch."
,,Food heaven!,5.0,,"My Singaporean friend took me there and I produced me to all sorts of local confectionery.
I tried handful of Singaporean sweets. The grocery shop and bakeries there are AMAZING!!! They carry everything including Chinese cooking sauces and Pandan leaves for my cooking. Make sure to go to the basement food section of Takashimaya department store."
,,One of the best shopping centres,4.0,,"This shoppping centre is classy and has all the goods from wathces, clothes etc here . It has a wonderful food court where you can get a decent meal for a reasonable price. It is connected to Wisma Atria and Lucky Plaza via and an under pass."
,,My favorite store,5.0,,"I love Takashimya even when I don't have anything to buy. Great selection of clothes, shoes and kitchen ware, swimwear and luggage."
,,Great Mall,4.0,,"Takashimaya is a great mall , they have almost everything , from watches to kitchen appliances, sales promotions , discounts , food , you won't go wrong , but this is not a local shopping mall , expect to spend few hundred or even $1000s of dollars for a teapot set , things are not cheap , Quality is pride of workmanship."
,,Always having new food fair,4.0,,"Love the basement which always come out with interesting food fair, food promotions, especially at the event hall as well. Nearby also have many takeaway kiosks like icecream and japanese food. Mooncake festival is coming soon so can foresee it will be swarmed with people!"
,,A very “cool” department store!,4.0,,"During our most recent visit to Singapore, we undertook a major shopping expedition along Orchard Road on a very hot and humid day. It was a real relief to step into the massive Takashimaya Department Store as the air conditioning inside was excellent and it provided a comfortable environment for shopping.
The store offers a great range of “high-end” goods for sale with prices to match. There were no real bargains to be had here.
Well worth a visit even if it is just to cool off!"
,,Japanese deptarment store,4.0,,"A wide varieties of good but unfortunately not for westerners in clothing could not find a XL shirts that fitted me .Staff too busy on there mobile like most store on the Orchard strip are the same, you have to physically grab their attention for service .Service non-existent don't be shock if you find one good statf."
,,A must place to go for shopping,4.0,,Those who have visited Singapore must find it as a must place to go for shopping. Perhaps the best Dept.Store in Singapore. The golf shop / counter is golfers' destination besides the one at Shaw Centre
,,Extensive variety of cosmetics,5.0,,Great mall with lots of everything on offer. The food court is interesting with many options and a few bakeries. The cosmetic brands are very nice.
,,Department store,3.0,,"This is a department store within Ngee Ann City complex. A branch of the famed chain from japan

Has got some of the luxury brands and pretty similar to any other high end department stores

The basement food hall is probably the highlight for many, just like in japan"
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"We spent a day in Singapore and decided to visit the Takashimaya food hall and were not impressed. Maybe we selected badly but the food was not hot as it should have been, the place was certainly crowded and there were some nice stalls outside the main meeting area offering some exciting products but generally we did not think the visit was worth the effort."
,,Good shops,5.0,,"Loads of good shops and food. Takashimaya is close to my house so we end up there most weekend.

Loads of luxury shops, I never bought any expensive watch or bag but I bought a the from the main shopping mall. It has loads of restaurants on the basement and 5th floor. Worth it if you are in the area, rather than he nearby shopping malls."
,,Legendary mall,4.0,,"Takashimaya is one of the longest running malls in Singapore and has been an iconic mall on Orchard road. If you are looking for japanese products, Takashimaya offers a broad range of selections. Also, they often hold Japanese food bazaar on the basement."
,,Family shopping mall in Singapore,5.0,,We love to visited takashimaya everytime we stay at singapore as you can find many japanese foods and snacks also my kids really love the toys department. Located in famous Orchard Road and reachable via bus or mrt station.
,,Beautiful Mall,5.0,,It is a very nice mall and I most like the home section here. Their collection is very nice particularly for Vietnamese lacquerware. The food hall is a must see to.
,,"The nearest to Mandarin Gallery and Mandarin Orchard Hotel, it has a modern feeling",4.0,,"As a shopping mall that is the nearest to Mandarin Orchard Hotel, it is compared as a ""contemporary mall"" despite its roots back when Ariana Grande was a baby in 1993. The visit was very good, however, it would be better if there were to be an art gallery on the 6th floor and a cinema on the 7th floor."
,,Very busy food court with excellent range of cuisines,5.0,,"A must visit for tourists,you get to sample a great variety of local cuisines.Clean and lovely atmosphere.Highly recommended."

,,"One stop shop, super organised and offers amazing deals",4.0,,"Love the set-up. Takashimaya has remained a favourite for Singaporeans and tourists ever since the beginning for the amazing stuff available, deals and the fact that it is super organised. It offers home delivery for orders above a certain amount which is great if you purchase large amounts of products. In addition, it's convenient because everything is under one roof. There are a number of places to eat and PAUL is super for coffee and breads. The Crystal Jade is also amazing for Chicken and dumplings for lunch. The Hawker's in the basement offers many options and a couple of takeaway eateries like Tori-Q and amazing chocolates at Godiva. Great for shopping and an outing."
,,A world of shopping,5.0,,"This giant, multi-level shopping complex is a world of shopping. You will find all the luxury brands that you will never need.

I like the grocery store in the basement for food shopping almost without limits. Another favourite of mine is the Japanese bookstore on one of the upper floors, which is probably the largest in Singapore.

The complex is well worth visiting and exploring."
,,Excellent shopping experience,5.0,,"All shops under one roof, from individual shops to huge Department Store, selling from budget friendly stuff to high end wears. You name it, they have it. The basement has a good supermarket and food courts with many choices, where we normally eat during our frequent visits to Singapore."
,,Interesting and fascinating!,5.0,,"Great place to shop for books, food, clothing and kitchen utensils. It;s everything into one place. The food court is a must visit area but avoid lunch break as full to the brim.
Latest kitchen gears & bags for all and also stationery. Also there are always sales at the courtyard!"
,,"Elegant , and fresh , Clean and exellent products for sale",4.0,,"For me Takashimaya is a store the has very elegant products , and a great place to have breakfast or lunch any day , very clean and a perfect place to refuge from the heat of Singapore , good food and incredible shopping , not cheap, more in the high price products but excellent quality. In Orchard road, I'll considerate it the ANCHOR store."
,,Great Place for Genuine Goods Shopping.,4.0,,"Shopping at Takashimaya after collecting my bonus is quite an event for me,
For the Gents, you can brands like S.T Dupont, A | X Armani Exchange,
Hugo Boss & Fendi, just to name a few.

Similarly for the Ladies, there is LVMH, Chanel, Christian Dior,
Burberry & Kate Spade NEW YORK and many more cosmetic brands
that my wife patronize.

Probably the best thing about Takashimaya SC is the vouchers;
which I by serendipity gotten once during my company’s D & D.
There is absolutely “No Expiry Date” to these vouchers.

On a side note; I have previously received Capital Land Vouchers;
as Christmas presents that were really quite a pain to extend the validity;
culminating with back and forth emails, photographs verification and phone calls.

If you are like me, who forgets exactly where you have kept them;
after moving to a new place, only vaguely recalling where
these vouchers maybe; these Takashimaya SC vouchers might
just be the saving grace.

I have shared two photographs in my post with the
Terms and Conditions attached for an understanding.

I hope this review helps."
,,Our lovely mall in Sgp,5.0,,"We superb love takashimaya!! Near from our hotel (we usually stayed in mandarin orchard). We re going with 3 babies. In Taka very easy to looking for food, supermarket (cold storage) and also for shopping. Level 4 is for children toys shirt etc. The 1st level for woman have from cosmetic until branded bag (like kate spade etc). They usually held a bazaar like baby fair or mens wear (when i go there at april 2017) in b1."
,,Big place,4.0,,"This place is huge plenty of high grade shopping worth a look ,be careful its not hard to get lost ,or find what your looking for.Across the road is Lucky Plaza plenty of cheap shopping there"
,,Spring Hokkaido Fair Comes To Takashiyama,4.0,,The usual stores are decked out and competing for the shopper's dollar... as expected. The Spring Hokkaido Fair brings a food frenzy to the complex. The Sports Fair at the sprawling atrium gives added reason to browse and shop.
,,Excellent mall - Must visit,4.0,,"Great location - easily accessible. there are different levels for different things.. i like the Shepora in this mall it has a great variety of cosmetics. It is a must visit. The variety is pretty massive, lots of international and Japanese brands."
,,excellent mall - there is some thing for every one,5.0,,"If there is one thing I like about shopping in Takashimaya, it is because I can find every thing I need here. great location - easily accessible. there are different levels for household (lots of variety), children, ladies - the shoes section is amazing, men, sports, and the food hall is the best... it's a place for you to sit, enjoy the food (mainly japanese but there are also different cuisines) and rest your aching feet. there are specialty shops too where you can get lots of interesting stuff and gifts (food mainly). and of course the book shop Kinokuniya is just the place to find interesting books which other bookshops do not have. there is also supermarket is also located at the basement. so, it is possible to just hang out here for a day and get every thing you need without going any where else. the variety is pretty massive, lots of international and Japanese brands. I'd recommend coming here on a weekday early morning to avoid the crowds. weekends can be really crowded."
,,A very modern shopping mall,5.0,,It is quite big and impressive. Lots of international and Japanese brands. There is Paul inside which was very good for us. Kinokuniya upstairs is a must visit although very crowded.
,,Best shopping place in Singapore for book lovers,5.0,,"It is because they have the biggest Kinokuniya store here. It's 3-4x bigger than the biggest one we have in Jakarta. There's a vast collection of books here, from magazine, music notes, travel guides, and many more."
,,Shopping in Singapore,4.0,,"I love shopping for shirts in Singapore for two reasons.
1. It has different selection more suited for that region
2. Sizes do fit me. As in Dubai and Europe we get European cuts which are very long in sleeves and very big in shoulders.
While same size M or L in some case would fit me perfectly in Singapore shops.
Takashimaya was interesting store as it has consolidated area for men and you would find every thing in that little space about half floor.
Everything in a wardrobe that men would need, almost.
It was bit pricey but good by and large.
I recommend."
,,Cos Kinokuniya Is Here!,5.0,,"This became one of our must visit favourite place for decades now because we like to shop at Kinokuniya, the Japanese book store.

We are always spoilt for choice here across all the genre of books that we like in various languages. There's a huge comic and manga section too with sale of merchandises and collectible toys.

The departmental store is good as well but not much choice of restaurant here unless you get out of the main building.

Queuing for cab here has always been a nightmare for there's lots of people in queue at any given time."
,,One of the best department stores in Orchard,5.0,,"Living in Orchard road makes you go around the different shopping malls often. Out all the available Ines Takashimaya is definitely the best.

It has all the top brand in case you want to buy anything luxury, great variety of restaurants, good parking, an amazing book store and top food stores and supermarket at the basement.

I buy my electronics there, my last tv and laptop. And the prices are competitive."
,,Lots of options,4.0,,"So much shopping here, you can spend all day and not see everything. If you like to walk around, window shop and actual shop this is for you. I spend hours here and can't wait to go back. I love how there are so many options of the same brand and every one carries something different!"
,,DEPARTMENT STORE WITH A JAPANESSE HERITAGE,4.0,,"A comprehensive department store with a nice selection of merchandise that covers all segments of life. Clean, nice displays, attentive salespersons. A comprehensive glimpse into life in Singapore, Recommend, Hope this helps."

,,Amazing Japanese Products,4.0,,You will find an amazing Japanese products here you will never find it in other places and some are expensive but excellent quality You will have nice time here
,,"Usual expensive designer Orchard Road, but with one noticable excellent addition...",4.0,,"...a wonderful book shop! As you wander around Singapore one thing you will miss after a few months is a book shop. Somewhere to buy things like wall planners..or even books! In Takashimaya you have all of the usual Orchard Road staples (e.g. Chanel, Versace, Cartier, etc.), but the one place you should spend some time in is the vast Kinokuniya on the 4th floor. A gem!"
,,A nice place to shop,5.0,,"Here you can find almost all the things that you need in life, from housewares to sports equipment, luxury goods and foods. This place is a one stop shopping place in Singapore. I always go to this place particularly because they have this Versus Versace store. This is the only one in Singapore. If you want to shop at Versus, make sure that you are looking for James. He is very friendly and will certainly assist you his best. Takashimaya has a florist too! The food hall has variety of choices. For those who loves snacking, you should go to the snack section of this place. You'll be happy! Don't forget for tourists! Claim your GST if you spend more than 100 SGD. Enjoy singapore and happy shopping!"
,,Fantastic variety,5.0,,"I stumbled into this shopping center while walking along Orchard Rd. It was one of my favorite discoveries in Singapore.
The place is over the top with a crazy mix of luxury stores, and exotic restaurants.
Chinese New Year vendor stalls added a lively ambiance.
I highly recommend it."
,,What a nightmare!,2.0,,"This shopping mall/department store was extremely difficult to navigate! The selection of shops was great, but the lack of organization/cohesion in the mall was a big issue. Paper maps are not easily accessible, and it's very difficult to know where is the department store and where is the shopping center... the bookstore however was fantastic, one of the biggest I think I've ever seen!!!"
,,One stop shopping! Can be better though,4.0,,A packed shopping center. However some alley are too small to pass thru with stroller! Only 3 lifts available. It is so complete that you can purchase everything everybrand here. However the food court and the options of the restaurant is limited. It is difficult to find seat during lunch time in the food court. And again the space to go thru with stroller is sooo difficult. Please tidy up a bit. Note that we walk using umbrella stroller. Imagine walk in the alley using tandem or twin stroller. Forget it.
,,Department store,3.0,,"A branch of the massive japanese chain, this is smaller in size compared to the japanese parent of course. The essential elements are all there, including the food hall. Not as impressive as japan, but acceptable

Some or most people confuse taka with ngee ann city. Taka is just the department store and the anchor tenant, within the ngee ann mall, which is massive and as a whole, 1 of the top 3 malls in singapore in my opinion"
,,Disappointd!,2.0,,"We decided to visit this department store following the raving reviews from friends...Boy! We were in for a surprise! We went to the home appliances' section... there we had to wait a good 30 minutes before anyone came to ask if we needed help despite the fact that we were standing by the item we were interested in! In another department, we were looking at watches - none of our choices were available and so we were told we'd have to get the ones on display... we didn't mind but then we were informed that the batteries were out and we had to get new ones.. so yet another disappointment... on our out, we had to visit the toilets...Let's just say we had to breath through the mouth in order to avoid the smell. We'd probably avoid that store for a long time."
,,Great one,5.0,,Loved the mall and surrounding areas. Great christmas spirit and it was very busy with people. Loved it and planning to visit again soon
,,Shopping Iconic location,5.0,,"Huge amazing shopping center where you can find anything you may imagine to buy, eat or enjoy. From the basic supermarket to the most sophisticated item of fashion brand; also the best Book shop on the island and eventually in the whole Asia.
Thousands of people any time and day of the year. Great atmosphere and service all around. Must visit in Singapore."
,,Gigantic mall,4.0,,"This is a gigantic mall smacked right in the middle of orchard road. It's a Japanese and thus, can find lots of Japanese stuff here. At basement one, there is this place where they sell the snacks and food from different parts of Japan itself. There is a Japanese food street as well.

The upper level houses the famous global brands like Chanel and Louis Vuitton. Basically you can find all sorts of things within the mall itself!"
,,Another Mall,3.0,,Orchard Rd have dozen of high end malls and Takashimaya worths the visit. It's really well located and offer interesting brands. Recommended...
,,Great place to shop!,5.0,,"This department store has most of the things you need. Though some could be expensive, it provides a lot of options for the consumers. They also have special sale at times where you could take advantage on the very low prices. We usually enjoy the Baby Fair and Toy Sale. There is a grocery as well at the basement. Food hall are as well found in the basement. Their customer service is excellent. They also have a nursing rooms at the 4th floor. Restaurants are as well found in the 5th floor of the building."
,,Loads here but awful layout,3.0,,Masses of top brands mixed with cheaper looking ones spread over an array of floor levels and buildings. Go here to get totally lost- no good asking the staff either as even they had no idea when I asked for certain things.
,,Kinokuniya,5.0,,Wow! Super huge bookstore with every kind of book. And the mall is super chic too. I would totally recommend this place to everyone !

Building had 4 floor
1st for pharmacy product from Japan and other usual pharmacy plus bakery shop
2nd floor for lady bags and shoes plus tea shop
3rd floor for lady and men clothes

,,One of the Oldest Shopping Malls Along Orchard Road,4.0,,"This review is quite late.

It is a Japanese chain of stores, and is located inside Ngee Ann City Tower."

,,One of the Big Shopping Mall in the Area,3.0,,"This is one of the big shopping centre within the Orchard area. It has all the usual stores and eateries.

I have been and walk through this place a number of times while visiting Singapore. It is one of the older ones but still kept clean and maintained well.

As I am not a shopping type person, it is another typical shopping centre to me."
,,Picture perfect,5.0,,You need lots of cash 💰 here. Amazing shopping mall for its selection of luxury goods and the food stalls are ART. Check them out.
,,Lacked the Japanese touch,2.0,,"Nothing like the Tokyo store. Just a b grade shopping centre. Same old bag and watch shops, nothing worthy of note - just don't go expecting the Japanese takashimaya."
,,Shop til you drop,5.0,,"Bring loads of money and or credit cards. Alternatively, window shopping and weep. I seem to always do the latter T_T"
,,Designers mall,4.0,,A place for designers shops and luxury dining A place not so recommended for teenagers cause the items there are mostly high end
,,One Stop Shopping location for anything you need,4.0,,"Still the best place to get anything you need on Orchard Road Has a basement Food Court which is always crowded. A Super market and some amazing household ware, clothes for all. Very good layout and convenient location with excellent service and merchandise."

,,large shopping ara,5.0,,we visited this large shoppping which include different tging include clothes for men women children
,,A great place to shop,5.0,,"A good place to visit if your pockets are full. Almost everything you were looking for can be found here. My son wanted some latest models of the trains from Thomas series, we could find here. They were expensive than the US but as they were not available in India we went for those. In fact, we did not get beyond toy section!"
,,Great Mall,4.0,,This is a great mall you can find everything here from High end brands to high fashion. For all ages and gender. Its just a place to get everything. Food area too is amazing and supermarket selection is great.
,,"Quality items, best to buy on sale",5.0,,"Takashimaya : not a single store, but a few huge buildings full of shops and shops and shops, restaurants and every high end retailer. Actually a bit confusing. Pravda, Chanel, Dior, Armani, are all housed here. Price, very high. $200 for a bedsheet. Phew.in the middle of this plethora of shops does lie the real Takashimaya, but don't ask me how to find it! Quality good. Prices too high. Clean, nice to walk on a Sunday evening. Many nice cafes to eat like a big hawker center"
,,A must visit! My favorite mall :))),5.0,,"It is a Japanese mall near Ngee Ann City. My favorite part in the mall was their underground food hall. Their food court is small but that doesn't matter as there's so much japanese foods around, omg! I am really obsessed lol I saw my favorite character Rilakkuma from one of the stalls around and I bought it for $25, it's a petite biscuit but really good! I bought there some sakura goodies, so worth it! I also went to their grocery, it was all clean and seems like all the foods that I needed was there. They have japanese yakult, quite pricey for a yakult but its great coz it has different flavors. There's also a promo from Ben & Jerry's ice cream, a buy 1 get 1 so we bought 2 bar around $25. A bit pricey still lol

Overall, this is the place for you if you're into japanese :) its really worth visiting! you won't regret it :))"
,,Excellent place to shop in Singapore,5.0,,Takashimaya is not a shopping mall but a department store in Ngee Ann City which has other shops as well. Takashimaya as the name implies is a japanese based store and has lots of japanese products not seen elsewhere as well as other usual branded products. It is hugh and has everything under the (rising) sun from what you would expect from a store like Harrods or Selfridges. It has an interesting japanese based food hall in the basement but also has other fine products from other parts of the world. There is a food court downstairs to recharge for your shopping but to take a good break from the shopping I would recommend a coffee/patisserie called Paul just outside Takashimaya at level 3 (I think).
,,Japanese mall,4.0,,"Good bargains during sales. The food court is usually superpacked, near impossible to get a seat for a meal. One suggestion for a decent meal is to walk to Somerset or Orchard Central."
,,A Must-Visit place for me!,5.0,,"Tell me, what u need? Takashimaya Singapore have it all! Shopping (from A to Z, fashion to home living), Dining (the foodcourt considered complete), just everything i need. Almost all international branded stuffs can be found here."

,,Array of stores for everyone,5.0,,Big shopping mall with an array of stores for everyone of all ages. The food court offers food from all over the world. Must visit: Kinokuniya book store (thousands of books in one huge store)!
,,"Big, Japanese, Store :)",4.0,,Most anything under the sun can be found in Takashimaya and it's connected Ngee Ann City Mall. I enjoy the food court downstairs with lots of Japanese and local foods.
,,Nothing much,3.0,,"Seems like aged mall, visit only about 1.5 hours and nothing much special except it close to Somerset MRT station."
,,A Mix Bunch,3.0,,"Its a store with all the brands under its roof. in some sections there is a good variety and deal (shoes, garments), for others its just taking up space.
If you want to browse through a bit of everything before deciding what to buy then this is the place."
,,"Huge mall, free Wifi",4.0,,"Takashimaya is a huge shopping mall located next to ion center. The closest MRT is orchard station.
We found most of the shops to be upmarket expensive ones (ones i call dream of lottery win shops) louboutin, cartier, tiffanys, dior, etc with a large Takashimaya department store. Lots of staff in the department store, who watch closely and pounce on you as you look asking if you need help.
Free Wifi in the mall for 1 hour, then you need to resign in again.
If you can find the help desk and you are a tourist you can show your passport to get a discount book."
,,many levels of shopping,4.0,,"I was staying close by so found my way down to the Cold Storage supermarket on the lower level on many occasions. Got lost inside this massive mall the first couple of times but once you get your landmarks sorted it runs along better. The interconnections and subway by passes are a great way to get around and to avoid the heat.
I'm not a huge label buyer but if you are you will love this place."
,,Excellent Japanese departmental store at Ngee Ann City mall.......,4.0,,"Takashimaya is the huge, posh Japanese anchor tenant of Ngee Ann City mall. This departmental store is beautiful, classy, well designed & carry huge range of high end to mid end products over several floors. Including a foodcourt called Takashimaya Food Village.

An interesting feature of Takashimaya SC is that it always holds regular different 'Themed' sales events on the big atrium space in front of the Food Village. It could be luggage fair, food fair, baby fair, etc. This time now, is the Food Fest fair."
,,So much to see,5.0,,"If you need to pick up gifts to take back home, or are looking for travel essentials this is the place. It's on Orchard Road so is easily accessible and has most of the shops you could ever need."
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"Takashimaya is the famous shopping center located in Orchard Road. It is the paradise for one stop shopping and dining. Takashimaya department store and merchandise, top brand fashion, book store, restaurant and food court. It is luxury, clean and air-condition worked well."
,,Over The Top Service but Affordable,4.0,,"How many Chanel, Dior, LV, Tiffany etc outlets can one street support!? Takashimaya was a welcome haven of reasonably priced stores and merchandise. However the staff to shopper ratio is the highest I have ever experienced. Each section or sales counter has multiple staff who are quick to ask you if you need help. I can appreciate great service but it feels overwhelming as the clerks literally follow you as you browse their section."

,,Favorite!,5.0,,"Having fallen in love with all things Japanese on a visit the previous year, Takashimaya was on top of our list. What can I say? There's a foodcourt at the basement that rivals the depachikas we love in Japan. There's Hokkaido Ice Cream, European chocolates, Yakitori, Japanese teas and snacks. On the 4th floor, there's the Kinokoniya bookstore. Rows and rows of books a treasure chest of books on every topic! In between are shops for the shopaholic.

Oh! and there's this really good Gourmet Kabob shop you just have to try!"

,,Truly top-end shopping mall ... quite pricey though!!,5.0,,Truly top-end shopping mall ... quite pricey though!! They had a wonderful sampling festival of traditional Chinese New Year sweets set up for the Chinese New Year when we were there ... I did like the wonderful food center downstairs.
,,Probably the most popular mall in Singapore,4.0,,"Came here with the family during our Chinese New Year visit to Singapore. This is probably the most popular mall in Singapore (despite not being as new or as high end as Marina Bay Sands mall) and is our favourite in Singapore. It is located on Orchard road which is where most of the shopping can be done. The good thing about Orchard road is that there are two MRT stations - One on either end - so you can stop on one end and walk to the other before you get to another MRT station.

As for this mall - It has everything you need. High end and ""average""-end stores as well as a large floor for food and groceries. Easy to walk around and the plaza floor tends to have discounted items on sale in stalls. There's a fountain area for resting as well."
,,One Stop Shopping Hotspot,4.0,,"Tourist hotspot. Takashimaya / Ngee Ann City.

Reasonable parking rates."
,,My favourite mall in Singapore,5.0,,"I've been visiting Singapore every year for the last 10 years and every year Takashimaya mall is one mall that I never fail to visit. It's really a paradise for me. I love the Japanese stationery section at Lower ground floor and I always end up leaving the mall with at least something in my hands. I love the shoes section too. Really great selection of shoes and brands. And the food court downstairs is simply a food haven for me. I love the layout of Taka and the fashion and brand names that they stock are just so appealing. I never ever get tired of Taka despite other newer malls being built in Orchard Road. I'm definitely a Loyalist.
One minor complain was that the hair section for ladies is now dominated by independent sales people who seem a bit pushy and daunting because you can't even browse through and try any hair accessories without the sales person giving you some form of pressure, either Standing too close to you or trying to recommend alternative hair products to you. I don't want or like that so it's a bit off putting and they are inadvertently driving customers away."
,,Smells good!,5.0,,"Takashimaya is a good smelling mall. My man was walking more than usual just because of the smell. Surroundings is good and luxurious. We were here just because he got me my perfume, Chanel."
,,Great place for food,4.0,,"1st time being here, surprisingly they have some good food here, price is average but lot of choices, service was good and clean place, definitely will come back again..."
,,A weekend out,4.0,,"The mall feels like it has a lot going on at all times.

The central open space in the basement is often host to many food and shopping events. The open space in front of the mall also occasionally hosts events and roadshows.

The establishment has been around for some time, but it has undergone a fair bit of renovation the past few years, and it has remained condusive to be dining, shopping and window shopping in the mall.

The mall also has underground passages to several other malls, which is great when there is heavy rain, or if you just want to escape and heat and humidity."
,,A bit of Japan in Singapore,4.0,,"We love Japan, and we don't have any Japanese department stores in Australia, so this was one of the places on Orchard Rd we did go to. Half the building is regular mall and the other half of the department store. My boyfriend bought me a Pusheen soft toy, but we didn't buy much else. We looked at a ceramic knife, but it was a brand you can get in Australia for cheaper. Awesome food floor in the basement, too
I had a quick look in Sephora in the mall-part of the building but it was quite a small store. Benefit was more expensive that Australia. There was a chemist/pharmacy there that we bought the compulsory tiger balm from as that WAS cheaper that at home!"

,,"Macy's Bloomingdale, David Jones move over.",5.0,,Shopacholics don't bother anywhere else. This centre has got you covered.Make sure you have your credit card or cash ready to spend spend spend
,,Chinese New Year fair,5.0,,"Jammed pack with shoppers, one crawls around at a snail's pace. But one is rewarded by a huge variety of goodies unlike the dull Raffles City. Inventive snacks plied alongside traditional favourites. On 'till 2 Feb."
,,Good sales & choices,5.0,,"Very busy but there were sales on some of the items we wanted to buy so were very happy. Don't forget to claim your VAT back at Customer Service though they did take a service charge out of our refund as well. Some designer handbags & wallets were 40 percent discounted otherwise we would not have afforded to buy. Perfumes, cosmetics & some electronics much more expensive than Sydney. Recommend a visit."
,,Love the food hall,4.0,,One of the best place to go to when visiting orchard road. The food hall area at the bottom is great. Not just popular japanese brand but also local ones. They offer tasting and there's a great variety.
,,A little piece of books heaven,5.0,,"Hey book lover, visit this place and ready to get lost in books heaven. All you can find here old and new release books, academic books, culture and science book, everythings. They have more than thousands books in this place could took me hours here enjoy the feel of drawning in information.

The Tod's and Ferragamo stores have been renovated and are larger now with more items for sale.

,,Great Food and Shopping in Singapore,4.0,,"We had to check out Orchard Road while in Singapore. They have like a million malls, but we had heard good things about Takashimaya. And all of the things were true. We were really there for the food in the basement. We went into the Singapore ""fast food court"" section. There were tons of shops selling some of everything. Unfortunately we were there on Saturday at lunch time so we couldn't find a seat. We ended up going to Jade Palace which was excellent."

I like the basement most because October and April sometimes other time of the year, they will have Japanese fair selling freshly cooked mochi on sticks, fermented miso and other quirky treats from Japan prepared by Japanese chefs. They have a cold storage too selling imports from Japan. Basement are mostly food stuffs including rive gauche, bakeries, Andersen ice cream to Japanese diners, finger food like takopachi, papa beard custard puff. The food selection is what makes me want to go back. They have good choices on linen. Housewares and cosmetic chin care. in fact its one of those rare place you can find la mer brand skincare in Singapore. The service is polite, fast and high standards like stores back in Japan. Best time to shop is during weekday morning cos you can take yr time without having to be jostle around by overwhelming crowds. super popular place for weekend shopping warriors."

,,Takashimaya- a must visit!,5.0,,"On this last trip, I ducked into Takashimaya one night by taking the hotel shuttle bus. Had a light supper in the basement foodcourt which was packed. Tried going around the place but just didn't have the time. The place was closing by 9 or 930pm. I was unable to visit the huge bookstore (Kinukuniya?) due to lack of time. Ideally, I could spend 2 hours browsing through the varioius books there while sipping a cup of coffee. But visitors to Singapore should make time to visit the Takashimaya. You won't be disappointed. Next time, will try to allot more time to spend there."
,,Love it,5.0,,"I love the food court and the shop with the small accessories like cups and stationery. They had my favourite noodle place ever, Ajisen, but when I saw the food court with amazing Japanese food and sweets I felt a bit bad I didnt get to try it. They even had a food fair, with some interesting and some expensive food.

The bookstore was also quite popular, and my boyfriend being a fan of bookstores, he bought some books there.

As for shopping, they had the big name brands which you see almost in all other malls but honestly I didnt pay much attention to the other stores, exept of the one on the ground floor.

Defenitely going back!"

,,"Large, busy and noisy",4.0,,"Takashimaya shopping centre is in ngee ann city....although the building is in ngee ann city building and takashimaya is only one of the businesses in the mall...the place is affectionately called ""taka""

So if your singaporean friends say ""lets go to taka"" they dont necessarily mean they want to go to the takashimaya shopping centre but rather ngee ann city itself

Anyways takashimaya is the anchor tenant in ngee ann city and provides shopping for anything japanese and others.

Their basement is always full of bargains and special sales. Today there is a luggage fair."
,,Let me look first the approach please!,3.0,,"I love this store, it's air conditioned comfortable clean etc....however I would really like to be left alone when I'm looking, feeling and checking out an item before the sales assistant comes near me and follows me around, making me feel very uncomfortable and basically all I want to do is run away! So a word of advice: leave me alone!"

The bookstore Kinokuniya is the best bookstore in Singapore too in my opinion"

Not only has it got my favourite bookstore in the world (the Kinokuniya is my favourite place on this earth! It is massive, so well stocked it makes your head spin and any book lover's paradise) but great shopping and the food court is just mouth watering.

Because it was a big shopping mal, and they always offer a great sale with cheap price for a nice stuff. And they always have a small exhibition in the hall. I always get a nice stuff with a cheap price when I shop here. Especially to find toys for my kids.

This store is good, dependent on what you want, however i found the other shopping malls around it far better. Just so much to see at one time, and so many levels to go to. All got confusing. Just head to this street, and walk through every mall."
,,Loved shopping at Takashimaya Store,5.0,,"This is a store I always enjoy to visit when we are in Singapore, you only have to look at how many customers the store gets in one day alone to see the Takashimaya distinctive bags being carried around. I have never had a problem with any items or service from staff in the many times I have shopped at this store & can only say how much I very much enjoyed my shopping experience there & the fact I have purchased some lovely items to bring back home with me here to Australia. The Takashimaya store is always one I look forward to visiting & will continue to do so."
,,Center of Orchard road,4.0,,"Takashimaya Singapore is located at center of Orchard road.
It is best position to go to other shopping center in Orchard road.
Takashimaya Singapore is Japanese department store, therefore if you want to buy Japanese foods, it is very convenience to buy for you.
And also during Christmas season at first floor, big Christmas three is decorated at there, you should go to see at least one time."
,,All in one,5.0,,"A shoppers paradise and a brilliant shopping experience for all kind of Shoppers, whether Budget or High end"
,,Superb options,4.0,,"Right next to orchard mrt, this place is one of the biggest on Orchard road. Most of the luxury brands can be found here.mmy favourite is the departmental store which offers you more options than any other place in Singapore . Plenty of restaurants and there is a food center in the lower level."
,,ONE STOP SHOP FOR BRANDS,5.0,,"LIKE: good quality branded clothes, if its ur choice of clothing, u could get all u want here... under one roof. spoil urself with most brands & even accessories variety galore here.
Shud take advantage of the Singapore Shopping festival.
a store like Massimo Dutti / Polo Ralph Lauren - wud have 50%-70% off."
,,High end shopping centre,4.0,,I and my family found Laduree outlet in front of the entrance door. We bought 1 box cristal contain 15 macaroons for SGD 60. High price but good taste. You can find cheaper macaroon with different quality at Mustafa Centre level 1 only SGD15 for 5 macaroons.
,,Food Hall Good,4.0,,I like to eat in Takashimaya food court. They have so many food. The St eleven bakery is good also. The cheese cake in Food stall their also good. The sausage in Gogo also good.
,,Oh WOW,5.0,,"From the outside it looks like it only contains high-end brands like Prada, LV, Channel etc. but you have to look deeper as inside this huge mall is everything. Hundreds of shops are located within this mall, but most importantly look for Takashimaya dept. store within Ngee Ann City on Orchard Road. You will be pleasantly surprised."
,,"Love this place, especially food basement",5.0,,"This place is lovely. Especially like the food basement where you can purchase from various stalls and then eat at shared tables. Sometimes, there are special events and the stalls gave out generous food samples for you to try. Nice experience."
,,Everything can be found here...,5.0,,This shopping mall is huge and you can find huge fashion labels like Louis Vuitton and Chanel here. Other more affordable brands can also be found here. Wide range of eateries and restaurants to satisfy your craving for any food.
,,Everything High End is Here!,5.0,,"Takashimaya is located in the Ngee Ann City shopping complex. If you can't find the high end item you're looking for in Takashimaya, then you'll probably see it in the mall. All the common high end type stores are there like Louis Vuitton, Chanel, etc, and surprisingly, the more exclusive rare stores are located here also like Goyard for purses/luggage and Laduree for macaroons.

The food court at Takashimaya has a great variety of different types of foods and desserts. Best of all, you can eat in an air conditioned environment. We did visit many hawker food courts - food was good - but we had to eat ""outside"" where it was hot and humid (March 2014).

I suspect the price of goods in Singapore is more cost effective than purchasing that very same item in Tokyo. I purchased a lipstick produced in Japan in Takashimaya. I liked the color so much that I purchased the same brand in Takashimaya in Tokyo. It was ~$4 more in Tokyo! I don't know if this is true for other items, but I would suspect so."
,,excellent,5.0,,takashimaya is good shopping mall in orchard road.more branded showroom in mall too good.and excellent.
,,A Kinokuniya Book Store is Here,5.0,,"I only went to visit Takashimaya shopping centre for Kinokuniya book store. To get there you need to travel to Orchard MRT station and a short walk away.

This book store is like a massive library with every book you can think of, only difference is the cafe and you are able to purchase awesome books. There is any book you can think of in English, Chinese, Japanese and more. The store has books, magazines, journals, stationary, comics, dvds, manga, fiction, non-fiction and more. As a book lover I spent an easy 2 hours in this store and I still hadn't seen every nook and cranky of this store. The cafe has amazing coffee and cake, and the coffee isn't like your watered down American brew. It is great quality freshly ground bean coffee. The cakes are amazing and quick to sell out.

Book lovers this is heaven and a must visit when in Singapore. The Takashimaya store is one of the bigger Kinokuniya stores, so if you only have time to visit one store, then this will be the one to visit."
,,Shopping and Food Tripping,4.0,,"Almost all high class things are here already so no need to go to other malls, food court is huge but crowded if it's peak hours. but overall rating is superb."
,,The norm,3.0,,We were taken by a friend who is a local Singaporian when shopping in the mall on Orchard road. This was during the Chinese New Year so they had a big sale on. It was nothing to rave about for me. As I live in China it was your average little stalls selling foods ans treats etc. I am sure it has better things to offer during the rest of the year.
,,Great shopping- good food,3.0,,"Takashimaya is another Japanese retail giant which has an upmarket department store catering to the more affluent consumer. It has restaurants, a spa, slimming services, boutiques, a gym, drycleaners, and even an art gallery. Find good cloths for myself here. It also offers cuisine including Chinese, Korean, Indonesian, Thai, Japanese and international dishes."
,,Food Court!,4.0,,"If you're hapen to be around orchard this is the place to eat, the food court in takashimaya is great, they've got plenty of choices and reasonable price (S$ 5-10 per person), if you prefer snacks, they also have a wide arrange of selections. Shopping experience is average, it is much or less the same with any other upscale department store."
,,Worth Visiting Upscale Department Store,4.0,,"Takashimaya is a multi product department store though mainly catering to Japanese Products of very high quality . Its location is in almost center of the most famous ""Orchard Road "" . All famous brands of various products are available here. Japanese Food Court in the Basement is a must to taste delicious Japanese delicacies & other goodies .

It is one of the biggest store in Singapore & perhaps one of the many cleanest stores for which Orchard Road is worth visiting ."
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,Takashimaya is well located on the famous Orchard road. Nothing that you can't get there from high end shopping to medium priced goods. Also a great food court with local variety. Well worth a visit
,,it housed the biggest Kinokuniya in SEA,4.0,,"if there's an English book that you cannot find here, than fat chance you wont find it in other SEA bookstore....simple"
,,Great food court,4.0,,"Takashimaya was directly next door to our Hotel when we did an overnight stay on route to Papua New Guinea. My brother had visited Singapore in the summer and was constantly talking about the food court and the beef ramen noodles he had there. So, we made it our mission to have these noodles in the 24 hours we had in Singapore.
Despite visiting large shopping centres in London, this place was huge and slightly confusing the first time we walked in, there are so many floors and different departments. Knowing the food court was in the basement, it was easy to find once we located the lifts which on the other hand where not so easy to find.
There was so much to choose from, many authentic Asian dishes but coming from the Western side of the globe it was really hard to know what everything was and what we were meant to do. People kept calling us over to their stands trying to coax us with their mouth watering dishes. After walking around a few times we found a stand with some relatively familiar looking food and ordered a choice meat, vegetables and rice. The food was delicious and thankfully thanks to the jet lag we had a chance to eat before the hustle and bustle of the Singapore lunchtime rush. Price wise its such good value for money and you get a lot of food.
We didn't manage to find the ramen noodle stand which was disappointing but we did visit the centre again the next day before going to the airport for another lunch date with the food court.
In terms of shopping, well Singapore has everything you could possibly want from high street to designer and the Takashimaya is well stocked for that. I will be back to shop and visit the food court again, hopefully with the chance of trying the Ramen noodles made famous by my brother."
,,Good foods with variety,4.0,,"Just visited Takashima Square today 31/12/13 everything was on sale; from clothing to house products to sporting equipment.

For me I loved the food court here, it was so busy. Before entrance to the food court I noticed the were 3 queues to three small counter:
1. Taco Pachi- Japanese octopus ball
2. Tori Q- Japanese yakatori. We bought various style of satay sticks with different types of meat pork, chicken etc cost about $1.2- $1.5 SGD
3. Hodaki ice cream, been recommend by a local that green tea ice cream is the best. At $3.5SGD a scoop she was right.

I also try the herbal tea place. Right inside the food courts are jazzing with people ordering food from fried noodles to chicken rice. Typical meal will set you bAck no more then $10SGD.

Definately worth a visit."

,,The worst bee hoon/ carrot cake in singapore,3.0,,"takashimaya is an excellence place for shopping. Its foodcourt offer a wide variety of local delights food with reasonable price( when compared to restaurant).
But in this foodcourt, u better stay away from the carrot cake shop located next to the yoa ta fou shop.
I just had my sin chew bee hoon here for dinner. Its 5$, what u can get at 3$ in normal food court.
Its really really tasteless
No taste at all
Cant fill the stomach, waste of my money.."
,,Wide & full range of quality goods,4.0,,"Household goods, full range to choose from for kitchen utensils. Dislike: long queue waiting for taxi to go back. Waited from 10.30pm to 11.45pm to reach our turn"
,,Take cash to the food court,3.0,,"Lots of delicious food to be had, none without ready cash. We went during a very busy lunch hour and had to stake out a spot and find cash. The nearest ATM is one floor up. I'd have enjoyed a less harried time at Takashimaya if they just took credit cards at the food court!"
,,Excellent Food Court,5.0,,"If you want relatively cheap and fresh food, then check out the food court at Takashimaya! There is quite a few food places to choose from but I recommend trying the sausages from the Japanese stall that sells the yakitori - one word Delicious! The shops are fantastic as well if you are looking for something in particular. Overall, this shopping centre has everything for everyone."
,,Great food court for lunch!,4.0,,"Frankly the building is an architectural monstrosity in my opinion, but worth going to for several reasons. Although I'm not a big shopper, Takashimaya has two things worth noting.
#1. A great book store
#2. A really good food court located on the lower level.
Look for the Japanese stalls back in the corner rather than the cheaper offerings up front.
."
,,"Large upmarket department store in the heart of Orchard Road, with a large basement food hall and bargain center",4.0,,"Takashimaya is a very large upmarket department store in the heart of Orchard Road- with an adjoining large shopping mall with a vast number of specialty shops- prominent amongst them being the Kinokuniya book store.

If you're looking for upmarket items, Takashimaya is worth exploring.

If you're a bargain hunter, it's worth exploring their bargain basement area, including a large trading hall where they offer seasonal bargains.

There's also a food hall, with a variety of dining choices, as well as a supermarket and a gourmet foods area.

Well worth a visit!"
,,"good food, great clothing, wide selection of everything!",5.0,,"Every time I come to Singapore I always make sure to stop here. Even if you do not buy anything, the decor of the place is worth a visit. There are a myriad of places to eat downstairs and the stories are well labelled so you cannot get lost unlike other centres."
,,Food court is great!,5.0,,The food court is very good and not necessarily expensive as one may think. They have the basics but nice specialities too. The grocery store is good too.
,,Something for everyone,4.0,,"Takashimaya is a Japanese department store located inside the Ngee Ann shopping complex.This place can be reached with many kinds of transportations available in Singapore such as taxi , buses , and MRT's ( located between the Orchard and Somerset MRT station).
This department store have a lot of brands from entry priced to the designer expensive brands.
Also have a nice foodcourt and eateries stalls ,of everything you can imagine.
In some times , we can go for the Sale , located in the hall , near the watery pool.Branded sale as much as 70 percent ! A department store for everyone !"
,,Excellent place to visit if visiting Singapore,5.0,,This place has many thing like shopping a very good food court.I visited this place 2 times when i was in Singapore especially the food court and the Indian food section in it.If u go u shoul visit this place at least once.
,,Love the foodcourt!,5.0,,The shopping place is filled with lots of brands...it has got something for everybody. Singapore is famous for shopping anyway. I absolutly loved their food court!
,,Great mall but getting overly pricey,4.0,,"I used to live in Singapore and know things change in this city at an impressive pace. I wasn't expecting certain parts of Takashimaya to have excalated from more affordable clothing (under $150) to in general, $250+. My own fault for not paying attention, but I'd been shopping in that section for years and nothing had changed during that time. Takashimaya has an excellent bookstore, one of the few that has survived (Kinokuniya) and Paul is an excellent little cafe on the same floor. On the top level there's a few restaurants, and the bottom has a large food court with an impressive selection. Its worth visiting to peruse books, take in a coffee and window shop. You might even find something you don't mind paying the hefty designer price for."
,,Diversity shopping n love the Kinokunyia bookstore,5.0,,"this is old shopping mall compared to the new giant Icon on the next two block- easy walk through these 2 shopping mall. There is not much luxury branded like ICON but easy to shop within the 2 towers. ask for tourist privileges to get 5% discount more at some shops .

there is a big home appliance, kitchenware gift will all
styles of course the Japanese at the basement .

the Kinokunyia bookstore is giant and having all on earth books. easily get lost inside. though the kindle , iPad , SS notes conquered with ebook, there is
a taxi queue at cashier but not too long ;)"
,,Great great mall in Singapore,5.0,,"I always love to take my 2-3 hours per day to drop by Takashimaya everytime I visit Singapore, this mall look really different from ION, Paragon or even Somerset nearby, a fusion of calm Japanese feeling with dynamic structures of Singapore. Great first floor shop selling perfume and luxury brands (Although I did find the decoration for these store - esp Burberry look pretty cheap and not as premium as their counterpart in ION or Paragon). Also only here I can find the flagship store of Bally for a little indulgence.

A key highlight of Takashimaya is the Kinokuniya - where I can eagerly sacrifice a whole days just to go through all the book section here - I want to get lost in them again. The feeling, the smell, the people, all define this bookstore as one of the best place I used to be in. I totally love it.

The food court below the store in Stunning, full of different choice for food, I'm literately want to try all of the food here everytime I go there. If you have time, check of the supermarket to find tons of groceries items with great price.

Overall, I think the Orchard road will not be the same fabulous as it is now without Takashimaya"
,,One of the best!,5.0,,"Good department store with everything under one roof. Also a nice place to window-shop if you are not into spending your hard-earned moolah. The best part is the awesome food-court with some great tasting hawker-fare. Loved the chicken puff, durian puff, popiah and chicken rice."
,,Food Court,4.0,,We thoroughly enjoyed and tried different food items. The food court had a variety of vendors set up. All the vendors were very nice and more than happy to give out samples.
,,Great place to do some high end shopping.,5.0,,If you are in the mood for high end shopping this is the place to go. The nice thing is that there is a food court in the basement of Takashimaya as well which is reasonable priced.
,,The Place Courts Food Trippers,4.0,,"Before the Indonesian fires turned Singapore hazy, the Takashimaya Food Court is a crystal clear choice for those who want to savour Singapore's local and international flavours. My family went on a 4 night, 3 day visit to this first world-island and left with intent to return not just to take another whirll of the Singapore Flyer but also to give our taste buds another taste of what we missed at other Takashimaya dining places.

From baked goods to unique pastry pieces and dim sum (not to mention the soup selection) Takashimaya is a ""must-visit"" place at Orchard. Filipinos at Lucky Plaza use the underground connection to traverse back and forth. The subway/train system is accessible from Takashimaya hence stopping by again and again from city tour (*Botanical Garden, Duck Tour or the Singapore Zoo) is always a delightful stop before settling in for the night."
,,"Great prices, great service!",5.0,,I love to stopover in Singapore and restock my wardrobe! Takashimaya is one of my favourite Deapartment stores in terms of reasonable prices and great service.
,,Helpful and friendly staff,4.0,,"Besides the vast selection of things and food, the staff is friendly and helpful. Starting from the front door, security-man, Anas, gave me the direction to the basement for the luggage fair. At the kitchen ware, I found some lovely high quality plates. I told the cashier, Jennifer, that this will be a gift. She wrapped it beautifully, with such care and love that really impressed me. Wonderful shopping experience!"
,,Brilliant place to Shop and Eat,5.0,,Takashimaya is on my to do list every time I visit Singapore. Two reasons 1. The Dept Store 2. The super food court and bakery on the lower floors. More for the food really.
,,A good place for art supplies,4.0,,"We were tourists in Singapore and my daughter had this department store on her ""must visit"" list. She is a scrap booker and needed art supplies and special pens to do her craft from a store named, Art Friend. After taking a cab from our hotel along Orchard Road, we were brought to the entrance of Takashimaya and we could not help but be impressed. It is a modern and high-end department store and it really carried all the art supplies needed by my daughter. The visit proved to be very rewarding and worth the cab ride from our hotel!"
,,Nice place to look for a few arts and crafts items,4.0,,"Not having the time to venture farther to Raffles at Vivo City, I was able to drop by Takashimaya for my much coveted craft supplies - my coloring pens at the Fourum Section of Takashimaya. The building is filled with branded shops and fine dining restaurants at the upper level other than the corporate office sections of the building. And we were hastening to live in the afternoon for the airport. It was relatively easy to find what your looking for by looking at their floor plans or floor guide to assist you in finding the store you wanted to visit.

I managed to find the art and craft store . . . and immediately made my purchase. I guess I got what I came for at Takashimaya."
,,fantastic dept store,5.0,,"the best dept store in singapore. many top brands, many affordable brands, all under 1 roof. my favorite dept store in singapore."
,,Excellent place to shop and eat.,4.0,,The food choices at the basement is good. Many cuisines to choose from. Try the takoyaki and mini cheese cake. The bazaar at the square offers different sale items. Must visit if you are in Orchard.
,,Quick shopping,4.0,,Quite useful for those who are tired to go through every separate shop of every brad. Nice choice but sellers look sometimes less interested in selling something compare to the separate brand shops.
,,Nice clean shopping mall,4.0,,It's like anther shopping mall in Canada . Very clean but expensive didn't do too much for me . But I enjoy walking window shopping just to see the different from Canadian one.
,,"Nice department store, all under one roof",4.0,,"I can always find something in this department store. Agatha has a small section in the jewellery department. I also visit Harrods downstairs and the stationery department which has amazing selection of pens, keyrings, handbag hooks, fluffy toys and handbags with pets on them. Great for stocking fillers for Christmas :)"
,,Basement bag sale,4.0,,It is a big and posh mall but in the basement they have bargains.mostly bags..italian brand....really cheap ..i got a pouch...so so pretty....locals Rummage the basement for the big discounts...it looks like a warehouse inside a mall...perfumes..shoes..bags....clothes...i need more money yay
,,Rude Service at Food Village,2.0,,"The place is a bit big and crowded for my liking ~ it was hard to find out where the brands I wanted to eat at were.

I decided to eat at Pepper Lunch and the woman looked at me (very arrogant) when I made my request. ""Why you eat that lah! Go to Korea!"" Excuse you too lady. She was muttering under her breath and being generally snotty to deal with after that. I would have flipped if I found out she was calling me an ang moh.

Really put me off the experience.

FYI: Don't snatch your customer's money from their hand.

The points are only for the chocolates I couldn't get back home."
,,Takashimaya,4.0,,Ver expensive but a great place to shop. So many brands and it's so great. I realy liked the toy section when I was younger. SO much. Best place to get stuff.
,,love this mall....its endless,4.0,,"this Mall is huge, continues down in basements 1 and 2....I enjoyed shopping here....samples lots of edibles in the basements....shrimp cookies....octopus chips and squid chips :)) have lots to see here , even the german cake shop is there. got a good deal on baking pans. Shopping there is endless need few days ....also amazing food court....too much to choose from...and supermarket is also there..."
,,It's all about shopping,4.0,,"Great choice of shops and brands. During season sales impressive discounts. Amazing bookshop Kinokuniya with huge choice of all kind of books, magazines, travel guides etc. Most of the time very busy with a loooong taxi queue at the exit :)"
,,Spend a day at Takas,5.0,,"Thats what I tell all my friends who visit me. They say ""no we don't like shopping"" but after a few hours there, they have to buy something. End of year and new year sales are fantastic. Mid year sales also take place. So time your Singapore trips to match the sales. Without the sales it can be very very expensive at Takas. I take this opportunity to warm you about buying electronic products from Lucky Plaza mall nearby. Read the trip advisor reviews of Lucky Plaza and you will know why. On top of Takas on 5th floor you will find Best Denki which has everything you need. Overall Takas is worth a visit for all foreigners. My shopped at Dubai enroute. But really shopped at Takashimaya on return."
,,I loved it!,5.0,,"Shopping, shopping, shopping the the heart of Orchard rd.
I know it's just a department store but it seemed to me that all my favorite shops were there!
That have all sorts of brands, designers, foods!
I love make up and I was able to but things never seen in Europe and one shot products that will not arrive where I live.
Don't forget to visit Kinokunya, the enormous book store in the same building. There you can find magazines in many languages, loads of titles of local culture, food and history."
,,Great Food Court,4.0,,"The FC is highly recommended, but OMG it's always sooooo busy. You have to wait and be patient and unfortunately that takes away part of the pleasure. A little more pricey than others, but excellent choice and certainly worth a visit. We have been many times and each visit has been great. Park at Lucky Plaza or a local hotel and walk or get a taxi

Question for TA readers: Why does everyone else's food look better though!!!"
,,1. Upmarket department store; 2. Bargain shop ( basement); 3. Food hall; 4. Excellent bookshop- all in one building,4.0,,"Takashimaya is a large shopping center in the heart of Orchard Road- anchored by the massive Takashimaya Department Store.

Takashimaya has a dual personality: it's a large upmarket department store, but it also has a bargain basement area, including a very large sub-basement trading hall offering seasonal bargains.

There's also a food hall, with a variety of dining choices, as well as a supermarket and a gourmet foods area.

Then there's a range of specialty shops in the shopping center- a highlight is the large Kinokuniya bookshop, with a comprehensive range of books.

Well worth a visit!"
,,B1 malay manager POS,1.0,,"From Brunei...

N just walk away.. wat kinda of manager is this??"
,,Interesting Aged Japanese Mall,3.0,,"Takashimaya is quite an old shopping center. the department store is a japanese brand and cater to the higher market, but if you have some spare time, visit the supermarket on the ground floor. the supermarket is japanese supermarket and have many interesting little japanese food stalls and foodcourts.

There are a lot of restaurant choices on the higher level, from italian to korean, but for your info the prices are more step here than the foodcourts down below."
,,great varieties,4.0,,"For shopping, this is a place not to miss, given its many varieties.
My favourite outlets are the golf section and the nespresso stand.
Plenty of bargains at the golf outlet located on the upper floor. If you are an avid golfer, you are bound to find something you like, from golf clubs to apparels and accessories. There are many brands available and prices are generally cheaper.
At the Nespresso outlet, try the latest available limited edition coffee. The staff there will be more than happy to let you try the many different flavours available. And its free.
Comfortable place to shop."
,,Japanese department store in the heart of Orchard Rd,4.0,,"The thing I loved most about this store was the supermarket and food court on level B2. The supermarket carries mostly Japanese and American produce, always a novelty when not part of your normal grocery shopping routine. The fresh produce section also sells a large range of sushi, and there is a small sushi bar provided in store for eating the sushi you have purchased there.
The food court has a wide range of Asian food and drinks. It was good, but typical of good food courts was very crowded during lunch and dinner times."
,,A plethora of consumer choices....,5.0,,"You will not miss this standout red marble building rising over several stories located at the upper quadrant of the Orchard Road shopping belt. As well as having 150++ specialty stores in the adjacent shopping centre of the same name, there is their hugely popular department store with a number of top international brands located over numerous levels.

Forget the time,Takashimaya has generous opening hours and with a plethora of consumer choices to consider, time just slips by. As you come into the store from Orchard Rd, the first floor is brimming with well-known cosmetics; perfumes, iconic name clothing kiosks and the ever tempting shoe section - I never walk away without buying a pair! Prices throughout the store range from average to super expensive but you get quality for the money.

As you go to each level there is literally thousands of Clothing choices, Lingerie, Sporting Goods, Optical, Homewares, Books, Manchester, Pharmacy, Supermarket, Money Changer, Food Court area and a ‘Harrods’ like foodie heaven which is fun to walk through (or succumb to the temptation). There is even a free gift-wrapping service. On Level 4 there is a Bank, Post Office, Laundry/Dry Cleaners, ATMS (also Basement level), Payphones (all levels) and various Restaurants.

As an overseas visitor you can get a Passport of Privileges at the Customer Service Centre Level 2 or the Atrium in the shopping centre that is valid for 3 days (save a few dollars or take advantage of offers). Just bring some ID along with you to show you are not a resident. Also the Global Refund system is located Level 2 if you plan on getting some taxes back on your total purchases (check online for their policy).

You can easily spend several hours here while shopping or eating at the Dept. Store and the connecting shopping centre. We come here every time we visit this city and we never walk away empty handed!

Happy Shopping!"
,,Good Food court,4.0,,"Cheap eating and variety at the food court on the lower basement level. Get off at Orchard MRT.
Bring your passport if you shop at Takashima, you will get a visitors discount and you can also claim the tax at the airport for purchases over $100."
,,One stop shopping centre,5.0,,"you could get almost anything you are looking for. good arrangement,you won't mix up things everything is clearly identified and labelled. You may not see many of the staff around but you can easily locate what you are looking for"
,,Shopping paradise,4.0,,Takashimaya or Taka as the locals call it is a typical shopping centre....a great combination of all the designer labels to a busy and enticing food court. The staff are polite and helpful although a couple of the sales persons at the men's undergarments section can be a tad pushy. Taka is one of those shopping centres that I flock to when I have a very short stop over in Singapore.
,,You need time on your side,5.0,,"My main reason to go to Takashimaya Shopping mall in Singapore is the Kinokunia book store. The place is huge. It has fiction, reference and more. I bought these funky Zombie Tarot cards which are so cool. Not sure why I need them but…

Prepare a list before you go. They will not have everything but they do have a lot. If need be go to their website to ensure they do have what your after to save some time. Maybe even get them to order it in for you.

Love this shop"
,,Great place to eat - Food Hall,4.0,,"Tired, sick of high end restaurants or street food?? I reccomend the basement at Takashimaya Department Store on Orchard Road.
After a long day at a Trade Show there is nothing quite like a food hall. There were 8 of us (women). We'd buy Tiger Beer from the Cold Storeage supermarket and order our meals from the many amazing food stalls. The only drawback was it can get really busy and hard to get a seat.
We had some of the best fast food and it was a hell of a lot of fun.
Check out the cakes and ice cream - amazing.
And when you have finished Dinner - the store above is open!"
,,"Not the Shiniest, But Found Something Worth Buying",4.0,,"If you'll compare Takashimaya to the newer mall, it would definitely pale in comparison. However, from my personal experience, I did spend much more time in this mall since it has everything that interested me - a bookstore, a food festival (at the time of my visit), and generally the food. I remember exiting Takashimaya with a purchase so that's definitely a plus point for this mall."
,,Shopping,3.0,,"We were lucky that during our visit there is a toy sale at the basement of the building. My son was so happy to bring a lot of nice toys. We roam around the building and it is worthwhile because we were able to find good buys. You just have to look and have the patience. This is a high end store. If you are looking for cheap buys you can't find it here but if you really have the patience to look, just like us, maybe you can find a few."
,,Loved this store!,5.0,,"If your idea to shop is to be comfortable in an air con shop with lots of space and ample sales assistants, this is the shop for you! I did enjoy it, walking around, seeing and buying without all the pushing and shoving, in complete serene surroundings. Everything has a price tag and the sales in July were massive! If you are a tourist, get a tourist passport and after you've done all your shopping, collect all your receipts and claim your tax back inside the same store, well signed posted. Then at the airport you get the cash back before after immigration. No fuzz, really quickly and speedy. fantastic experience! Love this shop!"
,,Outstanding bookshop on the 3rd floor,5.0,,"For all bookworms the Kinokuniya bookshop on the 3rd floor is a true paradise. i guess several hundred thousands of books of every imaginable aspect of human history, daily life, nature and science are neatly arranged. You can spend easily some hours browsing through the books-unfortunately there are not many sitting accomodations. This shop is an ideal attraction for rainy days in Singapore and for everybody who prefers a book to an electronic gadget!"
,,Seriously good department store.,4.0,,"Perhaps because I'm from South Africa and I'm not used to 'first world' department stores, this blew me away. You can find anything you want here. The food section is delectable, the kitchen section unparallelled. The only section I don't really find what I'm looking for in is the clothing section - but that's because I look for certain brands that aren't available in dept stores.

I'm surprised some people have found the staff unfriendly. I suppose it depends on the day and the person. But I've been here about 10 times and I find the staff incredibly friendly and helpful. Always a good experience at this store. And the shopping centre in general - wonderful stores."
,,Nice shops around you,4.0,,"I'm from Bangkok, Thailand. By the way I find Takashimaya interesting place for shoppers, mainly not because the products but because the people. They treat me so well anf very honest."
,,Soba Noodle Kit (Takashimaya Singapore),1.0,,"Despite being one of Japan's largest department stores and having luxurious outlets throughout the world, I couldn't find a simple soba noodle set (mat and plate), so that I could enjoy my noodles in in the traditional manner. Sure there were all kinds of gadgets available and even though I asked several sales people they would send me to someone else who was equally as clueless. The last time I was there I was looking for sushi molds-no such luck. So, I am eating my noodles in a bowl and the sauce is getting watered down from the moisture in the noodles. Thanks Takashimaya! Are you quite sure you are a ""Japanese"" department store? I've seen little evidence of that, to be sure."
,,Typical department store,3.0,,"Nothing notable. Just a department store. Not bad, but just a store. Not sure why this is in attractions list."
,,Great Value Department Store,4.0,,"If you can't get it here, you will struggle to get it at all."
,,A longtime favourite,5.0,,One of the most established retail therapy institutions in Singapore and a favorite of our family. The food court in the basement is one of the best.
,,A japanese themed department store,3.0,,"Go to the basement n the food-court stalls are all selling japanese food. Not a big fan of japanese food though. Big department store selling varieties of retail n merchandise. Prices are on the upper side. There are sales now n then, but don't expect huge discounts. Like the made-in-candy store. Something that I find tasty n affordable!"
,,Unfriendly staff,1.0,,"Was shopping at takashimaya just now basement 2 Christmas sales. Was queuing up to make my payment , just one more customer and it will be my turn to make payment. One of the staff ,young man wearing purple color shirt told us that cashier is close and we can queue up at another cashier to make out payment. We proceed to another cashier to make our payment which is just opposite of the close cashier. In last then 5min, the close cashier was open again and other customers are making payment there. If it closing time I can understand cashier need to be closed but how come the staff can tell us one thing and do the other thing in less than 5 min. We were ask to queue up at another cashier which is having a lot of customers. I don't think takashimaya did a good job in training the staff in coordinating as event."
,,Hot Spot to Eat & Shop & Eat,5.0,,"Takashimaya ( or Taka as called by the locals) is a Japanese anchor tenant at Ngee Ann City located along popular Orchard Road. You can't miss the structure as it has a huge waterspray -fountain upfront. Getting there is effortless if you're staying in any of the 5-star hotels along or closeby Orchard Road as you can opt to walk or take a short bus trip (alight in front of Lucky Plaza and cross the road). If you choose the former, which is better, you can cover more grounds by visiting all the huge shopping complex along the way.

Takashimaya itself covers 5 floors (I think) of men/women/children clothing and apparel/
shoes/handbags/travel goods/ jewellery/watches/house & homeware, the list is endless. , and also the biggest bookshop in S>E>Asia which is Kinokuniya. This is a gem of a place for booklovers, especially Japanese mangas & comics. I love the costume jewellery area.

But one of my favourite is Basement 2. One section where you can find very reasonably priced and decent/delicious meals in hawker styles as well as local delicacies. Examples are the sweet BBQ Meat, Floss , biscuits, poh piah, dumplings.............(too much to list) and 2 of my top top favourites :: Bengawan Solo cake shop for peranakan sweets & kueh lapis (Indonesian layered sponge cake) and the fresh durian pancakes. I also highly recommend one particular new store offering Japanese cooked rice (very popular) with different fillings. ( eg salmon, scallops, seaweed, etc). For the adventurous, hygiene and food handling is excellent and I recommend you buy small takeaways to savour them in your hotel rooms (especially the sweets from Bengawan Solo).. The other section boasts a small supermarket and a few speciality shops.

One word of caution to shoe lovers, those looking for UK Size 9 (for ladies) or UK 10.5 (Men) and above, it's a hit & miss situation (except for sports trainers). Common problem among many shoe shops unless you're buying branded goods where they
come in European sizing. But still, no harm in trying.

When you're finished with Takashimaya itself , venture outside into it's corridors leading you to the world of Celine, Fendi, Hugo Boss, TAG Heuer, LV, Chanel, Cartier, Dunhill, Burbery, Tiff & Co, ...........got the $$$$$ ??

Plenty of parking space. Not driving ?? Taxis aplenty and avoid peak hours like 4.30 to 8.00pm (I've queued for over 1 hour before) on any given day. Standard waiting time 10 - 20minutes for off-peak..

One last word, you can claim GST refund from Taka as they're one of the participating outlet. I'm sure you can too with those branded boutiques but after countless trips to this favourite complex, I still haven't had a chance to try them (haha).**

Happy Shopping & Eating ***"
,,"Lack nice collections on everything, very disappointed department store plus dirty toilets",3.0,,"Can not find anything nice on this department store! Lack of children clothing collections, toys are not limited selection, shoes are average, ladies clothes are not special, top it off with dirty unbearable toilets!!"
,,Deep pockets,5.0,,Expensive is the word to describe this Japanese owned department store. But head on down to the second basement level to the food hall for cheap eats and if you're lucky 50% off sale items. Also head up to visit the Kinokuniya bookshop in the same building.
,,Disgusting cleaniness,2.0,,"Undoubtedly this is one of the finest shopping centres around, but I was disgusted with the dirty public toilets, wet floor and wash basins, toilet roll holders with no toilet rolls, and dirty marks on the passage way wall to the toilets."
,,Must Go,5.0,,"this shopping mall is central of orchard,drop off at orchard mrt u will see Ion shopping mall,then walk along the underpass u will reach Takashimaya,u can find all sort of store in this mall,included luxury ,groceries,and of cause local food."
,,"Like the shopping, hate the taxi queue",3.0,,"Ngee Ann City is a mega mall with lots of good shops and restaurant. Takashimaya is an anchor store in the mall, and has great variety of goods and food. If you like the experience of Japanese mall, with its treats of food (Japanese, local etc), the basement 2 is the place. The most recent addition is Baumkuchen, a Japanese-German ring cake which is excellent as dessert.
Unfortunately, one of the worst experience after the shopping and if one has a whole lot of bags, is the hailing of a taxi or driving from the carpark from Ngee Ann City. We were there on Saturday night at 9:30pm and the wait for a taxi was 50 mins. It was not because there were no taxis, it is that the poor design of the road leading from taxi stand causes the taxis to merge with cars coming from the carpark, which is always congested because of the bottleneck into the road. So while I will recommend the shopping at Ngee Ann/Takashimaya, I will not recommend taking a cab or driving from the mall."
,,"Wonderful. If you only visit one mall, visit this one.",5.0,,"As someone who normally hates shopping, I was captivated. Plenty of helpful staff - why can't all malls have that? To unfairly pick out two high lights: I had my first experience of Korean food; and visited the best bookshop I have ever been to - and I write that as a dedicated bibliophile."
,,It is the best shopping central in the whole South East Asia Countries,5.0,,"It is a must place to come, if you love shopping. It is the biggest plaza in Singapore. We could find almost everything we need. Good store to find our favorite brand, good restaurant to enjoy our meal. It is the best shopping central in the whole South East Asia Countries."
