,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,We had a great time with Alvin on this peranakan museum tour. We learnt about the history of peranakans in Singapore and saw all the great artefacts that Alvin has collected. We highly recommend this for those who live in Singapore as it’s a great way to learn more about the history.
,,Sincere and enthusiastic Peranakan sharing,5.0,,Enjoyed our 1 hr tour of Intan. The owner Alvin was enthusiastic in sharing his culture and open to questions about the Peranakan culture. He has a good collection of Peranakan memorabilia. Love the tea and Peranakan snacks provided to us and Alvin's warm hospitality!
,,A wonderful experience,5.0,,Thank you Mr Yapp for the interesting and eye-opening experience during our visit to the Intan. We definitely have gained a lot of insights and a better understanding of the peranakan culture. Mr Yapp has definitely offered us a different and unique perspective in this area and that has really helped us in our project. We enjoyed our visit a lot :)
,,Nice collection,5.0,,"Nice collection of Peranakan style appliance and fashion. Mr Alvin's presentation was great.
Needs prior reservation to enter. Quiet neighbourhood and walking distance to the old shophouses of Joo Chiat."
,,A look into Peranakan culture.,5.0,,"The Intan is a intimate look into the Peranakan culture and lifestyle. Alvin generously opens up his home and lets you take a look at his personal collection of beautiful Peranakan heirlooms. We were offered lovely lime juice tea and cakes as Alvin began to tell us how his passion for collecting items turned his home into a small museum. His shoe collection is amazing, every nook is filled with another interesting item."
,,A 5/5 visit to the Intan!,5.0,,"We visited the Intan to interview the owner Mr Alvin Yapp, as part of our project work regarding the Peranakan culture. Mr Yapp was incredibly friendly and welcomed us to his home with open arms. He was helpful and provided us with many insights into the Peranakan culture during the interview. Beyond enlightening us on the culture, he taught us to question and think critically about the project task we were working on. Although we did not join the tour around the Intan, the architecture of the place was stunning and unique. We would have loved to join the tour if possible!

Thank you, Mr Yapp for the memorable visit to the Intan! :)"
,,Fantastic visit to the intan museum,5.0,,"A unique museum in Singapore. A private collection of 5.000 items of Pernakan culture, from slippers to food containers, to incredibly elaborate furniture. A must see in Singapore for visitors and Singaporeans alike! Highly recommended and the owner, Alvin, takes you on a unique tour!"
,,A total gem!,5.0,,"One of the most unique museum experiences you will EVER have. Alvin, the museum owner is an avid collector and not only walks you through what he has gathered over the years - he shares a piece of his heart and passion. Be prepared for an unforgettable experience - a different and very personal approach that lets visitors discover the Peranakan culture. Don’t miss it."
,,One of the best things to do in Singapore,5.0,,"An amazing experience — don’t go if you’re expecting a stuffy institutional visit. This is Alvin’s home and you’re made to feel like a welcome guest and old friend. Visit if you want a look into an authentic slice of Singaporean life, with no airs and artifice. The house is beautiful, the company is entertaining and you’ll leave with some great memories."
,,The little gem that could,5.0,,Alvin is a master storyteller and gives visitors great insights into the lives of Peranakans in Southeast Asia. Ask him about any item in this private museum and he has a story to go along with it. I recommend this without hesitation!
,,Great interaction with owner-collector,5.0,,"Alvin was very friendly and he made the effort to ensure that everyone in the group (consisting of various nationalities) felt special and welcome. Even as a local, I learnt quite a bit of new information about the Peranakan culture from him. Highly recommended experience."
,,The Peranakan Experience,5.0,,"A must visit for a very personalised tour. Our host, Alvin had wonderful Peranakan stories to share."
,,Overrated and over priced,2.0,,"Sadly, this didn’t live up to expectations (or reviews). At $150 for 2 people it was also very expensive for what it was. A few interesting things to see in the house but the house isn’t particularly remarkable- particularly if you’ve been to Baba House ($20). The host has a lot to talk about in history and culture but overall we felt this wasn’t worth the very expensive fee."
,,A great dose of Singaporean culture,5.0,,"What a fantastic experience! Alvin is an absolute superstar. His passion for the collection of antiques and the stories associated with them are inspirational. A huge array of traditional Singaporean antiques on show with an opportunity to try delicious traditional Singaporean food. Keep it up, Alvin."
,,Very special and unique!,5.0,,"A truly wonderful experience to tour the Intan.
The museum contains a remarkable collection of Peranakan art, clothes and collectibles.
Alvin, the owner, has a great knowledge of the history and culture of all things Peranakan.
Thank you for opening your home to visitors to Singapore."
,,Beautiful Peranakan collection,5.0,,"We thought Alvin’s chop house and his beautiful collections of Peranakan objects were delightful. It’s a small museum but his stories are wonderful. The Intan and the Peranakan museum both are wonderful insights into Peranakan culture, beauty and life. Thank you Alvin for a wonderful visit and the beautifully tasty treats we had afterwards."
,,Interesting Cultural Visit with a Passionate Host,5.0,,"Book in advance to avoid disappointment!

Alvin is an energetic and passionate host who opens his house to give you a lesson in Peranakan culture and history. His style is informal so you will feel comfortable to ask questions whether you are well-versed or new to Peranakan culture. The visit concludes with tea and homemade kueh (made by his mother!).

A very enriching and personalised cultural experience."
,,Very Inspiring experience,5.0,,"Beautiful, Sophisticated, Delicate, Historical, and inspiring.The host is very nice and kind.It's not low price but surely worth visiting."
,,Beautiful collection,5.0,,"Alvin is an attentive and shares his knowledge and experience of Peranaken culture freely within his home/ museum.
It is a small home home filled to the brim with artefacts.
The beadwork collection is particularly impressive and a highlight for me. I knew nothing about this culture so was fascinated to hear about it. The surrounding neighbourhood is lovely and we were recommended a visit to the Malay hawker market building down the road which I also recommend for malay street food. Thanks Alvin!"
,,Great Host,5.0,,"Very friendly and informative Host, had a nice peranakan experience and settings. Lots of peranakan collectables to see."
,,Visit recommended!,5.0,,"This was wonderful! Interesting, informative, and just great to see a very impressive collection in a home setting. I sat and drank tea with the owner and a small group of other people interested in the Peranakan culture. What an experience!"
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"Really enjoyed how intimate, fun and friendly the experience was! My friend and I booked quite last minute and Alvin went over and beyond to find a spot for us. Great opportunity to be both in it for the culture, and be plain basic (great for Instagram!).

The tea and Kueh was also a perfect opportunity for exchange between other participants."
,,Connecting To A Contemporary Culture,5.0,,"It is incredibly unique being able to discover, appreciate and connect to cultures around the world, however there is nothing like the generosity, invitation and welcome from Alvin Yapp at The Intan in Singapore. This enriched experience illustrates his love and devotion for his Peranakan heritage which spills out of his home. Without doubt, the best Museum & cultural experience in Singapore!!! I highly recommend a visit and private tour."
,,Excellent but expensive,4.0,,"Alvin was a superb story teller and an excellent tour guide. His knowledge and personal experience in Peranakan culture certainly left us wanting more. He welcomed us into his house and showed us his treasures.

We were on a tour with about 13 people and it was very crowded and hard to see things in the upper room of the house. Alvin allowed us to stay longer to view the items after others had left which we appreciated.

The tour was just over an hour long and it cost $120 for my 15 year old son and I (for that price we received a small but delicious hot drink and a Peranakan desert/snack). We have been on 7 walking/bus tours during our stay and they cost around SGD20/hour (Jane's Tours, and The Original Singapore Tours) as well as museum all day entrance +tours which also cost about SGD20 (National Singapore Museum) I would have given Alvin 5 stars and recommended this tour to all my friends had it been closer to SGD30. It's a great tour/museum but very expensive for just an hours visit."
,,Living in the slow lane,5.0,,"A pleasant afternoon spent in the lovingly maintained Intan, learning about Perankan culture an enjoying the hospitality of the owner, 2 thumbs up for the specially brewed tea and kueh shared, like my home away from home :)"
,,Great Experience!,5.0,,Visited Intan with my group of friends. Really interesting experience to find out more about the Peranakan culture in Singapore.
,,An intimate tour through meticulously curated Peranakan history,5.0,,"The Intan's collection of rare and intricate Peranakan antiques have been meticulously curated and arranged in a charming old home filling guests with the wonderment of the epoch. Guests can experience everything from traditional ancestral shrines to mother-of-pearl embossed wooden seats and a large collection of shoes. The Intan's owner, Alvin Yapp's passion is clear as he shares his story of assembling each piece and their significance in Peranakan culture. A highly personalized unique experience."
,,Experiencing a piece of heritage of Singapore,5.0,,"A homely museum that’s displays a piece of Singapore’s unique cultural diversity. Brought back memories of my childhood days with the collection of furniture, artefacts and local tantalising delights."
,,"Positively Surprising, Refreshing, World Class Experience!",5.0,,"My friends and I visited The Intan for an Anniversary celebration and it was a memorable one! Great storytelling by Alvin, the Founder who shared inspiration lessons and insights about his journey. Creative and awe-inspiration collection of antiques! World class experience!"
,,from collecting to curating,5.0,,The story told by the antique collector turned home-museum owner deeply inspired me. Not only i heard but i saw vividly his passion and perseverance in curating the museum. I'm so glad that i took home such an invaluable teaching.
,,Really unique experience in Singapore!,5.0,,"The museum is full of fascinating artifacts and the host, Alvin, is very knowledgeable about Peranakan history and culture. He was very passionate about his ancestry and his information and stories helped us gain new insight into a very interesting culture. I felt like a visit to Alvin's museum gave me the opportunity to experience something many tourists don't get a chance to. The Intan is excellent and highly recommended!"
,,Fantastic collection and host!,5.0,,The museum houses an incredible collection of beautiful and elaborate artefacts! The host was incredibly passionate and erudite about Peranakan culture and artefacts!
,,The Intan,4.0,,"This is not a typical museum tour. Alvin and his family warmly welcome you to their home, to show their incredible collection of Peranakan artefacts. Alvin has a serious shoe habit! The extensive collection of beaded and embroidered footwear, worn by the nyonya (Peranakan ladies) is astounding. Everywhere you look, there is something of decorative interest - antique tiffin tins, embroidered door hangings, Peranakan ceramic wares, batiks, shophouse tiles.

The trip also includes tea and kueh (local cakes). The Intan is located in the Joo Chat area of Singapore, close to the Malay local market. This area has many beautifully preserved shophouses, so a visit to the Intan also dovetails with a visit to a unique part of Singapore, with very good local restaurants. It is also very close to the East Coast Park."
,,Fabulous time in the real Singapore,5.0,,"Can’t recommend this highly enough- an interesting, personal exploration of Singaporean culture. It was lovely, and informative, to spend time with Alvin and learn more about Peranakan culture (and enjoy delicious tea and sweets)."
,,Very Expensive for not too much,2.0,,"Whilst Alvin is a friendly enough guy, I found that the whole experience was lacking in authenticity, and seriously way too expensive at $60 / person for about 1 hour.

Lots of shoes, lots of Tengkat food containers and also spittoons. I recommend going to the Singapore Peranakan Museum instead.. Sorry Alvin.

I cannot recommend The Intan to my friends or visitors..."
,,An Essential Introduction,5.0,,"I took my sister who was visiting Singapore. I've been to the Peranakan Museum, but it didn't leave much impression. The Intan is not your typical museum. It is, in fact, Alvin's private collection and an actual Peranakan home. Alvin is passionate about sharing his culture. We were treated to a very special tea (which I'm still thinking about) and a selection of Peranakan kueh (desserts). A walk around the Joo Chiat neighborhood completes the experience. I consider an appreciation of Peranakan culture an essential introduction to Singapore because it is a huge part of Singapore. After the visit, you will start to see Peranakan influences everywhere."
,,A unique and eye-opening experience.,5.0,,"Before the visit to the museum, my knowledge of the Peranakan was poor or surface level at best. However the tour at ""The Intan"" left me with a great impression of the historical and cultural significance of the Peranakan culture in Singapore. The tour was acompanied with a vast and unique collection of memorabilia of the Peranakan culture that was breathed life into as the host, Mr Alvin spoke of the history behind the objects. This gave a real sense of how the Peranakan way of life was like in the past. Overall would highly recommend anyone, local or tourist to visit this place if you are in Singapore, as the place really gives an insight into an important cultural aspect of Singapore and its rich history."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"Came to the visit with barely any Peranakan knowledge but left with more than whatever I've expected. The variety of artifacts and display there is amazing and really lived up to its name of ""The Intan"" which means diamond. The host there was amazing as well, answering our questions brilliantly and is super friendly. His passion for his culture is truly inspiring. Hence, if you have even the slightest interest in the Peranakan culture, you should definitely check this place out!"
,,Wonderful museum an great host,5.0,,"The Peranakan is a very interesting part of Singapore history that Alvin share with passion, love and profound knowledge. One of the best museum experience I have ever had."
,,Fantastic InTan experience,5.0,,"Had a great evening at the InTan last Monday . Brought 7 visitors from out of town to the InTan for an authentic Peranakan experience. Alvin not only provided a rich history of the Peranakan culture , but was able to show us the large collection of Antiques in the Museum. The evening ended with a fantastic and scrumptious spread of Peranakan food and desserts homemade by his parents . A highly recommended experience !"
,,Getting to know the Peranakan culture and it's people,4.0,,"The first thing I noticed delving into the Intan is the sheer volume of exotic enamelware and artifacts decorating the place, a testament to how avid and passionate its owner, Mr Alvin Yap, is as collector and care-taker of his gallery of culture.

His enthusiasm accompanies the tours, making the experience educational and personally engaging as he related the Nyonya culture of past and present to the relics on display, interspersing it with modern day humor, giving me a good chuckle.
I appreciated how unique and highly personalized the tour was, where he got to know everyone and spoke to them personally unlike the routine mass tours of traditional museums.

Later on we had some delicious traditional snacks and tea while engaged in light conversation as he shared his and his family's experiences living through turbulent and prosperous times in Singapore.

The museum is rather modest in terms of size, and i would recommend visitors travel light as walking space is limited and shoes are left outside. Cameras are welcome but only on the first floor. The tour itself is around 1-2 hours which is just right in my opinion, and plenty of time is given to study the intricate exhibits.

I would recommend it as a great starting point and / or opportunity to learn more about one of Singapore's most renowned cultures in a quick, easily digestible manner."
,,Beautiful n' cozy Cultural Sanctuary,5.0,,"The Peranakan culture predominantly lies within Singapore and Malaysia, and yet even in these countries is practically invisible to the public's eyes. Years ago there was a really popular drama series on local free-to-air TV covering this culture, but as months and years pass the culture dies down.

The Intan seems to be just an ordinary house on the outside, but upon entering you observe how much of a cultural sanctuary it is. Singapore is a multi-religious, multi-racial and multi-cultural society. I have lived in Singapore all my life (22 years), yet there comes an epiphany somewhere through the tour of the place; you'll see that many items in the house are testimony to the point that the Peranakan culture transcends, or is an exemplary form of, the Singaporean culture in certain ways. The cultures of Singapore, like many other countries out there, are merely where different cultures draw the line between each other and (mostly) do not cross the line. Indians in Little India, Chinese in Chinatown. It's hardly true in the 21st century but the fact that these separate towns are where the separate races congregate shows the inherent separation of the different cultural heritages.

The Peranakan are different.
One of my groupmates tried comparing the cases of coexistence of separate cultures between Peranakan and the global scenarios today, to see if we knew why the Peranakans coexisted across separate cultures so well. The host didn't have an answer, but after walking around the house and observing its artifacts, I believe I have an answer.
The Peranakan culture is a synthesis of cultures that is built by marriage and love,
and the cultural cohabitation today, built by merely geographical necessitations upon a general population can therefore not compare to it."
,,A Fulfilling Trip,5.0,,"You are transported back in time the moment you step past the threshold. This peranakan house is literally brimming with antiques. The host was welcoming and showed great enthusiasm when sharing his stories. Learnt a lot of interesting backstory, overall a good and fulfilling time spent."
,,Interesting Place,5.0,,"Filled with unique peranakan artifacts, host is also very friendly and answered all our queries! Very interesting experience."
,,A trip to the Intan,5.0,,"The trip to the Intan was definitely a memorable and insightful experience. Not only was Mr Alvin very welcoming, he was also willing to share his view on certain topics, for instance the heritage and history behind The Intan and Joo Chiat Road as a whole.

The Intan as a whole is a beautifully structured house, decorated with Peranakan items, furniture, and fittings."
,,Beautiful place!,5.0,,"Fantastic place to learn more about Peranakan heritage. A museum that feels very homely, and Alvin is a very knowledgeable expert and great to chat with!"
,,Piece of Art,5.0,,This particular place was filled with artefacts that we hardly came across. The host itself was enthusiastic and knowledgable about the whole Peranakan Culture. It was a worthy trip to learn about the different mechanisms of the culture itself!
,,Insight into Peranakan culture,5.0,,Visit to the Intan and our discussion with Alvin was one of the highlights of our educational visit to Singapore. Alvin has great insights. It is worth paying close attention to what he has to say - both on contemporary and historical matters. Warm recommendations.
,,What a lovely evening!,5.0,,"Culture, tradition, heritage and cuisine conveyed and delivered with authentic expertise and passion in a truly unique setting. The Intan is an experience that's definitely one of a kind. The only one of its kind, if you will."
,,a piece of culture,5.0,,Nice chit-chat and great story about the peranakan culture. Visitors from around the world. Collection is good.
,,Secret garden,5.0,,"Singapore is not only about modern skyscrapers and massively impressive parks and shopping/casino extravaganza. The Intan is offering you to touch Singapore’s real native culture called ‘Peranacan’ by Alvin, a very proud and passionate peranacan person himself. A place is packed with carefully selected collection of Peranacan antiques that is a real pleasant surprise to your eyes and soul."
,,A man and his house,5.0,,This is a gentleman's house who is passionate about his heritage. He has so many things on display in such a tasteful manner. We started out by having some tea and visiting while people arrived. Allen then told us of his heritage and of his beginning his collection. There were 12 in our group so many good questions were asked. After about an hour we had an official tea with several of his favorite treats. It was very interesting. It was my first day in Singapore and a nice introduction.
,,"Engaging, enlightening, and fun",5.0,,"Our visit to The Intan provided a window into a world we knew nothing about, the rich and intriguing history of Peranakan culture in Singapore. Alvin Yapp has assembled an amazing collection of furniture, porcelain, shoes, and other antiques that tell this amazing story in his own Peranakan home. His pride and loyalty to his culture shine through. A great way to spend an hour in Singapore!"
,,Eye opener,5.0,,thoroughly enjoyed time spent looking around the interesting collection of beautiful things and speaking with Alvin about the history of his collection.
,,Amazing place!,5.0,,Went there as a local student to learn more about the Peranakan culture for my project earlier this year! The place was well furnished with the owner's collection and my friend and I were being brought through the space with explanation of the artefact. The knowledge that was translated helped me a lot with my project and I enjoyed the experience as a whole! The owner was friendly and helpful with all the questions I had :)
,,Peranakan performance...,5.0,,"Yes - you will discover lovely Peranakan artefacts in a traditional Peranakan household setting - but more importantly the Peranakan culture, their influences and their beliefs will be brought to life through the storytelling of your host, Alvin, who has spent a lifetime saving and documenting Peranakan history. A delightful and enlightening way to spend a couple of hours... thank you Alvin."
,,It was very good,5.0,,"A great museum, done differently to the normal. Host was knowledgable and welcoming. Highly recommended."
,,An eye-opener experience,5.0,,"Such a unique and eye opener experience for me. Never known so much about Peranakan culture until the day I visited this museum. Alvin, the owner of the museum, did a fantastic job in taking care of all the collections and also in explaining the Peranakan culture! And I really love the Peranakan tea and kueh (cakes) served to us!"
,,Very Interesting,5.0,,"Alvin did a great job in describing everything, and making the whole trip interesting and enjoyable! We especially enjoyed the snacks at the end of the trip."
,,A very informative learning journey for preschoolers,5.0,,"My preschoolers are on a mission to discover more about about the Peranakan culture and this was the perfect place for their learning journey. We wanted a place where the children can have a close up experience with all things Peranakan and Alvin did not fail to delivery. This gives the children much more exposure than the museums where they can only see things behind a glass panel.

Even though this is the first time Alvin hosted preschoolers (32 of them!), he managed to engage the children and our learning goals were well met. Thank you Alvin for hosting us and making a mess of your house!"
,,What an unique museum!,5.0,,"The Intan is a truly unique museum! Alvin, the owner of the museum also lives here with his family. Started at the age of 7, Alvin became passionate about leaning his Peranakan (this unique culture started about 200 years ago when the Chinese men married Malay women) heritage, and he found he could do so by collecting antique pieces. The Peranakan families speak English at home, follow Chinese traditions for holidays, weddings and funerals, but follow Malay culture for food and clothing. The fusion of different cultures created some very interesting antique pieces that combined all 3 cultures. From our conversations with Alvin, you can tell he is very proud of his heritage, and very passionate about preserving it, which displayed in every corner of his house.

Alvin was a very good at communicating among Chinese, English and Japanese speakers, interchange the words in 3 languages fluently. As an excellent story teller, he retold his stories about obtaining some pieces with such fondness that you could tell how much he enjoyed putting this amazing collection together.

Highly recommend this museum! You can learn so much about this unique culture from Alvin and be happy there is a passionate man who is trying all he can to preserve it."
,,A Culture That Cannot Fade,5.0,,"The Intan is a peculiar experience. Although a ""museum"" in technicalities, it does away with the distance of observing artefacts behind a glass and invites you to actually inhabit the space of a Peranakan household. Alvin's passion for all things Peranakan was infectious, and his presentation was thoroughly engaging and peppered with personal stories about different artifacts that can't be replicated in a normal museum. Highly recommended to both foreigners and locals who are searching to rediscover Singapore's heritage."
,,A Unique Experience Tucked in the Streets of Joo Chiat,5.0,,"It was a detailed and enjoyable tour held by Alvin who was very well-spoken and engaging in the way he told his stories and experiences regarding the Peranakan culture. The tour was set in a very cosy and down-to-earth setting and Alvin was very welcoming when it came to friendly discussions and questions by the guests. The food and drinks were palatable and a pleasant surprise too! Overall, I did learn a lot from this tour and felt that it was an authentic experience for me. Plus points for the energising spirit and engagement from Alvin!"
,,Authentic taste of Peranakan culture,5.0,,"Alvin was a great and hospitable guide, and his sharing of his own experience made the tour more genuine. There was an array of artefacts that carried much history, which Alvin was glad to share with everyone. Not only do we learn about the history of Peranakan culture in Singapore, but other countries as well."
,,The Intan Experience,5.0,,"The Intan experience was really interesting and fun! I really love it!! But just that I didn't explore the second level because we have to go back to school but after all it was really interesting, I would really like to go back there and continue to learn and know more about it! Definitely an interesting and fun experience I ever had!!!"
,,A beautiful Peranakan house in Joo Chiat,5.0,,Alvin was very hospitable and knowledgeable. He was able to shared interesting facts about Peranakan culture which we normally not heard of. He served us with delicious nonya sweets to end of the visit. A good place to learn about Peranakan history and culture. A must place to visit for visitor and locals alike.
,,Excellent place for heritage and culture trail in Singapore,4.0,,Friendly owner of the house with his mum made us feel welcome. He has interesting furnitures and antiques of peranakan and even shares us the cuisine of their culture foods. He will share and story to those visitors about the race and the history of it. Don't forget to ask him questions. Be curious but respectful about sensitive questions. Hope those visiting will have a pleasant trip in Singapore and experience great wonders here.
,,Unique experience and hospitality,5.0,,"Visited the Intan and I'm awed by the well-curated prized treasures of all things Peranakan. The owner, Mr Alvin Yapp, has been a collector for over 30 years and has deep knowledge and stories to share about almost every item! What makes this a truly wonderful visit is Alvin's authentic passion and appreciation of the Peranakan culture and his warm hospitality and generosity in welcoming visitors into his home that doubles-up as a museum. Highly recommended for a unique experience!"
,,Great experience !,4.0,,The most intriguing item in the house was the awesome collection of beaded shoes ! Even Imelda will envy!
,,Engaging and enlightening experience,5.0,,"The Intan was truly a treat for the senses. It was my first visit to a collector's home and Alvin shared passionately about his love for his Peranakan heritage and answered our questions (and our teens') most readily. We also got a peek into this collector's life and passion that has made the Intan evolve into a true Singaporean gem. I will be proud to bring my friends from overseas to visit the Intan. It also seems like a quaint and intimate venue to host gatherings with friends. The hour whizzed past quickly and there was never a dull moment. Thank you, Alvin, for being such a wonderful host and making it a most memorable visit."
,,Cultural and sensory experience,5.0,,"The Intan houses an unbelievable Peranakan antiques collection. The host, Alvin was an amazing storyteller and it was such a unique experience to be able to touch and feel the antiques while learning about the Peranakan culture - not an experience we will get in any museum! The experience concluded magically with the talented Alvin on the piano gifting us with lovely melodies of yester years. Fabulous experience indeed!"
,,Left my heart with Intan,5.0,,"Enjoyed the reception! As you proceed, it gets very interesting ...your eyes dart everywhere..there’s so much to see and everything brings back memories! Definitely a home to visit again"
,,Hidden Gem,5.0,,"Singapore is full of surprises. This is one of the best. If you are interested in learning about a very different culture and it’s history, food and clothing, then make a visit to Alvin’s special cave and be entertained"
,,Excellent Visit,5.0,,"Alvin met us at 10AM on Sunday morning with tea and cakes. While we enjoyed his collection, the best part of the visit was the opportunity to sit with Alvin and discuss Peranakan history, his collecting passion and life in Singapore.
We highly recommend this Museum."
,,Interesting and informative tour,5.0,,"I was visiting Singapore for 2 day’s before flying to Perth, WA. I had read about this place so emailed for an appointment. Alvin replied promptly and was very accomodating. I was meeting a friend who was living there and she had not been to The Intan.
Alvin was very informative about the Peranakan culture and the antique collection is very impressive. He is so enthusiastic and a great ambassador for promoting Peranakan history. A really interesting and unique tour worth going to if you are interested or want to learn more about this Culture."
,,I don’t get it,2.0,,"The experience that I had at this establishment doesn’t really match the description on Trip Advisor. I don’t know if we just came on a bad day or what. There was very little detail or info given about the pieces in the home, even when Alvin was asked. The tea experience involved tea and 3 bites of cake being offered and laid out in advance of our arrival, but little to no info about the formalities of the Peranakan tea ceremony given. The exhibition of items is essentially a mish mash of things for which Alvin doesn’t seem to have much history. For the $60 fee and travel costs to get there, it just wasn’t worth it. Stick to the real museums."
,,An intricate collection of Peranakan Culture,5.0,,"If you have some time to visit this hidden treasure, do it. This is a home-made collection that has been painstakingly amassed over more than 10 years. The care Alvin has made in creating and maintaining of this museum is tremendous, and his knowledge in Peranakan Culture and History speaks volumes of the research he has done, as well as the passion he puts in his work. Not only will you see incredible relics of an almost bygone era, you will get some intimate insights on Peranakan culture as a whole."
,,An intriguing glimpse of Perankan times,5.0,,"The homeowner: Alvin provides a delightful insight into Peranakan history in his fascinating house, which is a treasure trove of eclectic Peranakan treasures that he has collected over the years. We really enjoyed having the opportunity to discuss his culture over delicious pomelo tea and authentic cakes, made by his aunt. Depending what time of day you go, tea or lunch is offered. The visit lasts an hour. Ensure you book ahead as this is a popular attraction and gets booked up fast. We only live around the corner now so hope to become regular visitors and learn more about the Peranakans! Would highly recommend. Thank you Alvin!"
,,Beautiful collection,5.0,,"Alvin provides an amazing glimpse into the Peranakan culture of Singapore. His home is filled with beautiful antiques from this culture and he gives incredible detail of his heritage. This family run business is exceptional and they offer you the chance to opt in for dining with them (lunch, dinner, tea, etc.). This collector's home is a must see if you are interested in understanding Singaporean culture!"
,,Amazing lesson in history and culture!,5.0,,"The Intan was an incredible experience. Not only is the collection eclectic and immersive, but Alvyn (the owner and curator) was an amazing host and storyteller. His stories on Peranakan culture and history were illuminating, and the discussions we were able to have with him were insightful and made the visit truly immersive."
,,Amazing and wonderful!,5.0,,I had a really enriching and fun time at The Intan! Enjoyed every bit of it! I love how the interiors of the house retained the peranakan feels as well!
,,Eclectic collection.,5.0,,It was interesting learning about the history of Singapore and its various cultural and ethnic backgrounds. The tea and sweets were also very good.
,,I am amazed!,5.0,,The owner is really knowledgeable and passionate about Peranakan culture. Although it is not a very big space but it has a very a comprehensive collection and I am amazed and learned a lot from him!
,,Passionate owner generously sharing his knowledge,5.0,,"Alvin is a charming, charismatic, knowledgeable, patient host. His collection is dense and well kept. A well spent afternoon of discovery."
,,Left with a story to share with my friends and family!,5.0,,"Alvin and his mother were very friendly and showed the best hospitality throughout my visit. Alvin was very passionate in sharing his Peranakan stories, and how he started collecting Peranakan antiques as well! He is an incredible and humorous host! I will definitely recommend his tour to my overseas friends and relatives as well! Well done The Intan!"
,,A diamond in Singapore,5.0,,"The Intan would not have been a place that I would have actively sought out in a tourism experience, happily however the organisation hosting my visit saw fit to have dinner with Alvin, his parents and his amazing collection.

Alvin invites you into his home, his life, his culture. A traditional dinner with amazing desserts, I tried a little of everything and was not disappointed.

An experience that I will not ever forget and will suggest to any who plan on visiting Singapore as one of those must do experience.

It has opened my eyes to more that the usual tourist trails and maybe now I will be more adventurous and seek out this type of experience in the future.

Do yourself a favour, don't miss this...

Thank you Alvin, many many thanks for the experience."
,,Tour,5.0,,Interesting short tour of Alvin’s private collection of Paranakan artifacts within his 1950s home. Lots of ladies shoes made with tiny beads. Alvin was very friendly
,,Beyond amazing!,5.0,,"Alvin has a beautiful home and truely unique collection of antiques. From the beautiful artefacts, to the generous hospitality! It was truely an amazing journey through time exploring the Paranagan way of life! A unique experience! :)"
,,A personal insight into an amazing culture,5.0,,"How often are you welcomed into a person's home filled with treasures from the past and then regaled with stories about each painting, accessory, furniture, etching and clothing that give you an insight into a relatively unknown culture outside Singapore, Malacca and Penang?

With clear passion for the Peranakan culture and history, Alvin Yapp, is delightful as he is knowledgeable. No question is too ridiculous, no comment is received without a smile. Alvin as tour guide and storyteller, becomes your friend well before the tour is over.

I'm not sure exactly how long the tour was officially supposed to last, but I know we stayed way past the tour hours and were never made to feel unwelcome, or that our hosts were itching for us to leave. The hospitality, the tea and the nonya kuehs added to the experience of visiting a favorite relative one hasn't seen in a long while.

Thank you Auntie, Uncle and Alvin for a simply marvelous morning. The 4 of us had a wonderful time invading your home. :-)"
,,For true museum lovers,5.0,,"Even the biggest and brightest museums can be dull if there is no content or, even more important in this case, the guides are not up to the task of taking you through. That is what you won't experience when visiting The Intan because your host Alvin is a master of hospitality and has such profound knowledge about exhibited objects. After all you are going to his house and seeing the collection he built from scratch. I definitely recommend The Intan to museum lovers.."
,,Visit to Intan,5.0,,"Visited Intan with a colleague on 010218. Intan has a very nostalgic and rustic feel about it - It captures the Peranakan culture and lifestyle very well. The host, Alvin, is very passionate about educating the public on Peranakan culture. Since this is a family owned museum, Alvin is able to deliver experiences to immerse small groups of visitors. This is a place worth a visit."
,,Every item in here has a story!,5.0,,Had a really fun time checking out the place. The owner is very hospitable & nice. The museum has some of the finest collections I have ever seen.
,,Excellent Experience of Peranakan Heritage,5.0,,Awesome and unique experience of owners' Home Museum. Out of the box and a personalized walk-through with refreshments after the tour. Enjoyed the chat with the friendly owner and we learnt more about Peranakan History~ Thank you!
,,A great reminder of our Singapore heritage,5.0,,Met Alvin at a corporate event and was invited by him to his family museum. We are thankful to him for hosting us. He spent time sharing with us on the rich history of the peranankan culture and showed us various antiques. We enjoyed listening to his stories and I had a better understanding of the peranankans. Highly recommend for both locals and tourists :)
,,Nice experience but not for everyone.,5.0,,"Just had a visit here with Alvin as the owner/guide. I can guarantee you will enjoy his hospitality here. And don't forget that it's by appointment only!

It was nice to see all his personal collection as not every collector are as passionate as him. His stories give us many insights about Peranakan culture and heritage through his perspective.

I suggest you to actively asking him about things that you're curious about since there's no reading signs to explain things like a conventional museum. And your visit will be a better experience if you already have some background or interest in Peranakan culture, so you can get more context about the basic Peranakan culture.

For a casual goers with a high curiosity and striving new cultural experiences, this is a must visit! Also good for research about the culture. But for you who's looking for more of an easy cheap convenient type, cultural appreciation like this may not be your cup of tea."
,,Beautiful experience at The Intan,5.0,,Loved learning all aspects of Peranakan culture at The Intan. It was a very different experience from any other museum - very personalised as Alvin has put together antique collection himself. He is very knowledgable and passionate about Peranakan culture. It was a lovely experience to be in his home talking about his heritage. Would definitely recommend!
,,A wonderful hour with Alvin,5.0,,"Discovered quite by chance, we are so glad that we visited this gem of a museum. It was an enjoyable and informative visit. There are many unique and beautiful pieces of peranakan history in Alvin's home/museum."
,,Interesting Discovery,5.0,,"Interesting discovery and learning about the Peranakan Culture. The host, Alvin is friendly and explaining us in details about the place and the culture. The traditional snacks/deserts that was served afterward was fantastic in taste and presentation. Highly recommended."
,,Interesting and beautiful,5.0,,"I got to visit The Intan earlier today with a friend who lives in Singapore and who shared with me her love of all things Peranakan. The museum was such a fun and informative experience, and Alvin is a great host. I could have stayed there for ages, there was so much to look at. Each part of the house was full to overflowing with beautiful, histotrical items from this tiny, vibrantly coloured subculture. Prior to visiting Singapore I had never even heard of Chinese-Malay Peranakan culture before, so I'm really glad I got a chance to meet Alvin and learn about it."
,,Very Interesting,5.0,,Awed by the amount of antiques and history behind them. Interesting and educational at the same time. The location is in the area of good Peranakan food as well.
,,A window into a rich cultural world,5.0,,"The Intan provides visitors with a rare opportunity to immerse themselves in the living world of the Peranakans. Alvin is willing to open up his home and share his passion with people from around the world. He is a charming and informative host.
The Intan is certainly not suitable for everyone: if you don't have a serious interest in history and culture, I don't think you will get much out of it. If you do choose to visit, I would suggest you check out the Singapore Peranakan Museum first, to build a better understanding of the rich heritage of this unique culture.
After your visit, it's worth taking a walk around the surrounding area: first to the Malay shopping village on Changi Rd and then down Joo Chiat Rd to the Peranakan-themed shops and cafes of East Coast Rd."
,,Intan is a pleasant surprise!,5.0,,Intan is indeed a gem with beautiful and well kept Peranakan artefacts. Its a must-visit place to understand more about this culture. Alvin is a wonderful and talented host!
,,History and culture with a personal touch,5.0,,"The Intan features a fascinating personal tour of the home museum
of Alvin Yapp. Through his passion for his culture, collection and stories we learn about the unique Peranakan culture which embodies the hybrid/adaptation of Southeast Asian, East Asian and European characteristics formed over the past 2 centuries. This is a part of Singapore that is both historically and aesthetically significant but not often explored. The museum includes furniture, crockery, jewellery and intricately beaded footwear. We thoroughly enjoyed the visit and highly recommend it. Check out the Peranakan houses in the area after your visit, the architecture is amazing."
,,Beautiful place back in time!,5.0,,"This is a place not to miss, if you are keen to appreciate the Peranakan Culture. For the first time, i got a glimpse into their living days, on what makes them significant. Walking into the intan, is a walk back in time, hosted by the Peranakans themselves. Great stuff!"
,,A place you should not miss.,5.0,,"Brought my foreign colleagues to The Intan for visit so they can have a chance to view a private collection of Peranakan treasures. We were impressed by the vast collection and wowed by our very friendly hosts! And yes,the tea snacks were fantastic! This is a very different experience from visiting a regular museum and you should not miss this if you are in this part of the world."
,,You will like it,5.0,,"I visited this place on a Friday afternoon and wow.

The moment i entered i was blown away by the sheer density, variety and intricacy of items decorating Alvin's (the host) compound. There is such complexity in the details of all the ornaments and antiques, it makes you wonder about the motivation behind the creation of these precious items.

The place felt very spacious despite the not-so-big actual floor area. Only a fool would not be able to appreciate the work, care, and passion Alvin poured into this museum/home. It is truly a collection that would impress anybody.

Not to mention I really liked how down to earth and relaxed Alvin is and inspires the same kind of comfort his guest(s) have with him."
,,Super Like !,5.0,,"My second time visiting The Intan, and I am compelled to write another review because The Intan deserves it :-) This time, I went with colleagues as part of a staff bonding activity. Was I bored since I was here before with friends earlier this year ? Not at all. Because there is so much to see ! And Alvin the host had so much to share, I actually learnt even more :-) And this is such a wonderful place for phone-cam enthusiasts. You can capture many instangram-able shots of Alvin's collections and house, and go away feeling so satisfied :-) And I guess that's why The Intan is such an enjoyable experience. You get to feast your different senses, including your creative cells ! Love the kuehs and the awesome tea Alvin makes.

Thank you Alvin !!"
,,The Intan is a rare treat !,5.0,,"My daughter introduced The Intan to my brother and his wife, who were in Singapore for a visit in mid Nov. What a treat it was for all of us ! Alvin Yapp, the host was such a great story teller. He kept us engaged with his interesting narration of the Peranakan culture, from its history, how it evolved and the way it is today. And there was so much to take in, in his lovely house of museum with an impressive array of Peranakan collection ! This was an enriching experience for us, one of its kind.

We still talk about Alvin and his house :-) I highly recommend The Intan if you want to learn more about this culture that is quite uniquely Singapore !"
,,Potential but disappointing,1.0,,"There are very many interesting items to look at, but I have no idea why there are important. The host was congenial, not well organized, and past me to a nice but not well informed colleague. This was certainly not worth the time or money. It does have potential but needs a competnet guide."
,,The Intan,5.0,,An amazing and must visit place whether you are local or foreigner. One of its kind. A cultural experience not like any museum.
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"I went to this museum with my colleagues.
The tour is very informative and interesting. It is very exciting to listen to Alvin, the owner talking about the peranakan culture. Most of all, I can really felt Alvin's passion in conservation of his ancestor's culture throughout the tour. This is definitely a place for you to pay a visit if you are in Singapore."
,,A Farewell Gathering,5.0,,"Set in a Peranakan Vicinity, a household decorated with lotsa Peranakan objects & memorabilia, nice cozy place to gather for a small party, loved listening to Alvin the owner sharing his memories"
,,A rare gem in a cool neighborhood!,5.0,,"Our host - Alvin is fantastic! He is so knowledgable about the Peranakan culture and heritage. Even though I am a Singaporean, I only know very surface about the Peranakan culture and heritage and Alvin explained so much and I was so amazed! The Intan is so pretty inside....such a great great host and place. Please visit this place! IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH your money. Who cares about if you have WIFI in this place. The knowledge from Alvin is good enough to keep you memorized for 2hrs straight!"
,,Peranakan treasures and more,5.0,,"I stepped into a time warp back through years of Peranakan culture, with curator and owner of The Intan, the affable and informative Alvin Yapp, culminating in a cosy gathering with friends as we shared an evening which included food and music."
,,An afternoon well spent,5.0,,"A personal tour by Alvin Yapp and a wonderful discussion about cross-cultural heritage, influences and perspectives."
,,I time travelled back to my childhood..,5.0,,"I am a Peranakan (a Straits Born), and having lived with my grandparents and experiencing the lifestyle of the Babas and Nonyas back in the 60s, visiting The Intan transported me back in time to revisit my past as a 5 year old.

The rich heritage that's embedded in the exquisite handcrafted beaded slippers, jewelry, accessories, clothes and the crockery tells of a culture in a generation where beauty is so refined. Embellishments in their belts, accessories and even their cupboards speak of a lifestyle in an artform. The photos were reminiscent of what I see in the palours of my old home at Carpmael Road - those of my great grand parents.

What Alvin has at the Intan is REAL - real stuff used by real people and one like me could only say that the tour is nothing short of AWESOME.

Take it from me - I am a Peranakan."
,,Beautiful experience,5.0,,"What a nice an beautiful place displaying the Peranakan culture. And best of all, Alvin, who talks very animated about his ancestors culture. A must see experience in 'brand new' Singapore!"
,,Entertaining Day exploring Peranakan culture,5.0,,"My visit to The Intan was very exciting and informative. Alvin, the curator, was very hands-on and forthcoming with his knowledge of authentic Peranakan heritage, being a Peranakan himself. His extensive collection is enough to wow a crowd for a period of time. I look forward to coming back sometime soon."
,,Excellent Tour,5.0,,"This is our second tour to the Museum. We absolutely loved it again, and saw more items that the museum had purchased. It is a short taxi ride from the city, and located in a very safe part of Singapore. Alvin's parents were there that day, and it was a delight to meet them, and talk about the Museum and its contents. The little sweets provided at the end of the Tour were delicious. Once again, Alvin, the tour did not disappoint us."
,,The Intan,4.0,,Personal tour given by The Intan owner Mr. Alvin Yap was fabulous with personal touch. I felt I was in his guests rather than just a visitor.
,,A memorable experience,5.0,,"A memorable experience- Very well presented, well with my time. Alvin is very knowledgeable and is able to share his knowledge in an interesting way."
,,Perfect day at The Intan,5.0,,"Beautiful house with great heritage and history, Alvin knows how to entertain guests very well and interact with us to give us a good experience. Two thumbs up! Will be back!"
,,Culturally Rich... Exquisitely Beautiful,5.0,,"A highly enriching journey of the Peranakan culture... and the artefacts... truly intricate, beautiful and some are just magnificent! Must try to visit!"
,,Added So Much to My Trip!,5.0,,"Before I booked, I knew nothing about Peranakan history or culture. I learned so much from my 2 hour visit. I went alone and got to spend as much time as I like with my host - who had tons of knowledge. Felt very exclusive and special. There is a little snack included, too. Highly recommended."
,,A personal experience,5.0,,"It felt like a very exclusive experience, hidden away along a quietly gorgeous street of incredibly well-maintained old double-storied shophouses.
The collection at The Intan was amazing. Alvin was the real MVP here, exhibiting himself almost as if he were one of the items on display. His warmth, charisma and genuinely engaging nature struck us as quintessentially Peranakan.

You are welcomed into the beautifully-furnished living room, and offered a cup of warming tea (a specially chosen blend). Alvin takes some time to get to know each guest and their interests before introducing himself, the house, and his collection. He invites personal questions about his culture as he carefully and meticulously explains intricacies in the melding traditions of his proud heritage.
After a tour of the house, Alvin offers some traditional kueh as a light snack with more tea, over which he lightheartedly answers more of our questions about his amazing collection and his plans for the future.

As a child of mixed heritage myself, having grew up in a nearby neighbourhood, I was fascinated by Alvin's story and his curiosity and perspective. When we met I mentioned that I had recently moved to Sweden and that my mum was excited to visit Abba The Museum in Stockholm.
Before we left, Alvin excitedly sat us down in the living room and played us Abba's Dancing Queen on the piano. It was a lovely gesture, my mum and I were entranced in nostalgia.

Thank you for a wonderful afternoon, Alvin. All the best for the future (:"
,,Enlightening,5.0,,"The trip to The Intan was an Enlightening experience. I didn't know a lot about the Peranakan culture, and the trip there shed light on a lot of things. The person who made the private museum, Alvin Yapp, was very helpful in the trip I had with my friends. He told us about the different types of Peranakan, and there were many antiques there that also help us learn about its customs. Overall, the trip was just simply amazing and its a trip worth experiencing."
,,Value-added Trip!,5.0,,"I was amazed by the antiques presented at The Intan. At The Intan, you are able to ask questions from an authentic baba about all the questions you have about the Peranakan culture.. From the Kam cheng we saw to the tea sessions we had at The Intan, Alvin provided us an descriptive insights of it.
Alvin himself is very knowledgable and friendly! This trip is an enriching one and definitely recommending those who are interested in knowing more about the Peranakan culture. Thanks Alvin!"
,,A magical trip!,5.0,,"I felt like Alice in Wonderland where I was transported into a magical world filled with lovely pieces of antique furniture, artefacts, accessories & other collections that speak of the Peranakan culture, with Alvin being the Mad Hatter (LOL). Alvin was truly entertaining & mesmerised us with his charm, fascinating stories & of course the yummy nonya kuehs made by his mum! He even played the piano & sang several songs in different local languages to entertain us & willingly obliged us with a few more songs when we shouted ""encore""! Tk Alvin for opening your beautiful home to us & sharing such a rich culture with us! For those who have not yet made a visit, this is something that I would recommend you to try. Have fun folks!"
,,Fascinating!,5.0,,The experience was really interesting and it felt so organic. Mr Yapp was very friendly and knowledgeable!
,,The Intan,5.0,,"When you first enter the house, you will be immediately captivated by the fascinating Peranakan antiques. Visiting a collector's house which doubles up as a museum is certainly a unique and wonderful experience. The owner is akso very enthusiastic to share about his Peranakan experience and I would definitely recommend this place to visit!"
,,Nice place,5.0,,"The visit was great! The owner, Mr Alvin was very nice to all of us and treated us with the upmost hospitality and showed us around. He answered our questions patiently and with the greatest detail, not missing anything out that can help us in our project."
,,Awesome exclusive museum!,5.0,,"I went to The Intan with a few besties thinking that it is a usual museum where the artifacts or collection is housed in a big building and you get a ticket from the counter for entry. To my pleasant surprise, The Intan is actually the charming home of Mr Alvin Yapp, a Peranakan who collects all things ... Peranakan. Alvin is a wonderful host and his collection is beautiful. Ask him anything about any of his collection and you will enjoy the little stories and history. It is heartwarming to know that someone is passionate about his culture and heritage and willing to share it with the public. The Intan is an awesome museum and I'd recommend it to anyone! All tours are by booking only so remember to plan ahead your visit."
,,"A meeting of old & new, homely perankan museum in modern day Singapore",5.0,,"I have seen my share of museums, art galleries, art houses, etc. But I didn't expect to be so enchanted by this place. This small peranakan house & the host, Alvin Yap, has enough stories to keep you interested in Peranakan culture. Wait till you hear him play the piano and sing local Peranakan nursery rhymes. You'd never forget such a lovely experience."
,,Peranakan culture comes alive... through artifacts and entertaining owner!,5.0,,"The Intan is a quaint, one-of-a-kind house that pays serious homage to all things Peranakan. The authentic artifacts, ranging from dainty purses to 6-foot cupboards to wedding trousseau, all come together in a mind-boggling collection that reflects owner Alvin Yapp's passion for the 'Nonya"" culture. It's literally sensor overload as every nook and cranny is filled with objects associated with the rich Peranakan culture. But The Intan not just a space that houses beautiful objects; Alvin is a knowlegeable Baba who will rock your Peranakan world with his passionate account of the history of the Straits Chinese and the stories behind the artifacts. Oh, did I also mention that he is funny and warm and makes you feel like you are visiting an old friend's house rather than a mini museum?"
,,Journey Of A Lifetime,5.0,,"Love love love this place the moment I stepped foot inside. It's a place that is full of life, full of colours & exotic collection of Peranakan heritage. Every place within the museum is a unique photo stop! Every collectible item in the museum tells a story. Totally would recommend and it's so worth the visit. :)"
,,A delightful afternoon outing,4.0,,My friends thought we were just going to visit a home museum but the takeaway was far greater than my expectations. Alvin regaled us with stories and nuggets of information. The nonya kueh that he treated us to was also superb and it was like catching up with an old friend. I would definitely recommend anyone who wants to have first hand info about Peranakan culture to come to Intan.
,,A life-enriching walk down memory lane,5.0,,"Where do I begin to explain the magic of this place? Let me start at the beginning. I was born in Singapore but moved when I was a little girl. There was something about my annual trips back to visit family in Singapore that left me aching for more. To experience the ""old Sinapore"". The Singapore beyond Air Conditioned shopping malls. This little gem has what I have been looking for. And Alvin is so full of knowledge and generous in spirit that it took everything in me to say ""goodbye"". I wish I could have stayed longer. Thank you, Alvin and Intan for the unforgettable experience."
,,Peranakan Jewel,4.0,,"The Intan is a tiny place packed with Peranakan historical nuggets.
Be prepared to be bedazzled by the musically talented host and be enthralled by his animated charm."
,,Very enriching and insightful experience with Alvin Yapp,5.0,,"My friend and I visited The Intan about 2 weeks back to interview Alvin Yapp for our project work on Peranakan Art. Alvin was very helpful in providing us the answers we were looking for and offering up non-textbook answers based on his personal experience. He was candid, to the point and very knowledgeable. We took away many valuable ideas and we are very grateful that he was able to take time off to have us interview him. To add, Alvin was very prompt in his email replies and willing to meet despite the fact we had to delay the interview due to clashes in our schedules. Would definitely recommend The Intan to anyone interested in learning more about the Peranakan culture! :)"

I was greeted by warm and gracious host, Alvin Yapp, who took time to explain everything you need to know about Peranakan Culture. I had the pleasure to taste some delights and experience what it is like being in a true peranakan home. The Intan has so many peranakan antiques that my eyes had feasted on. You'll have to see it to believe!"
,,Fabulous Insight on the Rich Peranakan Culture in SG,5.0,,"It has been almost a most since I had the chance to visit The Intan and I must admit I still had flashes of the place and the stories I heard. It must be due to the great delivery of the history and folklore by our Host, Alvin whom is a Baba himself, thus often able to relate to the culture from 1st person perspective. A must-visit place for locals and tourist alike if you're keen to be soak in this unique heritage which only this part of the world has."
,,Good tour,5.0,,A fantastic trip that tells you so much about the peranakan culture. The host is very friendly and makes the whole trip so interesting. Excellent.
,,Unusual home museum,4.0,,A beautiful home full of antiques and stories and a charming sociable host. Not a near walk from the MRT (nearest station: Paya Lebar) so it may be better to take a cab or a bus (bus service 33).
,,What a gem...!,5.0,,"The moment I stepped into The Intan, I couldn't stop my head moving left and right and up and down and gasping in delight. Beautiful Peranakan wares from bowls, tiffin carriers to ginger jars and more filled every inch and corner of this amazing 'museum'. And if I wasn't in awe as yet, there were beautiful ornate Peranakan jewellery, delicate beaded shoes and sarong kebayas....you simply have to visit The Intan to take in and admire the beauty of this place.

Alvin Yapp's passion for and clear articulation of the peranakan culture make it all very interesting. We truly walked out of The Intan much more informed and knowledgeable about this unique culture. Alvin encouraged us to ask questions and he answered every one with clarity and depth. It really beats reading or listening to guides as it is the case in normal museums.

The experience was both educational and fun. Aside from the irresistible nonya kuehs, Alvin entertained us with peranakan songs and even got us to sing along. It was an unusual experience and certainly a very good one."
,,What a fascinating museum.,5.0,,"What a hidden gem of a museum this is. Whilst small froim the outside, it is certainly large on history and content on the inside.

,,A Wonderful Surprise,5.0,,"Was invited to visit the place with my colleagues and friend to discuss on a charitable project. Never expected myself to walk into a museum. Was warmly invited in by Alvin and to my Wonderful Surprise, I found myself engulfed in a rich collection of Peranakan antiques and collectibles.

,,"Peranakan culture: creation, convergence and conservation",5.0,,"Spent an intriguing afternoon at the Intan, exploring the multi-faceted experiences of Peranakans in Singapore. Owner, Alvin Yapp, personally hosted us, candidly sharing his intimate insights into the Peranakan heritage and his journey of being an antique collector and owner of a museum. As a home museum, the Intan is one of its kind and definitely worth a visit, but it was the rich conversation with Alvin that sealed the deal for me. It made history come alive and challenged me to embark on my own journey of unearthing my roots and identity as a second-generation Singaporean."

,,Insightful and Engaging Intan Experience,4.0,,"I went to the Intan Museum as part of a school trip organised by NUS OSA (National University of Singapore Office of Student Affairs). It was a very insightful and engaging trip with our host Alvin being very passionate and knowledgeable about his Peranakan heritage and identity. It was a good discussion regarding issues related to the Peranakan community, and he was able to answer our sometimes difficult questions in a satisfactory manner. The fact that the museum was an actual house being lived in by Peranakans (Alvin and family) made it this museum especially unique, being a living museum of sorts. Highly recommended for anyone who would like to learn more about Peranakan culture."
,,Tasteful & Insightful Look Into The Lives of Modern Peranakans,5.0,,"Very lovely, honest and insightful tour. Great hospitality from Alvin & Mom!!
I brought my girlfriend along to tour around the private museum. In all honesty, I think the unmistakable paraphernalia is already reason to walk in, and if not least because these are the cultural artefacts of the Peranakan people.
However, the best takeaway is STILL the honesty that is characteristic of Alvin. He is smart & witty & it illuminates how proud he is of his heritage and how Deserving Peranakans should be, of their rich history!
Went in willing to know more about a unique traditional people & came out with answers beyond my questions. Cheers."
,,A nice visit,5.0,,"The Intan house giving me a feeling of what a real peranakan house is like and Alvin, as a baba, is very knowledgeable and passionate about his peranakan culture. I did know more about peranakan culture by talking with Alvin."

Alvin and his family greet us really nice and friendly. We also tried traditional cakes. He also explained the history of peranakan and the culture."
,,Interesting and informative visit,5.0,,"I viste Intan in a heritage tour organized by NUS free for students interested in Peranakan culture. It is basically a old Peranakan house converted into a private museum with lots of Peranakan collections. The host Alvin is quite friendly and it's also the first time for me to learn the full picture of the development of Peranakan culture in Southeast Asia. To be frank the house and collection don't compare to those Peranakan museums in Malaca or Penang or the governmental one in Singapore downtown but still it's really a lovely place and you can see a lot of you are willing to dig deep.

Alvin offered us some tea and Malay snacks even played a Peranakan music before we left. In general, it's a lovely morning and would recommend. Btw it's very near to the famous black pepper crab restaurant 永诚餐室 so maybe a visit to the museum followed by a crab dinner will be nice.
我们因为是参加学校活动所以有巴士接送，地理位置来说乘坐公共交通可能会略有不便。没有在那边吃晚餐不知道具体如何，不过作为对土生华人文化感兴趣的朋友，推荐。"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Alvin is extremely knowledgeable and provided a great visit. Excellent hospitality, really friendly and personal. We had an hour or so visit as part of a business educational and Alvin showed us his home and provided us with tea and homemade snacks.

,,A very interesting short introduction into Peranakan culture,4.0,,"First important notes in my opinion are: you have to plan your visit and I would recommend going with at least 4 people because otherwise it is rather expensive. However, the hospitality you receive is enormous and of all things my boyfriend and I did it felt the most personal you'll experience. We received a basic introduction into the Peranakan culture and how it evolved, about the place and the owner itself, and be able to look at some beautiful antiquities. In addition, we got served twice with some delicious tea and some peranakan sweets (which you might or might not enjoy - I myself wasn't but it was nice to try it).
In conclusion, it was a very nice but rather expensive, and if you'd like to learn more in depth about the culture you'd need to visit an additional museum."

,,Amazing experience!,5.0,,"On our 5th trip to Singapore, we wanted to go somewhere we haven't been before. Found The Intan while searching for such a place. We read all reviews about the place and made our decision to visit. Communicating with Alvin thru email was a breeze. He responded promptly and we confirmed our visit.
On the day of our visit, we arrived an hour early and found The Intan close. We called Alvin and he was kind enough to direct us to a juice place where we could wait. In addition, he cut his lunch date short and welcomed us to his place 30 minutes before our appointment. What can I say?
Alvin was a most gracious host, explaining the history of Peranakan culture and his collection while serving us delicious rice cakes.
I was most impressed with his collection of embroidered and beaded ladies' slippers and those intricately beaded curtain holders! Too bad we couldn't take any pictures.
If you are into history, culture and art, you shouldn't miss The Intan!"
,,Visit to The Intan... a WOW! experience,4.0,,"A group of friends and I were warmly received by the Founder of The Intan himself, Mr Alvin Yapp, and we were free to browse and admire the many beautiful, ornate and intricate Peranakan antique pieces and displays. Alvin shared his love and passion for the Peranakan culture and how he started The Intan. Over light snacks and tea, we talked and exchanged views about our unique heritage and it felt more like visiting a friend's home instead of a museum. Alvin even offered to play the piano as we were about to leave. What a treat! The Intan appeals to both the foreigners and locals to learn and have a deeper knowledge of the rich and vibrant Peranakan culture. Thank you, Alvin, for the wonderful hospitality!"

There were 12 of us and everyone of us enjoyed it tremendously. Highly recommended"
,,A House of Education & Discovery,5.0,,"Highly recommended. The collection is jaw-dropping. As they all came from real history (ie. someone owned them) from different times/places, I felt like I had literally entered a time zone from before, when Alvin (a lovely host) talked about them.

It was indeed a wonderful and enchanting afternoon at the Intan when my friends and I visited this cosy home-museum. We were truly awed by the intricate craftsmanship of the majestic altars, gorgeous artefacts, delicate outfit and foot wear that the Peranakans were famous for (no one would have thought that even the spittoons could serve as colourful artefacts, with the distinctive lotus and phoenix prints on them). What was more impressive was the hospitality and warmth that Alvin and his family showed us. Having turned his home into a museum, radiating the essence of the Peranakan culture, his passion and dedication was evident as took us through the exhibits, fascinating us with interesting facts and stories from his childhood.

Then the following year The Intan was awarded the best overall museum experience award.

Love how it is smacked right amongst the other residences. There are so many big and little items in the building to appreciate that one could probably spend an entire afternoon to learn about the stories behind each one of them. Also, don't miss out on savouring the delicious peranakan kuehs. I was lucky to be visiting at a time that the owner was hosting a charity event and got to fill my stomach with other yummy food like mee siam, worth every bit of the calorie! It was also a memorable evening of beautiful performances of multi-ethnic songs and lovely company, thank you for the awesome time, Alvyn and Intan!"

Apart from the tour, we were served ""nonya kuehs"" a local dessert, and some other fabulous Peranakan bites like 'kueh pi tee"".

Another point to take in is the location of The Intan. It is nestled amongst the old Peranakan neighbourhood near Joo Chiat and Katong.

Tours come with really fragrant tea and delicious kuih-kuih (cakes). Alvin himself is a very friendly and fascinating man, and will answer any of your questions with aplomb - be it about his Peranakan heritage or life as a collector (or his day job, or his numerous interesting projects for The Intan...). Peranakan culture is unique and fascinating, and this is a great way to get introduced or for those who are already familiar, gain deeper insight.

He will also answer any of your questions with aplomb - be it about his Peranakan heritage or life as a collector. The collection itself is not big - think about it, it has to fit into his house - but interesting nonetheless. Plenty of beadwork, tiffin carriers (how people in the past used to do takeaway). Tours come with tea and cakes (""kuih-kuih"" in the vernacular). Alvin uses other small touches to make you feel very at home in his house and museum. For example, ask him for a pamphlet of any language and chances are, he'll have it - try it! Peranakan culture is unique and fascinating, and this is a great way to get introduced or for those who are already familiar, gain deeper insight. Go for the experience of visiting a museum in a home, and the guide's personalised treatment."
,,"Unique space, excellent host",4.0,,"Met owner and guide Alvin Yapp who lives in his home-museum. He has so many stories of the objects and his culture, also his honest sharing of discovering his heritage and being a collector.

Though small, there are a lot of gems if you take the time to observe the details at the Intan. The museum doubling as a home also adds to the warmth factor - like you are visiting a Peranakan friend instead of a museum per se.

Again because there are so many items in a small space, things are not immediately discoverable and you may have to ask about everything. Maybe the solution is to come back again and see what you find!"
,,Intan Museum in Singapore,5.0,,"If you would like to have a close observation of Peranakan culture in Singapore from an unusual angle, the Intan Museum could be an ideal choice. It's museum, yet a house, with a large collection of Peranakan stuffs ranging from daily utensils to inner decorations, nearly every perspective you could think of regarding a Peranakan life. The owner presents the house museum in an interactive way and if you would like to try some genuine Peranakan food, his mother would bring you home-made delicacies!"
,,A complete and personal encounter with a true blue Peranakan,5.0,,"Learn first hand about the unique living Peranakan culture from true blue Baba Alvin Yapp. Through his personal collection of 'artefacts' amassed over years, Alvin regales you with his life story as a Straits-born Chinese. Almost a rojak in its own right, the Peranakan culture takes the best of the various beliefs, customs and rituals of the different ethnic groups in Singapore and serves it up on a tok panjang. (Be sure to ask him about that!)

Be amazed by his collection of spittoons and tingkats and hear the story about the very elaborate Baba & Nonya wedding bed (and ritual.)

I loved the mother-of-pearl chairs and the side-board altar.

You will be entertained by Alvin's many stories and 'gossip' from the moment you enter through the pintu pagar and the tour ends on a sweet note with tea serving up traditional kueh kueh."
,,A beautiful Peranakan oasis,4.0,,"The Intan is always an interesting place for us to visit over the years. We know the owner on a personal basis and had seen the museum grow with its collections. There's always something new that Alvin would share with us on each visit.

Despite its tiny space in a shophouse, Alvin managed to make it feel very inviting and cosy. The gorgeous Peranakan pieces are placed strategically on both levels. Check out level 2 with all the lovely beaded sandals, Kebayas and unique wedding bed. One note though, because of the tiny space and many antiques are not in showcases, this is not the best place to bring little kids, out of respect for the owner.

This is a great place to learn about the interesting Peranakan culture from Alvin who has transformed his love for his culture into a very special 'home' museum.

A must see in Singapore !"
,,Wonderfully immersive experience.,5.0,,"The museum, and in particular, the owner, Alvin Yapp were able to answer so many of the questions we had about Singapore and its historical culture and way of life.

The collection of household items, examples of clothing and pictures bring all things Peranakan to life.

,,Fascinating visit,5.0,,"Over tea with owner Alvin Yapp, you will get to learn more about the Peranakan or Straits Chinese way of life.

Ask Mr Yapp about how each thing contributes to a Peranakan's lifestyle, and he will share quirky stories and nuggets."

Alvin invites paying guests into his home to enjoy this beautiful space full of carefully curated antiques and artefacts - and to hear him talk about what makes Peranakan culture so special.

,,Interesting peranakan tour and talk and tea,5.0,,"Even though I live in Katong and have visited the Persnaksn museum, there were still plenty of things I learned about the Persnaksn culture of Singapore.

,,An insight into Peranakan culture in a Peranakn home,5.0,,"Expecting a brief hour visit to a Peranakn house, we were delighted to be welcomed by Alvin and his mother into their home. This was not any ordinary house, nor even a museum, but a combination of both, a family home brimming with Peranakan artefacts, so much to see in such a short time. Alvin was very generous with his time, as newly trained Peranakn Museum docents, he engaged us in thoughtful discussion as he courteously let us overrun our allotted time. Do visit, well worth it!"

,,Alice in Peranakan Wonderland,5.0,,"I remember feeling like Alice in Wonderland the first time I stepped through the door of Alvin's Intan. I walked into a bizarre world where all things Peranakan collided to reside in one house. My senses were overwhelmed by the myriad of furniture, knick knacks, tools, fabrics in a myriad of colours that can only come from the Peranakan culture. It's the kind of place I wish I could lock myself in for a week and cook up some tales. It's different from a conventional museum because you can touch, feel, sit on the 'exhibits'. It's different because the 'host' is actually lives here. Alvin is a wonderful host, brimming with joy and passion for his heritage. He literally lives in his culture. You feel it when he shares with you his life, and the many stories behind all the collectibles... it's quite something. He makes it all come alive through witty, intelligent banter, laughs and smiles. Do it!"
,,Learning about Peranakans the fun way,5.0,,"A group of us docents from the Peranakan Museum had an outing to the Intan last Tuesday. Not really knowing quite what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised by the great time we had.

A most enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half.with friends."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"We were welcomed into a beautiful home showcasing the best of peranakan culture preserved in every corner (furniture, carvings, porcelain ware, beadwork and embroidered pieces).

The Intan certainly lived up to its name, definitely a gem of an experience."
,,Is it a joke ?,1.0,,"It must be a joke. I am still wondering why we paid such a high price for this so called ""experience""... Actually it is a shame but I have to admit: yes I paid 180$ for visiting a small house with not much to see + a diner which was not home made with not enough to eat for all of us ! Nothing to drink except (non mineral) water... And we were pushed out when the owner decided it was time for him to go to sleep ! Yes, it was very likely a (expensive) joke... Respect to the owner: a real businessman that managed to earn more than 3500 $ in less than 4 hours staying home ! Please, save your money, go to a real Peranakan museum + food court instead !"

Thanks for having us!"
,,A home in a museum - or vice versa,5.0,,"One who enters the intan will get a sense of being welcomed into a very loving home.

More than just a museum, it is a journey into times past- every piece of antique tells a story, richly told by owner and curator Alvin, who will wow visitors with funny and interesting tales of families, traditions, superstitions and heritage.

Tucked in a quiet corner of the cultural enclave of Joo Chiat, I really enjoyed the afternoon reviling in the stories, sights, sounds and smells of the intan.

The gift shop was a great idea and nice touch to cap the visit."
,,Enriching experience,5.0,,"The visit to the Intan was indeed an eye opener for my 19 year old son. The tour of this unique home was conducted non other than its owner, Alvin Yapp. He is as vibrant as the house itself. His commentaries and explanation of the Peranakan culture was interesting and helped us to understand the Babas & Nonyas better. The displays and exhibits are rich and colourful. Highly recommended to individuals and families alike."
,,Gem along Joo Chiat,4.0,,I'd be remiss if I didn't share this gem of a find along Joo Chiat Terrace. Alvin was the quintessential host who regaled us on the history and stories of his house and treasures. Some museums make you feel initimidated however it wasn't the case here where you feel like you are entering into Alvin's inner sanctum; this private museum was cosy and intimate. You could witness the influence of Western and Chinese civilisations to the Peranakan culture. It was a perfect end to a busy week!
,,Your neighbourhood museum,5.0,,"Tucked in a corner of the Joo Chiat Terrace estate, this is an awesome yet cosy peranakan museum.

The knowledge of the Curator made this an exceptional experience to better understand where pieces came from, how they were made."
,,The Intan,5.0,,"It is the most interesting home museum I have ever seen.
The owner guided us personally and explained in detail all his collections throughout the years.
You will see some important pieces that you won't see in other Museum .
It is highly recommended to visit if you are interested in Peranakan culture."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"The Intan is an intimate museum within a shophouse. Curated by Alvin Yapp, who has been a longtime collector, the residence is replete with an extensive display of Peranakan material culture. Visitors also will enjoy the exuberant interaction with Alvin. When visiting Singapore, a must side trip is going to Joo Chiat, which has long been a center for Peranakan Chinese culture. Besides The Intan, there are many fine restaurants, beautiful streets that evoke times past, and the wonderful The Intan."
,,A truly unique experience!!,5.0,,"Who knew a museum could be so lively, warm and relaxing at the same time? Though it's small, it has a big story to tell about the Peranakan culture. The thing that truly amazed me was the Mother Mary figurines and each one of them depicts a different culture. Real beautiful(:"
,,Absolute Rip off!!!!,1.0,,"We went to the Intan for an event party with 20 friends in December. The price for visit of the house and diner sold as the full Peranakan experience was quite expensive (S$ 180 per person, actually S$225 if you are less than 10 guests) but we had read the amazing reviews on Tripadvisor so my wife and I were quite excited to spend the night there.
Alvyn is a nice host and welcomed us very pleasantly with a small cup of tea, trying hard to remember each of our names as the 20 guests were coming in. The visit of the house was short and not very impressive when you have already been to the Peranakan museum downtown.

During the visit we learnt more about Alvyn's life than about the history of the furnitures or the Peranakan culture.
Alvyn already owns his own company doing industrial stickers like the one you can see on taxis or airplanes and comes back in the evening to be host for his daily guests visiting his house.
His passion is to buy originals and replicas of Peranakan style furnitures and pile them up in his living room and attic.
Because this has a cost he created a simple but successful business model to sponsor his hobby: having tourists or fellow Singaporeans naively looking for authentic local experience to pay an entrance fee at his doorstep.
The experience is unforgettable and we are still talking about it with my friends from time to time. But unfortunately this is only to remember how we had been totally ripped off! Everything is fake, from the twenty-one century furniture replicas to the ""true Peranakan Mom's meal"" which actually is coming direct from a food court Catering. Alvyn's mother who was there actually told us herself that she did not do the cooking but that somehow the food was her recipe. Although as we have been Singaporean residents for many years we realized that we had tasted the exact same recipes at the hawker center in the past without knowing it was Alvyn's mom recipe. How exciting to meet her after all those years...
Sadly we had to ask her if we could have one portion of the food each because we had all paid the 180$ for the diner but she told us that that was it. At this price we expected a reasonable wine glass or at least some beers but there was nothing else but Peranakan tap water and not even feuit juice nor soda. All the tea had been finished long ago during the welcoming phase.
The best of all was when we were politely but firmly escorted to the door at ten O'Clock precisely because ""My friends this is my house and I now have to go to bed... but I have some good address 15min walk from here if you want something to eat or drink"". Personally this is the first time in my life a "" friend "" invites me for diner with too little to eat for everyone, no drinks, kicks me out at 10PM and ask me 180$ with a Peranakan smile!

We actually had a good time because all our friends were there but for the rest...

This place is absolutely to avoid for diner. And for the house visit, I'll advise you to keep with your first idea of going a second time to the Peranakan museum which is free by the way...

No offense Alvyn, it was nice to talk to you but seriously don't make people pay that price for something they could get for 10 or 15 dols at the nearest Food Court... this is called greed or robbery as you prefer.

But maybe THIS is the real Peranakan experience as we learnt from you that Peranakan people are great Businessmen... what a lesson!

I also was bewildered when you wrote all of us to make a comment on Tripadvisor as if you did not realise what was going to come up. So here you are : TERRIBLE

But am I the only one thinking that?

E."

Alvin is a very hospitable and knowledgeable host and there is probably no better place to experience peranakan culture than in the Intan.

,,Fabulous place,5.0,,Peranakan treasures that takes you back in time. Plus point is the hospitality of the hosts who makes us feel at home immediately
,,Visits to the Intan,5.0,,"I'm Florence Leow, and I've been raised as a Nonya in a jati (true blue) Peranakan household back in the 1960s. Becos of my background, I felt a deep sense of nostalgia when I visited Baba Alvin Yapp's museum-home.

First, the host Alvin, is downright passionate about Peranakan history and culture. Secondly, that vibrant attitude of his is reflected in his vast collection of Peranakan objects and fixtures and fittings.

- I visited Baba Alvin's home as a guest for a charity event first in Dec 2012; followed by a visit for a museum-house tour. Alvin is extremely knowledgable & detailed about Peranakan culture & history. His knowledge about the specifics of Peranakan artefacts is indepth.

As a Peranakan myself, I can truly vouch that the artefacts on display in Alvin's home: may they be tingkat tiffin carriers, spittoons, kasut manek beaded slippers, the ornate day-bed etc...all the furniture/fixtures are all of a authentic quality.

I felt being immersed in a deep sense of nostalgia when I first entered Alvin's home. It's true that the Peranakan Cina or Baba culture is slowly being eroded in fast-paced Westernised Singapura.

- But thanks to Baba Alvin; this zesty entrepreneur with a passionate heart for his ancestral heritage and culture has managed to upkeep a home-museum that captures the glory of a certain distant past and of which continues to enthrall both foreign and local visitors alike.

-with Baba Alvin's sincerity and warmth, and his mum's superb cooking of delicious Nonya desserts; I can assure you that visitors to the home-museum will enjoy both intimate cultural knowledge and feast their eyes on amazing and intricate Peranakan objects."

Opening the museum was never planned in the beginning – it is part of Alvin’s personal journey to self discovery, spurred by his curiosity to understand more of his Peranakan heritage. The museum garnered the ‘Best Overall Experience’ award during the Museum Roundtable Awards. MICE groups should consider visiting The Intan because Alvin is one of the most engaging persons to talk about Peranakan legacy, besides the fact that he organises enjoyable traditional Peranakan cooking sessions and intimate dinner."

,,Never too young to learn about Peranakan Culture,5.0,,"Together with a group of 14 10-year old children and 3 teachers, I went to The Intan to learn more about the Peranakan culture through a 2 hour interactive conversation with Baba Alvin Yapp. The children were very engaged. They were interchangeably taking down notes and asking questions. They were also showed around the house and the artifacts. What I initially feared that they would break any precious artifacts was unfounded. The children were very well behaved and careful with their surroundings. Baba Alvin Yapp was also able to make the subject matter entertaining and easy to understand for the 10-year olds. It is indeed a fantastic way to learn history, being surrounded by it!"

Owner Alvin Yapp must be the genie who filled the entire house with every aspect of Peranakan material cultural including jewelry, beaded slippers, bridal daybed with ornate hangings, alter table, furniture, nyonyaware, I was most fascinated with the collection of colourful Czech-made tiffin carriers and spittoons. Alvin is a consummate host who will enthral you with stories of his collection. This is a private museum with a special caveat-you can touch and feel almost everything, promising you an intimate and personal encounter. And Alvin will play the piano for you to boot."
,,Culture revisited,5.0,,"I visted the Intan for the 3rd time for a business meeting with the owner - curator, Alvin. Though he said we could meet somewhere more convenient to me, I chose the Intan without hesitation. The 3rd visit didn't disappoint. Alvin was his same charming affable self and his depth of knowledge of Peranakan culture and artifacts again impressed me. The cozy museum ambience continued to fascinate and the wealth of the Peranakan artifacts continued to awe. I left the place feeling much more enriched, while the heritage houses of Joo Chiat Terrace just enhanced that sense of history. Will I visit again? Oh, yes, unequivocally Yes."
,,A museum like a home,5.0,,"It's interesting how a small place can actually hold so many artifacts. What makes it better was the owner Alvin's unreserved explanation of the culture and background of Peranakan and Intan. Of course peppered with lots of stories, jokes and laughter!"

,,A brilliant rose-cut diamond,5.0,,"The Intan (Malay for rose-cut diamond) certainly lives up to its name!

Owner Alvin brought us around his house-museum which is chock full of Peranakan objects, large and small, beautiful and exquisite - altars, furniture, kebayas, beaded shoes, enamel tiffins, spittoons and more!

According to Alvin, a Peranakan object is one which is either made by the Peranakans, or made to suit their tastes which is a curious blend of east meets west. Among other things, we saw altar figures of Chinese, Thai and Indonesian Madonnas, and a silver sireh box which would not have looked out of place as part of an English tea set!

As a Peranakan himself, Alvin also shared his views on Peranakan culture and what it means to be Peranakan. He taught us a little about how to see things through the eyes of a collector-curator. All amidst much laughter!

A delightful museum with a consummate host!"
,,A Rare find,4.0,,A quaint museum housed in a private residence with a treasure trove of artifacts keenly introduced to you by an engaged curator.
,,Beautiful little gem with a rich heritage,5.0,,"The Intan is a beautiful museum of all things Peranakan and I'd highly recommend it to all to visit this place. If you're Peranakan, it's a great place to learn about your heritage and history which is fast losing its grip in today's society. Even if you're not, it's a great place to learn about the Peranakan culture. I shall not attempt to elaborate on the Peranakans - better to leave that to the experienced volunteer guides there! Alvin our host made us feel right at home and it was definitely an interesting afternoon.

Definitely two thumbs up!"

In addition, he is extremely knowledgeable about the Peranakan culture, its roots and its traditions - I believe nobody can provide better insights and describe the Peranakan heritage as colorful as Alvin can.
Would recommend a visit to everyone interested in the ""real"" Singapore - especially for somebody who is looking for a special experience away from the tourist masses."
,,Learning Journey for staff of land transport gallery,4.0,,"Alvin is passionate thus he makes a great host. Although he may have said the same things a thousand times the beauty is it sounds like the first to us.

The enriching cultural knowledge was a good feed for the mind and the kueh with tea was scrumptious for our appetite. A good experience that all should try."
,,Afternoon tea at the Intan,4.0,,"We spent the afternoon learning about the Peranakan Chinese culture and community with Alvin - who started searching / defining what made something ""peranakan"" over 13 years ago. Interesting anecdotes about the culture, community and museum curation.

It is a hidden jewel at the heart of Joo Chiat."
,,A hidden Gem!,5.0,,"The intan is a private museum hidden with lots of eclectic curios from the east and west, typical of the Singapore-born Peranakans style of old. It is a step back into knowing one's roots and also showing how the culture can evolve and adapt in the 21st century and beyond. Alvin and his family are gracious to be able to host us in their own working ""home"" and it is indeed a privilege to be able to view his family ancestry and collection."

,,More than a private museum,5.0,,"One of my favourite places to visit in Singapore. Hidden within the Peranakan precint of Joo Chiat, The Intan is an experience every visitor to Singapore should have at least once.

Alvin Yapp is a wonderful ambassador for the Peranakan Culture, with lots of interesting stories and anecdotes to share, along with his wonderful collection of Peranakan Antiques. I highly recommend you bring your family or friends along, and book The Intan for an afternoon of high tea, with a wonderful spread of Nyonya cakes and desserts, and if you asks nicely, maybe Aunty Yapp, Alvin's mother will cook her famous Mee Siam, a wonderful rice vermicelli dish in tangy tamarind and fermented soy sauce."
,,An excellent peak into the colorful Peranakan culture,5.0,,"Very interesting and insightful introduction to everyday Peranakan life. The unique thing with The Intan is that it is both an authentic Peranakan home where the owner Baba Alvin lives as well as a private museum so you get the best of both worlds. A great way to spend an hour or 2, this tour should appeal to not just culture buffs but for anyone curious about those charming & gorgeous Peranakan houses & life behind those doors. Highly recommended for both visitors to Singapore as well as those living here. The Joo Chiat neighborhood is well known for its many famous eateries but don't come just for the food! Combine it with a visit to the Intan and gain a deeper appreciation of this fascinating culture."

Sipping on tea, savouring Nonya Kueh and enjoying the company of friends as Alvin shares with us his wealth of experience as a collector and updates on his latest treasures.

,,Family ties at The Intan,4.0,,"Stepping into The Intan was like stepping into a rich and beautiful treasure trove; at once distant yet familiar as well. We are ""peranakans"" too you see. Yes, Straits born Chinese. Our small group of six, which included my mum, two adult siblings and my two sons. We felt that familiar and immediate connection to a unique culture. A fading yet rich culture of which we are a part of. All this as we viewed the different pieces of antique Peranakan furniture; each one so beautifully and intricately carved.

The collection here truly reflects a personal labour of love. The love Alvin Yapp has for his Peranakan culture, as seen in his passionate and meticulous display of items. Items which range from the large intricate wardrobes and daybeds; to the wedding altars; and to the small delicate jewellery pieces, the colourful nyonya kebaya needlework and the beautiful glass-cut beadwork of the nyonya ""kasut manik"".

Our heart felt thanks to Alvin and his parents, for the sharing of their Peranakan family ties and the beautiful INTAN with us."

,,A Wow Learning Journey,4.0,,An amazing and fruitful learning journey. Love the collections showcase in The Intan. Thank you Alvin for hosting us.
,,One of the most unique attractions in Singapore,5.0,,"The Intan is the private home of a wonderful young man . Alvin Yapp is a delightful person to meet and impresses with his explanation of what it means to be Peranakan.

It is not a museum in the sense that items on display are labelled and catalogued . It is Alvin's personal collection of Peranakan objects , furniture etc .

He served us tea and Peranakan Cakes and then entertained us by playing the piano beautifully."

,,An interesting though eclectic collection,4.0,,"This is the private collection of Alvin Yapp. It's not a museum in the true sense. The 'exhibits' are not arranged in any particular order. The only way to see this is to get Alvin to give a guided tour. Once a year, he holds a soiree to raise money for his favourite charity (it was the Singapore Children's Society again this year). This is good fun, with Baba songs (Alvin performs himself too) and Nonya food (cooked by his mother). Well worth going to. Ask for an invitation."

,,Our Peranakan culture is much ALIVE,5.0,,"Watched the WA Weekender Singapore program screened by our local TV station in Perth, Western Australia recently. One of the segments featured The Intan and it host Alvin. I made it a point to pay The Intan a visit when I was in Singapore recently. Was amazed by the collection of Peranakan artifacts as well as Alvin's passion to preserve his heritage. He even explained to me the subtle difference between the Hokien and Teochew Peranakan which I was unaware of even though I am one Peranakan.
Thank you Alvin for all your efforts in keeping our Peranakan culture ALIVE. I will do my part by sharing my culture with my friends back home and if they want to know more, will suggest them to visit The Intan when next in Singapore."
,,A Day Out at The Intan!,4.0,,Great to learn about Singapore's Peranakan heritage considering that Singapore is such a vibrant and multi-racial society. Would recommend for people who are interested in history and culture!

,,Learn about the Peranakans from a real Peranakan,4.0,,"The Intan was a different level of cultural learning. It was enlightening, inclusive and engaging. You learn about the Peranakans - their history, their cultural, the intricacies of their pottery, beading and furniture - from a true blue Peranakan. You can sense the pride in Alvin and it makes the experience all the more enjoyable and enriching. Everyone who wants to know about Singapore and her people cannot and should not miss this experience. The Peranakans had made large contributions to our nation building, their legacy is entwined with ours as Singaporeans."
,,The Intan,5.0,,"It's a great experience to be there at The Intan, i am so amazed by all of the antique collections of Peranakan Heritage, you will totally feel that you are on way back to the time when you step inside the house, and don't ever forget to bring your camera for photo ops because you'll miss a great indoor scenery, you will also learn from the visit, just like me, there's no such Peranakan idea in my mind since then...."
,,Interactive Museum Experience!,5.0,,"An interactive museum experience with a passionate owner who personally curates each item on display, immersing you in the stories of the rich Peranakan culture.

We were welcomed into Intan museum, and unlike most museums, we could get up close to Alvin's personal collection of Peranakan artefacts, from the fabric prints to jewellery, pottery to furnitures, his knowledge about the history behind each item and passion is infectious!

There was also local ""kuehs"", types of local dessert, served with tea to end the tour, for a complete cultural immersion.

,,Tea and tour,5.0,,"What a wonderful experience for my old parents, 90 and 83 yrs old as they relive the old days seeing all the colorful spittoons, tiffin carriers and beaded shoes and sandals at the Intan. They were so happy as you can see from the pictures. Alvin the host is most passionate about his collection and hosts a charity show every year to promote Peranakan culture and to raise funds for the children society. The food cooked by all the Peranakan aunties is most exciting for me."
,,Pushing the boundaries of a museum,5.0,,Personalised and closer to life than any other museum. Gives perspective to the Peranakan culture he is so devoted to.
,,Excellent Museum,5.0,,"The Intan is very different from typical museums, as visitors are able to see the artefacts up close and have greater interaction with them. In particular, the mother-of-pearl chairs and the altar with elaborately decorated porcelain pieces appear a lot more impressive when one can see them at such a close distance. The food provided is delicious and is a nice end to the tour of the museum. The owner, Mr Alvin Yapp, is both friendly and knowledgeable about the subject. I have learnt a lot about the culture and history of the Peranakans from visiting the Intan and strongly recommend others to visit as well."
,,Rich in Heritage,5.0,,"Had a wonderful time at The Intan today. Our host, Alvin, had so much to share about the Peranakan culture. What made it even more special were the personal stories behind this rich heritage!

,,Perfect for a cultural Birthday Party,5.0,,"I have organized a surprise birthday party for my wife for around 20 friends @ the Intan.
Of course, how could she have known where it will take place??!
I was looking for an authentic cultural and culinar experience of Singapore.

It has been an amazing party as none of my friends knew the place before. They were all astonished by this amazing place of culture and passion.
The package was: delicious tea + 45 minutes of visit of the peranakan house + delicious peranakan dishes for a ""all you can eat"" dinner.

Alvin is a very enthousiastic host and pays deep attention to people coming in his paradise, able to remember 20 french names in 10 minutes. He perfectly knows how to catch attention of audience and to share his love and passion for his own roots.

And last but not least, he played ""HB song"" over the piano for my wife, which gives a warm and very friendly atmosphere within the house, full of joy and peace.

Although a bit expensive, I highly recommand the Intan as a wonderful opportunity:
- to know more about the country we live and its history
- to promote and support a cultural pillar and very atypical museum.
- to meet a very generous man and family

Thank you Alvin and family!"
,,A living Museum,5.0,,"The Intan Museum located in the home of Alvin Yapp was truly a highlight of my stay in Singapore. Dedicated to the preservation of the Peranakan People and culture, Alvin welcomes visitors with such warm hospitality and pride while giving respect to times long gone and sadly forgotten. What started out as a personal journey to discover his roots, Alvin has developed a museum so full of life and love one takes away a sense of connection to this wonderful heritage and way of life. We were fortunate to have Alvin's mother prepare a magnificent meal of the highest quality. One could taste the love. After lunch we were treated to an intimate glimpse into a world long forgotten where Alvin guided us on a private tour. The hand embroidered shoes alone are worth the trip. But there are so many unforgettable items that we examed that captivated and held our attention. Don't miss out...."
,,An insightful visit to The Intan,4.0,,It's a marvelous afternoon spent in The Intan with Alvin Yapp at 69 Joo Chiat Terrace as the owner cum guide to his enormous collection of his beloved Peranakan collection. His witty and humorous sharings of his huge collections has certainly made his museum come alive. And what made it interesting was that I could have easy access to his beaded collection and I could examine it closely without the restrictions of a glass panel. This visit has certainly brought me closer to know more about the Peranakan culture and its people. I will certainly recommend this place to anyone who is keen to know more about Peranakan culture. Keep it up!
,,"It's not just a musuem, it's an experience",5.0,,"I have mentioned this gem on Tripadvisor for years and am glad that it has finally been listed. it is still a private museum and you have to make an appointment to visit it.
It's not just a museum, it's an experience. One can sense the host/owner/curator's passion for the Peranakan Culture. He doesn't just explain what the culture is about but share his personal anecdotes which makes it come alive.
There are two levels and it is a treat for your senses. Right down to the food, the decor - there is so much to look and see. A must-do."
,,A Peranakan Wonderland,4.0,,"The place may be small, the setting informal, but Intan exudes warmth of culture, and every artifact in there tells a story. The owner, narrator, collector Alvin shared his awesome knowledge of the Peranakan sub - culture. We were fascinated and left with a much better sense of history of this special social group known as nyonyas and babas. Oh, not to forget the very sumptuous Peranakan sweets. A most enriching and wonderful experience."
,,Museum in a house,4.0,,"Don't be fooled by it's exterior, inside hides a treasure trove of antiques carefully curated by the home owner who doubles as the tour guide.

Be amazed by an extensive journey through Peranakan history, be it through the exhibits, stories or food. This is one must have, authentic and local experience not to be missed out if you're in Singapore."
,,Lovely Place,5.0,,The whole place is full of good vibes and historical items. Lovely People and an interesting journey through the history of Singapore. Pay attention to the 2 small board game playing porcelain figures sitting in the bush on the left in front of the house.
,,Amazing little gem!,5.0,,"I didn't expect to find this little gem in Singapore, it sure doesn't look like a museum at all from the outside! Located in the center of the Peranakan preccint, Joo Chiat, this is a museum where we are treated to a feast of our 5 senses. In this 2-storey private home museum, we are allowed to sit and touch antiques, and enjoy authentic nyonya refreshments in the museum. Alvin, the owner, is a friendly and most hospitable host. I learnt alot about Peranakan culture during my visit. Thank you for sharing your passion!"
,,Awesome Intan!,4.0,,"The Intan is not just a place of Peranakan Culture; it is a place where kindness and love abound, in the form of its curator, Alvin Mark Yapp. He truly makes time, to share with you the intricacies of Peranakan history and its origins. Even if you're not into it, you will be very taken in by his enthusiasm for the subject matter-and you will want to know more. Take a trip to the Intan and see for yourself. It's worth it! Thank you Alvin Yapp for allowing me to be part of the Intan experience!"
,,The Intan Peranakan Museum,5.0,,"Amazing experience in a ""living"" museum filled with beautiful Peranakan treasures. This museum has a lot of heart and warmth ! Beautiful !"
,,"Night of music, food and friendly company",5.0,,"We attended The Project Intan, a charity event hosted by the Intan owner, mr Alvin Yapp. it was a night where everyone present just come to enjoy nice authentic Peranakan food and music play and sing by children. The kueh sate really nice, one of the best I have ever tasted."
,,Peranakan Treasures,5.0,,"What does it means to be Peranakan? Not an easy answer, but the Intan House-Museum features intricate objects that will take you back to the Peranakan life style. The elaborate wood carvings, silk embroidery, glass beaded slippers, silver decorative daily use objects are set in the interior that recreates the Peranakan home. Informative and well researched commentary and tour by the house-museum owner is a delight. Highly recommended to visit."
,,The jewel of Singapore,4.0,,"The best jewels are hard to find because they are rare, precious and not commercialised.

The Intan is one such find.

Hidden away from the mainstream crowd of replicable experiences globally, you will be rewarded if you find this little (but big on experience) live-in museum in a quaint neighbourhood of Joo Chiat.

The Intan is a living, breathing museum of the eclectic and colourful Peranakan culture started by owner, curator Alvin Yapp. Step into his into his private enclave and be immediately transported back in time where you learn about the rich culture of the Peranakan - descendants of Chinese immigrants who came to the Malay archipelago between the 15th and 17th centuries.

Be enchanted by stories, artefacts, sights, music and be treated to the taste of the culture with traditional delicacies.
You and your family will be delighted by the warmth reception of the modern Singaporean Peranakans who will sweep you away with their chatter and performances.

Best of all, after visiting The Intan, you can stroll along the neighbourhood and marvel at the pre-war shophouses that once defined the beauty of Singapore. And along the way, you will find some of the best dining that's rated highly by the locals.

May you discover new treasure inside The Intan."
,,The Intan,3.0,,"It is a bit off the beaten track, but if your appetite for Straits Chinese cultural items has been whetted by a visit to the Peranakan Museum in Armenian St, you may find a visit of interest. The owner is friendly and knowledgeable. The location was out of the way in a housing estate and was an ordinary terrace house. One has to make an appointment to view and it takes only 10 mins to see upstairs and downstairs."
,,Nostalgic Visit,5.0,,"Beautiful, Nostalgic, Brings u back to a place of Old. Allow u to appreciate another culture. Must go"
,,A real treasure!,5.0,,"Great museum for anybody interested in learning more about the Peranakan culture. Alvin, the guide and owner of the museum, gave a wonderful tour of his collection; it was both insightful and highly engaging. The Intan is a one-of-a-kind living museum that is sure to provide a fun and immersive experience for all!!"
,,A pretty Peranakan home,4.0,,"The Intan attracted our attention among the conserved shophouses along Joo Chiat Terrace. The Intan has quite a number of Peranakan artifacts, and what's more, the hospitable owner - Alvin Yapp hosts yearly concert at The Intan which entertains you with Peranakan Children songs!"
,,cherished experience of the Peranakan culture,4.0,,"The Intan has a lovely ambience of home-cum-museum, as well as the Peranakan history and stories within. Great warm hospitality by the owner Alvin Yapp and his parents, the collection of Peranakan mirabilia was enormously inspiring. What a wonderful way to appreciate Peranakan history and cuisine. It offers a unique and cherished experience of the Peranakan culture. Highly recommended! Definitely a must visit place!"
,,A total Peranakan experience!,5.0,,"The host, Alvin, is very hospitable even though we barged into his house - literally his own house. The tour is even more so interesting with his humor and knowledge on the culture, being a Peranakan himself. Learnt a whole lot of insights into the different Peranakan cultures, his awesome collection of tiffins and bead works while enjoying delicious kueh-kuehs along the way. Definitely not to be missed!"
,,General review,3.0,,Need more big space and correct others because it is not enough items to look it and to understand it
,,Authentic and Insightful,5.0,,"The host, Alvin, gave us a very insightful introduction into the Peranakan culture. We were amazed by his wide collection of Peranakan artifacts. The fact that this is a home museum made the experience very authentic and we were very easily influenced by his passion for preserving the Peranakan culture and traditions."
,,Peranakan House of Delights,5.0,,"Visited The Intan last weekend for a tea party at the invitation of some friends and was totally blown away by the décor, delicious Nonya cakes, and the warm hospitality of owner Alvin Yapp and his parents, Matthew & Alice. The collection of Peranakan furniture, ornaments, jewellery, shoes, tiffin carriers and spittoons was immensely impressive. The talented Alvin Yapp also played the piano (totally impromptu) for our friends' ''sing-along and dance-along"" sessions. What a wonderful way to spend an afternoon with good friends!"
,,"Peranakan Antiques, Food n Music",5.0,,"A totally delightful afternoon spent at The Intan, with curator Alvin Yapp. Gracious and welcoming, Alvin has spent the last 30 years adding to his collection. Tea was a feast of Peranakan delicacies and after a tour of his house, he obliged us on the piano with some truly memorable tunes!"
,,Must visit in Singapore!,5.0,,"Absolutely love the ambience of this home-cum-musuem, as well as the Peranakan history and stories within. What intrigues me is the number of tiffin carriers and beaded sandals within his collection! Definitely a must visit place and do make advance arrangements! Great for small parties or host a dinner! :)"
,,Peranakan Insights - Great Visit!,5.0,,"All things Peranakan at this lovingly preserved Peranakan home, with all the trappings of its uniquely blended culture. Visit the hospitable host in his home and come prepared with questions about this unique SE Asian culture. Then visit the Peranakan Museum."
,,Must go,4.0,,This is not a typical museum tour as the owner Alvin personally shares from his own experience with deep knowledge on the Peranakan culture.
,,Great Cultural Study,5.0,,It was a great cultural study experience. Everything was very Peranakan including nice sweets and tea:) The museum house is very pretty and Alvin and staff are very friendly.
,,Refreshing Peranakan Experience,5.0,,The Intan offers a unique and intimate experience of the Peranakan culture. It was refreshing and wonderful to see a different culture as shared by the entertaining and passionate Alvin. More power to you! Highly recommended!
,,A must see!,5.0,,"If one would like to experience the authentic Peranakan culture, this is the place to go. The collection is varied and interesting."
,,Great Museum on Peranakan Culture,5.0,,"We had a great time at the Intan. Alvin is personable, a wonderful host and spent time explaining Peranakan culture to us after which we had a personal guided tour of the beautiful antiques that he has collected in the past 30 years. The Intan is a Singaporean gem that more people should know about."
,,The Intan - More than a private tour,5.0,,"A couple of friends and I checked out The Intan, a private peranakan museum because the concept sounded refreshing. How different could it be from The Peranakan Museum @ Armenian Street? As we found out, plenty. I describe it as an afternoon of private conversation with a new friend about his history/culture while sipping Chinese tea and eating kueh kueh (South East Asian cakes and pastries) in the living room of his old-styled peranakan home! It was quite cool.

Well, as we understand, Alvin Yapp, the owner, actually lives there. The exterior of The Intan is much like the architecture of an old peranakan house. Inside the house is what I had imagined the typical layout of a South East Asian peranakan home to be: long corridor leading to the kitchen at the back, and a backyard beyond that. But experiencing it feels nostalgic for this Singaporean who knows only the concrete jungle of the island state.

There's also a loft where Alvin displays even more of his exhibits. So what about the exhibits? There are plenty of everything I imagine in an ordinary peranakan home: ancestral alters, furniture, tiles, accessories, fabrics, paintings, crockery, beaded slippers, costumes, and even rows of spittoons that lined the sides of the stairs!

Two things stand out for me at The Intan: First, it's how the sense of history that we associate with a museum is seamlessly infused into a real home setting. Alongside these artefacts is a semblance of modernity: like there's a proper modern fridge with numerous fridge magnets, Alvin's herb garden in the backyard, his well-worn slippers peppering the the doorway, an Macbook somewhere.

Secondly, it's Alvin. He's a collector of peranakan everyday items with 30 years of experience, so sitting down with him is much better than listening to an audio guide in the museum. After all, it's a conversation, not a monologue."
,,uniquely singapore,5.0,,"The Intan and Alvin Yapp are the best proof that the Peranakan culture is still alive and kicking. The Peranakan is a community and a culture that you will only find in Singapore (and Malakka and Penang). Formerly known as the Straits Chinese, they have defined culture, lifestyle, identity and the food in Singapore and the straits settlements. Alvin is true blue Peranakan and one of the younger Singaporean generation on the quest for a Singaporean identity beyond shopping is re-discovering their roots as Peranakans. Alvin and his awsome collection of all things Peranakan are the perfect way to dive into the Peranakan world and learn the essentials of a community that laid the foundation for Singapores reputation as an open minded, multicultural city."
,,Museum of Passion,5.0,,"At the initimate Intan Museum one will find an amazing collection of Peranakan furntiure and decorative items, curated with the personal touch of Mr. Alvin Yapp. It not only shows the beauty of this special heritage of Singapore, but this gem of a home is filled with many items of interest, some personal, some valuable items that illustrate life of a bygone era. It should not be missed!"
,,A place to be enlightened,5.0,,"This is a place to learn many things, including that assimilation and intercultural exchange is a good thing that brings many wonderful things."
,,A must visit place for peranakan culture enthusiasts,5.0,,"A friend introduced me to The Intan and the owner, Alvin Yapp. I really enjoy the cozy and relaxing atmosphere. It is a charming place, showcasing precious peranakan collection. Mr Yapp is also delighted to share the details about peranakan culture. I can feel his passion and love, and I realize those are the soul that nourish this wonderful place. I will definitely recommend Peranakan culture enthusiasts to visit The Intan in Singapore."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"The visit to the Intan Museum was fascinating. In fact it is so much more than a museum, and the guidance of the owner Alvin Yapp, who lives and breathes the Intan, made this visit a truly memorable one. Definitely worth visiting"
,,dinner at The Intan,5.0,,"it was such an enjoyable evening, with surprise songs and lovely interaction. stepping into Alvin's magical home takes you back to a time when people still chatted to each other and visited each other and started new friendships - and what better way to do it in the company of these amazing collectibles and an experienced host."
,,An excellent host!,5.0,,"If you have not been here, you have to come here. This is not the usual museum you go too. Think of this as stepping into someone's home and showing you his pride and joy, his heritage and his roots. Alvin has been a great host to me and my company's guest who thoroughly enjoyed themselves immersed in the rich peranakan culture. The food is good too! Thank you Alvin and I will definitely host more people there very soon!"
,,A must visit while in Singapore,5.0,,"I went here for a friends tenth anniversary and the whole way there the taxi driver argued with me that it wasn't the Peranakan museum, and it isn't THE museum, it is one man's passion converted into an official heritage site. There is much more to Singapore than caning, chewing gum, gleaming skyscrapers and racial quotas; there is the history of some of the people who first came here and established the communities that grew up into this modern country. The Peranakan culture is an interesting story of blended cultures and unique assimilation and Alvin Yapp does an incredible job of weaving that history with personal stories, accumulated artifacts and his own wit and humor. I haven't been to any other Peranakan museum, so I can't compare, but this is a small collection that stands out due to the passion of it's owner and the help of his family and friends to keep it running.
It is not open to the general public, you have to arrange a tour in advance, but you can arrange that tour around tea time to enjoy local snacks as well. You can also plan a dinner as my friends did and have an evening of history and storytelling.
If you have friends visiting and only have time to do one thing, take them to the Marina Bay area and take the standard touristy photos, time for more, arrange to bring them here to learn about Singapore history.

FYI this is NOT suitable for children, many artifacts precariously balanced on stairs and ledges just waiting to be knocked over. Even I felt a bit nervous to touch."
,,Really cool way to experience true culture in Spore,5.0,,"Singapore is quite a melting pot of cultures. I was invited to a corporate dinner at the Intan, which is a heritage museum in a house. I had never heard of the Peranakan culture (Malay/Chinese); Alvin, who owns the Intan, has preserved the culture through his collection of Peranakan antiques, history, and food. A great combination for an authentic experience. I was impressed by everything there and highly recommend it if you want to do a small unique group event."
,,A must visit!,5.0,,Attended a business dinner at The Intan. It is such a lovely cozy place with so much history of every piece of collection. Alvin was such a great host and our business partners enjoyed the dinner with the tour. A must visit to this place definitely!
,,Trip to Jln Intan,5.0,,It was a great experience and getting a little knowledge of the Peranakan culture which seldom comes across. There are shared information for items seen there with the great hospitality from the host. Good food too!!! Thumbs up!
,,Polished diamond,5.0,,"The Intan is the most unique museum experience I have ever encountered. A glimpse at Peranakan culture is offered through the prism of curator Alvin's Yapp labour of love at Joo Chiat Terrace. An ideal oasis of culture to visit after a few days on the business and conference circuit. I came out spiritually refreshed and understanding of a unique and important synthesis of Chinese and Malay cultures.
The objects on display have been meticulously collected over the years by Alvin himself who lives at the museum with his family. A range of experiences are possible, ranging from traditional Peranakan food, art and theatre, to historical insights. Go, seek out this place and tell your friends. You will emerge enriched and inspired."
