,,Arab Street for all,5.0,,One of the best places to buy gifts for your loved one’s at home at the best prices. Sultan Masjid also close by. People are friendly and you can literally find anything there.
,,Mixed culture,4.0,,"Arab street is a mixture between Malay Indian Indonesia and Arabic culture, good mixture of cuisine all around and of course the mosque itself, be aware of the opening hours for non muslims especially on a Friday."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We loved being there, everything was nice! Alibaba, Aladdin. Everything you need to know about the east and the food was so tasty. Highly recommended"
,,Good place to visit,4.0,,Found this place on Google. It’s About 5 minutes walking from Bugis Station. I surprised about the beautiful colors and I think this is the most quiet place in the crowded Singapore. It’s likely a old town with nice small houses and vintage shops. Took 1 restaurant to enjoy Turkish food which I could look the the Mosque. Feeling so peaceful there
,,I love it here ..... such character,5.0,,"This is a really attractive and fun place to shop and eat. It's full of life and superb restaurants where people eat inside or out. We ate at a Lebanese restaurant....

It was awesome.

Saturday early evening 6pm ish you will see street singers and a live band .... we loved it"
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Places are well done up and conserved. Lots of silk and fabric stores, some tourists traps with Turkish wares, carpets and fragrance Great place to spend time and see an unique cultural part of the multicultural Singapore"
,,Nice part of Singapore,5.0,,"It’s a very nice area in Singapore to visit. We went on Saturday and there were bazar and fashion show there, it was great time and we had a nice dinner there."
,,Colorful area of town!,4.0,,Very colorful and vibrant part of town. The Mosque is gorgeous especially at night. So many restaurants you will never be at a loss.
,,Full of Culture,5.0,,"Bustling historic street and area full of culture, middle eastern food and artisan cafes. Gorgeous shops selling beautiful textiles, pretty Turkish lights, perfume and more. Expect plenty of patterns, colours, and delicious eats. Just love this area, it’s vibrant, interesting and happening."
,,Amazing Arab Street,4.0,,"Arab Street is a small street which makes up a larger part of this neighborhood within the Kampong. You will find all sorts of souvenirs and imported Middle Eastern goods along with gentlemen touting for suit sales.
One of the big attractions here is the Sultan Mosque built in 1932. This stunning architecture with it's gold dome is the centre to the district.
Along Haji Lane you will find colorful street art, restaurants and many fabric stores.
Interesting place - Just go"
,,Excellent and has its own character!,5.0,,"The heritage area is an excellent visit, from the museum to the local eating house. The local there are warmth and willing to help you with a bit of history and photo taking. The energy is different from the other heritage area such as Chinatown and Little India. It was calm and at easy. Not busy and fast paced. They have some tourist store for souvenirs as well. Try the ZamZam , unique experience! Nurul from Drop INN hostel Singapore recommended us to Zam Sam and drink the pulled tea! Excellent experience!"
,,More the area than the street,4.0,,"Arab Street on it's own is not all that interesting. Sure, there are shop house with stores selling Arabic souvenirs and other items imported form the Middle East, as well as restaurants. But for me it was nicer to look along some of the smaller roads off Arab Street such as Muscat Street which I found far more interesting.

Along Muscat Street directly perpendicular to the main entrance of the Sultan Mosque can be found a really nice row of Turkish restaurants selling Turkish and Mediterranean food and many stalls selling all kinds of street food.

On the other side of Arab Street is Haji Lane which is a colourful small street with lots of eating places and stores selling all kinds of original goods. This street has quite a lot of walls covered with lots of artistic graffiti.

Often people talk about visiting Arab Street, but when here one should visit the Sultan Mosque, the Malay Heritage Centre, Haji Lane, Muscat Street and some of the famous Indian Muslim restaurants that can be found in this area. Also, the famous Bugis Street and Bugis Junction Shopping Mall is only a 10 minute walk from Arab Street."
,,A bit disappointing,3.0,,Much smaller than I had expected but worth a look if you have the time. Not enough shopping opportunities for me
,,Foodies Paradise,5.0,,"Arab and surrounding streets offer a variety of restaurants to meet all budgets and tastes.

From high end restaurants to delicious local budget friendly eateries, this place has it all.

My favourite restaurants are the little Indian and islamic eateries, very reasonably priced menus and delicious meals"
,,Lively Area,5.0,,Sultan Mosque is the big attraction in the area which draws many tourists and the locals who come here to pray. There are many Arabic and Turkish restaurants and cafes here and at the end of the road there are many bars. There are shops selling rugs and clothes there are also many souvenir shops. You can spend a couple of hours here but not much for the kids to do.
,,Boutique shops galore,5.0,,"Very nice little boutique shops everywhere you turn down on Arab street. Prices are high, but its expected as it is Singapore. We didn't stop to eat on the street itself, we went around the corner instead and found a nice Indian restaurant. Next time I visit Arab Street I will look to purchase a few items. Would recommend coming here to a friend."
,,Busy street,3.0,,A major street in the Kampong Glam neighborhood. Several attractions are on or near it. Lots of choices for shopping or dining.
,,Arabs and Streets.,4.0,,"We found this area accidentally. After walking for what seemed like miles through the blistering heat, we found this area. To sum it up, it's a few roads of Arab/Turkish restaurants, shops and markets. There's Street art around which is quite awesome. Standard feels of an Arabic area. Haggling at shops and touting outside restaurants. There's a lot of tourists here, so if you're after an authentic Singaporean experience then probably go somewhere."
,,Arab street,4.0,,"Good street for some good arabic, Lebanese, turkish and many middle eastern food. Evening visit is better as they close the road and use the road for dining."
,,Excellent place to hang out for dinner and live music,5.0,,This is truly a happening place in the evening with live music. Do walk by the Haji lane for designer shops. You will find excellent Turkish and Lebanese restaurants.
,,Intresting,4.0,,An interesting place to walk by. The mosque looks beautiful. Please remember to visit late evening to enjoy the place.
,,Great,5.0,,A great change from the modern plastic Singapore. Bars lively. Plenty of eateries. Bargains in the stores though some of dubious quality!
,,Great Crew On Board,4.0,,"We were one of the lucky preview holders for the pre-opening of The Jewel at Changi.
The Tiger Street Lab was selected as a dining spot because a table of diners left and we got the table! For the opening - the chef is from Keng Eng Kee Seafood in Bukit Merah. Salted fish skin were large crispy tasty pieces. His signature moonlight horfun was a hit and we ordered a second plate, His coffee ribs were the best ever. The rating was not a 5 cos it was very crowded, took a little longer for the food to be served, first plate of horfun was not ""heat hot"" but service was excellent and all profits go to the Tiger Street Food Support Fund. And of course, there was a wide selection of Tiger beers but they ran out of seasonal tiger."
,,Interesting area,4.0,,We just did a tour bus drive by but a walk would have been better. Great sights en route. It is amazing how each area/quarter of Singapore is so unique
,,Good to visit,4.0,,I like it as design and the foods here was good too. I took these photos by iPhone xs max. I have not been here at night
,,cool place to walk,4.0,,"Arab Street was the name of a road and neighbourhood in Singapore. There are two explanations behind the name. The first one is that the area was owned by an Arab merchant Syed Ali bin Mohamed Al Junied and that it was the site of an Arab kampong.
We walk in this street to see the shops.it is clean place and chance to eat Middle eastern food..It good point to strart shopping in Singaphore."
,,Interesting place to walk and enjoy the sights and smells of the food.,4.0,,"We were looking for a restaurant that wasn't Turkish food (since my friend and I had already been to Turkey), and finally found a Lebanese place and had ice cream afterwards. A nice afternoon walk, and a good place to buy fabrics if you need to make traditional Muslim women's clothing!"
,,Colourful streets,3.0,,This was a 10 minute walk from where we stayed. The streets are very colourful and filled with shops and food places. The mosque is very beautiful. Worth a look around and clean and safe.
,,I loved it!,5.0,,"Colourful, full a muslim restaurants, nice, very nice place walking to the Mosque. And the surrounding streets super colorful and full of nice places to eat or drink a juice... I really enjoyed this area of Sinpagore"
,,Go for everything Lebanese,4.0,,"Come to this area for everything Lebanese, Mediterranean, Egyptian. so many food outlets to choose from. We ate at alaturka with views of the mosque and had ice creams later at Likecty and Waffles down the road"
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Arab Street is Singapore's Muslim quarter. It is a very lively neighborhood surrounded by shops that sell brightly colored fabrics and textiles, hand-made Persian rugs and aromatic teas. The center of Arab Street is the Masjid Sultan Mosque that has a history that reaches back 200 years. You can also find indie boutiques, street arts, Spices, Turkish lamps, table cloth, cafés, bakery, Lebanese restaurant and so many other shops."
,,Definitely a place to visit!,5.0,,"I liked it much more then Little India or Chinatown, its kind of a hippie area with fun graffiti painted walls, authentic Arabic restaurants (I highly recommend Sultan de Casablanca) and cute bazaars.
Great, relaxed autmosphere, perfect to spend anytime from an hour to several more."
,,Cool,5.0,,"I was able to see the Mosque. I'm not new to mosques because I live near one in Taguig, Philippines and I don't feel shy to enter here. I think when you're traveling you just have to open and adapting to different culture. Traveling teaches you how to act and somewhat feel the vibe."
,,Different culture,4.0,,We liked this area. We stopped and had a great lunch here and had fun broozing around the shops. Lots of different things to see.
,,Art Wall Street,5.0,,most of the shops seller sating alsalam alaykom which means peace up on you . They have a great attitude once i was tried to buy and i get an issue with my card seller offered me to take it free. Most of the area is Arabic Restaurants And street names as Arabic city names. Do not miss to visited.
,,Fancy and hipster,3.0,,Less crowded that Hije Line just next to it. Good if you like a little bit International culture (but you count also woth international prices).
,,Truly Arab,5.0,,The street is in mid centre of Singapore. Though just a small area it is very old and give truly experience of arab + lebenon + turkish feel. Lots of restaurant and music give very nice feel. A masjid is also situated there. A must visit place in Singapore.
,,"Terrific atmosphere, interesting shops, expensive restaurants",3.0,,"I went to Arab Street mainly to sample a non-asian style meal in this part of the world. There are plenty of turkish/lebanese style restaurant-cafes with staff outside actively inviting potential customers to come in an eat at their establishment.We did have dinner at one of them but thought it wasn't good value. Going by the menus on display at every establishment, the servings are not very generous and you'll walk away feeling you paid double what you would for the same thing at restaurants in your own country. Plenty of interesting shops selling rugs and other middle-eastern decorations. Sultan Masjid is magnificent"
,,Visit if time allows,3.0,,"I like the Arab part of Singapore. Take a little time to walk around, see the mosque and enjoy a restaurant. There are many quaint little houses."
,,Shopper’s paradise,5.0,,"Arab street is known for its intricate lacework and fine fabric . Small shops set up along the two sides of a road , display everything Turkish / Arabic . Carpets , laces , table wares and much more . The restaurants offer exquisite platter on Turkish / Mediterranean cuisine to satisfy hungry shoppers’ palate."
,,Don’t waste your time here!,3.0,,"While searching online about Singapore I read a lot about the Arab street and that it’s good and not to be missed .

Now when I reached there at about 10 pm it was dull,dark and nothing tbh. A very small street with just a few not very impressive restaurants but I still went to a restaurant and gave it a try.
The food was good but you can’t go very wrong while ordering a pizza and not Arab food!!

So thought to go early the next day for some Arab food. As I went around at 9pm it was still the same but I tried the Arab food and was very very disappointed. The food was stale and the restaurant was clumsy, mismanaged and super expensive.

Don’t waste your time and money here rather if you are a fan of Indian food especially veg little India is not to be missed!!!"
,,Love to wander these streets,5.0,,Fun place to walk around and see the sights. Lots of interesting restaurants and shops down alleys and small streets. Spend some time investigating if you can. Worth it.
,,Nice area to visit,5.0,,"A lot of restaurants to eat and take coffee. Good to visit with friends especially in the night, some restaurants have live music."
,,"Nice ambiance, good food & great fun",4.0,,"I'd put it as one of the must visit places, when in Singapore; specially weekend evenings till late night."
,,A taste of Arab culture in Singapore,5.0,,"This area of Singapore is next door to the Sultan Mosque and well worth the time to visit. Enjoy a taste of the Arab culture with a number of shops selling a variety of Middle eastern products as well as coffee shops, cafes and hookla smoking. One thing we found to be wary of is that some shopkeepers will not talk to females not attired with head coverings, so don’t be offended it is their culture."
,,For Malaysian wear shopping and Masjid,5.0,,"On route of red city bus one can enjoy Malaysian cuisine, dresses, Islamic attire, gifts and delicious Moosh Ice cream.
There is also a Masjid on the premises for holy visit but suitable dressing is required.
Can be reached by MRT.
Many shops to visit ."
,,Colourful Arab Street,5.0,,This area for Singapore was my favorite. It was unpretentious and had lots of variety in shops and restaurants. At night the narrow alleyways were alive with colourfully light pubs and restaurant patios and shops were open late with lots of stylish fashion and accessories. Nothing luxury but very original shopping. An eclectic yet energetic part of Singapore worth seeing.
,,Eclectic locale,4.0,,From batik fabrics to cleansing crystals to good eats.. Arab street has a bit of everything. Enjoyed our visit to Qi new age store.
,,Coolest street!,4.0,,This was our favorite street and area in Singapore! Very beautiful and totally worth visiting. Interesting little stores and amazing food smell all around.
,,Cool area in the Arab quarter,4.0,,This is a cool street with a lots of unique shoos and restaurants and things to see. We stopped off here on a tour and strolled around here for about 15-20 minutes.
,,Over rated,2.0,,"Lots of shops and a busy place in the evening, but honestly, not much to be seen.
A few places to get a Turkish coffee, the Mosque is impressive and in its own style offer quite a contrast with the rest of the Singapore architecture.
Maybe worth wandering around if you have got an hour to kill, or take some tourists out, but I have been there several times now and still have not found anything outstanding."
,,Lots to see and buy!,4.0,,"I love strolling down Arab street looking at the beautiful fabrics and rugs, Middle Eastern glass lamps and textiles at Dilip Textiles (their scarves and table linens are truly amazing and the customer service unparalleled). Have a dress made to emulate your favorite red-carpet look. Then, mosey on down and try some Lebanese kebabs or Hummus at ""Tabouleh."" Google the history of the beautiful Mosque which stands as a sentinel over Singapore's Arab street.
Continue exploring down the side streets looking at the street-art, then have a bite at one of the Mexican cantinas along Haji lane, shop at one of the many art galleries or boutiques, or get your name on a ""Selfie Coffee."""
,,Malay Heritage in Arab Street,4.0,,"Arab Street is located in the middle of the Haji Lane, Sultan Mosque, and the surrounding conclave of shophouses, art centers and tourist businesses. There are Arab food choices and souvenirs. If you decide to come visit, take a little time exploring the conclave around it as well. The Malay Heritage Centre is nearby with a mini museum in it. The other shophouses nearby have other food options that aren't Arab. There are cafes scattered about and unique souvenirs can be found in Haji Lane next door."
,,Arab street,3.0,,Thought it was ok. Few Arab restaurants to try from. There are quite a few textile shops and souvenir shops.You do get a lot of people inviting you to eat at their restaurant. Overall was an alright experience.
,,Like being in Middle East instead of Singapore,3.0,,"There is not a wide variety of goods that the stores sell. A lot of cheaper souvenirs, low quality silk scarves, and carpet. However, still interesting to roam through for the cafes and window shopping. The mosque is interesting to drop by."
,,Great Ambience and good middle eastern food,4.0,,Went to Arab Street quite a few times for dinner. Great atmosphere and good middle eastern food. A bit overpriced in certain restaurants due to their strategic locations. But such a wonderful festive ambience
,,Nice ambience,4.0,,"If you plan on visiting the Sultan Mosque,please check online for their visiting hours!! They only allow visitors at certain timings.

Food is rather expensive and there are mostly turkish-inspired restaurants and cafes.I recommend going to Zam Zam Restaurant(5 mins from Sultan Mosque) as they sell affordable and good Indian food."
,,Cosy Singapore,3.0,,"Arab street is local, small, quaint and everything you dont think Singapore is! There are nice little restaurants and shops, but other than that not really worth travelling for, but if you are in the area."
,,Don’t go there!,1.0,,"Please do yourself a favor and save your time and money by not going there, take it from an Arab (me) there is nothing related to Arabs in that street or area! Waste of time, not to mention the restaurants there where the food is tasteless and expensive and not at all the way Lebanese or Turkish food is made or taste."
,,Visited on Trishaw Ride,4.0,,Experienced Arab Street on our Trishaw ride. When we were done with the Trishaw we came back and walked thru the street. Definitely someone worth seeing while in Singapore
,,Very nice and unique area,4.0,,The surrounding buildings are quite colorful and have been very well preserved. The Arab street and district have a lot of good restaurants and shops. Great views for very nice pictures. This place is always busy with locals and tourists. Has to be seen at least once.
,,Nice area!,5.0,,"The name doesn't describe the actual atmosphere, as hardly any Arabic touches around except for a couple of restaurants … but was told the history of it involved Arab trade, thus the name.
The Street is opposing the Masjid Sultan, where you can get great views for pictures during day time or at night. Whithin the area you get lots of shops that sell cool souvenirs and other things ...
Along with different restaurants offering different cuisines, all Halal food of course.
We were there during day time and at night for dinner ... was really cool
Not to be missed while in Singapore"
,,Arab quarter,4.0,,"Arab Street is in the shadow of the Sultan Mosque.

the street has lots of restaurants, fabric shops, and cafes. When you walk down this street, you get the feeling you are in the Arab world.

There is a lot to take in. It is a tourist spot worth visiting - but a number of locals were also there. There is a lot of energy and vibrancy here.

Some of the buildings have been preserved well and they are quite colourful.

I think you will like this place."
,,Vibrant & Worth A Visit,5.0,,"This is the perfect place for the Muslim community to visit. It's cultural and there are lots of preserved heritage buildings worth the experience. There are plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants for you to choose from and chill out. It is constantly very busy with both locals and foreigners alike. Just love the vibrancy of the place."
,,Muslim & Malay community places,4.0,,"One of the top tourist spot for heritage site in Singapore, it is amazing to see how the government preserve the old building amidst of the skyscrapers in the city. Parking rate is quite cheap compare to other places in the city (SGD 1.20/ hour). This area packed with variety of shops, restaurants, cafes and a tourist centre."
,,"Interring area, worth a visit",5.0,,"Well, the name says it all. Nice area full of small shops, bars, cafes. Busy. A bit touristy, but still nice."
,,perfect place for Muslim food and culture,4.0,,"This place has a golden mosque, one of the biggest in Singapore. Surrounding the Mosque there are lots of place to eat with different budget. some of them are open until very late. Singapore scene only comes alive after sunset and temperature is cool down."
,,Very cool!,5.0,,It's super amazing to find such architecture in a city of skyscrapers. The mosque is really cool to look at and it feels like you're in Aladdin when you're standing next to it. Go for a walk and take a look!
,,A must. Lovely with a great vibe.,5.0,,"Great vibe and lovely to walk around H Lane, shop and chill. The mosque is beautiful and definitely worth a visit. If you feel like Middle Eastern food there are a number of options. The Arab quarter was not as busy as China Town or Little India when we went but I loved it. Very nice."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"This is certainly a hidden gem with live music and a great atmosphere. Went here with a few colleagues after work and had a great nights craic. Narrow streets with brightly coloured fronts, a must for a couple of hours if you're in town."
,,Looking for arabs,3.0,,"If you expect to find arabs there you will be dissapointed! Probably it was named for arabs situated in the area sometimes ago right after the British colonization of the island or maybe they rather meant Muslims street or area. It's a nice area with nice little restaurants for traditional arab, Turkish and Malay food and very famous for the textile shops while the main attraction is the famous Sultan Mosque."
,,Dining and Shopping,4.0,,Arab Street- a place with so lively. Many tourists around to snap photo with wall painting. Many carpet and clothes shop houses around. Many good eating shops with reasonable price.
,,Souvenirs place,4.0,,in front of Sultan Mosque this was the easy place to get something to bring home for your families. its price are reasonable & affordable.
,,Taste of Arab,5.0,,"Fun place with lots of shopping. They have a lot of Turkish shops so if you like Turkish hand painted tiles, lamps, bowls and plates then this is the place for you. Lot of good food options and you can walk to the Singapore Flyer from there after a good Middle Eastern dinner."
,,"Arab Street - Must Visit, Must Shop!",5.0,,"Buy affordable luxurious fabrics, textiles, carpets, porcelains, buttons and ribbons! Enjoy delightful eateries too!"
,,Worth it,4.0,,Liked it so much in the day decided to back for dinner and was not disappointed. So much worth once you are in Singapore
,,"Small area, but the atmosphere was good to us",4.0,,"CYC+CG ( 18.07.15 ) My family visited this area on our way go Sultan Mosque. The way to mosque was shorter than I think, but the mood was good like as Arab. Many arab restaurant was operating, and we enjoyed this mood."
,,Beware of being over charged,3.0,,Whilst interesting to see and walk down I did gain the impression that if you are a tourist the you were ripe to be fleeced by high prices for items perhaps of questionable quality. I wouldn’t be spending my cash in the street and I would avoid engaging in conversation with the traders. Why go - a quick walk down whilst in the area will do you no harm along as you do not open yourself up to being ripped off
,,Overpriced and underwhelming,1.0,,"Arab street is clearly designed to fleece tourists with restaurants filled with overpriced food and souvenirs. It is a relatively small area with not much to look at if you're not into buying fabric, rugs or lamps. There is much better and less expensive halal and arabic food elsewhere in Singapore. Don't waste your time here."
,,Just another street,3.0,,"Its just another street nothing special, however nice Mediterranean food to enjoy. Should not spend more than 30 minutes roaming in the area."
,,Masjid Sultan was the highlight,3.0,,We were here during afternoon. There are nice shops and restaurants but during our visit it looked bit deserted. Visits to Masjid Sultan and Malay Heritage Centre were the highlight of our visit to the Arab Street.
,,Just a place to walk around and snap photos,3.0,,"Not much of a shopping street. Mainly sightseeing. A nice mosque there but not allowed to enter. Quite hot to walk in the day, maybe the evening/night would be better."
,,Very NIce,5.0,,"Great time, good food, nice evening walk! You can go there in late evening take a walk.. checkout things on the street and yes have good food!"
,,A colourful and interesting little hub.,4.0,,"We visited this area a couple of times during our visit for the food, atmosphere, and some happy hour drinks and entertainment. It's well worth the visit to experience it all. The restaurants on Arab street seem to be family owned/run with several per family. Identical menu's are a giveaway to this and they'll pursue you to attract your business. The food was great, the pressure to sit down was a deterrent though.
That said, it's still worth taking it all in. :-)"
,,"Great area, good food, good shops",4.0,,"Often forgotten in Singapore. Such a treat.... spoilt for choice re food. So many street side cafes selling Turkish, curries, ice creams etc. most reasonably priced. Mosque is beautifully lit up at night. Persian carpets, Turkish lamps, clothing and souvenirs to buy. Good prices. Do visit this area"
,,Arabstreet ? No SouthEast Asian street,1.0,,"I dont know why this area is called arab street. Is it because of one mosque ?
We went there to eat arabic food but didnt find any arabic resturants or stores.
Mostly were indonesian and malaysian resturants besides the chinese amd indian stores you find everywhere on songapore. And indonesian and malaysiab food is something completly different.
If you are looking for arabic food like lebanese or arabic stuff then dont waste any time going to this place.
Actually dont waste any time going there at all like most other tourists because there is really nothing to see here. Invest your precious time in this city seeing other places like."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"This is a must to visit. Lots of alleys with shops dotted along them. Restaurants - Indian, Turkish, lots of Muslim shops. Near the Sultans Mosque."
,,Went there before Hari Raya,3.0,,Had a mini food bazaar beside Sultan's Mosque. There were a variety and selection of food but tended to be abit pricey. Good alternative to food bazaar at Kampung Glam... though not as many variety.
,,Do not miss,4.0,,This section of Singapore is ny far the best for culture and unusual shopping slightly quirky and artistic laneways dot the area and great food at reasonable prices. For me personally it was the highlight of my trip strolling the boutiques and arabic perfumes..well and truly worth a visit
,,Backpacker Visit to Singapore,4.0,,"Don't miss this place when u go to Singapore. Unique. Convenient place to get food especially for muslim. Variety of restaurant such as Indian, Pakistan, Turkey, Labenon etc.. The historical Masjid Sultan is also located here."
,,Shopping & restaurants with an Arab flair,4.0,,Definitely make some time to stroll thru this area. Many small shops and restaurants. Perhaps some good bargains to be found.
,,Interesting,4.0,,"It was very nice, interesting and easy to navigate. The history is more visable and easier to follow. The shops offer a much more local produce with much more interesting and artistic items."
,,Humming,4.0,,This is the trendy place to be on a Friday night. Come early to get parking before the streets are pedestrian. Large variety of cafes and restaurants
,,Beautiful Arab street,5.0,,"The Beautiful Arab street just beside Haji Lane'
Very charming and Beautiful art, culture, an architecture of Masjid SULTAN
One of important destination that can't miss visiting in Singapore.
I like to walk, cycle and take pictures this area was very wonderful very convenient around Bugis MRT"
,,My people,3.0,,"Loved to see a place special for my people. Like being back at home except for a different weather, cleaner environment and different political atmosphere. The place is nice quite, not well represented like chinatown or little india, but gets a pass mark anyway."
,,Beautiful shophouses and good Mediterranean food all around!,4.0,,"I take backpackers around the city when I have time. And this is the first stop of my free walking tour. I like this place because this place has everything. It has souvenirs, good food, good architecture, and cool wall graffitis for photos!"
,,Loved it,5.0,,"A wander down Arab Street is highly recommended. It is so interesting, with lots of little shops to browse through selling all kinds of middle eastern home wares, clothing etc. Can highly recommend Aljunied Brothers (no. 95) for beautiful perfumed oils."
,,Go at dusk,4.0,,Evening prayer around 6:30-7pm was happening when I arrived! Lots of people sitting down having food together inside the mosque and outside in the restaurants. Lovely atmosphere. The mosque is stunning and well looked after.
,,The place for Middle Eastern Food,5.0,,"The Arab Street has some really nice chic bars and restaurants. You'll find the best kebabs and middle eastern cuisine here. The place is usually packed in the evening, so best to go early and find a suitable dining place."
,,Lovely street,4.0,,"Nice place with loads of restaurants around, and also gift shops. Had dinner in one of the Arabian restaurants with the family. Food was really nice but a bit pricey."
,,Beautiful art street,5.0,,"We came cross this street when visiting Sultan Mosque, short street but quite interesting with architecture of Arab, nice painting on walls. They sell different hand made products there, small and nice shop. very impression - highly recommend to visit this street"
,,Haji is better,3.0,,Arab Street is a bit too stereotypical to be authentic. Haji Lane is much more eclectic and unique and has the most amazing little treasures I never would have expected in Singapore.
,,Nice street art,4.0,,"Just a few streets with graffiti but it worth going there, it takes 15 min but you can also grab a coffee there and enjoy the environment"
,,Great area,4.0,,"I really loved this area it was colourful and full of great eateries , and variety of shops, really loved the wall paintings , pleasant place to just wind down relax."
,,Arab adventure,4.0,,This place has changed in some ways from when I was a kid a being a good place for antiques and now it thriving with restaurants and bars whilst also keeping it cultural identity with some of the stores for linen and local needs along with curios. Great to come and visit.
,,Have I been in a wrong place?,2.0,,"Sure what you see in photos looks very nice but in reality it isnot more than 50-60 m of street with few palms. Still I am wondering if we visited wrong place but seems not the case.
Arab street as said is just 50-60 long where all have a photo with the palm surrounded by restaurants almost all halal Muslim oriented ending to a mosque which is closed to tourist. You will definitely cover the area within 5-10 minutes.
However there are some other things around e.g. Malaysia heritage center and few parallel streets with bar and restaurant s which looks cozy.
Shortly said it has nothing special to offer but if you have spare time why not visiting this area as well."
,,Middle east,4.0,,You would be mistaken thinking you perhaps in middle East wondering this street as restaurants are middle Eastern
,,Cool,4.0,,"Arab Street has so much character and is a great place to spend some time. The tight streets are absolutely laden with cool bars, cafes and restaurants. We loved it as we got to eat some good Arab and Turkish food"
,,Turkish food shop,5.0,,"While in Arab st, we feel hungry so had a snack /meal at the Turkish restaurateur on Arab street. We had the three course meal, very nice to eat , reasonable priced as well as well as a very good service from the staff.
All spoke good English as well as understanding what we said as well. we had a group of Four, we very different plates for food, from a very mild curry to myself loving it Hot as hell. they were able to cover this range for us in all three courses.
Seating was outside so it was cooler as the time of the meal was about 1400 hrs.
The view was awesome as well with people walking pass outside doing their shopping and sightseeing as well."
,,A must see attraction,5.0,,"If you are going by Mrt stop at (Bugis) the blue line and continue walking after the Raffles hospital till you reach Sultan Mosque which is a very nice architectural mosque.Beside it is the Arab st.You will find textiles shops, souvenirs shops and alot of Halal restaurants.The lebanese, Turkish, Morocean,Chinese and Japanese and more.The prices are affordable.The service is good."
,,Enjoyed the visit,4.0,,After a quick look at Little India we walked here and enjoyed the visit. Various interesting shops and we had a great middle eastern lunch at the Beirut Grill in nearby Bussorah St. Many other eating options in this area.
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"We took a tour here on our last visit, after many previous visits on our own. Well worth doing. The walk was gentle and the history explained well to us. Many small shops selling touristy items- silk shoe bags, wine bottle holders, serviettes, slippers, hats and much more. A picturesque area with the mosque filling the end of the street. A number of places to eat or snack."
,,Walk and shop,5.0,,We loved walking through this area and checking out all of the shoppes and restaurants. So many of the buildings are beautifully painted and make the area that much more interesting. The material stores are just so fascinating.
,,"Visit to Arab Street, Singapore",4.0,,"Visit to Arab Street on a sunny day was great. There are number of carpet and rug shops and also shops selling embroidered fabric. Small souvenirs with good bargain techniques can be grabbed. Food was great. I ate in a Lebanese restaurant (Derwish), the taste was good. Especially the staff was very friendly. I remember one of the staff name Muhammad Kareem. A young boy may be from Indonesia or Malaysia, well behaved. Streets are clean, must be crowded at night times. Visit to Arab Street cannot be completed without a visit to Sultan Masjid. And if you are a muslim, take some time out to listen Azan. Amazing."
,,Yummy Arabic cuisines and place to chill post sunset for dinner,3.0,,Just for the good food and neighborhood place. Good to go in the nites for the light setup and dinner . apart from that nothing great !!
,,Meh,2.0,,"The arab street and haji lane, they have few murals that are nice and everyone take pictures there. But i dont find the shops particularly interesting. And the have lots of bar, but if you want coffee and cake type of thing, with comfy seating area, they dont have it here. They have small ones, not really a place for hang out. I fell like this area is over-hyped"
,,Offers good food,4.0,,"It's interesting to go there because one part is mostly tshops that contain traditional fabrics, lamps or others and the rest is restaurants that offer really good savory food. It's next to a beautiful Mosque (looks like the exact one from Aladdin).

At night its really beautiful with the lights and the different designs of the restaurants.

It's a nice place to go. I recommend it."
,,A great place to go,4.0,,"There is two parts to Arab st. The actual Arab st which is full of fabric stores a few Arabic shops and all traditional shop houses the there is the small street that is not Arab st but is referred to as Arab st that leads from the Mosque full of touts and Turkish restaurants both areas are great to me, a great area to walk around. Only 5min walk from Bugis mtr"
,,There is nothing interesting about this street,3.0,,"Located in the Arabian Quarter, but the street itself is not very interesting. The adjacent pedestrian streets filled with small restaurants and shops are much more interesting."
,,Excellent neighbourhood,4.0,,"One of the most pleasing things about a visit to Singapore is the retention of some of the traditional neighbourhoods, be it Chinatown, little India or the Arab quarter along with the old buildings.
The Arab quater is well worth a vist to stroll the streets and alleyways for traditional Arabic and middle eastern food stalls, restaurants and small ships selling all kinds of goods. Throw in a couple of mosques and it all adds to something quite different to other parts of Singapore"
,,Lost it's appeal by gentrification,3.0,,"The buildings are fascinating, but walking down the street it seems that the majority in the central part are selling either carpets or fabrics, with no displayed prices to get a feel for a starting point in a negotiation. The buildings towards the end are bars and expensive eating places. It looks nice, but the variety has gone."
,,Shop Shop Eat Eat,5.0,,Well the name itself suggests food from the Arabia .. people from the Arabia and lovely Arabian shopping ... like every shopping street in Singapore this is also a not to be missed place .. tourists do not miss it
,,Shopping n Food,5.0,,As many streets in Singapore this is one more shopping and food street ... Shopping is as usual but you will get some lovely arabian cuisine here ... A must for every tourist .. specifically if you are an arabian food lover ..
,,Great place to shop and eat,5.0,,"Beautiful area of Singapore. many little stores and an abundance number of great restaurants. Good place to pick up some souvenirs, great materials if you are a seamstress."
,,Beautiful walk,4.0,,"The Arab street area has been cleaned up over the past decade and has lost a little bit of its colour in the process. However it is now clean, a lot more green than it was, and the shops brighter and attractive. You can still buy colourful cloth, carpets and brassware, but there are less of these shops than there used to be. Plenty of good food, though. Definitely worth taking a few hours at night to walk through this and the surrounding areas."
,,Arabic food,4.0,,The place is very clean and it is full with arabic restaurant. If you love arab food then this would be the street that you want to visit often.
,,One of the most happening hangout places!,5.0,,"One of the most colorful, happening places in Singapore. It has a different feel altogether. One of the most popular cafe is Blu Jazz which has live jazz music, amazing ambiance and pizzas. The street also has a dedicated lane for arabic authentic turkish and lebanese food facing the magnificent mosque towards the road end. There is also a small local street market that sets up every evening to pick n buy small stuff.
its a must must go place if you are a jazz lover, or a royal lebanese and turkish food lover. for veggies you have falafels too :)"
,,Fabric street,3.0,,"If you are looking for unusual fabrics, this is the street in Singapore. The street is short but with a variety of fabrics to choose. Silks- batiks-traditional Malay clothing- all are represented and at reasonable prices"
,,one of the best evenings we had in Singapore!,5.0,,"Visited Arab Street in the evening with my Spouse & 2 kids.

We had an amazing time walking along the never ending lanes.

The highlight of our visit was the Jazz music performance. we spent nearly an hour there.

There are cozy restaurants, Silk Shops, gift shops, galleries, Saloons,Tattoo Parlours and etc.

Must visit attraction in Singapore!

Highly recommended!"
,,Arab St and the neighbouring Haji Lane,4.0,,"I regularly come here when visiting Singapore. I rarely shop here and I rarely eat or drink here, but I just enjoy the change of pace and the atmosphere of shops selling fabric and clothing, interspersed with modern boutiques. It is, however, always hard to hail a taxi when leaving the area."
,,A real contrast,4.0,,"The fabric and clothes shops around arab street are worth a look purely on their own, it is a vibrant colourful and bustling area.
Don't forget to look up, the buildings around here are really cute.
What did surprise me were the number of bars and tattoo shops in the area."
,,Well spent time,4.0,,Nice place to spend some time and enjoyable. Wall murals dot the back lanes giving the area an arty feel. A stroll through the area is a must for locals and tourists
,,From the tales of aldalin,4.0,,You can walk through the never ending streets which are bright in colors . At every corner of the road you can see nice drawing and handworks drawn on the walls. You can shop for the amazing arab fabric and eat there. There are many options. When the sun sets down the street look more beautiful with light and music on the streets.
,,Unique Experience,4.0,,Recommended to go in the night as there are many happening restaurants in the night. There was live music too. It is a unique place and we had a wonderful time. We love this place.
,,It is a great place for shopping and great food,5.0,,"This street it is a must when you go to Singapore, specially for the shopping and the good food. The prices, believe or not in Singapore, are very good and competitive"
,,"Amazing place, definately a must see!",5.0,,"During previous visits to Singapore I prioritised visiting China Town and Little India. But 'Kampong Gelam' and more specifically Arab Street ended up being our personal favourite. The shopping was hugely appealing and the array of restaurants was a mix of Middle Eastern and Asian cultures overlaid with Islamic and Malay flavours.

This is a short walk from the MRT station of Bugis."
,,Nice place,5.0,,I do like this place. The quite place and so many muslem people. Very clean place. I do like masjid sultan
,,Famed for its thriving textile market.,4.0,,"There is hardly any Arab influence seen in this area, except for some Turkish and Lebanese food restaurants which thrive more at night rather than in daytime. The quality of food is perhaps, to be charitable, at best suspect. But the shopping experience is much better as you walk past the shops selling mostly textiles with a fabulous lamp shop too. Most of the shops are owned by people of Indian origin, but tailoring facilities are available on the top floors of these shops where Singaporean seamstresses, do everything from measurement, cutting and sewing for prices ranging anything above 80 SGD depending upon the work involved."
,,Fabrics fabrics..,4.0,,"If you need a place to experience the middle east, this is the place. You can find fascinating architecture and of course fabrics along the street. LIttle knick knacks and specialty shops."
,,Great for fashion students,4.0,,"People come here expecting it to be Arabian themed, but that is not what Arab street is. It was not created to mimic Arab. The name goes way back to when it was owned by an Arabian merchant (hence the name). It was also the name of a kampung that was around the area.

Arab street is fantastic for fashion students, with tons of fabric shops and shops that sell sewing supplies. Most of them carry luxury fabric and silk, but there are some hidden gems too.

The food, however, is not fantastic. It's overpriced for what it is (maybe the rent is high?). I'd rather hop over to a hawker or kampung glam for better food."
,,Interesting area,4.0,,"Like if Istanbul has been tucked in along one street in Singapore. Very strange but worth the visit, good shops in the area and also some very trendy hipster places."
,,A total different nostalgia shopping ambient from the many modern shopping malls,4.0,,"Like many global cities, we can find dozens of big and small modern shopping malls thousands of skyscrapers in Singapore, throughout main city centres and HDB heartlands. Looking for something a complete different ambient?Arab street is part of the government city architectural, building and street conservation program. Here, you can see old shophouse buildings with old days businesses. As part of the garden city, streets and plants are beautifully maintained. It is super relaxing to walk around, not just shopping in these old shops, but also, enjoying the old street scene. Here, you would probably forgotten that you are in Singapore."
,,Nice place and good food too!,4.0,,"Great Wall art from local st painters. The old settlement area of the Muslims. Many middle eastern shops and restaurants, also Indonesia cuisine mainly at Kandahar st. Great place to visit with family and just walk the area."
,,A must visit while in Singapore,5.0,,"Arab street is a really cool place to visit while in Singapore. It doesn't often rate as highly as some other places but the place is great.
The restaurants alone are worth going for with such awesome food - you just want to eat everywhere.
There are interesting shops to wander through and its really worth visiting and going through the mosque there.
Make sure you go and visit."
,,Stumble upon,4.0,,We went to Nox restaurant Saturday night which was in this location. The place was buzzing with live music and people eating out on the streets. Nice bars and things happening.
,,for time pass its ok.,3.0,,if you are in this area and want walk and get something diffrent surely go ahead you will get nice walk.some street shopping and nice food you can enjoy.
,,A very nice neighbourhood,5.0,,"Located adjacent to the mosque, this lovely neighbourhood offers great dining, interesting shopping, and very nice people to converse with. I would recommend setting a few hours aside to enjoy the area, walking causally around and see where it takes you. Funnily enough, there is a Swedish cafe in the area (""Fika"") that has nothing to do with arab culture. But as a fellow Swede, I found it excellent to be able to have baked goods from home available on the other side of the world."
,,Nice place for a walk,4.0,,Nice area for a walk among the beautiful old houses. Lots of cafes and restaurants and a really friendly and different feel in the middle of the city.
,,no big deal,2.0,,"we stopped by Arab street as part of a ""tour"" with a couple of friends who live in Singapore. Nothing spectacular. if you are pressed for time and this is one of the choices you have, go elsewhere. or better yet, right around the corner is a cat cafe where you can enjoy a nice cup of coffee with a bunch of domesticated cats... if you're into that sort of thing."
,,Tailors & Cloth,4.0,,"Worth a Visit if you want Cloth or a Tailor , some nice restaurants and the Mosque is pretty impressive , Do visit Haiji Lane as it is in the same area & has a more 70's Hippy Vibe to it."
,,arab street highlights,5.0,,"we found arab street a pleasurable experience to walk down.There are a number of fabric shops mixed with food stalls of varying cultures.Haji lane is a little laneway off arab street where there are alot of boutique shops , bars, and restaurants."
,,place that must visit,5.0,,this is a historical place with lots of great food options and bars.. must visit and have some good time.. weekend time is so busy and life music available
,,Colourful & Vibrant Street.,5.0,,"There are many shops here; especially from the Turkish and Lebanese traders. There are also a couple of Chinese shops too. It's very vibrant and filled with people from all walks of life, both locals and foreigners alike. There are lots of beautiful murals along the street and you will be spoiled for choices on the F&B outlets here. It's one of my favourite streets in Singapore. I love it to the core."
,,Sandwiched between Haji lane & Muscat street,5.0,,"Arab street runs parallel to Ophir road & stretches from Rochor canal road on one side & ends at the junction of Beach road in the central part of Singapore. Similar to China town & Little India, it is a conservation area under Kampong Glam. However, the back drop to this place at night can be a glittering nearby modern building from few angles.
If arriving by train Bugis is the nearest station. More than 25 bus routes pass via nearby North Bridge road, Victoria street, Ophir road & beach road. Other nearby roads have names like Baghdad street, Bussorah street, Jalan Sultan etc.
The iconic structure nearby is that of a mosque with golden dome. Minarets of the mosque are illuminated after evening with changing lights. If properly dressed, one is allowed to visit this religious place during visiting hours. Village hotel located above Golden Landmark shopping complex is at a stone’s throw away.
The entire area has unique shop houses that offer fabric, carpet, handicrafts, perfume, carpet & lot of café & restaurants serving halal food. This is charming place with a lot of history attached to it & you will notice a different vibe that is missing in the shopping malls anywhere."
,,A disappointment???,2.0,,It was more of a turkish and labanese street to be specific.. there were some chinese shops too.. Food offered is not authentic and very expensive. Negative marks and not visiting again....
,,Street lights,2.0,,"I unfortunately visited the area at seven thirty in the evening and found most stores closed.
That made it difficult to capture the vibe of the area.

Haji Lane was quite hard to find too... even the locals didn't know how to direct me.
Once there, I was once again left speechless that at eight in the evening, only a handful of cafes / bars were opened and the lane was dark and unappealing.
Better lighting of the area in general would be helpful, since the colorful old buildings as well as street art, are a magnet for tourists worldwide."
,,Good To See,3.0,,"Not as large as Chinatown or Little India, but still good to walk around and understand the diverse culture of Singapore. If you walk from Bushri Street, you can take in the beautifull pristine architecture and colour of the buildings and also pass by the mosque. Lots of alleys with textile shops, cafes and bars. A real buzz."
,,Visit while on break,5.0,,"What a great little find this was, after being told to visit it from one of the staff members at the Pan Pacific Hotel where we were staying. After a short walk of about 1/2 an hour, we arrived and it was one fascinating location to visit which definitely is a must do. The alleys were a mix of different business, really to many to mention, as it was a very muggy day we decided to stop at a little bar for a drink, and believe me it was small but a relaxing time and cool while we had our break. After leaving we went on to find and look at the Mosque and palace. It also a must and a wonderful building inside and out, and yes photos are allowed to be taken. A must do if in Singapore for a couple of days. You can also catch the MRT to get to this location if you can’t walk the distance."
,,Old Architecture,4.0,,Beautiful old architectural buildings in pristine condition. It has great shops and food places that's worth a visit
,,Colourful,5.0,,So many shops line the streets selling materials. Carpets and a lot more. Shop keepers love a good chatter . So friendly. And so reasonable priced. Pays to haggle with price . Well worth a visit
,,One of my favourite places in SG,5.0,,"Arab street is, as for now, one of my favourite places in Singapore. I enjoy walking in this area, and the Sultan mosque is really beautiful. The food is also really good! Will definitely visit this area more often."
,,Like a maquette,4.0,,This place reminded me to Epcot in Orlando. Everything was well appointed and so beautiful. For sure a good place to eat (actually everywhere in Singapore is).
,,Okay to visit once,3.0,,"Arab Street was walking distance from the Intercontinental Hotel and Bugis Connection. We walked down the main streets, mainly textile, fabric and area rugs outlets, one after another. Lots of Turkish restaurants, turkish coffee cafes, and souvenir stores. We had a light lunch at Yam Yam, that was recommended by a local. If you are short on time, I think you can skip this area and go see something more interesting."
,,"Great area for food, sightseeing and shopping",4.0,,"We visited the mosque which was very interesting. We enjoyed a lovely lunch at Luberon, especially recommend the Halloumi Wrap and squeezed in some retail therapy in the great selection of boutique shops. Very attractive area, prettily decorated buildings."
,,Beautiful area to visit,5.0,,"Arab street is a beautiful area with old buildings, great shops and food but the way the shop fronts are painted is something you have to see."
,,What an absolutely wonderful area to visit,5.0,,"Our hop-on hop-off tourist bus map had an area referred to as the Muslim area by the tourist desk, and suggested as a must-do for everyone interedted in culture.
We went for a walk around the area, and had a magnificent lunch there (refer other review) and were only sorry that we didn't have more time.
One of the most friendly, cleanest and safest area we visited in Singapore - highly recommended."
,,"Good Food, Good Shopping - Good Experience",4.0,,Like the lively place that comes to life as the evening sets. One can get a choice of great Arab food with some good shopping choice.
,,Interesting part of town,4.0,,This is an interesting part of Singapore with many restaurants and shops. There is also a large mosque in the area. It is a good area for a stroll.
,,An Interesting place,4.0,,"Arab Street in Singapore houses the Sultan Mosque and this place has a lot of small shops on either side and there are a lot of small restaurants that are ideal for cheap eats that serve Halal Muslim food especially after Juma prayers on Friday afternoon as one can go there sit in one of the Malay restaurants and grab a bite.
Dr. Javed Rasheed"
,,Late night hangout place,5.0,,This place have many restaurants and they have live bands with Italian food and wines. Its a fantastic place where you can spend some time which friends for some wines.
,,Lovely place if you love bargaining and eating!,4.0,,"There are many shops selling textiles, perfume and souveneirs. After shopping/ window shopping or walking around in Singapore's heat, you can treat yourselves with Arabic and Malay food around the vicinity. Some Western cafes/ restaurants have also recently been quite popular if you are not adventureous enough to try local delights. Arab st is also well known for a plethora of blend of cultures. Make sure to visit Sultan Mosque (take note of the prayer times as you will not be allowed in during those times only). You can also stop by Kampong Glam Malay Heritage Centre -- there is a souveneir shop, a mini museum and if you're lucky sometimes, there will be a bazaar at the main atrium... If you come during ramadhan, the place will be extra bustling! Hope this review helps!"
,,beautiful mosque,4.0,,"just strolling around the street and take some picture with mosque view and many arabic food around here, so far so good and still in love with the mosque"
,,Arab delicacies,4.0,,Nice place to spend some time and enjoy labnese Turkish and other Arab and local delicacies. Time well spent.
,,Arab and Islamic Culture in miniature,4.0,,"If you like exploring the ancient traders and merchants you won't be disappointed. It represents various Islamic cultures in a melting pot. Sultan Mosque is a very imposing structure. Muscat St. with murals of Omani culture takes you back to old days when explorers ventured far and wide. Names like Khandar St,Arab St, Haji Center, Bossorah St, Sultan Gate point at different origins. Rugs,souvenirs along with Turkish, Morocco, Arab food is available."
,,Lively!,4.0,,"Its a good spot to go to for some live music and expensive drinks, (like ALL of singapore!) but a good night spot overall :)"
,,The Arab quarter of Singapore; peaceful quaint and adorable,4.0,,"The Arab quarter of Singapore is peaceful , quaint and lively, wall murals dot the back lanes giving the area an arty feel. A stroll through the area is a must for locals and tourists alike"

,,Excellent,4.0,,"Quaint restaurants in this side of the city. We had typical hummus & a big naan like bread, both excellent. There are streets with colourful graffiti where you could take some interesting pics."
,,Arabic people,4.0,,There are a lot of arabic people living and doing business along this street. If you love arab food then this would be the street that you want to visit often. There is a mosque at the beginning of the street.
,,Lovely Place To Eat Wirh Loads of Character,4.0,,"Arab Street has so much character and is a great place to spend some time. The tight streets are absolutely laden with cool bars, cafes and restaurants and there is a good mixture of locals and tourists leading to a nice, relaxed vibe.
Quiet in terms of traffic as the roads are pedestrianised and it is well linked to downtown on the MRT. Sone nice mosques in the area too but for us it was just a nice place to unwind on a very hot, sultry, humid Singapore day."
,,A Beautiful Mosque and some Tasty Turkish & Arab Food,4.0,,"First and foremost- This is not a place for everyone. Only a specific group of travellers will like this place. We loved it as we got to eat some good Arab and Turkish food . Sultan Mosque at the end of the road is just beautiful. Shops are overpriced , but that is everywhere in Singapore . Go here for the love of Turkish food"
,,Very enjoyable,4.0,,"After traversing Little India and Chinatown to find them disappointing I was nervous about what to expect here.

It was very nice, interesting and easy to navigate. The history is more visable and easier to follow. The shops offer a much more local produce with much more interesting and artistic items.

Liked it so much in the day decided to back for dinner and was not disappointed."
,,Not much to do,3.0,,Its good street because it has many halal restaurants and also it has one of the best ice cream shop i have ever had
,,Interesting experience,4.0,,Plenty of interesting shops around and many Turkish restaurant. Very interesting and fun experience for tourist.
,,Boring to say the least,1.0,,All it is a group of shops selling the same over the top fashions which will never be worn at hugely inflated prices its not worth the mrt fare
,,Nice views. Some good restaurants and some really bad ones.,4.0,,Nice views. Some good restaurants and some really bad ones. Visit at night. The restaurant closest to the mosque isn't very good.
,,Great for materials,4.0,,"Good food all around and amazing clothing stores. If you are into making your own clothes this is a must, material and all you could need, we bought materials and shirts etc here.

Good food available for everyone and great atmosphere with lots of back streets and friendly vendors."
,,Great Cafes and interesting shops tp walk through,4.0,,"Arab Street is definitely an interesting place to walk around. Its has numerous shop selling everything from beautiful napkin, table runners and table cloths to beautiful lead light lamps. Its not cheap but the shops have beautiful product and it worth going."
,,Great find,4.0,,"Stumbled upon this street two nights ago. Such a lovely atmosphere! Lots of Lebanese and Turkish food options and beautiful decor. There are little market stalls set up selling snacks, clothes and cosmetics. Also close to Masjid Sultan Mosque :) Definitely worth visiting"
,,"ARAB STREET, SINGAPORE",3.0,,"This is one tourist spot that few tourists visit; as compare to LITTLE INDIA , CHINA TOWN.....This could be due to the fact of less publicised by various media. It consists of few small and narrow rows of streets, lined with old buildings. The area has recently seen big transformations and many cafes, restaurants, shops springs up over most of the streets. The eats here are mainly Malay type, with some Turkish fares; and few of FINE DINING level ! The Key attraction in this area if the MOSQUE, which is being renovated recently and open to public. The shops lined the main street sell mainly MALAY clothing and items. THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES IN Singapore whereby one can buy weaved baskets and other wares. Visit for a taste of Malay, Arab culture!"
,,Quaint Street Close to the Buisness District,5.0,,Arab Street is basically a small street where there has not been any modern skyscraper construction and it retains some old world charm with Turkish and Lebanese restaurants interspersed with small shops selling curios and carpets. Overall a delightful place for a walk in the evening.
,,Definitely worth the visit,5.0,,"I was pleasantly surprised how good the street is - so much better than Little India, and even Chinatown in my opinion.

Great art in the streets - interesting shops and not so crowded.

If you only have a small amount of time it's well worth the visit over any of the other districts."
,,A colourful part of Singapore,4.0,,While I'd heard of Little India and Chinatown before my trip to Singapore I hadn't heard about Arab Street. It's well worth a visit with the beautiful mosque and great little streets full of colourful clothes and other wares. There are a number of Turkish cafes and restaurants selling delicious kebabs and turkish bread but don't expect anything to be open to early. We could only find one cafe that was open before 11am.
,,Interesting place,4.0,,"Arab street area has great walking places and lots of fabric shops. The also have restaurants that serve hookah, shops selling lovely accessories, clothes, tea etc. The evenings are better and less hot to enjoy this neighborhood."
,,Nice walk,3.0,,"It's a nice place to visit but it might be too hot during the day. I would suggest to visit in the evening as walking under the sun is too hot.

There're lots of little shops selling Arab Tea, middle-east cuisine, bars, accessories etc... There're some nice vibrant wall painting as well for photo taking."
,,Best Halal Food in Singapore,5.0,,There are several restaurants on this street specially Turkish origin. I tried kababs and grill in couple of restaurants and the meals were great. The views at nights are cool.
,,Unexpectedly delightful,4.0,,"Arab Street, unlike Chinatown and Little India, is adorably quaint and there is no comparable in the rest of South East Asia, not even Muslim-majority Malaysia, just across the causeway. I walked in purely doing the photo-snapping tourist thing and ended up the proud owner of a Turkish lamp. The shipowner was extremely patient and allowed us to mix and match the colors and patterns of the mosaic glass shades."
,,Expensive,3.0,,Arab street is not worth the effort! The main Turkish restaurant is good but not cheap.Down the alleys the bars are $16 for a pint of lager! Leave this place alone! Unless you want to buy a carpet!
,,Could be better,3.0,,To reach this neighborhood the nearest station is bugis mart station.It's a colorful neighborhood with beautiful mosque with golden dome. Go to walk around.my advise is to go at daytime because locals look strange the tourists.
,,Lively Area great for Walking,5.0,,"If you want a peek into Singapore's Colonial past just take a stroll around the Arab Street area. Tons of little shops, Arab Tea shops, great food, and even some alleyways with great little bars. While many people are in awe of Singapore's ultra modern side, this area is best for people with an artistic side mixed with an appreciation of history and architecture.

At night the area near Haji Lane is extremely lively with many shops, bars, and streets packed with people."
,,must visit place,4.0,,every. single. corner. is. worth. to. visit. it's kinda paradise for you who love to take photo. every side is just amazing. love it!!

,,really cool shop houses with food and shopping,5.0,,"Cute area that is near Haji lane where there's shops, food and coffee. It's more alive at night so best to visit then, but still active during the day. Cute graffiti as well."
,,Feel of Middle East in Singapore,4.0,,"If you are looking for Middle eastern cuisine in Singapore then you should head to Arab Street that is home to some chic restaurants & ethnic cafes serving exotic Turkish / Lebanese/ Persian/ Jewish / Armenian cuisines. Arab Street & Haji streets near the Sultan Mosque also have some curios that sell the best of carpets, silks, perfumes & lamps !! It is a happening place frequented by tourists !!"
,,Mainly Arabian Clothing items,3.0,,"I visited there in an evening. It really feels like you arrived to an Arabian country, but most of the shops had clothing accessories."
,,Beautiful walk,5.0,,"rugs, spices, perfumes, mosque, palm/coconut trees..the street lives up to its name !! its colorful and vibrant with a lot of good cafes to stop by.."

,,Arab atmosphere in Singapore,5.0,,"Take your time to have a walk there , and enjoy Arab atmosphere.I strongly suggest to visit during your stay in Singapore ."
,,"Food, fabric, lights & souvenirs",4.0,,"The ambience is nice and quiet along these streets. Though I haven't tried any of the food yet, but I especially like the unique and attractive setting of the outdoor seating areas of the restaurants. You can get reasonably priced fabric and souvenirs and the Turkish lamps are just out of this world!"
,,Super Clean Streets,4.0,,"Imposing mosque and quaint streets. It was so hot, I took refuge in a small Chinese store near the mosque b/c it had AC. I ended up buying jewelry and having a great conversation with the owner."
,,south-east asian style,3.0,,"This is a street next to the temple, there are many restaurant with outdoor seats, quiet a good atmosphere, also, there are some souvenir shops selling cheap price gifts"
,,"Different culture, different World! Small area.",3.0,,"Just a quick sense of Arab culture. Not really arab, but mix with Maly, tukish,....mulsim theme stores. Mosque around, it was a feast moth in May-toward June. Not thing really impressive, but different and one of kind for tourists."
,,Best place to buy fabric,5.0,,"Friendly selers, you can negotiate prices. If necessary, you will get plenty of great advice. The quality of fabric is the highest, I have not found anything else 100% real silk. And I'm sorry I did not buy even more. Great place if I come back to visit Singapore, I will go again in arab str."
,,The place you can buy special souvenir and have tasty meal.,4.0,,"Have Rug shops and Arabian lights shops and perfume shops and restaurants.

In Arabian perfume shop, you can buy some beautiful glass bottles for perfume, also have many kind of perfume here.
You can choice the odor you like and mix them, and make perfume by yourself.

The place you can buy special souvenir and have tasty meal."
,,Arabian Nights,4.0,,This street is the center of a small enclave of ‘original’ double story shop houses surrounded by high rise buildings central to which is the Sultan Mosque – in the daytime the many shops with Persian carpets and silk garments make for interesting shopping although prices are high for good quality so perhaps window shopping would be a more correct description - this area comes alive in the evenings with lots of friendly people in the streets frequenting the restaurants that can be found on every corner – look closely as you will find some places with music and good vibes.
,,super,5.0,,"Very nice street and area. There are lots of stores and restaurants. You can eat turkish food, Malaysian etc. It is really tasty!"
,,Like walking in an Arabian country!,4.0,,"Very interesting! The whole areas, especially the Arab Street and the National Mosque made us feel like we were walking in an Arabian country.

The air here is very lively and the streets are colourful with lovely mural/painting on the walls. Everyone was busy snapping pictures – definitely Instagram worthy.

Turkish & Lebanese food is nearly authentic & lots of vegetarian options."
,,Shopping Touring and Seeing Markets,4.0,,"I liked the plethora of fabric stores and stalls in this area. There was a man that blended custom teas for whatever ailments a client has.

Explore this area. Buy a sarong or 10."
,,Nice Vibe,4.0,,Nice area to walk around grab some food and drinks. Few boutique shops and shopfront bars and restaurants. Old style Singaporean buildings in the middle of a built up district. Seemed popular with expats and locals.

,,A must-see when visiting Singapore!,5.0,,"From the art-covered walls, to live music spilling into the streets, to your choice of beverages, Arab street is an absolute gem in the city. Walk past the mosque and marvel at its beauty and spend some time talking with the local street vendors there just a block away. We met the most amazing woman who did beautiful Henna tattoos for only 10 Singapore dollars! Finish your evening in the hustle and bustle (further from the mosque) where you will find a lovely craft beer place, unique shopping, and colors galore."
,,Great little shopping center,5.0,,"A very cool place to visit if you're in Singapore. I went right after my visit to Chinatown, so it really felt like I was hopping around to different countries all within a matter of minutes. There's lots of interesting little shops around and LOTS of fabric/dress stores. Also has restaurants around which I did not eat at. In the middle is the mosque which is very beautiful. Kind of touristy but definitely worth a visit!"
,,Must visit when in Spore,4.0,,"This is where the early settlers met and trade. The Arabs, Malay, Chinese and European traded goods and made Arab street their home and trading place.
Interesting to know the Kampong Glam Istana site still exist but now converted into The Malay Heritage Centre. Next to it which used to be the Chief Minister's house is now a Malay restaurant and an event hall popular as a venue for Malay wedding ceremony.
Many shops crop out over the years which has turned Arab Street into a Cosmopilitan place to be and be seen.
You will find many ethnic restaurants and Western ones as well.
Not a place to be missed"
,,Will visit again in the future,4.0,,I haven't covered a lot of places here but I will definitely come again soon. Good place for photography as SG government preserved the area very well. Try some of the restaurants and cafe there and you'll love it.
,,Good experience,4.0,,"We enjoyed wandering through the lanes and shopping. Lots of gift options here, we were sorry we couldn't get larger items home on this trip. Lots of food options. Glad we made the trip here."
,,Not really a must try kind of place..,3.0,,"We went to Arab Street after visiting Singapore Zoo. We'd planned to do lunch at Arab Street. There are many Muslim food joints and Arabic/ Lebanese kebab- food kind of joints. We went to Zam Zam as that was the quickest to spot plus we were starved after walking the Zoo for 4 hours!
After lunch, we visited the Sultan Mosque which is right opp. Zam Zam Rest. We went to Muscat Street which is behind Sultan Mosque and found a cute souvenir shop called 46 Table Top Creation. We picked up many souvenirs from there (3 sets of 5-6 keychains for $10, etc). We realized that there are many more shops further down the street for cheaper souvenirs as well.
Next, we walked through the Malay Heritage Centre which was on the way and clicked a few pictures there, nothing too special.
That ended our trip to Arab Street.
Haji Lane is parallel to Arab Street and is a tiny lane with some wall graffiti art and few bars, cute. There is a Bergs Gourmet Burger; their beef burger is a must try! It does have other branches, so you can check out which one is closest for you.
The best way to get to Arab Street is to take the MRT to Bugis Station and walk which would take about 7-10 mins max."
,,Great for sightseeing great for shopping!,5.0,,This was a great experience! With the mosque as the centre point the surrounding area oozes the Middle eastern culture of Singapore. Shopping is cheap with plenty to choose from including beautiful fabrics on display. Restaurants abound with both traditional and more modern meals. The street performances also add to the vibe. If traditional meals aren't your thing then there's also Haji street next door to cater to your taste buds. Well worth visiting if only to grab some bargain souvenirs and soak in the culture.
,,"Arab street, Singapore",4.0,,Like Haji lane this is also part of the Kampong glam heritage trail. The place is lined with lots of Turkish and Lebanese restaurants and shops selling dresses and gift items. Evenings will be crowded.

,,"History, shopping and great food",5.0,,"Within a block on this street you will find the Sultan Mosque, Malay heritage center, a (small) toy museum, several shops with Malay and Turkish clothing and crafts and multiple dining options. This is a must stop for an authentic Singapore experience."
,,Lovingly restored quarter,5.0,,"Arab Street and the Malay quarter is an interesting and quaint area. A mixture of colonial, Malay and Chinese architecture, the century old townhouses have been lovingly restored and seem to be freshly painted. Some have delicate fretwork and many of the windows have stained glass at the top. They house cute boutiques, coffee shop and restaurants. It is the artsy part of town where few allowed graffiti are to be found."
,,Better than China Town,4.0,,"If you only have time to visit one of the China Town and the Arab street, then go for the Arab street. There are some really nice streets with gift shops and some of the street art is amazing!"
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,Interesting area close to Bugis St. Visit the Sultan's Mosque and enjoy the atmosphere of the many Middle Eastern small shops and restaurants down the many side streets that lead off here.

There was certainly foods for all tastes, along with good shopping, especially for regular Middle Eastern items. I visited a few times as staying nearby and met some very interesting locals and found new things each time."
,,Places for Eating or Shopping. OldStyle(?) Buildings. Near a Masjid.,4.0,,Eating or shopping. Many middle-eastern styled eateries here. This place is also located next to a Masjid. Or maybe a Masjid located next to it. You can also look for souvenirs here.
,,"Disappointing, not really worth visiting unless you are in the area",3.0,,"Like many of the ethnically themed streets, there may be one or two very good restaurants on this street but nothing you could not find elsewhere.

The rest of the street is fabric shops which clearly dont do much business and there is not much for the tourist to see. Mainly for people who want to get a more manufactured taste of a culture or the 'other'."
,,Wish I'd had more time here,5.0,,This street was fascinating but it was too hot to handle so didn't spend much time there. Next time perhaps.
,,A beautiful old pattern town within the ultra modern city.,5.0,,Nice calm and quite place. Near the beach road. All are old pattern low height building. Lots of food options are there. Many shops are there but not vibrant like others.
,,Must Visit Hidden Gem of Singapore,5.0,,"AN entire lane of pop art, kitsch, street shopping and those amazinng colourful murals,, this place is an anti-climax to singapore's fast-paced life projected in myriad of skyscrapers and building. Both side of the road is lined with quaint shops selling pretty souvenirs to some authentic Arab stuff leading to the grand Sultan Mosque!
And the best part..lpi-smacking local delicacies with chilled Hoegarden and Erdinger and live music! This is one must-do one of the evenings in Singapore!"
,,A real surprise and contrast in Singapore,5.0,,"Tucked away, but worth searching out if you fancy a change of atmosphere in Singapore. Great place for Turkish food and some great bargains to be found in the shops if you haggle!"

,,Hidden Gem,5.0,,"When researching Singapore this area of town never came up. We ended up here by a total fluke and it was awesome. There are tons of shops, restaurants, and bars. I recommend eating Lebanese food somewhere here and if possible coming here at night for a drink."
,,Cool area with lots of shops and food options,4.0,,"Walking on Arab Street is a fun experience of exploring little shops and restaurants. Even for those who don't want to buy anything, it's fun to see the area. It's not too big of an area, but entertaining nonetheless."
,,A Taste of Arabian Nights,5.0,,"It was a good way to see a bit of Turkish culture. Most of the shops had similar items. Unique experience though for those who haven't been to the real Middle East.

Tips:

9. Prepare to haggle
10. Love the fancy Turkish lamps and jewelry!"
,,One of the stops of hop-on-hop-off buses,3.0,,"The best way how to explore Singapore is definitely the hop-on-hop-off bus.

,,Always a fascinating place to visit -- come prepared for crowds and to do some digging,4.0,,"Whenever I am in Singapore I try to stop off at Arab St and pick up some souvenirs. It's a great place for materials -- scarves, pashminas and the like. You can gel a feel for some of the local culture and then distinct history of this district and its peoples.
I've taken home many good bargains from here, although come prepared, know what you want and (for the best bargains) shop around and haggle. A lot of the stuff is the same, but I have definitely found that I prefer some stores to others."
,,Nothing Unusual,3.0,,A smaller area of Singapore that caters to a rather large Muslim population. We didn't find it neither interesting or exciting.
,,Colours for the senses,3.0,,"The thing you notice first is all the shops selling bolts of colourful fabrics. Then there are the clothes shops, the rug shops and the glass stores. It is a very colourful place to visit. There are many hip little cafes to stop and eat at along the way. A great place to spend an hour or two meandering along the street and people watching."

,,One of my favourite in Singapore,5.0,,"One of, if not my favourite area in Singapore. Just a stroll away from Bugis Shopping Centre, Arab Street presents a very different scene day and night. Filled with small shops and cafes, each lane has a different character starting with hipster - quirky - and cultural fused character. You can find a lot of arab/turkish as well as malay / indian cuisine since it's also where the malay heritage center and biggest mosque in Singapore stand. Many Cafes do live music / performance in various genre at different cafes every night which makes the street so much more alive! I love this area!"
,,Lovely surprise,4.0,,"Arab street has a beautiful mosque with stunning appeal. A must see.
I loved all the little shops hosting a wide array of Middle Eastern goods ranging from clothes, carpets, fabrics, lamps and chandeliers etc etc.

,,Will go again,5.0,,"It is near the Raffles hospital, 5minutes walking distance from MRT station Bugis. The mosque looks so beautiful in the evening.We tried the middle eastern food,there are many nice restaurants and bars, I think quit similar as Tianzifang in Shanghai."

This is a place I'd recommend even for those looking for affordable Singapore souvenirs. It is not as crowded as Chinatown and the good are of the same price or even cheaper! There are also a lot of good restaurants in the area featuring Turkish and mediterranean cuisine. Heard that these restaurants are converted to pubs at night where one can relax and drink with friends. Definitely, a place to add to our must-go places if only for the Turkish food!"
,,Plenty of places to eat,3.0,,Been here a few times recently in search of places to eat at lunch-time. There is a wide selection of places and at fairly low cost. On weekdays it's not too crowded and getting a table is usually fairly easy.

Then, an Aussie friend who was visiting asked if we could go. I loved it! I felt transported to the Middle East.

Plenty of restaurants to choose from. I will return again."

Shopping for some fabric I found every stall owner so open and inviting. They are very happy to tell you all about their fabric.
The graffiti walls and Turkish restraints come alive after 5pm.

Look carefully and you might spot the Sexy Coffee and other unique shops

Interesting to see what one could find in the area."
,,Easy to find,3.0,,"This is the smallest of the 3 main area (Arab, Indian, Chinese) It's very laid back - apart from the market which is very hectic especially at weekend. There are some great little restaurants but given the choice I would rather head to Satay Street."
,,Just another day out for exploration,4.0,,"It was just after branch nearby and we decided to take a walk around the vicinity. It was a relatively warm day but it was colourful. Things were the normal tourist level prices. So do check out a few shops before sinking your money into something. If you love the cultural stuff, this would be an interesting walkabout. Watch out for pickpockets, though, especially during festive seasons."
,,Nice restaurants,3.0,,"Lots of textile and carpet stores as well as stores selling leather, perfume and jewellery. Also check out the food here. There are lots of nice restaurants selling middle eastern, Turkish as well as Lebanese food."
,,Very Atmospheric,4.0,,"One of the most authentic and atmospheric places in Singapore. It is yet another ethnic neighbor hood that is cleaner and nicer than Little India and more upscale. Lots of cafes, restaurants and traditional shops selling attar etc."
,,"Boutiques, Bars & Cafe´s",5.0,,"Really nice district with Boutiques, Bars and Cafe´s. Great for a daytime stroll. Go for a ""Selfie-Coffe"" (Milkfoam with your picture on it)"
,,Worth a wander around...,3.0,,"The area is a little enclave of traditional house/shops but I was expecting something a bit more ""arab"" given the name history of the place. Among the usual shops selling ""tat Singapore souvenirs there are a number of material & basket ware shops so if you are looking for something in particular this is the place to go. There are a large number of cafes/restaurants/coffee shops selling a mix of local, turkish & lebanese food so you are spoiled for choice. The heart of the community is the Mosque which is an impressive yet not overly gaudy building, it is possible to visit but you need to be mindful of prayer times and be respectfully dressed. (I think headscarves/shawls are available for women at the door).
Worth a wonder around....but it won't take that long"
,,ineresting,4.0,,"interesting, colourful street, definitely worth a stroll down. The Sultans Mosque is nearby and worth a visit."
,,Unlike the rest of Singapore,4.0,,"Very interesting and I'd say definitely worth a visit. The Mosque is not large but admission is free and again definitely worth visiting if you're looking for a cultural activity.
This s a short walk for the MRT - but make sure you have a map with you as its not well signposted"
,,Nice for a walk and eat good food,4.0,,"We usually bring foreign guests here to show them an other side of Singapore. Haji Lane has great boutique shops, the food selection in the neighbourhood is diverse and tasty and at night there's a good buzz."
,,A must visit,5.0,,If you make your own things and need material this is the place to visit. Shop 51 was just as good in life as it is recommended. Go look enjoy the fantastic material
,,Good for a look,4.0,,"If you like cloth and wares - this is the place to be. They tout for your dining business here as well.

I was looking for a truly lebanese food experience - but it comes at a cost. The meal we had was overpriced for what it was. No such thing as your food market and $5 for a dish here.

Expect to pay $20+ for a decent main then add drinks."
,,Average Arab Street,3.0,,"We visited Arab street twice during our stay in Singapore. Once in the evening for a meal (lucky the restaurants are open late) and again during the day to see more of the area.
Really, its average for an arabic part of town. The mosque is not as impressive as mosques elsewhere in the world - the plain colour is not interesting to look at. The food in the area is typical arabic, but at Singapore prices. Compared to Edgeware Road in London, it was disappointing."
,,Arab town,3.0,,"Lot of Arab restaurant , shopping for Arab cloth ,fabric , lot of walking,this place is only for the people who are interested in eating and shopping"
,,Trying in Hajib's,5.0,,"So much culture jammed into a few city blocks! The fabric market is nothing I've ever experienced before!! So many bright colours, different fabrics, lace, bling, and so much more! The Mosque is ope to visitors as well! A must see...."
,,One time,4.0,,It is known for it's Arab or Malay Culture at Bugis . Good place to have some Turkish food and for fabric shopping
,,Fun to see and good shopping,5.0,,"I was a little hesitant to visit the Arab section in today's political climate. However the reviews were all very positive so we decided to go. There are many restaurants and nice shops, with Turkish and middle eastern wares. Beautiful lights and glass, carpets, textiles, ceramics. We picked up some nice things to take home. People were very friendly and welcoming. I would definitely recommend an hour or two in this area."
,,"An eclectic, ethnic and eatery experience",4.0,,"Located north of the Singapore River, Arab Street is part of the Kampong Glam trail and is the heart of the Muslim quarter.

The rich culture, vibrant coloured houses, ethnic cuisines and boutiques, it offers a souk style of shopping experience.

Other interesting sites close by include the outstanding Sultan Mosque, Istana kampong Glam and the Malay heritage centre.

We arrived here via the hop on, hop off bus although it is also easily accessible via the MRT, Bugis street station."
,,Disgusted,1.0,,I don't recommend going all the way to this road. Nothing worth it. I found a huge RAT on the pavement. Its really disgusting.
,,Mystery and Fashion lane,5.0,,When we walk to this area we can see many people they wear traditional clothes to visit Kampong Gelam. That is a kind of Mystery and Fashion for me. Because this is their culture and their life. We use different view to know their culture. Traveler can easy to find a place to take a photo and find a restaurant to stay and drink a cup of tea tarik and enjoy the time at this special place.
,,Perfect place to get away from Mall shopping..,4.0,,"Eclectic, laid back charm of Arab street is proof that there are still interesting places to shop in Singapore. Catering more to youngsters and fashionistas, Arab also shows a glimpse of the shophouse concept that used to dominate Singapore. Worth visiting the cultural heritage centre and the mosque near by. Turns into cool drinking joints in the evening."
,,"""Sexy Coffee""",2.0,,"I enjoyed Arab St with my family, and we passed a small ""bar"" called Sexy Coffee. It was very enticing at first with an Australian IPA bottle outside ... however we tried the beer on tap which was their own brew... the IPA really didn't taste much like an IPA... and they didnt have the Australian IPA beer in stock. Maybe the coffee was better, maybe focus on coffee and not beer..."
,,Unique Enclave of Arabian Splendour in Singapore!,5.0,,"Have been wanting to visit Arab Street every time I visited Singapore but somehow China Town & Little India seemed to take precedence! Not this time though, we told ourselves. Visiting this unique enclave on a sunny working day ensures the crowds are missing & we were able to soak in the unique ambience of this well preserved enclave with Sultan Mosque dominating but certainly not dwarfing the street full of Turkish, Lebanese & other authentic eateries as also small shops selling silk, lamps, clothing & brickabrack! Everything is laid out clean and colourful and the shops also are quite laid back with no one in a hurry, even to sell! Being possibly a heritage location, prices aren't really low and there's no sense of urgency to make a sale!! So browse to your heart's content and if something catches your eye, well & good. We had lunch in a sidewalk eatery called Bushra Cafe, mainly authentic Turkish food. For starters we had interesting bread with several dips of Hummus etc followed by Aubergene with tomato based sauce, Rice & Gemuse Roulade. The cooling drink of choice was Airan for the hot afternoon! A throughly mouthwatering spread, all told. As we headed back to our car parked in a by-lane, we were struck at how this unique enclave sat cheek & jowl with modern Singapore high rises, right next door! This then is Singapore for you where cultural diversity is plentiful in an otherwise ""pocket sized"" City/Country."
,,"Great shops, dining and authentic experience",5.0,,A great place to spend an afternoon taking in the colourful shops along with the beautiful Muslim temple. Plenty of good halal restaurants (alcohol isn't available) to dine in when you've finished looking at the stores.
,,A different experience ..............,5.0,,"It is a street which has 2 different faces
In the morning it is a street where you can do business
Carpet shops
Arab dress shops
Textile shops
So it is always a busy place
But after 7pm it is calm & quiet & the back lance where there lounges restaurants arab cafe sheesha lounge becomes active
On our latest visit we went for some Kabab & Desi food on that street & enjoyed by all means ....."
,,A Great way to Spend an Afternoon,5.0,,"We love strolling around and looking at the shops. The people are friendly and happy to have a chat. Kopi shops and local food is a must try. There are temples (if that is your thing), but we enjoy just strolling. Easy to get too and not far from Little India, Bugis Street if you love to walk this is the way to go."
,,One of the most beautiful places in Singapore!!!!,5.0,,"It doesn't look at all like I imagined. The streets with palms look like Barcelona, then there is the golden mosque and skyscrapers. Fantastic combination, great food, awesome atmosphere, super cute cafes especially in Bali lane. MUST-SEE!!! Loved it so so much!"
,,Definitely on the list to see,4.0,,"My son and I walked through this district, looked through all the different shops, and sampled local fare for lunch. Had hot tea from a local street vendor and despite the hot and humid weather, the tea was actually refreshing. A perfect spot to people watch - mostly tourists though. A glimpse into the cultural diversity of Singapore."
,,Amazing Street with great atmosphere,4.0,,"Is really one of land mark in Singapore and you should came here the street having great mixture with amazing RESTURANT Turkish Syrian lebnanese and Jordanian style also the shops and cafe located in nice way
Close from you is the masjid alsultan more than 100 years old
You will enjoy with this experience"
,,Nothing special,2.0,,"As the title says it's nothing special, a few nichè shops with unusual gifts, the stench in certain areas is physically unbearable."
,,Quick Visit,4.0,,"Having stayed in this area over 10 years ago it was nice to do a quick visit back and see the changes which have occurred. Some lovely shops and restaurants have sprung up and there are lots of visitors, particularly near the Golden Mosque."
,,Great to hang out and see materials and arab culture.. Also grab a kebab,4.0,,"I am a frequent visitor to Arab street, the materials are abundant and there are so many restaurants and bars. Wander on over to haji lane as well for a very welcome ale"
,,Different,4.0,,"this place had a different atmosphere from other shopping spots in singapore. groovier, cozier and maybe the coolest spot. full of unique shops and boutique and of course the famous mural that looks great from any angle. must visit"
,,Morning walk,3.0,,Great place to go for visit in all the little shops. Shops opened up about 10 AM and some great stores with beautiful light fittings in different colors.
,,Nice enough for a quick walk through,4.0,,The arab quarter is very small and just made up of a few streets. It's also close to little India so easy to combine the two walks. It's just that there is not actually that much to do (ie see) just a pleasant walk. There was more of a buzz to Little India but maybe that was due to the markets there.
,,Great spot,4.0,,"Great spot to visit, try amazing food and see a different culture. Great small streets and culture around."
,,Nice atmosphere.,4.0,,"Guess you need to visit this place when the sun is setting. This is a good time to see the gradual change of illumination. Perfect for photography. A very good mix of Arabic, local and pizza joints. Shops are the usual."
,,Cool place to hang out,5.0,,"Arab street is a great place to walk around and experience a great atmosphere. There's always a good buzz and later in the evening they close the roads and music is played.

It's also home to some great restaurants, Lebanese being my favourite.

It's right next to Haji St and a 2 minute walk from Bugis Station so very easy to get to."
,,great even after second visit,4.0,,"this place is good if you are interested in arab style food, the resturants here are very chilled out and last time there was hooka, but this time there was no hookas available, singapore govt banned it i think"
,,Mouth watering!!!,5.0,,"If you want to see some heritage & enjoy mouth watering Arab, Moroccan & turkey food this is the place to be. If you're a foodie who likes to try out different food then its a must go to this place."
,,Good area.,5.0,,A good are with a great atmosphere. A lot of culture and people are very nice. Glad I booked my accommodation in this part of the city.
,,like in small town,4.0,,Itss really amazing beacuse it feels like you are in maketplace in some small town or sea curort. There are plenty of small restaurants and stuff.
,,Flavours of the Middle East,4.0,,Good place to go for a walk and find a restaurant. You don't feel like you are in Singapore. Haji Lane and Bali Rd also good.
,,Great Experience,4.0,,Lovely little place with great shops and amazing food!! A great way to experience the multiculturalism of Singapore!!
,,Bars and Mosques all living together!,5.0,,"My 3rd visit to Singapore and I do not know how I missed this amazing place! Graffiti and bars and great textiles.....a very bohemian place in Singapore, check it out"
,,Sensory Overload!,5.0,,"Had a wonderful afternoon visiting Arab Street and its surrounds. From delicious Turkish apple tea, to bargaining for carpets and soaking in the gorgeous colours and lustre of the silks on display - we had a great afternoon stepping into another culture."
,,Great place for halal food and buying lace materials,5.0,,This street has a wide selection of halal restaurants (even a halal Swedish restaurant) and clothing and home decor shops. We bought a lot of lace materials from the shops there. The Sultan Mosque is a must visit. We went to Zam Zam restaurant which had really friendly staff.
,,A must to visit,5.0,,"This is a lovely little area with many interesting shops in old fashioned shop houses. Great place to browse for fashion and knick packs, good for food and drink. Definitely to be on to do list for Sg."

,,Great for Halal food,3.0,,"very good choice of restaurant specially if you are looking for Halal Food.But most restaurant are middle eastern, so falvourwise a bit different.The are is nice, you get the smell of aromatic cofees all around, genreally good to spend about 50-60 minutes."

,,"Nice,cozy place",4.0,,A predominantly muslim whereabout inside the city.Very close to Bugis Village this street offers you little bit of Arabia with some great food joints including the local drink Bandung
,,More Happening at Late Afternoon and Night,4.0,,"I love the Kampong Glam area. Tere's so much more happening around the late afternoon to evening. As usual, I enjoyed the street art, plus the smell of the food around the restaurants. I wish I had more time to explore the food, but unfortunately, this trip was another one of those short ones. Will have to visit again one time and spend more time exploring them."
,,Nice area with interesting shops and eateries,4.0,,An interesting street to stroll down and cool to have a beer at the Kiwi backpackers and watch the people go by. Lots of touristy shops if you're Into to that.
,,Halal Foods & a Taste of Middleast,3.0,,"This review is quite late. This place attracts lots of visitors from the Middle East looking for restaurants serving ""halal"" foods. Plenty of dining options. Good place to spend a few hours at night for a drink or two. Also, you can do some shopping here."
,,Great place to hang-out,4.0,,Quite a bunch of nice coffee places. Definitely great for a sunday brunch and also to take a coffee after shopping on saturday. At night good place to have drinks and Haji Lane I nice to do a bit of shopping.

,,"HER place, not mine !!",4.0,,"She was very existing about this area as because this is a place for female shopping. We reached here early morning & wanted to be the 1st customer of a shop on that day (বনি কাস্তমার).
Very colorful shops full of woman cloths, dress of various design & fabric types, ornaments.
And the food shops though they are a little bit costly. We wished to try the ‘selfie coffee’ shop, but didn’t able to find it 
Many Malaysian shop keepers helped us to try their products; but they always stay at their fixed price.

May be we have to visit again & again this are for HER interest …"
,,Great part of Singapore,5.0,,We ate staying very close to this area so visited its streets quite often during our visit. It is a great area with lots of interesting little shops and dominated by the beautiful mosque. There are many restaurants of all varieties here and although touristy they are not overpriced and the ones we ate in were great value and the food was excellent.
,,Nice but touristy,3.0,,"very much like a middle eastern souk this area is full of shops and restaurants.....a tad touristy though
The mosque with its golden dome is the main attraction
The adjoining Haji lane is lined with quirky cafes & some shops selling a variety of local designer items"
,,Interesting,3.0,,"A wonderful place if you are looking for fabrics, cushions, scarves etc. Also quite an interesting assortment of restaurants and coffee shops."
,,Food Qualtiy & Outlets are awesome,5.0,,"I always keep enjoying food on Arab street. There are plenty of outlets / restaurants there with variety of food option like Mediterranean , Persian etc. Over all Food Quanity 4/5 Food portion 3/5 Food Presentation 4/5"
,,An iconic area,4.0,,"Early Arabs came to SINGAPORE and settled in this area. This is also the area where the Sultan Mosque is situated. Walk around to see what those merchants sold , anything to do with Arab culture as well as Malay cultural items including clothes , cloths, and tailoring. Many restaurants are available."
,,Great hidden gem,5.0,,"Also known as Kampong Glam, we really enjoyed this little area. This is the original Malay quarter of Singapore and houses a great deal of middle eastern influences. There is a great atmosphere to the area and lots of little quirky shops, cafes and restaurants. Well worth a trip to stroll around and experience."
,,Bussorah Street: certainly a touristy spot; but rarely the touristy spots are so pleasant.,5.0,,"Unfortunately we did a visit a bit rushed in Arab Street (which, as it is known, also designates the entire neighborhood, as well as the road with this specific name). Not quite rushed, however, to prevent us from appreciating the charm of Bussorah Street. With its pedestrian space, the two rows of tall palm trees that line it, plenty of shops and quaint restaurants, Bussorah Street is one of the most pleasant images of which I cherish my memories, in all my trip through Singapore and Malaysia.
I am of course aware that the tourism's needs have now strongly modeled these spaces, so that it's difficult to see how they were when they were organized according to other rules. But this applies to all the tourist sites; and in this case the result seems esthetically very valuable.
I have only one regret: not being able to sit down to dinner at a terrace of one of the restaurants, because ... it just was not yet time for dinner."
,,Good Place to Get a Feel of Arab or Malay Culture,3.0,,This shopping district is known for it's Arab or Malay Culture at Bugis. Rolls of shops and eateries along the rolls of shophouses. Good place to taste some local cuisines or drinks.
,,Fascinating,4.0,,This is a very different area and well worth half a day to stroll around. Friday is not a good day as it is Muslim holy day so some things not open.
,,"Three streets of shopping, cafes and fabrics",4.0,,"An interesting walk through these streets. Shopping for fabrics, eating good Turkish food, great Turkish coffee and viewing shophouses."
,,Another small city street only.,3.0,,"Not up to the expectations based on hype created in attraction reviews. Two lanes basically with small shops, bars and restaurants. A tattoo shop is also there. If you expecting more , you will be disappointed."
,,Arab street in Singapore,4.0,,"I was staying in Hotel boss on jalan sultan road , the arab street is close to it (walking distance ) the place is quiet with some arab restaurants there . Did not explore a lot but seemed a decent place for a walk and venturing out the restaurants and shops there"
,,Just another Street,3.0,,Nothing Spectacular. Just an average 'Market Street' with some cafes and restaurant here and there. A bit racist I felt.
,,Good for a bite out and maybe some shopping,3.0,,"Arab street does not retain much original feel although the food available is different from most other parts of Singapore, so that makes for a good change. It is interesting to look at the mosque and there are some clothing and home deco stores that can be very interesting although not cheap!
Parallel we also have Haji Lane and Bali Lane which are centres of night-life and a little bit of youth culture that is slightly more independent and interesting than the shops in every mall in Singapore.
Worth a visit, even if it's just to escape the shopping malls!"
,,day trip,3.0,,"Nothing spectacular about this place. Nothing very Arabic in this place. The name Arab Street came about because in the past, the Arab merchants lived around the Sultan mosque and the king of Singapore palace. Yes Singapore used to have a king in the past. Restaurants serve good food though."
,,Great Vibe,5.0,,"Arab street is great in the evening, with Jazz playing in several bars and lots of great food and bars."
,,THE area for a dose of culture in Singapore,5.0,,"Hookahs, falafel, perfumes, scarves, carpets and much much more. Wander and enjoy the sights and sounds and smells of the Middle East in this tiny street tucked away in Bugis. Easy to access via the MRT and walking for a bit, cheap and fun and a good comparison ot the Asian and Indian cultures in the rest of the city."
,,Snack,3.0,,Walk up Arab Street loads of fabric shops souvenirs galore lovely fountain at the end little cafes ok for snacks be careful on pavements a little uneven
,,Strong feel Arabic Culture,5.0,,it was a very short time visited this place just sightseeing and walk around in the morning. you will find a beautiful Mosque the with the golden colour with some historical building. and we ended up with breakfast there it was great food but I forget what we had that time.
,,Nice street to walk through and see the Arab shops,3.0,,The Arab street has its own atmosphere. The shops show the Arab ware. It is worth a visit. It was not very crowded when we went there. The mosque is worthwhile to visit.
,,cute and cheap shopping!,5.0,,"so cute area!when night comes it is so lively ,with a lot of options to eat!during the day you can go to shops fro cheap souvenirs!"
,,Street of Many Names,3.0,,"Arab Street, in Singapore's Kampong Glam Malay Quarter, is one of the few streets in this area to have retained its original name.

It was so named because this area was designated for the Arab community in Sir Stanford Raffles' 1822 town plan for the development of Singapore.

Despite its official name, Arab Street was often called Kampong Java by local Malays or Jawa Koi (Java Street) by local Chinese.

The Javanese had moved in and set up business in eating houses and food stalls, and selling food and vegetables. The Javanese women also set up flower stalls, which gave rise to yet another nickname for Arab Street, Pookadei Sadakku, which is Tamil for Flower Street.

Overtime, the Javanese influence diminished and it is again a predominantly Malay street."
,,Not a lot to see,3.0,,"If you are into buying material or quirky little gifts, then this is the place for you. It's a very small area to cover and beside the little market, there are plenty of fabric shops. Nothing here that took my eye, so didn't stay long."
,,Very silent,4.0,,Went there for a bit of arabic experience as it is nice to see all the different parts of the town. But it wasn't as hectic as we would have expected it.
,,...and you should end it with a Teh Tarik,5.0,,"Arab Street and the whole Kampong Glam area is a walk down memory lane, bring you back to when the Arab merchants settled here & conducted business. Altho there's been a gentrification of the area, there is enough of yesteryear to captivate you for a couple of hours (mornings or evenings are best times). Sultan Mosque nearby, Sultan Gate just next door & Bussorah Street with its myriad of shops are attractions worth the visit. Nearby Haji Lane is a draw for the youngsters & young-at-heart. Need a fancy dress?...take your pick from the shops that'll sell/rent you the garb. but..whatever you do, dont walk away from Arab street without ending your journey by having a nice hot cuppa teh tarik (indian milk tea). At the junction of Baghdad and Kandahar Street is a 'hole-in-the-wall' chai-wallah, where you walk up & place your order, and thereafter chose from the many al fresco tables along the corridor, sit down..sipping the tea, and relax and start your people-watch downtime."
,,Nice place to have a drink at night,4.0,,"Arab street is a nice place to have a few drinks at night. We visited this place two times on friday and saturday night, live music and lots of nice people having a drink outside."
,,Visitv to the Grand Mosque n The Old Sultan Palace,5.0,,Such an interesting n unique architecture displayed that was built by hand 200 years ago. Spent almostv 2 hours touring around n felt so connected by this 2 buildings n areas. Left us with a warmed feelings of nostalgicness n good aura.
,,Silk silk silk,3.0,,"Decent enough area predominantly full of dress shops, so if you don't want to buy silk etc, maybe not for you. A few decent Turkish and Lebanese cafes/restaurants which are reasonably priced."
,,Beautiful Materials etc.,4.0,,An interesting area to visit and good to see another culture and its wonderful colours. Buildings around the area are very interesting and now far from the European shops if you want those too
,,what an amazing place,5.0,,This was a find by accident for me it is a treasure trove of sights and sounds it is really worth a visit the mosque is stunning
,,Silk shops galore,5.0,,"I spent an afternoon shopping for silk in the many shops on Arab Street. The selection and prices ranged widely with something for everyone. All the shopkeepers were helpful and courteous and I was spoilt for choice. If you want silk to have an outfit made, or make yourself, then Arab Street is the place to go."
,,Nice area,4.0,,Went to Arab Street after a walk in the botanical garden. Nice area for a stroll and some Lebanese food. Later in the evening there are several nice little bars with lots of people.
,,Mix of Modern and Old,5.0,,Arab street is full of very unique and hip boutiques as well as a beautiful mosque. Spend time here to get a sense of the art and culture that exists in Singapore.
,,Sexy coffee,5.0,,"A nice and clean place to have a drink and chill while shopping at Campong glam area. Coffee was good, very helpful and kind staff."
,,Great Area for many different reasons,4.0,,"Taking friends for a first time visit, she was amazed by the number of materiel stores and all things related to sewing. A paradise for sewers. The area is fascinating with the mosque near by dominating the scene. Many little shops to explore for bargains and gifts. Also a number of local Cafes to try."
,,Great food,4.0,,"Singapore is unique in the perfect coexistence of all cultures, Arab street is an example. I would recommend finding one of the small restaurants for lunch."
,,Lively Neighborhood,4.0,,"Lively and colorful neighborhood filled with great restaurants, bars and interesting shops. My boyfriend and I only spent one evening there, but we had a great dinner. Lots of choices, both local as well as western fare. It's a good spot for an evening stroll, dinner and drinks."
,,Great and Interesting!,5.0,,"Really liked this area. Its different and interesting area with colonial kind of architecture. Small shops and restaurants on both sides of the street with a view of beautiful Masjid Sultan.
Lively place with people in evening with lot of food outlets of arab/turkish food options can say 'middle east off singapore' :)
A must visit place which gives you positive vibes!!"
,,India is here,5.0,,"No need to travel to India. You can find some great pieces of jewelry, rugs, fabrics and dishes. You will see the best gold craftsmen around. You must go to see the jewelry. The intricate details on the necklace and bracelets is like no other. They allow you to try it on and experience that wow feeling. While there stop to have some tea turik. It is a milk tea that has a smooth taste. You must experience to appreciate."
,,Nice street cafes and pubs,5.0,,Love heading down to Arab street. From shops to cafes and to pubs. For the young and the old. Good location for photography.
,,Beautiful place to relax and shop,5.0,,I really enjoyed this place. Ir has a wonderful mesquete and reallt nice arab silk. Nor expensive but you have to bargen prices. Have something to drink in one of the bars. Loved this place. Its a must go.
,,Interesting area and great Pashminas,4.0,,Loved this area - very interesting and lovely fabric shops. We got caught in a big thunderstorm here - but there was lots of shelter and several good coffee shops to shelter from the weather.
,,Good for Meditarian and Arab Culture,4.0,,"This street is one of famous street in Singapore mainly for Arabian food. Either Veg or Non Veg. This place got lot of variety in food as well as other items such as decorative items, shawls, carpets and many more. One of the food paradise (Arabian or Middle Eastern Food)"
,,Strictly for foodie,4.0,,"I am a foodie, visited Arab street after a suggestion from one of my friend... Lamb steak @ one of the restaurant (don remember the name) was mind blowing. You can get all Arab type food here, price is moderate... You can also find some accessories, boutique and artefact shops, they are not worth it for money as far as I checked, but still you can give a try."
,,Nice for an afternoon walk,4.0,,"We had a relaxing stroll in the area, where the streets are lined with shops selling fabric, carpets, clothes and shawls (pashminas). Located nearby are the Sultan's Mosque and Malay Heritage Centre. Along Bussorah Street, there are restaurants and cafes serving an array of dishes from different Middle Eastern countries. We didn't go into the restaurants, but we did takeaway some kebabs for dinner, which I think was a bit pricey at over SGD10 for one kebab. The most important reason to visit this area is the cheap souvenirs! You can get keychains for that cousin you dislike at SGD1 for 5 pieces!"
,,Singapore Middle East!,5.0,,"I usually go there for a hang out with friends...its awesome place for Arabic food lovers...
In addition to new trendy hangouts, Arab Street celebrates its colorful heritage.
Rather than just one road, Arab Street actually refers to the area including Bussorah Street, Haji and Bali Lanes and Muscat Street.
Part of the culturally rich Kampong Glam heritage trail, Arab Street -- surrounded by brightly colored fabrics and textiles, hand-knotted Persian rugs and aromatic Arab teas -- is Singapore's Muslim quarter.
Its heart is the Masjid Sultan Mosque, with a history that reaches back 200 years.
But this is also an area of indie boutiques, restored shop-houses and street arts (not a common sight in Singapore) -- that attract anyone from buskers to tourists to families."
,,A modern time warp,5.0,,"Here is a part of singapore that blends past history with modernity.
A fabulous place full of eateries, shops, trendy shops and bars, excellent place to unwind and see a different face of singapore . go at night and stroll along the narrow lanes . A few nice places to catch great jazz music too . Has one of the largest mosques in sg too . Still retains a wonderful fusion of asain and middle Eastern feel."
,,Great area,5.0,,"Surprised to find excellent cafes with great coffee, different side to Singapore massive shopping complexes"
,,Reviving kampong spirit,5.0,,"This enclave has different character in the day and the night. A more local crowd the in day. Enjoy the myriad of nasi padang and shopping. By night, the bars and indie-bands come alive. Albeit the overpriced alcoholic drinks, the convivial atmosphere is electic."
,,Visit Haji Lane,4.0,,I enjoyed exploring this Little Arabia area of Singapore. My favorite was Chinatown and probably my least favorite was Little India.

,,A fresh heart beat,4.0,,"We love to explore this part of Singapore.
The mosque is a central feature and the restaurants around it offer many delights inspired by middle eastern quinine.

,,Kampong Glam and Arab Street were great,5.0,,This is and experienced we have never had before. We arrived at lunch time on Friday and walked into an authentic looking restaurant right across the road from the Mosque. As we sat down the owner explained there would be about a 30 minute delay as all of the cooks were across the road for Friday prayers! We sat in the air conditioned empty restaurant drinking cold drinks while we listened to the chanting across the road. Suddenly the restaurant was full and our food was on the table. It was delicious!! The shopping in Kampong Glam was first class and with usual Singaporean efficiency all like shops are together and the prices are great. We filled up with gifts for our friends at home!!!
,,Fun place to hang out with Middle east touch.,3.0,,"An interesting place to hang out with friends, very colorful area as the building painted in bright and cheerful colors. Many bars and restaurant that serves mostly middle east food and shisha of course.

Will be best to go there at 6 pm ish where all the shops completely open with the street lighting make it more life."
,,lots of color and food!,4.0,,"A quaint street painted in very bright colors with houses opening up tiny cafes in the ground floor in the evenings ( or some in the morning) Many shops selling carpets and silk fabrics from the middle east.

,,Peep into Arab culture in Singapore,4.0,,"Visited there with friends for dinner and was amazed by the way the street was done. Its one of the oldest streets and has been kept exactly the same way it used to be long back with no high rise buildings. The street gives you a glimpse of middle east with shops, music, restaurants, mosque around. Must visit if you love Arab food and ambience."
,,Good food,3.0,,"--We went for dinner on our first day and hope to had any Persian place but unfortunately there was none at Arab street.We end up with some Lebanon restaurant.

,,interesting,4.0,,some interesting arabian food and wares and is a good attempt to create an arab atmosphere in the middle of the city
,,Dilip Imports,5.0,,"Can not recommend Dilip Imports highly enough. Beautiful Indian block prints. Table cloths,bedspreads,napkins, sarongs silk scarves and more. Friendly helpful sales staff. Have been to Singapore 3 times and have gone back each time to purchase gifts."

,,Lively part of Singapore,4.0,,"Arab Street is just one of a number of interesting streets in Kampong Glam. Its good for sightseeing or just strolling around. Some of the shops in the area look out of 1001 nights, quite exotic. Despite within the sound of the evening prayer from the nearby Sultans Mosque, it is possible to sit down and have a good Belgian Beer in one of the many cafes."
,,a lot of shisha action,2.0,,not for kids to go unless for food and the only people there to be exact are indians other than the half who are arabs.

,,Friday night fabulous.,5.0,,"Arrived in Singapore after a very long flight including lost luggage.

Ended up at Arab street after a little explore.

Did not disappoint. Though slightly pricy, the beers on Haji lane are ice cold and the atmosphere is electric.

Beautiful area with incredible scenery. Will return."
,,Get outside of the Malls!!,5.0,,"Loved this heritage part of the city, the Mosque is beautiful and both Arab Street and Haji Lane is great for a late afternoon stroll, lots of great eateries and little tucked away bars. While you are there check out the eclectic shops on Haji Lane (a great way to shop Singapore outside of the large chains and malls) to find great little vintage and hard to find gifts. Malay Heritage centre is just off Arab Street."
,,WERE WE IN SINGAPORE OR IRAN.. LOVED OUR DAY HERE,5.0,,"A real cultural day out with delicious food, Turkish coffee , Turkish apple tea served in gorgeous hand painted teapots.
Fabulous quality fabrics including linen, silk, cotton, hemp, buttons, ribbons amazing sequins and tassels a dressmakers paradise.
The Aromatic oils and potions are wonderful but most shops selling these are in the back lanes.

,,Trendy place,4.0,,"In the day you can visit arab street, also next street over to haji lane if you are in the area. Alot of small local shops and selling unique things. There are also grafitti walls that youngsters like to shop there and take photos. Won't take long to walk, because it's only one long strecth and that's it. At night, arab street is very happening with cafes, drinking and loud music!"
,,A pleasant surprise,4.0,,"While living in Singapore till 2004 this area was charming with it's old town houses, however not yet the trendy place it has now become. It was therefore a pleasant surprise for us to visit this area while in Singapore in Feb. 2016. Lot's of good restaurants and shops - souvenirs as well as designer shops. Well worth a visit."
,,Something different other than hitting the malls,4.0,,"I've been going to Singapore quite frequently in the last 15 years but it was my first time to check out Arab Street. It's quite different from the usual skyscrapers and modern buildings. This is Singapore's version of Old Town albeit not a very big one. It's just about three short blocks, with one street lined with dining options. There's another street with wall art that's attractive for photo op."
,,A quirky little piece of culture in Singapore,5.0,,"I have been a number of times now and it never fails to make me smile. It has an attitude and heart that is significantly different to much of Singapore. the food is great, the beer is cold and the music is always entertaining. You can also pick up some gorgeous material (expensive but top quality) at any of the sixteen billion material shops there."
,,Arabic Food,4.0,,We went there on Friday after noon. Lot of options on Arabic food. We ordered Bukhari and mandi at Morocoon restaurant on muscat street. It was excellent. Sultan Masjid is very good.
,,Alternative,5.0,,"If you want to experience something that promotes freedom, multiculturalism and tasteful bars and restaurants, this is definitely your street!!!"
,,Colourful Street in Singapore,4.0,,"While walking down from Lavender's we decided to explore this side of Singapore . The Street has narrow lanes which are built creatively with a good art over it .
Sultan Mosque and Kampong Glam are two sites which attracts maximum tourists . The Street is full of diverse eateries and has middle eastern bend of clothing and accessories shops . Walk around Haji lane to experience some nice architecture and wall Art ."
,,Nice painted streets with lots of Restaurants,5.0,,Nice place to visit and Mosque is beautiful. Nice painted narrow street with shopping options and for foodies
,,"Good Food, but not many options",3.0,,If you want to savour some good food then Arab Street is the place...but the only downside is that there are not many options available... You can reach here from Lavender MRT or Bugis Interchange MRT.
,,Fascinating if you love fabrics and carpets,4.0,,"I spent a lot of time exploring the shops along Arab Street. Beware of the shop keepers who stand at their shop entrance urging you to come in and buy! I succumbed to several lengths of fabric, also some pot stands in a Turkish shop with beautiful lamps and ceramic ware."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Very nice to stroll around the streets.Most shops didn't open until 12 so plan your trip accordingly.
,,Great to visit,4.0,,Interesting area around and including Arab Street. Lots of colourful wall art in the narrow streets. Plenty of places to eat with a variety of foods. Lots of shops and stalls for gifts.
,,Interesting,3.0,,Smaller than what you imagine. Visit after 10 am or later in the evening when it is cooler. Great architecture but there are more interesting things to go and see in Singapore if time is limited.
,,Great place for tourists..,4.0,,Everyone should go there once while traveling in Singapore. There is also many shops you can shop.there is many variety of place where u can eat foods
,,"Lots of atmosphere, great place to visit",5.0,,"A must do in Singapore. Lots of great scenery, from the colonial style buildings, to the amazing Mosque, wall art and excellent food restaurants and stalls. At night the street is closed to cars so it comes alive with lots of people walking around and enjoying the area."
,,National Heritage,5.0,,"It takes my heart to Eden when I woke up on Monday morning sometimes at 5+ am in December to hear the call of the prayer [Azan Subuh] in Kg Glam [Arab Street]. This was the first time I ever heard this call in Singapore as Kg Glam has been declared a National Heritage.

Good - as this spices up the tradition of the Arab Street, the Malay heritage, and the environment reminiscent of the early 1900s when major parts of Singapore were owned by the wealthy Arabs.

And above all, this shows the cultural richness of Singapore and preservation is the way to go.

The concept of a Malay, Arab, Middle East, and Indian Muslims village within an Urban Jungle is a very pleasant and unique attraction."
,,I like at night,4.0,,"It's nice place it's nice to goo at night it's close about 11pm There are a lot of restaurants Arabic and Turkish and it's good street for Muslim people all the food ther it's halal,and there is big mosque it's name sultan mosque"
,,They also have street party's on Saturday!,5.0,,"I like Piedra Negra, the Spanish place in the street and how busy it is. They sometimes have big parties in this street where all the bars set up their own music."
,,Nothing impressive,3.0,,I found it boring. I visited this place and ate in some restaurants there but it is quite usual and not so special at least for me. Singapore has much better attractions.
,,Going downhill,3.0,,The Arab quarter used to be an unusual and exciting place to visit but it has been going downhill lately and some of the unique shops have moved away.
,,"Colorful, fun, and a good place to eat",5.0,,"We spent several hours in the Arab quarter. Most streets were fairly quiet, but several were busy with shops and restaurants and lots of people. We shopped, bought some souvenirs, and found a very nice Turkish restaurant where we could have a light lunch on a patio while people watching. Easy to reach from the Bugis MRT stop."
,,"Great Food, Similar Feel to Middle East",4.0,,I really felt like I was back in the Middle East! And the mosque was a beautiful subject of my photos.
,,Grate Arabic food,5.0,,"Good option to eat and middle-east food. I like a lot the libaneses options, very good to seat outside and eat and stay looking for the movement."
,,Good Friday,4.0,,one of famous street. very close to Sultan Mosque. i went Sultan Mosque for Friday prayder. then i had my lunch in Turkish Restuarant. good place.
,,"Fabric and tailors, with snacks nearby!",4.0,,"I come here for quality fabric - things like silks, batiks and 100% flax linens. There are a variety of purveyors and plenty of tailors who can turn your few metres of lovely into whatever you are looking for. And if you get hungry while shopping, there are plenty of places to get a nibble or an entire meal.

My husband prefers the shops selling rugs and the colorful glass lights you see all over Singapore. There are lots of places that compete for price, and they'll make them to spec - any size or combination of colors you want. We will definitely be getting one of those before we leave!"
,,interesting cultural diversity,5.0,,"visit this place for its arabic vibe, from food to smoking shisha to people watching. if you are looking for carpets, this is a good place!"
,,Pleasant area,4.0,,This was the first place we stumbled upon in Singapore after we got off the bus. The street is full of nice restaurants so we came back later for dinner. The view of the mosque is really nice and the atmosphere of the area is unique and pleasant.
,,"Too clumsy, but a neat place for some good arabic food, and some good shisha / hookah",3.0,,"Too clumsy, but a neat place for some good Arabic food, and some good shisha / hookah, the traditional water pipe. You dont seem to find them a lot in Singapore, but you will here. Mind your wallet though, cause its expensive."
,,Very interesting part of Singapore,5.0,,"Loved to walk and stop by at little shops in this area of the city. A lasting cultural experience. My wife enjoyed finding little gifts for family back home, and meanwhile even young children find things that grab their attention, so it is absolutely okay with kids, if u want to add this programme to your visit in Singapore.
A family father"
,,Love this street,5.0,,"Sure take some pics of haji Lane but take some time to discover Arab Street. The vendors are friendly and the silk fabrics are glorious. I love to sew which makes Arab Street my slice of heaven. I bought a rug from Ali at Serapi Carpets, 87 Arab Street. Such a wonderful relaxed interaction. Looking forward to unwrapping the perfect parcel back at home in New Zealand."
,,Great discovery,5.0,,"An underrated gem in Singapore, it's full of beautiful places to shop and has lots of great food and a gorgeous big mosque to admire."
,,Mind the heat,4.0,,"This is an excellent place to walk around and shop and eat, but be prepared for the heat. We found it stifling and other people had the same issue."
,,Great for Evening Dining,5.0,,"I never really payed much attention to Arab Street. We decided to go there for Ramadan at sundown to watch people feast at the end of the day. It was a unique experience to watch people sit at the table with food in front of them and wait for them to broadcast some guy singing and then everyone starts eating all at the same time. You probably won't get to plan your trip around Ramadan but if you do then it's worth checking it out. Arab Street is a nice little place to visit if you have an extended stay in Singapore or you're looking for something else to do. The restaurants aren't a must do. But the few that I've been to have been good. If you're a local, you should at least walk to Arab Street and Haji Lane to check out the area. The mosque at sunset is a pretty sight to see."
,,Beautiful Fabrics and Mosque,4.0,,"Wonderful street with soooo many fabric shops and I love fabrics. My only problem here was the shop keepers hanging right by my side as I wandered around looking at the fabrics. I very much prefer to look around without someone RIGHT AT MY SIDE! I believe it's a cultural thing with the shopkeepers, but I don't like it. Loved walking around a corner and there was the beautiful Sultan Mosque! At one shop a lady was very helpful explaining to me the difference between Pashmina scarves and other scarves."
,,Not more than ok,2.0,,I would not call the area Arabian. It is heavily influenced by Turkish Shops and restaurants. Quite commercial. Many tailors.
,,"Buzzing, lively area",4.0,,"Lots of shops and restaurants. Good for day or night. You can spend several hours exploring the area, take a break, have a cold, refreshing beverage and go back to more exploring."
,,"Lovely old part of Singapore, with fabric, rattan,and food places.",4.0,,"Love visiting this area, for Chinese and silk fabrics, carpets, and rattan ware. Also Muslim food restaurants and nicknacks . A must area to just walk around if not a shopper."
,,eating and just liiking around,4.0,,well worth the walk in the heat or a short trip on MRT we spent a good couple of hours just browsing around and liking at all the little stalls and then have a great indian feed vey nice and the price is soo cheap compared to indian food on australia
,,Colorful Location Near MRT,5.0,,"Small but beautiful. Lots of wonderful cafes and interesting shops in which you can buy textiles, fragrances, spices, and so on."
,,lots to offer,5.0,,be it shopping for clothes and carpets or eat arab/lebanese/turkish food the Arab street has lots to offer. we picked up lot of clothes from the shop Aikbee textile 69/70 Arab street
,,A great street for browsing,5.0,,This is a lovely area of Singapore for a visit. Many beautiful fabric shops and coffee houses. The fabrics can be pricey but it is possible to pick up beautiful scarves and sarongs for a very reasonable price. a great street for browsing and people watching.
,,Eating shopping browsing coffee,5.0,,"Whatever your looking for Arab street is an amazing little spot in singapore to visit - the quaint little shops , bespoke restaurant and bars , outside Arab dining and the beautiful mosque ( try the tour if you can!)
You won't be sorry you visited :)"
,,nice,4.0,,The district for buying material and carpets a little part of old Singapore a nice day out with some good food
,,Low-rise Singapore,4.0,,"One of the older parts of Singapore harking back to its colonial days, notwithstanding its touristy feel. Souvenir shops, a local mosque, trendy new designer boutiques and delicious eateries (are there any other kind in Singapore?) all mix together to provide a thoroughly pleasant way to spend half a day in Singapore."
,,Good place,4.0,,Located between lavender and bugis. Nice place to eat halal foods. Place to by muslim traditional dresses. Bugis MRT is nearest one. Good place for spending evening time.
,,Living History,5.0,,"A fascinating area with the Temple a photographic gem. A short walk down a middle eastern inspired mall, which is packed full of eateries, souvenir shops with the historical significance very apparent. We took an easy walking tour which lasted 3 hours with the significance, streets, and customs of Kampon Glam explained in detail.. It is a quaint and pretty area where you will possibly pick up something a little unusual or find some great food in the market. It was one of the attractions in Singapore we most enjoyed during our stay . Take the time to discover the background and you will find it is definitely something a little different from mainstream Orchard Road shopping."
,,Not worth the effort,2.0,,"Like it's neighbor, Haji Lane, there is very little that appeals about this street. Both suggest something exotic, interesting or even surprising, but neither live up to the hype that surrounds them. There are other more fascinating places to wander nearby."
,,Good Place to Eat Halal Food,4.0,,There are quite a few good Halal Restaurants available. Foods are usually good over there. Good for tourists to enjoy something different.
,,Mini middle east,4.0,,"Midway between Lavender & Bugis is Arab Street, easy to reach of you just keep walking towards the golden mosque dome & minarets. The area is full of middle eastern eateries, with waiters clamouring to get the attention of tourists and lure them in for pricy food. A couple of souvenir shops close to the mosque have interesting items, reasonably priced (some of the stuff is better than Chinatown). The area also houses some hip cafes, and loads of textile shops.

Tip : Do not forget to take a picture of the palm-tree lined street leading to the mosque."
,,One of my favourites,5.0,,"Fabric stores are amazing here. There is so much to see and smell, worth a visit anytime you are in Singapore."
,,Dark at night,3.0,,"Walking at night is a little bit scary. But at daylight it was not that scary at all. The street was awesome and modern. There is a plenty of good Arabic restaurant nearby, and of course it is HALAL."
,,I am not interested to shop at this street. Randomly I found some products were more expensive compared to Mustafa Cent,2.0,,30 minutes walk along the street is too long for nothing interested to see. Only quiet shops with few visitors.
,,Loved it.,5.0,,"This is an intriguing little area which retains its original charm whilst quiet clearly being a tourist trap. If you are into textiles, trimmings, sewing etc this will be a treasure trove for you. Well worth a roam around."
,,Pleasant,3.0,,"While there is a mosque in the middle of the street, just around the corner are chic bars and restaurants. If you have been to Soho in Hong Kong and the area around the mosque there - this feels like Singapore's equivalent.

Decent and cheap food and souvenirs. Worth a quick visit if you are in town. If you're not eating, I'd spend about 30 minutes here."
,,Consumerism abound but the feel good ethnic atmosphere still linger...,3.0,,Lots of cafe and restaurant offerings halal foods and off course souvenirs. Better than Little India but bland nonetheless. Better come in early evening for dinner or late afternoon for coffee and perhaps some shisha
,,Fabric and scarves to die for!,5.0,,"Someone recommended I come here given my passion for fabric and I wasn't disappointed. Taxi (cheap as) dropped me off and I was immediately sucked in to the culture and the market/verandah layout given the thunder and lightening had just welcomed me. Bargain at first stop - two, beautiful good quality Pashmina scarves for the price of one because I was this shops first sale of the day - $10 each but two for $10??? Unbelievable!
Gorgeous fabric's and a lovely Lebanese lunch completed with rain and thunder galore!. A fantastic place to come to and I will be back."
,,Visit the Mosque,3.0,,"Mostly Turkish food, however there was a wide choice from other places. You will find something for your palate."
,,"Chic, laid back vibe",5.0,,"This is an interesting place culture wise. Plenty of good food, particularly Mediterranean and Malay cuisine and shops selling scarves, baskets, fabric and the like. A great place to visit both during the day or at night, and also where the Sultan Mosque (one of Singapore's most important mosques history-wise) is located."
,,Beautiful architecture and lots of Cafes,5.0,,"Lovely place to stroll and people watch at the many cute little cafes. Recommend .. ""Wonderland cafe and ""I am"" both on Haji lane."
,,Nice small boutiques and restaurants,4.0,,"Nice area where spending the end of the day, doing some shopping or having a drink. Plenty of small restaurants make this district the perfect end of the day location!"
,,ok,3.0,,Its ok supposed to be best place for buying dress materials. Also a nice place for middle east & mediterranean food.
,,Wonderful slice of old Singapore,5.0,,"Wonderful shops, food and atmosphere, close to Bugis MRT and Sultan Mosque, try the Lebanese Restaraunts"
,,Kitsch,4.0,,"In an entertaining sort of way, the kitsch here does grow on you. Perfumes, carpets and fabrics, what's not to like?"
,,I had a great time here,4.0,,"This is the kind of place that is Singapore at its finest. The neighborhood, the architecture, many of the shops, the markets, etc., are vibrant and attractive with a variety of merchandise. The shopkeepers were friendly and helpful. In a short visit to Singapore, I went back here twice."
,,Fun!,4.0,,Great place to walk around and grab quick eats. Was pretty busy when we went on a Thursday evening for dinner.
,,Souvenir for everybody,5.0,,"Looking souvenirs for relatives and friends? Find it here. Key chain, fridge magnet as low as SGD1. Grab it here."
,,Very nice for hang out. Small neighbourhood.,5.0,,"Native Malay & Muslim historical site. There are restaurants, Malay Indonesian Middle Eastern Thai cuisines. Halal. Nice to relax at the cafes. People here are more relax too unlike Chinatown where everyone busy going about their lives working. Photogenic too."
,,A fascinating area to visit,5.0,,We loved the Arab Street area. We ladies particularly loved the beautiful perfume shops where you can buy lovely unusual glass presume bottles and have your own perfume mixed for you. There are many restaurants where you can try local food which we found to be delicious and reasonably priced.
,,Malay community!,5.0,,"Here is a very important place to visit to understand malay culture, one of the main ethnic groups in singapore. A must see is the beautiful sultan mosque."
,,Surprise,4.0,,"the place was different from common sightseeing spot in Singapore. I like this place even more than Little India; I enjoyed wandering, good Turkish food over there. And there were some awesome special / indies shops around."
,,Great Find,5.0,,"Not very well advertised, so it wasn't very crowded when I went. Found some great food, But there was NO alcohol, but that wasn't a problem. So go have a night out, walk the street and grad a feed."
,,Good for fabrics,4.0,,"We went down here, was great for fabric shopping, like a large version of spotlight. The shop owners are a little pushy but no more than expected"
,,boring,2.0,,"very smelly and dirty careful where you eat and watch your bags, was close to our hotel not very rapt in the scenery"
,,interesting side of Singapore,3.0,,"I went here last Saturday night. Interesting area to walk around and the mosque makes for a good photo. I ate at a restaurant and the food was pretty average. I think it's hard to compete here for food as in my view, there are so many better food options in Singapore."
,,So colourful,4.0,,"The Arab District was right across the road from our hotel so we just had to stroll over to feel like we were in a different country. What a great, colourful place full of tiny little lanes and hidden gems. We strolled around the Malay Community Gardens and got up close to the mosque. There are loads of shops selling mostly material, carpets and souvenirs as well as a choice of restaurants. A good place to walk around for a couple of hours and immerse yourself in the old Singapore."
,,Good area with small shops and bars/restaurants,4.0,,Nice area to walk araound and look at the middle eastern products on sale. Plenty of small restaurants serving food and drink
,,A gentle approach,4.0,,Arab Street is well laid out and has an air of peacefulness about it. In the distance you can see the golden dome of the mosque. As you walk along restauranteurs invite you in to try their delicious food. I enjoyed this area.
,,A current time historical place,5.0,,"A relatively small area that holds a lot in history and culture. Plenty of restaurants to choose from. One of the best places to shop for ""Oud and Oud oil"" in the world."
,,Nice Area for an evening out,4.0,,"We visited the Arab Street area whilst visiting Singapore in March. The area has a number of Bars and restaurants together with some general shops. Its best to visit Arab Street in the evening as bars and restaurants are busy with visitors and some places even have live street music with people dancing in the open.

Most restaurants in the area serve foreign food e.g. Arabic/Turkish, that said, there are some traditional restaurants as well.

The area also has a mosque for those who wish to use this facility."
,,Culture Inside Singapore,5.0,,"I walked in Arab street to see the mosque. It's different from the Arab area in Bangkok, nicer and look like unseen Singapore"
,,Interesting for lunch and a quick walk around,3.0,,"We had a very cheap, delicious lunch in a hawkers center followed by a quick walk around. For me 1 hour was enough. Just too hot to fully appreciate all that was going on."
,,Good for walking!,4.0,,"Great street for a walk, you could know different cultures and taste different meals in just a street."
,,It's a great lace to visit,4.0,,Excellent food and shops. Trendy eateries and clothing shops in side streets. Would visit again on next trip. The Mosque at the end of Arab Street makes for a stunning vista

,,Another world!,5.0,,"If you are going to the Arab street you will think, that you are in another world. You are feeling like you feel in arabic countries. Fascinating!!!"
,,Materials Galore,4.0,,We went to Kampong Glam to buy some material and we were not disappointed. Indeed it was hard to choose as there were so many shops selling such beautiful materials. Besides the material shops there are now some little boutiques selling anything from handmade crafts to fashion clothing. We had lunch at a Turkish restaurant which was most enjoyable. Afterwards we walked around window shopping and paused to take photos outside the magnificent mosque with the golden domes. Kampong Glam is a good area to visit if you like shopping and also if you like to see some of the original Singapore shop houses.
,,I was really disappointed,1.0,,"The Mosque is really nice, but the restaurants quality is really terrible, I advise you not to go to any of the Moroccan restaurants there, that is not how Moroccan food is cooked and it is a shame to serve it like that."
,,Simply quirky,5.0,,This is just an interesting part of SG. Every corner of the street (both Haji Lane and Arab Street) will interest you with little cute shophouses or bars and restaurants. It's just a good mixture of the old and the new.
,,One of the top 10 things to do in Singapore,4.0,,"A very colorful area (Kampong Glam) of Singapore which reflects the Arab / Middle Eastern heritage of the Island. It is on the red bus red tour and has a stop round the corner. Arab street and the surrounding area is full of cafes, shops and restaurants. The highlight of the area is the Sultan Mosque which has an interesting story going back to the original ruling Sultan of the region and Stamford Raffles period.
If you are shopping for a real good quality silk scarf try Dilip on 74 Arab street.
Also visit Haji lane next door which has interesting boutique shops."
,,Went for excellent malay food,3.0,,"Went there for lunch, went to walk around. Full of turkish restaurant and malay nasi padang stalls. If you want to make malay traditional wear, this is the place to go as well."
,,A Relaxing Walk,4.0,,Nice little shops and restaurants around. Good area to have some tea with friends while watching along the quite road. Very colorful and vibrant area.
,,Quaint and enjoyable,5.0,,We came here after the disappointing China Town and it was lovely. It has an authentic feel to it and the mosque is very beautiful. We didn't eat there so am not sure on the food but it all looked good.
,,One Of Many Interesting Streets In This Partb Of Singapore,3.0,,The area is a Muslim area of Singapore and has many interesting sights that are clearly Muslim. Arab street is one with a distinctly different feel to it. Make sure you visit nearby Kampk Glam.
,,Not what we expected - over rated shopping experience,3.0,,"We were a bit disappointed here. It just seemed very run down and the stalls at the markets sold items that were very cheaply made. Being worried at times about eating in marketplaces, we didn't eat here after seeing how some of the food was being prepared and how the dishes were being washed in buckets of dirty water!! Not on my list to do again."

,,EN-ROUTE TO SERENGOON,5.0,,"We used to live in Serengoon Singapore 19 as it was in the 60's and were on the way to Serengoon Village when we stopped here. The old Kampong Villages have now gone and Arab Street
still holds a bit of the old character. Good to sit in a cool bar and talk to the locals who all speak better English than us. Good souvenirs too much much cheaper than Singapore City Shops."

he Sultan Mosque with its golden dome and minarets is also located in the area also in the area there are other interesting to see like the Malay heritage. I think it was worth visiting Arab Street.

Around these areas is where the Malay ethnicity reside and most of them are Muslim. It is the center of the Islamic community. Many of the shops are influence by Muslim culture selling prayer rugs, jilbab, Muslim caps."
,,"To get our best value, be prepared to bargain and walk away if your price is not met.",3.0,,"I went with the intent of finding batik fabrics and I did see some, mostly from Malaysia, but the prices are high and shop owners unwilling to bargain. Pashmina cashmeres are the best bargains. Ask to see the pashminas in the back of the store, they are a better quality that those hanging on racks on the sidewalk. Not much else to do other than take a picture of the mosque."
,,"Interesting shopping, great eating aresa",4.0,,"Cool area to shop with unusual jewelry, clothing, fabrics, with a Mid-East vibe. Nice restaurant selection with typical Singapore fare, or more middle eastern cuisine, yogurt shops. Great place to wander a bit a just window shop as well."

,,Respite from the hustle and bustle,5.0,,"Had never been here before but found it very laid back after the hustle and bustle of Chinatown, Little India and Bugis Street. Even on a Saturday it was quiet and relaxed. Different types of shops to browse and plenty of good restaurants. The mosque is impressive and overlooks the whole area."
,,Very nice - almost too nice - felt like an amusement park,4.0,,"This road was very nice. There are many souvenir shops with, as we were told by our tour guide, the best prices in the city. It seemed expensive, like everything else in Singapore, when compared to Kuala Lumpur or Bangkok. The problem though, is that they recently renovated and restored the mosque and the road, and it's TOO nice. It feels like you're walking in Epcot or some amusement park. It doesn't feel historic or real. But, nevertheless, the architecture is beautiful with the mosque's gold onion-shaped domes accenting the stark white exterior walls. Lots of nice restaurants on this strip too. It would have been great to sit outside and people watch if it weren't so hot."
,,The odd man out,4.0,,"The Arab street is among the few things that has survived from the past in Singapore and forms an important glimpse of the times long lost in the artificial concrete maze. Among your list of must visit places, this comes as a welcome change and gives you a chance to view how the old city looked like. There are a lot of shops where you can buy your souvenirs."
,,Cheap Eats with the MIddle East but without as much Chaos,5.0,,We went to Arab street a couple of times. Each time we found a little place to sit and have coffee or a smoothie or a beer in the evening. If you don't want to drink then you don't have to. There are lots of little nooks and crannies to look in to and the Mosque looks simply fantastic. I would have loved to see inside but did not wish to be bad mannered.
,,Hookah - Middle East Cuisine,5.0,,You'll get to see a beautiful mosque here. Some nice bikes parked on the side of the street. Good restaurants with music. Evening most of the restaurants are full & you may have to wait for a table.

,,Beautiful old area of the city graced with a beautiful mosque,5.0,,"I went to Arab street to buy silk. I had to apply rigid discipline to stop myself from spending everything I have in this road. The fabric shops are crazy beautiful with everything from Italian wool to saville row shirting to exquisite silks of every grade, colour and pattern imaginable. The road itself is fascinating with its shops, all decor related, and odd little cafes like the Sufi cafe. Around the corner is Haji Lane. A pedestrian road lined with gorgeous, unusual shops and cafe's."
,,a great morning out,5.0,,this is a must to get a feel of the other types of food and souvenirs on offer.There is a great lamp/lighting shop in the main street.lots of places of interest and a mosque to see.easily accessible by all modes of transport.

Its a great place to wander about"
,,Mix of old and new,4.0,,"Arab street offers the visitor the chance to sample good local food and shops, there are also newer modern shops ( still in older buildings ) selling designer type goods including clothes and Nick nacks. There is also Haji lane that is full of bars and coffee shops, here you can find the selfie coffee shop where you can get a selfie put on the top of your coffee. The area is only 15 minutes or so from the Raffles Hotel so is within easy reach."

,,Good for materials and souveniers,4.0,,"Joined a friend who wanted to visit this street and was surprised at the variety of materials for making clothes that was on offer, while the colours were very nice. There were also a number of shops with interesting souveniers for sale."
,,Compare and contrast,4.0,,"Worth a stroll around an area of Singapore that's as important as little India and Chinatown. It won't take long as this area only consists of a few blocks. There is a stunning mosque and some interesting turkish / arab style architecture.
There is a street almost entirely made up of restaurants where you can expect some hassle from the door staff if things are quiet. This was the only time during our visit to Singapore we were pestered. The food is not cheap but smelt wonderful. You could pick from a variety of cuisines. We actually ate a take out around the corner!"
,,Halal Food,3.0,,This is a small street basically of Muslim shops.There are lots of Muslim food outlets.Nothing special.If you have time go for a quick walk.
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"Was looking for something reflecting or explaining the naming of the street. Simply nothing. Yes it is defiantly muslims favorite area with all the halal dining options and the small nice shops in the narrow cozy streets, but no arabs in there."
,,Interesting walkabout in a diverse multicultural area,4.0,,"There is a whole range of shops restaurants and bars around this area.Everything from typical souvenirs,cheap clothes and beautiful materials by the metre if you like to sew,jewel bright glass lanterns and belly dancing outfits.There are typical Malay style Halal eating places,Arabic and Turkish with some in between.It is worth going to have a good look around find a bargain or two maybe and stop for a drink or two and a bite to eat."
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,"Hard to believe you are in Singapore. The sights, smells tastes, wow - so exotic. Visit at night when it all comes alive. The call for prayer just adds to the atmosphere. Well worth the visit."
,,Quaint,5.0,,"Nice little street in an area that has loads of eateries and cafes. Nice shops for fabric and clothes. Haggling is a must.
You can pick up lots of souvenirs if you are visiting on a holiday.
Don't miss the adjacent Haji Lane which has some snazzy places too.
Some of the basic eating places serve great food at a nominal price."
,,Colourful and quirky,5.0,,"Great place to spend an afternoon browsing through the fabric shops and the quirky little boutique style shops on Arab Street itself. Good for shopping for presents; prices ok and you will find something to suit most people there.
Visit the mosque, it's beautiful and the guides inside will tell you everything you want to know."

,,Nice options for Singaporean and Middle Eastern cuisine,4.0,,We enjoyed walking around Arab St. The name is misleading since there are many non Arab places for food and shopping. We enjoyed the small streets and the large mosque is there for tours as well.
,,nice,5.0,,"a little bit of arabic culture in Singapore. Thats just amazing! i love this place, the culture and smell"
,,Place for Fabric and carpets,4.0,,"Really liked walking down Arab St - lots of colourful fabric and carpets. Purchased a really colourful cushion cover for $10. One end is the mosque, the other some good food options. Worth the wander. Turn the corner and find yourself in Hijab lane. Full of quirky shops, home wears, bars and cafes. Very funky. We spent 2 hours peering in all the stores. Worth a look."
,,Old Singapore. Off the beaten track but fantastic,5.0,,Visited the Sultans Mosque and loved it. Very historic part of Singapore. Retailers are friendly but not pushy. Old building have so much charm. Walking tours are the go.
,,The place for fabric,4.0,,"Strolled through Arab street several times on our way to the SMRT station from our hotel, great for fabric & other materials, also a few cafes on the street"
,,"Window shop, or buy clothing or carpets here",5.0,,"Arab Street is a narrow, crowded bazaar of a few blocks near the Mosque in central Singapore. It is worth a stroll even if you only want to windowshop. The items of clothing and materials are beautiful and the quality of the items is quite good. And you can bargain! It is famed for its carpets from all over the Middle East. Ask Ali at No. 87 Arab Street to show you his Afgan war rugs. They are hard to find elsewhere. This is a regular stop whenever we are in Singapore, and it is always different and enjoyable."
,,great area to visit with some sights to visit and things to do,4.0,,"While there are 3 oriental areas in Singapore, one of them is Arab Street, which you can visit during stay in the city. It offers various options to explore and to see. For example museums, entertainment, eateries and many other things to do.

If you are tired you can visit some of foot massage saloons, or if you hungry, can visit some of restaurants or eateries... as well as you can shop there

one of highlights of Arab Street area is mosque"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,I found it delightful to stroll along the streets in this area. There are lots of little shops selling all sorts of things from fabrics to carpets and perfumes from the middle east. The area has a very relaxed vibe to it; quite different from the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road. Lots of good restaurants. The mosque is just a street over from Arab Street with a nice pedestrian mall. Go in the evening when it isn't quite so hot and all the restaurants & shops are open.
,,Old but trendy,5.0,,"There are many designer shops in small old houses, as well as cafes and restaurants; a fantastic area for a half-day tour!"
,,CLEAN INTERESTING AND A MUST DO FOR FABRIC,5.0,,This small area is really interesting and different to the rest of Singapore. It is a hub bub of small little independent cafes and shops. It is very trendy and the little eateries serve the best hummus and fallafel and make a change to the high end eateries and sophistication on offer elsewhere. For me the best part of this street was the fabric shops. The silks are the cheapest I have see anywhere and they come with the most superb service. There is also a couple of designer shops that sell beaded lace where designers come from all over the world to shop. Buy here it is peanuts in comparison to the States or the UK - take it home (or have it made there if you have a pattern) and have it made up.
,,Easy to find Halal Food,5.0,,Here you can easily find halal food with nice price. There any many Arab's restaurant and Malay dishes around.
,,Great to wonder arojnd,5.0,,"What a gorgeous part of the city. The architecture was amazing- the colours, little laneways and street art make for some great photo ops. Plenty of good coffee shops and boutique stores, but many were closed on my morning visit. Worth a look around."
,,Very trendy and hip,5.0,,We walked and looked. Mainly bars and clubs but had a lovely look and feel about it. Lovely cat cuddle cafe near it. If you are into that sort of thing. Obviously we love cats.
,,Love it!!,5.0,,"I love going to Arab Street (and near by streets like Aji Lane).. either on a week night for eating some Middle-Eastern Food, or on a Saturday afternoon to look at the little hipster like stores.
My favourite bar: OM on Aji Lane. My favourite restaurant (the upstairs can turn into a small dancing club): Magic Carpet."
,,Nice area to enjoy an afternoon,4.0,,"I really enjoyed having a walk at the Arab Street, after finishing my noon prayer at the Sultan Mosque, It is completely different atmosphere and a refreshment choice of food. There are many middle east cuisine restaurants, I had a very nice lamb kofta wrap at one of the Lebanese restaurants. The highlight was when I discovered there were many fabric stores and I ended the afternoon walk with shopping some nice fabric cotton with quite fair price."
,,See old buildings of Singapore from the 80s,5.0,,A good place to walk around. Plenty of cafes and eateries. The shophouses from the early days but the shops are selling modern items though. Search through Burpple for best cafe at Arab street to chill out.
,,Different atmosphere,5.0,,Great to soak in a completely different vibe and atmosphere to little India and China town. Many trendy street restaurants mainly serving middle eastern cuisine and fun quirky shops - a little overpriced but different to the same old same old you find in all the malls

,,"Nice atmosphere, crappy stores",3.0,,"The little shops here do not sell anything special in my opinion. Though nice to walk through the street, the restaurants are tourist trap expensive. The Sultan Mosque is a beautiful building however..."
,,An Opportunity to see Singapore in a different light,4.0,,"Because Singapore is an island, most of the development is skywards and this area shows you how Singapore was before the development. The focus is the Sultan Mosque with its gold dome and the streets in front of it with the many shops and restaurants where you can spend time at a leisurely pace"
,,Great place to spend a few hours,5.0,,"Lots of restaurants and atmosphere - great place to explore and catch up with friends. We spent the day walking and eating our way from Arab street, through china town to Marina Bay"

,,Right across the road from our hotel tad Park Royal on Beach,3.0,,"Walked, ate, drank, shopped here most days during our visit. Love it love it love. Such history and ethnic charm, do not miss a visit here"
,,Step back in time!,4.0,,You get a feel here of what most of Singapore would heve been like before all the modern development. It has a lovely atmosphere and plenty of small shops to visit and buy from.The mosques are close by too.

,,A lovely place to visit,4.0,,"This area is colourful, bustling and full of things to see. With lots of restaurants, bars, cafes and shops all vying for your custom, the touts trying to get you to eat at their restaurants are persistent but friendly. One of my favourite places in Singapore."

,,Interesting!,5.0,,"Arab street is in the Muslim community area.....
What a busy, bustling street this was with trafffic and pedestrians!

Old shop houses, bazaar style shopping, heaps and heaps of beautiful fabrics for sale, a great place to buy from if you are a Dress maker.
This area is also renowned for batiks from Indonesia and Malaysia, which have been hand-made and sold in sarong lengths. Machine-printed batik with traditional designs is also available by the metre or in ready-made clothing including shorts, sundresses, ties, etc and much more.

There is quite a bit of caneware, rattan and straw products, trinkets, just a fun place to explore, and don't forget to haggle if you want to buy!"
,,Good walking stree,4.0,,"We take many walking tours when in Singapore and Arab street is one of our favorites. Always something interesting to see, window shopping and popping in and out of various stores."
,,Just a walk,3.0,,"Decided to walk around the neighbourhood whitest staying in the area. Full of fabrics, textiles and food. Only ate once at a north Indian restaurant but wasn't too impressed with the food.
Nice atmosphere, clean and prices are better than downtown so your dollars will go a little further."
,,the feel of arab land within Singapore,4.0,,"With TUrkish, lebanes and other Arab cuisine on offer this palce is for those who get bored from the usual stuff.. the decor of the place has been done according to their ethnic taste.. there are multiple options out here and one will not fall short of them"
,,Not that much there,3.0,,"The area around Arab Street has evolved quite a lot over the years. It used to have quite a lot of character but in the past few years, it has changed, and not for the better. These days, it really is more of restaurant or what they describe as F&B (food and beverage) district. There are atill a sprinkling or shops selling Arabic clothing/goods.

If you are looking for F&B, go there but if you a looking for cultural centre for the Muslim community, you might be disappointed. There is a impressive mosque there but that is about it these days."
,,Great food and some really trendy shopping,5.0,,We ate here a couple of times and did more than our fair share of shopping - some great tourist stuff and also some trendy little boutiques and interesting young designer stuff - great time had by all. Also beautiful mosques!!!
,,Nice place,5.0,,"Full of good restaurants. Clean and nice place where you can sit and enjoy the sight of the Sultan mosque at night, which is wonderful"
,,Clean Bazaar,4.0,,"If you were dropped here not knowing where you are, you'd be certainly confused. You see carpets, rugs, shawls, fabrics and all other stuff sold at Bazaars in Arabic countries, but in a spotless surroundings.
Like everything else in this city state, this part of town is perfectly clean and neat.
A very beautiful Mosque is in the middle of the area. Very good eatery across it with Middle East food."
,,Such a let down for an Indian,1.0,,"Now I want to specify this let down was for a said Indian, because seeing these other reviews, I sense that for many tourists from different countries, this is a unique experience.

Now coming to why I wasn't thrilled about this place. Let's break it down to all the reasons why one might visit this place, and why not one of those reasons is a big enough pull for me.

Well, for one, the textiles, beautiful prints and nets and more, are expensive. We find such stuff in Indian markets too, if you are looking for it. The quality and styles might be different, but then, if you have ample time or the pocket to spend on such expensive material, it might make some sense for you.

Next, the lanes and streets. You get a feel of the place. Each city / country has its roads and houses built in its own unique way. But then again, if you are visiting Singapore as a tourist, you will get a taste of the same at another tourist site.

The food, yes, there are some interesting small restaurants. But then again, nothing you might not get elsewhere in Singapore.

The mosque, its nice, the highlight of this place actually. But then again, I have seen bigger, grander mosques.

Historical significance of the street / mosque : well frankly, that's something I don't know about, since I haven't researched it.

I felt that I could have better spent my limited time in the country visiting some other attraction."
,,Worth a few hours,5.0,,"A great area If you're looking for fabric and rugs or just a great place to visit for the colour, atmosphere and new restaurants and bars. Not far from upmarket Bugis Street."
,,Needs a recharge,3.0,,Lots of shops were empty/not in business and the atmosphere a bit dull. The architecture is very interesting and the history but it really needs some life!
,,Cozy places,3.0,,"The Arab Street was not quite like I expected (I had been in the UEA a few months before), apart from a few building and architectural styles, it didn't feel too different from the rest of Singapore. I was pleasantly surprised however by the car-free streets and the small! and cozy places to have lunch, or just sit down, have a coffee and relax."
,,"This is one of my favorite parts of Singapore, it's like a trip to Tangiers or some similar exotice place",5.0,,"An area so rich in history they give very detailed guided tours here.. Very old streets and very interesting shops and eating places. Walk along Arab Street and you can pick up a huge variety of carpets, shawls, exotic clothing, linens, fabrics, lamps, etc etc. The Mosque is amazing and really worth a visit. I really like eating Middle Eastern food on Arab Street and the side streets. You can spend many hours here wandering, eating, drinking, and shopping. I buy my favorite Batik shirts here which are amazing for hot weather."
,,Great food & textiles,4.0,,Well worth a visit to see the mosque. Make sure you go inside as very beautiful & peaceful. The street has some very good prices on textiles.
,,Grafitti,5.0,,"I spend few hours on Arab Street searching and then finally finding wall graffiti. The place has a mosque, eateries and pretty nice shops. Also tried chicken shwarma, which had more veggies compared to normal shwarma. Should spend some time!!"

Full of colour and culture
Unique shops and cafes
Great little bars and restaurants
Loads to choose from to eat - arabic, Lebanese, turkish, indo, Japanese, italian.
This is a great place to visit from about 4pm - wander around and get unique clothes; homewares and gifts."
,,Take a walk,4.0,,"First this I been here, nice place with beautiful old buildings, boutiques all around and a lot of food stalls and shops, bugis station should be the nearest MRT and 5 min walk (fast walk)"
,,Relaxing Stroll.,5.0,,"We had a short stop in Arab St, which is actually a walking street. The ambiance of the area is very relaxing. It was a nice afternoon stroll. There're shops and restaurants and a mosque. There's also a musuem across the street which you should visit if you're already there.

I wouldn't say this is a must visit in Singapore. But if you're like us who had been in Singapore for a few times already, this would be an option to visit aside from the major attractions."
,,Thoroughly enjoyed,4.0,,"Easily accessible, wide and flat foot paths. Great atmosphere. Lots of shops and dining options. Cheap tourist shops, exotic fabric shops, rugs and cushions to name a few. The mosque is stunning. Well worth an hour or two."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Stayed in a hotel in this part of the city. Quaint and beautiful area with little restaurants, cafes and shops. Less prominent than China Town and Little India, in a quiet, authentic and charming way. Well worth finding. Very pretty at night."
,,I LOVED THIS!,5.0,,"If you're a lover of anything and everything Dervish, this is the place for you! I was practically brought to tears when I entered one of the shops along Arab street that had Dervish ornaments and paintings and artwork. Having searched for these things for a very long time, it's like stumbling across a gold mine! Food around was also relatively good and pretty reasonable! On the other end, you find Kandahar street that offers some great Padang food. I loved the area, and Sultan Mosque was lovely and clean!"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,We travelled from China Town to Little India and could not believe the change in such a small area. Worth a viewing.
,,Indian Food and Market,4.0,,Shopping and bargains are easy at this place but I was surprised by the name of the area although majority of the shops/restaurants are from India.

,,Very Interesting Shops With Great Buys,4.0,,"There is so much to see in Singapore but since this was a place we had never seen we wanted to see it. Very interesting shops but we found the Arabic restaurants in this area had expensive menus. Of course, had to have the AWESOME coffee though:)
In the shops we bartered and found the prices reasonable. If you are looking for an unusable ""gift"" to take back home, you can find it here."
,,A great spot,5.0,,We stayed here for a night or two- loved the mix of cultures and foods - be aware that some of the more Arabic restaurants are expensive compared to the local fare- huge price difference (jet lag and hunger worked against us the first night and we paid 4x the price of what we did the next day eating at a place literally across the road!) So many beautiful buildings- the street art is great too. We were up early to explore (kids always up early!) and it was really special to explore the streets and alleyways when everything was so quite and shops shut- when I say early I mean 0900 am- not too early!

If you like Arabic food or want a taste of Arabic cultures this is the place to be. Prices for food are fairly average and not too expensive.

,,For a change of food!,4.0,,"We just stayed opposite at Parkroyal Hotel so visiting was easy, and after having mostly Chinese dishes for some days we went for another tasty food.

Some house trendy boutiques, arts and crafts and giftware. Further away from Arab street the laneways offer more traditional Arabic goods from Turkey, Morrocco and the Middle East. Here you can haggle over Turkish carpets, purchase some cheap Pashminas to take home for gifts, or enjoy wonderful middle eastern or Turkish food. The area is lively and colourful, the buildings are beautifully decorated and the area is enhanced with colourful pots with plants.

Each street is filled with lots of interesting shops for clothes, carpets, crafts and curios. Lot of Malaysians have settled there. We had lunch at Deli Moroccon, which is close to the Sultan Mosque, no air conditioning, basic tables and chairs. The owner Jamal is friendly and a real sweet talker, as we were scanning the menu, Jamal said he would decide for us. The food was quite okay, there were 2 dishes and 2 cokes, the bill came to 100 plus singapore dollars, quite an amount comparatively to the menu prices, when questioned he said it was 3 portions of each, it certainly did not look like 3 portions. With all his sweet talking we were taken for a ride. In another street there is AL Tasneem which is known for their tasty food. Arab street is worth a visit."

,,Persian rugs to the heart's content,3.0,,"If you want to learn a bit about how hand woven rugs are made, then this is the place for you. There are many small stores selling rugs from the Middle East. The sales personnel are generally happy to explain the intricacies of their product if they think there is a sale. These rugs won't, unfortunately, fit into your suitcase! The adjoining streets also have a great choice of restaurants and bars if you want to rest your feet. The Masjid Sultan mosque is off Arab St and is worth a look. Bugis station is the closest MRT station ."

,,Very Clean,3.0,,No special middle eastern feel here. Too clean and tidy. The usual tourist fare. Interesting to see the different cultures of Singapore. Jewellery seemed reasonable but didn't want to trust the quality as we were rushed and didn't have time to really check it out. I think it would be better at night

,,great shops,4.0,,Lots of great shops in this friendly neighborhood clustered around the lovely Sultan Mosque and the Malay Cultural Center. Be sure to try a shwarma and a teh halia (very much like a chai tea latte with fresh ginger in it - very tasty!) while in this neighborhood.
,,Great Place to find Traditional Halal Food,4.0,,"It has alot of cheap places to eat with traditional halal restaurants. You can find many types of Muslim cuisine (arabic, pakistani, malaya etc).

,,"Culture, fun & food... just a walk away.",5.0,,"If you are looking for the old Singapore - this is the place to go. There the quaint little shops selling perfume, clothings and antique. of course the iconic Sultan Mosque and The Malay Culture Center. The a lot of choices for food with a lot of hipster cafe for the younger crowd along the famous Haji Lane.

My recommendation is to visit in he morning where there's lesser crowd and you get the streets and lane to yourself and the weather nice. Most of the shops will only be open after 10am. So go for a nice stroll, then stop and enjoy cup of coffee and brunch and by then most of the shops would be open.

Yes, would recommend this attraction."
,,Late Morning Stroll in the Arab Quarter,3.0,,"I decided to take a stroll through the Arab Quarter - centered on Arab St., finding lots of trinket stores, spice stores and mostly cafes and restaurants - Turkish, North African and Middle Eastern themes and food. There are also a couple of mosques but the main one was closed to visitors when I went along. Interesting hour spent soaking-up the Middle Eastern atmosphere but left underwhelmed. Not as exciting as I had thought it might be."
,,One of the three authentic areas to visit,4.0,,"Any visitor to Singapore should have Arab Street on the to-do list, together with Chinatown and Little India. Stroll through the Arabic-atmosphere streets (Bali Lane is lovely) towards the Masjid Sultan and soak up the atmosphere."
,,Nice cultural stroll,4.0,,"Food! There're is a wonderful food vendor across from the mosque and cultural museum that sells wonderful sweets and the halia.

You may venture into shopping...if want to buy ethnic stuff. Else this is just an walk around the block and dine place."
,,Arabian nights with a mix of everything else as well.,4.0,,"I think it should be called arab streets as there is actually around three or four streets running paralell to eachothers and each has a different feel.

I spent the afternoon here shopping, eating and smoking shisha. It has a nicely relaxed atmosphere even though it is reasonably central. Family friendly and great for individual travellers."
,,A little bit of muslim Asia inside secular Singapore,4.0,,"Arab Street is not just one street but a small neighbourhood sprawling around the actual street. Here you can find spices, textiles, basketry items and just about everything else you find in any typical Muslim Arab city."

Though you do have to keep a steady path through the streets, as the vendors will engage you and have you in their shops in a flash!! And the architecture is very interesting, very much you would find in the old Arabic cities and towns."
,,A Taste Of Arabia While In Singapore,5.0,,"Arabian myths and takes always fascinated me and this scoop of Arabia in Singapore was amazing. I shopped for knick-knacks and clothes that are basically of Malaysian or Indonesian origin here. In addition, I was floored by the quality of fare the food shops here served. The kababs and pita rolls were delights as was the lighting and structure of Arab Street."
,,The best part of living in Singapore,5.0,,"...is that I get to hit up Arab Street whenever I want! From cheap and unique clothing to handmade jewelry to delicious Middle Eastern food, Arab Street can provide a full day and night's worth of entertainment for young couples, families, or visitors.

My favorite afternoon starts with a few photos of the beautiful mosque (currently closed for tours) and a roti or two at Zam Zam. I then spend time wandering down Arab Street and Haji Lane for some indie, handmade clothing - until I get too hungry and pop into Beirut Grill for a kebab.

Don't miss the night parties where they close down Haji Lane and invite in local DJs and outdoor bars - one of my best nights yet in Singapore. Love this neighborhood!"

,,For fabric hunters...,4.0,,"This is where you go to get cloth in meters. There are a few stores with retail clothing. Lots of gaudy polyester fabric shops...and then you stumble into 51 Arab Street and discover PURE SILK. There are 3 silk shops on Arab Street as well as a couple decent cotton shops. Food is one block away running parallel, either local fare or pricey Turkish tourist food."

,,interesting,4.0,,"I've never been to anywhere in the Arab world so this was interesting to say the least. As with everywhere else in Singapore is was very clean, and I felt very safe. It was interesting to view the range of products for sale and how they where on display with a beautiful mosque in the back of all the photos I've taken."
,,The Arab Quarter of Singapore is well worth the trip,4.0,,Arab Street is the jewell of the Arab Quarter (indeed some other streets are only really worth strolling through if hunting a quiet cafe or if heading to Arab St) and it has nice quiet shops compared to China Town or Little India and we particularly enjoyed the perfume shops and - which were on the next street parallel to Arab St itself - fabric shops in this area. It also rather amused me to see that the architect of the mosque was an Irishman - Singapore's multicultural history is impressive.
,,Lot of fun!,5.0,,"Restaurants, the Mosque, night bars and independent clothes designers are the main attractions of this area!"
,,Must visit,4.0,,Arab Street is a popular shopping street and a hangout for young and of all age groups. There are loads of shops that sell beautiful fabric. One can visit some of the best restaurants that serve local cuisine. You can also go to the mosques in that area. There are places where one can try the hookah as well.
,,Lovely aera to day around Bugis,4.0,,"The arab district around Bugis station is a lovely area to stay. Offering many budget hotels, you can appreciate many shops to wander around in the streets, choice of many local restos, cafes, some artsy shops and concept stores to visit (even cat cafes!)... Friendly area, pleasant and animated, close to the beautiful Sultan Mosque to visit and short distance by feet to the shopping and food malls of Bugis, Bugis Square etc."
,,"nice layout, good place for any time food in nice setting",5.0,,nice place to pas some hours and grab some food. love the environment with mostly ethnic muslim but a very international atmosphere
,,"A small happening place, food lovers will love this. Though not busy as other place!",4.0,,"Happened to visit this place with one of my senior colleague and on first look, simply loved it. It's buzzing with people, food, drinks, specifically Egyptian, Turkish etc. Though options are limited compared to other places, the food is genuinely good, tasty and you will long for more.

A paradise for food lovers and if you happen to be in this area and tired of the routine food, this place is a nice to try."
,,So amazing to see so much diversity in Singapore,5.0,,"I was so charmed and impressed by Kampong Glam and Arab Street. This was only my list of things to see and do in Singapore, and I'm glad I went here. I had a tea tarek here and oh it was amazing - was perfect as an afternoon tea break. Arab Street has great character - little alleyways and laneways add to the charm."
,,Pretty cool area for strolling,4.0,,"I only had a few hours in Singapore. This was close to the hotel, and I wandered around a bit to enjoy the late morning vibe. There were still a bunch of people out as the restaurants were opening up. Too bad I didn't have more time to visit. It looks like a great area for shopping, strolling around, and grabbing a bite of ethnic food."
,,What a gorgeous piece of culture!,5.0,,The atsmosphere was ambiant. Egyptian and Turkish culture with aromatic flavours from the restaurants waffered down the streets. We ate at DELISH and the food was to die for and so reasonably priced - went back to the area twice
,,"Shopping, Eating, Enjoying",5.0,,"Singapore city can be a little like an exotic holiday. You get on the train in a normal city mall kind of stop, you get off and arrive in what feels like a completely different country.

Lots of shop-houses make this place great for photographers, lots of arabic restaurants, textile shops and perfumeries, as well as the hookah smoke in the street make it feel like you are now in an exotic country.

In recent years, some of the streets have become the go-to destination for their small boutique style offerings, so if you are looking for bespoke leatherwork, original clothing, or housewares (and even now cool Brooks style bike parts) exploring this area can be like a shopping treasure trove."
,,Not that impressed,3.0,,I was expecting a souk like atmosphere with lots of great food and spices. Instead there were long rows of cloth stalls and a super trendy area selling international clothes and food. Not for me.
,,Well worth visiting,4.0,,What makes Singapore special to me are the ethnic enclaves. Everything is so different and it is just wonderful to stroll through the narrow lanes and soak up the atmosphere of these historic areas. Unfortunately my husband and I arrived early on a Sunday morning before almost everything was open and we weren't able to sample some of the the food that people rave about. There were any number of interesting looking restaurants with mouthwatering menus. Only one clothing shop was open where I bought a 'genuine' Pashmina for $10sg!! We were also disappointed that the Sultan Mosque we had heard so much about was not open to the public due to major renovation work. However it was a delightful district to explore and we would definitely return at a later time.
,,A stroll down memory lane HA HA,1.0,,Went for a wonder if it has changed moment? No still the same probably more stalls on the footpath etc.
,,What a nice surprise!,4.0,,"In terms of shopping I had more success here that Little India or Chinatown. I am a tall person and usually I cannot buy clothing in SE Asia, but here I found some wonderful shirts in 3XL (one of them, interestingly with a price tag of a German C&A in it ;) ) . The beautiful mosque nearby was unfortunaly closed for renovation. Lots of restaurants that I would love to explore next time."
,,My favourite shopping district!,5.0,,"Awesome little independent boutique shops, craft and textile retail at great prices, and a fabulous vibe. Go there!"
,,Individual Style,5.0,,"The complete opposite of the mainstream retai; outlets of Orchard Rd. Wonder down the narrow streets, lined with small colourful shops, selling new and pre-loved items.
I found this better than both Chinatown and Little India.
Easily accessible using the MRT, or a short walk from Little India"
,,Heaven for food lovers,4.0,,"On 11th hour we (me and my office friends) decided to visit Arab Street on weekdays, when we reached there, we found that restaurants / cafe (Persian, authentic Arabic, Italian) were already occupied with drinkers and food lovers. After initial round we decided to go for Italian, we entered into Cicheti (52 Kandahar Street, 198901), restaurant did not disappointed us, we narrowed down on 2 pizzas (POLLO: Almond pesto, shredded chicken, caramelized onion, red onion, fior de latte, parmesan & MARGHERITA: Tomato sauce, fior de latte, parmesan, basil leaves, for my veggie friend ), beers (Peroni). Cicheti (pronounced “chi-KEH-tee”) lives up to the high standards of authentic Italian dining, a menu that marries traditional and modern, impeccable service, and an elegant and cosy ambience. I would surely visit again."
,,A fanstastic Cultural Experience,5.0,,"Arab Street symbolises everything that is great about this city - Cultural diversity, tolerance and harmony! The Arab quarter offers a unique cultural experience for visitors. Here you will get to see and experience the rich tapestry of Arab/Muslim cultures from arts and crafts, clothing and food. This place is full of great restaurants and cafes. Sit in one of the cafes and hae turkish coffee while listening to the daily ""call to prayer"" chants coming from the nearby mosque. A little cultural sensitivity goes a long way. Please respect the local culture and wear appropriate clothing. I know Singapore is hot but tiny little tops and singlets with bits hanging out is not a good look and totally disrespectful and quite offensive. This is not Ibiza!!!"
,,It is a good place,4.0,,"The place is clean and neat as the rest of Singapore I think Alhmduelleah. The place full of restaurants and shops like gift shops. It looks like a cool place. However, the place is a bit more expensive than other normal places in Singapore. The place has a big historical beautiful mosque, the mosque is clean and organised and avaliable for tourists visits."
,,Fascinating atmosphere,4.0,,"Without too many expectations I visited this part of Singapore.bwonderful little shops, genuine atmosphere. I nearly bought another carpet (but I am running out of luggage space). I did find a lovely silk scarf, and manged to bargain enough to make me feel I got a good deal. Then we had a lovely lunch in a Lebanese restaurant."
,,Nice street to visit,5.0,,"A friendly street to visit with small shops, cafe & restaurants, away from the big shopping complex & Orchard Rd. Every time I go to S'pore I always go there and spend few hours."
,,Great to hang out,5.0,,"Living in Singapore, this is one of my favourite neighbourhoods. So much great food. A great place to wander and take photos. Get up early for some good light. Don't miss out on the Selfie Coffee."
,,An Arab feeling in Singapore.,4.0,,We visited the street in the evening and had dinner at a traditional restaurant. The mosque was lit up and looked very nice.
,,Cheap shopping,4.0,,"Aran street offers a variety of cheap shops. Although the area is quite run down, it makes a nice change from the up market western sanitised shopping centre Singapore has become."
,,Nice little shops and good atmosphere,4.0,,"Just a ""little"" street with little shops. Perfect to hang around and do some special shopping in the hazy weather on weekends."
,,Medley of color and food,4.0,,"As you enter the Arab Street, you are taken for a moment out of Singapore it seems and transported to some city in any of the Middle East. Fantastic medley of Colors, aroma of food and people. A must go and experience in Singapore."
,,Fun street for food and material,4.0,,"Need a sari? Or want to buy material for your next creation? There's a whole bunch of shops ideal for clothes makers and the like leading up to the very large mosque at the top of street. Food options are a mixed bag, from funky coffee shops at one end, even a Swedish restaurant, and more traditional Arabian fare. You're only a street from Haji lane, which had a very different vibe, it's far more modern retail, with some funky bars and cool places to eat. By comparison Haji lane is very much western, but a good way to spend an hour or so wandering through the eclectic mix of shops, and checking the street art. My family enjoyed it.
Only one more street away is the Malay centre, which has ethically created souvenirs and clean toilets, if you need them."
,,Cozy Area! A Must Visit!,5.0,,"If you like Mediterranean or Malay food, this is a must visit place in Singapore. This location has alot of Mediterranean restaurants. The restaurant interiors are Mediterranean inspired so you'll feel like you're in a different place. There's also a strip of restaurants near the mosque and the strip is beautiful at night ."
,,A Surprise,5.0,,Just down from Haji lane we came to see the mosque as we could see this from the flyer and the gold colouring stood out. The shops are one of the cheapest to buy souvenirs and the area is very clean. It is very modern and well kept
,,Arabian Singapore,5.0,,"If you are an Arab or not you have to visit the Arab street walk in this area buy stuff and eat there, you will love it there."
,,The Mystic East at your fingertips,5.0,,"Arab street; the very name suggests intrigue! A visit to Singapore is not complete without a walk through this olde worlde atmosphere!
'Emporiums' offer silks and beautiful cloths and tailor made dresses and suits, and there is a unique selection of Turkish, Persian, and authentic Indian vegetarian restaurants to chose from, and of course, the large, beautifully decorated Sultan Mosque. If you sty long enough in the area you will hear the Imam calling the faithful to prayer.
Across the road from the Mosque are two famous Indian restaurants, notably the 'Zam Zam' which serve giant prawns cooked in a delicious mild curry! Also worth a try, is their 'Daging Limbu' which is beef slow cooked over night in coconut and other exotic spices,"
,,good cultural experience,4.0,,"a good place for economical shopping, multi cuisine dining... a prefered location for a leisure evening trip."
,,Funky slice of Singapore,4.0,,"Singapore gets bad rap for lack of creativity, too much structure, not organic enough, etc. For the most part, I think that's a load of cr*p. However there are some small elements of truth there. Whenever I am feeling a little too confined, and I don't have time to hop on a plane at Changi airport and head to Thailand or Bali, I will drag the wife down to Arab street for a shop and bite to eat. Feels like a market bazaar in the middle east somewhere, then one street over you have a ton of original boutiques and outdoor watering holes, and a killer mexican place."
,,"Fine walking area plus speciality shops: fishing, textile, jewelry, etc",5.0,,"If you are looking for some fishing gear, here you can find more than eight shops, including scuba diving or professional net fishing; i got a lot of great lures and accessories, but I found the best deals on reels in another part of the town, at Fishing Buddy; I could not notice a lot of textile shops and malls with jewelry, spices, gems and other trades"
,,Quaint - but not all that much going on,3.0,,"Quaint with some independent shops of varying standards. All low rises and in complete contrast to the rest of Singapore.
Not all that much going on but worth a visit if you get bored of the air-conditioned shopping centres.
Lots of turkish and lebanese restauraunts etc"
,,Cultural stroll,5.0,,"Been here once, love the ambiance but it was a bit too crowded for me so I didn't spend much time.Will definitely come again some time in the future."
,,Exotic,5.0,,"Even for a local, this is like stepping into a time tunnel to the 50s. Yes some new joints have been set up but it has retained its old world charm much better than Chinatown. Explore every nook and cranny."
,,A nice surprise,4.0,,Headed down there after 8 pm for dinner after a taxi driver mentioned it earlier in the day. Unfortunately some of the shops were shut but we had dinner at Kampong Glam Cafe. It was chock a block full. We had no idea what we had chosen to eat but it was nice as were the drinks. The corner cafe was a very happy environment and the staff with limited English were great. Really enjoyed the stroll around the streets.
,,Beautiful pedestrian street in Kampong Glam,5.0,,Picture book street which is featured in all the guide books. Good selection of restaurants and shops. Near the Mosque and Cultural centre. There was a rain storm when we were there so we sheltered in a cafe and eat some local food.
,,One little street...,2.0,,"I read great reviews about Arab street and was really disappointed when we arrived there :-(. Yes you get a feeling of Mediterranean and Arabic worlds... But honestly, there is nothing to report. Apparently this street is appreciated by locals cause it's one of the only place that offers outside sitting for drinks and food."
,,"If you sit outside to eat, be careful of crows - they will come and eat from your table - they are very bold!",5.0,,"A visit to Arab street is a must in Singapore. It has fantastic places for shopping, eating, fun and busy night life, etc and at good prices! One can eat at a restaurant with the plush cushion seating like in a Arabian nights tale! One has to take shoes off and the restaurant is upstairs for that type of setting. Arab street is set with palm trees and cobblestones mimicking parts of the Middle East. They have stores like Jamal Kazura Aromatics selling perfumes with an oil base instead of using alcohol which is not allowed in Islam. One can take the MRT (rail) to Arab Street! Be aware of their closing times especially on Fridays which is their prayer day as well as certain times of the day when the mosque there calls their faithful to prayer and so the shops may be closed at certain times of the day. However one can find many places still open except for Fridays."
,,Loved this Neighborhood!,5.0,,"I really enjoyed going out to this neighborhood with my friend from Singapore. We both have connections to Abu Dhabi, and it reminded us a little bit of that home :) It is a great area at night - lots of bars and restaurants, I would definitely recommend. (Went Summer 2012)."
,,The Jazz Cafe,4.0,,"A true taste of Arab Land, complete with the mystical perfume shops, the quiet peaceful atmosphere around the Mosque, the delicious food......"
,,Enjoyable and Affordable!,5.0,,"I just love the little shops that line the streets. Shopping here for me was enjoyable because the store owners were so friendly, selections wonderful and the prices not bad!"
,,Great Place to spend an evening,4.0,,"Perfect place to feel a non-Singapore feeling of malls and sky high buildings. It has a lot of restaurants offering middle-eastern cuisines. Many by-lanes of Arab Street make it a perfect getaway for wandering. And if you happen to visit in the daylight, you can enjoy the graffiti in these by-lanes. Also it is open till 1 AM or even after that, so you can definitely go for a late night mean."
,,Good shops and restaurants,4.0,,There are some very good shops and restaurants here. I enjoyed my stay close by and visited the street several times for dinner and shopping
,,Arab street,4.0,,"Best shopping in singapore for Indian saries dress materials and laces . There r many shops like Altamoda ,for best gown materials .. If u r a designer than the world is there for your creativity .royal fabrics is another fabulous shop for beautiful sari material .you can get hand made batik scarves and carpets rugs etc etc . A real must ."
,,An evening out,4.0,,Went here to a restaurant for dinner. A lovely and bustling atmosphere. Again very clean and full of restaurants etc.
,,Amazing Place!!,4.0,,"My colleagues recommended this place and wow what a place it was. loads of Mediterranean cuisine options. streets are named like Bali street, muscat street etc. ample shopping options as well, i bought some amazing stitch able cloth pieces. at the end of one of the street the painting on the house really caught my frenzie."
,,Good restaurants,4.0,,A must visit especially at night for dinner at one of the many great middle eastern restaurants and view of the mosque
,,Fairly Price and Good Quality Merchandise Shopping,5.0,,"Arab Street is located Near Sultan Mosque. There are many shopping spot in this road. And the most important is the price. There are so many cheap merchandise with good quality. Beside that, you could take a walk and enjoy the view."
,,Little Arabia in Singapore,4.0,,"If you like Arabian Cuisine, this is the place for it in Singapore. The street is lined with Arabic restaurants. You can also find other Arabic specialties like carpets, fabrics and Arabic style clothing here.

On the cultural side, the street also has a Mosque and the Malay Heritage Center.

Worth a visit if you are in Singapore."
,,Arabic feel,4.0,,The lane as the name suggest has lots of small shops for food and shopping like in a typical small arab town. You can enjoy the food and shop around.
,,A fun diversion,3.0,,"A little staged but charming nonetheless, this street is worth a quick look for the cheap shopping (souvenirs, clothing, accessories), beautiful Sultan mosque and generally authentic eateries."
,,Just ok,3.0,,"If you have some extra time, it's an interesting diversion to walk down the street, but don't expect to see anything you haven't see somewhere else."
,,What a great find!,4.0,,"When we last stayed in Singapore, we booked a hotel in Orchid Road. While we enjoyed the holiday, the Orchid Road area is very flashy and expensive. However, this time we stayed at the Pan Pacific units off Beach Road, and would recommend this area for anyone staying in Singapore.
Our accommodation was opposite Arab Street, which turned out to be a great find. The laneways in this precinct are full of small restaurants, cafes and interesting shops. We ate at a number of the outlets during our stay, and enjoyed the variety of meals which were relatively cheap (compared to many other restaurants in Singapore). We often ended a day of sight-seeing by enjoying a cold drink at one of the many bars."
,,Lovely Arab and Mid-Eastern food!,4.0,,"We just spend a couple of hours for dinner at this district.
So unfortunately I can't judge the atmosphere and feeling around.
But I can tell that all the restaurants around are offering really authentic arabic and mid-eastern meals for a fair price and good quality.
Authentic atmosphere with all the shishas around.
Very cozy for a relaxing night, having some good dinner and afterwards some fun smokeing some shisha."
,,Enjoyed the walk around this lovely street,5.0,,"Beautiful architecture & the Sultan masjid is just too great to see. Lots of eateries, souvenir shops, arabian clothing and uhd (scents)."
,,The place to be for authentic Arab & Middle Eastern food,5.0,,"The place to be for authentic Arab & Middle Eastern food. Relax & enjoy your food in relaxing atmosphere, with Arabic& Middle Eastern/North African songs playing in the background. On a cool day, sit outside a cozy cafe & sip on your mint tea as you people-watch. Enjoy the view of the historic Sultan Mosque, & experience the solemnity of the call to prayer - the only mosque in Sg that is allowed to broadcast the call to prayer by the muezzin."
,,Atmosphere,4.0,,We enjoyed visiting this old part of Singapore. It has a fabulous atmosphere and if you closed your eyes you could imagine you were actually in the Middle East.
,,Loved it,5.0,,"My husband and I left the children with their granddad and headed here for a few hours. We loved it, it was quite a contrast to the slick, modern and shiny part of town our hotel was located in. There is a medley of independent shops selling a mix of one-off designer pieces, furniture, second-hand goods and quirky fashions. There are several bars, cafes and restaurants - all serving what looked like delicious food, nestled throughout. We were sorry we didn't get a chance to spend longer here, it was delightful."
,,"Arab Stree -perfect place for shopping, dining and hanging out",5.0,,"A fun filled evening can be spent at Arab street in order to enjoy authentic Lebanese food. A good place to hangout with friends for drinks and sheesha (now discontinued). During day time, one can enjoy shopping at the shops lining both sides of the street. Popular for its laces and embroidery work"
,,Interesting area full of unique shops,4.0,,"I visited this area around lunchtime. Quite a few shops were closed so I think it would be better to visit in the early evening. It was full of Arabic material/lamp shops and also a bunch of quaint shops selling cute little things. We had some Greek/Turkish food which was just delicious. I would definitely recommend seeing this street if you like Arab food or decoration. It only took about an hour and a half including lunch, but depends how long you want to stay."
,,"Interesting shops, bars and restaurants",4.0,,"Personally I think this is a good place to visit in the early evening, when it is still light enough to see the impressive 100+ year old mosque behind it and also enjoy the activity as the bars and restaurants get busy..... but also before most of the shops shut. If you like meze style Arabian food then take your pick of a lot of restaurants offering it.
Small area with a lot going on."
,,For a quiter stroll,4.0,,"Very unique, very little traffic and nice places to eat. The mosque was closed to visitors due to renovations, but I had a pleasant morning browsing the shops."
,,Arabia in Asia,5.0,,"A great place to spend some time, for sight seeing, shopping or for a delicious bite. Plan some time for this cute place."
,,A fabric wonderland,5.0,,"I spend a morning shopping here and got some amazingly beautiful wool scarves and pashminas that are not the usual street wares. I was also looking for fabric by the yard and there is an endless selection on this street, from sari fabrics to the most beautiful silks."
,,Libanon in Singapore,5.0,,"The mosque is really nice to see especially during night. When walking along the street in front of the mosque you will feel like in an arab country (Pakistan/ Libanon). Unfortunately, Shishas are now banned by the government."
,,Cultural experience,4.0,,"Personally, this is my favourite section of Singapore, with beautiful little shop houses and a large white, gold and black mosque at the end of the street, it's an atmosphere I have never entered before.
I recommended going at dusk (7pm) as that is when the mosque calls for prayer, sit and eat in one of the Turkish restaurants near the mosque and you can spectate.the restuarants closest to the Mosque don't serve alcohol so be sure to ask first if you are wanting a drink with your meal.
The road running parallel hosts what feels like a never ending stretch of carpet, lights, dress and fabric shops, worth a visit!"
,,Authentic!,5.0,,"If you want to get a better idea of some of the subcultures or see a more organic side of Singapore, pop by here. Walk through Haji Lane for vintage shops, cafes and lots of drinking holes! Try to avoid the more stereotypical ""expat"" places such as Blu Jazz (great music but expensive drinks!) and opt for places like ""Chevy's"" (end of Haji Lane - no frills place with great service and cheap beers!). For good food, head down to Kampong Glam Cafe where locals throng for some authentic cuisine at great prices (might get crowded at about 7ish). You could pair this entire stretch with a walk around Bugis area or Bras Basah (try to end at Arab Street). But if you're more into clubs and parties, this isn't exactly the place - more for people looking for some beers and chill-out (shisha has become limited in the area and far more expensive of late too!)"
,,Hip vibe and Lebanese food,4.0,,"One of my favourite areas of Singapore - dominated by the golden dome of the Masjid Sultan, but a vibrant mix of middle eastern food, carpet shops and cafes, there's always lots going on here, it's a happening neighbourhood. Come during Ramadan around sundown and see the locals flock to the temporary food stalls as they break their daytime fast, just hang out in a bar or enjoy Lebanese or Turkish food."
,,A cat petting shop on Arab Street neighbourhood,5.0,,"After having a free meal at the Sultan Mosque during the Ramandan I strolled around the Arab Street neighbourhood. Ho and behold I found a shop that catered to cat lovers. They have 2 ladies taking care of the 7 species of cats. One has to pay $13 to pet the cats for an hour. A free glass of juice or hot drink is provided The shop is clean and all kinds of gadgets and toys are provided to play with the cats. The walls are plastered with photos of cats. There were youngsters who went there to celebrate their birthdays bringing ballons with them, etc. I was impressed by the brainchild of a young lady who had set up shop there recently."
,,Great shops,4.0,,Most of the shops don't open early but are well worth a visit especially for cloths. I got some great hand made leather shoes for under $30. At the end of Arab street is the the Masjid Sultan Mosque which has free entry only open from 10 – 12 most days. No just a mosque a real master piece (currently under renovation July 2015). Arab street is a nice spot to shop becuase of the wide street and trees.
,,THE place to go for Halal Food,5.0,,"Arab Street flanked by Haji Lane and Baghdad Street is a network of lanes that is positively filled with quaint restaurants and shops. It is the must-go area for halal food. You'll be spoiled for choices as its got everything and all kinds of Middle Eastern, Indian, local and regional food that Muslims and non-muslims can enjoy. A vibrant stretch of street that starts with the historical Sultan Mosque. Must see!"
,,Great shops,4.0,,"Loved visiting here with my teenage daughter. There are lots of great shops, not cheep but full of lovely stuff we didn't see in any Malls. This was really worth a visit. The cafes looked great too but we didn't sample as we had just eaten"
,,You need to experience it by day and night.,4.0,,"I love the multi-faceted Arab Street locale. It's so different by day and night. Here are my favorite things to do. By day, walk along Bussorah St, Arab St and Haji Lane. Always always make time to pause and admire the Sultan mosque. Stop by Zam Zam restaurant for murtabak (not a fan of their briyani) and the old fashioned Singaporean bakery 'Rich and Good Cake Shop' along 24 Kandahar St. Yup, that's it's name. Puts a smile on my face. They make delicious kaya (local jam) swissrolls. In the evening, I enjoy the area once again. Haji Lane comes to life with the smoke, music and the laughter of the young. Zam Zam is still bustling and I stop at the 'hole in the wall' shop that makes cups of local coffee and tea. Ask for a Teh Halia (hot sweet ginger tea). Lots of non tourists stop here. This is where I love to be too. I am intentional in not telling you where it is. See if you can spot it. Drinks are made by two elderly Malay gentlemen."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"A walk through the district of Kampong Glam is like a slice of being in Arabia. Very attractive district with palm trees, toed walkways and small shops and cafes."
,,Gotta try the food here,3.0,,"Arab street os the street second next to the Haji Lane. It respects the naming with the Arabian vibe with the music and food around. I always pay a visit to this place whenever I am in Singapore just to taste the Kebab's from the Turkish shop. This is also a good place for shopping home decor like carpets or bed sheet. If you're not interested in any of these, its still an interesting neighborhood to walk by."
,,Great Place to visit,4.0,,Good Restaurants and Nightlife here. Not a place for kids after 7pm ish really. Numerous arabic and turkish restaurants next to the Mosque.
,,Turkish delight,4.0,,"This is by far the coolest of Singapore's 'big three' cultural centres. It has a more relaxed feel than Little India or Chinatown. It's also leaner and with less traffic, making wandering less stressful.

It also has a strong Turkish influence with eateries serving typical fare. Great for a vicous Turkish coffee and a sweet baklava!"
,,A great place to spend some tme shopping.,3.0,,"I was here several years ago. It is a great place to buy carpets. It is a small street so you can cover it rather quickly. The Moroccan restaurant was amazing and at a very good price. Anyone going to Singapore, this is certainly on the list of places to visit."
,,A lot of choices,5.0,,"Alots of shops, fabrics, restaurants boutiques etc. mosque, near to shopping centres and near the MRT stations"
,,Have a Middle Eastern feel,4.0,,"It's where me and my girl friend met a french guy friend and he took us a Turkish restaurant. Food are great. Best visited at night, but if you want a clearer view of the mosque, visit by day."
,,Unique street and lovely scenary,5.0,,"This is a must area to visit in Singapore, not only is the diversity pleasantly expressed, but the magnificent mosque highlights a delightful shopping street, with many terrific boutiques. There are also a few good restaurants here, We found a favorite Mediterranean with very exquisite food that we visited often. Be aware that Muslim cafes do not serve alcohol and respect their customs. Very pleasant safe place to walk."
,,Interesting and trendy,4.0,,"An interesting place to visit in Singapore. Although Arab street might not be on the top of your list, but it's worth visiting to get a feel of the diverse cultures. A lot of middle east / Turkish / Mediterranean restaurants along the street, and the mosque is worth going in. Around this area, there are also many pubs and bars, and shops selling trendy stuff along Haji Lane."
,,Will always be in my Singapore itinerary,4.0,,"Will always be in my Singapore itinerary. Good food, great restos, art, coffee shops, a little museum, souvenir shopping and at night, a great place to drink and catch up with friends."
,,chance discovery,4.0,,"A nice quiet street bustling with people and cafes, the highlight will be the mosque with the golden dome in the background, nice little cafes with Turkish, arab influences. Nicely done."
,,Very Hipster,4.0,,"This is an interesting and hipster part of Singapore, lots of textile shops with fabulous fabrics, and on Haiji St which runs parallel there are plenty of small boutique shops. Shops don't open until late morning or noon."
,,A Taste of the Middle East,4.0,,"This place offers you the most exotic material for clothing , tailoring and food of the Middle East . The mosque with Golden Dome will welcome and inviting . Women are allowed inside with the head s covered . The shopping experience is unique with a sense of the exotic lanes filled with the attractive pieces of bangles , handicrafts ,"
,,Put it on the list - so many little areas to explore in Singapore and this is one of them!,4.0,,"SO many dining options, obviously with a theme. A great way to experience some different foods in an authentic re-creation type setting. Fun atmosphere too. Worth a visit. Loved the buildings with the shutters too."
,,Beautiful street,4.0,,"Its a very beautiful street. Gives you a real feel of being in Arab world rather than Singapore. Restaurants around were nice and there were numerous shops selling carpets and other handicrafts. However, it seemed a bit pricy."
,,Similar to Chinatown,5.0,,"Area of Singapore, very similar to Chinatown but with a Muslim,/ Arab feel and vibe. Nice friendly mosque at the top of the street where everyone will be made welcome and an excellent food street with outdoor restaurants very similar to a marina in Greece, Spain or Turkey, but priced much cheaper.
Nice area of the city to chill"
,,Best place to eat food at super cheap prices!,4.0,,"Arab street is a must must visit atleast once on a trip to Singapore. This street has two main things: 1) Fabrics and other things to purchase & 2) AMAZING FOOD.

I visited Arab street to have the best FOOD. We had some of the best dishes here and it was truly a delight to eat great food. Also there were places for Hookah, though we did not try."
,,Arab Street,5.0,,Arab street is one place in Singapore which is full of life and is different from usual places which you see in Singapore. Food options are many with enough pubs and lounges to keep one interested
,,Nice place to eat.,4.0,,One place is in singapore to eat good tasty food and get some authentic hookhas. It also has many good clothes shop with traditional clothes but the hookah stand out.
,,Beware of Great Prices!,5.0,,There are a lot of things you can get for cheap prices here. I go there for camera accessories but there are other things you can get too. However beware of the salespersons they can be pretty persuasive until you can't even avoid losing your money anymore.
,,Colorful Buildings and Delicious Turkish Food,4.0,,"My friend wanted to visit the place where buildings were painted like arts/paintings. Luckily, we have a friend who has been working in Singapore for quite some time now so she knows the place.

We went to Arab Street and took photos of that ""Painting Building."" We strolled a bit and saw most of the stores there sell carpets.

We had our dinner in one of those Turkish restaurants. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get the name of the place.

The food was really delicious and the service was good. It was a bit pricey but we didn't mind since we were, after all, in a vacation. :)"
,,Best shopping in Singapore,5.0,,"This is the best shopping area in all of Singapore in my opinion. Here you can buy all sorts of beautiful muslin tunics, and materials, as well as nice purses and beautiful Rugs. I asked my husband to buy me a $12,000 rug which made him choke, then he ceased to bark when I bought just about anything that was not nearly as expensive. Old trick, it works all the time! Anyway besides great shopping, there are a number of excellent places to eat, and several Mosques which add to the lovely feel of this place. Love it here, had to revisit it on a second trip to Singapore to buy the things I did not on the first trip. Don't miss this place!"
,,Great walk around and food,4.0,,We had great Turkish food and a short walk around this area. If you are after fabric this would be a good place to look.
,,Lots of shops selling fabric for clothes,4.0,,"This is part of the Kampong Glam district.

The street is lined with two rows of shophouses on either side running the length of the street.

The ground floor shops are mostly occupied by shops that sell fabrics which locals but to make clothes. There are also cages and shops selling fishing tackles and rattan baskets and other wares."
,,"OK if you want to buy stuff, not much else",3.0,,"Shopkeepers were a bit pushy and weren't that keen on window shoppers or photographers. Don't know that I would bother with a second visit. It was OK, but I much preferred Chinatown."
,,Fabrics and Carpets aplenty,4.0,,"While I was neither a fabric or carpet person, it was nice to take a walk down the street just admire the sights and colours in the shops. You may be pressured by the shop keepers so just keep walking and smile if you do not want to buy anything from them."
,,lots to see,4.0,,"plenty of colour and culture to immerse yourself in, lots to see and people are all friendly, would recommend talking a walk down here if you get a chance"
,,"Rugs , crafts , fabrics",4.0,,"Very nice place . Nice shops. Very interesting. Many good surprises ,friendly people ! Worth the trip !"
,,Trip to Asia June 2015,4.0,,"Very nice neighborhood, you really feel that you are in the Morocos sucks. Very nice place to sightsee and to make some bargains."
,,Must see,4.0,,"We went on our own tour of Arab Street as we got to know our way around after a few days. It was good to see the shops without the glitter of Orchard Road. Lots of vendors standing in the doorway of their shops trying to entice you in. Lots of stores had beautiful carpets, stunning fabric shops"
,,Exepriencing a piece of Singapore past,4.0,,"Arab Street and its environs is one of the very few remaining sites in Singapore that let visitors experience what Singapore of the past might have been like. The shop houses here are pre-war and are now home to a variety of small businesses. Apart from delicious food, we found shops filled with fabrics, traditional Malay, Peranakan and Indian clothes, some shops sell batiks and batik products, and S. Asian crafts. A good experience, and a good respite from the other characterless malls that litter the city state."
,,A perfect place to spend an afternoon walking around and soaking up the Malay /Islamic culture and history.,5.0,,"A centre for Malay and Islamic culture and food. Traditionally a centre for people on their way to Mecca, the place has somewhat changed but it is still vibrant with many restaurants and cloth merchants and shops selling handicrafts and other touristy trinkets. The place is next to Sultan's Mosque and the Maay Museum"
,,Watch your step,5.0,,"I love going to Arab street to look at the wonderful fabrics. Last trip to Singapore, I went with a friend to get a sarong kebaya (traditional outfit worn by nonyas, Straits born chinese women). Bought a beautiful black embroidered top(not cheap) and silk sarong with a gorgeous crystal buckle to fasten the sarong. While walking along the street and looking at the wares, I decided to go into one of the shops and didn't know there was a small step from the street up to the shop walkway and tripped and fell flat on my face. Was so winded I couldn't get up. I was afraid I broke something but was fortunate I had a badly bruised knee, scraped elbow and wrist, bruised body. Very, very lucky. Knee hurt for 2 weeks. The shop keeper was very concerned and got me a chair to sit down while i got my breath back but not much they can do."
,,little arabic atmosphere,4.0,,"I love the buildings here. they are all old building that is well preserved. actually they are not necessarily looks like arabian building, but they definitely have that old town vibes. there are many shops selling fabric and clothes, and at the other side, you could find line of cute bar and cafes. worth to visit!"
,,Most authentic area of Singapore,4.0,,"So many people come to Singapore and witness the sterile sheen offered by the over-priced, highly sanitised cosmetic front put up by mid-town hotels and Orchard Rd. Spend an afternoon in Little India bargain hunting and getting a taste for the most vibrant and authentic community in Singapore and then an evening strolling amongst the chicha cafés (although do it soon as nargilehs are soon to be banned i hear) and Turkish/Lebanese/Egyptian restaurants and you'll get a feel for what Singapore could be like if it were just to let its hair down a little. A trip to Singapore needs a trip to Little India and the Arab Quarter to get the full picture."
,,Dinner spot,4.0,,"Great atmosphere for sure. Good meal at Sufi corner. the Turkish area is behind the mosque, nice small shops, great little leather bag shop down Hajib lane. Felt safe 😃"
,,Safe and clean,4.0,,"it is the Arab Quarter of Singapore and home to many traditional Arab retailers:Carpets ,Silks ,Suits etc It is safe and clean"
,,a place of Arab muslim heritage,4.0,,"A place to bring back old memories. All the shops and houses are mostly preserved, refurbished and spruced to look like what it is today. An interesting place for tourists as it reflect Singapore in the olden days. Several eateries around, many linen shops and food outlets."
,,Visit the smaller restaurants for quality and value,4.0,,This is a great place for grilled food and drinks. Make a note as this is a Muslim area so some bars do not serve alcohol if you are looking to drink alcohol and eat at the same time. Avoid the restaurants with lots of outdoor seating as we have found them slow and poor quality when full at weekends. Go to the side streets and smaller restuarants
,,a zone of his own,5.0,,"the unique feature of it is you feel that you are not in Singapore.
Start right from the Beginning of North Bridge Road. Walking down the lanes, you can visit lots of interesting stalls.
Lots of theme café opening up, you will definitely find one that will suits you..
unique atmosphere.
Looking also for a unique present? you can try haji lane.

the only sad thing that I am gonna miss will be the shisha that is banned in Singapore till the last supply ends."
,,Arab Street Awesomeness,5.0,,"First time in Southeast Asia? Mine too! First stop on a month long trip? MINE TOO!

Coming from Mainland China and visiting various places in Southeast Asia is certainly a a way to get a diverse sense of cultural norms and expectations. Singapore in general to me was like Hong Kong on steroids. Hong Kong's TST was very much that of Arab Street except Arab Street was more put together and smaller town style shops and restaurants. TST in HK was a place that was commercially built and run as a manufacturing plant really.

This place is a great walk in the day and not too sketchy at night. If you are a traveller staying on HK rd. it is not a long walk; it is also quite easy to find on the LTR and Bus system.

The food areas around here are amazing and the people are so kind. During the day (especially holiday seasons), it is extremely packed. Catching faith rituals in local praying areas is always quite interesting as well.

Speaking English gets you extremely far around here as the government has been making efforts to move the national language into that of English.

Be weary of overly packed areas, there many not be a huge amount of thieves but there are a bunch I am sure. Watch out at night if you are female especially, certain areas around imported construction workers are not the safest but usually Police are parading in areas that are not ""safe""."
,,Interesting commercial and historic area,3.0,,"Arab street is a very interesting place to visit. Unlike the very modern areas of Singapore, this small neighborhood kept its original character of a bazaar in an Arab city. Many fabric stores, at least one very nice mosque, narrow streets, and many restaurants that offer foods typical to the Arab/Malay heritage."
,,Great food,4.0,,"Great food. Go during dinner time. Good food, and make sure you find your self to Hj. Lane which few minutes walk for a drink afterwards. Its also nearby famous ZamZam restaurant."
,,nice to visit,4.0,,"Middle Easterner Street is renowned for materials material like silk, Indian fabric and Indonesian batik however I wouldn't know much about fabric yet my accomplice does. You can deal here till you are fulfilled by the cost.

For me strolling in Arab Street is pleasurable, noticing the fragrance from large portions of the halal eateries. For lunch we ate and involvement in one of the valid Malay cooking.

Around these territories is the place the Malay ethnicity live and the vast majority of them are Muslim. It is the focal point of the Islamic group. A considerable lot of the shops are impact by Muslim society offering supplication to God carpets, jilbab, Muslim tops.

The Sultan Mosque with its brilliant arch and minarets is additionally situated in the zone likewise in the region there are other intriguing to see like the Malay legacy. I think it was worth going to Arab Street."
,,"Construction, but nice shops",3.0,,"We saw a couple of mosques, but it seemed like every religious building was under some kind of construction. It was a shame since some clearly would have been pretty if not covered in scaffolding. There were several nice clothing shops and some beautiful fabric shops."
,,night dive,4.0,,"I recommend, go to the street in early night. then eat and relax at any cafes and restaurants."
,,Good to see,3.0,,"Came here on a part of our tour of the city. It was interesting but not much to see, everything seemed to be shut when we went in the middle of the afternoon so maybe it's best to come later in the day."
,,"Silk, silk and more silk!",5.0,,"This is the place to buy any type of material you may be looking for! The range, quality and designs are simply breathtaking and there are so many shops you won't know where to start!"
,,Nice at daytime but not at night,4.0,,Nice at daytime but not at night Arab full of stores for Oud and perfumes Textiles and so on It is surrounded by Arab and middle eastern restaurants and cafe ( some for shisha) But I do not like it at night
,,What a waste of time!,2.0,,"I went to Arab street because I had read on the Internet that I would find fabrics and haberdashery for crafting. I was very disappointed.
The first thing I noticed is that the only customers were white tourists, which, if you ask me, is not a good sign. The shops mainly sell traditional silk clothes and fabrics in strong colours and unusual patterns which I think cannot really be used in everyday life. I could hardly find any cotton; if you are looking for cotton fabrics, you should go to the People's Park Complex in Chinatown, on the 2nd floor.
In Arab street, they also sell carpets, but please be careful, because, as I said, it really looks like a trap for tourists, and I am sure that the carpets are overpriced."
,,Interesting but expensive,2.0,,Worth a short visit. Expensive. Avoid at night when the whole place turns into a drinking den full of drunks and loud mouths. Unfortunately the shops are closed in the evenings. Not at all impressive but if you are bored knock yourself out....
,,a nice neighborhood,2.0,,"Everything seems artificial and overpriced there. When you know the middle Eastern countries, you don't find this area to be very authentic."
,,Explore the whole area,5.0,,"The whole Kampong Glam area around Arab Street is very interesting and well worth a visit. There are lots of interesting shops in the traditional shop-houses, as long as you look inside beyond the tacky souvenirs. There are also many dining choices.Look out for the interesting wall murals too"
,,Good for look and see only,3.0,,"The area was interesting for a look and see only. The Sultan Mosque was nice, even if the people weren't the friendliest. There were a lot of alfresco dining places that seemed to be overpriced. The shop-houses sold mostly overpriced mass-produced items, but nice arrangements though. The fabrics shops were nice and colourful. So overall, great for sight-seeing. The Malay heritage centre was most impressive. And the alley behind it with Aliwal Arts Centre and Independent Archive & Resource Centre was definitely interesting."
,,Jem in the city,5.0,,Great place with many shops and cafes to choose from. Spend a day along Arab street and the neighboring streets and explore the many charms. Great place to buy gifts.
,,Nice food,5.0,,Try great food with very nice and clean restaurants. I recommend visiting it at night where you can site outside. Some restaurants offers shisha to smoke
,,A must visit,4.0,,"I was looking for things to do in an 8 hour lay over in Singapore that I hadn't done before. I had no idea why I hadn't visited Arab Street and nearby Haji Lane before, however they are well worth a visit. Loads of little shops to wander into and plenty of place to eat."
,,The place for textiles,4.0,,"If you are looking for textiles, this is the place, and well priced as well. Unfortunately the mosque was closed for renovations."
,,A showpiece of cultural diversity of Singapore,3.0,,"An interesting area to walk around especially if you are out to enjoy the cultural diversity of Singapore. There are many restaurents selling arabic food and shops selling arabic / islamic clothing items. Some shops carry interesting name boards such as ""Aladin's Hardware Shop"" (if I can remember it right), though not quite sure whether it sells the ""wonderful lamps""! If you further stroll along the Arab Quarter, you could see the imposing Masjid Sultan Mosque and the much smaller Masjid Malabar Mosque, along with an ancient Muslim cemetary. A worthwhile place to visit if you have the time to spare."
,,Nice,4.0,,"As a Muslim traveller i was excited to come to Arab st. The highlight for me was hearing the call to prayer fill the streets from the Mosque. It was the first time i had heard it in a public place and it was very emotional. There are many halal palces to eat and lots of material, rug and souvenir stores. The only annoying thing was every time i walked passed a shop the oweners pounce on you to come inside.
I just smiled and kept walking.

I got here via train and got off at Bugis which is only a few mins walk away. Lots of Muslims around. Had a nice time. Mosque was almost entirely covered with cloth as its going through renovations"
,,More than Muslim eateries and silk shops,4.0,,"In a city which is fast losing its cultural heritage, the low rise Arab neighborhood in the shadow of the Mosque, retains some of its Islamic character. With some outstanding Indonesian Nasi Padang restaurants, this is a pleasant area to walk around.
However, there is a sleazy side with spas located in many of the side streets.
Visit during the Call to Prayers, to soak in the eclectic atmosphere"
,,Interesting place to check out,4.0,,"Arab Street is an interesting place to visit in Singapore as, along with Little India and Chinatown, demonstrates the many cultures existing within city-state. There are some neat shops you can check out and try get a bargain. Easy to access via the subway system and worth walking around for a few hours anyway."
,,Awesome,4.0,,"Loved this place! Mum and I spent a bit of time shopping here - funnily enough she speaks Arabic and was trying to speak to people in the shops on Arab st but no one spoke it! All Chinese and Indian :)
Still a great experience - lots of Pashminas!!!"
,,Fascinating culture,4.0,,"Fascinating place to visit. Lots of wonderful food.
Watch out at the minute - the mosque is covered in tarpaulin and I understand they are renovating and installing a lift
There are some wonderful fabric shops, but I was warned that if you have something made you need to allow 15 days. If you are on a short trip, they will charge you extra to rush the job through, and the work may not be as good"
,,Nothing much to do here...,4.0,,"We found only three things interesting here: The Sultan Mosque, the food and the Arabian charm. Apart from this, there is nothing much to see or do here. You need less than 30 minutes to see the entire place.

The Sultan Mosque is the main attraction and its beautiful. The path opposite the mosque is lined up with some interesting eateries as well as shops selling wide varieties of silk, rugs, trinkets etc."
,,Only worthwhile when worship at the Mosque is happening,3.0,,Motorcycles and a world wide range of dress is worth seeing as the Mosque empties out. Shops seem to be tired and ho hum. Humidity does sap energy!
,,A bit dissappointing. Consider other places to go.,3.0,,"The main attraction in the area is the mosque and that is under renovation. There are a lot of shops; we saw silk, dresses (saris), rugs, and lots of restaurants. Other than that, nothing special. Your time might be better spent elsewhere."
,,Nice Area,4.0,,"Arab street is full of shops with silk materials,carpets, jewelery, many cafés and restaurants. Very interesting is the Sultan Mosque, and Malay Heritage Centre near the mosque. On the way to the Arab street through the Nord Bridge Road stop at Park View Square - fantastic building with statues and fountains."
,,Materials in abundance,5.0,,"We were in Arab street in February looking for tulle for a veil for my daughters wedding
and found it a wonderful place to visit. The shops were most helpful in referring us
to other places that stocked what we were looking for and helpfu and guiding in what
we were buying. The array of food and places to eat is also amazing and we dined
with lebanese food in the Beruit cafe...a delight.
Well worth a visit especially if you like materials or sewing or craft....
Rugs also in abundance."
,,Silk shop at Arab street,5.0,,"Today I visited a silk shop near Arab street. First, I really liked a selection of raw silks they had and could not stand not to buy some, which in my opinion the best I could find among all those silk shops. And when I was paying, I have noticed a thank you letter at the counter from the Queen of Britain EII! The Queen made a stop over in Singapore on her way to Austrslia in 2000, and wanted to buy some good Singapore silks, which she did from a merchant of that shop. He is a humble man, who does not put his merits forward. So there is no sign or ad near the ship. Unfortunately, I dont know the name of this shop, but I adviced them to put a sign that Queen shopped for silks from here! So they will be recognisable."
,,"Vibrant street for a walk with friends, good food, and sheesha.",4.0,,"My good friend from Oman took me to this place, and visited it multiple times.
You get good variety of Arab foods, and an ambience of their culture... Not the blingy UAE type, but more traditional and raw, which I liked. Outside sittings at restaurants really nice for late chat sessions.
Try the lebanese restaurant with the belly dancer, and the sheesha place across to it."
,,Like this area a lot,4.0,,Very suitable for day and night out on walking around looking to small seller shop and restaurants. I came here and try each of restaurants both for lunch and dinner.. very happy
,,Better than expected,5.0,,"Loved the ambience, cute shops and variety of cafes and restaurants. Colourful and vibrant. Easy walk from Bugis MRT, nice to get away from the bustle of major shopping centres."
,,Fun stroll for food and material.,4.0,,"We bought a few scarves, had some delicious lunch and just enjoyed looking at the huge amounts of colour and fabric. Would venture there just for the food."
,,Good area,4.0,,"If you have had enough of the big modern malls come here to Arab street . There are some good finds here that range from jewellery , clothing to carpets food and art. It still has a good quantity of old shop houses once so common everywhere in Singapore."
,,Great!,5.0,,"A great change from urban Singapore. Here, shops sell all sorts of stuff that even Mustafa can't sell. It's really rustic and set back in time."
,,Something around every corner to suit almost everyone,5.0,,I have been staying just across the road at The Park Royal and have visited here every day. If it's shopping for silks or carpets or looking for a bite to eat or a bevy or two you will be satisfied. I have taken to Haji lane to read my book and watch the world go by. I've yet to go inside Sultans mosque but had dinner the other night as the call to pray was happening and it was so peaceful. Really lovely and a must do if you get the chance.
,,COLORFUL,5.0,,"Amazing COLOR of shiny gold Masjid Sultan mosque, Turkish Rugs, colorful fabrics all on one street. Fabric in every color and texture. Nice quaint restaurants. Adds to the amazing diversity of Singapore."
,,Arab delight,5.0,,"Visitors to Singapore should take in account to explore the area around Arab Street. It’s so much enjoyable. Many years ago, streets such as Arab Street, Bussorah Street and Haji Lane did not have today’s look. The streets hosts many cool shops that would ecstatic anybody’s inquisitiveness it could be a day adventure peeking in and stopping by every single store and shopped. Shops on Haji Lane are very unique. Start you walk on Haji Lane from Beach Road to North Bridge Road. Take a right, and the next street is Arab Street. There are many fabric stores as well as carpet stores on Arab Street. Then walk back a block on Arab Street towards North Bridge Road and turned right to go to Bussorah Street where a street filled with restaurants There are restaurants everywhere, I love visiting the Arab Street area. It is small and intimate but definitely worth the visit. Just wander through the narrow streets and you can imagine what Singapore used to be, it has its own special zest. Lots of nice bars and restaurants in the vicinity and the general atmosphere are just great it’s really lively and friendly. This part of Singapore to me is a hidden gem. If you travel to Singapore, I highly recommend you explore Arab Street."
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,"We were staying at the Pan Pacific just opposite and spent a good deal of our time in Arab Street. There are restaurants to suite all tastes and prices, various boutiques, a great mosque and carpet shops.The atmosphere is great especially at night which is the best time to visit and have a meal one of the many restaurants. Highly recommended."
,,One of our favorite places in Singapore...,5.0,,"Love it here... beautiful colors... fabulous food... Haji Lane has some great cafes and is a great shopping street (small boutique shops)... love love love it.... :-)

Arab Street is really colorful and great for the tailors shops...

Well worth a visit - get here for lunchtime... or dinner :-)"
,,BUSTLING !,5.0,,"Go at night that's when all the fun is . lots of deals can be made here , also the sudden burst of life when you walk across from the main road into the Arab street ... Wow . Various Arab delicacies to be found here , try the lamb any where doesn't matter , amazing stuff. Nearby Muscat and Haji lane alsona must visit . on weekends recommend eating here then going on to Kampong Glam forms drink or two walkable about 5-7 mins . enjoy"
,,"Welcome to Inch""Allah city",4.0,,"Grat place. Like you are in Instanbul. many many shops who want your $$ but with plenty of time and haggling ,goods deals can be made"
,,Loved the Arab street in Singapore,5.0,,"This was a beautiful neighborhood. So many interesting old historic buildings, clean and lots of nice small shops and restaurants and souvenirs. We loved the feeling in the middle of the large city with so many new buildings. It is small and intimate but definitely worth a visit. Just wander through the narrow streets and you can imagine what Singapore used to be."
,,Arab Street not for material shoppers,3.0,,Arab Street was a disappointment for a person looking to be wowed by a large range of material. Prices were basically the same as Australia as were most of the materials. There were no newer materials which was my hope and why we booked a hotel opposite Arab Street. There was a lot of carpet and rugs but not my area of interest. There are lots of interesting food outlets.
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,"I liked the Arabs Street, we had a hostel for one night nearby. It made me truly feel as if I actually were in Asia and even though maintaining a bit of that general Singapore order, it had its own special flavour. Lots of nice bars and restaurants in the vicinity and the general atmosphere is just great. If you're a budget traveller, you should check out hostels in the area. It's really really lively and friendly."
,,Singapore differently,4.0,,"You think you are in the wrong country. Lots of carpet shops and almost bazaar style little shops. Only no hassle. In he surrounding streets are lots of cafes, restaurants, little shops and a community art centre, the Malay heritage centre and the Sultan Mosque.
A very different side to Singapore."
,,Loved the energy,5.0,,I could have spent hours wandering through the streets and bartering with the owners on beautiful fabric. I did go back and purchase some scarfs (made in India). When I walked away his price magically came down. - so I went back and bought from him.
,,"Peaceful, quiet area with loads of heritage buildings",4.0,,"This part of Singapore to me is a hidden gem. Great shops, great restaurants, history and cultural buildings on every corner. And it shows another side of Singaporean history as related to colonialism. Definite make this place part of your visit to Singapore."
,,Nice and quiet,4.0,,It's nice and quiet neighborhood with a lot of restaurants and shops. This is a place where the locals hang out.
,,Great place and atmosphere until they banned shisha.,5.0,,"the atmosphere is gone and fewer people go now. Some restaurants are closing too. The hadji lane remains a nice trendy street with small boutiques and many pubs and bars, but Arab street itself seems dying slowly. It is a shame as the place looked an authantic assembly of persian, arab, malay and turkish cultures all meeting up here. Worth a visit early evening anyway. Nice well maintained old simgapore houses."
,,Plenty of shops and cafes in old shophouses,3.0,,"Personally I prefer the parallel Haji Lane to Arab street, but that is because Arab St is a proper road with traffic flowing in both directions. There are plenty of shops lining both sides of the street, and a few interesting cafes. Worth wandering down as you explore the area."
,,Nice heritage singapore,4.0,,"Arab street is located about 10mins walk from bugis junction mrt. There are plenty of restaurants and shops there, especially if you looking for nice silk materials for women. The surrounding area is a nice walk to appreciate what singapore used to be like. .."
,,"Charming, easy going, interesting to visit and buy souvenirs",4.0,,"The area has a feel of the bygones and you can relax either at the many restaurants, have tea or Turkish coffee and puff at the Hookah (Shisha Tobacco Pipe).

Nearby stores offer clothing, materials and curios from S. Asia, M.East and Far East.

It is very confusing but a delight to absorb the diversity in such a small area known as Kampong Glam."
,,For shisha,3.0,,This is not the same as the Arab street in London. It is quite and does not actually have many Arabic shops as the name suggests. There is one cafe only that has a license to sell shisha after the band on Shisha in singapor. Shisha is bad quality here.
,,strolling around Arab Street,4.0,,"Arab Street is a 10 minute walk from Little India and an even shorter walk from Bugis Junction. Technically it is not just a 'street' but more an area. It is a mix of a Malay Kampong Glam, Turkish and Lebanese cultures. Plus there are some fabulous trendy clothing and gift shops along Haji Lane. Arab Street is where you go to buy your cashmere shawl, smoke a shisha, eat delicious Lebanese food and of course buy a Turkish/Persian carpet. The area is very laid back and the locals are friendly. Don't spend all your money in one shop as there are far too many choices and you'll want to have it all."
,,"Colourful, but kitsch, and overpriced everything",3.0,,"An interesting historic anomaly of Singapore, but wow, outrageous prices.
The whole region exists as a tourist attraction, filled with shops jammed packed with a variety of Vietnamese made knick knacks with Muslim or Arabic themes.
Someone is making a kiling, food is served everywhere, at outrageous (even for Singapore) prices.
My wife enjoyed the colour, for me, it was that in one street, I saw a brand new Maserati, a Lamborghini, and a lotus sprint (with a parking ticket). All parked in the street and owned by local business proprietors.... More than S$3million in 3 cars...."
,,Love love loce,5.0,,"Delicious food and delightful shops. While it is mostly for textiles, there a few stalls that sell some lovely trinkets etc. The ambiance is alive, one of the best places in Singapore a must see!"
,,Go for the shisha,4.0,,"The only place in singapore where i'd go for shisha! They do a decent job with the flavors and coal changes. Apart from shisha joints, this place is also good for local shopping for rugs etc. But being from India thats not what I was there for! Decent place to chill."
,,Arab Street,5.0,,"The street is quite busy in traffic but with good shopping place also. The entire road is connected to all the major places, You also can find all the non veg restaurants street side shops."
,,pulse of arabia in singapura,3.0,,"get down at bugis mrt & go towards victoria street towards raffles hospital,arab street is visible from there.
packed with lots of shops, arab street is a must visit place in singapura.u can get hand made fabrics,bags,different type of silks , carpets & last but not the least perfumes - kazura perfume shop is higly recommened to please your senses.u get a variety of options to chose at a reasonable price.
resturants offereing a wide chioce of arabic delicacies are closely located,some offering traditional ""hookah""
I felt arab street got some close ties with oman,as it got a sub street named muscat street & wall paintings showing different aspects of oman.

I highly recommend this place for a visit,specially at evening time to feel the real charm of street with the sweet smell of hookah in the air."
,,Muslim Mecca in Singapore,3.0,,"There is a good variety of shops and stalls throughout the arab quarter, with the pedestrianised Arab street being the main thoroughfare to the Mosque.

Along Arab street there are numerous shops selling everything from fabric to food and perfume to scarves. There are also some stalls selling tourist trinkets. The more interesting shops are off of the tourist strip, but beware, most restaurants and shops here have attendants at the front beckoning you in and they can be very persuasive.

The Mosque is stunning and allows for visitors however is not open all day."
,,Shop till you drop!,5.0,,"Please go with an empty suitcase if you sew your own clothes! The fabric here is unbelievable. Some reasonable priced, some not - however for the special piece it is worth paying a little bit more. And don't forget to get your coconut!! It is worth it in the heat. And I will recommend ""I am"" restaurant for pizza!! They are at the beginning of Haji Lane. Haji lane is worth a visit. Shops sell some pricey goods, but browsing is enough!"
,,Great place to spend with friends,4.0,,"Aarab Street has the best shisha in SG, we live in the neighbor therefore we went to the place every night. There is a restaurant call Zam Zam across the street from mosque. Best currry ever!!"
,,Night walk and chilling,5.0,,"Arabe strre during the night is quite nice, the shops are still opened if you feel like shopping and the restaurants and bars with middle east atmosphere are everywhere and are quite nice.

If you feel like having arab style food and sheesha thats the place"
,,great chilling,4.0,,"Arab street has plents shops can go here to buy french schiffons (but beware of the synthetic look alikes) it is also lined with arabic cafes open till morning:
Turkish cafe , middle east cuisine with great sheesha, perfect to chill at any time of the day and as it is open till wee hours of the morning u can cum here after club hopping scene

tabouleh located right on at arab street serves simple yummy middle eastern cuisine , quiet a few veg options , great for take away as well

Ambrosia,Magic carpet"
,,Just let me look!,2.0,,"I found Arab St to be very tiring - just walking past shop fronts was a constant hassle with being asked to come in and check out ""nice carpets"" or material, and then when I said ""no thanks"", continued to be asked was I sure, or to be pressured to come in. This happened for most of the length of the street!
Having said that, if you were looking for some really nice and reasonably priced material for sewing, this would be the place to go."
,,A great place for seeing fabrics,4.0,,"We enjoyed wending our way through the undercover sidewalk displays of fabrics, carpets and merchandise. Unfortunately the neighborhood Masjid Sultan Mosque was mostly covered over in scaffolding for exterior maintenance. There's an interesting high rise building nearby and we hoped to make our way back up the next street, Haji Lane and also get closer to that tall building but the sky opened up right as we were near the southern end of Arab Street at Beach Road. We were stuck there for quite a while then braved the wet to cross Beach Road and jump on a bus. We hoped to go back and complete our visit but ran out of time."
,,"Great place for souvenirs, cafes & more",5.0,,"Should go around 5pm onwards when the weather is not too hot and you can grab your dinner afterwards at the many cafes/restaurants. Lots of shops selling souvenirs, beautiful textiles and perfume. You can also go to Sultan Mosque for their tours and then walk over to the Malay Heritage Center to know more about history and a visit to the Children Little Museum. Just a preview, The Malay Heritage Center aka Istana Kampung Glam was previously the residence of the Sultan of Singapore. Yes, Singapore had a Sultan!

Arab Street has great atmosphere and architectural buildings all around. A great place to relax and chill, after the nearby tours. It's not too big an area and waking around is comfortable. If you go during the Ramadhan season, there will be bazaar with lots of food and goodies. However it's good to go to Arab Street whether day or night."
,,Taste of the Middle East??,4.0,,"Charming area. The Mosque was stunning, most of them in the world are, but there was a calm atmosphere around this one. Also very tolerant! Allowing non Muslims to visit. Pity about the souvenir shops just outside but some good shops in the surrounding streets. Plenty of restaurants and cafes around."
,,easy to find a mosque and halal foods,3.0,,"Arab street is just like another street, but the mosque makes it special since it's hard to find a mosque in singapore. There are some halal foods available and it's easy to find from MRT station"
,,Sheesha,5.0,,Its the best place to sheesha in the night it is very exciting in the night not recommend to go there in day light cause its to hot do check out ambrosia for a place to sheesha and club omg to club
,,Calm and Relaxing,5.0,,"We absolutely loved Arab street. Singapore is such a big and bustling city filled with such senses overload, but the you arrive on Arab street and you see the beautiful Mosque and it's so tranquil. Lots of beautiful textile shopping and the people are super friendly. We had dinner that evening and it was so pleasant sitting outside just enjoying this wonderful place."
,,To enrich the multicultural experience of Singapore,3.0,,Arab street in itself is not that special. It consists of several streets with shops that sell typical Arabic merchandise (tapistry). The Mosque is nice but hardly worth a detour. The best thing of Arab Street are the many restaurants and terraces that attract a huge and lively crowd at night. Visit Arab Street as part of your multicultural tour in Singapore.
,,Fabric finds,4.0,,"A good place to get fabrics, clean and easily walkable with nice shops and a few restaurants. We have not tried the restaurants but enjoyed the stroll."
,,"Textiles, scarfs, carpets... and cafes!",4.0,,"Great place to shop for cloths, scarfs & carpets, which are reasonably priced. Middle eastern foods are abundant in this area. There's a short lane in front of the Sultan's mosque with cafes that serves only 'halal' food (no alcohol & pork). Crowded towards the evening when weather is cooler. Not recommended on rainy days."
,,Great place to sit and chill out with friends,4.0,,"With so many places to just sit and enjoy a drink, it is a great place to chill. Everybody who goes to singapore and want to enjoy the night must definitely visit Arab street."
,,Try the adjecent street (Bussorah Street),3.0,,Arab Street is just another street in Singapore with traffic and some shops. Instead try the adjecent street that is called Bussorah Street. Here you can find a big mosque and there is no cars.
,,Good place to find halal food.,4.0,,"Awesome murtabak, beriani and lots more. Went there during Ramadhan, there was a market outside Sultan Mosque, selling food for breaking fast. Lots of choices."
,,Arab Street - Just one street in the interesting Kampong Glam District.,3.0,,"There are many reviews here for 'Arab Street' and many photos that are not actually of Arab Street itself but of the surrounding area, known as the 'Kampong Glam' District of Singapore.

'Arab Street' is indeed the main thoroughfare of the Kampong Glam District but in my honest opinion I think that 'Arab Street' itself is not the best part of Kampong Glam, although it does have some interesting Middle Eastern shops and fare. I think that the Bussorah Mall, Haji Lane and the Sultan Mosque (which is just off Arab Street) are far more interesting places to spend your time."
,,This photo is NOT Arab Street but Bussorah Street,4.0,,"Arab Street is a bustling roadway with many authentic Middle Eastern eateries, bars, carpet shops, fabric shops and purveyors of exquisite lights. I would strongly recommend that you also walk down Bussorah Street, which, as shown in the picture looks directly down to the Grand Mosque. Here you will find superior eating opportunities and, at the beach road end, some nice bars. There are of course several streets which are worth walking down which are part of the Arab area and as many have said, more authentic than Chinatown."
,,Too far from the metro on a hot day,2.0,,"Though I probably got off at a less convenient station for access, I was really disappointed that ""Arab Street"" is basically 2 blocks long. It was not worth the 15 minute hike from the MRT station... I was drenched in sweat and completely unimpressed that all there was were a handful of restaurants and a bunch of fabric shops. I do some sewing in my free time, so I can appreciate the quality of fabrics were nice but it just wasn't worth the trip for me."
,,Anyone for fabrics?,5.0,,"Walk down from Bugis Station, through the markets (which are a treat in themselves) across Rochas St to Arab St.

Here you will find fabric shops that will simply stun you. The fabrics range from hand embroidered silks and chiffons, to cottons, Italian silks and everything in between. They can recommend tailors on Orchard Road if you want to have something made up - takes about 1 - 3 days depending what you want.

There is also a carpet shop there worth going in with handmade carpets, rugs, cushion covers and table runners - very reasonably priced too."
,,A different part of singapore,4.0,,"I enjoyed my visit to the arab street, to see many different fabrics and carpet shops, and small restaurants and cafes, I found a mix of arab, turkish, persian, and indian food. and the outside seating areas of the cafes were great for relaxing and enjoying and different night life."
,,Not impressed,2.0,,This place wasn't for me. It was so hot made it unappealing to look on every shop. Very busy. Shops I did look at were full of junk.
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"Just an area of Singapore where there are a lot of Arab stores, restaurants, and other businesses catering to the Arab population."
,,Authentic,4.0,,The most authentic of the precincts. China town shopping was same same as was Little India. Bougis Street is definitely the place for cheap markets with variety.
,,Lovely area,4.0,,"We stayed in a hotel very close to here so visited here many times on our trip to Singapore. It's a very nice area with a beautiful mosque. There are also some of the best restaurants in Singapore close by.
Al tanseer is a must try!!! They have the nicest murtabek (we tried the deer one) and the staff are lovely! They went out of their way to let us try other things and were so friendly, this is one of my favourite areas in Singapore."
,,Middle-east in Singapore,4.0,,It gives you a modern insight about the middle east's cultural heritage staring from tge building structures to the street shops
,,Make sure to also visit Haji Lane!!,3.0,,The Campong Glam area is definitely worth a visit for pictures of the buildings and Mosque. Make sure you make an effort to visit Haji Lane for fantastic boutique and vintage shopping as well as tea rooms and cafes - we were there hours!
,,Not actually on Arab St!,4.0,,The actual street is one over from Arab St- lots of little souvenir places and eateries. Stunning at night!
,,Nice place,4.0,,"When I stayed in Singapore, sometimes I went to Arab Street with my friends, because in Arab Street there are some Arab food restaurants.
Among them I had one favorite restaurant, even I went to the restaurant with my friends, we did not need to pay much money and taste of the foods was very good !
If you stay in Singapore, please go to Arab Street with your friends or family to have Arab foods."
,,Great for fabric,3.0,,Beautiful fabrics but I didn't need fabric. Looked like things could be lively in the evening but in the afternoon there wasn't anything to do.
,,fascinating!,5.0,,"Nice place to eat, to pray, and to hang out. Nicely built and organised. This definitely is a must place to visit when you are in SG."
,,back in middle east,5.0,,im back in saudi with arabic food everything good and very nice. one place i go back when singapore.
,,Cultural n interesting,4.0,,Home to many textile shops unique to its name. At night to many pubs n eateries along its lane. You can always find some historical titbits unique to the island history.
,,Quaint Street with a lot of character,4.0,,"In this part of Singapore, you'll probably feel that you are not in Singapore! Definitely pay a visit when you get the chance. I just passed through this street going from my hostel to the MRT station, to make a more interesting walk. Lots of stores and unique products for sale. Didn't get a chance to try the food, but lots of choices and during the evenings, people sit outside and enjoy people watching :-)"
,,So lovely,5.0,,"Street full of character with shops selling rugs, carpets, fabrics and linens. Shop owners want to sell but not in an overly aggressive way. Street is a little gentrified but quite pleasant in contrast to little India which is more a rawer experience. The whole area was lively, full of colour and eastern flavour. Can't wait to go back to purchase scarves, cushions and tablecloths. A delight."
,,Arab street Singapore,5.0,,"We had a lovely afternoon visiting this area. I bought some beautiful perfume and nice jewellery. We found a lovely restaurant for lunch and enjoyed the local fare. The best part for us was that there was no traffic. The main streets are for pedestrians. Not for cars. We were sent to a local Indian tea shop. It was a tasty brew and made in the traditional Indian style by a lovely old gentleman. Well worth a look and some shopping. Go and have a wander around, enjoy the ambience."
,,"Food,sheesha and coffee",4.0,,Nice place to hang around on weekends. Lots of places to try middle eastern food. Very vibrant on weekends. You can shop here in morning but bit expensive compared to bugis. Just take a sheesha and sit outside to-do people watching. Food price is affordable.
,,A cultural experience,4.0,,Visits this precinct which leads into the Malaysian precinct including Turkish restaurants. A good 4 hours well spent. All shops seem to have similar goods but lots of fun so don't miss.
,,"Vibrant, colourful and exciting",4.0,,"Love the textile shops, bought lots of material and pashminas at bargin prices. We enjoyed haggling with shop keepers, who themselves expect it up to a point. Give it a go! There are lots of places to eat, we ate lunch at a place called I AM, which had a lot of local clientele so knew it would be good. Lovely food, very popular as people were queuing in the street. We visited on a Sunday so come out from 11am onwards as it will be quiet and go for lunch just after 12pm.

Lots of alleyways just behind Arab Street hiding quaint shops and bars, so take a good look. The Mosque is a lovely sight and right behind it are lots of bigger restaurants and more shops.

The only downside is the lack of signs of public toilets or public toilets for that matter. We used ones in some of the bigger restaurants. When you go in to a restaurant ask them 1st about toilets especially of you have young children with you as we did.

Loved the place, would love to try it in the evening."
,,Fun Friday,4.0,,We are a family of 6 (kids 15 - 24) and we had seen Arab Street on a TV travel program so thought we would look it up. It really is a fun street with quirky bars and restaurants. Lots of local which is always a good sign. The food range was vast and all in all pretty cheap
,,Shisha In Arab Street,4.0,,It was an amazing experience for me.I had a shisha on the street.Lots of restaurants and bars offering Arab as well as many different cuisines.The street is full of life.If I go back to singapore again then surely I will visit again.
,,Walked though and left,3.0,,"Living in the middle east I suppose the expectations are higher when visiting such areas. Was not that impressed with the restaurants or shisha bars, had a brief walk around and went else where. Little tacky in my opinion."
,,Good Food,4.0,,We got in late and our hostel was close to the Arab Quarter. We wandered down to find many restaurants open late (on a Wednesday night). We had a lovely time wandering the street. The vendor shops weren't open and we wish we would have had time to go back during the day.
,,Good restaurants,4.0,,Enjoyed the lebanese food. Place was neat and clean... not expensive. Felt portion size was less compared to dubai
,,Beautiful fabrics,4.0,,"So many shops with so many beautiful fabrics. Not cheap, and you have a shadow following you from the moment you enter each shop. But still some fine quality textiles."
,,"Great atmosphere, good cafes and restaurants",4.0,,I really enjoyed exploring this area of Singapore. There were interesting shops and great cafes and places to eat. We did go in the morning however and it was quiet and not everything was open. I would encourage people to go in the afternoon/ evening. I preferred this area to Little India which we went to afterwards.
,,So good we kept going back,5.0,,"Wonderful shops, Fantastic restaurants and a hive of activity. Singapore is an extremely safe city and Arab Street is no exception. Shopkeepers are warm and friendly and the shops themselves are interesting. Unique, inexpensive items allow you to find a bargain, unlike other areas in Singapore.
Well worth visiting the whole area well as some beautiful shops feel like galleries and are tucked away."
,,Different and interesting,5.0,,"Recommended, and better that little China. The colours of the lane ways. The awesome food experiences. The kerb side Hookah smoking culture. Wonderful."
,,Arab Quarter,4.0,,"One of the great things about Singapore is you can feel like you have visited lot of countries in one afternoon. Arab Street lets you visit (how I imagine) the middle east. There are lots of specialty fabric stores and the main street is a bit predictable, but take the time to explore some of the back streets and try the amazing food. It is great value and from my perspective, deliciously exotic."
,,Halaal food all the way,5.0,,"As a Muslim, i need halaal food and Arab Street provides all I need. Not only halaal, the food also delicious and value for money"
,,Must visit for Muslim tourists,4.0,,"This was one of the first areas my Singaporean friend showed me. Being a Muslim, I wanted to know where the halal food was located. We passed through the Sultan mosque which is quite beautiful. You will find many halal restaurants around the masjid. There are plenty of souvenir shops as well. It was not far from the Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen where I stayed for 4 nights."
,,I Live Here,5.0,,"This is the best home in Singapore. The daily sightings of palm trees, diverse middle eastern culture make you forget that you are submerged in a concrete jungle. All kinds, as in ALL kinds of food from sushi to mexican to pho can be found."
,,Textile & crystal paradise,5.0,,"you could find most of the things related to arabic in arab street not just arabic related items there is those shop houses which sell local designer clothing, bags & shoe. There is few cafes around the corner too its nice to sit there relax and drink coffee. If you are looking for textile you must go arab street they have tons of textile with different print and the quality is good price wise is average. Crystal too. they have all type of crystal from big to small & many different color, shape for you to choose. must visit place when you are in Singapore."
,,Just an ordinary street.,2.0,,Just an ordinary street. Nothing much going on and to see except for the Sultan mosque. Saw few restaurants on the side.
,,A definite must do in Singapore.,5.0,,"I LOVE ARAB STREET for all things Turkish Arab street is a killer destinations, food, shopping, golden mosques (did I mention food) you cannot visit Singapore without a trip here."
,,An Interesting Aspect Of Singapore.,4.0,,"Have been visiting Singapore since 1978 and had never set foot in the Kampong Glam area. Glad we did as the area is colourful and surprisingly Arab free. There are plenty of food areas, trinket sellers and carpet vendors but overall a well presented area and significantly different from most of Singapore. The Mosque is an iconic structure and sets the scene from the distance as you approach from Bugis MRT on foot. Typical of Singapore tourist areas there are plenty of advisory signs letting the visitors know what's going on in various locations. Close by is Little India and the famous Bugis Street shopping."
,,Lovely,4.0,,I loved this place for the livelihood of it. If you are looking for nice halal food you can go here. Yes it is a bit expensive but hey all of singapore is like that!
,,Nothing special comparing to anothe street,2.0,,"Yes. If you has come to another street, place, pagoda and temples from around singapore before, dont bordering come to this place.
Beside the church, there is no thing else to looking for, the street is quite sad and boring.
Ah. 1 thing. 1 come in daylight, dont know what the night look like here"
,,Not much going on,3.0,,"Arab Street itself is not so special. There really is very little going on. There are a few restaurants, but actually, better ones can be found on the streets either side of it. Muscat Street, which runs parallel, is more picturesque and has better eating options."
,,Nothing to see,2.0,,"Except for the Sultan Mosque there was nothing else to see. The shops were mostly tailors, and nothing outstanding."
,,Mouth watering,5.0,,I had steak and let me tell you it was the most deliciously made steak that I had ever eaten. The dominoes sells some really tasty pizzas too
,,"Lovely place, doesn't feel like SG",5.0,,"This place has a different feel. You hear different languages and the shops here feel different too. While you are here, check out a popular local coffee shop Kampung Glam Cafe at 17 Bussorah Street."
,,Lovely place to visit,4.0,,It is not like downtown in Amman but you feel like you are in middle east. Nice mosque and a lots of shops with Arab products .There is also somes restaurants.What we liked about was most of the streets there are named after capitals of middle eastern countries. Don't miss Arab street in Singapore. Great place.
,,Nice Middle-Easter touch,5.0,,"Recommended 100%. Walk along the whole neighbourhood, there's lots of different shops offering from merchandise to food and drinks. It's not too big but It will take you a few hours to see around."
,,Living history,5.0,,"This place encapsulates the history and culture of my family, heritage and creed. Even though it is peppered with modern interpretation of what a 'hippy' 'artsy' hub should be for backpackers and other tourists, for a local like me, this place is where Islam must beat loud and strong. I hope the Islamic nuances of the place will be cherished, preserved and continue to shine for time immemorial."
,,A touch of the exotic.,5.0,,"Love this street. Beautiful fabrics, food and perfume oils. Exotic shops, lovely people. One of my favourite go to in Singapore."
,,nice place to get a drink with frineds,4.0,,A nice place to get a drink or try to smoke shisha here with friends at night. You can also go to Haji Lane in the morning to see some cool graffito art.
,,Not this street but the adjacent lanes are exciting...,4.0,,"To get here nearest MRt would be Bugis Street but after that also its a 10minutes walk.

Arab street isn’t particularly of great interest for tourist however the adjacent streets are stimulating.
The magic of the mass begins late evening and is very fascinating to see the young crowd enjoying in their own way.

There are lots of Arabic food restaurant but surprisingly not all are Halal. Very few Halal restaurants. People Smoke Sheesha and the streets are vibrant past midnight as well. Restaurants shuts after 1 o clock in the morning.

The lanes are very clean and beautiful set up with trees."
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,"This place is totally different from the modern Singapore looks . Sitting in one corner while walking by the road you will be amazed with the beautiful sculpture and surrounding . Mosque looks beautiful surrounded by huge trees and on the road side there are very good and famous restaurant - Turkish are quite famous.
Good place to shop and bargain too !!"
,,Great area,5.0,,"Come here to experience the sounds and smells of a truly vibrant working area. We enjoyed it here and visited various Mosques, Haji and Bali Lanes. Definitely a must do on things to see whilst in Singapore."
,,"Nice shops and restaurants, great for buying luxurious fabrics",4.0,,"Great to visit this district when you want to buy luxurious fabrics or Arabic accessories or clothing. Great variety of restaurants, including Turkish."
,,Worth a walk through,3.0,,Lots of fabrics. Worth a walk through just to see the Mosque! I prefered Little India and China Town! The side streets are worth a walk down too! Haji lane being the most interesting of them.
,,Try the food!,4.0,,Go to try the food if you like spicy!! It was neat to walk around and experience the Arab culture and food.
,,"Arabic foods, Fabric, Glassware - Aladin type shops!",4.0,,"First of all do not forget to enjoy the Arabic food before starting your street journey. Do not expect high level restaurants, but there are nice places where you can experiment Arabic food like Kubus. Avoid the mosque time (Fridays 12 noon), most of the shops are closed for prayers.
down of the road you can see nice arabic coffee shops, curry powder shops, aesthetic medicine shops, perfume shops, oil shops and many other boutique shops.
There are lot of by roads, some roads are filled with silks, fabrics and cotton. and some lanes are filled with glassware; you can find nice glass carvings, colored glass windows and etc. and there is another lane for carpets. you can experience shisha too.
worth to roam around. nice experience."
,,Other better streets in the Arab District,3.0,,"Arab Street seems to get more publicity than all the other streets in the Kampong Glam / Arab District. I urge you to investigate the other little streets nearby. Shops along Arab Street are nearly all textile shops. Just one street on from here you will find fabulous restuarants, galleries and quirky boutique shops. The pedestrianised Bussorah Street leading up to Sultan Mosque is particularly good. A lot of photos on this review aren't actually Arab Street."
,,Not worth it unless you like textiles,2.0,,"Arab street fast majority are same, same but same textile, silk arabic clothing simple stores. You hardly even find nice appealing arabic restaurants. Haji Ln street next to Arab street has more variation with boutiques, little bars and hidden coffee house shop Wonderland. Take a coffee and move on Singapore has so much more to offer!"
,,"Fabric, Fabric, Fabric",4.0,,"You can find anything in Fabric ranges here. Hawker style, but they take No without a bother. You are welcome to brouse the shops, they are all very similar in look style and price, but as a sewer it was great to check them all out. Minimum is usually a Metre, Cottons 12 SGD (less than half for the same quality in Australia.) Cottons, Silks, Batiks, Laces, Amazing Colour and Ranges from Moda etc."
,,Worth a look,4.0,,"Some good quirky shops.... Arab street is primarily textiles however if you yo to the next street over you will find some amazing eateries all primarily halal or Turkish food.... There s some funky trinket shops also....
The Mosque in the area in amazing... The oldest in Singapore...
My wife and I have travelled here many times and for some reason never got to this area.... We will definitely come back here again..."
,,Good for a short visit,5.0,,Unless you're really in to buying materials and other middle eastern knick knacks you'll only need half an hour or so here. It's interesting to walk down the side paths and see the architect of the buildings.
,,Kinda fun,3.0,,Lots of interesting shopping and restaurants. Well worth an afternoon of your time. I would go here if I had already seen the other major attractions.
,,Good to roam around,4.0,,This is a nice place with nice view. It was a hidden gem in Arab street. You can take mrt to bugis and walk around 10 min to reach here.
,,Lovely Neighbourhood,4.0,,"Arab Street is famous with its Sultan Mosque (Masjid) and you can see it from a distance. The neighbourhood itself is clean and several shops selling Islamic goods. Some people may look everything Arabian, but actually most are closer to Indian and Malay culture. For example, clothes, shirts, fabrics, shoes, bags, jewellery, accessories, etc. Not many typical Arabian goods here, except for the perfumes which are usually non-alcohol based.

Food here is attractive and you can choose from Malay food (some are actually Indonesian food, not Malaysian), Indian food, Mediterranian food, Turkish food, even Lebanese food. The prices are average-to-expensive. Not quite cheap. They don't provide non-halal food. So don't expect to find beer and alcohol here. But these can be found on other restaurants near the neighbourhood.

There is also a book store here, selling Islamic books, with a very nice interior.

I was quite dissapointed as I was expecting to buy some Arabian souvenirs. But it wasn't easy to find. Perhaps some stores surrounding Arab Street. But not in the Arab Street.

Some shops are quite confusing. Selling camera/ photography and cell phones?

As for the Sultan Masjid itself, there is visiting hours. Tourists are not allowed to enter during praying times( around 05:30, 13:00, 16:00, 19:00 and 20:00 every day) and during Holy Friday Prayings (If I'm not mistaken the schedule, from 09:00 till 14:00). The friday praying itself is scheduled from 12:30 till 14:00.

The nearest MRT station is Bugis. Quite far from Arab Street. So you better prepare yourself with drinks, comfortable shoes, and umbrella."
,,Another good place to explore,4.0,,"Arab Street is another good place to explore like Chinatown. Lots of shops, cafes, etc. Lots of activity in this area."
,,Vibrant hub,4.0,,"Hopping off at Bugis, a short walk saw us enter Arab Street and its hustle and bustle. Quaint little bars and delightful eateries make for a pleasant time in this little corner of Singapore."
,,Arab lifestyle,5.0,,"The whole area design follow Arab Construction . So easy to come here by public transportation (Mrt , bus , taxi). We love to walking on this street."
,,so different to anywhere else,4.0,,"This was a late entry on our itinerary as we were actually heading to Haji street and Bugis which is nearby. There are lots of shops selling the most amazing materials, lots of nice coffee shops, small gift shops which are quite different to those elsewhere in Singapore and tiny interesting restaurants.Not forgetting the really picturesque mosque at the top of the street. Would love to go back in the evening where I'm sure it will be a great place to eat"
,,Something I didn't expect,4.0,,"A city tour I went on dropped us off in the area and I'm glad it did. Not only will you have the chance to view the lovely mosque (great photo opportunity looking at it from down the street) but it also allows you to get a different flavour of Singapore. This Arab quarter is so different from so much of the surrounding city state it is a nice place to not only enjoy browsing the shops but also to take the time to grab a bit to eat. There are some very nice restaurants along the street and their touts are terribly polite by many South East Asian standards.

Highly recommended for a quiet saunter along."
,,"Engaging area, quality products",4.0,,"Not far from Bugis, so combine the two if you have the time. Intersting area with a variety of shopping and plenty of very nice fabrics if you are into that sort of thing. Bought some (nice but plain) shirts there, lovely cut and material, and bigger sizes available readily. Also bought some camera gear, dealer happy to haggle a bit and give a good deal. (Accessories not Cam/Lens).

Really liked the area and after looking around you can pop into the nearby large food hall (Albert ?) near Bugis which has a great array of food. It's busy at lunch time, so tables are hard to get !!!

Two bus routes leave the front of Bugis and it's only a few stops to Little India if you want to round out the day."
,,Perfect for dinner,5.0,,One of the best places to a nice dinner outside! With the mosque in the background its just great to sit there relax and eat some oriental foods....
,,Pretty street,4.0,,"A pretty little street with a lot culture to see. We took a rickshaw at night went strolling during the day. If you get the chance, should visit the area."
,,Exotic Fabrics,3.0,,"Here there are meters and meters of the most beautiful and exotic fabrics you are likely to see anywhere and at reasonable prices. The shops do all look the same though, and the vendors can be a little pushy, not giving you enough time to look before they are trying to ""help"" you."
,,Can visit,4.0,,"If you want to try biryani or roti, then this is the place to go for.. This is called arab street and you can get good arab food along with indian food as well."
,,well worth a visit,4.0,,"I was delighted with my visit to Arab Street. The area has been revamped and it really has a lovley energy about it. The lead up to the Mosque has a a number of beautiful shops all dispaying reasonably priced goods. if you are looking for fabric or scarves this is the place. There is also a wonderful little book shop with the most friendly and helpful staff.

There are a number of fabulous eating options. I would highly recommend a visit"
,,Worth the Walk,4.0,,"I really enjoyed my night in this area. Everything seemed relaxed with plenty of small cafes, bistros and bars to relax at. The energy here is easy going and inviting. Unlike Little India, it's clean and inviting. If you're in the market for rugs, this is would be a place to check out."
,,Wide choice of textiles and eateries,4.0,,Friendly shop keepers and wide range of textiles to choose from -please ensure to bring lots of $ ! Good food especially if you like Spore murtabak - delicious
,,For Textiles and Carpets shoppers,3.0,,"Arab street is one of the iconic streets in Singapore ,reachable within walking distance from the Bugis MRT station.
Located between the Haji Lane and Bussorah street.Visited here on 22 Feb 14.
2 lines of shops opposite each other , selling mainly textiles, carpets and rugs , peranakan sarongs and kebayas, antiques , and some aromatics and perfumery shops.
Many kinds of restaurants with outside seating can be found here , choices of Indian , Lebanese, Mediterranian food.
Further walk ,the Grand Sultan Mosque can be seen."
,,Arab Street neighborhood...a must see!,4.0,,"A bunch of select shops, mosques, eateries
and unique shops and buildings located within a Middle East accented neighborhood in Singapore. The street has an ambience and feeling which is comfortable and a great walking experience. Although there are many shopping experiences in this city, Arab Street ranks among the best! A must shopping and eating experience!"
,,Fabrics fabrics but little to no stretch knits,5.0,,"Awesome place for dress and suit fabrics. Do a trip through one side of the street first. Pick two or three fabrics and ask the prices. Ask for the prices of those fabrics all the way to the end of the street. Ignore what else takes your fancy. If you do see something you really like photo it and the front of the shop so you can remember. The price may vary from $20 to $6 for the same fabric.
Many shops are owned by the same owner. I got some lovely cottons at $5/meter that were same at another shop selling for discount price $12/m. If u want natural fabrics and are not sue just ask them to do the burn test for you. If hey refuse it is because they r trying to sell you polyester rather than silk or mixed viscose in cotton as pure cotton. Prices change accordingly.
If you want old style fabrics visit Mr Lee ...Chinese man. See photo. They even had some crimpelene from the 70's. most of his fabrics were $5/m.
There are some exquisite fabrics...take our time!!!"
,,Arab Street is real,5.0,,"Arab street has evolved. It used to be full of batik and fabrics of all kinds.While there are still a couple of batik stores, you can find all sorts of textiles, bits and bobs. The new additions are the many restaurants and the street which leads up to the Mosque - is now a walking street with an odd mix of shops. What I like best about Arab street is that it is real - it hasn't been put together as a ""tourist attraction"". It is what it is. Somehow, it always draws me back. Each time I go I find a new treasure. Favourite shop - Aljunied Brothers - there are two shops, but I like the one with the batik and kebayas. Very friendly ladies will show you how to look elegant in a sarong kebaya!"
,,Arab Street !!,5.0,,"We often visit this place for lunch as it has various food option .From indian ,mexican( kajbaz is a place for mexican food),lebanise,tandoori,barbeque ,french,Mediterranean & lots more. I really enjoy the outdoor eating seating arrangement in this street."
,,Arab street,5.0,,"A picturesque area around mosque, lots of shops selling fabrics and carpets. The place I liked best was Jamal Kazura aromatics. They sell perfumes and can mix for U you your own fragrance.All perfumes are oil-based, natural and durable sold in beautiful vials. There are many places that offer arab and mediterranean cuisine - all we ate was very tasty."
,,Most underrated,5.0,,"My favorite Neigbourhood in Singapore. Not overrun by tourists, relaxed atmosphere, good restaurants a picturesque mosque with palm trees and shophouses for fototaking. Just nice!"
,,"Nice pleasant neighborhood to visit, quaint, beatiful Mosques, great restaurants",5.0,,"Arab street is unique interesting place to visit, shop, eat Arab and Mediterrenean food at a decent price. A combination of shops not only of Arab but India, Dubai and other countries. We had a most pleasant visit there, enjoyed a good meal and shopped for unique item at reasonable prices. Not too many tourist visit so it is not crowded."
,,Nothing Arab like,4.0,,"Arab Street is nothing Arab like, except for a few shops selling Arabian carpets & Perfumes etc. I neither witnessed any Arab or had a glimpse of Arab culture, like little India. The Grand Sultan Mosque steals the beauty of the place. The street is occupied by the various shops showcasing their wares on the street & Restaurants also extending their business to the street to attract the travellers. So to say they have almost encroached the street.There are a lot of shops of various kinds selling gift items etc. and bargaining is a must. There are also a lot of eateries around to hang on, serving different food for different tastes. The area is easily accessible and transportation is not a problem.A stroll in the street with family & friends for food & shopping & relaxation is recommended."
,,Nice to see this side of Singapore,4.0,,"Sultan Mosque is of course major attraction in this area,but it's not the only reason to come here.Little different vibe than any other place in S'pore. Nice little shops(remember bargaining) and some good restaurants too."
,,Beautiful Place,4.0,,My first time going to Arab street i like visit that place is such beautiful mosque and nice neighbourhood around the areas. Lots of Bar and Bistro around easy to find the food :)
,,Great insight into a different part of Singapore,5.0,,Enjoyed walking aroung the area with the family. Had lunch in one of the cafes on the main street near the mosque. Great small stores in the streets in the area.
,,Worth a trip,4.0,,"By far the most interesting area I found for wandering in Singapore. Lots of shops to browse, authentic middle eastern clothing and bookshops, plenty of decent food options, and an area full of history."
,,Such diversity in this city!,4.0,,On my first trip to Singapore -- and I know I'll be back!! -- I was amazed at the ethic diversity all within a small number of city blocks. Arab Street was great to wander around especially because of the very cool goods for sale. You don't have to haggle and buy to take in the richness of these products. There are great eateries too -- so wander out and enjoy!
,,New Domino's Pizza at Arab Street,4.0,,"Recently I discovered that Domino's Pizza has opened a new store at 146 Arab Street. It's nearer to Victoria Street side, next to The White Panda Massage and near Raffles Hospital. It is a HALAL pizza shop tucked in the less crowded area of Arab Street. A good place to break fast if the rest of Kampong Glam area is crowded. Read my full review: http://malcolmsunny.com/2014/01/11/dominos-pizza-new-store-arab-street/"
,,Exotic Place,5.0,,"Its exotic, one almost forgets that he is in Singapore. Great place to buy unique souvenirs. One should be good at bargaining. I was just looking around when one carpet seller offered to show me one. I was not in a mood to but I told him. Still he he insisted and started showing, I asked price of a small size one he said SGD 50, then I said other shops it is available in 30. He said okay I will give you in 35. As I did not intend to buy I said thanks and moved forward.
There are shops only for beautiful perfume bottles. One can select a fragrance for a minimum of 6 SGD and get it in a bottle of SGD 12 smallest one. An ideal gift for perfume lover friends.
Could find some vegetarian food there. It was good. If you are garlic lover do try Turkish Hummus with tahini. And ya 3$ big cup of apple tea is a must try."
,,Explore,4.0,,Our hotel was right nearby on Beach Rd and we could have spent days eating at every place there was and they were all fantastic.
,,Nice area,4.0,,In and around Arab Street is a nice and quiet area. Lots of carpet and cloth shops and nice little cafés.
,,"Great food, lovely area",5.0,,"Highly recommended. We ended up abandoning Chinatown (very clean, slightly same same) to go back to Arab Street for the second time in a four day visit). The food and ambience is lovely and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal and stroll. NB: A note for those who like a drink with their meal - there is no liquor served."
,,Interesting Arab Street,4.0,,"If you are into making your own clothes, wearing scarfs (silk, cashmere, etc), rugs etc then this is the place for you.

It's wise to try your bartering skills at a number of shops as they seem to offer different prices! Some shops are more friendlier than others, who just want to sell you something. One shop we went in, the sales assistant started trying to sell us a scarf that was supposed to be cashmere but he thought it was pashmina!! So beware if not being ripped off.

There's also a selection of cafés, restaurants offering Middle Eastern fare etc."
,,Only if you are passing by,2.0,,"We made a special trip down here after reading mixed reviews but giving it the benefit of the doubt. We thought it was pretty much a waste of time, with the exception of seeing the beautiful Sultan Mosque. There are a number of Arabic food stores all beckoning you to come in. Also lots of fabric and carpet stalls, but not much else. Many stores are closed at night."
,,Street by Sultan Mosque,4.0,,"The best photos of Sultan Mosque are taken from this street. There are lots of eateries to choose from and you will get asked if you want to eat Indian, Turkish...food by the owners/waitresses. Houses are very pretty."
,,Arab Street and others run in parallel,5.0,,"Arab street itself has many clothing and fabric shops, and some touristy spots as well. If you walk along the area opposite the mosque, it looks especially touristy in some spots, but still many authentic shops along the way. Fun to stroll, and check out the streets that run parallel like Haji Lane!"
,,Historical lane,4.0,,"Been here when I was 7 (1993), and there's obviously a huge change around here. Once there were Mamak stalls with delicious food and Malay business owners everywhere. Now, there are only left a few and now there are more Arab businessmen on the rise. Cloth stores almost everywhere. Food is pretty decent, too. I love the Swedish restaurant (Fika). They have amazing Swedish food although the price could be a bomb to your wallet. Tried the Mediterranean food at Derwish restaurant and it was a little disappointing.

Arab street is pretty interesting. Come at night and the night life is pretty bustling. You will enjoy the nice view around here."
,,Nice Change to Asian Food,4.0,,"I stayed in a hostel next to Arab street when visiting Singapore with a friend in August this year. We had a great Moroccan food, and the Mosque lit up was really beautiful. We wondered through the next day and there was lot of lovely little shops."
,,Tiny but fun,4.0,,"This is what Singapore is all about. A big fun melting pot of food, people and atmosphere!
If you're there during Eid or the Ramadan make sure you have a biscuit in your pocket 'cause almost all the kitchens around will not serve you before 9pm!"
,,An interesting place,2.0,,"Arab Street is an interesting place. Some parts have been scrubbed a little too clean, re-furbished and renovated to look almost brand new to the extent that it's lost its charm. I can understand that old buildings need to be touched up so that it doesn't crumble but in my opinion, it's lost a bit of it's charm. Maybe give it a couple of years till the paint's a little faded, some parts get covered in moss or something.

That said, it still is an interesting place. There are small little lanes that should be explored on foot. You'll see shops selling perfume oils, textile shops and some very interesting cafes. I love the cafes especially since they do sell some very authentic middle eastern foods and at very reasonable prices. These places tend to get a bit crowded late evenings but that just adds to the charm of the location."
,,kain shopping - must come here,5.0,,"if you are female and you love to make dresses, be sure to come here. fabrics - silk, lace, different types of lace, chiffon, everything! be sure to negotiate. the earlier u come u tend to get better deals since they feel the first customers bring them more customers so they'll give u best price"
,,"Start here, but then explore",5.0,,"Yes, definitely do Arab Street - there are a ton of fabric shops and it feels very exotic. I'm sure you could get a beautiful dress made for cheap. But be sure to check out the surrounding streets as well! There's great shopping to be had on the streets on either side."
,,Fab!,5.0,,"I love it here. Theres an amazing place in Little India Arcade that does beauty treatments. I go for eyebrow threading. A lady called Madu did my treatments this time...one of the nicest people I've met here, and Singapore residents are lovely people.
Tried some sheesh and ate in Jungle Tandoori. Looking forward to revisiting."
,,Must visit,4.0,,"I like this place because it feature a different view of Singapore. But this is exactly a tourist spot n u can saw mostly the visitors are tourist. A lot of interesting shops featuring Arabic items. But the restaurant can get pretty packed at night. Ur order can takes up to 20min. But overall, it's worth a visit."
,,Very Excotic,4.0,,"What a delightful street, many small stores with all types of beautiful fabrics, carpets, crystals lots of colour. The little Restaurants looked very interesting but we had already eaten, the menus read well. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Shisha (Hookha) Smoking Joint in Singapore,4.0,,"Arab Street - Rows of conserved shop houses, painted in vibrant colours, here you’ll find bales of silk, batik, lace, organza and other materials here, where customisation and tailoring services are also available. Bring home a ready-made traditional or modern Malay costume or browse through the endless variety of traditional games, Arab perfumes, carpets, antiques and rattan handicrafts such as wicker baskets to spruce up your home.
At evenings, the restaurants at Arab Street offers the Shisha (Hookah) smoking along with drinks and middle east or western food. A hookah operates by water filtration and indirect heat. It can be used for smoking many substances, such as herbal fruits and tobacco. Grab a drink and a seat outside on the sidewalk and just chill."
,,Come at night,5.0,,"A great place to have some middle eastern food with nice outside siting and to buy some local souvenirs, however, you might get confuse on getting to this place but once you see the Mosque the restaurant and the shops are located behind it or just ask where is Muscat street."
,,Fabric and carpets,1.0,,"I wandered through this area as it was near my accommodation. Basically just fabric shops, with nothing really outstanding. If friends asked me if they should take a look, I'd probably tell them not to bother."
,,Pretty street with shops selling diverse products,4.0,,"Really liked Arab Street's shops. It was very relaxing browsing the stuff here. There's something about the layout of the place that feels very charming. It's near the mosque, too, so a lot of nice things to see."
,,Nothing interesting,3.0,,"Thought we check this place out since being at little India, Chinatown, this place was very basic unless your into there fabrics there really isn't much to buy. the only place we found interesting was there mosque from the outside, we didnt go. But overall this place isn't that interesting but won't hurt if you got some spare time to have alook for yourself."
,,Its like Aladdin's Cave,4.0,,"I wandered along Arab Street checking out the amazing array of beautiful ornate fabrics. Truly if excess baggage wasn’t a problem I could have bought metres of fabric. Fabric isn’t all Arab Street has to offer though, there’s carpet shops, light shops that sell the most gorgeous lights, clothing and places to eat. I visited during the day, the area was reasonably quiet. I was unable to visit the Sultan Mosque though was it was closed to visitors at that time."
,,A walk & meal on Arab St,3.0,,"There are some interesting little shops to visit with plenty of variety.
We went in daylight hours and it was a quiet time.
We ate in one of the restaurants and I was foolish to choose a salad side dish. It all looked very nice and clean but you can never tell so only shoose hot food to be on the safe side.
Unfortunately ended up in hospital with severe Gastroenteritis, dehydrated and feeling pretty sick.
Warning to travellers that the hospital required a deposit of $S4000 to accept me!
It ended up costing over $S1200 and was covered by Travel Insurance."
,,Impressive and kind of oriental place,4.0,,"I can highly recommend this place, especially in the evening. The lights of the bars (including shisha) and restaurants are beautiful. One highlight is the sultan mosque which is lighted and worth to see during night."
,,Exotic shopping trip,5.0,,Wow I love Arab street. My first time and what a treat. Gorgeous fabrics and cushions and rugs and perfumes and great food and very friendly people. I thoroughly enjoyed 4 hours trawling this shopping paradise
,,Arab Street Adventure,5.0,,"Fascinating ethnic neighborhood with great shops with fabrics, carpets, etc. Many cafes and hookah bars and unbelievably, a huge Mexican food restaurant."
,,Arab street. An arabic islamic Landmark in singapore,4.0,,"ٍA small street for Some merchants of yanem origin who sells some textiles and prefumes and auods
And accessiries
The sultan masijed in it is corner
Intersection with north bridge st
It contains some shisha cafe and
Arab restaurants
It us safe and nice to walk in even
In night time"
,,Disappointing,3.0,,Not much to buy at Arab St unless you are after pretty cheezy fabrics. Have to say I was disappointed. Overpriced Indian goods and pushy salespeople.
,,Charming little Street,4.0,,"This is definitely a place to wander around when in Singapore, the mosque is nice and the street around so pretty and colourful. There is lots of cafes and little souvenir ships. Worth seeing. This, china town and the India quarter made me realise how all these ethnicities live together in one Singapore."
,,Not so bad chill out place in man-made city,3.0,,"As Singapore is like my second home and even I couldn't count how many times I've been there, the city seems boring to me. Nevertheless Arab street is my favorite spot coz it's such a casual and good place to chill out or gather with old friends. For those who love to enjoy jazz music casually, it's definitely a perfect spot."
,,Plenty of hukka / sheesha places,5.0,,"One of the best part of Singapore was this nice little neighborhood. Full of restaurants that is not yet on trip advisor this neighborhood also has little lanes full of middle eastern restaurants and hukka bars. A favorite amongst a lot of tourists since this place also has some affordable hostels around as well. A fun place to hang out at night and make new friends.

During the day the place is full of shops that are selling anything from carpets to nice little Turkish lanterns."
,,Great fun all the time!,5.0,,"Practically my water hole on the past 3 years. Cheap liquor and great area to hang out with friends, I definitely gonna miss it!"
,,Excellent place!!,5.0,,"I felt as I am in some Arabian Nights movie, only thing which was very disappointing was the heat. You need to keep a bottle of water all the time and do enjoy the good restaurants there with the traditional tea and cold drinks. Best time to visit Arab street is in the evening."
,,Break fast with the Muslim community,5.0,,"In the fasting month, there are many street vendors in Arab Street area, just outside the Sultan Mosque, offering tasty and clean local food. It's very colorful and you get a sense of what it might be in Morocco or Egypt in the bazzars. Shopping for knock knacks especially for fabric and shawls and carpets is very convenent. Plan to spend at least 1 hour on foot."
,,Beautiful Carpets and Such A Great Feeling in a GREAT City!,5.0,,"I had gone to Arab Street 4 years ago to purchase carpets for our new home, and made sure to introduce my wife to this great place when we visited this week. Spent a lot of time at Haji Tawakal Carpets at 50 Arab Street, and we bought two new carpets. Ibraham, one of the owners, is so accommodating and pleasant, and he worked with us to find the pieces that my wife was hoping to find. I highly recommend Ibraham and his brother, who made this shopping experience a real pleasure. If you are looking for carpets, make sure you go to Arab Street. Ibraham will do his utmost to help you find what you are looking for, and I was very pleased to be able to find him again on this second trip to Singapore. Our new carpets will be shipped home in the next few days. We thoroughly enjoyed our time in this fantastic community of Singapore!"
,,"Nice street with Mosque, shops & Restaurants",4.0,,"Arab street is the heart of Muslim Communities. The street has a nice Mosque, called the Sultan Mosque. It was built in 1826 by Sultan Hussein Shah of Johor and completed in 1928. It's one of Singapore's oldest and most important mosques

Except that, at Arba street, lot of small shops and restaurants, and you will find per example at the Junction of Arab Street and Beach Road, one of the most interesting cultural blend called Fika Café, a halal Swedish eatery.....

To go there get off at Bugis MRT Station and head out Exit B."
,,Colourful location with a very good selction of shops.,4.0,,"A lot of carpet and dress shops. The carpet shops all try to entice you in, some of the carpets look really great, it’s just getting them home that's the problem. We even passed one dress shop that claimed to have provided a dress for the Duchess if Cambridge on her recent visit to Singapore."
,,This street is great to take visitors with its many Indian fabric shops,4.0,,"This street is great to take visitors with its many Indian fabric shops. Haji lane nearby also has neat little boutiques, middle eastern, Mexican and Indian cafes and restaurants."
,,"Arabic Food, Bars, Carpet Shops",4.0,,"Home to Singapore's arab community, arab street is full of Persian, Moroccan, and Turkish restaurants with pretty authentic food! There is a also a pretty huge mosque nearby and there are a number of clothing, carpet and souvenir shops. The bar scene in the area is also pretty good, look for Haji Lane which is full of bars with Arab themes, may of them also offer Sheesha and floored seating. Friday and Saturday nights are pretty active throughout the year. Nasreen Persion Restaurant has amazing Persian food but is also perhaps one of the most busy restaurant on the street so expect to wait or make a reservation!"
,,Hum Drum on a Monday Night,3.0,,"I visited Arab Street on a Monday night in search of some textiles and local cloths. Much to my dismay, most shops were closed in the evenings, and not much was happening except for the Persian restaurant around the corner, some carpet shops and traditional perfume shop that remained open till late. Arab street is located a short distance away from the Bugis MRT station. Disappointing, but maybe I will return on a day visit and hopefully there's more to see (and buy)."
,,Sultan Mosque,4.0,,"Do visit the Sultan Mosque on Arab Street. Beautiful architecture and tourists are welcomed to visit. They give tours. You can even enter the mosque. If you aren't dressed for it, no worries. They provide robes for both male and female."
,,Feel the nostalgia in the air!,5.0,,"Good:
-Great food!
-Exciting night life!!
-Boutique shops lined along the streets offer you a unique shopping experience,
unlike those found at the city area.

Bad:
-The last time I visited this place in 2013, at around 9pm,
the police was called in cause of a fighting incident at a pub,
I'm guessing one guy was intoxicated :(

-Hot weather, little shade, so bring an umbrella!
-Bring a map...I was using the GPS on my mobile (cellphone) & I was lost!!"
,,Hubbly Bubbly,5.0,,"I loved this part of Singapore City. I roamed around for an hour and stumbled across this cool cafe where I smoked a ""shisha"" as its commonly known; met some cool people and hung out. There's lot's of fabric shops if you're into that and not much else that I found"
,,"Worth a look but not ""exciting""",4.0,,"Arab street was a nice, calm area when we visited. The people we friendly, plenty of cafes and shops, and rather enjoyable. The highlight was probably stopping in at a couple of perfume shops. One was mixing their own scents and, while more expensive than their nearby competitor, had some really interesting perfumes.
The other had a gorgeous selection of bottles (I have several very similar from Egypt) but their scents were all set/standard. We bought from them, though, and had a lovely chat with the owners/staff-- one of the highlights of my day. Both shops are worthwhile, I think!"
,,Vibrant place,5.0,,"Loved the little quirky shops, the vibe of arab street is lovely. The bright colours of the street shops and all the materials. The smell of shisha in the air."
,,Didn't knew such a place existed in Singapore,4.0,,"It was only when I happened to walk across Bugis, that I came across Arab street. I didn't even knew this place existed until then. The first sight of the street leaves you wondering whether you landed up in some arab country with the streets named ""Bussorah Road"", ""Baghdad street"", ""Moscow Street"", ""Arab Street"" and etc. A very good place for Arab, Moroccon, Turkish and other food. And if you are looking for a hookah place in Singapore, this is the place to be."
,,Not the hustle and bustle I expected..,3.0,,"Having read previous reviews I expected a busy shopping street with an array of market sellers, however I was disappointed to find a quiet street with many standard shop fronts. Im sure it would be lovely for someone looking to buy fabric, perfume, ornaments etc, but for me personally it lacked atmosphere. Sultans Mosque is pretty spectacular shimmering in the afternoon sun."
,,Historic place,4.0,,"Like how the street got its name, the Arabs and other Muslim traders meet to their trading in the olden days, not too far from Kampong Glam. Hence, until today there concentrated trader and vendor from Middle-east and countries around it. Here, they have shops selling textile, rugs and carpet and spices. There are many popular Middle-eastern and Indian eateries."
,,For a chill-out afternoon,5.0,,"An excellent way to spend an afternoon. A mix of old shops, mosque, tourist shops and great food. Sit down for a tea at any of the corner shops and enjoy a relaxed part of Singapore. For younger shopping, Haji Lane is worth a visit."
,,"Excellent vibe, with lots of great Meze cafes",5.0,,"Great atmosphere, loads of hidden gems, boutique shops, trendy cocktail bars, and plenty of great meze food. Try the apple tea its very refreshing"
,,A different side of Singapore,5.0,,"Less pricey than the trendy clark and boat quay. Good for shopping during the day, at night it is magical, see the streets turn into restaurant tables and people conversing and laughing over dinner and smoking sheesha while at it. Open terraces, good bars and music too, narrow streets. Quite a good experience over here."
,,Many Arabian Restaurants,4.0,,there is many middle east restaurant in this area. located near of Bugis MRT. you can walk about 10 minutes from Bugis Junction to this area
,,Nice,4.0,,"the district is really lively and sympatic (wild concert, bars with terraces on the street and with better prices than clarque quay the trendy district)"
,,Exotic,4.0,,"Oner should not miss the ZAM ZAM restaurant in Arab Street. The resto boasts of the best murtabak in all Singapore. Give it a try and see how it is cooked simply by looking outside the window.

Haji Lane parallel to Arab Street is home to quaint shops of many kinds. People are friendly but dont be discouraged if they dont smile as much as the other Singaporeans. Visit the Mosque at no cost and experience how Muslims worship and pray.

Tip: Shisha is available in many of the restaurants."
,,Bit run down,3.0,,I alittle run down and is a place to visit if you are passing. Possibly combining with other places as it is close to Little India.
,,Tourists shops and restaurants,3.0,,"Nothing to write home about, it's not really worth the trip there. There is a huge mosque that closes 12:00 to 14:00 (I did not visit)"
,,transport yourself,5.0,,"While in Singapore take a side trip to a different world. This area offers great food, shopping and sights. We enjoyed Zam Zam restaurant immensely. The mosque and parks are wonder to behold."
,,Fantastic for late nights,5.0,,make sure u visit arab street both during the day to experience shopping but also later at night to see everyone sitting on the street having dinner and smoking shisha
,,Another face of Singapore,4.0,,i love Singapore for his variety so visiting Arab Street give you another face of the city. Head to Sultan Mosque after visiting the street. Good photo spot
,,"Relax, Gorgeous and Vibrant",4.0,,"The street is full of nice restaurants in which you can eat outside, so you can contemplate the gorgeous Mosque, especially at night when the lightning makes it appear even more beautiful. The district is vibrant with lots of people going out and having a relax yet fun time in one the the various pubs around. Great spot to smoke shisha as well."
,,Arab Street - Nice area of Singapore to visit,3.0,,"We recently spent some time in the area of Arab Street and the Sultan Mosque and had a nice time in this area of the city, which offers yet another uniquely different cultural flavour to the Singapore mixing pot.

Arab street and the area seem to have many colourfully painted buildings that sell dress materials, pashmina and other related goods. There are also plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, hostel/guesthouses. While we enjoyed Arab Street itself, we also very much liked the small Oman Street with its nice gate paintings and the very colourful Haji Lane, which seems to have evolved into a trendy/boutique fashion, accessories and novelty sort of shopping lane. Throughout this area, there is opportunity for nice photography work.

Near Arab Street is the Sultan Mosque which is the largest mosque you can visit in Singapore and a nice one to visit. When we visited, there was a friendly young man manning the entrance helping everyone to the cover dress that had to worn to walk inside. This was a very tourist-friendly environment and made visits here quite comfortable for all entering.

Further, a great restaurant in this area can be found in Singapore Zam Zam, which serves up delicious murtabek. This was one of our very favorite meals tried during our most recent trip to Singapore, something we will specifically target for a repeat meal when we next return to the city.

Overall, the area around Arab Street is colourful, unique and makes a good place to spend few hours during trips to Singapore. You can combine a visit here with Bugis area attractions and malls and/or Little India, which is also not so far away."
,,Carpets and material,3.0,,"Arab street has lots of shops selling mats , pashminas, and lots of dress making material and decorations, that is about it so if you're not interested in that then don't go,"
,,Nice for a stroll.,3.0,,"Not far from the Little India MRT station, a few steps from the majestic mosque in Singapore, a picturesque and colorful road, a pleasure to stroll among the shops and restaurants in the area. Some tourist area but equally beautiful and interesting."
,,Murtabak,5.0,,"I only know Arab Street when i am in Singapore and i am hungry, the Nasi Beriyani & Murtabak is really out of the world, i have even taken all my family members there to try out the food and they have nodded that it great food."
,,Happening & Vibrant,4.0,,Arab street is a happening area in Singapore with great middle eastern foods and sheesha bars. Most of the restaurant are of middle east concept and the food are awesome. You can see a lot of locals and tourists enjoying nice sheesha. One of the best in Arab st could be Ameera's grill and Nasrin
,,Treasure Trove,4.0,,"Its a quaint part of Singapore that has modern touristy attractions and also a part that has hardly been touched by restoration. I like the old shops that has such a treasure trove of interesting items - woven tapestries, silk flowers, religious medals amid all kinds of beads for do-it-yourself art, hundreds of rolls of material that is a designer's paradise and if one is tired after endless browsing and shopping, just plonk oneself in any of the many watering holes for a thirst quencher. Be warned though, most of the shops are non-airconditioned, so please wear comfortable and light clothing as it can get quite warm on some days. Its worthwhile visiting and be prepared to spend a few hours to hunt for that treasure. Enjoy!"
,,Shops and Bars,5.0,,"Lots of shops in this historical part of Singaport. On the next road Haji ln, you will find a great and modern bar called Bar Stories, it is definitely worth a go ;)"
,,Relax,4.0,,Very relaxed part of Singapore with many nice restaurants where you can forget about all your duties and enjoy relax atmosphere.
,,Great place,5.0,,We stayed near here and found that this was an excellent place to eat. It is also fun just to stroll around and look at the shops. The carpet stores are particularly interesting.
,,loved the colour of the street,5.0,,loved the colour of the street many little restaurants to try out--wandered around the many little streets--one street sort of kitty corner from arab street had delightful little shops--with one off items..felt very safe at night with my sister as we wandered the shops--lots of people smoking hookahs which is interesting to see if you are from the heartlands of Utah
,,Colourful street,5.0,,It's nice street to walk around and look at the shops lots off shisha but (they are very expensive can't believe it ) But when you are in the tourist places that what you get anywhere . costamer serves not good( from my experience all off Asia like that )so I'm use to it now . Good walk and shops and testy middlleast food yummy . You will enjoy it. :-) try sac restaurant it's yammani
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,The area around Sultan Mosque is picturesque and surprisingly quite. There are loads of interesting restaurants in the area offering an interesting selection of menus. Don't forget to check out Bussorah Street
,,Lots of interesting find,4.0,,"If you are looking for interesting finds, Arab Street is the place for you. They sell cloths, bangles, ribbons, etc. Love this place especially if you are into sewing and crafting."
,,Colourful experience,4.0,,This street was stumbled upon by accident but was great to see all the muddle-eastern flavours and culture. Plenty to see and buy and the mosque was beautiful
,,A thousand textile shops ridiculous to sublime,4.0,,"I went to see if I could find any batik or other ethnic textiles. The place is jammed with fabric stores, with vendors eager (though not obnoxiously eager) to show you what they have. It is obviously a favorite for locals who are having gowns or Islamic clothing made. Some of the material was pretty garish for my taste. A few of the stalls expect you to remove your shoes on entry. I was looking for something handmade and found Toko Aljunied at 91 Arab St with exceptional batik shirts, table runners, and sarongs. I also bought some less expensive but handsome scarves at Dilip Textiles at 74 Arab St. Parallel to Arab St is Haji Lane which is for things that are young and funky."
,,shopping,3.0,,i use to pass by Arab street every time i park my car. Restaurants there are great. and its quite convenient to go there as the Bus Terminal is just one street away :)
,,Good in all the ways.,5.0,,"Is a place to go for, in Singapore, nice food, nice ambience, a lot of shops, etc. I cannot recommend something in special, just go there and enjoy the place."
,,"An authentic early settlement of the middle-easterners, nice place",4.0,,"An authentic early settlement of the middle-easterners, nice place if u love the culture of middle-east. Food , shops and lots to see."
,,Favorite hangout spot !,4.0,,"I am regular visitor to Arab street. Almost all the restaurants are middle eastern restaurants. Hukkahs are available in abundance and in many flavors. The food is exquisite at almost all places. Some of the restaurants may be a little pricy but most of them are affordable.
A beautiful place to spend the weekend in Singapore."
,,A Stroll Down Arab Street,4.0,,"Arab street is a short walk from the Bugis MRT station. It is the middle eastern precinct of Singapore with fabric shops specialising in silks and carpets. It is dominated by the Sultan Mosque which is well worth a visit. (ladies make sure that you are carrying a scarf ).
While there is a certain sameness in the shops they are well worth sticking your nose into. The usual rules of engagement apply i.e. know what the item is worth and worth to you and bargain....
We ate at a small Turkish restaurant where the food was good and cheap and the seat on the verandah made people watching a breeze."
,,"a colorful, beautiful shopping experience",4.0,,"very colorful, wonderful, and beautiful street. Best place to buy silk, mats, carpet, some antique ornaments, food, and walk. Even if one is not interested in buying take a walk, roam around, its amazing exp."
,,Exotic,5.0,,It's a whole lot different quarter in this country. Amazing mosques and special cuisine. Get off at Bugis MRT and get out at Exit E. Go past Golden Landmark Mall and you'll find it!
,,Wonderfully Colorful,5.0,,"Arab St is filled with shops, so didn't so much but look around. What I saw, I liked. A few nice restaurants, over my budget, but on the adjacent Haji lane are boutiques and revamped clothing shops for the indie crowd. Lots of colors and a great trail or walk to the mosque! All it needs it music to include in the walking score. x"
,,Mid - Western kampong in Middle of Singapore,4.0,,"Was there last night. Quite different from the usual restaurants you'd find in the island. Mostly clustered restaurants at the end-of the street leading to Sultan Mosque.
The mosque in itself a thing of beauty. The street leading to it is lined with exotic carpet vendors and people selling arabic wares.
The restaurants are huddled in a corner in front of the mosque. You'd find Morroccan, turkish and lebanese foods with pasta and gyros thrown in. Hukka is a crowd-puller here. Alcohol is rarely available. We settled in a cozy turkish restaurant called Derwish. Food was good. The hukka lasted long. The service was ok. I am thankful they did not charge me for the broken glass."
,,Artsy,4.0,,Love the area! Full of yummy food. I like A la Turka best and the desserts around the corner of the intersection. Party and drinking starts early at night.
,,There's more than Orchard Road,4.0,,"Nice little spot away from the glitz and glamour of Orchard Road. Some lovely little boutique stores, coffee and eating houses as well as the large Mosque."
,,"Quirky , lively and interesting",5.0,,"We chose this area having been there briefly on our way out to Australia. Arab Street and the surrounding streets are the Arabic and Turkish areas of singapore . Food from all the major middle eastern cusines are here as well as interesting shops , particularly fabrics and carpets . The Mosque is lovely too. If you are a smoker there is still the ability to eat outdoors here without worry , Some restaurants are halal and do not serve alcohol . Try a hookah whilst there."
,,get out,5.0,,This is a great way to realize that there more than China to Asia and Persia for example is part of it. The food is great and the colors of the merchandise sold on the rugs and silk stores lift anyone's spirit. Not to miss the store where they make a perfume personalized to your like (#42 Arab Street)
,,Beautiful surrounding,5.0,,"i like the surrounding with all the old building / architecture. there are lots of Halal restaurants, ranging from malay food, indian food and arab food."
,,Great experience,4.0,,The place has a lot happening on weekends. Spoilt for choice as far as food is concerned. After the shops close at around 8 pm. the eating joints expand onto the road. Hookah joints abound and night life goes on till 3 am.
,,Fantastic food!,5.0,,"Whilst you're able to grab a pretty rug to return home with, the real positive of your visit to this area would be the food! Many meats and dips. Beautiful! Eat your heart out."
,,"Relaxed place, nice atmosphere",4.0,,"The district was really relaxed compared to other touristic parts of Singapor. We really liked walking around there. Persons were very friendly... If you wanna eat something different during your stay - a lot of arab restaurants around there, seems also to be a good place for Shisha smoking."
,,Proper gulf experience,4.0,,"The Arab street area has lot of other streets like bagdad and kandhar streets. The sultan mosque is one of the prime attractions but also you have malay heritage centre just next to it. This area has an typical feel of gulf countries with lot of restaurants serving Turkish, lebanese food. This area has come cool BBQ joints and lots of pubs.
Also their are many shops selling fabrics and carpets. We did not visit them as their much more better quality in india compared to what was being offered their.
Take a stroll, sip some abrabic tea....and enjoy.."
,,Fun to visit,4.0,,Interesting..... fun little shops. Liked the unique jewelry places; not too pricey. (more costume like)
,,First time in a while,4.0,,"Visited Arab St for the first time in a while.
Just walk around the streets taking in a different side of Singapore.
Check out Sultans Mosque for its architectural significance. You don't need to go inside and make a spectacle of their beliefs. Remember it is a place of worship.
Had lunch at Cafe Le Claire on Arab St. While in Arab St, eat Arab St.
Great food, good selection, good price.
Remember to pick up some cheap souvenirs outside Sultans Mosque."
,,A quaint enclave in modern Singapore,5.0,,I live in Singapore but still finds Arab Street alluring for its old world charm. It brings me back to my childhood everytime I visit. Although many of the buildings have undergone some upgrading it still gives me the warm laid back feeling when I take a sip of tea at one of the many cafes dotting the streets.
,,A sewers dream,5.0,,After spending a lot of time in over priced shopping centres Arab street reminded me much more of asian marketing. A sewers dream with so many stalls of fabric and a great opportunity to pick up the cheesey souvenirs that family members expect when you return from an overseas holiday.
,,Cafe le Claire - arab food!,4.0,,Those who loves arab food and shisha will definitely not to miss this cafe. It is opened till late 3am. I particularly liked the cafe Grill Quail and mushrooms and most of the dishes are reasonably priced and it is delicious! A must try!
,,Colours and good mood !,4.0,,"The Arab District in Singapore is like to fly to some places in the Middle East; you are surrounded by nice colours, essences, good food, relaxed mood and great Shisha places !"
,,Good food and shopping,4.0,,Arab Street is a fun place. I like the Turkish restaurants and there is actually some pretty good shopping.
,,"Good atmosphere, cozy restaurants",4.0,,"Walhalla if you wanna buy nice fabrics... Arab street is full with nice (Indian) fabrics for sale.. One shop even nicer as the other shop, but really have to compare prices... And also Arabian perfume shops...
The parallel street behind the Arab street: you will find souvenir shops and some boutiques with nice things. But most of all trendy bars/restaurants... Liked the atmosphere very much in this area...
Was here with my son just to hunt for nice X-Mas presents to bring to EU... What we certainly found here..."
,,Fascinating place for a half day walk- tasty and good value food and specialty shopping opportunities,5.0,,"Arab Street gives you an opportunity to visit an area which has some ""olde style"" atmosphere- with shop houses, an impressive Mosque, Halal restaurants (offering fresh tasty food at very reasonable prices) and specialty shops offering rugs, luxury fabrics and objects d'art.

It's well worth a half day walk. You could consider taking an organised walking tour- the Original Singapore Walks folks do a tour of this fascinating locality.

Well worth a visit!"
,,A fabric shopper's paradise,4.0,,"As the title suggests, Arab Street in Singapore is chock-a-block with fabrics. As yet I have to spot someone flying around on one of the many carpets for sale, but I keep looking. Many shops along the streets in this area sell foodstuffs. Sack and sacks of rice, etc are outside these many small shops. It is impossible to walk along without smelling all the wonderful spices.
This area is a magnet for back packers, with their many reasonably prices restaurants and bars. On most street corners a visitor will find somewhere to enjoy a relaxing massage. It is difficult to walk more than a few yards without meeting someone smoking a water pipe. Such is the culture in this part of Singapore. They even smoke these water pipes sitting at the outside tables of the restaurants. Again, it is their culture. At night, the area really comes alive.
The mosque is not to me missed. During the day, or at night, it looks impressive. During the night, the lights change colour every so often."
,,excellent for pashima shopping and massage,5.0,,"Go around to shop silk, pashimas and fabrics. Also, all sorts of decorations textiles. Alight at White Panda massages, for a nice and relaxing treatment."
,,Getaway,5.0,,Definitely one of my stops if I'm cycling through the city. One thing I like about the place is the old buildings and the small streets. A place in the city to get away from the city.
,,Very Cool - Lots of eating establishments and fabric shopping,4.0,,"I would likely visit this area again to try some of the Middle Eastern or Turkish restaurants. It is a little cleaner than China Town and Little India if my opinion.

The Sultan Mosque as also an impressive site and a nice photo opportunity. If you have been to a shopping Souq in other Arabic cultures then you may not be impressed by this. But this was a nice reminder to me of some of the Souq's I have visited in the past."
,,Unique shops,4.0,,"So much good food and if you search the whole place, you'll find many unique shops. Alot of culture and plenty of seesha places to hang out with friends til late. Good for smokers co most of the restaurants have outdoor seating coz of the seesha."
,,Unknown Gem,5.0,,"One of our favorite areas for unique food and shops. Go to Zamzams for the murtabaks, Turkish and Lebanese eateries, unique gifts from the Middle East and India."
,,Oozes culture..,4.0,,"Arab street is another welcome break from the concrete jungle of Singapore. The place teems with old fashioned shop houses as well as Arab restaurants. Many provide the enticing hookah for the guests. Also, there are a lot of shops selling fabrics with intricate designs. What impressed me the most was that people here seem to have held on to their culture. They are dressed more traditionally than anyone else in the city. The items for sale are different and some even may be ethnic.

Also, the towering Sultan Mosque gives the whole place an aura, that establishes a sense of piety and dignity in the area. Entry is allowed and free and mandates decent dressing. They provide the robe & scarf for ladies to wear if interested in entering.

When I visited, there was this Omani festival going on. With Omani paintings for sale and even free Henna and Calligraphy souvenirs."
,,Historic area with great shops,4.0,,"If you're visiting Singapore, you really should try to make it down to Arab Street where you will find tons of fabric stores, clothing stores, beading supplies, baskets and FOOD FOOD FOOD! If you live in Singapore and haven't been there, what are you waiting for?"
,,Historical Section of Singapore,5.0,,"Lovely old buildings with lots of shops. If you are looking for a rug, check it out! There are also many restaurants. We ate at a very local fish soup restaurant and as I was with my Singaporean host I have no idea the name as there was nothing in English. It was great!"
,,A gem of a street in Sing!,4.0,,"Good finds on moroccan/ arabian goods, lots of restaurants with option to order hookah/ shisha. I can't even remember the name of the place we went to but it served absolutely fabulous Pakistani milk-shakes... I wanna go back!"
,,Touring overseas visitor,4.0,,Took my brother to Arab St and he really enjoyed it. We had nice time looking in the interesting shops in this area and then a great meal a Alaturka restaurant.
,,Great!,5.0,,Vibrant and fun with more restaurants than you can shake a stick at - many do not serve alcohol but there are plenty that do if that's what you're after. As fun in the day as at night. Lots of little shops and places to explore :)
,,my favourite place to eat in Singapore,5.0,,"great restaurants where you can eat outside, good ambiance, no cars... nearby you can go to chicha bars you really travel when going there"
,,Haji lane great vibe,4.0,,We really enjoyed haji lane great array of hip clothes home wares and jewellery very good price.arab street full of Persian rugs and fabrics but a good spot to soak up a different culture
,,Lame during the day,2.0,,Not much going on. Most shops are selling the same kind of fabric. Found a decent hookah bar but service was awful. Go elsewhere.
,,Good vibe in the evening,4.0,,"Perhaps too small and limited during the day, but a great atmosphere in the evening. Fancy a beer, easy food, shisha, cocktail, fashionable party-goers? You'll find it all at Arab St."
,,The Arab Street,4.0,,Driven past the Arab street almost everyday and wanted to have a look for an hour or so. When we got there it looked different than the other ethnic centers.We ended up spending the rest of the afternoon and part of the evening there. Camera shops seams a lot cheaper than China town. Check the brands and Quality of both centers.
,,Discovering Cultural,5.0,,I loved to look around and see different products made from different cultural like the Chines fan and Arabian scarfs.
,,Shopping and food,4.0,,"If you like indian food this is the area to get it, lots of low price to medium price eateries and the amazing Mustaphas - it has everything you never thought you wanted it. Watch out for the back streets, lots of hookers."
,,"Must see! Sultan mosque, foodies, sheesha/smoke pipes, fabric stores,carpets, cheap souvenirs, SHOPPING(!!!)",5.0,,"When to go: After 1 p.m. (as frommer guide mentions). Some stores don't open their doors early.

Directions:
Step off Bugis metro and walk straight. You will pass by a subway where you cross the street. Keep walking- pass by the hotel and you will find Arab street. ATTN ladies: On the brief 10 mins walk you will find plenty of shopping places to stop by. Bugus village being one of them.
Description:Such a charming neighborhood. If you visit Singapore during Ramadan (holy month when muslims fast and pray) be sure to check out the food stalls (before the sun goes down). On any other time stop by to have some delicious middle eastern food from Morocoo,Turkey, Isantbul, Iran etc.

Budget eat:
Deli Morrocan on Bussorah street is a good budget eat. We had Falafel and Baby ghanoush (made from egg plant). Also the minty morrocan tea is delish (enough for 2 people). Price reasonable enough for 2 ppl.

Also, if you like sharwma (pita sandwich made from lamb,beef chicken) stop by at Nasrin's (iranian I believe) at end of street. No ambience but decnt food that wont break your wallet. The sharwma sandwich comes with spicy fries. At $11 per person it makes decent dinner. The rice and kebab platter also looked big enough to share. Nasrin's has place to sit outside where you can smoke sheeshas while you wait for food. Service was super slow but owner noticed us getting impatient and came over to chat. Nice touch! Drinks start at $10 at happy hr. (!) - not worth it.

Shopping tip:
Good place to buy souvenirs and trinkets (magnets,batik, interesting looking asian dolls. I saw some some stores selling batik form indonesia and other decor items from Malysia and Thailand. I am a new expat and found prices cheaper than Chinatown. Also, some uncommon and more interesting pieces than I found in Chinatown."
,,Not much change,4.0,,"Have not been to Singapore for many years. Not much changes to Arab Street, still the same, selling fabrics, cloths etc and more cafes around the area. One thing I observed, its cleaner then when I first visited many years ago."
,,Great place to chill out,5.0,,"An excellent place with loads of great Arab food, fairly cheap alcohol, nice bars with ambient music and people smoking sheesha everywhere. It's very pleasant at night, very good place to go to and chat with your friends. The whole area has a very pleasant atmosphere. i highly recommend, it's a must-see! :)"
,,Heritage walk,5.0,,"Quirky, funky shops, intertwined with culture and heritage. Think of our roots while sipping latte in a quaint cafe. Or groove to jazz with a glass of red wine. Watch out for bazaars in the area during Hari Raya."
,,Interesting place,4.0,,"If you like shisha or hooka, there are plenty of small cafes to hang out and relax. Interesting boutique shops can be found in Haji land and plenty of antique shops around the mosque."
,,"Shisha, Carpets and Perfume",4.0,,"The Arab Quarter extends over a number of streets and lane ways and is a great alternative to the more 'sterile' areas of Singapore. This is a great way to spend an afternoon as a tourist or expat. There are many shops selling carpets and perfumes, and others where you can purchase reasonabley priced cotton printed tablecloths to get that Middle Eastern feel back home. There is a bookshop, camera and clothing shops, and the usual 'touristy' souvenirs. There are lots of restaurants to choose from, mostly with a Middle Eastern theme. It is a 10 minute walk from the MRT at Bugis. If you are into photography then there are plenty of great street scenes."
,,I'd heard of it ..,4.0,,"I'd heard of Arab Street but had never actually been there. This visit to Singapore, we had a Hotel only five minutes walk away. (Santa Grande, Bugis) Naturally, we took a walk down Arab Street. Lots of shops. A lot of the same stuff that can be found elsewhere in Singapore. However, the Islamic presence provided enough of different shopping to make this a worthwhile visit. Lots of shops selling Silk in both garment and fabric forms. Also, a big Mosque nearby that allows tourists to discreetly observe. Don't just stay on Arab Street. Take a walk down the side streets too! All sorts of little nooks to search and bargains to be found."
,,Lots of little restaraunts and some knick nack stores.,3.0,,"Good food, reasonably priced as well. Stayed in Little India for 3 days. The temple was really fun to listen to when they played the prayer over the massive loud speakers. Only rated average because the vendors and restaraunts kind of annoying when you walk past everyone and they want to get your business hounding you."
,,"Good atmosphere, original buildings, not that clean as in Singapore is expected",3.0,,"Good atmosphere, worth to see. Singapore is a small country but very diversified with the Arab Street, Little India and Chinatown. You will find a lot of shops in Arab Street, the gadged and multimedia devices here are the cheapest in whole Singapore and South-East-Asia, but beware of quality. I bought a battery for my Canon SLR, starting price was 125SGD, I got it for 30SGD, but the value is even less, since it proved to be a cheap copy,very bad quality, although it was sold as an original piece made in Japan. The Canon EOS 600D Kit was sold for ca. 800SGD, this is an extremely low price even compared to the low Swiss prices. I haven't bought because I already had the same, thus I cannot judge if they were original products, based on the package looked original."
,,Must Go,5.0,,"Every visitor to Singapore should spend an afternoon/evening in the Arab Street area. It is one of the coolest ethnic neighbourhoods in the city-state. The Sultan Mosque is a beautiful local landmark, and the streets surrounding are choc-a-bloc with fun shops and restaurants. Be aware some of the restaurants do not serve alcohol and you should not walk around in the viciity of the mosque holding a can of beer either, but plenty of restaurants do serve wine and beer so just have a discreet peek at the menu."
,,Haji Lane is the standout,3.0,,"Arab street (and the surrounding streets) are a great place to spend a late afternoon or evening. Haji Lane has great little boutiques and dress shops primarily for women. So ladies, leave your husband behind for this trip unless you are planning on going out to dinner in the evening. Lots of fabric stores too, but mostly for suits or traditional middle eastern women's garments. And of course plenty of carpet shops to haggle with. Just make sure you don't go before noon as very few of the shops are open. Better yet, wait until about 2. Not sure why everything is so quiet beforehand. Lunch places are hard to find because many of the restaurants are closed."
,,Am I in Singapore ?,4.0,,"I was on a short business trip to Singapore during ramadhan fasting month and was looking for something to break fast. When I stepped out of the hotel I was staying (Landmark Village), I saw a lot of people at this particular alley and I followed suit. Halal food are plentiful and you are spoilt for choise. Dont forget to visit the magnificent mosque (you cannot miss it). Anyone can go in. They provide robe for those wearing shorts or sleeveless. And they do make you feel welcome."
,,Great shopping for exotic items,5.0,,"Arab street is a great place for shopping for amazing fabrics, garments, footwear, persian rugs, arts and crafts and all kinds of exotic items from Arabian countries. I had fun window shopping and just walking the length of the street was pleasant because the items displayed looked like works of art."
,,Unique place in Singapore.,4.0,,"Definitely a place to visit if you are into culture and loves diving into small quaint shops just to see what they are selling. A great place for unique shopping gifts, and the corner fragrance shop is an icon! A highly recommended place from a Singaporean who turns happily into a tourist when there. Enjoy!"
,,Doesn't feel like Singapore,5.0,,This street is very nostalgic. It made me feel that I'm not in Singapore. The selections of food and shopping are excellent. I especially love what I can find here (and including Haji Lane) as compared to going to shopping malls.
,,A world of it's own,5.0,,Arab St is a nice place to visit if you are looking for a taste of middle eastern. Lots of good eateries and handicraft along the road. Good backpackers hostel available there too.
,,Good variety of food and shops - Haggle hard!,4.0,,"This area showed a lovely side to Singapore's diversity.
There is plenty of choice of restaurants and bars, along with shops to pick up some bargains.
I bought a sari length and haggled hard with the guy in the shop - there are definitely deals to be had!
Worth a wander, the walls are covered with murals and there is a rich mix of architecture. Don't forget your camera!"
,,Shopping,4.0,,It is a good place to buy material to make dresses. they have lovely laces and fine material for evening clothes. It is also great to buy carpets and rottan baskets.
,,I've visited many times,4.0,,"This street is great to take visitors with its many Indian fabric shops. Haji lane nearby also has neat little boutiques, middle eastern, Mexican and Indian cafes and restaurants."
,,Shabby Chic,5.0,,"The artistic hub of Singapore this area is filled with amazing boutiques showcasing everything from quirky local designers, jewellery, vintage and even bicycles. At night the food at the arabc restaurants is delicious, reasonable and a shisha is always a great way to end the night."
,,Colorful with affordable restos to dine with,4.0,,"I come here almost every month when friends and I just want to chill and hang out. Too many choices of Mediterranean food and there are cheap restos that serve really nice kebabs! If you enjoy shisha too, this is the best place to be!"
,,Is this really Singapore?,4.0,,"A late night visit to Arab Street will see coffee, sisha, arabic food and tons of younger folks. If you like mezze and dips, you must go. I had an office here for 4 years and loved. I really wanna move back."
,,Great Bars and shopping,5.0,,We Go out in Arab street durring the day for the nice little boutique shops expecially on Haji Lane. Its a nice change of pase from the standard Singapore Malls. At night it is a great place to grab a drink or smoke some shisha.
,,Something different about Singapore,3.0,,"I was very surprising when I saw the Sultan Mosque and Arab Street in Singapore. The street is not very long but this architecture was interesting. This is a good place for buyers garments of type Middle Eastern. But it was not cheap, something different to Singapore. I'd like more if it has little more rich food and beverage outlets."
,,Textiles abound!,3.0,,"I am not into textiles, rags or Far Eastern or Middle Eastern garments so I had to just quickly stroll in this area. It is just next to our hotel so I decided to see what is in the area. This is a good place for oriental rag buyers and those that fancy Middle Eastern type of garments or clothing. Not my cup of tea though."
,,Interesting place to visit,4.0,,"This is one place i find in singapore interesting to wander around, shop and get a good coffee or tea. At night it turns to be a hangout for people who loves shisha session.."
,,Arab Street,4.0,,"Enjoyed walking around Arab Street, it was a pleasant surprise to see the Mosque, lovely buildings and shops. A much needed break from the modern buildings of Singapore"
,,cultural diversity & fab shopping,4.0,,"Food is amazing can smoke sheesha nice place to hang out good bars too (blue jazz being just one of them) Fab shopping, boutiques and unique items galore on Haji Lane. Worth a looksee!!!"
,,Great Heritage hangout,4.0,,"Great heritage corner in Singapore. Arab Street one of the few conserve area in Singapore with colonial times building still being kept.
Great place to hangout for meals, shisha with their wide selection of restaurants.
A number of new boutique hotels has open up in recent years as well to add in more accommodation choices for people who want to see a different side of Singapore than just shopping along Orchard road."
,,good dining and great shopping,4.0,,"I really enjoyed the Arab Steet. I spent half a day just walking around in tiny streets, shopping in their lovely boutiques, and just enjoying the colored building and stores. I ate at a Turkish restaurant. The food was great. I also visited a cafe and had some refreshing Iced Moroccan tea. (it's a must on a hot day). Would definitely return here!"
,,Nice photos,5.0,,"Good for a walk through, nice view of the mosque in the background. At night the restaurants are packed. We visited the area during the day and night, happy both times. Lovely terrace shop fronts. There are a few streets nearby also worth walking through such as Haji Lane and Bussorah lane so when coming to Arab Street walk through these streets - there are funky retail stores, mexican restaurants and shisha bars."
,,something different about Singapore,4.0,,"You can cover this area in half an hour because it's only a few short streets. You'll won't find tour groups here, but solo/free &easy travellers taking pictures.
Very colourful area. You'll find Singapore's narrowest road, wall art, lots of Halal food outlet, even a Swiss Halal Bistro.
It's different during the day and at night. Go there late afternoon to just laze, smoke shisha and drink Turkish coffee/tea. At night, chill-out crowd (no alcohol here) spills over to sidewalks and roads."
,,Good Old Days,5.0,,"This is an area of Singapore that has been much the same since I lived in Singapore 40 years ago, and on all subsequent visits since. The merchants are friendly and the variety of goods amazing."
,,Disappointment,2.0,,"Considering others areas of Singapore, this area may be worth a visit if your stay is more than 3 days. The area was smaller than expected and had very little variety to offer. The majority of the stores are fabric and cliché souvenirs. Architecture was somewhat interesting but overall did not feel welcomed."
,,nothing much,1.0,,I seriously don't see why you would want to be here and waste your time away. Unless perhaps you are getting lots of cloth?
,,Good Food Annoying smokers.,3.0,,"restaurants are great , but the constant shisha smoke is annoying. I was taken aback when I saw a couple smoking the shisha with 3-4 daughter was sitting with them."
,,Not worth the trip,2.0,,"After arriving to Arab Street walking from Little India, I was expecting more than what I saw. In fact, I kept wondering if there were two Arab Streets and I was on the wrong one? Sorry, find nothing interesting about fabrics or carpets (as one other reviewer stated), and I have to say there was nothing intriguing about it whatsoever. Hated to waste the 20 minute walk! Do not recommend."
,,Quite tedious unless you are heavily into fabrics or carpets!,3.0,,We found a good Turkish restaurant in Arab Street: Sufi's Corner. Ideal for a spot of lunch after browsing the shops. Delicious and authentic Turkish food. Don't miss the humous or the freshly baked Lavash bread.
,,worth a visit but with reservations,2.0,,"Like a lot of places in Singapore this area has become cliched. A lot of tourist stuff that you can find anywhere in SEA & not much else. Arab street used to be good for fabrics, but not any more. I think some of the smaller side streets are more interesting."
,,"Fun, quirky",4.0,,"While you are around Arab Street, definitely do the following: 1. Walk around the area 2. Eat at Nasrins 3. Grab a Mango Margharita at Piedra Negra; and 4. Browse the cool shops, boutiques and buy some belly-dancing costumes"
,,A Great Alternative In Singapore,5.0,,"There are many places to eat in Singapore, more than any one person can reasonably be expected to experience, Arab Street is one that should be on everyone list. A huge range of restaurants, some very good shopping if that's your thing and the atmosphere in the evening is comfortable and welcoming. There is a full array of Persian/Middle Eastern option as well as some not so Middle Eastern, however if you do fancy an alcoholic beverage be weary as many respectfully only serve soft drinks and teas. Definitely worth a visit, we've had many meals there in many of the restaurants and never been disappointed."
,,Neighborhood has a lot of character.,4.0,,"I enjoy looking at the shops here although I don't think I have ever purchased anything. If you are interested in visiting the mosques, just make sure to check the timings."
,,Great area to explore and find treasures,4.0,,"Arab street is one of my favourite haunts in Singapore where you get great food, great shopping all in a street."
,,My favourite place in Singapore,4.0,,"Of the 3 ethnic/cultural based suburbs i.e. Little India, Chinatown and Arab Street, I rate Arab Street as my favourite followed by Chinatown, followed by Little India. And I'm Indian, so...

I love Arab Street for its shopping - if you haven't visited the boutiques in Haji Lane and around, you're missing something. I love it for its food - great Middle Eastern cuisine and local Malay food. And I love it for its ambience - come here after sunset and take a walk around to see what I mean."
,,Interesting place to shop and soak up the atmosphere,4.0,,Have always loved visiting the shops and immersing myself in the culture. Many interesting items for sale in the shops which one cannot find in the new spanking malls.
,,enjoy the unique names in kampong glam,4.0,,"what i like here is enjoy the middle-east sense around the area. can be read arab street, bussorah street to name a few. also their culinary, just like briyani rice, mint tea to murtabak. giving a different colour about singapore."
,,The roots to Islam in Singapore,4.0,,"This was not Arab Street for nothing, it was the cradle of islam in Singapore. Here the Sultan Mosque is the oldest, along with other mosques. Islam Purists be warned though...this place has been turned into a commercialized tourist zone, full of pubs and shisha"
,,"Carpets, Textiles, Hookahs and Mint Tea",5.0,,"Brilliant! What fun for a Ladies ""day out"" of exploring and shopping with equal amounts of culture and commerce. It's clean, peaceful and there are plenty of shops, restaurants and the most beautiful and largest Mosque in Singapore. A must visit!"
,,Its worth the visit,3.0,,"I am not a frequent visitor to this part of Singapore, but its worth the visit if you can get there. A mixture of food, shops, and some of the old feeling of Singapore that has been progressively removed over the years. Nearest MRT access would be Bugis on the East-West Line or Nicoll Hwy on the Cirle Line."
,,Just a good place to go,5.0,,Excellent place. Arab feels so strong. just a place to relax
,,A real Singapore experience,5.0,,"With so many glitzy shopping malls in Singapore, Kampong Glam is a great place to visit (not just Arab Street). Try the Tulang Merah at the corner restaurant right opposite the main temple, but take a packet of tissues - you'll get very messy."
,,Don't need to spend much time here,4.0,,Head for the little pedestrianised road that leads to the mosque and hang out for coffee and lunch - no booze .... sit outside and people watch ....
,,My heaven in Singapore!,5.0,,"We should gives the collective name of 'Kampong Glam' for this area surrounding as the actual attraction is not only limits to Arab Street itself. The Kampong Glam has shed its sleepy image with the entry of stylish boutique and cafes, but its Malay and Middle Eastern essence can still be felt in the dignified mosque and traditional businesses. There's few streets adjacent to this Arab Street like Bussorah Street whereby you can view the whole image of elegant Sultan Mosque, Kandahar Street, Haji Lane and Bali Lane. Sultan Mosque is the most beautiful landmark around this area. Very photogenic landmark! At the end of Haji Lane, you also can take picture of the colourful building. I have been to this area for twice and definitely I must visit this area whenever I drop by Singapore. In order to reach here, the nearest MRT Station is Bugis Station and just walk straight along Victoria Street where it can leads u all the way to Arab Street."
,,What a fantastic chilled out atmosphere enjoying the service from Alan and staff (Leon) and the shisha! One of our best experien,5.0,,I would come back each night to enjoy the ambiance that it offers - good service - good shisha - good food. We had done many hawker centers in and around Singapore and also enjoyed al la carte dining but nothing beats the chilled atmosphere of people gathering here on the cnr of Baghdad st and Arab st. Open ur mind up and experience what Arab street has to offer! ( also check out Sufi's Turkish cadge and haji lane).
,,Nice young and emerging designers' works in Singapore,5.0,,"You can finda a lot of shops carrying yound and emerging local designers. If you are interested in fashion, you should visit this district."
,,Culture and fabric in one place,4.0,,Singapore has sanitized much of its history but it still exists on Arab street. Stalls sell a wide array of beautiful fabrics and cater to local Muslim and Pernakan tastes. You can also concoct your own perfume or lounge with a Hukkah pipe.
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,"Like all of Singapore a bargain hunters paradise, the small shops and little streets (more like lanes) prices are very cheap and the people here very helpful, I always go here when in Singapore looking for unusual gifts, so far everybody has been please with I have brought back"
,,"Simple, quiet and cheap",4.0,,"This is by far one of Singapore's relatively unexploited gems. Old mosques and shophouses still remain here albeit a little touristy in some sense. You could probably find a cheap hotel, a cafe to chill and some cool clothings or shopping while you're here!"
,,Great place to bargain,4.0,,Looking for some presents? This is one of the places where to be! Visit the many stores and have lunch/ dinner in the area. Many restaurants are really good. Enjoy!
,,Vibrant at night,5.0,,In the day time this heritage area is quiet and dull. But after 6pm it become very vibrant and there are a lot eateries to try different cuisines.
,,Nice area to visit,5.0,,This area is made up of a lot of buildings from colonial Singapore so it has a historical flavor that is hard to find in mostly sterile Singapore. Many nice resturants and textile shopping.
,,a totally different experience,4.0,,"Arab street is within walking distance from Bugis MRT. Some of the streets (like Bussorah street) are pedestrian area.
Wander into the area and you will be amazed how different the atmosphere is. Some of the small streets (e.g. Hadji) host upcoming Singaporean designers. at night, these streets are turned (with the help of some carpets on the pavement) into areas where you can hang around, smoke a water pipe, have a drink. there are a number of good middle eastern restaurants, and often good live performances at night. Have your dinner around 7 pm and hear the muezzin call for prayer. His songs resound in the small streets and are very touching. Most restaurants are alcohol free (it is a muslim area), but that shouldn't stop you. I love this area and visit it almost weekly"
,,Favorite place,5.0,,"I love arab street, so much to do there. It always my favorite chill out place. Everything is affordable! Good place to chilll."
,,Bryabi1,4.0,,"I like all the small shops with the colourful fabrics and haggling for a good deal, and some of the other streets around the area are good to explore as well."
,,Hidden Gem!,4.0,,"Loads of little bars and restaurants hidden away in close proximity to the city centre, more likely to find locals here than tourists. ""Blu Jaz"" is very cool for drinks and live music."
,,Exciting place,4.0,,"Singapore is 1/3 Indians so going to Arab street is like being in India. Arab street is lined with little shops all bursting with Indian goods--textiles, jewel rises, spices, food handicrafts etc. And the best part is that you can haggle ! Try the eateries that line the street. Authentic Indian food.

Don't go there on Sundays. It's packed with expatriate Indians and it is difficult to get a cab.

Don't miss the temple. The entrance archway is beautiful"
,,For a Change of Pace Visit Kampong Glam,5.0,,"The neighborhood around Arab Street is knowns as Kampong Glam. Starting at Ophir road on the West, there are some really nice restaurants such as Blue Jazz, as you might imagine with great music, and Piedra Negra, our favorite Mexican Restaurant, where you can get fish tacos. Haji lane comes alive in the evening with trendy boutiques and shops. Arab Street itself is known for fabrics and carpets. Visit the shops for Indian batique and colorful silks. One street in from there is a nice pedestrian street that leads to the historic Mosque. Try some mint tea and there are some great Turkish restaurants if you go toward Beach Road. It has busy vibe on Friday and Saturday night with young hipsters sitting on carpets, chatting and smoking Shisha pipes and snacking on kebabs."
,,Great middle eastern food and fun atmosphere.,4.0,,"The mosque was nice, but the highlight is the large number of restaurants and funky night atmosphere."
,,"Something new, something old",4.0,,"Well, would have been more interesting if they hadn't done it up ... but they have, so it's great for tourists. Worth a visit ."
,,From an earlier era.,5.0,,"Arab Street has been in Singapore for decades, and is one of the 'must see' places of the older areas. It retains it's attractiveness, glamour, and wealth of merchandise. It is definately one of the areas that a good tour includes."
,,Arab Street tour,5.0,,"Wonderful fabric, rug, and basket stores. Be prepared to bargain."
,,Great Food & Cafe's,4.0,,Had some really great food in some old colonial houses very very quite an nice
,,"Great cultural treat, plus unique shopping opportunities",4.0,,"Really enjoyed the shops and the flavor of this neighborhood. Pashminas for all my friends!! Friendly Persian carpet sellers!! Very difficult to leave without a house full! Lovely cafes, can't wait to return."
,,Good one with friend in the evening,5.0,,"Many bars, many types of food, mostly medetarranian (spanish, maroccan, lebanse, greek, egyptian, turkish). Soccer games on large screens + sound at Bali street. Good promotions, also after happyhour"
,,Great area to hang out and see,5.0,,I am very happy that the government did not interfere with this area to much and left it to develop by itself and finds its charactor. I think there are lots interesting ships to browse around and great food in the day time and in the evening. Must visit place
,,A heritage that mixes cross-cultural history,5.0,,"The buildings around Arab Street are a national heritage and are protected landmark. Judging by the names of other streets nearby Arab Street, places like Kandhar Street, Muscat Street, Bussorah and Baghdad Street, one would tend to think you're somewhere in the middle-east. You won't be wrong considering the number of middle-eastern and Turkish restaurants and shops around that offer exotic meals including sheesha. Other local delicacies makes this place a mecca for eating, shopping and visiting historical buildings including the famous Sultan Mosque.

Definitely worth visiting and savoring the delicacies."
,,Great place to come at night,5.0,,A lot of great restaurants for any budget. The place is very lively and young. The Mosque is also very beautiful.
,,Too commercialised,2.0,,"Sometimes when you overdo the renovation, the place loses its original colours. When I travel,I'd stray away from the malls but look for the small shops and lanes by the streets. But it's totally a turn off when you start to see things you could find at JJ market and Bali...."
,,fashionistas meet foodies,4.0,,"new and old, fashionistas vs foodies. wander through every lane. there will be pleasant surprises"
,,Great Alternative Flavour- Great for afternoons or evenings,4.0,,Take a stroll & have a 'teh tarik'. Rows of 'shisha' smokers would be lining the streets. Check out the older looking cafes for the real flavours.
,,Worth a visit for genuine stuff,3.0,,"Carpets - but watch the figures, cloth from India eastwards - excellent, Malay and Indian souvenirs, relax - take in the bright colours = nice."
,,Fabrics as far as you can see,5.0,,As well as the fabric shops look through the ajoining streets for interesting shops and sights.
,,Same same but different,3.0,,"Lots and lots of shops selling sari's, material, tailor shops etc. There are a couple of basket shops and one with lovely lamps and light shades but it's much of a muchness. I'd combine that with a visit to Bugis Street and Bugis Junction, plus Kampong Glam."
,,good place for food,4.0,,This is a great place for middle eastern food and shisha. It's open late.
,,Quaint enclave,4.0,,A little hippy corner with cool hang-out places for food and chic shopping in small shops.
,,Probably a nice thing to do but would not say must see...,4.0,,"Nice food, atmosphere, bars, and mosques... This is where the famous Zam Zam's sites... They have two sites to allow for all the visitors so if one is busy go to the next down the road. Alot of pipes and interesting views here..."
,,Arab Street and Haji Lane - Great Places to See A Bit of Old Singapore,5.0,,"If you are ready to get out of the malls of Orchard Road then head to Arab Street where there are lots of old shop houses to marvel at and small shops selling hajibs, fabrics and souvenirs. There is a really cool shop selling aromatics called Sifr on Arab Street - you can blend your own aroma with the help of their resident perfumier. Their perfume bottle collection was mind-boggling! Running parallel to Arab Street is Haji Lane. It's a charming pedestrian thoroughfate lined on both sides with charming shop houses which were an eclectic mix of small boutiques selling street fashion and quirky accessories. The street is also filled with Arab tearooms where you can have coffee, tea or hookahs. The aroma of apple tobacco perfumed the air. There are small cafes as well where you can get a bite to eat. My favourite shop on the strip is called Pluck - they have nice gift items and an ice cream parlour on the side."
,,Wonderful Golden Mosque and Great Carpets,4.0,,We love this part of Singapore with its carpet sellers and the golden mosque with the call to prayer. It has changed though and used to be more authentic with the food and shops in the square near the mosque. A bit too touristy now and shops a bit chinese crappy
,,Eats galore...,4.0,,"We loved eating out in Arab St...our choices were Morrocan & Lebanese. The best food & aromas! The shops are well & truly worth a look. This is hawker domain, but we did not have any problems."
,,Shopping shopping shopping!,5.0,,"A great place to shop and eat. Jewelry, clothes, handbags and cool ornaments are endless."
,,Good if you know what you want,3.0,,"if you just want to wonder this is not the place, you need to have and end to this trip, something you are looking for,mostly textiles."
,,Awesome place to shop,5.0,,I bought something for all the girls in my family!! Pashmina's for all!!!
,,Nothing Arabic about Arab Street,2.0,,"Despite of the name, there is nothing about it Arabic. It is manly Turkish and Persian. I walked there with my wife and our experience of the oriental culture was not authentic. I have been to Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and most of the Gulf countries. The food was not good and too pricey. If you end up visiting Arab Street, you shouldn’t have high expectations, nor believe that you have experienced a true oriental culture."
,,Good place for some photo ops and shopping....,3.0,,"Arab Street is not thronged like Little India and Chinatown (as other reviewers have mentioned). It is far more relaxed and pleasant to walk around. Add to that, at the end of the street is the Sultan Mosque which is probably the most beautiful in Singapore. That all being said... this place is only mildly interesting and is very commercial. If one had very limited time in Singapore, I am not sure I would put it high on the list. ""Pleasant"" is the word that comes to mind to define this place..."
,,Shisha Street,4.0,,you would want to go there for Shisha and a cool beer after the sun sets
,,Usman Resturant,4.0,,Very good and economical food at Usman Resturant Arab Street.
,,Oasis,5.0,,"As a citizen of S'pore, since last year, Kampong Glam is my favorite place to go to. Much more tranquil than Little India or Chinatown. Friendly, great shopping and lots of really good restaurants. A neighborhood I tend to return to, especially with our visitors."
,,Interesting,4.0,,A little crowded but interestin history and shopping. Lot's of tectiles in the area as well as ethnic eateries.
,,Only takes 15mins to walk down Arab Street,5.0,,"If you want silk scarfs shawls,materials,carpets,rugs,tablecloths, then this is the place to go. Then half way down the road on the right is a very impressive Sultan Mosque which you can enter if you have your head covered ladies and no shorts for both sexes."
,,WOW!,5.0,,"Ok, i enjoy walking and having food options, so this place was pretty perfect for me, i need to explore the area a bit more, but hey its an amazing place with great smells and very nice people. :D"
,,Get away to a place where locals hang out,5.0,,"If Clark Quay and Boat Quay feel too touristy for you, then head out to Arab street. Great music scene, lots of good of restaurants, bars, all with their own funky flavor."
,,sultans area,5.0,,the theme there is of central asia and arab. the outdoor restaurants are nice if u hav a group. and spend the hours there.. juz chatting. the view of sultan mosque and inside is magnificient. one of the best mosques i nthis part of world. cheap souvenirs r also there. and their price is much lower than chinatown even.
,,best value in town,5.0,,"Very nice area, full of fun little bars. reasturants and shops. Prefered this to clark quay and felt more real that the rest of clinical Singapore. well worth a few hours"
,,Nice vibrant atmosphere,5.0,,Lots of places to do Sjisha. I especially like Blue Jaz
,,Has become rather commercial & touristy,3.0,,It used to be a quaint and interesting street lined with unique stores and shops and restaurants. But is now bars and tourist traps. At least there are still a number of well preserved shop houses.
,,For buying fabric,4.0,,"My friend was on a search for fabric to bring back to the US and Arab St. was recommended by our hop on hop off tour driver. We found a huge selection of fabric in many stalls; there were few tourists when we went so while vendors were eager to make a sale. all were courteous and not pushy. After purchasing, we walked to the corner & caught another bus, which was very convenient, as we may not have gone there specifically on our own."
,,always a fun area to visit,4.0,,great for an cool walk... the shops and people are interesting and set apart from most of Singapore.
,,good place to buy gifts,4.0,,The Arab street has beautiful shops. We bought interesting gifts and objects for our home from there.
,,Good Christmas stocking fill to buy.,4.0,,Lot of shops are selling same items. So don't care which one. Good cheap stuff to fill Christmas stocking.
,,A world away from Chinatown & Little India,3.0,,Soend an hour strolling the streets of carpet and fabric sellers around the Sultan mosque. Quiet compared with everywhere else in Singapore.
,,An Aladdin's cave of delights,5.0,,This trip to Singapore was the first time we'd been to Arab street. This was an Aladdin's cave of delight's here and some very beautiful architecture. We ended up dining at the 'Pyramid' Egyptian restaurant in Baghdad street where the food was incredibly tasty and reasonably priced. Outside in the street cafes there were middle-eastern gents and ladies puffing on 'hookah' pipes and drinking Arabic coffee. This district is a great place to go if you want to buy some beautiful fabrics or middle eastern ob-jet d'art. There is also a beautiful mosque with a golden dome in this area (Sultan Mosque) so take along your camera.
,,also another must do/see,3.0,,if u are in singapore this should also be on your itinerary...worth the effort. good photographing oppurtunities...
,,"Really Safe, lovely evening stroll",4.0,,"After having visited Singapore numerous times over the past few years I can't believe I haven't made it to Arab Street before now.

As the name implies it is the Arab Quarter of Singapore, and home to many traditional Arab retailers - Carpets / Silks / Suits etc.

We went for a walk in the early evening through the area from the Mosque at the top through to Baghdad street.

We stopped at a lovely little Turkish Restaurant and enjoyed some amazing Hommus and Bread whilst enjoying a Shisha Tobacco Pipe. The owner of the place came and sat next to us and we had a great chat about Singapore.

Explore the area walk down all the little laneways, the area is having a bit of a revival of sorts, many young hip designers appear to be opening stores in the old market houses. Some great little hole-in-the-wall restaurants mean there are plenty of options for you to stop along the way and have a drink and a bite to eat.

We returned during the day to visit the Mosque and some of the vendors who were not open during the evening.

It is quite safe, you might get bugged by the odd restaurant tout trying to get you to come eat, but in general they are all polite and respectful.

Enjoy yourself!"
,,unique area for shop,4.0,,I love shopping in this area because so many stuffs that I cannot find back in my country and mostly unique stuffs
,,visit the mosque,4.0,,recommend visiting the mosque. They will provide an overcoat if you are in shorts / immodest dress. A really interesting exhibition about islam.
,,Authentic experience of the Arab / Muslim quarter,4.0,,"Small area but plenty to see and enjoy. Great eating places. Try the Biryani and Roti John and Pratas. The mosque is beautiful. If your religious convictions permit it, then go inside. if you are looking for a carpet, go to Amir and Sons. He has some great antique pieces. A few left only as I bought the rest:)"
,,Step back in time to a quiet oasis,4.0,,"Hidden from the bustle, Arab Street is part of the unique blend that makes up Singapore. It offers the perfect morning's outing as you wander around the area. Use the Tourist Office recommended walking tour. It takes about 1.5 hours and gives you all the best sites. But at the end take a seat and have a Turkish coffee and listen to the rustle of leaves as you while away your morning."
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"Lots of fabric shops along this strip so heaven for sewers, carpets on sale too. worth a visit to get the feel of being somewhere other than the big city that modern Singapore has become and lots of interesting foods to sample along the way."
,,"Still old Singapore, lots of charm",4.0,,"A fair bit of Singapore has been extensively modernised but not around here, this still feels like the old Singapore of 30 years ago and all the better for it. A charming market to just wander around in and let yourself be surprised by some of the fairly odd things they still sell."
,,great place to hangout till the wee hours of the morning,4.0,,"this place is near the raffles hospital and near hotel landmark village and it feels just as if you are in the gulf, many iranian/lebanese restarunts who serve food and shisha ( hookah ) as well. and they mostly open upto 3 am depending on inflow of customers. many pubs and bars also."
,,Want a rug?,5.0,,"Plenty of Rugs and Carpets, Material and good quality ornament shops all at reasonable prices. Plenty of restaurants around to. Don't forget the back roads just off of Arab Street."
,,Avoid it!,1.0,,"There's nothing ""Arabic"" about Arab street except for the seesha smoke. The place is quite dingy in the night and overcrowded by westeners who probably think that this is ""Arabic culture"". Having lived in Dubai for a decade I can vouch for the fact that this is not what ""Arab Street"" should look like. Avoid it unless you have nothing better to do."
,,Best Shop,5.0,,If you can find Dillip about a half way along Arab Street -lovely range of textiles at really good prices. We always visit him when in singapore
,,very good experience,4.0,,"near to villa Bugis, shopping , dining experience, many restaurants from many countries"
,,A must go and live in Singapore,5.0,,"This is my favorite area. I never saw an Arabic area clean like this, but well, that's Singapore. There are so many cafe and bars very cozy, you would like to try all of them. Try Alaturca Restaurant, the most amazing turkish food I ever had. A poular chouce for lunch is Fika Cafe too, well it is Swedish, but good for lunch and coffee, great cakes! Go to Blue Jazz bar at night, lovely indoor and alfresco playing Jazz tunes."
,,Arabic/Turkish food here as well as Indian/Vege,3.0,,Near The Raffles hospital but have to get across the busy street of traffic lights. Once there it is in a quiet area with a row of coffee bars and bistros. Humus and falafel vegetarian can be found here -just ask around.
,,A hint of Middle East in the South East !,3.0,,"Firstly, u got to ask someone if this really is Arab street.. coz on the face of it, it doesnt look like an 'Arab' street.

But once u get into the bylanes, u come across a lot of quaint little shops selling clothes with a middle eastern look & feel to them ..

the area is not very big & can be covered on foot in an hour or two .. its close to Little India too, so a nice stopover before the Mustapha mega-stop :)"
,,Halal/Kosher food here,3.0,,"I have restriction in eating, due to religious belief. So, it;s nice to find a place abroad that can cater my needs, with various options."
,,"Great food, music and hookah",4.0,,"One of my favorites in Singapore. Great food, outdoor seating, life, music and hookah. Good for lounge feeling nightlife."

,,Wander down in the evening,4.0,,"I spent a pleasant evening wandering arounf the Arab quarter, chatting to the locals and even looking for a spot for dinner. Not as hectic as Chinatown or Little India. It makes for a very nice diversion for a couple of hours."
,,Fabrics and...,3.0,,"Decent place to shop, but only spend about 30 min there, unless you're looking for rugs and fabrics. That's about it."
,,unique shopping and food experience,4.0,,"Arab street is located in Kampong Glam area; which is home to the famous Sultan Mosque. The area is filled with rows and rows of textile shops and some carpets stores. On Bussorah Street just beside Arab Street you will find shops selling curios such as malay traditional slipper (Capal), traditional weapon (keris) tradtional hand puppet (wayang kulit) and lots more. A small Muslim art shop can also be found at Jalan Pisang.

Restaurants are abundant in this area (mostly halal) though the Malay Restaurant tend to cater to the lunch crowd and close at 6 or 7pm. The middle eastern restaurants are open till late.

Take your time to explore this area with a comfy slipper and clothes and do avoid the time when the sun is most scorching.

,,Really nice...,4.0,,"The arab street is a wonderful place for those who enjoy shopping...u get almost everthing there, including carpets, textiles and souvenirs...i found it much better than the famous bugis junction..."
,,Don't miss visiting the Arab Quarter,5.0,,"Kampong Glam (the Arab Quarter, where Arab St is located) is, in my opinion, an incredibly underrated part of Singapore. I've been surprised at the number of people I've spoken to who have visited Singapore and who haven't heard of the area. It is well worth the visit, in order to experience the distinctive Middle Eastern ambiance, which can be so hard to find outside of the Middle East. We had an enjoyable lunch of authentic kebabs in the Bussorah Pedestrian Mall near the Masjid Sultan, the nearby Mosque, and we were fortunate to hear the call to prayer while we were in the area. We will definitely be back on future visits to Singapore. Kampong Glam is a relatively easy walk form Bugis MRT station"
,,Interesting Kampong Glam,4.0,,"Arab Street is part of the conservation area of Kampong Glam made up of Bussorah Street, the main thoroughfare, Baghdad Street, Kandahar Street n Muscat Street. It has many restaurants n good n cheap eateries, shops that sell carpets, textiles, clothings, jewellery, souvenirs, bookstores, rattan baskets, etc. U can even find a peranakan n teddy-bear shops there! Amazing."
,,Shisa Heaven,4.0,,"If your into Shisa than this is differently a place to check out. Arab Street is another side of Singapore that tourist should consider checking out for good food as well as many shops selling cloth, carpets, clothes and Islamic books and crafts. But mainly i went there to hang out with friends and smoke some shisha.... it was good times."
,,The Muslim area of Singapore,4.0,,"We have visited Little India a lot in our trips to Singapore and this time we also wanted to try out Arab Street.

In the nineteenth century, Arab Street was a bustling trading centre taking place at the rows of shop houses all closely cluttered.

The area is dominated by the Sultan Mosque which was built in 1928 and designed by an Irishman. The mosque was rather busy on our day of visit as it had a function so there were stalls selling food amongst other things.

Surrounding the mosque are various traditional shop houses selling a variety of traditional goods ranging from cloth, carpets, clothes and Islamic books and crafts.

Along side there are Malay Indian food sellers serving halal food. We tried some dishes in a restaurant run by a gentleman from Pakistan but had worked for some years in Mauritius before heading for Singapore.

It makes for nice contrast with the Little India part of Singapore and gives you a chance to see some traditional part of Singapore."
,,I love Arab Street-[- best by day or for dinner,5.0,,"Arab Street is a world unto itself. The mosque towers above it all, a beautiful shining dome. Great rug stores, silk shops, restaurants. We ate at an amazing Turkish place with a dish called ""The Priest Fainted."" After dark you may not want to be here alone as a single woman-- with a friend or any male it's fine, and actually the people here are very friendly. Go to the sales people who don't try to nab you off the street. You should not miss this if you go to Singapore, it is truly a treasure of sights, colors, smells and sounds. Beautiful."
,,"Love the colors, harmony, and halal food!",4.0,,"Arab street (Kampong Glam) is a different side of modern Singapore. It offers you Arab-Malay culture. I love the scenery of colorful buildings and shops, and it's very near to Sultan Mosque. Easy to find Halal foods. Moments I spent eating there and have a chit chat with my friends at afternoon was one of the best moment in Singapore. We ate at Kampong Glam Cafe :)
You can also find many kinds of souvenirs there. I bought 6 key chains for SGD 2."
,,"Arab Steet. Yes, best lunch in front of Sultan Mosque . A visit to Kampung Glem is a must .",4.0,,Few restaurants that offer Halal Food. Many shops selling sourvanoir items. Transport- by MTR or bus
