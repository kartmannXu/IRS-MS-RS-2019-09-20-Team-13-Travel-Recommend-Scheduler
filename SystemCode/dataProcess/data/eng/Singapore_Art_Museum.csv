,,Excellent Museum. Worth a visit!,5.0,,Really good and interesting museum. It explains more about the history of Singapore but in an interactive way. All the digital experience is amazing! I loved the cinema! The building is nice and their staff is friendly. If visiting Singapore is definitely worth to visit.
,,A must see!,5.0,,"This is such a graceful building that has been tastefully restored to house a wonderful vollection of general and cultural.
This building was once the Singapore seat of rule and law and its historic past can be imagined on the lawns at the front.
If you like a gallery...you'll love a visit here. I spent a day wandering through both buildings and had a very restful time soaking up the art. Take a break with tea and tea and finnish off with a cocktails in the upper bar and breathe in the view before you."
,,"Not Open, No alternative location, Singapore is more into Working, Shopping",1.0,,"Not Open, No alternative location, Singapore is more into Working, Shopping, Culture Nature and Heritage (exception is when related to the rulers since 1965) is not displayed on a secondary Location yet. Missed opportunity."
,,Wide-ranging collection of contemporary Southeast Asian art,4.0,,"I wasn’t sure quite what to expect in contemporary art at the SAM (Singapore Art Museum). It encompasses many types of creative modern art, such as photography, painting, sculpture, video, interactive exhibits, and others produced from the mid-20th century onwards. I think it includes almost anything that people would look at and find to be artistic and made with the hope that some would find modern, distinctive, and interesting to look at. The collection is nice, but for me not amazingly beautiful. However, I’ll rate SAM as Very Good, as I did find many of the very unique creative pieces to be artistic."
,,Pretty average - but mostly closed,2.0,,"Visited but they are midway through a relocation it appears - and the work on display in the new site was limited in scale and quality.

The staff in several exhibition areas were quite invasive following you around the exhibition which it quite difficult to absorb/enjoy."
,,Great for young children,5.0,,"We spend around 3 hours here with 2 younger children, they loved it. So interactive, even as adults we loved it. Discount given with Singapore Airlines ticket a bonus. Definitely a great morning out. The building and views are amazing."
,,quiet and peaceful,4.0,,"I stayed nearby this place when I came to visit it. It was an excellent recomendation by the lady I met at Sentosa. I asked her which was the nearest and convenient museum to visit and she suggested this place. I am glad that she did. Because in here, I found tranquility. The infrastructure of this place gave the vibes I was looking for. It was not pricey and senior citizens gets a discount. I am happy. Unlike the musem I visited at sentosa, it was just noisy. And too overrated. I am glad I found this place."
,,Brilliant flight,5.0,,"We flew with Singapore Air all the way to Sydney from London. We had a short stop over in Singapore on the way out but flew all the way back with a 55 minute stop, the staff were very attentive, hot towels, food and drink all the way, we flew premium economy which gave us just a little more comfort and space, food choice and bigger screens with noise reduction headphones, we slept most of the way home so they were obviously comfortable, I would highly recommend Singapore Air and would definitely fly with them again."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"We went there with high expectations but unfortunately most of it was closed and we went in anyways and saw basically three art designers with like a few work , maybe it was not the best time to visit it but we were disappointed"
,,Contemporary Art,5.0,,"President's Young Takents 2018 is on till end of the year before the museum closes for its revamp. Thought-evoking and fascinating art even for amateurs, they are for those who love to learn about the varied degree of affordable of different materials and methods for art. It's relaxing and inspiring. I hope the museum will consider to host more activities for the visitors to interact with the artists to understand the thought and processes in their art productions."
,,"Evaluation is related to frustration, not to SAM itself",1.0,,"After some walking under a hot sun, some doubts over the map, ....a guy at the main entrance informed the museum will be closed for a period o two years..."
,,Singapore Art Museum for Kids,4.0,,"We only went to the Future exhibit which is essentially all about the kids. There are 8 interactive displays which our kids loved. There Mare three displays where the projected display moves around this kids, ex a waterfall and if they stand it front of it it goes around them. There are 2 displays where you can color in various pictures such as cars and ships and then scan them. The picture is then displayed on the big wall. Kids got a kick out of seeing their picture up in the wall. A good way to pass 2 or 3 hours."
,,Old world charm building that was a mission school before.,5.0,,"Well lighted, clean, spacious and feels good. Good place for photography, an evening stroll and even an afternoon cuppa."
,,A good mixture of oldies n futuristic,3.0,,"Small muesum, well sectioned. Like level 1 the most particularly the painting of singapore map on the wall, specifically showing some prominent landmarks. Free admission to everyone on Friday, 6-9pm"
,,"Closed,we did not know",1.0,,"We wantend to visit the museum today but we were told at the entrance that it is closed for 3 years. Unfortunately we did not know, we had been walking from our hotel.. there is some exhibition in the national museum that we visited earlier.
There is a special exhibition for children that is still open."
,,I loved it so much,5.0,,"This place is awesome, i loved it so much the marvel museum. And this place attached to mal marina bay sands which is we are easy to find places to have lunch or dinner. We use public transportation to get here and it was bery easy, we take bus from garden by the bay only 15minutes."
,,An iconic building located near Orchard,5.0,,"You should come visit Singapore Art Museum if you are visiting Orchard Road. It’s located nearby at Bras Basah.

SAM is perfect for tourists visiting Singapore for the first time to learn more about Singapore’s history and heritage. It is situated at an iconic colonial building where it’s an experience for you to enter a preserved historic building in Singapore.

SAM is opened daily 10am-7pm with the exception on Friday which will operate from 10am-9pm. It costs $6 for Adults and $3 for Senior Citizen and Students. Free for children as well.

SAM also provide conplimentary guided tours in English, Mandarin and Japanese at selected timings and days."
,,Beautiful icon,4.0,,"You can visit here for study and sightseeing. Very cool, cozy, comfy. You can get knowledge here. Fit for backpacker also"
,,Main museum closed. Annex (Q8) waste of money,2.0,,"Unfortunately we found that the main museum is closed for renovation until 2021. The Q8 Annex is open, but costs the same as it would for the main museum even though it’s about a 10th of the size! Ok so it’s not a huge amount of money (6 SGD) but seems a ripoff to me!

The Q8 annex exhibitions are small and not very interesting in my opinion (not helped by the fact the place was overrun by small children running everywhere too!)

Personally I would save your money and put it towards the National Gallery or National Museum."
,,Excellent Exhibition,5.0,,"The SAM is conveniently located bear Bras Basah and within walking distance from Dhoby Ghaut. The building is colonial style and looks grand. There are also several eateries which are quite popular. If you are an art fan, you'll surely find something or the other art fair going on here."
,,Good exhibitions,4.0,,This is a big building and is a little confusing with it's layout. Pick up a map at the start and try to follow it ! There are some stunning interactive exhibitions on the ground floor and a good range of ancient and more modern art work. The cafe on the ground floor is clean and the food is OK. The bar on the top floor has good views over the local cricket ground and is a great place to sit on the balcony for a cocktail. It was a surprise to find such a bar in the gallery.
,,Art | History,5.0,,Worth a visit once you are in Singapore. Near to Orchard Street and well connected with MRT & buses as well.
,,Closed -- not obvious from web pages!,1.0,,"Sadly found this is closed -- with signs to an annex (Q8) that was supposed to be open...but was also closed until the next exhibition begins. Really odd not to have this information appear on the main web page, but it is not even clearly noted on the Visit web page either, which is very disappointing."
,,Architecture exhibition,3.0,,At moment there is only exhibition of architecture on as main museum will only reopen in a few weeks
,,Worth visiting !,5.0,,A great art museum and certainly worth going to see when in Singapore. Staff were friendly and helpful. Toilets spotless.
,,OK Museum,3.0,,"When I visited the main building was closed and it was just the Cinerama exhibition that was open. It’s an ok exhibition, but it feels more like visiting a small gallery than a major museum. Perhaps it will be more worth a visit once the main building and permanent exhibitions reopen after the refurbishment is complete."
,,Worth Visiting,5.0,,We were here in January and had the pleasure of seeing the Impressionist display. This is a lovely gallery. Plan on spending several hours to enjoy the full experience.
,,Exhibition: Cinerama,4.0,,"Unfortunately the main building wasn't open so my admission (S$6)was only for the exhibition Cinerama.

Rooms on different floors featured the different artists.
To my surprise, there wasn't very many visitors... but it was ok for me as I got to take my time in each area.

All that was featured was definitely unique.
AK-47 vs M16, the film was an incredibly powerful piece.

Can highly recommend a visit no matter what the main feature is for an exhibition, as there is also the main building housing many more works of art (which I will save for another rainy day)."
,,Great institution. Amazing show,5.0,,"I went to see the ""Cinerama"" exhibition featuring Singaporean Artist Ming Wong.

Excellent show.

This is a great first stop if you are exploring the art scene as this is a contemporary art gallery/museum dedicated to art and ideas. This proves a good remedy to the very commercial art stuff you see in the mall ""galleries"".

Staff are extremely friendly/chatty and happy to advise on other places to visit.

Entry is a few $Singapore for non-Singaporean visitors.

I would spend at least an hour here. I spent the afternoon as the then current show was video work and required more time."
,,Temporarily closed,2.0,,Returned here yesterday without first checking if it was open. Unfortunately it wasn't: apparently it is temporarily closed in order to prepare for something else. But around the corner at 8 Queen street there is the Cinerama exhibition. This is a fairly small exhibition of contemporary cinematic techniques. We took the kids along but they weren't really that interested.
,,Closed but Cinerama Section Open,2.0,,"Singapore Art Museum is housed in the wonderful old building that used to be a school. In fact, I have mentioned before that the building was more beautiful than the art it contained.

It's closed for three years for renovations - so hopefully they will find some interesting items to include.

Across to the road to Cinerama - still part of SAM.

Video is not my Favourite form of art and I have limited appreciation. Notwithstanding some of the exhibits may appeal to some, whilst others were I believe universally boring.

Tromararama by Zsa Zsa Zsu - tales of button kaleidoscope effect - but with a fascinating element of amusement. Worth 10 minutes or so.

A white white day by Sharma - 2 minutes should suffice. Or you could skip it.

The propeller group give the presentation of a bullet shot through a gel substance. It also shows when two bullets meet. I remember encountering this methodology in forensic pathology many years ago, but the gel blocks serves to amuse and with altered lighting has appeal.

There is a film of 41 minutes duration full of non stop killing. It features comparisons of an AK-47 and a M16. The video is a composition of snippets from war films and features various conflicts. Some glorify war , some portray one sidedness. I am a pacifist and find war obnoxious - did I learn anything. Sure, it confirmed my original view that war was pointless and a process in which there are only losers and no winners. Gratification from killing and its amusement value is abhorrent - but that's just my opinion. Nice seating if you need to rest.

Sarah Choo Jing - Wear You All Night. Not if I have any say you won't!!!! Reminded me of being married - yucks! Summing up, it was histrionics and ritualism throughout, the kind of negativism local women exert when they don't get their own way. Miserable and dismal - my advice to the pair in the movie - get a divorce, get a life and enjoy. You only live once, so enjoy hedonistically.

Ming Wong: Making Chinatown - ridiculing relationships again. Boring.....

Nothing else worth a mention!

$6 entry. Free for locals - it would have to be as locals wouldn't go otherwise. Fair air conditioning. No elevator. Friendly and informative gallery guides. Overall - needs a breath of fresh air."
,,Closed: New installation starting 17Nov,3.0,,"The art museum is closed until 17Nov as the newest installation is being set up. I believe the new exhibit goes through December some time but if you're traveling in the next two weeks, save yourself the trip."
,,Worth visit with guided tour,4.0,,Our friends took us with a guided tour. Fantastic and definitely worth a visit. The guides are volunteers and very enthusiastic. The building itself is worth a visit as it was an old colonial building.
,,Must visit by Tourists - Good local paintings,5.0,,Review by Dr Sim. Recommend that tourists visit this museum. Many paintings. Old restored building. Used to be a school. Nice walk through air-conditioned environment.. Regards DrSim001.
,,"Singapore Art Museum is the nice place for relax, walking and enjoy the art.",4.0,,"When you arrive in Singapore Art Museum, you will find the beautiful building in front of you like you are in Europe. Around of art museum has food court, coffee shop and mini garden for rest and relax. This place also very good for wedding & couple photo taking."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,The main building is closed for renovations but the museum still exhibits in a smaller space - adults S$6. Interesting interactive installations by Asian artists and some great short films. Allow 1 to 2 hours for current exhibits.
,,More interesting than I would thought.,5.0,,Four or five floors packed with art displays by artists from all over the world. It was time well spent. Very hands on. I understand that it is a temporary facility at the moment. The main old colonial building is being revamped. Take the kids.
,,Great play ground for fairy tale,3.0,,"6$ paid admission for adults and 3$ for students at the SAM 8Q.
It's not big enough.
I found 7 hidden art works of small mushrooms at the corridor, hall, stairs, doorway and so on.
The place is like play ground with creative storytelling activities for children."
,,"Too many exhibits with ""no touch "" policy at 8Q",2.0,,"We visited SAM at 8Q for kids and with an autistic child, and 3 kids the museum had roo many rooms with a no touch policy . My poor child could ntoveveb drink from a water bottle at a table activity with many guards telling kids off constantly
The visit proved more stressful than necessary and would suggest more interactive rooms"
,,HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY CLOSED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS,3.0,,"You can go around the corner to 8Q, but this is rarely worth doing. SAM's main building is worth visiting when open, for both the art and the old school (1850s) former Catholic school it resides in.

Check the website first though, as the security could only tell me SAM was closed ""until further notice"".

Champions."
,,Confusing layout,3.0,,"It was Museum Day, so the entrance was free. I'm glad, as I would have been disappointed if we'd paid. We found the layout very confusing and the art average at best. We would not rush back."
,,Imaginarium exhibition,4.0,,"We go to SAM at 8Q. They have imaginarium exhibition. So colourful. Love the exhibition. Actualy the building is small. We spent about 1,5 hours for all the exhibition."
,,Good for contemporary arts lovers,4.0,,"The main museum was closed during my visit, which was a pity. Hence, I paid my visit to SAM at 8Q, which is free after 6pm on Fridays.
At the moment, they are having a theme ""Imaginarium"" and the art pieces showing were thoughtful, you may find some meanings inside those artworks. Yet, as it is now Children's Season, the museum may have kids around and it maybe a bit too noisy to appreciate the artworks quietly."
,,Some interesting exhibits,4.0,,"I came here with my 4yo for the Imaginarium. There are some interesting exhibits, but the one that she loves the most is a series of tiny photo's of Singapore embedded in resin scattered over a wooden floor. She borrows my phone and runs around taking 100's of photo's of them. And I'm not exaggerating. Worth visiting."
,,Great depending on the current exhibition,5.0,,"It is not a big musuem. So I would not plan on spending more than a couple of hours there.

Always check the hours and the current exhibition that is going on before going. This month (May 2017), the main building of the museum is actually closed for exhibition. Only the annex at 8Q is running Imaginarium."
,,Main Building Closed,4.0,,"The Singapore Art Museum consists of 2 buildings. The main building is now closed for a revamp that is slated for completion in year 2021. The second, smaller building known as SAM at 8Q is still open.

The current exhibition at SAM at 8Q is a children-focused exhibition titled Imaginarium: To the Ends of the Earth and is spread out across 4 floors. The exhibition is somewhat interactive in the sense that you can walk around and at times hunt for the installations. There are also some ways to be involved; one installation allows visitors to use an app to draw, and another invites visitors to create their own Floating Mountain using an egg carton.

Apart from the installations, SAM at 8Q also has a theatre called Moving Image Gallery that screens short films related to the current exhibition. I particularly enjoyed the animated short films.

Tips:

1. The Singapore Art Museum is 2 minutes' walk from Bras Basah MRT Station.

2. Since this is a small building, you can probably spend 1 to 2 hours here.

3. You can include SAM at 8Q as part of a museum tour, since other museums like Asian Civilisations Museum, National Gallery Singapore, and Singapore Philatelic Museum are all within walking distance.

4. There is an exhibition guide available for download at the official Singapore Art Museum website, which you can use to gauge your level of interest. If you would like more activities for children to participate in, check out the events and workshops."
,,Definitely Worth a Visit!,4.0,,"So, initially I had planned to go visiting some museums and art exhibitions in Singapore with this museum made it to the list. The exterior is so huge and cool! In this museum, they'll give you a sticker that you have to remember putting it in a visible area around your body throughout the visit. So each of the room's guard will be able to verify you as a visitor. I happened to go there around the Singapore art week (suprisingly). I think there was some kind of event held there that they even prepared some kind of free snacks for the visitors to grab. For the artwork itself, honestly I barely have knowledge in arts and exhibitions, but I do enjoy them. So far, I really enjoyed my visit there and every spot is picturable. I took tons of pictures in the museum. My most favorite room of this museum was the mirror room. It was really pretty! Even though everything was turning around and we had to share the small space with other visitors, but I love it. The entrance fee was also so much affordable compared to the art science museum. Of course, the two museums have different theme and purposes, but I guess you will enjoy this museum more if you like the conventional way of museums."
,,Closed until first week of May 2017,4.0,,Walked to the museum today from the JW Marriott to find it is closed until May 6th I believe. The security guard said they are changing an exhibit. I recommend checking on the hours before heading out.
,,Interesting place,4.0,,"There are different events going on from month to month, really interesting artwork. Place is suitable for adults, adults with kids or just solo travellers."
,,An Amazing Building,4.0,,"This is a very kid friendly space. They even have a separate room for kids to explore art. The exhibition I saw was stellar, and it was a great space. It was smaller than expected. Staff are friendly, and it's easy to walk around. Even someone with a disability could get around this place."
,,Must come back another time!,4.0,,"The entry was free when I visited - for reasons mentioned by previous reviewers, parts of the museum were vacant. I actually quite enjoyed walking through the empty rooms - the building itself is a landmark, it used to be a Catholic school. A lovely surprise: while exploring the building, I came across the little museum shop and was open, selling quirky gifts and books.
Will definitely revisit the SAM next time."
,,Excellent contemporary art,4.0,,"If you like contemporary art, this museum is highly recommended. A very short walk from Dhobi Gaut MRT station. It is actually located in two buildings, though I suspect many people find the main building is enough. I went to both buildings, which was really worthwhile. Both are very well laid out with room for quiet contemplation of interesting displays and interaction with multimedia pieces. Excellent toilet facilities and lift access available, but sadly lacking a decent cafe. There is a fast food place near the second building, but with the sorts of people visiting this museum a better shop and cafe would be a boon."
,,Peaceful respite,4.0,,"Not only is the building beautiful, the art displays were thought provoking and interesting. Many of them was interactive.
A big installation had just finished the day before I arrived, so there was only 3 halls open to visitors - all the staff apologized for this though it certainly wasn't their fault. They were all very friendly and knowledgeable.
Entry was free ( possibly because there was only 3 halls open)
If you are looking to spend some time out of the heat and bustle of the city- this is perfect!"
,,A must-visit but maybe once the restoration is complete,5.0,,Wonderful gallery for Contemporary Southeast Asian Art. Currently having some restoration in parts of the building so check the website for exhibitions.
,,An Atlas of Mirrors,5.0,,An Atlas of Mirrors is an exhibition. Went there with my school for a field trip. It's a great place to visit if you admire and appreciate art. (There's one part where only 18 year olds and above can enter though)
,,Local Art in a colonial school building,3.0,,"The artists are mostly from around the Singapore/Malaysia area. There are nothing from Europe or the Americas as one would expect. I, myself didn't feel engaged with the art, but that could be just me. I wasn't bowled over by the displays. One occupied a rather large room and was filled with burnt out wood pieces, supposedly resonating some ecological message? This is just one example where I failed to see the artistic value in the exhibition. The good thing about this museum is the building itself. In its former life, the building was a school for girls, if I recall correctly."
,,It's a different experience.,4.0,,"They have nice facility. We did not get to appreciate all the artwork because of time constraints in our schedule. It is worth the visit. The art pieces were very different, very creative, entertaining and creepy at the same time. Our 9 year old daughter got to appreciate it. Locating the exhibits in an orderly manner is not that easy. Some exhibits are for adults viewing only."
,,"Great Art Exhibitions, great building.",5.0,,"the main reason went to Singapore was to see this Biennale art exhibition and we were impressed. The exhibition is interesting, challenging and unique. Many installations are side specific meaning they can't move to other places which make it so unique. The building itself is a gem, it has been ver well preserved and air con so is good for any weather. There are so many rooms and many floors so make sure you get a map before you started to explore. The exhibition by disadvantaged kids which is up on the 3 rd floor right at the back of the building is very touching , we can see the kids making art with their mentors. This make me feel pretty lucky to have a healthy body."
,,Nice time,4.0,,"We have visited this museum with our 4Y son. Some rooms could be more full but we took very nice pictures of the pieces of art with our son in the middle. We had a nice moment, far from the rush of the center town."
,,"Even If Your Not The Arty Type ,, This You Should Not Miss ,,,",5.0,,"One of the easiest locations to find ,, directly out of Bras Basah MRT station ,, You are There ,,,
Staff Helpful and Welcoming,
The enclosed Pictures can not do the experience,, justice,, as impact and Sensory experiences of exhibits and installations were lasting.
My only criticism, is that , the galleries are spread out , on different levels , and not wanting to miss anything ,, doubting myself , looking at the map , just wish there were a continuous route line with arrows the floor , to direct you to all the galleries, ensuring you have not missed anything."
,,Informative & helpful staffs,5.0,,I visited the museum for the Singapore Art Biennale. It was such a great exhibition as there are deep and meaningful message in works. Love the staffs as they are well-trained so they can explain the works' concept and detail. The museum also has many lockers to deposit your belongings while enjoying works of art.
,,Great Art Shows,5.0,,We went to the Biennale and the experience was great. Staff are very friendly and helpful which makes such a difference! We also ate at the cafe there and the food was fantastic!
,,"Need Comfy Shoes To Explore, Explore, and Explore....",5.0,,"A really lovely surprise for me to learn that Singapore has an equally high quality art museum, as I normally only enjoy art museums in Amsterdam or London or New York City or Washington DC.

So very happy to explore this museum, even the museum offers fun interactive ways in engaging me to learn the history of each art object. The museum makes it a fun and amusing place to be at. Far from being boring. I needed more time, the next visit, I will make sure to be alone, and spend the whole day here, I hope.

I recommend those who would like to enrich themselves with the art world and find out that you do have the artistic flare in you, surprise yourself! There will always be the temporary exhibitions too. They are usually popular ones. Not to be missed.

I did not get the impression that the museum was old nor stuffy - on the contrary, I felt it was a pleasant, clean, and orderly. Easy to find your way around - the guidance and tours are there too, if you need it."
,,Excellent museum of thought-provoking art,5.0,,"If you like modern art with a message, this is a must-see museum. Artists from throughout Asia with extremely innovative, beautiful, and mind-challenging pieces of art. I was not expecting this caliber of works."
,,Fantastic staff!,5.0,,"Went to see the Biennale which was really really interesting anyway, but I was amazed by the level of interaction from very friendly and informative staff. I've been in art galleries all over the world and not had such well directed info. The building is small and beautiful in its colonial self, which makes the shows a compact experience. Be careful to keep going round the corners.....we nearly missed a chunk of rooms! It's over in March I think and is really worth it to see what contemporary artists of the region are up to."
,,one of my favorite places in Singapore <3,5.0,,"Being a fan of contemporary art I loved this museum a lot! At the time of our visit „5 Stars: Art Reflects on Peace, Justice, Equality, Democracy and Progress” exhibition was taking place saluting to Singapore’s 50 years jubilee and the five stars on the Singapore flag, representing universal humanist values.

I was highly impressed by „No Man” a 15 min six channel video installation with sound presented by Ho Tzu Nyen dedicated to Justice. It was the first stop of our visit. (After the guided tour I went back to experience this wonder again.) It is hardly impossible to describe my feelings about this masterpiece as it was so shocking and deeply moving. I still kept thinking of it after several months…. Special thanks to Ho Tzu Nyen for these miraculous moments.

Usually we prefer to discover places on our own but this time we decided to take a guided tour. What a great decision! Our guide was knowledgeable providing whole-hearted presentations of the items on display which added a lot to our tour in this great place.
I wish I could visit this museum again in future."
,,Good but small,4.0,,Overall a nice experience but there are not so many collections .Can visit if you are in the neighborhood
,,The exhibition is great but the mirror stair was closed during our visit,3.0,,"The museum was not too crowded and there was an atlas exhibition going on during our visit. However, the mirror stair was closed so we had only a glimpse shot of it. The rest of museum are okay, maybe i'm not an art-fan after all."
,,Great contemporary art museum,5.0,,"I met a friend who lives in Singapore here, & we both thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The museum houses contemporary art in a colonial building, which offers an interesting contrast. Currently, they have a Biennial exhibit, which was a terrific compilation of Southeast Asian art. They offer free guided tours in English, which added to the experience. We viewed many of the works before the tour and achieved a deeper understanding when we returned with the tour guide."
,,Very cool,5.0,,"We went here for some of the interesting displays from local and international students, some varying in ages up until 75. The displays provided various aspects of what they interpreted images and designs, was mind boggling."
,,Artsy brain stimulator,5.0,,"Visiting this museum really stimulates the artsy section in your brain! I love how they are sooo many installations from various artists around Asia.

There are 2 buildings thats separated so don't forget to go to the smaller one across the street - the exhibtion therr is really is as wonderful as the main building."
,,Very different,4.0,,A new experience for me in staff invigilating actively engaging with you offering to answer questions about exhibits.
,,Very different and interesting art,5.0,,A half day out of the sun and heat. Some really interesting and inspired pieces of art. My daughter has an interest in studying art and this exhibition helped her to understand that art is in everything. Really worth the visit.
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,We went there for an exhibition - 'Imaginarium' and the experience was very good and enriching. It was quite informative and the exhibits were very interactive and beautiful. there were several short films on display there which were quite touching. Recommended for kids.
,,SAM at 8Q,4.0,,"When they hold the special kids event at 8Q every year, we make it a point to go coz it's good fun for the kids. Lots of hands on activities , they get to doodle on the wall, do origami and other handicraft , 'play' with interactive art installations... Usually spend 2 hours. It's free for Singaporeans n SG perm residents : )"
,,Preparing for an exhibition so nothing to see,1.0,,"As the place is being set up for the Biennale, there really is nothing on offer at present. Perhaps 30 pieces, mainly photos. Nothing special at all. frankly, a waste of 30 minutes."
,,"Disappointed, but good for children.",3.0,,"Housed in two buildings. The main building was quite large, but a lot of rooms were closed off. Some of the exhibits were quite interesting, but there were not enough for such a large building.
The second building was across the street, contains several interactive exhibits for children.
Singaporeans and those holding PRs enter for free. Others are S$10.
I would recommend this for families with young children.
Take a walk around the neighborhood, lots of unique restaurants around."
,,Interesting place. Worth a visit,4.0,,Beautiful old building housing many different exhibition rooms. Exhibitions are temporary and change every few months. Worth checking before you go that it interests you. Free for Singapore citizens and permanent residents.
,,"Mostly closed down , very little to see.",2.0,,"We were very excited to arrange and attend.. Ground floor two exhibits open rest closed for special function.
2nd floor 2 small exit rooms open , rest closed for installation, 3rd floor closed for update.finally bundled off to building 8 down the road.. Childrens weak interactions exhibit,cartoons and small kids fun centre one beautiful old display of cultural heritage and another pertinent
Display of thousands of hanging ocean Rubbish pieces .
All so sad a wonderful old unique building feeding self egos rather than the community.
So wish 50/ off photos were really on show
Don't waste your money here,"
,,SAM at 8Q,5.0,,"Opposite the main art museum at Bras Basah stop, they have a branch for their children's museum called SAM at 8Q. I took our 17 month old there as a cheap (aka free for permanent residents but I think it's maybe 10 Sing dollars for non) outing. It's a fairly calm museum directed at young children. It was a great outing for a couple hours of kid centric exhibits including squishy whales to jump on, coloring areas, short films, books, lots of things hanging from the ceiling, etc. The exhibits change regularly and we went when it was the Imaginarium. There are also some eateries on site if you get hungry. For Americans, a couple blocks down the road there is a Baja Fresh which made my day, having not been stateside in a while. Good neighborhood for walking about without lots of crowds during the weekdays."
,,Amazing Building - Disappointing Exhibitions,1.0,,"I visited Singapore Art Museum before visiting National Museum and needless to say, i spent less than 1 hour there because i was disappointed by how bad the exhibitions were and there was basically nothing fruitful or interesting to see. I will not recommend this place to anyone who like museums."
,,Ask questions and be rewarded,5.0,,"With a bit of research this is museum easy to find (or take a taxi, so cheap, so friendly, so helpful). You will be well rewarded. Entry costs are so cheap as to be a steal (we got in as Seniors for $5 each). Exhibitions change regularly, we went when the theme was water, the sea). It was brilliant. In every section we asked questions of the ""attendant"". Every single person was enthusiastic, knowledgeable and eager to talk. I loved them. I felt inspired by each person. They are a credit to themselves, to the museum, to the artists and to Singapore and I felt a part of the exhibition and did not want to leave. One of my best experiences involving art anywhere in the world. I felt blessed and special."
,,Better than expected,3.0,,"Went with my 10 y-o daughter on a Saturday morning. To my surprise we were allowed to park right at the entrance of the museum as the old gentlemen at the entrance kindly remove the cone.

We went expecting paintings (due to my lack of research) and I was pretty worried my daughter's day will be spoilt when I learnt from the floor plan that there is hardly any painting....

However my worries were unnecessary once we stepped into the first display hall. My daughter was intrigued by the art work of an Indonesian artist depicting the geopolitical condition of Indonesia...

The theme of the exhibition was ""Odyssey - Navigating endless seas"" and there were numerous displays relating to sea, voyages, sea creatures, environment and how Man has harm the sea. There were many displays made from different materials - card boards, metal, old clothes and knitted. There were photographs and short films/ clips too.

The coolest display is a big display of the sea water made with thousands of small photographs of rubbish and yatches...

Another display which we liked was the big boat with lots of houses made of cardboard in it, which signifies migration of human race (if I remember correctly)

The children section is in a next building within short walking distance and is well worth a visit too.

There is this display of octopus knitted into different colours and sizes (my daughter says they look like aliens) and small yellow fishes hung from the ceiling as if they were swimming in the sea. There were also knitted corals and big whale-shaped sofa on the floor for the children to lay or sit on. The children were really enjoying themselves there.

The personnel/ volunteers there (a lot of senior citizens) were all very friendly and do not hesitate to share information.

All in all a good experience and my daughter had real fun."
,,Imaginarium visit...fun..interesting and it's free....,4.0,,We visited the SAM on friday around 5.30 pm. And we got information every friday at 6pm we can enter for free...so we wait and we can visit for free...it's fun..interesting...kids love it. There are 4 floors of exhibition. We like it
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Visited here with my father and was apprehensive at first, I don't usually like art galleries much, but throughly enjoyed this one. We did a free guided tour and our guide Susanne was just brilliant. Her knowledge of the art works and stories behind the artists and their exhibitions were so insightful and really added to the experience. The security attendants in each room were also so friendly, often offering different information about the pieces. I learnt so much more about Singaporean culture and identity through the eyes of these artists. There is a children's gallery too which is well worth a look for adults as well. Just $10 admission and free tours daily (check their website) this is great value. A very good rainy day activity for everyone, locals and visitors of all ages."
,,Maybe Art isn't my Thing,3.0,,"I thought I enjoyed art. Maybe it's just me but I did not like this place and there is no way I'm ever going back. I felt like the exhibits were either bad or just ok. The building itself is ok for displaying art. I was just not impressed by what I saw. I would definitely not take any visitors to Singapore there unless they really love art. I just didn't find this place to be interesting. I'm glad I went on a Friday night when it was free. If you're looking for something to do in Singapore, I would tell you to look a little more."
,,World Class !,5.0,,"I visited the museum the second time this year bringing my niece and nephew as well as my sister along this time round! It's such a great place, my family should not missed it! The buildings housing the museum ( the former City Hall and the High Court) are themselves iconic, seeped in history and the architecture special ! It's therefore a great idea that the museum has arranged for a free guided tour on the buildings themselves! The guide that took us on the tour was very professional and knowledgeable even though he is only a volunteer.

It's also great that the museum features art pieces from around the South East Asian region which differentiates it from other museums around the world - I like the batik pieces and the political paintings gave me a good insight into the political scene in Singapore during her early days ! Again there are guided tours for the art pieces, given by very professional volunteers in English and in Mandarin! As the guides focus on different art pieces each time, you can go for the same tour on different days and there is no fear of hearing the same thing twice !

I went each time with new knowledge - a great way to spend the day ! I highly recommend this place to anyone - even hose with young children - they have activities for the young ones !"
,,Singapore Art Museum: SAM of All our Feelings,5.0,,"Singapore Art Museum: SAM of All our Feelings

We got lost looking for it using a map, tracking the landmarks so we arrive by its doorstep. Big mistake. And the locals we asked help from were not too clear themselves. So first afternoon of my wife and I during our recently Singapore vacation, we were dog tired and darn lost.

But she insisted we go. So day 2, and learning from our mistake the day before, we went for the kill. We hailed a cab that drove us in 5 minutes delivering us by the door steps of the Singapore Art Museum (SAM), a contemporary art museum focusing on art practices in Singapore, Southeast Asia and Asia. It is a restored 19th century mission school, with white walls, arches and now converted to house modern art showing commissioned artworks, artist loans and works from the Singapore Art Museum collection.

Titled ""Odyssey: Navigating Nameless Seas"", visitors like us were drawn into Earth’s watery realms, as seen through the eyes of contemporary artists. The installations are at once insightful and jolting, for their expanse and simplicity but overall, for their impact on viewers like ourselves for serenity and movement and the demand to change our abusive ways with the earth's oceans.

The museum is well provided for in terms of layout and lighting that transforms the rendered works larger than life, coveted by many as the richness of the ocean abounds, and so are its threats. The notes of each installation illuminated by soft light have texts that educate and also challenge the visitor to learn from mistakes and change in acts and thinking that the oceans of the earth has no replacement.

When we entered the museum, while we were initially assessed Singapore entrance fee of $10 for my wife and I, we were pleasantly subsequently told we can enter with no charge. This must be because my wife uses a walker. It's the museum's way of giving a handicap the benefit to see the exhibits. We were given the blue tag each. Then we explored

The installations are riveting. They disturb as much as they evoke peace and serenity; in a way, they calm. They are each sensually arresting but richly diverse as each artist harnessed their creativity. If the thick walls of the museum, once a school, could speak, it will talk to visitors with secrets that the ocean also hold dear and sacred.

Yes, our mornings spent in SAM was memorable and we left in deep thought about how we can help save our oceans."
,,Oceans....,4.0,,"Went to see Odyssey. Really great mixed show based around sea and navigation themes. Some brilliant work, with standout pieces from Rasid Rana, Alfredo & Isabel Aquilizan, and Choe U-Ram. Guards were really well informed and helpful, they really know their stuff. Nipped into the education space, not thinking it would have much we would be interested in (as child focus see) but again, superb work. All really well presented, and with a rather good shop thrown in."
,,A must,4.0,,"Not all of the galleries were open when I went there in May 2016. If you have time to spare in Singapore, visit this Museum and enjoy what it has to offer. Afterwards, head to Imaginarium where the art installations and exhibit are interactive and fun."
,,I love SAM,5.0,,"SAM (Singapore Art Museum) always change its theme every year. So it always show you something new, and give you new knowledge related to arts. I love this museum so much. Its good for kids also for adults. It has so many rooms connected with another rooms which let you suprised by the artistic things that the artists made. Perfect!"
,,Very educational,5.0,,Nice place to visit . Very educational. Covered good range of artists work. Bustling with different events and activities aplenty to engage the visitors. Brought my physically compromised dad along and moving around was not a problem at all. Met a wonderful staff who took initiative to give us a walk around your in the one of the art gallery. I thought that was wonderful we learnt a lot after his explanation. Thank you.
,,Enjoyed it,4.0,,"This is not one of largest museums in Singapore. But, it gives me big impact by the unique art objects. I like that. I can enjoy this place multiple times repeatedly. Also, a nice place to escape from the heated Singapore."
,,Contemporary Art at its best!,4.0,,"For tourists, you would need to pay a certain amount to enter because it is only free for permanent residents in Singapore. You can check their website to check the rates. I am not so sure about price because when I went here, it was during the art week and we were allowed in for free."
,,Upgraded at last,4.0,,"Haven't been here in years and the transformation is amazing. No longer a boring stark museum but this is upgraded to one with gallery of different themes. I like the one with images of my childhood places and things. The gallery with the Japanese occupation days is great too, reminds us the importance of national defense.

Great trip. Well done with the upgrading."
,,Free entry on National Holiday and Friday evening,3.0,,Free entry on National Holiday and Friday evening. Small but very nice and creative art collection .
,,For contemporary art lovers,4.0,,We visited the place on a Friday since it is free from 6-9pm. Too bad the main section was closed for an event so we were only able to visit a part of the museum. My children enjoyed the place and wanted to see more but we did not have time to go back. I suggest you call if you plan to visit on a Friday or just pay to be sure. I think it will be worth it anyway.
,,Free Sunday admission and great experience = recommended,4.0,,"Lots of fun, Creative, child friendly and interesting exhibitions. Not the biggest art museum I've been too, but a good experience ."
,,Imaginarium visit,3.0,,"Came here today with the kids to check out the Imaginarium exhibition at 8Q. Fortunately we arrived shortly after 10am and so it wasn't very busy, but that changed pretty quickly as it approached 11am. A few interesting exhibits for the kids to enjoy, and some interactive activities. There was some pretty weird stuff at the main building. Worth a visit."
,,The place to look for emerging regional artists,4.0,,"Nice of Singapore to have such a venue for exhibitions of contemporary art from local artists or artists from South East Asia. The quality of the experience varies obviously with one’s personal tastes and the specific exhibition. A number of large-scale pieces (sound-generating copper piping network, floating canopy of small luminous portraits, forest of white pipes revealing texts from various angles, etc.) were stimulating when I visited (end-January). The annex, SAM at 8Q about 200m away, seemed more experimental and did not attract many visitors, but again the building offers plenty of opportunities to showcase works by emerging artists. SAM is obviously playing its part giving a boost to emerging art in the region."
,,Nice to do but not a need to do,4.0,,Still not sure how I felt about this one - there were three exhibitions on at the time of going. Definitely makes you rethink art. Some of it was incredible and different. Some rooms were a little less then desirable. Can easily waste an hour or two here so for the $10 entry I say go check it out yourself.
,,Depends on the exhibition going on,3.0,,"Unfortunately when I was here, there weren't any interesting exhibition going on. The uncle's work here was really honest and say that there's nothing he would recommend me to see at that time. Eventually there's was free entry that Friday afternoon when I visited here, so I think I have nothing to lose. Since I'm already there, I might as well just looking around.

The main building itself was quite interesting architecture, since it used to be an old church, but really the exhibition wasn't there at all. At the extension building, which is 8Q there was a quiet interesting exhibition going on, about ocean, and how young generation should preserve our ocean habitat.

I spent only 45 minutes wondering around 3 levels at the main building, 3 levels at the 8Q, so there's really not much going on. Maybe you can also visit another museums around if you have a lot of time.."
,,Great place to spend a couple of hours,4.0,,"SAM is well worth a visit, I think the Curators were in the midst of changing around a lot of the exhibitions when I visited so definitely want to go back when all the exhibits are open

Some exhibits were of more interest than others, as I always find in most modern art gallery's, but one to particularly note was a beautiful cascade of slides filled with blood samples of all different people in Singapore, sounds gory but was beautifully done and really quite poignant, defo one to visit a few times as and when exhibits change"
,,A lovely way to spend the afternoon,5.0,,If you love art and architecture....this is the place for you and your family and/or friends. It's a delightful way to spend a morning or evening moving in and out of rooms with amazing pieces of art from the region...including some art installations and sculptures. Some would be make interesting topics of conversation.
,,Interesting exhibitions,4.0,,Interesting copper pipe exhibition that played music. Definitely woke up the senses. Several other interesting exhibitions giving a view into life in Singapore. Building itself was beautiful & colonial. Friendly staff. Cafe and shop on the grounds.
,,"""Old and historical building""",1.0,,There was no exhibits going on as they was waiting for exhibits to come. Former catholic school turned into museum. Better call and find out what exhibits there are before coming.
,,Hermès for Free,5.0,,"Leather Forever celebrates Hermès’ relationship with leather, the first material tamed by the house. The exhibition takes visitors on a poetic journey exploring Hermès’ love of this fine material, presenting items from Hermès’ past as well as some of its latest creations.Free Admission"
,,Free entrance during renovation,5.0,,"They offer very interesting of Singaporean artists works in some of the rooms, as some areas aure under working progress. Worth to see the works. They offer little class activities, which is pretty fun too."
,,Great small museum,5.0,,"I really enjoyed my visit here, the staff went out of their way to explain the pieces and it was located close to Clarke Quay - only a 10 Singaporean dollar taxi ride."
,,A Must For Art Lovers,5.0,,"The museum typically hosts a number of exhibitions in a year, usually featuring artists from Asia and beyond. The highlight of the exhibition would the Singapore Biennale. The museums is housed in two main buildings, bothe former colonial schools. The main building is the former St. Joseph Institution. The other building on Queen Street is a short walk away."
,,Inspiring stuff,5.0,,Great variety of pieces and within a fairly quiet context...super! $10 each for adults. Beautiful building to showcase the artworks. Serious contemporary art lovers will enjoy this immensely.
,,Change of museum name required,3.0,,"I've been here before and enjoyed a range of art. However, I was disappointed this time to discover not a single painting! No oil, no watercolour, no mixed media...

On enquiry, I was told that the paintings had been moved to another gallery.

I must admit that the modern stuff was quite interesting but the name 'Singapore Art Museum' is misleading.

Frankly, if I'd known that there were no paintings or sculptures (except outside), I'd have gone to the new place instead!"
,,Not World Class!,3.0,,"Special exhibits promoting local contemporary artists, and Singapore culture and history; and no permanent collection. Tried to make a good use of the landmark, but it does not work for art exhibitions. One would go through the 2 buildings in an hour. Worth stopping by if happen to be in the neighborhood, but not special art destination."
,,A very interesting place!,4.0,,"I joined the tour with Maureen and loved how she explained things about some of pieces in the museum, their meaning.An absolute highlight of my visit was the portrait of shampoo bottle caps of the most important man of Singapore. Very impressive!"
,,Have a look if you're into modern art,4.0,,"Thought provoking pieces of modern art. Wasn't expansive, but made up for it in quality. Take an hour or two to check this place out if modern art is your bag. Recommend the little cafe within the building for its cold brew coffee cocktails. Delish!"
,,Free Entry on Every Friday 6PM to 9PM,5.0,,"Otherwise need to pay SGD 10 per adult and SGD 5 per child Child under six free. Dome Café & 7 KICKstart, Museum Café cum shopping also possible inside Art Museum."
,,5 Stars Exhibition - Well worth a visit,4.0,,"Entry Fee: $10:00

Modern works in the main - photography and video.

Some of the exhibits in the 5 Stars exhibition were very intelligent and creative reflections on Singapore's recent history as a democracy.

There were some other exhibitions, small, which seemed to draw on modern medium rather than more traditional modes.

All up it is small but one could easily spend 11/2 hours viewing the exhibits. A stand out was a collage made from shampoo tops portraying the artist's face - very clever!"
,,Thought it was more,3.0,,Despite a wonderful building and overall organization I was a bit disappointed - I expected more from the exposition.
,,contemporary art????,2.0,,thank goodness joined a guided tour. that helped explain what we saw. still don' undertand it. a waste of money
,,Overall is fine,4.0,,"If you are around downtown and interested in contemporary art work, you may consider SAM. The installation at the third floor is pretty cool, but it is not reachable with elevator, find the stairs to go up."
,,Lovely architecture!,4.0,,"Kinda in between Dhoby Ghaut and City Hall MRT stations
Free entry for Singaporeans

Beautiful historical building (used to be the old St. Joseph's Institution / Catholic boys' school) that's been restored. I think some areas are still in the process of being renovated/restored.

Exhibitions change regularly, more of the contemporary arts, so very much adult themed. Probably would not recommend it to young kids.

The compound and architecture; simply gorgeous - tiles looked original to me, wooden spiral staircase, corridors, aged marble plaques with names of donors and the statue facing the entrance have been preserved. Mesmerising to the point you can imagine what the place was like when it was still a school and the history behind it.

The quality of the exhibits were good, well curated with enough space that it does not feel cramped even when there are 4 or 5 people in the same room.

Bring along your camera and wander along the corridors, lots of photo opps!

I used this as an opportunity to visit the nearby National Museum of Singapore and surrounding Stamford Road, Bras Basah areas - really quite a treat.

Depending on the exhibits on display, and your purpose of the visit (mine was more to admire the architecture), you can spend an hour or 2 walking around. Wasn't very crowded when I visited the place in the afternoon at 3pm.

I'll be back again and will be sure to do some research first so that I can better appreciate its rich history, and the role it played in shaping Singapore's education landscape.

,,Enjoyed a leisurely morning exploring this contemporary Museum,4.0,,"Lovely cool building with large white gallery areas. Current contemporary exhibition very interesting and a change from the norm, Not impressed with Museum shop - slightly understocked. I did not try the attached cafe."
,,Very Interesting,5.0,,"Having studied in this institution (it was a secondary school) it was nostalgic to experience walking though the corridors and rooms that were study places in its history .. and now put to good use as an Art Museum, especially befitting the architecture of the building that looks great in the daytime but especially so at night time. Must visit again!"
,,the collection is too small,3.0,,It was an interesting experience. The museum building is full of characters. There was a nice example of contemporary art from local artists but the collection was too small. A little disappointing at the visit.
,,Nothing special but it's early days,3.0,,What a wonderful building to preserve. Friendly ticket counter. I found signage confusing to navigate the collections and the art not that fabulous to my taste. Cafe at the back very hip & not really welcoming. Art shop ok. staff helpful upstairs.
,,Intriguing,5.0,,"Singapore is not so much a cultural desert as people tend to view it.

Singapore Art Museum (SAM) displays some of the best works in the region. That's not all - it takes a very active stance in getting visitors to think about and engage with the art even without directly touching it.

I also love how they bring in new exhibitions every now and then - keeps me coming back all the time!"
,,Good for the art lover and budget traveller!,4.0,,"We visited on Friday nights, free entry for foreigners and were entertained for about an hour with the well curated exhibits! A lovely art museum."
,,Contemporary art museum.,4.0,,"- The larger of two contemporary art museums, the other being 8Q SAM nearby.
- Right next to Bras Basah MRT station and bus stops.
- Excellent place to spend an edifying lunch hour.
- Constantly updating its exhibits, expect some galleries to be closed from time to time.
- Ubiquitous presence of staff sitting outside / milling around the galleries may put some visitors off.
- Extended opening hours on Friday evenings.
- Visit during the Night Festival (usually August), where there will be light shows on the facade, and live performances nearby."
,,A must see attraction of singapore,5.0,,"Singapore has traditionally Ben known as a hub of commerce.

It is steadily establishing itself as a curator of the arts and SAM is part of that transformation.

A number of galleries within the museum showcased some exceptional modern art from Singaporean artists. It is we'll worth the $10 entry fee. I highly recommend visiting SAM to anyone stoping by Singapore for more than a day."
,,Nice change.,3.0,,"Stopped by at this gallery on a rainy day. The works on exhibition were mostly contemporary sculptures and art forms. It was nice and different. It had 5 realistic life size images of world leaders (four dead, one life)."
,,Contemporary art in Singapore,5.0,,Who knew there be such neat art in Singapore? Good variety and a lot of freedom of expression. 'Time of Others' bringing together art from several Asian museums is a very interesting show. Great reuse of an old school.
,,Not my cup of tea,1.0,,"If you are art lover, you may like it. But if you cannot figure out head and tail of Art like me, do not even dare to enter this. I wasted 20 SGD for 2 persons. Coincidentally there was a free walk guide in English, but my bad luck that I did not like it. Came out in middle of the tour."
,,Contemporary art Museum,4.0,,The Singapore Art Museum (SAM) showcases contemporary work in the lovely old building. We were fortunate to see 5 Stars which salutes Singapore's Golden Jubilee.
,,Friendly staff,3.0,,"The staff are friendly. They offered directions and their recommended route. However, the art is too abstract for me."
,,Well Organized Contemporary Art Museum,4.0,,"Great museum. Well organized exhibition. Today this museum change its name to be Contemporary Art In Southeast Asia, hence we cant see its old paintings collections. The collections have been relocated to National Gallery of Singapore which will be open shortly. However, if you are fancy of contemporary art, this is the place to visit."
,,"Beautiful building, unique artworks.",4.0,,"We found this place quite by accident and you wouldn't think it was an Art Museum by just looking at the building. While the art exhibitions at the time were not to our tastes (too abstract and contemporary), it was nice to just explore the building, which had different wings and sections leading off everywhere, so there was heaps to explore and look at."
,,Good Regional displays from SE Asia,5.0,,Some very interesting permanent exhibitions and some even more evocative temporary exhibitions from artists using multi media from the SE Asian region. Well worth the 2 -3 hours required to explore the main museum - if time permits you can go the annex across the side road. Cafe located at the main site offers a variety of good which is well cooked and presented as is virtually always the case in Singapore.
,,Formerly a Great School in Singapore,5.0,,"This was formerly St Joseph's Institution in Singapore, run by the De La Salle Brothers. It has now been converted into a museam."
,,Take the Docent Tour,3.0,,"This is a very small museum which probably wouldn't have been worth the entry fee if it hadn't been for the docent tour. She did an excellent job in providing history and depth to the various pieces. Never fear, a new national art museum is opening in November!"
,,Cool art,4.0,,"Very well located, its cool art. All the exhibits rooms are well planned and the lighting effect is marvellous. Care is taken to explain in the language desired. There is more for children too in the adjacent building. Special fun was the UV ray exhibits and the cycling ones."
,,brilliant,5.0,,"we had a great trip, which on the day we visited turned out to be one of the free days and there was a guided walk through the exhibits in English just starting after we arrived. It turned out we were the only people on the guide so was great to ask questions"
,,What a gem,5.0,,I read a review about this in a local newspaper and decided to check it out -it was terrific -a highly eclectic range of exhibits in an older style building that twists and turns but is all part of the charm. Definitely worth seeing. Recommended!
,,Good contemporary art museum,5.0,,"Going beyond the nice building and the other facilities of the museum, of course your experience will depend upon what is on display when you visit it, so check in advance; we were quite lucky to have four choices, so we went for one show in a nearby building with ""President awards"", and another one ""Utopia"" in the main; both revealed several great works and some not too much on our taste, as it is normal for path seeking that contemporary art is; for an European the local art can look ""too engaged"", politically and historically speaking, with resentments against the colonial past of the region, a little bit odd today in the wealthy place that Singapore has become :)"
,,Worth the Visit Even if Just for Architecture-Art is a Bonus,4.0,,"What a beautiful colonial building has been chosen to house the contemporary art of this museum! Entrance is S$10, which I thought was ok. I like to start at the top and work down. As usual the art and installations are challenging. Especially one set up in the old chapel (the building used to be a catholic school in another life). I enjoyed the local school children's efforts and thought their teachers did a great job with them. Depending when you choose to go, what is available will change, but you can't but not be captivated by the beautiful architecture of the building. If only it could talk!"
,,Singapore Art Museum,2.0,,"We visited this art museum on a Friday Evening when entry is free. We are glad we did not pay to go in.
We try to visit art galleries wherever we stay and have an interest in a wide variety of art. There is very little to commend this gallery. There are just 2 floors with small galleries on either side of a central staircase. The content was contemporary and local and verged on the peculiar - one room was devoted to video art with one wall having multiple scenes depicting the façade of local social housing blocks, where just three sections had any movement, consisting of two neighbours hanging laundry? over their respective balconies. I watched for 2 - 3 minutes but nothing else transpired.
Unfortunately, much of the rest held little interest for me and I can barely recall anything more!
Perhaps we were unlucky to visit when this particular set of works was being exhibited. The building itself is interesting and very easy to get to, just beyond the southern end of Orchard Road in the Colonial District and close to other museums. A visit will take well under an hour."
,,Great Art Museum,4.0,,"Wow, we were very impressed by this art museum. It has reached international standard. We like the explanatory notes that accompany the art exhibits - helped us to appreciate the artwork. Well done."
,,Modern art museum in Singapore,3.0,,"The current exhibitions of modern art are thought-provoking so I recommend the guided tours (11am and 2pm weekdays) in order to appreciate the installations more deeply. The art spaces are cold so a shawl comes in handy. There is an Italian restaurant and a cafe within the museum building for those who would like to break their trip with a meal (as several exhibitions are on-going). As it is right outside the Bras Basah MRT station, the SAM is very accessible. Free entrance to Singaporean citizens and Permanent Residents; free to all visitors during public holidays."
,,Not much to see.,2.0,,"A bit of a disappointment. Not much quality. $10 can be better spent. There is a time where it is free for about 3 hours on Fridays I believe. If you must go, go then."
,,What a wonderful surprise,5.0,,"This is a terrific gallery, well worth the S$10 ticket price. Mths exhibitions were really interesting, fun and different. Best of all, the art gallery attendants gave helpful explanations about each of the works of art. If you like art, add this to your list of things to see in Singapore."
,,The strength of Singapore,5.0,,"On three levels five exhibitions (Peace, Justice, Equality, Democracy and Progress) capture the strength of Singapore from creating awareness on how intertwined we are too what I found to be the most awakening; every point of view."
,,I feel ripped off...,1.0,,We came on a day that exhibitions were being installed so most galleries were closed. I wish they told us that when we bought the ticket. Waste of time and money. Make sure you ask what exhibitions are open before buying a ticket.
,,Museum Tour,4.0,,"It's definitely worth to join the museum tour. They gave very detailed introduction of the art collection and the exhibition. They provide both English and Chinese version.

It's a pity that not so many people attend the tour. It's really a good place!

BTW, you can buy cute magnets with SG features here."
,,Good place to go for art-lover,5.0,,"It is one of most beautiful museum i used to visit. Luckily, my singaporean friend took me there during the 50th birthday of Singapore, i had good expericened because they exhibited special display about stories of Singapore. The museum used to be a big church . there is also good reason to visit because of its beautiful architecture. I was so in love with it. If you check on website, they displayed some lightings for special occasion too."
,,Beautiful Building,4.0,,"The building of the museum is very nice. Currently, the major is morden art. We saw the name of Wu Guan Zhong at the museum menu but it has been closed. Too bad."
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,"This is the best art museum I have ever visited! The ambience was superb, calm, peaceful and so soothing to the spirit. The staff were discreetly and quietly helpful and so well informed when asked questions. There are permanent exhibitions and temporary ones. A current temporary one is 'After Utopia'. This exhibition is amazing - it takes you through the evolution of utopia and how it is something we continue to strive for yest, it suggests, will never be achieved. I, personally, found this exhibition informative, intellectually challenging and it generated a sense of sadness about how we are today - we seem to have retained the self-orientation needed when human kind first walked the earth. It really touched me deeply about how we are behaving towards the refugee situation. The exhibition is on until 18 October 2015. If you care about the greater good, or maybe more so if not, this exhibition is a must. We took about 3 hours to view the exhibition, the time just flew by. Just writing about it now has been an emotional experience, it really did touch my spirit.

The museum is open 1000 - 1800 Monday to Thursday, 1000 - 1900 and free admission operates on a Friday 1000 - 2100.

We went as a family with our adult son and his partner so opted for category 'couples', however it is suitable for all and on its website you can access question sheets and helpfully the site also gives access to 'suggested answers' , so really helpful if you want to optimise the educational aspect of a visit."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Interesting art collection of asian artists including a huge ball pulled tirshaw-like by a cambodian artist, discoish bombs hanging from the ceillung, 366 wooden scultures, scenes of singapore hdb blocks. Free for singaporeans and permanent residents.
For meals, can walk to food republic which is a food court, slightly further from starbucks."
,,Loved it,5.0,,I loved this and it's neighbour art museum. It had so many cool art installations that everyone will find something they enjoyed. The Chapel was very moving and emotive. Throughly recommend.
,,Good one,3.0,,"If you try something different you can check this one.. Theres many art work in there, if you travel singapore and bring children its so many things that child can doing for art."
,,Beautiful Building,3.0,,"Well worth having a look at the restored building & a coffee & a loo at the shop.
Inside, it was the usual freezing cold ambiance & that was not just the temperature- nothing to see!
When a people has spent most of one generation trying to wipe out the old for new, of course there is nothing to see.
Same happens in most developing nations. Shame."
,,A little bizarre !,4.0,,Well laid out loved the chapel very effective .the museum seems well set out with clear sgins. My daughter who is more arty than me enjoyed photographing everything . The museum was buzzing with sweet nursery children who were loving it
,,A contemporary art museum,4.0,,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I stepped in here (not so much to shelter from the rain, even though it was raining, because I had every intention of coming here) but it turned out to be an exhibition of modern Asian art. Actually, when I was here they had a single exhibition called 'After Utopia' that took up four galleries, and I must admit that it was pretty cool (and there were some awesome art works to go with it). One really cool thing that I saw was this jet plane that looked like it came straight out of some science-fiction movie, which meant I spent about five minutes admiring it (and taking photos of it as well). The other thing I loved was this security guard – he was an absolute hoot. Mind you, their lockers don't take the new $1.00 coins, but fortunately you can get change at the front desk."
,,"Good art, just not very much of it",2.0,,"A French friend of mine long resident in Singapore bemoaned the lack of quality Western art here. It's true, there are only a small number of pieces, and Singapore is a bit off the beaten track travelled by most visiting high-end exhibitions. It's just an uncomfortable truth that while western colonialists plundered huge quantities of Asian and African art to display at in great galleries at home, for historic reasons, public collections of western art in Asia are small and unremarkable. And this one is no different."
,,Historic building worth a visit.....,3.0,,"As the name implies, this is a museum related to arts. For someone who has interests in art, this would be an interesting place to visit, with regular international Events & Exhibitions. But you would probably not come here if arts is not your cup of tea.

One very interesting fact but probably unknown to most is the history of this building where SAM now sits.

It was actually an old Catholic school called St Joseph's Instituition(SJI). I think this building was built in the late 1800s. SJI has since moved elsewhere years ago to make way for SAM.

You can see the original external beautiful historic structure of this building, & the internal structural design are not of this modern age( although modernly renovated).

Entrance fee is low. Certainly a small price to pay just to experience this place even if arts is not your priority."
,,A cool oasis of modern art,4.0,,"The SAM is in an old church building that has been extensively (but carefully) renovated to support modern art. Access is free to Singaporeans and there are discounts for some (older persons, young children etc) although at the time I was there it was the start of the Singapore 50 year celebration so it was free to all.

There is a minibus that runs at set points between the SAM and other museums.

The museum has a changing selection of artwork; including (at the time) contributions from local students.

This makes for a vibrant pleasant 2-3 hour visit.

Try the DOME coffee shop (just outside on the right hand end of the building) ."
,,Ticket Doesn't value for money,1.0,,Attracted by the banner and expecting creativity of many art piece. Ticket is expensive and nothing to impress and kind of confusing. It's a art centre rather than a museum. Maybe a good spot for family with kids.
,,Back for more,3.0,,"Came here today for another visit. All new exhibits since we last visited so that was good, but still some fairly unusual stuff. Very crowded as it was free for everyone (not just citizens and PRs) due to SG50 celebrations."
,,Limited but quality contemporary art exhibits,3.0,,"Contemporary art exhibits in a beautiful colonial building.When we visited in early August many rooms were closed, but the exhibits were interesting and a couple were interactive eg Dreamcatchers (by children living with chronic illness) which was inspiring, and another reflecting on home life in Singapore. When I visited the gallery in the past there was a lot more to see, hopefully there will be more in the future, if not here then in the Singapore National Gallery, opening in Nov 2015."
,,PAY A VISIT,4.0,,"Not educated in art at all but this captivated me! Definitely a must visit if you're in Singapore.

They also have an interactive exhibit, where you could play with huggable things or enjoy yourself on the doodle area! You just find your way there.

Also, there's a photobooth in the area so that's also recommendable."
,,Don't miss this place.,5.0,,We always visit here when in Singapore and we are never disappointed. Free admission right now too. Exhibits always give me plenty to think about. Love this place.
,,excellent exhibition,4.0,,"At the time of our visit, there was an excellent exhibition on called 'After Utopia' featuring contemporary Asian artists. The work was really exciting and we particularly liked a huge sculpture made out of motorcycle exhaust pipes. The Learning Gallery also contained some fascinating work - in particular, a compelling video instillation by Sarah Choo Jing.

Also, the cafe was very pleasant."
,,nice exhibition. Tip: at the moment it is free entrance,4.0,,"If you are into modern art pay this museum a visit. At the moment there is a very nice exhibition about: communism, paradise, peace, ideals, war. Because they are working at a new exhibtion only part of the museum is open. That is why you don't pay entrance at the moment. Otherwise you can also get inside for free on Fridays."
,,A must visit on any Singapore stop over,5.0,,"I have been going to the museum for nearly 20 years on stop overs to and from NZ and have always found items in the exhibits that are visually pleasing, challenging, thought provoking or just plain amazing.

Art can be pleasing sometimes awful or even revolting but that is what art does and should do.

The building is architecturally pleasing, fully air conditioned, entrance is free and the Cafe is OK - I struggle to understand why it is not rated higher on this web site."
,,Just ok,2.0,,"I accidentally bought a ticket for this because I thought it was the national museum. Call me uncultured but I didn't get the point of anything in here, but there was a cool spaceship type thing. I guess if you like art this would be ok. They also have another building across the road you can go to with the same ticket."
,,Interesting building,3.0,,"Saw Utopia here and despite there being a few pieces of interest, I was not particularly enamoured by the exhibition. Pleased to have seen the building and been there though."
,,Go for a look at beautiful building!,5.0,,"Wow what a lovely surprise this building was.
Obviously an old convent,so beautifully preserved.
The exhibitions vary all the time.Most are very interesting.
They also have an in resident artist shop,which has some lovely gifts.
Unfortunately they were low on stock for many items,so it saved my budget."
,,Interesting installations,4.0,,The museum is in an sprawling old colonial building. The layout is a bit confusing inside. All the exhibits I saw were contemporary and from SE Asia. The Beyond Utopia exhibition is thought provoking including the installation in the chapel.
,,Nice experience!,4.0,,"It's a pleasant experience and would definitely recommend to both tourists and locals. The building itself is historic and there is a good range of media available. For S$10, you can spend at least half a day in that museum and it's worth it. Try visiting SAM @ Q8 and try the old school photo booth which at S$2 gives you a B&W and Colored photos of your four shots."
,,Visit only if you have already seen all other museums,3.0,,"Our recent visit to SAM was a little disappointing in comparison to our experience in Singapore's other major museums. While the building itself is nice, the content of the museum is quite meager. There was no permanent collection while we visited- so don't expect anything like a modern art museum.We took a free tour of the current exhibition and it was (only) the tour guide made our visit worthwhile really. Without guide, it would have been much less interesting."
,,Stupendous Singapore,4.0,,A great find. Wasn't intending to do much on this brief visit to Singapore but glad we did. Some terrific art and good exhibitions. Worth a look.
,,Fantastic escape from the commercialism of Singapore,4.0,,This is a great little museum and a welcome escape from the commercialism and heat of Singapore. The After Utopia special exhibition had some wicked modern pieces from across Asia. End the trip with a delicious coffee from 7 Kick Start Coffee next door.
,,Amazing Tour Guide,5.0,,"I don't know anything about Art but thought I would try something new and I'm so glad I did.
The entrance fee $10.

I arrived at 2pm and the helpful staff explained that a free English tour was away to straight.

I'm so glad I took part in the tour. The American tour guide was helpful, friendly and explained everything clearly and it wasn't boring at all.

I certainly recommend it."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"I have never like art since i find it complicated but ever since my friends brought me here, it just opens up my eyes that art was something someone can express themselves. Their feelings or emotions. Singapore Art Museum has many interesting display that some i find it weird,scary,cool or unexplainable. This is a great place to go if someone has passion in art or non-passionate like me."
,,Singapore Art Museum Worth A Visit,4.0,,"The Singapore Art Museum, very close to a Metro exit, features a number of interesting ""modern art"" type exhibitions by local artists. The colonial style building is interesting by itself. We had lunch at one of the Museum's two restaurants - very nice menu, prompt service, and reasonable prices. The National Museum Of Singapore is about two blocks away"
,,Excellent outing with grandkids,5.0,,Very interesting program organised for children covering a variety of entertaining and educational topics. Well presented with helpful staff. Reasonably priced as well. A good couple of hours and time well spent.
,,Nice museum to visit,4.0,,"This museum is located between Dhoby Ghaut and City Hall MRT Station. It's also near CHIJMES.

Formerly a school building, it is now restored to its former glory and now houses a museum.

The museum changes their exhibits regularly with several exhibitions going on at a time.

There are also a cafe and restaurant he where you can have a coffee it sit down meal."
,,Some interesting and unusual modern art exhibits,3.0,,A wide variety of modern art on display in this large and slightly confusing building. Plenty of installations showing off interesting thinking and concepts.
,,Study visual art,4.0,,"I would always visit SAM when they change their exhibitions since it's free for Singaporean citizens and PRs. However, tourists have to pay $10 for adult and $5 for children. Sometimes it wouldn't be worth the trip as most areas are closed so do try to find out what exhibitions are on and if it's worth your trip."
,,Visiting Singapore Art Museum,4.0,,"The building is wonderful, however if you went inside the museum, the impression is different. The interesting part of the inside is only the temporary exhibition."
,,Thought provoking temporary exhibition,4.0,,"I had the fortune to come here as the exhibit on utopias was running. A fascinating collection and well curated. Cannot testify such praise for the permanent collection, which seemed very threadbare."
,,Nice building from outside; small and little to see inside,2.0,,"This was a disappointment. I like the building from outside, especially with its lights at night. But I was disappointed in what I saw inside. I was expecting much better."
,,Only Visit SAM If You want To Learn About The History Of Singapore,5.0,,This museum offers a great introduction into the history of Singapore through artwork.If you are interested in the history of Singapore you will enjoy this attraction. The museum has few examples of Western art.
,,Too many work in progress,1.0,,"It has been 10 years since my first visit to Singapore art museum. And I decided to visit singapore art museum again with my family in this particular day. 

Singapore art museum charges entrance for non singapore citizen and non permanent resident. Entrance fee is $10 sing dollars for adults and $5 for students.

It's a disappointment that most of the section is closed due to installation. Level 3 is completely closed, level 2 is mostly closed. Level 1 is 50% closed. I wonder whether they have ever thought of a Visit who paid for the entrance? It's about 40 minutes visit time with pretty slow walking for the main building. 

The only relief is there is a new wing called 8Q, which is specify for children. There are 4 level in the new wing and 2 exhibition each level.  It's more joyful for the kids to enjoy origami, playground, kids movie and some puzzle.

It took about 2 hours to complete the entire tour.  If I ain't with family and kids were enjoying the new wing,  I think it's a total rip off of money as most exhibition are closed. Sorry I think I'll never visit again."
,,Use your imagination,4.0,,"T
his is located a short walk from Raffles hotel or a couple of minutes walk from Bras Basah MRT station. Unfortunately when we visited in April they were preparing for a new exhibition (After Utopia) so there was not a great deal for us to see. It mainly concentrates on Asia artists so very new for us Westerners which is interesting. Friday evenings it's free, the usual adult fee being $10, half price for seniors and students.
However, the star for us was the visit around the corner to the Imaginarium. Put aside your inhibitions as an adult and immerse yourself in the interactive displays and experience them as a child does, with interest and excitement. We wrote on the walls, tried to make an origami rocket ( would have reached the floor). Sat on various bikes to illuminate exhibits and then tried fitting puzzle pieces after having decorated trees with model sweets in Candy Land. Enjoy being a big kid and pass that joy to your children and grandchildren."
,,So impressed!,4.0,,"I took my kids to see this Art Museum. It was so interesting and informative. The staff in each hall was really friendly and helpful and very knowledgeable on the exhibition. It was completely different to any other art museum I have ever visited, in the sense that it didn't have halls of paintings, but consisted of current and really relevant installation art. I loved it and so did the children. Comes highly recommended!"
,,Disappointed Art Lover,1.0,,"I really love art. Whenever I travel to a new city, I will make it a point to visit at least one of their main art galleries.

However, I was incredibly disappointed at SAM and it is totally not worth the money that you pay. I wouldn't even go there if it was free and I was bored - even if the price does include entry to Sam @SQ8 or whatever the 'interactive' art gallery for children is which frankly is also mostly a waste of time.

The only plus is that the workers there are mostly friendly to talk to..."
,,Understated quality,4.0,,"The Singapore Art Museum (SAM) is in a former institution and the buildings seem to hang on to their past only stubbornly giving a little to their current function as an art museum of quality and depth. But there are moments here that make a visit very special and certainly worthwhile.

'After Utopia' the current exhibition explores four themes through contemporary Asian art largely drawn from SAM's own collection. I am from a western background so was fortunate to be with a local friend who could provide me with some insight into certain cultural, historical and societal features of the various works that I would otherwise have missed. Having said that, the staff here are very friendly and knowledgable so do not hesitate to ask them any questions you might have. I did several times and was always provided with very good information.

However, there is a highlight in the current exhibition at SAM that you must not miss. It is in the old chapel and is a powerful yet curiously playful piece that delivers its message not only through its own strength but also through the power of its particular location. Search it out and do not be afraid to open the door and go inside."
,,The imaginarium is the place to go,4.0,,Went to the main building which was largely closed as they were preparing for a new exhibition due to open in early May. However went round but little to see. Then went across to the annex in Queen Street over the road. This is designed as an interactive playground for children so you just need to chill out and go with the flow. We probably spent an hour over there taking part in the various activities and found it far more interesting than the main museum site.
,,Very modern art by artists from Asia,3.0,,"SAM is an unique museum with very modern art created by artists from different Asian countries. The buildings are a former old Victorian upper crust Boys School and is in itself very interesting. I honestly have to say that this type of modern art is not my favorite. However I did enjoy the couple of hours we spend here. The art had subliminal political and/or life messages. We paid admission. (about $10 per person for nonSinaporeans) and took a free tour in English with a docent who turned out to be a French expat.) The docent made the art interesting. She explained what the artist was trying to convey and pointed out things we would of missed. I think if we wandered around by ourselves, I would of looked at some of the art and just not understood it. It did get us out of the heat and humidity in the middle of the day. And overall it was an interesting couple of hours."
,,I just don't get it,1.0,,"So called ""modern art"" is not really my thing, but this was on a whole new level. A video of a woman dancing on butter representing her struggle with weight and body image. All I saw was a woman repeatedly falling down in her heels. I worried about how many bruises or broken bones she might receive. Not sure why this is art. If you are a deep, modern-art-loving person this may be for you. I just don't get it."
,,This museum with its ever changing exhibitions is always worth a visit,5.0,,"This interesting museum on Marina Bay is always an inspirational place to visit. On this occasion the main attraction was "" Da Vinci - Shaping the Future "" and was well worth the visit. While a museum of this size cannot hope to display the fullness of all of Da Vinci's work, what was on display gave me great insight into what a remarkable man he was. I had no idea of the width and breadth off his research, knowledge and inventions.
Also featured was Prudential, an exhibition of modern art which was thought provoking."
,,Great,5.0,,"The museum had some fascinating exhibits, including while we were there the winners of the APB Foundation Signature Art Prize 2014 Finalists Exhibition. My favorite was by Pakistan artist Farida Batool called Kahani Eik Shehr Ki (Story of a City). It was a Lenticular Print that wrapped around three walls of the room, and as you walked alongside the images you seemed to follow a woman walking along the streets of Lahore, Pakistan. It was fascinating! I was also please to see a response project that asked contemporary authors to reply to artworks. The very first one I saw was a writer I teach in my own classes: Robin Hemley."
,,Interesting,4.0,,This is a great little art museum with rolling exhibitions of contemporary art. Well worth a visit if you are interested in thought provoking art.
,,A nice building for poor value exhibitions,1.0,,"This museum features temporary exhibitions such as ""da Vinci : shaping the future"". Behind this pretentious title I found an exhibition of very poor artistic and scientific values. Only ten pages of the codex, with one of them exposed upside down (!!!), and three paintings that were not from da Vinci himself, but from some kind of Italian Renaissance artist ! I discovered these paintings were exposed to mislead the visitor, as they shared the same names as da Vinci paintings that where described with a very small reproduction close to it. In addition, a pretentious parallel was made with local artists whose ""pieces of art"" were exposed in the same exhibition. I think the city of Singapore deserves far better."
,,Something different,5.0,,"Locals get free entry and it's a small fee $10? for tourists.
Definitely worth it as I was over eating and shopping and it was a refreshing change :) I visited the Still Moving exhibition and we walked around until we came across a free guided tour and decided to join."
,,"Visit it again, SAM",4.0,,"I visit often - well, as often as they change the exhibitions.

So I find it pretty difficult to give the experience a rating because that rating would change depenedent of the show at the time?

But.... that said I think the quality of the work and how well it is displayed at SAm is getting better and better.

As a place/building/experience in it's own right - pleasant enough and with a lot more character than many white box galleries."
,,Great asian modern art museum!,4.0,,"This museum set into an old, colonial-style building features some great modern art from all around Asia. It's a great change from all the cultural museums across SEA and definitely worth seeing for everybody who's interested in Modern Art."
,,Innovative !,4.0,,"The Singapore Art Museum is hosted in a beautiful heritage building, easily accessible by tube, in a busy area. They seem to rotate their collection a lot and organise very good temporary exhibition. I spent an hour there but could have easily spent two hours without feeling bored. The staff is friendly and helpful."
,,Good atmosphere and art,4.0,,"Firstly I loved the building, it was more homely than grand architecture like the MET or too modern like the Art Science museum. I only had to pay 5 dollars being a student (and they accept student ID from any country) so it was well worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed the exhibitions that were on, which included a wide range of mediums from photography, installation and paintings. It probably could have accommodated for more works but it wasn't disappointing nonetheless."
,,Lovely Building Interesting Exhibition,5.0,,A beautiful white old building amongst a load of skyscrapers. Very good to see some new artists from different cultures in a large competition covering all media. Very well located for buses and MRT trains.
,,Art lovers should not miss this,4.0,,"Contemporary arts gallery. The exhibition which was ongoing was titled "" Medium of Art - Shapes shifting Materials and Art. There was an exhibition of exhibits from all the Asia pacific region. Some of the themes were hard to understand for a layman. Nevertheless, even for a novice, the exhibits were spectacular and opened our minds to new forms of art. The kinetics biomorphic sculpture, the coal grinder exhibit from Indonesia, Video of the Islands of Sunderbans getting submerged from India, 'No more tears' - display made out of shampoo caps etc. gave us new insights. Definitely worth a visit for both locals and visitors. The location is close to Orchard road and very accessible. Guided tours are also available. This is not a place to see typical paintings and that's what makes it special."
,,"Don't waste your time on this one, see the other museums",2.0,,"Outside of experiencing the intricate kinetic biomorphic sculpture called Custos Cavum (by Choe U-Ram), made out of metal, motors and
machinery, there is not much else worth seeing here. If you only have a short trip to Singapore, you'll get much more out of the Art & Science Museum (which is art in itself) and especially, the Asian Civilizations Museum, where art and beauty in all its practical forms tell a story of the cultures that played a role in Singapore's history."
,,Waste of time,2.0,,"While staying in a new city I'm trying to see the modern art exibits or musuem . So I did in Singapore . If you have nothing better to do , if it is raining , your flight was cancelled , etc go there , otherwise it is waste of time . Very few interesting things in big buldings in many rooms . The most exciting was the nice stuff , in each room there are 2-3 persons , one opening the door , the other is the guard , I have no idea what are they protecting , the plenty of photos ? To summerize : better to spend more time in Botanic Garden , it is unique and big , and nice !
Forget Art Museum go to Botanic Garden !"
,,Take The Guided Tour,5.0,,"Admission fee was SGD10 and it was really worth it. Extensive collection of arts. It was under renovation at our time of visit, but it didn't mar our visit. We were lucky as at the time we were there, the guided tour had just started and we joined in. It was very informative, the guide was very good, a lot of interaction, asking questions that made us think... If your time permits, it's highly recommended to go with the guided tour."
,,A Modern Art Museum,4.0,,"Located in a modern low rise building. The museum had some visually intriguing displays such as the video projection on wood cut-outs of individuals eating or walking giving an illusion of real persons on the move. An interesting lenticular print of Story of a City. The most fascinating peace on display as a part of 'Signature Art Prize 2014' display was 'Custos Cavum' an intricate kinetic biomorphic sculptures out of metal, motor and machinery that bridges the multiple words behind the veil of known reality.
It is worth a visit one in a while to see the modern video and art combined works."
,,Good for art lovers,4.0,,"The Singapore Art Museum has a collection of art from the Asian region. They are interesting and pretty and you could spend 2-3 hours pleasantly entertained. In addition, since it's a refurbished colonial building you get to see what the inside is like. I liked quite a few of the exhibits - there was a giant sculpture made of real hair, a giant sculpture of a man and photos of Japanese scrolls.

However, I wished that the art was little more thought-provoking, or relevant. One exhibit was a giant screen showing the outside of the 'artist's' room, and the other, the inside, which I thought was inane.

Another gripe I have were the giant beanbags in the chapel. I thought it was really cool to lie in them while watching the video, until the lights went on, and I discovered that the surface of the beanbags had disintegrated and flaked. I hope I didn't inhale pieces of beanbag. :/ Time to change those beanbags!"
,,Christmas Eve 2014,4.0,,My wife and I spent about 3 hours here looking at all the exhibitions. There were many films and photographs displayed. I expected more sculptures than was there. Overall it's good.
,,better than National Museum,4.0,,"""what makes art, art?"", to find the answer, you should come to this interesting museum. For me, SAM so much better than National Museum. There's always exhibition in SAM, that's why i fall in love with this place. If you go to SAM, bring your best camera, turn off your mobile phones, and enjoy the art."
,,Must Visit Location,4.0,,Walking in to the Art Museum was a very fortunate things I got to do in Singapore. It seems like a place that lot of things with various interests happens. I liked their exhibitions and enjoyed thoroughly.
,,Thought provoking,5.0,,"I really enjoyed my visit to the SAM. It's an unusual collection of art that provokes you to question ""what art is"" and how you can use art to represent a society and moments is time. I surprisingly found that a couple of hours went quickly and enjoyed the concept in a couple of the exhibitions that you actually participate in its creation.

Rather excentric but good fun. Actually made me understand singapore a little better. Definitely worth the effort."
,,Very random things...,3.0,,"This ""art"" museum had of coarse lots of art stuff inside it, but it also has lots of things (to my thinking), have nothing to do with art. And many of the scenes inside of the museum (especially in the deeper areas) are quite dark. Out of the big number of staff that were there, only 4 decided to explain to us what the piece meant. So we walked out with lots of pictures with no clue what they are. The pieces themselves are quite nice, and unique. Lots of stuff that I would not have thought of at all. If you do wanna come here, you can by MRT to the City Hall station. There is a fee for tourists but free for Singaporeans."
,,Something different,3.0,,Haven't been here for a long time so decided to pay another visit on a rainy Saturday. Free entrance for Singaporeans and PRs. Displays are quite unusual and a few in the special exhibition section weren't quite to our daughter's liking. Worth a visit for something out of the ordinary. Very close to Bras Basah MRT station.
,,well worth a break from the shops to visit,5.0,,The SAM has an interesting mix of mostly Asian contemporary art in a beautiful heritage building. The kinetic sculpture by Choe U-Ram was worth the entry fee on its own but I was disappointed that the brilliant chapel installation and the beautiful Wu Guanzhong gallery were not open this time.
,,A different discovery,5.0,,A nice alternative to the ubiquitous consumerism. A very interesting mix of art on display. We were quite surprised when we found this gem.
,,I wish I could have more time,5.0,,"If you love art and design, you must see this museum. There were some incredible exhibitions. I wish I had more than 2 hours to spend time there. Entry is $10 for adults."
,,Exhibit ambience,3.0,,"Visited about a month ago, October 2014. The ambience of the museum is set from the moment you walk in with the oversized caricature of a man in his bathing suit and running shoes, alluding to a fun and bold display onwards, but frankly it was entertaining but not quriky or invigorating. Kids running around in an exhibition about the senses were also unwelcomed. The crowd mostly unimpressed held little promise for intelligent discussions of the pieces. Bored art students roamed unenthused as some halls were closed that day apparently. Yet somehow, some exhibits were unstoppable! You had to watch, it made you want to play. Would I go back, no. Because it lacked majestic respect for contemporary art."
,,Check Out the Free Night,3.0,,"Other than the building which has a history and interest to it, the overall Art content was less than expected. One advantage was that on Friday evenings, the Art Museum is free - so take advantage of the price to see what you find in the Art, and admire the interesting building."
,,Pretentious,1.0,,"The current exhibit (there isn't any permanent exhibit) features modern art using unusual media. Though there were a few pieces worth looking at, by and large I found the art self-conscious (""Look at me! See how creative I am!"").

The texts (that are supposed to help you make sense of what you are looking at) are pretentious, just so many arty-sounding phrases strung together. You could switch them to totally different artworks, and in most cases, no one would notice the difference.

Even the physical layout is incomprehensible, with many dead-ends and unclear signage."
,,Visits at different times could mean different experiences..,4.0,,"My first and, up till the recent visit, only time to this place way back in 2007 was not a memorable one as they were in between exhibitions, nothing much was on show, definitely not worth time or money spent. During my recent trip, however, I couldn't have been happier - almost every space was occupied and there was so much to see, watch, do! Besides, now there is the additional space of Art at 8Q just around the corner and there was an exhibition on there too! So, do check out their website or Facebook page to see what's on before you visit to make sure it's worth your time, effort and money.

The museum is probably one of the easiest to get to - just alight at the Bras Basah MRT station, get out and the building is within sight. Admission fee is S$10 for (adult) foreigners and it covers admissions to the (main) museum as well as the extended space, Art at 8Q.

The main building itself, converted from a previous Catholic boys school, is charming as most of the indication that it was so are left intact. There are cafes and a gift shop within the building and lockers too for S$1 if you don't feel like lugging your stuff around. Most of the time non-flash photography is allowed but do check before you snap away.

I'm only giving very general information via my review and photos as I feel this is best as you may come at different times and have a different experience. The Sensorium 360o, Medium at Large, People & Places and Still Moving exhibitions were on when I'd visited, which were all great exhibitions, so, I had a great time and my rating is based on this. However like I'd mentioned earlier, it'd be wise to check out their website/Facebook page to see what's on then decide if you should or not pay a visit."
,,A Must,5.0,,"A must place to visit for art lovers. Not as big as Louvre nor as spectacular of Academia, but this museum boasts some of the bests modern art collections! I've been visiting SG for many times now, and I cant believe I just went to this place now! It was worth it!"
,,Cool Museum!,3.0,,"when i'm there.. back in june 2013. it was so quiet for an art gallery on sunday afternoon.. i guess maybe because there was no event on that day and few exhibition are on maintenance. only few people visited this museum n that situation makes me not really happy during my visit.

(+) so many young talented artist put their artwork here. (interactive installation, painting, movie, etc)
(+) the building design is very good. i love the layout, exterior, interior.. great for taking photos.

(-) the admission is quite expensive for foreigner (10 SGD)."
,,Brilliant art installations,5.0,,I love everything about the current exhibition taking place at SAM. The sensorium and medium at large exhibitions are fantastic. Lots of interactions with your five senses and so much fun. Staff at SAM are friendly and would take their time to explain each and every installations. Definitely worth going if you are in Singapore.
,,SG culture at its most accessible,4.0,,"One of the many things at which SG excels.... museums! I occasionally drop in with friends and their kids to ""do the art thing"". I have to admit that I am pretty traditional and unimaginative: I tend to like pictures (1) the subject of which I recognise; (2) that ""look pretty""! This gallery features contemporary art (and installations) ..... Love the pieces or hate them, the work always provokes discussion and emotional response.... Sometimes revulsion! It is a small building and very attractive architecturally and the staff couldn't be nicer. There are 2 or 3 eating places on site. Offsite, just around the corner, there is a food court (Kopitiam) and dim sum restaurant (Din Tai Fung) - Gr8 if you are a visitor and want to sample local food while you are here. You can re-enter the gallery after lunch/all day. The best way to get here is by MRT as Bras Basah (on the yellow/circle line) is right by the gallery. I usually get a bit lost using the bus (to get to the gallery) because of the one way system, though in my case getting home is no prob as the bus stop for the return journey is very close.

My latest visit was to the ""Sensorium 360"" exhibition which explored the use of our senses in understanding ourselves and the world around us... This was very interactive and excellent for children. It is so good to be able to introduce them to all this arty stuff without having to say ""Shhhhh!"" all the time!"
,,Half Day Trip,5.0,,"Touring Singapore is extremely easy not just because it's just the size of a city in most major countries but also because of its public transportation, it's extremely efficient, comfortable and affordable. But at the same time it can be quite daunting in site seeing in this tropical island because he weather is hot and humid. So the best way to enjoy site seeing is to divide them into indoor and outdoor, and time of the day.

Since the noon day heat can cook an egg in Singapore, the best thing to do at this time is to visit the art district area which located at Bras Basah MRT train station. In this area you can spend about 4 hours visiting some of the major museums and galleries, another words escape from the heat. Once you get off this station the first museum you will see is Singapore Art Museum also known as SAM for short. It's a white Victorian building, not huge but home to some impressive art works. There is also a DOME Cafe at the corner of the building which has a nice ambient to chill out with a cup of coffee after the visit. For more update info on the shows check out the link http://www.singaporeartmuseum.sg

Directly opposite SAM you will see a park where Singapore Management University(SMU) is located, you can walk through the park and it will get you to another major museum, National Museum of Singapore. This short walk will be quite pleasant because of the shades provided by the big trees. This is another white Victorian building complete with a dome but a lot bigger than SAM, you won't miss it. In this museum it has a Singapore History Gallery which I like it very much, it also offer free daily guided tour in English at 11am and 2pm from Mondays to Fridays, 11.30am, 2pm and 3.30pm on Saturdays and Sundays. For more updated details you might wanna check out the site http://www.nationalmuseum.sg
This museum usually put up a few shows at once, you can easily spend a good 2 hours or more if you are into history, culture and art. Not to worry if you get tired from walking, inside National Museum of Singapore, there are a bar & restaurant and a cafe, and of cause gift shop if you need to take a break.

If you want more museums visiting, step out of National Museum of Singapore turn right at the main road, walk down to a junction where you will see Armenian Street, turn right again and walk down about 5 min or less and you will see another interesting museum, the Peranakan Museum. This walk you will get some fair amount of sun but it's not too bad. Here is the link to find out more about the current events in this museum. http://www.peranakanmuseum.org.sg/home/home.html

Hope this post help :)"
,,Art,5.0,,"I saw a wonderful photography display by Annie Leibovitz and was able to purchase one of her beautiful photography books. Their staff were very nice and Andy even suggested a restaurant that I might like, he also makes wonderful coffee."
,,Interactive,4.0,,I always enjoy visiting museums when I travel. SAM had interactive exhibits and was definitely an interesting visit.
,,Heritage building holds contemporary surprises,5.0,,The Singapore Art Museum is a great escape from the hustle and bustle of the city and it has a great collection of contemporary and traditional art. The cafe is grand and stylish and the food on offer is delicious.
,,LOVE it!,5.0,,"SAM is a must for those who visit Singapore. Interactive exhibitions on three levels help to experience the art more profound. Located just near metro station, with Italian restaurant just nearby. And stickers: ART - NO EXPERIENCE NEEDED to be placed on the glass are with me every time I drive."
,,a place I visit > 5 times year,5.0,,"It helps that entrance is free for a local like me but I have been frequenting this place for the past 10 years or so. Entrance is free for all on Friday evenings till its closing at 9pm. There are several changes of exhibits a year and though I find some of the modern installation art too abstract/contrived, there is still enough interesting and thought provoking things there that draws me back.

SAM is housed in an intimate former boys' school and I enjoyed strolling through the galleries on Fri evenings to space out at the end of the work week. Don't forget to check out the extension at 8QSAM located 40 m diagonally behind SAM. My fav eating place there is the coffee shop along waterloo street just 50m away from 8QSAM, it serves the best Indian rojak and pretty good chicken rice."
,,de facto national musuem of singapore,4.0,,"personally i like SAM more than the Grand Old Dame which is the National Musuem of Singapore.
Night Festival elevated SAM once again to the spot light but the best time as always is visiting it on a normal weekday. I like the architecture and its well curated portfolio of contemporary art with emphasis on South East Asia. Stay real, be more independent, a museum where old and new Singapore converge."
,,Don't miss light show this last weekend in August!,5.0,,For you that read this soon do not miss the light exhibit this weekend and the harp playing gentleman. Go on their website and check it out. It was amazing!!! Free and awesome.
,,Worth to visit,5.0,,"Much better than I expected. I even though why I didn't visit all these years. I joined museum tour (complimentary), it was helping me that much better understanding about the art pieces. Very close to Raffles/Conrad/Mandarin/Pan Pacific hotels. Entrance fee is $10 per person/Adult."
,,Awesome and unique art museum,4.0,,"As yet another new place to see in my yearly return trip to Singapore, I decided on yet another museum, this time being the art museum (or SAM as they like to call it), and have to say it was a really cool place to visit! not by any means one of those boring places where you listen to a curator drone on about whatever. You can take it at your own pace and see things as you want. For visitors it's $10 and there are many different floors to see the different exhibitions and all the presentations are supplemented with descriptions.

A cool fact is that where the museum is presently set up in, used to be the first Catholic chapel in the country and in itself, has a really nice ornate look to it both from the outside and in.
There is lots more to discover and one can view everything on the museum's official website which is linked on the actual Trip Advisor review page for this museum. I had a great time and spent one hour and forty five minutes total going through all the floors and viewing all the displays, installations and paintings.

Despite the website giving directions, I will share the quickest way on how to get there.
To start, get off at the City Hall MRT junction and walk out to the exit labeled St. Andrew's Cathedral.
Next, once reaching the street level, walk directly right to the nearest intersection. (It's here at this first intersection that either before or after your visit, right across the street is Raffles City which is a decent size shopping center that features Robinson's as one of the anchor stores. For the underground level, there are a plethora of eateries to choose from along with a supermarket (and includes a place called 'The Cocoa Trees' and is a huge candy shop featuring mostly chocolates but sells a favorite of mine and is the alcohol infused Remi Martin chocolate bar although they have other brands as well that have chocolate as well).

Anyways, once you cross this first intersection of North Bridge Road and Stamford Road, keep walking past Raffles Place till you reach the very next intersection of North Bridge Road and what will now be Bras Basah Road. It's here that you will want to cross the street now heading west along Bras Basah Road and no longer up NBR. From there, it's just two blocks up and just past the POSB Center and the museum will be on the right hand side.
Enjoy!"
,,Not a bad way to kill a couple of hours,4.0,,"I haven't been back for a few years, the last time was when they were undergoing major renovations or something and admission was free. Then they had a new exhibit called Sensorium 360 which had just opened a few days ago.

Paid the $10 (tourist rate, locals enter for free), and another $2 for storage locker for my luggage. They have free entry on Friday nights.

It was not a bad way to kill an hour or two, especially in hot Singapore."
,,July 2014 Visit,3.0,,"We were lucky enough to be in Singapore on a national holiday when many museums have free admission - even for the tourists. We were able to visit SAM for free and it was a nice visit. It was a good introduction to modern art for my son - he was able to see some very interesting pieces. I thought the descriptions were well done. The museum had a number of activities going on for children the day we were there - maybe because of the holiday. There were at least 4-5 different art activities the kids could participate in. Not a very big museum, but it is in a lovely old building. Worth a visit."
,,Lovely museum complex in gracious old building,4.0,,"We enjoyed our visit here. We spent about 2 hours on the current year long exhibition exploring modern art and how contemporary artists are reinventing medium and for. We were presented with some provocative pieces that made us stop and think more often than some recent exhibitions we've attended have. The interpretive signage was excellent. I liked the fact that the works were well spaced across the rooms available rather than being crowded. I also liked that many of the artists were Asian, so new to us.

My only negative is that navigating around the place, which is big, is confusing ... And at 3.45pm on a Friday the museum shop was closed."
,,Easy to get to and a great alternative to shopping!,5.0,,"This is the best day out I've had my whole trip. If you're tired of shopping, the museum is only a few stops down from orchard & you can switch at many stations to get here. The price to get in is great - $10 for adults $5 for students w/ID. Really friendly staff that help you if you're lost. The museum is literally right across the road from the Bras Basah MRT, so you won't get lost. It was a shame half the museum was closed due to installation of another exhibition coming in august but the Medium at Large exhibition was fabulous!"
,,for me..it was ok..,3.0,,"I personally had high hopes for this gallery...but it was mainly modern art & not quite my taste, but hey...but please dont let me put you off! Art is to taste...the presentation is great in all formats...felt weird being in the hospital church, now used as a gallery....still giving you the sense that its always going to look like a church!.......great building though!!!"
,,a mordern art museum,5.0,,"Very good collection ; regular event and exhibition ; promotion of Asian artists. You must visit it!
The Singapore Art Museum presents contemporary art practices of Singapore and the Southeast Asian region. SAM has amassed one of the world's largest public collections of modern and contemporary Southeast Asian artworks, with a growing component in international contemporary art."
,,"stunning building, average collection",3.0,,"I love the old-vintage-building, the exterior and interior.
but that's all.
There were only view showroom open, with less collections. I don't feel this museum is fit with ""art museum"" since I feel it was less artsy.
Then, I went to SAM and expect more modern art collection. But again, I dissapointed because all I found was photos collection.
However, the building was really stunning, so I spend more time to admire the beauty and took photos of it.
too bad I didn't have time to sit back and sip coffee and the cafe at that time, since I need to rush to another place."
,,Contemporary Art galore,3.0,,"It was OK, but not what I wanted to spend time on while in Singapore. Lots of contemporary art that you can find most anywhere. Fortunately, if you go on a Friday night, entrance is free after 6."
,,Only go if you like modern art,4.0,,"This is not an art museum for tourists. It's an art museum for artists and people who like modern and contemporary art.
For me it was great because it articulated some of the discomfort I have been feeling over the last few days about y the sterility and suppression of self expression I perceived in the environment.
Unearthed in the main building was excellent. The secondary building, q8 not so much.
So go if you would go to an art museum at home. Otherwise go somewhere else."
,,Average,3.0,,"Very convenient and strategic place, near Bras Basah MRT station and walkable from Bugis. Moreover, a lot of food places around the museum and bus stations as well. There are various exhibitions and some of them are interactive. It is worth for $10 tho. But there are not many stuffs inside"
,,A Fantistic Museum,5.0,,"This is the first stop during my stays in Singapore. The variety or shows and artist shown is outstanding and extremely well curated. I am always amazed at the diversity of imagery and thought put in to staging each show they have. There is also a good cafe and excellent restaurant on the premise. I always look forward to being amazed at what I see there. Hint, hint, how about a show sometime?"
,,nuts and bolts,3.0,,At the beginning of my tour I was shown into a darkened room where I saw some bright shiny objects.they were made out of nuts and bolts.this was the only highlight of my visit.the museum is in a fine old colonial building.
,,marvelous building!,3.0,,it is amazing to visit there at night! it is so beautiful!!! and you can enjoy free entry on Friday night! and it is near Bras Basah MRT station! very convenient!
,,Very disappointed,1.0,,Did not find any part of this museum worth seeing. A lot of the walls were empty or even entire room closed off. The artwork that was there was uninspiring. After getting lost and getting trapped in the lift for 30mins I'd had enough and left very disappointed. The only saving grace was that the entry fee also included entry to the childrens art museum round the corner! 100x better than the main museum but still an overall mediocre day out.
,,Disappointing,1.0,,"For the admission fee you get to see pretty much, well... Nothing. The museums kind of a joke. For contemporary art, browse through private galleries."
,,lovely art museum,4.0,,"Lovely calm small museum, don't expect the Tate Modern or MOMA but still a nice way to kill a few hours. Lovely historical old colonial building sympathetically restored. Well curated exhibitions of modern art. I really enjoyed it, perfect as we didn't have the time to do a bigger museum."
,,So So,2.0,,"I do not find the museum interesting at all. Been to better ones but kudos to all the staff assigned in each display area, they are very knowledgable about the work on display and they would at the snap of a finger readily share this to you. Would recommend you to visit Asian Civilization Museum instead for a well sent afternoon. Over all feeling after visiting SAM, empty, big gallery but few displays, and the displays are maybe "" too modern "" for me ?"
,,There's nothing much to see,3.0,,"We went here last Sunday (27 April, 2014). We thought that we will be spending at least 4 hours to explore the Museum but we were wrong. The Museum is very small. It only comprises of 3 storey and there's nothing much to see.

No interesting activity. Though, they have a lot of short films that you can watch from each galleries - Indie films.

The only good thing I liked with this Museum was the ventilation. It is fully covered of a glass walls and it is airconditioned. Toilet is also well maintained and the Staff were all friendly.

Flash is not allowed. They allow you to use a tripod - but don't bother to bring it as there is nothing much to see. You can wear a comfortable rubber shoes to explore the place.

You only need less than 1 hour to see everything. For us, we only spent less than 30 minutes.

Just like the other review, as a tourist visiting this place for $10/person is not worth it. Don't disappoint yourself. Better, skip and find other interesting attractions in Singapore."
,,Limited collection but a nice vibe,3.0,,"The museum itself isn't very big so it has a limited amount of display space (though having said that it was not all being used). There is a strong focus on modern art. I think if you are expecting something like the tate or moma you will be disappointed, but it is a nice museum for what it is."
,,"Enjoyable but relatively small modern, contemporary collection",3.0,,"Perhaps not as 'average' as the Tripadvisor score allows, SAM is at least interesting for having completely embraced modern and contemporary art. The exhibitions on display - Unearthed, Not Against Interpretation and the permanent Learning Gallery - traversed a wide variety of mediums including sculpture, installation, moving image, photography and more. There is a separate smaller gallery around the corner from the main building (the old Mission on Bras Basah Rd), so keep your sticker and follow the arrows out front.
The whole visit probably takes around 1 to 2 hours, depending on how many galleries are open. The shop is small but has some nice pieces to take home."
,,Very poor - not worth visiting,1.0,,I have been to many museums and galleries over the years large and small. Even helped designed a few. This is the first time I have been disappointed and left feeling ripped off despite the relatively small entrance fee. The works we saw were very poor and very few. Most student exhibitions I have seen were more interesting and better resolved. In addition several areas of the museum were closed off. The art seemed secondary to the restaurants dotted around the building. Did not visit the annex. If you want to inspire your children to see more art this is not the place to go. To top it all off the staff we met were not friendly. Left and went to the ArtScience Museum instead.
,,The art museum,4.0,,"One thing I like most about Singapore is the easiness of travelling. MRT services can literally bring you to anywhere in Singapore. As for Museum, I would said that it is quite interesting although I am not a very artistic person. The admission is very reasonable with just 10 sgd. I saw a great deal of classical art collections in which I found to be very fine and beautiful. Most of the collections are acquisition from south east asia and I think only a small proportion of them is from the wider asian region. Nonetheless, if you're someone who wish to know more about this region of the world and I recommend you paying here a visit."
,,Very disappointing,2.0,,"Free for locals and PRs, but not worth the $10 for visitors and EP holders. Just wasted an hour of my life on this one. Maybe the xhibitions will improve, but dont bother at the moment."
,,Modern art fare for visitors,4.0,,Great selection of local artists with a wide range and mixture of art styles. Interesting perspective on the local art culture.
,,A nice interlude,3.0,,"Singapore Art Museum is easily recognised and easily accessible given it has an MRT stop darn near around the corner from it. It also is possible to get a ticket for it that also covers your entry to the National Museum and the Peranakan Museum so you can really push your money further by taking this option.

The attraction itself has a quality exactly in proportion to your desire to look at a range of traditional and some abstract art pieces. If this is your thing you'll probably enjoy it, if you are not so keen on such things you'll probably just saunter through it at a relaxed pace, taking in the sights before heading on to one of the other aforementioned museums.

The gift shop here was not as well supplied with relevant items as that of the National Museum on my visit."
,,we got in for free!,4.0,,"too bad when we arrived they were putting up installations and only one gallery was open. despite this, they let us in free of charge and the staff was accommodating and very helpful.
inspite of that, we had a great time visiting the museum.

you might want to check out Food For Thought. a restaurant beside the museum. they serve breakfast all day with great tasting food, friendly staff and artsy ambiance."
,,very nice art museum,5.0,,The exhibitions in the SAM were pretty good. And the place is huuuge. After we finished in the first building it continued in another building across the street. If you go there on a friday after 6pm it's free entry.
,,Best art place in Singapore,5.0,,"Visited SAM during Singapore Biennale of the year. It's free admission on the last day. Great art pieces were displayed. Many of the art works are new, emotion touching and it's a great experience. It's not really a ""Museum"" displaying old well known expensive pieces. It's more like a great gallery, displaying carefully selected pieces which will touch the every emotion in us."
,,Great biennale,5.0,,I've always enjoyed this art museum but this visit was even better. It was the core of the Singapore Art Bienniale and it was full of wonderful installations and art work. I went on a great tour led by a delightful and informative volunteer. An afternoon well spent.
,,SAM during Biennale 2013,4.0,,I liked that the museum offered foreign student discounts on tickets. The Biennale tickets are good for a single entry at 3 different museums so I didn't feel rushed to visit 3 museums in a single day.
,,Interesting place,5.0,,"I have never been that much of a art fan, but this is actually quite interesting place. Situated near National Museum, so easy to spend whole afternoon in these two places. MRT station near, so easy to get, Check all pictures, so you get good impression what kind of place it is"
,,Nice place,3.0,,If an art museum is good its always if you like the exhibition. This time it was not to my liking. BUT the museum is a great place.
,,The 2013 Biennale is superb,5.0,,"Spent an afternoon taking in the Biennale. The quality of the work on display ranged from good to extraordinary. Admission, was the best 10 Singapore dollars we spent on our visit. The Singapore Art Museum should be on all visitors' list of to-do."
,,Go for Biennale,5.0,,You will see lots of great contemporary works from Southeast Asian artists. Different language museum guides and lectures are great. Don't forget 8Q SAM nearby. Please give yourself for more than one day to visit the biennale.
,,Check out the Singapore Biennale before it ends!,5.0,,"Until 16th February 2014, there's the Singapore Biennale going on at several sites in Singapore. SAM is the main site - with lots of interesting installations, a few of interactive ones (my favourite is a visual and audio installation from teamlab on level 3!).

Besides the Biennale works, there are also several on-going exhibitions, which you will enjoy too. Allocate at least 1-2 hours to cover the whole place.

Entry is free for Singaporeans and PRs, SGD 5 for students and SGD 10 for foreigners - you can use the same ticket to get into SAM @ 8Q, National Museum of Singapore, Peranakan Museum - for the rest of the Biennale art work."
,,This is a review for 8Q SAM,4.0,,"Definitely not everyone's cup of tea. During our visit there on Monday, January 6, 2014, there was a good mix of interesting, thought-provoking, and WHAAA??? art on display. I'd say visit regardless of how you feel about art. Keep an open mind."
,,Absolutely Amazing..!,5.0,,"Wasn't planning on going here but so glad I did.
I spent around 5 hours taking my time... would have spent longer had it not been closing time.
Some amazing contemporary works. Some a bit weird for me - but then that's art.
The interactive, musical, holographic, Asian dancers in the dark on the top floor were outstanding! Best thing I've seen in a while.
Some big visual pieces to mull over around the museum... some born out of not so nice events.
Also, plenty of video installations to take a seat and give one's feet a break.
Staff very approachable and friendly.
Thoroughly recommend this place!"
,,Singapore Biennale 2013- If the world changed,3.0,,"I went to the art museum with a friend. Even though I am a local, its my first time being there for the Biennale and only my second visit to the Singapore art museum.
Please note that there are 2 buildings - the main and the building at 8Q. So do plan your time accordingly. There are 3 levels for the main singapore art museum and 4 levels for the one at 8Q. My friend and I, had to rushed as we started touring the museum at about 345pm and they closed by 7pm. Their contact number is 6332 3222.
A ticket will gain an individual one entry to the that museum for the day.
I must admit that I am not too enthralled modern art and I better appreciate the art from the byzantine or the renaissance period. Therefore I briefly browsed those which piqued my interest."
,,Don't miss the holograms!,5.0,,"Originally wasn't planning on coming here, but it was included with the admission to the National Singapore Museum so I decided to swing by. Ended up being really impressed! There was a special exhibition (called Peace Can Be Realised Even Without Order) with interactive holograms which was really interesting. There are sensors so that when you get near the holograms they would change what they were doing!"
,,A testament to modern art,4.0,,"The Singapore Art Museum (referred to as SAM) is centrally located and a short walking distance from several other museums. It contains one of the world's the largest collections of modern southeast Asian art. The day we were here, the Singapore Biennale was on, so we were able to also see this exhibition, and visit the rest of the Biennale in several other museums for no additional cost.

This is a museum of modern art, so that is what you will see. As a relatively young country, Singapore embraces the modern and the innovative. If modern art is not your thing, try some of the other museums. The range of works is intriguing, displaying a different sensibility from modern western art. The works can be challenging, as is the gallery layout.

Originally built as a Catholic boys' school, construction began in 1855. This historic building was converted to the gallery in the 1990s. The building retains that old school building feeling, with long corridors and lots of rooms. You spend a lot of walking around and doubling back. But hey, you are going here for the art, right?

Definitely worth a visit."
,,Really enjoyed my visit,5.0,,Went there during the Singapore Biennale. We took a guided tour. There is not better way to know a country then through it's art. Well worth the visit.
,,"Weird, weird, art",2.0,,"It was so hot on our tour day in Singapore that we went here to get some AC (yes, it's air conditioned) and see some cool art. Unfortunately, the art isn't that good. The layout is confusing. You can't wander from room to room like most galleries. You have to back track constantly. And so much of the art is totally weird. There was ""art"" where you entered a room, but a level on your head, and chanted. There was ""art"" of a strange movie that was just creepy. There was ""art"" of close up photos of unshaven armpits and hair follicles. There was ""art"" of blank white pieces of paper. Each came with long descriptions justifying their work and the meaning of it. Skip this."
,,South East Asian art,4.0,,Great range of south East Asian art. I would recommend this gallery for fans of mod-art. Some interesting collections and the building itself is quite beautiful.
,,Interesting visit to Singapore Art Museum,4.0,,"We were fortunate to catch the Singapore Biennale 2013 exhibits at SAM - with the theme ""If the world changed"". Works of Asean countries' artists were on display. Their work was very creative as it took all forms - 3D, holograms, real-life, etc. The way the theme was worked into their pieces was thought-provoking and contemporary. We found most of the exhibits very engaging as it deepened one's understanding of the sociocultural, economic, aesthetic and ideological complexities of the Asean region."
,,Beautiful building,3.0,,"The best part about this museum is the building it is housed in. Unfortunately I couldn't find any information on the history of the building onsite and had to ask professor google. Although the ticket was $10, it allowed entry into a number of other fee-paying museums."
,,Singapore Art Museum,5.0,,"The museum, then known as the Fine Arts Museum, was borne out of a project by the National Museum to set up a five-museum precinct in the city.
I have visited Singapore Art Museum (SAM) twice times and found very interesting.
Visitors to both SAM and SAM at 8Q can expect to find an interactive, living centre for the arts, presenting a diversity of contemporary art genres – from painting, sculpture, installation, film and video, photography, new media, to performance and sound art. SAM’s permanent collection is displayed on a rotational basis, accompanied by frequent changing exhibitions that present the best of recent art from museums, galleries and private collections in the region."
,,Really nice. Worth it,4.0,,"Not only the museum itself is great, but the area were it is located as well. The building used to be a school, lucky students! Absolutely beautiful!! Exhibitions are really nice and different from everything I've ever seen. Recommended"
,,Free Fridays 6-9pm,3.0,,"Now first of all I am not a modern art fan, and the only reason I went in was because it was free on Fridays between 6pm and 9pm (Normal price $10). I just can't see how a pile of beans is art, if this is the case I make art each evening for my children and they make more art on the floor which my wife calls a mess. Put this aside, there are 3 floors of rooms with things in on one building and then just around the corner there is another building with rooms and things in (one room didn't have anything in and it was still art). The buildings are well kept and there were helpfull staff to show you around. The building itself is a little interesting and has been restored. Some thought has gone into making glass corridors on the balconies so you can move around in the comfort of aircon. For me there were still a few good paintings that I found interesting and some art that time had obviously gone into making them. Even though I walked hastily between rooms with piles of beans, or bits of wood on the floor I still spent over an hour wondering around the 2 buildings. There is a free tour, that you can join but you will have to be very interested as they spend quite a time at each exibit.
My suggestion is to pass by on Free Friday evenings."
,,Some really challenging exhibits,5.0,,"I am in no way an art critic or an art buff, however I found this museum highly enjoyable. Most of the exhibits were stimulating or challenging, however it is a relatively small museum, you couldn't exhaust more than 2 hours here. The art is all contemporary, but covers a wide range of subjects and themes. Another bonus is that the $10 ticket also gives you access to the national museum."
,,"Great building, exhibits disappointing",3.0,,"A beautifully preserved Colonial building that has been transformed into an art gallery that provides an intimate setting for its exhibits. Unfortunately, the the majority of the exhibits are modern installations and the overall feel is that of an end of year Art School students display. Maybe we're just unlucky with the exhibits when we visited. Visitors writing their own post it notes and sticking them on the wall, flickering video loops of famous speeches by world leaders are just two examples lacking originality."
,,Disappointed with exhibits,2.0,,"The museum is housed in two separate buildings. The main museum is in a lovely building! I wasn't too happy, however, with the exhibits. Very contemporary art - but I found it disappointing and wish the art could have been more sensible, more meaningful."
,,easy to spend 2 hours here...,5.0,,The Good =) ~Has a permanent exhibition that features famous local artistes. ~Sometimes the visiting exhibition is impressive! The Bad =( ~Limited parking. ~Limited F&B options. My Tip for future visits: ~Sign up for the guided tour by the experienced docent.
,,Incredible sights,5.0,,"Visiting the art gallery in Singapore, I was amazed at the beauty of the wall hangings.Birds in bejewelled settings, when one claps their hands the birds start their beautiful melodic sounds. The pictures light up and it becomes a sight of such beauty.
This museum should not be overlooked when visiting Singapore. Photos taken are treasured as such beauty is nowhere to be found. I have travelled the world, yet have never found such beauty."
,,An Architectural Beauty,4.0,,"This is located in the renovated old St. Joseph's Institution building from the 1800s. The magnificent structure, facade, corridors, columns, courtyards and chapel have been faithfully preserved. The museum incorporates a cafe, sushi bar, and three restaurants on the ground floor. There is also a museum shop on the premises.

The collection comprises traditional and contemporary artworks by local and regional artists. The current exhibitions were on modern and abstract artworks.

Strolling through the historic premises, hallowed corridors and rooms proved nostalgic."
,,Displays closed,2.0,,"The building is beautiful, and air conditioned! However most of the display galleries are closed for rennovations. We got to go in 3 galleries only and there wasn't much in them. It imagine it would be a great place to go to if the galleries were open but it was very disappointing"
,,Restored old boy's school,5.0,,"I invite all visitors to this old boys school which has been transformed into an art gallery. This place holds found memories of 19th Century Singapore, including the chapel and the status of Jean Baptist delaSalle. The church of Saint Peter and Paul is just behind this building and worth a visit as well"
,,Great place for playdates and family outings with kids!,5.0,,"Many different rooms with interactive activities and experiences from hands-on art & craft, videos/movies, and AV experiential activities, which are suitable for the whole family.

The only bad point is the many flights of stairs that visitors have to climb up and down, as the rooms are located across several floors. Not ideal when there are older folk or parents with strollers and very young children."
,,Excellent collection,4.0,,"Interesting modern art, we saw an exhibition on modern art in middle east asia. Not too many pieces, which helps to concentrate on the individual piece and artist. Interesting background information is provided on any of the artists and works. The only drawback as in all museums of Singapore and Malaysia: the air con is often set to a freezing 18 degress Celsius, so don't forget a sweater."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Great interesting works by surrounding countries. Fresh ideas on art where presented which we found quite fascinating. Some of the subjects were confronting but in a was you wanted to dig deeper and get very involved. The support staff were very knowledgable which added to in depth explanations and how and why some of the local art works became the final product.

Well worth the time. Very easy to get to. Also it looked like a great interactive section for kids."
,,My Revisit,4.0,,"Having been stationed in Singapore a long time ago. I took my wife for a holiday there.One of the attractions was the Art Museum. I am no genuine art lover, but my wife is, She enjoyed the visit, and I was impressed by the different styles of western and Chinese, and Myala art, We thoroughly enjoyed our time there. The catering was very good,"
,,Fascinating Singapore!,5.0,,"We visited Singapore and one of the places that is interesting to visit is the Art Musuem. All the facilities around are world class. The exhibit at that time is Titanic and we were so happy to see the replica of everything shown in the movie. We were immersed to the thoughts of being in that ship many years back. How nostalgic!
A visit to Singapore is always what we are looking for, although we were there several times because there is always something new in your next visit."
,,An excellent guided tour,4.0,,We were encouraged to join a guided tour and although we hadn't planned to do this it was actually a good thing to do. We had a knowledgeable and pleasant volunteer who showed us around and talked about the art on exhibit. The Art Museum is in a beautiful old Jesuit school and is quite a lovely old colonial building. We enjoyed this Museum and also went and looked in the additional space across the road that had a great number of exhibitions aimed at children. This was included in the price and as a teacher who loves teaching art I found this well worth viewing too.
,,"Terms & Conditions, and other local works",5.0,,"Was there on 30 Aug to just check out Justin Lee's works, but there were so many interesting pieces by local and regional artists that I just have to rate this ""excellent""! Jason Wee's Self Portrait (No More Tears Mr Lee) is one of the more thought-provoking pieces there. I don't want to launch into an art critique, but let's just say that you ought to look carefully at the entire installation to get that statement, a political statement. I stress ""entire"". Terms & Conditions surprised me with its curation of works. I was especially intrigued by Sharif Waked's To Be Continued... and Chic Point. Especially the latter: using fashion to make a (political) statement. I missed the Night Fest, but was back on 31 Aug to catch the rest of the museum action at night with my wife. It was really a hype full of vibe even late into the night! They're open till 2am, I don't know why, for that night. I wish it'd been less packed. The security looked overwhelmed. It seemed to be free entry to all. I was lucky to have had visited it in a less crowded hour to enjoy the works in a more reflective mood."
,,Very nice museum,4.0,,It is a very nice contemporary museum and has lots of activities for kids. The location is also very close to MRT Station and getting there is no problem at all. My kids love the museum and the activities it offers
,,Fun&Interactive Children's Exhibits,4.0,,We went to the children's exhibits during the June school hols. Entrance is now free for all Singapore citizens and I think Permanent Residents. It was v fun for the kids below 10 years cos of the interactive exhibits. Eg painted black and white walls where children are asked to spot hidden pictures (like Where's Wally? Game) and a sound wall where movement is projected on screen when we make sounds into a mike. The permanent exhibits were quite interesting like showcasing of local art movie features but we didn't go to all the permanent exhibits. Good to bring the kids during weekends!
,,Great children's exhibit until September,4.0,,"We needed a rainy day activity for the kids (1 and 4 years old). The Singapore Arts Museum has a great children's exhibit until 1 September. It's not in the main building but a very short walk away (with good signage).

Occupied our 4 year old for hours dashing around and doing the interactive components. Even the 1 year old was excited by the colorful exhibits.

Inexpensive tickets."
,,Good day out for kids at the Garden,4.0,,Singapore Arts Garden provided a great day out for the kids. The exhibits and the accompanying activities kept my two boys (4 & 7) entertained for 4 hours on a raining afternoon. Good value for money and fun for kids.
,,Great works - friendly staff,5.0,,"MRT Bras Basah station - short hop, skip and half jump to SAM.

Walter was out the front!!
Great building and grounds, including a nice cafe/bar.

The staff were very friendly. There were some great works.
Child friendly, and a lot of interactive installations.

The in-house shop, ""Museum Label"", also has friendly helpful staff, and a variety of good merchandise.

I purchased a number of items, including an inflatable ""Walter"". There was a little manufacturing issue with the ""Walter"" I purchased, and the staff were fantastic in assisting me in rectifying the issue via email, even though I had already returned to Sydney.

Great team all-round."
,,Great kids exhibition,5.0,,"Took our kids, 4 & 7 to the special exhibition for kids. They loved it, and us big kids enjoyed it too. Spent the best part of three hours there. The short films on show are well done and well worth sitting through."
,,Take time out from busy Singapore,5.0,,"The Singapore Art Museum is an amazing place to have timeout from the tourist attractions and shopping malls in Singapore. The art is interesting, the museum is well set out in a heritage building and the shop sells some lovely gifts and treasures."
,,Good for the soul!,5.0,,"Art may not be the first thing you think of when you come to Singapore but you are forgetting the long Chinese heritage of art. Chinese art is particularly delightful as it draws from different cultural roots. The use of black and white, often ink is a wonderful new experience. ENJOY!"
,,They take care the Museum Well,3.0,,"Located in the middle of City, Bras Basah near Bugis is a nice place to go around when you stay in near there. The cost about 10$, no too expensive.

The building is a heritage, but they take care the museum well. Before you go check at their official website to see what exhibition being there.

The Museum also has extended building outside. Don't forget to go there also. No need to pay more, included the first ticket."
,,"Not bad, when all exhibits are on",3.0,,"A nice enough museum, if a tad pricey, but my visit saw about half of the exhibits being replaced, meaning that the somewhat steep cost of entry was made relatively event more expensive.

There are days, I think Friday mornings, when entry is free. And entrance to the museum's secondary building around the corner is included."
,,Colonial Building Nicely Preserved,4.0,,"This small museum was a colonial heritage building that was nicely restored and preserved.

Nicely contrasted by the contemporary art exhibited therein.

Don't miss the souvenir store at the ground level that is connected by the inner yard.

There is also a spanish restaurant 'Via Mar' next to the store. Nice dish."
,,Fantastic gallery guide!,4.0,,"Visited SAM last week when a few galleries were closed due to change over, this could have been a real downer however instead it was amazing due to a great gallery guide! Susan walked me around the Presidents Talents show with such enthusiasm and knowledge giving me a deeper understanding of Singapore both current and past.
Amazing building and great location."
,,It's ok,4.0,,"A beautiful building in itself, the gallery has several different sub galleries which host different exhibitions."
,,Nice Museum,5.0,,"This is a nice little museum, but lacks all depth of information. The building and setting of this museum is fantastic. A colonial building and former school with various room and courtyards to set the backdrop of the art work."
,,Not bad.,4.0,,"This museum is in a great location and in a wonderful old colonial style building which contrasts nicely with the contemporary art displayed. I saw the ""Weight of History"" exhibition. The artworks displayed were interesting. It was worth the visit."
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"The art museum is a very nice building and is conveniently located. It does house some works by prominent local artists but certainly is nothing of great note beyond that. They had a nice display of Dale Chiluly glass umbrellas but those are no longer displayed. There are several galleries in Singapore that have very good collections and UOB Bank also has some good works as they sponsor a competition.

Is it worth a visit? Well, I go to art museums frequently and this is not a priority. If you live in Singapore it is free on Friday evenings. If visiting, there are better things to see. Go down by UOB and see the Dali and Bolero statues."
,,Well worth visiting,5.0,,"The current collection, The weight of history, is fantastic. From the first piece, to the last, talented artists have interpreted the passage of time and the concept of renewal to create inspired works. My caveat is to join a free tour guide if the group is mostly adults. I started with a group that was mostly children 6 to 15, so left to enjoy the art solo. Museum guides are well-informed and strike up conversations with all guests. A great experience!"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"I have visited SAM on a number of occasions. It is often worth looking in as the exhibitions change and there are usually a variety of things on. So whilst I am usually bored by much of the contemporary art, especially video installations, there are usually other things on. The building itself is lovely and its near a lot of other attractions."
,,"good, can grow in the future",3.0,,"This Museum tries to show the Asian modern Art, located in an old school and with an extension just on the other side of the road (Q8).

If you expect a retrospective don't come, if you expect some new work of (un)known Asian Artists please do.

The Museum shows both its collection and exhibitions. This combination differs and so it's hard to tell whether when to come, check in local magazines or take on of the leaflets spread around town.
Singapore tries to get itself on the Art map and that deserves some credibility, not al major cities in the world do the same effort. But one has to admit that the collection isn’t really overwhelming or dares to choose the unbeaten track. It gives rather a lot of room on local artists, some of them ready to conquer the world others to remain Singaporean heroes.
This museum is a perfect intro in some of Asian contemporary art scene.
It’s a tranquil place for now, so I really do hope that Singapore invests in the artists and the collection to let this museum become a must see.
Q8, a small building just beside tries to show the newer guys in town and as with all actual art, the selection will be made in a decade or so. Therefore you can actually see the stars of tomorrow or the ones who will be forgotten by then.
If you’re an art fan, got time to spend, just go and enjoy the choice of the actual exhibition. (f.i. I had the chance to see some great work of Jumaldi Alfi and Boo Junfeng

(The Museum has a rather simple shop, not really worth to pop in.)"
,,Expected more,3.0,,Wonderful location with very reasonable price. The attarctions with in the museum are various and covering many types. I expected tosee more. I thing the place was relatively empty.
,,Don't miss SAM,4.0,,"The Singapore Art Museum is one of the best art museums or galleries you could go to. The place reflects the modern open minded culture of Singapore & the soul of the country with its art collection. The collections are ambitious, bold, & all young at heart- just like the majority of the population of Singapore- pushing the boundaries with every new collection you would come across.

You have contemporary stuff, stunning paintings, abstract art pieces,.. this place is contemplative & fun. There is a lot of detail in the collections here.

This place is a good visit when coupled with some good exhibitions or lectures.

Well there are two buildings of SAM, the main one is on Bras Basah road & the other on Queen's street- just a couple of mins apart. Don't miss either of them.

Also, the support staff are in good numbers at the museum & were surprisingly cordial to add to the art rush. I have recommended this place to my friends on a holiday to Singapore."
,,Depends on exhibits,3.0,,Don't know whether I just had unrealistic expectations but it's small and they have changing collections. So my advice is to check and make sure you like the current one before visiting. On the positives the building is beautiful and there is a good japanese restaurant opposite called the Standing Sushi Bar
,,Great Intro to Singapore Art Scene,4.0,,"Enjoy a complimentary one hour tour that offers some history linked to the new and emerging artists. Lots of really cool ideas represented via paintings, sculpture and installation. Tour guide was fun and engaged group in commenting and truly experiencing the exhibits. No pretention, just great art, Thank you!!"
,,Excellent museum! Must-see for contemporary art lovers,5.0,,"Go Monday to Friday from 12 to 2, or on Friday after 6, and you can get in free. The exhibits were excellent - we loved the ""Weight of History"" exhibition most, but everything was very high quality, interesting and thought-provoking. Beautiful building, as well."
,,Good for a rainy day,3.0,,I would suggest this museum on a rainy day. It is very large however there are very few pieces in each room. This is primarily a Modern Art Museum so go in expecting strange but interesting exhibits. The museum can easily take around 3-4 hours if you include the second building down the street. Not bad but not a must see.
,,Art for all tastes.,5.0,,"We always make a point of visiting the Singapore Art Museum every time we are in Singapore. There's the main one in Bras Basah Rd, and the contemporary, modern one just around the corner in Queen St. One moderate entrance fee covers entry to both. The displays are well curated, change regularly and give you an insight into Asian art that you don't often get in western galleries. There is a vibrant and dynamic feel to these galleries and the staff are friendly and helpful. Singapore seems proud of its art scene - justifiably so, in my opinion!"
,,"Nice, but...",3.0,,"This is a nice little museum, but lacks all depth of information. I've been several times mostly because there is nothing much left to go to. Last time we went during the Deepavali festival (Indian festival of lights) and there were activities for children to do; however, the reason for them was never explained. The children came out as ignorant of Deepavali as when they went in. I'd think a visit to the museum would be educational and fruitful."
,,Great small museum,5.0,,Located in city center the building itself is a little gem already. Nice retreat from busy Singapore. This is my second visit and each time I found the exhibitions very interesting and inspiring though I must confess they are not that big. But I loved the view from the glass bay and stayed there for a while looking at hectic Singapore.
,,Asian Art / Great Shopping Break,3.0,,"To those who have visited the more famous museums in cities like NYC, LA, London or Paris, Singapore Art Museum (SAM) pales in comparison. However, what makes SAM unique is it's wide collection of Asian art, featuring a mix Chinese, Singaporean, Japanese, Korean, Thai, and Filipino artists. Not necessarily the number first place I'd recommend in Singapore, but spending the afternoon here was a good break from all the shopping we did on our trip. Exhibits rotate regularly, and include both installations, paintings, and during our visit an audiovisual exhibit. See http://www.singaporeartmuseum.sg/ for more information. Admission is $10 adults, $5 for students/senior citizens."
,,Large building - small contents,3.0,,We experienced our regular situation - between shows. What was available was disappointing. If you are used to London Galleries this will not hack it.
,,Art Meseum,3.0,,"not vert interesting just a good place for photography, maybe coz i went with the kids. the universites, schools and churchs around are a nice place to visit. my kids were quite excited to vivist the schools and comparing the difference with their oqn school."
,,just so so,3.0,,The most attractive thing is its appearance design. But the exhibition inside is just so so compared with its price. Outside the museum is a good place to take a rest and relax.
,,Must go for art lovers,5.0,,"If you only have time for one museum, go to the Singapore Art Museum. Its pieces are often intriguing and you may need up to 3 hours to fully appreciate all that SAM has to offer. Entrance fees are S$10 per person which is reasonable considering the well-curated pieces on display."
,,Night Light Festival,5.0,,We visited the SAM Singapore art museum during the recent night light festival in Singapore. Thus the visual audio art was only showcase about 5 mins but we enjoy them very much. That's the free admission in the evening.
,,"Not bad, but not good either.",3.0,,"This art museum can't hold a candle to other art museums/galleries around the world.

Like Singapore itself, many areas in the museum are often closed off and constantly being rebuilt.

Small enough to go through in an hour or two, it's good enough as a quick side trip from the National Museum of Singapore (it's close by) though."
,,New experience in the museum,4.0,,"when my friends and I went there last March, we were surprised to see that a museum can be this interesting. Singapore Art Museum has so many things in it that very nice to see. the place is also quiet and comfy. we didn't even realize that we're spending 2 hours there just to observe all the art items.

the people who work there was really nice, they even help us to take picture and suggest us to see another interesting art work there. we can take picture of the artwork just don't use the flash so it won't disturb others and keep the art work from damage (especially painting).

to get there just use MRT Circle Line then alight at Bras Basah MRT and took exit D or E and all you have to do is cross the street to the SAM (Singapore Art Museum). and it's free admission.
if you ever go to Singapore you have to try to go to this museum, especially for those who doesn't have interesting museum back home."
,,Good art museum,4.0,,A good art museum that is always updated with new exhibitions. Mainly Asian artists focus. Do check online for their latest exhibitions.
,,Quirky Local Exhibitis,4.0,,There are usually a bunch of quirky local exhibits. Which is pretty awesome and payment to the Singapore Arts Museum will give you entry to 8Q SAM as well. so that helps compensate the fact that the museum is rather small.
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"I find it hard to review museums because their exhibits are not always permanent so reviews will depends on the exhibit at the time.

The building and setting of this museum is fantastic. A colonial building and former school with various room and courtyards to set the backdrop of the art work.

A mixed feeling on the exhibits at the time. I enjoyed the learning galleries (2nd floor) as this was a little more my type of art although the remaining galleries were also interesting to see.

Not a museum that bored me, staff ate friendly and recomend a visit if not for the art to experience the building."
,,Amazing,4.0,,Its a different feeling all mixed emotion when you completely have the perspective of the artist of seeker of hope as the title. Its as if you put yourself in all the arts at the place itself and judging yourself. A must see!
,,Love this museum!,5.0,,"At the time we visited, a Korean artist who painted giant paintings of faces of people, and they were absolutely riveting.... I loved that Asian artists are highlighted here and so very fascinating. They had installations from a recent art competition from all over Asia, and I saw some work even from the Philippines. I'd definitely come here again ... well done!"
,,"If you like contemporary Asian art, you'll love this place",5.0,,It is definitely worth a visit. The building itself is lovely and the galleries are thoughtfully curated. Stop by!
,,Art that will keep you guessing.,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit whenever you stop in Singapore, SAM is a credit to Singapore. A beautiful building in itself, the gallery has several different sub galleries which host different exhibitions. Our visit had a diverse range of exhibits of a variety of media and medium - at every turn you were going ""oh boy"" and taking a look at yet another creative work of art produced by some new and not so new Asian artists. Film, video, sculpture, mixed media - you name it SAM hosts it. There is a great cafe as well as a small museum shop. We were also lucky to strike it on a day when WALTER the giant blow up rabbit that is doing the rounds was there (google his story to find out more about him). I know we will make Singapore Art Museum a definite stop on future stays in the city."
,,Top museum!,5.0,,"Really great museum in a beautiful building.
Staff is great, especially with kids.
8Q SAM (in another building) was a blast for the kids. interactive stuff, drawing, art experiences... I wish we had that kind of well-thought museums in Paris!
This is not a museum for art geeks. you won't find a lot of work here. But the ones selected and exposed are top. And it changes regularly."
,,Singapore's MOMA,4.0,,"The Singapore Art Museum resides in a former convent building and a second building across the street, which houses the childrens' exhibits.

The main musuem features primarily modern, 20th and 21st century Singaporean and Chinese art in mixed media, including video.

The children's exhibit includes a video theater with an extensive list of short videos, many focusing on contemporary social commentary.

The collections are eclectic and eye-opening - this is a great little museum to visit. Admission fees are paltry. There's also an on-site Italian restaurant and Spanish tapas house for those who don't care to wander far to dine."
,,8Q is not a museum,2.0,,"You would expect an extension of the wonderful Singapore Art Museum to be just as good. Unfortunately, 8Q is a very poor cousin showing amateurish art pieces in rather barely fitted classrooms of an old school."
,,Pretty place,5.0,,"It is a pretty place, the architecture is a colonial style building. Airy with enough walk space."
,,"Contemporary Art, mind you",5.0,,"The museum consists of two compounds, and they house an impressive collection of contemporary arts. The first used to be a church, so there are remnants of classic touch here and there, but the 8Q is new. Might be a surreal experience, especially if there's a thematic exhibition."
,,interesting,4.0,,"Relatively small museum, but interesting exhibition when I was there (31st May 2012).
Not easy to discover all the rooms, as they are a bit scattered around, but the staff is helpful in making sure you have seen everything.
There is also a 2nd building in Queen street, where there was also a nice exhibition.
Worth the 10 SG$ (free admission on Fridays)."
,,SAM,1.0,,"As an artist I found the Singapore Art Museum a total waste of time and money. There is absolutely nothing worth viewing in the whole place. The nicest thing about it is the building itself which is colonial and beautiful. As for the art, it is non existent. There is better things to visit in Singapore. It is a disgrace that one has to pay to enter and all they have is a lot of absolute rubbish."
,,Small But Interesting Art Collection,5.0,,"Housed in an old colonial building, the Singapore Art Museum at once has both an advantage and a disadvantage. The advantage is the beautiful architecture, which fits into the theme of Art, fittingly adding its ambience to the arts home of Singapore. The disadvantage is the Singapore Art Museum is only able to house a limited collection of art work at any one time.

The solution? The Singapore Art Museum rotates the collections and exhibitions on display every few months, thus ensuring that repeat visitors always have something to look forward to.

The Singapore Art Museum features works from both Singaporean and South-East Asian artists. These range from traditional art work, such as paintings, sculptures, drawings, or crafts, to modern art work using computer-generated imagery (CGI), lasers, photography, lighting arrangements or empty space.

I particulary liked the current exhibition from artist Lee Wen, titled ""Lucid Dreams in the Reverie of the Real"". Lee Wen is among Singapore's most internationally recognised artist, and his ""Yellow Man"" series of art work is both intriguing and thought-provoking.

I also like Justin Lee's video ""Eat Fast Food Fast"", where he blends fast food and drinks it... It's both hilarious and disgusting at the same time.

If you're planning a visit, do note that the admission fee costs $10, and allocate about 1 to 3 hours for viewing."
,,"If you're into art, its worth a visit",4.0,,SAM like the other Singapore museums is worth a visit once every couple of months to catch new exhibitions. And like the other museums it is well organized and always worth dropping into if you're fond of art.
,,wonderful building woeful collection,1.0,,"Big contemporary art lovers we never miss an opportunity to visit modern art museums the world over, maybe we are spoilt but this ,ust be the worst I have ever been to. The quality of the exhibits is woefully poor, uninspiring and lacklustre

Nice building, that's about all I can say"
,,Artistic potraits,3.0,,Most of the rooms were not open. The guide was very helpful in explaining each art & some history
,,Yikes - did we take the wrong turn and end up in the Children's Museum?,2.0,,"Too many children running wild (and I mean wild - yelling, running, touching everything). It felt like a children's museum - which would be fine, IF it were a children's museum and not the Singapore Art Museum"
,,Fantastic collection of contemporary South East Asian Art,5.0,,The Singapore Art Museum is one of the best contemporary collections of South East Asian art in the region. Its regular exhibit contains examples from all of the regions most famous artists. Changing exhibits cover many of the countries in depth.
,,"Small, but excellent. Certainly one of the best collections of contemporary art.",5.0,,"We have visited the SAM while there where the exhibitions ""Chimera"" and ""Innovation In Art Series"". We visit modern art museums worldwide. This museum can keep up with the MOMA or the Guggenheim Bilbao. It is much samller, but the art shown is carefully selected to represent asian contemporary art. I would not be surprised to find some of the artists' pieces in this years DOCUMENTA in Kassel, Germany.
On of our group is staying longer in Singapore, and he will return to this museum to see it again, becuase he loved it so much.

It is worth to go to both the buildings of the SAM. Just follow the signs on the floor when sou step out of the main building. Enjoy!"
,,Lovely building - contemporary art content,3.0,,"Lovely modernised building - warm, but quite small (?). Some displays of art are strange - but I am not an expert. Descriptions and layout really good. Laser 'chapel' piece quite different. Seniors get small discount"
,,"Bit of a maze, but a well-thought out and peaceful art experience",5.0,,"Unless you hate modern art, you should enjoy this place. My top tip if you do hate modern art (here or anywhere else) is to not read the descriptions of the pieces. These will only send you into a fury.

Personally, I like modern art, but not the pretentious descriptions. I like it when something is pleasing to the eye, thought-provoking, or clearly difficult to have produced. Ideally, all three. I also like science and art crossing over. There was a good lasers-shining-on-mirror piece when I went and you could essentially walk right through the art, without destroying it. Nice.

The building is an interesting piece of architecture too, which doesn't hurt.

Definitely worth a couple of hours here."
,,Great on Friday night,4.0,,"The Singapore Art Museum opens late on a Friday (until 9pm) and, as I'm a skinflint and a sucker for a cheap deal, the fact that there's free entry on a Friday just makes things better.

It's a short walk from City Hall MRT and the building is lovely - one nice thing about Singapore is that there's no apparent mania to destroy every last old building, but to respect and repurpose them. However, because of its age it's not perhaps the ideal venue for displaying art: there aren't any of the really cavernous galleries you'd see at somewhere like MoMA in New York or even the Museum of Modern Art in Taiwan. That means you don't get to see some of the really gargantuan pieces that feature in other art galleries.

There still good stuff: we arrived to see the penultimate day of an Asian art contest, with some very fine (but mostly very depressing) artworks. You could easily spend most of a day here; we only saw one exhibition and that took us a couple of hours, and there were at least two other exhibitions running concurrently.

There's also a fun shop, although quite a lot of the merchandise is just amusing 'arty' stuff, rather than related directly to the museum."
,,Go during National Day,4.0,,"8 August is National Day in Singapore, much like 4 July in US. Many special concerts, exhibitions, etc."
,,Great edgy art in a conventional city,5.0,,"A frequently changing exhibit list gives this gallery and edge. The art is often risky, edgy and unconventional in a city where rules are not often broken."
,,Stimulating modern art,4.0,,We were lucky to be in Singapore on a Friday and this Art Gallery was free in the evening (from around 6-9pm). We pottered around for a while and then took a free tour at 7pm with a volunteer guide which was very interesting. There were some fascinating pieces by up and coming artists and more established ones. My only criticism was the air conditioning was freezing - what a waste of resources!
,,Always filled with interesting art,4.0,,This is my second time to visit SAM but it felt like a whole new place. The layout of the place is just a little confusing so do breeze through the map which will be given to you upon entrance.
,,Once a church,3.0,,"Facing the Singapore Management University, it is now a good study ground for the nearby undergrads. Art exhibitions are non stop but the exterior of this early 1900s cathedral seems more picture-worthy than the interior."
,,Second best place in Singapore to view Wu Guan Zhong,4.0,,Wander to the neighbouring art galleries to see more.
,,Old Schoolhouse given a new lease of life - artfully,4.0,,"I'm not an art buff and many of the exhibits in the museum leave me cold but I must say that I love the architecture of this former schoolhouse - previously the Saint Joseph's Institution. The restoration work was done very well and the use of space is superb. Of course, for art lovers, the art exhibits within would be a much added bonus."
,,An Un-Singaporean Disappointment,1.0,,"I cannot understand why, when it comes to museums, Singapore is such a failure. The zoo is great. The bird park is great. But the Art Museum is a disaster because there is no art! Why such a rich country has such an impoverished museum is beyond me."
,,Amazing Contemporary Art in a Beautiful Setting,4.0,,"The Singapore Art Museum was a nice change from the more culturally specific institutions such as the National Museum, Peranaken Museum, and Asian Civilizations Museum -- all superb destinations -- that are part of the typical tourist itinerary in Singapore. The museum is housed in a sprawling colonial-style building with cozily handsome galleries, as well as in an annex building a short walk away. When I visited, the two major shows up included pieces from notable private collections and work by rising talents in Singapore's art scene. It's really great just to walk around the beautiful spaces and on-site cafe, and the museum is centrally located. It is also not so huge that you can't manage a satisfying visit within a few hours."
,,"Sadly, very disappointing...",2.0,,"The day i went there were only a few exhibitions, very poor information re the artwork and a very confusing lay out."
,,more modern than you might expect,3.0,,"I am a member of this museum and enjoy art, however you should check the current exhibits online before entering with small children. The modern art can be the shocking edgy post war art that many people naturally shy away from. ""Mommy, why is the man with the nuece wearing a squirrel head coat?"" Why is the gun in his mouth? Why Why Why ? I have also been there when they had a crazy fun train set for kids to play with for hours of fun. You just have to check."
,,Best museum in Singapore,5.0,,"Easy to get to by MRT and close to other museums and attractions. Lovely old building and exhibits which change regularly - I went back twice. Free 15 minute internet terminals are tucked away in all Singapore museums, so ask the staff for directions."
,,Asian artists,4.0,,"I have seen paintings about western celebrities - van Gogh, Andy Warhol, Marylin Monroe, etc. - by a korean painter. Don't remember his name. Very well (selected and) presented."
,,Nice little art museum with interesting exhibitions,4.0,,"Every year we come, we always find some interesting exhibition in this little museum. This year the oil paintings and sculptures of the Korean artist Kang was quite interesting."
,,"No Van Gogh, but you will walk away pleased",4.0,,"I'll talk mainly about two exhibitions that are ending their run real soon. By the way, there is free admission on Fridays from 6 pm to 9 pm!

1) Hyung Koo Kang: The Burning Gaze (14 October to 25 December 2011)
This Korean artist is well known for his portraits with intense gazes, both of himself and well-known personalities. This exhibition spans two levels and includes caricatures and sculptures as well.

I think it will be interesting to watch the 17 minute video, which introduces Hyung's art. It portrays him as a very intense artist, one who is willing to pursue his dreams and has a slight eccentricity which actually makes him very endearing.

2) Amanda Heng: Speak to me, Walk with me (7 October to 1 January 2011)
This exhibition is not in the same building as the above, but is a stone's throw away at 8Q. I think the works here are provocative and bring across a very strong message.

One of the installations titled Missing, is one of Heng's earliest installations that deal with gender issues. This commemorates nameless female babies who are victims of infanticide in cultures where males are preferred.

My favourite part of the exhibition is how Heng talks about the role of women in modern day society, tying it up with ideas of disappearing landscapes in Singapore, such as Bukit Brown Cemetery and the Tanjong Pagar Railway.

There's so much more I could say about the exhibitions. But due to time constraints, just troop down to the museum, have yourself burnt by the intense gaze of a Korean artist or be provoked by unconventional art themes!"
,,Nice break from shopping,4.0,,"Looking for a break from shopping? About a block and a half from Raffles City is the Singapore Art Museum. This is my second visit to the museum and neither time did I notice a permanent exhibit. That means, the museum might not have a collection of its own or that it prefers to exhibit special works. This time, there was an exhibition of an interesting Korean artist whose life story caught my attention. He didn't start painting seriously until he was well into his thirties, and it took many more years to be discovered. But when that happened, his career took off. The other exhibit took over the majority of galleries in the building--a competition for outstanding art across all of east Asia. The works were amazing--had emotional appeal yet showed exceptional depth of thought and insight. The exhibits will probably differ when you visit but if these two are any indication, something engaging is in store."
,,Love SAM,5.0,,"I always love everything about art, and being at SAM was like being in heaven to me. Real big museum with stunning collections, and chapel in the middle of the museum, there was a choir show when i was there, and it was beautiful. I will def come back to SAM to see more of their collection."
,,Great place for everyone - our kids loved it. Manageable size.,5.0,,"Constantly changing exhibitions showcasing some of South East Asia's largest collection of Contemporary Art. The curators do a great job of trying to make it accessible and there is always something that kids find interesting or is specifically laid on for them - worth checking out their website to see what is on but always worth going as there is always something good there.

Free tours by an International and local group of docents who volunteer with the Friends of the Museum - every day at 11pm and 2pm which last for an hour. Every tour is different and makes the visit much more enjoyable. Just turn up at the main reception and ask at the desk - sometimes they can be a bit dappy at the desk and may say there isn't one or they have no idea - but worth hanging about to see if a docent turns up.

The little shop on site is great for interesting arty books/jewellry/cards and some toys - run by Banyan Tree. Good for upmarket gifts and souvenirs (not tat - go to the amazing Mustafa Centre or China Town for tat galore).

The museum is very small by international standards but housed in two interesting buildings that both used to be schools - the main building on Bras Basah has a fabulous history and don't miss the little Chapel with its original tiling and fabulous contemporary stained glass window. The museum is great precisely because it is so small there is not that horrible feeling of being tired of walking and seeing but not wanting to miss anything - you can see it all and it is just right (in my opinion!).

Looks like very good wheelchair access and lifts to all floors.

Personally am not a fan of the two attached restaurants (Italian and Dome) but I love the two next door to 8Q (the other building round the corner on 8 Queen street). Food for Thought - fab food, great brunch and wonderful staff. Good for kids. Also the Standing Sushi bar opposite is great - again nice staff and reasonably priced, and the food was good both times I went. Set lunch good value - my kids loved it. Endamame were not so great.

Area around is also full of old churches, beautiful buildings and all at the bottom of Orchard Rd - nice to walk about in the area if not too hot."
,,SAM SAM the artful man - with a Great Exhibition,5.0,,"There are two SAMs - big SAM and SAM 8Q. SAM is the main museum and 8 Q (Q stands for Queen street) a few blocks away – both are worth a visit but *Q is a bit more ummm “experimental “ !! at least in my eyes. Big SAM is the subject of this review
SAM (Singapore Art Museum), I visited by accident. Was going somewhere else but had wrong day (umm?) so was walking past SAM and chanced a walk in --- not been on my radar although been in Singers for 10 years. SAM was old school dating back to 18th century and is tastefully renovated. You can read a lot about the museum on their web site. - so I will not repeat here but the reason for this review is to recommend the current exhibition (until 25 Dec) there is an exhibition by Korean artist Hyung Koo Kang: “The Burning Gaze"" Go see - whatever your taste in art this guy is really, really good and some of his stuff should (will) blow your mind... no more detail here .. just go…. doubt you will regret. Go at quiet time - weekdays mid-morning or midafternoon and get one of their volunteer guides - the one I had was brilliant (a mine of information and enthusiastic) , and because the place is not usually crowded you can find yourself having a personal tour! ) Ask the guide to point out the original floor tiles and the old school hall... then see what renovation did to retain the 18th century fabric! Dome coffee shop next door is great and the souvenir shop in SAM is not tacky - some great presents….. enjoy"
,,Decent place,3.0,,"Singapore seemed to be dotted with museums. This on is for modern art. It is a decent enough museum, but entry charges can be steep. For someone, interested in modern art, I am sure this would be an important place to visit."
,,Excellent museum with lots of interactive activities for children,4.0,,THis is a great museum that offers a wide variety of exhibits. There were also several activitites for the children that kept them very busy! A nice break from the heat and also a good way to learn a little bit about Singaporean history.
,,Interesting display!,5.0,,"During my trip here, there are having film exhibition and we get to watch snippets of movies and independent films."
,,an unexpected attraction,4.0,,"Our hotel was very near and walking to the MRT station, we happened to see the Singapore Art Museum and decided to give it a try. We were delighted to view wonderful art works, specially the portrait works of Hyung Koo Kang. Something different to do in Singapore."
,,Fun for kids at the Art Garden event,4.0,,"The Singapore Art Museum holds special events/exhibitions throughout the year... do check out their website to see if anything strikes your fancy....
For me, I brought my son to their Art Garden (Contemporary art fun for children) this year and last year.... Both times, we enjoyed ourselves alot! This event is typically held between Jun-Aug.... If you happen to be in Singapore during this period and have young kids, you might want to consider bringing them there!
Admission is free every Fri night from 6-9pm... Otherwise, it is $10 per adult (free for children aged 6 years and below)"
,,An interesting place to visit,4.0,,"The Singapore Art Museum (SAM) is certainly a very interesting place to visit. The building is a former school (St Joseph Institution) and certainly the experience will be a very educational experience for you and your family. Apart of its ""resident"" collection, the SAM is currently having a fascinating exhibition titled ""Video : An Art. A History. 1965-2010"". You'll see really weird interpretations of the video and television as art. Won't spoil the fun for you by saying too much. Also, for the kids, there is an exhbition-and-play area for them on the first level. You are allowed to re-do and re-arrange the display items. So who said museums are boring places?"
,,Fun on a Friday night!,4.0,,"If any of you happen to be in town on a Friday evening, do consider dropping by the Singapore Art Museum (6-9pm) just as I did last Friday - for free. There is free admission every Friday evening. I happen to chance upon some colourful paintings of children's clothes and two beautiful elephant sculptures. I walked in at nearly 8.30pm and only had half an hour to roam around on level 1. I wished I walked in earlier so that I had more time to admire the many pieces of beautiful art. However, because of the free admission, do expect to see young families there but the museum is large enough for one to find pockets of space and silence too. Altogether an enjoyable experience for museum lovers."
,,Not the greatest art museum but don;t miss the angelic wings downstairs,3.0,,"These enormous translucent wings are worth the price of admission (which is free between noon and two during the week!) Made of plastic flip flops, it's absolutely beautiful.,

Too much of the art is disturbing, with violent images and pounding away at messages, sort of old school in your face post modern art. I'd far rather see actual Singaporean art, folk art, native art, etc.

The Singapore History Museum and the Penarkian Museum are a far better bet if you have limited time."
,,very good contemporary art,5.0,,Excellent contemporary art- good value unlike the art science museum
,,pleasantly surprised,4.0,,"This is not the Louvre, but there were times when I said ""wow.""

Singapore is a small country, and at this museum they showcase Singapore/Asian artists. Personally, I thought some were flops (a little too forced), but others blew me away. This museum is like a maze -- if you're underwhelmed, keep going and you'll find a completely different genre that just might blow your mind.

I've grow up with European art and so it's easy for me to be amazed to see the a real Van Gogh or Monet. I don't recognize any of the artists at this museum, but then it's not about the name anymore, it's about the art and whether it leaves an impression on you. And enough pieces did -- I saw art that was unfamiliar yet still very inspiring..

Follow signs, pull open doors. I think it's a great way to spend a couple of hours if you're tired of the shopping malls.

It's free Friday nights 6-9 pm, otherwise admission is $10 Singaporean dollars."
,,Surprises Await at the Art Museum,5.0,,"My husband and I were not planning on the visiting the art museum, but after wondering through the gift shop (which had relatively inexpensive gifts, believe it or not) we learned that it was free from noon to one on weekdays.

Knowing what I know now, I would've paid. The building itself is bright and fun to navigate. The temporary installation of Korean art was also interesting and unique.

Highly recommend this air-conditioned alternative to a typical walking tour."
,,Beautiful art gallery,4.0,,"I went to the Singapore Art Museum in 2005 when the big ""Botero In Singapore"" exhibition was on. It was a truly impressive collection of Botero's works in one place (with sculptures scattered all over the city). The gallery itself is relatively small but very beautiful and features many fascinating exhibitions by prolific artists. The permanent collection mainly features modern Southeast Asian art and is well worth a visit.

The museum has a well-stocked shop with many interesting items and a lovely cafe."
