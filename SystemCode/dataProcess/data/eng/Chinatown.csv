,,Bustling and colourful,4.0,,It was great to arrive in Chinatown and find a great place for noodles and help to find a $S 3 Tiger beer to quench my prodigious thirst. It is a thriving place to pick up some souvenirs also.
,,"Fun, fun, fun!",5.0,,"So much to see, hear and observe! Watch your step as you might step on some food. Food is everywhere you look. Cultural Heritage Center is a must, otherwise just sit somewhere with a drink and observe!"
,,"Seen one Chinatown, seen 'em all",4.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is reasonably typical of other Chinatowns I have visited. There's a variety of market stalls, food streets, etc and plenty to keep you busy for a couple of hours."
,,Worth having a look at Chinatown!!,5.0,,"While in Singapore we went on a tour in Chinatown looking at all the shops and food places, well worth having a look and make sure to ask some of the locals for the best food places."
,,china town Singapore,4.0,,"Lots of shops, restaurants, places to stay...your typical Chinatown....but much cleaner than most. Came here to grab lunch and to just look about. Always a fun spot!!!!"
,,ChiTown,4.0,,"Street hawker, pawn shop, chinese chess, etc. Enjoy every moments strolling around eating local foods."
,,Cheap souvenir,4.0,,If you want cheap souvenirs .just come to this place. ( MRT NE4/DT19) Theare are traditional food and good place for shopping.
,,I didnt buy anything,5.0,,I didnt buy anything from this place but there is a shopping mall on the other side of the road where they have Daiso (a Japanese dollar store). Google it cause its awesome
,,Cheap place to shop and eat,5.0,,"There's a money changer that offers a good price. Always with long line but worth it.
You can find almost anything here with a cheaper price. From medicine, snacks, souvenirs etc. A lot of good foods with reasonable price. Even Singaporean shops and eats here. A must visit place."
,,Weekend Outing,5.0,,"Great place. Crowded. But very cultures oriented. Good for family outing as well. Lot of eatery to try on,"
,,Great bargains,4.0,,"If you are after handbags, silk dressing gowns, Knick knacks and a bargain then this is a great place to visit. Friendly people working in the stalls. Got some great bargains. Ate at a lovely restaurant for lunch and was quite cheap and yummy and air conditioner was great. MRT station right in the middle of china town. It’s clean, but not to the normal standards of Singapore. However bring water it gets very hot walking around."
,,Great for photos!,5.0,,Really nice shops to get some food and really good for walking around and taking photos. Great hawker centres with cheap food too. I’d recommend also walking towards the Rochor/Duxton area as they’re all around the same area!
,,A must see area,5.0,,"Chinatown has become a little more comfortable in the last five years - the street stalls in Smith Street with its outdoor cafes now have semi-permanent seating areas and more well established hawker stalls but it is still a fascinating place (among many in Singapore) to visit. The shops, eating places and temples are addictive. There is smoke much activity and and interesting things to see and taste you could easily spend a day. Definitely allow a full half day at least."
,,Great authentic Asian cusines.,4.0,,"Even thought the name ""China Town"" supposed to be Chinese, but I also saw some other Asian cuisines around the area.
We ate at the hawker center which is located in the heart of China Town. The food at hawker centers are much cheaper than restaurants and you don't have to pay ""food & services tax"". That's what we like."
,,Great for people watching.,4.0,,"This is a very good activity to shop, eat and get your gifts. Food not as cheap as you can find in other areas of Singapore but still ok. Happy hour beers $8.00 meals $12 -$16.00"
,,Nice to see part of local heritage,4.0,,Visited as part of a tour. Walked to and visited temples. Went to Buddha Tooth Relic museum which was interesting. Also walked by restaurants and town square. Good to visit to see part of Singapore culture.
,,"Great, cheap shopping and good food",4.0,,"My family and I really like the Singapore Chinatown. The shops on streets closed to traffic are always worth a look. We like eating at the restaurants or the Hawker stalls in the Chinatown complex (very traditional Singapore food) and Peoples Park (more Chinese to our thinking). The heritage tour is worthwhile if you have time, but you can also just wander through the streets and stop at temples - especially the Buddha Tooth Relic temple."
,,Very tourist friendly! and has a lot of malls and nice souvenirs.,5.0,,"This area is stunning with all the malls and shops. It is very easy to get to because of the MRT. There is a beautiful Buddhist temple, the heritage center, and the visitor center."
,,"Slighly boring, except food street",3.0,,"We visited several time, different times. Not so interesting for turists compared to other countries. Food street was good."
,,Worth to visit once,4.0,,I visited this area once. It looks like China and you can feel the Chinese atmosphere and culture. There are plenty of small shops with beautiful and attractive goods but the shopping center was awful. I think spending two hours is enough.
,,"Cheap souvenirs, irritating touts",1.0,,"The difference between Chinatown and Little India was quite enlightening. In Chinatown, the shopper tourist is never left alone. In Little India, one is free to roam without the irritating sales pitch of the everpresent tout."
,,Avoid the tourist food in Chinatown.,4.0,,"Hi folks. Well I’ve lived in Singapore on and off for 23 years, and I love Chinatown. However there are a couple of places to avoid, unless of course you are a typical tourist with big pockets.
One place to avoid for food is Smith Street, yes it’s nice and now totally under glass that spans over the shop houses on both sides, but it is a tourist trap for expensive food. Well maybe not expensive for you, but not that many locals eat there, the place thrives on tourists. So what to avoid, well for one it’s Chilli Crab, it’s meant to be a Singapore delicacy, but to be honest it’s just a crab covered in chilli sauce, very messy and very expensive. There is a Thai place in Smith Street and also a Vietnamese food place, neither very good or authentic, it’s tourist food, plain and simple.
The alternative is to go across the road to People’s Park and eat in the Hawker Centre. It is full of locals so that tells you something.
There are some nice little streets around Chinatown, go down Pagoda Street to the Chinese heritage centre, walk around inside one of the old shop houses to see how all the Chinese lived once they arrived in Singapore from their home country. One of my old Chinese friends was brought up in a room in a shop house, and he said it really was like that when he was a child, worth a trip.
Next to Sago Lane is the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum, worth a visit, very bright and ornate inside. Don’t worry if you are in shorts or a tee shirt ladies, they have clothes for you to cover up so you don’t offend anybody.

Across the road from there is Maxwell Food Court, lots of different foods to try and a very famous local Chicken Rice still, all at local prices, $5 will get you a good meal. $7.50 will get you a large bottle of beer.

Have a walk around the side streets, lots of little stalls selling gifts and bits, you can even get a suit or shirt made, but not the same day.

Hope you enjoy it, it is nice, just check the food prices before you order. Oh and don’t forget the restaurants costs are all plus plus, what you see add 10% service charge and then 7% GST.
It’s best to stick to the Hawker Centres and little coffee shops really."
,,"Culture, Good Food, Durians, Sightsee",5.0,,"Chinatown Singapore, things to do, sights to see, street and restaurant food, culture & heritage, jostling for space in a compact area. Smith Street (or Chinatown Food Street) as well as many street corners and up and down alleyways for food options. Durian stalls (king of fruits, some say), winebars, bak-kwa (Chinese salty-sweet dried meat, similar to jerky), dimsum/yumchar coffee shops or restaurants, Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, Sri Mariamman Hindu temple, many more sights & sounds. Too many to do; picked one or two each trip. I have gait/walking challenges (stroke), all sightseeing has to be well-researched and not overly taxing; I wear a legbrace. We used Chinatown MRT, close to everything, Lau Pasat foodcourt walkable; Maxwell Hawker Food Centre, Ann Siang Hill food street, and more. Souvenir hunting, exotic fruits; a must to visit."
,,chinatown,4.0,,shopping and eating. We ate some great seafood incl singapore chilli crabs. you can negotiate prices to some extent
,,weekend visit,3.0,,"Attended Chinatown on the weekend. From our experience would definitely avoid the weekends as it was wall to wall shoulder to shoulder people. It may be a personnel thing but this would not be on my priority list of things to do, Maybe a week day visit might have been the difference"
,,Cheap but quality food!,5.0,,"When in Singapore, Chinatown is worth a visit. It has a real vibe about it and the food variety is immense. Best of all you won't break the bank when eating there as Singapore is expensive."
,,A getaway from tourist but with tourist parts,4.0,,"The hawker centres here are overflowing with choice, usually not hard to find a table then be Daring and try something unusual. Eg ; Lor me. Yes u can do tourist to but the real enjoyment is mingling in genuine Singapore."
,,Chinatown - Worth a Visit,4.0,,Full of Eating and Shopping joints. Lots of cheap trinkets. An Hindu temple and Buddhist temple also close by. An aside + Found a Tintin store - a unexpected surprise! Singapore can be hot and most of Chinatown is walking without AC- best to plan going during cooler hours.
,,Don't miss this place!,5.0,,"The road is flooded with Chinese shops, especially restaurants. The scene here is also very romantic in autumn and winter."
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,Be prepared to walk around the mini streets and explore the stalls and food. You can people watch from many bars/cafes all day if you want but you should spend time exploring and finding hidden gems inside the shops. The Chinese Heritage Centre is a must see (allow 90min) for an interesting look into Singapore’s history.
,,The feeling was same as in China,5.0,,When I entered to chinatown I was feeling same as in China. Street food was good and delicious. I loved the whole experience in chinatown and would like to recommend to anyone who also love China.
,,Fun,5.0,,I loved walking around Chinatown. There are tons of shops and food. We bought some stuff for our kids and tried a lot of the food.
,,Worth a vist,5.0,,A myriad of brightly coloured streets with shops selling all sorts of things and so many restaurants. It is so load and vibrant definately worth a visit
,,Street food at its best,5.0,,"Loved China town. Great vibe and the street food is incredible. I am a fussy eater, but was not concerned eating here as you could see how clean everything was."
,,Love this Ethnic Quarter - Tour & Food!,5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is really a wonderful place that you can spend one whole day. We did a walking tour with this company called Monster Day Tours and got many insights about the background of the area, places of worships and local culture. We also tried some local food at the hawker centres (did one at Maxwell Food Centre and Chinatown Complex - both recommended by our tour guide) - definitely try the chicken rice and pork rib soup - they are a delight!

If we visit Singapore again, we will definitely come back here."
,,Wealth of Choice,5.0,,"Chinatown offers so much to the traveller. But for me the amazing choice of superb food will always be a major drawcard. Tons of choices for those little gifts as well. Safe, clean and colourful."
,,Interesting afternoon,4.0,,"We enjoyed wondering the streets of China Town, though there was nothing particularly different from any other China Town that I have visited."
,,A good place to explore.,4.0,,"There is so much to see and do here. You could really get lost for hours. We enjoyed it as it was different from Singapore city. The colours are vibrant, and there are lots of friendly people around."
,,Nice part of Singapore,4.0,,"Don t Miss Chinatown when you are in Singapore. Nice temples, busy streets. Don t miss the chinatown heritage museum."
,,Souvenirs and food!,5.0,,"Always a great place to visit and easily accessible by MRT. Notice that there is less opportunity to bargain than on previous visits. There are numerous eating places in the area and always innovative, interesting and surprisingly good quality souvenirs to buy at reasonable rates."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"China Town is an easy space to explore. Plenty of shops, food stalls and temples in a small space. Make sure to check out the Buddah tooth relic temple."
,,Awesome culture and heritage,4.0,,"Beautiful place but limited halal food choices - especially if you have shellfish allergies too because lots of fish dishes have shellfish in them. Nonetheless, a great day out and definitely buy your gifts here rather than the souvenir shops at the top attractions, which are far more expensive."
,,A short taxi ride from Orchard Road,4.0,,"An amazing variety of anything you can imagine from handmade chopsticks (check out Orchid Chopsticks on Pagoda Street for lovely handmade chopsticks, wood combs, and wood/boar bristle hairbrushes at reasonable prices) to floor length silk robes and jewelry. Taxi driver told me Tien Tien had best chicken and rice in town."
,,Murals along the way,5.0,,"Great place obviously.
If u intend to go here pls do not go on cny eve it will be busy peasy..
Other days are cool.
There is many murals along this place.
Instaworthy place to get all your shots.
Crowded always and it's one of the centre attraction place"
,,Like others,3.0,,Just another China town. Nothing really special or different from any other China towns across the world. It is very different from real China however.

,,Like most Chinatown areas... well worth a visit.,4.0,,Travel there in the afternoon or evening to get the best feel of this bustling area. Great bargains to be had. The food is wonderful and there are plenty of retail opportunities.
,,Fun place,5.0,,Good for shopping. Cheap touristy stuff. We also had a couple of massages here. Just need to read the signs if you want a true massage not sensual. Didn't really enjoy the meal we had here. Had to send back the spring rolls as the were still frozen in the middle. Also very hot and humid.
,,Food Heaven,4.0,,"Great place to shop and eat and relax with massage if that takes your fancy!! Plenty to do , so many choices for food and all very busy.Recommend spending a couple of hours here"

,,"Colours, smells and souvenirs",3.0,,"An eclectic area of shops selling everything, bars and restaurants, and religious sites. A definite melting pot and gathering area for the local Chinese community and tourists. Plenty of shops to find souvenirs of your trip to Singapore also a place to get custom made cloths in just 24 hours."
,,Shopping was a great experience,4.0,,"Shopping was great very cheep products Make sure you dont stop at first shop you see, the price of something you like may be cheaper further down the street. You will need a hat, good walking shoes and cash is easier than using card"
,,A different way to spend an hour or two,5.0,,"My wife who loves shopping had a great time here whilst I dutifully trudged on behind her.
She bought some fabric for a jacket and a number of small trinkets as gifts for her friends,
There are literally hundreds of small shops but most were identical or at least very similar
The highlight for me was lunch bought from a hawkers stand in the main eating street.
In summary a shoppers delight but I think more appreciated by the fairer sex"
,,Chaos,3.0,,"I had no idea in which direction to go whilst in China Town. It would be best to do an organised tour, so you see everything that there is to see. My time there was not very enjoyable."
,,Walk through Chinatown,5.0,,"Great for cheap buys. Lots of cheap eats. If you want to eat Tian Tian rice at maxwells food house, be prepared to queue for 20-25 minutes. Very popular with locals."

,,Great place to explore,4.0,,"I like the Chinatown in Singapore, as it is a place where you can explore. Not only will you find some nice food (check out Amoy Street Food Centre and Maxwell Hawker Centre), but places for you to buy your souvenirs (Chinatown Market) and snacks. There are plenty of temples to explore, too.

Don't forget to try out the bak Gwa from Lim Chee Gwan even if you can't take it home for gifts (meat is not allowed into certain countries). The signature pork bak kwa and crispy pork floss is yummy."
,,Food Galore,5.0,,A superb area for wonderful eating due to a mass of eating options. This popular area is well worth an evening visit.

,,China Town,5.0,,Not to miss the famous China Town. A place to visit at all costs. Nice bargains. Happy shopping guys.

,,Fun,4.0,,Worth a quick visit - major hustle and bustle with no respite from the heat. Fun knick knack shopping
,,Night Tour,4.0,,"We booked a tour with viator to Chinatown which included dinner and trishaw ride. Chinatown itself very colourful and vibrant with a great atmosphere. I wouldn't recommend the tour as it is quite easy to do on your own, you get to choose the restaurant and company."
,,Fun to Visit,3.0,,Very interesting. Lots of street food and shops within a 20 block area. I walked and felt very safe.
,,Streetfood paradise,5.0,,"If you keen on street food and asian food, should definitely visit the Pagoda street. Cheap and tasty snacks, noodles etc. So much to choose from. Highly recommended to visit, have a walk, lunch or dinner and also cheap souvenirs."
,,"I love Chinatown, Singapore.",5.0,,"We always stay in Chinatown when visiting Singapore. I love the vibe of the place. There are so many places to eat, for tourists and locals. Smith Street and Pagoda Street seem to cater for tourists, but join the locals at the Hawker Centres for a delicious meal. The markets are so much fun. The shopping is very reasonable and dont forget to enjoy a massage on the way."
,,Hive of activity,4.0,,"Just what you need some days - a cultural experience that shows the vibrancy of the place and the people. The nature of Chinatown with the architecture, the markets, the eateries and the people make it a must visit. Do it at meal time when things are happening"
,,Alright,3.0,,"The China town was very dirty, alot of bargaining in all shopping, mostly every thing is available here."
,,Nice way to spend an hour or two,4.0,,Stepped off the Hop-on-hop-off bus at Chinatown. There are several streets with lots of street food outlets and souvenir stalls.
,,Great place for a short visit,4.0,,I really enjoyed China Town. Lots of souvenirs and trinkets to buy & lots of nice food stalls. Just check the prices. Some seem expensive for tourists. Look where the locals and chinese are. The food is better & cheaper.
,,Absorbing and wonderfully curated,5.0,,This was a highlight of our 9 day stay in Singapore. We had stopped-over many times over the years But this time we took two of our granddaughters (who were on their first overseas trip) and they were blown away.
,,A good walking area,4.0,,"Lots of food and beverage areas, the usual souvenir stores found in any China town.. Some original shops, restaurant supply stores etc.."
,,good food,4.0,,the china chinese food are really awesome. Especially Mala Xiang Guo at Pearls Centre Hawker Centre. You get to see a lot of older aged people and it is another spectrum of lifestyle we can learn to be grateful to our current lifestyle.
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"This aax a big disappointment, nowhere near a impressive as say Chinatown in London. We did find a nice 'one pot' restaurant where we had an amazing meal and experience"
,,Chinatown,3.0,,"Cheap trinkets & many souvenir stalls consume most of this area now. Here you will find authentic hawker foods of all types.
While walking around you will spot some great shophouse architecture, also you will see many beautiful Wall Murals by Yip Yew Chong as well as other locations around Singapore.
The beautiful Buddha Tooth Relic Temple gives you an insight to the Chinese culture & history.
Old Chinatown no longer. This place is famous for the Bustling tourists.
Many narrow lanes in a compact area but easy to walk around, organized and clean like most of Singapore."
,,Interesting and strong in culture,4.0,,I found the whole experience very interesting. There were a lot of cheap stalls with souvenirs fit for and tourist/traveller. It was full of culture and had a strong vibe. It was very busy though. I recommend it to anyone passing by or with some spare time for wandering.
,,Tourist area,4.0,,"This is quite the tourist area in downtown Singapore. There are a number of tourist shops, as well as businesses. It is worth a stroll up and down some of the streets, but the items are fairly expensive. Parking is available on street, but is in high demand. Better to use a car park if one is available nearby."
,,China mate,5.0,,Great vibes and good food everywhere. It was very good to explore and a walk there and back from the cbd is perfect
,,Chinatown visit for lunch,4.0,,"We wanted to adventure into Chinatown to try the duck & pork. The taxi driver was great & told us where to go and eat & he was spot on. We were the only tourists eating there with the locals. The crispy pork was delicious! A fun little adventure after eating, walking through Chinatown. Very busy &
full of tourists & locals."
,,Nice but expensive food,4.0,,"It’s good to visit and get your cheap souvenirs. Most shops sell the same item just check the prices. Actually Chinatown marks are small, cross the road and visit the shopping malls. If you are eating there check the prices, if you eat where the tourists eat then you will pay big dollars, look to see which restaurant the locals are eating at. Tourists price for a meal is around SGD 15 or more a dish, we ate away from
The tourists area and paid SGD 5 for the same dish"
,,"A Place With Lots Of History, Good Food and Memories",5.0,,This is a place full of history and good food. Recently I noticed there are Murals at Temple Street and also the wall next to Smith Street Food Street. It's really beautiful! All the food there are so good. Alot of old food stalls are at the 2nd floor of Smith Street Hawker Centre. Really lots of good food at the hawker centre. Food are reasonably priced too!

,,Nice but the same as all china towns in Asia,3.0,,"Nice place to visit once, lot of little stalls with cheap souveniers, restaurants try to get you in but better you take some food outside at the central foodplaza, food inside is expensive for what you get and staff is everything except friendly and attentive."

,,In depth living,4.0,,We decided to stay in China town and loved the whole atmosphere. The markets the history and the ease to get around it. My only problem is that the smell of the Durian in the end turned my stomach so I couldn’t eat there. I gad to eat away from China town. It is a central location to lots of other places.
,,Great food,5.0,,"Plenty of cheap gifts, plus numerous places to eat. When it suddenlt rained jumped into the nearest bar only to have some of the best ""dumplings"" ever."
,,Crowded but manageable,4.0,,"The tourists flock to this location to savour the food and delicacies, to suck up the atmosphere and see the sights. Some even benefit from our business and are healed of ailments. Legs we lengthened by 1.5 cm and back pain was relieved."
,,Typical Chinatown area,3.0,,"This Chinatown is little bit what you can aspect. Rather crowded, many shops and a large food street. Have you visited “China towns” before you will probably feel that this is more organized and more hazzle free. Nice to spend some time here!"
,,History & Culture,4.0,,"Worth a visit, a fascinating peak into Chinese history and culture. The cleanest and most prettiest Chinatown we have ever been to.

,,A True China Town,4.0,,"Walking around China Town was a lovely outside activity. The buildings, architecture, restaurants, shops and atmosphere was great"
,,Worth a look but somewhat underwhelming,4.0,,"The score reflects the food offerings here, but the atmosphere can surely only be a glimpse of what this area was once like before Singapore was modernised and much of the old character destroyed."
,,The District of Chinese in Singapore,4.0,,"Since the cultural composition of Singapore mainly constitutes with Indian and Chinese cultures, I recommend you to visit the China Town in Singapore. It is located in the center without having a water front. If you go there by metro, you can directly access to the main street of China Town that hosts shops and restaurants. At the end of the main street there is an oldest Indian Temple called Mariamman Temple. You can visit there by taking your shoes off. The temple is especially in favour of the couples who wish to get marry."
,,Area of Interest,4.0,,"Visited Chinatown Food Street (Hawkers Pavilion area) for a quick & cheap meal. Most vendors display their food hygiene ratings A or B or just look to see who has the biggest line. Walking around the streets you will find stalls selling everything from clothes, souvenirs & fruit. Plenty of old buildings and temples to see."
,,Great selection of dining,5.0,,The hop on hop off bus took me on a night tour to Chinatown. Great way to see the attractions. Time to explore in the 40 min stopover and enjoy a Singapore feast from any one of the food outlets in the precinct. Quick service and delicious dining. Back on the bus for another experience. A revisit to take in all the other attractions with more time.
,,A must visit place!,5.0,,Chinatown was bursting with life and boinhomie when we visited recently. THere are so many good restaurants and sites ythat it is imperative to go!
,,Another China Town - Very good,4.0,,"Any Chinatown in any city I have been to is always worth a visit....if not for the food., the shear hustle and bustle of the way the workers there operate. This is no different, wiht street markets, stalls and oh so fabulous food...."
,,can't miss,5.0,,"the town has lots of shops and restaurant, especially if you like spicy food, plenty of choice, great place to buy souvenir"
,,Awesome shopping...,4.0,,"This place has been always famous with tourists for shopping. You can expect variety of small and big souvenirs to take back from here. Or buy stuff for own use. You can get the ethnic dresses here for kids. Variety of Singapore t-shirts. Do not forget to visit The Tintin Shop, if you are a Tintin fan. It's very near to the SMRT exit.
Also you can try authentic Chinese food here in the small outlets. They are real good. Awesome seafood available here.
The souvenir shops which are just at the starting charge a little more than the ones inside.
Do not forget your umbrella/ shades and bottle of water on a hot day."
,,Good food and souvenir bargains,5.0,,"Get there from Chinatown mrt station - rows of restaurants, food market, bustle and souvenirs shops."
,,"The usual, but always quaint.",4.0,,I love the bustle of these places and stopping for a beverage to watch the people in the A/C.A great Sunday afternoon on the Hop-On.
,,Great place to visit.,5.0,,"I visited this area with my family. It is a very colourful and vibrant area and really gives you a feel of how Singpore must have been before it modernised.

It mainly consists of market stalls where you can buy souvenirs (Generally cheaper than the Bugis markets) and lots of restaurants/cafes and bars. It is very clean and easy to walk around. It has its' own MRT station to so it is easy to get to.

Definitely worth visiting, especially in the evening as it has its'w own special atmosphere. Highly recommended."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"A super vibrant area, lovely to wander around!

We enjoyed popping into the temples, and stopping for some afternoon tea and cake. It’s also so easy to get to and from.

I would definitely recommend it for someone who has a few hours to kill, or someone looking for some fabulous kimonos or tea sets."
,,Cleaned up version,4.0,,"This Chinatown is a very polished version of its kind. Very clean and organized. You’ll find many Chinese mainlanders who have set up shops (food and retail) there. Great place to look for food, large variety."
,,Vibrant,4.0,,Its mainly a street market where you can purchase lots of souvenirs. Very vibrant and colorful place. Connected with MRT. Decent place.
,,PART OF HOP ON HOP OFF BUS TRIP,4.0,,"In some ways we were a little bit disappionted because we were expecting it to be alot bigger considering we were in the Far East . It was smaller than other China towns that we have been to. Having said that. We had a lovely meal there, by far the cheapest place to eat in Singapore that we could find in the 4 days that we were there. If you want souveniers to take back home with you again that is the place to go, far cheaper for the same thing. There was also lots of lanterns making arches all across the road when we visited where we got off the bus."
,,Large and busy,4.0,,"Lots of places to eat, drink and shop. Loads of cheap souvenirs and clothes. We had lunch in the hawkers pavilion area. Very cheap and fantastic foods. Lots and lots of food stalls upstairs."
,,Beautiful China Town,4.0,,"I've lived in China for 7 years and to be honest, only some parts of the city had the old architecture and culture.
So I was glad to visit the China Town where you can see the old architecture and culture.
Chinese artifacts, articles, etc are available here.
It's Indeed a pleasure to walk through the streets here.
You can find local Chinese food, hotpots, meats etc."

You can savour the different Chinese Cuisine by established Chefs. Some restaurants you can try are The Mouth, Crysta Jade Palace and of course not forgetting the Hawker Centre behind People's Park Complex.
There is some famous religious sites and temples there worth visiting.
Shopping in Chinatown Point and Pearl Centre is a definite must.
So, what you waiting for.... Go CHINESE..."
,,Lots of tourist shops,4.0,,"We used the MTR to go to Chinatown and you will see street after street of shops selling cheap items ..... but it's good fun.

You will see stalls selling durian fruit. It smells awful, in fact, you smell it long before you can see the stall.

You are not permitted to take this fruit on the MTR.

There is a street which has eateries the full length of the pedestrian area on both sides of the street ‐ the food is pretty much all the same and quite good value.

You must go to Chinatown in Singapore ..... its really good fun."
,,Cultural place.,4.0,,We visited Chinatown as we were staying nearby. There are many great restaurants and shops to choose from. Great chinese food available All freshly cooked and tasty and at a reasonable price. Huge menus.

,,Souvenirs galore!,5.0,,"In addition to the cultural immersion of temples and mosques, this is the best place to buy souvenirs in Singapore!"
,,Good Place to survey,3.0,,"Maybe I should say that all Chinatowns are very similar everywhere. I didn't eat-in here, but purchased the Singapore famous pork jerky. I bought the loose one from Lim Chee Guan to take back to my hotel room, and some prepacked one from Bee Cheng Hiang to take home to Australia. I like the first lot better as they are not as dry as the second one.
I had a chance to look into the Buddhist Temple. It is heavily influenced by Chinese mythology.
Chinatown as a whole is worth surveying, although many Chinese items are over priced when you compare them with eBay's or AliBaba's prices for the same items."
,,Interesting area,5.0,,"We visited chinatown and first impressions were that it was full of market stalls selling cheap tat. However, look further afield and you won't be disappointed. We visited a handful of temples quite close to one another, walked the back streets and saw some great architecture, visited the Heritage Centre and ate a delicious meal. Well worth a visit."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Were only here for an hour, but got a nice sample of local Chinese life. Like Little India, it's not a sanitized tourist destination; it's a living vibrant neighborhood. Buddha Tooth Museum is a good destination while here and there are a ton of shops and restaurants to choose from."
,,Reasonable market for gift items,4.0,,Very nice market for small gifts at very reasonable price....various options for food are also available in adjoining areas...very good connectivity through taxi and metro. One tip...when in Singapore you càn reach from anywhere to any other place by taxi in around 10 dollars .

,,Very interesting,4.0,,"Didn’t spend a lot of time here, but enjoyed our visit immensely. Lovely atmosphere, very colourful and authentic"

,,Nice ambience....,3.0,,Lots of small shops but I see it a bit of yoo touristic. Durian there is a must. And... One finds fast that prices are... Negotiable

,,good place for cheap souvenirs,4.0,,"Its clean compared to other chinatowns but its busy and watch out for vendors. Again they will be better than other locations in world but prices are cheaper than other locations for ""stuff"""

They even have my favorite ""weird asian desserts"" available! Clean relative to other China Towns I have visited!"
,,Street Art Markets and Temples,5.0,,"Chinatown was one of the highlights of our trip
to Singapore. Great food, amazing temples, stunning street art and the local markets all combine to make this little
slice of China a must see. Allow time to explore the streets and enjoy the atmosphere. The markets and shops are great for gifts for those back home. Will return here on our next trip
to Singapore."
,,Good place to visit,5.0,,"Clean place, good and variety food, nice decoration of the area. I visit the Maxwell food court to enjoy the Hainan chicken rice and the fish soup noodle, cannot be missed. Surely will go again when visit again. The food court maintains clean, And there is a shop like China Town history, it describes how the chinese people go and work in Singapore in the early days,"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Having visited many of the prestige shopping centres, we just wanted to enjoy some more casual and lower end merchandise options. Chinatown fulfilled this. There is an MRT right outside a main entry point. The market style stalls and shops occupy several streets, offering a variety of souvenirs and other goods at OK prices. We also had a rest and enjoyed a light meal and a welcome cold drink. We also paid a visit to one of the interesting Buddhist temples. Its worth a visit here…there is something for just about everyone and a different shopping experience."
,,No longer the Chinatown,1.0,,"The Singapore Chinatown no longer feels like the old Chinatown. It had really become more like a 'China' town....with all china Chinese selling and setting up foodstalls, it seems like I am in another town of china. Beside the temple is an attraction, the rest of it lost its meaning of historical attractions."
,,Best to get some historical perspective,4.0,,I visited Singapore Chinatown with a bike tour and the added historical perspective of how this particular chinatown was formed brought the place you life for me. For example to learn about the street of the dead.
,,A visit into Singapore history,5.0,,"We loved the atmosphere of Chinatown, that allows you to go back in time to the roots of this population that built Singapore. Don't miss the Chinese Heritage Center that tells you the story of these immigrants."
,,Vibrant and exciting,4.0,,"Beautiful decorated and buzzing with people this is a must visit.

There is a huge array of market stalls across a number of laneways as well as one dedicated to dinning.

One can’t help being mesmerized by the atmosphere and the festive feeling.

There’s plenty of parking around but I feel the best way to get there is by metro with a station right in the middle!"
,,"Great walk, great food",5.0,,A district not to missed when visiting Singapore. As well as many attractions the ambience and the food is always captivating.
,,A ‘must’ visit place in Singapore,5.0,,"Fascinating, iconic and historical. A Chinatown with unique Singapore flavour. Different from other Chinatowns around the world. Lots of local foods, shops, fruit stalls. Fascinating historical buildings and landmarks. The place is also very clean! Highly recommended."
,,Definitely worth the visit,4.0,,"I spent a whole morning wandering around Chinatown and was very impressed. Not only does Singapore's Chinatown have the typical old streets full of old shop houses with lots of Chinese restaurants, clothes shops and souvenir shops, but it also has the Chinatown Heritage Centre, a couple of Chinese temples, a Muslim mosque and more than one HIndu Temple.

There are two main Chinese Temples in the area, the first is the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple which has it's main entrance on South Bridge road. The other is the Thian Hock Keng Temple which is much older and for me more interesting and which is about 15 minutes walk from the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. Thian Hock Keng Temple can be found between Amoy Street and Telok Ayer Street.

Back in the main part of Chinatown are the Jamae Mosque and the Sri Mariamman Temple which can both be accessed from South Bridge Road.

Perhaps the most impressive place to visit in Chinatown is the Chinatown Heritage Centre which is a sort of museum showing how Singaporeans used to live in the early days. This museum is pretty large and for S$18 (adults price) you can enter and have a gadget that gives you a full multimedia guide.

One of the very famous places to shop in Chinatown is the People's Park Complex. I remember when I lived and worked in Singapore back in the early 1980's as an expat that this place was a favourite to shop for cheap imports from China. When I popped in briefly it still had the same sort of feeling."
,,So much option,4.0,,We did wish we came earlier as there was many shops looking for a mobile phone some stores staff didnt know there product. Samsung store were very on to it and wonderfully helpful in which I purchased a phone helped to setup everything. Building full of food stores didnt know what alot of the food was hard to read some signage. A very commercial space things not as cheap as you would expect from a place called chinatown. Still great experience looking around easy travel bottom floor.
,,Nice to see,3.0,,Compared with some other Cities like San Francisco this chinese spot is just a small copy. Food and shops on average level. The temple a must see.
,,Visted the Tooth Relic temple,4.0,,"Quite a spiritual visit to the Tooth relic temple at the heart of Chinatown. Learnt a lot about local Buddhist customs and traditions.

,,Great choice of food and souvenirs,4.0,,"There lots different dishes to choose from, as well as souvenirs (you can get multiple items for a relatively low price). The hawker style “alley” is a good place to eat - lots of seating and food stalls/restaurants to choose from.

The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Sri Mariamman Temple are worth a visit - please be respectful when visiting as they are places of worship."
,,China town for food a bit of razzle-dazzle,5.0,,"China town is bubbling over with athmosphere. Plenty to see and lots of street cafes and restaurants serving regular as well as authentic Chinese food .... if you want lively and athmospheric this is the place to head. Try ducks feet, maybe? Buy some souvenirs! Have fun!"
,,"Arresting sights, sound and vibes. Vibrant",5.0,,"Very busy place , great for people watching as well as for exploring the traditional Chinese food in Singapore. Though there is now even more Chinese cuisine from the various parts of China as well. A busy and extensive wet market too with offerings from the usual to the exotic like live frogs and even turtles. Worth a visit for the heritage, culture, cuisine or simply to soak in the activity and noise"

Try out the sugarcane drink, it's refreshing and sweet."
,,Favourite part of Singapore,5.0,,I adored walking through Chinatown and getting to know the locals here. So much to see and do and the food was amazing. The museum tour was also very touching and inspiring.
,,Chinatown,3.0,,"Chinatown is a great market for tourist. It was worth the visit , but we didn’t see any value in the items for sale. There are plenty of choices for food and most are reasonable."

,,China Town has lost its MOJO,3.0,,No cultural atmosphere just lost of shops selling cheep tourist junk. Restaurants were just the same standard kind you find in shopping malls. Not worth the taxi fare to get there.
,,chinatown shopping,4.0,,some great bargains to be had in chinatown and don't be afraid to do some haggling - to bag yourself even better bargains!! also a great restaurant/bar - BA DAO GUAN - on a corner of Trengganu Street at very reasonable prices.

,,Great foodie haven,5.0,,"While Chinatown's market area definitely caters to tourist crowds it's still a fun place to explore and soak up the atmosphere. We came to Chinatown for foodie adventures and were definitely not disappointed. The hawker centres are fabulous and although there are perpetual lines for the Bib Gourmand/Michelin-starred outlets (Hawker Chan, and Tian Tian in Maxwell Rd centre), there are still plenty of stalls offering up top-notch food. The temple is also definitely worth checking out!"

,,Place to shop,5.0,,"There are many souvenir shops here. Prices is lower than bugis. But price do not lie, the quality follows the price. For those who want to buy lots of souvenirs this is your heaven.

And I always buy bak kwa at Lim Che Guan never fails me"
,,An easy stroll through Chinatown,3.0,,The area of Chinatown is fairly compact and easily walkable. It's so interesting to stroll though the Singaporean area into Chinatown and the Indian area all close together. Although there are signs up about watching for pickpockets Singapore is much safer than other cities and crime rates are relatively low.
,,Great experience,4.0,,Great food that won’t break the bank. Shopping has heaps to choose from. If your looking for a tailor then you can’t go buy Jimmy at Abba’s Department Store.
,,Best Chinatown I've visited,5.0,,"Clean, vibrant and full of colour and history. More sedate in the morning, then comes alive at night. Don't be afraid to wonder into the back streets for a look in the evening, find the old guys playing checkers and other interesting sights."

At the same time in Chinatown there are many nice, old streets with a beautiful architecture, and they are clean and safe. We are normally make some stops in Downtown, Raffles Quay, or Telok Ayer Market and continue at last in direction Marina Bay Sands. :) This stroll makes our day every time staying in Singapore. Of course there are stops for a chinese brunch or lunch too - We love it! :)"
,,Love this place,5.0,,A must do when visiting Singapore. Browse all the shops stock up on souvenirs then cool down with a large tiger beer at any of the food outlets. Handy to get to on the train system SMRT or just a casual walk from Clarke Quay.
,,Love this place,4.0,,"I love China town as it is vibrant and has great cheap shopping, there is always something new to find and you can get cheap, good eats"
,,China in Singapore,4.0,,"Busy is the best way to describe Chinatown both in people and in the stalls that line the street. Be mindful that their are people trying to sell there products and in some cases the sell is quite hard, so don't feel bad about saying no. The food is fantastic, as expected, and the variety from restaurants to street stalls will ensure you could fill up with all that's on offer."
,,Culture kept alive,5.0,,Gives the feel of traditional Singapore. Many soviner shops. Do visit the traditional shops selling the keychains and the lanterns and feng shui items. Do visit the food court lane. Many options to binge on. Don't miss the Buddha temple and an Indian temple.
,,"Good if you know where to go, look up often",4.0,,"Hungry for good Chinese food? Then you've come to the right area. But look up to see the signboards overhead, so you know where you are headed. There are plenty of hidden gems such as the Smith St hawker centre (under USD5 meals) or classics like Yum Cha (on 2nd floor) that you won't find easily. Google is your friend and so is Tripadvisor.

Dress in comfy clothes and avoid peak hours such as weekday lunches (1200-1400) and festivals such as the prelude to Chinese New Year."
,,Beautiful and Safe at Night,5.0,,"I walked the streets of China town looking for a place to eat but also just taking in the colors by night and the different displays.

I loved the music wafting in the air and how safe and clean it is.

A stroll through China town even when you are not buying anything is a must while in Singapore"

,,One of the most authentic chinatowns,5.0,,"If you’ve been to many different Chinatown’s in the world, this one may be the one of the most authentic!

The atmosphere and shop environment makes it feel real compared to others in the States or other countries. Honesty feels more Chinese than parts of China. I think this is a must see destination as you can find cheap and abundant souvenirs if that’s what you’re looking for as well as a huge variety of restaurants."
,,Just love this place,5.0,,"Every time we visit Singapore we always go into Chinatown, it's a must! The purpose of our visit is to eat in our favourite restaurant, it's on a corner and has bright yellow plastic chairs and the food is AMAZING!!! So fresh, so flavoursome, so inexpensive, just love it here. A visit to Singapore wouldn't be the same without a visit here even if it's for a cold beer and some people watching! It's nothing fancy but fun!"
,,Walk about,5.0,,Dinner time is great time to walk about and see what's available to eat. Many food stalls and shops line this area and we are spoilt for choice on what is best to eat
,,Not busy,3.0,,Got off the big red bus to have a look around and stop somewhere for lunch. Not busy at all Friday lunchtime. Plenty of street shops and eateries but some of the stall holders are a bit persistent in asking you to browse their wares.
,,Quite nice,4.0,,"What to say about Singapore Chinatown? Speaking as an ABC tourist From NJ and living in San Gabriel Valley. I grew up on NYC Chinatown, and have sampled Philly, Flushing, Boston, LA, OC, DC, Taipei Chinese food.

Some of the famed Hainan Chicken (Tian Tian) Hawker stalls and other restaurants eg. (Liao Fan Hawker Chan, Outram Park stall on Hong Lin Complex) were overrated $5 dishes that you are better off buying chicken and rice at your local Asian supermarket because it will probably taste better. The dishes were quite small.

For good food sampling worth I enjoyed the People’s Park Complex across from the Chinatown MRT. the buildings appears bland but I think you get your money’s worth compared to Maxwell Center or Lau Pat Sa (apologies to Singaporeans). There are so many food stalls with variety here, worth the SGD. You can eat outside and cool off inside. They have the usual night market stalls nearby with the cheap souvenir trinkets / clothing, Chinese herbal medicines, and outdoor bars.

In short: stick to near the Chinatown MRT for food and shopping. People’s Park Complex is a must to satisfy your hunger!"
,,Walk around chinatown,5.0,,Love the hustle and bustle of china town and great bargains to be had in the market as well as an great choice of amazing food
,,Part of the Singapore expereince,3.0,,"We visited Singapore in April, and as our hotel at Clarke Quay was within a short walking distance to Chinatown we decided to explore that area. We took an evening walk there and were pleasantly surprised. We loved the atmosphere with the all the shops and eateries, and chose a small restaurant in Smith Street to have some dinner. The food was great and we enjoyed sitting in the air con while we ate. On our last night in Singapore we took another walk through Chinatown and felt that it was truly an integral part of visiting this amazing city."
,,Mixed Feelings,3.0,,We would have loved Chinatown as we do a lot of travel photography but the shopkeepers there are very cunning & persistent itreally put us off Chinatown this time.If we ever manage to go back to Singapore we would do Chinatown differently..Loved everything else
,,Mixed Feelings,4.0,,"We love visiting Singapore this was our 3rd visit, Chinatown Singapore is very unique place it's not clean like the rest of Singapore but is filled with so much culture and heritage the street food is amazing it's almost always decorated but this year we went during Chinese New Year so it was extra special. It does get crazy busy and if your exploring on foot with a stroller it can be very hard to navigate. This is definitely a must visit place though and our kids enjoyed the colours and the decorations and the Dragon Dance performances."

,,Remembering our old times,5.0,,Visited Chinatown on a weekday as it wld be very crowded during weekends. Went to the food centre above the market. As usual we had steam fish head at one of our favourite stall. Fish is very fresh as seller gets their supply fm the vendor at the market below.

,,Cheapest souvenir's shopping,5.0,,"Through the whole duration of my Singapore holiday I visited here everyday day or night. Every site I visited I would stop myself from buying anything at that particular place and gauge the price in Chinatown afterwards and sure enough, I always find it almost always 50-60% cheaper. With that being said, I know it's fake but I don't care...it's about me saving more pennies to do more sites.
Food is fantastic here, I have not had alcohol here but many tourists dine here. Never seen anyone rowdy or drunk, perhaps because the city is so beautiful that you wouldn't want to fog your mind but retain every detail and memory (IMO)"
,,China town in Singapore,4.0,,It's small compare to other countries but should visit at least once. Good food and chinese temple. Small shops for ladies fashion items.
,,A little bit of everything!,5.0,,"I was amazed at what the Chinatown in Singapore offers in a very small place - shopping, and Indian Temple and the Temple of the tooth relic!

Initially we were skeptical to go to Chinatown as many suggested to visit the one in Kuala Lumpur instead of this. In my opinion, both of very different and both are a must do!

Coming out of the Chinatown station in MRT, the main Pagoda street is filled with shops where you can buy souvenirs or gift articles along with Merlion shaped chocolates. A special mention to the Tintin shop further along the street filled with all sorts of goodies for the Tintin fans. (very expensive though!)

At the end of the street is the Mariamman temple (Indian) which is very big and at the time we went, it was closed, so did not venture inside. Turning right at the end of the Pagoda street and around 100 meters ahead is the Temple of the tooth relic.

We initially wanted to skip this temple, but decided to do a quick look and that was the best decision of the day. The temple is a must see with intricate designs and the tooth relic itself is in the 4th floor."
,,Chinatown of Singapore,4.0,,Walk through the streets of souvenirs after visiting the temples. So many good souvenirs you can take home for reasonable prices.

,,Vibrant & always busy,5.0,,"We dined here every day during our stay as the food was of a high quality & much cheaper. The area is vibrant & bustling mainly with tourists as opposed to locals, (they are in the stores or behind the counters)!

,,Enjoyable atmosphere,5.0,,I recommend a visit after dark to really appreciate the sights. There was a procession when I visited and although it was busy the atmosphere was friendly.

,,Chinatown,4.0,,Chinatown is a very Chinese area. It has Hawker Centres and plenty of small food outlets. There is lots to see and do. We went in the evening to take in all the sights and it did not dissappoint. There are lots of souvenir shops also. It is geared more towards tourists.

,,Nice enough area,3.0,,"more 'touristy' in some ways than i expected. The 'street' food wasn't really street foodf, rahter just stalls in the middle of food street with kithcens either side, but was still nice and reasonable. There are plenty of smal bars and shops in the area and it feels safe enough. Sorth a look"
,,Not naughty anymore,5.0,,"Once the centre of Singapore's opium and red light district, Chinatown is now clean, friendly and safe - like all of Singapore. Great restaurants, both traditional and modern. We stayed here and it was a great central location for sightseeing."

,,Chinatown,1.0,,"After strolling from a 25 min walk from marina bay, we stopped for lunch at Chinatown. Mostly seafood, chicken-I had deep fried squid and was not happy with meals. It was not to my satisfaction as it was oily and no flavor. Its also very expensive.

Shopping in Chinatown is fun as there are lots of stalls and you can catch. Some stall are a bit pricey but you need to bargain."
,,Great Chinese food,4.0,,Decided to visit Chinatown for dinner one evening. Lots of stalls that sold souvenirs. And lots of food choices. Lights from above filled the alleyways. It was so pretty. Go and visit. We walked from Marina Square took about 25 mins.
,,Chinatown! Our saviour in Singapore.,5.0,,"I don’t know where we would have been without a Chinatown! An eight day stay in a Singapore and returning to the hotel each day after our wandering adventures, we really needed somewhere to sit down with a drink and just people watch. We did most of our shopping and most of our eating in Chine Town."
,,The place to shop and eat.,5.0,,If you want souvenirs this is the place to shop. So much to choose from and way too many choices of food places. Nice place to wander around.
,,Busy Busy Busy,4.0,,Wandered around Chinatown after catching the MRT from Clarke Quay. Many stalls offering much the same goods. It pays to be a bit competitive with prices and you usually get a good deal.
,,"A souvenir, food and history paradise.",4.0,,"Catch the blue line to Chinatown and get off at exit A at pagoda st. There are 3 main sections. Lots of cheap souvenirs and then the food is amazing as well. Picked up lots of cute toys for my son. Walk through and you'll get to China town food st. More pricey than inside the Chinatown complex. Chinatown complex is wonderful for food. Lots of dessert stalls and the lights and vibe are really nice. Great at night or day but i prefer night. Also heritage centre next to the old Chang kee curry puff stall. Lots to explore here too like maxwell food centre, Indian temple and other interesting areas."
,,A must seen neighborhood,5.0,,We joined a free walking tour around Chinatown and it was the best options since we went there early in the morning before the crowds and we had the chance to enjoy the local living.
,,Great to visit,4.0,,Very touristy and the markets are full of lots of cheap tourist souvenir shops but we still managed to buy some gorgeous chopsticks for home as a lovely souvenir Loads of restaurants to choose from and great photo opportunities
,,Chinese line dancing??,4.0,,"When we arrived in Chinatown the first thing we encountered incongruously was about a hundred people line dancing to Chinese music. Hard to handle lol.
Chinatown Singapore is the same as Chinatown anywhere! Same
Market same food stalls and food that doesn’t in any way replicate the pictures but for all that vibrant and exciting."
,,Cheap Shopping,3.0,,Crowded shopping area but lots of options available for visitors to shop and mingle in the chinese culture.
,,Certainly worth a look,3.0,,"One of the joys of a visit to Singapore is the chance to visit these focused neighbourhoods. Chinatown has all that you would expect with a god choice of food and some well priced, if slightly generic, souvenirs."
,,Tourist Shopping Heaven,4.0,,"Many of the streets in Chinatown are for pedestrian only. This makes for unlimited shopping for a Singapore souvenir, and the prices are right, if you bargin. They also have many restaurants and food markets. My favorite was the Tiger Beer from Sinapore. Food and beer prices are also good even in these tourist areas."
,,Nice to see,4.0,,"We went there on the Big Bus and hopped on hopped off-
Very hot and humid day and we were deposited a few blocks away.

Went to experience this Chinatown and was very touristy and pleasant enough with lots of eating places and many shops selling different tourist trinkets and clothes.
Certainly worth going to and everyone really pleasant and no pushing of product to you."
,,Don't let guard down,1.0,,"Done a lot of walking first day in Singapore and purchased food and drink with no problem.
Got to Chinatown and had maps and phone in hand. Ask the guy selling cold drinks if he could vrwak a $50. He said yes i took change from money and drink and left. Later learning he keep $10. New to country and not up with currency and trusted people from reputation of Singapore. Not happy but lesson for everyone. Get to know currency and check properly."
,,Good place to buy souvenirs and gifts,4.0,,China town is bustling with people. A good place for shopping and eating. Its woth checking the Heritage centre whilst your there. Just be weary of the shops that sell drones and camera's. They woll try and rip you off.
,,Kaleidoscope of colours,3.0,,"A rowdy and noisy place, but if that’s what you are looking for, Chinatowns the place for you. To Singaporean’s, the Chinatown today is “too PRC” and has lost much of its old Singapore Chinese feel - the feel of the old days where immigrants from Southern China made Singapore their home. But from another perspective, what Chinatown is today is reflective of the constant dynamic change of the Chinese diaspora found in Singapore (and around the world today). So, head down and just immerse yourself in all things China Chinese - hot pots, mala dishes, skewered meats, etc. And of cos, don’t miss out the Hindu and Buddhist Temples around. Such an eclectic mix of culture is perhaps a good reminder that makes this Chinatown a uniquely Singaporean one (and of cos, some might argue, a Malaysian one too)."
,,Loved this place,4.0,,"If you visit Singapore you must go to China Town, a real fascinating area in a lot of ways it appeares to be a under developed place but everything was so natural the stores selling electrical goods piled on top of one another no health & safety there, but all good fun. Loved it."
,,chinatown,3.0,,"having been here a few times now I can safely say if you after cheap knock offs and kitch gear then this is the place for you , had a very expensive lunch $50 s which is way to dear for what you get , the only real bright shop for me is the Tin Tin shop"
,,Surprisingly enjoyable,4.0,,"I'm not a big fan of Chinatowns having visited many around the globe, but Singapore's Chinatown is as authentic as they come and is steeped in history, yet is not too frenetic or dirty or full of the usual shops selling junk. I actually managed to enjoy two visits to Chinatown and definitely recommend for a wander."
,,Great time in Chinatown Singapore,5.0,,"My family and I came to Chinatown for lunch on a Saturday and really enjoyed the visit, especially the food street.
Like most Chinatown, it’s filled with many shops selling souvenirs, bars, and great restaurants.
Overall it’s quite clean and a must visit when you’re in Singapore.
I would highly recommend going for a nice meal at on of the many Chinese restaurants where is much more affordable than MBS and Bayfront areas of Singapore."
,,Delightful Chinatown,5.0,,A must-see if you are visiting Singapore. This part of town is quite different to the rest of the city with quirky souvenir shops and temples. Allow at least a couple of hours.

,,Must Visit for Shopping!,5.0,,"I loved Chinatown. It was so cute! Also the souvenir stands are more affordable and have more of what you'd want to buy than the street markets in Hong Kong.

,,Great place to eat and shop!,5.0,,"We went to Chinatown via MRT in the morning to buy engraved name seals.Once you walk out of the MRT station, you are pretty much right in the middle of it all. We got there around 10am and all the food stalls were closed. I think they open around 11 or 11:30am so if you are there to eat, go later in the day.

Chinatown has tons of cheap souvenirs. We went to a specific store (Chinatown Seal Carving Souvenir in Lucky Chinatown) to have name seals made for my sons and for gifts and got a great deal on them. I totally suggest checking out the store if you are visiting Chinatown."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Very easy to get to by Taxi. Lots of different shops. Get anything you want. Cheap and very good eats. Feel very safe and no one hassles you. Great bargains to be had . We bought some jewellery.

,,China Town,4.0,,"Last time in Singapore I was a little disappointed at the seeming lack of culture. It felt very much like a city good for a stopover only. This time we got out and experienced more of what Singapore has to offer including China Town at night. The food was great and it felt a lot more cultural versus polished. If like me, you drove by it during the day and didn't think much of it, I would definitely give it a second chance by visiting it in the evening."
,,Crazy & Fun,4.0,,"Chinatown is bustling with tourists. There are many stalls/shops where you buy just about everything. There is same same, so shop around & bargain for your price to pay."

Beware .. we bought a Samsung Tablet which we thought was the newer Tab S4 with leather case... we later discovered that what we had was TAB E an already 4 yr old tablet … for the Tab E we paid double the cost .. our own fault for being suckered in .. Beware Taxi drivers & Mr Lim"
,,Authentic Chinese food heaven!,5.0,,Pop into any one of the open air restaurants offering authentic Chinese food and you will not regret your choice! Crabs are best !
,,Full of character,5.0,,Good place to shop for souvenirs or even buy some new clothes. Lots to see and many eating places. Full of hustle and bustle. Also great architecture.
,,China tourist town,4.0,,"Chinatown certainly has changed over the years from once very old historic sector with interesting dwellings, buildings and temples to now a very commercial area catering more so for diners and souvenir shoppers. It still has some lovely temples, some of the old streets and a few wall art features. In the evening it becomes very crowded with diners enjoying the street market style eateries. Around Chinatown there are informative signs providing a history of the precinct.
Despite its changes, it is still worth visiting when in Singapore."
,,Made In China,3.0,,"Many countries around the World have a Chinatown. Chinatowns in Asia are widespread with a large concentration of overseas Chinese whose ancestors came from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan & Macau, settling down in compact areas. So does also Singapore, where ChinaTown located within Outram District Precinct of Central Area. The place features distinctly Chinese cultural elements and their way of life. Chinatown here has had a historically concentrated ethic Chinese population in Singapore. Famous Tooth Relic Temple is here.
Chinatown has a huge shopping area for cheap Gift items & variety of Chinese, Korean and Japanese eateries. While shopping from road side small shops don't forget to bargain with a smile. Most items are over priced. But finally you enjoy the ambience and the cosmopolitan crowd & of course cute Gift items.
It can be reached very quickly through NE MRT line. MRT rides are cheap in Singapore. One has to buy a Card which covers both Metro & Bus rides.
Recently had an occasion to revisit the place."
,,Just OK,4.0,,Like so many Chinatowns around the world slightly tacky and aimed (apart from the eating places) pretty much at tourists. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being outstanding) probably a 6

,,Interesting place,4.0,,"Lots of busy market and shop stalls, vibrant colours, food courts to try. Unfortunately the large food complex was closed for renovations but there were many other places to choose from."
,,Chinatown,5.0,,"When in Singapore, Chinatown in a must. Walk thought the streets full of stalls and markets from 3 for one fun gifts to wood carvings and antiques. I usually take guests here for lunch or dinner and never miss a 15 minute reflexology at any of the massage parlours. The architecture is amazing and if you have time go into the Chinatown Heritage Center."
,,Great day,5.0,,"William met our group of six and took us around Singapore on a food
tour - we visited the Malaysian part of the city, then onto the
Chinese district followed by the Indian food courts, we are at each of
these the food was out of this world and William also took us to other
points of interest around the city and gave us not just great advice,
but he was so knowledgable, friendly and kind.\n\nI would recommend to
anyone visit Singapore for a day or too or even longer to book a tour
with local, Amazing, Wonderful, and informative \n\nYvonne coupe and

,,chinatown as in many other places,3.0,,"the best part for me was to see the old houses from the imigrant, for the rest lots of kitch like in most of chinatowns around the world."
,,A Wonderful Experience,5.0,,"This area was fantastic to visit. So many friendly people and the food in some of the little shops was absolutely delicious. The colours, smells, buildings and history are worth the visit but to experience it fully you need to walk each and every street."
,,Must visit,4.0,,"Plenty places to eat and shop, lots of old class shop with beautiful stuff. The older shopkeepers were lovely and chatty. Definitely must visit esp if you have young ones."

,,colourful and busy,3.0,,"Whilst we enjoyed Chinatown, it was pretty much the same as ""Chinatown"" in any country and we were actually disappointed with our flavourless choice of meal (Singapore noodles!). Having said that, we enjoyed the experience and would go back."
,,Walk about,4.0,,Walked shopped and ate here. Fantastic temple easy to barter with stall holders food hall was enormous had to check which letter the stall had up A to D we ate at A and B’s we were all fine.
,,Get a guided tour,5.0,,"Chinatown is great for eating an drinking at night. During the day I'd recommend a guided tour, as there is a lot of history here and you won't see it without a guide."
,,Town not so China,3.0,,"Chinatown has loads of different type shops - if you do find time to walk across Chinatown Point, People's Park and lanes.

But no Chinatown vibes, due to the designs of surround buildings and shop outlets. It looks like just another town, eg. in Toa Payoh or Tampines. No one seems to care that the area doesn't quite live up to the expectations that comes with the name.

Hawkers centre in People's Park quite messy. Time for a good overhaul.

Money changer that's raved about there, could not match the better rates offered a short ride away at the Arcade, much to our surprise.

MRT is the reason we pop by the place more often, usually en-route from some other stations."
,,perfect location,5.0,,"Chinatown is near with everywhere. MRT station, food center, and gift center.. so, if you want to go to Singapore, I think this gonna be the best place to stay."
,,Great experience China Town Singapore,4.0,,"Visit china town in singapore during a weekday and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. To walk around all the streets in the district was well worth the time, (took over 5 hours).
The highlight was the Chinese Heritage Center in Pagoda street. This center has been maintained as it was when it was a tailor/boarding house, you are provided with an audio headset which explains each room and area. allow couple of hours to wander through the whole building.
Wander the streets and visit the many temples and parks dotted throughout, chinatown complex was closed for renovation when we were there but that didn't matter as there are many many food places on the streets where you can get food and drink which is good and reasonably priced. Gift shops abound also and plenty photo opportunities, please be aware in some temples you are not permitted to take photographs.

Overall a great day spent"

,,Vibrant and lively,5.0,,We visited this part of Singapore for a morning and to buy some Street food. It is a colourful and vibrant part of Singapore. You can easily walk around the area in an hour or so. There are lots of Chinese shops and food stalls. There is a heritage museum in the area but we didn't visit it.

,,Get some cheap deals here,3.0,,"You can spend here hours for buying gifts, food. I cannot say it was as clean as the other parts of the city. But me and son enjoyed and got some reasonable price deals:)"
,,Not to be missed.,4.0,,"No holiday in Singapore is complete without a trip to Chinatown - an area which is integral to the development of the nation.
Most of the early Chinese left hardship in China to try and make a better life for themselves, only for most of them to have an almost equally hard life initially, until over several generations, the island nation gradually evolved into what it is today.
For the tourist, Chinatown is a collection of souvenir shops and restaurants all competing for the travellers dollar. There is also a number of very interesting museums and temples, all worth visiting"
,,Worth a visit!,5.0,,"The Chinese are the dominant people in Singapore and many settled there in the 19th century. We found a charming restaurant, Mutton Soup, visited the Hindu Temple and bought some gift items at the outdoor arcade of shops. We missed going to the special temple there."
,,A must see,5.0,,"Great restaurants, shops and lots of old and new buildings to explore and photograph. You can take the subway here from most hotels in central Singapore."
,,A true China Town,4.0,,"Had a guide, Katherine Ross of Destinations Asia, who took us around & visited an amazing temple to the fishermen, which, originally was on the shore line, no more ! It is a ""working"" place of worship so respect is the way. Very interesting history & impressive architecture which has been carefully preserved. Good for SIN believing in conservation & preservation of their heritage, not like the new occupiers of HKG who only seem to know detonation."
,,Glad we visited but not a highlight for us,4.0,,As you would imagine busy and bustling streets with restaurants and shops all after your custom. Think it would be better at night but we ran out of time :o( Very very hot during the day - easily reachable via MRT

,,Fantastic place for food and shopping,5.0,,"Love Chinatown for killing a few hours. It really comes alive at night for shopping and night markets, definitely come here for your Singapore souvenirs.
If you want a great selection of different Asian cuisines, head to Smith Street and dine your way around south East Asia. There's even an amazing Michelen star hianese chicken shop here which I'd certainly worth stopping at.
Does get very crowded at times but that's all part of the experience."

They still had the Chinese New Years decorations up which were good to see. Lots to see and explore in this part of Singapore.
,,An interesting part of Singapore,3.0,,"I had been to China town in my earlier trip.
It was very nice then as the tour operator made us get down and allowed us to walk through the shops and also take photos of the Mariamman temple and other attractions.
On this trip we only had a view from the bus as the bus drove through the street. The guide pointed out the attractions as we drove by."
,,A well worth spot to visit.,4.0,,"As the guide books state Chinatown mostly exists in modern but tired buildings and courtyards .There is an older area across from the MTR station and this brighter area houses dozens of Tourist orientated shops. The choice of where to eat is vast ranging from clinical Food Courts inside a shopping Mall right down to hot and steamy open air venues. Right at the bottom of the pecking order is The Peoples Complex serving great food in a very hot and basic style with food being served from tiny shops and drinks including very well priced Beers from adjacent ones. It reminded me of the bustle of Kowloon, Hong Kong in the early nineties. Great fun ."
,,Loved it,5.0,,Didn’t think I would but my wife and I really enjoyed walking around this area. We bought in the market and had coffee and coconut jam toast in a cafe sitting in a courtyard.
,,Nice atmosphere and travel back in time.,5.0,,Good place to walk and wonderful food and shopping.Try to visit the temple and the chinatown centre is a top sight. It explains you the history of the poor chinese immigrants who came to Singapore. Visit takes you two hours.
,,Must to visit the China town,4.0,,"I think that every city you visit, that has a China town is worth visiting ! And this is one of them. If you come to Singapore this is a must to visit. You will finde so many stores with souvenirs and cultural spots and also you will find so many temples that are really wonderful and beauty, even more for people from countries that doesn’t have any of them, is such a good and interesting experience.

You can also find clothes and accessories with good prices."

,,Gotta love it as a tourist place!,4.0,,Safe and a Great visit and walk between a zillion stalls selling gifts and interesting take-home items. Plan on a half day visit and use the MRT which is great and comes up in the middle of where you want to be. Do bring a Singapore street map to help you navigate. Do not be reluctant to bargain and walk away if not happy because you will find similar trinkets just 2 stalls down! Have a great visit. Good for kids. Good food areas. Don't expect sterling restrooms in the area.
,,Best!,5.0,,"We have visited many Chinatowns around the world including China, for me this is the best. We got many chocolates here and there are many chinese pagodas to visit, many restaurants, etc"
,,Just Like Any Other China Town,3.0,,"The China Town area is one of the stops on the Singapore Hop On/Off Bus. We did not see anything unique that makes this China Town Different than others we have seen, but if you need Chinese items, it would be as good place to go! Just some restaurants and shops."
,,Fascinating area.,5.0,,"Busy residential and business area, lots of shops, cafes, food courts, bakeries. Chinatown heritage museum is a brilliant, fascinating place."

,,Interesting,5.0,,Good and cheapest market to buy goods specially local stuff for gifting and all . Colourful street to buy and eat local food . Good connectivity with metro .
,,FOODY HEAVEN,5.0,,"We had all our meals in and around the hawker stalls. There is so much to choose and the places are all full. A good place to eat is opposite the Heritage Centre where you can enjoy a beer, meal and just people watch. I'm dumplinged out, I enjoy them so much. Just be vary of MSG as I beleive it is used in some dishes."
,,Go for the food or the shopping,5.0,,"The Hawker Center is a wonderful option for inexpensive delicious food. For those who might have concerns about dining in a market, take some comfort in the fact that the local health department inspects the individual stalls and grades them. The grade earned is posted up front and it will most likely be an ""A"" or a ""B."" If they get less than a ""B"" I believe they must shut them down until they improve because we only saw ""A's"" and ""B's."" After a delicious meal you really should roam the streets and the markets. There are lots of inexpensive, quality and souvenir type items to be bought but you need Singapore dollars. Almost none of the stands will accept credit cards, but ATM's are readily available."
,,Must Visit,4.0,,"Great place to visit, great selection of restaurants and shops. My wife got a message here and said it was really good.
Great place to buy souvenirs at very reasonable prices. Unusual souvenirs can be purchased in Chinatown.
Restaurants are very responsible priced and tasty food too.
MRT station takes you right into Chinatown."

,,A must do,4.0,,"A visit to Chinatown is a must in most big cities and Singapore is no exception. The relatively small area is very noisy and vibrant, especially at night, and full of atmosphere. It’s rather scruffy nature is a relaxing antidote to the surgical cleanliness elsewhere . . .
We did eat there but rather regretted it. The food is frenetic rather than fantastic.
However, very worthwhile experience."
,,Chinatown,3.0,,"We enjoyed our evening in the area which was quite lively with street restaurants and lots of stalls selling clothes etc.

If you go there looking for a lovely upmarket Chinese meal you may struggle as we didn’t find such a place in all the streets."

,,China Town Singapore review,4.0,,"It maintains its Singapore China Town original structures, still have many traditional Singapore foods even quite many new Chinese food set ups from China. Day time its rather hot unless it rains, but evening its quite ok, its definitely worth the visit"
,,it is ok.,3.0,,"It is fun to go if you were coming from non Asian countries, but just shops and food, not much to represent culture and history of China. The whole Singapore look like china, not so unique to go to china town in Chinese country. The temple is nice to look while you are at it."
,,Shopping and food mecca,5.0,,"Wow
Chinatown in Singapore. Equal to other Chinatown precincts in other parts of the world.
We visited during the day and at night.
Quality merchandise and in most cases - prices can be bartered for.
Some amazing street food vendors offering incredible food and cheap prices.
Do yourself a favor and visit Chinatown. Yo won't regret it!"
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,"Great place to go to soak up some Chinese culture. MRT Chinatown gets you close to all the action. Definitely wander the the markets & the hawker centres. We were lucky to be there just on the tail end of the Chinese New Year celebrations. Don’t go before about 11am as nothing much happens until later in the day. Very clean, great bargains to have, not only in the markets but in the smaller shops. Buddha tooth relic temple is right next to all the street markets, worth going in to get the contrast from the hustle outside to the peace inside."
,,Cultural Ride!,4.0,,China town is a cultural ride. Walk around the streets and you will get to eat different food places and beautiful temples.
,,China Town offers everything,5.0,,"My Major attraction in China town is definitely food, Cupping Therapy, some souvenir and Hawker Chan.

Drop at the earliest hour of the day otherwise getting a table will be very hard."
,,Singapore’s Chinatown is different from other countries! A must visit for sure!,5.0,,"A village within the city, a community that’s offers everything from food to essentials (flip flops which I desperately needed) and of course your usual tourist trinkets- the heavens opened up on our visit and the roads were awash with torrents of water! One hour later and we were able to walk around again!"
,,Like every other Cina Town,3.0,,Went there just for the famous chciken rice restarant ( or should i say fast food shop). Very small area full of tat shops and some nice hawker venues

,,A must visit in Singapore,4.0,,"A must visit in Singapore if you want to buy cheap and cheerful souvenirs and eat Chinese food, visit a Chinese and Indian temple. Easily accessible by bus from Orchard Road S$1.50. Close to Clark Quay, Boat Quay and the Business District."

,,Casual walk through,4.0,,"First up don’t get there early in the morning, doesn’t really open till after 1030am, once there you have plenty of options you just need to find what you are looking for

Food is plentiful and not that expensive depending on what you are looking for

We had a massage and was great value,"
,,worth a visit,4.0,,"Very easy to get to, take the MRT to the Chinatown stop and exit at the Pagoda Street exit. This is the place to go for very cheap souvenirs, however, there is also still some character to the area. Check out the food street for great little restaurants/food stalls.
Definitely worth a stroll around."
,,Nice Visit,4.0,,"Chinatown is located in central Singapore. It has many historical attractions and Peranakan style buildings and it is divided into four districts: Telok Ayer, Kreta Ayer, Tanjong Pagar and Bukit Pasoh, and the center of activities revolves around Smith and Pagoda Streets. Things to see in Chinatown include Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, Pinnacle@Duxton, Sri Mariamman Temple, Red Dot Design Museum, Singapore City Gallery, Singapore Coin and Notes Museum, Thian Hock Keng Temple and many, many restaurants and hawker food courts. Chinatown is haven for food lovers. You can find traditional Singaporean hawker dishes at Chinatown Food Street. You can view live food preparation at Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant. A Noodle Story is an innovative food hawker stall. Some of the popular spots include Burnt Ends, Si Wei Mao Cai, Potato Head Folk, Tong Ah Eating House, Kok Sen Restaurant and Mei Heong Yuen Dessert. The Chinatown MRT Station is located on Pagoda Street."
,,Try to visit just before Chinese new year!,5.0,,"What a colorful part of town. Just before Chinese New Year, jou get a lot of decoration and festivities. A lot of shops and street venders. Hundreds of restaurants."

,,Let down,3.0,,"I have seen a few China Towns from my travels and I thought the one in Singapore, being in Asia, would be superb. But it is small and does not ahve the same vibe as others like New York for instance"
,,You should visit while in Singapore,5.0,,"Fun place to walk around to buy some suvoneers and grab a bite to eat. Chinatown isn't just 1 or 2 streets so give yourself some time to explore, I'd say 2 hours at least if you don't have much time and up to 5 hours if your just taking it easy and taking your time."
,,Love China Town,5.0,,Enjoy the really touristy streets but walk to the outer streets as well for more of a local experience. Lots of great eating and I never tire of watching the world go by here.
,,The real Singspore,5.0,,"We were staying near Clatke Quay, the tourist area, and wanted to get a taste of the real Singapore that was within walking distance. Chinatown did not disappoint! Frenetic in the humid heat! Fortunately there was a modern air conditioned departmental store to escape to when we had had our fill of the local buzz!
Not to be missed though."
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,"Was good to have a walk around at night but a lot of the touristy shops are all the same. Was very hot walking around. Very busy place at night. Lovely thing to do while in Singapore. I loved all the lanterns hanging down, very pretty"
,,Chinatown in Singapore,4.0,,"Since there are many Chinese people in Singapore it makes sense to have a chinatown. However there are many other attractions like temples to visit. Make sure ti inclyde that in your visit. The Chinatown MRT is so convenient near. You will find many chinese spices and also restaurants, material shops and places to have a massage very reasonable.
The Chinese Heritage Centre a must
They have taken much care to make you truly feel how the chinese people did and how they lived some years ago. 10/10 for the Heritage centre. They even have different incense on different floor to go with the mood of the exhibition."
,,Must go on Chinese New Year,4.0,,"Especially the public market at Chinatown, can get antique furniture, lacquer ware and souvenir. You also can find many traditional clothing here."

Very exiting to walk through and enjoy the quick life at CHINATOWN!"
,,Chicken Rice and Spicy Crab,4.0,,Look for the restaurant with Anthony Bourdain’s picture inside. Totally nondescript on Smith Street. Also look for the hawker in the middle of Smith Street (at the far end) for the spicy crab. It literally has crabs on the food stall.
,,"Colorful, multiple things to choose",4.0,,"Location is closed to the down town. Just 20 minutes to get there. You can visit temples which is spaceless and beautiful if details. Go out and take the road leads to opposites of the temple , visit some nice stores for shopping, promised you not regret! Take a day and go around, enjoy tea and Chinese food. Great day, everyone!"
,,Mixed feeling,4.0,,Was expecting more and for shopping I recommend better Bugis area but anyway - Buddha Tooth Relic Temple was good sight and of course - Hawker Chan Michelin 1* food place.
,,All and nothing,4.0,,"The correct place if you wants to bring small souvenirs for everybody like T-shirts, magnets, etc... Do not hesitate to bargain"
,,Vibrant & colourful Chinatown,5.0,,"We came through Chinatown on our first day in Singapore on a bike tour with Jeff of Lion Tours. We came back ourselves in the following days as we found the best souvenir shopping & jewellery stores we’re here. Also lots of cafes, restaurants and food hawker centres to choose from. Highly recommended."

,,Best China Town in Asia,5.0,,"I have been amazed by the clean streets , the high quality food in Smith Street , the wonderful night lights , it was really an excellent experience."
,,Very average,3.0,,This is just a tourist trap with little appeal. Lots and lost of cheap souvenirs. Not much authentic stuff. Food street put me off the whole experience. Lots of overpriced average food ..... as described by one of the workers to us.
,,Another Cinatown,3.0,,"Like other China-towns, this one has also become commercialized. You can still see glimpses of the past, but most of it are for tourists. Try to take a guided tour, and learn about the evolution of the area."
,,New Year Lamps everywhere,5.0,,"Due to the Chinese New Year there were everywhere lights which made it most interesting to visit China Town at night, a memorable experience"
,,not bad for a chinatown,4.0,,"I probably spent too much time here. Did my laundry. Ate chicken and rice in the market at the guy with the 1 michelin star (not as good as I expected), shopped too much and bought very little, but my kids did like the rubber chicken and pig."
,,Great place,5.0,,"One of our favourite areas in Singapore, nice food, good shopping cheapish hotels. We will def be back soon and actually stay in this area next time instead of just daytrip it."
,,Getting a guide is worth it!,5.0,,"This is a fascinating part of the city, but you'll get a lot more out of it if you have a guide to show you around and introduce you to the hidden corners of the area, not to mention helping you to order great food!"
,,Chinese New year,5.0,,It was Chinese New year whilst we were there if you can stand the crowds then go for it. We were there very early evening and it was already very busy so decided to eat early. Very good value for money. We stayed for about 2 hours after eating but it became too busy for us. When we left all the eating places were very full so eat early and get plenty of choice
,,Old Singapore,4.0,,Chinese have populated the area for hundreds of years and although not as Chinese focused as it once was it has been retained in many places with its old buildings many of which are heritage listed. It is one of the more interrsting areas of singapore and worth a stroll through. Catch the subway (Blue Line) and get out at Chinatown and walk around. The old buildings are well signed. Some of it is tacky but mostly interesting.
,,So many great places to eat,5.0,,"Really love the area because food is in abundance, and love to see all the characters there. Glad I stayed in this area as well."
,,Really Enjoyed Singapore Chinatown,5.0,,"Really enjoyed our time in Chinatown in Singapore. There were some really neat architectural buildings and there was more room to maneuver in the market areas. The market prices were good (with a little bartering where it made sense to do so), the goods were of a larger variety than most of the markets we had visited in other Asian cities, essentially something for everyone. There were also lots of choices for restaurants. The people in the shops and stalls were always willing to help and answer questions and we didn't find that most were too pushy trying to sell you something you didn't want."
,,A very authentic place to visit,5.0,,"We were there in Chinese Lunar New Year period. It was all lights up with decorations and the whole ambient was just beautiful and joy! We went to walk down the whole street and also visit the Indian temple, smith street and the magnificent Chinese temple.

You must try the local authentic food of white and black sauce carrot cake, oyster omelette, cha kway teow ,coconut water and ice kacang , lastly the satay.

We tried all that and finds it yummy ! also we tried the northern Chinese food which is very spicy too"
,,Interesting area worth visiting,4.0,,Fun area worth viewing. Easily walkable area with great food and worthy things to see. Plan to spend 2-3 hours just viewing the area. Lots of cheap junk but a fun walk. Wear comfortable shoes.
,,Great local foods,4.0,,It is such a contrast to see the traditional Chinese temple and old town decorated with red lanterns with a background of modern buildings. You will enjoy local foods in reasonable prices.

,,Nice way to see a different Singapore,5.0,,"I really enjoyed Chinatown. I had a tour guide, which I recommend, as it helps to understand the history. There is s different feel here than in other parts of Singapore. Great food in the area, colorful buildings, just a great place to walk around, enjoy, and learn from."
,,Great shopping,5.0,,Compared to chinatown in KL - this is amazing. Loads of room and you are not hassled by sellers. Loads of great stuff both budget and higher end and great place for souvenirs with loads of options. Close by is hawker centre but we found that way too busy. Get MRT to chinatown and exit following Pagoda street signs and you are there. Loads of stalls and we found a really great hand made store selling ornaments that was different from others and really nice stuff at a reasonable price. Had a good time here.

,,A must,4.0,,When you visit Singapore you must visit Chinatown. Soak in the atmosphere. Good shopping lots to see.
,,Amazing China Town,5.0,,"Defiantly worth several hours touring China town in Singapore. Lots of street vendors, shops and temples. Make sure to eat in one of the Hawker food courts.

,,Hot pot galore,5.0,,"We visited Singapore in March 2019 and stayed in Chinatown at the scarlet Singapore.
Chinatown has everything anyone could ask for, but one thing I will say is that they have a hugeeee variety of hot pot/ Shabu Shabu restaurants which are open all hours of the day!
It’s not as manic as central Singapore so is perfect for couples or families!"

,,You Just Keep Coming Back,5.0,,"It doesn’t matter if its the cheap food, the tourist trinkets, or maybe you want to try the famous Durian fruit (smells like hell but tastes like heaven). You can do it all plus plenty more in Singapores Chinatown."

It was pleasant to see shops and stalls still opened after 10pm. I also managed to get very good buys from CK departmental store. The 2 Cheongsams were on offer and I bought 2 for only $15! It was a steal because the Cheongsams were fully lined!! We saw lots of souvenirs and there was a shop that sold clothes from Nepal. The pedestrianised streets were also lit up. After the walk we also sat down to a refreshing Thai coconut drink. All in all, it was a very pleasant evening."
,,Worth a small detour,3.0,,Our hotel was just a few minutes from Singapore's Chinatown. We found it to be quite small and perhaps not as vibrant as others we have visited.
,,Very touristic,3.0,,Went there after many years and it has changed a lot. The typical Chinese Market is there and lots of restaurants or food stands. The prices are really high except you want to buy some Chinese fake stuff. It has lost it atmosphere at all. Its all about money.
,,Great shopping and good cheap food,5.0,,Well worth jumping on the MRT and visiting China Town either to shop or just have a good meal- certainly plenty to choose from. Alcohol is rather expensive throughout Singapore so be prepared to pay. Most cafes Charge for the item ++ (serevice charge plus GST
,,Chinatown,3.0,,This place was so confusing on where you are going. Everything looks the same and most shops are selling the same item. Walk pass the food places and some of them give a bad smell. It is off putting. However if you would like to purchase souvenirs this is the place to go.

,,Quick stops,4.0,,"Great, with lovely decorations everywhere for Year of the Pig. Had a quick meal whilst on a night tour ."
,,"Not the best Chinatown, I've been too.",3.0,,"Seemed to contain a lot shops selling the same things of varying quality. Several tailors if your looking for some made to measure clothes. A few temples to see, streets look a lot better in the evening all lit up."
,,Colorful Street Decorations & Buildings,4.0,,"The streets of Chinatown still had the Chinese New Year decorations our for the year of the pig when we visited. They were beautiful to see everywhere. The roadways had colorful Chinese lanterns streamed across the roads as well as large Chinese coin decorations. The real attraction is the Chinatown Street Market where you can find souvenirs and tons of restaurants to eat at.

BOTTOM LINE: Well worth a taxi drive through the area and many streets. Be sure to stop and visit the Chinatown Street Market while here. MY RATING: 8/10"
,,Come here one week before Lunar New Year,5.0,,"You would be able to experience the bustle of Chinatown only during the week before the Lunar New Year(would occur at a different time yearly, check online).

Usual scene would be rows of shophouses selling seafood and local delights. A good place to shop for souvenirs like keychains, as they have a wide selection there."
,,A China Town with History,4.0,,"Great to be able to wander through the streets without traffic, lots of eating places , we enjoyed lunch here also the Temple is a magnificent building and worth a visit, particularly on a hot day ,(its air-conditioned)"
,,Be Careful,3.0,,"Not really any good deals here! A lot of tat on sale and people talking up the products, but prices are better elsewhere in Singapore"
,,Get a tour “With Locals”. Great experience,5.0,,"Our tour guide was HJ. He was great. Not only did he give us a food tour, but a history tour including one of the best views of the city atop his apartment complex 50 stories up. A great time."
,,Loved it,5.0,,"A must when visiting Singapore, streets closed off to cars so you just wander around looking at all the goodies for sale. Cheap tourist items to buy for friends back home and the food places are great. Would go here every night for dinner if up to me. Cant wait till next time I visit."
,,Very instagramble,4.0,,Veri instagramable. Many delicious chinese foods on this street. Many chinese ornament and chinese old building still on good condition.
,,A must,5.0,,"For a fascinating peek into Singapore’s Chinese culture and history, Chinatown is good place to start. Here, you’ll enjoy a mix of heritage visits to museums, shopping as well as a good variety of food options."
,,Still the same.,5.0,,"I remember going to Chinatown 15 years ago and its still the same in a good way. A great place to buy souvenirs, have a drink or a meal. I also visited a place where little fish nibble the dead skin on your feet. It's actually very relaxing soaking your feet in a tank of water while the fish do there work especially after walking around Chinatown for a couple of hours on a warm day. There are so many little shops you will definitely find a gift here. We went down to Chinatown most days to get something to eat and a tall glass of homemade lemon ice tea which was very refreshing in the warm sticky weather. A place worth visiting."
,,Not as large as I expect. Good food choices,3.0,,A great afternoon here in Chinatown. Not a lot of markets but the restaurants were plenty and mostly inexpensive. Worth a visit.
,,WOW. A Cultural extravaganza.,5.0,,The Chinatown area is a hustling and bustling area providing a miriade of activities and experiences. Recommend the Chinese Heritage Centre as a starting point to get a good comprehensive history (allow at least 2 hours for the centre). Good restaurant options from full service sit down to street hawkers. An experience not to be missed.
,,Fun to Visit During Chinese New Year at Night,5.0,,"It was my first visit to Singapore's Chinatown, and I was lucky that it was at night right before Chinese New Year. There were so many lit lanterns strung around the buildings and the special holiday stands selling new year's food and trinkets, that the area was bathed in an atmospheric red glow. Lots of people were out looking at the special stands, getting free sample goodies from the vendors, admiring the decorations, and there was good cheer among them all on a busy Friday night. We had already had dinner, so we didn't graze on the Food Street, though it was fairly packed with families having dinner. Since I really enjoyed the area at night, I returned the next day during the daylight hours, and some of the magic was lost. I would not have rated it a 5-star attraction in the daylight, rather only a 4 for the historical significance of the area."
,,Lived up to expectations,5.0,,"Chinatown was everything I had imagined, it was colourful, busy and filled with tantalising aromas and food to sample wherever you looked."
,,Wow,4.0,,Traditional food street much variety and culture apparent although it was very humid at 29degrees in the early evening it was well worth the visit
,,Fun place to visit,5.0,,"I couldn’t get over how clean Singapore is and Chinatown is no exception. Lots of souvenirs to buy, but I will say things were cheaper in Hong Kong markets.
Enjoyed going to the Medicine market to get herbal remedies for aches n pains.
Lots of different foods to try as well.
If you can, visit Chinatown at night because everything is all lit up and looks amazing."
,,Good shopping and interesting foods,4.0,,"Our destination was the Buddha Temple tooth-relic museum, but our path went through Chinatown. We stopped to check out some shops, and I was pleased at the quality of wares offered at a few we visited. Expecting cheap souvenirs, what I found was a variety of quality chopstick sets, excellent tea services, scarves, rice bowls, clothing, and other fine gifts. A sad side note, I read in the newspaper before I left Singapore that Chinatown will be undergoing a three month renovation. There are a few vendors (one a long time shop owner) that are not sure if they can hold out that long without income, and the rest are uneasy about their futures as well."
,,Lovely environment,5.0,,"Decent environment with virtually everything around you, was scared of eating though, so I would not end up eating lizard!"
,,Vibrant area,4.0,,We visited here because we wanted to see the Temple and were not disappointed. The whole area was buzzing with life. The sights and smells were unlike anything else we had seen in Singapore. We ate a delicious and cheap meal on the food area and shopped in a pleasant jewellery shop before we visited the temple. They are strict regarding frees and loaned shawls to cover bare arms. The interior is stunning with gold everywhere and devout Buddhists worshipping.
,,Chinatown hmmmm,2.0,,"not a fan - dirty, grubby, market was rubbish, lots of stuff you don't need, didn't try any of the food here - some of the restaurants are too pushy to get you to buy their food which put us off"
,,Best chinese food in the world,5.0,,"The night market which comes up for Chinese New Year is fantastic. Cheap jelly 100g/$1 and cheap ice cream $1/cup I always get the mango flavour. The food is marvellous, and at a cheap price too. I went to hawker chan and the other places with such well executed food. Will come back!"
,,Chinatown Heritage Museum,5.0,,"Of course, great food to choose from. For those interested in a little history, the Chinatown Heritage museum gives you a look back into the not too distant past of how Chinese immigrants from southern China were brought here to be slaves or prostitutes, or those who came here looking for work as coolies. The museum was exceptionally put together and you can see how they lived just
2 generations ago. The temples and architecture of this and Little India are great photo opportunities.....MDSPOCK"
,,Lively Chinatown during Chinese New Year,4.0,,"Lively Chinatown during Chinese New Year. There is a temp pasar malsar (street market) selling lots of Chinese New Year goodies eg candies, fruits, flowers, cookies & etc. There are shop houses along street to tell some history of this place. There is a heritage museum whereby you can learn about the chinese living n how they come to Singapore. Food is everywhere. Food street, hawker central, coffee shops & restaurants whereby you can find all the delicious local food. Easily accessible by just taking mrt to underground Chinatown mrt stn."
,,Must visit during CNY,4.0,,Chinatown is a nice part of town to try out local food and immerse into the Chinese culture. Definitely worth a visit during Chinese New Year!
,,Warm and Bustling,5.0,,Visited Chinatown nearing the Chinese New Year period. Crowded but can soak up the festive atmosphere. Good food.
,,Touristy but worth a visit,4.0,,"If you've been to the various Chinatowns around the world ( London, New York, San Fransisco, Sydney) this is nothing special. It is very touristy, with a lot of souvenir shops and restaurants, but if you wander around the side streets you find some interesting shops, Chinese medicine stores, and some very good, cheap authentic food.
Definitely one of the more interesting neighborhoods in Singapore."
,,Fantastic.,4.0,,Clean. welcoming. Great restaurants. Felt safe moving around. Market stalls all a little repetitive selling all the same stuff but didn’t feel pressured or bothered by people pushing products on to us
,,The real and fake of Singapore Chinatown,5.0,,"I am local.Chinatown, in my eyes has evolved to a tourist spot and eroded by the commercial gains. So if u see the shops selling souvenirs- they are “fake”- mostly stuff sold there are not made in Singapore. If u see shops selling pots and pans & traditional Chinese looking “biscuits/pantry”, these are likely to be real and authentic- trades of chinaman. If u see a Chinese man( with black China pant” - dark tall and funny- using Chinese ink “plein aire” - he is local and authentic. Have a chat with him and he will capture you in his artwork. He is one of the 3rd genreration Singapore ( nanyang)Artist by the name of Tung Yue Nang( and a rather famous and established local artist). You can spend an hour or 2 touring around, and don’t forget to visit the Chinatown Heritage center(if u have time) which will give you a fairly accurate picture of how Chinese suffered when they migrated from China and tolled and how they contribute to nation building of Singapore ( during colonial times and the days leading to independence). Try to eat some Tim Sum (one of local favourite) and desserts while you are there."
,,Awesome!!!,5.0,,"Souviner item very cheap and quality!!! Variety of choices of souviner. Clean environment. Cheap, cheap, cheap!! Easy to get MRT."
,,Love the color and vibrancy of Chinatown,5.0,,"We stayed in Chinatown on oiur recent visit to Singapore. Love the colour and vibrancy, especially as they had all the decoration up for Chinese New Year still when we were there. Love the food at the Hawker stalls, so cheap and delicious. and a great place for souvenirs"
,,One of the 2 busy areas of Singapore,5.0,,"After Little India, this area is full of people and tourists exploring the hustle and bustle of Singapore by walks and shopping. Good place to change money and buy chinese stuff. Explore the lanes on foot and you will be amazed to find hidden gems."
,,Good to Visit,5.0,,"This place has different vibe, road side shops and eateries are must to visit once. Either you are tourist or resident, recommended to go there, have citrus high ball drink ( jeam beam + soda + lime) with dim sum ( momos )"
,,"Visit was enjoyable, especially the food",4.0,,We had to visit Chinatown. A little disappointed with some of the shops but the food did not disappoint - very cheap and plentiful
,,What a place of noise and activity,4.0,,"We visited both in the day and one evening as meal destinations. Getting off the train at Chinatown, we walked towards our right past many stalls selling a large variety of food at very cheap prices. We found the Friendship Court, a small restaurant hub at the bottom of the strip which was indoors and air conditioned. Extremely noisy but so much fun. There are 2 vendors which serve meals to the patrons....one has a menu and the others is broadcasted on a TV. The food was cheap and incredibly good but only if you like very spicy Chinese. It was a fabulous experience and worth finding this place."
,,Evokes a 1930s vibe,5.0,,"Growing up in San Francisco, I thought I knew the greatest Chinatown, but Singapore's is equally great, and in a different way. In this one, the structures and streets and tiny shops and bars evoke the feeling of going back in time. You can almost picture what it must have been like here back in the 1920s and 30s. And the food choices, OMG."
,,Two Views of Chinatown,4.0,,"I visited Chinatown twice on this trip. The first time was early in the morning to visit the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum. It was quiet and gave me more time to wander around and explore without all the crowds and jostling that occurred later in the evening. Not many stores were open at the time but I was not here to shop. Every block had a plaque describing the historical past of the street which ranged from Chinese funeral parlors, Japanese prostitutes who gave some of their wages to the Japanese government during WW2, etc. it was also surprising to stumble across both a mosque, Jamie, and one of the oldest Hindu temples in Singapore, Sri Mariamman. The Chinese New Year decorations, celebrating the year of the pig, were still on display along New Bridge Rd.

In the evening, the restaurants and stores were open and the streets were packed with both locals and tourists. The Chinatown Complex was closed for renovation (a common theme on this trip) so I went to the Chinatown Food Street which was a covered outdoor food area. The restaurants and stalls had extensive menus with picture boards showing Thai, Malay in addition to Chinese dishes. Souvenir shops were also busy selling all sorts of Knick knacks.

It was easy getting here via bus which ran along Upper Cross St or MRT, station was located along Mosque St and New Bridge Rd."
,,If you have time,3.0,,For this area I can’t say ‘must see’ ıf you have time you can go. Shopping prices lower than orchard.
,,Usual tourist traps,3.0,,The shopping area is totally common. The people are definitely less friendly . Two temples to visit : Budha Tooth Temple and the Hindu Sri Mariamman Temple. Stay away from the shopping area.
,,lou lou and riggers expolring,4.0,,very interesting area it was new year while we were there and the streets looked lovely there was a street parade but we missed it as we spent too long at the gardens in the bay
,,have to visit really,4.0,,Lots of market stalls. The usual fare but not cheap as most chinatowns are. Gets very busy. Still lots there for new years cellebrations. That made it a tad more special.
,,Ulalallalaleyo!!!,3.0,,"Chinatown brings upon the much provided solace to the travelers, as it is home to some of the cheapest shopping plazas and you name a thing, you'll get it, for cheap, dirt cheap. Good stuff, from China, sold for throwaway rates."
,,Fun and Chinatown frenzy.,4.0,,Sensory overload here with all the sights and sounds. Plenty of food and shopping options. There are some cool temples to visit when open which seemed touch or go as when I went the main one was closed for cleaning. It was a nice experience and I would say it’s definitely worth visiting.
,,Pretty good,3.0,,"China town was nice, however if you have been to markets in Beijing or Shanghai this China town will disappoint. An abundance of restaurants and vendors."
,,Bustling part of town with a cool vibe,5.0,,"We took a long stroll through Chinatown, through the popular Keong Saik road which was filled with expensive cars and lots of interesting restaurants. I found it fascinating that there are so many temples in such a small area, all with their own unique, authentic styles."
,,Old Singapore,4.0,,Good to have a look on old Singapore how it looked like. Two very interesting temples are here - Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Sri Mariammam Temple. Chinese market is here as well. It is possible to have a look and even smell the famous durian fruit. Famous food hall here is well. It is nice to be here once but there are a lot of places with better and cheaper food and better service.
,,Definitely worth a visit.,4.0,,"We went to china town and really enjoyed it! We had a good meal and my mom thought there were great deals, although I thought it was a lot of touristY junk."
,,More than just a “China”-town,5.0,,"Unlike many “Chinatowns” elsewhere, this Chinatown is not just about Chineseness or Chinese food. It embraces the past in as much as it tells a modern Singapore story about the uniqueness of this place and its development. The multiculturalism of Singapore stands out with the different temples (Hindu, Chinese) one finds in Chinatown. For conservationists, the preservation of heritage buildings (colonial shophouses) might be of great interest. In addition to the nice food one finds in the hawker centres or food markets there are also a Singapore city gallery featuring a miniature version of the centre of Singapore in 3D. Those with an appetite for historical, socio-cultural as well as anthropological learnings (for example, the Perananka culture) might want to visit the museums around or the Baba house on Neil Road. And do not miss the nice view from the top of one of the world’s tallest residential buildings at Duxton skybridge. For a glimpse of political participation- Singapore style, visit the Speakers’ Corner in Hong Lim Park."
,,Lots if shops for trinkets,4.0,,"We walked all over Chinatown . Huge statues of pigs at the entrance to mark Year if the pig. Fun place to roam around , loads of restaurants. Nice Temple there well..."
,,China experience,5.0,,"Loud, busy, brash and good fun, allow a full day to explore, try the tempting foods on offer, visit the lovely temple and on no account fail to visit the indoor market"
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"Nice place to walk around and realax. We went into the temple with a guide. Its funny to hear about the first people who came here and buildt it. We saw pictures from the beginning and the se was close to the temple. Things changes, to the better, I`m not sure. Take a walk and explore Chinatown."
,,It is not WOW,3.0,,"I did not like it as did not see good products and most of them they don't communicate English well, preferably not to visit unless you have no other choice"
,,Great place to eat,4.0,,"We dined on street food in Chinatown. It was excellent to share some smaller dishes, and we also tried a frozen mango dessert.

Souvenirs are very cheap - we bought a pack of cards for just $4 and later found them for double the price elsewhere in the city.

Definitely worth visiting as part of any Singapore trip. Avoid the stinky durian stall!!!"
,,Buy souvenirs here; they’re way more expensive elsewhere,4.0,,"I shopped for souvenirs in many places in Singapore. You can find the same exact knick-knacks all over, from airport to hotel to attraction gift shops. Trust me, they’re far cheaper in Chinatown. You see the same Batik handbags and Faberge eggs everywhere, but in Chinatown, they’re priced to sell quickly. Plus, you can negotiate with the sellers."
,,Absolutely Fabulous,5.0,,"If you're in Singapore, put this on your places to go list, food, location, people all fantastic, and very reasonable prices."
,,Go for the food,5.0,,The food experience in the evening is a must do. It was wonderful.A very safe feeling outing. Try at least one thing you have never eaten.
,,An interesting neighbourhood to visit,4.0,,"Full of people, houses, stores, fast food restaurants, at places - interesting architecture; Chinese lanterns all over. Well worth a visit to soak up in Far Eastern culture, though in Singapore everything is a little bit different ... When we visited, it was the Chinese New Year, so a lot of decorations were spread all over."
,,Fun area,5.0,,"Went wandering in Chinatown and it was fun. There are plenty of hawker stands with wonderful, inexpensive options. Good shops and many interesting products."
,,Interesting Place,4.0,,We went there at lunch time and was rather busy. Plenty to see and quite big compared with some China towns.
,,Nice Destination,4.0,,"China Town is a nice destination to visit, and also I love Chinese culture that's why it makes me feel happy. We arrived at there by our college project as a walking tour from Tanjong Pagar, so we have walked around and enjoyed their environment. It felt liked we arrived in Royal China City. Oh!!! I almost forget to say that, Bacon is really good... I can't forget that taste. There are their lovely handcraft to see around. I do love it and I wanna go again."
,,Fun to walk through and best dim sum,5.0,,"Chinatown is an easy taxi ride from the Mandarin Oriental and fun to walk through. All the decorations from Chinese new year added to the festive feelings and the shops, stores, and markets were fun. We had the best dim sum lunch we have ever eaten."
,,Chinese New Year,5.0,,"Visited China town during the Chinese New Year, it was great to see decorations and festivities. Had a great time here just walking about, lots to see."
,,Interesting,5.0,,"As it is the year of the pig and celebrations are nearly finished, it was lovely to see the dicorations, the variety of colours and the many eateries. Not so pleasant seeing the ducks on the rotisserie still with their heads and beaks!!!!! lol"
,,Gem of a place,5.0,,Chinatown is the place you want to be when you are visiting Singapore. Connected by the subway too and easily accessible. Numerous places to shop and eat. The pub street is walking distance from chinatown.
,,Different,4.0,,"A visit to Chinatown in Singapore takes you away from the big commercial areas of the city into a different area. The low rise buildings, markets and food street are great to walk around. The area is easily reached and easy to walk around."
,,China in miniture,4.0,,Brilliant to go there if you like to experience the local street food and the hustle and bustle of the side streets. Experience a little part of China for real. Very safe and great fun. The temple is amazing. Taxis are very cheap to take you there if not on an organised tour. More fun to go and wander at your own pace.
,,I feel what a Chinatown is.,4.0,,There are a lot of Chinese food and goods. Everything interested me. It is not so large area; therefore you can enjoy this area on a half day.
,,Very touristy.,3.0,,"Very touristy, small shops selling cheap souvenirs, massage joints, and restaurants that sell beer by the bucket. If you need a small gift for back home you can find something here. Don't forget to bargain."
,,Fun visit,3.0,,"Small Chinatown, includes Hindu temple. It is a great place for Chinese food, souvenirs, gifts, etc. It is a relatively small area spread out over several blocks along three to four streets."
,,Most amazing Chinatown!,5.0,,This Chinatown is very amazing. The cleanest and most amazing place to see. Love the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. The Intan museum is a must. This gives you an idea of how they lived years ago. Chinatown is a must see.
,,CHINATOWN AN INTERESTING PLACE TO SEE.,4.0,,"On our holiday in Singapore we visited Chinatown during the day.
An amazing place. The Hawkers Markets were very interesting and there are many food sellers. The look of the sellers stalls go from very good to ordinary.
It is a very busy location with what i call a few dirty looking areas.
Inside the large shopping area are a number of Jewellers Selling Hundreds of items made of gold. I have never seen such a massive area which was all gold items on red cloth. An absolute Eye opener like i have ever seen in my life.
There are a lot of cheap clothing shops and many food outlets to choose from. They are selling all types of food including cooked frogs. Something i have not seen like this before. Food to please everyone.
Overall A RECOMMENDED PLACE TO VISIT. A real eye opener.
We traveled from Australia courtesy of Elevate Travel Australia. Thanks Karena."

,,The real Singapore!,5.0,,"If you have had enough of the big name brands in giant shopping malls, then it's time to hang out in Chinatown. Eclectic and exciting, you can buy cheap gifts and eat well on a budget."
,,Lots of places to eat,4.0,,"For some reason, we always stopped by Chinatown every chance we get on our two-week stay in SG. Food is good and it's everywheeerrree...and although the People's Park Complex Hawker wasn't that well ventilated we still keep coming back because we just really liked it. The food is great"
,,Interesting place to visit,4.0,,"Actually went to China town with a guide which was excellent. Clearly you can do it on your own but it was great to understand more of the culture and visit places you may never find on your own .
One of the food sellers in the Hawkers market even has a Michelin star ! And so many items for sale we don’t see the the uk like crocodile , frogs and snakes !
Enjoyed visiting the Buddhist temple too."
,,Great during CNY,4.0,,We went to Chinatown right before the CNY celebrations and it was a great occasion to buy special decorations. You can also try here some of those little carts with the typical ice cream on bread.
,,Worth pf visitng because of various temples,3.0,,"Got here actually by an accident, this is a specific part of the city with ethnical minority and with specific architecture. I would say that Little India had a bigger wow effect one, but this place holds more temples, even from various religion, so it might be interesting from this point of view."
,,Ok but overrated,3.0,,Loved the visit but felt it was slightly overrated. Enjoyed the experience but no originality. Go to the market for the real Chinese experience. During New Year it is busy but fun.
,,Interesting,3.0,,"It is interesting to visit this side of the city that looks different from the rest of Singapore but besides buying cheap souvenirs, there is nothing more I could think of that you could do there."
,,vibrant and interesting,5.0,,"We were lucky to visit this area during Chinese New Year and found it busy, interesting and full of life. The food was great. It was easy to get to using Hop on Hop off bus . However the large supermarket, near the Tourist Office had a very fishy smelly and we had to come out fairly quickly."
,,Must go,5.0,,"Yes it’s touristy, yes it’s over priced, yes you will get harassed but yes you have to go! It’s a fab place to walk around for a few hours, Soak in the colors, the sites and sounds. Eat in any of the restaurants or the hawkers market! All totally worth it. Get the MRt there it puts you right out in the middle of china town!"
,,So clean and beautiful!,5.0,,A must visit when coming to Singapore! Must try the many food stands/restaurants. Plenty of shops. Parking is a nightmare.
,,What a pity !,2.0,,"This part of Singapore is not what it used to be in the past : it has turned into a huge tourist trap where foreigners can stock up on all kind of rubbish souvenirs ! The area is clean and safe , but has lost all of its authenticity ..."
,,Good place to shop and eat,4.0,,If you like a bargain - whether shopping or eating - then Chinatown is the place for you! There are a couple of food halls that you can check out (one of them has a Michelin star hawker stall and another was visited by Anthony Bourdain who highly rated the Hainanese chicken rice) and markets next to the temple.
,,Crazy Dirty Noisy Messy and great Hawkers,5.0,,Take a long walk around the many streets that make up the area of Chinatown. Lots of special deals and fresh fish.
,,Better than Malaysia,4.0,,"Nice, much better than Malaysia chinatown. Maxwell hawker centre right next to Chinatown. Also famous Hawker chan hawker stand in Chinatown"
,,very interesting,5.0,,lots to see and eat so if you love chines food it is for you and as it was chinese new year celebrations it was very prettily decorated too.
,,Fabric shopping,4.0,,Worth a visit to the people's park food centre to buy fabric. 2nd floor. Today the prices were S$8 or 12 per yard for 100percent cotton quilting weight.
,,Don't miss Food Street,5.0,,A must for an authentic dining experience in Singapore are the many stalls in Food Street - freshly cooked in front of you and something to suit everybody's palate at a reasonable price. The market stalls sell all kinds of quirky souvenirs and just the experience of the place is a not to be missed.
,,New Year!,5.0,,"We were here unexpectedly for Chinese new year, fab!...lots of lights/decorations up, street markets at night were an experience(a fab one), we found a little cafe with full hung ducks in the window and a fridge with 660ml beers for 4sgd! Amazing...think we paid about 7.50gbp each for a full duck/pancakes/cucumber/beer....just fab"
,,crowded,3.0,,"interesting to try different hawker food here but its not very clean and it tends to be extremely crowded especially on the weekends, worth seeing for sure"
,,A must for a night time visit,4.0,,Had the best Singapore curry at one of the restaurants. The culture is amazing. Gets busy at night time
,,Lunar new year,4.0,,"Great place for gaining the mood for the lunar new year. Can be quite crowded, try to go around 4pm to 7pm. After 7pm it get quite packed. Beware of pickpockets, very good place to buy lunar new yr deco! Many options available."

,,Jist for fun,5.0,,"Fantastic people watching from a bar on the main drags. Tonnes of food options and shopping value for everything from a simple dollar souvenir to thousands for antiquities. Checkout the People's Foodcourt. Singapore is a wonderful city and a favourite stopover. I love showing my friends the sights. They are necer disappointed. The cultural blends of Hindi, Buddhism and Christianity exist peacefully and hilariously side by side. Don't forget Mistafa's in Little India."
,,Well worth a visit!,5.0,,"Depending where you are staying in Singapore you can either walk here or travel via the MRT train system to Chinatown.
We visited here during the Chinese New Year so everything was very colourful with lots of red lanterns adorning buildings and walkways. Many shopping opportunities here as well."
,,Like every China Town,5.0,,"We were at the end of the Chinese New Year celebrations so everywhere was decorated so vibrantly. Being like every other China Town is not a criticism. I like the colours and sounds of China Town and the stalls selling their wares. Always good fun. In addition, there are beautiful temples to see and the architecture and craftsmanship is breathtaking. Well worth a few hours wandering around."

,,A Must See,5.0,,Chinatown in Singapore is a historical area with a lot of interesting temples to see and a vast array of different restaurants/hawker centers to try.
,,Great fun - great atmosphere,5.0,,"A wander down the main shopping street here is delightful. SO many shops and stalls selling Chinese souvenirs was interesting. At the end of the road we sent into a Buddhist Temple where a ceremony was taking place, so we stopped to watch and listen to the music. A good morning excursion."
,,Meal,3.0,,"We wanted an authentic Chinese meal and experience and our taxi driver dropped us on a side street...proved to be the wrong choice as the next taxi driver told us this area is just for tourists,. our meal was terrible, the service slap dash and the price extortinate.Avoid"
,,Must visit!,5.0,,"South Bridge Road is a must. Start at one end with the old goldsmith shop Tin SIng which retains much of its old world feel then work your way past the old medical halls, the furniture and Chinese souvenirs, Eu Yan Sang (established Medical Hall), Kim Joo Guan (barbecued pork slices), the pawnshop and stop to take a photo of Sr Mariamann Temple. At this mid-point, there is On Cheong, another old jewellery shop that has re-branded itself. The decor is soothing and inviting, the jewellery top notch and the staff a cut above. After that, continue walking to Mohammed Ali lane and take photos at the amusing murals. Finally, stop[ at Tong Heng, home of irrelstaibel Chinese pastries - ultra light egg custard tarts, curry puffs, wife cakes and sweet liquid desserts."
,,CHINA TOWN SINGPORE,3.0,,"The famous Buddha Temple has its own glory. Area is dominated by chinese people you see a lot of their culture in the area.
An old Hindu temple is just around the corner.

,,"Amazing experience, amazing food",5.0,,Wow!!! This place is full of people from all walks of life. The food street is amazing and alive. Cheap well priced food and drink driven but the crowds. A must visit.
,,What a fantastic experience.,5.0,,Fantastic to visit and do eat here. Frenetic and noisy but a great atmosphere and wonderful food at a great price. Crowded at weekends but worth the short wait for a table.
,,CNY shopping,4.0,,Great place to absorb the CNY atmosphere. Take the train to Chinatown station rather than drive given the difficulty in finding a car park.
,,Happy New year,5.0,,"A visit to China Town is an experience not to be missed, especially if you are looking for an authentic Chinese meal, and especially during the Chinese New Year celebrations. Avoid the large posh looking restaurants, and go to one of the small local restaurants, where Chinese is the only language spoken, and pointing to what you want is the only way to order. This is what we did, and the meal was amazing, and cost half the price of the larger restaurants.
A walk through the area afterwards is a must, as it is a mix of old and new, with lovely decorations across the streets, flowers growing from all the bridges, happy chatter all around, and people everywhere."
,,Just an overwhelming experience!,5.0,,"An unexpected chance to visit was a not to be missed experience. From the hundreds of small shops with souveniers of all descriptions, a choice of restaraunts and cafes and the Chinese temple. Amazing."
,,Hustle and bustle but very clean and organised,4.0,,"One of the places not to miss. Great place for souvenirs, street food and very affordable shopping. Buddha temple is stunning both outside and inside"
,,Clean? Past time!,3.0,,"Chinatown always was a little different and not to be compared with e.g., Orchard Road. However, cleanliness and no-smoking policy was exerted wherever possible. Nowadays, littering is the rule and, even worse, smoking - mainly among youngsters - became fashionable. Incredible amounts of cigarette butts can be found in the side streets - filled with smokers along the walls. Why isn't there any endorsement of the rules and the law?"
,,Cheap Shopping,5.0,,Great for inexpensive souvenior shopping. Whole array of goods to choose from. Many local Chinese restaurants. Best day to go is Saturday.
,,What is better than Chinatown on Chinese New Year!,5.0,,"If you don't mind the throngs of people celebrating the CNY, this is the place to be. Sort of like Times Square on the American New Year. We loved the culture and festivities as there were everyplace."
,,Great food and shopping,5.0,,"We love this area, Buddha tooth temple is a must and then plenty of cheap shopping and eats. Food street is slightly more expensive than the hawker centres but nice area to sit and eat and watch the work go by. Good place to pick up cheap souvenirs"
,,Such a colorful Chinese New Year,5.0,,"We were lucky to visit during the week of celebrations to welcome the year of the pig. A very colorful vibrant part of the city to stroll around, enjoy a variety of foods, gain an insight into Chinese culture in Singapore and soak up the ambiance. Lots of inexpensive souvenirs from the street vendors. Take the MRT to Chinatown station - it is definitely worth a visit."
,,Interesting Venue,5.0,,"Visiting Singapore would not be complete without a stroll down Smith Street, eating lunch/dinner and buying some stuff. However, do be aware, that the Singapore Chili Crab being offered at some restaurants isn't cheap."
,,So different than Malaysia,5.0,,"I love it ♥️ very clean and systematic,so different than Malaysia , but I visit it in the early morning to not be crowded"
,,Holiday in it's self,5.0,,"Foodies and shoppers sheer delight. We were lucky to be there during CNY so a lot of extra colour, latterns and good feel. Obviously the food is chinese based but a very good choice of restaurants offering freshly cooked snacks through to banquet meals."
,,Year of the Pig,5.0,,"We visited Chinatown at the new year of the Pig. Very vibrant and fun. Lots of markets, stalls and shops. Great."
,,Great Food,4.0,,"Our hotel was a 10 minute walk from Chinatown, although it does have its own MRT station. The lights for Chinese New Year were still up which added to the buzz. We ate on the food street from one of the many food vendors and it was very good, well worth a visit."
,,"Shopping, Eating, and Sightseeing",5.0,,It's the place for local and tourist. I think everyone will enjoy the place a lot. Here got many restaurants and small-unique shop for you to explore. Enjoy~
,,Chinatown - flavourful but touristic,4.0,,"Chinatown had seen much changes over the years. It still maintains their regular old traditional shops in pockets of its streets . However the main streets are filled with touristic shops which dilutes it's character.
Generally it's a still a great place for local delights and Chinese food."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"We went the week before the Chinese New Year celebrations. We went around 7ish. The atmosphere was electric. For the Year of the Pig... they were everywhere. Chinese lanterns, fortune cookies and boxed presents. The Street food is so interesting. There was such a buzz around the whole place."
,,Singapores Own Chinatown,5.0,,Bought some beautiful jade and fun souvenirs in Chinatown along with a few edible delights. People sell there wares in the streets & in a market. A must-see when in Singapore
,,Vacation,4.0,,"We went to Chinatown during Chinese New Year, it was so colorful. So many goodies to buy and food to try. A must when visiting Singapore. Visited the temple, oh it was so beautiful at this time and festive. They really take pride in the New Year, it was great."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,This is a great place to wander around. Even if you don't want to buy anything go and soak up the atmosphere. We were there during the New Year festivities and the place was a sea of vibrant red decorations.
,,Chinatown is really amazing and a shopping paradise,5.0,,Take the subway MRT to Chinatown and you are just in the middle of a different world. I like the market and all the colourful shops. Bargaining at its best! Try a durian fruit - it smells terrible but its taste is good. Last but not least: do not miss the beautiful temple ant its interior - just overwhelming!
,,When during Chinese New Year celebratations,5.0,,When the Chinese are happy they love to show and discounts and 'lucky' wishes and NY discounts abound. Ton of fun and well worth a visit

,,Shopping shopping,5.0,,There are lots and lots and lots of shops in Chinatown. I guess if you want a bargain it will be here somewhere. From red lanterns to chopsticks to currency to.. you name it!
,,CHINA town not your local chinatown.,4.0,,too many china stuffs unless you want to bring back. Too many China's stalls selling their own local dishes... if you want real local food go to Smith street where there is a local food centre there. Give stalls along the road a miss if you want Real Sg local food.
,,Still authentic,5.0,,I've been to Chinatown three times over the past 40 years and it is still authentic. There is tourism of course but you will see plenty of locals. We were there during a food festival where we tried all sorts of local delights. The Buddhist Tooth Relic Museum and the Market are interesting and must sees. There are cheap souvenirs for sale. A fun place to wander around.
,,"Sight-seeing, Shopping and Eating",4.0,,There are lots of interesting small shops and stalls to explore... lots of food options too. Do come in comfortable walking shoes and stay hydrated as there is quite a bit of outdoor walking.
,,A place worth visiting for tourists,5.0,,"Chinatown has her charm, even in modern developed country like Singapore because she retains some facets of tradition in terms of building architecture, streets and food. A tourist can spend half a day here and I always bring visitors on such a itinerary as below.

First, start off the day with a Michelin star hawker lunch at Liao Fan Hawker Chan (78 Smith Street). Go at 10:30am when they open so that you don't have to queue and wait up to one hour for your food.

Next, turn left when you leave the restaurant and roam the streets for souvenirs. Remember to buy some Merlion themed souvenirs since they are unique to Singapore.

Visit a museum or temple in Chinatown to see for yourself how Singapore was like in the 1960's.

Finally sit down either in Yum Cha restaurant for traditional dim sum or one of the many seafood open air restaurants and reward yourself with chilled Tiger beer."
,,A feast for the eyes!,5.0,,"A maze of colour, smells and tastes. Just wander around taking it all in! You can haggle with stallholders, enjoy the food choices and enjoy the hubbub! You can feel safe here both by day and night."
,,Great Place for Cheap Shopping,4.0,,A flea market of Singapore. You can find the best souvenirs that you can buy for a cheap deal. With the bit of chinese decorations and shops. This place will definitely won't disappoint you.
,,Wish I stayed in Chinatown,4.0,,"In my week-long stay in Singapore, I was billeted first at a hostel in the red light district, then moved to a hotel in Changi.

Roaming around and meeting fellow tourists, I found out that I should've just stayed in Chinatown, for every thing I could possibly crave/long for is there - coffee shops, cheap meals, Instagram-worthy places.

I was also able to go to a gay bar called Tantric, and really had fun with the people there. They offered me cigarettes and drinks, and we just danced the night away.

Overall, a 4/5 for me. Would most likely stay there for when I come back sometime in the future."
,,Chinatown Night Walk before the Chinese New Year Festival 2019,5.0,,Been awhile since I last visited Chinatown just before Chinese New Year. I am happy to say the festive mood is still there in spades. Highly recommended for travellers to visit the place to soak in the vibes. Good places to take instagramable photos with the conservation shophouses in the foreground and the skyscrapers in the background.
,,Not very interesting China town,1.0,,So many cities have great China towns with excellent restaurants and shopping but this is not one of them.
,,Chinese Chic,4.0,,"It's quite a large ""Old market"" style precinct. Wander around and visit a wide range of collectables, clothing stores and eateries. Why not try some Durian while you are there??? Not as bad as it's reputation suggests Yum!! Or if that is not your style try some freshly opened whole coconut. The place has a nice vibe to it and retains much of its historical character."
,,Great food and atmosphere,3.0,,"We went at night time and this area is lighted up, there are lots of delicious foods, and lots of souvenirs that you can buy for your friends back home"
,,The Chinese Heritage Museum,5.0,,"This is well worth a visit. It describes the arrival of the Chinese from mainland China, how they lived, their problems, employment and also how many became exploited. There are replicas of houses belonging to different types of family and a realistic audio description of their lifestyle."
,,Food street China town,5.0,,Great place to find local food and great old chinese style ambience. Nostalgic food and place. Recommedn to try food example char kway teow or Fried carrot cake (white) or friend rice seafood . its a street food place.
,,Best place to Buy Souvenirs,4.0,,We casually went there to explore through Singapore MRT and it was a great decision. You can see a lot of Chinese sellers and food and Lot more iteams to buy at best price as souvenirs. The market is quite big with lots of sellers only problem is If you vegeterian than you better go with some meal as you won't get Best Veg meal there. I would love to visit this place again!!
,,Varieties of Chinese food and decor,4.0,,Pretty interesting place to shop for Chinese decor and varieties of Chinese eateries. Be prepared to stand in lines for tasty food. Shops generally accept net flash cards. Multi language speaking staff. The street stores are not accessibility friendly as there are steps into the stores & walkways are uneven.
,,The week before Chinese New Year,4.0,,"The little shopping streets of China Town were packed with people, but this made the atmosphere even better.
Very nice decoration for the holiday period, nice buildings. Maybe a little too much of the same type of souvenier shops.
A nice neighbourhood, and a must visit."
,,Visit the Food Market,4.0,,We went to Chinatown during their New Year celebrations. Plenty of different food stalls and drink stalls to choose from and the food is very reasonable. We paid 18 Singapore dollars for 2 meals and the drinks are a lot cheaper as well. If we were staying any longer we word have gone back.
,,crazy during the New Year's celebration,4.0,,"I was down here before the actual New Years, but the celebration was the same, lots of happy people! Having been to several China towns across SE Asia, I enjoyed this one."

,,Chinese New Year,5.0,,"What better time to visit than for Chinese New Year. Unless you can’t handle crowds that is.

Every Chinatown is different, but Singapore has a really honest, authentic and dynamic feel.

Being here before and durning Chinese New Year is pretty special and today, the day after the new year, it is still an exciting place to be.

Great food, safe & bustling. There is an active Chinatown Association and together with the traders and the government, they ensure that this is one of the premier destinations in Singapore."
,,Lunar New Year,5.0,,"Luckily, we were there when they were getting ready for lunar new year. You can find almost any kind of Asian food and everything dried that you can possibly imagine. Lots of trinkets, clothing, etc. Crowded and hang onto your belongings. Be sure to visit the Hawker stands."
,,What an experience!,5.0,,"Wall to wall people and colour! We visited at the end of January and things were in full swing for the New Year's celebrations on Feb. 5th. Almost impossible to describe, you need to experience it for yourself."
,,Incredible Chinese experience!,5.0,,"I've been to Chinatown in London, and Montreal, and San Francisco - but this one is the absolute superlative. Huge, overwhelming - sights, sounds and smells. Just incredible, and the indoor covered market has an authentic feel like no other. Strongly recommended if in Singapore!"
,,If you like the crowds and food and shopping,5.0,,We went just before CNY. Transport was via the MRT. Fascinating walk amongst all the street stalls selling CNY decorations and foodstuff. Lots of people and was just interesting to mingle and take photos. Visit the Chinatown complex food centre for dirt cheap food.
,,Chinese new year walkabout,5.0,,"It was warm as expected but its good fun. Lots to see, eat and experience. It is rather touristy but the architecture and ambience is unique to Singapore. Worth a trip even on non festive days."
,,"Chinatown, Singapore",4.0,,"During the Chinese New Year, it is a very interesting place to visit. You will be able to watch lion dance and dragon dance performances at times. Some of the roads are closed for display of all kinds of new year goodies. There is also a Heritage Museum depicting Singapore in its early days."
,,A short walk (well for us) from the Park Hotel,5.0,,Chinatown at night is bustling and full of little shops selling cheap souvenirs. Plenty of eating places as well. It was Chinese New Year when we went so there were extensive decorations to see and all lit up at night. Worth a visit.
,,Chinese New Year 🧧,4.0,,"Great streets selling everything from drinks to food to bags and history, follow the signs that tell you about the workers during the 1940s and about the different communities that lived in Singapore like the Chinese community. Really worth a look but beware of the Dorian fruit it does smell. Try a coconut drink from one of the stalls."
,,Stopover in Singapore,4.0,,Must see and experience for those visiting Singapore. The area is vibrant with restaurants cafes and souvenir shops all at reasonable prices. We visited on the build up to Chinese New Year so the area was even more spectacular with all the extra decorations for the year of the pig.
,,Chinese new year,5.0,,Experience the festive mood of chinese new year. A must go if you are in singapore this time. Be prepared for crowds.

,,Stayed in Chinatown and it is all dressed up for the Year of the Pig,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore and staying downtown, I think it is worth a visit. We were staying in Mosque St right in Chinatown and the eating options, the energy, the friendliness, just brilliant."
,,Best place to soak in the Chinese New Year atmosphere,4.0,,"Like most Chinatown's in the world, this is a place where they preserve the heritage of the original Chinese immigrants to Singapore.

Shop houses have been kept in its original architecture and design, albeit refurbished to give it a more appealing facade.

You will find of plenty of popular Singapore food options in this area. If you are looking to try the famous BBQ meats (aka beef/pork jerky), this is the place to be as all the famous brands such as Lim Chee Guan, Bee Cheng Hiang and Fragrance are here.

Chinese New Year is the best time to visit this place as you can truly feel the festive mood in the air here.

Come in light clothing as it can get very stuffy with so many people congregated here."
,,Make sure you include a trip to Chinatown when in Singapore.,5.0,,"Lots of fabulous little shops and plenty of places to eat a variety of foods. Lots of Chines products for sale and easy to stock up on items to help celebrate the Lunar New Year. There are well established businesses such as Yue Hwa and the Chinese Heritage Centre is worth a visit. Can be busy and noisy, but that is what makes the area fun to visit."
,,A Weekend in Singapore,5.0,,Fantastic Chinatown area very busy from 11am and featuring the year of the Pig displayed for Lunar New Year Food stalls in all areas and very bust at nightfall
,,Great Shopping and Find Dining Experience,5.0,,"Like many other Chinatowns around the world, this one doesn't disappoint! We have come to expect nothing less than great shopping and culinary experience. The streetside stalls are cheap in price but not cheap in quality, foreign exchange shops are plentiful and rates are competitive; and food, yes, food is wonderful."
,,Great food,5.0,,"My wife, who is Chinese, found a great restaurant in Chinatown to complete our visit to this part of the city."

,,Too rowdy,3.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is a lot cleaner than any other Chinatowns I’ve been. But it is still too rowdy. Too crowded too. I only went to see the buddhist temple and sri mariamman temple. There are also probably a few more alleys with wall covered in art, aside from that I don’t think there are others to do. Items at shops are expensive so don’t shop here."
,,Holiday,5.0,,Fantastic loved it plenty to see and do spent 9 hours on here and still didn't get round it all but got all my presents there brill day
,,Some pig festival,4.0,,So many people so much colour . Vendors out in force selling festival stuff and other Chinese delicacies. Just a little overwhelming. A little more research would have been a win.
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,We visited Chinatown on two occasions to have lunch and walk around the markets. The Maxwell hawker centre was the best place to eat although busy. The food is very cheap compared to bars and cafes nearby. The area is a visual treat with the Chinese New Year celebrations and there are numerous market stalls to see. Well worth haggling for a bargain.

,,Great experience,4.0,,"Thoroughly enjoyed my visit to China Town. I used the hop on, hop off bus to get there and back as it stopped outside my hotel. Loved the markets and bought very, very cheap Singapore soveniers there. I had a massage whilst I was there as it was cheaper than what I had seen around. It gets particularly busy so be prepared for the crowds. Certainly a worthwhile visit even if only for the cheap soveniers."

Lots of street food options are available. One can buy souvenirs and gifts for friends for a steal. Bargaining is a must."
,,Great atmosphere but too much hassling.,3.0,,"Very busy, very noisy. Lots of shops selling the same things. Be wary of entering the jewellery shops - for us the hassling by at least 2 staff was endless and prices decreased by 75% in minutes! It wore us down so much we left."

,,Is time to revamp and evolve!,3.0,,"We seldom go to Chinatown nowadays because we find that all the things there like ""see once see all"". Nothing really attractive and also we realised that the shops are closing quite early... Thank goodness there are still some nice F & B restaurants to hold us back..."
,,Great atmosphere!,5.0,,Definitely worth a visit whilst in Singapore. Great stalls and restaurants. Lots of atmosphere. Fun cheap shopping.
,,Shoppers paradise!,5.0,,"It's clean and tidy. Everything is where it should be and accessible from all parts of Singapore. This is the best place to buy anything and everything. Rates are mostly fixed but bargaining is your right, so go ahead and enjoy the day here.
There are many places to eat all over and we managed to fill bags over bags of goodies. Multiple options for 10 dollars... And many such offers are irresistible.
It's a must in your Singapore itinerary.
Do visit the Chinese temple. It's well kept and has a very soothing atmosphere inside.."
,,Great atmosphere,5.0,,"We spent an evening here and the place was bustling with people on the move and others eating in umpteen restaurants. The food was lovely too, with big portions being served. Highly recommend a visit here"
,,Restaurant Manchuria Chinatown Singapore,5.0,,"Great find!! On a bustling Saturday night 2 weeks before Chinese New Year we stumbled across this little hotbed of excitement. From the gregarious doorman to the shouting staff and patrons, this was a wild ride.. but a great one. Sensational Chilli crab (the sweetest but least chilli we had), great sweet and sour chicken and sensational “old school” flavoured vegetable fried rice knocked back with a few Tigers for about $100 SD. Highly recommended ... just go with the flow!!!"
,,A bit tacky,3.0,,Worth a visit but found it a bit tacky. Still I am pleased we visited. Some overpriced restaurants and souvenir shops. Found a great hawker centre though.
,,Gearing up for Chinese New Year,4.0,,"Visited on a weekend morning. Stalls are being refurbished which make it looks much neater, more spaces and well sheltered. Worth taking a stroll at night."
,,A Lot to Offer,5.0,,"Singapore Chinatown has markets, merchandise and amusements to satisfy your need for Chinese food, culture and more. WE had a great time with the merchants, food stalls and restaurants. Interesting Buddhist and Hindu temples in the area. New and Old Chinese goods. Easy to navigate and worth the visit. So much to enjoy in Singapore. Don't miss Hunan Chicken and other recommended specialties. Some amazing dim sum in the area."
,,Usual,4.0,,Nice place to while away a couple of hours but if you are short on time and you 3 seen a china town before then you can easily give this one a miss.
,,Heritage place,4.0,,"China town is a popular district in Singapore. We found there unique Chinese heritage and culture. It is the largest historic district in Singapore. There are shop houses – meaning shops which double up as homes for the merchants too. These traditional shop houses have fine silk, gold and jade jewelry and traditional handicrafts for sale. In Chinese emporium Yue Hwa, one can buy some authentic Chinese products like Chinese costumes, medicinal herbs, household goods and antiques. Other places of interest here are Chinatown Complex, People’s Park Complex, Chinatown Point, Buddha tooth relic temple, A Hindu temple, a mosque, and Graffiti on the walls."
,,Must visit place,5.0,,"We visited China Town during our City Tour. Apart from visiting the Chinese temple, which was beautiful, we also explored the chinese outlets and found that the artifacts being sold were reasonably priced."
,,A Surprising Walk,5.0,,"The first time I stepped foot in Singapore last 2014, I did not make my way to Chinatown as I was pre-occupied with the major tourist destinations. For this business trip, I had half a day to go sight seeing, and since Chinatown was just less than a 10 minute walk away,

The planner in me, of course, had already plotted my way through Chinatown. There was also no better way to see Chinatown aside from walking, so that you can soak up the culture and the architecture.

I found myself starting my journey to the Thian Hok Heng Temple (Taoist temple), then making my way to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple (Buddhist), and not far from it was the Sri Mariamman Temple (Hindu).

Aside from the temples, I enjoyed seeing the Chinese lanterns all put up along the streets since Chinese New Year is coming up soon. No Chinatown trip is complete without immersing yourself in the Maxwell Hawker Center -- home to Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice (which has a Michellin Star btw).

The architecture along the buildings and stores in Chinatown were also very picturesque. My camera roll ended up full of pictures of the temples and buildings that I passed by."
,,great attmosphere,5.0,,"There are two Chinatowns one for us tourist and a great place to get some food, drinks and souvenir's. Then go across the main road to the other Chinatown where the locals go, it is much more interesting and food is cheaper"
,,A must do in Singapore,4.0,,Probably my 5th visit but it is hard not to tire of this bustling and interesting place - on the MRT head for Chinatown Station - an exit will take you into the main street - consider if you are 3 or more a taxi for door to door aircon transport at a similar cost - Chinatown is a collection of streets with countless shops selling souvenirs and Chinese orientated products and a number of food outlets with some really delicious offerings - there is even a food street - the Heritage Museum is an interesting excursion on your left in the 'main street' also look above the commercial shops and see the original shop houses that make up a backdrop -and if you make it to the other end take in the Buddhist Tooth Relic Temple - we were there on New Years day and there was a service in progress which added extra interest - there is optimal shade so go prepared - you can easily spend a couple of hours here dependent on what is going on and if you stop for a lunch and a welcome cold beer.
,,Rich in Heritage for the Chinese People of Singapore,4.0,,"The best time to visit Chinatown will be near the chinese new year season, which is typically in the month of January / Feb. The govt heavily invests in decorating the place up with many different themed lights depending which zodiac year it is. The streets will be bustling with many tourist buys and good food! A favourite haunt of mine would be ""Fatty Weng Restaurant"" at Smith Street that serves really authentic and delicious chinese food. There is a separate menu which only the regulars will know to order from. Do ask them what are their recommendations that are not found in the menu, you wouldn't be disappointed.

There are many budget hotels/hostels around the area for the budget guests too and because of its convenience to the MRT (train system) it is easy to get abouts."
,,Very organized Chinatown,5.0,,All the shops are so organized and clean. The vendors do not put a pressure. The Chinatown street food restaurants are good.
,,Fascinating place,5.0,,Well worth a visit. Lots of interesting shops and restaurants. We visited in the day but I would imagine that the place comes alive in the evening.
,,Great to visit,5.0,,Definitely a place to see I would say for souvenirs and spend sometime around. Very colorful environment during both day & night.
,,Another Chinatown,3.0,,"I must say after visiting many China towns around the world unless you want to buy cheap Chinese things in markets or are searching for a Chinese product it is not a must do. If you are limited for time in Singapore do Gardens by the Bay, Battle box, Marina Bay or have an amazing meal. Food I had was nothing special. The most interesting thing was they were decorating for Chinese New Year and there were pigs everywhere!"
,,Worth a visit!,4.0,,"Travelling way back from Sentosa Island on the purple MRT line we decided to stop off at Chinatown and were very pleased that we made the decision.

Chinatown is very much an area for tourists, if you like seeing market stalls offering a variety of gifts then you might like to visit. We called by to a bar, sat and watched the world go by. It felt very safe and a good place to pick up gifts. We travelled in December and managed to buy a decoration for our tree! It was near the end of our holiday and we were short of Singapore Dollars - not a problem as there were places to exchange money too.

Worth a look if you are nearby!"
,,"Vibrant, friendly",5.0,,"We loved this part of town, particularly as it is in the run up to Chinese New Year. It was lively and welcoming. We visited"
,,Lots of fun,5.0,,Our hotel was close to Chinatown so we walked there a lot. The food was very good at the several different places we ate we had lots of fun.
,,Standard Commercial Chinatown,3.0,,"Spent part of today walking Chinatown. All the expected stores were there... restaurants and their hawkers, fruit stands, trinkets and trash, 7-11’s, cute little dessert shops and plenty of people.
Looks to be mainly a tourist area as opposed to locals like Bangkok or Hanoi or other major SE Asia larger cities.
Dozen small streets but not the flavor of other places."
,,Great atmosphere,5.0,,"I read and heard that you had to experience the food in Smith Street so we did. It was a difficult decision on what to have, so many choices. Great atmosphere with historic buildings"
,,Visit the temple,4.0,,"Very similar to most China Towns, but especially interesting at the moment in the run up to the Chinese New Year. A visit to the Chinese temple is a must. It has worshipping areas for Buddhism, Taoism and Confuscianism, and a fascinating ""memorial"" area."
,,Chinatown Like everywhere,3.0,,"Chinatown is a visiting place for tourists but we have no interest because Chinatown is same world wide in many countries, I have visited Chinatown in many countries like in many cities of USA, Dubai, Sydney etc. So nothing new found here. Tourists visit it because of Chinese shopping places which are very economical. There are Chinese restaurants also which attracts tourists."
,,A great experience,5.0,,"As most China towns, always worth a visit and always very interesting. Great foods and different articles to purchase."
,,A great experience,5.0,,"Our family group visited in the evening. The MRT stop brings you right into the bustling heart of China town. We had a wonderful time shopping, dining and sightseeing."
,,Pretty uninteresting,2.0,,"We had a good walk around and found it to be a grotty and uninteresting place. I wouldn't eat at any food stalls and all the shops were selling junk, couldn't wait to leave"
,,Good place for shopping,4.0,,If you want to do shopping at affordable rates then this is the place. You get varied options to buy from. This is big market place and also have options for foodies. The metro station is located very close by hence travelling is also very easy.
,,A must visit,5.0,,"Great colours and smells of little China, food good too. Souvenirs, clothing and fruit can be bought all reasonable prices."
,,"Bustling with locals, sightseers, diners & more",4.0,,"This is one of the world’s oldest and most vibrant Chinatowns. Its origins pre-date 1330. Live seafood and other creatures (or should I say future food) are sold here, including fish, frogs, turtles, crabs, clams, cockles, lobsters, shrimp, large prawns, eels, snakes, and more. Walk down Pagoda Street, which is home to shops selling all kinds of goods and visit the Chinatown Heritage Centre and learn about the early Chinese settlers, and their life in and contribution to Singapore over the years. Most of the existing buildings and architecture date back to the 1820 to 1929 period."
,,Great shopping & great food!! 😍,5.0,,You must go to Chinatown for the shopping! Everything is soooo cheap & you will find everything & anything there! And the food is very very good!
,,"Nice experience , read the plates on history",4.0,,"Different from „other chinatowns“, there are refurbished buildings and a lot of shops
With tourist orientated stuff, merchants are generally friendly and the food street offers a nice and clean atmoshere. It is nice to stroll around, take advantage of the heritage center which will give you information if you need it. Easy reach by Chinatown MRT Stop."
,,Visiting after several years,3.0,,Very disappointing as most stalls were closed. Spent 45 mins there and was done. Surrounding places were also boring.
,,Great Day,5.0,,"Caught the train here from the Promenade station near the Pan Pacific and had an awesome day. Grazing at various little food stalls whilst looking at shops and temple sites. It’s of colour and life, a very relaxing day. It would be beautiful at night"
,,Great shopping bargains,5.0,,Walking distance to our hotel bencoolen Great bargains for souvenirs and perfumes Delicious fresh fruit cups many food choices Variety Chinese ornaments Close to MRT station Delicious ice cream sold in bread a must to try from ice cream kart man
,,Street art at Chinatown - venture off the Main Street to the side alley,4.0,,"If you had been to the main part of Chinatown or if you wish to go there but not in the mood to shop, but just wish to explore the area at your own time in a leisurely pace, then I will suggest that you start at Mohamed Ali Lane, off South Bridge Road.

Mohamed Ali Lane is a narrow alley just diagonally opposite the famous Sri Mariamman Temple. Have a look at the street art, then follow the alley and walk towards Club Street.

The best time to go is in the late afternoon when it is not too hot. Walk up Club Street and look up some of the old buildings with a rich history."
,,Everything you might expect in Chinatown,5.0,,Lots of shops selling about everything. A good place for souvenir and a reasonable place to get something to eat at many of the restaurant stands. There are lots of touts and hawkers and usually they will stop when you tell them no thanks.
,,A ture chinatown indeed.....,5.0,,"We travelled here during our visit in Singapore. There are lots of shops , restaurants with lots of buying and eating options. A very famous temple are just a few mins walk from here."
,,China Town fun,4.0,,"We enjoyed looking around China town and the Buddha Tooth relic temple. The buildings, the murals, the lanterns, the stalls, soaking up the atmosphere. Also loved the cafes and bars nearby in Club Street, the area had a groovy feel about it."
,,Feels gentrified,4.0,,"Going to Chinatown could not be easier. The ever efficient MRT has an exit literally feeding you right into the main shopping street. However, that main Street feels too clean, commercial and gentrified. There are more interesting stuff happening on the side streets. Go explore and go off the beaten track."
,,Not all things are cheap,2.0,,"For those travelling in this area, take note not all are value for money. Probably you find it cheap but probably compare to one to two stations away, you can get the same item 30 to 40% cheaper. It really depending on items. Be a smart shopper and not fallen prey into evil cost."
,,Culture - Love China town,4.0,,"Lots of Food, nick naks and locals. Just watch the steps and uneven footpaths, i had a bad fall here."
,,Eat with the locals!,4.0,,Touristy? You bet! But it has a unique array of shops among colonial buildings not found anywhere else in the country. Try the food in the streets and in the restaurants if you want... my advice? Don't waste your money. They are decent food but comes with a hefty tourist premium. Instead... go to nearby Chinatown Complex Food Centre... google it. The complex is very close and the food centre is at the 2nd floor... 1st floor is just a morning market and shops... so not many tourist will know this. But if you get there.... you will be rewarded with well over 100 stalls of delicious and cheap local food! It is an experience on its own. You won't regret going there when you are in Chinatown... and eat with the locals.
,,chinatown point shopping centre,4.0,,Daisho in this complex is big and lots of gadgets to buy for sgd2 per item. I bought a useful pocket led bright torchlight with zoom lens and a fully adjustable length belt. Lots of reasonable price shops and eateries but no upmarket luxury brands.
,,A must in Singapore,5.0,,"Don't miss China Town , its really a wonderful experience , besides all the unique Chinese sights, you will also find some of the best international restaurants and bars in the streets around . Great time to visit is clearly Chinese New Year in February"
,,Shopping and a nice meal,4.0,,"Visited the night market and had a nice meal, looked good when it got dark and all the chinese lanterns had lit up. great place to stop and buy some souvenirs"
,,Tourists Area,3.0,,Chinese New Year is less than 30 days from now Chinatown is the place for sporeans to visit and of course tourist get to feel the atmosphere in Chinatown. Lot of items to choose from whether is to decorate home or just a souvenirs to bring back home.
,,Great food and drinks.,4.0,,China town can always amaze you with its food and drinks. You have options to drink beer as cheap as 5 dollars or spend 5000 dollars on a whiskey bottle at Olde Cuban. China Town is a must visit while visiting Singapore.
,,Fun,4.0,,"Very vibrant place. Lots of stalls , shops and restaurants to go to. Had better Chinese food in the states but you can’t duplicate the atmosphere. One of the must stops."
,,Walking around.,4.0,,If you guys enjoy Chinese flea markets so you can go and walk around and maybe buy some goods. Otherwise is just another street market nothing really special. Again is always nice to see and experience.
,,Good food and good foot massage,5.0,,"When you get out at the MRT station you`ll find one of the many interesting food courts of Singapore. And on the second floor you`ll find some massage stalls where you can get an foot massage for a good price to continue exploring whole Chinatown, Little India, Marina Bay area, the famous Botanic Garden ..."
,,Just wander....and probably wonder!,5.0,,"Spent several hours wandering round Chinatown, exploring the colourful goods, clothes, souvenirs, interesting buildings including temples. However the most impressive were the various hawkers offerings of food. The Maxwell food court was clearly the place to try to Singapore chicken rice judging by the long queues, but there are other interesting food areas selling a wide range of dishes and drinks throughout Chinatown. The ones we tried were incredible value for money, understandably it is packed at lunchtimes. Make sure you don’t sit at a table if there is a pack of tissues on it, as that it how people reserve the table whilst they queue at the various stalls. (We learnt this the hard way!)
We also enjoyed watching the preparations for the Chinese New Year, with dozens of pigs (fortunately plastic!) being wired up as illuminated decorations. Just a pity we aren’t there for the actual festivities in February."
,,Nice visit,5.0,,"Very nice place to visit with a lot a shops and good prices, really worth it, there are also places to eat something."
,,"Beware of DG Electronics, Chinatown",1.0,,"I visited DG Electronics, 52 Pagoda St Singapore and bought 2 camera batteries, one for a canon and another for a sony camera. I was served by Paul who sold me a brand called 'Pro' (NP-FW50 and LP-ESN). Pro NP-FW50 is purported to have 5000mAh and Pro LP-E6N 6000mAh and both batteries are said to be made in Japan. I stupidly took what Paul said on face value and having paid for the batteries, I investigated them on the internet and sought advice from another very large camera store. The batteries 'Pro' are not on the internet and are in fact a rubbish replica of 'Pro Master' from China. The cover on the actual battery is a very close replica of Pro Master batteries, but a deception. I returned to the store and requested a refund. Paul refused a refund but said he would exchange them. For what? He would only exchange for the exact batteries I wanted to return! Beware of this shop. Do your homework before you agree to buy anything, especially when given 'a good deal if you buy today'. If Paul was aware the product was a cheap replica, he deceived me, gave false information and should have refunded my money. If by chance he didn't know it was a cheap replica, he has inadvertently sold me a false product and should return my money and then take it up with the supplier. I would certainly not return to this store and I would advise anyone entering this shop to beware."
,,Mini China,4.0,,"We had a few hours free, so took a MRT bus to China town about 15 min ride from our hotel. There were lot of shops selling souviners, great variety of food stuffs.
Beautiful decors of buildings and of course the the Buddha tooth relic temple are worth experiencing."
,,China town,5.0,,Worth a visit interesting experience lots to see with a little bartering a good place to collect a few souvenirs value for money
,,Sanitized Chinatown,4.0,,"It's Chinese alright, but not China. A lot of the shops and restaurants remind one of China, but still with Singapore prices, and without the grittiness of Chinese cities. Nice and usually decorated for holiday seasons."
,,"Great area to walk around, eat and shop.",4.0,,Great area to walk around and shop. Most people speak English. There is the original Singapore Mosque and an ancient Hindu Temple. We bought a wide-angle camera lense for a very competitive price. We enjoyed street food and the shopping.
,,"Many shops, restaurants and tourists",4.0,,"Iconic part of Singapore with many tourist traps. But prices aren't that bad. Many ok restaurants, some good ones. Interesting temples to see, nice overall atmosphere to just walk around and look around"
,,It would be a shame to miss Chinatown.......,4.0,,"There is plenty of history here, and no shortage of venues to find it. Packed with shops, and of course, restaurants, expect crowds and traffic. As with any Chinatown, you pretty much have to experience it on foot, (with a tourist map in your pocket!) but it is easy to access by MRT - either Chinatown or Telok Ayer stations."
,,Old Chinatown,5.0,,"We walked Chinatown on our first evening in singapore, we all enjoyed the variety of food and goods, it was an introduction to another culture for our grandchildren and they thought is amazing, people were friendly and we felt relaxed and safe"

,,Great street dood,4.0,,There is some amazing street dood in Chinatown. Great price and so nice. We brought a beer from another stall as they don’t seem to sell food and drinks together in the same stall.
,,Well worth a visit.,4.0,,"We visited Chinatown in Singapore and it was fantastic.
So much to look at, from souvenirs, jewellery, home wares and the food.
We went late morning to lunch time and it wasn’t too busy.
Everyone was friendly, and not haggled to buy when inside the shops.
The main food area had so much to choose from, we had the chicken kway teow which was a tasty dish.
Lunch only cost us $31.00 SGD for 4 dishes and drinks.
Our wallets were a lot lighter coming home as we bought heaps.
Would visit again and again if we had time."
,,Great place,5.0,,"We visited this place three different times. It is just interesting to walk around and see all the options they offer, from food to souvenirs. I think you have to go there at least once. It is easy to reach by public transport (there is a metro station)."
,,Shopping heaven,5.0,,Worth a half day visit. Grab your dollars and indulge yourself in a shopping spree in this marvellous place of singapore. Everythin from fancy choclates to ancient chinese articles and singapore souveniers.

,,Good Old Town,5.0,,"If u are looking for daily necessities, i suggest that China Town is the best.
Its located at the heart of Singapore, MRT interchange is at Chinatown station as well.

In addition, u can find all three famous Bak Kwa brands in"

,,Good food / street food,4.0,,You can order here all kinds of food and enjoy all different flavours. Nice friendly people. Sometimes crowded.
,,Good for trinkets,3.0,,I read on TA that the shopping was good here. However I felt like it was just like all china towns I have been to down to the clothing. If you need to buy some trinkets this is probably the place for it. Don’t miss the temple at the start of the shopping street.
,,Great place to explore with good Chinese food,5.0,,"Depending on what you fancy, it is a nice place to explore when in Singapore. As the name suggest, it’s Chinatown, so one will find a lot of Chinese food choices here.

Food suggestions:
People’s Park Hawker Center - gets crowded late morning onwards during weekends so be prepared to share your table.

Fragrance Bak Kua (barbecue pork slice) - they can pack it air tight in case you want to bring some home.

Sightseeing
In the evening, head up to the pedestrian bridge to get a good view of the street filled with vendors and light decors.

There is also a famous temple nearby which is a tourist spot. Around that vicinity, you will find a lot of souvenirs at very reasonable prices from keychains to t-shirts.

Do spare 2-3 hours to cover the area as there is quite a few things to see and most of all eateries."
,,A Must Visit,5.0,,I figure any Chinatown in most countries is always pretty good and interesting to visit. This one in Singapore did not disappoint and the architecture surrounding the many stalls and restaurants was beautiful and so many of the buildings have been restored.

,,"Small, but authentic.",3.0,,"I have been to Chinatowns on 4 continents. While Singapore’s Chinatown seemed on the small side (about 4 square blocks), it seemed a bit more authentic than most (maybe because there are a good number if Chinese in Singapore). You will find plenty of cheap knock knacks to buy, but there are also tailors and jewelers among the merchants. And the street food is some of the best anywhere."
,,Always fun to walk the streets,3.0,,"Singapore’s Chinatown is always a fun place for tourists to wander around and my wife and I went there specifically to by tourist tat - table runners, luggage tags and other cheap and not so cheap goods.

You can spend a good two hours browsing the shops and stalls and pick up some nice bargains and everyone is friendly. There is also a lovely Budda temple to visit just remember no hats,females to be covered,legs and shoulders ,clothing is supplied on site. Be adventurous with the food I tried a few types I have never had before and they were ok"

There are several street to walk and shop or eat. We also went to the Chinese Opera. It was just ok. On Saturday night at the plaza by the temple, there were many locals line dancing. Some of the ladies were very good and entertaining. There is also a very good Hawker at this location"
,,Not lively when it is not near Chinese New Year period.,3.0,,"The days leading to Chinese New Year with the night market is only the best time to visit and immerse with the energy. Other than that, you only bring foreign friends for photo taking and souvenirs purchase only.

You will not want to dine there when there are more affiardabke and great food elsewhere in Singapore."
,,Great walk in the old Singapore,5.0,,"This part on the city is well conserved and allows you to travel back a little in the history of Singapore. Enjoy the colored and well decorated houses. Visit the temple and the museum, b’very interesting and truly lively."

,,Good to visit,4.0,,It is my second time to visit Chinatown. It is a place worth to sightseeing. Too many shops and hawker centres located near Chinatown are. I prefer the place named “Chinatown Heritage centre. It is a knowledgeable and historical centre. You can know the history and the humanity of Singapore additionally.

,,So Cool,5.0,,"I love Chinatowns, & this was one was great. First, it was HUGE. I was only in town for a couple days, but I could have spent a week exploring all the nooks & crannies of this place.

It was also, unsurprisingly, cheap. It was a great destination to find affordable food & souvenirs while in a VERY expensive city."
,,From a California Girl's Perspective - not San Francisco!,3.0,,"Not exactly like SF but it's close....lots of places to eat, lots of things to buy, lots to see. Is it a must see? Yes...never been to China Town in a big city.... yes. GO!! Enjoy the experience."
,,Lots of History,4.0,,"From the surface, all you see is lots of stores that sell souvenirs to tourists and restaurants. But there is a lot of history of Singapore started in this part of town. The best way to find out is to join a walking tour."
,,Great visit.,5.0,,"Great visit. Take the HOHO bus for easy transportation and get off at any China Town stop. Tons of shops and lots of really good neighborhood restaurants. Great place to find BARGAINS of all kinds, and, really good knock off's galore.Clean and safe, but always crowded, so do not go if your in a hurry....."
,,Fun and tasty,5.0,,"Chinatown was all one would hope for...plenty of shops, food outlets, and decorated buildings. Ahhhh, the aromas! There's lots of great choices in the hawker. Dim sum in Yum Cha was a huge hit! Chinatown was bustling both times we visited."
,,Cool,5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is a great area to visit, very authentic. Food was amazing and everything was very clean."
,,something missing,4.0,,something is missing. i feel that the charm of the old buildings is lost with the seating areas that they have built at all the restaurants on some of the streets. metal permanent tents does not match into the theme. just my opinion. it is still vibrant lots of shops lots of little places to eat and worth the trip
,,Find a local who can tell you how to get out of the Metro Station!,3.0,,"It's Chinatown, nothing more, nothing less. We went for the hawker center at the Chinatown complex to try the famed chicken-rice. It must be an acquired taste - nothing special at all. I did find however, two beautiful and inexpensive pairs of silk pajamas. I'm treasuring them!"
,,Great Buzz,4.0,,"A must visit during a trip to Singapore. Great colour and atmosphere, the amount of different shops and restaurants is amazing. Take time to stroll and take in this very special quarter of Singapore. Have a tiger beer and eat in one of the many eateries. Well worth a visit."
,,Visiting this tourist attraction,5.0,,"Travelling by bus then rail to this area of traders, if you need at clothing made up it can be done then & there or posted, vast selection of wonderful materials, inexpensive eating places & nice to see a good vegetarian selection at very affordable prices, we felt completely safe as two oldies shopping around."
,,Shopping hunt galore,5.0,,"An iconic place in Singapore rich in history and living culture. So easy to get to via the train even my teenage son loved the experience he kept going back during both our trips

There are shopping malls and centers on every turn. Prepare a good few hours.

There is also some beauty spas, massages in the complex. I enjoyed the back and foot massages upstairs. Highly recommended!

OG might look like not your plush shopping joint but we bought quality computer bags from them at bargain prices. Their kitchen gadgets are also well priced.

Chinese delicacies are available and more shops and eats underground. I loved the Japanese shops under the tunnel!

Don’t miss!"
,,Mostly food shops now,4.0,,"Seems to be undergoing some development. Many clothing and accessory shops gone since past visits, now mostly food. Good selection and interesting to visit but doesn’t have the appeal of a few years ago. Lacking atmosphere in my opinion.
May be better when the heritage centre development is done.
Worth a visit."
,,Nostalgic Singapore 🇸🇬,5.0,,"Chinatown- Chinese loves to people their things from this nostalgic place. Street Lanes, Food court, restaurants, Shopping Alleys, etc. Chinatown is the Busiest during Chinese Lunar New Bazaar Festive moods, Decorations, performance, haggling of prices, samples of snacks & Lunar New Year goodies."
,,Great Prices and friendly people!,5.0,,"We spent alot of time, bought alot of souvenirs and gifts, yet didn't spend an exorbitant amount of money...
Everyone was so friendly and polite. The husband and wife at the silk painting stall in particular were wonderful - he sits and paints whilst having a chat with the kids, really great!
The Chopstick shop is also a place to go - beautiful and so cheap."
,,The most amazing Hawker stalls in Chinatown Singapore!,5.0,,"I used 'With Locals' Guide Arthur (Look him up on the web site) to show me around Singapore, and the theme was about the food. Wow! When I came back to my hotel at the end of the tour I was exhausted. It was awesome!

So book with Arthur through ""With Locals' if you can. He really knows how to deliver a great experience.

At any rate, the walk through the Hawker stalls in Chinatown was World class. I got one of the dishes that is the pride of Singapore, Chicken Rice. It was sublime, and I almost had a 'Foodgasm'!

I would also recommend Little India with Arthur. Try to do it on a Sunday, as the crowd will be just like Calcutta or Delhi."
,,"Good people, food and drinks",5.0,,"You can find varieties of food at Smith street, and the souvenirs here are much cheaper and affordable compared to other places"
,,"Lovely sights, good for bargain shopping and gifts",4.0,,"Lovely historical part of Singapore. Its quite out of place, a colourful old town hidden amidst tall skyscrapers. Great place for bargain shopping."
,,Really cool scenery and shops,4.0,,This is a great place with a lot of shops and things to see. Not much different than Chinatown in NYC. I think coming here at night would be cool to see all the lights lit up
,,review,5.0,,awesome dinner very cheap and great drinks will come back again loved it awesome night good evening great
,,Colourful Festivities,5.0,,"I just happened to be in Singapore when 2 celebrations were on.
Chinatown was rife with fun activities along with the normal buzz expected around the food stalls and arts and craft displays.

I was tempted for a massage, and after a long flight it was welcomed and appreciated. The staff professional and caring.

I would Love to have been around for the follow up celebrations of Diwali 14 days later, as I learned the history of this story while in India on a Yoga training course."
,,Chinatown,5.0,,"Fantastic markets, a great selection of goods and food a must for anyone travelling to Singapore.It is easy to get there by public transport"
,,A Simple side to Singapore,5.0,,Chinatown is a bustling area of Singapore best enjoyed after dark when the streets come alive with vendors of every description. Restaurants are plentiful and the food is reasonably priced and good quality so don't feel reluctant to try the street fare. Enjoy...
,,Place for all tourists to visit & enjoy the local chinese cuisine!,4.0,,"This is an area that becomes especially busy during the Chinese New Year festivities. However, any given day, it has plenty to offer with many local things available. You can get tourist souveniors of Singapore here, lots of food, immerse in the chinese culture with some temples surrounding it.

There are a few notable good food in Chinatown - the famous soy sauce chicken that had a Michellin star - can be quite a long wait but the tender chicken awaits for those who have patience (the original stall is in the hawker center but the queue can be a few hours long). There are a few coffeeshops along Keong Saik street, just walking distance from the hawker that are very popular & I've seen plenty of tourists visit there for their yummy food - Kok Sen & Foong Kee Roasted meats are favourites of locals & tourists alike. If you like unagi (eel prepared Japanese style) - the best place is also along Keong Siak Road at ""Man Man Unagi""."
,,Exhibits local culture,3.0,,This place exhibits local culture especially the Chinese and Buddhist culture. A good choice if you are a first timer to Singapore.
,,Chinatown night walk dinner trickshaw and boat cruise,5.0,,Fantastic walk around the streets viewing the street food and stalls. Terrific 8 course dinner at traditional Chinese restaurant followed by a rickshaw ride to Clarke Quay amongst the oth are traffic. Then a cruise along the river at night with the lights and Christmas events going on. Back to Clarke Quay which really goes off at night
,,The shopping experience that all husbands dread,5.0,,"We deliberately went to Chinatown first thing on our first day and we were not disappointed. After about 5 stalls, we had enough for both of us to carry around with us the rest of the day. Fine artworks, lovely people, good prices (even better if you are reasonable at haggling). Even loved the run-in with the pushy-but savvy elderly Singaporean woman who invitingly shepherded us into her pub for a beer at lunch. Nice beer too after all the shopping. MUST DO."
,,See see look look,4.0,,Look for old stuff u can go to Chinatown u can find it but be careful the price check the price before u buy .not every shop is cheap some shop is expensive
,,Nice walking around area,4.0,,China Town covers a large area. Plenty of good restaurants and lots of cheap souvenirs. Suggest stroll around area and find a restaurant with lot of Chinese eating there which is a good indication of being authentic
,,A different side to Singapore.,5.0,,No visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to both Chinatown and Little India. These places are the real deal.
,,Great street food,5.0,,"Fantastic street food at great prices, lots of bargain shopping outdoor and indoor. Large range of nail bars in the indoor shopping area on the top floor"
,,The historic area is good for a general wander,4.0,,"The historic Chinatown is in the centre of Singapore.. lots of restored old colonial and local buildings and signs explaining the heritage. This part of Chinatown is worth walking around, absorbing the ambience of an age gone by. The area has been restored and so it is ultra clean and tidy which is probably not as authentic but makes for a nicer time.

The People's Park Shopping Centre is the old-fashioned traditional Chinese shopping centre.. selling touristy items, reflexology foot massages, inexpensive clothing and eateries.. not our thing but worth a look around.

The walk around Chinatown will take about an hour, depending on stops and shops."
,,Too many empty shops,4.0,,"I think it was under improvement and renovation, still a lot of empty shops in China town. Expect to have more to shop but we did not have much to buy, just few gift to our friends and family at home.

A chinese temple and indian temple are 2 landmarks which made China town a good place to visit."
,,Wandered around to kill some time,5.0,,"Took a wander around Chinatown for a couple of hours. Lots of side streets, alleys and little gems around every corner. Place was buzzing as sun set and eventually had done food and a beer and people watched for ages. Great experience and you wander around for ages and still not feel you had seen it all"
,,A Modern Chinatown,5.0,,"I still do nostalgic trips here, seeking small cafes or coffeeshop to people watch. There are still many old folks residing in the HDB blocks and this is part of its authenticity. Although a lot of old temples have been restored, the paintwork cannot hide its history. This area is a photographer's paradise. Come night, many food stalls open serving authentic local fare. It is also conveniently served by a fantastic transport system. Recommended not only for tourists but for locals."
,,"A ""Clean"" Chinatown",4.0,,Some Chinatowns have a bad reputation regarding cleanliness. This is a great Chinatown for food and shopping.
,,Day visit,5.0,,"WOW! What a wonderful vibrant place with fab shops and eateries it’s great, also there are the Indian and Chinese Temples which are very beautiful and emotional places to be able to sit and contemplate amongst this very busy and bustling area of Singapore. A must place to visit for great shopping bargains too."
,,A Must,4.0,,Can't come to Singapore without visiting Chinatown. You will probably want to dine here and you can certainly enjoy the ambience of the old Chinese quarter
,,Chimatown,5.0,,It was China's celebration of 50 years. The streets of Chinatown was electrifying with fireworks and food and celebrations. I totally enjoyed it in Chinatown Singapore.
,,Best time to visit China town in Singapore,4.0,,Best timing to visit this place is either early morning or late afternoon. Weekends will be interesting but it will be a lot of people there. Weekdays is good. The cheapest place in Singapore get foot massage. SGD$25/hr. Lots of nice and cheap food. And many souvenirs you can get there.
,,if you have time to spend this is the place,4.0,,"aside the aromas that are unique for all chinatowns around the world, you have a nice temple and rows of small and divers shopping items. food around here is for the chinese cuisine lovers (personaly not for me)"
,,Nice area,4.0,,"Chinatown similar to other cities worldwide. It's well worth a visit and has lots of shops offering cheap goods and souvenirs cheaper than elsewhere in Singapore. Lots of restaurants and we had good meal there. We went round in a Trishaw tour and would recommend this as a way of seeing if.
Lots of interesting buildings and history."
,,Little China town in a majority Chinese country,5.0,,Please don't get me wrong. I love Chinatown from the bottom of my heart! Especially that People's Park Complex building - the very first building I spent the night in this Lion city almost 6 years ago. I heard some people saying this yellow building will soon to be demolished due to aging - but I certainly hope not! Chinatown is a beautiful compact little town with tasty food. But most of the seller can only speak Chinese. My favorite is Rou Jia Mo (肉夹馍) from Dough Master.
,,I love Chinatown!,5.0,,"From the Chinese, Indian temples n Muslim mosque... to the heritage buildings n of course the food centre & wet market at Chinatown complex... there's always something interesting to see.
Do go Chinatown food center now as it will soon be closed for renovation (3-4months).. this food center has abundance of local food choices... n early morning wet market is always busy n lovely to watch ;)
Opposite Chinatown area is also People's Park Centre & Complex to explore ...cheap toiletries n local chinese desserts shops is one of my favorite!
A month prior Lunar / Chinese New Year .. Chinatown will have light ups following the yearly animal horoscope theme ;)"
,,Souvenir Shopping,4.0,,"One of the old areas of Singapore,connected well by MRT/Bus. Good place to buy souvenirs at bargain prices.Souvenir shops and boutiques dot the area, offering clothes, crafts and antiques, while Club Street is full of trendy wine bars. Food Street, has restaurants serving traditional fare like Hainanese chicken rice, noodles and satay.
Sri Mariamman Temple and the ornate Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum are quite nearby."
,,Must visit if in Singapore,4.0,,"It's a shopper's paradise.

You get excellent Chinese artifacts (fans, chinese pottery, calligraphy stuff, scarfs, lucky charms and many many more).

There are many shops selling gift souvenirs too.

If just want to take a stroll and buy nothing, visit Chinese Heritage center and Chinese temple.

Chinatown has its own charm and uniqueness."
,,A manufactured taste of China... but well manufactured,4.0,,"This is a tourist trap by definition with many a souvenir stall and Chinese food establishments. Yet, it's strangely nice to wonder around, sit down, have some food and drink some cold beers (around 7 SGD per 600 ml bottle) as you see the tourist scuffle around. It's a lively scene any day of the week.
Food-wise, as in price - quality this is NOT the place to go to be honest. From an experience point of view it's diamond!"
,,A unique attraction for both locals & foreigners,4.0,,"Visitors to Chinatown must not miss the following unique attractions :-
(1) the wet market at basement of Chinatown Food Centre, where we can still find & buy relatively cheap live seafood (fishes, crabs, eels), live frogs & chicken;
(2) the cheapest (less than US$2) 1-star Micheline award oyster sauce chicken noodle;
(3) other economical but tasty local delicacies eg chicken rice, fried flat rice noodle (char kway teow), fruit juices, roast meat, fish/duck porridge, steamed fish head, pork rib soup (bak kut teh), etc;
(4) the Buddhist temple next to the Food Centre where the “Buddha tooth” was first exhibited; and,
(5) many small shops selling local souvenirs."
,,Good food and shopping,5.0,,"Chinatown has both a touristy area for food and shopping and an area for locals. Off of Pagoda Street are lots of shops to buy souvenirs at reasonable prices. Nearby are many restaurants with a good selection of Asian foods. But if you’re adventurous, head to the Chinatown Food Court and you’ll find over 200 food stalls cooking everything at half the price. Plus across the main street is another food court with more bargains, e.g. 12 freshly made potstickers for $3!"
,,My preferred Singapore,5.0,,"The heart and soul of historic Singapore beats here. Numerous cafes, bistrots and restaurants, this is the district of the city that I prefer. Colonial Réminiscence ambiance, feel good factor, eat good options at every single corner. Love it."
,,Always a fun place to visit,5.0,,"I really enjoy Chinatown in Singapore, just so alive and surrounded in history. Each street has a unique story and the history of the Chinese in Singapore is similar to the Chinese in California. It takes more the one day to really capture the vibe."
,,Nice place to visit at night,4.0,,"I highly recommend visiting at night, the lights really bring this place to life. The China town is very walkable. I got there on the subway and it was an easy find. Lots of souvenir shops, but the tooth relic temple was very nice to visit as well.

Even at night, China town was safe and clean."
,,Atmospheric and interesting,4.0,,Great both during the day and at night. Lots of stalls many of which are geared up for tourists. Food stalls in the covered Hawker market was really good. The duck was spot on.
,,Really Cool old China Town,4.0,,"I like the old traditional buildings, it sort of puts you back in the past. There's lots of restaurants and shops a truly good selection for anything you want Chinese."
,,Aimed at the Tourist,3.0,,"Have been to 'Chinatown' in many cities and this felt like much of the same. The majority of customers at shops and food stalls appeared to be tourists. The locals all had the 'sell sell sell' mentality and I didn't find the prices cheap. Did enjoy watching the elderly chinese in the centre square, playing chess, talking with friends and reminiscing on the past. That provided some authenticity to an otherwise un-remarkable experience."
,,Away from the sky scrapers - another world,4.0,,"The main attractions are the chinese market, gardens and the souvenir shops which sell a wide range of souvenirs at low prices. Be carefull in the jewellery shops as they tend to hassle you. The streets are colourful with a temple thrown in and many old colonial style buildings."
,,Have to be careful what you buy,3.0,,"Some Vendors there will jack up the price if they know you are tourist. However, the food centre serves very nice local food and the price is reasonable."
,,Must visit at night,5.0,,Definitely visit Chinatown at night when it is full of people and the atmosphere is amazing. Lots of food stalls and market stalls where to sure to pick up a nice souvenir for a cheap price. We went for dinner here multiple times as the food is so delicious and very cheap! Don’t miss out on such a great place in Singapore!
,,Walktour,3.0,,Chinatown in Singapore is not really different from China Town in other cities. You can buy a lot of cheap stuff and there a lot of restaurants to eat.
,,Rainy Day,3.0,,There was a bit of rain the day we went & there seemed to be little shelter on the path. I still enjoyed seeing the colourful silky materials & it was great to get a name written in Chinese & framed. There were a lot of casual eateries along the way where you can stop for food & beverage. It was an enjoyable experience & if we go back to Singapore I’d definitely go back.
,,I have heard so much and now it's more than what's said!,5.0,,I went completely insane. Best shopping experience. Have loads of gifts at affordable pricing. The food was super yummy. It was easy to find my way around
,,Bit dead in the morning,3.0,,"Visited here at 10 am it was practically deserted . Bit like “ fake “ Chinatown
Most food places not get open but did enjoy a lovely fresh juice at a place on a corner stacked high with fresh fruit
Obviously not the right time to go as there was zero atmosphere"
,,Nothing great except for cheap souvenirs,3.0,,Place is good for buying souvenirs at a very low price (as low as 1 SGD) but didn’t find anything very significant. Well connected to MRT and Taxi’s are available at all times.
,,Enjoyable wander,3.0,,"We visited on quite a wet day so some of the outdoor stalls didn’t open. Otherwise we enjoyed it. Be warned you will be appeased by shop keepers keen to seek their wares. Just be assertive. Also shop around prices vary enormously for the same thing. Also barter, it’s well worth it.

Nice place to visit."
,,The old Singapore,5.0,,"We went for a change of scenery in Singapore, it is colourful , you see a different part of the island and it is nice to see a more traditional area."
,,China community in the city,3.0,,"Take MRT NE no 14. This where you can found chinese culture center, food,art theatre, herb medicine and temple.
- Buddha Tooth Relic Temple
- Chinatown market
- Sri Mariamman Temple
- Masjid

All that you found in here is quite small area you can strolled down by walking an hour to explore the area I suggest wear you comfy shoes/slippers as the weather is quite hot. What interesting is this place more diverse as there are Hindu and Muslim places to see too.

But compare to other Chinatown here’s quite small option and crowd very tourism as the price you get here you can buy much cheap in mustafa centre"
,,Overnight stopover,3.0,,"This place is worth a look, but prices are not really cheap compared to other places in Asia, the street market is aimed at tourists, great places for currency exchange"
,,china town,4.0,,"well if you go to singapore you have to visit china town and little india. looking at the marina bay sands china town one side little india other side, china town is a must to go and see very busy place plenty places to eat and shop and very colourful"
,,Chinatown at its best,5.0,,We’d had a bit of rain in the morning but it had cleared and cleaned the streets. Lots of bargains to be had at the stalls and the food was traditional. Plenty of history to be soaked up if you sought it out.
,,Cheap food and shopping!,5.0,,"One of the oldest areas in Singapore, Chinatown is abuzz with locals and tourists alike. Food is relatively cheap here at the food markets. Catch a glimpse of the olden life in Singapore at the Heritage Centre. Even better, come and squeeze with the locals during the 1 month lead-up to Chinese New Year!"
,,you bargain at the lowest!,4.0,,"very good stuff. you can get so many items at this market for so less. the food shops, the shoe, bags, and so many items. you should definitely visit this place!"
,,Fun Fun Chinatown,5.0,,"It's a great areas, tons of shops, place to eat and have a beer. Some temples, some markets, murals, easy to get to, subway stop, some rest spots. Wish I made a 2nd trip to Chinatown. Great selection of simple gifts."
,,Spend spend eat,5.0,,"If you like food and souvenirs, Chinatown is the place to go to. It's crowded but that just adds to the fun and atmosphere. Make sure when eating that you get a price before ordering as you may be in for a shock at the side dishes and drinks. Souvenirs are a great price and a huge range. If you take the MRT the escalator comes out right in the middle of the main shopping street."
,,An interesting place to walk around,5.0,,"Chinatown is not large, but has a wealth of small shops and restaurants, as well as a great hawker center, where we ate chili crab, black pepper crab, soup dumplings, and noodles. Lively and crowded but not uncomfortably so."
,,Good food,5.0,,"This is the cleanest chinatown that I had ever visited. You can eat prittie good for reasonable price, and you can buy some souvenirs."
,,Chinatown,5.0,,Great place for shopping especially at night. You get many different stuff that are really cheap like souvenirs. Many kinds of restaurants to choose from and enjoy. Definitely worth a visit. Easy to get to by metro as well.
,,Hustle and bustle in Chinatown,5.0,,"Great area with superb eatery’s, boutique hotels, pubs, coffee shops and great walkability for all the above. Close to CBD."
,,Smell senation,4.0,,"Lots of original buildings with the little shutters, very beautiful. A busy place with lots of shops on offer and lots of ating options. Lovely venders."
,,Social Gathering,3.0,,"Decided to meet up with friends in Chinatown’s Smith Street as equal distance to travel to from both sides of City. Good ambiance for a Sunday evening although food was somewhat disappointing, more of an onions with seafood dish. We didn’t have a specific recommendation so took ‘potluck’ and we’re suckered in by the guy at front of house of the establishment (unfortunately I can’t remember the restaurant name), however there are many undercover ‘street restaurants’ to choose from. Less authentic than the hawker stalls I remember form the 1980’s. A choice of soft drinks and Beer is the only alcoholic beverage available"
,,Tons of shopping and restaurants,3.0,,"Tons to see and do in the several blocks of Chinatown, if you like to shop and try Singapore cooking this is the place for you."
,,Blackgirl In Chinatown: Singapore,4.0,,"I found Chinatown to be a bit overwhelming. Lots of vendors selling all manner of goods one could possibly imagine. You could find everything from food- cooked and raw, clothing, jewelry to novelty items and souvenirs. You can have clothing custom made and find silk kimonos all within a fullbody turn.

Aside from being overwhelmed, one vendor followed me around his store, I felt like I was back in America at that moment, but nevertheless I thought it cool. Singapore imports the vast majority of it's goods, and the Chinatown markets are a great way to see how exchange is done.

I would go again, but break it down over 2 days so that I can enjoy it."
,,Wonderful sights and Shopping,4.0,,We went to Chinatown and walked around Ate and Shopped. Nicely Decorated but not as Decorated as Little India.
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"Have visited Chinatowns in many cities around the world. This one is nothing special. Lots of shops selling cheap goods - once you've been through one shop you've seen it all. Food shops all have pretty much the same fare, and the prices are all about the same. Restaurants are all pretty similar. NOTE: Chinatown is NOT handicapped or wheelchair accessible! Streets and sidewalks are in dis-repair. Sidewalks are narrow. Restroom facilities are available only if you pay to eat in a restaurant, and then most of the time the facilities are up a very steep flight of stairs."
,,Spice scammers,3.0,,"Beware of scams. Especially buying spices like saffron. Always ask to try. Or else it can be dyed crap you are buying. One scammer is 71 Temple St, Teck Yin Soon Chinese Medical Hall Pte Ltd, Singapore 058615. Avoid this."
,,Markets,5.0,,There are plenty of markets very cheap. Some of the architect of the building was good. Good rail service to get there. Plenty of people in the markets.
,,So much fun!,5.0,,"I loved Singapore’s Chinatown. It’s quaint with some lovely buildings, tea shops and restaurants. Just walking around is entertainment!

While in Chinatown, go to Old Chengdu for Szechuan. The Kung Pao chicken, spicy green beans and pork dumplings are amazing. The gentlemen next to us highly recommended the chili crab."
,,So much choice!,5.0,,"Loved the vibe of Chinatown; vibrant, noisy, busy, all manner of foods and services! Apart from the array of souvenir shops there do much choice of food. We ate chicken with cashews & salted egg prawns. Service was prompt, this was street food but not cheap food. Staff really helpful and friendly. So many Singapore souvenirs to choose from!"
,,No halal food,3.0,,Went here once at did not find a single halal restaurant.If you are muslim it is hard to get food here. Also the toilets here are hard to find and can be dirty
,,It's Chinatown,3.0,,"I have to agree with the other reviewers who say that this is similar to other Chinatown locations. What may set it apart is the large number of eateries serving Singaporean food. There is a 2 block food court with outside tables and lots of places to eat. There is shopping and picturesque views. Prices are reasonable. If you've been to Chinatown in another city, you will know what to expect. We ate here and were pleased. As anywhere in Singapore, alcoholic drinks are expensive (20 ounce beer is ~ $12). Food plates, on the other hand, started at $6."
,,Nice palace for walking and shopping,4.0,,A cultural destination of Singapore. A good place to buy souvenirs as well as enjoy Chinese food. Nice !
,,Interesting food court.,4.0,,"There's so many Chinese food here, also the tropical fruits. But it's not easy to find halal food there. There's a old buildings there and it's good for photoshoot."
,,heritage tour,5.0,,nice to connect with the chinese roots with my friends. pretty cosmopolitan vibes too. will come back for sure
,,Chinatown Singapore Is Pretty Much Chinatown Anywhere,3.0,,"I personally did not find anything special about Chinatown Singapore. One sees the same kinds of shops one sees in Chinatowns in Montreal or San Francisco or New York. With that said, it is still fun to do a bit of shopping for some exotic merchandise, such as jade elephants, decorated chopsticks and door hangings. One item of interest in Chinatown is the Indian temple. It is unique and worthy of a visit and picture-taking."
,,Try it with walking tour,3.0,,"Try it with free walking tour to be more knowledge and excited about the place. Without that, it has some limited info to understand."
,,Nice place to visit,5.0,,"A small neighbourhood in the middle of the city! Really nice to visit, go shopping or eat in a lovely restaurant"
,,"Food, souvenirs and usual hustle and bustle",4.0,,Great outing in Chinatown! From the moment you step out of the MRT your senses will be overloaded with different smells and sounds. You can find some great souvenirs here and grab a bite to eat or a refreshing drink from many of the stalls. Smith street is full of food stalls and it’s got a glass roof so you’ll stay sheltered even if it’s raining. Unlike some other parts of Singapore you’ll be able to buy the Durian fruit here or taste Durian ice cream (if you’re feeling adventurous).
,,Always nice visit,5.0,,Every time I come to Singapore I come here for a visit and I always enjoy it. It is great place to try street food and nice chicken rice. Couple temples also around
,,Lots of food and shops,4.0,,It's a place where local also go there too. Smith street food market is more for tourist (and of course higher price) but if walk inside to new bridge you will find a hawker on the 2md floor where all locals are. I've tried pork satay and it's pretty yummy.
,,Delicious hustle and bustle.,5.0,,"What a wonderful assault on the senses. From noise, smell,colour to a vibrant feel in the hot humid air Chinatown does not disappoint. The streets are packed tightly together and you can buy almost anything. Durian fruit stalls make you recoil with their rotten sock smell. Try one and you will be pleasantly surprised with the taste. Just don't bring one back to your hotel room, unless you want to change hotels . Visit the heritage center museum to get a feel of what it was like for the Chinese emigrant during the last two centuries. Eye opening. Have lunch at the famous Maxwell Hawker center. Try the Hainanese chicken, delicious. Buy decorative chopsticks for the folks back home. Listen to some Chinese karaoke opera at the opera school in Smith st.
Just have fun and take in the atmosphere to store in memory of your visit to Singapore."
,,Good place to buy cheaper souvenirs and a good range of food,4.0,,"SIngapore's Chinatown can be a bit touristy - but it is a good place to buy souvenirs at a cheaper cost than in town area. Singaporeans also visit China town as there are many eating places there, so food wise, it's not only for tourists. The Yue Hwa emporium is worth visiting though you might not want to buy things there as they are not cheap (quality might be better though). However, there is a big range of silk products and you can see a huge variety of bottled chinese food products."
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,Great tourist attraction. It’s not for the faint hearted or fussy when it comes to eating here. Food is good.
,,Chinatown,4.0,,Vibrant night life it small area. It’s easy walking among the bars. There are prostitutes working so be very careful and would not take kids.
,,Great place for gifts and souvenirs,5.0,,We had a really good time walking around the stalls and stores in Chinatown area. There is just so much to see and if you want to pick up really good souvenirs and reasonably priced gifts there is no shortage of those. Embroidered Satin purses and sets of coaster are all great buys here. Food stalls serve very tasty quality dishes. We are so glad we spent an entire day here!
,,Much better than airport hawker centre,4.0,,"We have been to Chinatown in Singapore many times; we have a favourite place to sit at tables a bit away from those who determinedly (and sometimes annoyingly!) try to get you to sit near their restaurants/stalls. It’s toward one end where there are mostly outdoor tables along each side of the street. It might be more touristy/costly than the hawker centre near the airport, but the food is recognisable to most westerners ie. not many dishes have fish heads floating/eyeballing you like at airport centre. If you do want traditional locals’ food go there but take some wipes to clean down seats and tables. Chinatown has more staff clearing tables etc so appeals more to us. Another time we plan on going to centre near Botanic Gardens."
,,OK for a wonder and street food,3.0,,"The area is OK for a walk around and the street food, get there in the SMRT. Unless you are hungry and need to shop for the usual Chinatown items expect to spend about an hour there."
,,Nice place to walk and take a few pictures,4.0,,"Quite busy (lots of tourists), but some interesting buildings and plenty of food. Definitely worth a visit when you're in Singapore."
,,Don’t miss the Street of Food and Buddhist Temple,5.0,,"China Town was a great stop and just a short Underground ride down the line from Little India.

The Street of Food has something for every palate. As exotic or not as you wish. Most vendors have some degree of English and we had no problem communicating. Cash is King, however, and don’t plan on being able to use a credit card.

The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum was fascinating and we were lucky enough to be there on a holiday to witness a wonderful service.

What a great cultural experience!!"
,,Highlight of Singapore,5.0,,"Really take the time to explore Chinatown outside of the usual Buddha tooth relic temple and the cheap markets on Pagoda street. The Chinatown Heritage centre was really a highlight for us in understanding the history of Singapore and Chinatown. Great restaurant offerings, bakeries and Chinese medicine outlets."
,,Chinatown foodies,3.0,,The place is a treat itself in terms of foods. Lots to choose from and very affordable. You will have a feast for sure. There are lots of temples that you can visit and just walking distance too! Riding the train is the fastest and easy way in going there.
,,Busy.,4.0,,People everywhere hot smelly but the shopping is amazing. Barter for a good price or walk away. Clothes jewelry or get a piece of clothing made especially for you.
,,Interesting,4.0,,"You may get what you didnt expect as you see different races and religions walking around despite its called Chinatown. Many things you are able to get from ancient, traditional to modern. Everything! Easy access to go there via MRT. Convenient I would say. The whole stretch, there are many things that you can shop till you drop. Enjoy the ambience like being in Kowloon or HongKong. The only setback is the weather. Hot and humid during the day. Sometimes it can be humid too in the evening. Overall, nice place to vebture out of curiosity. Just get yourself a thin layer airy clothing and with a pair of walking shoes, you are good to go!"

,,Mind blowing,4.0,,"We walked to Chinatown. It was just amazing. The food , gifts , shops were an eye opener. We did the walk that the lonely planet book recommended and that was fun."
,,Nice place to buy presents,3.0,,"""Pasalubong"" means things you can take home as presents for loved ones and friends. This is where we bought key chains. 36 pieces for Sgd 10. That's a bargain right? Magnets here are not so nice. The nice ones can be bought at Lucky plaza along orchard road. I enjoyed shopping here though. Your eyes will literally water coz of all the nice things being sold here. I forgot to mention the chocolates 4 boxes for Sgd 10. Each box holds ten big merlion-shaped chocolates with different varieties like milk, almond, dark chocolate, etc."
,,Interesting but very crowded,5.0,,"Lot's to see but incredibly busy, certainly a truly Chinese experience though & lots of interesting shops & stalls."

,,Soak up Singapore's Heritage Trail,4.0,,"Visiting the alleys of streets, you will notice shop house with unique architectural structures. And if you are looking for food, IT'S EVERYWHERE!!
Highly recommend the chinatown complex for your dining experience. Let's just say As a Singaporean, it is a go-to even on my weekends, the variety of cuisines are endless, and are affordable too.

However, to all muslim visitors there will lack of Halal options, except fast food joints near the MRT station."

The atmosphere and noise is amazing . The smells are Chinese spices and cooking. We where told to keep money and phones out of site. We didn't see much pilfering or bag snatching however be careful."
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,"Great just to walk through Chinatown to experience the sights, sounds and smell of the restaurants. Unrivalled selection of cafes and restaurants although some are better than others. Avoid the Chinatown Seafood Restaurant as it’s unhygienic and serving poor food. See other review on that particular establishment. However don’t let my experience of this one out you off the overall Chinatown experience. It’s a fab place."

,,"Been to 1, been to them all!!!",3.0,,"Chinatown has hundreds of stalls to choose from. Many of them selling the same goods. Negotiation / bartering was limited because if you didn't buy it, someone else would."
,,Chinatown Singapore,5.0,,Good and affordable place for shopping. All types of gift articles available. Ideal location in Singapore for shopping for friends and families
,,Market Shopping,5.0,,Good location to do some shopping at the markets and get some bargains. Doing up the Mall so will be good when finished.
,,Enjoy the atmosphere.,4.0,,"You can choose to get a very shallow taste of Chinatown for an hour or immerse yourself and spend a day or days here.

,,A real cultural experience,5.0,,Had a wonderful night here strolling the markets and eating great food with special friends. #Adeladies #Book club travellers
,,Time flies,3.0,,"We first visited over thirty years ago when local people lived and worked in the area. It had an authentic feel about it. The buildings had a charm of their own. However, times flies and everyone wants to make progress. Singapore is certainly a place of progress with skyscraper buildings built on plots of valuable land. The country is successful. However, the old Singapore is rapidly disappearing and in Chinatown the old ways have gone too: replaced by tourist shops and restaurants. Disappointing for us but perhaps of interest to some."
,,Sightseeing history,5.0,,"China town here is brilliant
A great blend of the history of the Chinese in Singapore and there culture and faith as well as some great bargain shops and food places
Definitely worth the hours walking around to enjoy a fascinating day of traditional temples and life of the early Chinese settlers"

,,Love Singapores Chinatown,5.0,,"Lots of things to see and buy here, cheap trinkets, great food and very close to local hawker centre with fantastic local eats!"
,,A market place,4.0,,"We enjoyed the day spent shopping in Chinatown as we liked the bargain shopping. Lots of stalls and a few interesting temples to visit. At the tourist information, we purchased our tickets for our next days attractions,very helpful. Easy to get to with MRT station being right in Chinatown. Definitely worth a visit while in Singapore. Plenty of food areas with seats...it was hot and these were welcoming."
,,Seen it all in 5 min.,3.0,,"Getting off the MRT and wandering for 5 min gives you all you need. Other than the few temples/pagodas etc, there isn't more to see or do. Outrageous prices for trinkets and store after store of the same thing. Save your time and money for more intetesting things and places.

Oh, the best thing about Chinatown? The Park Royal's architecture. Art of its own."
,,Pleasant promenade.,5.0,,"First time visiting Chinatown of Singapore. Easy access via MRT. Lovely well-preserved colourful exteriors of shophouses. Smith Street, Pagoda Street and Sago Street were lined with little stalls and eating places. Definitely visit this first before attempting Orchard Road or The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands."
,,shopping,4.0,,"worth a look around while in Singapore get of bus stop 10 on hop on off bus walk to end off road inside Chinatown , stop at bar on left hand side big bottles beer cheap , turn to right talor about second from end of shops cheapest silk shirts pre made after bartering"

,,Not a must,3.0,,"This is a standard Chinese market (seen one - seen them all). There are many places to eat and shop, and it is a good place to but cheap souvenirs."
,,Just like all Chinatowns,5.0,,Splash of red is everywhere and lots of souvenir stores to get for folks at home. The food court is filled with the local Chinese eating and speaking in their native tongue. I enjoyed the icecream from a man on a trike...
,,"Same old, same old",3.0,,"Barring the changes we have noticed, Chinatown will always be Chinatown with shopping for cheap goods and tasty food for locals and visitors. There is still the usual hustle and bustle and the myriad of restaurants and food operators that caters for every palate and taste from noodles, bak kwa, the famous dim sum place on Trengganu St to Maccas. One can find cheap trinkets and knick knacks to knock off LV handbags almost at will. The ever evolving ""scenery"" is and will continue to change despite the ""same old"" atmosphere being the constant. Go there in the evening for dinner and spend a few hours looking around."
,,Lots of Character in Chinatown,5.0,,"SG is generally so clean you could almost eat your food off the floor. Chinatown is different, it provides a little more character and gives you a sense of how the locals live. Some great food and a chance to buy a souveneir."
,,Great,5.0,,"A very traditional place in Singapore in terms of it's decoration and the street in general. Very busy and great place to shop and bargain! Not to mention, there is great food in the vicinity too like mala!"

,,Favourite shopping area,5.0,,"Did China town, Little India & Burgis Street, China town was for us the best, Lots of fashion in Burgis Street, tat & bling in Little India but Chinatown was a bit more up market, wish our hotel was based in this area, we went a couple of times."
,,Geat time in Chinatown,4.0,,My wife had a wonderful time in Chinatown but if you want to buy anything remember you have to haggle!
,,Not a good this time,3.0,,"This is our 4th trip to Singapore and on each visit we go to China Town,
this year there was a fair bit of construction work happening in the main Stall area, We go each year to our favourite seller but she was no longer there, after walking around the crowded street due to the construction in the middle, we accidentally found a small walkway that took us to the Stalls hidden behind the construction site, that's where the missing stalls were (except our favourite), it was quiet as not too many people realized they were there.
we will go back again next year, as it is an interesting area."
,,Not just another market,5.0,,"We took a stroll through Chinatown and ended up near the temple. Across the court was a residential building that housed a complete food market. It was amazing. Fish, meat, vegetables, prepared food, fresh flowers and other treats in the basement. Retail shopping on the main floor. Food court on the next floor up. Parking garage after that than residential goes up from there. Wonderful experience of the local culture. Loved the fish market."
,,Foodie Central!,5.0,,"If you enjoy food and want a truly local experience, visit Chinatown. The main street is a bit more tourist centric i.e.full of sit down restaurants and some more upmarket hawker stalls, but cross the bridge and you'll be in local food heaven. Try everything from duck heads/hearts (we opted out) to kimchi buns (yum), oyster omelettes (yes please) and ""carrot cake"" (seconds!). For those less adventurous eaters, there is a McDonald's and the staple 7-11, so something for everyone and with VERY affordable prices."
,,"Noisy, tourist fun !",4.0,,Everyone should visit Chinatown for a little taste of China and to pick up a load of souvenirs! Many street sellers with a myriad of different items for sale from tourist trinkets to nice jewellery. Plenty to see and to spend your money on. Food reasonably priced and a good selection.
,,Chinatown is worth the walk around,3.0,,Chinatown provides a nice juxtaposition to the almost sterile manicured feel of the Harbourside and downtown. Here there are alleys and hawkers and good stands mixed in between temples. The melee of noises and smells are unmistakably China. Highlight was the Buddhist temple that provided a calm respite to the visit.
,,Best shopping street,5.0,,"The best Chinatown I visited in the region. Far much better than the one in Malaysia. The options were great, the prices were also reasonable. It's a brilliant place for just walking not necessarily buying or eating. never to be missed while in Singapore."
,,Not worth shopping instead Musthaffa is better,5.0,,"We visited China Town thinking it is cheaper than others places, it is not really worth shopping here, instead Musthaffa is better."
,,Fantastic Markets,5.0,,Well worth a visit. Great markets and great food. You could easily spend a day there. The markets are as you would expect ... covers everything
,,Cheap shopping and eating.,4.0,,It’s a bit touristy but still worth a look as there are many stalls and shops selling everything from cheap souvenirs to luxury tea shops with some of the best tea around. Also visit the fish spa at mrt exit . Some good eating options and plenty of atmosphere.
,,Full of charm,5.0,,Chinatown still has its own style and charm although it has been much cleaned up and is very much a tourist centre.

,,Food and Art,4.0,,"Most Chinatowns are similar around the world, you know what you get, good food and plenty of tourists. I liked the Singapore Chinatown as it had some cool streets with lots of very nice artwork on it where you could take pictures. A bit different to the norm"

If you are hungry, get in to one of many eateries to taste some authentic Chinese cuisine. And don't forget to pay a visit to the tooth relic temple at the end of the street."
,,A Fanatastic place,4.0,,Steeped in culture with lots of amazing resturants and not expensive plus lots of street markets offering a great insight in to old Singapore
,,Prepared to be hassled to buy,4.0,,"Quite good to wander through the lanes at Chinatown. Be prepared to be hassled. I gave in to having some tailoring done, however was left very disappointed with the fit. Lots of food places to chose from."
,,"So warm, dress down",3.0,,Chinatown has a lovely atmosphere especially when its nearing chinese new year!! But super crowded with loads of tourist and the weather isnt helping.
,,Chinatown in Singapore,5.0,,A wonderful collection of streets and byways greet you in Chinatown. It is a great mixture of retail stalls selling everything imaginable and restaurants with cuisine from around the world. Most of the dining is al fresco so you can enjoy the bustle all around you.

,,Chinatown,5.0,,"My partner and I loved having dinner in Chinatown most nights.

They offer a street dining area which offers a great range of local dishes at a good price and is a nicer atmosphere then the nearby hawker centre.

Chinatown was also a great market place for cheap souvenirs.

Highly recommend for any traveller."
,,Bargain hunting for cheaper tourist souvenirs,3.0,,"Worth a wander on an evening for food, to have a drink or buy a few things to remind you of Singapore. The themes are primarily Chinese mainland influences and cheaper Singapore souvenirs from t shirts, to fridge magnets, but 5he experience of walking the streets and trying a range of foods and the odd drink at sensible prices makes for a fun evening.

Also of note is Sago Street, where people would have gone to spend their final days when facing death through illness in the past"
,,Try a Hawker Food Court!,5.0,,"We visiting the Chinatown Hawker food court.....followed the recommendation of ""pick the station with the longest line""...and enjoyed so many yummy items! We were concerned about the ice in the drinks but we were perfectly fine!"

,,History and souvenirs,5.0,,"Come to Chinatown in Singapore to see beautiful architecture and learn about history. However, be prepared to be approached by everyone selling their wares trying to convince you to buy some trinkets, clothing for your other half, a new suit, or some jewelry of unknown origin. Many of the shops will have good, cheap souvenirs to bring home but avoid anything pricey, as its likely not worth it. Be polite, yet insistent, in your responses to the shop owners and they'll be polite to you."
,,Well worth a visit,3.0,,Chinatown is easily accessible by MRT. It has long roads with stalls selling the same souvenirs- all tacky and overpriced. One good point (apart from the atmosphere) is being able to buy a quart of Tiger beer for S$7.50 - or just over A$8. Prices in Singapore are expensive). The big Buddhist Monastery is also there a must and is situated at the far corner near the information centre.
,,Interesting Place,3.0,,Full of stalls in narrow market place streets selling all sorts of wares. Very crowded. Lots of eating places. Also home to the Buddist temple Budda Tooth Relic. If nearby worth an hour of your time.
,,Old meets New,5.0,,"Great place to walk around, eat, or just people-watch. It really comes alive during Chinese New Year festivities. Old World charm meets new here as the buildings are very much a sign of the times today and from years past. Great spot to get in some walking. If bringing small children, better to use a bjorn or backpack carrier instead of a stroller."
,,What a place,5.0,,"China town is a must see, and
You can get to it via the RMT (tube)
Major hustle and bustle, old meets new, all the sights and smells, so safe, and
Very friendly, while in Singapore you must go, and the food from the street vendors is fantastic at a good price"
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"Heard and read so much about it, but lived up to nothing. Most disappointing was Chinatown Complex, dirty unappetising hawker centre, unappealing market."
,,History among the High Rises.,5.0,,"We have visited Chinatown on each of our Singapore visits. Nice to stroll the narrow streets and view the shop houses that have survived the surrounding developments. On our walking tour, our guide mentioned that most are now on the National Register with eyewatering values attached. There are some beautiful temples, interesting shops, market stalls, shopping centres and a plethora of eating places. You also have Hawker Chan, awarded a Michelin Star, and now in a restaurant in Smith Street. The area was festooned with flags and bunting for yet another festival."
,,Lots and Lots of gift shops,3.0,,"If I had a choice between China Town and Little India I would chose Little India every time, China Town seems more designed for tourists with hundreds of tacky shops elling gifts. There are some beautiful buildings but often behind modern structures ruin8ngntheir charm. The food is OK but again, better to be had elsewhere"
,,Highly recommended tourist location,5.0,,"You can see the old Chinese style buildings and culture in Chinatown comparing to the modern city areas of Singapore. There are so many small restaurants with different distinctive favor that you can taste and my most favorite one is the famous Hainan Chicken Rice. If you like to eat durian, you can taste the most popular (expensive) durian from Malaysia and the coconut water from Thailand in the chain durian shop located in Chinatown. It's also a good place for you to purchase small special souvenirs for your friends and relatives with many choices in valuable price."
,,Fab place!,5.0,,Great place to visit. Lots of shops and places to eat. Found it very safe to walk round and have a look to what was on offer. Having the free WIFI within the area was a great bonus.

,,"Okay, nothing special.. Lot of street souvenirs.",3.0,,"Guess was expecting a lot more. Some street food, few seafood restaurants. Mainly stands peddling wears and cheap souvenirs. If have the extra time and nothing to do, then maybe but otherwise nothing much. Mot your typical Chinatown.."
,,Colourful and a great place for shopping souvniers,4.0,,The place is full of colorful Chinese lanterns and as the name suggests is filled with chinese artefacts and other souvniers one can carry back home. There is a food street and if you are a hard core non vegetarian then this is the place for you.
,,Only if you've got time,3.0,,"We have done China town before and we were very impressed, unfortunately this time we were left a little disappointed.
The people as always were extremely friendly,
The middle of the town was under construction and the food didn't seem to be as amazing as we remember..great to go and see, if you have the time but not a must do."
,,Shop till u drop,5.0,,"Omg colourful my canara never stopped clicking, they have everything for a reasonable price! But beware if u buy something cheaper u can b lucky or not! I bought 3 things and had problems with all 3!
I bought other things and was fine!
Just walk around and soak in the atmosphere, it buzzes with life"
,,A city within a city.,5.0,,"A maze of little streets and buildings containing gift shops, restaurants and street stalls.
A little gem bustling with all nations.
Get your gifts, have food and drink or just watch the world go by.

,,Exotic,4.0,,Best Chinatown I’ve visited. The food was amazing as well as the very friendly never pushy vendors. Highly recommended.
,,Loved it here.,5.0,,We had some great street food and beer at a very reasonable price. But the jewel in the crown is the Temple of the Buddha Tooth. There was a festival on and a ceremony in the temple which was mesmerising and we were allowed to take photos. It was a special place and not to be missed
,,Great friendly place with great food places,5.0,,"We spent an entire afternoon just walking around admiring the food centres and shops, stopped a couple of times for a beer, and had an amazing meal at one of the foodstalls, great friendly area, and has a metro stop ""Chinatown"" for easy access"
,,Nice place with cheap souvenirs,4.0,,"A nice look into Chinese history and good place to taste the Chinese food. There is a lot of street food available and the prices are low for Singapore standards. A good selection of affordable souvenirs as well. All in all, interesting but did not find it too different than other China towns I have been in."
,,Lively place,4.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is a lively place.

We walked past lots of stalls selling all sorts of merchandise. There were some nice buildings painted in appealing colours. Saw some nice shops selling Chinese items like medicine, souvenirs, clothes, gifts, food provisions etc.

There were several restaurants. Seating was wither indoors or on the street. There were food stalls preparing freshly made meals. The smells, sights and sounds were just incredible. Some of the dishes made by the stall holders are generously portioned.

I would recommend a visit."
,,Great fun to walk through the little market and purchase goods,4.0,,Had a fun couple of hours in Chinatown - caught the MRT down and got off up in the little market - some great little shops there and got the cutest little tea sets. People all lovely and just a great sight with all the decorations - if you like little markets then you will enjoy this
,,"The food, massage and Chinese medicine all in one area, great",5.0,,"Started with a Chinese massage, on my aching feet. OMG I thought I was in heaven. Then the food so many choices and just so yummy. If you are wanting any Chinese medicines this is the place to go. Everything very reasonably priced. People are lovely and very helpful. Really had a great day."
,,Lots of stalls,5.0,,The best thing about Chinatown is The Maxwell food centre beat hainanese chicken. We bought some sweet dresses for the girls and a few souvenirs but the food bought us back the next day.
,,More than enough for a full day,5.0,,"Put on your walking shoes and have your camera at the ready... The obvious points of interest in Chinatown are Sri Mariamman Temple (check out the statuary!) and the Buddha Tooth Temple (beautiful gold statues in their 100's downstairs and the relic upstairs), but you should also feed the inner man or woman at Maxwell Food Centre. Everything on offer is excellent, but the Hainanese chicken is considered a specialty here. Then walk 2 minutes to 1 Neil Rd to see the Jinrikisha Station sign and contemplate an era when transportation meant a rickshaw ride. Then a bit of retail therapy at People's Park Complex or in the little shops on Bunda St. This is where you can stock up on tourist tat, cheap presents, the corny, the kitschy, and the just plain bizarre... everything from Merlion keyrings to Singapore skyline snow globes with disco lights to plastic solar powered cats beckoning good fortune to come your way... You get the idea. Just about everything sells for $3 or $4! Nip over to Seah Peck St and visit Seng Wong Beo Taoist Temple; you will be amazed! Cross Anson and Shenton Way to reach Palmer Rd and have a look at the very opulent and beautiful keramat of Habib Noor. This, in my experience, is the friendliest mosque in Singapore. You don't go in the prayer rooms, but rather go upstairs to the keramat with nice harbourside breezes. Head back to Maxwell Rd... just around the corner is Telok Ayer Chinese Methodist Church; the oldest Chinese Christian Church in Singapore. Just walk one more block to Thian Hock Keng Temple; one of the oldest Fuijianese style temples with remarkable statuary. Then is just a 2 minute walk over to Robinson Rd to Lau Pa Sat, a sprawling Victorian wrought iron food centre. It was built in Glasgow, dismantled, shipped out and reassembled in Singapore. Thanks to huge ceiling fans, it's nice and cool and you can have a cool drink, tea, coffee and just about every Singaporean gastronomic specialty you can think of.
In answer to TripAdvisor questions: there's no fee to pay, or extra fee to 'skip the queue'... in fact there's no queue! There are times when head covering is required (for the ladies, anyway), so bring along that scarf. Modest, or shall we say knee and elbow length clothing is always a good idea in Singapore... at Habib Noor's keramat they'll happily lend you an enormous dark green cape no matter no modestly you dress."
,,Explored,5.0,,This place is amazing to buy gift items as sovenier and also for antiques / ancient items s well which I explored very recently. Don't forget to bargain in antique shops. You need to really try for bargaining skills
,,Interesting but too many tourist shops,4.0,,"It is worth a visit to look at the old houses which have been well maintained and visit a couple of the temples. However, it is now full of tourist shops which spoil the effect of the old houses."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Busy and typical of a chinatown The market stalls are good and full of the usual souvenirs A nice place to spend a morning and browse
,,Souvenirs!,4.0,,This is the best place to buy souvenirs at dirt cheap prices. I have heard the non veg food here is also good. Not tasted though as I am a vegetarian. Also you can get tickets to attractions at a discounted rate from People's Park Mall

,,Chinatown,5.0,,"Chinatown is amazing as besides interesting Shophouses which are shops at the ground floor and living quarters (now mainly businesses) on the higher floors, there are Indian Temples and islamic Mosque within the area.

Boutique Hotels and restaurants are plentiful. An open food street is designed with famous food stalls."

,,Wear good walking shoes! So much to see and do,4.0,,I thought that a day in Chinatown would be a long and tiresome adventure. Turns out that the time just skips away as there is so much to see. The shopping stands and malls keep you entertained for hours. Pricing of the clothes and shoes is not always cheap but definitely worth visiting.
,,Shop shop shop,4.0,,Chinatown has everything from great food to anything you can imagine to buy. Can get a little crowded during peak season and is very touristy
,,Has Lost Some Luster,3.0,,"There are still markets, restaurants and hawker stands throughout but it just isnt the same as it was years ago. A favored tourist destination but it has lost a bit of its old world thru too much commercialism. Still some temples worth seeing but the souvenir shops are cheap ware now run by many Indian managers and staff. Years ago you would hear Chinese music and instruments. It seems old to hear Indian music throughout the shops."

,,Little China,4.0,,"The place was really good for food and so much on offer. Plenty of fruit and veg, with loads of street food place to eat."
,,Singapore Chinatown,4.0,,This is one of the most historical and beautiful district in Singapore. This was once the home for many Chinese who came from China trying to find a job here. Businesses was once flourished and many Chinese kins set up their roots over here. This place is also know as 牛车水 which mean cow carriage transporting water. We had merchants using cow carriages to carry drinking water and sold to the locals over here in the olden days. This is a place where you can find the best Chinese food in Singapore and once of the oldest Chinese and Indian temples. Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and the nearby Singapore River are some of the places you must visit.
,,Enjoy the chinese culture,4.0,,Feels like you visit china but in singapore. You can find cheep clothes and souvenirs and traditional food
,,Authentic Chinatown experience,5.0,,"I have travelled across our globe and had Chinatown experiences in San Francisco, London and Vancouver yet this Chinatown being so close to China itself has more credence. The whole area has a great buzz about it, is quite colourful as one would expect from Chinese/Asian Artisans. This being a stop on the Red line Hippo Bus sightseeing tours and is the best way of reaching Chinatown then subsequently departing it is served by 3 different stops.
Since visiting there I am now the proud owner of a tailored bespoke jacket.
My wife and I also had our best Singapore luncheon experience during our visit."
,,Better visit it at night,5.0,,Visit the Singapore's Chinatown twice during our stay. I recommend to visit it at night since the super hot day in Singapore will sweating you out.

,,Shop 'til you drop in Chinatown,5.0,,"So many little shops to discover in Chinatown, it's really a must see for your souvenir needs. And it's the one place where you can get gifts cheap in Singapore!"
,,Very cheap souvenirs,5.0,,"We found China Town an awesome spot to purchase our souvenirs and a great spot for lunch. It is a good idea to shop around before you buy because the prices can be different from stall to stall. The prices are extremely cheap.
Beware of locals that start talking to you and asking you questions because they want to suss you out and then take you into a jewellery stall or tech stall. My advice is just to be polite and say no thanks we are just here to look around, we arent looking for anything specific."
,,Need some time to visit,4.0,,Chinatown is bigger than Little India so you need a little bit more time to visit. I always love to walk and loose myself in those typical little town inside a city. This one is particulary interesting. I will let you discover the place.
,,One of the three Major Cultures in Singapore,4.0,,"If you would like to learn and experience the Chinese lineage of Singapore, this is the place to visit. They have restored some houses and streets to give you the feel of the Chinese heritage. It is also a great place to find great food and souvenirs to take home. The place can get crowded on weekends, so if you visit, make sure you do it in the morning."
,,One of the nicest Chinatowns I've seen - very vibrant,5.0,,"It's a buzz of activity, but visually it has to be one of the nicest Chinatowns I've seen. Very colourfully decorated and very vibrant. The food options are endless, where can you go wrong with $3 chicken and rice?"
,,A must visit for culture and food,5.0,,"Chinatown is a great place to visit to learn about Chinese history in Singapore. There are a lot of great local restaurant and the food hawker stand are a must for foodies.
Don’t miss Hawker Chan, the cheapest Michelin Star restaurant.
Also a lot of souvenir shop but make sure you bargain for the price.
There are several temple around Chinatown for you to visit."
,,"Very colourful, memorable experience but rather a tourist trap.",5.0,,"Very colourful, visuallly exciting and great atmosphere and splendid cooking smells at every step. But the high proportion of people who are clearly visitors marks this as something of a tourist trap. Not many locals seem to eat there and it pays to go where they go. Try the slightly tatty Golden Mile area, not so colourful, but seemingly full of local people. And less relentless hustle too."
,,A cultural experience,4.0,,There are lots of small shops selling Chinese art work. I bought some hand painted Christmas decorations and watched the lady paint a message on them...it was an art form that's 200 years old. There are also many cheap eateries and bars. It's equally vibrant by day or by night.
,,Shop and Eat,5.0,,"A must visit place for the tourist and shopper alike, a wide variety of wares and crafts as well as clothes and eats. Very colourful and buzzing with activity during business hours, lots of sights and smells that make it interesting."
,,Chinatown as it should be,4.0,,Chinatown in Singapore in my opinion far exceeds that of New York and London. The food is relatively cheap for Singapore.

,,A little overpriced,3.0,,Singapore is more expensive than any other city in Asia so that is to be expected. However you can find the same stuff they sell in the stalls in Thailand or Malaysia or Thailand for 10 times less. The food is good though!
,,Nice food,4.0,,The food is really good and well priced in china town! Some parts are really pretty with lanterns and decorations! The shops are a bit rubbish selling fake trinkets and holiday favours but still worth a mooch and look around to pick something silly up
,,A little slice of Chinese Culture,5.0,,"My tip would be to go early to beat the crowds and the heat of the day. About 150m from the MRT station Chinatown.

The metro is the best way to get there. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. It is worth a visit Every time you go to Singapore. The Hawker food centres are amazing and great value for money."
,,Hectic,5.0,,Busy busy busy! Shopping is great and it feels like you are in China. Food stalls every where just choose carefully otherwise can work out expensive. Would go back for sure!
,,Fun afternoon,4.0,,We visited Chinatown and headed off the main tourist streets - with their typical restaurants in favour of finding the local shopping and hawker areas. We explored a couple of local shopping areas and sampled food on the upper floors - these areas are not full of tourists but rather locals. Food is great in these places and much more authentic and less expensive than those storefronts designed for tourists.
,,Love this place!,5.0,,"Took a look around here on arrival today and it was awesome, so much going on and the smell of all the amazing food was incredible !
Definitely worth checking out the food stalls as there are many different ones as well as the souvenir stores and markets (may not be everyone’s cup of tea) but we liked the vibe a lot ! So far Singapore is living up to all expectations that friends has told us about so we are looking forward to exploring tomorrow! ❤️"
,,Must do for visitors,4.0,,Chinatown is a must do for visitors to Singapore. Wander the streets finding great crafts and interesting presents to take back to the loved ones while enjoying the vibrant atmosphere and some great food. The Museum of Chinese in Singapore is well worth a visit.

,,Great Spot in Singapore,5.0,,Top spot to visit for foodies. There are stacks of different options from Hawker Centres to Michelin Star. We love Maxwell Rd Centre and also Burnt Ends. But whatever you want you will find here.
,,Chinatown Secrets,4.0,,"From the Temple of the Tooth of Buddha, to the local hawker centre where pork tonkatsu is just at SGD6, Chinatown has tonnes of secrets waiting to be explored. Catch the evening lights along the back alleys, and cross over to the other side of Cross Street to Club Street for a variety of bars to hop and food places to eat at."
,,Great atmosphere and eateries.,5.0,,"We visited both day and evening. Lots of temples worth visiting especially the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, you do need to cover legs & arms to go inside. Lots of small shops selling cheap tacky touristy gifts, if you want a souvenir fridge magnet Chinatown is the place to go.
The evening is when the place really comes to life. The sights, the sounds, the aromas truly get all the senses working over time. Eat at one of the Hawker centres, hot and noisy but the food is delicious with plenty of choices and very cheap."
,,Great food,4.0,,"This was in walking distance from our hotel. There is a restaurant for anyone and everyone. There is also an ice cream man we bought amazing ice cream from.

,,Love Chinatown,5.0,,"Travelled here on the MRT train system and loved it. Eyes open go all it offers and stop in anywhere and have lunch or dinner with a beer or wine or soft drink and just enjoy the hustle and bustle of what's going on. Agree your price on everything and haggle when buying local merchandise as it's part of the experience. Visit the Chinese temple for a great experience, ladies will be asked to cover up as a mark of respect and part of the experience, free to enter. Overall just great and another great part of Singapore to enjoy. Loved it, recomend."
,,"Absolutely brilliant, the colour, aromas, people, businesses, it is a culture explosion.",5.0,,"Love it, the food, the tailors, the money changers, the unique little businesses, the medicine shops, the whole place reeks of culture.

Pagoda street offers great prices on souvenirs, don't forget to haggle. Alcohol was very expensive, but thats just in line with the rest of Singapore."
,,Vibrant and buzzing,4.0,,"Well worth a walk through the streets! All the goods you would expect plus plenty of street food! We stopped for satay and a beer! At night it really is busy and buzzing, felt very safe to walk in."

,,Must Visit,5.0,,"China town is easy to get to and lots of fun to explore. I would highly recommend checking out the Buddha Tooth Temple. And around lunchtime, take a walk to the street food complex and you'll be able to sample so many authentic dishes for under five dollars each. I was able to buy a fresh mango drink, a plate of duck, and a shaved ice dessert for a fraction of the price charged at some of the more tourist-y restaurants."
,,Chinatown Market Complex the biggest food and market complex in Singapore.,4.0,,"CHINATOWN MARKET
Telok Ayer Square, Chinatown, Singapore

Chinatown Wet Market is typical Chinese in nature and a part of Chinese Culture in Chinatown. I would associate it of old Sago Lane where the elderly or sick came to stay to wait for the final days. Or as people would call Sago Lane the death street. By 1983 the death streets are gone and the Chinese Market was constructed housing the Wet Market at the basement, the shops on the 1st floor, the food court on the 2nd floor and car parks from the third floor onwards. It was first named as the Kreta Ayer Complex or its Chinese name Nui Che Sui Da Sha meaning bullock cart water complex. In 1984 the name was changed to its present form, the Chinatown Market although its Chinese name remains unchanged. Part of Chinatown proper is still called Nui Che Sui by the Chinese today.
The Wet Market is one of the five great markets in Singapore with its vibrant atmosphere of Chinese ethnic culture. One can find typical Chinese cooking ingredients like Chinese vegetables, herbs and spices. Here is a place to buy live fish, live shellfish and exotic meats such as live frogs, eel, and even turtles. I saw a live snake being prepared. I you want to try frog porridge a stall at the upper food court sells it. With about 700 stalls Chinatown Market is the biggest hawker center and market in Singapore.
One reason why it is called a wet market is because the floor of the fish section is always wet during operation hours. Perhaps Singapore can learn from the European countries to keep fish and seafood in chilled display sections to keep the floors of the market dry and clean."

,,Surprisingly small !,3.0,,"We were quite sad when we saw the size of China Town in SG! We were expecting more shops, more variety, more things to try! I was just normal shops that you can find elsewhere. We might not have come in the right period as there were constructions."
,,Sense of history,5.0,,"Loved it here, found the buildings and architecture far more interesting than the Chinatowns in most western cities which seem to stand out more their colour.
This Chinatown has a true authenticity and is stark contrast to the more modern but less interesting nearby financial and tourist hubs."
,,Great find,4.0,,"This is the place to get your tatty bargains from, plus there is a good choice of places to eat, we found this was the cheapest place for a cold lager.

Lots of the shops sell the samething, so you has haggle the price down. But we did notice the camera shops were no cheaper than the UK.

,,Great area,5.0,,We were in Singapore for a week and visited China town from Bencoolen on a few evenings. We primarily went to have out evening meal. Spent 35GBP on a meal for 2 with drink. Good values for great foods. China town is also great for low cost souvenirs and bits. Highly recommended
,,Always does the job,5.0,,"Good place for sighseeing - temples, architecture, food - must try chinatown complex food court. If you are to buy Singapore gifts it is place to go as well."
,,"Afternoon ,Evening Fill IN",4.0,,"Lots to see ,lots to eat , the place gets very busy with local at lunch time coming from offices to eat. A large number of shops and retailers of just about everything. I like to eat , pick stuff from various street vendor and walk rather than to be tied down in the one venue. Late afternoon or night is great and if very hungry may plonk in a venue for main meal ,quite an experience."
,,Chinatown a must,5.0,,"Visit the Heritage Museum, immerse yourself in the Chinese way of life. We visited the week before Chinese New Year so it was frantic but fun. Pineapple tarts - yum!"
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,"We did it with a street eats tour guide, learnt a lot of history and tried some local foods. Learnt about abc signs on shops, congregation areas for elders, multiculturism,"
,,Colourful shopping experience,4.0,,A place to buy souvenirs of your visit to Singapore. Very colourful streets with market like shops selling all sorts.
,,A great place to wander around,4.0,,"As with most western culture, there always seems to be a Chinatown...which is always a great thing. Lots of shopping, places to visit, and what look to be some dodgy places to eat (don't let the outside discourage you....some of the best food you eat, and very cheap).

Food and family is big within the Chinese community, and if you find a restaurant with lots of locals inside, give it a go. There is sooooo many choices, you could spend weeks eating down the street and not have the same thing twice.

Two things I found on my last trip were rather memorable....Bakkwa(which is like jerky for the westerners) and Snow Beer. Don't be scared of how Bakkwa looks...as you walk down the street, you will most likely be accosted by a man or woman asking you to try this odd looking meat...once you try(and there are lots of different types), you will be hooked. Snow Beer is a Chinese beer that is quite light to taste and when ice cold, is very refreshing in the middle of a hot day.

If you have a couple of hours free in Singapore, Chinatown is a fun and tasty experience"
,,a strange place,4.0,,I got a massage here. It reminds me of the place where I received it so coolly. a crowded place be worth a visit
,,Loads & loads of food,4.0,,This is a great place in Singapore to get great food at an unbelievably low price (by Singapore prices)
,,Modern Chinatown,3.0,,"Lots to see: shopping, food, historic sites and a tourist vibe. Unfortunately the area has been given fresh coat of paint that has changed this historic place to a modern tourist trap. It is worth a visit but it is not what it has been."
,,Excellent sensory experience,4.0,,The main walking thorough fare is pedestrian only with lots of interesting shops and restaurants selling delicious Chinese food. The lanterns strung overhead adds a really nice touch with the old surrounding buildings. Definitely try the chilli crab while here.
,,CHINATOWN.............ALWAYS INTERESTING !!!,4.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is a busy mix of restaurants and market stalls. There are plenty of budget places to eat and drink with a tremendous variety of Singapore specialty dishes and South East Asian cuisines but be wary of ""add-on charges"". The market stalls predominantly sell souvenirs, clothing and the usual bits and pieces but there are some interesting items to be found if you ask and/or look closely."
,,Wow what an experience,5.0,,"Having heard about Chinatown from colleagues I needed to experience it myself.... The vibes are great, food is great, best sweet and sour chicken I had in a long time. The merchandise was well priced for all the touristy things we buy. large variety of goods. Easy to navigate your way around and even the evening we went the roads had been blocked off for a televised event its was really well organized and you did not feel like there were too many people around."
,,No pressure tourist and authentic Chinese shopping and bargaining!,5.0,,"Personally really enjoyed our trip to Chinatown. It was clean and not at all pressured. Yes there are lots of stalls selling the same cheap tourist souvenirs but there are also some unique and beautiful things for sale such as textiles, art work and traditional Chinese homewares. TIP - be brave and bargain on higher priced items! Also if you have a strong stomach and aren't vegetarian or vegan then get there early and nosey at the food market downstairs in the inside shopping area."
,,A must visit,5.0,,"China town is by far my favorite place to hang out in singapore, the food is cheap and the hotels and shopping experience is best for backpackers."
,,Chinatown is chinatown,3.0,,"There is a strong Chinese influence in Singapore, and Chinatown definitely shows this. The streets are lined with many shops of food, durian, grilled pork, seafood. If you want great (and inexpensive) food, go to the Chinatown Food Centre which is a few minutes away from the SMRT (Maxwell Food Centre), where you can eat scrumptious food and reasonable prices.

North American Traveler Tip: Bring your own napkins/tissue paper everywhere in Singapore, especially in these food centers. They are often not available in many locations."

,,Food food and culture,4.0,,"Great food stuff as any other china town, and pretty historic one as well... so go for it, its very central as well."
,,Small and not really China,2.0,,"First: this is small area, so we cannot really say it’s a town ... no more than 2 streets. Poor quality shops with the regular poor quality stuff you don’t want to buy. Singapore has so much more to offer !"

,,Cute area,5.0,,It's lovely to walk through this area and try all the foods. Cheap souvenir shopping and delicious food.
,,A great part of this small island,5.0,,"I've only been to one other Chinatown, and that was in Barcelona. I didn't expect to be impressed with Singapore's Chinatown after being away for 20 years, I mean Singapore is mainly populated by the Chinese, so isn't everywhere ""Chinatown""? But I'm happy to report that Chinatown is one of my favourite places in Singapore to take friends to when they visit and a place I sometimes opt to go to with the family to hang out and have dinner. I like the atmosphere there.

Chinatown, aside from the expected gift shops of low priced items to buy as souvenirs, is also full of places to eat from the local dishes to seafood specialities with the abundant cafes and restaurants. One inevitably will find something ""cute"" to purchase or a new dish to try. The young love Chinatown as the shopping on offer extends to shoes and clothes. Those who visit Chinatown are not all tourists and that's what great about it. There are performances every now and again by local young artists and other interesting events organised including the ""50cents week"" where all the food at participating outlets are priced at 50cents!

There is a hawker centre feel to the eating section at Chinatown and one is spoilt for choice in terms of food options from all over Asia. Beer is cheap and you get to choose to eat out in the open (sheltered area) or inside the cafes/restaurants.

Chinatown does get busy during months preceding the Chinese New Year and the Autumn Festival and lavish parades are held to mark these celebrations. The decorations are delightful during these months.

I'd definitely recommend a visit. It's location is also very central and easy to get to with the Chinatown MRT right in the heart of it. From Chinatown, you can get to other ""must see"" areas within walking distance or quick MRT stop away. You've not quite seen Singapore if you've not done Chinatown."
,,Colourful Chinatown,4.0,,"This is one of the best place to experience the culture in Singapore. I especially love the colourful Peranakan shop-houses, the food street full of yummy local delights and watching groups of elderly residents sitting around playing games of Chinese chess."

,,50th Bday Layover,4.0,,"Much like most other China Towns in other US cities, but we did go to the market place to enjoy more authentic food and atmosphere than I’ve ever experienced in the Us."
,,Chinatown the best place to visit little China,5.0,,"You can feel like in China, you can try good and very cheep food but the Durian fruit is very expensive there so if you want to try, try elsewhere. The price started from 20 S$ for small ready to eat frout but I tryed for 5 S$ Later on I found fruit market and I had really good, ripe and tasty Durian -delicious"
,,China Heritage in Singapore,5.0,,A great experience as i shopped along the streets market of Chinatown. All types of merchandise especially family wares can be found at affordable prices. Food courts are also in place.

,,Rich heritage of CHina,4.0,,"This was quite a wonderful experience to see and walk through the streets of Chinatown. The first thing which can see the street market.

,,Spent a great morning in Chinatown,4.0,,"Had a great morning wandering around Chinatown, made many purchases for myself and family. The food markets are very interesting, lively and fun to see all the fresh ingredients. Lunch was also lovely overlooking the busiling streets."
,,"Crowded, touristy and cheap",3.0,,"China town is always a tricky place to visit. There are some hidden gems, and around the edges are some amazing restaurants and shops. In general though the goods are cheap, plastic and touristy. It’s not the best representation of Singapore... but if you want to bulk buy gifts and touristy bits and pieces you’ll find them there. There aren’t enough toilets."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Plenty of shopping malls and smaller market type stalls. Very popular and colourful place. Felt very safe wandering about and under no pressure to buy.
,,Good for cheap souvenirs!,5.0,,Whenever I visit Sgpore I always come to chinatown to buy the famous Sg keychains. The cheapest ever to buy the 32 pcs. keychains. You just have to shop at the right place. Walk around the town and you will find a lot.
,,Interesting,5.0,,So much to see and do! Food was awesome and if you’re into electronics this is the place to go! Something for everyone!

,,great to eat,5.0,,"Great place to visit, so many places to eat including in the streets. Not expensive and so many choices. As with everywhere else in Singapore beer is not cheap but has to be seen."
,,Chinatown lovely place,5.0,,"We walked to Chinatown from our hotel near Robertson quay so lucky enough to see all of Chinatown and not just from coming out of the MRT. It’s got a feeling of being a lovely community with friendly people and amazing smells especially around the food area. Shopping is hard to get away from as they have lots of market stalls in the people’s market. It has around 5 floors ranging from beauty to clothing. We sampled a back massage in the people’s market. My partner said his back has never cracked that much before and although felt like he’d be fighting with Mike Tyson he felt 100 times better. I had a shoulder massage 30mins but felt like I could have stayed all day.

The stalls are repetitive but each have their own style and techniques to draw you in. Friendly people who just want you to buy from them. Felt very safe walking round on my own as my partner was being stood on by a little Chinese man.

There was one section I stayed away from which was hidden away round the back (ladies offering more than just a message )

We ate in a restaurant for lunch which was reasonable. If you want to walk round the religious buildings take a shawl (can buy them from stalls close by for $2) or wear a t-shirt as they don’t allow uncovered shoulders. Beautiful historic buildings.

Good for Souvenirs and looking round a little heritage of Singapore."
,,Must do part of Singapore,4.0,,"This is really a part of Singapore that must be on everyone’s itinerary. It’s part of Singapore’s heritage. The other reviews really confirm the scenes, noise, smells, the bustle (so long as you are not too early in the morning) the stalls, the tat, the food, the tailors, the temples, etc etc. Enjoy!"
,,Shopping street,4.0,,One of the shopping places of Singapore. The best part is it is economical . One should definitely visit.
,,A great stop in Singapore!,5.0,,"My friends and I came here during our couple days in Singapore. Was a worthy stop! The area was decorated for the Chinese New Year and it was beautiful, even through the rain. The market was really nice and we got some cute souvenirs. This is also the area with a couple Hindu and Buddhist temples that are worth a visit."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"Chinatown is a street market where you can buy street food shock is lovely or souvenirs to bring home, some of the shops are ok, some are full of tat and the Indian shops can be annoying as they follow you and keep asking you to go inside as they want to make purchase made to measure clothes and a simple no does not always work so I just told them I was going home the next day. I would say it is worth a visit though for the experience and the food."
,,So busy,5.0,,We arrived fairly early off the MRT. Already butling and at times chaotic. Loved the atmosphere. My teenagers enjoyed the stalls and got some great buys after haggling. The area itself was really interesting. Worth looking out for the michelin star hawker restaurant.

We were mostly happy to discover new places that the newly opened Thai restaurant on Smith street and another place to drink really great craft beer from around the world on 335 Smith Street. Little Creatures brewery was also our favourite find. China Town is a never to miss experience and needs a bit more exploring to didcover your favourite spots.
,,Colourful Visit,5.0,,"What a beautiful place to visit, lots of food, gift shops at bargain prices too. The fresh juices were incredible. I would recommend getting your gifts from Chinatown.

Tens of shops selling anything you want (whatever you need it or not), food outlets, import export trading offices, travel agents etc

,,"Shopping, shopping, shopping",4.0,,So many large shopping centres. Both high end designer shops and bargain shopping. Choose which you’re after as each are housed in different centres. Or if you’ve got time visit them all.

,,One of the best parts of Singapore,5.0,,"Understandably Singapore continues to modernise as it shifts its economy and that reflects In the new building over recent times.

It's well documented that it's lost many of its older areas and the urban edge that it may have had.

Chinatown remains an area where you can still see that older more gritty urban feel that I think is an attraction to many visitors.

Certainly to the many Grand Prix visitors this seemed to very attractive. Certainly my wife and I found it much more attractive than the new Orchard Rd shopping malls or the shops at Marina Sands"

There are lots of shops there where you can buy the local Malaysian clothes, pashminas,fridge magnet, there are food shops all over although we didn't eat there but we bought souveniers. There is a metro line in Chinatown too and we explored the metro in Singapore by hopping on it to city hall. There are gold shops too in Chinatown where they sell 14 / 18 carat gold I'm told. We did go into the gold shop as well."

,,One stop souvenir shopping,3.0,,"Practically every major city has a Chinatown showcasing the cuisine and crafts of the Chinese diaspora. Singapore is no different, with the exception that a visit will uncover not just all things Chinese but also the food and places of worship of other ethnic groups. Chinatown in Singapore is a cacophony of accents, a place where people of diverse ethnic origins work or live.

First time visitors to Chinatown will find not just Chinese temples but also one of the city's oldest Hindu temples. Among the Chinese temples, the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is the biggest. Repeat visitors to Singapore head to Chinatown for a fuss free meal at the world's most affordable Michelin starred restaurant - the self serviced Chef Chan's along South Bridge Road, where a plate of braised chicken rice or noodles costs just S$4.80 (US$3.50). Chinatown is a one stop place for souvenir shopping, from city magnets and keychains to T shirts and merlion ornaments. Visitors also head to the famous Lim Chee Guan pork jerky shop on the ground floor of the archaic People's Park Shopping Centre.

If you happen to be in Singapore during the Lunar New Year (usually in end January of early/mid February) or the Mid Autumn Festival (end Sept or early October), do visit Chinatown in the evenings. The stretch of Eu Tong Sen Street and North Bridge Road between Dorsett Hotel and Chinatown Point will be brightly lit with colourful lanterns. The themed displays change every year and every Chinese festive season draws locals and tourists alike to Chinatown to view the light displays. Instagrammers will have a field day."

As soon as we left the subway station we arrived at a food court that sold all kinds of amazing food for very good prices. There were lots of stalls and shops selling fantastic souvenirs.

,,Where History is apparent,4.0,,"This is like Hoi An of Vietnam, only better, cleaner and more preserved.

The streets are narrow yet the buildings are streamlined and very neat. Yes they are functional buildings. There are shops of all kinds. Just exploring and walking is the best way to appreciate China Town. It’s like another era. The good thing on our visit was, there were very few people around so I didn’t see it as an exploited area that tour guides are bringing people to flock at.

They also have a Chinese temple and all these wall arts depicting the way of life or manner of living.

It’s indeed something to see when in Singapore."
,,Good to buy Souvenirs,4.0,,"Went to Chinatown by MRT, which took us to the main shopping area. Bought a lot of souvenirs from here as they were reasonably priced. The kids enjoyed eating tasty curry puff from a small vendor along the way."

,,It is getting more commercialised for tourist.,3.0,,"As a person who stayed in Singapore, we still visit Chinatown from time to time. It may be more commercialise to attract tourists, but this place still has its special charms for the locals.
Chinatown is full of special local delights, it was a shocked to me when I first came to Singapore to eat at hawker centres (local food stalls), but it is a pleasant surprise of the wide variety and quality of food available.
Some of the best Singapore food stalls are actually hidden in these local food stalls. But do note that it can be crowded during meal times, as it is a popular place for the locals to head to for meals.
Souvenir shopping can be a little expensive for the quality of items they are selling there. But it is still a good place to explore."
,,Full of character.,4.0,,"A must see in Singapore is Chinatown. Loads of culture, sights, aromas and sounds. Great shopping too."
,,Odd Visit,2.0,,"Living in a chinese environment ourselfes in Hong Kong it is a bit odd to visit Chinatown in Singapore.

This part of the city was visited at night as it looks more interensting with lights.

If offeres street markets with the same cheap - and likely fake - stuff as the comparable Night Market in Hong Kong. Nothing new there.

The streets are lined with restaurant of which we entered one just to find out that t was overpriced and we would have got better food back in Hong Kong.

All in all quite tourist trappy and not quite worth it - for us at least."

,,Not sure if I would go back.,3.0,,"Admittedly Chinatown was undergoing renovations when I was there. What I did see, did not Impress me. Couldn’t wait to,get,out of there."
,,Great for tourist shopping!,5.0,,"Chinatown is Singapore’s premium destination for tourist shopping. Goods are largely from China and are of Chinese style, however prices are (understandably) higher than one would expect to pay in Chinese Cities. Pretty much every style of traditional Chinese craft can be found here. Tourist trinkets of Singapore are also in plentiful supply. Prices for these goods are very good. Bargaining not required in the vast majority of cases. Personal favourite street to shop — Pagoda Street
A wide variety of food options are available on the Temple Street Food Market."

,,Chinatown!!!!!!,4.0,,Great place to walk about and take in the Chinatown vibes. Not much for fussy little eaters (western kids) but we sat in some shade for some drinks to cool off. Bathroom facilities were not very nice so take some tissues with you and some coins. Temples are nice to visit and welcoming with scarfs to cover shoulders and knees.
,,Best Place to visit here during September 2018,5.0,,"A traditional festive "" Mid Autumn Festival"" or "" Moon Cake Festival "" celebrating across whole Singapore. One of the best place to visit during this period. Whole Chinatown will be well decorated with creative lanterns. There will be a lot of traditional culture food, beverage, activities and shows. It will be a memorable and wonderful trip. Do visit here during evening, the lanterns usually light up after 6:30pm. Great weather during this month (SEPTEMBER).

,,Surprising colorful district,5.0,,"If You have a few time, suggest to reach it by taxi: it'll cost max. 5 USD fm Fullerton/Marina Bay areas.

,,Electronic Store in Singapore's China town - Buyer beware,1.0,,Just want people to be aware of E-Lifestyle Connect electronic store in China Town that demonstrates misrepresentation bordering on mistruths and lies. We were unfortunately the victims of electronic goods reported to be top of the range and most current but were not and charging 3 times the going rate and claiming that this better was the legitimate price. Visit this store at your own risk.
,,Certainly colourful,4.0,,"We chose to go here latish in the afternoon. Still very crowded with people. Very exciting place to visit and just watch the activities around you. Plenty of bargains to be found and certainly lots of touristy things to buy. I reckon it is a must go see and just wander for sometime, always something exciting to look at. Some stallholders a bit persistent but its like a market so one kind of expects that."
,,Colorful and exciting,4.0,,"The first time we came here it was evening, the Chinese lanterns were lit up and an opera was on in the outdoor courtyard. If you're after touristy stuff or are on a budget, this is a great place to shop as you can wander from one shop to another and grab some great stuff. There's a big undercover plaza as well, with lots of stalls. We found a department store in a street that had clothes on sale. There are heaps of places to eat, in the food stalls or in restaurants, but the smell of Durian can be off-putting. The tooth temple is a must see and it's free to get in. The subway stops right underneath and there's a taxi rank outside the Chinatown sign. You can catch The hop on hop off duck and hippo bus at the bus stop across from the Indian Temple in South Bridge Road. Be warned, the toilets are not great and you need to take toilet paper into the stall with you."
,,Singapore - China Town,3.0,,Stores open quite late. We went in the morning and could not see a lot. Need to go from mid-day into evening to see the activities.

,,Worth seeing all the hustle and bustle!,4.0,,"Chinatown starts by Clarke Quay so if you are in the area, you can just walk there. There is a lot happening in terms of shops, stalls, food etc. You can also visit several temples in the area and then connect your trip to another close by area.

,,Good place for bargains,4.0,,Nice place for an evening stroll and a roadside meal with a drink. Good bargains at the street market.

,,Great fun,4.0,,Lots of shops for those after a bargain!!? Nothing expensive but fun. Bustling with people but never felt uncomfortable. A wonderful half day can be spent here
,,Not a must see,2.0,,We have been quiet disappointed. There's no need to go there if you ever been to China - the real thing is much better. Maybe it's worth a visit if you've never been to China before.
,,Cheap Touristy Shopping,3.0,,Singapore has areas demarcated as per the communities settled in that area. Chinatown hosts a lot of China related activities through out the year and is a spectacle particularly during the Chinese New Year celebrations. On an average day tourists can shop here for some cheap gift items. Don't forget to bargain though.
,,Disappointing,2.0,,Unpleasant street walk. Shops are not nicely welcoming. Streets are not clean. Only partial shaded so not fun during day time.
,,great vibe,5.0,,we first visited chinatown on our city bike tour and decided to go back on night for dinner so we caught the Mrt which was quick and easy and had dinner which was reasonly priced the. looked around the shops/market type stalls it is worth visiting

,,"A-mazing puzzle of all things old and new, young and old and for foodies",4.0,,"Singapore Chinatown is a food haven, there are 4 to 5 famous local hawker food centres within walking distance that serves cheap and reasonable price. It's also irony that you find a Chinese temple, Hindu temple and a mosque side by side of the main road of South Bridge Road. I would recommend a visit during the Lunar Chinese New Year period to absorb the atmosphere of the environment. If not any day is a good visit for the great variety of local food. Be prepare, it's hot and humid during the day and it's easily accessible by public transport. Lots of Chinese restaurants and backpackers here so don't expect any high end or luxury service. On the other side of the road, there's a more happening Club St and Keong Siak Rd for you to explore the more happenings at night."
,,Singapore Chinatown,5.0,,"A visit to Chinatown. Vibrant and large. It’s orderly like the rest of Singapore. Make sure you visit the Chinese heritage centre. Comes with a podcast tour.

Highly recommend."
,,Lots to Buy and Eat,5.0,,"Easy access to China Town is by their underground train. There are lots of market stalls for that cheaper souvenir or gifts. Has ""Food Street"" with great food for lunch or dinner. Also nice cold beer. Worth a visit if you are after souvenirs or want some nice food."
,,Don't buy Electronic goods here!,4.0,,"Chinatown Singapore is a lovely vibrant place with an interesting history and good food.....but, DON'T BUY ELECTRONIC GOODS HERE!
We recently visited and bought goods from E-Lifestyle Connect. Very good Salesman who lies effortlessly and confuses you with figures. In retrospect we were seriously conned and paid exorbitant prices."
,,"Souvenir shops, places to eat and lines of lanterns",5.0,,"I think it's great for tourists to get a taste of China and drop into the museum, temple and pick up some souvenirs. The Chinatown complex is also pretty interesting with sellers and small shops selling random trinkets. Chinatown is also great for photography!"
,,Best Place for Street Food Hunters,3.0,,"If you are looking for street food on the evening, better if you go to this place.
Those are various food stall along the street and the price is affordable.

For the anyone who is looking for the Halal food, you may double check the stall, do they have the certificate or not."
,,Facinating,4.0,,The old buildings are superb and really show you what it must have been like at the turn of the 19th century. Good food and interesting shopping.
,,Shopping and eating,5.0,,"It was a well spent day in Chinatown having to do all the the things we wanted to do plus much more. To begin with, we had a friendly taxi driver who told us that it was best to eat in the fastfood on the second floor of the chinatown complex building. The chinatown food street is just touristy place but not necessarily offer the best food chinatown has to offer. To taste real good food, go where the locals eat. And so we did, the food at the Chinatown Complex was way cheaper and lots of seats around even during lunch time. We also tried to taste durian. It was an easy waste of S$8 thrown to the garbage bin. We didn’t like it, couldn’t even swallow it.

We did some shopping too. We had good deal with a phone bag, jade pendants, shorts, slippers, scarf. We also happened to see an authentic chinese clinic, not a touristy kind, where I had my acupuncture done, as well as massage and heated treatment for my lower back pain. Well worth the S$128 that reduced my sciatica suffering instantly by at least 60%-70%.

I recommend Chinatown visit for tourists."
,,Fun Visit,4.0,,China Town is a great spot to see and walk around and take in the culture. It can be a busy place but it is good to see the various vendors and food that is available. You can do some shopping as well at the booths for local items and take homes.
,,Cheap shopping area...murah murah beli oleh oleh,5.0,,"Very cheap shopping area. Can buy 5 tshirt for $10, 4 bag for $10. If you lack of singapore dollar you can change your own country money to singapore in money changer beside chinatown heritage center.but the rate a bit expensive. I change 100 ribu rupiah to $9. US$1 to sing$ 1,2. 50 RM to sing$ 16. Murah murah beli oleh oleh di chinatown."
,,Interesting place to know the culture,5.0,,A good place to walk around and explore the area.. Been new to singapore and enjoying to explore the City.

,,Colourful,4.0,,Felt extremely safe walking around at night. Plenty restaurants and bars to suit all budgets. Stalls selling usual array of goods.
,,Variety of food from USD2 onwards,5.0,,"Chinatown is much different from years ago. Much upgrading has been done. Most noticeable are the number of chinese restaurants that seem to cater to China's Chinese taste rather than the local Singaporean taste buds. For more authentic Singaporean fare, go to the Chinatown food and hawker centre, level 2, where you have more than 100 stalls. It is also where the 1Star Mchellin Soya sauce chicken stall originates. There are also other foods that are popular. Just look at the queue. Prices range from $2 onwards. Cheap and good, better than those restaurants along the shop houses. You also experienced the local hawker environment in this complex."

You can find a lot of souvenir items in their street market and they are very cheap. They also have a food street where in you get to experience Singapore's best dishes.

There is also a temple that you can visit and experience a different culture while checking it out. You get to meet other tourists as well and who knows one of them might become your friends. ;)"
,,Mid Autumn Festival,5.0,,"A great time to visit Chinatown during the month of September because the streets will be decked out with lights to celebrate the Mid Autumn Festival. Visit the stalls to taste moon cakes - a sweet desserts made of lotus seed paste (origin flavor) and many other flavors as well. Stalls will be selling mainly pomelos and lanterns which are typical items in celebration of this festival. If you are going to the temples in Chinatown, no sleeveless or short shorts are allowed. However the temples also provide sarong if necessary."
,,What do you choose to eat?,2.0,,"Singapore 's Chinatown is bustling with loads of tourists as usual. It is becoming a 'real Chinatown "" as most of the shops are taken over by PRC Chinese selling Chinese food not Singapore food. I'm not sure I'm in China or Singapore"

,,The night markets are disappearing !,3.0,,"There is little left of the old Singaporean night markets and for those who visited years ago the thrill and excitement are gone! The finding of unique items of interest is virtually impossible and they are filled with Chinese manufactured junk !
The food too has become very manufactured and fast !! The staff are jaded by the constant turn over of tourists who are just on stop overs fir a couple of days and the hand made Taylor’s will not make you up a dress if you only have a couple of days ! They say it’s not worth their while ! They used to be delighted fir the work ! The quality of the fabrics has declined , being mostly manufactured in China.
Still Singapore still has a charm ! But raffles hotel is now surrounded by sky scrapers and cricket grounds and parks are disappearing rapidly !! Interesting that hop on and hop off bus says nothing of Singapore’s colonial history but makes a great deal about the Malaysian mosque ?!? Seemed a little unbalanced in presentation !"
,,Colourful,4.0,,"Walking by the China town streets is around the colourful buildings and decor, is very refreshing and at the same time experiencing such a unique culture was so exciting.

,,A must-go in Singapore,4.0,,"We visited Chinatown at night, and witnessed a charming and quiet sight.

,,Great atmosphere,5.0,,Plenty of eating places here we loved maxwell road for food but Chinatown eat Street is eye opening so many stalls a revelation
,,Clean,4.0,,Resembles Chinatown in other cities in chinese merchants. Has a temple in mid way. Characteristically very clean with nice street . Nicely decorated. Cheap souvenir packages. Needs enough time to spend that we did not have.
,,Walk around Chinatown.,4.0,,"Definitely worth visiting, great place to walk around, do some shopping,get something to eat. Safe, clean and pretty. But it feels like a tourist attraction rather than a genuine Chinatown. For me it lacks atmosphere."
,,For those who are in Singapore for the first time,3.0,,"If this is your first time to Singapore, this place is a good spot to visit. The Chinatown Visitor Centre will be a good place to start from.

Chinatown is full of different things to do: massage ($$$), sightseeing, souvenir shops ($$), food etc.

,,Great,5.0,,Beautiful place. But things here are much more expensive compared to Bugis. Don’t let anyone cajole you into riding a tram without paying at the company first. You’ll be cheated if you pay directly to the tram driver
,,Shopping and food,5.0,,"A place to be visited. If it's food you want there's plenty of choices. All,price ranges from hawkers to restaurants. A beautiful temple too. Souvenir shopping."
,,Probably too hot to enjoy properly,3.0,,We wandered around China Town on a hot day and I suspect the heat detracted from our experience. It would be a great place to eat however after Chinatown in Sydney and Melbourne we found it was merely ok. Having said that other travellers have commented how much they enjoyed it.
,,Worth Seeing,4.0,,"If you’re in Singapore, check out Chinatown. I was on a time crunch, so I was only able to dedicate a couple of hours there. They had your traditional touristy shops selling all the familiar trinkets. Their were also the non touristy shops selling clothing, jewelry etc. If you’re hungry, visit one of the many restaurants for a nice meal. If you’re just looking to get by until later, then you can’t go wrong with some delicious street vendor food. All of this is to compliment the lively and fun atmosphere, making Chinatown a must see while in Singapore."
,,Experience you do not want to miss,4.0,,"China Town is a unique place which has a multi-cultural environment. You can purchase just about anything here for cheaper price than anywhere in Singapore. There are hundreds of stalls that sell anything from high end perfume to S$1.00 items. This is the best place to shop for your family and friends at home. Clothes, trinkets, souvenirs can be purchased for far cheaper than Mustafa Center. You can buy your choice of food from several food courts that are scattered through out China town. Most of the places mark up their prices so don’t be afraid to bargain. You can deduct at least 20-30 even 50% from the mark down prices..

You can access China town by taxi or MRT. China town is located at Pagoda Street and surrounding roads. It is open from 10:00 am to 10:00 pm. During the night the streets comes alive with brightly lit lanterns and street lights and this is an experience you may never want to miss."
,,A Culturel Mixture,4.0,,"Along with the different types of buildings Chinatown offers a big variety of shopping places , especially for souveniers, which is very affordable and cheap. ( I suggest that the souvenier shopping can be done here since there is too many variety with low prices). Plus you can eat many different foods along with beatiful fruit selections. It is not a must see place for me but it is a good experience too see there."
,,A potpourri of sorts,4.0,,"What images come to your mind when you think of Chinatown? For me, it's the endless train of food, the shine of multicolored lights, and the happy din of conversations. Come visit this place to enjoy!"

,,Day visit off the train,5.0,,Just jumped on the train near our hotel and went to Chinatown. Well worth a visit. We bought a few trinkets and had lunch. I would go back again. Wanted to visit the Michelin star street vendor but not enough time. Kind regards Petrina Australia
,,Loved Chinatown,5.0,,"What a great place to wonder up and down. Fantastic food and little souveniers to take back home. A lot of fake goods, but still worth the look."
,,great to people watch,5.0,,Good food fun for tourists of all ages. One of the best places to get souvenirs cheap and practice the art of bartering .
,,A must!,5.0,,"Chinatown is a must if you visit Singapore. This area is full of temples, local cafes, outdoor restaurants and souvenirs shops. It can get really crowded in special circumstances like Chinese New Year or evening but it's something you can't miss!"
,,a great experience,4.0,,"We enjoyed roaming around Chinatown - which we found from the hop on hop off bus, We mooched around the shops and enjoyed a juice watching the locals eat and chat,"
,,Chinatown... worth a visit,4.0,,Interesting place to wander. Started on Pagoda Street by the temple then looked at the many stalls. Great atmosphere with buskers playing and places to stop for food and drinks. A couple of streets over is Smith Street which was mostly food stalls/restaurants. Had a great meal here at a reasonable price. Close to MRT and bus stops
,,Great experience!,4.0,,Chinatown was a great experience. Great markets for picking up a bargain and loads of street food to choose from with entertainment. There are also temples around which adds a little more to the cultural experience.
,,Great wee visit,4.0,,"Get the MRT to China town and there are lots of stalls, and little quirky shops along the streets. china town is as you would expect with lots of lanterns and ducks hanging in food shop windows.
There is an under cover hawker centre so chck that out too"
,,Good Place To Eat,4.0,,We ate here. No problems. Busy at night with shops and eateries. Street food is like in South east Asia. Good value and so varied. Possibly not as visually stunning as China Town New York.
,,A great area,5.0,,"We spent a lovely afternoon exploring Chinatown. The are was quaint, well maintained and the shopping was nice due to the wide variety which was available. The prices were also reasonable"
,,crazy,5.0,,"love the atmosphere! at the time of visit, the food fest was on and there were 50cents dishes of little takeaways to be had - long queues but worth the wait. Chinatown had a little of everything and the old facades were a delight to see. Worth a visit."
,,Historic side of town,4.0,,"Take the opportunity to wander around the narrow streets and visit some interesting shops. Although very much geared towards tourists, under that facade there are some places of historical interest."
,,Wonderful place to be immersed in the Chinese Culture,5.0,,You can see a marketplace with everything you could possibly want from food to perfume and souvenirs at very fair prices. Wonderful restaurants with authentic Chinese food and Roads filled with history.
,,Sichuan food in Chinatown,5.0,,"We went to a restaurant halfway along temple street Chilli fish, chilli chicken, garlic cucumber, shredded chilli potatoes some of my favourite dishes Nice cold glass of tsingtao beer 😊 If you like spicy food add to your to do list"
,,Nice street food,5.0,,A must place visit when in Singapore. The street food is fantastic. The atmosphere is terrific. You can just sit and eat and drink or shop until you drop. You cannot help but really enjoy being there.
,,Don't miss,4.0,,"Don't miss visiting this area if you are in Singapore. Fantastic vibe, lots of shops to poke about it and food is fantastic."
,,Great Diversity,4.0,,"Chinatown is quite large head out of the main strip to get the most of Chinatown in Singapore.

There are a few temples and some amazing architecture to see.

Head over to People’s place for great value food and some good reflexology massages at great prices.

The China Heritage Centre is well worth a visit to learn about the history and the Main Street is a cheap place for souvenirs.

Be aware that when eating in the markets there is no service fee to eat in the food court but you will pay the service fee for the same fee inside the restaurant for the mere addition of air conditioning."
,,Lots of colour and stupendous food,5.0,,"Chinatown deserves at least a day, if done properly. Start with the excellent Chinatown Heritage Centre - at least two hours - and then have a snack somewhere before heading for the Buddha Tooth Museum. Many people simply slide through the bottom and out the other side because the way to the upper floors is not especially well signposted. It is worth the climb but expect to be told to wear complimentary sarong and shawl if legs are exposed(shorts) or shoulders bare. Check out the many health stores for good remedies and maybe look at the better souvenir shops. These, I hasten to add, are not the stall down the same street at the Heritage Museum. Those stalls are full of cheap tat you'd get home and wonder what overcame you. The Hindu temple is also worth a visit as is the old mosque. Check out down side alleys for some amazing historical murals. After dark, there are some good bars and the place is very lively. Good transport connections with its own MRT station."
,,Chinatown Tour,4.0,,"We started this tour in the late afternoon/evening, it began with a tour of Chinatown, followed by an authentic dinner at a Chinese restaurant, a look at the markets, a trishaw ride, and finished off with a bumboat cruise. Everyone enjoyed the evening, would recommend."
,,An hour or two in Chinatown,5.0,,Strolled through the streets and in and out of shops and temples. Similar to other world Chinatowns but pleasant. Listened to a street musician while having lunch.
,,Great fun,4.0,,Always buzzing and there are some bargains to be had. Good food if you look for it. Superb Peking duck! Clean and seems safe to walk around and the shop keepers are not too pushy. A must when in Singapore
,,Nothing special,2.0,,"Chinatown has lost its lustre of olden days. During festive seasons like CNY, its packed with the stalls selling the same CNY goodies which you can buy cheaper at the shopping malls.
Souvenir items even at 3 for $10 are not cheap for people who travel to China, Thailand or SEA.
During weekdays, the place is quite deserted and nothing much to say about eateries there.
Also, under the hot weather, people prefer to shop and dine at shopping malls which are air-cond."
,,Colorful and noisy,5.0,,"This is a vibrant section of Singapore that's a nice change from some of the stuffier parts of the city. Pagoda Street is alive with sights and smells, including a temple, wonderful museum, cheap souvenirs, and good food."
,,Good for walk,4.0,,"Good place to walk around to taste Durian, not so good souvenirs. My advice would be to try foot massage and to visit Buddha relic temple - which are the best in the locality."
,,artificial creation,3.0,,over rated shopping area dressed up as chinatown basically cheap souvenirs and some restaurants / food court

,,‘Must-visit’ just like any other Chinatown in other countries!,5.0,,"‘Must-visit’ just like any other Chinatown in other countries! Other than the streets, there is a hawker centre on level 2 which has many affordable and nice food. Breakfast time can be buzzling and you can try many local delicacies as well!"
,,Cleaner than most,4.0,,"This is a must-do activity if you are in Singapore. Very typical of most Chinatowns in any location around the world. However, you will immediately recognise that it is extremely clean. I found most restaurants were expensive and the food quality average. There is a large hawker market on the first level of a building here although I personally prefer to walk to the Maxwell markets located about 5-6 minutes away. Smaller, cheaper and high quality food with friendly stall owners. There are a number of interesting shops tucked away in Chinatown. Recommended."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"Liked the food, and walking streets were hectic but fun. Vendor's were not pushy and a few deals to be had. A good place to grab breakfast or lunch. We fed all three of us breakfast for $20 (good for Singapore)."
,,Always interesting with good food,4.0,,It is always interesting to see what is on offer at Chinatown. The variety of Chinese dishes to select from is huge and pricing is acceptable.
,,Lite shopping,5.0,,God place to spend some time and do some shopping when in Singapore it’s a foodies and shoppers paradise

,,Eat Eat Eat,5.0,,"A great place to visit, fantastic atmosphere, great food at more reasonable prices than many other places in Singapore. If you are not eating it is still a great place to just walk around"
,,Authentic..,5.0,,"We loved to spend several hours in Singapore's Chinatown, with rather authentic markets and shops. Delighted to have a lunch in the Chinatown food street. Must see the temple, which is a kind of museum dedicated to Buddha, in several floors, ending on the roof with a huge prayer wheel."
,,Fav part of the trip,5.0,,We really loved China town. We had our lunch there and it was the best one on our trip. Loved it! Worth visiting!
,,Shopping heaven,5.0,,"After some bargains to take home then this is one off the places you need to visit, you can pick up 4 t shirts for $10
or 36 key rings for $10 its shoppers heaven plenty of souvenirs for you to take home and keep your budget intact plus it's close to the food stalls and temples so you can make a day out off it."
,,I stayed in China Town,5.0,,"Lots of venders! Lots of temples! You can buy souvenirs here; very cheap. Great restaurants from Korean,Chinese,Japanese and Indian cuisines; low to high price range. After hour late night Indian restaurants serve cheap and delicious plates for under 4$. Lots of Metro and bus lines. Close to a few other attractions."
,,Too crowded.,2.0,,"I visited China Town hopping off from the red tour with the city sightseeing tour.

I walked a little around the bus stop and entered in some shops as well.

Personally I didn’t like the experience. Too noisy, too crowded, and I didn’t like the flavours as well."
,,Great stalls,4.0,,"There are loads of cheap stalls in Chinatown which are worth looking around. However, it can get quite busy, especially during weekends. Chinatown also offers a diverse range of food."
,,Lovely food,4.0,,We ordered a selection of food. I particularly loved the fried rice. My partner sampled the duck and meat. We would recommend this place if you want Chinese food.

,,Chinatown,3.0,,"Bustling shopping and eating hub. Can be very squeeze, but worth wandering through Also built on top of an SMRT station"
,,"Great Food, Great Adventure",5.0,,"We stayed eight nights in Chinatown, and wow- I am happy we chose this area! Food was great no matter where we ate. We never had a bad meal! Massages operations on every corner offered great massages at affordable prices — we literally indulged in a massage every day after touring around Singapore (average 30 minutes message was $19 USD). All kinds of great site seeing and shopping!"
,,"touristy or not, you got to do it !",4.0,,"Been here many a time. I never get sick of poking around, trying new foods at cheap prices, great spot to blow your budget on cheap clothes and souvineers if that's what you're into."
,,Pretty neat but like all other China towns,4.0,,"If you’ve been to other China towns, this one is no different. Lots of shops, you can bargain if you want, and lots of street food. We thought the food would be delicious and cheaper here than the rest of Singapore, but it’s actually just as expensive and quite fatty and sweet for our taste. I had the chilli crab here, costed 50 bucks and was not good."
,,Busy tourist area that is still worth a visit,4.0,,"Still some attempt to retain original architecture and feel, some of it feels a little contrived. Full of shops/ stalls selling all the goods you get from HK or China but with less haggling, multiple restaurants, well worth a visit especially in an evening."
,,Chinatown solo jaunt,5.0,,"A fantastic atmosphere. Lots of items at cheap prices ranging from useful last minute items like t shirts luggage bags knapsacks phone chargers and toiletries ( if you forgot to pack them) to your usual tourist trinkets (purses wallets keychains paperweights cute figures whatever you can think of and some you haven’t thought existed either) at prices even cheaper than other asean countries! Unbelievable!
And anytime you are tired, there are lots of cafes restaurants where you can sit down to rest your weary feet n get a bite at reasonable local prices. Beer is a bit expensive though compared to other asean countries but then this is singapore!"
,,Very interesting and full of surprises,4.0,,"Fantastic experience, we used the red bus to get around and just popped on and off, Chinatown gives a real authentic asian experience and is not to be missed."

,,Chinatown Working Tour,4.0,,"We did the China Town Walking Tour which was great fun and gave us a great insight into the area, the people who lived there and the people who live there now. The guide still lives in the area and was incredible."
,,"Food, Shopping & Culture",4.0,,If you visit Singapore then you cant miss - Chinatown. It has one of the best restaurants in the whole of Singapore which suit all pockets. Chinatown has shopping stalls that cater to shoppers of every kind. You will have taste of the chinese culture while you visit this lovely place.
,,Overrated...,2.0,,"Chinatown is small, overpriced and way too clean. But then, that kind of goes for Singapore in general."

,,Plenty option,4.0,,"Quite crowded, mostly tourists and lots of shops selling cheap souvenirs. Chinese food.Indian food. Very nice"
,,Great place to stay near,5.0,,We booked a hotel next to Chinatown. The food was delicious and relatively inexpensive. Shopping was perfect for us as Orchard Road is way above our spending level. The temples are beautiful. We took a guided tour and the history is fantastic to hear about.

,,A mixing pot of Asian Races,5.0,,"If you are looking for cheap souvenirs this is the right place to look for, from keychains, cups and t-shirts, jewelries and gadgets. Another must place to visit when in Singapore"
,,China in your hand,5.0,,"Maybe Singapore is widely Chinese, but this part is purely Chinese. One cannot miss this area with all these chinese temples and people. Visits to Thian Hock Keng and Teochew Temples are a must but you should not skip Alabrar and Jamae mosques or Sri Mariamman Hindu temple. Take a stroll through Chinatown Goods street and buy some souvenirs with great prices and finish your vist with a visit to the Gem of the area, the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and museum."
,,Beautiful Place,5.0,,"Whenever I come here, whether business or leisure, it’s always a pleasant visit. I used to eat with some friends here since I was young and now, I come here because of our business suppliers. It’s nice to see all the changes over the years."
,,Definitely a place to check out!!,5.0,,This is a very interesting area to explore. I suggest doing a bit of research regarding the the migration of the Chinese and the challenges they faced when they arrived in Singapore before visiting or take a tour. A visit to the wet market and hawker stalls is recommended.

,,Chinatown Fun,5.0,,Lots of fun shopping and people watching. Great restaurants...never had an average meal here...always top notch eateries.

Do not forget to visit the Chinatown Heritage Center for a quick fulfilling immersion and glimpse into the history of the early Chinese migrants.
,,Nathan,4.0,,Great to walk around the streets and stalls has a 1 Michelin star hawkers shop well worth the walk around. Interesting temples.
,,A must!,5.0,,"There are two main attractions for tourists - Little India - which is\ not that large, especially compared to Chinatown. The Hindus moved out of the Chinatown area some years ago; therefore the oldest Hindu temple is right on the edge of Chinatown.

The easiest way to get there is by the MRT trains – actually a very modern subway system. If you just need a couple of trips buy a standard ticket to the destination you wish to travel to. The system automatically calculates the price: indeed a very efficient system.
If you happen to be a cruise passenger arriving at the cruiseterminal, you may walk to the station – distance 550 meters. A single return to f ex Chinatown will cost you 3,20 SDR.
(A taxi will be around 15 SDR – one way)"
,,Busy busy China town,5.0,,A great China town to explore. some great restaurants and really good value. The stalls for shopping are really good although most sell the same stuff.

,,Fun,4.0,,Lots of fun. Reminded me a bit of Bali only without the barter. Their toilets are horrid though. Super unclean and not maintained.
,,Wonderfully tacky sits side by side with a view of yesteryear!,4.0,,"Wind your way through the side streets of Chinatown to find a combination of ultra cheap to megabucks eateries . The ultra cheap always produce ample opportunities to watch people go about their daily business as they have for many hundreds of years ....
You’ll find temples and shophouses and all that a tacky tourist area has to offer also by way of souvenirs. This shouldn’t mean you avoid the place , it’s a sight to behold.
At night the strung lanterns come alive and you should sit in a laneway for a cool tiger beer and just watch the world go by. Don’t forget your camera !"
,,Street food,3.0,,"I Chinatown have a lot of local Singaporean street food, just take train to China town station and go direct to smith street"
,,Great food and sites,5.0,,"Wandered around Chinatown for about 2 hours, abandon the map and get a little lost, there is tons of stuff to see. The hawker centers are definitely the highlight for food, and there are some beautiful shrines and temples to check out. the people were great and always helpful!"

,,Like going back in-to the 19th Century,4.0,,"Singapore's China Town hasn't moderised like the rest of the city. You can walk around the little indoor markets and stalls, where you can but gifts at quarter of the price you would in the metropolis. There a lovely ornate temples and street food stalls everywhere. It is a bustling place but we felt quite safe."
,,"Bad experience shopping at camera store in Trengganu St, Chinatown",1.0,,"Like Caroline B, who reported a similar incident at the same shop in Sept 2017, we were tourists in Singapore in June 2018. We have been grossly overcharged for items that were not as they were described to us. This is not a good location for purchase of electrical or camera goods. We have lodged a complaint with the Singapore Tourism Bureau"
,,Chinatown Walk,3.0,,Lots of food eateries and souvenirs to choose from. Unfortunately nowadays many vendors are from mainland China and have not so good an attitude. Place have become a little too rowdy.
,,Enjoyed it,4.0,,"Reminded me of the Chinatown you can find in NYC or San Fran. Worth a walk around, we got some dumplings while we were there."
,,Was okay,3.0,,"It looks pretty and it is a good place for souvinirs and to try interesting food but as I already live in Hong Kong, it was nothing special."
,,Buzz of activity,4.0,,It was rather busy but we had an awesome crab omelet roll and some yummy buns for very cheap.The shops have the usual touristy souvenirs but the shops in the mall have some interesting gold designs.
,,Must go Place,5.0,,Best place in Singapore for Hawker food and Tiger beer at reasonable prices. easy to walk around and not hassled by the vendors. Late afternoon we found the best time to go as it was cooler and we could finish off with a meal.

,,Modern China Town,4.0,,This is a modern Chinatown catered for tourists. Cross into the housing estate and try out the craft beers in a unique safe government housing and amenities ambience. The MRT takes you right to the doorstep of Chinatown. Forget the stalls - they sell the same souveniers like every Chinatown. Move to see the Buddhatooth temple and the Indian temple for a taste of culture and diversity.
,,Flavour of old Singapore but targeted at tourists,3.0,,"Chinatown very much captures the essence of old Sinagpore before Orchard road took over. The Chinese heritage section is very good (even if some what missing some colonial historical facts) however temple street, peoples park complex can be a little overwhelming if you are not on a leisurely stroll. Good place to exchange money at Peoples park complex."
,,Nice area,5.0,,It’s a nice area to walk around in. Much cleaner than for example the chinatown we visited in Kuala Lumpur and Melaka. There’s also a TinTin store which we really liked. There’ free wifi and everything is nicely decorated.
,,Lively experience,4.0,,Definitely worth taking a stroll through. Cheapest place for souvenirs. Tons of shops and good food. Pretty big area to walk through - more than just one street. Large market area as well.
,,"Day trip with Bas, eating tour",5.0,,"Bas picked us at The Fullerton Hotel...normally a walking tour, but we were the only two so he drove us in his car.

,,A little china in Singapore,4.0,,"A little china in Singapore, recommended place to get cheap food and souvenirs. 30-45 minutes would be suffice to cover the chinatown."
,,Food and souvenirs,4.0,,Don’t miss out on Chinatown area. Great for food at a cheap price and hunting down your most wanted souvenir.

,,Old Singapore stills exists,4.0,,"For a look at old Singapore, food and bad, head to Chinatown. Plan to eat in the food center there. It’s old school! Great dumplings, chicken rice, and other classic dishes. The lines don’t lie.

The market stalls in the neighborhood were also fun to browse.

Maxwell Food Centre is a short walk away and also recommended."
,,Average chinatown,3.0,,"I dont rate this chinatown as good as say, kuala lumpur, however if you havent visited a china town before this is a good place to start. Lots of shops more than restaurants and 2 different temples that you can visit."
,,"Very small Chinatown, not a must see but not bad",3.0,,"Very small Chinatown, you’re not missing anything really if you don’t go here but it’s a good place for souvenirs, and it’s close to the Ann Siang Hill area which is a little unique."

It is bigger then Alor street even tough its smaller then dottonbury but i find this place have a unique ambience. And dont forget that u can always find some good quality and cheap souvenirs in this place. I have a chance to visit 2 of the mall this time. The peoples market has a casino in it and other stuff relates to that.
Good food, not so expensive and a good ambience of chinatown. Not the mention a good sunset view on summer."
,,Really enjoyed our visit,4.0,,"Was looking forward to visiting China town and was not disappointed. Although it was an extremely hot morning, we managed to wander for several hours. Got some really cheap souvenirs including the lucky waving cats. Prices do vary cheaper in the middle of the street stalls. The vendors were not at all pushy. Loved learning the history of the original food store pictured."
,,Vibrant place at night,4.0,,This place was really quiet during the day but at night it really comes alive. Street vendors selling their wares and food galore. This was one of the cheapest places we ate and it was amazing.
,,China Town - Not a total expereince,3.0,,"If you have been to any other China town (areas) in the East - can give this one a miss. Market area very palin, stalls selling touristy stuff of a poorish quality. Some good travel agents in the area if you walk across the bridge to the Peoples square area. If adverueres and enjoy an authentic meal and cold beer - tthe Peoples square area is a must visit and very affardable with great people around (not too much English always), but many prepared to help if required. The building next to the square also has many god foot massage places available on the upper floors. In my opinion the stalls (market area) is not the real China town expereince, cross the bridge in the opposite direction."
,,An enjoyable half a day,4.0,,"Somewhat similar to many other Chinatown’s I have visited but more enjoyable because the pestering by shop keepers was at a much lower rate than others. We enjoyed half a day wandering around having a massage at good price, enjoying a cold beer at a street bar and trying some of the foods on offer. We went mid morning and the crowds were not bad however by about 2-30 they had built up considerably. All in all quite enjoyable"
,,Cultural place,3.0,,Cultural place with many Chinese style restaurant. But tbh it's not impressed me. Not so much thing to see there

,,China Town,5.0,,you will be spoiled for shopping restaurants etc etc at china town everything is there very nice place to visit very colorful
,,Festive and Fun,4.0,,"You get a taste of China's festival mood in Chinatown in the evening. It is something worth experiencing. The shopping, the food, the streets - all add to the touristy appeal of the place. Nothing is expensive here and I think, might be one of the best places to shop in Singapore, since everything else is so pricey."
,,Confused,4.0,,"So many peoples and many shops of anything food ,gold,wood,phones & computers...impossible not fine what looking for!"

,,Bustling area with lots of local flavours,4.0,,"While it may not be appealing to locals due to the crowd, it will be more attractive to tourists. There are a lot of local flavours there, and the decoration is something new to Westerners. You can find cheap souvenirs there, and you can find lots of local food, even though they may not be the best tasting ones in Singapore, but they are not too bad either. Basically, whatever you see in the Singapore Lonely Planet, you can find it here. And there are some hidden gems, like the Hawker Chan chicken rice shop, the Lee Kee Char Siew shop, or the Song Fa Bak Kut Teh. A bit hot during the day, but there are lots of shelter so it should be fine to walk. And a lot of attractions nearby. Overall, somewhere ok to explore if you visit Singapore."
,,Tourists love this place,1.0,,"No longer an area where the local inhabitants shop, congregate and spend their pastimes. Rows and rows of pop up stores selling cheaply made 'souvenirs'. Restaurants and cafes aim at visitors. After visiting the namesakes in Australia, USA and Europe, one would be very disappointed here."
,,Good Shopping,4.0,,Chinatown was a highlight for us on our last Singapore holiday in 2011. Still worth the visit but lots of similar priced items in many shops and appear to be less inclined to barter.
,,Definitely not like Chinatown elsewhere,3.0,,"Been to many Chinatowns, Sydney, Paris, London, New York... and this falls short of a usual Chinatown experience. I found Little India part of Singapore more interesting though I might be biased because I am very familiar with Chinese culture and expected a lot more. It just seemed like a shopping mall to me, few things around it. Probably would have been best to visit it late night when they typically stay up late."
,,LOVE LOVE LOVE China Town,5.0,,"This is the best place in Singapore to let your taste buds flow. We could find something different here everyday . From seafood, meat , curry, vegetarian you name it it is here. Spicy and not so spicy the choice is yours"
,,Interesting place,4.0,,"This is an amazing place with all the food places. You can buy just about anything, especially souvenirs."
,,Love this area,4.0,,"I have been here for many times and never get bored to be here..
You can find many things here, from souvenirs and foods.
And the price for souvenirs is a bit cheap compare with the other place.
And for food ?? It is superb!!
You can eat everything you want !"
,,Good place to eat!,4.0,,"There's plenty of delicious food to try here and very affordable. Like any other Chinatown, it can get crowded and noisy. There's a combination of shops selling random stuff and food stalls."
,,Chinese cultural city,4.0,,"This is the historical attraction.Chinatown offers a lot more than just the restored shops and ethnic places of worship, such as the old Hokkien temple Thian Hock Keng, Sri Mariamman Hindu Temple and James Mosque, it’s a haven for hawker food lovers. There are ever kind of hotels here from heritage to five stare one. Gain insights into Singapore’s rich, multi-ethnic culture by visiting some of the country’s oldest places of worship, located in the heart of Chinatown."
,,Vibrant city,4.0,,China town in right in the smack of the business district. Full of colours and great food choice for the tummy. Souvenir are on the high side of price..
,,Not as impressive as I had hoped,3.0,,"I have seen better China Towns believe me - use the Hippo Hop on Hop off bus and wonder around as much as you like, but its not that big"
,,So much going on,5.0,,"We ate here twice, just because it was so great. Walking though the market, looking at the temples and enjoying the lights and great food. Dont miss this at night when in Singapore."
,,typical chinatown,3.0,,"what’s a country without a chinatown? i got to visit this place in SG again one evening to buy some more items to take home. even late at night, there are still some stores that are open for late shoppers.

it’s relatively clean with a smell similar to durian. so if you find it offensive, stay away from this place. but aside from that, chinatown is also a buzzing market at daytime."
,,A taste of the old,4.0,,"Got here via the hop on hop off bus. A slow walk around showed a great reflection on how life was not that long ago. The temple is amazing and the variety of things you can buy cheap is great. If you are going to have something to eat, watch out! if it says HOT it is! Great food at a great price. Take your time and explore."
,,WONDERFUL,5.0,,This place is great lots of shops and great food stalls. Prices are really reasonable and you can get some really authentic food (if your willing to try it!!). You could spend a few hours exploring. Easy to get to by MRT or taxi as I found the taxis really cheap in Singapore. Worth a visit
,,Passing through...,5.0,,"We explored Chinatown when we first arrived in Singapore and we were not disappointed.

There is a lot to see, but you must look up as well as along as there is loads going on above eye level.

Good variety of shops, market stalls and eateries all around and compared to the UK there were plenty of bargains to be had.

Very good."
,,A little of this a little of that,4.0,,"A must go for anyone visiting Singapore. Cheap or expensive, the good and the bad for a major tourist destination. Great place to pick up souvenirs, trinkets and cheap t-shirts for friends back home. You and have a great lunch beer and desert for 10 dollar's or you can pay alot for the same things. It pays to do a little walking around before settling in for food. Do be careful not to order without looking at the price. A beer at one place will hurt in the wallet, and the same beer right next door, you can drink all day"
,,Affordable Souvenirs to Take Home,5.0,,"Chinatown is a walking distance to the hotel where we stayed: Holiday Inn Express, #2 Magazine Rd. Clarke Quay, Singapore. Stores in this place sell cheaper and affordable souvenirs and clothes of all kinds. Not only that, if you love Chinese cuisine, you need to come to this place. Also you need Singaporean Dollars? Well, bring your money here and go to Money Changer stores, there are lots of them there, fair selling and buying of different currencies."
,,Learn about Chinese culture in Singapore,5.0,,"We visited the Chinatown Heritage Centre and wow- what a great experience! My wife was brought up in Singapore in the 60's and much of this brilliantly recreated museum/information even meant so much to her.
Entering through the tailor's shop, travelling forward in time from 19th century through yo 1960's and70's with such a great audio guide, made this a truly memorable experience.
Well worth the entrance fee and the bonus is: it's all air-conditioned"
,,"Touristy, Trinkets, and Tourist food",4.0,,"As a visitor, there are a few things one must do- Chinatown in Singapore is such. Overrun with tourists and trinket shops, there are some preserved buildings. Good place to buy inexpensive souvenirs. Pleanty of places to eat, but in Singapore you can't be more than 5 to 10 minutes from good food places. The Buddha temple close to the Chinatown is worth a visit."
,,Spellbound kids,5.0,,"Our 2 teenagers loved Chinatown, especially the live food they saw in the wet market in the Chinatown Complex. Had them transfixed."
,,Clean & Enjoyable,4.0,,"Colourful and an experience to walk through. A lot of places to spend your money on souveniers, as well as good food restaurants. People were friendly, and not too big to get lost. Recommended visiting."
,,No Occasion,4.0,,Remembered visiting during close to Chinese Year and it was nicely decorated but this time just normal. Food was nice
,,Beware of the sellers,2.0,,"While the place itself is nice, very colourful and lively, beware of the shops. I had a bad experience at DG Electronics on Pagoda street (shop selling camera stuff, mobile phones etc) and was highly overcharged. The seller made me believe that he was offering me a good discount but it was not the case. I went back the next day and managed to get some money back but he did not want to take back the product (camera lens). Better do a good research on the company if you are planning to buy expensive stuff there.
For souvenirs etc its a good place to shop and take photos."
,,Average Chinatown,3.0,,"Fun to see and walk around, but nothing incredibly unique. Take the opportunity to pick up some cheap souvenirs while you visit!"
,,"Chinese Shops, Restaurants and Temples",4.0,,"Singapore Chinatown is an area full of shophouses, restaurants and temples. If you are looking for souvenirs, bags, Chinese medicines, clothes and what not at a whole sale price, this is your spot.

The area is also a mix of old and new. While on one side you see small old shops and on the other side you will see tall modern buildings. Evenings are the best time to visit when the woks are on fire and those red lamps come on."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"there are many restaurants in China Town, we visited a few while we were there, they are reasonable priced & all were clean & the staff were very helpful & up for some fun, when chatting"
,,Food and drink hub,5.0,,"A really great place for dining, drinking and shopping. There are some great bargains to be had if you look around. Especially in the indoor markets. Very popular and friendly atmosphere."
,,Buzzing with energy,4.0,,"An eclectic mix of culture, food, stalls, sights and sounds. Maxwell food centre is the highlight were cheap but quality food can be found."
,,Miniature of China,5.0,,"This is the place where you can find cheap things,cheap food with great taste.There are so many food stall that you can choose.One of them had Michelin’s review."
,,Shop houses,3.0,,Part od the historic fabric of Singapore - there is precious little of this remaining in the bustling city. Good for a wander
,,A touch of China in Central Singapore,5.0,,"Worth a visit and conveniently located in Central Singapore you can even leisurely walk down the from the Raffles/Marina Bay Area. Abundant with eateries and market stalls, good prices and able to barter if need to. Very popular with tourists"
,,Foodies - must visit this place,5.0,,"I found China Town a worth place to visit with lot of varieties in food, cost wise quite reasonable. any foodie would simply love the place. A good place to buy souvenirs."
,,Tourist Central,3.0,,"Since I love Chinese food, I wanted to visit Chinatown, mainly for Maxwell Road Hawker Centre. Our taxi driver dropped us off in front of the Chinatown Complex Food Centre, and he recommended the 50 year coffee shop upstairs, which was excellent. Other than that, we weren't extremely impressed with this Chinatown. It seemed to be extremely touristy, with lots of tour buses and groups bustling around. We didn't buy anything other than food, as most of it seemed like your typical overpriced tourist trinkets. Stop in the Visitor Centre for the air conditioning and discounted tickets to other attractions - we bought tickets to the Gardens by the Bay attractions, as recommended by the polite and nice worker."
,,China town,4.0,,"Was a pretty cool late night visit, very cool and had some very good and cheap stuff to buy! Went to a little Chinese place for dinner it was very good"
,,Bustling Tourist Spot,4.0,,"Like other Chinatown areas around the world, Singapore's Chinatown precinct is an eclectic collection of restaurants, cafes, and jewelery stores. Throw in the multitude of gift shops all selling similar items and you have a concentrated collection of tourists along narrow streets vying for a bargain. Chinese lanterns and large dog figurines guarding the entrance to the main street provide the authentic Chinese feel
Worth a visit if only for the curiosity factor."
,,Needs refurbishing,2.0,,"As a fan of China and the Chinese I found this Chinatown run down and disappointing. It needs repainting, better signage and a more savvy eye to the available tourist dollars. The footpath is uneven. There is a mystique about China, its people and culture.The role of the Chinese in Singapore historically is not easily evident in Chinatown. Where are the placards on buildings with historical facts, the statues to great Singaporean Chinese with small flower beds and a bench surrounding them, well signposted eateries serving authentic dishes. I wanted to visit the temple but couldnt find it. I have now been to Chinatown three times and been unable to locate the temple.I will try again sometime. They are missing an opportunity to make Chinatown a feature of the Singaporean experience. There are some well priced stores with a variety of goods both Western and Chinese but there are other areas of Singapore with well priced good. Chinatown could make more of itself."
,,Place with a chinese feeling and food smell,4.0,,Ths is a place to be if you want to have an experience of tasting chinesse foods and buying some chinese ornaments etc. Just walk around and visit chinese shops and items are cheaper in price.
,,Great time exploring,5.0,,Forget Burgis St markets and just come here. It’s so much better and not as much junk. Some of the shops around here are just beautiful and they offer shipment home at a fairly reasonable price!
,,Not necessary,2.0,,Nothing much to do and see. If like Chinese restaurants you can go there. 1 to 2 hours are enough to visit China town.
,,Food Food Food and some trinkets,4.0,,"In addition to the Chinese restaurants here, this is also the location of the famous Maxwell Food Centre so make sure that you have an empty tummy when you visit!"
,,Culinary delight + market stalls,5.0,,"Great place to eat and cheaply. Many cuisines to choose from + shopping. Smith st is recommended for eating, easy to find. Great place to visit"
,,Chillin in Chinatown,5.0,,"What a great experience. The markets, the hawker stalls, the temples and the vibe. We went back 2 days in a row just to absorb the atmosphere."
,,Best China Town,5.0,,"Very clean and friendly again a must see, there are some good bargains to be had and don't forget to see the Pagoda nearby."
,,Best China Town,5.0,,"Very clean and friendly again a must see, there are some good bargains to be had and don't forget to see the Pagoda nearby."
,,Mini China in Singapure,4.0,,"As its describable in name, you will see mini china in Singapore by visiting this place, everywhere you will found Chinese food to Chinese products and specially Chinese architect"
,,Chinatown,3.0,,"Well connected to MRT, once out of MRT station you are in China town. Loads of shops & eateries reasonably priced.

Good place for souvenirs but price wise goods are available in Little India as well & many items even cheaper than China Town.

But this place deserve a visit for sure."
,,A must-visit place in Singapore!,5.0,,"Chinatown is a bustling place where most Chinese people visit either for the scrumptious food there or the great shopping outlets. It's more crowded on weekends and the ""energy"" there is simply marvelous. It's a place to visit for Tcm herbs or anything Chinese. We enjoyed our visit very much and it's easily assessible by trains or buses."
,,Great Place for foods and shopping,5.0,,"For food lovers and shopping mania, we suggest you to visit this place. This iconic Chinatown is worth to see. Besides foods and shopping place, you can visit some historical site."
,,China Town Markets,3.0,,"Spent a few hours at the markets, after awhile the stall holders all had similar items for sale..although we didn't get around all of it as it was raining..prices were reasonable, while there was some really cheap stuff too.....I wouldn't make a special trip back there,.."
,,"Great bargains, food and atmosphere.",4.0,,"Great just to wander through, browse the shops, grab a cheap meal, but try to do one of the free walking tours to appreciate the fascinating history of the area. The Chinese Heritage Centre in Pagoda St is a must!!"
,,Great old part of Singapore,5.0,,Took small children to Chinatown Saturday afternoon. Was busy but enjoyable. Had dinner at China town Seafood Restaurant and fantastic value. Heaps of things for the kids to see and the cheapest souvenirs and nic nacks in Singapore. MRT station is easy and cheapest way although Taxi was cheap as well. We visited the Buddhist temple while the monks were chanting and the kids loved it. We watched a large group line dancing and old men playing marjong. Will always take a trip to China town when in Singapore. Kids wanted to go again! Safe and interesting!
,,Tourists Spot,4.0,,"Chinatown is famous for the food street and market with local delights. The Lim Chee Guan Bak Kwa is a must buy for many of the tourists. During CNY season, the queue can be up to 4 hours!"
,,Shopping Galore,5.0,,We came here to shop and it was cheap! Great food and dine in outside to watch people passing by. Mostly cheap deals are in Chinatown. The exchange currency is also higher.
,,Busy place to do business,4.0,,"Many tourist come here to buy souvenir, careful when choosing your stuff, and do bargain when you want to buy. Many local food, but somehow its pricey"
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"Not what I was expecting, very limited choices in shops and food, not clean and basically a bit boring."
,,Introduce to chinese culture to my kids,4.0,,Was impressed with our local Chinatown's vendors who are located within the area. Selling very reasonable things to tourists. Was expecting a much higher pricing range but was greeted with amzingly low priced items. Comparing to neighboring countries that will likely have a higher or 2 tier pricings for tourists.
,,"Great food, buzzing atmosphere",4.0,,"Definitely worth a visit, choice of stops on the MRT, great value food and beer, use the food stalls."
,,Good to see,5.0,,Had a nice walk and stopped for a drink. Lots going on and great to people watch. Lots of various trinkets to pick up at relatively cheap prices. Worth a visit if you are in Singapore.
,,wonderful !!! Worth the stop,5.0,,"Good selection of shops and interesting shops too. Lots of restaurants. Tip get to sit outside, and you can watch all the movement and activity from a Bar or restaurant"
,,Becoming more commercialised,4.0,,"This was my 7th time in Singapore and this time I took my family. Chinatown is still a must see with great food. The Chinese Heritage Centre is not to be missed. Most of the stalls now, though, are selling the same things and are cheap souveniors. There are lots of $2 type shops with few authentic items. Still worth visiting."
,,Nice place,5.0,,There are lots of shops where you can get souvenier items. Food stalls are also abundant. Towards on corner you can visit the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum.
,,Amazing place with so much to see and do.,4.0,,"Despite showers of rain we were able to walk most of the time under cover or with umbrellas with no problems and had a great time. Full of all the usual things to expect in a market place there are other cultural attractions to see and enjoy. The large under cover Street Food stall area is a joy to wander through and pick a cheap and delicious meal.
Lots of fun for little or no money for the whole family"
,,A good stroll,4.0,,"We wanted to do the Chinatown tour with the trishaw ride but didn't have enough time. So we went for some street shopping instead.
Here you'll find souvenirs at reasonable rates and lots of other stuff - clothes, paintings, crockery etc. In a dress shop we even found costumes identical to the ones worn by the Singapore airlines stewardesses!
We stopped at a Chinese medicine shop and bought some oils, balms and a few packets of dehydrated limes and plums.
The street food in Chinatown is supposed to be really good but we didn't have time for that. Next time, maybe..."
,,Amazing food,4.0,,"Amazing food everywhere you go, people are so friendly and helpful even when we couldn't speak the local language they go out of their way to assist. Be sure to visit the wet markets downstairs and food court upstairs and allow plenty of time."
,,Better be there in the evening..,4.0,,Enjoy chinese food. buy more chinese gift items. massage are special. a hindy temple next to the china town is a good attracktion for me.
,,Awesome - Just Love It,5.0,,"I am definitely a fan of Chinatowns around the world. And for Singapore - no exception. Chinatown in Singapore is so well-managed, clean and safe too. Reasonable prices, good food, cheap souvenirs and most important of all, see the lives of the Chinese living here. It's awesome."
,,Its safe!,5.0,,"Haha my first mention is safe that, so many country there have many thief but in singapore you dont need worry. Theres have many things to see, and eat, and enjoy :)"
,,Great place to shop for souvenirs,5.0,,I had the famous chilly crab on the food street. It was good! This is where I got majority of my souvenirs for my friends and family. Prices are very reasonable.
,,Chinatown A Tourist Place,4.0,,"Best to browse around Chinatown in the evening when the sun is not so hot. There are numerous cheap souvenirs that you can buy for your folks and friends back home. Numerous local favorite restaurants that you can try. It is nice to take a casual walk in the evening and if there is time during your holiday here, you should check this place up. There are guided tours in which the tour guide would be able to provide the history to the place."
,,The markets are a must,4.0,,You don't need to spend too long here but a visit to Chinatown and the markets is a great half day adventure. Loads of market stalls with great souvenirs and gifts and really interesting food outlets. The shopping plazas are way more realistic price wise than places like Orchard Road and Marina Bay. The cultural aspect is engaging and overall the whole area is worth a visit. Easy to access on the MRT.
,,Evening Walk,3.0,,This area is good for an evening walk to browse around all the shops and buy some small knock knacks.. The china town food street has some interesting food options for non vegetarians.
,,nice at night time,4.0,,One is able to walk on the street at night times or when they ve the market. during day its busy and sometimes too much traffic.
,,Cheap beer!!!!,5.0,,"Great food stalls here in a wide sort of alleyway. Great vibe & value for money. In an expensive city, we could get 1ltr bottles of Tiger beer for the bargain price of $8.50. Great architecture around here & some good looking bars & restaurants"
,,A great way to see the mix of Eastern and Western culture,4.0,,Chinatown is almost gone from the Singapore cityscape but it is worth a visit to see what Singapore was like in the 1980’s. Take your time to look at he backstreets to appreciate old Singapore.
,,Found it by happy accident,4.0,,Loved Little China as its really close to Little India and ideally located if you are staying at the Arcadia Hotel near Lavender District.
,,Best Part of Town,5.0,,"From temples, hawkers, street food and shops, Chinatown is the best place to stay, eat and play! There is something for everyone and it's pretty cheap."
,,A delightful Experience.,4.0,,"Well laid out and clean, this market offerrs bargain shoppng and easy mingling with the happy beer-drinking Chinese youth. A fun visit."
,,Street food as it’s best,5.0,,Eating in Singapore could be very expensive -try the street markets for atmosphere and quality food -watch them cook fresh fish noodles rice or meat in front of you for around £3-4.00 a dish amazing flavour my 16 daughter was a bit apprehensive at first but loved all off our three dishes. Check out the oldest Hindu temple built by the immigrants+10 minute walk away.
,,Amazing visit!,5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is great, there are lots of stalls and shops selling all sorts! The food is very authentic and there are plenty of restaurants to choose from. I had a great time here for the evening!"
,,You must visit.,4.0,,"We where here for 3 days and its one of those places I think you should visit, if your time is limited I would go there on a night as the lantern's are lit up and gives it that bit extra. Food was good eat at two places and both very nice"
,,Parody,3.0,,"Chinatown has been developed into a parody of a Chinese town. Completely inauthentic, it is a jumble of average restaurants & cheap rubbish souvenirs. Its saving grace is the Chinese Cultural Centre which is an excellent attraction"
,,Disappointing,3.0,,Chinatown was easily accessed by MRT and was bigger than it first appears. The decorative lanterns give a nice ambience however Elvis blasting from a souvenir shop did make me laugh! It felt like a market with lots of restaurants where the staff yell at you whilst waving menus in the hope you will choose to eat with them. There was nothing particularly 'China Town' about the area other than the cuisine and I wouldn't return.
,,Must see,4.0,,A visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to Chinatown. We had lunch in a market and bought some very well made objects in one of the shops.
,,Full on,5.0,,"Chinatown is a sensory explosion. Lots of sound, smells, colours and people everywhere. I really loved it...my husband however wasn't too keen"
,,Amazing food experience,5.0,,"Don’t miss visiting Chinatown when you visit Singapore. We sat with the locals who welcomed us. We ordered a fish dish which came still boiling, the dish was for two which you shared. The food was excellent and very cheap."
,,Full of cheap trinkets for tourists,1.0,,A cheap gimmick place where tourists can go and waste money for low quality goods. Some decent restaurants close by.
,,Try the Michelin starred soy chicken and rice/noodle,4.0,,"Lots to see, eat and take photographs of. In many sense, time stood still in this little corner of Singapore. I definitely think if you're close by, you might as well sample a Hawker Chan lunch - the cheapest Michelin starred meal at SG $3.80. I hear the one in the centre only cost $2 but $3.80 is still cheap as chips if you ask me.

I'm not a big fan of soya chicken coz the ones I've had seem to be always plain tasting and dry. Hawker Chan gets my thumbs up. You can't go wrong on the price and it lives up to the hype."
,,"Vibrant, colourful and a must see.",5.0,,"Chinatown is a must see when visiting Singapore. Lots of stalls/markets with souvenirs, food, drink and entertainment. Avoid a weekend as its really busy."
,,Chinatown,5.0,,"Chinatown is the perfect place to buy budget gifts, it is flooded with Chinese item with cost varrying from 1-20$."
,,Full on fun,5.0,,"China town and like areas are our gomto places for markets and hawker centre food. Less tourists more fun. The food is amazing, variety great, quality stuff, hedge choice and very safe. If people are lining up for 30 min it must be good!
Do yourself a favor and hang out with the locals. My girlfriend was a bit apprehensive, the had to keep going back again and again."
,,Good only for souvenir shopping,3.0,,Visit only if you want to do souvenir shopping. 1-2 hours is more than sufficient as most of the shops offer same stuff. I found shopping at Bugis better and interesting than Chinatown.
,,Interesting and you can try new things.,3.0,,"The smell, the sounds are unexpected but quite interesting. If you are visiting Singapore you should have such an experience to understand their way of life, different from European one."
,,Good,5.0,,"Always come here to buy chinese medicine, eat chinese food and dessert. Some shops are closed on Sunday."
,,Fifth visit,4.0,,Not too much has changed other than the van eating stops in the middle of the streets. The selection options are good but unlucky for us we picked an ordinary one. Not expense so what move onto the next. The Complex is always worth visiting to see the local produce but as always prepare for a bombardment of smells. Definitely anyone visiting should see.
,,Great place to walk and explore,4.0,,We stayed right by China Town. This place is easy to walk around and there is good cheap food to be found here. Also lots of Asian food shops that I love and good souvenir shopping to be found. Well worth the time to visit.
,,Colourful,3.0,,"Has an MRT station. Quite vibrant place with market stalls and lots of places to eat, some more upmarket than others. Several main streets and includes Buddhist and Hindu temples. Nice at night with the red lanterns across the streets. Probably some good shops amongst the more souvenir type. Liked the Tintin shop. A place to wander."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"Singapore has a decent sized china town with so many souvenir shops, restaurants, and activities going on everyday. The cheapest place to find all kinds of souvenirs and gifts to bring back home. The outdoor hawker center type food stalls in china town are in my opinion one of the best. There are a lot of options and generally the food tastes better here then many of the hawker centers found around the city. Plus it looks a lot nicer and is surrounded by music, people, and Chinese restaurants like he edges.

Wishing Chinatown you can find a couple different temples and the buildings are all decorated with Chinese lanterns and signs. During festivals the whole area is even more so decorated. Chinatown stays pretty busy all day and night as there is many cheaper hotels and hostels in the area for travelers to stay for a bit cheaper in the pricey city.

Chinatown has its own MRT station so it’s very easy to get to and it’s not to far from the quays and little India."
,,Chinatown visit,3.0,,"We visited Chinatown on the last day of our seven day stay in singapore. We took the mrt from little india to chinatown . We took the exit to pagoda street and voila !! we were in chinatown, The street has small shops selling garments souvenirs toys etc . We also visitted budhas tooth relic temple and mariamman temple . please allow 3 hours to visit this area .there is a food street also there.it is advisable to go during evening so that before 6pm one can visit budha tooth relic temple and then go to other sites and finish off with dinner in chna town food street ."
,,Loved the atmosphere,5.0,,"We enjoyed our wander through the streets of Chinatown. Lots of trinket stalls, food stalls and a great vibe."
,,Everything you think of when you think Chinatown,5.0,,"This is such a great place. Wander around the open air market and purchase goods and souvenirs, buy fresh fruit, go to the huge gawker centre and try some local (cheap) cuisine. Be sure to check out the temples as well. There is a tourist information centre by the indoor market/hawker centre if you’re stuck."
,,Always good for a wander around,4.0,,"I love wandering around the shops in China Town, as a quilter I can always find something that I need. At every turn there is something to see. I have been to Singapore a number of times and so generally don’t go to the heavy tourist spots as I have been there before. Always a visit to the area on my agenda."
,,Good old Chinatown,5.0,,What a great atmosphere. It brought back visions of old town street shopping. People of all races enjoying themselves with bargains galore. Shopkeepers actually talking to you urging you into their store. Everyone looking for a bargain.
,,Amazing Chinatown,5.0,,Great place to go and do a little bit of shopping or should I say a lot off shopping.Very nice restaurants so really you can't go wrong. It is totally different in the evening well worth the trip.
,,Lacklustre and Cosmetic,2.0,,"Chinatown holds many dear memories as I spent most of my childhood years there. Back in the 70s and 80s, Chinatown was filled with all kind of activities: the lively open-air market selling fresh daily produce, numerous coffee shops and restaurants serving local and Cantonese delicacies and all kind of Chinese festive events offering much joy and laughters.

However, after Chinatown underwent a major overhaul back in the 90s when all the local residents, retail outlets and F&B establishment were re-located or closed.Replacing these old retail shops and F&B outlets are tacky tourist souvenir shops and fast food restaurants like MacDonald. Due to a hug influx of foreign workers and migrant from Mainland China, Chinatown has also become a favourite hangout for these Chinese national. As such, numerous F&B outlets catering to their appetite were opened serving all kinds of food from the various provinces. Hence, the local indigenous flavour has dissipated completely over the years as a result.

The Chinatown nowadays has become very cosmetic and artificial without any traces of the sight, sound, taste and smell of the Chinatown that I remember from my childhood days. For a first-time tourist visiting Singapore, its a pity that they are not able to experience the joie-de-vivire of the olden days at Chinatown."
,,"Ever seen , felt and smelled the original?",2.0,,"This is a mockery of thevold, smelly, dirty but true singapore chinatown. We went here many times, we live autheticity, no sanatised form of it forvtourist. It looks outside just like a museum but all true spirit and feeling has been taken away, it is a cold remain of its forner vibrant self. Pepple who admire it should have experienced it real.m. Sad we are heading for a society of technological substitutes...poor world"
,,Yeyy I got good China stuff,4.0,,A Colorful place in Singapore that gives best shopping experience without burning your pocket. Just plan sometime for shopping and hop across shops to find your perfect souvenir at best bargain before spending. Do visit beautiful Chinese temple Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. China market starts right when you step out of MRT station Chinatown and temple is just at few mins in walkable distance.
,,Best place to buy cheap stuff,4.0,,"If u want get cheaper price, you should speak chinese. Lol It is really work. If u dont sometimes the price will be more expensive"
,,Typical Chinatown,3.0,,"We went there at evening, it hard to find parking at surrounding area. At last we park to the housing area. It look like normal Chinatown in the world who sell the souvenir and local cuisine foods.
We have our dinner on that night. Taste so so. I recommended do shopping at Bugis Junction area more better choice."

,,Oke-Isch,3.0,,It's just one big street with shops and one big street with food. Nothing more nothing less. Spend one hour and you've seen it all.
,,"Food, shopping and foot massage",5.0,,Hundreds of food stalls in the shopping centers which were all spotlessly clean and great food. Lots of locals doing their shopping at the fresh markets. A foot massage after a long day walking is highly recommended. Cheapest rates in Singapore are in Chinatown

,,Another must see in Singapore,4.0,,Has changed somewhat over the years We had a great half day walking around the market shops We went early in the day (10am) as it gets very busy later in the day
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"Visited Chinatown which is on the list of must see when in Singapore. Found it to be busy and crowded but not uncomfotable. Lots of good places to eat and lots of shops selling cheap souvenirs and clothing. Some good photo opportunities of the temples and streetscape. Only stayed for a couple of hours to tick it off the list. Worth the visit. Recommend a bite to eat, sitting back and people watching. Enjoyed it."
,,Singapore and then Chinatown.,4.0,,"Love Chinatown, Always go there several times when in Singapore as you just can't beat the prices and atmosphere. Great to try different places to eat as well.."

,,Great way to spend the day,5.0,,Walked around Chinatown for a day to check out all the little stalls and shops along the way. What an amazing way to spend the day..walking around and chatting to all the merchants. Nice little trinkets to pick up for souvenirs as well. The little antique shops along the way are very interesting but don't be fooled by promises of authenticity as I saw the same thing at small souvenir shops in the laneways. Overall a great way to spend the day and soak up some of the culture of Chinatown.
,,Cheapest shopping,5.0,,"This place is like a paradise! It’s a comparatively big China Town where you have lot of small shops selling clothes, accessories, mobile phone covers, glasses, coolers... you name it and you have it! These are not big brands. You get the cheapest stuff here. You have too many offers. The same products are available in different shops so take time to make your decision and pick the cheapest! Make sure you bargain! Girls, you will love this place.

Don’t miss out on the food and beer."

,,An Oxymoron,3.0,,"China Town in a China Town. OK I have been to China and Singapore and China are not the same so don't be offended. This is one of the best China Towns I have visited with lots of things to see and do, shop and eat. We really enjoyed walking and shopping and talking to the shop keepers. Wonderful afternoon, but it is similar to other China Towns. The Buddhist Temple is a must see place."
,,Interesting,3.0,,"Chinatown with its diversity of buildings (the Buddhas tooth temple, the Hindu temple, the hawkers market and the street eateries) is a must see. The shopping is also not to be missed."
,,Chinatown tour,4.0,,"We did a Chinatown tour and learnt a lot about the history and then had a great meal with our group. The tour guide was funny and knowledgeable. Chinatown itself was a beautiful place to see and explore. Talk with locals and visit their market stalls.
Go see for your self."
,,Typical chinatown,3.0,,"Very old, tradition and expensive.. The chinatown here is very typical with a wide range of foods, restaurants, and places for guys. It is more touristic place, and the price is push up a lot. There will be another good options in small alleys. Don't buy souvernir here, very expensive"

,,very Chinese experience!,3.0,,"it is great for dining and shopping on budget! for shopping, it is almost everywhere along the lanes. tasty food with big portion and cheap price is also easy to get. my best food experience was old chang kee stand in pagoda street, near chinatown heritage center- must try curry puffs, SGD1.5 each and chicken wrap skewers, SGD1.70 each!. Maxwell food center is also great! Tried hainanese curry rice, pork noodle (with a shockingly a bunch of meat given with only SGD3.5/portion)! I just hope that the chinese sellers in Chinatown can understand and speak english, which most of them can't (?) speak english very well, although they do understand, making the interaction quite stressful. :""D"
,,Shopping!,5.0,,"Ready to stock up on unique souvenirs? This is your place! You will find more than you need for friends and family when you spend time here.

,,A must visit place ...,5.0,,You can buy lots of junk here. But there's also a good supply of well-priced souveneirs to take home. Spend a couple of hours wandering. For something authentic (and a little confronting) go visit the wet market under the building on the corner of Smith and Trengganu.
,,Nice food,5.0,,The tour guide that took us around was very knowledgable and very inetresting to listen to. He was a very nice chap.

Because this temple is very iconic from chinatown."
,,Another Chinatown in Another Country,3.0,,"There are chinatown's all over the world and here is yet another. Lots of stalls selling various items. There are plenty of places to try some food. Due to the pushy nature of some of the vendors, I have marked this place down, but it is another tick of the list of things to be done whilst in Singapore."

,,China Town,3.0,,China Town are very similar all around the world Singapore China Town reminded me very much like Canal Street in New York same sort of shops. Perhaps the only difference was the food stalls which sold many different types of foods. There are some bargins to be made but you get the hard sell from some the stall owners which can get annoying when you are just looking.
,,Crowded Full of food outlets,3.0,,Singspore's Chinatown has been taken over by PRC chinese migrants. Very pushy and good quality not worth the tourist prices. Be prepared to bargain if you buy souvenirs. Good for a short visit. Buy your items elsewhere. Hang on to your kids please. Do argue. If you do not get your price just walk away. Have fun. Better to visit in the evenings as it is not so hot and humid
,,Vibrant and colourful,5.0,,Jumped off the City Sightseer bus at Chinatown. Even though it had been raining we really enjoyed the hustle and bustle of the market and street food vendors. Well worth a visit
,,Compact and good value.,5.0,,"Felt like a great place to try street food and even with no words in common we got what we wanted and enjoyed it.
Great for strolling through small turnings and exploring.
Also has bars with the local Archipelago Beers which are full flavoured but still light enough for the climate. I don't drink beer, but I enjoyed their Limited Edition."

,,Seems like in China,4.0,,"We just had a quick visit to the Chinatown in SG, you can either choose which mall to enter since they have one for the mass and for socialites."
,,Experience,4.0,,"Nothing fancy here and always busy. Lots of souvenirs, many are mass produced and prices vary a lot. Close to the main road is more expensive than on the back streets. However if you look carefully and are selective you will find traders that actually make what they sell. The food stalls, bars and restaurants are in abundance and vary considerably in price and quality so chose the ones which the locals use, We had no complaints."
,,Quite different from any other Chinatown,3.0,,"If usually Chinatown is nick dor flee market, crowds and scents, here it is well organized, arranged and even richer than the other quarters. Different, but more or less sterile."

,,"Shops, shops, shops",4.0,,"So many shops. It's very similar to other Chinatown's I have visited in Australia, however this was much larger.

,,Another face of Singapore,5.0,,"I love the place. Colourful, fun, cheap... I always bring my friends or family when they travel to Singapore"
,,Chinatown review,5.0,,"Really great place for shopping and eating. Good food and shopping joints are near the Chinatown MRT exit A. Food options are also there for the vegetarian diet preference. Marriamman temple and a mosque is 1 minutes away from exit A. Buddha Tooth relic temple is at 5 minutes walking distance. Modest dress code is required for these places of worship. Maxwell food court is near the lane opposite the Buddha Tooth relic temple. It offers cheap food options 1.5 to 5 SGD per dish and the food quantity is generous. This food court is open from 11 am till 10 pm.The Chinatown food street is open from 11.30 am to 10 pm. But some restaurants in the vicinity of exit A maybe open from 7 am to 11 pm. There is a 7-11 shop and a pharmacy right outside the MRT exit A. One can buy breakfast items, toiletries and drinks at these places. The Singapore skyline buildings ( that we see from Marina Bay Sands Malls) are at a 20 minutes walking distance from the MRT exit A."

It's a good size chinatown with lots of places to eat. I wish I was able to stay longer to eat more.

Loved the feel of it. Cleanest chinatown I've visited. Would totally go back if I'm in the area again."

,,China town as china towns.,5.0,,"Their atmosphere is no big difference from any china towns in the world. Cheap asian eateries, hip restaurants, and useless products that attract you so much... the loud vibes and lots of people, too. However their 19centuries old buildings are very attractive and makes it more special."
,,Crazy place,1.0,,"I never liked china town in any city from london to Singapore , seen most of them , crowded , rude and many cheat so much to a level you feel the MSG substance in the air , what’s the point of going to china town of most of the food is just artificial and everyone just wanna grab your money

Not my place at all and truly disgusting"

,,Try in the evening,4.0,,The evening is by far the best time to get the full atmosphere of China town with the lights and smell of food being cooked in the street. Spend a good couple of hours browsing for bargains and a good feed.
,,Great cultural experience but disappointing!,2.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore offers a great cultural experience, but westerners are largely ignored or spoken to rudely, and in many cases, the dining outlets are dirty and not welcoming at all. This is a significant contrast to everywhere else visited in Singapore."
,,Always good for a bargain,4.0,,We like this part of town best. Busy and vibrant. Lots to see and do. Good food stalls and lots of stalls/shops for gifts for home. Increasing growth in more upmarket shops too. Rarely get too much pressure here except camera shops!! A smile and polite no thank you is enough.
,,Lots and lots of the same thing,4.0,,"Most of the stores are selling exactly the same thing, there is no originality. Products are poorly made and even more disappointing they are made in China.
Even though we bought nothing it was fun to stroll through and have a look. It is worth a visit."
,,Time travel,5.0,,"With a lot of low storey buildings , to me Chinatown there is not only one street but a well-renovated district with many pedestrian streets full of pubs, restaurants and eatery. Very clean compared to chinatown in other world cities and relaxed area of Singapore"

,,Singapore takes you to Chinatown!!,3.0,,"When in Singapore, visit Chinatown for sure. You have small shops on either side of the small street once out of the MRT. One can buy many souvenirs. Suggest before buying from any of the shops take a look around the market as you may find varying prices for the same items. Well connected to Chinatown MRT."
,,"Chinatown Great Shopping, Food, and Local Lifestyle",5.0,,"Really like Chinatown in Singapore. Great low cost shopping, art and tailor shops. A unlimited choice of food, street, stalls, restaurants. A very clean and safe place.

I like to stay in Chinatown easy access to MRT, and taxi services. Can walk without issues, a little something for everyone here. I always like to stay in Chinatown it is a great value."
,,Urbanised,4.0,,European tourists only like to visit places like 50 years which are undeveloped. That's unfair. Singapore Chinatown is upgraded for shopping spree. Nicely tidy row of shops on both side of the street. A place where one can appreciate
,,Was a bit underwhelmed with this place,3.0,,"Agree with most comments about the souvenirs available here with the night markets, however we thought the food would be amazing. There is plenty of food stalls, it a bit of pressure will be bought to bear by the ladies trying to sell alcohol. Apparently they operate on commission. We had a couple of different dishes which were nice, but not spectacular! The prices we later found out were not that spectacular either!
Certainly worth having a look and walk around, but we found a fantastic meal selection at the main shopping area called “Suntek”. The prices were cheaper and probably better sanitary conditions too!"
,,Foodie heaven- at a bargain price,5.0,,Great place to buy souvenirs and browse the markets. Wonderful local cuisine for only $2-$5 per dish!
,,Souvenirs Paradise,4.0,,"Perhaps on all over island, this area is the spot of souvenir parade. Many good items with better price."
,,Sunday Special,4.0,,China town is open early on Sundays so it is a good place to sample what is on offer while you wait for other places to open..Be wise if you are after duty free things and know the price of what you want to pay and haggle to get it
,,Great to wander around,4.0,,"Called here when touring on the hop on and off bus. Spent a couple of hours looking at all the little shops, the market was amazing, and food there also, and buddist temple, which was amazing.. Nice selection of restaurants also in the vacinity."

,,Lovely Day,5.0,,"I found my way to China Town and SO glad I did, the markets were great, the restaurants aplenty. Had a great day walking about just doing my own thing."
,,Not the same,3.0,,"I have been to Singapore several times and was here in May 2018 for one day. The Chinatown that I remember was not the same. It was a fun and vibrant place where you had many restaurants to choose fro and many, many stalls selling various things. This time round there were fewer places to eat and basically shops and a few stalls selling the same things. Very disappointed as this used to be my favourite place to go to."
,,Must see,5.0,,"So much to see, do and eat here all in one small area. Try some local food, it’s all good! The shops are good too."
,,Not a fan,3.0,,Just went here for the overly hyped claypot rice. Just ate here and did not even bother shop around the area. Same items you can find in Bugis area which I find much better

,,VERY INTERESTING EXPERIENCE TO VISIT CHINATOWN ONCE IN SINGAPORE.,4.0,,"During a 8 nights stay in Singapore in May 2018, sleeping 6 nights in Marina Bay Sands Hotel and 2 nights in Mandarin Oriental Hotel, I took the chance to make a stop by metro in Chinatown. There are a lot of small shops and restaurants everywhere. There are so many restaurants that it is difficult to choose one... A lot of people and a lot of animation of course, better to go there in the evening. I will soon post some photos for you to see how it looks like.

,,A Busseling adventure!,4.0,,"We arrived with a guided tour and the allocated 1 hour was not enough, so we returned in the evening and experienced the best of day & night!"
,,Cheapest place to buy souvenirs,4.0,,It is the best place for buying souvenirs for the trip. You have lots of shops in the hawker street selling great souvenirs at a very cheap price. Do not forget to buy various magnets to gift your family and friends. There’s also lot of food options however they seemed little pricey compared to the food courts.
,,Great for a waik around,4.0,,We spent several hours roaming Chinatown.Visited temples as well as some gift shopping in the many markets and stalls that abound here.Some very good food options here.
,,Great shopping and awesome food,5.0,,Best place for souvenirs and (fake) pashminas. Great prices and good quality items. Awesome food. Very easy to get to.
,,Vibrant and bustling with great food!,5.0,,I loved Singapores China Town. Yes there are lots of tourist souvenier shops but I really enjoyed going into them and buying gifts for my family and friends. There are loads of Chinese products to buy as well as Singaporean souveneirs. I ate in the market place area and really enjoyed my Pork noodle and Wonton dish! The buildings are colouful and I loved the lanterns. I found it to be pretty and a fun place to visit. I preferred it to little India.
,,Just another chinatown,3.0,,"This place is where first chinese community started to settle in singapore. Nothing special about it except holding to traditional chinese buildings and architecture. Otherwise, how come chinatown in a country mainly populated by chinese!"
,,Chinese restaurants and shops,4.0,,"Nice place, with many smaller and bigger restaurants offering really good culinary eperiences, as well as big shopping place."
,,Sally and Gary Damian Anna,5.0,,"China town was great to see the buildings market we love , restaurant where nice too ,it easy to get back to our hotel too"
,,Shopping shopping,4.0,,Loved the place ... lots of guddies you can shop for yourself and love ones. A lot of deals and your hands would be full of bags. Cant resist and stick to one shop... one is better than the other.
,,Didn't feel authentic,3.0,,"This place was really interesting to visit and I'd still say it is important to visit, however compared to Little India this place didn't really seem authentic at all, and felt very very targeted towards foreigners. There were too many general souvenir shops selling goods about Singapore, I thought maybe the souvenirs would be reflecting Chinatown but this wasn't the case. The food also was very westerner orientated. The architecture was good however and I enjoyed taking photos of the laterns lining the streets but I'd say all I got out of my visit was a couple of snaps and just to tell friends & family I have visited Chinatown."
,,Fun place to visit!,4.0,,Great cheap food!! Great nice people .. humid and rained in afternoons.. loved the down pours! Don’t take a Taxi ! Down load Grab just like Uber super safe they offer great history and places to go visit
,,Very interesting,4.0,,It is very interesting and a great selection of food stalls and heap knock off shops. It can get very busy by all means
,,One of my favourite places in Singapore,5.0,,"Lots of stalls to find little bits and pieces for yourself, family, or friends. Restaurants to eat many different types of food. Cheap beers (always a big plus!)"

,,Colourful Roads!,4.0,,"Singapore's historic Chinatown is a bustling mix of old and new, filled with traditional shops and markets, as well as hip stores and cafes."
,,Good fun - but have seen better.,3.0,,We have been to many ‘China towns’ around the world and must admit we have seen better. But .. there is no doubt that this is still interesting and it is worth simply wandering around the various streets / alley ways - bargaining for a ‘good price’ on stuff you probably don’t even need - at the various stalls. Good fun.
,,Under renovations but still lots to see,4.0,,"Worth it for hawkers centre and some shopping but main food street was all in construction and had no ambience like last time in Singapore 5 years prior. Little India is far better if you have to choose 1 or the other. Dim sum restaurant was good food though, cant remember name, was air conditioned and clean although they dont supply napkins. Bit odd."
,,So easy to get lost!,4.0,,So many back streets to explore. Lots of amazing cheap food from many cultures. Shopping is not cheap so enjoy the food and the visual feast. Buildings are full of history and very colourful. Comes alive at night time particularly but so much to see
,,Disappointed,3.0,,Disappointed with Chinatown this trip - maybe I’ve seen too many! Biggest problem is that there is a renovation programme in progress & it seemed like 1/2 of the Main Street was out of action. Sadly it totally lacked awe & wonder for me this time. It’s very easy to access from the MRT.
,,seem empty,4.0,,lots of shops gold food some small hostels and some cafe at the end of the road the area small walking is best
,,Quaint and historical,3.0,,For people who enjoy market shopping Chinatown is worth a visit. Historically it is worth checking out and to visit one or all of the temples in the locality.
,,Authentic food,4.0,,"take the afternoon to wander the streets and enjoy the aroma and sights of China Town. The food is a wonderful mix of traditional and modern cuisine with a touch of Singapore added.
Also take the time to sample little Arab and Indian too. Honestly Singapore is all about the food"
,,Traditional Chinese at its best,5.0,,Traditional Chinese at its best. From the restaurants to the authentic shops selling herbal remedies it was inspiring
,,Busy Place,4.0,,"Well worth a look especially at night, bustling and busy, good place to pick up your souvenirs and other things (electrical) from the stalls and shops, (get measured up for a suit!) and enjoy a cheap meal. We had ate at Urban Toast several times.
,"

,,Bustling chinatown,3.0,,"Typical of many Chinatowns, a sort of organised chaos busy both day and night with many cheapie stalls shops and lots of restaurants massage electrical and other merchants. Well worth a visit but couldn't live in this crazy place."

,,Worth a visit for the food and beer,4.0,,"It’s really for tourists and the Chinatown MRT station gets you to where it’s all happening. From the cultural side there are nice Buddhist and Hindu temples. The Smith St hawker centre has many superb places for food. You can get a great meal for just five dollars. There are also great beer locations here too, Smith St Taps, The Good Beer Company and On Tap. Not far away in the Maxwell Food Centre you will find the 3rd Culture Brewing Co. The souvenirs are a bit tacky and they are all the same in each shop you walk into. Come once for the souvenirs, but come often for the food and beer!"
,,Dirty,1.0,,"Chinatowns can be dirty. With the humid equator climate and the clean Singapore surrounding, this Chinatown is a place where you see dirt, smell stinky things and are happy when you do not need to touch something. Not necessary to go there."
,,Singapore Visit,4.0,,"Great Place, great food and cheap in Singapore. We went to restaurant where lots of locals are on line. Later found it is a Michelin star food stall. However, just cost about 2 CAD person.
Local place, where you donot meet much tourists. Food court is not a fancy place. Enterence is through a shady looking mall just behind the Budda Tooth Relic Temple. Mall enterence smells fish. Food court is on the second floor. Worth exploring, if you like to meet real locals."
,,Something for everyone,5.0,,"Blocks of Chinese food, merchants and general ambiance. We saw a dragon Parade on Sunday Evening. Visitors from all over the world walking together. Hindu Temple right on South Bridge Road.... No Hindu is not Chinese, but that is the neighborhood where it is located."

,,A must when visiting Singapore.,5.0,,"Chinatown is a hive of activity, day and night. With so many restaurants and places to eat, it is a must to have at least one meal there. Unfortunately we found the Chinese food very greasy and not as pleasant as Thai. I guess everyone taste is different. Enjoy."

,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Food, atmosphere, noise, music, showmanship. It’s all here in this vibrant celebration of life.

,,Happening place in Singapore,4.0,,"The moment you get out of MRT station, you see very colorful, energetic environment. There are lot of shops for souvenirs etc. Another attraction is street food market. It is very unusual site. Tables/ Chairs are arranged on the road and people enjoy food with drink.

,,Best food court in town,5.0,,"Chinatown is definitely worth a visit while you are in Singapore. Especially the Maxwell St food court. A whole floor of delicious food stalls, just opposite the Buddha tooth relic temple."
,,Awesome sights in the heat,4.0,,"Honestly I would have liked to spend more time here but the heat was overwhelming. I should have tried it early in the morning but unfortunately due to our schedule we ended up here smack dab in the middle of the day. Nevertheless, it was a great sight to see all the colors and activity of the area. Probably best enjoyed early in the day or later at night when the heat is not as oppressive."
,,Not unique place to visit,2.0,,"It is a clean place where you can enjoy the Chinese cultural view. It is not very large in size, so you can be there for shopping before or after visiting attarctions. It will take you about three hours for normal paced shopping to get the best out of it."
,,Yes touristy but go beyond..,4.0,,"We had a short amount of time. Wandered around the touristy streets. Fun to look in all the little shops, yes lots of tacky cheap stuff, but we are not snobby.

,,Interesting,4.0,,"We went to Chinatown, as people has recommended it, as a place to visit, whilst in Singapore.

,,Great place to eat.,5.0,,We took the teens to Chinatown to have a look around. They thoroughly enjoyed the stalls and the atmosphere. Fantastic place to eat as well.
,,Beautiful place with culture amalgamation.,5.0,,"A must see place when in Singapore. It is lively, full of hustle and bustle and right next to the train station. It has a feel of the old and new culture of Singapore. The unity in Diversity stands true for its ethnic blend of the three races in Singapore where an Indian temple, Chinese temple and a mosque is just within a stone throw distance from each other. Not to forget a great place to buy souvenirs for your loved ones!"
,,Hustling through History,4.0,,"Restaurants, shops, stalls, bargaining and temples in a busy iconic area of the city. We were lucky to be there during the Chinese New Year which added even more colour to the district as we enjoyed watching the dragon dancing."
,,"An amazingly beautiful and rich Chinatown, with a bland of other cultures",5.0,,"Chinese people make up the largest ethnic segment of Singapore. Its Chinatown, located in the central part of Singapore, has significant historical and cultural meaning. Although the majority of present-day Chinatown was built over the 1820 to 1929 period, even before 1330, there was a Chinese community in Singapore.

There are many attractions here. The major attractions include the Tang dynasty architectural style Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum which opened in 2007, the Tamil Hindus Sri Mariamman Temple which was completed in 1827, Chinatown's very colourful street market, Thian Hock Keng temple (aka, Temple of Heavenly Happiness), Singapore Coin and Notes Museum, and more. My favourites are the first three listed above.

Surprisingly, that in Singapore, which is such a ""pocket"" country and island-state, there are so many rich foreign cultures. Chinatown is one of these. The Chinese style of ox-cart-water, the colorfulness of India, and the European and American style of Dutch villages all reveal the multicultural essence of Singapore."
,,"Food, shopping and people watching",4.0,,Affordable food and shopping available. Really feels like China. Time your trip to include walking around back streets.
,,Shopping paradise,4.0,,"One of the most colourful areas of Singapore, this place is a paradise for those who love to shop. Maxwell food centre located nearby is a popular eating spot. The Buddha tooth relic temple is also located in the vicinity"

,,Authentic China in Singapore,5.0,,"This was the best, most authentic Chinese food court outside of China! There must be 25-30 shops serving wonderful food. If you’re a foodie, go here and eat until you’re tummy’s content."
,,Night tour of Chinatown,4.0,,We walked from our hotel and each night had dinner in Chinatown from the food stalls. Excellent food. Very clean area too.
,,the heritage of Chinese people,5.0,,this place is for Chinese food lovers and want to experience the Chinese culture . They also offer good massage service with reasonable price
,,Get some local advice,4.0,,"The hawker areas are great but can be a little overwhelming when ordering meals. We were advised to have the chicken rice, oyster omelette, fried carrot cake( actually radish or daikon and is delicious ) and dumplings. Chinese beer is cheap and quite good."
,,Nice to see,4.0,,"I don’t know if I would rush back but I am glad we went to see china town while here, it was an interesting way to spend a couple of hours."

,,For sightseeing,5.0,,One of the best place where to buy present or gift for your love ones. It’s 50% half compared to the mall of Singapore. And also fruits and great noodles restaurant here. You will the taste of real noodles made by Singaporean. Also try the roast duck located at the middle of China town. It was really yummy.
,,Cultural and food tour,4.0,,"Chinatown not only has Chinese temples, there's a mosque and 2 Hindu temples too. It has a interesting wet market in the morning. Huge hawker centre above the market serves a mind boggling array of food. If you prefer outdoor dining, Chinatown Food Street comes alive at night."
,,Noisy and busy,3.0,,"We didn’t like China Town a lot of the same stuff very busy and noisy we found it annoying the quality wasn’t there. The sales people were very pushy we felt pressured to buy, they didn’t leave us alone to look in peace. We did enjoy a few ales and lunch was lovely but that’s all, not somewhere I would go back to in a hurry."
,,Smorgasbord of food,5.0,,Loads of delicious food to choose from. Loads of souvenirs to choose from. and icy cold beers and cocktails to consume.
,,Interesting,3.0,,"We wandered over to Smith Street a few times during our 4 night stay in Chinatown in April. The first time my lady saw some Black Pepper Beef that looked good at one of the hawkers. We ordered it, but unfortunately, it wasn't quite as good as it looked. pics included"

,,Fun and interesting.,4.0,,"Flowers, produce, trinkets, fruit, pastries, coffee shops and more. There was lots to see and do, including a buddhist temple and a Hindu temple. We enjoyed it all, but got our steps in for the day. There was also a lot of very cool Chinese architecture to look at."
,,Final Stop on Hop on Hop Off Bus,5.0,,"Explosion of the senses - so much food to choose from - literally spoilt for choice, this was where we chose to get off the hop on hop off bus and explore - extremely worth while"
,,Mostly stuff you would not want to take home,2.0,,"Compared to Chinatown in Sydney, the Chinatown in Singapore is not as nice. The prices are cheap, but what you get is mostly junk. I advise strolling through here just to see it, but don't budget too much time for it."
,,"Best place for shopping , touristy souvenirs",5.0,,"This is a good place for shopping and also for food. Entire area is decorated, gives a good vibe. Get down at Chinatown MRT and start off from Pagoda street. Lot of food options as well. A must visit in Singapore."

,,"Sights, sounds and smells!",4.0,,"Very busy bustling area of Singapore to visit. I imagine you can get just about anything from the various traders around however I am not sure quality could be guaranteed! There are various temples around to visit which are highly decorated and worth seeing, the smell from the incense in just lovely and they are very peaceful places to stroll around. Lots of eateries around, though we visited in the day so not so busy but imagine its extremely busy on an evening."
,,China town tour,5.0,,We had a great time in China town I’ve been to a few China towns in Australia but Singapore’s has been the best very clean and the market place was lots of fun with interesting shops and people we did a tour with dinner shopping g a rickshaw ride then a river cruise was a hilight if our trip

,,Its ok,3.0,,"This is like so many oher Chinatown's in different parts of the world, though on quite a small scale.

,,Boring,2.0,,"I don’t know if we just went at a bad time but everything was closed at 5pm and it was very underwhelming.
Maybe because we had not long been in China this just seemed like a normal street with nothing special to see.
If you don’t have time to go you aren’t missing much."
,,Good food and market and tailors,5.0,,Easy to get to on the MRT and lots of choice for food from street market to restaurants. Great area as low rise traditional buildings against the skyscrapers If you want a shirt or dress made you were spoilt for choice with all the tailors

I didnt find the shopping very good until I went to the shopping areas where the food halls were located.The stalls in the food halls were very good interms of quality of womens wear available.The food in the middle of designated areas is always good also.
,,Interesting,5.0,,It's a good place to burn a few hours and sample some local food. Plenty of stalls to buy souvenirs from too. We also did a guided tour if the Chinese Heritage Centre which I would really recommend. Explains well the story of the Chinese migration and is super informative. They run the tours in various languages so just check before you sign up. It costs the same as the normal ticket - 20 dollars.
,,Tourist trap Chinatown,3.0,,"Chinatown has become a tourist trap with little more than stalls selling crappy goods and overpriced street food stalls. We fell for the food thing and to say it was disappointing would be kind. If visiting Singapore for the first time and seeking street food, head for the hawker halls such as Maxwell House where the food prices target locals."
,,Visit with a friend to the China Heritage Museum Singapore,4.0,,A wonderful journey through the museum of the Singapore early pioneers who left their villages in China and made their way to Singapore. The Museum is well organized and it is a very clear exhibition. Well done!

Very interesting and a beautiful venue."
,,How I love Chinatown,5.0,,Walking around various parts of the city - we seem to be constantly pulled into the allure of Chinatown. Amazing food
,,Great food,4.0,,So much to explore here but mainly go for a meal in one of the many cafes. Great authentic menus with good quality food and fast service. What a buzz and definitely worth the visit.
,,"Cheap products, but low quality",3.0,,Chinatown is for people who wish to shop some souvenirs which are cheap. However the quality of products are not that great. You can bargain with the shop keepers for any additional discounts. I will rate this average shopping experience. It is better to shop at Bugis which is better.

,,Cool place to go for lunch,5.0,,We went to China town only to have lunch. We found Hawker Chan and got there at about 12:30pm for an amazing chicken and rice. The hanging lanterns and old style buildings offer cool photo opportunities and contrast with the modern city in the background and it is interesting to visit the Chinese medicine stores.
,,A feel of being in the Orient,4.0,,Colourful area with plenty of shopping and photo opportunities. The vendors are all very helpful and not pushy. Great for souvenirs and cashmere shawls etc. Street food is also available. Nice to see the old ways mixing with the new.

,,Chinese know to keep their tradition,4.0,,"Located at the centre of Singapore , very close to People's Park is a strong point that every traveler need to visit. The Metro nearby and the excelelnt bus connection is giving a real very easy access. In Chinatown located the first big Chinese House (now a Museum) . This house shared by severl families, each family had her own room but the kitchen was shared and every family har hteir own stove to prepare the daily food. Many shops with souvenir offers, chinese style massage and spa, and traditional Singaporian houses complete the view of the Chiantown"
,,About As Chinese As I Am,2.0,,"2 Million Expats living amongst 3 Million Locals will surely have an impact on culture. I have to say Singapore has lost its Asian feel as a result of an unprecedented shift in its already polyglot society. The old charm has left the building but if you look hard enough, you might just find a local who still speaks with a Chinese or Malay accent."
,,Good food,4.0,,"If you wish to have a taste of Chinese food this is the place to go in Singapore. Different from other versions of China town elsewhere, this is, as the rest of Singapore, very clean. The food offerings are very varied including both Chinese and local food."

,,Melting Pot,3.0,,"I bet most tourists visiting Singapore have some experience here, be it for the food, shopping or just to soak up the atmosphere especially after sunset. I personally find it just okay, as things here are not really that cheap.

,,Chinatown not only rich in heritage...,5.0,,Always enjoy visiting Chinatown in any city. But in Singapore it is something else. The rich heritage and colourful history and culture blended with amazing old world stories adds to the mystery and charm of Singapores largest ethnic group. Dont pass by......stop and enjoy.
,,Local flavour,5.0,,"Original shophouses in great condition. Lots of Chinese health, souvenir and artefact stores. Much cheaper restaurants than in the big modern areas. Had a veggie dinner here for 3SND"
,,Fascinating Place,4.0,,You get the ful Chinatown experience when you visit this place. Visit the temple for the buddhist experience.
,,A little too touristy,3.0,,But there are several nooks and crannies that you can discover if you look hard enough. Places where locals hang out to chat or have a nap on benches. Also better eateries than the ones found here which can be a tourist trap.
,,Place for low cost souvenir,4.0,,"There are so many choices an shops for low cost souvenir. For example: Key chain, cloth bag and Magnet are about 7 for $10. The shops in the central part of the walking street offered better price, so do not hurry to buy things before reaching the central part of the walking street."

You are find almost anything that link to Chinese culture. And you can hear people talking in Chinese along the streets. It is very convenient if you are from country that speak Chinese.

This is an tourist attraction, so expect the things here might a little pricey compare other township.

It is worth a visit every Chinese celebration season like Chinese new year. The town hall will decorate the place with lantern and great for photography."
,,The most traditional place in the city,5.0,,"During our 3 visits to Singapore we have seen different things in the city. However, Chinatown was on top of the list each time. It is because of its colonial character pushed down between the skyscrapers. It is also because of the shopping for local Chinese products!"
,,"Colourful, vibrant foodies heaven",4.0,,"Similar to others around the world, colourful, many souvenir shops, therapy shops and a foodies delight. Great spot to visit for the family"
,,Still magical,4.0,,"Chinatown continues to have the nice family atmosphere since our last visit 6 years ago. Of course it has the takky Chinese stuff, cheap souvenirs and somewhat tamed hawkers. They have done a good job of cleaning the place up, but at the same time keeping the essence of the place. Important to recognize the Chinese influence of a country that is intrinsically worried that their Chinese population doesn’t dwindle in comparison to Malays, Indian and other nationalities. Chinatown gives you that feeling of being in a multicultural island. Worthwhile to get some local coffe (koppi) with the different names based in amount of sugar and milk. A good day out with the family."
,,Come during Chinese New Year!,5.0,,"As a local (and Singaporean Chinese) I head to Chinatown often - in my opinion, the best time to go is between mid-January to late February, as that's when Chinese New Year tends to fall, and that'll be when you'll really see Chinatown spring to life.

It's hideously crowded during this period (especially at night, when you'll find stall after stall selling tidbits and decorations for Chinese New Year) but if you're game to spend a good three hours or so fighting against the crowd of equally sweaty bodies, then pack light! It's not really everyone's cup of tea, but I promise it's a good experience."
,,"If you searching for souvenir and food, here the right place",4.0,,"You can find anything about food and souvenir, especially chinese food, there are a lot of food store and souvenir here. The way to get there so easy, it Near by chinatown mrt station so you would feel free come from anywhere."

,,Pleasure trip,5.0,,Fabulous place full of colour people great shops atmosphere and restaurants.Loved walking around it all. Beautiful merchandise in shops.
,,Large liverly Chinatown,4.0,,Chinatown covers a large area with many streets filled with restaurants and food and gift shops. Many of the buildings are colourfully painted and lanterns hang above some streets. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is well worth a visit while in the area.
,,A hive of activity.,5.0,,You can tell the restaurants worth eating at. The ques are a mile long. So much to see and do. Loved the fruit stalls near the peoples area (cant remember the name but its at the MRT). So many eating establishments. Loved the atmosphere. There were also little shows happening in areas as well. Really worth spending a couple of hours wandering around this area.

Interesting to see some of Singapore’s old heritage buildings.

A good place to visit."
,,Interesting but not special enough,3.0,,"Chinatown will be attractive to a lot of people, in search for ""cheap"" stuff. Just not my cup of tea: too touristic, shop owners a bit pushy, not authentic enough. I guess I'm a bad tourist when it comes to places like this"

,,Heart of Singapore,4.0,,It looked very clean and lot of shops selling souvenirs and food. MRT station there made it very convenient to visit. Mei Heong Yuen dessert shop (opposite McDonalds) selling traditional Chinese dessert is worth a try. There is a buddhist temple in chinatown which is worth a visit. The monks were chanting prayer inside and I was informed not to take pictures once inside the temple. I found many clicking pictures inside and nobody stopped them. A good example of Buddhist tolerance. There is a Hindu temple and a muslim masjid in the same street. We really felt good spending few hours in Chinatown.
,,The Buzz of life,5.0,,If in singapore you must visit Chinatown and have a meal in one of the many restaurants available. Stalls selling all you need abound.
,,Like other Chinatowns,3.0,,"I have seen Chinatowns in many cities, and this one isn't particularly notable. I don't know if it was typical, but it was incredibly crowded on the day we visited, which made it less enjoyable, particularly because there were a lot of people smoking and you couldn't get away from it. On the plus side, it feels perfectly safe since it's Singapore."
,,A must to visit Chinatown,5.0,,"We enjoyed the smells, the Chinese food, the market stands and the atmosphere. It's really a must to walk through Chinatown."
,,The heart of Singapore,4.0,,"When I lived in Singapore, it felt to me that Singapore as a whole is one giant Chinatown, and I didn't pay much attention to the area known as Chinatown. On this visit, however, while on the search for some good food, I found myself in Chinatown with some time on my hands. I was pleasantly surprised to see that there are several historical markers full of information about the area, and it was a wonderful and educational experience. The preserved buildings also added to the sense of history of the place, and the informal self-guided tour was better than if you saw the same things in a museum. I would recommend spending a few hours here to know more about Singapore's history."

There are many cheap places to eat local Chinese food as well as some excellent cafes and bars serving quality western food and drink. Worth visiting are the Sri Mariamman Hindu temple and the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, and there’s even a large Methodist Church nearby as well. If you’re lucky, you might catch some line dancing / exercise classes in the square outside the Buddha temple. For beautifully restored and painted houses with shutters, walk around the Tanjung Pagar district, especially around Duxton and Kwong Saik Roads. And for bars and night life, you can’t go past the aptly named Club Street and Ann Siang Rd. Also, don’t miss the beautiful wall mural of early Chinese life in Singapore along Amoy Street.

,,An atmospheric diversion,4.0,,"I love the fact that Chinatown nestles in such a modern city that towers above.

Dwarfed by modern skyscrapers, it is an atmospheric area full of quirky streets, old temples and markets selling all manner of weird and wonderful items.

,,Busy markets for food and souvenirs,4.0,,Some really cheap souvenirs and ‘food street’ has lots of options to eat. At the moment (beginning April) there’s a lot of construction there so the full effect was taken away. A nice stroll in the evening with lights and lanterns.
,,"Seen it once, seen it 1000 Times.",3.0,,I’m quite surprised how many amazing reviews Chinatown received seeing as it is very very average. The stalls are the same you’d find in any china town but more expensive and with a few more rude sellers. And each stall sells the same stuff! The decorations and buildings are beautiful but Overcrowded for sure and not worth more than 15 mins of your day.

,,A bunch of restaurants and shops. Just like Chinatown anywhere else,2.0,,"Almost every big city has a Chinatown right? So this is Chinatown in Singapore. There’s a lot of different styles of Chinese food, some Shao Kao bbq places and lots of stores selling junk. It’s better than some chinatowns and not as good as others. Gave it a 2 rating because it is only an average tourist trap Chinatown...only about three times more expensive than it needs to be. And I’m not down on tourist Chinatowns it’s usually one of the first places I check out when I get to a new city, even a Chinese city! Just wasn’t too impressed with Singapore’s version."

Good for a walk around and the food was delicious and well priced very authentic dishes
,,Love Chinatown,5.0,,"Visited Chinatown in several countries and will have to say that Chinatown, Singapore is our favourite. During our 12 day stay in Singapore, we went to Chinatown at least 5 times. You will be spoiled for choice when it comes to dining. The Hawker Centre serves great quality food at very cheap prices, there are also plenty of other restaurants too choose from. Food street also offered a great mix of restaurants and street vendors in the one place.If you’re after cheap or good quality souvenirs then this is the place to go as well.

There are several amazing temples in the immediate are to see which also welcome visitors.

Chinatown is easily accessible by using the MRT, simply get off at Chinatown station and start exploring."
,,Overwhelmed by actual mainland Chinese,3.0,,"I know this ironic - but over the years, Chinatown in Singapore has become more like actual China with its range of mainland Chinese eating houses and shops.

For the tourist from the west, this may not be immediately obvious to you as the cultural nuances are hard to differentiate.

Some parts of Chinatown are still more local Singaporean Chinese in flavor. If you'd like to eat like the locals, you should go to the second floor of the Chinatown Complex Food Centre (it's on level 2), there's a wet market in the basement of that building.

The rest of Chinatown (shophouse rows and outdoor dining) are really just meant for tourists, and so are the prices."
,,Pickpocket attempt,4.0,,"I visited Chinatown during a very crowded Chinese New Year. As I neared the Hindu temple, a man jabbed my abdomen. My instincts told me it was a diversionary action and there was an accomplice trying to get my backpack. I pivoted away from the assailant and a possible accomplice. The man raised his open hands and we both walked away. Minutes later, I realized my pack strap had been ripped off the base of the pack. I never saw the accomplice and never felt the strap ripping off

Despite this incident, we had a wonderful time and enjoyed the Hindu and Buddhist temples. My wife purchased some cheap souvenirs and we enjoyed lunch at a large shopping center. I would not hesitate to return to Chinatown again but need to rethink carrying a backpack and looking like a tourist. There was nothing of value in the pack but the thief didn't know that."
,,Busy Place.,4.0,,Lots of shops and the original chinese shops where family lived upstairs. Many restaurants . Had one of our best asian meals there..
,,Nice area,5.0,,"We visited here on 3 different days. We did the China town walk, taking in the 2 temples and the Kopi and toast in the morning.
We then returned on 2, separate evenings and enjoyed the street food mkt and live music on Saturday night and the Michelin star hawker stall and beer on the Monday night.
A great place to wander around and look in the stalls or relax with a beer and watch the world go by."
,,Lost a lot of it character,2.0,,"Lots of building work going on in Chinatown at the moment which looks to be continuing for some time, the refurbishments have left blank spaces and the character has suffered Try Arab street in Singapore ( much nicer)"
,,Changed a lot,3.0,,Last time i was here was 25 years ago. The development changed a lot and the items available is quite affordable and of cheap rates. However they are lacking of halal food at the areas.
,,History,4.0,,I do like to visit This place each time we come to Singapore. Nice to se the historical building and decoration Chinese style.
,,Charming and busy,4.0,,Be mindful that the shops here don’t open before 9; it would be best to wait until 10am or so. The heat can be nearly unbearable so make sure you bring water and take breaks. There is a bathroom at the rear of the largest temple across from the Visitors Center.
,,Vibrant and bustling,5.0,,"We had a tremendous time exploring Chinatown in Singapore. From the Hindu temple and the Buddha tooth temple which are both spectacular to the alleys with stalls selling all kinds of trinkets and souvenirs - it was all amazing. While there is clearly a lot of tourist traffic - it did not feel ""fake"". The wet market was incredible with all kinds of live and recently caught specimens on display and the hawker center was full of stalls selling authentic Chinese-Singaporean fare."
,,Fun adventure,4.0,,We enjoyed walking around and looking at all the shops and dinning locations. Some beautiful temples are also available to see and I would highly suggest to go inside.
,,Such a huge place!,5.0,,This chinatown is affordable food heaven with super cheap massages. Make sure u walk around for massages because pricing differs. Very cheap drinks. They also have hawker chan Michelin star stall and restaurant. Also visit lititle India via train!
,,Always A Fun Experience,4.0,,"Like Chinatown in most cities, Singapore's Chinatown has lots of market style shops and cafes to delight. A lot of fun"
,,Spend a Day,5.0,,"This is, by far, one of the most interesting days we spent in Singapore. There are numerous shops, a couple temples and a different lifestyle to see. Don't miss eating a meal at one of the hawker areas and definitely see the Heritage Center."

I went to Peoples Park and a local market on Smith Street which was recommended by a local driver. (it is right next to the commercialized SMITH STREET FOOD MARKET. ) located in an older building. When it came to buying souvenirs , it was cheap and very easy to buy for everyone."
,,Good for gifts,4.0,,"A square block of Chinatown is being reconstructed so it's not at its best at present. If you look above the rather tacky gift shops, ideal for last minute presents, you can capture some of its original flavour. Tons of restaurants nearbye and a superb Hindu temple. Well worth a visit."
,,Enjoyable,3.0,,Nice people nice food and a really interesting Buddhist temple. An enjoyable half day activity. It would not be a must see for us but if you have time to spare it's an enjoyable walk.
,,Couldnt find nice shops in this area,3.0,,We walked all around and found many eating places but for shopping there was nothing worthwhile. Small stalls all with similar merchandise .
,,includes a street with just restaurants,4.0,,great area.not far from India town. took the hop on/ hop off bus to the area. you can find all of the chinese items that you are looking for.
,,Cheap shopping and Great food!,5.0,,"Went for a wander through China Town, the shopping was just great, huge places to wander through and the shopkeepers were attentive without being overwhelming. The food street was awesome so clean with plenty of seating and an amazing selection of food. Weird foods were also available. It's just so comfortable to walk around at your own pace and discover the great places."
,,It’s a must,5.0,,Good place to get herbal stuff. I’m a fan of natural medicines and I go here to buy those things. You can find other stuff too and lots of food here and there.
,,Worth the look!,5.0,,There was a wide array of reasonably priced food in Chinatown. Due to Chinese New Year some of the shops weren't open but we had a lovely look around. Lanterns and blow up - lit up dogs for Year of the Dog lit up the street beautifully.

Has everything you would expect. Tons of vendors and shops. Locals shop here. Can buy about anything you can think of.
Lots of street food and local restaurants.
Pricing from the cheap to the very expansive.
A lot of very unique structures dating back to turn of the century.
A number of various monasteries, each unique to it's religion.

,,Nice to see chinatown always busy,5.0,,"What a great place to see this one full of people, having the opportunity to eat any type of food and shopping anything you look for! Very easy is to reach there through MRT and perfect to bring your visits to see the different temples."
,,Traditional but also a tourists hot spot...,4.0,,"Hustle of Chinatown, is an experience and one to tick off the list!! Could be considered a tourist trap with its many gift shops, eating, massage, and other tourist type shops. Worth a visit to experience the smells of Durian...and enjoy a traditional meal."
,,Nice food,5.0,,A lot of nice food at peoples park complex. Enjoyed the various cuisine esp the mala food. At the Chinatown market we found delicious steam fish at affordable prices but be prepared to sweat it out. The food centre is hot n humid but food is awesome
,,"Busy, busy, busy",4.0,,We were fortunate to be in Chinatown during the celebrations for Chinese New Year. Such a vibrant experience. The markets were colourful and heaving with people. Lots of interesting stalls and street cafes. Well worth a visit.
,,So Colourful and Lively !,4.0,,"We visited during Chinese New Year , and it was a delightful couple of hours. Plenty to see and eat. The food market is also worth a visit if you want to experience the local type of fresh fish, meat and poultry...cheapest place to eat if you want to mix with the locals. Lots of shops for souvenirs as you would expect."
,,Great food,4.0,,Lots to food stalls to choose from and food was very cheap. There were quite a few restaurants as well for anyone preferring air conditioned comfort. We went for the shopping and this was very average. Would recommend for cheap eats but not shopping.
,,Beautiful Chinese Locality,5.0,,"My 2 of 3 tours happened to coincide with Chinese New Year, I guess it's the best time to visit China Town the streets are lit with lighting, streets are filled with Chinese artifacts, there are shows performances, and yes the best of all the food. The Chinese hawker centers are the cheapest and one of the best quality food."
,,Hot pot of culture and food,5.0,,Cultural melting pot of food fashion and culture. Didn’t like the hawker market so much but the smaller side streets are alive with stalls and markets selling their wares from clothes to tasty snacks and traditional food
,,It’s fun to go,4.0,,It is fun to go through China Town. I recommend a Thai restaurant which is located in China town. Don’t know the name of the restaurant but you will find it I’m sure ;) In China Town you will find typically Chinese souvenirs. Easy to walk there or by taxi or by underground.
,,Buzzing place,5.0,,Visited 2 days after commencement of Chinese New Year Very busy but had a great time wandering round. Everyone very friendly and helpful
,,Just loved the atmosphere,4.0,,"Easy to get to on the MTR to the Chinatown station. We were advised to start our tour of the area at the Pagoda Street exit, A, and walked into tourist shops heaven.

Just about every tourist souvenir you could wish for and more. And very cheap.

Needless to say countless places to eat.

We had a family member who works in Singapore as a guide as to where and what to eat.... otherwise TA Reviews will do the job."
,,A good Small Place - Lot of Cheap Buying Options,4.0,,"Its a Small Street which is built very differently.
You see small shops all around selling Singapore souvenir. The cost here is almost the same as Bugies (A little less in few shops).
Lot of Authentic Chinese Food Options.
I loved to walk on this street with Lanterns on the top.
You will also find some traditional Chinese dresses here.
Found a good Photo Gear Shop with very effective and compelling prices. Not sure of the originality, but it looks genuine to me and was providing me International Warranty.

Must Visit if you are in Singapore. specially go there at night."
,,Full of atmosphere,4.0,,Wandered down to Chinatown from our hotel.. It was late when we arrived but the area was still buzzing.. Plenty of places to eat by the roadside all looking and smelling authentic...food very reasonable.. Was the year of the dog...Chinese new year which made it even more special.
,,Don’t just go the the food quarter,5.0,,"My heading is important. The area and buildings that surround the food quarter are quaint and beautiful. I enjoyed these more than the hustle of the food area which is typical of any China town.

There is free WiFi on the food quarter and many shops.

To do it all it will take you 4 hours if you wish to eat too."
,,Asian Experience,5.0,,"This is a must see and experience. Very clean, lots of places to experience the food and shopping. Many of the shops you can negotiate. If you want something tailored this is the place to go!"
,,Prayer for lunar chinese new year.,5.0,,A typical must visit to this early china immigrants our ancestor.Very chinese atmosphere environment those old days house living chinese ethics ways of a family united helpful n concern for own countryman while in a new n odd living country of extreme unknown aheads.
,,"Authentic place, enjoyable walking trip",5.0,,"We were rather taken in by the Pagoda street where 2/3 storied old buildings make China town alive. Walk about, take photos, do some souvenir shopping, sit by the roadside café sipping Thai cold coffee - China town is quite interesting."
,,Great Experince!,5.0,,"Great experience I got there. Lot of Chinese products sells there! I enjoyed shopping there! I bought some Chinese products like Kimono, Chinese traditional wear, Amazing place & Highly recommended!"
,,Shop and shop,4.0,,"Interesting place to visit especially weeks before Chinese New Year. Lots of stalls with food, fruit, souvenirs, accessories are sold there. Fixed price, no need to bargain coz theirs are cheaper than the ones you buy in souvenir shops at tourist attractions. But hot and humid too. Comfortable clothes are recommended. And make sure you keep your belongings tightly try the local food in the food court. You’ll be spoiled by a lot of various food and drinks there"
,,Great place to eat,3.0,,"While in Singapore, one evening we went to China town. First of all went to a few temples around the area like the Hindu temple Sri Mariamman Temple and a few Chinese temples before walking around the market stalls.

We bought a few souvenirs and gifts.

We also went to a famous Tin Tin shop.

It was my husband's birthday that day so we decided to go to a restaurant and celebrate. We went to Xie Lao Song restaurant and I was glad it was so cool with air conditioning.

For dinner, we ordered chilli crab and duck dishes.

The food was yummy and we enjoyed the food with local beer.

After dinner, we went for a stroll and saw many people dancing with to some music in an old square. It was so nice to see that anyone can walk and join the group and leave once done."
,,The place to eat.,5.0,,"An amazing atmosphere, this is the place to eat and drink. It's far cheaper than the city or riverside restaurants/bars and the food is equally as good. Good shopping too."
,,Visit the past now in the present,5.0,,"Chinatown is authentic. The real thing. Visit by day or by night. At night the street markets bring it alive. Lots of street food, pop ups, indoor and outdoor markets. Served by excellent MRT. Walking distance from CBD and entertainment."
,,"very interesting neighborhood within Singapore, crowded with lots of character",5.0,,"Being from the USA, we wanted to get some of the flavor of the diversity of Singapore (and also it was Lunar New Year). So, we asked at our hotel how to get to the center of Chinatown. They directed us to the subway. When we got out of the subway, we were right in the middle of Chinatown.

The main street had lots of brightly colored decorations for Chinese New Year. We went into a large multi-story store that was like a Wal-Mart for Chinatown: they had a wide variety of items, most of them oriented towards Chinese lifestyle and culture.

We walked around and ended up in one of the big outdoor markets, which was fascinating. Also, at one point, we happened upon a big display about Chinese horoscopes for the coming Year (of the Dog)..... it was, after all, Chinese New Year. And there was an area of the marketplace filled with small travel agencies to go to different ares of China, as well as the rest of the world."
,,Lots to eat here,5.0,,"A visit to China Town is a must, with lots of eateries of authentic Singaporean and Asian dishes to choose from and cheap prices. They are also many shops to buy your souvenirs from."
,,Loved it,5.0,,"Vibrant, interesting and the street food was just amazing. Had two amazing meals sat in the hustle and bustle loved it."
,,Town in China,3.0,,"Chinatown is an oddity in Singapore. Where else in the world do you find one when the whole country is already full of Chinese? Of course you will still find remnants of preserved or modified shophouse where the early Chinese immigrants first stayed. Try Nankin Row which used to know as Suicide St for the sheer number of suicide jumps in the past due to the miserable living conditions then.

Just like other places with a dark past in Singapore, today Nankin Row is a bustling stretch of offices and restaurants vying for your patronage. So go for it!"
,,A must visit,5.0,,"Colour abounds in China town with so many shops selling exotic souvenirs at cheap prices. The food street is great for lunch, cheap , clean, safe and very tasty. The Buddha tooth relic temple is also at the end of one of the streets."
,,NOT FOR ME,3.0,,"Did not like this place at all in fact only walked so far but it was too dirty with fruit and other food just lying around.
We tried different restaurants but could not face it sorry this is not for us we turned around and came back to the coach."
,,Good atmosphere,5.0,,Great place to have a mooch and walk about. Avoid the restaurants that cater for tourists they are rubbish!
,,great shopping.. food halls with atmosphere ...plus so much more,5.0,,great shopping.. food markets with atmosphere ...plus so much more...this includes local ethnic Malay and Chinese food and restaurants...this is a bustling area for a reason...visit
,,Popular Place,4.0,,"We walked through China town around lunch time, and the aromas coming from all chinese restaurants was to hard to ignore, so we decided to have some lunch there. What we had was just great, freshly cooked, full of flavour and realistically priced, then washed down with an ice cold beer. Its a very hard place to stay away from and is a very popular place, we will be back, hopefully .........William & Lesley Perth"
,,Not what it use to be!,3.0,,"We had not been to Singapore Chinatown for about 7 years and we found that it was not what it use to be as far as getting bargains on quality items. Mostly now the shops sell poorer quality items except if you go to the upmarket department stores elsewhere. We always buy clothes and shoes for my husband as he is Asian and finds that the sizes are right for him but we found that there weren't the merchants that sold Italian and European brands of shirts and trousers as there was 7 years earlier. There were very few fabric shops compared to earlier too. I suppose it just depends on what you want from Chinatown,if you haven't been before it is a great place to witness the culture and goings on."
,,The most interesting Chinatown,5.0,,"One of the most interesting Chinatowns I have ever visited. Very clean, organized and it is ideal to buy some souvenirs if you are into it. You can get there 10 keychains for only 1 dollar."
,,So much to see and learn from this vibrant area,5.0,,"Walk slowly and catch the sights and smells from all the different shops and restaurants. Stay clear of the tourist traps but take the time to prepare for the walk by reading up ahead. Or, catch a tour guide walk from the likes of the Hippo/Duck Tours people."
,,Unique - unlike any other,5.0,,"By far, Chinatown in Singapore is so much fun, safe, clean, organized, and full of gracious, kind merchants and visitors. I felt so relaxed and yet also intrigued with each new shop I encountered. I've visited several Chinatown's in the world, and Singapore's Chinatown really stands head and shoulders above all the rest!"
,,Enjoy the city within the city,5.0,,"A tourist attraction, but also a place for Great shopping and food. Prices are good, and food is Great. A must - if you like to Explore a city within the city."
,,Lots of colour & atmosphere,5.0,,"Get a massage, grab a delicious meal, shop at a cheap souvenir shop. Plenty to do & see. The food centre has plenty of delicious choices including the famous Hawker Chan Michelin Star Soya Chicken"
,,Good place,5.0,,The most interesting neighborhood in Singapore. Extremely busy and full of street Chinese traders and food sellers
,,"Busy, busy, busy",3.0,,"We were there the week before Chinese New Year and went in the evening when stall holders were selling all sorts of New Year regalia.
It was very crowded so to some extent one had to shuffle along with the hoards of other folk and as a result probably missed much of what Chinatown had to offer."
,,always a great place to visit,5.0,,"from amazing food to the excellent coffee museum and the beautiful Buddha relic temple, chinatown is always buzzing. The china cultural heritage centre does an amazing job of telling the story of chinese settlers while Maxwells hawker centre has a good selection of great food, including Tian Tian which is Gordon Ramsay's go to for chicken rice"
,,Must see in Singapore,4.0,,Very nice place to visit while in Singapore. Full of shops and typical.chinese restaurants. Safe area that can be reached by MRT
,,Streets packed with Chinese trinkets,3.0,,Went there on the MRT (Chinatown stop). The market is a good place to eat and buy trinkets but although there are lots of stalls on the side roads they are selling more or less the same things at the same price. So when you've seen a few there's really not much need to carry on in the heat and the crowds. We didn't do a walking tour of Chinatown so maybe we missed the best part but we were too worn down after lunch a a walk in a few streets.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,It will take you about 2-3 hrs min but it is worth it there are so many colourful Temples to see along the route.
,,Cool place to eat & shop,5.0,,I really enjoyed Chinatown. The vendors were friendly and the food was really good. Cute items for sale and good prices.
,,Excellent shopping,4.0,,"Chinatown, like Little India, epitomises the Chinese influence in Singapore. Lots of lovely little shops and bars and a great range of clothing to bargain for. A must visit whilst in Singapore. Like all areas like this, they burst into life at night-time."
,,Good place to visit,4.0,,"Located in the heart of Singapore old town, this place is easily accessible by MRT ( Chinatown ). In Chinatown, you can find a lot of places to eat. Shopping malls like Chinatown Point and People Park Complex are located in that area. Chinatown is also a very good place to buy your souvenirs and have good photo taking with the old buildings."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"You should definately visit and shop at the stalls but do not eat here. Smith Street and surrounds are overpriced and the quality of food is not as good as it should be. After shopping, either head to the Maxwell Food Market, 5 minutes walk away or to one of the commercial buildings or small restaurants a few blocks away. Food is much cheaper and tastier. Chinatown is a great experience as long as you do not stop to eat!"
,,Vibrant,5.0,,Full of colour sights and smells. Well worth a wander around just to take in the atmosphere. If you are in the area then definitely visit.
,,Food Food Everywhere,4.0,,"Chinatown is the best place if you are looking for street-food.
Alight at the Chinatown MRT Station and cross the street, you will find many food sellers. I tried the S$1 Lime Juice and Orange Juice. They felt so refreshing amidst the Singapore's hot weather.

Don't miss the grilled fish at the hawker center. It was located near bun's seller, and definitely worth trying!"
,,"Just okay, give it a miss if you have seen others.",3.0,,"All international cities have a China Town. The one here is a bit too touristy, very noisy packed in restaurant stalls selling what looked like just average and overpriced food. We walked through quickly and went back out to one of the main streets and spotted a food mall on a 2nd floor of a commercial building. Had a great, authentic, cheap lunch from one of the stalls, more locals then tourists here. If you have never seen a China Town then go, but if you have seen others, give it a miss there is too much to do in Singapore as it is."
,,Like so many other China town's around the world.,3.0,,"It was just okay. If you haven't seen a China town before then it is well worth the visit. You will find lots of cheap souvenirs from PRC of course. But look deeper and you will see there is more, much more - if you care to look."
,,It's a Chinatown. Every city has one.,3.0,,"A visit to Singapore's Chinatown is compulsory, to ""tick the box"" but it is singularly unimpressive. We enjoyed the lights and street decoration. Walk through, take the pic and move on to Little India."
,,Very Satisfying visit,4.0,,An excellent place for petty shopping with varities of eateries on typical Chinese ambiance. Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a must visit masterpiece.
,,Fun!,4.0,,Very fun to walk around. Lots of shops plus a very cool Buddha museum. I would spend a morning here!
,,Not worth bothering,1.0,,"Chinatown is easy to access by MRT but really not worth visiting, IMHO. It is interesting to see the architectural style of the old buildings but they have been heavily tarted up. For the rest, there is endless souvenir tat for sale."
,,Clean and Authentic City Chinatown,3.0,,"Unlike other Chinatown in other country, Singapore Chinatown have been re arrange with clean, organize yet authentic with old Chinatown atmosphere. Food, souvenir and very Chinese culture architecture building and shop. Best for geographic photography."
,,A must in Singapore!,5.0,,"Where do I start.
First of all this is a must if your in Singapore!

The atmosphere here is hectic but in a calm way, the people here is kind and very polite.

Depending on the time of the day I would definitely say that you should visit Chinatown at evening/night so different then at day in a better way.

Food wise this is a heaven! The quality and the price is probably the best of Singapore, you should definitely try “carrot cake” that’s the National dish.

There is plenty of food court “hawks” in the area where you can find super cheap food and if your planing to go there choose day/evening Because they close relative early.

Food: *****
Location: *****
Price: ****

I love how safe Singapore is in general. so walking around at night is fabulous. you do need to stay vigilant sue to pick pockets though.
,,Great place for souvenirs,4.0,,We enjoyed our couple of visits to Chinatown . We shopped in the daytime and then went back at nighttime for dinner and then drinks . Well worth a visit to all tourists and very safe . This is where you should buy your souvenirs .
,,An excellent Guide,5.0,,"We joined a group of six others on a walking tour of Chinatown that included stops to savour the delights of hawker foods. And we were not disappointed.

,,Eat here once and you'll visit every day while in Singapore,5.0,,"By 'here', I mean 'Traditional Chinese Desserts"", on the left just off the main street in Temple Street - 50 metres perhaps. ""Mango and Pomello Sago dessert"" - I could live on it alone. $5. And ""Mango Pudding"" at about$3.50 is not too bad either. I'm sure neither is fattening."
,,Step into another world,4.0,,Visited around the Chinese New Year so the whole area was very attractive. Particularly enjoyed seeing the different temples.
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,We visited 2 days prior to Chinese New Year. What an enjoyable experience walking through the bustling streets. Loads of street stalls and numerous things to see. A must visit for anyone with the time.
,,has seen better days !,2.0,,"Chinatown Singapore has gone down hill in my opinion. It used to offer more high end shopping but today all it offers are trinkets and useless garbage for sale. There is a lovely temple in the middle of Chinatown which is lovely to visit, however after seeing it as many times in the past as I have, it's gotten a bit boring to look at as well. There is an authentic Chinese canteen offering some cheap and delicious snacks, however this is the only redeeming quality of Chinatown. It also looks very trashy these days and is not well kept. I will avoid this place in the future. The wear and tear of this place is substantial."
,,Bargains for every1,5.0,,Great to find bargains for souvenirs. Love to taste different foods available. Lots of places to eat n explore. People were nice and helpful.
,,China Town is China Town,4.0,,It is easy to take the metro to China Town station. You come up right in the middle of the market and all the restaurants. I think it is the most expensive China Town I have ever had dinner in. Prices are high in Singapore.
,,Back to the roots,4.0,,"Is always a pretty good idea to get a bit of information before travelling to a new place and, my missus is a big nerd when it comes to digging up details, good places to visit and what to expect. We read that Singapore has a pretty strong Chinese influence given the origin of a big chunk of the population and this is pretty hard to see at first glance when you walk around Singapore.

Eventually, we decided to pay a visit to Chinatown and we were nicely surprised with what we found, especially now the Chinese New Year had decorated everything wall to wall with the dog motive but, what I found quite interesting were the food and the temples. This area is completely alive at all times, from people playing chess on the streets to the food stands inviting you in with the smell of the food and not to forget the markets, filled with a lot of souvenirs and memorabilia targeted to tourists (although we prefer to not get anything as the planet has enough rubbish around).

Some of the places I would recommend you to visit in Chinatown are:
- Chinatown Heritage Centre: to get to know the history of the region.
- Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum: just go, I honestly can not describe it, get in and be amazed by all the little buddhas.
- The Chinese Street Markets: I think this tends to be the main attraction when someone comes to visit Chinatown.
- And the Chinese Theatres: it looked pretty from the outside, unfortunately, we couldn't get in.

Hope you enjoy the visit :)"

,,"Probably the best area in Singapore for Souvenirs and Culinary, but Far From Changi Airport",5.0,,"This is probably the best area in Singapore for dining and shopping for souvenirs. There are so many restaurants, hawker centres, or food stalls... Beware though as this is Chinatown, most of the foods here are non halal.

However, note that this area is 45 minutes away taking MRT from Changi airport witso might not really be an ideal place if you have to catch an early morning flight or only have a several hours transit."

,,A must see,5.0,,"We loved Chinatown so much we visited several times during our short stay in Singapore - our hotel was within walking distance. Vibrant and alive. It was amid the Chinese New Year celebrations so this may have helped with the amount of wonderful lanterns and decorations. Many excellent shopping, souvenir and food stalls and don’t forget to try the local signature cocktail - the Singapore Sling."
,,Great visit during Lunar New Year Celebrations 2018,5.0,,"We have just returned from a 5 day stay in Singapore. We visited China Town several times during the visit both day and night. We were very fortunate as our visit coincided with Lunar New Year (year of the Dog) the decorations were fantastic. We walked around all the streets and shops. It was also a time for purchasing a particular type of pork and the queues stretched around the block in some places.

,,New year celebration—year of the dog,4.0,,China was colorfully decorated with lanterns for the new year. Shopping at the market was interesting.
,,So crowded and just tourism,2.0,,Not the 'Chinatown' which I know when I lived in Singapore years before as 'Expat'. Now is just a place for tourists only
,,Chinese New Year in Chinatown!,5.0,,"Such a great place. The market is hopping! There is a ton of cheap and good food in the hawker centers, don't be fooled into paying super expensive prices in the restaurants! Fun to walk around. Street closures for stage performances during the holiday, so keep that in mind while getting around the city. Explore by foot and only issue is lots of people celebrating the holiday!"
,,"A must see, visit on foot to see much more",4.0,,"We were lucky to be in Singapore at the Chinese New Year. They really go to town with decorations, music, drums and dancing dragons all over the place. Chinatown is a compact little area and easy to get in and out of. My suggestion is to take a bus, we did the open top one, and stop at the one leaving Chinatown, work your way up and down the narrow streets and market stalls and visit the temple. We maybe got a better overall impression because of the time of year but it is a must see if you are in Singapore."
,,Very good,5.0,,You have not been in Singapore without visiting the heritage center and walked around in Chinatown. End with a lunch or dinner.
,,Chinatown,3.0,,"We have been to many Chinatowns in various countries and this was a disappointment. It didn’t offer much

,,Shop the souvenir and learn historic of the place,5.0,,"It's my second time in Chinatown , Singapore but it's my first reviewed here. Products are cheap to reasonable price. Don't recommend to buy chocolate for souvenir there due to the taste is quit bad ( you get what you paid ). If you walk around the Chinatown and read the historic board. The antique shophouses are very interesting. Some used to be red houses while in the other side , it used to be the dead house which anyone was going to die, the family should send them to stay and die around there. Nowadays, it's one of attraction part in Singapore where we enjoy shopping!!!"
,,Shopping,4.0,,we wandered around china town for over 3 hours and had a great time just taking in all hustle and bustle and the different prices available. We stopped and had a nice snack at one of the restaurants available in the area

,,Beautiful street... A must go in Singapore,5.0,,"Love the stretch the feel and the colors on the street. Considering its chinese new year currently, the stretch is all the more decked up. But China town is absolutely as if you are in China already. The beautiful chinese decor items, feng shui stuff, exactly at China town MRT, absolutely chinese and singaporean local food in plenty. Nearby popular Indian temple, across the road is club street another popular hangout place. Also there are gay bars where waiters and servers are gays and its a nice feel to sip a drink and intermingle with all types of people around you. Anybody can walk up to those pubs they are absolutely normal. All myths broken. Cross culture feel. Also there is a merchandise store for Tintin fans in china town. Buddha relic popular and beautiful chinese temple is a must go too."
,,Rich Culture & Heritage,5.0,,"Singapore Chinatown is also known as ""Ox Cart"" (used to haul in drinking water to local residence).

Chinatown Heritage Museum
Maxwell Road Hawker Center"

,,Don’t miss it,5.0,,A trip to Singapore without a stop in Chinatown would be like a trip to Paris and not going to the Eiffel Tower. Bustling and crowded with food available everywhere and colorful street scenes. Go to one of the Hawker areas for great food at a great price. Easy access on Downtown Line.
,,Great food!,4.0,,"Our hotel wasn't too far so walked though here many times on the way home. The street food here is great, there is so so many options and its all so cheap too.

,,Rushed tour,4.0,,We had a chinese guide for this tour who was more focused on her own heritage and family than actually telling us where we were and details of the places. Never the less it was really interesting although busy with people. With it being Chinese New Year the decorations were all up and there was a dancing dragon in front of the temple we went to. Loved that.
,,Must come here,4.0,,"I compare the price, if you buy goods better be here than in Bugis. There is many good spots you can see here"
,,Food street,5.0,,"We were lucky to be staying within walking distance of China town so we ate here a couple of times during our stay, it was a week before Chinese New year which gave the area a bigger buzz.
The hawker stalls on the food street are all great value and the food was excellent with a good mix of locals and tourists all sitting together."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"We're here for Chinese New year so was a lot of stuff going on, I heard from a vendor that if you go any other time of the year there are no street stalls so could not be so exciting. Reasonable price food. Everyone speaks English. Can barter a little with vendors but not a lot. Was a highlight for me. Souvenirs till the cows come home! food average pricing nzd $16-18for a meal. The mall across the road is called the peoples mall and has a downstairs food court where we go meals for $3 ate here a lot! Authentic Chinese & other ethnic food here!"
,,Fun Place to Walk and Try Some Authentic Chinese Food,5.0,,"I live in Beijing and visited Chinatown in Singapore during the Lunar New Year. I can definitely say that there is a real taste of China in this neighborhood apparent in the stalls and restaurants. The decorations for New Year were much more than we get to see in Beijing, so if you visit during a holiday, go at night to see the lights and during the day to visit the temples."
,,Love China town,5.0,,Great visit here just before CNY very busy very authentic very good. Great place to visit even just for the atmosphere of the narrow streets packed with stalls
,,Chinese New Year celebration,5.0,,This year has so much to offer. Its a good ambience for the celebration and very fun and exciting experience.
,,Tasty food,4.0,,"It had to be done
Had read about Singapore's famous Chilli Chicken and ventured to Chinatown to sample it
The whole place was buzzing as the following day was Chinese New Year. Alas we were leaving in the morning.
The crabs were live and prices clearly marked on shell. We chose one at 50 dollars which was ample for two of us.
Cooking time was about 15 minutes while we enjoyed an icy beer. A very messy experience and you are provided with plastic gloves but thoroughly enjoyable.
We ate in Smith Street which is all food outlets then walked through Sago Street which is market stores. Did not feel intimidated or pressurized to buy unlike in many other countries."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Happen to be here at Chinese New Year. Great excitement and activity in Chinatown. The street markets are good and the buildings very interesting.
,,Very Busy place,4.0,,"It was hectic, but not that hectic that it made you want to leave. Alot of shops offering a range of different things, but also alot of shops offering the same product. Plenty of food if your hungry and was close to the MRT Chinatown station ."
,,Interesting - Visited Around Chinese New Year,3.0,,"A short taxi ride and you are in the center of Singapore's China town. In the center is an enclosed market that is worth walking through. Don't expect any great products or bargains. The goods are basic at best. But it is fun to see.
The temples in the area are MUST sees. The food stalls/stores are everywhere and range from very basic to gourmet. The whole area was brightly decorated in red for the New Year celebrations."
,,come here during chinese new year,5.0,,"Great place to visit yearly for chinese new year, decorations are changed every year, with bazaar for chinese new year set up, gets very lively nearer to CNY."
,,great place to visit.,5.0,,"Lots of character in the buildings here, which makes a nice change from all the other glass/ sterile like buildings in most of Singapore. Food is good and cheap by Singaporean standards. Cheap shopping too."
,,The place to get your souvenir,5.0,,"We were sorry to visit this place last. We found out that this is the best place to buy souvenir for Singapore visit. There are a lot of delicious food and drinks around as well.
It can be very crowded sometime but that's part of the experience.
This place very close with Buddha Tooth Relic and Sri Mariamman Temple.
Must visit when you are in Singapore."
,,"Color, Culture and Crowds",5.0,,"This is one of my favorite places in Singapore, been here tons of times and always want to return again.
After exiting the Blue Downtown Line MRT station, exit A, you're plopped right in the center of it all. Clothing, table cloths, trinkets, toys, costume jewelry, fun knick knacks (you *need* a waving money cat! you do!), keychains, luggage tags, t-shirts, lanterns, and oh...I could go on and on. Many merchants are very happy to talk to you. Lots of them will guess where you're from. You can have a chat, debate over souvenirs, and then meander over to see the temples nearby. Afterward, head over to a food stall, a sit down restaurant or even the food court to try some flavorful eats or refresh with an iced tea or cold brew. The sights, sounds, colors and people are amazing. So much to see, the cultural center, the temples like I said (but dress modestly to visit, please), and all the wares that are symbolic of the truly international merchant magic of this tiny but massively important island nation. Really a great place! Notes: Dress comfortably to wander through crowds, uneven surfaces. If you don't bring a stroller that would be best. Keep an eye on kids, they might want to grab all those colorful things. Carry your own bottled water or buy from a vendor. Wear hat/sunscreen because on sunny days it can be rather equatorially roasting at times, though in the shade of a shop it's fine. Have fun."
,,Great food & souvenir shopping!,5.0,,"The hawker stalls in Chinatown are delicious, I got to try all sorts of different foods. And while a lot of the shopping in Singapore can be expensive, you can get many affordable gifts and souvenirs in Chinatown. Most of the gifts I brought back for family and friends came from Chinatown. Go here to eat and shop!"
,,Chinese New Year Light up,5.0,,"The yearly Chinese New year Light Up and Opening Ceremony marks the opening of the Chinatown Chinese New Year Celebrations. As Chinese, we feel a sense of pride when we stroll through Chinatown each year. All visitors can feast on mouth-watering New Year delicacies, enjoy the brilliant lights and decorations of the stalls and shop for the many Lunar New Year traditional goodies from cookies, decorative items, waxed duck and preserved fruits to potted plants and clothing. If you're lucky, you may be able to catch a lion dance by the troops from Singapore"
,,Busy place,4.0,,Lots of cheap souvenirs plus food and the occasional tailor wanting to sell you a suit. Its a fun experience and part of the Singapore experience. A visit to the Tin Tin shop is worth doing
,,Very good place with economically cheap stuff,5.0,,"Good place to hang around to eat and buy Chinese stuff, very good place to feel the Chinese culture."
,,Full of Chinese Elements,4.0,,"Just like Chinatown in other countries, it is quite bustled and crowded. It was coming to the traditional Chinese New Year when we visited here, the street was full of red lantern. You may find lots of Chinese elements, like restaurant, grocery, clothing shop, and etc."
,,Average,3.0,,"We visited this place to get a few souvenirs,some of them were just too expensive,lots of food courts,you can sit out and eat,didn't enjoy the place very much."
,,Lovely,5.0,,"Very clean, tidy, wonderful to spend many hours walking around it. Interesting items in food, crafts, and particularly close to new year, this area is amazing"
,,Preparing for Lunar New Year,5.0,,"The place was very crowded and beautifully lighted up. There were many stores selling New Year goodies, with many opportunities for free samples! Easy to get to by MRT."
,,Chinese New Year,4.0,,Wow so many people here to celebrate in this extraordinary city. I’ve never been to Chinatown in Singapore before but they just do it so well. The markets are fascinating and colourful and filled with people. Food and flavours everywhere. Great value and plenty of choices.
,,Overrated,3.0,,The decorations were gorgeous but we struggled to find our way around and to find things to do. At the tail end of a very long trip. It was too much for us
,,Exciting,5.0,,Chinatown is full of activity and bargains. Definitely worth a causal stroll. People were helpful and friendly.
,,Crowded and nice,4.0,,"Singapore is little and beautiful island. Nothing much to do. And visiting China Town a must. All products are from China))) Don't expect something high quality to shop. You can complete gift shopping from here at reasonable prices. Street food lovers definitely will like here. There was a warning sign against pick pockets, l been just before Chinese new year (Dog) was very crowded.. keep in your mind.."
,,CNY shopping,3.0,,"A ""must"" place to visit during the CNY period to shop for New Year goodies. Many cheap hawker food to eat too. Bought pineapple tarts, sunflower seed cookies, nian gao, dried coconut strips n lotus, peanuts, pamelo, Chinese sausages n duck drumsticks etc. So heavy."
,,Crowded - but a must when visiting Singapore,5.0,,"Shopping or dining - both is fun and inexpensive. We learnt that if you eat indoor you will be charged a service charge, which you don’t have to do eating outdoor. It’s more fun to be there at nighttime. And don’t forget to visit Chinatown Heritage Center. Where you get a little bit of history. We found it very, very interesting."
,,Just like any other Chinatowns elsewhere,3.0,,"Chinatown is one of the famous immigrant districts in Singapore. The other would be the Little India. As expected, the place is full of Chinese temples, eateries and shops selling Chinese products. As such, I really don't see anything special about the place. It looks like any other Chinatown anywhere else, with the exemption that perhaps this one in Singapore is a little bit more organized, clean and well-maintained. The whole area becomes particularly lively and colorful during the lunar Chinese New Year. It's the best time of the year to visit it."
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,just got here by chance but very surprising with it. didnt expect the food is good and affordable compare to price
,,An experience not to be missed,5.0,,"The whole place is an experience if one is from Europe, so different from what we are used to. The street food is great, and any thing can be bought here. Don’t miss it."
,,Interesting Area,4.0,,We visited Chinatown just before Chinese New Year. The area was very busy with plenty of places to eat. Ideal place in Singapore to go for a meal.
,,Chinatown Experience in Singapore,4.0,,"We definitely wanted to do the Chinatown experience while in Singapore. We went early evening and the streets were bustling with activity. There are plenty of shops, street food stands, and restaurants to try. We also went into the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum - a neat stop. Chinatown is definitely worth taking a walk around!"
,,Must visit,5.0,,Great to see hustle and bustle of Singapore. Little one enjoyed bartering for things! Nice authentic food (much like hawkers)
,,Must do visit especially during Chinese New Year,5.0,,A concentration of cultural experiences and an assault on all of your senses. Not to be missed. Save space for great food.
,,"Nice place to buy, to eat and spend some time",5.0,,"Can eat good and not expensive, good to buy some fruits and presents. Have MRT station- easy to reach any destinations"
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"Vibrant part of the town,lots to do here.There are restaurants,caffe bars and lots of museums.Few gift shops aswell."
,,The charm of an old-world site.,4.0,,"We visited Chinatown to have a look at various attractions, i.e. restaurants, temples, museums, as well as doing a bit of shopping. The places are old, but in mint condition, a bit different from other ""Chinatowns"". The people are friendly and eager to assist one. We surely learnt a lot of this part of the world!"
,,Interesting place,5.0,,"You can go there by bus, train, taxi etc. Quite reasonable in some parts other areas cheap. Stacks of stalls/shops everywhere to visit and something for everyone i believe. Food is great and quite cheap. Couple of shopping centres and interesting. Cheaper places to exchane money if you need to. We shopped in chinatown quite a bit great variety. We enjoyed a lovely meal in a pub plus great band provided nice music and not too loud which was pleasing. Lovely temples to visit and see about their culture. A must to visit."
,,Quite an experience,4.0,,"This area of the town is definitely noisier and intense than the rest, but it has a lot of charm and great food. Prices are also a lot more accessible for souvenirs. I really enjoyed the blend of sounds and flavors, as well as all the preparations for the New Year (a lot of dog statues, toys, etc everywhere). Chinatown is quite an experience in itself and also there is quite a lot to see, especially The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple."
,,Like every Chinatown,4.0,,"Let's say it's typically like every Chinatown over the world. You have the temple, museum and those shops and restaurants where you can find the cheapest things in town."
,,Exciting and colorful place,5.0,,"One of the best place to buy cheap souvenir of Singapore. The entire street will be full of souvenir shops, restaurants and spas. You can also get cheap dresses. This is also a best place for street photography."
,,Streetfood,5.0,,"When into Chinatown for a look and ended up eating and looking around it was on the eve of the Chinese New Year, worth the visit and try the Eggtarts"
,,To heighten your senses,4.0,,"I love Chinatown no matter what city you go to, the culture, the vibrant colours of items being sold in little shops, the lanterns and not to mention the temples and restaurants to tantalise your taste buds!

Whilst we found Chinatown in Singapore to be more commercialised than when we visited a few years ago it still has that charm about it, albeit a little too touristy now although still fabulous.

Worth a visit indeed"
,,A typical China town but cleaner,3.0,,"We visited when Chinese New Year is approaching, so they have beautiful lights and accessories in town. Love the authenticity of the food, and the cheap prices on many items. Singapore is expensive but here you can find more cheaper stuffs."
,,Wonderfully exciting place to be!,5.0,,"It was very busy but full of colour and activity. Cheap shopping in stark contrast to the rest of Singapore, wide variety of food, loved it! We went back twice and there was still lots more to explore. Certainly worth a visit."
,,Same old,3.0,,We enjoyed seeing China town but it sold just the same tack that was available elswhere apart from the odd little shop that did have original quality goods from malaysia. Glad to have been to see it but didn't see much worth buying.
,,Chinatown best time to visit,5.0,,"Chinatown Singapore is a must place to visit. I went there on this beautiful month of February which will usher the Chinese Lunar Year celebrating the Year of the Dog. Its the best time of the year to visit.
There many activities and bazaars with Chinese New Year goodies.
Please view my pictures which will tell more stories.
Around the area you must visit the Sri Mariammal Indian Temple, The Jamea Chulia Mosque which are historical places of worship and the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum next to the Indian Temple.
You want food...no worries many Chinese restaurants at every conner of the streets and Muslim Foods too. Opposite Buddha Temple (across the street) is the well known Maxwell Road Food Court which you can read in my previous submission.
Transport is very easy just hope on the Chinatown North East Purple Line and Chinatown Downtown Blue Line.
So enjoy visit and have pleasant stay in the Lion City of Singapura. Cheers"
,,Only visit in the run up to Chinese New Year,4.0,,"I've been to Chinatown a few times, and it's only in the weeks before the Chinese New Year that I think it really comes alive. It's fun and there are plenty of shops to browse around, street stalls to visit and restaurants to eat in. But with the crowds, be careful with your wallets and purses. You want to keep them close all the time, as there have been incidents of pickpocketing."
,,Atmosphere,5.0,,"What a great atmosphere this market is! We had the best chilli crab at a small local place and it was amazing! Managed to buy a few useful things of good value and definitely plenty of cold beer around to drink on a hot day!
Highly recommend a visit for the day."
,,Year of the Dog,5.0,,"Great big models of cartoon type dogs in the middle of the road!Great shopping for the kind of stuff to give you a laugh or a cheap bag, shirt, jewellery etc. Fun browsing and purchasing.
Everyone enjoying the markets. A bonus is the temple at the end of the street. Definitely a must visit.....get a suit made by Mr Armani!"
,,Festive decorations for Chinese New Year,4.0,,"I've been to Singapore several times but this was my first time to Chinatown. It was a lot of fun. We went the week before New Year and everything was decorated for the holiday. It was crowded with lots bifocals and tourists. Singapore is such a clean city, I wasn't sure if Chinatown would be too. But Chinatown was as you would expect, gritty with people, food and shops everywhere. I smelled durian for the first time. Based on the smell, I'm sure I'll never eat it :)"
,,Great array of shops and eateries,4.0,,Was amazed by the colours as the Chinese prepare for New Year. Loads of inexpensive stalls selling an incredible range of goods. Got a couple of SD cards very cheap. Lots of places to eat and dring. Roads are narrow and busy.
,,vibrant after dark,5.0,,"During the day the area is a bustling business district but after dark it comes into its own as a tourist area with many 'street food' type restaurants offering local fare - you pick from the pictures as the menus are often not in english or, if thet are in english, noty really descriptive of the fare on offer."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,You can have the local Chinese food at the street and Chinese products. The place was very clean and well maintained. A must see during your visit to Singapore.
,,Great for Chinese New Year...or any time of the year!,5.0,,"Beautifully decorated, very busy & we enjoyed shopping at different stalls. Great snacks as we cook to used to walk around. Truly, it's a great place to visit any time of the year."
,,Good Food Everywhere,5.0,,In Chinatown you can find an alley full of stuffs. They sell everything from merchandise to good food. Definitely have to check out this place if you ever go to Singapore.
,,Busy and Bustling with Lots of Character,4.0,,"As Chinatowns go this one rates highly. Stroll through the streets and take in the sights, sounds, and smells. There are lots of neat shops where you can bargain and plenty of tempting restaurants."
,,Alive and kicking,4.0,,"You cannot help but be impressed with the vibrancy of Chinatown and the generally relaxed atmosphere, despite the place being very busy when we visited, due to the forthcoming festivities for The Year of the Dog.

Great architecture, numerous and varied shops and street stalls, plus ample food choices for all budgets. This is why Chinatown is alive and kicking."
,,look past the usual touristy and you will still find treasures.,4.0,,"One of the places in Singapore with a wealth of history. As with all historical / heritage areas, there is a touristy element to it. Cheap mass produced souvenirs, touting hawkers, you know what i mean.
But look deeper and you can still find nuggets of treasures. The local authorities has done a good job in preserving the history of the place, and there are a couple of visitor centers and small museums amongst the streets.
Check out the main market building along Smith street. There is a wet market at the basement level where locals shop for daily ingredients from fresh vegetables to live frogs. There is a large food centre with prob over a hundred stalls at the 2nd or 3rd level of the same building. This is where you find the most authentically local food. there are restaurants and also a food street in the area, but they are not as local as this.

Check out the hindu and temples in close proximity too. Says much about Singapore's multi-racial heritage."
,,One of the nicer Chinatown's I've visited,4.0,,"I was slightly impressed. This was one of the nicer Chinatown's I've been to in Asia. There is still the common junk items you can find at multiple shops at any outdoor market around the world, but there are also some nicer shops. Worth a visit for an hour or so."
,,Not a fan,2.0,,"Its very busy, so a lot of pushing and shoving going on, there are terrible smells of food cooking, be okay if you are into that sort of thing I guess, and really the items they are selling there are rubbish. Was a good walk around to have a look and remind me of why I don't go to those sorts of places."
,,Cheap Place in Town,4.0,,"Recommended for Chinese friends looking dfor delicious food and things.

For moslem like me, enjoy the ambience, bought souvenirs, come to Chinese Heritage Center, heard the music and crowded also comes to TinTin Shop.

Especially when you come in february, so many decoration for Chinese New Year. For friends who loved Chinese like me, this is must visit place in town.

Don't worry, close by China Town there is Mosque Street. We can pray here, take a rest and find halal food."

Whole area well served by th MRT.
Not far from the CBD
Good fun to visit"
,,Busy street,4.0,,"Decided to explore Chinatown. It was full of people but there was a method to the madness. Lots of trinkets to buy, food was fantastic and people were helpful. We even decided to try some Durian fruit...definately an acquired taste. We just walked around and found out way. We used the MRT and it was easy to find. Worth the it."
,,Good bargains to be had.,4.0,,"We visited from the hop on / off bus tour and spent a couple of hours doing the shops..
Some good bargains and souvenirs to be found especially in the 2 dollar shop....my wife getting lots of small gifts for family here.

,,Dinner,4.0,,"Amazing!!!
I'm in love with this place!!!
It's soooo characteristic.
Well..you can only enhoy it a lot. You can choose a lot to eat. Try to sit at the table in the midle of the venue..they should mot charge..they try to push you to sit inside their restaurants or at their tables outside so they charge you taxes. The wine is small amd really expensive: 16$ per a tiny bottle."
,,Nice area,5.0,,It was very fun as you can find some great goodies at this place! Some days before the Chinese New Year eve and everything was beautiful decorated. Don’t miss it!
,,A must visit experience,5.0,,"Spent a very enjoyable afternoon strolling around Chinatown and enjoying the unique atmosphere. The smells, colours, noise make this a lively place to shop, eat and walk"
,,Attractive spots,4.0,,"Chinatown at Singapore is very special place for shopping, eat at street stall or restaurant, or just walk around and take pictures. We can buy traditional gift and souvenirs specially that related with Chinese's new year on february 16th this year. The red colour makes this place more colourful and attractive. Even crowded, we still have fun and enjoyed the the atmosphere."
,,A very exciting place,4.0,,"Singapore’s Chinatown is quite large and is easily accessible by underground train, bus or taxi. It is stuffed full of colourful shops selling everything one could imagine of a Chinese origin. Food, drinks, clothes, trinkets, toys, electrical goods - even a money changer., Chinese doctor, herbalist, fortune teller, etc. In addition to the Chinese heritage Centre one may visit two large Hindu temples."

,,Good Shopping Town,4.0,,"China town is another place in SG to visit
Food Street, Shopping are the key things
Chinese new year made this place more attractive with lights and decoration with all red colored theme everywhere
try out some shopping for goodies
was kept alreted to watch out for pick pocketing as the place is most of the time will be busy it seems , but again no worries I see Police walking around the streets and relatively safer , but staying alert is better"
,,"Busy, hot, authentic",4.0,,"We wandered down here on a stinking hot and humid day. There is a tiny visitor centre and a massive temple, which is well worth a visit. Also lots of food shops selling hawker food."
,,Must see,5.0,,"Fantastic place to spend a few hours. The colours, smells and vibrancy are amazing. People are friendly and some great eating options."
,,too crowded,2.0,,Too much of crowd here. If you are really in to street shopping it's good for you but same time you can't move easily in shops and make selection as they are too crowded.
,,The real deal,5.0,,"Cheap food, cheap merchandise and tourist souvenirs, interesting markets, old historical buildings, multi cultural. Fun for the whole family. Large shopping malls too."
,,Low rise Old Singapore,4.0,,"We stumbled across this area of Singapore as we stayed at Carlton Tower hotel on our stopover from Australia to UK.
Such a lovely feel about this area. Hidden gem.
Great choice of restaurants and bars too. You can cross over the main road into the main Chinatown street, which is full of stalls selling all the Chinese goods you would expect too. Nice for a wander for a few hours.
Really liked the vibe."
,,"cheap tourism, no atmosphere",1.0,,everybody working there (shops like restaurants/bars) is only focused on you money. On top the quality of goods and food is on level like mass tourist places offer
,,Interest Place,5.0,,Exit A to Pagoda Street from Chinatown MRT. You can buy some souvenirs here. Chinatown and Sri Mariamman Temple is near here.
,,Fun for Kids,4.0,,"The buildings are great, but this is 100% a tourist trap, so enjoy it for what it is. Our nine year old son loved it, as lots of little shops with touristy items and things for kids. We have a very cool painting of his name that was a joy to watch being made. So, if you are looking for inexpensive gift souvenirs, postcards, etc., it's a good place for shopping and a walk. Nearby, some of the indoor malls are really only visited by locals, so easy to get a break, if needed."
,,Revisit,5.0,,"Loved the atmosphere Picked up local souvenirs to take home Best place for tea shirts bags ,tourist bits and pieces"
,,Traditional street food,5.0,,"Amazing place to visit, very authentic, some of the menus were mad to us Europeans but plenty of other things to eat. Loved the atmosphere, the shops, the people definitely worth a visit"
,,Festive !,4.0,,Great place to visit around the Chinese New Year - in January and February. Lively atmosphere and very festive. Good shopping and local food.
,,Cheap and tasty food plus culture,5.0,,"A must do in Singapore. Vibrant great food, go to the 2nd floor of the Chinatown complex -not food street for a true local experience. It was a bit hard to find but well worth it."
,,East side of South Bridge road is interesting,4.0,,"Chinatown has developed very positive especially the east side of Soth Bridge Road. We liked very much of new restaurants along the Ann Siang rd, Club street and Amoy rd. It is defenetly woth to visit at night time."
,,A definite must,5.0,,"Only thing, not really a negative per say, but with the CNY coming up there was too many people, roads were too congested and restaurants were too busy. Otherwise, definitely an experience to check out. Very neat to wander around.
Definitely a place to try Chinese food and buy lots of souvenirs!!!"
,,Lovely,5.0,,"Great area highly recommended, good places to eat and lots to see. Best prices for gifts too, 2/3 SGD for key rings and magnets etc.
People are friendly, it look great as it’s all dressed up too.
On the hop on bus tour so stop off for an hour or so to see"
,,Lovely Atmosphere,5.0,,This is the place to be if you’re looking for good food and a lively atmosphere at night. Had some crab curry at this corner restaurant and it was fantastic! Besides food you can also find some souvenir shops.
,,A must visit for Singapore,5.0,,"Chinatown is a place on its own, lots of stalls and places to eat. Since our last visit 10years ago they have updated Smith Street where the food market is. There are a lot of improvements which have been done and luckily they have not lost the atmosphere in updating it. The food is good and reasonably cheap. Bottles of beer, soft drinks or water can be bought separately from people who will bring them to your table. There is also a temple that can be visited."
,,Very touristy!,3.0,,"If you have some free time just go and have a look, but I wouldn’t say that it’s a must. The souvenirs that you can buy are cheap, but also low quality and manufactured in bulk. You can find the same ones in all of Asia! Everyone tries to convince you atch to buy or stay in their own restaurant.
Good point is the free WiFi! Just connect to check TripAdvisor reviews about restaurants.
Worth to have a look at the Hawker centre! Really cheap! Though the nearby one on Maxwell road is better.
Don’t make the same mistake as us, that thought that the food courts were some food stands on the street. The real food court is on the second floor in a huge building."
,,Fun place to visit,4.0,,"To really enjoy Chinatown, I recommend you book your hotel in the area and then you can just step out the front door and you are there! Lots of stores; lots of restaurants; handy to the subway system. There is so much color and culture everywhere you turn."
,,Chinatown Singapore,5.0,,"Chinatown, a place with all the fantastic things and foods. You can find local Chinese and China food here. If you come to Singapore, you must come to the Chinatown. A place with historical building and story. You can find Chinatown Point, Hotel, eating hawker and restaurants. Nearest MRT stations will be Chinatown and Outram Park MRT Station. There are Indian Temple, Buddhist Tooth Temple."
,,A real Chinatown.,5.0,,"Located close to the city this is a charming place to visit. Stroll along and enjoy all the nice shops.
Lots of restaurants- stop for something to eat- preferably vegetarian. We enjoyed Chinese New Year now in January.the year of the dog. A fantastic party and never seen so much people."
,,Good cheap sovignier shopping,4.0,,"Singapore has very expensive shopping, so best place to buy sovigniers for ur loved ones in singapore is china town market."
,,Interesting experience,4.0,,"For two Canadian girls traveling we quite enjoyed Chinatown we stayed in the area and it was close to everything the food booths would
Let us sample foods
Gave us directions helped us cross street with umbrellas when it's raining
Very good experience maybe not our preference of food but we did manage to try a few food stalls markets were also very cheap for souvenirs"
,,Giid For a Bargain,3.0,,"If you want cheap food, which is rare in Singapore, this is a place to go although the variety is limited.

,,Buzzing with people and a great place for food.,5.0,,"My hotel was located in the heart of Chinatown and what a great spot.
Located literally at the doorstep are all the food stalls you could possibly want and shops/stalls selling all sorts of goods.

The Chinese words for Chinatown is Niu Che Shui where by there are cow pulling the cart which transport water. Nowadays, this place is still populated with Chinese and you can see all sort of Chinese restaurants everywhere. There is a so called night market where there are many stalls selling souvenirs and arts stuff.

Just like most other Chinatowns you get heaps of stalls where you can buy heaps of touristy trinkets, food stalls where the quality was surprisingly good and prices reasonable compared to the other Singaporean restaurants, but not super cheap. It's very crowded as well. I wouldn't say it's a must-see in Singapore but good if you're hungry and want some reasonable food."

,,Brilliant atmosphere,5.0,,So good we went twice! Found a great food place and we enjoyed the lion dance down the main road. Was very busy but it didn't put us off. Got a great paper cut out portrait that they do whilst stood in front of them. Also bought a grain of rice that a man had written my name on and put inside a keyring. Great place a definite must!
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,"I stayed in Chinatown while I was in Singapore, and would definitely recommend visiting or staying there. It’s a bustling place with lots to see. Market stalls of many kinds, many food places, interesting buildings, temples, the list goes on. Bring your camera! My go to place to eat around here was the hawker centre upstairs on smith street near new bridge road."
,,No I don't want a new suit!!!,4.0,,"Any visit to Singapore should include a visit to Chinatown. If you are around for Chinese New Year it can get very busy, particularly at weekends. As more MRT lines are opening in Singapore getting here has become much easier. There are also lots of bus routes that will deliver you to the destination. Much of Chinatown is around Pagoda Street and their are lots of small shops selling a very wide range of interesting merchandise. If you don't look Singaporean, and with such a diverse population who does, you will certainly be approached by tailors offering you new suits, trousers and shirts. If that is what you wish to purchase then fine but if not it can be a nuisance. On the corner of Smith Street and New Bridge Road there is a department store called CK (nothing to do with the underwear company) and upstairs a Chinese Supermarket called Da You, always worth a visit. A sad part of the visit is the old Majestic Theatre. The facade is still there but inside it is often used for market stalls. It featured in a Singapore movie of the 1980s called 'Forever Fever'. Thankfully the Singapore authorities have maintained the look and style of Chinatown without making it too touristy."

,,The Best Chinatown,5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore has to be the most exciting Chinatown I have visited anywhere in the world. (so far)

,,Difficult to Avoid really.,4.0,,"There is so much to see here. From the decorated streets to the Maxwell food centre, multiple shopping complexes and other hawker centres. Even though some parts are set up for the throngs of tourists that flow through here daily, this is a most civilised area with very nice people. Don’t miss the back streets and alleys that have equally amazing architecture and some beautiful little parks to marvel at in such a compact area as this."

,,Overall disappointing,1.0,,Picked up at our hotel to be taken down to Chinatown. We then boarded a coach that took us no more than 20m su h a waste of time. Then into a Chinese chemist which was basically asking us to buy stuff from them. The down Smith st to eat dinner if you can call it that. The food was terrible apart from the mango pudding. We then had time to shop at the markets. The highlights of the evening were the tri Shaw ride a sad bumboat tour. Overall this tour your could do yourself and save yourself a lot of money in the process
,,Nice atmosphere,4.0,,"We stayed at a hotel near Chinatown and we walked passed Chinatown on our way back to the hotel.

I liked the atmosphere. It was pretty happening every night. Plenty of places to eat, plenty of places to buy souvenirs - all at a very affordable price! Shops there open til quite late too."
,,Alot to see and buy,4.0,,Buddha relic Temple is here also a great Indian temple. The food is great but more pricey than right across the street in peoples park or inside the chinatown complex which is right next to the buddha relic temple. I was here for 2 weeks so I Went to the complex 2nd floor to get food alot. I like the thai place which had garlic chicken and good sweet amd sour chicken for only 4.50 or 6.00 for the sweetandsour.

,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,"I went there and felt like I'd be in China. -That's how I imagine China looks like. All over the streets there are these typical red lanterns. I also visited the Chinese Temple over there, what you should do, when you're there and interested in different religions. I had the luck that there was a ceremony when I wanted to go in so I could seen how they pray like.
Good place to visit, you don't need a lot of time over there."

Everything is so cheap and great things to get souvenirs for your trip . Then stop for some lunch and not expensive . I even caught a free dragon show competition while I was there . Prefect afternoon in Singapore . There is a temple ( dress accordingly) in order to visit inside .
,,My favourite Chinatown!,5.0,,"In my opinion this is one of the world's best Chinatowns. To give you a little context I have visited London, KL, San Francisco, Los Angeles, NYC.... and always enjoy the Chinatown experience, but Singapore tops them all.
We usually arrive by the Buddha Tooth temple and walk in to the market stalls and restaurants.
Don't be afraid to bargain at the stalls, you can usually get about 20% off the price they are asking.
I have picked up some really beautiful things from here (even though I am sure are not authenticate original Chinese products) that will hold a lot of sentimental value for the rest of my life.
This place is good for sightseeing, shopping and eating, so it comes very high on my list of Singapore must do's."

,,Colorful,4.0,,We visited Chinatown on a holiday. It was crowded but manageable. We were fortunate that a dragon and lion festival was taking place. It was interesting and beautiful to see.

,,Nice,4.0,,"There are nice streets, shops, restaurants and religious places. 2 hours of visit enough excluding meals."
,,Great place to visit in Singapore,3.0,,"This is great place to meet local chinese people, 3 MRT station around here, A lot of stalls offering all kinds of souvenirs.but it was crowded and hot"
,,Use the Pagoda Street MRT exit,4.0,,"It took us several tries to find the true Chinatown, or Niu Che Shui (ox cart water as it is officially known). Because it is a sprawling location and has temples and Chinese restaurants on the edge, as well as malls with the name Chinatown in it, it is easy to go to the wrong place.

There are lots of photos available on the web. The Tourist Chinatown is essentially five interesecting streets filled with shops and stall that are all about 10-15 feet wide.

While to the untrained eye it all looks similar and cheap, there are some genuinely higher quality shops that sell more unusual gifts, souvenirs, or collectibles. One place does a mix of decorative wood and paper fans some of which are very well made and look nice sitting on a mantle. Another specialises in quality lacquered goods.

I would stay clear of the tailors frankly. Tried a few and their materials looked very cheap.

There is a museum there but I did not try it. The Buddhist Tooth Relic Temple is a better cultural resource generally and is opposite a wet market and hawkers site mainly used by locals.

Chinatown Street food is generally clean and some dishes are tasty. But there is also the hawker site at the Chinatown Complex that has between 50-100 food stalls and nearly as many cuisine specialties. Also good, dressier Chinese food can be found on orchard street in the ION mall.

One thing worth trying is the jerky. Several stores sell it along the outside edges of Chinatown. Lim Chee Guam always seemed to have a queue and we tried the pork version which was delicious. Similar to char siu but more tender."
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"We visited Chinatown on our first night in Singapore and enjoyed the experience so much that we went back another two times. Clean, safe, great fun and lots to see and fab places to eat."

,,"Noisy, busy, great food - we love it!",5.0,,"Highly recommend a visit here! It is noisy and a bit full on but some great bargains to be had in the markets and the food at the hawker centres is AMAZING! Both maxwell centre and Hong Lim are A+ recommendations from us, you can usually score two main meals + two drinks for under $13 SGD."
,,"Visually stunning, but.....",3.0,,"When entering Chinatown, this precinct is visually stunning. There are lots of colours and nicely painted buildings in small lanes. There are many stalls and places to find something to eat.
Be careful though. The stall owners are quite pushy to the point of making you feel uncomfortable. They will do just about anything for a sale. There are numerous shops selling the same cheap items and the staff will watch you like a hawk, they will follow your every move.
Go for a look but be careful."
,,Food and shops galore,4.0,,We arrived early on saturday morning. Coloriful and large area to explore. Great place to buy souvenirs at very cheap prices. So much choices for food and again at great prices.

,,How the used to live,1.0,,"This exhibit has recently been renovated, provided an even more enjoyable experience .

Although we did not eat there, we did see a lot of very great looking restaurants!"
,,Shopping shopping,4.0,,"I would not say it is cheap.. But you can get lot of soveneirs here. If you buying gifts a lot, consider this place. I wouldn't recommend this place to buy high priced products like lenses. Visit mariamman temple which is the oldest one in Singapore."

,,A decked up little corner,4.0,,"Take Exit A from China town MRT and walk through Pagoda street. Good weather is always a bonus. Most of the food there isn't halal. However, it's the best place in Singapore to shop for cheap souvenirs specially if you want to get a lot for co-workers or friends. You can buy the same stuff from Bugis for a little more money. The red lanterns stay there year round. The shophouses are well maintained. It gets better after sunset once the lanterns light up. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a 5 minute walk away. You can also explore an Indian Temple as well as a Mosque in the area."
,,don't miss the hawkers at china town complex,5.0,,Chinatown is my favorite area of Singapore. it's great day or night. the food at the Chinatown complex is by far the best and cheapest around. don't forget hawker chans Michelin star chicken and rice for $3!

,,Improvement over the years,5.0,,"Visit Chinatown regularly. It has definitely improved over the years to make it more attractive to tourists. You can buy very cheap souvenirs here. If you wish to eat more authentic local food, and visit a local wet market, do drop by the Chinatown complex. Avoid the last few stalls at the wet market (basement) at the back if you are an animal lover, as there will be frogs, turtles etc on sale. Second floor has a very wide variety of local food at much more reasonable prices."
,,Sooo cool!,5.0,,"From food to artifacts you have stoles selling a bit of everything here. And the temples in the middle of all of that.. Is for sure a mandatory place to go and enjoy and don't be afraid, just try whatever, will be unique for sure!!"

,,Tourist trap,2.0,,"Can have some so called tourist feel in Chinese culture
but for a local, it is just too tourist and china Chinese based.
It is not very relavent to local Singapore Chinese culture.
Just a place that china Chinese in sg sell china good (with mark up) to western tourist. pretty scamming place for ppl that feel like experience authentic South East Asian culture"
,,Crowded but pleasant,3.0,,"Feels like old town with old buildings. But lots of great chinese food there. I love the ""Roti"" shop. Their bread was delicious and cheap. But the toilet there was smelly awful and cost 10 cent per person. There was an indian man keeping the toilet and asking you that 10 cent. But we don't see him cleaning the toilet. So terrible service. Not much to see. Just the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. Also 1 shop that sells cheap delicious choclate. 3 packs of toblerone only 10 dollars. Or 2 packs of hershey only 15 dollars. Must visit shop"
,,Authentic and small,4.0,,Few small streets with small shops and many stalls. Lots of junk but can also find some nice bargains
,,Budget place with food n others,4.0,,We visited this place...found it to have reasonable in cost but great in variety n people were very friendly. We loved the variety of fruits n dry fruits. It has MRT n Bus stations.
,,Chinatown,5.0,,"Chinatown has lots of souveniers selling there,and the souveniers are cheap as well,abouts $2 for 3 sets(24).But sadly Chinatown is usually raining.It's okay ,just remember to bring an umbrella.TQ for reading my review."
,,Authentic amongst the all the frenetic activity,4.0,,"Great experience, with shops and eateries galore. Do eat at one of the 'real' Chinese restaurants, as the food is amazing. Cheap bargains and lots of souvenirs abound. Easy to get to and a 'must do' for the casual visitor."
,,CNY madness,3.0,,"Revitalised many times as a tourist destination, it's also a major area where locals live and eat. Over the years, many china migrants have also found home here

Besides the traditional architecture and stalls, many hip restaurants, hotels and cafes have also opened on the fringe of chinatown like keong saik road"
,,Place not to be missed,5.0,,Chinatown in Singapore is a place not to be missed. There are many Chinese cultural stuffs and selected traditional and authentic Chinese local food in China town that no other places offered. The entire street is about less than 1.0 km with stalls of all sorts of stuffs on both sides of the street. Eateries and souvenirs are very specially available in Chinatown.
,,Good time in Singapore,4.0,,"I had chosen a hotel in Chinatown for my stopover in Singapore. This area is quite good for staying around because it has lots of attractions such as markets, Restaurants and relaxing streets.
It is in walking distance to Gardens by the Bay and other place.
Authentic atmosphere is guaranteed."
,,My favourite Chinatown,5.0,,"I sometimes find chinatowns disappointing but Chinatown in Singapore is the real McCoy. For me it beats chinatowns in London, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York by a long way. It seems authentic and a real life working Chinatown, not a tourist attraction."
,,Experience China in Singapore,4.0,,Very good outing... Lots to shop and many restaurant options. The place is buzzing with activities and bustling crowd. Very lively atmosphere and colorful place. Must visit!
,,Great to visit!,4.0,,"Great to spend a couple of hours with friends, to see, eat and shopping anything you need! I went with my friends on a weekend and a big mistake as it was totally packed! I highly recommend you to go on a weekday as we did in our second visit."
,,Bustling,4.0,,"Vibrant and bustling. What a great place to visit whether you want to shop, eat or just take in the sights and smells. We spent a few hours wandering around shopping, eating and taking photo's. Very friendly people and still full of bargains but do be wary of the camera shops in particular. Definitely a place to visit while in Singapore for it's colour, culture, food and bargain shopping."
,,Good place to shop for Souvenirs,3.0,,"It’s a bit of a tourist attraction it’s clean and safe, the food and drink are ok if a little expensive especially if the buses from the cruise ships are in when prices seem to go up.
If you want a more Authentic China Town you need to go elsewhere in Asia.
If you want better and cheaper food try the hawker stalls just down the road or in the base of the shopping centres where the workers eat.
Well served by the MRT"
,,Looking for souvenirs,3.0,,"China town is a good place to find anything with affordable price. I went there just to explore the place and looking for souvenirs similar to bugis street, you can also do culinary"
,,Nice for a good promenade,4.0,,We add a nice time just pumping around . The place is cute and you can buy whatever you want or eat Chinese food . Nice decoration.
,,Like in China,5.0,,"I visit here because i want to shopping, it is prefer to buy key chain or another souvenir here and more cheaper. With SGD 10 you can get 42 keychain."
,,A different China Town,4.0,,"The China Town in Singapore, called Nu Che Shui, meaning Ox, cart and water, is one of the oldest resident places for Chinese migrants in earlier days. It does not look like old China town but has many shopping malls and hotels there. Those high rise buildings bring in the modern architecture and style to this place. However, among all the buildings, there are shop houses, restaurants, street food stalls in the whole area. You can find both traditional Chinese provincial food and authentic local Chinese food. The people in the area are normally old fellows who like to spend the day there drinking coffee and tea to kill time. You can also find some special traditional Chinese art craft and souvenirs that you cannot find anywhere else in Singapore. The night life there is also hot as there are many bars and clubs. Overall, the China Town in Singapore is different. It is too modern as compared to old China and too traditional as compared to some other China Towns overseas."
,,Excellent,5.0,,We were told about this by a local and glad we were as it was really good with few tourists. Cheap markets and good local food. Get MTR as this is easiest. Most locals eat at Hawker Court on Smith Street and you can do some haggling at the markets which is fun.
,,Foodies paradise...and great gifts too.,5.0,,"Just follow the locals to find the best places to eat...had our best meal in Smith Street...a lunch ""set"" of soup, rice, greens, BBQ chicken, pork and duck for S$12...absolutely delicious."
,,Visited a couple of days and enjoyed lunch at Yucun Kitchen,4.0,,"Off a cruise ship, and found our way to Chinatown on the MTR fairly easily. Wandered the shops (bought a few small things at reasonable prices - shop & stalls) & soaked up the atmosphere incl the various religions located here. Nothing very unique here - look or items for sale (also didn't seem to have the designer knockoffs usually available in asian markets).

Decided on lunch & selected the chilli crab at Yucun Kitchen which was a nice meal, in air conditioned premises (or could sit outside to soak up the atmosphere & watch the passing pedestrians). I think about $85 for sring rolls, rice, buns, chilli crab & 3 large beers.

Did visit one of the larger department stores where prices seemed to be the same as home - quality garments on sale but didn't buy anything.

Ended up back there the next day for more local food & tried the same restauraunt & 2 different main meals - staff very friendly, food good, served quickly & reasonably priced."
,,a small chinatown,3.0,,"Plenty of shops that sell everything from cheap gifts and chinese and Singaporian gifts. Tailors will harrass you to make you ""a very good suit or dress"""
,,You can find everything here,5.0,,"From the temples to market. From michelin-starred restaurant to hawker centee. You can find manything here - and, this is one of my fav areas in SG. Buddha tooth temple is my favorite where you can find a good place for meditation here. Hawker chan, 1star michelin is also not far from the temple which just 20steps away from mrt purple line."
,,"nice place, very small and very similar",3.0,,"nice place, very small and very similar if you have time go visit there but it's not a must nice souvenirs shops"
,,"Very quirky, great for all types of traveller",5.0,,"The lanterns lighting the streets are lovely and quirky and there is an array of food on offer. There are also lots of quirky clothes/souvenir stalls. Some restaurants are expensive for backpackers, but if you walk near the MRT station there's a place called Hawkers offering a wide array of local street food at very cheap prices."
,,poor chinatow,2.0,,"Comparing this Chinatown with anothers of other countries....this is very poor, with bad restaurants....."
,,Lots of aspects,3.0,,"Food streets, markets, general shopping. The night markets are fun and it’s worth a look around. I suspect we only scratched the surface."
,,Nice neighbourhood,5.0,,"The Singapore Chinatown is a nice place to spend a few hours. The sellers are nice and not too intrusive (like their counterparts in KL), the restaurants are great, and if you want to buy genuine arts and crafts pieces you can actually make a find or two."
,,Fun - casual shopping,5.0,,Enjoyable and rather cheap shopping spot. Good food options available from juices to hot foods and everything was reasonably priced. 🍡🍢🥟🍛🥤 💄💍💅🏻💆🏻‍♂️💆🏻‍♀️
,,Chinatown,5.0,,Dropped into Chinatown via the SMRT and took a good look around. It is starting to change but still has the various stores and individuals that are keen to get you in the door and make a sale.
,,So festive,3.0,,"Lots of food stalls and shopping stalls around. All you can do here is eat and shop! The food is good and the prices for shopping is not that expensive. Fake items are also rampant. But hey, it's ""china"" town ;)"
,,Very touristy.,3.0,,"Walked around the streets for an hour or so, found it a bit boring, with just many shops selling junky souvenirs. I thought it lacked history and character. Maybe I missed something."
,,Nice for first comers,3.0,,"There are only about 3 streets where can go and walk around, nice feeling of China with low price merchandise. There are two special temples, one Hindi and another one is Chinese. By walking inside you get the local and spiritual feeling.
However, walking around without a guide will end in about 1 to 2 hours."
,,A must visit for first timers,4.0,,"This place is a must for tourists and first time visitors.
It’s amazing how many shops and eateries are crammed into Chinatown.

My overseas friends were impressed with the range of knick knacks and souvenirs sold to suit their budget. One can find keychains, magnets, shawls, ornaments, etc. They returned to get more souvenirs.

The place is always filled with activity from afternoon till night. It becomes more festive as the Chinese New Year approaches. Then Singaporeans come to rub shoulders with their fellow citizens when the entire place is cramped and bustling."
,,A great place to explore,5.0,,"I visited this area during the Chinese New Year Festival; lots of interesting things going on, options for eating and shopping"
,,A must do in Singapore,4.0,,"Its alive with people and colour, can be a little annoying with the people pestering you. Its 'cheap' and simple. A must do when in the city. Get cash before you go, was running around looking for a cash machine as many places only take cash. Some of the restaurants staff have pretty basic English too which can be a little painful."
,,Chinatown Singapore.,5.0,,"Visited Chinatown & spent half a day taking in the sights & sounds. The shops/stalls open mid morning & as you can imagine are aimed at the tourists. As with the rest of Singapore this is the most upmarket Chinatown I have been to,the place is so clean. The stalls sell all sorts of souvenirs & trinkets. Walk through the shops/stall & find Buddhist & Hindu temples.
We were with Chinese friends so crossed the main road via the foot bridge & ate (with the locals) in a large food hall (recommend) which sold all forms of food & was very cheap.
I would recommend Chinatown to people visiting Singapore for a stroll through which I'm sure would be found interesting."
,,Rich in history and tradition,5.0,,"A place that had withstood the test of time yet preserving its heritage and beauty. Multi religious site where u can find a Hindu temple, a Methodist Church & a mosque. Not to mention yummy eateries around. Site is easily accessible via MRT (metro) alight at Chinatown station."
,,TYPICAL AND EXPECTED,3.0,,"Where isn't there a Chinatown? Even in Chinese Singapore, there's quite a large Chinatown of about 5 square blocks.

It has a wet market, old fashion food court called ""hawker centre"" and gifts shops everywhere.

Take a Eat and Cycle Ride around Singapore and stop in Chinatown for a meal."
,,small but good,5.0,,I love chinatowns and this one is small but we had fun and the food court there was exciting with lots of food options
,,Chinatown street food,3.0,,Not the best Chinatown that I have ever been in. The main streets are ok bu the side streets are noisy and not very neat. I have been to many Chinatowns and this is not one of my favs. Plenty of street food and many restaurants in the area. The hawkers are everywhere and at the door trying to lure you in. Food courts are very popular here and all kinds of food can be had and found. The most popular place to eat are food courts.
,,Shop & Dine,5.0,,"You can go crazy on food! Have both Halal & non Halal. You can find cheap toiletries and such! Best place to go with family and friends. Hotel, they have it too."
,,Good place for cheap deals,4.0,,I bought a couple of really inexpensive things here. Good place to get some souvenirs and trinkets.. u might also find some good deals on bags here.. not s must visit place.. but if you’ve got time to kill then I suggest you go visit this market for a bit
,,Amazing place,4.0,,"If you love shopping, eating and drinking then this is the place . Lots of shops where you can shop for your loved ones in reasonable price. A big market with ample of restaurants for sea food and beer ☺️
You can get foot message also . Some shops are selling 1$ stuff also which can be good savonier"

,,Bustling,5.0,,"Many Chinese eateries, cheaper food, clothes, toiletries often on levels 2 and 3s of shopping complexes. Tailoring services.

On street level, you find eateries, gold smiths, provision shops, shops, massage parlours that reflect cultural heritage. Every shop is neat and interesting.
Every street name has it's own story. Google it."

,,"Go here to eat, busy but fun and historic too",4.0,,"the buildings are preserved and (probably) no longer occupied by working women of the earlier years in the 20th century. History, tacky and not so tacky souvenirs and gorgeous street food abound."
,,Shopping and Eating,4.0,,"Typical Chinatown, but very clean. My wife found a number of gifts for friends for upcoming birthdays and holidays. So we now have to buy a suitcase to return to LA. Quality of products seems high and also a little more pricy than Shangai."
,,Food,4.0,,"Very interesting quarter of Singapore, I spent an afternoon and evening strolling about enjoying the sites, sounds and fantastic food, restaurants or street stalls to choose from. Worth a visit."
,,Busy and great food,4.0,,This is a very busy part of town where you just want to go and have some food. The food is great but there are a lot (and I mean a lot!) of tourists.
,,Love this place,5.0,,"Such character about the place but it comes Alive in the evening and night with all the lanterns that light up and the huddle and bustle and local out eating the amazing food.

It has craft stalls and interesting shops, everyone is so friendly, there are temples there too I loved it"
,,Very colorful and many local flavors.,5.0,,"The Chinatown area is large and filled with restaurants, food court, shopping stalls and lots of color. I'd definitely recommend a visit and allowing a 2-3 hours"
,,Eye opening,5.0,,"My friend and myself went there to look around and it shocked us coming from Australia, they eat food that shocked us and found some very unfriendly people as they couldn't understand us and visa versa. The smells in some places were awful and in some places the cleanlyness needed a lot to be desired so we left with out eating but went back there on a tour and went to a restaurant that served Australian chinese food which im use to and it was great"
,,Good visit.,4.0,,"Fun place to look around buy souvenirs. And from other China towns I've been to around the world, it was quite clean! It's definitely not something to spend an entire day on but a quick stop is nice."
,,Terrible experience.,1.0,,Do not go here unless you speak Mandarin or know what you are doing. The place is full of wonderful things but a rip of and down right fleecing if you fall a prey. Shops are pushy and make you uncomfortable to look around without buying.
,,Convenient location for souvenirs and good food,4.0,,"Chinatown is centrally located & easy to get to via MRT- Chinatown station. You can always find a good meal & lots of SG souvenirs/trinkets. Plenty of cultural places to visit: The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, Hindu Temple, and the Chinatown Heritage Centre. Easily spend at least 3 hours here."
,,Okay,4.0,,Always want to visit a china town if there is any around. Okay first impression. Didn't have time to see more.
,,Just look around,4.0,,"Here you will find many many shop and food stalls. If you visit Singapore, you can't forget China Town. Best way to travel to is the Subway."
,,"Along with Little India, one of the places I appreciated most in Singapore",4.0,,"I mostly enjoyed the food, and the atmosphere - which was way more up my alley than the miles of luxury shopping malls in other parts of town. Found some great souvenirs. And ate incredibly well at a seafood place in the centre of Chinatown, in an outdoor foodcourt. I asked for the squid dish to be spicy, and I was not disappointed."
,,Cute Town,4.0,,We stayed at a hotel in Chinatown. The chinatown is well decorated and is probably one of the business centres at Singapore. Fancy lighting in the evening.
,,Just loved it,5.0,,"Very vibrant and lively, lovely decoration seen around this place. Lots of small restaurants, coffee shop and dormitory are there in this place."
,,Fun part of Singapore,5.0,,"I’ve been to China many times, but it’s great to see the China towns of the world. This is a spotless area and reminds you of old Shanghai or Beijing. Many restaurants, temples, narrow streets and shops. Must see and easy metro stops in the area!"
,,Interesting,5.0,,This has changed so much since we saw it 10 years ago. It’s clean full of amazing foods and quaint shops. We spent about five hours walking as well as a few stops for food and drink. You can eat anywhere now as it’s all very clean . The food was excellent and the cost wasn’t too bad. We will be going back.
,,5 day visit,5.0,,Brilliant loved haggling - lot of the same stuff but great all the same - got some great bargains and some souvenirs
,,Stepping Back in Time into the Chinese Quarter !!,4.0,,"No visit to Singapore would be complete without going into Chinatown. Given the large chinese presence there this is a mini China - with all that is on offer !! Food, artifacts, feng shui items, clothes et al !!!"
,,"a must, when visiting S'pore",4.0,,"on every S*pore visit, I have to walk throug Chinatown. But this time I felt a bit confused. Too many shops have been sutted down. Not the spirit and life of the past. Hope, this area will not get down totally."
,,Not for me,1.0,,"Went to Chinatown so excited to see the authentic cuisine but was bitterly disappointed.

Numerous food stalls all very busy at a very reasonable price. But it was filthy. Not sure if it appears worse because Singapore is so clean but it was very dirty. Public toilets were dirty with urine on the seat, no toilet paper and men hanging around the women's toilet.

Food smelt amazing and is obviously very popular but not for me."
,,Loved Chinatown,5.0,,"Armed with my trusty Lonely Planet book we headed to Chinatown twice! The markets sell lots of cheap Singapore souvenirs, some electronics and toys, silk paintings, jade jewellery and Taylor’s and clothes.
Lots of little places to eat or have a nice beer and people watch.
We went to Momma Kongs and had the chilli crab and went to Chinatown Point and had a fish foot experience!"
,,Chinatown was fun,4.0,,visited China town on 04th oct and the place looked great and was well decorated for Lantern festival. The places was very nicely decorated. All the lanes are filled for souvenir gift and restaurants. Tourist can visit but it is not Must visit place
,,Chinatown,3.0,,First it is all the same place as Malaysia as everywhere. Not too much to buy all shops offer the same products with a different price. Bars are every where. restaurants are poor decoration and seems not
,,Nice food,4.0,,In this area you can find soon many food with affordable price rather than in orchard road. Also the confenience store here is cheaper than in orchard area. After exit from MRT Chinatown you can find the Chinatown market.
,,"Wonderful place of diverse heritage, culture and foodie paradise",5.0,,"The name ""Chinatown"" will typically send a message of an area predominantly occupied and operated by people of Chinese race. However in Singapore, over the decades, it has become an interesting ""melting pot"" area for people of all races, cultures and religions, to live and manage their businesses there. Hence the area has become interestingly colourful, very often providing tourists and even locals, an incredible experience of diverse origins.

Just food alone, it was a paradise for anyone, spoilt for choices, to enjoy cuisines not only in different styles, but at different ambience and levels. For simple hawker food, there is the iconic Chinatown Complex Market & Food Centre along Smith Street, providing vert affordable yet delectable traditional food of Chinese, Indian, Malay, Eurasian, etc origins. This is the place where the world famous lowest cost Michelin Star chicken rice store, ""Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle"", is located, starting less than SGD 4.00 a meal.

Then you have the famous Sze Chuan Spicy Hot Pots along the main North Canal Road, One Michelin Star Asian fusion ""Meta Restaurant"" along with World Top 50's Australian style ""Burnt Ends"" restaurant and the famously long queue Japanese Inagi Donburi ""Man Man"" at Keong Saik. Not forgetting the popular Malay style Nasi Lemak at Kreta Ayer.

Apart from all the foodstuffs, the whole area is dotted with brilliant colonial times architectural buildings which the local government has invested huge resources to restore and maintain. Furthermore, places of interests include the huge buildings of worship like the beautiful Chinese temple - Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum, the Indian temple - Sri Mariamman Temple, both along South Bridge Road. Also smaller but significantly ones like Thian Hock Keng (Telok Ayer Street) and Sri Layan Sithi Vinayagar Temple.

For tourists who are looking for signature local produce to bring home, at various part of Chinatown, especially along Pogoda Street and inside the Chinatown Point Shopping Mall, they can be easily bought. Such as Singapore's famous sweet BBQ pork slices can be found with Fragrance Foodstuffs or Bee Cheng Hiang, or traditional chinese medicine with Hockhua Tonic or Yue Hwa Chinese products.

To make visiting easier, tourists can book their accomodations with the huge number of hotels, both mainstream, boutique and even backpackers lodge, in and around Chinatown. The whole place is so easily accessible and always bustling with activities.

Visit during Chinese New Year or Autumn Festival periods for even more memorable fun!

Definitely a place not to be missed!"

,,Many shops that carry the same cheap souvenours,3.0,,"After being spoiled by the beauty and cleanliness of Singapore, China town feels a little dirty.

Seniors playing Mah-jong. Kids selling bbq something on a stick. In other words - a very atmospheric, bustling and enjoyable Chinatown."
,,Quick visit,4.0,,We stopped in Chinatown for quick visit on our hop on hop off bus tour. Strolled the streets with small stores but had no time to check their inventories very carefully. Had some fruit juice on the food street. Our main target was to visit the Michelin star soya restaurants but it was closed as it was Wednesday. A really nice place to spend time and look around. Will have to come back with more time.

,,Bustling City,4.0,,"A bustling city with hidden surprises and souvenirs at almost every turn. Tourists interested in places of attraction can visit the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple or the Sri Mariamman Temple located where both are easily accessible by foot. Take a walk down the food street to taste some of the local delicacies.

For a cheaper option, tourists can also visit Chinatown complex located in front of the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple that sells various products such as fabrics, clothing, decorations and flip-flops to dried goods, vegetables and antiques. Those who are feeling hungry can also visit food court at the second level which offers a ton of local dishes.

For those who find the heat/humidity unbearable. Head down to the various shopping centres nearby such as chinatown point or people's park centre. An air-conditioned shopping centre selling products such as electronics, shoes and watches."
,,A true taste of China?,2.0,,"Read some great reports on the Food street in China town being the place for some seriously good tasting food!
Arrived to find the street had loads of catering stalls in the middle of the street with tables and chairs set up between and on the edges of the street. The whole street was manic, with tourists flocking in to taste their wares. We walked the length of the street and decided to try to find somewhere to sit and dine, this proved quite difficult, but we managed to find a vacant slot and I ordered a dish which looked very tasty on the menu board. When I received the ""Slop"" I tasted it and decided that I would not eat it and so ordered another dish which proved to be almost edible! All in all, The standards of hygiene was very low and the whole experience was not enjoyable, far better to go into a proper restaurant and dine properly"
,,Mostly for tourists,3.0,,First time i where in Singapore was in 1996 and the Chinatown was something different compared to now. Now it's mostly tourists and cheap souvenirs there.
,,Long street full of shops,4.0,,"Very long street full of stalls selling cheap touristy goods. Some items of poor quality but thats in whichever little india or China town you go to so nothing new there. Nice atmosphere, i believe would be better at night with the lights."

,,Much like other Chinatowns - expensive and touristy,3.0,,"I would recommend strolling around Chinatown, but to eat, or to shop even, cross the New Bridge Road and grab a bite to eat in the People's Park Complex. There's a hawker market and plenty of tasty local eats for half the price. And plenty of shopping options too."
,,Look for the A rating,3.0,,We visited Chinatown and associated food court. It was much like other markets and food courts and you don't need to fit it in if you don't have time. The food stalls are somewhat better than at other outdoor food courts and are rated A-D. I would suggest only eating at an A. And be careful about the restaurants along the sides. Some have no rating at all!

Stall holders were dismissive of a single Caucasian female looking, to be the point of being rude.
So many other places to visit in Singapore, so if short on time, not worth the bother."
,,Nice Solo Walk on a Week End Day,4.0,,"Found myself in Singapore on a weekend day. Around the clock work was getting old, so I went for a visit of the City. One of the stops was in Chinatown. Great experience, very informative, typical, and safe. Make sure to visit."

,,Interesting experience in an interesting city,5.0,,Chinatown is one of the original parts of this extraordinary city that is worth a visit from any traveller who finds themselves in Singapore with some time to spend. The markets are amazing and very busy. Be prepared to haggle for prices - it adds some better value for you and is fun. Food is plentiful and the sounds and sights are wonderful. We were in the city for the Chinese New Year celebrations and you could not help but be impacted by the passion of the locals.

The range of food is outstanding
Many stalls have won awards or cone highly recommended, or do my favourite thing and just join a large Q with the locals knowing it’s got to be good

,,"So much to see, try and eat!",5.0,,You can spend a few hours here or like me come every day you can. You can visit the many places of worship including the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple to watch ceremonies or shop in touristy or non-touristy areas. Watch older people play Chinese chess or visit the Chinese culture museum to see how people lived. But my favorite part is to eat. You can eat in air conditioned restaurants or highly suggest the Hawker stalls. Touristy one is the Chinatown Food Street on Smith. maxwell center is also tourist friendly. Had the chicken and rice at Tiang Tiang but for a unique local experience go to Chinatown center next and visit the wet market downstairs and the food stalls on second floor. People live in housing above. Try the soy sauce chicken and rice at Hawker Chen’s stall. Only $2 Singaporean dollars but be prepared for line. It was delicious and worth the wait. I had the sugar cane juice which in the weather is so incredibly refreshing. Wish I could try so much more but you can seriously eat all day there and for so cheap!
,,Could spend hours exploring,4.0,,"China town has a lot to offer, from Street markets, food centers, temples and malls there isn't must that you cannot find it China town."
,,Great place for culture and bargins,5.0,,"What a cracking place to lose a few hrs bargins everywhere, everything from shirts and dresses to souvenirs and nicknacks and the food was some of the best ive tried, but to truly get the best food the locals go 2 streets down from the main street this is the cheapest and best food chicken and rice $4.50 satays $3 and the variety of seafood amazing and of course the chilli crab loved it. all great for families with young I kids and elderly as well easy to get around a must for everyone"
,,Many China restaurants,5.0,,"May found many good food at food centre, main road got many China owned restaurants serving local China taste food (may not suitable if you don't like typical oily local China style food).

There is some seasonal decoration always available, best for night visit where lesser hot and you can enjoy the night scene from the pedestrian break Bridge.

This areas always crowded in night and Chinese festivals like Chinese new year and tang long festival (moon cake festival)."
,,Great food,4.0,,Great chinese streed food and snacks. Also a good place to learn how Singapore's history and culture evolved.
,,On the Singapore food trail,5.0,,Chinatown is foodie heaven and also an important part of Singapore’s early history. Explore the quaint shophouses and find out how much the area has progressed over 200 years. The hawker trade is one of the professions that had evolved and thrived to present day; with Hawker Chan earning his Michelin Star From humble beginnings..
,,Food food food!,5.0,,Craving for chinese and local singaporean food? Chinatown has the best choice for you! Walk around chinatown and look for the newly renovated food street plenty of choices for you to select from! Gifts shops are along the street too! Have fun in Chinatown Singapore!
,,Beautiful Chinese flea markets and culture,5.0,,"Very beautifully dressed up lanes of ornate Chinese flavors and flea markets. Full of souvenirs, gift shops, food, apparel & fashion accessories, more food and some amazing places that includes a Tin Tin shop, a Heritage museum & an Indian temple. This was the real Singapore back till late 60s, when the Chinese people used to live in the area. The look and feel of the buildings and surroundings still reminds you of the old Chinese ways, juxtaposed right besides the crowded high rises of Raffles & Marina Business area."
,,Stopover for 3 days,5.0,,A real taste of China. So many different places to eat and stalls. Bustling and people so friendly. Easy to get to using hop on hop off buses.
,,Highly recommend!,5.0,,"The Chinatown area in Singapore is worth a visit! If you have 3-4 hours to spare, jump on a train and stop by!

The area is very diverse! Though called Chinatown, Buddhist temple, mosque, and Hindu temple can all be found within a short distance of each other. The Hindu temple interested me the most; I have never visited one nor seen a ceremony. When I visited on Sunday around 11am, a Hindu ceremony went on, and I observed. Though knowing very little about the religion alone, I had a great cultural experience! Don’t forget to take off your shoes and socks before entering the temple!

Chinatown has a lot of mini shops all over the area. If one wants some cheap souvenirs (magnets, keychains, T-shirt’s etc), this area is perfect! Magnets tend to go about $2 each or 3 for $5. Most shops will agree to sell you 7 for $10.

The best part of Chinatown is food!!! One cannot miss 1) Hong Kong Soya Chicken, a Michelin starred food stall, and 2) Maxwell food court! There are a ton of food inside the foot court, and the most well known is Tian Tian Chicken rice! Super tasty for cheap! S$4.30 a chicken drumstick plate, and I was so in food heaven!

Watch for thieves in Chinatown as they are always a ton of tourists around!"

,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"What you'd expect temples and food, market stalls abound everywhere here not too pushy from the stalls and worth a look for the architecture. Food good and area pedestrianised for main three streets of it."
,,Couldnt get enough of Chinatown,5.0,,"What a special place and combination of sights, gifts, sounds and foods.

Clean and easy to navigate the hundreds of street vendors and their wares.

Stalls selling Chinese based gift items abound along with restaurants and street food sellers. Fortunately a few 7-11 Stores thrown in so you can buy cheaper drinks to stay hydrated!

I ate there every night of my stay ... Foregoing more expensive restaurants and pricey trendy establishments.

Plenty of dim sum and Peking Duck to go around.

A must visit...."

,,Certainly represents what it is supposed to,4.0,,This place is exactly the replica of what is it supposed to represent. It is a shopper's haven and certainly a place for foodies. If possible try visiting it in the evening. One just falls in love with the culture and way of life of the people. But beware that it will be crowded almost all the time.
,,Lanterns Made A Pretty Display.,5.0,,There was a lovely display of lanterns on display when we were there which enticed you towards Chinatown. It was lively and colourful and full of promise. A great time was had here.

,,Lots of things to see and food to feast on,5.0,,"Visiting Chinatown is always a gastronomic delight and a shopper's haven. One can buy almost anything from bookmarks to jewelries and kitchen wares.

,,I'm not usually nostalgic,4.0,,"I'm not usually nostalgic, but when it comes to olde China, what can I say? I miss the pirates, the vices, the inferences made by Jack Sparrow when he said ""You've clearly never been to Singapore.""*

For now we have to make do with Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, People's Plaza, Maxwell Food Centre, kopi tiams and TCM stores.

If you have the imagination, make you can look up at the windows on Smith St and be transported back to the days when they were full of cooing women, the streets full of blood and hawker carts.

HERE'S YOUR HOT TAKE: A good way to do this would be with the Singapore Indie Free Walking Tours that operate a pay-as-you-like 3 hour tour of Chinatown. Check their good name on TripAdvisor.

*Although the name Singapore did not appear until 100 years after Jack Sparrow made this utterance."
,,A fun place to shop,5.0,,"Loved going here clean and tidy, lots of little restaurants and cafes, plenty of fun shopping and some temples nearby (Buddha tooth relic).

,,Lot of foods,5.0,,"This is a place that traveler must go. Why? Maxwell Road Hawker Centre is over there and you must try 天天海南雞飯!

,,A visit here is a must do,4.0,,"Well worth a visit to absorb the atmosphere and take in the sights but the traders are very repetititive with every 2nd or 3rd stall selling identical goods at identical prices.

Chilli crab bun.... Scallop dumpling.... And a spectacular new find last night.... Coffee bun.... Imagine the best lotus bun... With coffee.... Mmmmmmmm. Also the Mango Snow Ice from the ice cream dessert shop is amazing
,,Thing of the past,2.0,,"Unfortunately the Chinatown markets are losing their appeal, dirty streets, dirty food outlets, smell of rotting rubbish isn’t my thing. If you want a cultural experience to say you’ve done it great but it’s not for me."
,,Another destination here in Singapore,4.0,,Must visit for first time visitors to the island nation. Plan to eat and spend at least half a day here.
,,Bargain city,5.0,,"If you want a souvenir if your trip to Singapore Chinatown should be your destination.
There are the usual tourist shops with similar wares and similar prices. Most will give you a discount for buying more than one of an item. I bought myself a beautiful sterling silver and jade bracelet and got a better price for my second bracelet.
There is the infamous Tintin shop, a bit incongruous in its location, lots of tailors - get a cheongsam in whatever fabrics you want and made to fit perfectly if you have time.
There are antique shops dotted throughout if you’re looking for a really wow souvenir. We got an excellent deal on a teapot and 6 cups plus information on what the lettering on it meant.
Plenty of street food is available so you won’t starve."

Being a Country boy from down South, normally doesnt like these types of places... BUT what an amazing array of sights. From shops selling sea slugs and sea cumcumber and dried squid to the cheapest aftershave and perfume, dont miss out on taking your soul to Chinatown. have lunch with the real Chinese in the side street of the mall. Wonderful food. Try the bamboo juice. Great on a hot day. Cools you down and makes you feel refreshed."

,,If you want souvenirs,4.0,,"I had to enter China town as I had some work there and landed up enjoying it. After my work was done, I strolled around the place. There are heaps of shops packed tightly in all the alleys, selling tons of stuff that could be souvenirs. There are many food shops as well in the mix. Those are the ones we targeted and we weren't disappointed. Good way to spend a couple of hours."
,,Cheap shopping,5.0,,Had fun shopping some souvenir items in this place in their street market. At night you could choose within a wide range of food in their food street market....
,,All the same,3.0,,"All Chinatowns nearly look the same. The Food Street is good, better value from the Hawkers than the Restaurants. Souvenir shops all sell the same stuff. Some Tailors are there. Furama city centre was okay prices more reasonable. Better at night time more atmosphere."
,,Meh,3.0,,"Visited by myself, while family back at hotel. Probably has a better atmosphere at night but, really, just a large collection of tacky gift and tourist shops and plenty of restaurants."

,,Explore more than the main markets,5.0,,Most people visiting China Town just walk the main tourist markets but with a little more exploring you will find so much more. Even just across New Bridge Rd the are more markets but aimed at the locals. China Town is a must see when visiting Singapore
,,Eat Pray Shop (local food and delights),3.0,,"The main attraction of chinatown in singapore is the food and sightseeing or buying souvenirs. There is only 1 or lanes at temple street that will give you all that. To start with food, you may try the dim sum for breakfast or late lunch at Yum Cha chinatown at Terengganu Street. It is an hidden gem and the queue tends to be long at busy hours. You may also try the chinese ramen at smith street, or just go ahead to the food street for satay,and other local food (this place has a see-through shelter on top).

If you are craft beer lover,go ahead to chinatown complex food center on level 2. Cheaper craft beer can be found there. Google for Chinatown Smith Street craft beer.

If you have kids, you could order cheap whole steamed fish in chinatown food complex on level 2. Famous place where locals go.

For sightseeing, go straight to Buddha Tooth Museum and go all the way to top level to enjoy the mini garden, and you can walk to the indian temple a few blocks from there. Enjoy."

,,Horrible!!!!!,1.0,,"I have not been to Chinatown many years since the 90s. Last night 12 October 2017 night, I brought my wife to Chinatown trying to see some old world charm and some old shops or street food of Singapore which maybe different from the rest of Singapore.

Pros:
NOTHING!

Cons:
1) Tourist Trap (too commercialized)
2) Rows & rows of shops which sells the same things: cheap souvenirs from china lol
3) Food is essentially rubbish: go to the next door complex hawker centre at level 2 for real authentic Singaporean food
4) Missing Singaporean flavor
5) For a minute, I thought this was walking street in Pattaya LOL!!
6) Real boring: only shops
7) this is a street mall like the many malls & shopping centres in Singapore lol

If you are looking for authentic Chinatown or want to see / learn about Chinese culture: skip this horrendous place. Person in charge of tourist promotion board should be fired!"
,,Amazing sights at night,5.0,,Lots of great places to eat. Lots of great souvenir shops and quirky shops here too. Love walking around Chinatown at night with all the bright lights. A must do in Singapore

,,Great spot for a bite to est,4.0,,Plenty of restaurants nearby where you can find reasonably priced food - follow the locals to find the real hidden gems
,,Like everywhere,3.0,,"Chinatown is definetely worth a visit, but honestly if you've seen another Chinatown somewhere else, such as in San Francisco, you've seen them all. Still it may be a nice walk up and down to watch all the same crap in the stores you're not going to buy anyway. Food is good."
,,Night tour,5.0,,"Straight away I will say this is a must do if the Singapore for a few days. The tours consists firstly of a trip to a Chinese medical centre, then to tea at a yum cha restaurant, then shopping, then after that the best tri-shaw bike ride for about 3 kms on a 4 lane main road in between traffic from China town to Clarke Quay, fantastic race at end blocking the lanes before stepping on a bum- boat for a cruise around Marina Bay, absolutely wonderful. Put it on your bucket list. 12 our of 10."
,,"Temples, food and souvineer shopping!",4.0,,"Love the complete vibe of this place...We took a heritage tour here and got to know a lot about the history and culture of this palace...A nice place to shop for souvenirs- shot glasses, magnets, chopsticks, wall hangings etc.Also a must do here is check out the wide range of food that they offer"

It’s not as good as the china town in KL but it’s definitely worth a visit."
,,Good atmosphere,5.0,,"Ate here whilst staying locally to China town, lots of eating places and great atmosphere. Lots to look at and sample in the way of shops"
,,Be carefull of the inside restaurants,4.0,,"The only bad thing we found was one of the restaurants in China town Lies about their food prices out front saying meals are $3 they are to the left of the Chinese pull cart when you walk in at the front of the market and are about 3 or 4 shops in.
You are better finding the cheap out doors type plastic chair food places .There is heaps of cheap Singapore nick knacks at stores all much the same as the next store. The Indian
spiritual meeting place at the end of the Chinese market is well worth a look too"
,,It’s changed a bit in 3 years,2.0,,"We had not been to Chinatown for three years and had always enjoyed wandering around the markets with their stalls and the street sellers with their wares for sale... plus the great mix of food outlets...
This time, the ‘buzz’ of the area was not there... not sure if it was them or me, but there was no ‘vibe’ whatsoever. The stalls were mostly still there, but the operators did not seem happy... perhaps they know something I don’t.
The whole area needs a revamp and was dirty and a bit smelly... it may be at least another three years before we return..."
,,Girls Trip,5.0,,Just as you imagine china town in the movies - vibrant noisy colourful steamy! Lots of bargains and souvenir shows grab some street food for next to nothing. Lots of interesting store to browse
,,Lots of fun,5.0,,"We enjoyed a rainy evening walk in Chinatown, winding among hundreds of interesting stalls of food, groceries, silks, jewelry and clothing. Super place to find gifts at great prices, especially silk decor items, batiks, nice chopsticks, and even tailored clothing if you want. Busy but safe area."
,,Very busy place but lots to see and do,4.0,,Excellent cultural place to visit. Very hot in middle of the day when we went so recommend you go later in day. Don't miss Buddha tooth temple and also the Chinese Heritage Centre. Most stalls very similar. Shops about for better price. Good shopping malls too with good prices.
,,Great Experience Day or Night,5.0,,"We went to Chinatown on our last evening. It was great. Good food, friendly people everywhere- just like the rest of Singapore. We took a walk through the open air market stalls and picked up a few things. Always worth bartering, but prices are quite high."

,,"Chinatown (and Indian town from what I saw) Very good, look for bargains here!",4.0,,"This is where you want to shop for gifts and bargains, not like the expensive city. Don't be afraid to barter and get whatever you wanted half of the asking price."
,,China in another way,5.0,,"This is the tidiest Chinatown of the world, including mainland China itself. But don't think you will miss the Chinese touch... you will find the food, the religion, the language, the culture, the merchandises. I think is the most lively neighborhood in Singapore."
,,Authentic Chinatown,3.0,,"Super buzzy place with a lot of options for food and shopping. Unfortunately the locals are not very friendly, they hospitality is terrible, looks like the tourists are doing them a favour buying things. They treat people from overseas very bad which is not fare."

Enjoy visit Singapore"
,,Bustling Area well worth a visit,4.0,,"We loved wandering through the markets, lots to see, some good buys some expensive for what it is. Colourful area, loved the shutters above on the windows."
,,Authentic and buzzy,5.0,,"An excellent place to visit.....lively, interesting, bargains to be had, good reasonably priced food., massages, suits made to measure etc. Fun just to wander around and see all the decorations. Lanterns, balloons , colourful clothes and knick knacks. A must in Singapore"
,,"Good food, plenty of stalls, great fun",5.0,,"We ate from one of the restaurants on the side of the street, very good, prices about $20 for two, we also tried the stalls in the middle and that was cheaper about $16 for two. Both were excellent."
,,"Definately the cleanest, neatest Chinatown I have ever been to ;-)",4.0,,"I have been to quite some Chinatowns during my travels (however, never to China itself) and I must say I have never seen a Chinatown so neat and clean and well-organized/structured as the one in Singapore. ;-) This Chinatown is lined with beautiful colonial-feel buildings, most of them well-preserved. However, like any Chinatown elsewhere, it's a buzzing city part with nice shops, great street food and interesting people. Average prices in the shops and restaurants. My favorite Chinatown in the world? No, but still definitely worth a visit. Don't miss the beautiful Hindu temple right in the middle of the action."
,,Cultural vibe!,4.0,,"China town makes for a great place for spending 1-2hrs during evening. You can buy some souvenirs, eat local food on china food street, visit the two temples, pick some fresh fruit juices and sweets."
,,Very localized shops with affordable prices,5.0,,"If you wanted one of the cheapest souvenirs, look no where else. This place is a vry touristy place but offers attractive prices on souvenirs. Remember to visit the hawker centre on the second floor behind the buddha relic temple. Cheap and good food!"
,,Kids loved it,5.0,,"A great place to take the kids so they can shop for cheap gifts and toys. The whole place has a wonderful atmosphere especially when the sun goes down and all the markets light up.

I would recommend eating in one of the many restaurants on the mall. The delicious smells of fresh food being cooked, families sitting around sharing meals and chatting make the place so much fun."
,,Sights Sound and Smell,4.0,,"Yes, this is one place where you get all the 3 S. You get Sights, Sounds and Smells...smells of wonderful food. Try to avoid this place on a hot day as the humidity can wears you down easily. Great place for some food hunting too..."
,,One of my favorite places,5.0,,I love this neighborhood. It resembles old China. A variety of foods are offered at very reasonable prices. The best value is to eat from the stands on the street. Shopping is a dream for tourists. Everyone is friendly. Every trip I make to Singapore includes a evening or Saturday in Chinatown.
,,well its china town,4.0,,"China town was good though if you have travelled much there always seems to be a china town or a india area ,Japanese , it was surely worth a look though it did not have me jumping up and down in excitement any more than usual"
,,good place for souvenirs,4.0,,I visited on a Sunday to pick up some gifts for people back home. The area was busy with street food and many small stalls and shops opened for business. Very nice selection of souvenirs with good prices.
,,Atmosphere,5.0,,This is a great place to visit with its range of shops and restaurants. Of course it is Chinatown in Singapore!
,,Definitely an experience.,4.0,,"I'd never been to a Chinatown before, so was definitely an experience. Lots of tourist nicknacks and a the like. Plenty of bargains to be had. Some of the stall holders tend to be a bit pushy, so don't be afraid to say no and walk away. And there are plenty of great food stalls about for the genuine culinary experience, for very cheap too."
,,Great way to spend an afternoon,5.0,,"China Town in any country is always fun and interesting. Lots to look at, smell, eat and buy. Most stalls all sell similar goods but a few different ones tucked into the lane ways. Great for souvenir shopping."

,,Interesting,5.0,,Went there twice today- very busy. Went to the indoor chinatown for dinner- went to one of the stalls for chilli crab which they cooked from fresh- really really good
,,Enjoyable location,4.0,,"This is our second time in Singapore. We enjoyed a day trip to Chinatown on our last visit, so decided to visit again and stay in a local hotel a couple of nights. We love wandering around the busy streets, looking at the shops, eating at our favourite restaurant and browsing the shops. There's a lot of variety, but we don't really do any shopping here... More so we enjoy the atmosphere. 7 Eleven is very expensive... Much cheaper buying from the hawker shops. Alcohol is quite expensive... Buy duty free or find the local supermarket (about a 5-10 minute walk from Chinatown) where it's about half the price of Chinatown and 7 Eleven."
,,Great fun,4.0,,Lots of different markets to visit. Within easy walking access to the Temple of the Tooth as well as the famous food market. Good place to get a cute framed paper cut out of yourselves as a souvenir. Lots of pocket money options for the children and generally a great atmosphere to soak up.
,,Fun and exciting,5.0,,Great fun and a wonderful diversion from the normal shopping experience. The Chinatown visit is well worth your time.
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"Much bigger than Chinatown in Southport lol..let alone Sydney. Had some wonderful food from the Peoples Hawker Centre in New Bridge Road. S$3.60 for sweet n sour pork, stir fried veges and boiled rice. Delicious!"
,,The Place to eat out,5.0,,China town buzzes all night and it is a place where you meet people from all over the world. You get a variety of asian cuisine when you are in china town. I found the place very friendly and a place when i can dine peacefully. I love the place. food is cheap and the atmosphere is nice.
,,Cultural Experience,4.0,,Chinatown is a great way to experience some of the Chinese culture. Mostly lots of shopping and food. Definitely barter prices down here. If you don't like the deal you'll find plenty of other places selling the same stuff. Nice way to spend a little extra time.
,,Chinatown in Singapore,4.0,,its truly nice to walk around in this area where you can find local delicacies and food. Me & wife enjoy walking here.
,,Well worth the visit during your trip to Singapore,4.0,,"I hit this area of the City during a free day I had during a recent business trip. I enjoyed seeing several temples, hawker centers and getting a flavor for this vibrant part of the City. Great food, people teeming from everywhere, lots of locals too as well as hoards of tourists.

You can get there on the MTR or by taxi of course, then plan to walk around and explore. There is a visitor center just by the MTR which will sell tix for other attractions in the City which makes queuing at them much easier. Also, not many ATM's there but one right by the visitor center also.

I did make it over to the famed Maxwell Center for lunch (separate review), it is a block from the Buddha Tooth Temple.

So, I saw 3 temples, the area, explored and shopped some too for cheap trinkets for home, ate at two Hawker centers nearby as well as some other street food. All within a couple of hours. Well worth the time and effort for sure."
,,It worths visiting,5.0,,A different face of the city. You can find anything in the old market with lower prices. It is beautiful and there are variety of diners available.
,,Stopover,4.0,,"Visited during a stopover , really interesting with temples and street market that sells most products from souvenirs to clothing with some great bargains. A lot of eating places , some an incredible cheap price , down as low as $5 ( Singapore) for good meals,.
Not too busy when we went but incredibly hot and humid so drink lots of water."
,,"Ok, but nothing too different to any other ChinaTown",3.0,,Quite busy and the centre for many bus tours. If you have been to any other ChinaTown you wont find anything different here. Try the Arab Street area instead.
,,Foodie heaven,4.0,,"Firstly, Chinatown has changed so much since I first came a decade or 2 ago. Great places to eat and eat and eat. Oh there's several places to shop at varying budget scales but I think Orchard Rd might be better.

What to eat? Don't think for a moment this area is 'Chinese Food Centric'. It's has many other food alternatives including the hugely popular varieties of Japanese and Korean stuff. The Maxwell Food Centre is nearby but this is one place of many to eat good quality food at very cheap prices. Some of these cheap food places have Michelin stars so that's how good they are. The waiting time may be a bit long at the prized locations but how many times can you say you ate at a Michelin star spot for $3 (famous chicken rice).

To quote an Aussie legend 'Molly Meldrum', do yourself a favour and checkout one of the best features of Singapore. It's amazing and clean. Oh, if you're a Tintin fan, check out the Tintin shop. Great items on sale both cheap and expensive."
,,Singapore then Visit China Town its Electric Why you come to Singapore,5.0,,"Do not leave this out especially evening food great the atmosphere the whole area is unmissable take time walk round then sit at the bars people watch have beer relax if you like food you cant go wrong its cheap its great and you wont be disappointment
This is a vibrant multi culture so remember little India as well
its not to be missed you thank me if you go and if you dont you wont know what you missed ."
,,Kitch,3.0,,Lots of cheap merchandise. Many better places in Singapore to see old shop house architecture. But pleasant if you have time to stroll. Don't expect too much.
,,Chinatown is why I want to go back to Singapore,5.0,,Everything from the gold dealers to the foodhalls if you go to Singapore then Chinatown is a must visit even for an hour the foodhalls serve amazing food and the stores are open to make a deal for the hagglers.
,,Chinese Town,4.0,,"Everything you need that has a slightest hint of Chinese culture can be found here. From food/cuisine, to clothes, decor, furnishings, art, fruits. Even the famous barbecued meat slices (bakwa) can be found everywhere. Chinese temple is also located in this area.

Get off at Chinatown MRT and head towards Pagoda Street which has plenty of Chinese restos. Then, explore each adjacent street like Temple St. for small decors, trinkets and paintings.

If you haven't decided what to eat, head for Smith St and you will see different menus as the restos are located next to each other.

Try to spend 2-3 hours in this place to truly appreciate what it has to offer."
,,Definitely worth an explore!,4.0,,"Chinatown is great and definitely worth some time wandering around the many streets filled with stalls selling a variety of items (clothes, fresh fruit, souvenirs).

It has its own MRT station. Take the exit to Smith Street and you're smack bang in the heart of it all. The area is a decent size and can be explore comfortably in a couple of hours. It does get busy, but that just adds to the atmosphere :-)

There are plenty of interesting stores, great restaurants, a temple and the best massage place I have ever been to - G&G TCM massage. They don't have a TripAdvisor review (yet), but you can find them on Google. I did the 30 minute massage and 15 minute cupping for $38 and it was brilliant!

Come back at night and the area is beautifully lit up and has a totally different feel. Well worth visiting!"
,,Crowded,3.0,,"For me this place was too crowded, but I liked the buddhist temple which we visited. You can visit a market and see a lot."
,,Good for Culture and Nightlife,5.0,,"You'll know you're in Chinatown when you're walking on narrow five foot ways (five feet wide walkways) and surrounded by raucous street hawkers, medicinal halls, endless souvenirs, and Chinese architecture. In the evening, head over to Ann Siang Hill and Club Street in Chinatown to check out some of Singapore's hottest restaurants and bars."
,,Cool China town,5.0,,Totally felt like in China. Have to eat at one of the little restaurants in the streets. Very quaint and very Chinese.

,,Nice place,4.0,,Was a nice trip especially for my kids. Local food was plenty. Street stores were interesting. Will visit again
,,Lots of shops,3.0,,"Unless you really need lots of cheap stuff, the do not spend too much time in the shops, the Buddhist Temple is a great visit, and gets you out of the heat. With lots of eating spots, try and find the Noodle Man, he is my favourite"
,,Great Food and Shopping,4.0,,Came here for the afternoon went to the market street and food street and hd a great time. A great place to come to try traditional Singaporean food such as chilli crab and you can get good cheap souvenirs. Shopping here is a lot cheaper than other parts of Singapore with stalls.
,,Cultural shopping and eating,4.0,,"Enjoy a stroll tasting, shopping and touring temples of China's history . Local hand crafts and Hawker stations w/variety of food."
,,Shopping,4.0,,"Lovely place but the people keep trying to drag you in to their shops, promises of beers or sweets if you go in. I just like to mooch"
,,Spend the whole day eating & shopping,5.0,,You have to visit Chinatown if you get to Singapore it's a must. The shopping is cheap & the food choices makes it hard to decide where to eat but it's all cheap & great food
,,Vibrant,5.0,,"Our hotel was very close to Chinatown and we ate supper one evening here. Wonderful food and incredibly cheap. During the day the shops sell a wide range of items - the fridge magnets, bags, scarves, tea sets. I particularly fancied buying some calligraphy brushes. Very atmospheric."

,,"Nice, but not the best in the world",4.0,,General impression is of a Chinatown to Well organised and to modern/not authentic. Shops offer in general toutistics items.
,,Chinatown in Singapore...,4.0,,"A nice effortless stroll can be had here in the evening trying different local dishes, buying usual souvenirs and enjoying the bright colourful lights and funky market smell. Effortless couldn't be more true due to hawkers not hassling you at all unlike some other places in the Far East. Located really easy even for first timers, as the north side is the mrt station and the south side's entrance is just a stone throw from the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple.
Also many family run businesses are still operating here, and a lot of restaurants have strong wifi available, which therefore combine old with new along with other interesting colonial features. On the western part is an outdoor locals theatre portraying the country's past and current affairs. Definitely worth spending an evening here..."
,,Love the culture!,5.0,,"Love this end of town. Awesome restaurants, so many to choose from. All is safe to eat, just a matter of picking what suits your taste. So many markets! They sell traditional items at cheap prices. You can haggle but most prices are fixed. (It's not like Thailand or Bali where you can throw out prices back and forth). At night, this district comes to life. Lanterns and pretty lights are everywhere. Everyone just chills out at a restaurant or bar - great place to people watch and just take in what's happening around you! One of my favourite places in Singapore!"
,,A surprise,4.0,,"The area makes a great walk. There is some wonderful architecture and buildings from the colonial days. Nice bars, some markets and good food outlets."
,,Combining old and new,4.0,,Visited today and it's rows and rows of markets selling mainly the same stuff for those gifts that you need to buy for the friend that would rather you didn't.. Stalls and stalls of food bars and cafes locals eat here so it can't be bad we had some of the best meals served up for us cooked fresh and tasted lovely.. Cheap too.. Its well worth a visit especially if your hungry..
,,Busy and vibrant,5.0,,Such a busy vibrant place Amazing shops to explore packed with all things you'll never need The sights the smells the hustle and bustle You have to experience this amazing place
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,We visited day time and night time to see the lights. Great place to spend a few hours and buy some presents.
,,Fun and authentic.,4.0,,"One of the more interesting ateas of Singapore. Great for shopping and cheap, authentic restaurants. Busy and bustling."
,,Good.,4.0,,Nicest thing was wandering around and being able to enjoy the place as we were not not being continually accosted to buy stuff.
,,Outdoor markety,3.0,,a huge outdoor market full of souvenirs and stalls of all kinds. it can be a nice way to spend an afternoon.
,,China Town Is Full On,3.0,,I would recommend doing this for the experience but you will need a taxi to and from it which are sometimes difficult to get as you have to ring to book but China Town is full of interesting stalls and shops and I would recommend eating out in the actual thorough fare rather than go in a side cafe as the food is quick and you can see it being cooked although you may have to share a bench it's part of the experience. I picked up a nice silk dressing gown here and had a beautiful henna design out on my hand which was the best thing ever - it's just the transport that is eratic!
,,Colourful & Quaint,4.0,,"We arrived via the MRT and if you take the lift up from Chinatown station (rather than the multiple escalators) can get to the top floor `Garden Bridge' which has a good view over the main street and the decorative hanging colourful animal shape lights (not sure if the themes change regularly) then can just walk down the stairway right into the heart of the shops.
The brightly coloured old style wooden buildings looked great and the hawker stalls had plenty of variety and were well priced (bought most our gifts/souvenirs here).
From the food court area we had a very enjoyable Thai meal for lunch at `Mooks Thai Express' with refreshing icy mocktails.
We came back to Chinatown at night as when we'd passed it while travelling in taxis we'd seen the fantastic looking hanging lights and colourful animal tree, but that night no lights were on. We asked a local why the lights were not lit and he explained they only turn them on at full-moon time and a few days before. Definitely worth going at night to check out the fabulous colourful lights around full moon time if you happen to be around."
,,Very busy,4.0,,I would regard Chinatown as more of woman shopping place but we'll worth a visit if only for an hour or so.
,,Bustling,5.0,,We visited here a few times during the week. So much to see quite busy in the evenings. Plenty of bars and restaurants and lots of shops.
,,A Fun Chinatown,4.0,,"We wandered around following lunch, in search of a grocery store in which to buy the special jarred sauces etc. you can't get easily back home, and we found a lot of kinck-knack shops, but really had to search to find a good grocery. I'm sure we were just in the more tourist-oriented part of the area. In any event, it's a somewhat jumbled neighborhood, with a string of cool bars and restaurants on Club St and Amoy St, and then lines of traders stalls on Sago St (marked Chinatown Street Market on Maps)."
,,We loved it,5.0,,"The hawker stalls were great! Tons of good food options, also lots of hidden gems. The streets come alive at night!!"
,,Less impressive than many other similar areas in SE Asia,3.0,,"This part of town has some buildings that are a bit older than the rest of SP which is almost relentlessly modern. There are some interesting Chinese styled buildings some of which are now hotels. However compared with Chinatown in many other SE Asian countries there is not a great deal to see and the whole place feels a bit sterile and without real atmosphere. Even the usual smells are missing but this is SP after all! We ate at a small chicken, rice/noodle shop and the staff were suitably grumpy and abrupt. Apart from that didn't find much of great interest"
,,always a must,5.0,,for the ambiance for the street food for the market for the street art Chinatown remind the same full of and exciting even if it is so commercial
,,Be very very careful when buying electronics,4.0,,"We were seriously conned out of some serious money by mr lim at E-Lifestyle Connect an electronucs shop selling cameras phones etc. He sold ua goods at triple their value, we have to accept the blame for being sucked in; but then also the goods are also faulty. DO NOT ENTER HIS SHOP"
,,Little China,4.0,,"Every major city has its own little China Town. This is no exception and you get everything here that you would expect in a China Town. Plenty of stores and market stalls selling everything China and Asian gifts wise, don't forget to haggle on the prices. It is only seconds alway from China town exit on the underground MTR. There is a large food court with all Asian foods as well as some western foodstuffs. It's open until late evening."
,,A poor mans Bangkok or Kuta,3.0,,"Sorry but its just OK and no real authentic feel to the place. Worth a look but only rates in the bottom of a list of Chinatowns around the world. A must do is the night time trishaw ride and boat cruise which are unique and not as manic as in Thailand but still a buzz, zipping through traffic with flashing trishaw lights and music booming from ghetto blasters."
,,"Take a step into authentic, traditional shopping with Singapore's Chinatown",4.0,,"With hanging lamps across the roads, lots of tiny little shopping spots and hidden dim-sum restaurants it's a great afternoon spent exploring the old and new."
,,Super Chinatown!,5.0,,"We loved it here ! A vibrant market full of goods and sights and sounds brilliant.
Good food market for a meal very reasonable price - lots of choice of different food. Restaurants here were also good as they are air conditioned and it is so hot."
,,Presents?!?,5.0,,Loads of different little markets and shops to buy all your souvenirs and small presents for friends and family members.
,,bargains bargains bargains,5.0,,Great variety of shopping and great prices. When in Singapore this is where you go for your souvineer shopping and nick nacks for yourself. And bought a lovely tea set from here too. Inside and outside shops - well set out.
,,Must see,3.0,,"Took a walk to China Town from our hotel, great place to go to get some authentic food without paying silly prices. It has the usual tourist tat but some nice stores also bit of a mixed bag really"
,,Disneyland at its worst,3.0,,"So many shops, selling cheap Chinese stuff, that you do not even see the houses, which have been repainted in psychedelic colors. Chinatown Heritage Museum only highlight in this monstruosity, not to be missed."
,,Shopping!!!,4.0,,"If you're looking for souvenirs, this is definitely the place to go. We have a big family and managed to get something for everyone here. We found pashmina's for $5 - bargain!!! There are so many little stores. Got the most comfiest couple of pair of stone washed harem pants, I wish I'd bought more. Only a few store owners urge you to come into their shop for a bargain, mostly the products sell themselves. Had a lovely lunch at Chinatown Seafood which caters for non seafood eaters as well. Dress cool and comfortable."
,,Crowded attraction,4.0,,"This is one real crowded tourist attraction but filled with a lot of Asian food and Chinese good. If you hate human crowd, this is not a place for you. You too can buy souvenirs around here, but make sure you know how to BARGAIN."
,,Small but perfectly formed,4.0,,The area is smaller than other China towns in cities such as Bangkok but was very good. The Maxwell hawker centre is nearby and there is also a street dedicated to food which really comes alive at night
,,Worth Exploring!,5.0,,"This is a cool area of Singapore. Amazing restaurants (especially Chinese Oriental - its all red). A bit of shopping, cool photos and experience."
,,Favourite place,5.0,,"This was my favourite place in Singapore, love the culture that is still alive as Singapore is so westernised.The food and markets are great."
,,One heck of a shopping location,4.0,,"We stopped here while on a tour of the city. They have a huge area for tourist as well as locals, where you'll see everything from a Buddhist temple to a laundromat. Prices are negotiable and sales are mostly in Singapore dollars."
,,Seen one seen them all but it's got lots of cheap souvenirs and huge hawker stall market,5.0,,"Went here specifically to buy souvenirs and Chinatowns never seem to disappoint me. Fun to walk around, grab a beer and people watch! Their Hawker stall area actually has the only Michelin starred hawker stall! It's called Hong Kong Soy Sauce Chicken and is worth the wait in line! $2.50 for chicken and noodles or chicken and rice."
,,Vegetarian Haven at Chinatown Singapore,5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is a beautiful and colourful place for walking and discovering the hidden gems like tea shop, pastry shop, and gift shop, street eat … I enjoying scrolling here and enjoy the vibrant vibe.

If you are a veg*n tourist, you will be very happy coming here. In Chinatown and within close vicinity, you can easily find at least 12 vegetarian establishments, from hawker stall to small eatery to restaurant, offering a diverse spread of vegetarian cuisine. You can even find organic vegetarian eatery at Chinatown Food Street.

Here is another vegetarian haven to indulge in good and scrumptious vegetable cuisine. If you are a lacto-Ovo-Vegetarian and doesn’t mind vegetarian options from non-friendly, you’ve even more choices!"
,,Tropical fruits,3.0,,"It's interesting with tropical fruits but I can't stand the wet market smell. There are so many outdoor Hawker stands with good and fresh juice. I went there to take a cooking class from Food Playground, which was spook worth my visit but I could skip the china town..."
,,Authentic Experience,4.0,,"Walking through chinatown is walking through a large market full of Chinese exports, so you can get a wide variety of items there. Its nice for a quick visit and a stroll through. There is also a fish and grocery market and some great restaurants very decently priced for seafood."
,,It's always worth a visit,5.0,,"We came back to Chinatown for an afternoon wander and browse, it never changes much but it's fun dodging the guys asking to fit you for a suit and haggling for some souvenirs!
We find some of the restaurants are a bit hit and miss, don't bother with those that can't be bothered to offer decent service.
We enjoy reading the plaques that explain the history of the streets, we intended to visit the heritage centre but ran out of time, maybe next year!"
,,china town,4.0,,"good place to shop for all small knicknacks like goodluck tassles, bags, ethnic showpieces , but most of the small shops accept cash ."
,,Overrated,3.0,,"This is very overrated place. This is not very impressive. Other than bars restaurants and a Buddha temple there is nothing to see.

The good things is to see diversity and tolerance at this place. You can see Buddhist temple, Hindu temple and mosque with in less Than 100 m away from each other."
,,Been to one you been to all..,3.0,,"Nice and clean to most China towns i have been , but that's due to Singapore's Tuff laws, Some nice food stalls around and some nice places to look at."
,,Quick visit,4.0,,Came to Chinatown on my last day in Singapore and I was not disappointed! The markets are very good for tourists and there is a lot to see.
,,A lot in one place.,5.0,,"A lot you can visit here such as Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, Sri Mariamman Temple, Jamae Mosque, Chinatown Complex, Chinatown Heritage ctre and much more.

Via MRT, stop at Chinatown. Don't be afraid to walk around and explore the place. A lot of booths selling items at cheap price. You can even visit Tintin's merchandise shop somewhere in here.
A lot of restaurants and bars. Halal options are available, you just have to look around a bit. Old Chang Kee is halal, note that the cheese is a bit sour (than KFC's cheezy wedges)."
,,Disappointed,3.0,,I was really disappointed as it was more like a $2 shop street than anything much worth looking at. The food street looked impressive and the juices were really good. Way too many people and way too much rubbish to purchase.
,,Great spot to wander around,5.0,,"Good food & interesting location. We like Chinatown Seafood for dinner & beer & cocktails. The Buddha Tooth Temple is nearby, as is the Smith Street Taps craft beer bar (shop 62 in the shopping centre on Smith St)"
,,Where to look 1st In Singapore's Chinatown.,5.0,,"Today we visited Singapore's Chinatown precinct for the 2nd time in a month , having previously exploring same on our way to Europe in early August
There is any type of Asian and local food restaurant ones tastebuds desire , we personally enjoyed the chilli crab , washed down by glasses of icy Cold fruit juice and local beers
After getting lost several times in the hundreds of stalls and taking in the sights of every type of wares one could imagine, we then made our way to the Chinatown train station beside the markets.
What an experience , bought some great and unusual goods , all happy with their purchases, food and drinks , also great to see much of the original architecture some dating back over 100 years.
If you have the time , make an effort to visit Chinatown."
,,Good Place for shopping.,4.0,,This is an excellent place to do some shopping. You can find a lot of interesting things to buy at a reasonable price. There are many hawker centers where you can try the local cuisine. When I visited I was in a hurry so I didn't have time to do much shopping or eating.I visited the temple of the tooth relic which is a must see if you come here.
,,Nice walk through Chinatown,4.0,,"There are lots of fun tourist shops, restaurants, a Buddhist temple, and of course a large fresh food, clothing and food hawker market. I had high expectations for the food hawkers thanks to Anthony Bourdain. I tried the obligatory Chicken Rice. I guess you have to try it when in Singapore, but to me it was nothing to write home about. The smell of fish and Durian is abundant, and if you haven't tried it... well, you must do that you can decide for yourself whether or not it is the king of fruits. If you're nervous about it, you can always try Durian ice cream for $1. Enjoy!"
,,A lot of cheap things to get from the shops here!,5.0,,Worth a visit to get some cheap souvenirs to bring back home! You can go around and visit some temples and buy ice cream from the vendor just outside the Buddha temple and near the tourist info centre. There is an interactive screen where you can get advice about getting around the Chinatown!
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"Good souvenir shopping and good selection of Chinese and local food. The hawker style selection is great too! Plenty of shops to visit. Lots of made in China stuff. Good both in the evening and day. Easy to get to by MRT, Chinatown stop."

,,A real Chine in Singapore,4.0,,"You feel that in no time you became in chine. Chinese food, restaurants, shops & even Chinese people 😄"
,,Disappointed.,3.0,,The temples were open and worth a long visit. However China Town appeared more Indian even though te decoration was Chinese. Lovely fresh juice and colourful buildings but no feeling of China.
,,Colorful and Vibrant,5.0,,"Hidden gem in Singapore, lot of things to see and eat. Historic buildings to take photo with.Money changer almost every corner of people park. easy accessible by train or bus. Chinatown MRT station to be exact of."
,,Singapore as it was,5.0,,"An amazing wander round Chinatown - from the street markets selling everything but the kitchen sink (then again I'd bet if you looked hard enough some would sell you one) to the museums and shops.

Just spending time with a coffee or tea watching the world go by, catching the feel of an older era here in Singapore is memorable

Yue Hwa Chinese Products store is a must, selling everything from cosmetics to the most unusual Chinese souvenirs I've found anywhere in Singapore"
,,Shopping heaven,4.0,,so much to list to see and buy and really cheap prices. Grab a sidewalk meal for $A3 and enjoy the vibe. Goes on and on through the streets and so much to see .
,,back to another time,5.0,,I enjoyed this- the hustle and bustle of people going about their everyday lives is on view. The food court place is wild and bewildering- wish I had 3 stomachs to try it all.
,,China town,5.0,,Wow awesome experience great eateries awesome shopping and fantastic temples to visit. They love to haggle with price if your that way inclined. Easy access to the transport system too
,,Did you find the real Chinatown?,5.0,,"We caught a taxi costing $6 from Orchard Road but there is an MRT which would have been cheaper to Chinatown. All we found was a rectangle of streets full of shops, restaurants, a large undercover market, the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and glimpses through locked gates of what I remember as Tiger Balm Gardens. Everything polished and presented for the tourist dollar. Not for the purist but hey we were tourists so we shopped, ate, paid homage to the Buddha and had a great time carrying away our bargains and wonderful memories. One regret was we did not have the energy to visit the undercover market or the museum."
,,Chinatown,3.0,,"Very small Chinatown but looks cute and has a lot of meal options. Bring cash, my experience was no stall took card payments. Not particularly anything special."
,,A must visit in Singapore,4.0,,"Amazing place with a mix of attractions such as aThe Pagoda, Buddhist temple, shopping and food. You could easily spend a couple of days in Cinatown and the choice of authentic Chinese food is amazing. If you are looking for made to measure clothes such as shirts or suits this is the place to go but remember and barter."
,,Heritage walk,4.0,,"Chinatown is heritage area, where one can find chinese culture everywhere. good area for street shopping. there is one china heritage center which is must visit place if you wish to know more about Chinese culture."
,,One of the hidden treasures in Singapore,5.0,,"If you have the time to shop on your trip, do not pass up going here. The area is full of small shops and restaurants that provides a wide variety of choices for all. You can barter over prices with the merchants and there are treasures to find. Do not miss visiting the Chinese temple while there as well. Breathtaking architecture to enjoy!"
,,"Nice to see, just please don't compare it Hong Kong...",3.0,,"A great historic neighborhood in Singapore, or what's left of it, with its gift shops, food stalls, markets, temples, museums... It's all there, nice and organized, too organized... It doesn't have that in-your-face vibrancy and chaos of Chinatown's from around the world. But go, visit it at least once, and make your own opinion...

I went because I really wanted to visit the Chinese Heritage Centre, which is amazing interactive museum, and the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum, which is also a must-see when in the area."
,,Must visit ethnic enclave,3.0,,"Chinatown has been around for a Long time. In the past it was grimy, noisy and crammed . Now it's been spruced up with requisite tourist shops and restaurants. The old market is still there which I do recommend visiting."
,,"Great place this visit, amazing food & shopping!",4.0,,"Everyone loves Chinatown, rich in culture. Crowded streets from lunchtime on. Selection of cheap street food. Shopping is good. Money changers everywhere. Plenty of Shopping malls surrounding the area. MTR right in Chinatown, Taxis are cheap & convenient. Real hustle & bustle"

,,China Town - great food,5.0,,Of course you'll go to China Town when in Singapore and so you should if you like food. Way cheaper and better food than the hawker stalls we went to.
,,street food,3.0,,"I visited chinatown in night and a lot of place close but i don't know what time the store close daily, I try a lot of street food there. I love the food and the place was so good, we can find a lot of food in one place but a little crowded there but nice place to go"
,,Hustle and bustle of Chinatown,5.0,,Visited Chinatown twice and love it. Great place to wander around and buy presents to take home. Good food can be found and cheaper beer. Found the locals to be honest and helpful.
,,A place rich in culture,4.0,,"During my visit to Singapore, Chinatown was one of the places I visited and admired. People are very kind, The food is amazing, and the street market is one of the things you don't really wanna miss.

For those who looks for a place that is rich in culture, Chinatown is one of them."
,,Little Hong Kong,4.0,,"Came here for the first time with the family and loved it. It looks a bit like Temple st/Lady market in Hong Kong with good food from chicken rice, roasted duck to seafood to desserts and dumplings. It has a lively atmosphere but not overcrowded."
,,Variety of great food and Chinese goods,4.0,,"This sanitized Chinatown which removed dilapidated buildings and the more bizarre aspects of Sago Lane and wildlife slaughtering is still fascinating as traditional foodstuffs (dried goods, herbs), crockery, antiques, trinkets, artifacts are still displayed and available while the old coolie quarters and cramped households are preserved in a small museum on one of the series of parallel streets near Sri Maramanian Temple.
Good old Cantonese food together with modern fusion, Thai, vegetarian and 'tzi char' (stir-fries)can be found in the Kreta Ayer area even if you don't venture to Hong Lima Food Centre behind Chinatown Point where famous stalls like the curry chicken mee attract long lunchtime queues.
Across the road, People's Park is a perennial draw with yet another hawker centre and its famous desserts and roast meat dishes while Yue Hwa Department Store sells clothing, luggage, bedsheets and embroidered linen, foodstuffs from China.
And if you want modern luxury, there's the Park Royal Pickering and it's beautiful greenery while you indulge in a buffet at Lime, it's signature restaurant!"
,,Immerse yourself,5.0,,"Went here twice on a four-night stopover Great place, great atmosphere and great food Just take your pick, order and find a table Wonderful experience"
,,Singaporean Pawn Shops.,5.0,,Who would of thought. I love these brass statues from Asia as my home is almost a museum. Trouble is they are so expensive. Then i found the pawnshops. WooHoo!!!!
,,A must visit,4.0,,Great little shops with some real bargains to be had. Wasn't like other China towns I have to been too around the world but you should still visit
,,"Typical Chinatown - markets, food stalls, clothing and souvenirs - but still worth the visit",4.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is worth a few hours of your time. It's rather large and most of it is sheltered from the hot afternoon sun. If you're a foodie, its most definitely worth the trip just to try all of the snack foods from the stalls. We chowed down on fried mushrooms (which were delicious) and then indulged in some sweets. We didn't buy anything else from the stalls as most of it was clothing and souvenirs - not something we typically buy on our travels. The streets of Chinatown are very clean and, as is typical of all of Singapore, well maintained and pretty. While in Chinatown I would suggest fitting in an extra 30 minutes to an hour and visit the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. Very serene and beautiful architecture."
,,Ambient,5.0,,Loved the feel of vibrancy and culture in this fantastic area of Singapore. Many shops and hustle and bustle or relax in the many bars around and people watch. Loved the feel of it and spent most nights of our stay here. My husband noted the beer was cheaper in this area which could of been the reason we went as much ad we did haha.. We found the chicken and peanut in a satay sauce amazing here too.

,,Good for shopping,4.0,,Nice place to shop for yourself or to take gifts home for friends.Need to go around checking prices - same items are labelled different prices at diferent stores. Very affordable prices - wide range if items .
,,Nice day out.,4.0,,"China town is a great place to spend an afternoon. There is a market selling souvenirs and electronics. Bars selling coffee and beer and some great little places to eat.
Beware of prices and little tricks to get you to part with your cash though. ;-)"
,,Like being in China in every way!,5.0,,Simply put..A must for all visitors to Singapore. The sights..the food..the noise...the smells....At night it is best and the food is rather cheap but delicious on the side streets. Everything is accessible through the MRT (Underground).

,,"Busy, Touristy yet Interesting",4.0,,"Not surprisingly there are, many tourist shops selling souvenirs. However, the atmosphere is good, with many food options available. It was great to be able to dine outside and take in the atmosphere. Restored Shop houses create a great atmosphere and are a complete opposite to the many high rises that populate the island."
,,Souvenir Place,5.0,,"If you are looking for stuff to give away to your friends when you get home then you found it! You get souvenirs from
Wholesale or retail prices which is very very cheap compared to buying a Starbucks mug with a country name on it. You can find absolutely anything here.

Eateries abound the street and this place is right at the metro station. So easy to reach and spend time merrily in Singapore. At the far end of the street is the beautiful Mariamman temple .
Thoroughly entertaining walk for all types of people, youn and old."

Nothing amazing that stood out but a must do when in Singapore. Best was the Food Court street lots of variety and good deals. However had a much better meal on North Bridge Road about 5min walk.
,,One of the prime highlights of Singapore!,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, Chinatown is one of the to must see neighborhoods in the city. A good selection of restaurants, retail stores and gift shops, and a variety of other stores offering different products and merchandise at very reasonable prices is offered. The are some attractions in the nearby areas such as temples,singapore visitors center and religious buildings with and enormous amount of history. People watching is a great pastime while eating or just walking around. Photos opportunities are in abundance in every block. There are other opportunities immediately surrounding the area for sightseeing and exploring. The people are very friendly and welcoming so you will feel very comfortable and at home. We experienced it during the day, but at night might be a little more colorful!"

With Chinatown SMRT Station nearby, you can walk and explore this area by foot once you out from the station. A perfect place if you not yet buy any souvenirs since most of the shops still open even at 10pm."
,,Unique Chinatown,5.0,,"Loved China Town, was within walking distance from our hotel, it really is a genuine market area with many shops and stalls selling a wide variety of goods. Great atmosphere, friendly bargaining. Good spot to pick up a souvenir or gifts to take home without breaking the bank. Also good coffee at S$2.50 a cup!"
,,Put it on your list of places to visit,4.0,,Yes a bit touristy and food a little more expensive but when you can eat great food for well under $10 it isn't really a problem. The history around this area is fascinating and it is well worth while to get onto one of free walking tours
,,China at your Doorstep,4.0,,"What you can get in China you will be able to find it all here. It turns vibrant especially at night. Exotic food like frogs legs, famous porridge and noodles are all tucked in the corner. Leave alone you can find souveniors like fridge magnets, chimes, tarditional clthings all to your liking."

If you want to try Century Eggs this is the place to get them.
,,As all Chinatowns are,5.0,,Great restaurants... Singapore though where ever you go is extremely expensive. But I must say the food we ate was great and if I was back there again I would go to the same place.
,,Cleanest Chinatown,4.0,,"Been to all the north American Chinatowns, initial impression this struck as clean. Lot of food and shopping options. Expensive seafood places. Awesome Buddha temple. Tons of knick-knack vendors, much less bargaining compared to the other chinatowns."

,,Hawkers food experience well worth doing,5.0,,"We saw Chinatown as part of a tour in the daytime but returned at night when the hawker food stalls were in full swing. There's a huge range of food on offer, classic Chinese cuisine. Shared seating areas add to the fun and it won't cost you very much at all. Take a walk around the streets and enjoy the old architecture. If you like lots of noise and atmosphere this is the place to go."
,,"A ""must see"" for visitors to Singapore! Easily accessible by MRT (underground train)- Chinatown station",5.0,,"Singapore is a modern and sophisticated city, which offers something for nearly everyone.

And, while Singapore has some of the most modern skyscrapers, sophisticated hotels and restaurants catering for sybarites, it still offers the visitor attractions like Chinatown- a bustling commercial area attracting both tourists and locals.

It has a genuine ""Chinatown"" ambience, making it a good place to visit to bargain hunt, as well a dine on tasty food at a modest cost.

Well worth a visit, especially when it is so easily accessible."
,,It's cheap,5.0,,If your looking for cheap souvenir items this is the best place to buy. You can buy 7 keychain for S$10 or shirt 4 for $10 or shopping bag 3 for $10. And if you feel hungry there's lot of restaurant but it's all Chinese. I try the food it taste good and cheap. The downside on this place it's very crowded any day specially on afternoon like no place to walk.
,,Shopping,3.0,,"Big tourist spot - sellers grab on to you to get you to buy something, bargaining and almost to the point of making you run away!"
,,Bit disappointing,3.0,,Some interesting points like the temple but largely a lot of shops selling the same tourist stuff and restaurants. Always worth a visit but a couple of hours is probably enough!
,,Cleanest Chinatown on earth,4.0,,"I cannot understand how people can say that this is just another Chinatown similar to the others: I've been visiting the Chinatown in San Francisco and Bangkok and I found them completely different from the one in Singapore. First of all, this is the cleanest, second the little houses - that are perfectly restored - are unique and third the chinese buddist and hindu temples are a must-see. Of course the bustling streets are lined with old shophouses, with colours and smells that are typical chinese."
,,Cleanest Chinatown,5.0,,"This is probably the cleanest Chinatown of the world! You can find anything here, but what I suggest to buy are typical Chinese objects and souvenirs."
,,Quite a lively and colorful place,4.0,,"The Chinatown in Singapore is just like the others, but you may come across that one special shop, or a very helpful shop owner, who will make the visit worth your while. We were in lucky in that aspect, as we came across this delightful shop of Chinese collectibles, run by a feng shui expert. He took his time to explain various feng shui cures to us, gently suggesting (but not imposing) what we could buy. Whether you believe in that stuff or not, those cute little items do serve as cool decor pieces, or even gifts.

Just outside his shop, you'll find a lady selling lovely stuff like jade jewelry and bookmarks with Chinese calligraphy. We went to Chinatown twice during our three day trip, once during the day and once at night. Both times we found the place to be equally bustling, with people shopping, eating, drinking, and generally making merry. It's a place where you see a lot more liveliness than most other places in town."
,,Foodies will love it,5.0,,If you are looking for affordable meals then Chinatown is for you. Super Clean and safe this place is great to visit for a cheap bowl of noodles or its famous Crab
,,Best part in Singapore away from the Bling Bling Malls,4.0,,"Spent several hours in China town walking leisurely busy place even at 9.30 am local time not everything is opened but around 10.00am the place is buzzing with activities and stall are full of merchandise what ever you might fancy buying, from cheap tourist baubles to expansive antiques.Plenty of food to eat and food st and food courts ,put your walking shoes and hat today was 33 Celsius 20 August 2017.Highly recoommend it lots old parts and temples ."
,,Walk through China town,2.0,,"Didn't find it any different to China towns elsewhere in the world. Cheap souvenirs on sale. Dirty streets, rubbish piles with people pressing you to purchase goods or eat in their restaurants. If you enjoy this kind of atmosphere go but I wouldn't go again."
,,So-so at best,3.0,,Was a bit disappointed with the overall thing.. feel more like a tourist trap than anything else.. even the restaurants there are filled with tourists (not like in bangkok for instance where it is nicely mixed up).
,,Like any other China Town,3.0,,"This place is like any other city China Town, however, point to be noted that it is a place to shop for cheap when in Singapore. It is a nice place to check on Chinese medicine and Chinese tea."
,,least impressive China Town ever,1.0,,I have been to China Towns almost all over the world but this was the least impressive as it is a small street of just knick knacks and nothing special. Especially if you don't have extra time to kill and if it is super hot and humid out definitely not worth the walk.
,,One of our favourite parts of Singapore!,5.0,,"During our most recent visit to Singapore, we stayed at a hotel located in the heart of Chinatown. This gave us easy access to one of our favourite parts of Singapore ie. Chinatown itself.
We spent a good amount of time exploring the Chinatown market and we also had the opportunity to take a close look at the shops, cafes, restaurants and traditional Chinese buildings in the surrounding streets.
Chinatown is certainly one of the most lively and colourful locations in Singapore and is a ""must visit"" area for any visitor to Singapore."
,,Clean,5.0,,"Since singapore is the cleanest city in the world, the chinatown of singapore is the cleanest too. I usually dont spend a lot of time in chinatowns of other countries because it is not the mainstream culture. However, in singapore, there are many chinese-singaporean people. So here you can learn and experience the core culture of singapore."
,,Buzzing place,4.0,,We stayed at Amaara hotel in China town. It is a business centre and we didn't really see much over there honestly.
,,Place to get curious,5.0,,"Like most of China town in the world, but the different is you can find Hindu's temple , mosque and Buddhist temple here.

If you like TinTin comics character, they have a sort of small museum or store which usually very hard to find elsewhere.

A very good place to buy Singapore souvenirs with very cheap price (quality is same like the one sold in airport or dept stores, only 1/4 or 1/3 of the price!).
Complete brands of Ba Kua ( Singapore meat jerky), so you can complete all your souvenir shopping here.
Enjoying quite different architecture, from china oldies building to European replica."
,,A piece of history,5.0,,"This Chinatown is quite big considering the size of this island state.
You will see most of the old buildings that has been preserves and still in use for shops and restaurants. Like most Chinatown in the western countries, you can also find inexpensive arrays of souvenirs, from key chains to antique Chinese chest drawers. There are two areas of Chinatown, the touristy bit and more of the local bit. In the local bit of it, you will find the Michelin starred food hawker, at People's park food court.
On the touristy bit, there's an old but well maintained Buddhist temple, the Tooth Relic temple and museum. You want to visit it, even for the architectural side of it, if nothing else.
On Buddhist holiday, the temple is decked out and filled with the worshipers and tourist alike. Also, there's Tintin museum to visit. It's a small establishment with this famous comic's memorabilia. Or have yourselves a tailored shirt or the full suit while you visit.
The ambiance is festive with lampions hanging overhead from old preserved buildings along the Pagoda St. Try to look beyond the souvenirs and the restaurants, you'll see the richness of the Chinese culture and how it contributes to the whole multi cultural aspect of Singapore."
,,The place to get many little gifts in bundles and food of course,4.0,,"China town has many shops that surely has something you can pick up for the many friends and colleagues you have back at home. Even the locals buy the costume jewellery, pouches, cushion covers, table runners, hand fans etc
It has lots of interesting eats too. Some local cookies, biscuits shop, dessert shop, dim sum restaurants and some food stalls of local delights. Quite a few lanes are just for pedestrians, no cars allowed and I like that.
Before Chinese New Year ( late Jan early Feb) and during Mooncake Festival the place is lighted up at night and it is so pretty for taking photos.
Go visit ..... all my friends from overseas liked it . I hope you like it too."
,,You can get anything you want....,5.0,,"Was here on a rainy morning, so browsed all kinds of joints. Bought some face masks, calligraphy painting with my name. There's jewelry, jade but also complete electrical stuff for the house here, all interspersed with noodle shops, tea houses, etc. Really good."
,,Always crowded,4.0,,We walked here the first day when we arrived in Singapore. It is always crowded and always nice to walk around and fine some cool souvenirs. Hindu and budhist temple around the corner.
,,Super crowded,5.0,,"Busy area. Seems like everybody's going to chinatown. Easy to find souvenirs, snacks, chocolates, with very reasonable price. Good thing is : direct access to Chinatown MRT."
,,"Forget Orchard Road, go to Chinatown instead",5.0,,"We were positively surprised: First, this Chinatown has a lot more to offer than the ""usual"" Chinatown (compared to New York, London, ...). Second, some shops have surprisingly high-quality items (if you ignore the low-quality shops). Third, we were positively surprised by a high-quality meal (at Yucun kitchen) after being a bit disappointed with the much-touted but in fact mediocre hawker/food court cuisine in other parts of the city."
,,Loved it!,4.0,,"China Town made Singapore for me. I loved the atmosphere, the bright colours, the older buildings, the restaurants and even the tat souvenir shops! It makes the rest of the city seem bland."
,,Noisy and fun,5.0,,"Don't just come here to eat (although that's a pretty good excuse). This is a fun place just to walk around and soak up the atmosphere. You can get a suit made in a day if that's your thing, by endless quantities of junk or get the latest iPhone or computer."
,,Festive experience,5.0,,"China Town has many different sites to enjoy. Street decoratively decorated with lots of stores selling this and that....bargain away. Many hawker and food markets where the brave can buy food. Some great feasts to be had at relatively cheap prices. Look out for the stalls thst have won awards for their food, these are normally the best, although we had the best tasting rice dish from a store tucked on the side at one of these markets. Walk in and take a slow stroll around before choosing."
,,Place to visit while in Singapore,4.0,,"One of the places to visit in Singapore, No major attraction to see though. Food seems expensive in this aria."
,,Ok.,5.0,,To touristy and exspensive for us so ventured across road into where locals ate Bought 15 dollar whole duck and ordered some bok choy sat down devoured.. had beer in local food hall..enjoyable .
,,Chinatown,5.0,,Really nice Chinatown. Not as large as Chinatown in Yokohama but great shopping and dining and sightseeing. Go see the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple.
,,Good but Like any other market,4.0,,"Singapore is all about the shopping and in my book markets are part of the deal. There is a good array of clothing,souvenirs, shoes, jewellery and food. We bought t-shirts, bargain priced name branded shoes ( Birkenstocks, Ecco) and investigated jewellery options. Unlike a lot of markets there was no pressure to purchase. We will be back before we leave."
,,Amazingly Clean and Great Tea Shops,5.0,,We were very impressed with how clean the streets were. We came early (10 am) but many shops and cafes were open. Great ice tea for us Texans. We got some tea and were told hoe and when to drink it.
,,Great food and atmosphere,5.0,,We ate in Chinatown last night and the food was great and cheaper than in the Central Business District. Today we had lunch at the Oxwell & Co bar/restaurant and the food was very good there too.

,,Great Atmosphere !,5.0,,"Excellent place to visit to soak up the atmosphere, do a little shopping and eat some great food..... including Chilli Crab"
,,Pleasantly surprised,4.0,,Singapore chinatown was a great experience. Popular and safe with a good atmosphere. Touristy in parts but also authentic in others. Glad we went. Not hard to find as you know when your getting near.
,,The food Haven,4.0,,This is the place where you get the best of Asian street foods. You also experience the culture and traditions of the people.
,,Sadly not what it once was,3.0,,Sadly it seems Chinatown now is a bunch of cheap trinket stalls. The food can still be good but it has lost its culture and unique quality.
,,Little China,5.0,,We walked there between Chinese shops and snack bars quite long time. We noted that it's possible to find any levels of restaurants and cafes. Even gourmet restaurant Gaig is located there. We finalized our trip in Chinese quarter with cold beer and taste Chinese cuisine
,,Must Visit for Tourists,5.0,,Review by Dr Sim. Must visit for Tourists. Take your time to walk around. Go in the early morning or late evenings. Cooler. Regards Dr Sim

,,Must visit place,5.0,,"Chinatown is a very attractive place to buy cheap stuff, knowing how expensive Singapore is, Chinatown is the place for everything. Best place to buy souvenirs , and decorations. Food in this place is amazing. Food is very cheap and tasty. If you really want to taste food this is the place ..."
,,Like Soho but more Chinese-y,4.0,,its the most Chinese like Chinatown we have ever visited. Well worth a wander around. Some fantastic little gems to be found and you must visit the Hawker Centres. the food is incredible.
,,Great for gift shopping!,4.0,,"We spent a lovely morning wandering through Chinatown buying gifts. Huge choice and pleasant traders, not too pushy but remember to negotiate on prices!"
,,Interesting mix of people,3.0,,"I visit in the evening and is nice with all these lights.
There are a street with small shops on both sides of the street and a lot of stalls and you can buy a lot of suvenirs. Also you can find a lot of terraces with food but we don't eat here.
We visit a local temple and is an experience.
Personally I don't like very much - I thing in Singapore there's are other more beautiful and interesting places to visit."
,,Great community feel at a great price,4.0,,"Finally a place in Singapore which was cheaper than home, plus it had a wonderful community feel. Loved it."
,,I did not rate it Excellent!!!,5.0,,"Note: I clicked in as ""good"" but the screen automatically jumped to ""Excellent"".... I couldn't figure out how to redo and rectify my actual rating....
Anyway, looking at neighbouring countries, I have to say, although many could be done by local or government authority to make Singapore Chinatown even more distinctive, but overall, quite a fair amount of effort has been sank in....notably by decorating the main street according to Chinese festivals and tradition.
For Tourists.... if you really have time, spending 2-5 hours walking around the Chinatown streets is not a bad idea. Although not too many of the old-days Singapore street scene found in the Chinatown, still, you may be able to enjoy seeing some of the old architecture, enjoying local Singapore Chinese Hawker or restaurant food, and do a bit of shopping on averagely priced goods. Evening visit is more recommended."
,,The market area is average,2.0,,The general market area is full of the same old cheap rubbish if you want to go for a stroll its good for a laugh
,,A mix of cultures,5.0,,"walk through the shops and browse at a slow pace or else you will miss something ..... bargains are here depending on what you are looking for,but beware you may come away with something you where not looking for cause it was such a bargain ......"
,,Great Place with a Fantastic Vibe,4.0,,"Chinatown us a great place to base yourself in if you're staying in Singapore. It's just outside the CBD and only a couple of metro stops away from the likes if Supertee Grove and Gardens By the Bay.
The sightseeing hop on hop off bus stops here and there are absolutely loads of nice places to eat and drink. The area has great character and a lovely vibe.
The Budda Tooth Temple is worth seeing and there are a couple of beautiful Chinese and Indian Temples.
Hotels are plentiful here and much cheaper than downtown. All in all a lovely part of Singapore and I'd have no hesitation in staying again next time I'm in the."
,,Plenty of food and shopping stalls,4.0,,Plenty of stalls selling food and souveniers. Enjoyable time just wandering through the streets and taking in the atmosphere.

,,Chinese Shopping ?,4.0,,The place tends to be bit crowded on weekends and is extremely humid during day time.The items are cheap and there are ample of shops to choose from.
,,So much has changed!,2.0,,"Chinatown is the best place to find affordable and delicious food but you got to know which way to go and find your food. Everywhere is just a walking distance. Walk and look around you. There's a morning market in a building and there's a food court on 2nd floor where you may find lots of cheap eats, especially the famous Michelin star chicken rice stall. Look out for dessert shop too. It was a walking distance to Buddha Tooth Relic building. Best time to visit will be in the morning as early as 8am. Shops are open around that time except for eateries. I came back again at night to have a drink but it was quite disappointing as it closed as early as 11pm. I guess it was not as crowded as it used to be. I came here every time I come to Singapore. The crowds are getting less."
,,Interesting place to visit,4.0,,Lots of stalls to look around. Many stalls had similar stuff. A few eating places available. The temple nearby has incredible statues.
,,Cool Experiance,4.0,,Awesome street food alley and really cool atmosphere. Catch the train to Chinatown and cross the main road to find the main strip of food markets. Also heaps of trinket markets. Ate some delicious street food and did some souvenir shopping. Fun night in Singapore.

,,A highlight of Singapore.,4.0,,"It's full of great shops with cheap gifts and things for everyone, we bought gifts to take home for friends as well as a fair few bits for ourselves. All is priced and cheap so unlike some trips in Asia no need to haggle and mess about it's nice and easy.

The food market was one of the best with great dishes at good prices available. Some of the best pork belly i've ever had! great atmosphere and great prices.

A little different when you go to some of the malls out the back it's more of a rustic type feel, still great food on offer and an array of interesting shops.

There were a few ladies of the night around too."
,,one of the best I have seen,4.0,,"Singapore Chinatown is easily accessible via MRT . Go here for the China town food street as it serves some amazing food which is not to hard on the pocket . From exotic sea food to simple paratha's , you will get whatever you want . It has a Buddhist Temple ( Buddha Tooth Relic Temple) and Hindu Temple ( Mariamma Temple ) very close to each other. Both are very beautiful and take your breath away"

,,Another must in SGP,5.0,,Not the best Chinatown to buy stuff but the most clean and organized Chinatown ever. Not so cheap but very affordable.Free Wifi!.
,,The place to shop,5.0,,If you're looking for all types of holiday gifts for children and friends this is the place to go. You're money goes a very long way. Simply travel to Chinatown mrt and ask someone the exit for the market - it is a road beginning with the letter P not the exit for the park.
,,Interesting place,5.0,,I feel like strolling the streets in the year of 1960s. It is so interesting and clean. Best time to visit is around 5 pm when the weather is cooler.
,,A wonderful experience,4.0,,This is a wonderful place. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that many of the shops are run by non Chinese. But still a must place to visit.
,,Great place for street food evening,5.0,,It is a good place for a nice good dinner for a reasonable price. As well as some light shopping where you also have to bargain. One visit is enough while you are in Singapore.

,,China,4.0,,"Chinatown is a good place. It takes around a day to see the area. the shopping is cheap and ideal place for buying stuff for relatives and momentos. The street food is the best part, the chinese cuisine is best at street stalls here."
,,great tourist attraction,5.0,,"great place to walk around, shop and eat. Good value there for all shopping and the food is really good and inexpensive"
,,nice place,5.0,,"I have been in many chinatowns around the world and this one is the cleanest i ve ever been, really nice food and you can buy souvenirs very cheap"
,,Awesome Place for shopping and fooding,4.0,,"Place is known for the shopping and fooding experience. You will get almost all sorts of chinese foods - the croc meat, the frog meat, chicken, beef, fish everything extremely cheap. Go for dinner here. Even hot drinks are available here. Chinese products shopping can also be done here."
,,Authentic!,5.0,,Very lively and friendly atmosphere. There are loads of shops selling souvenirs at reasonable prices when compared with other areas in Singapore. There is a food street where you can sample different types of Chinese food and very cheap as well. The shop keepers were very friendly and nice. Not to be missed!
,,OK,3.0,,"Our hotel is in China town and while I like the area, I've seen better china towns in various parts of the world! restaurants seemed touristy (I guess they have to be) and goods in shops looked just like Bali or Bangkok so someone must work in a sweatshop churning stuff out for markets all over Asia. We ate in a Hawkers centre rather than the food street and really enjoyed the experience."
,,Best Chinatown ever Seen,4.0,,Singapore Chinatown is just awesome. 1)easy to access via MRT 2) amazing chinatown food street for all kinds of food 3) has a beautiful hindu temple and a buddhist temple 4) good for shopping
,,A little of Hong Kong Ladies Street,5.0,,"That was my first impression upon my arrival in the evening at the MRT. Selling a lot of magnets and souvenirs stuff, caligraphy paintings and other knicks knacks. Hawker food galore, one need not fear of starving or thirst. You may also escape to the many air conditioned cafes if the weather gets to you. Get lost in the area (which I did!) and you may be surprised at what you find. In my case, I came upon the Chinese temple and the gorgeous Hindu temple in my adventure and the latter especially was a sight with colourful roof carved with statues of deities. And the best thing about Chinatown compared to Hong Kong, majority of people you meet would be able to converse in English! Less scary when you are travelling solo!"
,,Chinatown not impressed,2.0,,It was dirty and full of small shops with a lot of junk for sale. Didn't eat there so can't comment on the food but I only stayed 15-20 min by I didn't like it
,,Good place to buy souvenirs,4.0,,"A lot of small local stores where you can buy souvenirs. You would mostly find key chains, fridges magnets and similar stuff there. There are also a lot of restaurants in the area, but you can imagine they are pretty touristic."
,,Colourful china town,3.0,,I've been here a few times and enjoy it but it's markets aren't as diverse anymore as they once were... Certainly not keeping up with Vietnam or Hong Kong.
,,Great food and perfect place for souvenirs,5.0,,Chinatown street food is full of local specialties for you to try. Walking along Pagoda street to buy all kinds of souvernirs and small stuffs for presents with cheaper price than many other places. They seem to sell the same things but you can find some very weird stuffs if you look carefully.
,,Full of colour,5.0,,"This is a great little China Town ranging from the traditional to the touristy shops, something for everyone from delicious foods, Chinese medicines to ornaments and fridge magnets. The metro brings you right up in the middle of it, so well worth a visit"
,,No never ever,1.0,,Same place I have visited in Malaysia and same review only a 100x more intensified. Thought to buy some cheap gadgets but alas!! They are even more uninteresting. If u r a Muslim avoid this place as u will hardly find any place to take or eat anything halal. Though at the end of our breathe we have found the only Muslim shop with mutton and chicken but the place was not hygienic. Don't waste ur time to find interesting anything there because u r already fun without this.
,,China Town in me,4.0,,I like roaming around this area. Food here are various and yum. Whenever I'm here I'd love to order a set of BBQ squids or prawns with a can of Tiger beer. You can enjoy the night life like a local.
,,Its hot and it's crowded,2.0,,"Went there an afternoon, it was hot, it was crowded but still worth a visit for a few hours. They sell a lot of souvenirs, its cheap, its plastic but if you take your time you can find some handicraft. The food is a mix between local and tourist food, it's cheaper than in many places.
Happy we went there but no need to go there twice."
,,Nice Locality with distinct Atmosphere,5.0,,Chinatown in Singapore is definitely a touristy place with a distinct atmosphere. Lots of food stalls and small shops selling souvenirs make this place a very vibrant locality in the evenings.
,,Good food and cheap souvenirs,5.0,,Great place to explore the religious buildings on a single street. It was also very easy to find the food complex for local food!
,,Very busy shopping area,4.0,,Great place to pick up a cheap/budget souvenir for your friends/family. There are also lots of general stores and other specialties. Definitely worth a look at!
,,The 50 Cents Fest,2.0,,"Located at Smith Street, varieties of food/drinks were made available at a mere SGD$0.50!! Be willing to wait in long queue. Congested and crowded with limited walking/eating spaces. Its a 2-day event till 30 Jul 17."
,,Best place to get cheaper souvenir,4.0,,The famous Maxwell food center is located at Chinatown. We spent half day exploring and have lunch there. There are lots of souvenir shops where you can buy similar souvenir for a cheaper price than in other scenic spots.
,,My favourite part of Singapore,5.0,,"I followed my instinct and booked a hotel in Chinatown, and never regretted. This is probably the best and most relaxing part of Singapore. There are lot's of small street stalls that sell overpriced souvenirs, and some very useful feng shui items. There are a lot of good small Chinese restaurants, several bars and clubs, and a few worthwhile tourist sites."
,,Quaint .. 😊 Lovely,4.0,,By lanes & more by lanes.. selling interesting fare / souvenirs for your loved ones back home..have to visit for fridge magnets ..specially the 💼 bag hooks .. amazing.. 👍🏼 🎁 gift from Singapore 🇸🇬
,,Cool little place,4.0,,Why is it that china towns in other countries seem more alive and inviting with culture than the real place? Cool little place to get some food and some gifts.
,,Good food and cheap stuff,4.0,,There are loads of restaurants in Chinatown. Both local cuisine and international options. Street food is nice in the area where they allow food stalls. It is the place to buy cheap souvenirs as well. Easy to reach by MRT.

,,Great Chinatown,5.0,,"What a great Chinatown, the people are so nice and helpful. Lots of great shops and food. At night it comes alive with open markets and food vendors."
,,Exactly what I expected Chinatown to be!,5.0,,"I have been to a few chinatowns around the world and I have always had a vision of what they look like.

This takes that vision and pulls you into the 21st century.

Free wifi around the food areas and huge fans in the roof in a bid to keep you cool.

There are lots of shops and places to eat, I would recommend having a walk about for food. It is more expensive in the street that you come out of the LRT station into.

Generally meals are around 5-10 SGD and are of a decent quality!"
,,Basically a tourist trap,2.0,,"Unless you are a local, you will know whats overly exorbitant there. Nasty vendors non-typical of Singaporeans, ,mainly mainland china vendors and over-hyped food. Having said that, there are good food around. Don't waste your time shopping there. Most of the stuff are made-in-china."
,,Fun place to visit - cheap shops!,4.0,,"Chinatown is a great area of Singapore to explore - we find it more fun at night with all the lights on. When you exit the MRT you are straight out into the hussle and bussle of the area. Lots of shops selling souvenirs and cheap clothing - you'll see the same things on sale elsewhere in Singapore sometimes for 10-20x the price they are here. Some good food options as well. Even just stopping for a cold beer and watching the world go by is great fun. Much as we love Little India as well, Chinatown is more compact and we found that the shops here are cheaper than Little India. Less traffic in places too makes it more kid friendly. I've had a few suits made by some of the tailors here too in record time and for amazingly cheap prices. Love it!"
,,Great place to dine and shop,5.0,,"I loved Chinatown. It was clean, felt safe and had a very good atmosphere. The hawker centres looks pretty clean and organised offering food and drink at reasonable prices. The market places offer interesting things for sale. Massage places are an added advantage in this neighborhood."
,,Chinatown - really worth the visit?,3.0,,"Sure - it's an interesting place but doesn't every major city have a Chinatown? I'm not sure if it's worth paid your.
You can simply take the train or bus there and walk through in only minutes. The markets are fine but there is only so many fridge magnets one can buy.

Not worth the visit if you're only here for a few days."
,,Fun to visit,4.0,,No trip to Singapore is complete without a trip to Chinatown. Catch the MRT and wander around the streets. Enjoy some cheap shopping and eating and people watching.
,,A hot day outing,3.0,,"It was extremely hot today when we will walking around the Chinatown. The hawker centre looks pretty clean and organised and there was a clear roof covering this area, hence people can move around freely be it raining or sunny day."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Do yourself a favour and visit this area. Great food and drink at reasonable prices. The prices here are about the same as UK or Australia, whereas in the more trendy places the prices are vastly inflated. Great for dining, having a drink and to watch the world go by."
,,Yet another enjoyable visit,4.0,,"Chinatown is always on my itinerary when I visit Singapore. I catch the MRT to Chinatown station and take the exit to Pagoda Street where all the shops and stalls begin.

This time I stopped for lunch at Chinatown Complex food court. It was very crowded, but I managed to find a seat and I purchased a dish of chicken rice ($3) and a mango juice ($3), and thoroughly enjoyed it.

After a further look around and small purchases of souvenirs I walked to Chinatown Point where I had a delicious ice cream at Paulini. A heaped cup of two flavours, pistachio and coconut, cost me $8.80."

,,Very crowded,4.0,,I went there on weekend and got stuck in traffic for a long time. It was raining so I could not get better feel of the area. You can use MRT to visit China Town. MRT blue line is connected with China Town. The MRT station is located close to China Town point shopping mall.
,,Singapore Food Paradise,5.0,,A visit to Chinatown is a must for every visitor to singapore. Old charm buildings small hotels night markets. Singapores Chinatown restaurants are relaxing enjoyable fun!Very famous also.
,,Colourful Chinatown,4.0,,"With the MRT station right at Chinatown's doorstep, it's easy and cheap to get there for both food and shopping.

,,"Markets, markets, markets!",4.0,,"Become the same after the first 2 or 3 rows but I have to say that I manged to spend a good amount of money buying souvenirs for myself and family and friends. Some great bargains on cheap goods. Well worth the walk through. Didn't eat but some great smells coming from rhe food stalls. Compared to little India , this is my pick. Caught the SMRT which was very easy."
,,Very Chinese area,4.0,,Obviously looks like to be in China very characteristic and particular area with amazing food and nice China shops A visit is a must
,,Typical chinatown,4.0,,"It's a nice walk and fun to do. It is a bit of a tourist trap though, with the typical tourist geared shops and stalls. It does gather some popular foods though, such as the salted egg chips/fish skin, pork jerky, and etc. it's also close to one of the Michelin star restaurants!!!!!"
,,Shopping and watching the world go by,5.0,,"Best time to go afternoon/evening. Great for bargains, lots of stalls. Great for eating local food, chilling with a beer and watching the world go by."
,,A Visit to Chinatown,5.0,,A visit to Chinatown is definitely not to be missed especially during the Lunar New Year festive season. All the streets will be nicely decorated with new year ornaments and you can soak in the festive atmosphere. Chinatown Foodstreet is must to visit if you paying a visit to Chinatown.
,,Chinatown is cool (but the weather is hot!),4.0,,"If you like to shop and are looking for local color, and not high quality (but inexpensive stuff), go here!!"
,,Take some time and wander around,4.0,,"We visited Chinatown on a walking tour but also spent time there ourselves afterwards to explore a little more.

Apart from the obvious street names including Mosque, Temple, Pagoda and Food Streets let yourself get a little lost and you’ll come across some hidden gems as well as some unusual items in shops ranging from luggage tags saying “My Bag. Not Yours” etc. to carrot Cake that is carrot or Cake, to medicines like lizard on a stick and sea horses. Just amazing.

Also make sure that you visit the Chinatown Heritage Centre, Sri Mariamman Temple, Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum, Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum and Maxwell Centre for some famous Hainanese Chicken Rice.

More details about these are in separate reviews that I have also posted."

,,The best Chinatown we've been to!,5.0,,"We have been to many Chinatowns ( New York City, San Francisco ) and this one far outweighs the others in variety, cleanliness and ambiance."
,,China Town,4.0,,The best China outside China.. The Chinese food may not suit the first timers.. Good experience.. Can feel the real China in Singapore... A must visit place in China and give a try to Chineese menu...
,,So much varieties of things to shop..,4.0,,A well planned place to shop and treat to the local variety of local foods. The special shop that sell the barbecue pork and chicken floss are not to be missed. Plenty of things to shop like beautiful local painting of orchids and landscapes. A wonderful stroll along the busy streets in Singapore China Town.
,,Interesting Area To Explore,5.0,,The area of Singapore is broken up into various areas and Chinatown is one of them. Each area is quite different and worth exploring. Chinatown is definitely worth a visit. It will take you a few hours to explore so plan in spending some time there to get the full flavor of the area.
,,A short visit,3.0,,"It was a really short visit as the same was included in our city tour package. Singapore is a small place, which has Little India as well as China Town. As an Indian , I enjoyed Indian cuisine at Little India. China Town is a small place with Chinese temples and good to visit for some time."
,,Same Same but Different,5.0,,"We were revisiting this corner of Singapore that we loved. We were surprised at how it seems to have had a tidy up.
It was much easier to move through. The stalls have more space between them. The night arrived the lights came on and the magic was back.
We could spend more time here."
,,Quick Stroll,4.0,,Went on a quick stroll in this area as we decided to alight at Chinatown station. I love how it has a lot of food stalls around and the old buildings just feels different.
,,The best Chinatown outside of China I've visited,4.0,,They're are China Towns every where! This is however in my opinion the best Chinatown outside of China I've visited. Probably mainly due to how many Chinese live here.
,,Food,5.0,,A lot of food along the way. Hungry? Go there and you'll be amazed by how their food taste like heaven. A lot of stuff to buy as well. And go on weekday so it's not that crowded.
,,durian place,5.0,,Don't forget to visit the durian market there . Tasty and cheap . The owner was very kindly . The supermarket is very cheap in Singapore. And best rate for exchange money .
,,Some of the best vegetarian food found!,5.0,,"My Singaporean friend showed me this area, and in addition to the numerous chinese temples and shops was some of the best food I have eaten in Singapore. The Fortune centre/mall has countless veggie eats, but they have fake meat made from either soy stuff or incredible mushrooms! I am not kidding, one mushroom dish tasted like spare ribs! I had to keep checking it was defo not meat. I had 'chicken' satay and kung po 'chicken' and it felt like, for the first time in years, I was really eating chicken. For this reason, Chinatown is one of my favourite visits in Singapore."
,,Noinah,4.0,,It's wonderful place cause have a lot of food. I really recommend the stream chicken rice was so good.
,,Nice and interesting part of the city,5.0,,"I can warmly recommend to visit this part of the city for a day, with a visit to the big buddha tempel as well."
,,Cheap Souvenir and Great Food,4.0,,"Love this Chinatown and it much better than the one in KL. Lot of tourist come here for souvenirs hunting and yes, you can find many shops sell key chain, hand fan, doll, and t-shirt. Just remember to check several shop before you make your purchase. As most shops sell same items, you can always get a better price after comparing offer from 1 shop to another.

The food also really delicious. We enter one hawker stall where they serve Fried Pork with Lemon Gravy and it was so good. We order it several time because everybody want more. Other menu also good as well.

Overall, I do recommend to visit the Chinatown. You can visit The Buddha Tooth Relic temple nearby and other temple around here. Don't forget to buy some bakkwa (salty-sweet dried meat, pork or chicken) and pork/chicken floss."
,,A wonderful glance over the Singaporean Chinese culture and taste,5.0,,"It is certainly a good place for foreigners and tourists to experience and understand more about the Singaporean Chinese evolutionary culture and culinary art.

Easily accessed by MRT and public bus.
Variety of food is offered at reasonable price. It is also a place you can shop for nice souvenirs."
,,Must visit place,5.0,,Loved their shopping variety. Some had great deals for bulk shopping gifts. Variety at food street. Nice ceramics stuff. Fresh orange juice.
,,Must visit for a short trip to Singapore,5.0,,"Absolutely loved Chinatown. The architecture, the markets, the food and the atmosphere. I visited 3 times in my 3 days in Singapore. We visited Maxwell Food Centre for the cheap and delicious food (e.g. Tian Tian chicken rice). The Buddha Tooth Relic temple is worth a visit as well. The souvenirs aren't the cheapest compared to the rest of Asia but it is nice to wonder around just for the atmosphere. My favourite thing about Chinatown was the cute little Peranakan houses"
,,Really crowded,4.0,,"I think its interesting to visit the china towns of every country I visit.

The crowd was really more than i anticipated during my visit, coupled with the weather, I didn't stay for too long.

Tried Bak-kwa for the first time, and it was great! There's a few tours to choose from and a tourist desk for help as well."
,,Good for cheap gifts,3.0,,"Went with my 7 yrs old daughter in the morning as soon as the shops open and bought gifts for all our friends as they are super cheap. However although the houses and the area is really picturesque, we left early as it wasn't interesting.
Maybe if one goes when there is some fair going on it would be nicer."
,,A fun place,5.0,,"This is a fun place to visit, Pagoda st is full of colour and people.Lots of shops and interesting goods to purchase."
,,A great place to eat,4.0,,We loved Chinatown for all the variety of shops and sounds and smells. Our favourite was the hawker food stalls where helpful and friendly attendants helped us find our favourite foods at very cheap prices. So delicious!
,,Chinatown with Character,5.0,,"Excellent place to indulge in food and drink, but it does not stop there.

The place is full of color and smells with an amazing variety of stalls and shops where you could get lost for hours.

Chinatown is very easy to get to, just ask the locals or pick up a map and use the public transport. It can get busy, so it is a matter of planning a good few hours and even consider being there during the week as opposed to the weekend.

Chinatown is a place worth visiting."
,,Exciting,4.0,,"Great food,beer and tourist tat! What's not to like.Get out there explore and enjoy! Get down the side streets."
,,Great Food,4.0,,Chinatown is the best place to be while on holiday in Singapore. There are great hotels surrounded by many attractions including great cheap food markets and good shopping and if you are not staying there it's easy to get there by public transport.
,,Cool wee place.,3.0,,"Lots of shops, stalls and restaurants with beautiful temples and monuments. Check it out if you have the chance however prepare for foot traffic, and if you don't enjoy big crowds try and go during the week or a time that isn't busy."
,,Tired Looking and Dated,3.0,,"Time has not been nice to this historic area. This is super touristy with the typical cheesy shops and food stalls. Kids might still love it, but it is not authentic or interesting."
,,Great food and atmosphere,5.0,,Loved Chinatown. We have been to Singapore before but never made it here. Great place to walk around then sit and enjoy a delicious meal and just people watch.
,,Big area of Singapore,5.0,,Chinatown encompasses a significant area of Singapore. Here you can find some gorgeous temples and great food. The temples are not too far apart so walking is relatively easy.
,,Disappointed,3.0,,I used to walk through this place every night from work but it is not as good as I remember. Too many restaurants now but none open when we were there looking for a meal around 11am.
,,Singapore Chinatown: Singapore's Major Landmark and the Best Souvenir Shopping Place,5.0,,"Singapore's Chinatown is a major landmark with nostalgic history. It is also the best place to buy Singapore souvenirs from many shops along Pagoda Street. You can visit Chinatown Heritage Centre on Pagoda Street, and walk along Keong Saik Road dotted with well preserved old Chinatown era buildings. Those interested in viewing Hindu Temple, you can visit the temple not far from Keong Saik Road.
Chinatown can be reached by metro [Line NE4 or Line DTL1 (Downtown Line 1)]. It is very important for you to use Pagoda Street exit (Exit A) to exit Chinatown metro station which would lead you right to the main street, Pagoda Street. If you happen to exit via different exit (e.g. Exit B, C, D, E), you would get lost rather easily. If you are out of these wrong exits, go back into the metro station, and follow Exit A sign to go to the heart of Chinatown, Pagoda Street. I made a mistake of exiting via Exit D last time, and ended up wasting a lot of time to get back to the right place. Don't count on asking people there. Some of them have language problem, and some might just give you a vague finger direction which would not be helpful. The map board on the street is not much helpful, because it shows street names without any indication on where you are. I saw many frustrated visitors in front of the map board because they could not figure out where they were. If this happens, make sure to return to the metro concourse, and look for Exit A sign leading to Exit A/Pagoda Street."
,,Hectic and fun,4.0,,Chinatown in Singapore was totally hectic with all of the hustle and bustle of vendors touting their wares to curious foreigners visiting Singapore. Everything from of great restaurants and for the more adventurous traveller local street to tailors ready to measure you for a tailor-made suit and the usual souvenirs. Well worth a visit.
,,Good for having Chinese food,3.0,,"Go to Chintown if you want some cheap food in the hawker centres. There are also tim sum and lots of local fare along most of the street corner. If you are there check out the chicken noodles stall opposite the Chinatown complex. It is cheap and tasty. During Chinese New Year , you can buy many of the local goodies there. Beware of your wallet if there is a huge crowd."
,,Less then expected,3.0,,"Seems that China town in KL and Singapore have just one goal - to catch as many tourist as possible offering them pretty average food. We experienced much better food in other parts of Singapore.
One good thing is Chinatown - Indian (!!!) shops offering pretty good products (especially the wooden ones) nearly for nothing! For the same things in Bali you have to pay 4 times more!"
,,GOOD FOR SOUVENIR SHOPPING,4.0,,"If you have time, visit this place for shopping and enjoy the bustling life. Indulge in souvenir shopping, with scope for bargaining."
,,Good place for buying stuff for memories,5.0,,Nice place to visit and buy stuff for your family and friends as a gift memories of Singapore and destination places
,,I really enjoyed it,5.0,,"I love the architecture..small houses aurrounded by tall akucrapers. It seema anothwr world....Reading the history of Nanjing Road ( the Old Chinatown squatters) it seema inpossible that that part was the poorest part of Singapore....it is pitoresque with many reataurants, a temple, a mosque and of course a Chinese Market!"
,,The same thing,3.0,,We traveled to Chinatown via the MRT. There is more than enough shopping and food to go around. Shopping comes in the form of malls and stalls. The stalls all seem to have the same thing geared towards gaining the tourist dollar.
,,Busy and crowded,3.0,,Very average to chinatown in other countries. A lot of people and shops means it's a busy and crowded place.
,,Always bustling,5.0,,"We always enjoy a visit to Chinatown when in Singapore. Always crowded but an enjoyable walk through the narrow alleyways. Lots of choices and some good tailors, many places to eat and grab a drink or a coffee. Just another fun experience in Singapore"
,,If you have time available,3.0,,"I didn´t really see much there. Mostly souveniers shops. It is an important part of the city. Thus you may feel obliged to go. Do it, but only if you really have time."
,,"Busy, bustling and full of life",4.0,,"We enjoyed walking around in the evening. The crowds, sights and sounds make it a special place. Sit down and try some of the delicacies that are available."
,,Tourist trap,3.0,,"The original Chinatown quarter is almost diminished and has lost it's charme and character. Now you find stores with cheap plastic items as souvenirs. Restaurants are expensive and the food quality does not meet expectations. In former times a must to visit, now rather disappointing. There are much better places to spend time in Singapore"
,,my fave shopping place!,4.0,,"always come here when I looked for merchandise or other things. you can get cheaper things in here. if you hungry, I recommend you to take the stairs and get to the other side of road. you will get a lot of yummie and cheap food in there"
,,Cheaper and cheerful,5.0,,"You'll find a lot of what you need at a fraction of the price here.

Plus lots of quaint food places you can try with the usual ""come in and try here"" guys. They're all pretty friendly.

I'm fussy with my food so I usually do high end stuff."
,,Chinatown Experience,4.0,,"I always enjoy walking the streets in Chinatown looking at all the cheap souvenirs and nicknacks. You can't beat the quality and price for food in the food courts there (Maxwell especially). I always make a point of visiting and grabbing some chicken rice, char siew (not sure on the spelling), and some iced coffee (kopi ping)."
,,"Exotic, exiting and estraorinaire",5.0,,"A must see when in Singaore - have fun, and check out all the exiting stores and good bargains - and remember to be polite whilst negotiating the price"
,,Chinatown,5.0,,Good for shopping souvenirs Many shops and food choices Cheap things to buy Good area in Singapore worth the visit
,,"Must come over, nice and crowded town of experience",5.0,,"The town is quiet crowded, a lot of souvenir shops and restaurants available. The food are really great and people are nice. SO much recommend to visit this place. I found the chicken rice and the chili crab is so nice here. 50$ for a chili crab dish"
,,Good for food.,3.0,,"This China Town is alright, not amazing but a great spot for affordable food and a few really cool pop up stalls for family presents and jewellery."
,,Experience,5.0,,China town is a compact area in Singapore. It is friendly. There is a hawker market in the centre where we had a good reasonably priced meal. We visited in the evening. It felt safe. The people/ restauranteurs and shopkeepers were all friendly and not pushy.
,,Seems legit?!,4.0,,"We went straight in from the MRT and hawkers were trying to scam us inside 2 min! The leather (made out the back) bracelet dropped from $35 to $10 in 3 mins. Still didn't buy it.
Around the corner were 2 more stalls selling the same thing so clearly not made out the back. This was fun. I liked the color and the inability to understand any of the hawkers! It was different. Probably enough to keep you busy for 45 mins."
,,Great Singapore saved a least area of traditional Chines Houses,4.0,,A large number of the traditional Chines neighborhoods / houses have been sacrificed during my first visit to Singapore 30 years ago. But fortunate the Singapore Government was so smart to save at least some of them......and make it a tourist area without traffic. All kind of shops and you can buy tailor-made suites and buy Asian food as much as you want. Do not forget to open your eyes and look upstairs to the traditionel houses!
,,Not your New York Chinatown,3.0,,"This is the cleanest Chinatown I've ever been to! The food was great and the atmosphere was neat, but if you're looking for that NY Chinatown, gritty feel then you've come to the wrong place."
,,A must for Tourists & locals,5.0,,"Indulge in nostalgia typical of ethnic Chinese groups. Early settlers of immigrants from all parts of China started their stay when they first arrived here. Over the years, had changed, but heritage still remain strong in this vibrant city.
Shops for souvenirs a plenty with lots of bargain huntings along Smith Street and the adjacent few streets of stalls and shops including variety of food choices. Traditional to fusion a plentiful of selections.
Attire should best be neat short sleeves or shorts or thin cotton clothes as walking around in this low summer weathers mostly will cause you to sweat outdoors. Of course most eateries and shops indoors are fully Air-conditioned for your cooling comforts when your walking around get too warm for your liking.
Evening weather is lower compared to afternoon sunny.
Consider visiting the nearby temples as well as the Heritage trials.
For Budget conscious, you can try the local food in the hawkers centre that serves very nice local food in the Upper 2nd floor of the Market Along Smith Street.
You could try, the chicken rice, Fish balls with or without noodles, either in soup or dry (with or without chilli). They also serves a variety of Cold Deserts & Juices to quench your Thirst after a long walk.
Locals style of food sharing is a common sight. So feel free if you have a group of 3 to 5/6 persons, you can order a few types and share amongst yourselves as a form of food tasting to determine your own taste buds. One man's meat is another man's poison as the saying goes.
Local stalls have gradings too, like those restaurants. It determines their Food Taste in accordance to ratings from A, B, C & D being the worst. Generally, hawkers stalls are clean and if they are not, they will be suspended as our Environment Ministry takes A serious and strict view on Food Hygiene in our Country."
,,"Very crowded, week before Chinese New Year",3.0,,"Used to own a shop near Trengganu Street, it is very crowded week before CNY as many Singaporean will visit Chinatown to buy their CNY goodies.

Telling us about the history of singapore etc.etc spend just on 2 hours talking to him could have stayed long ."
,,"a must for value, the vision and the food",4.0,,"An expansive China town by Aussie terms - several streets and laneways dotted with bars, restaurants fashion, memorabilia and a far bit of kitch/junk. Best vale bee in town ($7 a bottle vs $22 a glass in the main hotels) and be prepared to haggle on the clothes front - and be wary of sizes so try them on - my XXL shirt equated to an M. A lot fun and also some very good duck restaurants"

If you are interested in Chinese medicine then this is the heart of it and getting things cheap cheap.

Then move to the main strip for cheap souveniers for friends and family back home. At the end of themain street for souveniers on the right handside is a temple which is worth visiting.

if you are in luck you might get there as monks are chanting.

then walk down towards the buddha tooth relic temple. Wish i had more time to spend in china town."
,,Good way to kill some time,4.0,,"Chinatown is a good place to visit but if you've travelled in China itself it's a quite watered down version.

There's good food and relatively cheap food also. There's good souvenir shops and it's an enjoyable way to wander and spend some time in an afternoon/ evening"

,,Pretty & shopping galore,5.0,,"Lovely part of Singapore, loads of tourists. The shopping is good if you are after some cheap souvenirs.

,,Looooove it,5.0,,"You have to visit China town when you are in Singapore. Loads of stalls, shops..... wow.... loved it. You are approached to have clothes made but I didn't...... perhaps next time.

,,Fun walk,5.0,,"A fun walk around Chinatown, so much to see, so much to buy and visit. Chinatown in Singapore is lovely."
,,Awesome Chinatown,5.0,,This place is full on Chinatown and the best experience. You can see and buy anything from take home trinkets to east asian artifacts.
,,Souvenirs and food,3.0,,"Nice place to walk through for the experience. Good to buy your souvenirs as I found them cheap here. Lots of other products to browse in the market. There are many food outlets here that are quite busy. Although its nothing special and similar to most china towns around the world except this one doesn't have fake brands. If you miss it, don't be disappointed."
,,Best place to eat.,5.0,,"The food is great value for money and delicious, it's hot but where isn't in Singapore ! Good variety and plenty of other things to do and see with so many shops."
,,Good cheap food,4.0,,It may not look very good but the quality and choices of the food make the two different food halls great places to eat and drink. Also good to be able to watch the world go by.
,,Colourful and vibrant Chinatown,4.0,,"Loved the different coloured buildings and old style architecture. A variety of shops, stalls and eateries to keep one occupied for a while. Worth the trip."

,,Must visit,5.0,,The whole atmosphere of this place is quaint. Some good bargains to shop on the street. Food joints that are highly recommended with desserts joints dot the temple street and the mosque street. The pagoda street is food for shopping.
,,Huge food,5.0,,"Every place in the world has Chinatown, but the food is kind of different on each place. I took some bingsu there and it was delicious. A lot of food on the street that you can easily pick up the food you really want to try the most."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"Not sure if it was because we were there at the start of the shopping day so there were only a few people about but we were very disappointed with Chinatown this time round. The street markets were full of the same touristy items over and over again and nothing unusual or interesting in the way of souvenirs. All very predictable with the one exception of the Tintin shop we stumbled across amongst the stalls. If you grew up on Tintin books do stop in, they have some very unique items for a range of prices. Well worth a look if only for nostalgia.

The mall we visited in Chinatown was equally ininteresting to us and we didn't stay long.

Bugis St market was much better in terms of a market we felt with far more variety."
,,a bright contrast with modern singapore,5.0,,"walking around these safe and preserved housing in Chinatown was a pleasure. architecture is very nice, there are some nice shops that are not just ""touristic"" but where you can actually buy good things."
,,Lots of trinkets,4.0,,"If trinkets and inexpensive gifts are your thing, you'll love this place. It's a whole streets worth and there are some actual antiques amid the trinkets but for the most part it's a bustling street of stalls fun of Chinese stuff you probably don't need. The food is great there so stop and try some of you get a chance. Great food abounds."
,,Always a good time,5.0,,Chinatown in Singapore is different (in a good way) from Chinatowns in other big cities (like S.F. or NYC). A fun place to wander and barter (sometimes) and dine.
,,hawker centres and street shopping,4.0,,"visit in the evening. many lanes of street shops, selling souvenirs and traditional food, balms, decor etc...visit maxwel hawker centre for chicken rice..lots of massage parlours around for special Chinese massage to relieve pains.. dont forget to pay a visit to the buddha tooth relic temple and a hindu temple..gettimg cabs can get difficult sometimes."
,,Excellent Chinese culture !!,5.0,,Its like a mini china around with lot of restaurants and shops around. you can buy good amount of memorable with cheapest prices here
,,Average,3.0,,"Wanted to see what Chinatown was like in the modern Singapore. Typical Asian stalls selling typically Asian tourist fare but the variety of food available was quite good, seating around the food stalls is at a premium at certain times."
,,WELL WORTH A VISIT,5.0,,Went here on our first night looking for somewhere to eat. My wife found a Chinese Restaurant ( Chinatown Seafood Restaurant) with Trip Advisor recommendation. The food was first class and reasonably priced and many tourists were eating there so they may have read the reviews also. Went back for some shopping another day and got some real bargains. Recommended.

,,Under construction when we came,3.0,,"I did not find it very interesting at all, not like what we have in vancouver. Anyway, we just had some dessert there. You wont miss anything if you dint go there."

,,Great cultural visit,4.0,,"We ate dinner here for just a few dollars. In each food staff lookfor a 2017 awards sign plus a health/cleanliness rating of A or B displayed. We had lovely dumplings, spring rolls and fried rice."
,,Stroll through,4.0,,Taking a stroll through Chinatown here is like taking a stroll through any Chinatown in any city in the world. You have your cheap souvenir shops and your markets but you are a tourist and they know it
,,Well worth the visit,4.0,,"Singapore's Chinatown is a fascinating part of Singapore with great places to eat, shop and also experience the Chinese culture. Well worth a visit"
,,Interesting,4.0,,Been to several chinatowns throughout the world and this is the real deal. Good to walk around and soak up the atmosphere and bag some bargains.
,,Taste of China,5.0,,"This District in Singapore really lives up to its name. There are plenty of Chinese shops & souvenir shops which sell an array of goods ranging from souvenirs to imitation ones.

There's also a street dining hall that really provide diners a wide array & selection of cuisines. It has different varieties & cultures.

What i love in this quaint District is the ambiance and the cleanliness. The price of the food is affordable."
,,busy and lots touirists,3.0,,"if you get of the metro and go the other way its more local and the food is cheaper and better , the street and area is clean and safe . but best to exit the metro walk where the locals eat and hang out :)"
,,Busy!!!!,3.0,,Interesting area with lots to see. Mainly souvenir shops and eating houses. Noisy and busy with lots of people. Cheap trinkets available everywhere.
,,Loved it,5.0,,"A visit to Chinatown is a must. Heaps of stalls to visit and close to the Hindu and Buddha temples. Catch the MRT to Chinatown, it is the quickest way to get there. Make sure that you buy a MRT pass when you first arrive. They are great value. Purchase at any station"
,,Everything Chinese in a few streets,4.0,,"It's loud, busy, hot, colourful, with ' magic odours'. Numerous restaurants offering every possible combination of real Chinese cuisine line the lanes mixed with small shops offering clothing to fit all sizes and tastes from traditional Chinese dress to modern and colourful designs. Anxious and helpful hawkers encourage you to view and possibly purchase their wares. Safe and in a small space many great experiences for the traveller."
,,Good food,4.0,,"Good food from a large number of outlets, and also a good spot for souvenirs and clothes. There are many tailors in this area."
,,Great sights and easy walk,4.0,,"See dome great old buildings and temples. Maxwell Hawker centre in China Town, gets very busy. Some hidden gems, worth walking around rather than bus."
,,You kind of have to do it,4.0,,"Chinatown - at least the pedestrianised area around Pagoda and Mosque Streets - seems to be one of those areas where everyone winds up at some point. Whether that's a good thing is up to the individual.

First things first: The shops and restaurants at street level are largely interchangeable. Here a two-minute calligraphy place, there a collection of t-shirts, next to it a restaurant, and so on. If souvenirs are your thing, do remember that very few of them are genuinely ""made in Singapore"", and that prices are at least in theory negotiable. The Chinatown Visitors' Centre would appear to have a better range and better quality if you're in the neighbourhood of the Buddha Tooth Temple.

The trick to Chinatown is to look beyond the rampant commercialism. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is well worth a visit, for example, and there's some very good food to be had on the upper level of the Chinatown Complex, rather than at street level."
,,perfect for shopping and food,5.0,,"central location, cheap street food- fresh, nice people and friendly, open air seating. cheap shopping. perfect, must visit."
,,Cheap and fun,5.0,,Best place to get your souvenir and gift shopping done. Great cheap kids clothes. Buddha tooth temple also here and night food hawkers market is worth a look. But cross over the main road away from tourist area to Maxwell Food Centre for awesome cheap local food
,,Hawker Chan's HK Soya Chicken!went,5.0,,"Ate at the new 78 Smith Street air-conditioned shop. Lacks the /ambiance of the 355 Smith hawker center, but the food was delicious."
,,Chinatown is Shops and Food,4.0,,"This is interesting area but mostly shops and food stalls. There are some nice shops for Chinese style souvenirs to draw your interest. Is generally very busy area, but in late afternoon is not so much. Maybe good time to go. Very interesting India temple at the entrance area. Not to be missed."
,,Must visit for souvenir shopping,5.0,,Great place to go for bargain shopping for souvenir. Save alot of money for gifts and decorative trinkets for home. Do visit the Tintin store. Great food and shoppimg make a great tourist destination. A must visit destination.

,,Love this place!,5.0,,Great place for a bargain. Love the laid back buzzy atmosphere. Food not so great that we tried but would go back for a 3rd time!
,,Nice place to spend a few hours,5.0,,We had previously been to China town in 2009 and revisited it again 2017 still the same very very busy with loads of different shoos and eating houses all at prices that are reasonable when you compare with some of the mor modern shopping malls
,,It's changed,3.0,,"We where last here 7 years ago and came back most nights, this time we where a bit disappointed as there where a lot less shops and some of the operator gave you the impression they would rather be somewhere else."
,,Massive Chinatown!!,5.0,,This place is super busy and the prices are fairly reasonable based on other China towns that I have visited. Lots of restaurants and interesting stores.
,,I love this temple,5.0,,"I love the place if your buying souveniers for your loveones chinatown is the best place to buy foods and things, I also prayed here about love and money so far Buddha always grant it❤️❤️❤️"
,,Excellent food,3.0,,"Had some amazing food here, our cheapest dinners whilst on our 10 day trip. Lots of trip advisor stickers and ok public toilets. Loved all the fresh ingredients cooked whilst you wait and the lemon tea was so refreshing. The shops were as expected but you won't get cheap suits here now. My husband was measured for a jacket which would have been £300. Need to visit if only to eat"
,,Eat and shop,4.0,,"Singapore is an extremely clean city and its Chinatown had to be the cleanest in the world. If you are hungry, you will not be disappointed"
,,Just like any chinatown in the world,3.0,,Hot and the things there are not exactly unique. You can find the best money changers there which is in people park complex which is at chinatown mrt. Very touristy.
,,Old Chinatown shopping!!,5.0,,A fabulous place to visit for all your souvenir needs and to experience the 'real' Chinese way of life. fabulous shops selling all manner of thing and some fantastic eating opportunities!!
,,Souvenir shopping,4.0,,The cleanest Chinatown we have visited! We came here as a suggestion by a driver to get our souvenir shopping done. If you're looking for cheap buys and shopping for friends and family - this was the place to go! They have lots of cheesy souvenirs perfect for taking back home. There's also lots of clothing and foods sold. We didn't eat here but saw many many restaurants as we were walking. If you get out from the MRT station - it can be confusing so ask somebody where the smaller stalls are for souvenir shopping and they can guide you OR explore around! That's the fun of Chinatown!
,,Crowded,3.0,,Well the place is okay.. it looks fancy and some shopping.. but the place is crowded and not too good for a couple to visit.
,,"Busy, Crazy, fabulous",5.0,,"Saturday night, place was packed and the atmosphere was great. Food everywhere, not cheap but everything you could want is here.
Its an easy walk around and there is lots to see. Usual shops, stalls with market things for sale.
Its worth a visit but for the buzz in the streets."
,,Amazing,5.0,,My favorite suburb of Singapore.Rich with culture and cusine from all parts of Asia. Beautiful architecture and laneways.Recommend Burnt Ends for dinner amd wondering the market areas to look at stalls and eat and drink ($6.95 Longnecks of Tiger)!
,,Chinatown place of food!,5.0,,If you are in Singapore and don't where to eat. Chinatown is the best choice. I found a lot of variety Chinese and Asian food around. Make me really confused which restaurant I gonna start with all look good and hygiene.
,,Colourful,4.0,,Very colourful place with lots of shopping Malls .. some dated .. but certainly has the Chinatown flavour to it .. always crowded and the energy is great!
,,Fabulous atmosphere!,4.0,,"A visit to Chinatown when visiting Singapore is essential to absorb the diverse culture that makes Singapore, Singapore. One can spend a delightful few hours simply meandering around taking in the sights, sounds, colours and smells of this vibrant part of the city. Street food is abundant and the shops tempt you in to browse! Wonderful experience!"
,,Historic,5.0,,"Not much at the markets, cheap clothing that only lasts a couple of washes. Must see if going is tooth pagoda and Chinatown heritage centre. Will give you a history of the area. Great tourist bureau opposite pagoda with helpful staff"
,,Bad idea.,1.0,,"I visited this place with my family from overseas. I've lived here for the past 11 years and I can tell you this (I'm a credible source :D) that this place is a nightmare. Prepare to be pickpocketed, shouted at and called nuts in Chinese. This place is absolutely unsafe and unbearably crowded. My advice: this should be your bottom priority on your itinerary.

E.G, I wanted to look at this fan in this stall along the street. It's at a corner, so if you spot a rainbow flag, walk all the way straight until you hit the street parallel to chinatown mall. As I was attempting to close the fan, this extremely rude China lady from the shop yelled at me and said I didn't close the fan properly and that I shouldn't open the fan. Lol you need to know what you're buying, am I right? She spat at me, snatched the fan away the fan from my hand, and to make matters worse, she cursed at me! (I find it outrageous that she dares to slander me, in any case, the law would be on my side, and not some foreigner.)

The layout is untidy compared to the rest of Singapore, and with so many pushy salespersons, you'll likely won't enjoy your time there.

If you want to, only visit the eating spots. DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM HERE."
,,A Must!,5.0,,"This is so much different to Chinatown in Melbourne. It's effectively a small suburb with quite a history, as I found out at the Heritage Centre. Shops and restaurants abound. Expect to be invited in to shops to buy clothes or camera gear from friendly, but pushy, salespeople. Be polite and be firm. It can be fun once you are used to it!. Immense choices for food! Beer is much cheaper than in Melbourne cafes. Bonus!

Do visit the Buddha Tooth Relic Buddhist temple and the Sri Mariammam Hindu temple. Great contrasts!

For the less adventurous, there are some shopping malls full of Chinese and other Asain cuisines. A bit ""safer"" but still very good."
,,Wonderful area full of atmosphere,5.0,,"Loved our visit to China Town and all the interesting stalls and shops. Plenty of character, lots of people, and feeling very safe. Lots of restaurants and eateries on Smith Street, but recommend the stalls in the middle of the street as they are much cheaper than the small restaurants that try to entice you to dine with them. Good variety of choices and great taste"
,,Quaint Place,5.0,,Lots of old shophouses and traditional items here ! Must visit when you are in Singapore. Can be a bit crowded in peak period
,,Good place for everyday life,5.0,,"We went here everyday because there were new and untapped places. The food here is wonderful as it is made at home. Enough money We bought the stuff as much as we wanted, because it's cheaper here than in tourist destinations. We used the money exchange services, it was a very good course, the queues are small. The Durian passes through the fruit department with a very specific smell."
,,"Very Nice, just like sarojini nagar of Singapore",4.0,,things here are also not very cheap. But you will find variety of stuff cheaper than other parts of Singapore.
,,Late night dinner spot,5.0,,"So many good spot to eat and shop. The food super super good and not so expensive, good ambience at night."
,,Athomspere is gooood.,5.0,,"The only place is Singapore that I felt citylife and urban athmosphere. Alot of people selling touriststuff, but nice restaurants, and a chinese temple. Easy to get to."
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,"We went to China town with IndieSingapore guide Wei and we loved it. We got a great understanding of its history, how important it was in Singapores development as well as how great it is to eat in these days. Hawker markets are the go and China town has the best.
If you are in a Singapore make sure you visit China town, eat in a hawkers market ( not at local lunch time as very busy) and join a walking tour or get a local guide as you will enjoy it so much more."
,,A good way to spend a couple hours,4.0,,We strolled through here to see the various little trinket shops and restaurants. It was very colorful and lively. I definitely recommend that you stop by to see the two temples while you're going through Chinatown.
,,Nice place with an authentic feel,5.0,,This was the only place I visited in S'pore with an actual athmosphere. Busy streets filled with people and little stores and restaurants. The street lights were pretty after sunset.
,,"Busy, charming, facinating",5.0,,"One of the best places to visit in Singapore. So authentic place! Food market is amazing! Great souvenirs, many shops, wow, it is a must place to visit!"
,,A must see in Singapore,4.0,,"Can't go to Singapore without visiting Chinatown. Wonderful architecture, interesting streets, lots of market stalls, heaps of restaurants, wonderful food. 6 of us ate at a seafood restaurant. Food was terrific."
,,Not so nice anymore,2.0,,"Chinatown is not as fascinating as it was the first couple of times I visited. Now it's just a place to pop by if I'm looking for something specific. Certain times the streets and shops are super crowded, so take care of your valuables."
,,Exploring on foot,4.0,,"We explored Chinatown by going on a self discovery walking tour. We explored the neighbourhood, stopping for food tastings along the way, from Bakkwa to desserts. Bakkwa was prepared with thin slices of meat grilled slowly over charcoal. We also stopped at a bakery for a pastry tasting, followed by a Chinese tea shop. We enjoy our hot piping tea while relaxing our tired legs before we continued exploring Chinatown. There are many artisans plying their trades here. The calligrapher at work was most enticing. Before we leave, we visited a large hawker centre to eat just like the locals do as Singapore is famous for its street style food."
,,Busy busy busy,3.0,,Similar in nature to other Chinatown's but maybe on a bit larger scale. Here you can find many tailor's willing to make you that special suit or shirt to take home. We didn't have time so can't rate that experience. Lot's of pop-up shops along with traditional store fronts. Easily accessible from the Metro station.
,,my favourite place in Sg,5.0,,"I spent in Sg 1 week. I think it was the best place. Little India as well. Lots of restaurants, tee shops etc. You have to visit the Buddha Toth Temple"
,,A must,5.0,,"Bustling, noise, colourful. Great place for souvenirs. Food markets is well prices but pick your times as it gets crowded and locals cue for their favourite food stalls. If you want don't mind paying slightly more go to Hawker Chans who has now moved into a restaurant in China Town. He has a one star michelin rating on the traditional chicken and rice dish."
,,Chinatown,5.0,,Plenty of souvenir stores snd food stalls/restaurants. There is a 1 Michelin awarded hawker store at the food court - soy chicken rice/noodles. Worth to try its only S$2. But if you prefer aircon/comfort they also have a restaurant 2 streets away buy costs S $4.80. There is the Buddha's tooth temple and the Hindu temple where tourists are welcome.
,,Chinese culture,3.0,,Love Chinese food? then here is a good place to explore Chinese restaurants and their unique culture.
,,"Don't visit China, instead visit this place!",4.0,,"Almost similar to china. Famous for mostly shopping, nearby to little India. Every Indians should visit this place, having many stuffs to look for. Good place to bargain the items while you do the shopping. A great alternative for China Town is Daiso Store which is total of 38 available in Singapore for all in one shops - anything everything for only $2 -
That's it."
,,A place for shopping,5.0,,"Chinatown is a place for eating and shopping, there are many souvenir shops and restaurants, most people here speak chinese, you can buy many famous souvenir here"
,,Heritage place,5.0,,"If you are a tourist, then u should not miss this place. Visit this place after 12 noon as most of the shops open at noon. Lunch there is good. Many local and China Cusine available there.
If you want a Michelin star restaurant, there is one that sell the chicken rice.
A must try when u are in Singapore.

Reasonable priced. Only SGD$3.80 per plate of Noodle. Where can u find a Michelin star restaurant serving at this price???"
,,"Colour, busy and smells",4.0,,"You could spend hours just looking in the tourist shops. Look up and around there is colour everywhere in Chinatown.
The food selection on Smith st is as wide as you can get, something for every pellet. Take in the amazing smells and savour the atmosphere as you wonder from shop to shop."
,,Disappointed.,3.0,,Visited here over thirty years ago and this place had a great buzz about it. I visited here recently on a Saturday night recently at about 9.30pm and most of the restaurants were closing or closed including maxwell hawker centre. Managed to eat in restaurant in chinatown but really expensive. Also there seem to be a lot of construction going on. So my advice is go during day or early evening. Was not the place it used to be.
,,Average,3.0,,"We went throughout the day via the hop on hop off bus. We thought it was average. The shops only offer tourist trinkets, nothing like the market in Thailand. Maybe it would be better at night."
,,A must when you are in Singapore,4.0,,"Not really different from ""Chinatowns"" of other big Cities, however people are very friendly and in most shops you are not hassled to buy something. Very lively and colorfull with interesting smells. Take time and also explore the smaller streets and shops. Great places to find good and inexpensive chineese food."
,,Cheap place to buy gifts,4.0,,Nice place for food and gifts near by the famous temple.its by mrt easy to get to. Opposite side have shop to buy some cheap ticket like cable car and stuff to do in Singapore check it out
,,Stay away from camera shops at Chinatown,3.0,,"Chinatown is a good place for sights. Many food choices. Bought Salted Egg Fish skin there. Just dont go to camera shops because they wont be happy if you wont buy what your looking for. Apparently they only entertain ""real customers"". No canvassing."
,,Chinatown markets,5.0,,"Stayed very close to Chinatown and ventured here a bit. Usual shops selling the same same but they do not hassle you to buy. You can wander along looking with no problems. Lots of dining options, especially along Smith st."

,,Just amazing,5.0,,"I was only on a 24 hour business trip from the UK but managed a trip to Raffles and Chinatown, where I had perhaps the best Chinese food I have ever eaten. I had the soft shell crab and other dishes that were sublime all helped with the friendly service; our waitress even helped us on with our aprons to stop the crab getting everywhere!! Brilliant."
,,Excellent location with a difference,5.0,,"Chinatown is different due the earing places and the shops available compared to other places in Singapore. If you love anything close to various types of Chinese food with meaty stuff, then this is the place. People are veru nice. Lots of street shopping opportunities also near and around the MRT entrances."
,,Overrated!,3.0,,"A typical Chinese area in the city that's found in most cities with good sized Chinese population. Lots of Chinese trinkets, clothings, Chinese herbs & traditional medicine and Chinese foods. Well decorated & lighted during Chinese New Year month."

Singapore Chinatown takes this to a whole new level of delicious food and fun. So many great shops stocking imported Chinese favourites (you will love the potato chips) and the food stalls are great, especially the local hawkers. Bring cash with you as Visa and Mastercard are not always accepted but this means you can just haggle . Bring a camera and enjoy the ride."

,,Just another Chinatown,3.0,,"A very bustling area of Singapore, especially over weekends which is when we visited. Lots of stores mostly selling touristy stuff to jewellery and many, many eating places mostly selling Chinese.

Some stores were selling at bargain prices enticing tourist by giving discounted rates for multiples of the same item.

Part of a heritage area, with temples and close to other areas. It was given conservation status in July of 1989 and has four distinct sub-districts which forms part of the greater town (Da Po). Great for an afternoon walk or stroll.

This Chinatown is certainly well maintained and kept in clean pristine state, but that is the norm for Singapore."
,,Hawker stalls galore,5.0,,"Everything Chinese, a little less glam than other parts of Singapore but safe, just real! Busy people working and lunching or commuting! Waited five minutes to get my order for dim sum that was hand made and steamed in front of me! Just fantastic!
Great for buying gifts in the market!"

,,Still the cheapest place to buy souvenirs,4.0,,"Had to go here with my staff to buy souvenirs and gifts. Still the cheapest place to buy.

I love my glow in the dark shirt and tumblers. The usual keychains, coasters, table toppers, etc usually go for 18 for 10dollars, 4 for 10dollars and 3 for 10dollars respectively.

They also have a souvenir pressed penny so dont forget to get yourself one."
,,Shoppers paradise for street shopping,4.0,,"Chinatown is that part of old Singapore, away from Malls and high rises. It's the original Singapore culture. Good place for street shopping and souvenir hunting. Must bargain a lot and you can pick up amazing stuff for cheap rates."

,,Check it out,4.0,,Great food and cheap...huge competition....excellent range of clothes...gifts and other goods. Excellent service
,,What I expected,5.0,,Market with wares as one would expect. Nothing great to say but nothing bad to say either. Not much at this time that took my interest but I wouldn't hesitategoing again on my next visit. I should elaborate and say my children are too old and don't need some things but the grand children are too young to enjoy some of the novelties. I would imagine I could find more to buy in future.
,,China Town - as you would expect,3.0,,"Pretty much like most China Towns. If you have nothing on and want to get out of the hotel, it is worth the visit. Walk around the area for an hour or so, take in the sights and the colours, enjoy the smells and then choose one of the many restaurants to eat at. I prefer the restaurants with out door seating (of which there are many) to watch the masses walk pass."
,,Great atmosphere,5.0,,Spent a few hours browsing the shops and stalls and found the prices very good and then had lunch . Great place to see a must do

,,Shop and eat!,4.0,,"Walking around Chinatown should be on your list of things to do in Singapore. It is quite touristy, but does offer a glimpse of Chinese culture. There are many temples to see - don't miss the Buddah Tooth Relic Temple. Loads of food options, and lots of shops and stalls selling trinkets and souvenirs. The MRT stops right here, so it is easily accessible."
,,See old China Town.........,5.0,,"Only a couple of streets left but gives you a great overview of how previous generations lived......be careful taking photos of the older residents. Some friends had water thrown over them from an upstairs window for taking a photo.
The old style shops are really interesting....the coffin maker, the paper maker of gifts of the ancestors etc.
An hour is enough time usually to visit China Town."
,,Nothing interesting apart Buddha Tooth temple,2.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is as artificial as all other Chinatowns around the world. The only thing really worth seeing is the Tooth Relic Temple, ideally during a ceremony."
,,As good as any China Town in the world,4.0,,"Hard to add much but obviously one of the top handful of things to do in Singers. Great range of restaurants (particularly Sichuan) and the pricing on tourist junk and trinkets is quite decent (much better than Phuket, for example)."
,,Little China in Singapore !,5.0,,"Singapore is famous for its modern architecture and high-rise buildings throughout the business district. And then, there is China Town. In stark contrast to the rest of the city, China Town is an authentic Chinese area of Singapore, with traditional style low-rise buildings, local temples, and streets bustling with locals and tourists alike.

China Town has a highly concentrated ethnic Chinese population, which means that when visitors and tourists walk through the streets, the sights, sounds, and smells are of an authentic Chinese experience. With small Chinese shop-fronts and traditional restaurants serving local and delicious cuisine, one can spend the entire day getting lost exploring the streets.

There are some Chinese, Buddhist as well as Hindu Temples to visit in China Town. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a magnificent four storey temple, built in the style of the Buddhist Mandala. The temple is a real spectacle of China Town, and many tourists flock to see the two-metre stupa, which is housed on the fourth floor.

The Sri Mariamman Temple is one of the oldest shrines of Singapore and is truly a marvelous site to behold. This shrine is still in daily use for Tamil Hindus in the country and is located on the corner of China Town’s South Bridge Road. You won’t want to miss this expansive temple with its ornate architecture and traditional design.

The highlight of any visit to China Town is undoubtedly the China Town street market located along Pagoda Street and the surrounding area. The street market contains hundreds of little stores, where you can find anything from silk scarves to bags, hats, and accessories. The street market can get busy, with thousands of tourists flocking to see both the local market produce, as well as the beautiful setting. With Chinese lanterns swaying above your head, the most beautiful time to visit the market is at dusk, while the sun sets gloriously behind you, and the shop owners try their best to get your attention, and perhaps lower their prices to make as much money as they can before the market closes.

There are also a few museums and galleries for you to visit in China Town, including the Red Dot Design Museum, which is a modern museum displaying the latest creative gadgets, and modern art design. There is also the Singapore City Gallery, which is a museum explaining how Singapore came to be, and how it grew and developed into the country as we know today.

Why not take a guided tour along the streets of China Town, where locals will show you the best spots to eat, drink and shop as well as explaining how China Town came to be. Walking along the streets of China Town presents many opportunities for you to see and do, with many great spots to take amazing photography of the local population, the buildings, shop fronts and temples. Chinatown in Singapore which is not to be missed!"
,,Ok for a quick visit.,3.0,,"Was ok & easy access from the tourist buses. Market stalls & Chinese restaurants, so as you would expect ! Quite a few good bargins the day we visited , items for 2-5 Singapore $ s ."
,,Walking through Chinatown,5.0,,"If you haven't been here before, you may need to take a tour. Chinatown is one of the most tourist spots in Singapore. It can be confusing a bit at first, but with technology on your side you'll never get lost. Use Google Maps, it's your best friend on traveling around there. I must of walked for miles. There is an over pass foot bridge that can take you to the People's Park plaza and there many local eat there food. Everything is a bit pricey compared to other nearby countries but well worth it if traveling with friends on foot, Uber, Grab or just the train. The food in Chinatown has an array of street style food from many countries. Definitely recommend it"
,,Where good shopping is,4.0,,"I have always loved Chinatown for its different sounds and flavor. THere are rows of souvenir items for sale that will always remind the traveler of his Singapore stay.
There is also a food street where your chinese cuisine cravings can be fulfilled.
It was raining when we visited but it did not stop us walking the whole length of Pagoda Street in search of good buys for family and friends back home."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"On of the 'must do' things on any city break, China Town is located centrally in Singapore and is on the 'hop on hop off' bus circuit. A nice walk around this part of Singapore, to see the Chinese shops and food stalls."
,,Interesting place,4.0,,"Okay, it's a tourist trap, but still. Fun to walk through and if you walk a bit further along you will see some more authentic areas."
,,Normal sort of Chinatown,4.0,,"It is nice to walk around, has markets and restaurants which are nice. Like most Chinatowns I suppose very similar to each other."
,,Bad practise,1.0,,"We have been coming to Singapore for twenty years for our annual holiday and visit Chinatown often for souvenirs and bargains.
Whilst it is still a great place to get bargains and an great shopping experience there seems to be a new practise of not pricing goods by certain shops and stalls. I think depending on how well off you look they invent prices.
Three examples of unmarked goods.
I enquired about a leather wallet that I knew was $10 elsewhere and was told it was $25.
One shop where I saw an unmarked kimono. When I asked about the price I was told $40. When I said that there was an identical kimono at another shop for $25. the charlatan said he would match the price I declined
Chinese slippers again not priced at another opportunist shop a lot dearer quote than identical slippers at priced shops.
Beware of this practise and stick to shops and stalls where goods are priced."
,,Bustling vibrant and exciting.,4.0,,As you would expect from Chinatown in Singapore this place is a bustling and exciting cauldron of experience. Shops stalls restaurants supermarkets everything. Make sure to visit.
,,Never ending market and festival,4.0,,"This place is incredible. It is never ending market full of shops and restaurants. It is place, which is very touristic but also very original. Great experience!"

,,Small but well formed😉,4.0,,"Good size, interesting Chinatown - better than New York and on a par with London! Quality gifts and not overly priced. Restaurants ok the further off the beaten track you go."
,,Trishaw terror,5.0,,"We did the Chinatown Trishaw night tour with tour guide Joicce. What a delightful night. We looked through the Buddhist Temple at the start then had a guided commentary of the origins of Chinatown. Then it was off to a restaurant for a 5 course dinner which was very nice amongst company from the UK, Canada and Australia. Then it was time to shop. Interesting sights throughout the markets and being a Saturday night, everyone was there. We were then loaded on to trishaws with a peddler who took us to Clarke Quay for a river cruise. Half way there on 4 lanes of traffic, a bus didn't see us and nearly crossed into our path. A very excited Chinese peddler soon had the bus in give way mode and we proceeded. Lots of laughs and very loud music. A great night of colour, sights and sounds."
,,Touristy,3.0,,"Not much there except eating (personal opinion). A lot of stalls selling low quality souvenirs. Had lunch at Smith street. Nice food. Not really cheap though. We were there at 11am. None of the stalls ready to serve. Had to wait until 12pm.

Food is definitely nice. Had BBQ stingray. Recommend!"

,,Must see,5.0,,"Big Chinatown, nice food, a lot of small markets. Need to see when you are in Singapore. Have time because there are a lot of small streets you need to go"
,,Great Architecture,3.0,,"I really like the fact that much of the original Chinatown architecture has survived, and looks better now than it did 30 years ago (better maintained). The place is very touristy now, shops sell goods at higher prices and the food is more expensive than elsewhere. I made the mistake of sitting down for a beer at one of those tables on the road and got slogged a fortune for a Tiger. Visit to look at the old buildings, not for shopping or eating (People's Park is just across the road for those!). People no longer live here, so it is quite different from the bustling local market of the 1980s and earlier with locals sitting at their doorways smoking, and tailless cats everywhere. The change is definitely for the better for the locals, but has left a rather touristy shopping precinct."
,,Replica of China..!,4.0,,"The Food over here in Chinatown is awesome and we can feel the cultural shift in this place which will be contrary to Singapore, Purchasing momentos is worth it over herein Chinatown.."
,,Cool heritage area,5.0,,As one of the must places to visit. Chinatown is nice which show the harmony between culture. You can see hindu temple in the district beside the buddha temple.

,,Excellent place for shopping and food,5.0,,I went to Chinatown few times and found this is a nice place to eat Chinese food along with lots of shopping which is really a bargain

,,Nice place,5.0,,Nice and cheap! You can have everything cheaper there. There is also a michelin star restaurant (hawker). Worth to try.
,,Review of Chinatown,4.0,,Located at China town MRT. Inhabited by majority of Chinese people. Has a large variety of food stalls as well as a shopping centre. The Chinatown area can be covered over foot in an hours time
,,Walk Through Chinatown,4.0,,What a lovely stroll we had through Chinatown even though it was wet. The stalls and shops were fascinating and had everything from getting a suit tailor made in a matter of hours to name prints and Chinese lanterns and the food was so varied you didn't really know what to go for first. The steamed breads looked delicious
,,Great atmosphere,5.0,,Went there just before the lunch rush hour. Had lunch in n open air restaurant and spent about 2 hours there watching the world go by. Was great way to kill a few hours.
,,Ms,5.0,,A good place to buy souvenirs to bring home. It's all very cheap and looks good. You can practically get all kinds of things there and inexpensive. Touristic area to go. There are also ocal food streets for your meals. But very hot in the day. Must go place for tourists.
,,CHINATOWN SINGAPORE,5.0,,"My wife and me visited China town in May 2017 and enjoyed the diversity of food and the many attractions.
We went there especially for Chinese food and we were not disappointed.
Especially the cold Tiger beer.
Will always be a must when we visit Singapore again."
,,Love the Bargain!,3.0,,"The man at the last stall we went to was friendly and accommodating. He gave us a good price for the stuff that we bought! As we bought a lot from him: tee-shirts and fridge magnet souvenirs, he gave us extras too for free!
The only downside was when it was time to have dinner: we sat at one of the tables along the sides of the streets where market stalls and food stands were also positioned. Then, while still sitting and wondering from which food stalls to buy food from, someone approached us and gave my husband and I a menu. And so we ordered and started to relax while we wait for our meal. But then, the man told us that we were not allowed to eat at that table. He summoned us to stand up and directed us to the table setting just outside the door of a nearby restaurant. We just followed as we were so trusting. He served us from that restaurant; but the fried rice and noodles were a a small small serves, and my fave eggplant claypot was scant and served in a small but shallow platter! Time for payment came: $45 plus! Had to comfort my husband as he was quite shocked and upset! Obviously, we paid for tax and service fees! The food was not even worth it! I think it is best to ask first: ""Do you charge tax and service fees?"" Well, we were ignorant and are used to the large serves in Australia! Best to charge it to experience... I am writing this to make people aware, and not to just part with your precious dollars."
,,Vacation,5.0,,"Singapore China Town , it is a great way to understand Singapore and the city. There are abundance of souvenirs stores and restaurants with an authentic food, but I really recommend to try the the hawker center in the middle of the Chinatown. I think it's the best hawker center (it may not be the pretties or nicest) but in my opinion they have the best local food."
,,Chinese museum,5.0,,The Chinese museum in Chinatown us well worth a visit. It documents how life developed in Singapore for Chinese people
,,Bustling and active,5.0,,"One of many attractive places in the wonderful city of Singapore. Loads to see including memorabilia, cloth wares, spices, and crafts. Also had my self portrait done in about 2 - 5 minutes (can't remember clearly but I wasn't to pay if time was exceeded).
A must try while here is the massive all you can eat bucket
of crab in red curry chilli. Simply amazing and it comes with complementary local beverage.
Loads of fun and things to engage in. Accessible by underground train like everywhere in Singapore, best to have your monthly train&bus pass all the way from day one."
,,Crowded but fun,4.0,,Like many Chinatowns in tourist cities this venue is crowded with hundreds of small shops and food stalls. Unlike some the Singapore version is relatively clean.
,,Colorful,4.0,,Loved the shophouses and other buildings. Lots of color and life. Walk past the tourist restaurants and head to Maxwell food center for a meal
,,Always can't wait for the Food Street,5.0,,"Chinatown Food Street is a must! You should try char-sew or duck rice (is the writing ok? sorryy) I mean, they sell very yummy foods in Singapore (IMHO)"
,,Really unusual place towered by the skyscrapers,5.0,,Really enjoyed seeing the authentic China town which was bustling with local stall and small restaurants. As with most places like this there is the tacky side but if you can put that aside you will love this place with all the pretty lanterns and smells. Well worth a visit.
,,Average Place,3.0,,bought T-shirt from here.. Good with qaulity. had been here only for 15 20 min so not much to talk on it.

,,Bustling spot with loads to experience!,5.0,,"We stayed in Chinatown in a great, reasonable hotel (Hotel Mono). The location was excellent, so near to everything. Chinatown is full to the brim with restaurants, stalls, shops and history! Consider taking the Indie Singapore free walking tour to get all of the historical background.

,,A nice place to visit but a bit comercialized,3.0,,"I am not big fan of the place but it is worth seeing. It has become commercialized with a lot of junk for sale and below average restaurants that cater to tourists. If you want to eat inexpensively but well, go where the locals eat at the Maxwell Hawker Center in China Town. Its authentic and reasonable."
,,Hot and crowded,3.0,,"Merchants practically twist your arm to buy something. Hot and crowded, couldn't get away fast enough."
,,Chinatown,3.0,,"Great selection of places to eat from yum Cha to burgers and beers. In regards to the market, it is like many other markets around the world with most stalks selling similar lines. Some silk stores are great for selections but the fun side is chatting and making a deal. Hawkers stalls are great value for a quick bite."
,,Tourist Friendly,4.0,,"Visited Chinatown a couple of times during our visit to Singapore, and thought it was excellent for shopping and eating out.

In the evening, the streets are awash with shops and stalls selling Chinese themed souvenirs, electronic and camera equipment and assorted bric a brac. There's also a number of restaurants offering Chinese meals, which might be a bit pricier than a local would expect to pay but still offered good value and good quality food to me.

The area is definitely designed to serve tourists rather than locals but a visit makes for a very enjoyable evening, so I'd highly recommend."
,,"Portrays the culture, architecture and food of China",4.0,,The souvenirs are affordable and a large selection of goods are available- ranging from herbs and Chinese medicine to seafood and Chinese culture goods such as lanterns and key-chains. Highly recommend the streets of Chinatown if you want to immerse yourself or get a feel of Chinese culture and food. The food street is amazing.
,,Cheap and delish eats,4.0,,Head here if you want cheap and delicious eats from the street vendors. My partner and I ate here quite a few nights and found the prices to be about a third to everywhere else in Singapore. Safe to eat too :)
,,All in one with wide-range of choices,4.0,,"We stay in the hotel on Mosque street so very close to this and we could enjoy good foods with pricing from low to high, mostly Chinese. All the souvenirs are very cheap. The most Chinese place in Singapore."
,,Old times in recent style,3.0,,"Good for food lovers also, and more exciting when comes at night. Easy to get and you can find many chinese medicine also."
,,Chinatown-Singapore,4.0,,Filled with locals but mainly tourists who are attracted to many shops/stalls offering similar goods. Prices are reasonable.
,,the cleanest chinatown ever,5.0,,"I use to visit in many places Chinatown and for sure , Chinatown in Singapore is the most cleanest ever. Busy but everything under control. In the same zone you will find a mosque, a indu temple and a great budist temple. Lovely place to spent some time."
,,Chinatown as common all over,3.0,,Though chinatown is colorful but not so clean. One can visit this place for buying soveniors and food. This is like chinatown as in other countries.
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,"this is just a great spot to go visit. Lots of outdoor market areas, boutique stores, kischy souvenier stands and even an outdoor stage where they were doing country line dancing. This will be one of the first places to head to when we go back."
,,interessting,4.0,,"Interessting place, but little bit dirty. There are many restaurants with delicious asian food. Many temples around."
,,Standard Chinatown Experience,3.0,,"Over 75% of Singapores population is of Chinese decent, so it isn’t surprising that they have a sizeable Chinatown. You can access Chinatown on the MRT, existing at Chinatown station. The elements are the same as in any Chinatown – lots of budget restaurants (including the now famous Hong Kong Chicken and Noodle – the world’s first 1 star Michelin restaurant), cheap souvenir stores and a couple of temples (namely the Buddha tooth relic temple and the Sri Mariamman temple). My partner and I found this a decent place to spend a couple of hours and get some decent Chinese food but there was nothing particularly unique or exceptional about it."
,,Like China Towns the World Over,3.0,,"We were taken by taxi to this place. The whole point of the taxi driver was to get us to buy from a stall that ne of his fiends or relatives owned. The atmosphere was the same as all Chinese Markets, which sadly is 'not our thing', though I guess many people would enjoy the experience."
,,Great bargains,5.0,,It was our first time in Singapore and found Chinatown very interesting. In fact we went back twice. They had great bargains. Souvenirs at a very good price.
,,Affordable place to shop and dine,5.0,,"You can see authentic Chinese food, Herbal medicines and a haven for very affordable souvenir and gift items. I bought there my souvenir item and key chains. Its cheaper than anywhere else in SG. Plus i bought a very unique skort for 10sgd. A must visit place."
,,Best place to do Souvenir shopping!,5.0,,"I have been all over Singapore, but Chinatown offers the cheapest deals when it comes to souvenirs. Not to mention that it is so easy to go to, right when you come up underground, you would see the shophouses right away..Clean and beautiful too!"
,,Sight seeing.,4.0,,"Could spend a day browsing through the stores & historic buildings. Plenty of eating places to have a beer , coffee or something to eat."
,,only cheap souveniers here,3.0,,This place can be avoided to go. there are only some shops selling very cheap souvenirs which are available everywhere.
,,Always a good walk!,4.0,,"China Town in Singapore is always good for food, shopping and just seeing something traditional. Lunch outside is great and people are always interesting"
,,nice to visit,4.0,,"Early in morning we visited this neighbourhood.In 1990 I worked in Singapore...Those houses were neglected ,trees growing out of walls...it is nice to see how the buildings are retired (as well the other neighbourhoods).The shops are about all the same, you can find some good souvenirs (brought nice chinese brushes, but bargain a lot).Visit the temple !!"
,,China Town,3.0,,No matter which country you are visiting one place you will always find there that is Chinatown. Busy street where you can buy souvenirs and try street food. Beware of fake products
,,Great Chinatown,5.0,,Cleanest Chinatown I have ever seen . Love love Singapore. We took the train which is very convenient and walked around . Very safe and great place to pick up gifts .
,,A,4.0,,"Chinatown is a bargain-hunter's paradise. There are so many retailed items that are affordable, unique and fascinating. I never knew that there were products such as durian chocolates and durian coffee. Well, Chinatown had it.

The food in the stall is delectable that you just want to stay for more! The stores are located side-by-side so it's easy to move around and go through different merchandises. There is order in the chaos. Enjoyed the place."
,,Good for an afternoon but do your research first,5.0,,"We arrived via the MRT in China town, and unfortunately we had not done the required research to help us find the places we wanted to visit. We were trying to find the one michelin star restaurant which was proving to be difficult. Luckily we stumbled across it and had a nice lunch. Good for a general wander around, plenty of places to buy good quality chopsticks."
,,Neat to walk through,4.0,,"If you're looking for a neat place to walk around, this area has some interesting sights and lots of food. We had limited time in Singapore, and the group wanted to check it out. We used the hop-on-hop-off bus, which offered a couple of stops to access Chinatown."
,,Another China Town,3.0,,"Yep, loads of cheap eats, massages parlors and gifts. Crowded streets and pushy people offer a standard Chinese experience."
,,Cheap place for souvenir,5.0,,"What I like about Chinatown is one complex with a lot of tourists destinations. Here you can go to Budhist Temple, there is also Hindus temple very near, street market and coffee shops.
For me this is a must visit destination if I go to Singapore. Another thing that I like is in the restaurant the seller will tell you of their foods halal or not."
,,Way different than a US Chinatown,5.0,,"The Dim Sum at Yum Cha was as good as any I've had anywhere. The covered, but outdoors food courts were awesome. Souvenir stores were plentiful with stuff I don't see in the states. I wash I had time to see and eat a lot more."
,,"Nice little town, touristic",3.0,,"Its cool, but too much plastic cheap tourist mementos. Would much prefer Tiong bahru to this. GO see the tooth relic temple!"
,,One of the icons of Singapore,5.0,,"Modern architecture is what you mostly see when seeing images of Singapore, however, Chinatown is probably the most vibrant part of town. This little quarter is buzzing day and night with shops and restaurants being open (almost) around the clock. I have lived there for nearly 4 years and it was one of the best times I had. There is always something going on, plenty of options for food and drinks, from cheap food stalls to exclusive restaurants and rooftop bars you can literally find anything here. This is one of my favorite parts of town."
,,Chintatown Singapore,3.0,,As I live outside Vancouver and we really have quite a large Chinatown was not overly impressed with this one. Did stop at a small self-serve eatery that was quite good and rather inexpensive.
,,"Very ""Chinese"" to me",5.0,,"The Chinatown here has retained a lot of the Chinese culture characteristics and has more ""chineseness"" to me compared other Chinatowns that I have been. The food street has so much choices to choose from and you can order dishes from different food stall. I came here to have food twice. Definitely worth coming for authentic Chinese food and culture."
,,Shopping,5.0,,If you go to China Town I found that nearer you went to the temple. The cheaper things were. Brought a lovely picture that was done on silk
,,Nice place for a short time,4.0,,Very small place beautiful place high prices I think an hour and a half is enough for the Chinese market

,,Nice Chinatown,4.0,,"Like many other Chinatowns around the world, only a bit cleaner. Not the pushy vendors you might see elsewhere, clean and pleasant experience."
,,A must visit place,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, Chinatown is one of the most iconic places. The little streets are lined with shops and places to eat. There are lots of tourists here but that is to be expected. It does get extremely hot during midday so I would recommend you bring either an umbrella or hat to shield you from the sun.

The big Buddha temple is right here and it is also worth a visit. I loved Chinatown so much I went back multiple different times during my stay in Singapore."
,,"A great place to sightsee, people watch and enjoy a meal and drink.",5.0,,Chinatown is filled with tourist shops and lots of street side cafes where you can order a reasonably priced meal and watch the world (people from all over the world) go by. Unfortunately alcohol drinks are a bit expensive for my budget by i did enjoy a couple of Singapore brand beers without breaking my budget.
,,Nice,3.0,,Nice stroll through markets and stalls with bargains. Nice food court just outside the market if you get hungry

,,Perfect for souvenirs and bargains,4.0,,"Singapore's own Chinatown is a real treat. of course the most discerning of travelers may find their souvenirs in adorable little specialty shops in whatever part of town they stay in.

,,Chinese extreme bitter black tea,5.0,,"In SG, we find a very bitter black tea named 24-medical herb tea.
You will find this tea bottle both Takashimaya department store and Chinatown tea shop.
Very bitter and hard to drink without chaser drink or sweets!
But this tea is good for detox and anti-aging, so we recommend all of you to try this extreme bitter black tea. We also buy tea leaf and after go back to Japan we try to extract,but we cannot make same-taste bitter tea. Please give us information about home-made bitter tea,thanks!"
,,Three Nights and Days Hanging out in China Town and China Point!,4.0,,"Spent a lot of time day and night in China Town and at China Point. My wife and I enjoyed all our meals in these two areas. Very reasonably priced and delicious, with so many places to eat. The area is very convenient, with train access in two close locations. Used Uber several times from China Point, very inexpensive. EnJoY!"

,,Always crowded,5.0,,"Always crowded if you with old people pls note it will be a lot of walking thru min streets if u are here dont miss the pagoda street, food around the shops here are over priced and not tasty. Walk 15mins away from here to maxwell or laupasat dor much beter food choices ask anyone they will show u the way or check on google maps. Filed with alot of shops that sell souvenirs at cheap price another similar place like this would be the bugis street at bugis."
,,Great fun,5.0,,"Really enjoyed wandering through Chinatown and getting thoroughly lost. So many great places to eat and lots of markets to enjoy.

We went in and out of the area many times over 3 days and still only felt like we'd touched on it. Highly recommend - it's a wonderful place to wander."
,,China town,5.0,,Great palace to shop and eat .Yum Cha restaurant hidden up a shop's internal stair case is a must do if you can find it .Central location for booked excursions
,,Going down to Chinatown,5.0,,"We always love visiting China town in the various cities we visit, what makes this one so user friendly is that English is so widely used! Eating crocodile from a street restaurant was real fun!"
,,Noisy and crowded,3.0,,People are everywhere. Souvenir shops are everywhere. Probably I prefer a tranquil context that I do not have a good impression about this place.
,,Interesting reminder of the past Chinese culture,4.0,,"Restaurants offer a tantalising range of Asian foods - we tried the Soy chicken and rice - it was cheap, delicious and like my grandmas. My husband tries the chilli crab and pepper crab - messy and delicious but I was told it was much more expensive as it is a tourist area."
,,"Busy, Busy, Busy",3.0,,Grat place for a bargain (well if you think it is) full of Asian snacks and the little gismos China is famous for

,,Walk through,5.0,,Get off the beaten path to experience the smells and tastes of Singapore. You can even get Musang King Durian in the market. The Peking Duck is worth the heat.
,,Theme Market!,4.0,,"Like Little India and Arab Street, there is China Town. It is a marketplace. You can do shopping and try chinese food here, which I love."
,,Chinatown a place that you can feel the Chinese here,5.0,,"Last time, Chinatown is full of elderly, now, Chinatown starting attracted younger people here. Tourist will come to this Chinatown to enjoy the different feel of Singapore. You may go to the massage and spa shop at People's Park Centre if you walk till tired. You can try many different yummy foods along the Chinatown. You may buy many different Chinese arts stuff at Pagoda and Smith Street. Chinatown, you must come if you come to Singapore."
,,Foodie must do,5.0,,The shopping was good. The locals are very friendly. The street food carts were incredible. We were spoilt for choice so sampled a few plates from different carts. Loved the place.

,,Where the name speaks for itself....,5.0,,"Every tourists will want to visit this ChinaTown as they will see the shops, take pictures, go for the food and the ambiance of the place.

,,Hip and clean,4.0,,Eaterys abound and loads of cheap souvenir type goods. Close to the metro and Chinatown Heritage Center.
,,Avoid at all costs,2.0,,"What a horrible place. The markets very terrible and so untidy. God knows how much bacteria and germs are in this place.

The food stalls looked like the meat was a month old, there were insects all over.

The only plus point was the postcards were cheap at 40 cents."
,,Singapore 5 day visit,5.0,,"Narrow streets, a real stall and small shop area selling just about anything, lives up to its name, a great place, MUST haggle. Several Money Changers giving better rates than banks but it must be cash for cash, no cards."
,,Was a bit of fun,4.0,,"This place is spectacular at night. It is full of cheap tacky stuff but was fun. We ended up shopping for a couple of hours and found some good food too.
Probably one of the cheaper places for a cold beer too.
Worth the visit for anyone happy to slowly wander and just take in the site."
,,Food and markets!,4.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is one of the older area in town, and a fabulous place for souvenirs, or a great feed with the main food street under cover for all weather dining. There are wonderful shophouses to wander past - the old architecture evoking at time gone by. A visit to the Buddha Tooth Temple a must...treat yourself and journey up to the top floor where there is a lovely garden and huge prayer wheel - it's a great escape from the mad busy city!"
,,Authentic Chinese food,5.0,,"If you enjoy Chinese food then China Town in Singapore is about the best most authentic place to enjoy it , whether you want an economy meal or a five star treat this is the place to explore and to eat. Night time is by far the best, as the early evening moves later the tourists become abundant and the area thrives,"
,,"Lots of cheap market stalls, great hawker stalls and history",5.0,,"Chinatown is a must visit part of Singapore. The streets are littered with cheap vendors and pound stores that offer cheap souvenirs. Make sure you negotiate with the locals and never buy from the first place you visit.

Additionally, there are several excellent hawker stalls, including hawker chan, that have won michelen star awards. It's an extremely cheap and satisfying day out."
,,A glimpse of old Singapore and Chinese culture,4.0,,"Chinatown had changed over time. While it was nestled in a conservation area comprising of Telok Ayer, Bukit Pasoh, Tanjong Pagar, Kreta Ayer and Ann Siang Hill, most of old shops and trades have disappeared.

What remained of this historic part of Singapore were the heritage shophouses (most looking new) and some traditional pastry shops, gold smiths, medicinal halls and a roasted chestnut stall.

Most of the shophouse venues are souvenir shops, pubs, cafes and boutiques. Even the food street has been modernized and made more comfortable.

It is still an interesting place to visit during festive periods especially the Lunar New Year and Mid Autumn Festival."
,,A good place to buy cheap gifting products and so,4.0,,China town is one good place to buy souvenirs and gifting products for a cheap price. One can also enjoy tasty Chinese food out here.
,,Chinatown Singapore,5.0,,"Well worth a couple of hours wandering around. Very clean. A chance to pick up some souvenirs and gifts, and to eat great food at good prices. Some bargains to be had . They are about to renovate this area so should be even better when it's done."
,,food,5.0,,3 days in singapore and we ate at china town every day the food was prepared in a very clean envirioment and even the places wer full there was always someone for make room for us to sit and eat our meal
,,"No excuses, this is a must do...",5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is quite small, but there is plenty to see and do. From shops and stalls selling everything imaginable, to the most amazing food, Chinatown is a wonderful place to visit. I can walk around there for hours taking in the sights, sounds and smells.

The hawker stalls on Smith Street are great to just grab a bite as you pass by, but the restaurants that are a little further from the centre are best if you want a meal. You can get amazing food in huge quantities for very little money.

Be prepared to spend time here. Explore the area, have something to eat, get a nice cold Chinese beer and finish with a relaxing Chinese foot massage before heading back to your hotel.

I go to Chinatown every time I visit Singapore."
,,Perfect Chinese New Year Expereience,5.0,,Thoroughly enjoyed visiting China Town when I was in Singapore a few months ago. Lost of culture and opportunity to eat some great authentic Chinese food.

,,GREAT FOOD AND SHOPPING.,4.0,,"The street stalls are great for souvenirs, silk caftans etc, but the real bargains are to be had in the three shopping plazas. Visit Og, the big store with great fashions, colourful Cheong Sams and a good bag department too."
,,Not the best Chinatown I have been to,3.0,,This is now just a tourist attraction really and has very little authentic character. It did not really impress us.
,,One of the top ten attractions in Singapore.,5.0,,"Chinatown stands in contrast to the rest of the city. The culture bursts out onto the streets, from the fragrant smells of traditional cuisine to the bold red and gold tones that run through the neighbourhood. This is an area that’s proud of its heritage, and has it very much on display. There are ornate Chinese, Buddhist and Hindu temples, museums galore and plenty of opportunities to soak up the bustling streets and stop and enjoy the local cuisine. As you would expect there are also plenty of opportunities to shop and pick up some souvenirs."
,,Not very clean like Singapore,2.0,,China town is neither a cheap place nor very clean one. You wont wont even find some exotic restaurants here. Better to visit orchard road or clarke quay for good food or just to hangout.
,,bustling part of the city,4.0,,I had the pleasure of visiting this part of the town a couple of times for business. But it turned out far more than just a business visit. The food and the local crowd was great. I had a nice time walking around chinatown and did some shopping too.
,,"God, it was hot!!",5.0,,"Had a walk round mid to late morning and it certainly is a must see place. Had lunch at one of the restaurants and have to say, it was one of the best I have had - shame I can't remember it's name, but it was on a corner and had 2 massive framed sharks fins on the wall..... sorry!!"
,,a mere shadow of the past,2.0,,"sorry, but chinatown should not be bright, clean tidy and uniform. it should be a vibrant, bustling, slightly mysterious and slightly edgy place. another part of singapore which has been modernised out of all recognition to the way it once was. worth a visit, but don't expect too much."
,,Best place to buy souveneirs,4.0,,"Go and do your shopping in Chinatown, there is everything you could imagine for your friends back home, from chopsticks to trinkets. The food stalls/shops are cheap but very good and tasty, would personally recommend the shop called Singapore Seafood, great food and cold tiger beer, but all the other places are just as good i just like that one :)"
,,Center of Singapore,5.0,,"My wife and I had an apartment here and it is the best option as everything is near but the price is not high. Moreover, you can find cheap and good food (approx. 5 USD), a lot of people and many options where to go"
,,Good place to eat and shop souvenirs,4.0,,"Lots of restaurants to choose from, some famous places among them, including chicken rice. Got lots of small souvenir shops too. I like the ones where you buy a stone and they engrave it for you and make it a necklace. I made the Laputa floating stone from Castle of the Sky!"
,,"So many foods, too little time to eat 😂",4.0,,"So many things to enjoy here!
I enjoyed my lunch with affordable price & nice taste. #chinesefoodlovers
I enjoyed the view & the building design, so Asian.
Many souvenir stalls & we can bargain. You can have your Western name written in Chinese character (hanzi). So unique!"
,,Lovely area,4.0,,Walkable from our hotel so it was in a great position for us. Lovely stalls and food available on the streets
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,The week before Chinese New Year. The crowds were enormous. It was a squeeze to walk anywhere. But great atmosphere. The best thing was being able to get a table at the corner seafood place and have a beer with the meal.
,,Great tourist attraction,5.0,,Browse the street front shops for great shopping and lots of interesting restaurants. Lots of souvenirs and gadgets. Just loads of fun and some great bargains.
,,looks like a movie set,2.0,,We were expecting the real chinatown. This whole experience here is so well managed that it losses it authenticity. I guess the real chinatown is probably in china. Most of the shops sell the same stuff that you can get elewhere.
,,Tuck in ! 🍜,5.0,,Best and cheapest food on the island ! We went back twice 😋 The roast meats are amazeballs as well as the fresh fruit drinks made to order
,,Must see...,5.0,,Interesting place to wander through...Some interesting shopping....Go down stairs for cheep supermarkets ..Always felt safe in Singapore...

,,Shopping experince,4.0,,"Where you can buy anything you want such as gifts to your family. Good electronic products, Specially Chaines food."
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,"We had dinner in Singapore's Chinatown and walked around the markets during the evening.

,,Plenty to see and do in Chinatown,4.0,,Chinatown is clean and tidy with a variety of interesting shops. We tried a foot spa which was great fun. The Maxwell Food Centre is also in Chinatown if you fancy trying out a Hawker market.
,,Pleasant,2.0,,Area was pleasant but has become very touristy and selling lots of cheap souvenirs. Would not go out of my way to see. Some interesting architecture
,,Great food and culture,4.0,,Great to get out of sanitised Singapore and join in with the locals. Great inexpensive food options topped off with shopping.
,,Great Food,4.0,,"Great both during the day looking at the Temples, market stalls,shops etc but also comes to life at night. We ate at the Hawker stall great food and cheap with a great variety."
,,Average,3.0,,"Unlike Chinatowns in Western countries, Chinatown in Singapore is not THE place to go to for a local Chinese experience. The best Chinese cuisines in Singapore are located elsewhere. If you're a foreigner I recommend making some local friends to guide you.

Chinatown in Singapore was named such because that's where the British colonists decided the early migrants from China should stay. Hence it has some historical value, but today it's just a touristy spot for commercial purposes."
,,Nice,4.0,,"Lots of different shops and eating places, nice massages as well. Quite a large area as well to explore"
,,General,4.0,,"We are staying in Chinatown, we found it very convenient. The train station is so close that we found it easy & affordable to explore. So many restaurants to select from. The markets are great, open quite late also. We found most of the places we wanted to explore were close to Chinatown."
,,Worth the experience.,4.0,,We went to experience the hussel and bushel of tourists. Had a nice meal but experience no different from any other Chinatown. Can pick up usual tourist thickets if you want.
,,Clean and lots of souvenir shopping,4.0,,"Chinatown was the last place my husband and I visited during our transit in Singapore, we had our dinner there, overall the food was satisfied but just beware that you might need to pay a slightly higher price since this is a well-known tourist spot.

However, if you are looking for souvenirs to shop as gift to your friends and loved ones, this is definitely a good place you should visit since we find a lot of stalls and the price are quite competitive, you will definitely get a good price without bargaining even."
,,Fab to walk around and soak up the sights,5.0,,"Great to pass through, loved the lanterns hanging in the streets, enjoyed going in a few of the shops (a lot the same) selling all their bits, visited the temple which was brilliant and well worth a visit to and sat outside and had a drink. Spent much longer here than in other quarters. Though also enjoyed Clarke Quay for a wander and bite to eat."
,,A Chinatown where the mainland China Chinese gather,4.0,,"Singapore is a country with 70% Chinese population and yet ironically there is a Chinatown in this part of Singapore. I will say you will see a lot of Chinese in almost all places in Singapore maybe except little india. So rightfully, all places in Singapore are chinatown.

Over the years, this chinatown has been dominated by mainland China Chinese. Many China Chinese workers gather here in Chinatown for their hometown food and drinks. Food in this Chinatown are mostly China Chinese food. It is not really true Singapore Chinese food. The China Chinese food are also very tasty and unique, but for tourists please do not take it as a true local food. True Singapore cuisine is a mix of Chinese, Malay and Indian food cooking.

Chinatown is a place to shop for cheap local souvenirs although most of it are made in China. There are also few traditional local confectionary and shops that you can only find here. Best period to visit here is 1-2 weeks before Chinese New Year or near lantern festival. Chinatown will be decorated with lanterns and lights."
,,Small,3.0,,"Great temple. Nice food market down the centre and a large market. Very busy on a Sunday, especially around food courts"
,,Ok for an hour or so,3.0,,"We had a wander around Chinatown, it wasn't the right time to eat but there were plenty of choices if you were hungry. The market style stalls were ok but all a bit much the same after a while."
,,"Not a must see, but have a stroll if you are passing by",3.0,,"The main attractions here are a couple of temples and the food street, which has a lively atmosphere in the evening. Other than that there isn't much to do."
,,Small interesting shops,4.0,,"The place is open til 10pm. Many small stores where you can get a good deal. Good food. Go to Me Heong Yuen for dessert. It'll cool you down on a warm, muggy night."
,,Too commercialized,4.0,,"This use to be a great place to visit but I think with increasing rents and tourist not as many, prices in the area I feel prices have gone up considerably and there seem to be no atmosphere that the area was known for and too many loud, pushy stall owners."
,,A must visit,4.0,,"If you go late afternoon it gives you time to look at the history of Chinatown before settling down to some local food.

The restaurants and food stall along the normal tourist roads will give you what you need but if you go to the shopping centre to the north of the main road there are hawker stalls where predominantly Chinese people are eating and this will give you the best experience."
,,An interesting area to visit in Singapore,4.0,,"There are a lot of stalls to visit in Chinatown offering a wide variety of goods for sale. We only had about one hour in the area as part of a cruise ship shore excursion, so did not have time to explore properly, but definitely enjoyed what we saw"
,,Nice to go once,2.0,,"1 - easy to find and accessible

2 - don't but souvenirs at the entrance, walk deeper in the lane for better finds

3 - lots of products made in China and Indonesia, appropriate for souvenir shopping but it's not Very cheap

4 - there were a few really nice items if you go inside the store as well

5 - the money changer that we went to had really bad rates, do compare to others before buying ur SGD

6 - go in the afternoon so it's not so hot"
,,Interesting place for shopping and eating,4.0,,We went fairly early in the morning to look for somewhere to have breakfast but a lot of the food stalls were not ready for business but some restaurants were. We spotted a little lady holding the menu up to everyone who walked past so we decided to go there. We shared 12 spring rolls which were delicious and all the other food people were eating looked good . Dont recall the name of the restaurant but was in the Eats Street. After that we wandered around the markets and purchased a few things . Do have some upmarket stalls especially jade and jewellery.
,,Good for a quick visit,3.0,,"We were in and out of Chinatown in about an hour. It's pretty much a tourist trap with most shops selling similar items. The saving graces was the stall with small paintings. They were well done and a genuine souvenir. We bought three and they cost about $120, but worth it compared to the cheap crap. We had lunch here too and the food, pretty much as always in Singapore, was good and tasty. I would have liked to visit nearby temples but the heat got the better of us this day.
Taxis are plentiful and there is a taxi rank smack bang in the middle."
,,A mixture of experiences,4.0,,"Visited here one morning, a variety of souvenir and gift shops. A great choice of restaurants, and food stalls, temples to see, if time had allowed we could have stayed all day."
,,Can be boring without Chinese New Year Deco,3.0,,Come here for the food and there is really nothing else after that. Guess the place only comes alive during Chinese New Year. Nothing much but at least you do not have to wait that long for your food.
,,Nice place to hang out,5.0,,This is superb place to hang out within the your budget...Place have some awesome food options and great Chinese things to purchase
,,Shop in chinatown,5.0,,"If you are looking to shop and eat local food, head to Chinatown. I went just before the Chinese NY and got a lovely glimpse of the festivities of the NY."
,,Eat with the locals here cheaply,4.0,,"Take the MRT to Chinatown, wander along the streets with stalls selling silk dressing gowns for ten dollars, go to People's Park Centre for lunch and a wander round local shops"
,,Good value,4.0,,"We had wanted to eat in Queen Vic market but it was just too crowded, so came to China Town instead. Called in the first restaurant with duck hanging in the window! Got seated and served very quickly and I think it was the cheapest meal we had on our Australian holiday - less than $20 for the two of us for quite a banquet!"
,,A very nice Chinatown,4.0,,"The area is very well maintained, thus buildings look nice and all is clean. This is perhaps a bit different from Chinatowns in KL and Bangkok. We had lunch also at the huge variety of restaurants, which was great. A nice and recommendable experience."
,,Like any other,3.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is the same as any Chinatown in any other city. Plenty of shops, plenty of places for food."
,,Another China town,4.0,,"In almost all bigger cities is an area called China town. They all look a little bit the same, so if you have seen a few, it gets normal. That said, it is always a kind of fun to see how they live, work, manage their daily life."
,,Everything Chinese,4.0,,A must visit for any tourist to Singapore. Many small shops selling all sorts of souvenirs. Many dining options. Easy access with MRT.
,,A hustle and bustle of heritage and life,5.0,,"Chinatown is quite popular with tourist and is specially busy during Chunese New Year. It sells lots of souvineirs, food and titbits. It also has a heritage museum so be sure to check that out if you are interested in the interesting history of Chinatown. I recommend it to all tourists and it is suitable for the young and old. Don't worry about your budget, the things there are fairly cheap!"
,,Other places are a better use of your time,2.0,,"We went to Chinatown first ... after seeing other things I wish we had skipped it. The food is cheap so if you want inexpensive food give it a go, otherwise it feels cheap and not as beautiful as other attractions."
,,Always awesome time in Chinatown,4.0,,"Chinatown is definitely a must visit if you go to Singapore.

There are so much things you can do in Chinatown!!

There are three must go temples to visit in chinatown, all worth your time to visit:
Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, a larger size of a Buddhist temple.
Tian Hock Keng Temple, a smaller Chinese temple, with amazing chinese architecture.
Sri Mariamman Temple, a Hindu temple. It is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore. Extensive with Hindu deities in and around the building itself.

Shopping here is fun!! Bargain is the name of your game. If you don't bargain, its not fun...
It is a never ending bargain shopping from Chinatown Complex through People's Park Centre. Whatever you want to get, you can find it in Chinatown. From pro DSLR camera to a souvenir keychain is available.

Now, talking about dining option here...it is going to be tough. Tough, not because difficult to find a good one, but though because too many good one to choose. From the hawker centres to the swanky restaurants, Michelin Bib Gourmand hawker stall to The Blue Ginger restaurant are there for you.
Basically, pretty much anything you pick will not dissapoint.
If you opt for hawker centre, rule of thumb is just watch the locals lined up, that is the stall to go!!
Place to start to look: Chinatown Complex, Chinatown Food Street, or People's Park Centre.

Explore, and enjoy this awesome ares!@"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"We visited with not to high expect ion and got pleasantly surprised. Area is nice and the style of the area is very much different to the Singapore of huge buildings. Many shops in the area and also a food street, but all looks very much organised and not really typical Chinese street style ;)
Can recommend to everyone to spend some time there"
,,Worthy Of A Few Hours Of Your Time,4.0,,"A very pleasant part of town. Spend a couple of hours here wandering up & down the aisles of the market stalls. Most of the stalls sell the same thing for the same prices, so no point trying to haggle as there must be an understanding between all the stalll holders not to lower prices. Unlike lots of other places where haggling is encouraged, it isn't here & they seem quite offended when you try to."
,,Enjoyable,5.0,,"We really enjoy visiting China Town every time we visit Singapore. It is easy to get there and the shop keepers are very helpful and friendly. We picked up some great bargains and souvenirs when we visited this time. Also found a great restaurant where we had lunch on two occasions. Will definitely visit again.
John & Gail Laney"
,,Hawker Centre Great Food,5.0,,"This place is so cheap to eat $5 for a meal which seems impossible in Singapore! After eating our lunch here we bought another meal to takeaway to eat at the airport later that day! $5 for a 1 michellin star establishment, this place looks like a cheap café but do not let that put you off"
,,easy to access and great to visit,4.0,,"Singapore is very easy to get around and very safe - good buses very cheap and punctual - little China great to wander round - fabulous temple, good market and very good side streets to get authentic feel - highly recommended"
,,One Visit is Not Enough,5.0,,We went twice to ChinaTown during our latest visit to Singapore. Once was not enough as there are so many places and shops to check out. Great place to pick up souvenirs and gifts. Shop keepers are polite and friendly. It is a good walk but take a brolly in case it rains. Variety of goods on offer is huge. There are also eateries: we were not disappointed.
,,"Souvenir, Food , Heritage, all in one place",4.0,,"Everytime I visit Singapore, I always spent time here.. Easy to get there.. We can find a lot of souvenirs , many nice restaurants, or just sitting watching the crowd."
,,From potions to religious beliefs,5.0,,There were numerous shops selling potions for every conceivable ailment. Markets were selling a variety of goods and food and the atmosphere was incredible. There were temples adorned with ancient images and one temple had a religious icon made in gold from offerings by the visiting public which weighed in excess of 100kg. A religious ceremony was taking plcae in the lower levels if the temple and this was quite a moving spectacle
,,A must visit in Singapore,4.0,,"Here you can learn the history of the Peranakan Chinese in Singapore, eat some famous chicken rice, and poke around all of the fabulous little shops, many featuring items with the intricate beadwork that the Chinese here are famous for. Also many other tasty restaurants featuring other types of cuisine."
,,Fun for the Entire Family,5.0,,"I've visited Chinatown on a number of occasions. It is always a great stop for everyone in the family. Whether old or young, there seems to be something that appeals to everyone. Many shop owners may say hello and invite you in, but you will not feel pressured, as you would in some other similar marketplaces. There are plenty of places to stop for food and a drink. Be sure to check out the ice cream vendor at the corner of Pagoda and South Bridge streets for a unique Singaporean treat."
,,Not impressed,3.0,,Before going to Singapore I heard about Chinatown and after reaching there I was not very impressed.... I found it very normal and nothing impressive catch my attention
,,Get. Food. Here.,5.0,,The food here is delicious and there's so much to choose from. The street is clean and there's an easy access to a sink outside to wash up before or after eating.
,,PLEASE VISIT,5.0,,"Please go in the evening after sunset. Roam around and enjoy local shopping and music. Don't miss the street food. ""N"" number of varieties available. Food is very hygienic and tasty. Need minimum 1-2 hours to explore and enjoy."
,,Chinatown in Singapour - Winter 2017,4.0,,I love Chinatown ... I have discovered the area in 2012 and 2013 during business trips. This year with my wife we had the opportunity to stay a couple of days in Singapour .. and our first visit following our arriving in town was .. Chinatown ! Would you like to eat ? at any hours ? legacy chinese food ? Sea food ? .. go there .. have a look also to all those old houses and buildings. A really great place.
,,Interesting & Chaotic,4.0,,We experienced a torrential rain while visiting Chinatown. The vendors had every opportunity to overcharge on umbrellas but they did not. Impressive. There is a profusion of shops selling all manner of items. Prices vary as does the quality. Feel free to bargain. Great place to spend your money.
,,The place for 3 for 10$ souvenirs and more!,4.0,,"Well, I frequent this place often when I used to live in SG. Many places to eat. I would highlight the traditional dessert place for the mango pomelo cold dessert which is very good. Then you can also eat frog porridge, buy clothes for your mom at OG and more."
,,Chinese food trip,4.0,,Quite far from City center. We ride taxi going there. So many people and quite dark. Food is great. Just like hong kong
,,Great shopping,5.0,,"Everything you could want to experince as far as a visit to China without actually going there was in Chinatown. The excellent food, graet value shopping and wonderful people made it a must see....several times. There were some little hiccups with language at times but they were easily overcome."
,,Market place of Singapore,2.0,,We arrived by hop on off bus. Wasn't impressed with the product they had for sale. Things that could be purchased cheaper elsewhere.
,,Going downhill,3.0,,"Much like the Little India area, Chinatown seems to be simultaneously expanding and going downhill rapidly. A surfeit of similar shops and restaurants. The area was very busy with a cross section of tourists and locals, and it was a very pleasant atmosphere.however, a couple of hours is sufficient here, without any real focal point to view."
,,Best Chinatown on par with the one in San Francisco,5.0,,"If you are ready for a treasure hunt, tasting great cheap food and visiting museums! This is the place to go. Safe and cheap With young kids or among adults Chinatown is fun!! Amazing Dim Sum restaurants, you can buy Jewelry, and 3 dollar souvenirs everywhere. The Buddha tooth relic temple is breath taking. I recommend you visit each floor. The TOP floor is worth seeing. If you can go to Chinatown during Chinese New Year it is even better!! Enjoy and take cash!"
,,Good place to try some original Chinese food,5.0,,This is a good place in Singapore to try some original and not to pricey Chinese food. Also a good place to buy souvenirs.
,,best place to shop souvenirs,5.0,,"cheap and best place to shop all the singapore souvenirs , specially the 3 for $10 :) lots and lots to shop , make sure you carry cash as most of the shops accept only cash"
,,I loooove chinatown,5.0,,"Besides getting a taste of the chinese traditional shops like teashops , dim sum and dessert shops , and the Buddhas tooth relic temple, you can also visit a gorgeous Indian temple with gorgeous exotic carving and statues. Lotsa photo ops ! Spend the time exploring the streets of Chinatown and pick up a souvenir or two.. but the highlight for me is definitely the good and economical food readily available at Chinatown hawker centre. Go. Wild sampling watever catches ur fancy. But take a look at wat most Pple are eating and the stores w longer queues ..these are the popular stores for a reason! Lol.
After exploring Chinatown u can go across the road to people's park complex for a taste of retro Singapore . There is also more good food to be had at the Hawkers centre there. The floors above the hawker complex is worth visiting for a taste of retro lost in time Singapore, where ladies used to go buy textile and accessories to tailor their dresses and clothes. It is also good for sundries and hair and grooming products eg shampoos and hair gel/ Mousse at a much cheaper price then elsewhere .be prepared for crowds though especially on weekends!"
,,INTERESTING,5.0,,"Well worth a visit - a little how Singapore used to be - smaller buildings,shutters at the windows.Great places to eat and have a shop."

,,A bit filthy,3.0,,"You can get cheap fines in this place but the cleanliness of some areas are not well cleaned. Some tour companies located here are not very friendly. No sense of customer service and very mechanical - the human side is missing. You ask, they answer. No initiative to offer something that might interest you."
,,Feels clean,5.0,,"The street in the middle Feels clean enough for food that are slightly less tourist traps than other chinese seafood restaurants at boat quay, clark quay. The food complex is more hawker food and less clean but acceptable. Durian shop there too."
,,Buzzing,4.0,,This is a really decent Chinatown. You will find so many great things on offer. We didn't even intend to shop but ended up buying quite a lot from here!

,,Chinatown,3.0,,"Im only visiting this district for food, there is plenty of restaurant in this area, must try the chicken rice"
,,Very Vibrant and Colourful Place,5.0,,This has to be the cleanest Chinatown I have been to lovely place loads of souvenir shops amazing Street Food. There are many places by the street where you can sit and enjoy a drink. The MRT Station is right in the heart of it so getting there is very easy. At night the whole Market lights up great Place to visit.
,,GOOD FOR A VISIT,3.0,,We caught a bus to Chinatown and had a look around. But nothing really that we hadn't seen before. The architecture seems to be the same as we have been before and the Temple that we saw as well.
,,Free Walking Tour,5.0,,"Tour Guide Leo took us on a walk through stalls, markets and Temple of Tooth among other sites, great historical information and local knowledge, packed so much into the two hours, recommend to any visitor"
,,Unexpected and interesting features,3.0,,"Good to visit by day or night, probably better at night when the area seems to come alive. Many ""touristy"" shops down narrow streets, good eating everywhere."
,,Shopping and street food,5.0,,Best for shopping and street food.... best time to visit is in evenings.... becs the markets will be enlighted with colourful lights....
,,Shoppjng and wandering,4.0,,"Chinatown is a nice section of the town to wander around in and maybe pick up some souvenirs.
The temples are nice to visit, and if you aren't wearing proper clothes they have some for you.
There's shopping for tea, jewelry, decor and other Chinese goodies. A lot of it is the same thing over and over again without much difference in prices from store to store.
I didn't find the food to be too extraordinary in Chinatown, but I'm not a huge fan of it anyway.
I liked Chinatown better than Little India."
,,Great markets,4.0,,We came here to see the temples and was welcomed by the buzz of the markets. It was a great atmosphere and all the people were friendly. Temples are beautiful and a must see.
,,Bustling activity,5.0,,We visited as part of City Tour and wished we had time to return for a second visit. Chinatown is full of restaurants and market stalls. There was lots of street food but we didn't have time to stop and linger. We would definitely recommend visiting this vibrant part of Singapore.
,,China town,4.0,,As the name says it's a part of China in Singapore. As soon as you enter you will be welcomed by the bright colours. One of the places to buy soveniors
,,"Yep, it's Chinatown",3.0,,"There are a few hidden gems here, there's a great little antique spot and a few hawker stands with great food, otherwise it's just poorly made plastic trinkets. Don't ever pay asking price for anything, they expect you to bargain. Also, don't expect a restroom. There's one by the SMRT station, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you can hover. There is a really pretty Hindu temple which was nice to visit. Either wear pants, or plan to cover when you get there."
,,Best Chinatown ever,5.0,,"Like a trip to China but better. Exotic but none of the negatives to mainland China. Well maintained with great shops, temples, and restaurants. Part of the great variety of cultures one benefits from in a Singapore visit."
,,A beautiful experience,4.0,,"Great food, cheap shopping and a must do for western tourists. No bargaining required! Their street food hawker stalls are immaculately clean with fans for cooling and free public wifi too which is a bonus."

,,Much like most chinatowns anywhere in the world,2.0,,"The only things of real note in the area to see are the Hindu and Buddhist temples. The shops all pretty much sell the same tat at the same price. Worth a quick trip around, but don't spend long here."
,,Must Visit Place,5.0,,"I know it's a bit of a cliché visiting Chinatown in Singapore as the whole place is mostly China town, but it's worth a visit for its warm and friendly people and dynamic atmosphere.

A great place to find all sorts of interesting items. My wife used to spend endless hours here hunting out semi-precious stones to make jewellery.

I spend 6 months in Singapore and came to love the place and the people. They really are a very hard working and industrious bunch of people that have worked an economic and technological miracle on a tiny island. I wish them well."
,,Made in Thailand??,3.0,,"There is a wide range of goods on sale here, but a certain amount appear to have been made in Thailand. Be wary of the shipowners behind the street stalls, they are VERY good salespeople, and it is guaranteed that you will spend on something before you get out the door! Having said that, there are a lot of interesting items for sale, some of which may appeal, and also a number of dining places to try. Also visit the Buddhist temple, and the Hindu temple nearby."
,,"Very commecrialised - more like ""Made in China town""",3.0,,"Very commecrialised - more like ""Made in China town"". Just selling stuff along the streets. It is not like the chinatown for example in Bangkok where you feel the town is fro the people there. This one was for the tourists."
,,Loved this market. Well worth a visit.,5.0,,"We really enjoyed walking through this market. It has all sorts for tourists to buy and at reasonable prices. Most prices are negotiable so have some fun and bargain with the vendors. There are a number of eateries and we ate at one. Great food to be had from quite a selection.

For the men who get bored with shopping, there is a place that you will instantly recognise that has people sitting around sipping large beers and enjoying the sea food.

All in all, a good experience and worth the visit."
,,Bright colourful place,4.0,,"Do try and spend a few hours here to buy all types of souvenirs and gifts for friends. Lots of eating options to try out Chinese cuisine.

Don`t rush to buy souvenirs from the first shop you encounter. Look around you may find the same thing cheaper at the shop next door.

Souvenirs To Buy
Traditional clothes, antiques, Chinese tea, herbal, medicine, decorative items like lantern, drama masks, Chinese handwriting, and Chinese handicrafts such as silk scarves, bags, shoes, and common souvenir items such as cups, fridge magnets, key chains, lighters, cigarette boxes, mobile cases, stamps, picture frames, and chocolate."
,,best place to shop,5.0,,"I went to this place on the last day of my singapore visit
I should say that it is the best place to do all your variety shopping and buy gifts for your family and friends.
The day I visited, it was down-pouring right after my purchase.. Thank god! A rare sight to enjoy"
,,Good gifts,4.0,,Great place to buy all your goodies and gifts to take home nice walk from shop to shop some better than other did find some store owners a little pushy but others were wet friendly and accommodating when looking at gifts and getting batteries ect place to stop for a drink and eat as well lively atmosphere especially at night time as well
,,Good vibe,4.0,,"We went to Chinatown for a meal in the early evening , it's a happy friendly part of Singapore , lots of fun , my little granddaughter danced to some music played by a flutist ."
,,Chinatown Singapore,4.0,,"Full of food, shops and interesting temples and local delights. If you like chinese food so you must stop by china town to have a new experience with the chinese food. The food street in China town is a good place for Chinese street food. Good placa to buy souvenirs too :)"
,,Food galore,3.0,,"There are many eateries but not all are uniquely singapore. If you want local singapore food, take a stroll to the china market/hawker centre and you will find a wide array of local cuisine, ranging from chicken rice, stirfry noodles and local coffee. Closeby there is even a michelin star awarded chicken rice eatery."
,,Vibrant Place,5.0,,"If you've been to the Chinatown in other cities, then Singapore Chinatown is not a place to miss. There are many local fares in the hawker centres and shops selling inexpensive souvenirs. At times, you may come across street performers singing or playing musical instruments. Certainly a place worth the visit!"
,,Great for souvenirs,4.0,,We went on the metro to China town and found it very good for purchasing souvenirs. It also has some excellent cafes and eating houses. It is very colourful and busy and vibrant and it is a must see destination .
,,Chinatown,5.0,,I buy the funkiest clothes in Chinatown. I get my henna done there. I look forward to going every time I come back to Singapore.
,,Chinatown in China town (Singapore),4.0,,"Traditional last and pr-last century houses and streets in the middle of modern megacity. Lot of cheaper cost shopping available, strange food in small shops and restaurants, many of them open-air, unusual services, traditional Chinese products, dense crowd of Chinese people, lot of Chinese decorations in markets, but also on the houses - all that just different from the Singapore city standard. Worth seeing."
,,Busy location,5.0,,There are many thing to see and many thing to eat. That is a great location and busy area especially at night. Cheap product and Nice food. Highly recommend.
,,Mandarine Love in the Heart of SG,4.0,,"Passing the high-rises of Singapore, the moment you enter Chinatown the whole world changes. You witness the beautiful Chinese Architecture of shops, a lot of ""China-Chinese"" people and some wonderful flea markets. The food street was our favourite place to eat out in evening. You can do some serious bargain on shopping here and guess what? It works."
,,Fantastic food,5.0,,If you like Chinese food then this is the place to get it. The culture and colour of Chinatown make it an area not to be missed when visiting Singapore. Strolling around either by night or day you'll feel perfectly safe in this vibrant part of the city. If you enjoy this then visit Little India too you won't be disappointed.

,,Bargain City,5.0,,"Really authentic feel to this place, had a great day exploring and visited Buddha Tooth Relic Temple."

,,A real Chinatown,5.0,,"Singapore Chinatown is good to visit anytime throughout the year but from Christmas to Chinese New Year it really comes alive. Great shopping and authentic Chinese lifestyle with lots of restaurants, temples and reasonably priced ""hawker centre's"""
,,Go and get lost.,5.0,,"Chinatown is full of food, shops and interesting temples and local delights. It is a wonder to visit both during the day and night. Try and go during Chinese New Year, you will not be disappointed."
,,New Experience,5.0,,"I visited the place in 2010. The chines new year celebration and parade it's something that you must see, as all the streets was colorful and music every where with dancing dragons. If you like chines food so you must stop by china town to have a new experience with the chines food. the place is a mix of different far east cultures blended together in one place."
,,Our favourite Singapore destination.,4.0,,"Such a vibrant mix of sounds, sights, smells and colour. So easy to spend hours just walking around taking it all in... and the food! Hah! Make sure to take in the newly refurbished Cultural Centre in the heart of Chinatown."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"We particularly liked the Chinese Heritage Centre. We did a guided tour which was about $20, and went for a little over an hour and was highly informative and fascinating. The guided recommended us to great little Yum Cha a block away where the locals go. It was great."
,,China Town Bargains,5.0,,"I like to walk for exercise for about two hours every morning and Singapore is a great place to do that - well any city I suppose as you get to see much more but Singapore is especially good as you can see everything and go everywhere.
In addition to my daily walk I decided to walk to Chinatown one day as it is only about 2ks from the Mercure Bugis where I was staying at the time although, I turned left instead of right at an intersection and ended up at the old Singapore Airport which was closed in 1965 when Changi was built. So I was not disappointed - Singapore has yet to open it to the Public as a Tourist attraction - back to the Chinatown markets - always good for a visit and a lunch - I purchased some silk House Pants for my wife for SD$8.00, a Jade Oxen for her birth sign for SD$16.00 and some genuine Aramis Eau De Toilette haggled to SD$38.00 which I pay AUD$75.00 for in Australia - it is worth a visit and take a photo in front of the Hindu Temple beside the entrance."
,,Good for finding goods and photo,4.0,,"If you like to find souvenir stuffs and photo, can consider of visiting here. Make sure dont get yourself lost direction as its quite packed in there"
,,A must for all visitors,5.0,,"An incredible mixture of small vendors selling every imaginable souvenir, clothes, electronics, food etc. A good photo opportunity as well. On Sundays in. This area they set up second hand stalls in some of the malls for antiques etc."
,,Well worth a visit.,3.0,,"If you want to see Singapores history and development this is a must see area.
The Chinese tailor museum is well worth s visit, to see how the businesses operated, and survived is eye opening, the squalor and hardship they suffered to make a living combined with all the varying types of people who lived in these tenement buildings above the tailors shop is fascinating.
Plus the variety of street food traders offering their various menus is a treat in itself."
,,Good food,4.0,,"The food street in China town is a good place for Chinese street food, we particularly like Tim Sum's Dim Sum. It was quiet but maybe we have been at busy times before during Chinese New Year. The streets are interesting and full of trinkets as souvenirs and if says made in China, well that's fine! The advertised lion dance on a Saturday evening was a bit disappointing, the performers looked bored, but the lions were ok, and happy to engage with the crowd. There is also interesting temple and some cultural buildings we haven't explored yet"
,,Classic China,4.0,,We found it to be much like many other Asian country Chinatowns. Looks of little tourist shops with trinkets and small sized t-shirts. I got my Frig Magnets pretty cheap. We did find a nice shop to get our names done up with Chinese characters.
,,Go for the food,4.0,,"Brilliant food, the best food I had in Singapore. Nice atmosphere and plenty of the traditional Chinese shops selling a variety of wares, from medicines to lanterns. Easy to find and easy to get lost in, take your time and have a good old rummage."
,,"Strangely, locals miss this",4.0,,"As a local, and working within the vicinity, Chinatown is a sorely taken for granted site.
Honestly, it's one of Singapore's most colourful and delightful sight.
It's a definite to-go and experience site not to be missed by both tourists and locals.
The food, the artefact, the bargaining, the air around it, it all very exciting.
From local street food to Mongolian fare and of course, Singapore's most famous dessert store at the corner of Temple street and New Bridget Road (Mei Heong Yuen).
One has a choice of dining alfresco or in air-conditioned eateries/restaurants.
The China-imported souvenirs are literally cheaper than in China itself. A total bargain without bargaining and this is my personal experience.
I would love to make more weekend walk-around Chinatown and savour each and every street store especially the satay and prawn noodles.
If one is energetic, divert to Ann Siang Hill, Club Street area (a stone's throw away) to enjoy the bustling restaurant outlets ranging from good old Nasi Lemak (The Coconut Club), to Tapas at Lolla where the Uni with Black Pudding is to die for.
The list goes on, just go explore."
,,Nothing to do,1.0,,"We had the day off and thought we would explore china town. They 2 religious buildings on the tourist guides are not worth visiting. They are normal religious places for prayer not for tourists. We felt rude to enter these particular buildings. We have visited many temples, churches and other religious buildings but these ones felt more just for the locals and didn't really have anything else to see.

The rest of China town was uneventful, same old shops, same food, watch store after watch store buy 3 for $10 :|"
,,Always great to visit,5.0,,This is my second visit to China town compared to a year ago. Great options for shopping and fantastic deals as well.
,,Just a lot of cheap junk shops,3.0,,"No really impressed with China town, just a lot of cheap ""junk"" shops and nothing really exciting or different. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple was the only thing I enjoyed seeing during the visit"
,,Great for tourist souvenirs,5.0,,"We went to China town and loved it. There are many shops selling tacky tourist goods but actually it was really cheap and not bad to walk through! We enjoyed it. The food was amazing there. We decided on street food - there is an avenue of food - some restaurants were overpriced at $S50 each but we got food for about $S12 each.

A must visit whilst in Singapore."
,,Chinatown,5.0,,"Visited this place many years ago, now most of the good stores have gone. It was raining but those stores that were open offered good service."
,,Great neighborhood with tons of food!,4.0,,"Great food, central location, and perfect juxtaposition of old Singapore and new Singapore with the central business district view against the clay hoofed roofs."
,,A real bargain hunters paradise,4.0,,"This is one of the best Chinatowns I have visited, a real bargain hunters paradise . Mostly stalls but a few camera shops to be found."
,,Something for Everyone,5.0,,"A thriving, bustling, lively part of Singapore. Whilst there are plenty of stores selling 'tourist tat' try avoiding these and search out more authentic stores and small shops in side streets where the local shopkeeper will be delighted to let you look before you buy.
The MRT connects with all parts of the city and Chinatown has its own line the 'Downtown Line'. This is the easiest way to get around Singapore and is incredibly clean,fast not expensive.Places to see in Chinatown include the famous 'Tintin' shop in Pagoda St. and the Heritage Centre depicting life in Chinatown in days gone by also in Pagoda St. There are thousands of places to eat but do try nearby Lau Pa sat Market and the Maxwell Court Hawker centre where food is cooked to order and very fresh. Do visit the Buddha Temple on South Bridge Road and the mosque in Telok Ayer st."
,,"Colourful, bright and a lot to see.",5.0,,"I've always enjoyed bgoing to China town in Singapore, with so much colour, atmosphere and huge range of restaurants, there's plenty to choose from.
We have always chosen to eat in the central street where the vendors will cook your food on the spot and it's very reasonable in cost. For me, a happy and calming place to visit."
,,Great bargains to be had here,4.0,,"visit this place every time I go to Singapore, as it is the best place to buy souveniers and other things likeslippers and things - all very cheap !"
,,Exciting area to visit,5.0,,"Stayed close to Chinatown and visited on several occasions. Always busy and vibrant, with plenty of opportunities to eat street food. Even the rain doesn't stop this place."
,,Never seen a Chinatown so Clean & organized,4.0,,"What a pleasant surprise...but in Singapore...what else to expect. The place was laid out nicely and very clean. Restaurant area was separate somewhat in center of the courtyards. The shops were well organized and you could find anything. Friendly sales people but they did not hassel you...either you bought or you did not.
It was quite a change from every other china town around the world. Singapore I applaud you for this organization and cleanliness in a community that generally does not present clean."
,,Visit to Chinatown,4.0,,A good time to go there is just before Chinese New Year. The mood is very festive & the lightings are nice
,,The best place for shopping in Singapore,4.0,,There were streets full of stores with a variety of goods. Very good place to buy souvenirs especially magnets or t-shirts. Some very good dining locations at club street: A restored colonial area with modern restaurants and beautiful houses. Do pass by Buddha tooth relic temple; very relaxing after a lot of shopping.
,,Interesting architecture,4.0,,We visited two parts of Chinatown- near the temple and on Club street area. The hustle and bustle of Chinatown was lively and interesting but we preferred the Mao temple area around Club street with great bars and restaurants.
,,China town Singapore,4.0,,A crowded place where you are surrounded with everything Chinese from temples to shops to eateries. There is a large space dedicated to small shops which is really worth roaming around for gifts and souvenirs. Accessible by metro rail which has a station right in front of the market place. You can spend half a day at the temple and market
,,Crowded -just place for shoping,3.0,,Didnot find as expected.Have so many street shop.Full of fake items selling.You can find copy of any brands from watch to bag.Doesnot look like traditional market.
,,very busy with lots of people,2.0,,"Visited Chinatown early evening to experience the atmosphere and shops. Lots of people investigating the various shops and food outlets in very narrow 'alleyways' - need to push your ways through as other tourist are not always respectful of other people's space even more so when it started to rain.
Lots of tourist junk on offer but it was interesting to view the various foods on offer although we did not partake.
Worth a single visit to experience the place but would not go again"
,,Nice,4.0,,"It's a place for tourists as Singaporeans will rarely buy any products from the Chinatown streets but instead from the shop houses nearby. There is a hawker centre which sells really good delicacies and definitely worth a visit. If you're looking for more high end food, there is a Chinatown Point that you can visit."
,,Chinatown - Singapore,5.0,,"Amazing atmosphere and a must visit when in Singapore. So many shops, markets and places to eat. Very Friendly. Use to get to by MRT. Aim to Chinatown MRT station. Great day or night"
,,Good place for shopping bargains,4.0,,"Plenty of offers and everything cheap. 3 cotton bags 10$, magnets 1$, silk scarves, Chinese food and clothes."
,,Enjoyable time in Chinatown,4.0,,"Always plenty to see and do in Chinatown, shopping good and so is the many food stalls, also some interesting history and buildings easy to find go to MRT Chinatown station"
,,Best for travelers on a budget,4.0,,"Chinatown is very accessible by MRT (rail transit), very clean and is a tourist attraction. I find the Food Street is priced for tourist but there are lots of eateries with photos of food and prices which are cheaper than restaurants along Food Street. Peoples Complex and Peoples Park are where you will find the shopping centers with more eateries/take away (hawkers) at very cheap price. Smith St is locally known as the Food Street. We came across a small eatery called Tiong Bahru at 58 Smith St that serves boneless Hainanese chicken that is really delicious. At Peoples Park is the yummy silken tofu with palm sugar and sesame balls. I am very happy that my hubby booked our hotel near Chinatown, I can say I am in heaven with the food offering. If you want Chinese, curries, seafood this is the place to be, you will not go hungry."
,,Hustle & Bustle,5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore takes you back to the Chinatown of old, filled with hawkers, food stalls, traders selling all imaginable goods. Amongst the souvenir & trinket sellers there are some wonderful things to see and explore.
This is a place definitely worth spending a few hours exploring and perhaps enjoying a meal from one of the many stalls or restaurants selling every foot type imaginable."
,,"Shopping, shopping, eating eating",5.0,,You could spend hours in this china town lots of shopping of everything you could think of & Food galore prices are not fixed so make sure you haggle to get the price you want to pay
,,Colourful,4.0,,"We passed through Chinatown on the HOHO twice, getting off once to explore the colourful market area on foot."
,,Busy,3.0,,"Worth a visit. A mix of bars restaurants the usual stalls selling tourist tat as well as the stalls selling Chinese goods, foods etc. jewellers electric goods you name it you can probably buy it. I found the high end goods more expensive than home."
,,Visit it if you are a fan of Tintin,4.0,,"Decided to visit China town as we had a day to kill in Singapore and had seen everything else. Went to Tripadvisor and saw it among the things to do. Glad I followed it as otherwise I would have never found the hidden gem i.e a quiet little Tintin shop were I felt like I was thrown into the world of Tintin. I was able to collect my favorite figurines of Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock as well as lifesize figures of the three whee I could pose with them.
Chinatown also has the most inexpensive souveneirs to offer so visit it if you are low on budget and you will get may many things even in 10-20 SGD. It is connected via metro so the best way to travel is via the Chinatown station. Cannot gaurantee the quality of the products but you should visit if you have time on your hands or ifyou are a big fan of Tintin."
,,Amazing food!,4.0,,"I didn't want to be too touristy and pay over the top prices to eat in Chinatown. I wanted to eat where the Chinese community in Singapore might enjoy cheap food. This turned out to be Chinatown complex. 5 dollars for a fantastic meal. Very basic setting, just like a food court, but it felt a lot more authentic"
,,Don't miss it!,4.0,,"Chinatown is best for visit during big festivals such as Chinese new years or Moon festival. The reason is these are the times when extravagant decorations are up and streets are full of beautiful lightings. Not to mention there will be more nightmarkets that offers bargains. Perfect to experience the Chinese culture.

If you come during normal days, it just feels like another shopping area with lots of people. Nothing special."
,,Good fun place to walk around.,3.0,,"Lots of interesting things to see, undercover areas to walk in. We went in search of carved name seals and found a man who specialises in this craft, which is probably a bit of a dying art nowadays. Apart from that, lots of food stalls, malls, and souvenir shops.
Highly recommend art by Beilexian - cute owls and other cartoon animals - which she sells in a store along the main Chinatown pedestrian street mall."
,,Colorful friendly place.,5.0,,"Took the MTR train 2 stops to Chinatown station. When I got out of the station I didn't realize I should walk outside, and then to the pedestrian overpass to cross over the busy street. When I did that, I was then in the heart of the shopping. You could also walk over to the giant rooster outside on same street and cross at the intersection.

There was a lot of good shopping here. I purchased jewelry and some paint brushes for painting watercolor. It was all endlessly fascinating. There is something for everyone. Lots of bags, cell phone cases, jewelry, socks, etc. It was very close to the Buddah Tooth Relic Temple. I had a good time here, went twice. Upon leaving, the subway escalators were right there."
,,Great place,5.0,,"Great atmosphere, very cheap for food and gifts. Not a lot to say really but you have to go to see it for yourself"
,,Its ok but wouldnt rave about it,3.0,,If you are doing a quick trip i would probably give it a miss. There is a great temple to visit and the night markets does fire things up
,,Good chinese foods,4.0,,Good various chinese dim sum restaurants including Yum Cha. Delicious desert restaurants as well.
,,Search for old traditional houses,4.0,,"There are some streets in Chinatown more dedicated to tourists with a lot of shops, restaurants etc... but if you go further, you can find very nice traditional Chinese houses built in the early 20th century."
,,"Go, Mingle, Enjoy",5.0,,"Enjoy the experience of being hassled to buy some cheap souvenirs or a £50 suit, maybe a cheap watch a ""silk"" kimono. The sounds and smells of China Town have to be experienced and enjoyed"
,,Must Visit - 一定要到訪之處,5.0,,"Subway system leads you here easily from everywhere. Chinatown contains so many different things. You can find famous Chinese and Indian temples in the area & you can all kinds of Chinese food and snacks everywhere. You can buy many local old style folk crafts and you can find hundred years plus Chinese medicines too. I would suggest you line up if you see a long queue and they never fail you!
地鐵系統把你從任何地方便捷的帶來這裡，這裡什麼都有，包括著名的中國和印度廟宇以及各式各樣的中國食物及小食，這兒有很多懷舊的當地華人用品可以買得到，你也可以找到百年中藥或藥膏，建議只要有人排隊的店就過去跟著排隊，保證你不會失望！"
,,China Town never fails to amaze,4.0,,Try walking off the main routes and exploring the side streets. Here you see the real shophouses and small family shops. food is a tad cheaper and more authentic.
,,Buzzing,4.0,,The place is always buzzing. Quiet a crowded place. This is a nice place to pick some soveiner. Keep walking to find the best deal
,,I felt like in a big souvenir shop,1.0,,"We were really disappointed by China Town as un comparison to Little India there is no real life and culture transmitted. It felt like we were walking in a large Chinese souvenir shop who sell real cheap stuff.
Very very disappointing.
I cannot recommend this area."
,,Nice place for a picnic or short break,4.0,,I can recommend to use the hop-on-hop-off bus to visit the China town in Singapore. There are lot of restaurants and shops.
,,Cheap but good,5.0,,Always look for Chinatown when travelling. Always some interesting shops to peruse and plenty of tasty cheap food . Think we enjoyed 3 dishes and a beer each for under $20. Good atmosphere at night and easy to soak up a few hours . Definitely worth a look and a taste .
,,Great place,5.0,,"Been to similar places in KL AND HONG KONG, found this one the best yet for atmosphere and size.
Had several visits her in evening, gets busy but as spacious there are no problems.
Bargain away for better prices, have a drink and some food. Great for kids who are welcomed. Felt safe, even though a solo traveller, this included evening walk to and from hotel by river."
,,Nice town,5.0,,We went to Buddhist temple and China market. There are shops u can buy souvenirs and gifts for cheaper price. Price was mentioned in each item. So its not necessary to bargain. The place is super clean and we see the difference between kuala lumpur China town and this place. We felt very comfortable here. There are many hawker centres where u can try some Chinese recipies.
,,Just another China Town in another country,5.0,,A place to go if you're looking for authentic Chinese food in Singapore though there are couple of different cuisines you can find here other than Chinese food. Good place to go if you want to buy souvenirs.
,,Recommend,5.0,,Good place to buy suvenirs and eat some good chinese food. Also in this place you can visit Hindu temple and the Temple of Buddha Tooth.
,,China town,4.0,,Busy and bustling with life but also not quite as raw as it used to be. Singapore glitz is making its presence felt.
,,Authentic and plentiful,5.0,,"This Chinatown is very large and easy to get to. There are hundreds of stalls with items to purchase, some more authentic than others. There are is large variety of foods, including a large hawker stand with dozens and dozens of authentic foods. There is no pressure from vendors when you are browsing. Food is much less expensive here than in local restaurants"
,,"Easy way to spend a day -- colour, culture and contrast",4.0,,"My favourite experiences of Chinatown have been in the company of friends who act as tour guides -- otherwise it's easy to get lost in the many winding streets, stalls, shops and eating spots. There are so many places to see with souvenirs abounding. Over the years I've bought a diverse range of goods from here...everything from touristy little china teasets to artistic lacquer boxes and bowls.
Again this is a great place to visit in company, or with some advanced knowledge of local customs, particularly with regard to pricing. Many places will be offering similar, if not the same goods, but there are also unique stores nestled among the mass. Be prepared to take your time to look and be savvy about your shopping..."
,,Chinatown Singapore,5.0,,"Wonderfully colourful and interesting place for food and souvenirs. Great place to shop and buy presents or get a Taylor Made suite rattled up.

Try the minced pork sold in slices at roadside delicatessens. The pork is marinated and is superbly sweet. I hope to go back and get some for home."
,,Great Area,4.0,,A very large and old Chinatown with tons of stores and restaurants. Smith street is one huge food street featuring hawker or street food. A lot charm and always very busy.
,,"Typical, busy Chinatown location.",4.0,,"A busy colourful area of Singapore, its a must to go and see and sample the markets and sample the local food. Great fun and good banter with the locals."
,,Explore the nooks & crannies.,5.0,,"Have been visiting Chinatown in Singapore for over six years. Each time I discover more interesting places.

During my visit to Singapore last weekend I ventured along Mosque Street (towards Telok Ayer MRT) ... it is colourful with many restaurants and bars for a late night out.

At the other end of Chinatown (near Outram Park MRT) there are many Shophouses with restaurants in the sidestreets close to the Dorsett Hotel where I was staying.

I particularly enjoyed the new ""Taste of Shanghai"" restaurant and ""kayco Singapore"" restaurant which are both nearby the Dorsett.

There are many more places in Chinatown other than Pagoda Street...explore to area - you will be surprised too!"
,,Quaint,4.0,,"Felt like stepping back in time, walking through the market stalls and skipping the traditional cheap souvenirs. Didn't try any of the food stalls, but the China Food Street looked the real deal! There are a couple of temples to see - these are really worthwhile (Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Sri Mariamman Temple)."
,,Stock looked old,1.0,,"No real bargains to be had here, people quiet rude Everything on stalls looked like it had been sitting there for 5 years"
,,Chinese culture,5.0,,Modern chinese culture in here.. If u like to eat pork and feel the sense of chinese in Singapore.. Chinatown is ur answered..
,,Just another chinatown,3.0,,"Much like other global chinatowns, this one I see not much different. Crowded, lots of eateries, herbal medicine places and chachka shops that are overpriced."
,,A real taste of China,4.0,,"My only concern is whether the branded goods are all genuine. We bought a few Chinese nick nacks. But the tailors, electronic stores, jewellers and restaurants all offered very good value."
,,Souvenirs and food,4.0,,"Quite clean, lots of souvenir stalls must accept cards) and food stalls.

Be warned that many places close by 9pm.

It's always worth asking for a discount of buying something. Its not as crazy in terms of bargaining as, say, Beijing but many people will.give you a small discount. That said, prices and variety are pretty standard across the board. You have to look very hard to find anything truly unusual"
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"Really enjoyed wandering China town. There is a MRT stop at China town. Really good for souvenirs, bought slippers, kimonos, little bags etc. Well worth a visit"
,,If you have sometime to spend,3.0,,"There're plenty of Chinatown around the world, and definitely Singapore is not my favorite. A lot of shops to buy and several places to eat, but it's not a must in my opinion.
There you'll find some king fruit, even out of season (that's if you like it): the durian, which smells like rotten onions"
,,Fun Chinatown,5.0,,"Loved the food and shopping. Great Soya Chicken at food mall, and Chili Crab at MomaKong's! Very colorful area and loved the Big Chicken that welcomes you to Chinatown."
,,Chinatown worth a visit,4.0,,"It is a bit unkempt and always hot but it is a lot of fun to look at the open air stores and, for the purposeful shopper, there is always some knickknack or garment that can be had quite cheaply for a little bargaining."
,,Nice tour,5.0,,"We came here for a nice walk and also to try nice food. We tried Durian Snow Flake, it was delicious. The Bak Kut Teh here is also not bad. A lot of places to buy souvenirs as well."
,,Nice to have a guide,4.0,,"Our guide took us around. Nice bargain shopping and a great place to eat. Shopping, eating, culture all in one."
,,"Nice, clourful place, with cheap shopping options",4.0,,"This is a nice and colourful place with a lot of street shopping options. I found this to be a little cheaper than Bugis. If you are not an ""Orchard Road Shopper"" - taste wise or wallet wise - this is a good place for you. Even otherwise, this is a good time to spend an evening. The location is convenient - it is just outside the Chinatown MRT station and can be reached in 10-20 mins from almost anywhere in Singapore."
,,"Wow an another busy, crazy place.",4.0,,"There are Chinatown all over the place and most are similar but what we liked about this one was that it was very clean and very good for food. Apparently they can only do food if the have a hygiene certificate, so its very, very safe to do the street food, much safes than in other cities.

Have some eats, than stoll round and look at all the stalls, great day out."
,,Year of the Rooster!,5.0,,Outside Chinatown MRT station was a huge rooster figure which was brightly lit..It quickly dawned to me that it must be the Year of the Rooster...:) the place has several good eating places which remain open till midnight..found a 7-11 store as well ..
,,CHINATOWN EATING - NOT AS INEXPENSIVE AS OTHER AREA IN SINGAPORE,4.0,,"We went to Chinatown thinking we would get the same quality and inexpensive food we had experienced 10 years ago during our last visit. We were a little disappointed - the food quality was still very good, but not as good as last visit. There seems to have been a bit too much order put into the stall arrangement with food outlets much more formal than previous or what you will experience in other areas where street food is sold. With this formality, the prices are also a bit higher than other hawker stalls and street food outlets. By all means try it first, then try some of the other areas - that way you will only experience an upwards trend in quality. Enjoy."
,,good for shopping,3.0,,"If you are the type that loves to shop, Chinatown is for you. Good food all around too. Visit also the temples."
,,Must visit when in Singapore,5.0,,"Nice to wander around Chinatown for the sights, smells and sounds. Loads of market stalls, street food and restaurants. Got to spend at least a couple of hours to fully appreciate it."
,,No visit is complete to Singapore without stopping here,5.0,,Wandering the markets and looking at all that is for sale from trinkets to amazing food. I spent a few hours just wandering and eating. Amazing.
,,"BUSTLING, FRANTIC BUT FUN",5.0,,"We visited Chinatown a couple of times, mainly to buy souvenirs. There is one street dedicated to food, and the smells from some of the stalls was phenomenal (we later found out that two of these stalls are Michelin Starred - and it's a pity we did not realise that at the time). There was a bit of banter from some of the stall holders trying to entice us in (mainly the clothing stores) but we just smiled, said ""No thank you"" politely, and were then left alone. A place you must visit when in Singapore."
,,"Enjoy shopping, varieties of souvenirs",5.0,,"The best place to enjoy window shopping and buy varieties of souvenirs. This place offer you the best price in Singapore. The souvenirs are good quality and different design. Every visit we have found the new creative items. This place is the ""must"" for visitors and local people to visit definitely!"
,,"By day or by night, just go",4.0,,"Our first visit, before our cruise, was mid afternoon and not quite as crowded at our next visit before flying home, in the evening. Shopping opportunities, eating or just sightseeing it's great. We were particularly taken with the old buildings with their louvres and architecture. It is wonderful that they are still there. However, I will say that the atmosphere at night is electric. Open till really late it was a great place to be after dinner."
,,A lot of history take a walking tour,4.0,,Went on a free walking tour the guides name was Wei. His English was very good and he spoke a number of other languages as well. His knowledge was in depth and provided another layer to our experience having walked through this area a number of times before on our own. The additional pieces of local landmarks and eating establishments in the hawker centers was well worth the 3 to 4 hours spent with him.
,,Colorless,3.0,,"One would not realize that you are in Chinatown except for the signs. The signs in the area are in Chinese with no English translation. But beyond that, the area has no character. We were only in the area because our hotel Parkroyal on Pickering was next door to the Chinatown station."
,,A foodise delight after sunset,5.0,,"Just wait till after sunset and head on down to Chinatown for the best seafood experince you will ever have.
with so many options and a large crowd of people you know its good. Tourist and locals mix in this hidden gem of a street food experince your taste buds will thank you for.
Alot of cheap tourist shops to checkout and take home a few tacky fridge magnets and other trinkets."
,,Hustle and bustle but fun,5.0,,Just what we expected in a Chinatown area but more organised than in some cities. The street food areas were excellent quality and value and the shops and stalls sold goods at low prices. Easy to get there and a lovely atmosphere.
,,Must do,5.0,,Loved it here. Great place to shop as lots of little stalls to get cheap gifts for home. Food stalls are good too. Must do Tooth Relic temple as beautiful . 4 floors to explore. Start from top an unexpected roof garden and work your way down. It is free but do leave a contribution
,,Busy and Properous Place,4.0,,You can get lots of famous dishes in the China Town Food Street at reasonable prices. The souvenirs such as fried pork and medicated oil are easy to get here.
,,Dim sum lunch and a walk along Smith Street,4.0,,Old Singapore can be hard to find...but Little China has authentic houses that have been preserved with dozens of places to eat...quick and very good dim sum
,,A Vibrant market and eating district,4.0,,If you want to chance your arm at bartering while picking up a few souvenirs and bargains China Town is the place to visit. It is a vibrant busy area that is crammed with shops and street side eateries.
,,Of a the Chinatowns...,4.0,,... this was the best I've visited. Shop assistants were really helpful and don't rip you off. Cheapest chopsticks and fans in the Far East and terrific food.
,,Vacation,5.0,,"Having a filipino - chinese husband and for us who both love authentic chinese foods we made sure that this place is our travels bucket list. Of you are looking for an affordable yet sumptous and varities of chinese foods this is the place to be, aside of that there are lots of souvenir shops and you can actually bargain!!! Its also accessible with the metro"
,,AVERAGE,3.0,,"Big streer market, with many item you can choose. Cheap price, many offers discount if you buy more than one and you can bargaining with the seller. But unfortunately, this place is over crowded and some seller not humble with customer."
,,Prettiest Chinatown I've visited,5.0,,"I've been to several Chinatowns over the years, including San Francisco's, and this one is just really special. They've done a particularly wonderful job of retaining and enhancing the gorgeous old shophouses. There's a bit of everything here - dingy little local markets where we were the only Caucasians and stunning high-end restaurants housed in beautifully restored shophouses. All sorts of shopping to be had and large parts are still a true Chinatown where people of that culture are still living and working. Very colourful with all sorts of sights, smells, sounds and food galore. Highly recommend checking the place out thoroughly for at least half a day."
,,Touristy but fun,4.0,,"We have been to Chinatown on several occasions and it is always a bit of fun with so many people and lots of bargains to be had , lovely food and lots to see . On this trip we came 3 times to have meals and I had a Suit made to measure . It was perfect. Definitely worth a visit or 2 ."
,,Chinatown is Chinatown,4.0,,"The old Chinese quarter of the city (which is mostly ethnic Chinese nowadays) is one of the must-do areas of Singapore. Traditional architecture, hawker food, hundreds of shops selling tourist tat, plenty of Chinese restaurants for all tastes (surprise!!), a few temples, a mosque, plenty of red lanterns, crowds, smells and colors.
Though there are no unmissable sights the atmosphere and the vibe are worth an extensive walk with a few food appreciation stops."
,,Time runs faster than the wrist watch,5.0,,"If there's a place in Singapore that makes you go bonkers, its the Chinatown. I spent a day long going streets, shopping, eating, drinking and finally the old lord Buddha temple. I was mesmerized by the ambiance of the temple and did spend time to meditate. The philosophy and incarnation description is great. The best i liked was HH Amitava Buddha and HH Manjushri Buddha. Also the game of Chinese chess, the sit out area were energizing. The food street was mouth watering and the best was the cheese or butter crab. Evenings are equally exciting and ensure you spend good time here."
,,There's a lot more to Singapore,3.0,,"One of Singapore's most iconic attractions, with lots of food, shopping and culture. I enjoyed the Heritage Centre too. As a local, I feel that it does not accurately depict Singapore though as there is so much more to our city. The Food Street is overrated and overpriced, try a simple meal at a regular hawker centre instead. On the plus side, loads of cheap souvenirs to buy."
,,Great local food,5.0,,In China town you get to see all types of local food in the hawkers Street food corner. If you are a foodie and love Chinese food then you must visit China Town
,,Eating was a delight,3.0,,"The food in China Town made the visit worth while. Sitting in the street, enjoying dredging made dishes was enjoyable.
There is not much else to do other than eat. It was crowded and hot. There were so many people. Not a good place to bring your young children if they are walking on their own."
,,colourful wonderland,4.0,,Definitely the place to go when in singapore. the options are endless...loads of beautiful gifts and trinketts. It is a must have experience. I didnt actually try any of the food but will definitely do so next time i visit.
,,Interest network of streets reasonable eateries fascinating museum about Chinese settlers,4.0,,Tourist area good places to eat at modest prices tourist shops. Excellent museum detailing fully lives of early immigrants from china
,,Must visit,5.0,,Must visit for food lovers and casual shoppers. Lots of authentic and highly rated restaurants are present. Can spend a whole day here.
,,Love Singapore's Chinatown,4.0,,Beautiful old buildings and of course plenty of great Chinese food. Make sure to visit Maxwell Road Hawker Centre for great Chicken Rice and other other delicious items.
,,As good as any Chinese night market.,4.0,,"I live in China, and it was if I were transported back. Large shopping street night market. Anything you want and more!"
,,Loved it,5.0,,"Wonderful, great food. Make sure to eat at the Hawker centres. Stalls are rated with an "" A, B, C or less"". We stuck with the ""A's"", sometimes the ""B's""."

,,Vibrant,5.0,,Vibrant. Bustling. Colourful. Aromatic. Very very cheap for souvenirs. Beautiful food at great prices. Well worth a visit
,,Chinatown,5.0,,Chinatown is crowded as always. A lot of restaurants and souvenir shops there. The Whole area is so colorful and lively.
,,Little bit of China in Singapore,3.0,,This was a little bit disappointing from the shopping point of view as most stalls sold the same things. Prices were not as cheap as expected. March ... it was hot and humid walking through the stalls.
,,Chinatown is always fun.,4.0,,Although it was fun to visit and eat in Chinatown it is a bit of a tourist trap. The prices are quite high for a Chinatown and the atmosphere was much less authentic than in Bangkok.

,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,We visited with a personal guide which made this visit more memorable. We had lunch in Smith St which was enjoyable and purchased gifts in a couple of the shops. Well worth the visit
,,Busy on weekends,3.0,,I visited Chinatown during the week and it wasn't very crowed. Lots of small shops with touristy toys and clothes. The food was ok from what I saw and had. I spent an hour or so and that was enough for me to get the idea of chinatown. I didn't explore as much I might have. There is a traditional temple in the area that I didn't visit during my stay in Singapore.
,,Ni hao,4.0,,"Little China here... get in touch with the culture, the food, souvenirs, handicrafts and all you can buy here. Prices are reasonable and you can also bargain."
,,Food and souvenirs !!,3.0,,"If you are in Singapore and looking for souviners and hawker food then this is the best place to visit. It's accessible via train, bus and public bus. Before you buy in one store better to walk around first take look which store have the cheapest one because sometimes they have different prices and offer and quality as well. Most stores start at 10AM until 8PM."
,,"Great Atmosphere, great food",4.0,,"What a great place to walk around. It's showpiece this year was the Chinese New Year Cockerel, in all its glory, right at the beginning of Chinatown.

There are many streets and sights to see, with some great, if now slightly faded, architecture, including a fantastic food street, as well as many other restaurants and shops. Certainly a lot of the food was not Chinese as we know it in UK, think we took a lot of poetic licence in some of our Chinese food names..
If you want it, you can surely get it, in Chinatown."
,,Amazing food,5.0,,"We walked through Chinatown and went to the Chinatown Complex food hall (up a level from the street) and lined up for an hour for Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken and Noodle (so worth it! $2 for an amazing meal)

One of us stayed in queue and another went and bought $2 pineapple juices from the stall opposite and also ate amazing coconut buns from the next row of stalls. YUM!

We also walked around Chinatown and visited the visitor information centre - very helpful.

There is so much to see and eat! Highly recommended."
,,China town and temple,4.0,,In China town we can find anything. But in the China town for tourist the prices are not really interesting. The temple is fantastic very nice with a particular atmosphere when the monks prayed.
,,A great chinatown,4.0,,Around the world any China town is worth the visit for the colour and if you're into street food also a bite to eat. As you would expect Singapore has a great China town so it's worth a visit if only for a half day. We also found some great restaurants and bars in China Town
,,Late post,5.0,,"Spent few hrs here. A lot of shops for the souvenir hunters, standard tourist items, not pricey. Some restaurants in area with good looking food and great prices. Cold beer a must in this hot climate. Very chill atmosphere and welcoming for shoppers or browsers. We went in evening two separate times and it was chill no issues for take home souvenirs."
,,Oh the food,5.0,,Great shopping great food fantastic folk . What more could you want and a great way to kill a warm night turn up around 6 for shopping then about 9 have a great feed then back outside to walk the dtreets for a while

,,good for street food,3.0,,"a good place to have the street food, we had the soft shell crab which was lovely. not a great deal to do but worth a visit as it will only take an hour to get around"
,,Visitors love smiles,2.0,,"I love going to Chinatown because I love the foods and the items you can buy from the shops. However, not all Chinatown are the same I must say. Sometimes, you enjoy visiting a place not only because of what you can see and experience but more so of the people you meet or encounter along the way. Unfortunately, it was not a so nice experience for us. We probably encountered 4 or 5 locals inside the market or food court whose gestures or tone could be perceived as unfriendly and not nice towards visitors. We felt that they did not want our business or presence. No smiles at all. Sad. But this did not dampen our spirits because we went to other nice places in Singapore and met really nice people."
,,Chinatown,5.0,,"We went at night very busy. Loads of places to eat and Souvenier Shop well worth a visit, especially if you are hungry."

,,You gotta do it,4.0,,There's a Chinatown area in every city and this is no exception. Good little group of markets and shops with great prices and bargaining. Smith street is great and there is a perfect hawker food centre on level 2. Very interesting wander around the fresh food markets on the bottom floor too. Theres a few temples in the area too so don't forget your camera.
,,Quaint part of Sg,4.0,,"Charming area. Chinatown Complex is really old and is stuck in time. Some shoplots are gentrified - refurbished old charms with modern elements. A few bars, eateries and massage parlors around."
,,Tour,5.0,,After visiting Little India we went to visit Chinatown to learn the history of the Chinese in Sungapore and see the sights. We stopped at a little restaurent and had a traditional meal Loved the atmosphere
,,It's ok la,4.0,,Cheap souvenirs and lots of restaurants to choose in case you're hungry. But it's not as great as Bugis street. And the shop vendors in bugis street is much more likeable than in China town lol. Just my opinion.
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"This place is astonishing, so busy and vibrant you need a good half a day if not a full one to do it justice. Be very careful of the heat and humidity take plenty of water and keep having a sit down, honestly its imperative to do this. Some wonderful eating places and great traditional shops."
,,Nearly best chinatown on the world.,4.0,,Like all Singapore this is clean place different others chinatowns what i see before.Prices and quality is good.Butha temple is very atractive.

,,A must!,5.0,,"Visited via the Hop on/off bus. Lots to see and do. Colourful and interesting buildings. fun experience. Loved the market and the hustle bustle of the place.
Sri Mariamman Temple is in Chinatown - well worth the visit to this Hindu temple. You will need to leave your shoes outside. wraps and cover ups available if not suitably dressed. It was a wonderful cultural experience filled with colour and sound.
Great photo opportunities. Found it to be an interesting and welcoming place."
,,Great fun,5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is vibrant, colourful and, unlike Chinatown in Bangkok safe. We are in smith street at the street cafes and the food is good but check your change!! It is definitely worth a visit"
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"Chinatown is a must visit, even if just to get away from the hustle and bustle of tourist timetables. Great to just walk among stalls and have delicious snack of noodles and beer for a very reasonable price (great in Singapore) Lots of bargains if you feel inclined.
Fairly central so easy to walk from our hotel and a few others.You can walk through to Buddhist Temple ( tooth relic), bit touristy but still nice to see one."

There are plenty of options for eating as well. There are some restaurants which provide vegetarian options as well.

,,"shops selling cheap goods, but okay food",3.0,,Wandered down the food street and found the shops selling things of no interest (mostly cheap goods for tourists). However we stopped for lunch and had a good meal.
,,Compact and clean,4.0,,"This enclave of about a dozen streets is a hive of activity, with shops and restaurants spilling over into the streets. It is fascinating just to wander. The buildings are well-preserved and the pavements good. Do look out for some if the landmark buildings: a mosque; a Hindu temple; a Chinese arch; etc."

,,Interesting,3.0,,"Interesting, but no different from other Chinatowns. San Francisco's much better. Not a ""don't miss."""

,,Same same and more of the same,3.0,,Chinatown is Chinatown in any of these cities. This was fine but nothing to distinguish it from others.
,,Chinatown,4.0,,The area showcases what once to be the settlement of chinese immigrants in Singapore. I believe its one of the better preserved places in terms of ambience. Altho has become a commercial area the ambience is still there with the hanging lanterns and shops selling chinese products. Just walk around to get the feel and food to feast on.

,,Area worth visiting,4.0,,"Nice area with some shops and bars, souvenir streets. It also has a Buddhist temple and a Hindu temple. One of the must sees in town."
,,Great place to try Durian!,5.0,,"During a 12 day business trip to Singapore, we went to China Town three times. It is conveniently located on the MRT and you come up right in the middle of it. If you go on a rainy day, you can mostly stay covered walking shop to shop. The first time we went was to meet some local colleagues for lunch at the China Point mall (DTF - highly recommend) & shopping at China Town, the second was to take another visitor to try the same restaurant and shopping, and then the third was to pick up the item I missed due to my indecisiveness on prior visits. Compared to other markets in Asia Pacific (like the weekend market / Asiatique in Bangkok), this one is not as big or good - however we obviously liked it enough to go multiple times. During our first trip, we also stopped at a shop that sells Durian (which conveniently provides gloves to protect you from the smell) and two of us tried it for the first time. Very cool experience (does not smell or taste as bad as expected), but be forewarned, the Durian is not cheap since it is imported like everything else in Singapore. We spent $75 Singapore for one Durian and 8 delicious juice drinks (watermelon, sugar cane, and coconut). I also wanted to buy an original glass Christmas ornament that had classic Singapore scenes painted on the inside (Merlion Park and the Marina Bay Hotel). It was priced at $18 and I ultimately paid $15. The reason for sharing this is that the ornament caught my eye during the first visit and I therefore meant to buy it the second time, but when I stopped by the shop after 9pm, sadly the shop was already closed - I therefore had to go back. My advice, if you see something unique that you want to buy -- get it then. Also, it is very hot during the day but quite pleasant in the evenings."
,,Amazing market place,5.0,,This is literally your one stop place if your wanting to purchase souveniers and purchase delicious food at very affordable rices. Loved how all the stalls were set out and was surpris3d at how cheap everything was. Its definitely a must visit!
,,Amazing,5.0,,"What a gem the street food, atmosphere and drinks are amazing.. brilliant to walk around and enjoy a look or some really cheap but flavoursome food well worth a look"
,,Best part of Singapore!,5.0,,Don't go there early as they only really fire up about 11.00am. But best place for gift shopping or clothes. Can buy cheap foods such as curry puffs and dumplings from local stalls. Much cheaper than buying from cafes.
,,So busy,5.0,,Love the hussel and bussel of Chinatown. Be prepared to bring plenty of cash. So much to look at and possibly buy. Can barter down. We had Dinner here also and was lovely. Looked after us very well.
,,Colourful!,5.0,,"Interesting walk around here. Lots of stalls, food and souvenirs. Had an amazing meal at Fatty Wengs restaurant, really good food you must try it!"
,,Market place,4.0,,"For anyone seeking markets for a ramble and souvenirs just pop down to Chinatown. We did a bit of shopping, had some food and visited a temple. It's like a one stop shop. We found better deals here for gifts than on Orchard Road obviously. I even got a couple of Singapore Christmas decorations. People are lovely and friendly. Felt very safe here while exploring."
,,Evening stroll & dinner,5.0,,This is an amazing place. Lots of great shops and restaurants. The food is vast with so much to choose from. They even had Thai style jelly fish in a menu!! I didn't try it though!!! What we did eat was delicious.
,,Food and shop frenzy!,4.0,,A great place to visit if you are looking to get an overview of the cultural history of Singapore and Chinatown (heritage centre). A large variety of nic nac shops and there's even a Tin Tin in Chinatown store of imported collectibles and gifts worth a peak if you're a fan. The Chinatown complex has a large variety of hawker style food stalls - if there's a long queue/ large local crowd it's more likely than not to be good. There's a fruit and drink shop selling local fruits including durians - the king of fruits. Always good if you're into it. Worth a trip - including a visit to a nice local coffee shop (kopitiam) and a shop selling vey authentic Singaporean pineapple tarts.
,,Crazy busy,4.0,,"I went there on the weekend there were alot of people. The products they had for sale were similar in most stores if you are looking for a small gift to take home this is the place. Try to go during the week , we went back and I found it was cheaper."
,,Pretty average during the day - maybe at night?,3.0,,"We made a visit to Chinatown under the illusion it was one of the better Chinatowns in Asia. While it was busy and bustling and hustling, there was not much there you cannot see or do a markets across the world and you cannot help feeling that the original concept of Chinatown has been lost in the perpetuation of roadside markets in every country patronised by modern gypies selling the same old watches, clothes and wallets on different days in different places. Perhaps Singapore's Chinatown gets more colourful and lively at night and I'm not one to try to put people off trying places for themselves. But for me I think once is enough."
,,A great place just to slowly walk the streets.,5.0,,"Our hotel was right by the entrance to China Town. Unlike other ""China Towns"" around the world, the street food vendors here reflect what Singapore is all about; clean and orderly. It had that intense fast-paced vibe that every China Town we have ever visited has. Tourists should slowly eat and shop their way around this fascinating part of Singapore."
,,Must do,5.0,,"Yes it is a bit tacky but fun to see. Walked through the streets at night looking for refreshment, plant on offer. Shops are very tourist focused and have little of any value other than as a cheap souvenir."
,,i thought i was in china,4.0,,"It was very traditional, even I see a dead on the streets. Someone died and the body was semi exposed to the rest of the chinese comunity. Prices fair for food"
,,Obviously!!!!,5.0,,"No comment necessary really, it is so obvious that when in Asia Chinese food is the default food. So so cheap and who wouldn't want to drink Tiger beer with a beef fried rice. The whole are is full of hawker stalls and little shops, great fun and felt very safe."
,,CHINATOWN--- Singapore,5.0,,"In an explosive growth over the last 30 years, CHINATOWN is largely as it was when I was last here in 1971... However, my tastes have changed much.

,,Looking for Souvenirs?,4.0,,"All things Chinese can be found here. Endless shopping stalls with a variety of gift selections. You can even have a suit made to measure on the spot.

"
,,Must have a meander here!,4.0,,"Hint: start off at the Temple of the tooth. It's a good place to start and the tourist information centre for Chinatown is there. We went through the temple at about 6pm and was amazed at how empty it was. Good photo ops abound. Then we meandered through the stall of Chinatown. Full of interesting crap! Some good, some cheap stuff, some overpriced, some not. Very cheerful people doing the selling. Then we walked to the food area and stopped at Fatty Wengs for supper. Great place for peopl watching!"
,,Eye opening,5.0,,"Visited during the Lunar festival. Everything was decorated for that. It was an eye opener for sure for me. The whole area was alive with locals absolutely everywhere. I was told they were buying their supplies for the festival. Not so many tourists in the market areas. However, tourists were in the food areas. The food is cheap and yum. We went for breakfast there everyday. Sometimes, we'd grab a snack too on the way back to the hotel. The teens loved their bubble teas too."
,,Beautiful at night,4.0,,"This place is beautiful. Especially at night. I haven't really tried the food there, but all of the cheap clothes, bags and souvenirs seem like a paradise to European tourists."
,,Robust of culture,5.0,,"I love Chinatown, as it is :

4) The MRT is closeby to travel to other destinantions."

,,Huge noisy Chinese style market place),5.0,,"The largest market (as we were said) in Singapore. There you may find everything you may imagine: from souvenirs, clothes, bags, accessories to beauty salons, street food and restaurants. I'd say, it's the best place to shop for souvenirs!"

It's covers quite a large area and several streets have been converted into pedestrian-only areas, lined with souvenir shops and Chinese stalls selling everything imaginable.

Great place to pick up personally tailored shirts at a reasonable price, made in a matter of hours."
,,Busiest /Decorated/Chinese cuisines/variety of Teas,5.0,,"Best place to shopping barging. Best time to visit is during Spring festival. Market around the china town is decorated with huge lanterns in shape of Chinese Zodiac animal. Walk around the street you will that you are at the set of some old Chinese movie.
Many things to buy at cheaper price for friends and famliy at home.
Best place for shopping and snacking for tourist.
There is lady selling beverages e.g collers and some wafers at end of China town, I never had such tasty coolers in my life time."
,,Variety of items to purchase and types of stores but food prices high,4.0,,"There was a much greater variety of items to purchase and types of stores than other Chinatowns we have visited; however, the food was priced higher than expected. A lunch was approximately $20-$25 SGD. It was very clean, ornate, closer to transit, close to several of the Chinatown Temples and was not chaotic like other Chinatowns. We enjoyed our visit here!"
,,Vibrant,5.0,,"This district has no high rise buildings- just old shop houses and culture bursting out into the streets. Such a contrast to the SBD. Smell the fragrance of traditional cuisine and see the bold red and gold tones that run through the neighbourhood. This is an area that’s proud of its heritage, and has it very much on display. These busy streets encapsulate all the sights and sounds visitors expect of Chinatown, with hundreds of stalls selling everything from silk robes to lucky cats. There are plenty of ‘Made in China’ goods on display and lanterns swaying in the breeze above your head. You must try food from the fantastic range of street cars amongst the many market stalls- crispy duck looks good and fresh dim sum is a must. The market is open all the day, but it looks its most picturesque at dusk, with the lights shining brightly and the sound of hawkers tempting you to check out their wares. You must try your bargaining skills to get a better price but remember to do it with a smile.There are ornate Chinese, Buddhist and Hindu temples, museums galore and plenty of opportunities to soak up the bustling streets lined with old shop houses. Shop houses used to have the vendors selling their goods on the streets and sleeping in the rooms above at night, sometimes many people in the one room."
,,Chinatown Singapore,5.0,,Good eats in Chinatown and street shopping with many different inexpensive trinkets to buy. Easy to get there by MRT.
,,I love Chinatown,5.0,,a must to see when in Singapore and easily accesible. Be sure to try one of the Hawker Food Courts for a taste of local cuisine. We really like Maxwell Market Food Court and especially the Hiannesse Chicken Rice. The one with the line was involved in a food cook off with Gordon Ramsey and the Hawker won. Very basic and tasty.
,,chinatown singapore,5.0,,"eclectic mix of traders, buskers, restaurants and people make a visit to Chinatown Singapore a unique and unforgettable experience"
,,A little bit of everything with Chinatown!,5.0,,"From the food, to the temples and sights, you get a little bit of everything in Chinatown. It's all so varied and diverse, and you can find yourself lost for half a day in this place. Really rich in culture."
,,Well worth going,4.0,,"We had our hotel in Chinatown, so strolled through it a lot. It is probably the best place to taste a large variety of food both in 'eat street' (Smith Street) and the countless restaurants. The Chinese Buddhist temple is well worth a visit. A must do when in Singapore."
,,EVERYTHING AT YOUR FINGERTIPS,5.0,,Huge choice of material to look through and buy if you ant from jewellery to cameras to close to snow globes. Great places to eat as well
,,This place will make you poor,4.0,,"Great place for shopping small stuffs, gifts and other necessary things. They offer tricky and attractive promotions which will entice you to buy more. Good place to find things and comparatively cheaper."

,,What you'd expect from any China Town,4.0,,"China Town and the Hawkers Markets were high on my list of things to see and I'm glad that I went early in the morning before the hoards of other tourists descended on it.

I took a short taxi ride from my hotel and kind of went with the flow with no plan in mind. China Town is a maze of streets. My first impression was ""oh dear"" when I was confronted by an adult shop, which made me giggle, but thankfully it was the only one I saw. Thereafter it was all about nic-nacs and trinkets. Don't be fooled into thinking everything is cheap; they aren't. It pays to look around. I found one bracelet that I thought about buying for my daughter which was quite expensive. I moved on to find another one about 30 minutes later that was 80% cheaper!

There are the odd $1 shop, and other more touristy types blended in. I even ran into an Indian tailor that Bill Clinton had bought a suit from.

A great place to go. I wanted to try some market food but opted not to. Other tourist sites (temples) etc are nearby.

Worth the visit."
,,A traditional CNY shopping site,5.0,,"Every year I may tried to make a trip with friends to Chinatown and scroll around stall to stall, even trying sample of Taiwan agar agar and sweets, peanuts and pineapple tarts! all these delicacies are meant to be put on the family unit table for guests and mostly kids running around during house visits to eat and adults catching up with one another after a year hard work with busy schedules. It is a nice tradition to hold!"
,,A must to experience,5.0,,"Allow at least two hours to wander this area and take in the sights and smells of the area. Better still stop off in one of the restaurants or hawker stalls and sample the culinary delights. If you have plenty of time visit the Heritage Museum and experience what life in a Shop House would have been like, it is a great museum"
,,OK for a wander,3.0,,Lots of the same shop over and over again - don't get me wrong I did indulge in a bit of light retail therapy and it is better than the main malls on Orchard Street but just as something to do. Lots of food stands as well so good snacking opportunities. We did suffer a deluge though and the perspex ceiling in the food area does not stop the rain!
,,Great Food and very busy!,4.0,,"We are staying just a few blocks from Chinatown on New Bridge Street, and we went walking into Chinatown just a few hours after we arrived. The shops were just opening at 10 a.m., but the aromas from the cooking pots were already emanating through the streets.We had a great walk, did a little some shopping, and even found a place to eat where English was barely known -- we love eating in those places!"
,,Gifts,4.0,,This is where you go if you need to purchase gifts for your family and friends back home. You can also get great food at a good price.
,,"Busy, Bustling and Lots of Bargains",4.0,,"Visited Chinatown 2 times during our time in Singapore. Be prepared for crowds and bargaining. Lots of the same type of trinkets to purchase but good to be in the hustle and bustle of it all, if only for a short period of time."
,,"Classic Chinese food, cheap souvenirs",5.0,,"My guess is that everyone visits Chinatown in Singapore. The historic architecture, the inexpensive shopping, and the affordable food are all reasons why everyone loves this area."
,,Hidden restaurants and pubs keep you coming back for more!,5.0,,"I have spent nearly a year working in the Chinatown area, and I still feel I haven't explored as much.

Be it the dumplings in the Chinatown Complex, to the Schezuan restaurants lining Mosque street, and speak easy bars hidden in the various shop houses, Chinatown is a food lovers paradise.

During Lunar New Year, this place is decorated and buzzing with various food stalls and shops. Really worth a visit."
,,our holiday,5.0,,We have been to China town on several times and it always amazes us on how popular it is. Also how good the shopping is. There is something there for everyone. Culture colour and excitment.
,,Wonderful!,5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is the best we've experienced in our 4 country trip through Singapore, Kuala Lampur, Ho Chi Minh and Bali. There are lots of vendors - though, beware of the Durian fruit ice cream - we found it to be terrible ( though, we didn't like Durian fruit at all).

Lots of great vendors and street food. I also ended up getting 4 custom suits made, while my sister in law got pants and my brother a custom shirt.

Highly recommended!"
,,Go with a guide,5.0,,"Go with a guide, we had a great tour with Simon, a local from a firm called Indi Tours who really explained the history and what we were looking at. On our own it would have been colourful but with Simon we learnt and saw so much we would never have known or even noticed. If you have any interest in the history then use Indi Tours they are great fun and great value."
,,My Chinatown!,5.0,,"This is one of my favourite haunts in Singapore. In fact, I was just there an hour ago. Got my skin care products at People's Park, a shopping complex, then had 2 bowls of local desserts nearby. A bowl of gingko nuts with logan soup and then to top it all off, a bowl of green bean soup with some sweet potato. I luv it, as it stops the hunger pangs. Then I went across the street to Chinatown Point and got a swiss roll.

Yes, there are many Chinese restaurants and eateries and they are good. This is real Chinese food. No moo goo gai pan, ok? The majority of the local population are ethnically Chinese. Our forefathers came from southern China and brought all their cuisines with them.

There's Chinese medicine shops, shops grilling BBQ pork slices, call bak qua. Fruit stands, small bakeries, cobblers can mend your shoes while shop and eat. A huge department store called OG, has everything from clothes to suitcases. I just bought a pair of silver shoes.

Transportation is very good in Singapore too. Most of us take the subway to Chinatown station. Or you can opt for the bus or taxis.

There's Food Street and it is open in the evenings too. Mostly, local food from all different races. You can sit outside and have beer served to you while you take pictures and watch the world go by. If pubs and bars are your preference, there are plenty of those too.

Just because it is Chinatown, you can find a mosque and a Hindu temple located in the area. Very ornate and popular with tourists. Nearby is also our downtown banking area called Shenton Way. It is within walking distance and you can see the contrast of old and new Singapore!

Don't worry if you run out of cash, lots of banks have their atm here. Moneychangers are plenty too. There are several 3 to 4 stars hotels stretching over a few streets in total.

Anyways, just check on the internet and you can find all the information about our chiantown"
,,Perfect place for tasty Singapore food,5.0,,Lots to see in colourful Chinatown. We ate Singapore chilli crab a couple of nights along with other fabulous local food washed down by Tiger beer. The streets of Chinatown are filled with shops selling clothes and all kinds of souvenirs and when your tired of walking step in for foot spa and little fish will tickle your toes!
,,Turist,5.0,,"You can see everything you want made in China. All the arts and crafts of China. All the silk, jewelry clothes you name it. Great place to bargin and they speak English very well."

There's Culture and Arts, as well as night life. Good souvenirs to buy back for friends and relatives. A must place to go and enjoy the atmosphere and ambience."
,,Quaint Street,5.0,,"Best to visit during the 2 weeks preceding Chinese New Year. The entire steet in converted into a huge..messy and utterly fun filled bazaar.

On normal days..Chinatown is still an awesome place to visit with quaint souvenir shops along the entire street. Take in the unique architecture. This was the place where the traditional Chinese colony settled when they migrated from China to Singapore. Feeling hot? There are small joints selling local fare and drinks. Take in the sights..sounds and smells of Chinatown here.

There is also a really really cute shop that sells everything ""TinTin"". The comic character. Scale Models..posters...cards...books could all be found in this marvellous shop. My kids love walking around this shop. A trip to the famous tintin shop is a mist for us when we visit Chinatown.2 thumbs up."
,,Place with a mixed of local and tourist shops.,4.0,,"Great place to visit and understand the local culture. The shops are a mixture of authentic local and tourist shop, so be careful when shopping. After cheap food when you are in the area, try the Chinatown Complex Food Centre. Food is cheap and you got a choice of local food. There even a Michelin Star food stall in the centre."
,,Variety Chinatown,5.0,,"We just love coming to Chinatown. There are so many varieties food for breakfast, snack, lunch, sweet, or dinner. Besides, you could shop for anything there."
,,It's ok.,3.0,,"It's a special chinatown because it's pretty clean but it's also quiet boring. The streets are narrow comparing to other chinatowns i've been. It's ok if there is nothing special to do, but if not, it's not a miss."
,,Hustle and bustle,3.0,,Chinatown is very busy and colourful and worth the experience. Easily reached by hoho tour bus or public transport. We thought we would try some street old while there but we're disappointed at the quality and expensive bill.
,,Chinatown - great walk around the streets,5.0,,"Chinatown is a great place to walk around and get good value street food. There are a lot of souvenir shops and stalls, but it has not lost its culture completely. There is some great architecture and the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and the Sri Mariamman Temple are worth a visit."
,,Pasalubong small gifts,4.0,,Best to buy pasalubong key chains ref magnet tshirts and others. Cheaper than little india. Also they have signs and you can haggle.
,,China western srtyle,3.0,,"An overated touristic area, mostly populated by westerners. Many cheap gift shops that can be found anywhere in the world, selling anything. Many cheap Chinese restaurants, the main attraction maybe...Nothing so special about the area."
,,one of my fav neighborhoods,5.0,,"our hotel was near chinatown and I had a lot of fun exploring this neighborhood. Its on the larger side with some sections being exceedingly disneyified and tourist oriented while others being authentically local.

There are many food courts in the area and your standard tourist shops. Unique architecture and a lot of people watching to enjoy"
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"Definitely worth having a look around, there a plenty of street stalls which will happily sell you cheap watches and pens and lots of other nick-knacks. There are also plenty of food stalls which sell really cheap, and good, food. The beer is much cheaper here than at the hotel !!"
,,Singapore Chinatown,4.0,,This is a fun place to visit. For us Singapore is the safest city in the world so when you walk around the bustling streets you feel very comfortable. The food is cheap and very good as well as interesting buildings that show the local history.
,,OK,3.0,,This was quite interesting but a bit scruffy and smelly in places. It was also not that easy to get to from the MRT
,,Good fun shopping and food.,4.0,,"One of the places to go shopping in Singapore. The souvenirs are mostly the same as other places, but how do you find that special thing if you don't look? Perhaps it's here. It has the only Michelin- star street food stall, which we didn't try as we'd just had our lunch! Will try it next time we go. The temple is worth a look, too."
,,Must seee/visit,5.0,,We spent a morning visiting this area of Singapore- just out of curiosity. What surprised us is that we thought that most of the people/stallholders would be Chinese. In fact the majority were Indian. Also got some lovely buys.
,,Chinatown us a must see!,5.0,,"This is the best Chinatown I have been to!
Lots of markets for souvenirs! We bought gifts for family and friends
And it was extremely affordable
There are also several restaurants that offer great Chinese food!

Not in the best shape of the ones I have seen, but a must see anyway!"
,,A great place,4.0,,"I love this place. Markets that offer all your souvenir needs, especially if you're Indonesian and after oleholeh. Food food food, and it's cheap and easy to get to. Close to the city, Little India, Orchard Road, etc. MRT is right there. Good hotels. What can I say? Go to the Chinatown Heritage Centre it's great."
,,Nice place,4.0,,Watch for guys that sell electronics! Most probably fakes just go and see the beautiful culture and amazing food
,,Why not see Chinatown by taking a trishaw night ride,5.0,,"Take a trip round Chinatown on a trishaw including Yum Cha dinner. Our tour guide, Sawi, explained the history of Chinatown and was able to answer all our questions. Our trishaw ride took us to Clarke Quay for a boat ride up the river. A great way to spend an evening in Singapore"
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Typical Chinese market area, with fruit and vegetables for sale, plus all the usual things available in a Chinese market. Very busy and sometimes the hawkers can be a bit pushy. 78% of Singaporeans are Chinese, so to see the 'real' Singapore it's recommended."
,,Interesting walk,4.0,,"I would definitely recommend spending a couple of hours walking around China Town. Brilliant place to eat lots of restaurant and hawker court. Good place to buy souvenirs we brought some beautiful chop sticks from a chop stick shop where the woman spent time tell us what all the different designs meant which was actually quite interesting.

Really easy to access from the train station."
,,More than you think,5.0,,This was our first trip into Singapore and our hotel was a 10 minute walk so.....what an amazing experience. Small stalls selling everything some unique items as well as the usual tourist traps. There is a fast food place with a Michelin star and another stall that is part of a chain that makes what I will say is like a jerky but Asian style in sheets. Haggling is expected. The area gets lots of tourists you can get there by the MRT expect to spend a good 5 hours and if you get hot duck into the mall for some relief
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,Great food great shopping. The best place for both is the area around Smith and Temple Sts lots of food variety and lots of bargains.

,,Good spot for beers and souvenir shopping on a Sunday afternoon,5.0,,Wasted a Sunday afternoon here drinking beers and shopping for inexpensive souvenirs. Worth the $7 Uber ride from Orchard Road.

The colours are fantastic, bright and shining with Chinese Lanterns everywhere and shops filled with traditional Chinese decorations. There are so many shops selling such a wide variety of goods, food, clothing, tourist items, electronics, ancient Chinese medical stores and so much more. On top of that there is the ever present aroma of food being cooked, we have eaten here many times and always found the food to be excellent. One of the best things you can do is to sit at a cafe and just people watch."
,,"A good place to see the ""original Chinatown""",4.0,,I enjoyed the Cultural side of the visit and bought some nice tailored shirts. The Cultural centre and fre guidd tour filled in a lot of gaps in my knowledge. Slowly being changed by modern hotels.
,,Food heaven,3.0,,"Our hotel just few minutes from China Town. As other china town in other country, we can find lots of food here. I call it dtreet food as this kind of food i normally find on the street. You can find many type of chinese food here. All look delicious. But if you are kind of OCD person, then its nit good place for you to eat. Service standard. Like food court. We can find traditional medicine and antique things from here.
For those who doesnt like Durian, please be prepare to hold your breath as they sell it in few corner.
Dried meat also available here. All cook in Chinese style. I saw people queuing for that.
Please prepare to bring water, tissue as it might be really hot here.
Its good place to visit with friends who love to eat. It will be fun if you come and try all the food.
I just try ice kachang with durian as its really hot day.
this place are interesting."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Take the MRT, exit at Pagoda Street and Chinatown stretches out in front of you. Rows of stalls, including tailors that can make you a suit in just over a day.

Just off of Pagoda Street is a street full of Chinese restaurants and street food stalls. We ate at a small restaurant at 14 Smith Street. A little expensive but very tasty food."
,,Vibrant and colourful!,4.0,,"Visited during the Chinese New Year 2017 - The year of the Rooster! Shop for souvenirs, clothes and all that you can think of and explore club street during the night.

,,Busy and fun,5.0,,This was a great day out - was very busy just before Chinese new year. The only place in Singapore where there were signs warning you to watch your bags.
,,Day trip,5.0,,"It was a hot day. People were very friendly and you weren't waiting for long. We also tried a Singapore style breakfast which a lot of the locals have according to the waiter ( sorry can't remember what it's called) but it was different and sweet ... the idea was too dip the type of sweet bread into the egg mixture and eat. Went down well with the iced coffee lots of souvenirs which are well priced. Did also note a lot of herbal tea and herbal medicine places, didn't buy anything though, was concerned it would pass customs. All in all a great place to experience a great culture."
,,Here you can find all sort of stuff from china,4.0,,"Best time to go is during Chinese New Year. A lot of pop up stalls all on the roadsides. The setback is they are selling almost the same food stuff which does not taste very nice. Other times of the year this is the place to go if u are looking to buy singapore souvenirs, try authentic Chinese food especially spicy food from Sichuan as well as Chinese foot massage. Prices are very competitive. Definitely a must see place if you come to singapore"
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Walked around the Chinatown area with my son. There are traditional medical shops selling interesting goods e.g. dried geckos,tree barks and crocodile meat amongst the souvenirs shops. The wet market basement is quite an eye opener with stalls selling frogs, turtles and eels for consumption."
,,A veritable blend of aromas and colours...,5.0,,"I only wish I had the time to eat in all of the Authentic restaurants around here, the atmosphere is buzzing and the aromas of food are irresistable, it is a very lively and happy place, and very romantic, and the people are friendly and allways smiling, The service is also exceptional everywhere, and the colours and decour, and night scene brilliant..."

,,Chinese New Year Celebrations!,5.0,,The decor & ambience during CNY week is a must do in Singapore. Street shopping is quite famous. One can smell food (non-vegetarian) and fragrances (essence & oils)
,,This is the good place,5.0,,Decorative by a lots of colours banners. Looks nice. Very nice to catch local a traction. Good place.
,,A whole new meaning to Chinese takeaway,5.0,,"Busy, colourful, exciting and a must for all visitors. A large Tiger beer and local delicacy chilli crab was the highlight of my day. Plenty of stalls for shopping at fabulous prices and money changing, if you run short, is also available at excellent rates."
,,Singapore Chinatown,4.0,,"Better than the China town in Kuala Lumpur, not so many breeches of international copyright law and production of counterfeit goods. Still, it doesn't lag far behind. Easier to find better quality food and drink. An interesting stroll. Aparently the Chinatowns of the world are where the homeless are living and an indication of how the government treats its unemployed, disabled and elderly and whether tax dollars have ensured an adequate social security system. Singapore claims to be a rich city. In what way?"
,,Puppet Show,5.0,,"I love Chinatown! Every time I'm in Singapore I go there. The food, massages, entertainment and shopping are always fun!!! I purchase T-shirts for my family back home every time and the quality is great! This time we saw a puppet show. It was a first for me!"
,,Best area to stay during CNY,4.0,,"best area to stay during Chinese New Year season with all the shops, stores and restaurants. Easy access to metro and malls."
,,Love this place,5.0,,Love Chinatown and get there as often as I can. Always something new to see. The display this year for year of the rooster was just amazing.
,,A vibrant China town,4.0,,We visited in Chinese New Year and although is was crowded and very busy it was still enjoyable looking at the stall and eating there. I would suggest not visiting on the eve of Chinese New Year. The trains run right to the beginning of China Town.
,,Everything here,5.0,,"If you are looking for some souvenirs at a resonable price in Singapore this should be the only place to go. Full of nice offers, especially"" 3 of something for 10 dollars"". Don't buy at the first sight, better take first a tour through shopes then decide what to buy and from where. Also in Chinatown is the cheapest beer in Singapore(6-7sing dollars) so...say yes for a beer there then crying for a 15-20 dollars beer in other places :))"
,,Vibrant and colorful!,4.0,,"The Chinatown MRT (metro rapid transit) station opens up right into Chinatown. It very colorful in the market area - some good deals are available. Lots of choices of places to stop and eat.
We visited the SRI MARIAMMAN TEMPLE and the THIAN HOCK KENG - the first is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore and the second is the oldest Chinese temple - both very interesting to see.
A visit to Chinatown is a definite must!"
,,Fun walk,5.0,,"Got in one evening after work. There are streets full of vendors selling goods. I got some dried foods, the ambient is good."
,,Interesting Area,4.0,,Chinatown is a colorful area filled with many shops & restaurants. It provides travellers with an opportunity to visit the Chinese community which had a significant presence in the past.The area has been revitalized and many of the buildings have been renovated & modernized. It is easily accessible by the Metro subway with nearby stations. Eating & drinking seems to be the main activity therefore there are many restaurants & bars where you can order a variety of Chinese & Singaporean dishes. Running through the area is a pedestrian mall closed off to traffic with many shops for shopping. There are a variety of items/goods which you can purchase and one of the specialties in Singapore is the freshly made jerky. I definitely recommend a visit to Chinatown as one of your stops when visiting Singapore.
,,Best Chinese Tradition on Show,5.0,,"Nice place. It has many small and big fancy items that people can dream about. Nice clothes, jewellery, dream catchers, pedicure, massage centers, beauty centers, Nail art, Tattoo artists, Clothes artists, fancy hair accessories/papers/colors/art stuff/ home decors/glitters etc etc... Really cheap and colorful things available here. Nice chinese food and ingredients/spices can be found.

There is a big chinese-hindu sort of temple with interesting idols and statues and gods. The entire streets are well decorated with red gold colors and lights through out the year. However, the best time to come here is during chinese new year. The decorations, the food, the music, the colors, the dragon dance, ethnic dresses, red and gold glittering clothes, furnitures and decors are breath taking."
,,Lucky to be here for the New Year,5.0,,"This is a great and authentic Chinatown. We stayed at the Park Royal Pickering, a great hotel that is within a short walking distance to Chinatown. The outdoor bazaar however, was not a good shopping experience as the merchandise was too cheap and repetitive. We did eat dinner at an indoor restaurant that was pretty average. The visit is best enjoyed as a cultural experience. We were very fortunate to be there at the New Year, so many decorations were out for this event."
,,Colourfull as always,4.0,,"Being in Singapore a visit to Chinatown is a must. Going there in daytime you can enjoy the many colourful shops and stalls, going there in the nighttime you see the lights and feel the nice atmosphere."
,,💗 food courts,5.0,,"For me Singapore is not so much about shopping (centers), or about the heat, nor about the architecture (I had been told this would be the WOW factors of the city), as it is about the food. There's great food at virtually any corner, ranging from shockingly cheap to crazy expensive. The hawker centers in Chinatown (food centers) are great places to experience the flavor and diversity of Singaporean food. As well as the local food culture which appears to involve everyone eating constantly & at-all-times & non-stop!!! In Chinatown we cued for almost 2 hours at the Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle, the first street-food place in Asia to receive a Michelin Star (appreciated for it's tender and juicy chicken rice dish), but the offer everywhere around in this massive food hawker place was very-very interesting. Based on diversity, flavors, atmosphere and prices, Chinatown Singapore definitely gets a 10 on my foodie list."
,,Lunar New Year shopping in Chinatown,4.0,,"Hustle and bustle of Lunar New Year preparations. The ambience of the festivities hit you right in the heart of Chinatown. Vendors shouting the sales, bright red lanterns hung up high and new year goodies aplenty for you to try even if you do not want to buy, have a taste and praise!!"
,,Cheap Souvenir,4.0,,Located within the Outram district in the Central Area of Singapore .Must go to chinatown. you can get very cheap souvenir here $1- $3.
,,Cheshiresupermum,5.0,,Has a market which is worth a visit lots of different goods to see. You can have a suit or dress etc handmade if you want. Suits range from S$250-450 ish. Lots of places to eat. Market cheapest place to eat and drink. Cheapest beer found at market. Stall holders are friendly but not pushy like previous places we've visited. Some temples to visit in area too. Make sure that you wear tshirt that covers your shoulders if you're intending to visit temples. If you have shorts or short skirt on some temples have wrap round you can borrow.
,,Lost its rustic local touch,3.0,,The place is increasingly filled with tourist traps. The only thing worth going for is the local food and maybe the few shops which sell really cheap & pretty childrens' clothings as well as basic household stuff....
,,fun and interesting area of the city,5.0,,"Shopping, dining (eat in or grab and go), temples, cultural museum- chinatown offers all of the above in abundance."

Except that every thing u see there is costly .
Love the structure , old layouts shops .. chinese temple in china town ..

,,A different Side to Singapore!,4.0,,After spending time in the CBD it was grt to see Chinatown. Definitely worth getting some food from the hawkers! Good quality and best value for sure!
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Visited just after Chinese New Year - simply stunning Hawker market food was also delicious - even if there was tripe and chicken feet!
,,Pleasant Chinatown,4.0,,This Chinatown is very clean and pleasant. Nice streets to walk through. Nice shops too. Do not miss it while you are in Singapore
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,Most tourists end up eating and drinking here because the food is great and far cheaper than the rest of Singapore. Great buzz about the place and the colours and decorations on the stalls are a photographers delight.
,,Very clean and a lot of dhops,4.0,,The only surprise in Chinatown was how clean it was. Many stalls offering all kinds of souvenirs. There's a street just for food. A Hindu temple located just outside of Chinatown is a great place to visit.
,,Authentic? Maybe.,4.0,,"This place has certainly been renovated over the last 20 years or so. Very tacky in some places but it also contains pockets of authentic, old world Singapore."
,,Eat Eat Eat,5.0,,"To get the Chinatown, catch the MRT to Chinatown, simple. Great place where you will find lots of local food to taste and at a good price and not break the bank. It does get busy in the afternoon and evenings, but that's the best time to go as that's when most stalls are open so don't go too early in the morning that's for sure."
,,A must experience,4.0,,"Though we stayed for 5 days in Singapore we only visited 2ice to Chinatown. It's a vibrant place with full of colours, local culture, local cuisine. You may want to visit Chinatown for some bargain shopping as well. Also a lot of good restaurants in Chinatown.

It is comparatively cheaper then other places in Singapore for eating good bugdet food"
,,Great Restaurants and People Watching,4.0,,"This is the place to see other tourists - 1,000's of them! I'm an American who now lives in China, and the Chinese food in Singapore Chinatown is fantastic - and expensive! Chinese people from China come here to eat!

Service appears to be generally good, everyone is friendly, and there's lots of products of China to delight the eye.

If you're looking for quiet and solitude, this is NOT the place! It is crowded and noisy - even compared to China!"
,,Love this place especially prior to Chinese New Year,5.0,,"I come here every year, sometimes a couple of times prior to Chinese New Year to soak up the atmosphere and buy all the goodies, from groundnuts, kuazi to Chinese New Year decorations. I change my cushion covers and table runner design every year. There are many shops that sell a variety of designs so I am spoilt for choices. Never fail to bring my overseas friends and clients here when they are in Singapore."
,,Quaint place,4.0,,"A must see. Very quaint. Mainly consists of a shopping street / market which takes about 15 to walk through (unless shopping). Worth a look, but don't be upset if you don't see it."
,,What is left of Chinatown,4.0,,"To those who, like me, came to Singapore in the very early seventies, whet is left of Chinatown isn't much. To the vast majority of the others it's fun even though it now looks like a vast souvenir shop. The best part is the food and the food stalls
in the evening or the food courts where you can choose from an array of stands."
,,Very Clean Chinatown,5.0,,"This is by the far the cleanest Chinatown I have ever seen. It was so organized, lots to see and buy. If your from north American and you are average size you may find a hard time finding clothes to fit. I am not a large person and they told me I required a 2XXl..lol. so don't get discouraged...lol.."
,,Open even during Chinese New Year,5.0,,The Food Street had stalls opened to satisfy the cravings of many locals and visitors. Thumbs up. It doesn't have to be too many hours but certainly lunch and dinner periods are great.
,,Chinese New Year in Singapore 2017,4.0,,"Lots of locals leave Singapore over the New Year holidays as Chinese Nationals flood into the country to celebrate. Chinatown comes alive with lights, entertainment and decorations to welcome the New Year. The major lights are turned on at 7 o'clock and thousands of people, all with mobiles or cameras, fill the streets to capture the sight. Small restaurants or hawker stalls are the places to eat, we had BBQ duck and a sticky pork which were excellent. Sitting inside in the air conditioning and watching out to the laneway seemed an ideal way to ease ourselves into Chinese New Year. The celebrations involve a spectacular New Years Eve followed by 4 days of public holidays. Celebrations continue over a 2 week period with various different activities and cultural meaning.
The other good thing about locals leaving Singapore is that flights are often cheap for the flight over which is always good."
,,As you might expect,3.0,,Pleasant walk through busy Chinatown streets. Lots and lots of gift shops. Food street looks popular but we didn't eat there. The Buddha tooth (~) temple is very much worth a look. Prefer this to KL's version as this is Chinese rather than Indian!
,,Extensive,4.0,,"This is not just one street, but a whole area, including a temple, devoted to Chinese culture. Many restaurants obviously."
,,Don't miss it,4.0,,"Chinatown should not be missed. If you take the MRT to Chinatown station you will come out in the middle of a shopping street in the heart of Chinatown.
Here we found market type stalls offering all sorts of Chinese wares and clothing.
Also there are two interesting temples including the Buddha tooth temple and Thian Hock KENT temple. They are fascinating.
Loved Chinatown for its hustle and bustle and interesting architecture."
,,A glimpse of old Singapore.,4.0,,"Grab it, before it goes forever under high rise and concrete., buzzing local chinese area with typical shops and good cheap street hawker food. Unfortunately fast disappearing"
,,Trip to Chinatown in Singapore,5.0,,This is a great Chinatown. There are several places to eat and many places to shop. Very good Chinatown to see. One of the best China towns that I have been to.
,,Great fun,4.0,,"Very 'touristy' but great fun to walk around and haggle with the locals in the market. We weren't subject to any hassling from stall holders and every time we spoke to stallholders, it was very good natured"
,,"Color, Culture and Cheap Shops",4.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore then it is compulsory for you to go pay homage to Chinatown. If you like taking photos and selfies - this is definitely the place to visit (plenty of photos opps).

What you should catch:
- The colorful shops with cheap market shops
- Visit the hidden museum
- The Indian Temple
- The Buddhist Temple
- The food court with the best chicken wings"
,,Tacky souvenirs but great Street food,4.0,,"Chinatown in any city is worth a visit and Singapore's version is no different..
Visited just after Chinese New Year and the atmosphere was great with the myriad of decorations and lanterns.
The street vendors were plying their trade with their usual vigour, determined to relieve you of your cash for a range of ""authentic"" souvenirs obviously made in China. Now normally, that would not be the best selling point for souvenirs, but on this occasion, I guess it proves they really are authentic.....
However for me, the highlight is the street food. Smith Street is a Pandora's box of food goodies waiting to be discovered.
Absolute heaven and all made in China...town....probably."
,,Nice place to enjoy Chinese cuisine,5.0,,Very Nice place to enjoy Chinese cuisine. Many diverse dishes from different parts of China are waiting for you. 正宗中餐，样式繁多，在海外要想对得起自己的中国胃就来这里啦！

,,Top places for souvenirs!!,5.0,,"If you want to buy a bunch of souvenirs with a great values for tourist you definitely must visit this place. This place is not very crowded and the place is not a huge places where you can lost in the middle of nowhere, so i can said that this place is the most comfortable place to looking for souvenirs even for your wallet. In this place you can get 42keychain for only 10$S and 7 canvas bag for 10$S!!!"
,,Disappointed,5.0,,"Very tacky ,no atmosphere ,very disappointed with Chinatown ,had been too little India that was fantastic"

,,Don't miss Chinatown Food Street,5.0,,"All of the guides talk about Lau Pa Sat and other hawker centers, which are also very pleasant. But Chinatown Food Street (also known as Smith Street) should not be missed. You will cross it as you walk from the Buddha Tooth Temple to the Sri Mariamman Temple in Chinatown."
,,Chinese shops and local cuisine,5.0,,"It is very big town with a good taste of Chinese shops, restaurant serving local cuisines, and coffee shops. I visited different ceremonies in different locations which served cuisines and were free for public."
,,Gr8 place for food,5.0,,"It's a awesome place for stay, specially for foodie people. A hindu temple also there, should not miss People's park anyone."
,,Chinatown,5.0,,"There are big malls as well as individual shops for best shopping experience in Singapore. Things are cheaper compared to other places like Bugi street or Orchard street. There is no bargain unlike Mustafa but it is much cleaner than Mustafa. You
can get anything & everything here but keep weight of baggage in mind before you buy & also there is limit of INR 8000 per head to buy such gift items otherwise customs will harass you. For liquor, wines it is better to buy in Duty free shops at Changi airport as these items are allowed in excess of luggage. Even such items can be bought in flight too but they accept only credit cards or cash, not travel cards as later are for online use only. Some shops also don't accept travel cards."
,,Chinese New Year in Chinatown!,5.0,,"Wow! The excitement and buzz in Chinatown during CNY. A real taste of the local culture, and the importance of CNY to many people. The streets were chock full of people buying special foods and decorations. Feng Shui experts and Fortune tellers were also doing a roaring trade, with their predictions for the year of the Rooster!"
,,Join the Locals,4.0,,To join the locals for a Chinese meal go to the People's Park Complex (enter at street level from New Bridge Road and head into the food stalls area behind the market tents) or the Chinatown Centre (on the second level after entering from the small plaza in front of Buddha Tooth Relic Temple). There are arrays of stalls with arrays of different food and drink types.
,,Wonderful part of Singapore,5.0,,"Really a must see part of Singapore where you can immerse in the Chinese culture which is an integral part of Singapore heritage and also eat authentic Chinese food at reasonable prices. Walk the streets, mingle with the locals and visit there diverse shops."
,,An eye opener,4.0,,"There is so much to see in Chinatown. A guided tour took three hours and visited both indoor and outdoor markets, cafe's, herbalists, traditional tea ceremonies and temples. A tour gives you the chance of so much more information than walking around by yourself."

,,So much fun to walk around,5.0,,"Leave yourself half a day to wander around the shops, eat the local hawker food and go to the Chinatown museum. So much local culture and local food, which is very cheap. It is a lively crowded fun place to spend a morning or afternoon."
,,"See the ""Wet Market""",4.0,,"Chinatown is worthwhile to see but take time to visit the Wet Market there. It is the market with fish, meat, vegetable and clothing are sold daily. It has a plethora of vendors with live frogs eel, turtles and all sort of meat and vegetables being sold. Get there in the morning when all the booths are open and lots of customers fill the building. It's a little pungent with all the fish and meat. You'll need 30-45 minutes max to visit. The stalls are in the basement of the building."
,,The cheapest Michelin Starred Meal in the World,5.0,,The queue is very long but worth the wait. We were here twice and meal was excellent. Found out the guy who started this restaurant is from Ipoh😀. Highly recommended.
,,Recent visit,5.0,,This was one of my favourite places in Singapore. The food in China town is amazing. I would recommend to anyone visiting to go over and try some of the food from the street stalls.
,,So vibrant and safe,5.0,,"We wandered through the streets one evening, everyone so friendly.
An amazing array of street food on offer, hard work to pick which one to stop and try. We had a fantastic meal made the Chinese food back home taste awful, the flavors brought our taste buds alive.
The street vendors selling their wares are friendly and loud not offended if you just wander around and not buy. The prices are all very good
We felt completely safe and made very welcome to browse and enjoy China Town in its full glory"
,,Well worth visiting,5.0,,We booked a trip on Viator which included a walking tour of China town including an excellent Chinese meal which included vegetarian options. A fun Trishaw ride down to the river and then an excellent and very informative night time river cruise on a Bum boat. It was well worth the effort.
,,Great food experience,5.0,,A must do for great local food at a reasonable price. Easy to get to with mrt.. lots of choice eating in or out. A must do
,,Old World Charm,5.0,,This is quite simply the Best China Town I have ever visited. The Old Wold Architecture has been well preserved and you feel the Culture both visually and through the wonderful smells of Food each Street you walk through.
,,China Market in Singapore,4.0,,"its a Local China Market.
shopkeepers usually have small shops,
and most of the local chinese stuff is available here.
Credit card is not accepted at most of the places here.
So be ready with Singapore Dollars.
most of the shops are street vendors.
its a good place to spend evening.
Chinatown MRT is at north east line."
,,Another One,3.0,,"Enjoyed some photo taking in the afternoon light, but really touristy and to be honest felt this would be far larger and better. I think San Fran has a larger China Town and possibly more authentic than this one"
,,Mix of old and new,5.0,,"A visit to Chinatown is a must if you are interested in street markets, traditional shops and culture. You will also find very intereting museums like Asian Civilisations Museum and the Chinatown Heritage Center. Souvenirs a must on Pagods Street !"
,,A taste of China within SG,5.0,,This is a place where you buy souvenirs. You can see a lot of things to buy. Across is a place to eat. All chineses food you like. Also a place to exchange your money to SG currency.
,,Expensive Crab,4.0,,"After lunch at little Indian in the morning we couldn't resist not going to China Town for dinner. Our original intention was to eat at one of the 100's of restaurants but we soon realized that this place is all about the street food venders.

We had crab in black pepper source and a calamari dish. The calamari portion was big and whilst the Crag looked enormous I was expecting far more for $70.

You need to walk up and down the street to find the best good for your pallet. Some of the venders can be a little short and don't speak much English but the experience is well worth the wait. Make sure you get gloves with the crab or any other finger food that's going to be messy eating."
,,"Neat place, lots of food and shopping !",4.0,,"Our hotel was nearby so we spent some time walking here and checking it out. Great place to visit, lots of food options, great shopping with tons of choices. Well worth the time, great tourist info center here that was VERY helpful,"
,,Chinese new year,5.0,,"China town is always a great place to wander through...there are plenty of places to eat and shop, the food and drinks are very well priced...the MRT is right on the doorstep, when you alight the train you walk straight into the main shopping area."
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,A must see area of Singapore. Bustling streets with loads of handicraft stalls the smells are unbeatable. ..so much atmosphere. Feels very safe as does all of the city. Lots of food stalls too.
,,China in singapore,4.0,,"I have been to China a couple of times now, and believe me when I say that this town does indeed represent China."
,,Year of the Rooster 2017,5.0,,"Excellent atmosphere, full of festivities and feels safe too. Plenty to shop, see and eat. Conveniently located within seconds walk to the MRT."
,,great experience,5.0,,"Our first visit early in the day was somewhat disappointing as it was pretty quiet BUT the street decorations were quite something! Different sized roosters everywhere, flowers overhead stretched from one side of the road to the other. Very very festive. We then went back for a second visit and what a difference. We got caught up in the new year festive crowd. Could not move it was so packed. Stalls selling all sorts of goods and of course lots of rooster mementos. Have never seen so many stalls selling varieties of nuts!! Food stalls galore if you wanted to sample 'street food' which we did not as it was nigh impossible to get to the front of any stall. Streets to Chinatown were blocked off from traffic as there was going to be all kinds of entertainment. Crowds were so well behaved. We did not stay to watch any of the entertainment, simply too crowded. Our third visit was not what we had planned. We were stopped by a 'tour guide' who was pretty good at encouraging us to visit the flea market which apparently is only held on a Sunday. This time it was still busy but more pleasant. We driven by said tour guide to the flea market where we were met by a gentleman who took us to a jewelry stall. Apparently many regular visitors to Singapore are aware of this stall where one can buy the real deal for less than jewelry exported to SA. Rings, necklaces, the whole range including expensive brand watches. We were heartily welcomed, offered juice/water and a beer for hubby and before we knew it we did a little shopping. Be warned, the lovely owners are excellent and slick sales people but ever so pleasant and likeable. Someone offered to take us to a stall that sold cell phones, iPads etc but we hastily declined. The many flea market stalls sell shoes, handbags, clothing, food, in fact, you name it someone will be selling it. An interesting and lovely experience on the different days we visited Chinatown which was walking distance from our hotel."
,,It's Chinatown,4.0,,"Loads of bargaining is to be done here. As I have traveled to few places before, this chinatown is not much different to most. But never wanting to miss out on anything, I made the effort of visiting here. Usual hustle and bustle you would come to expect from a chinatown."
,,good place to explore chinese culture,4.0,,The place brings out the chinese culture inbibed in singapore and offers various shopping and dining places
,,Bargains to be had!,4.0,,"Prior to CNY the entire area was a buzz. Streets were adorned with lanterns etc and certainly added to the atmosphere. Chinatown covers a very wide area, and after alighting from the MRT and just wandering around we uncovered excellent stalls offering delicious food and juices for minimal cost.Cheap clothing, bags, souvenirs are readily available."
,,Glad I went.,4.0,,"Went out of curiosity and wasn't disappointed with my visit. Plenty restaurants,bars and hawker stalls to wet your appetite. A bustling area with a diverse clientele. Take it all in."
,,Great place to pick up souvenirs and good hawker centre,4.0,,We purchased most of our gifts for friends and relatives from the markets that are up and down the streets. Gets crowded so best time to visit is about 11.30ish.
,,Chinese new year,4.0,,"We visited China town around Chinese new year and it was great experience as it was packed with visitors. I loved the decorations, the traditional festive food and all the whole atmosphere."
,,Wonderful - especially during Chinese New Year,4.0,,"Booked a hotel for a few days stopover in Singapore months ago, without realising the hotel was in the heart of Chinatown the day after Chinese New Year. This made it understandable busy but also fascinating to experience. Everybody should visit the street market and try some of the many local dishes on offer - all of which are very reasonably priced."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Chinatown Singapore is very touristic! You can get a lot of small souvenirs there but do not forget to bargain at every shop. There are some nice temples to visit and bars to have a cold Tiger Beer.
,,Clean streets for Singapore Chinatown,3.0,,"Personally i think Singapore Chinatown if compare with other parts of countries Chinatown, Singapore Chinatown is consider very clean however is very hot during the day. You can find local images souvenirs or Chinese version souvenirs which made in China if that's what you looking for. You might want to bargain with the China vendors or sellers as the price offered from one end to another end of the street. For example, my first stop for the chinese cut out wallpaper decor the very first vendor quoted me S$20.00 per piece. Then i move without buying to another vendor where he offered S$10.00 per piece which i still consider too pricey. My last stop at the end of the street the vendor quoted me for the same piece of what i want from other vendors at only S$5.00 per piece. So be alert what kind of vendors you will be dealing with. If you want prefer local food, head to the food street where you can find variety of good local food at reasonable price."
,,chinese new year,4.0,,"came for lunar new year and all 3 blocks of 'chinatown' were lit up with festival lights, food booths, hawkers, flower stalls, etc. Long lines for traditional treats such as Bak Hwa (barbequed pork) Go over to Food Street, buy decorations for your house, have a beer. There is a small but excellent museum on one of the streets also. Easily accessable by MTR"
,,Another fun place to explore in Singapore,4.0,,"I would definitely recommend a walk thru Chinatown. Make sure you go when the vendors are open. Check out all the temples too. Of course, lots of food options."
,,Should see it but?,2.0,,"If your going there for the food you should ask around, the food is not very good and there is certainly no 5 star Resturants, Chinatown is great to see go walk and spend a few hours it's something to see, the souvenirs are expensive most of them obviously from China very cheap quality and definitely not worth the money, like I mentioned it worth walking around just to experience and if you don't mind eating low-quality Chinese food, then why not try it."
,,Chinese New Year,5.0,,Luckily it was Chinese New Year when we visited. It took hours to walk round it all and was extremely tiring but well worth it. The street good is good to look at but I would have preferred to have eaten in the fabulous shopping centre we visited but can't remember which one.
,,Buzzing atmosphere,5.0,,"Easy to get there by cheap, efficient local transport. Excellent sites of interest and the stalls and night market are very lively. Food Street superb for meals of very good quality at cheap prices"
,,Just another Chinatown,4.0,,It's nice to visit but the Chinese flavor can be found anywhere. The food court is worth visiting if you are hungry. The MRT has a stop right at Chinatown.
,,Other than Chinatown,4.0,,"Used to seeing chinatown as chaotic place, dirty, messy, it soon becomes clear that chinatown Singapore is another thing. Clean streets, well sorted stores, merchandise displayed very tidy. You can buy different items at low prices, although the quality often reflects the price paid."
,,China town is a place which gives a truly local taste to tourists,3.0,,"This is quite crowded, but you get a full local taste. We visited right on the day of Chinese Lunar day so it was full of activity. Do not miss the ""Tintin"" collection shop, very very unusual!!"
,,We visited at Chinese New Year,5.0,,"The place was vibrant and taking part in preparation for the Chinese New Year. There were lots of colourful decorations all around and a massive rooster in the middle of the main road! It was interesting to see the stalls and shops. If you are interested in having a tailor made suit or evening dress made to measure, there are lots of tailors who could do this for you in a short time. The prices were too high as far as I was concerned ( estimated £350 for a silk sleeveless evening dress) .
There was street food available, or you could pay to eat in more expensive restaurants.
There were also some cheaper things to buy such as pashminas which appeared to be a genuine bargain."
,,We wish we'd visited more!,5.0,,"We visited China Town on our second last night in Singapore... and to be perfectly honest, we wish we had of dined there more.

I'm a huge food lover... for me, the choice was just overwhelming. We ended up having something from one of the BBQ carts, my husband had a 633ml beer and I had a coconut (yep a whole damn coconut) and it cost 34$S for more food than we could eat and amazing drinks - one of them alcoholic.

The selection of food was just unparalleled and the price was the most reasonable we'd found throughout Singapore. Everything smelled and looked great... the flavour of what we had was exceptional.

Aside from the food there are a myriad of colourful stores selling everything from souvenirs to spices to clothing... more. Everything you can imagine. And while these prices weren't the best I've seen in Asia, they're certainly the best I saw in Singapore.

There were large crowds and pretty much people rubbing up against you the entire time your walking the streets, so if this kind of thing makes you uncomfortable, it might not be the attraction for you.

It is well signed that there are pick-pockets at work, same as any area that involves close quarters like China Town, just take the appropriate precautions and you won't have a problem.

China Town is easily accessible from bus line #13 and a few of the train lines pass through there. Your Ezy-Link card (available at transit stations and 7-11 stores) works on both buses and trains - getting there costs only a few dollars on public transport and is well, well worth it."
,,Can't do Singapore without doing Chinatown,5.0,,"Great food, people and experiences everywhere you look. Easy to get around and very safe as is all of Singapore. Try the street food as incredible and we had no issues with any of it."
,,"Bustling, exciting and lots to see",5.0,,"Loved China town, busy noisy colourful and everything you would expect. So many little stalls selling their wares, numerous restaurants and lots of very friendly Chinese people as well as a couple of temples. Don't miss it."
,,Chinese Lunar New Year Festive Baazar,5.0,,"Excellent setup of the annual Chinese Lunar New Year baazar that brings the festive season all so bustling 😅 So much to see ... waxed meat, footwear, apparels, home decos, numerous different type of snack and savoury bbq meat."
,,Loved it,5.0,,The food. The buildings. The stores. All of it were amazing. The people were friendly. Loved this place the most so far.
,,Small but interesting!,4.0,,"Wonderful to stroll around the small market selling Delicious Chinese delicacies also other traditional clothes and souvenirs... haggle , haggle , haggle , however keep your valuables safe ! A very interesting temple on site of Buddhism denomination very beautiful and interesting take a look ... Top it off with a wonderful Chinese lunch or Dinner if you have any money left at this stage ... certainly not the biggest china town I have visited but worth a visit !"
,,Colorful and Interesting,5.0,,"Went to SG Chinatown a few days before the Chinese New Year. It was a bit crazy because there were a lot of locals doing their pre CNY shopping and tourists as well enjoying the bargains. Alighting from the MRT and eventually landing in Pagoda St., the colors of the shophouses will greet you. A lot of cheap food choices are available in the area so if you're on a budget, this is the place to be in. There are also a lot of shops/stalls selling souvenirs which are cheaper than any place else in SG. It might be a bit crazy because of the volume of people, but it's interesting seeing this side of SG normally so orderly."
,,"Busy, dirty & smelly",3.0,,"But if it wasn't , it wouldn't be Chinatown. You have to visit Chinatown at least once, visit the markets for some cheap souvenirs & grab a bite to eat in the bustling food hall. It's all part of the Singapore experience!!"
,,IChinese New Year cheer,4.0,,"Loved my visit to China town. Easy access from the mrt just a short walk and you arrive to a very noisy, colourful interesting array of both locals and tourists on this occasion shopping for trinkets for Chinese New year. It was very affordable and fun to hunt through all the stalls to collect our bag of goodies. There were cheep handbags, slippers, souvenirs and decorations. The atmosphere was vibrant and although we were among hundreds of people it still felt very safe. Beware of sellers wanting to help you improve your luck with the upcoming Chinese horoscope year. While you are here make sure you visit the many temples it makes a very interest day out."
,,Average,3.0,,"I have gone to Chinatown with huge expectations to see Rooster year decorations but a total disappointment. It is very dirty and very crowded. Shops were open but items are disorganized, staff not professional or friendly. The tea house that we wanted to go was closed. Buddha temple was amazing. Overall a nice touristic experience to see China side of Singapore but average in total."
,,"Wonderful, intricate detail during Chinese New Lunar Year",5.0,,"Take a tour in China Town with a brisk walk where you are able to visit Worlds that seem old and new. View old, oriental furniture for those design lovers or if you are a keen shopper talk a walk around surrounding stalls to feast your eyes and a variety of cuisine or shop for Singaporean style clothing or a great place to purchase your Chinese Lunar New Year decorations. For those who not only want to shop you can also view a close by Temple, but just remember to leave your shoes outside while also adorning the night sky with float like Lanterns in time for a New Year"
,,Stamp of Chinese group in Singapore,4.0,,"It's little old town with of course Chinese culture. Especially in Lunar new year time. So many goods for tourist like small present for family. And it's so cheap: 10$S/pcs (many kinds like cup, glass, lighter...)"
,,An Experince,5.0,,Explore China Town and visit the market stalls and experience some of the local culinary delights - there are organised tours but we went on our own
,,Nice architecture and for souvenirs,4.0,,Crowed area with many shops. Nice to see just at the exit of the MRT. Think to buy your souvenirs (like printing bags) at this place because in the mall you will only find luxury shops.
,,Loved it,5.0,,"Love Chinatown great shopping looking at all the local crafts, shopping malls, lots of places to eat food, there's so much to do in Chinatown you can pick up some good bargains and awesome souvenirs."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,This is a great area to wander round and soak up the atmosphere. The heritage centre is interesting but the stalls and the temples are free and give you real feel of a culture. It was especially colourful when we were there it being the New Year. Some of the streets are pedestrianised so it makes for easy sight seeing. There are numerous plaques telling the history of the area so leave the guidebook at home!
,,Help Chinatown Social Enterprise Light Up The Lives of The Needy Elderly,4.0,,"It is remarkable how Chinatown welcomes Spring in Singapore - which is not favored with 4 changing seasons.

Neverthelss, the celebratory spirit overwhelms all and everything.

Vendors marketing apparell, decorations, edibles, festive goodies, drinks, toys are all out in full force. The 'bak kwa' traders boasts their long queues of customers aiming to get their hands on this traditional chinese pork jerky.

I want to steer away from the mercantile gleam and glitter that is Chinatown at Chinese New Year. Instead, I focus on charitable organsizations at work at Chinatown's Social Enterprise located at The Majestic (next to Yue Hwa Chinese Product Store.

Open Monday to Sat from 10am to 7pm, on Sundays from 10am to 4pm & closed on Public Holidays.

The venture is set up with the aim of helping the needy and the elderly provide for themselves through its community outreach initiatives. Offering Samsui bags, passport holders, handphone holders, Samsui Dolls, Five Stones etc... for locals to stock up.

For foreigners, attractive replicas of Sultan Mosque (S$35), Victoria Memoria Hall (S$59), the iconic Central Fire Station (S$55) and Ngee Ann City (S$15) are up for grabs. You won't find them elsewhere.

The heart of shopping - experience it."
,,The best China Town I've ever visited,5.0,,"Food and shopping is incredible, everyone speaks english. You would be lucky to witness/hear Chinese performances, there is always a great buzz and something to see. Check out the buddha temple which is nearby."
,,Always colourful and peaceful at Chinatown,4.0,,Great to see the giant Fire Rooster as the main attraction at Chinatown during the Chinese New Year festival. Food lovers will be able to taste many types if delicious food in the many restaurants or food court.
,,A short stroll for Chinese New Year in Chinatown,4.0,,"This was perhaps my third time to Chinatown in Singapore and the first time I brought the 3 kids including one double stroller.
We waslked around mainly food street and pagoda street to soak up the Chinese New Year atmosphere and to have some lunch. Because it was actual Chinese New Year, most of Chinatown was closed except these streets. Here the restaurants an some souvenir stalls, 2-dallar shops and silk shops remained open for the busy stream of tourists visiting. The roosters, lanterns, and flower decorations were lovely and the children really enjoyed the roosters in particular.

If you're visiting Singapore - Chinatown is worth a visit for a few hours. Beware of overpriced food in a lot of the restaurants though - Service is hasty and can be a bit aggressive - like yesterday when I asked for a glass for my bottle of beer - our server appeared quite outraged to be asked for something other than the beer or food initially ordered! Most of the food has MSG but that seems very acceptable to local Singaporeans. I am sure there are plenty of great places to eat high quality food - do some research if you're into your food! Check out the Michelin Star Hawker place for a start!"
,,CNY makes it even more unique!,4.0,,"I went there one week before Chinese New Year. Over there, it is very vibrant with locals walking around and shopping for CNY goodies! Over there, during the CNY period, you will see many things being sold- from red couplets, to yummy nuts and jelly, and even fanciful Chinese clothing! Going to Chinatown, especially during the CNY period, is a total must.
Apart from all the delicious and awesome goods being sold there, the decorations are worth looking at and taking photos of. They will always line the streets with cute sculptures of this year's Chinese zodiac. Being the year of the rooster this year, you will see cute roosters, chickens and baby chicks everywhere up and down! You will also see cute little traditional red lanterns bobbing around the streets everywhere. This place, during the day and night, is abuzz with people doing last minute CNY shopping, and as you walk, you will be crushed by throngs of crowds in the streets. Yes, it is VERY CROWDED!!! So be prepared always to squeeze in with the crowd. I recommend that you wear comfortable walking shoes as there will be tons of walking (and squeezing!)."
,,Great place to buy your souvenirs,4.0,,"Variety of things you can buy at a very reasonable price. Shirts, souvenir items, everything that you may want to bring home are all here. If you get hungry, there are also nice restaurants nearby to dine-in with your family. Chinatown train station is also very accesible if you want to anywhere Singapore after you shop."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"China Town at its craziest best!! Great for both shopping and eating, as well as for observing the locals. Highly recommended, an afternoon well spent!"
,,Nice China Market,4.0,,"We arrived Saturday afternoon and walked Chinatown Nice market, quite crowded but a lot of ver friendly people Also visited a Bhudda Temple"
,,Heart of culture,4.0,,"If you have ever felt Singapore city lacks a certain cultural soul, a visit to Chinatown will put that to rest.
Colourful, vibrant and crowded even on weekday. Plenty of places to eat (although choose the stalls which are crowded, they are crowded for a reason), and great ships to buy souviniers."
,,great local guide,5.0,,Very interesting walk with a knowledgeable guide. The walk was easy and we had lots of photo opportunities and some tasting options.
,,Have to do,5.0,,"Fantastic experience, but very hot and busy, superb atmosphere, well worth the visit, but carry water and be prepared to be in large crowds"
,,China Town to the max,5.0,,We love China Towns at home but this is the real thing. Experienced the then imminent New Year with full technicolour. Don't miss
,,A bit boring...,3.0,,... Probably its the most clinical chinatown on this planet - everything appears a bit too clean to be real. Food is good though
,,Great place for souvenirs and food,4.0,,Want souvenirs? Get to Pagoda street for an exciting experience and then walk a few meters to the Chinatown Food street for one of the best hawker centres in Singapore!
,,"Eat, eat, eat, eat, shop!",5.0,,Try the Bak Kwa and stand in line for it because it is worth the wait! It is different at every stand but always delicious. Must try!
,,The very essence of old Singapore,5.0,,"I honestly don't see how one could understand Singapore without visiting Chinatown. This is where it all comes together... the different cultures and religions co-existing in complete harmony. You'll see beautiful Hindu, Muslim and Buddhist places of worship and experience the sights, sounds and smells of the food streets. Busy, full of character & colour and loads of fun."
,,CNY,5.0,,"Very excited to be here for Chinese New Year. Have seen some great street talent, street stalls, food stalls, clothing and nik nak stalls. I'm actually all stalled out, lol!!"
,,Classical architecture and modern style,5.0,,Many old Chinese-style shop here. You can buy many traditional Chinese food and restaurants. Its has several shopping walking street. Most of the time are congested with local people and tourist.
,,A must experience,5.0,,"This is the Asian experience you visit Singapore for ie if you only have time for one thing this is it.
Authentic street food that is cheap and awesome ie Mongolian Hot Pot which was big enough for two to share.
You could spend a week here and still not see it all.
Even if it rains they've got you covered."
,,So much Fun,5.0,,This is an absolute must do event in Singapore. Both my partner and I are fussy eaters and were able to find a variety of food to enjoy. The market holders are fun and polite. We visited 3 times during our tie in Singapore.
,,Great day,4.0,,Lots of interesting places to see. Really enjoyed the day. Though it was very crowded and hot. People were very friendly. Wear comfortable walking shoes!
,,Raining being Chinese New Year,4.0,,was this area after spent fun day in USS. straight came here to find something nice to bring back to home to Indonesia.seriously this is Chinese things. i feel like in Beijing hahaha. but yeahh finally got my souvenir and was cheap for tote bag and cutter for nails. $10 for 5 tote bag and the quality is ok not too bad. an nails cutter is $10 for 12 pcs. what a cheap lol
,,Must visit,5.0,,Lovely colourful place.lot of cheap shopping option.Street food at cheap rate but hygienic.must visit
,,Very busy place,5.0,,"We could not decide, where to eat or drink - so many food stands but the smell of the food was very nice, you could see, that everything is fresh!"
,,Chinatown Singapore,4.0,,"Great place for shopping and eating as well as local cuisine and culture. Easy to get to by MRT via Chinatown station. Plenty to do and see, especially in the evenings."
,,spirit of Singapore,5.0,,It has a spirit of old Singapore still. There are less and less such places. Unforunately for me. I still remember it from 20 years ago. I hope that all new modern buildings won't replace it.
,,Modernized Tourist Zone,4.0,,"Well, whatever that you need to buy or try from Singapore, you can find it all here. From the hawker centres right down to the tourist souvenir shops, this place has it all. Nonstop activity from morning to midnight, you won't find yourself alone here. By all means, this is the epitome of how to make a tourist hotspot. Lump everything together, provide the public transport, give it a name and watch it bloom."
,,Incredibly crowded...,1.0,,"The place was very crowded (okay like duh it’s Chinatown) but whatI didnt like was there weren't exactly much items you’d say worth buying... What you’d see in the place would be similar to what you would in a souvenier shop...cost, quantity and quality."
,,Chinatown,5.0,,This was much better than Bugis Street in my opinion. Merchandise is a little more upscale but not much. If you like markets you'll enjoy!
,,Should go.,5.0,,Chinatown is a history where u can see old shop houses in the 70s but they have pain back all buildings. More shop cheap shopping
,,Best place to collect items for interior design work for your home,4.0,,The only place in Singapore where I felt that things are not too expensive.You get almost everything in Chinatown.Of which I felt that u can get many nice and inexpensive things to decorate your house.You have very good open restaurants at the end of the street.A must visit place for tourists.
,,Unrealistic Expectation,2.0,,"Regrettably, in keeping with an apparent government policy to shy away from supporting and promoting true Chinese culture to one more of seeking greater economic development, this Chinatown is a true example of just that. Instead of the bustling retail and makan stalls usually associated with Chinatowns, of even the myriad of inexpensive trinkets, you find here a modern shopping mall with all its modern retail outlets. If ever a Chinatown was misnamed, then this is an absolute example of one. The streets surrounding this “market” hold considerable more appeal than the “market” itself."
,,Interesting place to visit,5.0,,We went to Chinatown just before their New Year celebrations (The Roster).The markets are full of colour. If you are looking for a bargain maybe this is the place to go.If not its still an interesting place to spend a few hours.
,,Shopping on a budget,4.0,,"Ok, there are lots of these around the globe but this one has shops that don't charge a fortune (unlike most of SIngapore's other shops).
The staff are a bit pushy in places but also very helpful when required.
Lots of cheap Chinese imports for sale and some bargains to be had.
Don't divert to see it but give it a go if you're nearby."
,,"A bit dirty, smelly and very hot!",3.0,,"I loved the Chinese new year decorations set up along the main road, but that's probably all. Overall, this was a busy place that was a bit smelly and dirty."
,,Lots to see,5.0,,"Loved it here, very vibrant and lots to see with all the market stalls selling so much. Lots of colour and hustle and bustle"
,,"Great fun, lots to see, many booths and stores",5.0,,Be sure to get a foor or body message for $30 / hour. Plenty of eats everywhere. Clothes at bargain prices. Be sure to hit the fressh food a fish markets below the streets. Jewelry buyers be ware. much fake stuff but you can bargain
,,Seen one seen them all?,3.0,,"We had an afternoon stroll through China town and a nice lunch there. It had a great atmosphere and the food was a bit cheaper than the rest of Singapore. Like the title says. It's just like most other China towns. But it was clean and the pole were friendly and helpful.

Good spot to kill a few hours and do a bit of people watching over lunch."
,,Average,3.0,,"I nice break from the high-rises, but nothing to write home about. I guess you can spend 1 or 2 hours exploring."
,,The Hub of Chinese Life and Culture,5.0,,"The Chinatown Heritage Center is a must...this museum is housed in three restored shop houses and shows the history and culture of the Chinese immigrants by recreating their living conditions. Temple Street is worth the walk with craft stores, temples, etc. A colorful and delightful section of the city."
,,A real Chinatown in the centre of Singapore,5.0,,This is a great place to go shopping for souvenirs which are very expensive elsewhere. Lots of bargains and knick knacks to be had very cheaply
,,CNY madness,3.0,,"It's the last weekend before chinese new year and all hell breaks loose. Hundreds of stalls selling CNY stuff sprout out , selling everything from food to clothes to trinkets and everything in between. Super crowded and you better not be claustrophobic"
,,Soak in the Chinese Lunar New Year festive season !,5.0,,"This is the period to come, when the Chinese are going to celebrate their Lunar New Year.
There are many stalls lined up along Smith St and Temple St, and they are selling all kinds of festive goodies or decorations. It's very lively during the day or night, and of course you could take a bite at the hawker stalls along Smith St or up at level 2 in Chinatown hawker centre."
,,Great Chines food,4.0,,Good variety of local eatries and street food. Night markets for all sorts of clothing and nick naks
,,So Much to see,4.0,,The food was probably the highlight of our visit to Chinatown. There are so many to choose from. Be sure to walk around the market.

,,Interesting,4.0,,"Lots to take in when you visit Chinatown. Day or night it's bustling. Food, drink all sorts of wares available."
,,So Much To See,5.0,,Had a fantastic day in Chinatown. So much shopping and sooo much food. You have to look for the bargains because most are peddling the same items but definitely worth it for a day out. Great food and you can haggle prices. We were there just before Chinese New Year so it was very busy. Definitely a must do in Singapore.
,,Vibrant community atmosphere,5.0,,We were there in the lead up to Chinese New Year and the whole area was ablaze with light and colour. We had a good meal in one of the many street cafes. And loved wandering through the many market stalls
,,wow-fabulous china town,5.0,,"We enjoyed two fabulous meals in China town at local restaurants. The ambiance, outlook and food is great. Very authentic dining & a great place to enjoy and walk & soak up the vibe"

,,good market to buy cheap trinkets.,4.0,,"If you want to take back Souvenirs for your friends which bear a typical Singapore stamp, this is the place. In most of the shops bargaining is a must to an extent of max 20% not more. Prices are generally reasonable. Good variety of, in fashion, clothes available, specially for the youth. Bulk packs of souvenirs are at very attractive prices. Lot of chinese food joints, CAUTION, check for ingredients before placing orders. Be specific you want salty, savoury food and not sweet. Pictures of the food items displayed at most of the joints do tell a lot.In short a must and interesting place to explore."
,,Visit the CNY market,4.0,,"HAve been to chinatown many times.. But only few times during CNY festival market.. Not very impressive as it is too commercialize.. For kids, do not have much to show too"
,,Wonderful smells and colourful with an authentic feel to China in a cosmopolitan city .,5.0,,"A must see in Singapore with its fabulous food marquet and spices from the orient as well as clothes, souvenirs and lots more surprices of exotic fruits and gastronomy."
,,Another Chinatown,3.0,,"It's worth a visit for some chili crab, but effectively it's just another Chinatown. Tonnes of Chinese restaurants lined the edge of the street, just too many to chose from!"
,,Grab a bargain,5.0,,Stall type markets where you can pick up virtually anything. Wonderful for well priced souvenirs. Outdoors though so be prepared for the heat and humidity. Crowds can build up as the day goes on.
,,Bustling and busy,4.0,,We visited Chinatown for a wander through and found it vibrant and exciting. Preparations were well underway for Chinese New Year celebrations which added to the vibe. Food Street was a mass of fantastic aromas and although we didn't partake there was some amazing food on offer. You could buy all sorts in the shops.
,,Great place to see,4.0,,I couldn't go to China but Singapore gave me the feel of being in China through China town. Very busy place but there is a lot to see and capture.I went there for photos really.
,,Huge markets,5.0,,"We came at the beginning of Chinese New Year so they were stocked with all the decorations ready for the celebrations. Super cheap for little bibs and bobs - satin purses of all different colours and styles $2. Great for gifts or those times you just need a little zipper purse.
Loads of people milling around. We spent the h
Whole day here and walked 16klms this day so we were happy to get back to the hotel to soak in a tub."
,,Like other Chinatowns around the world,3.0,,"Very similar to other Chinatowns around the world, this is where you're able to get really cheap ""Singaporean"" souvenirs. I say this because they are just ordinary souvenirs (keychains, magnets) etc with Singapore written on it or a photo of a famous Singaporean landmark or something similar."
,,Chinese night market,5.0,,"I went to the night market - it was great. Busy, with lots of things for sale and to eat. An amazingly international crowd. Just want you want from a good night market."
,,"Wow, like a city of Chinese , full on",4.0,,"Visited 3 times in the week. Cheap and plentiful shops, hawkers centre cheap food, but dirty toilets. Other shps and cafes to shelter in when rain is torrential. Material shops, Chinese supermarket worth a visit for authentic China, household items and tea and coffee."
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,"Apart from the markets the Tooth temple within China town should not be missed. there is a lift that can take you to the 5th floor, or stairs if you prefer. I found this to be one of the special points to add to your Singapore experience. The roof has nice relaxing gardens and as you take the stairs down to the other lower floors you will realise what a treasure this has been for you"
,,Chinese new year,5.0,,"I lovely and lively part to be around with great options to eat, buy chinese goods and enjoy a very free part of the town. Many gay friendly places are also around the area. Good food from cheap to expensive. Easily accessible."
,,Super busy!!!,4.0,,Very busy when we visited especially since we were just two weeks away from Chinese new year! But a wonderful experience to check out all the eateries and see the items for sale!
,,worth a wonder,4.0,,while here of course it worth a wonder round do a bit of shopping but the prices can vary from street to street we had some lovely food in food street the people all very lovely and helpful some times it is very crowed.
,,A Tourist Magnet,4.0,,"With the forthcoming Chinese New Year, final preparations are in full swing for the celebrations. A huge Rooster has been erected and it makes an awesome sight when lit at night. Very crowded presently in the build up to New Year and this will only increase as the event gets closer. Great area for souvenir shopping with prices much less than elsewhere."
,,beautiful colorful quarter,4.0,,"Beautiful place, allowing acquainted with Chinese culture. Very colorful, a lot of Chinese restaurants and shops. Quarter is worth a visit for several reasons: a truly authentic place with unique architecture (see the second floor). Many shops with frank junk, but there is a kind of interesting little things. Also, if you want to bring a banal souvenirs (postcards, magnets with the symbols of the city) - you here, less unlikely to find somewhere. Also I advise you to try the food - which depends only on your courage."
,,Great CNY decorations,4.0,,"The best place to visit to get the Chinese New Year feel, but expect it to be super crowded and stuffy. Lots of food and things to buy, so prepare your wallets"
,,Very busy and crowded,3.0,,"It's very commercial but you can get a culture experience here, all the shops sell pretty much the same thing and over priced, so didn't really shop here, food are also overpriced, I'd suggest you to head to the maxwell road hawker centre, more variety and cheaper . make sure you go to Chinatown during the day as it can get really packed and busy at night which isn't fun to walk at all"
,,Rich Chinese New Year festive spirits,5.0,,"Chinatown is a very accessible from MRT and public business. Recent years mainland China and Sichuan restaurants have mushroomed around the area, perhaps to cater to Chinese tourists. There are famous Hindu temple and Buddhist temple worth to visit. It is in the middle of the city and within walking distance to Clark Quay and Tanjong Pagar.

This year the lanterns, lightings and decorations for Chinese New Year (CNY) is especially beautiful. The crowd to the CNY goodies market (年货市场) is not too bad, but I believe it will get really crowded next week. There are many stalls selling melon seeds, ground nuts, preserved meats, sausages, decorations, fruits, teapots and etc. Very colourful and interesting to shop. Behind the stalls are souvenir shops, restaurants and massage shops. A great place for tourists to spend a day.

And the nearby hawker centres (4 of them) provides delicious local food like chicken rice, fried kwa teow, wantan mee, just to name a few.

Glad to bring a friend to visit this interesting place."
,,A foodie heaven!,5.0,,So much eating going on all of the time day and night! Great atmosphere and plenty to see. I sat and watched the locals doing line dancing to rock music outside the cultural centre which was fascinating and rather a surprise to me although I don't know why!! Everyone was so friendly and really wanted you to enjoy your visit without any hassle at all.
,,Work + Holiday,4.0,,"Is really crowded before the Chinese New Year, u can enjoy the street food at night time, they also selling the stuff (fruit, snacks, clothes and souvenir)."
,,Great,5.0,,"Be prepared as this place is so busy! Try to avoid weekends! Great place,good street food and place to see."
,,Good street food!,5.0,,"It's a must go place if you would like to try out local Chinese food. Si Chuan restaurant, frog porridge and Mala Hotpot is a must try"
,,The economical part of Singapore - cheap food and clothes/souvenirs,5.0,,"It would be foolish to visit Singapore without visiting Chinatown, which offers the ideal Chinese cultural experience for a visitor. Whilst Orchard Road offers upmarket food and gifts for yourself, or to take home for others, Chinatown is the place for tourists on a budget, as well as those who are after a good deal.
Don't miss it."
,,Chinese New Year Bazaar,5.0,,Went with my family after dinner to see the light up and the various stores setup only during this Chinese New Year. Lots of people and great atmosphere.
,,Food street a great experience,4.0,,"We went to Chinatown twice during our visit - great food, very affordable. The Chinatown is expansive and extensive. A must-do is to go and eat at the Food Street and visit the Street market."
,,Fun place to visit,5.0,,"Had a great time walking around and shopping for Chinese New Year decorations and clothing. Food was ok. Would have liked to find the stall street food, but didn't see it."
,,Home of the Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken,4.0,,"We stayed in a Hotel 1929 right next door to China town ( see my review). Chinatown was alive with colour, music and food. The shops were quite over priced so I passed on the shopping here as I thought other places in Singapore were cheaper.

The food court was our thing its's not for the faint hearted if you are not culturally prepared. Be warned that Singaporeans have a different way that we may not be accustomed to in Australia. They will eat their chicken/protein and leave their remains on the table or floor and this is quite common throughout Singapore and later Vietnam we found.

The food court is on a mezzanine level and the food is the cheapest I have ever seen. It was ridiculous how much food you got for your dollar. So I made sure I got my dumpling fix. We also ate the Micheln starred Soya Sauce Chicken ( see my review) which was worth the very long wait. If you are wondering what the long line is, that;s what people are waiting for. You can enjoy some wonderful food washed down with some fresh local sugar cane juice for a $1 AUD or an iced cold beer."
,,Fascinating,4.0,,"This was an interesting trip that gave a good view of the other side of Singapore to the efficient high rise one. Where else could you but such things as garlic peanuts? We were lucky to be able to reurn in the evening when the place really come alive. This was even more so the night we went as the President was turning on the lights for Chinese New Year. Another tip is to make sure you visit the wet market, although you may not wish to purchase real crocodile meat!!"
,,"Chinese New Year, Visit Chinatown",4.0,,"One afternoon on weekday took a bus to chinatown, walking around was amaze at items they sell for chinese new year. A wide variety of goods with affordable price and the place is crowded with local and tourist, is so happening.
The organiser have plan well, decorate well, chinatown is a very successful attractions.
Go visit chinatown before chinese new year."
,,One of the Most Vibrant Chinatowns,5.0,,"I have visited Chinatowns in Australia, Thailand, and America, but none have the energy and vibrance of the Chinatown in Singapore. First, the Buddhist temple there is amazing with its decorations, design, and colors. Second, the shopping stalls and shops are numerous and have everything you could think of. Third, the restaurants are numerous and the food is delicious. There are many things to do in Chinatown and even the Hindu temple nearby is beautiful and exquisitely ornate. We went to Chinatown every day we were there and never got tired of it. There was still much more to see."
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,"Not much more to day really. But a visit to Singapore without walking through Chinatown? Sadness! I know one needs time, so if you can, make time. :)"

,,fun in the rain,5.0,,"A brilliant area full of different shops / cafes. It pored with rain during our visit, but this was not a problem as umbells wer on sale and lots of the shops / stalls had covered walk ways"
,,Good spot to shop,5.0,,"You could find a better deals in here, than at Bugis Street. It would be better if you come just before Chinese New Year during weekdays. Weekend will be quite chaotic"

,,A Must Visit,3.0,,"It was nice to stroll through China Town on New years Eve and through the crowded Market with stalls selling all kinds of items. Very Colorful and Good place to purchase souvenirs, and have Chinese food.It was nice to seat and watch a father and his sons play live for the crowd, and later sit in the small rooftop area and enjoy sweet dried meat- a Chinese popular snack.( Similar to beef Jerky)
For fans of Tintin, there is a Tintin shop with the Adventures of Tintin items for purchase.( Try and resist taking a picture with the Captain Haddock statue at the entrance of the shop, it is prohibited)."

,,Depends !,3.0,,"For people from western countries whom are 1st time visitors to Asia and a chinatown,this is a most interesting visit.

For other people , let say fellow Asians, chinatown singapore seems very clean and sanitized.

missing something ?what ? smells, dirt and disorder! Singapore' s chinatown does not seem real but contrived . it's clean, smell less and orderly unlike Yao wa rat in Bangkok, Cholon HCM, Penang !)

Hence , it all depends where you r from . if s it china, you have plenty of lao jie s , this is nothing compared w what you have.

Hence to each , their own , as to whether you r impressed or find it extremely dull and plasticky (as w Disneyland)"

All the stalls stayed open, and we had some cold drinks and look through all the stalls, so much to buy and great bargains. We took the train from there to our next destination. Train is great."
,,If you come to Singapore then you have to go here!,5.0,,"I personally love this area, loads of choice for food including Chinese, Korean and more. I love the street food vendors, great food and loads of choice. Loads of small shops selling anything and everything. If you are looking for the perfect bit of holiday tack, then this is the place to come. To the end of one of the roads is a beautiful temple which you can go in and take a look around. If you want to take photos then you do need to pay a small charge"
,,Very busy,4.0,,"A delightful area but on the day we visited was the day of the start of their new year celebration and it was hectic, some areas cordoned off. Much like most Chinatowns I have visited but still worth a visit."

,,Two weeks before Chinese New Year,5.0,,"Wonderful settings for NewYear are fusing each day. Fantastic restaurants and ""food courts"" called Hawkers(?) abound.
No problem finding very cheap food. Can't hail a cab but there are many stands. Some take credit cards some don't ( red and blue do). AAA has no fee exchange before you go. Look for a credit card with no exchange penalty."
,,A nice tour in the evening and inlude the dinner,4.0,,"We got a tour through Chinatown, then had some free time, dinner and the a trysical ride in the evening air, wonderful. We felt refresh after the ride and it was such a good way to spend the evening."

,,Thats the hearth of Singapore,5.0,,"I love Chinatown I can't believe I didn't visit last time, i live in china so last time i thought it was ridiculous to visit Chinatown and of course i was wrong, The food there is great,there's a great variety of everything, shops,you can basically find anything you want."

,,Is okay but I saw better china towns....,3.0,,I went there to eat and you will find really nice small and larger places where you can get original chinese food.
,,Full on China Town,4.0,,"This is a full on experience. Choose your time to visit as during the day it can get very hot and humid, but once it gets dark the place comes alive with lights and the food stalls in the food road. Try some food and join in! If you are cautious or don't enjoy crowds this probably isn't for you. Perhaps try an organised trip to see it."
,,"Amazing Temples, Shopping and Great Food!",5.0,,"Wow! What a great place to spend some time shopping and immersing yourself in the grass roots multi-culture of Singapore!!

This is a must visit, and to get the most out of it, visit on a Sunday when the markets are in full swing and both the temples (Buddha Tooth Relic Buddhist Temple and Sri Mariamman Hindu Temple) are in worship, an amazing thing to experience and a great learning for your children if you have them! You can enter the Buddhist temple during worship and experience first hand what it's like to be a part of their worship culture - amazing! The temples are at one end of Chinatown and about 100m apart, so it's an easy walk.

The Tintin Shop in the Chinatown market strip is a must, awesome collectibles for everyone, even if you're not the biggest Tintin fan.

For good food walk down South Bridge Road to Maxwell road and jump into the iconic Maxwell Food Centre, heaps of options to choose from and all very reasonably priced!

Enjoy!!"

,,"Brilliant, a must see.",5.0,,"Really easy to get to on the MRT, then, just wander. It was just me and my teenage daughter, but we felt very safe, even at night. We walked through the streets for an afternoon, popping in the shops which were already for Chinese New Year, so very colourful. We bought some usual tourist tat, but also some silk kimonos, ending up with a very good price. We ate in a little hawker centre just near the Buddhist temple, really good chicken and friend rice for S$4, the only Europeans in there! I loved it here and feel we didn't see half of it. Give your self a good few hours, forget the map and just dive in all the little streets. Haggle in the shops for a bargain."
,,Typical chinese neighborhood,3.0,,Went there during city tour eith hoponhopoff bus. If you travel a lot and been in many chinese neighborhoods ypu wont be impressed but it is good. I bought all the small gifts to bring to my country form here..
,,Junk,4.0,,Must see on the to do list plenty of trinket junk stalls felt safe walking the streets and enjoyed walking around the food outlets .
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"This is the first place we visited in SG, i found it great for shopping for souvenirs and other novelty items. It was raining that day but still we manage to hide in stores. You can ask for discounts if you are shopping for more items."
,,Chinatown Singapore,4.0,,"On a recent holiday to Singapore with my partner and family we spent our first day visiting Chinatown. The area is very very easy to get to by the Metro line (by following signs for ""Chinatown"". Upon exiting the station and up to ground level we walked through Pagoda St which was beautifully coloured and decorated with hanging lanterns. We visited a few shops which sold a mixture of authentic items as well as some other ""tat"" but all the shopkeepers we spoke to were very pleasant and polite. We only bought small items token keyrings, fans and some small bites.

We visited the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple which was a small 5 minute walk from the station entrance. the building itself is a sigh to behold and inside the whole place is lined with so much colour. It was interesting from being a non-religious person to take in the different cultures and beliefs.

After our temple visit we walked around a few more stores and took a lot of extra photos, which took up a few hours in the morning. I would recommend anyone who hasn't visited here to visit."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"A brilliant place to visit, a must!! We are on the food stalls, shopped and had a full day here!! Loved it!!"

,,Good for souveniers,4.0,,Good place to pick up souveniers for your friends and relatives. Dont think apart from Arab Street there were any other place within Singapore where one can get great value for money stuffs.
,,A culturally interesting place,4.0,,"We arrived in Chinatown on a wet evening but that did not dampen our spirit. The food stalls were doing very brisk business and it was clean and cheap although the food was very delicious and there was a huge variety. The same food could cost a lot more in Australia where I live and not taste so authentic and fresh.
The shops were semi open due to the rain but I could sense the vibrancy that ran through the place. Chinatown gives you a sense of the people who are Chinese but Singaporean."
,,Nice atmosphere,4.0,,We enjoyed exploring Chinatown.I did some shopping in a jewellers in Temple St and had lunch in Smith st at a small restaurant which was air conditioned but not cheap.We also went through Chinatown Point where there is a supermarket and we bought some alcohol here to take back to our hotel

,,A place of chinese cultural exchange.,4.0,,"Chinatown is huge with a variety of food and sights. You can visit the temples, eat a variety of local chinese food, or even try food that is from China. Its good to bring small change as it would be easier to spend and also wear comfortable shoes as it can be quite tiring. If you would be going to the temples then make sure you are dressed properly, no short sleeves tops or shorts for females as they might not allow you in, they do have some attire to cover if your shorts are inappropriate. The place is accessible from Outram Park MRT all the way to Chinatown MRT, depending on which exit you would seeing different places. Just in case you get lost, go to the tourist booth in which they can tell you how to go about."
,,"We loved Chinatown, particularly for the cheap authentic eats",4.0,,We were fortunate to meet up with another couple and they took us to a number of places serving authentic Singaporean dishes in a kind of food hall in China Town. A gourmet food lovers delight.
,,Even a non-Chinese will have a good time.,4.0,,"I love people and culture so Chinatown is a place to explore and enjoy. I love the mornings rather than at night because I get to see and experience how the locals start the day be it for business or pleasure. Chinatown is a tourist attraction but still, if you take the time to stop and connect with the local people whose advice will help you find better places and bargains, especially since Chinese New Year is just around the corner. So get off the beaten track and save a little."
,,Must visit hassle and bustle,3.0,,Well worth visit. Maybe little tourist area but still worth visit. Lot's of local eatery to stop and watch tourist go by. Lot's of stuff to buy.
,,Chinatown for the Chinese New Year,4.0,,"Chinatown is decorated ready for the celebration of the Lunar Chinese New Year on 28 Jan 2017. More stalls are set up with lots and lots of Chinese New Year Goodies.
You do not need to buy anything, but just stroll and look at all the items on sales is good enough. This place really bring out the New Year MOOD...There are flowers..real and plastic ones...and also so much of food..candies...nut..cookies...the list is endless. You also get to see new product/gadgets on sales during this time of the year. Quickly go now!!"
,,China town,4.0,,We had a great time here in China Town by night . We dined there at a lovely restaurant on the corner in there and the food was great and it was good to sit outside as it was a very hot night. If you do not feel like walking hop onto a pedal bike in a group of 6 bikes and they tour you around to see this place.
,,Great place for a browse,4.0,,"Lovely to browse the stalls and shops and pick up your souvenirs, it's got plenty of places to eat and shop."
,,Great local food court nearby,4.0,,"mainly food and souvenirs shops, great place to stop for a beer on a hot day and people watch. There's a great food court nearby which is cheap but gets busy during lunch."
,,Good place for good food,3.0,,If you like Chinese food just go to the chinatown in singapore. The food is really good and have good portion too. It is open until late night. Many kind of food. It was good.
,,Great neighbourhood,5.0,,"It's a great place to spend a few hours wandering around the stores. Loads of odds and sods shops with plenty of places to grab some traditional Chinese cuisine and not to mention loads of beef jerky!!

Wish I was around for the Chinese New Year looks like it has the potential to amazing."
,,"Fun place to shop, but",4.0,,"Don't believe everything you hear, especially the sellers of authentic, 100% genuine chinese Jade. This Jade was found on the top of this holy mountain by a monk who died trying to get it back, for you to buy in chinatown at a really good price. Lol. Ok, maybe I embellished the story a little, but you get the idea. Lots of Jade around so haggle a good price because it will probably end up in a drawer in your house. You will also see lots of Chinese looking antique artifacts that appear very old. They come out of the factory like that, but hey, you're on vacation. If you haggle a good price then indulge. It will look cute in your curio cabinet."
,,Subpar taste of local culture,3.0,,"One thing the tiny island nation of Singapore can pride itself on is its multi-ethnicity and it is clearly reflected in this part of the city. However it seems too commercialised and made up, as if only a part of China the world expects to see is portrayed here and not the whole country. I also felt that, compared to other Chinatowns throughout the world, that this was expensive.
Lastly, I couldn't sample any of their food as it wasn't Halal. I wanted to try the 'century egg', for that i had to buy two which would have cost S$3.60 and made me question why I would waste it.
If you really want to see this place just dedicate less than an hour here using the SMRT."
,,Great for food and site seeing,5.0,,Great place to eat and buy souvenirs. There are also a number of temples well worth visiting; the Buddha Tooth Temple and Sri Mariamman. Smith Street is well worth visiting for food. Visit the stalls and buy a plate of whatever takes your fancy and eat in the communal seating area or go to one of the many restaurants in the area.
,,"Not like the ""Old days"" but still good",5.0,,Singapore in the 1970's was very different and exciting. It is now very clean and ordered and you find no end of souveniers
,,Not for us,3.0,,"Sorry to say that Chinatown was not for us.
Our main complaint was how dirty it was in contrast to the rest of Singapore.
It was so crowded too.
It's probably great if you are looking for bargain souvenirs to take back home though.
We planned to eat there but the general hygiene of the place made us leave within the first hour to seek refuge at nearby Clarke Quay"

,,A must see in Singapore!,5.0,,"Chinatown is beautiful. It has delicious foods, vibrant colours, fantastic smells and amazing buildings!

Would highly recommend coming here, it's easily accessible from the MRT too which stops right in the middle of Chinatown."
,,Food Row,4.0,,Food can be a bit expensive compared to hawker stall but just go with it and soak in the vibe. Very touristy and is a tourist trap. Easily accesible with the MTR. Go in the early evening so you can stroll minus the heat and then gorge!

Food options were pretty good but again lack of variety.

We had a very good massage upstairs at one of the many providers.

Free municipal wifi in the area.

Worth visiting if happens to visit the area (Buddha tooth relic temple and maxwell food centre) but overall a bit of a bland experience somewhat lacking in atmosphere (e.g much more going on in Chinatown in Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur)."
,,Fun shopping,4.0,,When you have tired of all the flashy designer shops on Orchard Road. Visit Chinatown to get back to the real Singapore.
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"A must-see in Singapour but I was personaly very disappointed, maybe because I had very high expectations.

Great houses/buildings for photographs lovers."
,,The only place to find goods in Singapore that are not exorbitant,5.0,,"You can find cheaply made stuff, but it was cheaper than the same quality goods go for in the US.

,,Cheap shopping,3.0,,Not the greatest customers service in places but overall most shop workers are amazingly awesome as the rest of singapore
,,Every city has a Chinatown,3.0,,Does not worth special visit as it is similar to any Chinatown across the world. You can buy cheap toys and clothes there. Good if you want to have a taste of Chinese food. Restaurants lining up the streets offer almost every cuisine from China. But we didn't try.

The food street is OVERPRICED."
,,LenR,4.0,,Take a trishaw ride round the Chinese quarter and let your guide tell you its history. Fascinating to see and here it's origins. The smell of spices is in the air at every turn.

Afterwards I dined at the Chinatown Seafood Restaurant in Pagoda Street...all in all not a bad way to finish the year."

Picked up some glass chilli hangers in different sizes, shop around as prices vary hugely. Other interesting items found at every shop, don't miss the shops tucked in behind the ones spilling onto the streets.

We settled in for a 'progressive dinner', with me finding the first couple of the dishes then the wife heading off for something different, both taking turns to find something unusual.

I'm not sure what it was called or exactly where she found it, it was a saucer style cup, like a champagne glass with no base filled, with mango gel balls and mango gelato. It was dynamite, full of flavour."
,,Great atmosphere and friendly people.,5.0,,"Chinatown is a little snapshot into the Chinese element of Singapore. It is decorated beautifully with Chinese lanterns strung above the bustling stalls. Our hotel was just down the road, however if you are travelling to Chinatown from elsewhere just use the MRT and get off at Chinatown.

There are lots of goods for sale here, from souvenirs to local food and everything in between. If food is your thing, there is a whole street dedicated to food (mainly Asian) which you can choose from.

All the stall holders are extremely friendly, and we found it very easy going and not pushy.

But, in saying that I'd still recommend a visit - just to see the place and buy the gifts for those back home.
The MRT takes you right to the doorstep."
,,Crowded,3.0,,"If you can avoid weekend that'd be great. Take public transport. Having said that Chinatown is filled with goodies, and I'm not talking about the cheap China made souvenirs but things like arts and crafts shop on top of people's park. As well as various shop selling fabric that's much lesser than Spotlight and of good quality. Also if you need to fix your shoes this is also a good place to do so.
There are also shop selling daily toiletries (and yes some branded too) that's much cheaper than supermarket. These are usually the reason for our visit to Chinatown."
,,Street shopping paradise..,4.0,,"So, this place is great for some inexpensive retail therapy. You practically get everything here. Curios, antiques, clothes, household items etc..you name it and it is there.

I was particularly impressed by the art shops that carried some inspiring work and the Tintin shop that just took my breath away. There are a lot of eating joints where you can rest your tired feet and eat a morsel or two.

Go here in the evening. the weather will be bearable."
,,Old meets Modern.,5.0,,"This is a China Town different from any others elsewhere: the buildings remain unchanged over the last 100 years. The whole area is full of buildings with individual character. Once you walk through the shops, you will feel like walking in any street in China. They sell everything you can think of related to China. It is a must for any visitor."
,,Great food a shopping experience in the middle of the city,4.0,,"Singapore""s Chinatown is situated in the centre of the city and houses countless shops and restaurants featuring the food of the various provinces of China."
,,Average,3.0,,"The standard tourist bits. Would have liked to find more of the Chinese. The little lndia area was much better, some tourist but for the locals with their shops, jewellery store and clothing markets."
,,Local place but very interesting,5.0,,"There are varieties of foods, local products and other handmade product which is really interesting. The best thing in China town is FOOD. Great and cheap."
,,Lots to do here!,4.0,,"Using the MRT, I got off at the Chinatown Station. There are many food hawkers selling cheap and delicious dishes, clothing, fruits, baked goods, traditional Chinese medicines, souvenirs, etc.

Crossing the bridge, I visited also the other areas of Chinatown. A museum, temples, restaurants, shops can be found here."
,,Nice street market here,5.0,,I met up with a friend here and we had fun wandering the street market and then eating some street food. Great value for money
,,Typical China Town with lots of Shops.,3.0,,There were lots of different shops with cheap stuff. The shop owners very not too friendly or helpful. We did buy a few item
,,Just another China town,3.0,,"There really wasn't much here.
We ended up here around lunchtime so most of the temples were closed.
We strolled around the markets but it was pretty ordinary.

It you are looking to fill time then come here.
If you have limited time suggest you try somewhere else."
,,Fun and Food,5.0,,Went to the Buddhatooth Temple and wandered throughout Chinatown for a few hours. Relaxing spot to kill some time and grab some bites.
,,Fascinating!,5.0,,"Singapore Chinatown is quite different to those I have visited in other cities around the world, with a broader range of shops and restaurants, not just those in sanitised malls. We walked around and stopped for Dim Sum at a small restaurant and were delighted with the choice and with the food provided. It was excellent value to, and service was friendsly and efficient.
The shops and stalls were colourful and interesting - the displays of decorations were particularly striking."
,,Good range of food and souvenirs,4.0,,We stayed close to Chinatown and enjoyed the food and amenities. Good shopping and also one of the few remaining fish spas.
,,Singapore As It Once Was,4.0,,This is a fun place to visit and soak up the local culture and see Singapore as it once was. There are myriads of small shops and restaurants in the various streets that make up Chinatown.Access is easy via the MRTS.
,,Facinating,4.0,,Great cultural experience if you are from the West. I spent hours today walking around in and out of shops and bars. Recommended
,,Really nice Chinatown,5.0,,Had a nice visit to the cleanest Chinatown I have been to. Such a nice place and nice food. Even had a big roof over the whole thing in case of rain. Toilets were also clean and nice.
,,a must do in singapore,5.0,,such colourful and bustling streets filled with food and shopping. you can find some really good knick knacks around. most things have prices already so no need to barter unless you really want to try! make sure to have cash.
,,"Same old, same old",3.0,,"Let's be honest, Chinatown is the same in every city. It was fine but it's basically just people trying to sell you tat and lots of fried food. Beautiful hindu temple at the entrance though!"
,,Must!,5.0,,"Plan your visit ahead because there is too much to see and all is beautiful and fun. Little shopes resturants pharmacy and tempels full with great atmosphere. Feels like china.... All is decorated, colorful and cheap. There are many buses geting there so no problem just enjoy. we spent there 3 hours."
,,Souvenir shopping,4.0,,"Great place to pick up souvenirs. Lots of stalls with people selling local ""stuff"". Inexpensive souvenirs. Lots of fun. Easily accessed from the Hop Off HopOn bus."
,,Get lost in multi-cultured roads!,5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is the place where you can get lost happily in the streets. Colourful buildings with temples, churches and mosques, old chinese boutique coffee houses and unlimited chinese foods await you in every corner. One day is not enough to discover!"
,,Plenty of bargains,4.0,,Loved Chinatown with its colourful outside market. Lots of sheepish souvenirs to buy including lovely Christmas baubles. In the malls different thought I was in China as locals enjoyed food from their homeland. Well worth a visit.
,,A Singapore must visit,4.0,,"Though rather touristy, Chinatown is a must visit. It has a lot of character and one appreciate the great atmosphere despite the numbers. Take the MRT there and back and go on to another must visit, Little India."
,,Cheap Eats and Souvenirs,4.0,,Place to go for cheap and authentic Singapore eats. Meals range from S$5-10 and you get the feeling of eating like a local.
,,Budget eating and shopping,4.0,,"I am curious about the hainanese chicken rice, since I've watched it many times in youtube. I want to try it. I went to chinatown complex and ordered one for my lunch. It's Ok with chili sauce. I felt bad I am already full with the hainanese chicken and sugar cane juice, when I came across the michelen star Liao Fan HongKong Soya sauce chicken rice & noodles! But anyways I have something to look forward for another visit in singapore. Maybe next time with family. Shopping at chinatown, I am not so interested since I only came there to eat and sight seeing."
,,Nice way to spend a few hours.,5.0,,"Walking around, looking at all the kitschy stuff on sale. The old buildings housing the various shops are great. What really makes it worth the visit is the hawkers food market inside it. The variety of Chinese dishes is really amazing. And it is not too dear either."
,,Lots of quirky things to buy,5.0,,It is busy & bustling but fun. I picked up some fun things to bring home. It took me awhile to find it because there is also a travel agents area close that could be China Town
,,Good for Food,3.0,,"Chinatown is a maze with major food centers just about everywhere. Each has its own speciality types of food, but I'd say you pretty much can't go wrong with any of them. So five stars for food. But if you're going there for shopping, save yourself the time. Dried goods for cooking are fine, but pretty much everything else is a hodge-pudge of second-rate stuff that's just not worth getting. Clothing might be cheaper in price, but if you have to replace it after only a couple of uses, is it a value? No. similar with most other stuff.

So, go for the food, the history and the ambience, but not the shopping."
,,Chinatown Singapore style,4.0,,"If you would like to experience China without the pollution, getting a visa etc. you are definitely right to visit Chinatown in Singapore. The shopping street starts when leaving the MRT station (""Chinatown"") and you can still make some good deals here (more expensive compared to China for sure). Temple of the sacred tooth is also nice to see.
We never felt unsafe, it's Chinatown Singapore style, so nice!!"
,,Great place for foods,5.0,,"You can find out many excellent food stall in this area. Michelin-star Chicken rice, bak kuh teh, laksa, chak kway teo, and some other awesome foods. Try Smith street food complex. Also you can buy some kinds of roasted pork as gift for you friends as it is very tasty. At night, after going around enjoying foods, you can take a short MRT to Clark quay for other activites alongside a channel."
,,Nothing special really. Just touristy souvenirs and food,3.0,,"After living for 3 years in Bangkok, night market is something we visit on a weekly basis. And I have to say this Chinatown is not as authentic as Chinatown in Bangkok. Food and souvenirs are touristy and overpriced.
There was nothing special about the place at all. I very much enjoyed more Arab Street because it had lots of places with street authentic food and the atmosphere was more welcoming and colourful."
,,Lots of bargains,4.0,,"A good place for a walk, some chopping and a bite to eat. Lots of shopping options and a good place to pick up a few gifts to take home. Enjoyable for kids too."
,,Nice!,4.0,,"Great food and a bunch of tacky stuff you don't really need, but a fun experience. Glad they kept these small patches of historic architecture in place. Keeps some of the ""old charm"" of Singapore despite the recent modernization. Come armed with cash- many of the street vendors don't take card!"
,,Feels Like china,4.0,,You sure have to Go to Chinatown and take a lunch or diner At the foodcourt! Not so clean but the Food is good and cheap. And we did Like to be between the Chinese people
,,Time Travel,4.0,,Being here was something remarkable. To witnessed the old and the new blended in very well in harmony. From the classic chinatown entrance gate to the modern mall nearby. Every corner of this distric has their own history and story
,,Staying in Chinatown,4.0,,"We stayed in a hotel on the edge of Chinatown and enjoyed the experience. Very busy and yes the stalls are all orientated around the tourist trade but walking around once was fun. There is so much else to see though. We did a walking tour and were taken to at least four different religious centres including a Hindu temple , the Buddhist Temple of the Sacred tooth and the first temple that was built when immigrants from China arrived in Singapore. One of the hidden treasures for us was the Heritage Centre which shows what living and working was like for the people from China.Food well right next to the centre is a pasty stand and the curried pasties are wonderful! You can find chilli crab everywhere but definitely go into the hawkers food market and experience the great food in a very fast moving, crowded atmosphere. One hawker actually has a michelin star, the only one held for a stall! Easy to spot , it has the longest queue and people there will wait up to an hour to be served!Easy to spend a day there."
,,Fun and Interesting,5.0,,"We went to buy a ""24 hour jacket"" we had one made it was excellent pure raw silk, made in the time promised, beautiful fit, charming service, a little pushy but no more than I would have expected. Raffles Tailors can be recommended."
,,Top spot in Singapore!,5.0,,A great place to eat and browse. Some great architecture on display including Pagoda and temples. A popular spot for tourists and locals.
,,Cheap Shopping average food,5.0,,"Same old same old tourst shops - not so authentic anymore - but fun to walk through the lanes. Food didn't seem that great this time - also a problem finding a place to eat that you could also buy a drink - then only Singapore Beer available, but so hot Shandy's were good for the girls"
,,A mini visit to mainland China!,5.0,,Diverse shopping experience from inexpensive trinkets and souvenirs to high end jewelry and clothing. Definitely worth a visit.
,,A Good place for cheap meal and drinks.,5.0,,I really like coming here. I think it's a good place to visit if you come to Singapore. The Chinatown in Singapore is also clean so it makes it a nice place to visit. It's a place to see Singapore culture as well as cheap food and drinks.
,,"Souvenirs, and cinese products",4.0,,"The place is always plenty of people, and the food street is very convinient and good quality, i advice to try salted egg jork crab, and you can find any kind of souvenirs there, it is a good point to visit, i like it so much that i book my hotel over there, there are 2 temples over there i think buddist and indu also, i put some pics"
,,Not as good as expected,3.0,,On first glance this bustling shopping mecca appears the place to be to get your bargins in Singapore when shopping. I found it to be all similar items in the shops and bartering was hard. It is however a great place to get some cheap food and admire the architecture. Access here is easy with an MRT station smack bang in the middle called Chinatown.
,,Chinatown,3.0,,Just the part of town you can see chinese culture. Good to visit if you have lot of time and the weather is not so cold.
,,We are not shoppers but foodies,4.0,,Loved the selection of food on offer and the atmosphere here. We stayed right in the heart of china town near MRT. Loved the location. Had a ball!
,,Great shopping spot,5.0,,"Great place to wander and get lost in. Shopping on the street is extremely cheap but mostly holiday based items like charms, chopsticks, engraved gems etc. Very easy to get to on the downtime train line and food was delicious on the street. The temples located around the area are a must see as well."
,,Shopping,4.0,,"Great place for bric brac to bring home. Great fun for some easy going food and drinks. Well worth a visit. I do shopping daytime and visit for food in the evening. You can pick up ""kimono"" for a bargain. Do not go to the tailors. Check the price. Same items differ very much door to door."
,,A little china in singapore,4.0,,You can find a lot chinese gift store and chinese food restaurants in this place. You can buy chinese cultural object and gift from here. But you should bargain with them to better prices
,,Chinatown is China Town again,4.0,,Chinatown is China Town again thanks to the recent new immigrants from China. The southern Chinese influence may be gone but the other parts of China are nicely represented. Makes for better and wider Chinese food choices in Singapore
,,A New Discovery every time,5.0,,"I like spending the afternoon roaming through Chinatown. It is not very big so you can walk it in no time. But if you bother to stop at the temples or the little shops along the five foot way your always discover some thing new.

Unique to Singapore~ you'd find a mosque next to a Chinese temple next to a Hindu temple. Everyone seems to co-exist and it gives the area a rich flavour. You'd need to remove your shoes when you visit the Hindu temple so you might want to bring a plastic bag to carry them around if you are not inclined to leave them outside. I hope you are lucky enough to visit during a festival!

The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple / Museum is an interesting place ~ there is a small exhibition where you can learn about the life of Budhha. Right at the top of the temple you can ask for blessings from a monk. I am not sure what the ritual is but I have seen believers seeking blessings being ""hit"" by what looked like palm leaves.

There is lots of different foods you can try in Chinatown ~ not just Chinese food. My advice is to treat a little of everything so don't overboard ordering too big a portion.

The hawker center has shops underneath it so it's good for souvenirs. If you are so minded for the cheapest Michelin Star meal in the world ~you can visit the chicken rice stall up in the gasket center."
,,busy,4.0,,"great food and shops for souvenirs close to everything, decorations where amazing very friendly shop keepers"
,,Nice experience,4.0,,"We really enjoyed strolling around Chinatown. It is super clean with colorful shops and restaurants. The night market is cool, you can buy cheap souvenirs for friends or family"
,,Busy and buzzy,5.0,,We went to food street for lunch on two days and enjoyed both experiences. The shopping can be junky but there are some good stores too. Everything from souvenirs to jewellery to tea.
,,"Great busy delicious food courts with 2 Michelin prizing chefs...reasonable prices but long queue,if u can wait ?",4.0,,"Great choices.Asian, Japanese,Western & others ,lots of foreigners & tourists are up there for the delicious tasty foods in Singapore....inexpensive & great deals to fill up your hungry appetites........ Even if u are a vegetarian person. ..

Western or Chinese, not a problem, eating there for lunch & dinner"
,,Fun fun fun,5.0,,"Take time to wander around this wonderful collection of Chinese shops. In the middle of Chinatown is the Chinese heritage centre well worth a visit. The shops seem to have all their cheap wares in the front then there is a space between the front shop proper which enables you to walk from shop to shop without getting wet during the monsoon rains, then the shop proper which will be air-conditioned then has the more expensive goods for sale. Tourist style restaurants mingle with in the shops food is tasty and plentiful and always provides a nice cold beer. Lots of bargains to be had, careful not to breathe in as you walk past the durian fruit"
,,Cultural sensations,5.0,,"I have been to many China towns in many major cities but this one is such a riot of color, culture and fun! The temples are a must and open to the public and it is an area that is small enough to experience thoroughly in a few hours"
,,Astonishing!,5.0,,"I felt I went to china! The place is pure but it has the same system of Singapore, cleanness and security. The street food is really tasty and not expensive Must go!"
,,The Chinatown,5.0,,"I have to say that this was the cleanest Chinatown ever that I have been. The stores and stalls offer a lot of choices and you can get discounts just look around. Easy access to the Chiatown station, restaurants, bars, hawker places and temples."
,,the food the food,5.0,,Another one of singapore's must see location which leaves no room for disappointment. It's clean and also very entertaining to the tourists. The food will leave you speechless. Amazing place in every way.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,One of my favourite places in Singapore. Just say no to anyone offering to sell you jewellery. Thoroughly enjoyed a walk through the Buddhist temple. A visit to Mei Heong Yuen Dessert is a must.
,,China in Singapore,5.0,,You don't really see much sign of Chinese culture in Singapore as such. Singapore is very modern - when I was in Singapore I did not get any massive influence of china. But if you visit China town you will get that authentic feel of China (just within the China town).
,,Great Food,4.0,,Good half day attraction looking around the different parts of China Town. Don't miss the temples. Great cheap food.
,,Not a big fan,3.0,,Its a totaly opposite side of Singapore however much better than other cities I have visited and much more planned . Great place to buy cheap Souvenirs
,,"Great place to walk around, shop and eat",5.0,,"I loved Chinatown in SG. A great place to soak up some of the local culture. The food available at the Hawker stalls is amazing and incredibly cheap at £3-5 for a large portion, with Tiger beer available to $6. There's lots to do in and around Chinatown, so I'd certainly make the effort to visit."
,,Touristy but fun,5.0,,"Great for a cheap meal, massage or nasty souvineers. Loved the old shopfront terraces too. Pretty at night all lit up with the lanterns."
,,Lively,5.0,,"Loved this area of Singapore, so lively and colorful. People friendly and it was fun to haggle about prices. So many places to eat. Went to a Chinese pharmacy and they have Chinese doctors who specialize in holistic healing."
,,"Visit the four towns in Singapore, including Chinatown, little India, Heritage village and the Malay town.",4.0,,"There is a lot of diversity in Singapore; for a full experience, take the hop on, hop off bus and visit the four towns in the city. Chinatown is very good and it offers multiple sites to see, restaurants and shops. Once you have visited this one, visit the other three, including little India, heritage village and the Malay/Middle Eastern part of town; each one of them offers different sites to see, different restaurants and shops. Great way to spend a couple of days."
,,"Great food, shopping, lodging in Chinatown",5.0,,"It was fun to stay in the heart of Chinatown (on Food St, or Smith St) and to enjoy all the eating possibilities and great, cheap shopping. Very authentic and lively. Loved it!"
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,"Being an Indian, we preferred staying near Chinatown and not in Little India, just to experience a different world around us and to share, it wasn't so bad an idea. We have little difficulty in getting pure vegetarian food :) but even my parents enjoyed the stay. The people had been friendly, full of smiles,lots of food options (not to say non veg options) and I loved trying different options. I have to say, everyone visiting Singapore should plan to include a walk in the evening around the Chinatown."
,,"Small, but quiet are that is a joy to walk through",5.0,,"I had been looking for a particular style shirt that is from China. My wife had found the shirt for me and when we walked around, there were lots of deals as well as places that looked like they would be great to eat at(we had already ate before coming to Chinatown). With most of the shops, you are barter to reduce the price which my wife and I did when we foudn the shirts that I had wanted. I would recommend coming before lunch time so you can shop and then eat."
,,Average Chinese Market,3.0,,"Hot and humid, and one of the few places I actually saw people smoking. Very hard to catch a cab when leaving. Open air markets, very congested. Lots of places but basically the same stuff in different tents and stores. No haggling over prices. Very typical for Chinatown in many big US cities like NYC and Philly."
,,Colourful Bustling...Must go if not stay,5.0,,"Every town has its own Chinatown. It's colourful and bustling in the early part of the day and eclectic in the night. Full of yum food, knick-knacks in every corner. Do go even if it's for a visit."
,,"Perfect day, lots of collors...and history",5.0,,"Take few hours for the walk. Very beatiful place, architecture, collors and food. Walk through the market and then cross the road to club street for the bars, restaraunts and more of singapore history. Just amazing"
,,"Food, drink and shopping",4.0,,This Chinatown is clan well laid out with shops and restaurants on the main floors or the old buildings....step off the MRT stop and your right there in Chinatown.
,,"Nice area, good food",4.0,,"Worth a visit, easily accessible by train, there is a shopping centre, a market and lots of nice authentic places to eat."
,,FASCINATING!,4.0,,Just wandering around Chinatown is very interesting - there is a surprise round every corner. Call into the market where the locals shop and wander down the little alleyways where you will find even more interesting things.
,,Not just like all others...,4.0,,"This is such a nice place for a chill afternoon walk. Lots of shops and restaurants but no hassle to buy and no pushing. The temples around there are beautiful and the ice cold sugar cane juice offers a nice break from the hot, humid weather."
,,Colourful Chinatown,4.0,,"Full of people, food, great shopping for the family to bring home from a trip. Lots and lots of stalls the street for this is Pagoda Street had a good shop here great choices. The street for food is Smith street, go up and down the street first to see what food is available and what you want first. The best time to go there is after 5.30pm when everything is in full swing and soak up the a atmosphere."
,,Chinatown Day or Night,4.0,,A visit here is worth while to see Chinatown in its glory. Singapore is made up of many nationalities but the biggest over 70% is Chinese.
,,Very Nice Tourist Attraction,4.0,,"Great prices, good food and a lot of sights to see. A good place to buy souvenirs and see authentic Chinese culture in action."
,,Its a small china in singapore,5.0,,"All chinese food lovers come here for lunch, dinner or for brunch. All chinese food restaurant and raw materials like meat also available at this market."
,,Chinatown,5.0,,"There is a currency and stamps gathering place on Sunday at Chinatown market third floor. You can find China , Malaysia and Singapore old notes and old stamps there."
,,Buzzing,5.0,,"It's a buzzing part of the city and should not be missed, to really enjoy the area go early in the morning and you won't be jostled or in the evening when it's lit up and lively. It the middle of the day it's heaving and not that enjoyable. The shops are all selling the same staple wares, there is good quality to be had, more so round the periphery and of course the Chinese are masters of ageing articles so be ware but still a great place with an mrt station right by it."
,,Antiseptic chinatown,3.0,,"Singapore chinatown is nice and clean. It has many attractions, restaurants and souvenir stores. At night they cordoned the streets and restaurateurs peddle their cuisines to awaiting customers. It's an experience worth having. A good tip on selecting a very good establishment is to use your nose and smell the aroma of the food or check where others are going. Remind you, even in chinatown, food is not cheap!

For me, I didn't quite feel the authenticity of other chinatown I've visited. I was looking for fresh fruits, vegetables, meat and seafood but nowhere to be found. I saw one fruit stand and I saw pre-packaged fruits. I was highly disappointed. It's not your SF, NY and certainly not hong kong"
,,A great experience,4.0,,Fantastic example of a market area with numerous stalls and eateries. Easy to get to with a train nearby or a cheap taxi ride from Marina bay sands.
,,Good place to buy souvenir,4.0,,"Good place to shop especially for souvenirs. Lots of cheap items, key chains, fridge magnets, t-shirts, shopping bags, etc. at low price."
,,A bit tacky,4.0,,Aimed squarely at the tourist market. The architecture is interesting and there are some local shrines for those interested. Don't bother with Pagoda St or the outdoor food area if you are looking for anything genuinely Singaporean.
,,Cultural side of Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore is famous for being a bit too rigid, so it's always great to be in a cultural pocket like China Town. See and experience first hand how the chinese culture influences the modern day Singapore and enjoy the chinese street food which is not only delicious, but cheap as well!

Oh and I stumbled on a Tintin shop smacked in the middle of Chinatown. And odd yet interesting discovery!"
,,Make sure you visit and capture a taste of old Singapore,5.0,,"There is a metro station right in the centre of Chinatown. Take two or three hours to walk around, see many of the old buildings, cafes, shops, restaurants and market and soak up old Singapore.

Of course, there are lots of tourist bits and pieces, but there are also wonderful things to see and smell."
,,Great place to eat,5.0,,"Whenever I am in Singapore I come here to eat, good variety of food, not expensive and always lots to see."
,,One of the more authentic parts of Singapore,4.0,,"I enjoyed Chinatown as I found it to be more authentic than other part of Singapore. I especially enjoyed the area away from the malls, exploring the small streets, sidewalk restaurants/cafes and strolling through the hawker food areas and markets selling all kinds of cheap trinkets."
,,Ok to visit,3.0,,"Plenty of shops and stalls busy with local people and tourists. We had a light lunch in a small cafe near the station, the spring rolls were excellent"
,,HEAVEN LOADED WITH FOOD,5.0,,"Chinatown is always the best idea for you when you are looking for the taste of Asian cuisines. There is one hawker center beside Chinatown OG building where you can order many Chinese dishes including Mala curry, Dumplings and Wanton noodle soup and so on. There are also many food stalls at another side of the street where THE CRAB LOVERS can experience the great taste of the crab curry in the town at the very reasonable price."
,,Markets,4.0,,"Like most Chinatowns. Lots of markets, the Indian and Chinese temples were interesting as was the museum."

,,Same same but differnt souvenirs and food,3.0,,"Worth a visit if you have the time. Cheap items for sale and lots of the same stalls offering souvenirs. Good food and great atmosphere, try heading to the otherside of the main road to get into the local markets for some real cheap yummy food and goods."
,,Restaurants and street food galore!,4.0,,"Before choosing where among dozens of eateries to dine, one should take note of the architecture and history of old Singapore -- most impressive. I ate at two of the dining spots, and both served Asian cuisine that was quite good and reasonably priced."
,,Great food,5.0,,"We went here several times, the malls in the area cater to every budget. The market stalls sell everything you can think off and you can pick up some great tat and souvenirs. Maxwell Road hawker centre fed us several times on our holiday. Great wonton noodles, chicken rice, steam buns, smoothies and gyoza. There are temples and street food. Really lively day and night. A must visit."
,,Look no further for a China experience while visiting China,4.0,,"We've visited Singapore several times and we always make a point of visiting China town. As with everything in Singapore, it is clean and has plenty to both see and do. Start by walking over the main road walking bridge and meander through the main area of shops. Don't forget about the side streets as they often are overlooked and are sometimes more hungry for your business and provide the best deals.

At the end, there is a beautiful temple where you can mingle with the locals and get a better sense of the rich culture that is pulled together to create this amazing city-state.

Take your time and look for deals. They don't bargain as hard as they do in China but there are great deals to be had if you look. - TravelingU"
,,Must Go,5.0,,Great shopping and food restaurants many shops to go too.Need time to have a good look around very intersting place.
,,Good place for food.,5.0,,"I would stay in Chinatown, forget the hawker center, but peek in the temple. This has to be the cleanest China town I have ever been to. Nice place to walk around and get duck, chicken just about everything."

,,Worth visiting,4.0,,Liked the street market and associated shops which were good for browsing. Easy to get there as Chinatown mrt stop is good starting place.
,,A must for any Singapore Visitor,5.0,,"I would advise any visitor to Singapore to add a visit to China Town to their itinerary. Firstly there a variety of shops and some real bargains if souvenirs are required.

We also dined in Chinatown, wehad the most delightful evening meal of ""Black Pepper Crab"" and Tiger beer. I cannot recall the restaurant's name, but it has a ""sprooker"" out front that advised all passerby's that he remembered them!! Quite entertaining!

The night was a great experience .

Chinatown was easy to get to on the MRT."
,,Feel of China,3.0,,"When you in Chinatown, you will feel you in China. Shopaholic can shop from here at very reasonable prices."
,,Facinating,5.0,,Marvellous wander of the streets of Chinatown! Bag a bargain eat or just enjoy a taste of local culture
,,Must see,5.0,,"If you want to eat well and cheaply ,take a stroll down smith street Loads of clean well maintained booths serving every type of Chinese food Cooked as you wait Afterwards stroll along adjacent Pagoda St shops for souvenirs"
,,Very interesting place to visit.,4.0,,This is a must see for any visitor to Singapore. The area is always bustling with activity particularly in the street food area. The only problem is that there is so much choice it's hard to decide what and where to eat.
,,"Great shopping, hunt for the bargains.",5.0,,"Great experience, got some fantastic bargains on souvenirs and clothes. But just shop around abit, there are plenty of stalls selling the same things but at different prices."
,,Looking for good and cheapp eats? Try Chinatown,4.0,,"Don't go to Chinatown for scenery. Well, maybe if you are into old shophouses. Go there for (1) souvenirs, and (2) probably this is where you can find the best local food in Singapore. There are various restaurants with their own specialties. Look for that popular (among locals) one which serves fish head with XO (I think this is a Chinese wine) in a soup . Or go the Chinatown hawker centre where you can find one of the only two Michellin-starred hawker food stalls in Singapore - the HK roast chicken rice. Hard to miss. There is always a long queue. Be prepared to queue up for up to 2 hours on a busy day. But if you dont have the patience, I think the other food stalls have equally good quality at cheap prices. Be adventurous.

Easily accessible by bus or MRT (there is an MRT station right in Chinatown."
,,Typical Chinatown,4.0,,Covering a largish area with many market stalls selling anything and everything at reasonable prices plus lots of eateries.
,,A must in Singapore,5.0,,"Here you find the affordable souvenirs and food stalls. Everything is just affordable compared to other markets. The laksa in Chinatown Seafood Restaurant is so good and you should not miss visiting that restaurant when in Chinatown. Try the ice cream sandwich too, stalls are everywhere."
,,You know you are a long way from home when you get here,5.0,,We spent a whole day here browsing in all the wonderful little gift shops and eating in the food street. If you want a taste of the orient then come here it's fab.
,,A great place for souvenirs,4.0,,"I've been to the 'China town' of several cities, and I really liked this one. They had a real variety of things, so I would imagine there is something for everyone. There are the little streets lined with various stalls, and then there is the big market near the Buddhist temple. My only advice is to look around before you buy anything, as prices vary from stall to stall (sometimes even for the exact same item)."
,,Great place for food and culture,4.0,,"This is a place that serves the best bakuteh, zhichar and desserts. Plenty to see! Both day and night are great."
,,Busy but good deals,4.0,,A range of products and services available from food to massage. Very busy however but great to get in the hustle of this quaint area. Worth a trip to bugis Street and the tailors.
,,Little Chinatown,5.0,,"We found Chinatown to be about a 20 minute walk from Robertson Quay where we were staying and a bit tricky because of having to navigate busy city streets. But with map in hand finally stumbled across the entrance. It was a rainy day so a lot of the first stalls in the weather were covered over, but as you move inside there's a bit more of a roof, so easier to see what's on offer. The best shop I thought was the $2 shop with lots of purses, makeup type purses with 5 inside for $1. Lots of souvenir nick nacks for kids and adults for $1, $2 and $3. I stocked up on gifts there. Lots of clothes shops with prices ranging from $5 upwards. A fabulous eating street with all types of delicious food at very reasonable prices, around about $8 a main and upwards. The beer was still expensive of course, but you expect that in Singapore.
Worth the trip there but a lot smaller than I expected."
,,A happy hour wandering through the stalls,4.0,,"Went to Chinatown as it was close to our hotel, and spent a happy hour wandering around the stalls selling cheap souvenirs. I wouldn't buy anything here if you're after quality, but it's a good place for cheap souvenirs and iPhone leads. We didn't eat there, but many of the restaurants looked good."
,,Look past the tat...,5.0,,"Chinatown is a must visit for any Singapore visitor. It is a bustling hive of activity, but there are some interesting things to be found if you look past the numerous stalls selling key chains and t shirts at rock bottom prices. Hidden behind these you will find shops selling antiques or laquer ware, which are far more authentic. For true authenticity though, you should visit the wet market in the morning or sample a durian!

Take time to visit the museum and get an idea where Singapore came from..."
,,"Row after row of ""bargains"" Oh, and the food!",5.0,,"You've been to flea markets where ten vendors all sell the same wares in different guises. Triple it. Bargains, I'm not so sure."
,,Really interesting and some good bargains to find,4.0,,"We really enjoyed looking around Chinatown. The volume of people and items for sale is exciting - plenty of noise and hustle and bustle!! I had some shirts made by a tailor there and, although a bit pricey, were really good quality. The temples in the area were also interesting."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is a very large and busy area, as perhaps would be expected of a city such as this in the far East. The shops were packed with the usual tourist 'bargains' but it's fascinating looking at the brightly coloured shops. There are also surprises as you turn a corner a come across huge pagoda's or temples."
,,Gets all the senses going.,5.0,,Definitely visit for cheap food and beer. Watch the world go by in such a fascinating city. Lots of cheap souvenirs.
,,Always delicious,5.0,,"There are so many restaurants in Chinatown, it's difficult to specify just the one that is great. Have a good look around, check prices and see the selection. Some of them are averagely priced (for Singapore) for a good meal with drinks be prepared to shell out S$50 a person. All dishes are delish. Shopping? Typical tourist stuff. Could give that a miss"
,,Nice place for cheap shopping,4.0,,"Ok so if you are looking to pick up local some junk stuff or souvenirs, this is the best place. wide variety of products at very cheap cost and surprisingly quite good quality. very vibrant street."
,,Chinese New Year Experience,5.0,,Busy & lively at the best of times I wouldn't go again at CNY. Loads to see do & taste the shops sell everything from lanterns to paper money.
,,Cheap food and souvenirs,4.0,,"This is definitely the best place to buy stuff for your loved ones before you head back from Singapore. Bargain is absolutely available here, especially you make bulk purchase! You can eat at the nearby food stalls, having authentic milk tea and ""pork rib soup"" here"
,,Great attraction to visit,4.0,,Chinatown was an easy walking distance form my Hotel. Very good Chinese food available right thru this area.Some good buying for silk and other clothing. They make clothes etc in 24 hours good quality. Lots of quality souvenirs
,,"A great day out in Chinatown, Singapore",5.0,,"We visited on a Sunday morning whilst staying in Singapore. We found a wonderful flea market on the edge of Chinatown and eventually found our way into Chinatown which was extremely busy and bustling with people, shops and market stalls. Anything and everything was for sale and there were many good cafes and restaurants to eat at. There was much to see, including a very interesting temple and we found the markets incredibly interesting. It was a great day out and we are so pleased that we made the effort to seek out Chinatown ! :-) :-)"
,,Worth a look,4.0,,Definitely go and check out all the bargain stalls. A lot of them sell the same stuff but if you are looking for inexpensive souvenirs/gifts then you must go here. Also some good food available in the vicinity.
,,chinatown in Singapore,4.0,,"visit China town and get an experience of China.
a good place to buy souveniers like cute chop sticks/fridge magnets ...
a lot of chinese stuff on sale ..bags, caps, toys, etc etc.....also you can pick up a traditional chinese outfit if you wish to have one.
once shopping is over, sit at any of the eateries and enjoy a Chinese meal ..
recommended"
,,Great to stroll through,4.0,,All sorts of interesting things to look at here. Bargains in amongst the tacky tourist stuff can be found. Good place to grab a bit to eat or just browse especially if it's raining as there's plenty of places to shelter and undercover street sections.
,,Amalgamation of cultures,5.0,,"Chinatown is the center of Singapore. close to every place and a central hub for MRT. If you are visiting Singapore as a tourist I would highly recommend to stay in Chinatown as all the tourist attractions are close by and well connected through the MRT.
The nigh market is amazing and a great way to get those souvenirs for friends back home."
,,worth a visit,3.0,,"There are two parts to Chinatown in Singapore, a new and old. The new is relatively spacious, clean and sparsely populated. The old is more traditional. While far less densely packed than the Kowloon district of Hong Kong it has a bit of that feel. The area is worth visiting to experience this district and just because it exists."
,,Its very affordable,3.0,,"30mins subway (MRT) ride from the airport. Most eating places do not start serving until 11am. Street vendors in carts have the best food, not the restaurants. Heard of Michelin star rated hawker centers? This is where it is. Great shopping for Jewelry and electronics, some souvenirs... there are temples here if you want to see one."
,,great food,5.0,,we love viviting chinatown whenever we visit Singapore. The food is good value and fabulous. Stuff for sale is not high quality but the whole area is vibrant and fun
,,Best Asian food anywhere,5.0,,"Easy to get to by public transport, a great place to find a meal. Very clean place especially for a Chinatown, with lots of stalls selling souvenirs mostly, and the eateries are out of this world.

My family of 5 feasted for a paltry 50usd. We ate at the main outdoor food court which had so many places to choose from that everyone was able to find something they liked.

Don't be afraid to try the food stalls / street food, Singapore is very clean and safe to eat anywhere. A couple of the food stalls here have Michelin stars, and there are a few more that will no doubt obtain one soon. Keep an eye out for the stalls with the really long queue, their food is usually the best. And don't let the queues put you off, they are very fast and I didn't have to wait any longer than 10mins"
,,Busy market,3.0,,There is much of the same at the majority of the stores. Many tailors if you are looking for some unique but didn't feel the costs were anything special. Suggest pick your time when attending as it gets very hot in the markets. People very friendly
,,Interesting place to walk around. Nice temples and markets.,4.0,,"Nice place for a stroll. The temples are interesting (especially the Chinese temple), if seen during active prayer and chanting. Lots a small shops to buy souvenirs but they open late, after 11:00AM. Have a late breakfast/coffee. A few interesting, inexpensive food courts with local delicacies."
,,Buzzling place - I loved it!,5.0,,"If you bring children to this place, chances are you will spend s long time there. So much to take in, so much to see. The atmosphere is great!"
,,Cheap shopping.,4.0,,Like most China Towns in the world today. I recommend China Town in Singapore for those who are after cheaper souvenirs and clothing. Plenty of places to eat there as well at a reasonable price.
,,Not as Good as it used to be,3.0,,Had not been to Chinatown for some years obviously things must change but it didn't seem as vibrant or lively as before and not so popular we were slightly disappointed
,,"Food, Fun & Cheap Stuff!",5.0,,"If in SGP, this place should be on your list ! China town experience - food court, shop chinese cloth material, deals (authenticity not guranteed) on perfumes etc. Oh ya, there's a McD (or maybe it was KFC) too there for those who may not want to be adventurous with the food !"
,,vibrant environment,4.0,,it is a place to visit every time of the day. but the fun is during the night. friendly people vibrant environment
,,a true Chinese feeling,4.0,,"China town Singapore was formaly established in 1843. in modern time this place is a highly rated tourist destination for low coast meal, authentic Chinese food with a wonderful chinese feelings. vendors are selling souvenier, art, verious chinese medicines, clothes etc at very reasonable price."
,,I enjoyed Chinatown,5.0,,"Full of colors and small shop you can find almost everything . Really clean and with a lot of good restaurant . For sure even a tourist place but I strongly suggest to spend at least half a day in Chinatown visiting pagoda street, the temple, the pagoda ....and surely having a Chinese lunch ."
,,Best place to shop for cheap souvenirs,4.0,,"Not that big area with lots of stuffs. I have bought 42pcs of singapore keychain for 10sgd. Very cheap. There are also magnets, mugs, i love sg shirts, bags, and a lot more."
,,Great Place to go,5.0,,"A great mixture of food and shopping, always try and make time to visit when in Singapore. Lots of little side streets to walk down and explore also. Chinatown looks great at night with all the lights."
,,Typical Chinatown,4.0,,We took the train and walked to Chinatown to enjoy the ever delicous food in Singapore. So many choices!!!
,,OK,3.0,,"Fine for a wander round if you have any time to put in, but to be honest nothing special. Knick-knacks and plenty of restaurants. Very touristy and tacky."
,,Typical Chinatown,3.0,,"If you want to shop, sing, and eat then this is definitely for you.

If you like to go karaoke, they have the really upscale ones like K BOX (approximate $35 above for 2 hours) down to the very affordable ones like Ten Dollar in Smith Street ($11 max for 3 hours).

Are you all about food? When you come out of the Chinatown MRT, a long stretch of restaurants setting up outdoor seats/tables will greet you. Just go there and you'll enjoy a variety of real authentic Chinese food.... and at the end of Smith Street, you'll also find Thai restaurants offering very affordable choices.

Shopping? If you like to shop and bargain for great prices, this is the place to go. You need to brush up on your bargaining skills if you are coming here! :)"
,,"Great visit, have returned twice",5.0,,"We went to Chinatown and experienced such honesty from a shop in there, a purchase was made the first time we went and goods were left behind. It was fantastic to find the goods being held for our return. Thanks."
,,Soak in the chinese festive area,5.0,,An interesting place to visit during Chinese New Year where the streets will be closed and hundreds of stalls popped out selling various wares.
,,a very multicultural area to visit,4.0,,"We visited Chinatown by ourselves and then we took a free walking tour with Wei, ( he is very knowledgable and interesting to be with) Indie Singapore co. we learned a lot and had a better appreciation of the area. the area is a great place to learn about the history of Singapore ."
,,Nice place,4.0,,"We were hoping to have a lock around China town but it was just too hot . It's quite a big place to see .The inside markets are great , but you'll need lots of stamina to get around"
,,"Tourist spot, but fun for a couple of hours",3.0,,"This is definitely a tourist spot, specializing in shopping for souvenirs and food. Prices are inexpensive and it was a fun way to spend a couple of hours. The architecture in the area is very colonial, and I enjoyed seeing it - it's lovely. This is a spot on the hop-on, hop-off tour. I would recommend a stop here."
,,"Being from NY, I find out Chinatown more fun",3.0,,"I have been to Chinatown in Singapore few times and I can't say that I enjoy it, I can say that I find it consistent. the food in some places, is just amazing, but as a whole place, it is just OK. Busy streets, heckling street vendors, plenty of chachkas to look at and potentially buy. Other than that, it is just a busy street"
,,fun place for goodies and foodies!,5.0,,"we always go to chinatown as it is fun place and place where the crabs are ""to die for"", you can get your fingers around them go for it. The folks in chinatown are extremely pleasant. It's just a place to enjoy day or night!"
,,Cheap finds,3.0,,Always great for souvenirs. Prices are lower and more choices. Make sure to look out for what you'd like first and try to get good bargains as some stores have lower prices than the others but make sure to check the quality of the goods first.
,,Silk !,4.0,,"If you are looking for silk items for yourself or family and friends this is the place to go. Make sure you look around for the best deals, don't buy form the first place you see."
,,Shopping for souvenirs,3.0,,"Although we were told about the best shopping deals to be had was in Chinatown, it failed to impress. All shops selling trinkets and souvenirs have similar priced goods and absolutely no haggling about the price. Yes, there’s a wide range of items you can choose to buy from paintings, Tees, ceramic work, wood work, glass, crystal etc."
,,Nice to walk around,4.0,,"Walk around feel like you are some where else , drink a fresh juice and get few things . Not amazing but nice enough to go and just enjoy"
,,Must go,5.0,,"This is a must go for anyone who visits Singapore, it is a rabbit warren of lanes. Better when the weather is dry as it it hard to navigate otherwise"
,,Nice Stroll,4.0,,Nice to just walk through and take in all the sights and sounds. Enjoy watching the street vendors selling the fast food and just looking in the shops
,,Monday = Sunday,5.0,,"As the title says just be aware there are not many shops open in Chinatown on a Sunday, well worth going to the wet markets though if you want to see the hustle and bustle of the area, food outlets are absolutely everywhere with authentic Chinese food (go where the locals go is my top tip)"
,,Immerse yourself!,5.0,,A real Chinatown in a real Far East setting. This is a must when you visit Singapore. You'll need half a day at least.
,,Architectural heritage combined with souvenir shops,4.0,,"Loved the architecture, potter round the back roads to see real gems of colonial buildings and feel the history. Shops typical Chinatown tat I am afraid!"
,,An interesting place to see,4.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is different than the Chinatowns in fx. Bangkok, London ect. I'm a huge fan of the food court that they have. And it is cheap."
,,Easy stroll,3.0,,China town is easily accessible via MRT or by taxi from anywhere in the city. A handful of streets with restaurants and gift shops. Restaurants tends to be small and quite busy. An easy stroll for an hour or so to check out the scene.

,,Great place for markets & food,5.0,,I stayed not far from Chinatown and visited several times - always bustling with lots of eateries & the market - definately worth a visit or two!
,,Really interesting neighbourhood.,5.0,,The markets (food especially) here are a real treat. It also has some good museums to visit to learn more about the area's history.
,,"Experience local Chinese market, street food and life",5.0,,"In contrast to the spectacular modern skyscrapers China Town has old world, local charm and buzzes with life and energy. Shuttered windows sit above an eclectic range of stalls. Local Chinese and tourists mix together browsing the markets and eating in the street from the food stalls. The streets are lined with everything from massage parlours, to Chinese products, restaurants and fruit stalls. Get a taste of authentic Chinese food ordering from the street stalls: try the crumbed prawns with a Tiger beer. Eat at the wooden tables in the street and watch the world go by."
,,Just like most China towns,3.0,,"My husband and I thought we would visit China town. I don't know what I was expecting, but I was disappointed as it was just the same as London China town and Birmingham Chinese quarter. So, if it's on your doorstep whilst visiting Singapore, great, but if you have to do any amount of travelling, I wouldn't bother. Restaurants weren't as cheap as I thought they would be. We paid 34 SD for one course each and a coke. Which was sitting in a street restuarant."
,,Busy China town,5.0,,"Very interesting and busy location, great place to buy a bargain and you must barter for the best price. Good souvenirs and ideal place to that little gift. Can use hop on hop bus to find this location."
,,Very authentic,5.0,,"Very nice are for amazing street food and souvenirs shop. I spent two hours there from 9 till 11pm just enjoying the walk, the street food and souvenirs shopping. I recommend if only you have time. After 11 it starts to close."
,,Chinatown is more than Chinese.,4.0,,"Adapted from a post on my blog “Singapore virtually painted by Tan Choon Hong”.

What is striking about Chinatown is that it is not all Chinese. Here you will find, for instance, Chinese, Malay and Indian places of worship sitting cheek by jowl from each other in blissful harmony, making it possible for tourists to soak up the essence of three cultures in one go.

The current character of Chinatown is partly the result of heeding the call of early conservationists like architects from the early 60s, and the work of United Nations sponsored experts on urban renewal. The messy sights, sounds and smells of old Chinatown are gone, replaced by a somewhat sterile environment packed with swanky shops, homes and offices, and the ubiquitous tourist joints.

Many age-old businesses have been edged out of town due to, understandably, the higher rents for restored premises, but enough remain to make this a vibrant stop for medicinal herbs, dried foods, preserves, antiques and other buys.

Also thriving are restaurants and street food vendors who are holding their own against the influx of upstarts offering ethnic taste sensations from around the world.

Despite its changed character, diehard fans swear by Chinatown when it comes to certain street foods and traditional medicine for authenticity and value.

Attractions not to be missed include:

1. Temple Street packed with tourist souvenir stalls fronting a grand old building with long balconies where residents of yore relaxed watching the world go by, occasionally dropping a basket on a string to fish up some noodle or dim sum from the hawkers plying the street below.

2. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum draws devotees and other crowds to view its Buddha tooth relic and other sacred exhibits on display.

3. Sri Mariamman Temple is one of the oldest and largest Hindu temples in Singapore.

4. China Square Mall, a repurposed property housing swanky shops, fancy eateries and offices.

5. People’s Park Complex and People’s Park Centre for shopping and local street food."
,,Easy,5.0,,"Great spot that gathers everything you need. It has hotels, massages, food, souvenirs, temples etc. It's an easy spot to go and do whatever you want to fulfill your trip."
,,"Culture, food, shopping, atmosphere",5.0,,"If you are spending at least a day within Singapore, then your visit would not be complete without a trip to Chinatown.

This is the original site where the original Chinese migrants worked, lived and is rich cultural history.

From mosques and temples to shops and markets, the area is filled with the old and the new.

Of course, be also prepared for the hustle and bustle of crowds, noisy pedlars, cheap souvenirs and clothes.

If you’re a foodie, there is an abundance of restaurants both along Chinatown’s Food Street and many others surrounding the area.

Even free Wi-Fi is available throughout the Chinatown area, login to Wireless@Chinatown.

While dining, shopping, visiting and exploring, the hours will easily pass."
,,A must visit location in Singapore,5.0,,"Bustling location with lots of opportunities for buying, eating and sightseeing. Food street (Smith Street on the map) is a great, atmospheric place to eat with lots of choice (avoid the indoor restaurants on this street as they cost about 3 times the cost in the stalls). You can eat very safely and cheaply at the stalls in this street. Lots of variety. There are a number of temples also within striking distance of Smith St also. Well worth a visit."
,,Worth stopping by for half a day,4.0,,"I'm glad that we nipped in but wouldn't recommend spending longer than a day. Some great artisans who are worth finding but otherwise most stores stock the same thing, which means that it can be quite repetitive."
,,Great shopping,4.0,,"A great area to visit for bags, clothing and souvenirs. Easy access and good to take a walking tour to learn about the history. Not as good as Ladies Markets or Stanley Markets in Hong Kong - but worth a visit."
,,Value for money at the costliest city,5.0,,It was very nice experience. A stop away from Little India you have China. Totally different culture and ambience. The Mariamman temple reminds you are not in China. You may buy souvenir at affordable prices.
,,It's just another Chinatown......,3.0,,Visited on a tour with my wife and friends. Underwhelming if you've been to any Chinatown area in cities around the world. Same old same old.
,,"Excellent shopping and food, nice atmosphere",5.0,,"Wonderful atmosphere, mostly narrow streets with interesting buildings and lots of great places to eat and shop. You can shop at all kinds of prices here, in air conditioned comfort or open stalls. Great variety and bargains. We picked up some wonderful souvenirs, especially beautiful ceramic ware. Many options for lunch or dinner too.

Very very clean, the cleanest Chinatown I have seen anywhere to be honest. Easily accessible from many MRT stations, and the Chinatown stop takes you to the heart of Singapore.

Its a must visit when in Singapore. Highly recommended !"
,,Must See,5.0,,"Chinatown is amazing, the sights and smells, the wonderful food. Go to Pagoda street for the night markets. A must see place,"
,,Cozy stroll in a cosy area,5.0,,"Since my last trip Chinatown this time had me mesmerised! The cleanliness of the place , the colourful heritage houses and brightly lit lanterns with the numerous shops and eateries is a paradise! Compared to the other Chinatowns in the different continents , this Chinatown is suave and smart. .... And definitely safe!! Bargain hunters that's your place ....lots of souvenirs and imported goods ....from clothing to footwear to calligraphy! A wonderful pedestrianised zone ...that you can sashay down all the way !"
,,Good place for buying souvenir,3.0,,"Chinatown has lot of Chinese shops and is a good place for buying souvenir. I purchased many small items like key ring, wall hangings etc priced at $10 each."
,,interesting and good for bargains,4.0,,"Pagoda Street is Main Street for bargain hunters but check out neighbouring streets too. Haggle and walk if they don't play as the prices are inflated but don't expect authentic products (regardless of boxes or what they tell you). Can get suits etc made in 24hrs of good quality but allow longer if you want a better job done. If after quality tailored clothing, go to Little Arab area or into Chinatown mall where locals shop - cheaper prices, more fabric selection but you need to allow more time (2-3 days)."
,,Great for food and shopping,5.0,,Worth a visit to one of the many restaurants and to partake in some shopping.. also worth visiting the temple as the sights are truly magnificent
,,Easy walk,4.0,,An easy walk from Clarke Quay to Chinatown. Loads of places to eat relatively cheaply. Lots of air conditioned shopping too.
,,Full of character,4.0,,"This place is full of life lots of little shops and stores to visit, We enjoyed it more after dark when the Chinese lanterns that where stretched from building to building across the road were all lit up. Great place to visit."
,,A real taste of the orient,5.0,,A great place to visit especially at Chinese New year when the decorations are up plenty to see lots of shops selling all types of goods there are also tailors there
,,Disappointed unfortunately,3.0,,Wish I could get excited but no. Tacky souvenir shops and little to no history. Nothing to distinguish this from a CT in any other city around the world. Did the suggested walk but found nothing to interest us. Plenty of chinese places to eat for similar prices elsewhere in the city. Learnt more at the national museum than walking around here. Similar buildings abound around Singapore.
,,Lively spot for tourists,4.0,,"An ideal spot to visit, to spend some time. Flanked by restaurants, off street eating and shopping. A very touristy thing to do"
,,Good place,3.0,,Highly popular tourist location. However we were not impressed with this. Like a usual CHINA TOWN. Worth a miss.
,,Thai amulet Sangkachai LP Pae 2540,5.0,,Recently I visit the shop at People Park centre known as Genuine Thai Buddha & Amulet 02-03. The shop owner Max was very friendly and knowledgeable about Thai amulet. I brought a gold Sangkachai from him. I am very pleased with the price and service .
,,Cheap market,5.0,,Plus: - Cheap prices - Good quality of goods - Various items available - Direct entry from MRT Station Minus: - Narrow street and stores
,,Singapore Chinatown Let Down,3.0,,"I was disappointed by Singapore's Chinatown. We went to the ""food street"" and there were just a few places to eat. It was much better going back close to the MRT station to find lots of choices and at very good price. There is a Buddhist temple which is supposed to have a tooth from Buddha. The temple is beautiful, the entrace is free, but I have no idea if you can see the tooth anywhere."
,,Fantastic spot,4.0,,"Fantastic place to visit, great street markets and good variety. Very nice place to visit with kids too!"
,,"Nice place, very authentic",4.0,,"we spent several hours here and really enjoyed the experience, we found quiet a few souvenirs and some nice clothes to buy, we had fresh juice from a street vendor, some of the market stall vendors do tend to be very pushy but overall a great experience"

,,I love Chinatown,5.0,,"Probably the best atmosphere in Singapore.

While I really like all parts of Singapore, Chinatown is probably my favourite place! The streets are full of souvenir shops and on food street you can get some tasty food...especially chilli crab!

It's also home to Hong Kong Soy Chicken which is a Michelin star restaurant where the meals are $2-3...problem is you have to queue for a long long time!"
,,The place to buy your souvenirs,5.0,,"Chinatown is the place to buy your souvenirs! We spent 10 days in Singapore and the souvenirs were by far the cheapest here. There was also a good range of chinese trinkets to buy.
Make sure you visit the budha tooth temple while you are there.
Lots of cheap places to eat as well."
,,"So much food, so little time!",5.0,,"I thoroughly enjoyed Chinatown! The shopping deals, the myriad types of meals, the sea of people- all combines to create the perfect replica of any city in China"

,,Great Shopping,4.0,,"We spent a few hours walking around Chinatown ,shopping for souvenirs.Cheap wallets & watches,we bought a few.My advice take the time to walk all around not just the stalls near the SMRT Station Exit."
,,Always Make It A Visit.,4.0,,On this occasion we walked from the Furama Riverfront Hotel and eventually weaved through the bustling People's Park building across to Pagoda Street. Chinatown has evolved over the years with a greater emphasis towards better tourist opportunities. It is a vibrant area and full of opportunities for eating and trinket shopping. It seems that every trip to brilliant Singapore includes a tour of Chinatown.
,,Colourful and vibrant,5.0,,This is well worth a visit with plenty of things to see and crafty oriental things to buy. The food street Aldo I frees good quality food at reasonable prices.
,,Must visit spot in Singapore,4.0,,"Your visit to Singapore is incomplete if you dont spend at least few hours at Chinatown.
I feel the place is good enough for half a day but if you can't do that, spend few hours at least.

What to look for

If you get tired after shopping, visit the foot reflexology shops for a relaxing massage to wrap up your trip"
,,A Fascinating Glimpse into Chinese Culture,4.0,,"Despite the rain the area was still warm, welcoming and vibrant. A visit is a great way to see an important part of Singapore's heritage and shouldn't be missed."
,,Charming Chinatown.,4.0,,"I have been to quite some Chinatowns. And I think this is one of the more authentic. They actually have Chinese food and some Chinese clothing, lamps etc. A cool area worth visiting."
,,Loved it,4.0,,"Such an awesome China town, best one I've ever been to !! Heaps of shops there if you're wanting to get souvenirs for loved ones . You should also try the Alleviate Fish Spa , they have the fish that eats at the dead skin on your feet . Such a cool experience!!!"
,,Bustling and busy.,5.0,,"Close to the MRT (subway). Wonderful food abounds, and several attractions are in the area. Get some wonderful food at a hawker center and pop into a reflexology center to help your tired feet and body (just be aware that the foot massage is not gentle, but very invigorating). And explore...that's why we travel!!!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Really crowded at times but totally worth it. From the markets to the shopping malls, and People's Park across the street, there really is something for everyone. Yue Hua Emporium is also a must-go destination that not many people will rave about, but it has everything, from kitchenwares and makeup to fine china ornaments and tea sets. Not to mention that Chinatown also has some of the best food selections. Hong Lim, People's Park and Smith Street food centres are some go-to hawker centres for Singaporeans, but there are also plenty of restaurants indoors if bracing the heat is not your thing - Shi Li Fang in Chinatown Complex is an absolute favourite."
,,Nice Place offering Chinese Feel of Singapore,4.0,,"A place for chinese food and shopping wonders. Offer nice bargains on chinese products. Lots of street side shops, food outlets."
,,Go on a food trail to explore the best of local food!,4.0,,"The most interesting and exciting thing for a foreigner to do is to explore the local food scene of Singapore as Singaporeans are such big foodies! Another thing worth mentioning about Singaporeans is that they will queue for good food so if you find a long queue at food outlet, the food is most likely very good!

There are three major food centres in Chinatown and whichever you go to, you won't be disappointed!

Food to try are chicken rice (the rice is heavenly good!), fishball noodles (I've seen amusing reaction to hearing of and eating fishball), crackling skin roast pork and sweet honeyed char siew to name a few! :)"
,,A colourful treat for the eye,5.0,,"There is plenty to browse through and the colours are a real wow factor. Plenty of Tatt! But it is what one would expect, some bargains to be had."
,,A great place to visit.,4.0,,"A great place to visit, meet the local people, try lots of different foods. Lots of different stalls &, shops a different day out."
,,Must Visit!,4.0,,Must visit..both tourist and locals. .still so intriguing and interesting even after many visits to Chinatown.even comparing with other Chinatown s in other countries...except for the heat!..so do go in cooling clothes aad walking slippers or sandals. .wide variety of food avaliable too..traditional Chinese snacks at great prices
,,so beautiful but not big,4.0,,this is the place where we stayed during our stay in Singapore and I must say it is very nice but not as big and as good as we saw in Kuala Lumpur. the malaysian Chinatown was mych bigger and better.
,,Tasty cheap lunch,4.0,,Nice place to stop by for a cheap (Singapore standards) tasty lunch. We had Indian rotis from a street stall. Very good.
,,Great vibe great food,5.0,,Chinatown Singapore is a vast area which is quite a busy pumping place with something always going on. Loved the food but it was so hard to choose. A must see.
,,Loved the Stalls and the Food and ESPECIALLY THE COFFEE,5.0,,"We visited China town several times as it was a favourite to shop and great at night with all the lights...New years Eve we went to dinner at one of the many restaurants which was very affordable and very yummy.
After a particularly hard day sight seeing we really need a decent coffee fix and although not like our flat whites at home, actually nothing at all like them, we stumbled across Nanyang old Coffee shop..... It saved my life and after three little coffees which were a bit sweeter than I am used to I was back.
All in all Chinatown should not be missed great little Museums and temples there as well."
,,Yum Cha with friends,3.0,,"We visited china town to grab som light lanterns which they have a huge selection of and they are very cheap. We also had yum Cha with our local friends. It's very very cheap, traditional and tasty. Don't go to the fancy restaurants here. Eat at a small street stall, with plastic chairs and tables out front and not 4 or 5 star.
Experience their culture. It's great fun."
,,Lots to see,4.0,,If you love Chinese food and everything of China you Should definately visit Chinatown. Also to find are souvenirs for cheap prices.
,,It is more India then China,3.0,,The place is not outhentic it is artificial you don't have to spent time in Singapore to see chainise
,,An interesting place to by chinese things,4.0,,Right out of Chinatownl Station Dt19 on subway NE line is this chinatown. Many small cafe restaurants and many more souvenir or trinket shop for every taste. Surprisingly the chinatown house a large hindu temple. To visit if you don't know what to do.
,,Loved it,5.0,,So much to do in China. I al.ost never left in the two days I spent in Singapore. The food options are vast. Food Street is amazing. So many different smells and flavours. Lots of shopping options in Chinatown and also lots of bars. Highly recommended staying here.
,,Too touristy and junky,1.0,,"too touristy and junky, Not worth your time while visiting Singapore. The shops are tardy and the experience is nothing special. Time is better spent at Gardens by the Bay or the singapore Zoo."
,,surprising Gifts for your dear one,5.0,,"if you are in Singapore do visit China town, its a long street market, you will get beautiful small gifts for your dear ones. Key chain, chinese cups , decoration stuff, stationary, jewelry, magnets, momentous, Feng Sui items all you will get at steal prices. there is also food lane with 100 types of Asian food. good place to hangout."
,,"Chinatown is pretty much a ""Chinatown""",4.0,,"We came to Chinatown to eat Chinese food. They have lots of streets where you could find random trinkets, souvenirs, arts and crafts, electronics, etc. You could bargain with these folks. There is also food stands and drink stands if your hungry.

If you're the type to like to browse around through little markets and eat a bit of street food, I would recommend this place. You can get here by MRT ""Chinatown"" stop."
,,Never skip a Chinatown,4.0,,In every city you have your own China town and I always say go there at any cost ;-) as there is no other place to get cheap stuff and good food! Have a walk around and enjoy a drink and a meal.
,,Must do when in Singapore,4.0,,"Great place to visit. Lovely old buildings and architecture, wonderful atmosphere and friendly people. Great choices of food to eat, and all tasted devine. Shops are assorted and lots of same thing, some places are a little pushy but thats part of the expericence. Went both during the day and at night, was close to Clarke Quay and our hotel."
,,Great place for shopping and people watching,4.0,,"Located just 10 minutes west of Clarke Quay, the area has a large no vehicle zone where there are hundreds of shops, restaurants and thousands of people all mingling around."
,,A must visit,5.0,,"I travel because I like to experience different cultures, flavors, sounds and colors. This is all what Chinatown is about. Simply interesting and a must visit when in Singapore. The food street is exotic and full of excellent but inexpensive dining options."
,,Fabulous!,5.0,,Great souvenir shopping and food! The Chinese Heritage Museum is fantastic. There is so much food available and it is cheap and delicious
,,Must see,5.0,,"Loved Singapore's chinatown. Lots of restaurants, street food and stalls. Bustling atmosphere and a tube station so easily accessible."
,,Lovely day out,4.0,,Loved the little stalls in the market area. Lots of choices for food. Good to have a walk around and experience this side of Singapore!!
,,Cultural heritage centre is a must,5.0,,"Initially disappointed with the cliche market style of Chinatown but happened upon the heritage centre which us a must see. About $15 to get in, the first part required listening to an audio guide while you walked your way through a replica of a business and housing of yesteryear. The next part of building had some really interesting and interactive diaplays."
,,Lots to see and do,4.0,,"An eclectic mix of sites, sounds and smells help to make this Chinatown well worth a visit. Getting there is very easy, the Chinatown MTR is on the doorstep.
There are plenty of street stall vendors and shops offering an array of merchandise and services. I liked the relaxed no hassle vibe.
The sites are cool and interesting, and the food was great. We kept going back and will continue to visit when we are in Singapore."
,,You've gotta do it at least once...,4.0,,"Crap accessibility for wheelchairs etc. (like much of the city fringe). Smith St (food street) is great. Pagoda St/Sago St/the indoor markets have some very cool stuff but be prepared to sift through tons of the same souvenirs at many of the stalls/stores. Bugis is definitely better for clothing, but for little gifts, trinkets and Merlion paraphernalia Chinatown can be a goldmine.

Also do take a walk up Ann Siang Hill at night for some great hidden bars/restaurants."
,,I feel like coming home,5.0,,Atmosphere of Chinatown is so different from other locations in Singapore. Great place for delicious budget food. Easy to go by MRT purple line.
,,Interesting architecture,3.0,,"We visited this place in the evening. There were lots of different goods to buy, but I think we have seen markets like this a hundred times before. We had a nice walk here, but did not buy anything.

Unfortunately we missed most of the interesting building architecture. The area we visited was very dark. But try the areas between Pickering Street/Church Street, Telok Ayer Street/Anson Road, Cantonment Road or New Bridge Road.

Look for more reviews by MulleEllum."
,,Full on place to visit,5.0,,A great place to eat in the evening cheaper than some areas with a great choice. Easy to get to on the Mrt. Can get crowded but great and lively
,,Food lovers paradise,4.0,,"The food is great and cheap too! Chinatown, very easy to find, is all about FOOD with so many options..."
,,Just for 1 night.,3.0,,"A place to be just for one night out.. A lot of restaurants. Dirty streets, too much people. Place not awesome."
,,Heritage,5.0,,Fantastic heritage historical place... photography session with Fantastic views. Varieties of foods n restaurants... great place to chill and relax
,,One of the excellent food streets,5.0,,"From a trishaw ride to having exotic dishes,this is definitely the place you are looking for. Prices could be a bit on the higher side,but the quality and quantity overrides it. 3 categories of meat all together on one plate,6-7 pieces each costs 15 SGD. Too expensive? I think it's fair enough. Loved it. Prefer a cooler day,sunny days you need to spend more to get a cold coffee or water."
,,Must visit,5.0,,This is a must lots to see good place to take the kids. Stalls with all sorts of things so give them a few dollars .I buy lipstick case's for girlfriends so handy.Luggage tags in bright colors great for school bags $2 each.Good food very cheap plus cool drinks .It's cheap and cheerful full of characters with a nice smile happy to make a sale .Oh and wear comfortable shoes .
,,Not much going on...,2.0,,"Having visited a number of 'China Towns' in a few different countries, I have to say this is the worst. The overall offering of goods/services is poor, the people were mostly unfriendly and the area was small which means frankly .. There isn't much to see!!

We did fine here and the food was poor but not going to review that!!

This said, it's always worth popping your head through to experience local cultures in multicultural cities."
,,What you would expect from Chinatown,4.0,,"I went late at around 9pm to Chinatown. The restaurants and food stalls were all still operating and there was plenty of food still available.

There was a buzz in the street and plenty of people wanting to sell their dishes. I was a little put off by the staff calling out at me and didn't feel comfortable to stop and look at the menu details as a result.

However I eventually settled on a quieter restaurant that served me sweet and sour pork which was delicious - different to what a I assume is the westernized version we get in AUSTRALIA.

Chinatown is not to be missed. The atmosphere was exciting and the food choices endless."
,,Visit Chinatown,4.0,,"It nice place to visit. this place popular for Chinese culture, Buddha temple, Chinatown food street. Here you have various type of Chinese food item on food street."
,,Great food at great prices,5.0,,What a great place. The smells are wonderful! we can walk around and see all the fresh food being cooked and so much to choose from. The prices are brilliant too. We visited in the day but im sure it would look lovely in the evening all lite up
,,Vibrant place,5.0,,We visited this place specially the Peoples park complex to find a rare herbal oil for joint pains. Though the complex has mostly travel agents selling attractions ticket at discounted price and some reasonable homestay at upper floors.

,,A great place to explore,5.0,,"China Town is a vibrant, busy place with great shops, market stalls, eating places, both cheap and expensive. It's a place to find souvenirs and unusual gifts to take home for family and friends. The people are friendly and helpful. The Temple at the end of Pagoda Street is amazing together with following the history of the early Chinese settlers, as you meander through the streets."
,,Try Smith St,4.0,,"Interesting shopping area, close to a subway station. Try Smith St food street in the evening, fun and safe dining for the whole family. Love the satay."
,,WOW,5.0,,"Every city has a Chinatown but the one in Singapore is spectacular!
The old buildings are beautifully maintained, the bargains are unique and plentiful and very well priced. There are lovely restaurants everywhere. There is a train stop right in the Center.
The atmosphere is slightly quirky & a lot of fun.
Not to be missed!"
,,Exciting Visit on Chinese New Year!,4.0,,"We visited China Town on the day to Chinese New Year and it was awesome! The streets were full of people and you could buy different sweets in nice packages as they traditionally give to each other (friends, family) as present and they were cheap! At the end of the day you could buy 5 things for the price of 1 and the little stores sold everything directly on the street. I don't know Chinatown by a normal day, but on Chinese New Year you should have seen it."
,,Nice dynamic place,4.0,,"We had our hotel in this place and we enjoyed to visit Chinatown, and to have some Chinese dishes. The people are nice, Chinese and Indiens and we liked this atmospher of little village even beeing so well situated, at 15min walking from Clarke, 20min from Garden by the Bay with direct MRT, etc."
,,great place,5.0,,good affordable lots of stuff... Every dollar spends is worthwhile.. a great place to buy pasalubong... foods taste good.. everything you need to bring home is here

,,Love love love it,5.0,,"Food and culture and massage and shopping and bars and.. did i say food? Its all here in abundance. Spent most of our time in Chinatown and chose a hotel in Chinatown too. Best ever desicion.

For breakfast i recommend Tak Po in Smith Street. Then walk down to corner of Smith and Southbridge for fine Singapore coffee or milk tea.

For a real meat treat try Bee Cheng Hiang in Pagoda Street next to the SMRT.

For an amazing Oz experience visit Dorothys Bar in Temple Street."
,,Nice of souvenir shopping,4.0,,The market next to China Town Metro Station has good collection of different souvenir and the prices are fixed which makes shopping easy. There are also many good Chinese restaurants around.

,,Enjoyable Environment,5.0,,"It is a great area to just wander around, plenty of shopping and great food, found most stall holders to be friendly and good humoured."
,,A glimpse of China - Visit in the evening!,4.0,,A must visit for first time Singapore Visitors or South-east Asia Travellers. The lighting is spectacular especially in Jan-end or Feb start due to Chinese New Year!
,,A muted Chinatown compared to other cities,3.0,,"For cheap goods and food, Chinatown is worth a quick visit. But if you're expecting an expansive and hectic atmosphere of vendors, hawkers, and streetlife, head to NYC, San Fran or Bangkok. Like other places in Singapore, this one is very tightly controlled."
,,Lovely,5.0,,"As part of the old Singapore, it feels like you are in another country, you can find a lot of souvenirs and experience the charming atmosphere, you can negotiate discounts also if you buy more than one item of the same ☺️......."
,,Good time,4.0,,"Wandering around and through the myriad of shops, tastes and smells of Chinatown. Had a meal in the Hawker centre just across from the temple/museum. Eat here to get great feed and cheap. The locals eat here so that's what you do, go up to second floor and see for yourself. Just don't leave it too late in the evening as they might be closing to go home after 7pm."
,,It's China Town!,5.0,,Much like many other China Towns but well worth going if only for the street food. We caught the very end of Chinese New Year celebrations and the disbandment of the Lion Dancers after their prformance. We did catch the public large Line Dancing club though!
,,The Heart of the city,4.0,,"You cannot leave Singapore without visit to this place. A bubbling hub for all things from street food, to tourist junk, from genuine Rolex watches to cheap copies. Go to experience the culture and buzz of what an asian experience is all about."

,,Loved this place - full of life,5.0,,"This place is full of life, colour and character, and because you are in Singapore it is also safe. Hawker restaurants, stalls, bars, people. A must visit if you come to Singapore."
,,Buzzy delight,4.0,,"Plenty of places to eat and shop with every choice of food on offer. Supermarket has everything you may need to buy. Lots of smells and delights . Shops a plenty to buy Nic nacks for taking home , lots of tourist buys on offer ,very cheap. Very easy to get lost as such a huge place with little alleyways, but helpful security to guide you out . Worth a trip"
,,Pagoda street and Smith street,5.0,,Simple. Head for Pagoda street and Smith street. Pagoda street for buying souvenirs and Smith Street for street food. The Hindu temple is also a nice thing to see....take off your shoes and enter. You are bound to get a bargain here.
,,Touristy spot,4.0,,"Souvenir shopping, touristy spot, good food? Go here! views around the area are nice ,accessible, wide selection of goods!"
,,Interesting place to visit,4.0,,"Bustling place to visit, good place to buy Singapore souvenirs etc They say fixed price but we had a wee man try to be our guide - he told us to bargain and the shopkeepers accepted this. Good advice. More expensive than Laos and Cambodia, but not too bad.
We were a bit 'marketed out'. Get out of the main tourist area to eat, as it is more expensive in the shopping area. Pop up and see the Hindu temple. MRT takes you to the heart of Chinatown...easy!"
,,"Take your time, enjoy the walk and get some food!",5.0,,"Chinatown is a great place to wander around, check out the stores, and get a bite to eat. There were some official tourist guides that were out, who helped point us in the right direction. Don't expect superior quality items, head to the shopping malls if you need to, there are plenty in Singapore."
,,Shopping,4.0,,Good place to shop. Found a tintin store. Color ful. You get to see a lot of local culture. There a hindu temple too.
,,Dinner & shopping stroll through Chinatown,5.0,,Great place to visit in early evening. You can take in the shops which sell all sorts of stuff. Then dinner at one of the many food choices. Very pleasant evening activity for the whole family.
,,Poor quality stuff,3.0,,"Chinatown has many shops and food outlets. Recently shopped at Chinatown, but to my utter displeasure, found the quality of some products very poor."
,,Amazing smells,5.0,,"I ventured to China town for the night to try absorb some of the culture and I did exactly that, The market stalls and food stalls everywhere the aromas coming from different places are amazing and the food is spectacular"
,,"Junk, junk and more junk",2.0,,"Worth visiting for a stroll through, however all shops stock pretty much all the same stuff. It is cheap however if you want to take home souvenirs. Better to go in the afternoon when every stall is open. You can sit in the open bar/restaurant and people watch once you get sick of looking at the stalls."
,,Buzzing with Chinese culture,5.0,,This is a large network of roads with many shops and food outlets. Good for present hunting at reasonable prices.
,,Cultural Area,5.0,,Great visit to Chinatown. Some of the old shops that have been restored really interesting. Found a great one that sells all kinds of chop sticks the staff there were very friendly but I can't remember the name.
,,Rich in history but beware of tourist trap,4.0,,"If you are a tourist on your first visit to Singapore please do pay a visit to Chinatown... get yourself a guild,listen and awn on the history, the interesting story, see feel and smell the atmosphere around you, it's a amazing experience... visit the indian temple, sago lane and all the old building.
Downside.. DO NOT buy or have any foods from those shophouses... they are mostly tourist trap and lots of small time huskier.. there's a hawker center below some flat which serve wonderful and affordable local food... eat to your heart content (a few even have Michelle Star but prepare for a long Q)
Visit that place early in the morning or the best time is late afternoon from 4.30pm... remember the sun, heat and the tourist trap are a sure kill-joy, be careful."
,,Best place to find gift n food,4.0,,"If you go to singapore, you must go here..why.. this place offering you everything. Food,gift,cloth about singapore. If you want to find a gift go here..is cheaper and more variants after that if you hungry go try Chinese food here along the street.its like culinary food..many kind of food and taste you can try. I suggest to go here at evening bacause along the street lighting fit the Chinese lantern..so traditional and beautiful. Is near to mrt chinatown. So give your time here."
,,Best shopping for souveniors and dress.,4.0,,"Best shopping for souveniors and dress.Best price, Good food spots with drinks, good for hanging out. nice in evening and night time."
,,Whole new experience.,4.0,,What an exciting vibrant place to visit lots to see and lots of bargains to be had especially if you are looking for soveneiers.Food places were everywhere very hard to choose and really inexpensive to eat .
,,A little on the delapidated side!,3.0,,We have been walking through and shopping in China Town for decades but this time I felt it was a little jaded - not so many bits and pieces to choose from in stalls in comparison with previous experiences.
,,Deja Vu?,3.0,,"We went on a tour which took in Chinatown and Little India.

Chinatown is in an older part of Singapore and contrasts with the rest of this modern city ... the buildings are all much older and usually only one or two floors tall and are usually painted in red and gold colour schemes (Lucky colours in Chinese culture).

Once in Chinatown you instantly notice the smells of traditional cuisine

There are ornate Chinese, Buddhist and Hindu temples but mainly shops and places to eat.

This is where the Deja Vu comes into play ... as you walk around, you get the feeling that you have been past this shop before and have looked at the products and wares before ... but the faces are different.

After doing the customary walk around Chinatown, you realise that the shops indeed are different but the stuff for sale is exactly the same ... they could have saved everybody a whole lot of time by just having one shop.

Likewise with the restaurants but as this is CHINAtown, the cuisine is obviously going to be Chinese.

Now I could use this review to do one on Little India and just swap the words Chinatown and Chinese withe Little India and Indian respectively but that would be cheating.

My tip is don't come here on an organised tour as you will not have enough time to leisurely take in the sights and smells ... take the MRT and take your time."
,,charming real Singapore taste,4.0,,"like other Chinatown around the world, key lifely character, shops and many cultural attractions are aways living tourism resource. Not luxurious place but give you the real oldies taste of the cities!"
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"A colourful and interesting part of town, great for food and for photography and shopping! An enjoyable visit."
,,"Feast for the eyes, treat for stomach and easy on your pockets!!",5.0,,It's a must go place in February during Chinese New year. The place is so vibrant and colourful. The decorations in Chinatown is simply the best. This place boasts of hosting the best eateries in Singapore. Wanna try authentic Chinese food? this is the place.
,,"Colour, colour, colour",5.0,,"You have to see Chinatown to apreciate what ther is on offer. By night it's buzzing, it's great food smeels, the vibrant people. I could go on and on. You'd be bored by it all. VISIT CHINATOWN."

,,Dont miss,5.0,,"Make sure when in Singapore you get down to China Town. You wont be disappointed, shopping, food and drinks. A great place just to sit and people watch with a cold drink."
,,Old and New mixed,5.0,,"Excellent place for cheap food and shopping mixed with old and new culture. China town is a vibrant centre comprising of typical new stall malls and old style street markets. The hertiage centre and Tin Tin museum is easily accessible from the MRT and only a short walk. A wide range of Chinese and Asian food is available either in resturants or from the hawker stalls. My recommendation would be to eat from the hawker stalls as it is cheaper and most food is freshly prepared while you wait. Excellent place for seafood lovers too. Chinatown also offers the best exchange rate for tourist wanting to converts cash to Singapore Dollars. Best tip to ensure the best rate is to make sure that your notes are clean and have not got any markings or writing on them that should not be there. The Money changers are very experienced and can spot forged notes, the 50 Euro note in particular, and will not accept them for anything."
,,MUST DO on any visit to Singapore.,5.0,,"Magical place to wonder around, great restored shop fronts, temples and places to eat. A must do if in Singapore for a visit."

,,Best Chinatown outside of China,5.0,,"I've been to many Chinatowns and this was the most authentic and beautiful. You know you're in a good Chinatown when no one speaks english and they don't call it Chinese food...they just call it food. Best Chinese food I've had outside of China. Look for People's Park for the most authentic food but stay away from Durian, LOL."
,,Fabulous place to spend a day wandering around,5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore was just great. I visited it in the evening and then again in the day time and bought a number of trinkets to take home. Lots of similar shops side by side but it is very colourful and busy. Also, excellent choice of street food being served and I didn't hesitate to try it because everything looks really clean and inviting. Older local residents appear to spend a lot of time relaxing here in the evening and younger people join in with line dancing in the open square. In the heat of the day the nearby Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum offers good respite from the heat and is and interesting place to visit."
,,Great place to wander,4.0,,"I had a lot of fun wandering around Chinatown. There were some great antique shops, super cheap food and Tooth Relic Temple."
,,China town,5.0,,"A real open eyes and wanderful still today
It's still the same where local still come and seat and play games
While the tourists ship til drops
Great food every whee and safe to eat
Cheap by bus and MTR but only 20 Minutes walk to rafle city"
,,Good shopping,4.0,,A great place to visit for shopping of gifts and last minute items needed. It is also on tne MRT line so easy to reach.
,,Mid-Autumn Festival Chinatown - Exciting & Diverse,5.0,,"Mooncakes beckon. Lanterns takes pride of place in displays. Stage rehearsals for public performances of moon myth themed plays.

MiniPiglet-shaped biscuits in cages. Food street and countless eateries.

Tailors, souvenir stalls, fruit sellers, crowds huddled in groups playing chinese chess, hotels, departmentsl stores, fast-food heavies like McDonalds. Caligraphy and Chinese paintings, auspicious paper cut-outs, push cart ice cream vendors, Jamae Mosque, Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum, Sri Mariamman Temple (Singapore's oldest Hindu temple), medicinal halls, family-run goldsmiths, teahouses, bak kwa (meat jerky) stations.

These are found along cramped five-foot ways, dingy alleys, shady backlanes. Raucous street hawkers on narrow streets - out of place among hipstar bars and lifestyle retailers.

There's even a Tin Tin outlet.

And funerary paper offerings that Chinese believers burn for the deceased to ensure them a happy afterlife can be seen in shops in the form of laptops, money, mansions, cars etc

Good Heavens!

Wander and wonder. The Chinatown feel is believable. It is genuine and not a half-conceived and half-hearted execution to plant a chinatown for tourist to gape at.

Singapore's population boast a majority of ethnic Chinese. This is also true of its foreign workers composition. Chinatown is the real deal - not some haphazardly contrived set-up of a tourist trap.

Enjoy the vibes.. spontaneous and infectious. That free Wifi connectivity blankets the entire Chinatown is just coincidental. As is the Lion Dance Performance at Pagoda Street on Saturdays at 6.55pm."
,,It's very cheap!,3.0,,All the stalls sell goods at very low prices and it's a sight to see but don't expect to spend much . We had dinner in the street but it was cold! SMT exit comes out on Main Street.
,,"Head to China town for Good evening stroll, souvenir shopping and end your day with good meal and drink",4.0,,"Good place for your evening in Singapore. It is colorful in the evening, Nice to walk around Pagoda street, temple street and surrounding area. Shop for souvenir for cheap price or best price. You can buy key chain, bag, T with SIngapore logo on at best price. At the end of Pagoda street, one can visit Hindu temple and spend time there.

Lots of street food and one could enjoy sea food , chineese etc,. Strict vegetarian, sorry no chance for you !!!!

Must visit in Singapore.
If you are planning to visit in the morning, please head to china town only after 12 noon. Again i suggest to visit China town in the evening and end your day with street food"
,,A large number of Asian stalls and eateries,3.0,,"Chinatown is a stroll through area and a stop one should make in Singapore as it gives you a flavor of the Asian feel. There are many trinket and specialty shops. (My wife wants to buy some more fancy chopstick sets of which there are maybe 4-5 speciality stores with a large selection and price range). You can also find many tailors who will probably do a decent job making suits and dresses in a matter of days. (Our friends had some items made and altered. They indicated they were not done 100% correctly or done on time.)

There are many vendor stalls to pick up a quick snack. Just realize they are all specialty stalls so you have to go to a different stall to get drinks. FYI bring wipes or napkins as they are not provided in many Singapore dining establishments."
,,Seen one seen all,4.0,,"Chinatown is Chinatown. Obviously, each city has their own charm and uniqueness but if Chinese food is what you want, this is the place to go."
,,shopping gallore,3.0,,I went there for shopping but there was no variety and it was also quiet pricy like other parts of the singapore.
,,Cheap products!,4.0,,"Chinatown is an amazing place, full of people! Everything so cheap! An example are the keychains: in Marina Bay Sands, you pay $7 for 1 single unit. At Chinatown, A SET WITH 6 of the same keychain is $1!!! You can find some hindu temples and go inside if you had never saw it."
,,Singapore flavour,5.0,,Brilliant place to see a piece of singapore. Lots of stalls. Have a haggle. There are some beautiful monuments and temples to visit. Men must wear a sarong to cover bare legs provided and ladies covers shoulders and arms. We really enjoyed this but remember if you are travelling to Australia you must be careful as you have to declare a lot of souvieneers for tax purposes. We did our shopping on way out home
,,It's ok....,3.0,,"China town in Singapore is ok, but not a must see. There are a plethora of stalls and street markets selling all sort of tourist fares, like cheap knock off, trinkets and souvenirs. However there are plenty of decent Chinese restaurants if that is what you seek."
,,Souvenir paradise,5.0,,"Lots of souvenir shops with competitive price. Be more diligent in comparing the price from shop to shop. There is food street and food court that offer a lot of different chinese foods and hawker foods. Be sure to ask the taxi driver to drop you off on Smith street, otherwise the driver will drop you on people's park or different section of chinatown."
,,A little portion of China in Singapore,5.0,,You can see a little city inside Singapore with full of Chinese habits and tradictions; it is like to dive in a different atmosphere for some kilometers.
,,Clean and cheao,5.0,,Get your tiger balm here as well as the clear tiger balm oil. Lots of souvenirs can also be purchased here.
,,Chinatown - A different side of Singapore,4.0,,"We decided to go visit Chinatown again on this trip as its a different side of Singapore without all the glitzy shopping centres and high-rise buildings. The atmosphere there is similar to Hong Kong, where theres a hive of activity surrounding the markets area (just like Lady's Market and Temple St in HK).

It was hot as usual on the day but there were a few bars and fruit juice shops to help cool you down. There also a large harkers above the multistorey under-cover market. They choices there are amazing and you will find many vendor selling the same types of food, so look for the longest line of people. There is a soy-chicken rice stall there which has a massive line - its worth giving them a try.

Things are a little cheaper in Chinatown than on Orchard, so stock up on goodies for the ride back home. Also, watch out which exit you take from the MRT stop. If you dont see a display of lanterns as you exit the MRT stop, you've gone the wrong way. Go back down and look for the other exit."
,,Vibrant and cultural,4.0,,"Loved Chinatown. There is so much to do and so many amazing restaurants! We went there twice. Once during the day, but it was too hot. So we came back the next day in the night after sunset! The buzz at night is amazing! So many people, so much food. The markets had every kind of food and object one can imagine! This is one place you must visit. It easy to get to as well. We caught the train."

,,Culture Galore,4.0,,"Such a small area with so many different characteristics
My first stop was the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, a beautifully done large complex
Next, in close proximity is the Sri Mariamman Temple, a Hindu Temple with a substantial amount of new additions
The Red Dot Design Museum is a little walk from here and worth a visit if you're interested in the design aspect of everyday products, an entry fee of S$ 8 applies....it's also got a charming coffee place with wifi
Club St has lots of upmarket eateries & antique shops whereas the open air food court on the opposite side has a whole lot of mid range food stalls which open around noon"

,,Buzzing with people,5.0,,"We just loved this place. The place is full of shops selling good stuff at extremely cheap prices. We got small gifts for all our son's classmates. Brought bracelets here , which were beautiful. The market is huge and has a lot of shops. You need time to select and shop. Its always buzzing with people. Has a lot of food joints , though vegetarian food choice is extremely limited. A shoppers paradise. Loved the whole experience of it. If u like small souvenirs to gift, and don't mind the rush ..this place is a heaven for u."
,,"Cheap food, nice shopping spot",4.0,,"Walking around Chinatown is nice. Being in Asia for the first, I enjoyed buying tea at one of many tea shops. I found the souvenir shop staff very aggressive, wanting to sell all sort of stuff. If you don't mind that, you might find gifts for your love ones at good price.

Food? Quality ok but very cheap. I enjoyed the place and recommend going to visit for an afternoon."
,,Good food!,4.0,,"Easy to reach by metro! Just go to Chinatown station! Plenty of food shops to chose! Also, the Buddha temple is located there! Nice place ok buy souvenirs if you like!"

Shop where the locals shop
,,The place to go for affordable & authentic cuisine,5.0,,"We went to Chinatown on our first night in Singapore and we were impressed straight away.

Dancing and fantastic smelling food all around. Food is very fresh and delicious, plus the chilli is actually hot!! Lots of beautiful colours and you feel very safe there. The little shopkeepers aren't pushy and you can browse the stalls without being harassed to buy things."
,,Must visit,4.0,,"Singapore's Chinatown is the most similar one in Asia compare to the one in the west. Most chinese immigrates live there (and they speak broken english too since they dont really go out the area) and work there. The area is about 6-8 blocks large, head back to the main road (New bridge road) if you ever got lost. Lots of delicious chinese food as well as other asian cuisine but watch out the price tag if you are on budget trip because some may charge you extra without your realising."
,,Good food and shopping,4.0,,"Visit the wet market and shops here to pick up a bargain or two, and soak in the local flavour and colour."

,,Pricey,3.0,,"Do not eat at the restaurants on Pagoda street unless you want to be ripped off. The trinkets and souvenirs are the same down the street. If you are looking for keychains, fridge magnets and postcards then it is the place to go. At night the place looks pretty so it's worth a visit just to take in the sights."
,,Best Chinatown I Know...,4.0,,"I've spent a lot of time in China and visited various Chinatowns in many countries. This is a chance to balance out my 2 star review of the Chinatown in Sydney. This place is amazing. Big, busy, cheap, and lots of China. Tons of shopping and food. The hawker centre is the best I've seen here. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Genuine Bargains,5.0,,Chinatown is a must see in Singapore. There are plenty of quirky shops as well as the usual touristy ones to buy cheap souvenirs. Food is fantastic with a lot of very cheaply priced options.
,,Full of Chinese culture here!,5.0,,"Chinese town, I spent almost 1 day here. There's a lot of China people. Guys should try out the food court. One big bowl of vegetables and meat. Very special food over there."
,,Must seen in Singapore!,5.0,,"Well, Chinatown speaks for it self. One of primary destination when you're in Singapore. You can stroll along dozens stalls for souvenirs and shops, Buddha's tooth relics temple, and they got market adjacent to the temple. In short , it worth it to visit Chinatown."
,,Chinatown with a difference!,5.0,,"It is true that in nearly every country you can find a Chinatown. Howver, I would like to add that each are slightly different and unique. For Singapore's case, it has a unique mixture of the 4 different national races of chinese, malay, indian and caucasian all mixed in it."
,,Good Cheap Markets,4.0,,The prices were cheap and most of the shops carried the same thing. There are very fow Chinese here there are more Indian shop holders. Easy to pick up souvenirs keep in mind the prices are set but they are cheap so no need to worry. The train line is right in the heart and there are plenty of taxis around as well. There is a street dedicated to food and this is good and cheap. You can pick up copy bags if yo want though keep in mind these are not on display and will be called out by the shop holders. You can spend and hour or two here easily.
,,One of the nicest Chinatown,4.0,,"Lots of things to do, love the shops and restaurants. Don't miss the food courts and of course the Buddha Relic Temple if it's your first time."
,,Vibrant and Busy,5.0,,"A vibrant and very busy original and old part of Singapore, the place just oozes atmosphere and character. You can buy just about anything in the markets and haggle,fascinating to just walk around and explore all the sights and smells. There is a food market on the upper level of the main centre and an active market on the basement selling everything from seafood to groceries."
,,"Wonderful colour, vibrancy and food",5.0,,"No trip to Singapore is complete without an evening stroll through Chinatown. Full of colour and vibrancy, packed full of people and noise, it's a great place to find a table, order some of the great food, have some beers and watch Singapore walk past. The shopping is good, much cheaper than little India and pretty much the same items. Don't expect to eat and drink your fill for $30 per couple, those days are long gone, more like $60-$100 for two. A must see, particularly at night."
,,Chinatown Singapore,3.0,,"We have visited Chinatown many times. It is a typical crowded,hot and bustling place in Singapore. It can be reached by MRT. There are many food stalls with a very good selection of foods to suit all tastes, including deserts.There is also a market area, which sells all manner of souvenirs.Worth a trip there."
,,Quaint houses and lovely area,5.0,,We had booked a hostel in China town and fell in love with the area as soon as we alighted from the metro. Quaint little shops selling curios and momentos line the entire street right upto the Hindu temple at its end. We did maximum shopping from there as well. Didnt find any vegetarian restaurant there but they have two McDonalad's so once can at least grab a McVeggie on the way!
,,Vibrant Chinatown,5.0,,What a place to be in Singapore...Vibrant colourful is this place called Chinatown. Your mood changes for good once you reach this place specially in the evenings. Clarke quay is away just a walking distance

,,Fantastic shopping,5.0,,"We walked to China town from our hotel early in the evening and was amazed at all the stalls and lights that we saw - it was a hub of activity that was fantastic to see. The shopping was fantastic and the ambience was brilliant,. We ended up coming back twice as once was not enough :-)"
,,A Step Back In Time,4.0,,A fascinating area that architecturally hasn't changed in years. It is amazing that it still exists amongst some of the most modern building in Singapore. You can buy just about anything here and it is well worth a visit even if it's just to have a look around.
,,Exciting Place to Visit,5.0,,"We have a large Chinatown in San Francisco, but this one is entirely different. The shops are more like stalls and the food court is immense."
,,COLOURFUL PIECE OF SINGAPORE,4.0,,"You can't miss this bright and noisy place if you are exploring Singapore! it can be truly called a real piece of China with its traditional way of life, food and street sellers. But be aware of a strong smell of the King of Fruits - smelly Durian!"

,,Food and atmosphere was great,5.0,,"We caught the train here every night for dinner. Ate at both restaurants and in the food stall street. We would always order a variety of dishes and share, with every dish we tried being delicious. Some dishes in restaurants were a bit out of our comfort zone, but street stalls were not. Teens were even trying everything and enjoying. Had henna tattoos done here. 3 of us cost $25 altogether. Cheap. This is the place for souvenirs too. T shirts $3."
,,Chinatown,3.0,,"Had a trip to China town, not a lot to see but some great places to eat. We had a delicious meal at fatty wengs."

,,Bit gimmicky,3.0,,It was ok to visit. Overpriced on most things and felt touristy. Some good places to eat. Went at night.
,,Visit the temple of the tooth,3.0,,"Decent sight to visit and walk around, especially at night when the lights go on during festivals. Here the people lack the politeness and warmth of rest of the Singapore however as they don't understand any English. It is not as clean or orderly as the rest of the country but the temple of the tooth is worth a visit"
,,A place to buy anything,5.0,,"This is the place where you can find and buy anything. From food,beverages,clothes,phone accecories,bag,souvenirs. Anything.
There are also lots of hostel and hotel in here.
I,personally always love to come here. I can find lots of cute stuff here (because lots of ""3 for S$10"" or ""4 for S$10"")"
,,Great Place to Visit,5.0,,"Chinatown was easy to find and easy to access via the MRT. Lots of markets, shops and restaurants. Lovely food and friendly people."
,,Mooncake Festival decorations - great both night and day.,5.0,,"My local friend drove me down Newbridge Rd Chinatown last night (Sunday) and was blown away by the decorations and blast of colours for the Mooncake Festival...totally unexpected.

Went back this morning to take photos in Pagoda Street and Newbridge Rd then came back tonight to catch the colours.

These photos capture the contrast...go to Chinatown anytime - there will always be something to surprise."
,,"Great hawker food, rubbish type market goods",5.0,,"Dont be afraid to try the food at the stalls, its cheap and awesome.
Look for the letter ""A"" rating which is the best rating. Lots of eating places. The market goods are a little rubbishy looking, but its still worth a visit for the experience."
,,Really cool,5.0,,The temples and the side streets wow! This is a must visit! So many different shops and restaurants! The temples in this area are really cool and a must see as well!!

,,"Busy, lively area.",5.0,,"Great area to go and eat, people watch and do some souvenir shopping. Its pretty cost effective for food and drink as well. Lots of choice of style of food with Hawkers in cabins and tabkes in the road, or street side restaurants if you need aircon in your life!"
,,A Frenzy of Activity,4.0,,"Chinatown had a lot to see and a lot to buy! There was a museum of Chinese history tucked in near the entrance and an abundance of food places and shops to visit. Some of the sellers are quite crafty and will try to draw you in with conversation, especially if you are from (or appear to be from) North America. My advice is to be friendly but firm if you're not interested. This is a good place to look for souvenirs at a reasonable price if you're not wanting to buy at the big stores. There is also a large temple here that you can look at, and I believe you can enter it. I really enjoyed the lanterns along the streets here."
,,Good streetfood,4.0,,something different every turn - great buzz - but go at night and have something to eat and drink - lots of quirky shops
,,Better than KL for me,5.0,,"Surprisingly, Chinatown in Singapore was more exciting for me than in KL. I thing the main reason for it is the food- it's just everywhere and you have plenty of chances to have a look, buy and taste local specialities. This part of the city is truly entertaining and very clean too."
,,Old World Charm,5.0,,"Its at the centre of what makes up Singapore, Chinatown a mix of old world and modern. Wander through the many narrow streets filled with hawkers, shops, tourists and locals alike. Easy access via the MRT and plenty to see and do here."

,,"China Town Street Food,",3.0,,"Went there late evening for dinner. I like the atmosphere and set up. Tried the wan ton noodles and thought it is pricey, not value for money. Fried oysters was good though. Also tried green tea ice shavings from the popular dessert shop, I wouldn't say it is a must try."
,,Greta place to buy rubber chickens,3.0,,"I always buy a rubber chicken wherever I travel in Asia as a memento of golf trips. Chinatown markets has thousands of them, representing 0.000001 % of all the useless rubbish for sale. Some good restaurants and bars though."

We ate in the middle of the market and it was the best Chinese meal we have eaten. We felt very safe and for a market quite clean. Go early evening then you experience day time and then the evening lights.
,,Fascinating area,4.0,,"Exciting bustling area full of market and street dining shops. Close to services such as supermarket, money changers, MRT rail station and other shopping."
,,Great Bargains,4.0,,Good place to get your souvenir shopping done and some good bargains can be found. Lots of food options as well. There is also a local food market up the road if you want to try more local cuisine. close to train and bus stops.

,,A melting pot experience,4.0,,"This was by far the best 'town' (compared to Arab Street and Indian Street). Streets lined with market stalls, food stalls, restaurants and the famous Food Street. The MRT (train station) is right in the middle so access is easy, the Buddha tooth relic is just on the edge.
Great place to wander, buy souvenirs, even local fruit and food (not sure I will indulge in the live frogs!).
The Chinatown Food Street is an absolute must to go to eat. A whole street full of tables and vendors, edged by little restaurants. Whatever you want to eat is here and very reasonably priced. You get to watch most of it being made which can also be entertaining. Good picture menus too, so helps with selection.
At night the streets have strings of lanterns in all shapes and sizes which makes for an incredible atmosphere. We always felt safe here too - wandering around at night is no problem."
,,This place made me smile,4.0,,"I feel like I'm inside a movie and the scene is in Chinatown. Singaporean store owners would even try to speak in tagalog just to get your attention. I Bought pork floss, pork jerky, and a pair of chopsticks. Fun place."
,,Singapore Odyssey,4.0,,"This should be high on anyones bucket list.interesting architecture,vibrant,great fresh local food and inexpensive with easy train and taxi access."
,,A contrast to the Orchard Road shops,4.0,,"Chinatown is the place to go if you want souvenirs or Oriental furnishings for your house at reasonable prices. I bought two red silk cushion covers, two for $5. You can't do better than that. It is also fun to walk around, have a meal or sit and have a drink and watch the world go by."
,,Interesting walk,5.0,,Some good temples particularly near Raffles Place MRT but also the expansive Buddha tooth relic temple. Good food too and really low cost if you dare to go to a food court rather than a tourist restaurant

,,Chinatown Singapore what a buzz.,5.0,,Immediately on your arrival in Chinatown you feel a sense of calm. The place is colourful and vibrant and certainly an experience to enjoy.
,,"architecture, history, food",4.0,,"Upon exiting from the station, you're met with some Chinese lantern decoration signifying Chinatown; but I find some of the architecture to be quite interesting as well. This is mostly a outdoor walk, but most shops have awnings enough to cover your walk in those random 15 minute rain showers. There's a lot of vendors selling the usual souvenirs like pens, magnets, candy, paper fans but just wander around each block to see a bit of everything. There's a few vendors selling in season fruits, for September that's grapefruit and the end of durian season. But there's always some fruits on sticks or smoothie like blends to be sold. There's restaurants as well so no one will starve. Hawker center that's not obvious, but there's a building in the middle of the area; just ask and people will kindly show you the way. No AC there but the food is worth it.

There's a popular beef jerky place called Lim Chee Yuen for the people from TW/HK, sometimes no line or it can run 15 deep when I visited. They happily offer sample tastings, but if there's a line better decide quickly what you want."
,,Super hot super humid,3.0,,"Visited singapore chinatown with my wife and theres nothing really to see or talk about. There wasnt anything particular memorable except the fact that,

1. It was super hot and hazy and humid (September)

2. There are some souviners shops.

3. Touristy place.

4. Probably wont return"
,,Chinatown Bright and Colourful,4.0,,Visited Chinatown during the day and enjoyed it but returned at night time and wow the colours the food stalls were amazing. So many food stalls to choose from and gift shops everywhere.
,,not like any other Chinatown,5.0,,stayed in Chinatown for the first time. It has changed a lot & is now a modern & clean tourist center with malls like Chinatown Point & walking streets.
,,Cross Southbridge Road,4.0,,"As someone says, culture, food and shops. The eating street has lots of food options, do not be put off by the stalls in the middle of the street, I have found the food there better than in the restaurants that line the street, also prices are reasonable and the selection is great. Lots of tourist shops, have been caught out there before buying a camera lense so if you are looking for something like lenses, do your research first. Temples also exist if you are after culture. Have stayed in the area 3 times in the past six months and have only just crossed Southbridge Road. Was amazed with all of the little resurants, bars, coffee shops, parks and also another temple. Make sure you cross the road while you are in Chinatown, have a look at Club Street and that area, a matter of metres from Chinatown"
,,Nice walk,4.0,,"Busy and bustling part of town with hundreds of good food to select. Always try to haggle first, although some are fix uniform price."
,,Less Chinese than you'd expect,3.0,,"Surprisingly, Chinatown is less Chinese than you'd expect. It doesn't feel anymore Chinese than Chinatown in Sydney or Toronto, which is kind of surprising considering that the majority of Singaporeans are of Chinese heritage. But in a way it also makes sense in that Chinatown is more for visitors and special occasions than for the everyday lives of most Chinese Singaporeans.
There are some good restaurants, temples and museums, plus loads of cheap souvenir shops. Nothing to get too excited about though as you can also find all these things all over Singapore!"
,,Great location to explore Singapore,4.0,,Close to everything and pleasant (although touristic) introduction to Singapore. Worth staying in to then moving around the city exploring more.
,,"Culture, foods and shops",5.0,,Great Chinese food! Cheap souvenirs and a beautiful temple. Chinatown is a must do to feel the spirit of this huge immigrant community! Streets are kindly decorated with Chinese symbols!
,,day trip,5.0,,"This place offers good Chinese cuisines (cheap and expensive), real quality massage parlors/outlets, although a few are sleazy. There is cash converter shop somewhere by the road side. Should be an enjoyable place to spend time, for massage and shopping."
,,Colourful,4.0,,As we came out of the MRT the colours were vibrant. Singapore is quite expensive but here there were loads of bargains.Definitely recommend for gifts
,,Great place and atmosphere,4.0,,"This place has everything, crazy busy with people, food on every corner and you can shop and buy just about anything, totally typical Chinatown!"
,,Autumn Lantern Festival,4.0,,"Wonderful lights in main Chinatown areas. Accessible by MRT trains , buses, taxis. Good walking tour to take in the sights ,sounds and taste the food."
,,Worth a visit if you can find it,3.0,,"Not the biggest, best or most colourful Chinatown in the world but worth a visit if you can find it. Maybe it has shrunk over the years giving way to new malls & Highrise.
We found it differcult to find the shopping area after alighting MTR in Chinatown. Once there don't be shy to haggle over a bargain in the roadside stalls but all fixed price in the shops. A few places handy to eat and have a cold beer while sheltering from the heat or tropical downpours."
,,"Chinatown in Singapore, Enjoyable Place",4.0,,Our Porcelain Hotel was located in Chinatown. We enjoyed our visit to other streets in Chinatown and also found some great souvenirs there too. Many restaurants available also with a wide variety of good food at reasonable prices.
,,Truly ethnic,5.0,,Good place to go during the day or night. They had lanterns and shows when we went there. Just looked very festive and lively. So many options for food that would recommend you to go there empty stomach. Veg options too.
,,"Don't be afraid to delve right in, we found something new every time.",5.0,,"This area is amazing, so much packed into this area, from the China Point Mall (and thankfully familiar McDonalds and KFC, to the supermarket and shops galore... then out to the street where there was a warren of stalls and shops, local foods, everything imaginable. Each time we ventured in we stumbled into another unexplored area. Tons of fun, in comparison, Mustafa had changed so much we were glad we only went out there once. But they do have a grocery store there with every imaginable item. Chinatown was just more fun, we also preferred it to Bugis Street."
,,Amazing atmosphere,5.0,,We visit Chinatown often. For food and also for atmosphere. It really has its own buzz and sense of history. It's also a uniquely Singapore ambiance.
,,Great place for a visit,5.0,,"It is enjoyable to wander through Chinatown, browsing at the stalls and eating at the stalls and restaurants."
,,Great atmosphere and cheap to eat and drink,5.0,,"One of the very few places in Singapore which is original and the buildings so far protected.
Singapores heritage has been flattened and replaced with high rise,modern buildings and impersonal shopping malls -very sad.
Loads of cheap, good places to eat ( Singapore is very expensive) including the Maxwell food hall which is ok for lunch ( pic1) and a beer
The market is vibrant, colourful and interesting selling great gifts and where there are tailors who will make bespoke shirts, suits etc to order - also,more great places to eat and drink
The Heritage centre is another place in Chinatown, within the market,worth a visit
We love Chinatown"
,,Great fun,5.0,,"We loved our visit to Chinatown, in fact we went twice. Each time eating in a fine restaurant with the most helpful of staff. We shopped in the markets, and enjoyed strolling around taking in the atmosphere."
,,Always buzzing - great for a cheap meal too,5.0,,Chinatown is always busy with stall holders and hawker food. We have eaten in the food halls many times and never had a bad meal yet. Most dishes cost $4 and a big bottle of Tiger beer cost $7 (AU). Hianese Chicken is the popular dish for my husband and I had BBQ pork and rice. There is stall holders selling the usual souveniors and knock off brands.
,,Nice place,5.0,,Good to see because many things here a bit expensive. But i bought a gift for lucky here. I like it . Chinatown here a bit look like Chinatown at Hoian Vietnam . But i think chinatown vietnam is nicest. hihihi
,,Lots of things to see,4.0,,"China town has lots & lots of little shops and plenty of street food. We picked up plenty of bargains and excellent tourist souvenirs.
They is nearly always some sort of festival going on, so there was plenty of decorations like lanterns etc hanging everywhere. It adds to the atmosphere.
Defiantly going back next time I'm in Singapore. Loved it!"
,,Great experience,5.0,,"The easiest way to get here is by taxi or MRT. This is a vibrant colourful experience.. There are many shops and stalls with a multitude of souvenir, clothing and just about everything else. Don't forget to bargain and negotiate. In addition to this make sure you go across the walkway to the Peoples Park Plaza. There is a large outside section with all types of Asian food on offer and also 3 floors of shopping. Also nearby is the Buddah Tooth Relic Temple which is amazing. Don't miss it"
,,Ok for an hour,3.0,,Average market shops. Good place to have some clothes made at good prices. They have regular uk customers.
,,Lovely experience,5.0,,"I love Chinatown in Jakarta but the one in Singapore is a lot cleaner, many historical buildings with interesting history. Worth a visit"
,,Lots of things to see,4.0,,"Visited this place every year. It is better to visit during a nice day without any rain disturbing. Today I visited this place during the rain. There were lesser stores. The things are not really that cheap compare with MYR ( Malaysia Ringgit ) included with the exchange rate. Well , I would like to come again."
,,Culture explore,4.0,,"Chinatown is one of the best place for tourists to go. You can try out some very nice local food such like tiantian Chicken rice, laoban Beancurd. You can also do some shopping if you want to get something traditional, try to know some Chinese history in Singapore or just simply a Chinese culture lover. This is the place with variety cultures that always surprising you."
,,Place to wander and spend an hour to souvenir shop,4.0,,"Singapore is very warm and so you can't spend a lot time wandering, but if you try to go when it is cooler in day you can get some cheaper items. Be prepared to haggle a bit, but mostly prices are set."
,,Shopping options galore.,5.0,,"Chinatown is a bustling mass of traders with everything to suit anyone. You are not spoilt for choice when you shop here, but you need to feel your way through the shops so that you don't buy the first thing you come across. I would recommend this experience to anyone travelling to Singapore."
,,Great fun,4.0,,"This is what a Chinatown should be like - bright red colours, food stalls, loads of stalls selling tacky souvenirs and gifts as well as random boutique stores.

There's the adjoining Food Street which is a good spot to get a bite and drink and people watch.

Nearby are the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Sri Mariamman Temple which are worth visiting if you are nearby."
,,Great food,5.0,,Good spots for breakfast if you are like me and do not enjoy american breakfast foods. Dim sum should be an option in the US instead of flapjacks and snausages.
,,The Chinese culture,5.0,,Obviously is a chinese gather place. Is a great history to read up. The real history is buffalo street where the buffalo will pull carts of water around the place. And part of the area lives Cantonese folks. Every chinese New year. This place is alive with markets. Hawkers selling from deco to food. And clothes. Chinatown is a place of rich culture where not only chinese temple. There is even a Indian temple.
,,"Excellent place to visit, especially during festival time",4.0,,"We visited during the Mid Autumn festival - a fantastic array of latterns, hawker stalls and parades. This made our trip there extra special."
,,Great experience!,4.0,,"If you're looking to soak in some local culture, this is definitely one of the places to be! You can start by visiting the beautiful and soothing Buddha Tooth Relic temple and then shop for some souvenirs of your trip at the street market right next door. You can drive some great bargains here. There are a couple of teashops here, if you love your brew. Next, stop at the food street to gorge on delicious local food - the food is freshly cooked, clean and hygenic, and there's a few vegetarian options too. Don't forget to have some local coffee (or Kopi) at the cafe at the entrance to the the food street. They have quite a few options so take your pick. If you're still up for doing some more, the oldest Chinese temple in Singapore, the Thian Hock Keng, is a short walk away."
,,Best time is Chinese New Year but always worth a visit,5.0,,"China Town is amazing, especially in the evening, dont be scared to eat the local food, it can be amazing!!! Shopping is fab through the markets too. Children and adults love it. For me its a must do whilst in Singapore"
,,Colourful Chinatown,4.0,,"We happened to walk around yesterday with our two young boys. We happened to go to the central plaza and it was just so colourful with beautiful painted lanterns hanging around, the many many small stalls selling trinkets were a big attraction for the kids.
We showed the kids stores selling traditional medicines, pork items, restaurants where they could choose their live seafood for dinner. Very interesting.

I am sure if one has more time and visits the many attractions including temple would be great. We did not spend enough time here.

Would want to go see other places in China town. Central plaza feels overrated and too commercial !!"
,,Food night,4.0,,"If you're looking for normal priced food & drinks in Singapore then come here. Excellent value and a great array of foods to choose from, not just Chinese food in Chinatown. It has a nice atmosphere and I would def return here when back in Singapore."
,,Ok but not great,3.0,,"Small old Chinatown was always packed with a lot of people. The town itself was quite ok with many shops sold cheap souvenirs, some nice restaurants serving Thai, Chinese and local cuisine. Some other great temples were all in the town, so easy to visit in a day."
,,Chinatown !,5.0,,A must see and do! Lot's of interesting things to see! Take the subway... Comfortable shoes are a must have!
,,Very interesting history of days gone by.,5.0,,"There are history plaques at the entrances to each of the streets in Chinatown. Must visit Food Street and eat Hianese Chicken from one of the Hawker stalls. Grab a beer and sit, watch the world go by. Also for great cheap food eat in the food hall. I don't know anywhere else where you can get a meal for $3.50. Amazing."
,,Chinese feel,4.0,,"A place full of culture and a place for good food too, a place thats convenient from mrt station. good tourist place"
,,Bargains!,5.0,,Great shopping! Friendly people and heaps of bargains. Watch out for the tailors wanting to make clothes for you - not that cheap. Heaps of souveniers and food outlets
,,Chinatown Singapore - a nice place to browse,4.0,,"We visited Singapore's Chinatown in August 2016. Great place to visit with nice shops, great variety of places to eat, and the general ambiance of Chinatown. By the way, this Chinatown is the cleanest Chinatown I have ever visited!"
,,seems a little like disneyland,3.0,,"my first impression was that it seems bombastic and not very authentic. you can do shopping and you have food street . both temples are worth a visit. there is also a special tin tin shop, but in my opinion it lacks ambiance."
,,Great experience!,5.0,,"We visited and the markets and eat at the hawker stalls. Quite an experience! Lots of shopping, great place for souvenirs. Very lively atmosphere, live music, great place for people watching!"
,,Can just wander around for hours,5.0,,"So interesting and because this is Singapore, the marketplace is clean and orderly and one can peruse items in peace without being accosted by strangers. We also had a traditional Chinese tea service and visited a couple of temples with exquisite figurines and art work. Also very convenient to get here with the MRT."
,,Good to see,4.0,,"This is a must, great food,
Tiger beer and a flee market which is great to experience. It's also clean around the market and the food places. Easy to get to by metro or loads of taxi. You can't barter in the market and they sell a lot of repetitive stuff but it's still great to see"
,,Lots of shopping and eating.,4.0,,"Great place to get a feel for the Chinese culture of the city. Many stalls on the streets selling cheap stuff of questionable quality. Inside shopping malls are better quality, but sometimes pricey. Lots of great eating from street food to fine restaurants."
,,Good place to shopping,3.0,,We went there to purchase some ornaments. How ever Singapore is a very expensive country when compare with other countries. So here you can find most of things in low price. But we went to Buggist street. There we were found most of things cheaper than Chaina Town. So I reccomend to first of to the Bugist and then go to the Chinatown.
,,Not worth wasting a day ober,3.0,,"We visited China Town as part of our honeymoon stay. We were in Singapore for 5 days and heard about how we should visit China town.

I have to say we were very disappointed.

There are so many other beautiful places to visit and worth the day trip and China town is not one.

The food is nothing to rave about and made us anxious even looking at.

The ones worth visiting had queues which were about 40-60mins wait.

Deffo not somewhere to take the kids as the crowds are over whelming and there is nothing for them to do other than browse stalls."
,,Short street,4.0,,"May be one of the smallest Chinatown in the world. But it's packed with food, history and culture.
Take photos of the old shophouses, the shopping carts and food pix too.
Prices are cheap for low grade mass produced souvenirs like fridge magnets and postcards.
Food is expensive but they are all available at one location so you need not travel too far to sample our local crabs and laksa since they are all at the eat street.
Authentic chinese food by folks from China is also available. But remember they call it ""ma-la"" for a good reason. It will leave you numb and spicy."
,,Had some good shopping experience,4.0,,"We had visited this place with our group of Kesari tours from Mumbai. We had some good shopping here. T shirts, Chocolates, Umbrellas one can buy from here."
,,Cool and well laid out,4.0,,"Very tourist orientated chinatown but great to see and laid on well if you have never been to a chinatown before- its not exactly authentic but a great insight and cheap food (cheap for Singapore that is, not for rest of south east asia)"
,,-pandmobeirne,4.0,,Certainly a different experience. Chinatown was clean and we felt very safe and comfortable in the surroundings. Good fun!
,,Hive of activity,5.0,,"Always something going on, from mid morning into the early hours. Fantastic place to see traditional buildings, temples and museums or grab a drink in one of the many bars. Food street is definitely worth a visit but beware the chilli crab can be expensive there. Easy to get lost here too so mind your bearings"
,,Chinese Culture on Display,5.0,,"Singapore's Chinatown is a quarter that includes Pagoda Street, Smith Street, and Sago Street.

It's narrow streets are full of old Chinese houses, Chinese restaurants, bars, and street stalls selling tacky souvenirs.

Smith Street is also known as Chinese Food Street and stalls selling a wide variety of Chinese food are set up right across the road.

The area is home to two prominent temples, the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and a Hindu temple, Sri Mariamman, both of which are worth a visit."
,,Mandatory if you visit Singapore,5.0,,"Place is good and safe, food is good, prices are correct. Is very important to choose the right restaurant before seat, because is really Chinese food, and they have many things that could be strange for non Chinese people."
,,"Tough to review as a whole, but......",4.0,,"It's difficult to sum up Chinatown in a few sentences, as there are so many different parts to it. The temples, shops, markets, food stalls, cafes, restaurants, bars, people, museums......however it has to be seen. We thought it very safe there. We visited the Heritage Centre, a restaurant and a bar, and three temples, all in the space of a few hours. Certainly worth wandering around if you are on the city."
,,Shopping n Food,5.0,,Colourful and full of life ...you can get excellent food joints and if you are looking to buy cheap souvenirs for loads of people ..this is the place.. from light lanterns to Chinese Dresses to watches everything is well within budget.
,,Love it :),5.0,,Another great Chinatown. Someone should write a book about Chinatown's around the world and rank them. This one is very clean and well organized. Love the food :)
,,Good place to visit!,5.0,,Good food hide inside the building. Many intresting stuffs you can buy. If you are intresting in Chinese culture you shouldn't miss. Chinese herbal mediciene is recommend for any type of ache.
,,Great place to eat,4.0,,4 of us were enjoy for dinner here the crab(in chili source ) was so good a lot of souvenirs available in the great price. Enjoy sitting and see people walk around is the main idea
,,Fun to Walk Through and eat at Chinatown,4.0,,"I spent several hours walking through Chinatown and it is a fun place, with lots of vendors (make sure to bargain), excellent food, especially the Chili Crab at Ba Dao Guan with a Tiger beer and located right near a SMRT station."
,,Nick backs,5.0,,"What a place to buy nick nacks. Of course they were full of cheap shops selling keyrings by the 40 and 50 pack and ashtrays of the marina bay sands building, however a great place to pick up some bargains and nick nacks. The best gem is though after paying $20 for a tiger stubbie at the marina bay pool bar... for a little more you can have some chili crabs with a bucket of tiger beers here in chinatown!!! Definately worth checking out, beautifully coloured buildings and trees nice to see!!"
,,Colourful piece of Singapore,4.0,,Come to Chinese town in Singapore to enjoy the multi-couloured lantern at night. You should also try the chinese food and the famous ice-kechang there
,,Good place to see chines culture,4.0,,"Great place to see chines culture in Singapore. You can go for walking and experiencing different culture. Not much time needed, but worth it."
,,Amble along Old Singaporeania,4.0,,"Whilst you head on down to Chinatown in Singapore for the familiar reasons of wanting to experience sights, smells and taste of another world, juxtaposed within an urban settling, just remember, this Chinatown is different from the others you've visited. Here, you'll find a Muslim mosque (Mosque street), an Indian temple (Temple street) huddled alongside each other, cheek-by-jowl with the street carts and pop-up shops that draw you in. The streetscape is interesting, especially as you amble along Smith street with its mix of psuedo antique shops, sundry goods stores and the various eat joints. Be adventurous and try the food items from these road-side stalls, as you then meander along the corridors. The place is alive through the day, but me thinks its best hours are 8.30-10.30 am (do a breakfast walkabout) and 4pm onwards, when blaze from the afternoon sun starts to lose its intensity."
,,China Town,4.0,,China town is a good place to visit.There are so many shops for shopping.There is a separate street where you can find restaurants to eat
,,Chnatown comes alive this August. clelbrating Autumn Festival.,5.0,,"CHINATOWN SINGAPORE.
If you are coming straight to Chinatown from the airport the most convenient way is by a taxi which you will find the stands in an orderly manner. You can also travel easily by the MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) to the end of the line (Tenah Merah Station) where a connection (left platform upon exit) with the East West Line will take you to Bugis (Interchange) station where you have to connect with the Down Town (Blue) Line to end at Chinatown. A short 5 to 8 minutes walk will take you to the new 5 star
Parkroyal On Pickering Hotel at the corner of Pickering Street or the 4 star Furama City Centre which is within an easy walk of Boat Quay and Clarke Quay. For a lower budget you can walk across the street (Upper Cross Street) to Hotel 81 at S$84. There are couple of backpackers’ hostels in Chinatown and one of them is just on the street behind Upper Cross Street. The Backpackers' Inn Chinatown at 30A Mosque Street offers rooms (with shared bathrooms) from S$15.

There are various tour operators in Chinatown and I recommend two of the most popular ones. You can explore Singapore during the vibrant evening hours with a four hour Chinatown tour by trishaw with a guide, visiting a traditional Chinese Medical Hall, travel down stall-lined lanes and walk through the bustling Night Market and cruise down the Singapore River to Marina Bay on a bumboat. A dinner at a local restaurant is included. Or you can choose either a 24-hour or 48-hour hop-on hop-off sightseeing at your own pace on open-top double-decker buses.

Walking Tour Of Chinatown.
One of the fastest ways to acquaint oneself with Chinatown is to go on a walking tour of the shops and stalls on these streets – Mosque Street, Pagoda Street, Trengganu Street, Sago Lane, Smith Street and Temple Street. These busy streets encapsulate all the sights and sounds visitors expect of Chinatown, with hundreds of stalls selling everything from silk robes to lucky cats. There’s also a fantastic range of street food on the malls with fresh dim sum, oyster omelet and crispy duck. If you are more adventurous with food try the second floor Smith Street food court where the locals eat.

I would strongly recommend the walk-about tour of the whole of Chinatown in one or two days. You would have a map (from the airport Tourist Information) and you will find that Chinatown is very easy to navigate. You may start from Kreta Ayer Street and work your way down crisscrossing the streets along the way towards Upper Cross Street and beyond or you could start with Upper Cross Street to the opposite direction.

Next to Kreta Ayer is the big market at Sago Lane that is open during the day, but it looks its most picturesque at dusk, with the lights shining brightly and the sound of stallholders tempting you to check out their wares. Sago Lane had a dark history when it was known as the “death” street. It was where those who come to stay in the dingy houses to wait for death.

Religious Buildings
The other end dings.of Sago Lane at the junction, where there is the big Maxwell road hawker center (reasonable price) on the opposite of the road, lies The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. When entering the gate, you’ll immediately notice the stunning main hall with its high ceiling. The bell tower and solid gold two-metre stupa on the fourth floor which is the place where the sacred relic is kept. However, the main focus for most visitors is the pagoda on the roof that has a large prayer wheel. The temple is built in a style based on the Buddhist mandala.

If you started your walk from Upper Cross Street you will pass by Mosque Street where the Jamae Mosque Chulia is located between Mosque Street and Pagoda Street.
Built around 1830s by Chulia Indians it is one of oldest mosques in Singapore.

Next to Jamae Mosque is the oldest shrine in Singapore – Sri Mariamman Temple is one of the most prominent places of worship for Tamil Hindus in the country.

There is a also Church in Chinatown gazette as a national monument on 23 March 1989. This is the Telok Ayer Chinese Methodist Church in Telok Ayer Street. Completed in 1924 it is considered as one of the oldest Chinese Churches in Singapore.

At the other end of Telok Ayer Street is the Thian Hock Keng, or the Temple of Heavenly Happiness, is the oldest and probably most interesting Chinese temple in Singapore. Built in 1820, this Taoist-Buddhist temple was dedicated to to Ma Zu Po, the Mother of Heavenly Sages and the protector of sailors. It is interesting to note that Thian Hock Keng was build on the shore of the old Singapore in 1820 and the modern buldings of downtown are all sited on reclaimed land.

Departmental Stores And Malls.
If you are into shopping then go no further in Singapore than Chinatown. Rising above the Chinatown MRT, OG is a household brand in Singapore known for its fashion, jewellery, cosmetics, watches and toys. It is modern and distinctly international – with sports brands and a whole host of Korean cosmetics and imported products. Adjacent to it is the refurbished People’s Park Centre frequented for its textiles, travel agents, electrical/electronic goods, street wear, toiletries and luggage, all priced competitively. It’s a little run down, but most suited for bargains.

The Chinese Departmental Store Yue Wa with its impressive Chinese façade built at the turn of the century that was once the legendary city landmark of the Great Southern Hotel (Lam Thian) Yue Wa offers a wide variety of reasonably- priced, authentic Chinese products - from tea, herbs and medicines to silks, cheongsams, handicrafts and antiques. The quality of the goods available at Yue Wa is definitely better than what you will find when browsing the markets, and prices will only be slightly higher. Yue Hwa has seven floors, with zones dedicated to each item.

Chinatown comes alive during the festive months of the Lunar New Year (January/February) where the streets are dressed and lighted up during the nights. Another lively festival is the autumn moon cake festival. This year there is a blind moon cake tasting contest (on September 4th) organized by the merchants and visitors can have free samples of various moon cakes on display. There is a Lion Dance Performance (free of charge) on every Saturday night at Pagoda Street.

Singapore City Gallery
You will discover the physical transformation of Singapore from a fishing village to the metropolitan city we are today through 10 thematic areas and more than 50 audiovisual and interactive exhibits.

Being a Singaporean there are so much more I can tell about Chinatown but I am sorry I have run out of space. Hope the information is well received. By the way there is a speaker’s corner in Singapore, in Chinatown. But there is nothing I can say about it as it is not a “true” speakers corner"
,,Loved the culture,5.0,,"I loved the culture here, the markets are also cheap. The smells of the food is amazing. plenty to choose from"
,,Artificial Construct,2.0,,"As with many Chinatowns around the world, this one in Singapore has been overly ""culturised"" such that it did not give you a sense of authenticity.

Wander more towards the Kreta Ayer area or cross the road to People's Park Centre - the first gave you a better understanding of the gentrification of the area, and the second, the new immigrants.

If you want to have a feel of the more seedy part of Singapore Chinatown, visit Geylang. It has the authentic feel and the under current of this ethnic group un-sanitised is more rewarding. Be careful though. It is called seedy for a reason!"
,,They've Really Cleaned This Place Up!,5.0,,"I visited several years ago and this part of town had, well, let's say ""character"" - and was out of Character with the rest of Singapore. Not a bad thing, per se, and I enjoyed it then.

A large street-food area, though we didn't sample it. At this time of year (Aug/Sep) there are durian sellers as well, though remember it's forbidden to take durian on the Metro.

,,Always a nice visit.,4.0,,"Wether for shopping or eating or just for a stroll, Chinatown is always worth a visit. Plenty to look at, great eating places - streetfood or restaurants. Shop/stall keepers not as agressive as in other similar markets. Good fun!"
,,"Delicious food, clean street market...",5.0,,"comparing to KL China town, I can say that Singapore is much better. Well organized stands, clean food stalls, easily navigated... It really is a pleasure to be there... Buddha Temple is near by as well as Indian Temple... if you are craving for Asian,...More"
,,Interesting,3.0,,Great - different shopping experience much cheaper than Orchard Road with different options. But take tissues as the toilets don't provide toilet paper!
,,Fun half day,5.0,,"This china town is clean!!! They have a china town food hall (outdoors) where they have all the hawker food Singapore is known for. Great place to grab a bit to eat, shop for souvenirs (cheap cheap), or buy some cheap art prints. Mostly tourist...More"
,,"Not just another ""Attraction,"" but a Unique one........",4.0,,There are many good reasons why Chinatown should not be missed. 1. Souvenirs- Great place to get huge choices of souvenirs at really cheap prices at the street markets & adjacent shops. 2. Local Food- Excellent place to try very wide range of authentic local...More
,,Trishaw night tour of Chinatown,5.0,,"Was dubious about an organised tour, but rest assured, it's awesome! The tour itself is informative, the dinner is ok and then plenty of time to wander the night markets. The highlight was the Trishaw ride though. The drivers are sooo much fun - we...More"
,,Not to be Missed,4.0,,"A visit to Singapore would never be complete without a visit to Chinatowm. The guide books will tell you to visit the temple's and the mosques, however there is a lot more to Chinatown. The stalls in Pagoda Street are an ideal venue for the gift shopping. Those with a little more money to spend who have always wanted a hand made shirt should visit Tony's Fashion at the corner of Pagoda and South Bridge Street.
If you cannot find something to satisfy your appetite when exploring Smith Street, head for Chinatown Seafood opposite the Heritage Centre. Great food and great beer and great value."
,,Shopping,4.0,,"Although singapore is an expensive place for shopping but this place is tempting. If you are looking for souvenirs, this place is for you."
,,Always great,4.0,,Chinatown is full of interesting people and great little buys. Great to barter and clean. Love all the restaurants. Loved it so much going again at Christmas. It is so much fun. Take small denominations of notes
,,low cost shopping,4.0,,"If you want to purchase low cost, ethnic souvenirs, this is the place to go. One must bargain though. You can buy umbrellas, wooden fans, clothes, jade articles etc."
,,Love the vintage vibe,4.0,,I love the buildings in Chinatown. I got the vintage vibe from its unique design. Backpackers who want to buy souvenirs will love it too. They are varies souvenirs with cheaper price than other places.
,,It's chep guys,5.0,,"whatever you need, its there guys. its colorful, attractive, cheap and shouldn't miss. great place to buy small stuff."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"I really enjoyed from Chinatown, taste many new flavor & had nice afternoon walking in the street & buying $1-5 products :)"
,,heritage and souvenirs,5.0,,a very well conserved heritage place where spend few hours between temples and markets with many cheap souvenirs
,,Shopping and Eating,3.0,,"If you're in the mood to shop, then this is a good place, but there really isn't that much to see when you're wandering around other than a lot of stalls and shops all selling pretty much the same thing, countless Chinese restaurants and a Chinese hawker center. The big attraction - and it's worth seeing - is the large Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. Chinatown is very, very clean (by far, the cleanest Chinatown I've ever seen and some people would consider it almost sterile). All in all, it's ok and the kids will enjoy it, but after an hour or two, you'll have seen all there is to see."
,,Food Street,3.0,,"Food at Chinatown food street is not cheap, but there may be a little verity. Not much of choices there fore vegetarian though."
,,Nice atmosphere,5.0,,"Cheap and can barter easy with the nice locals. Food was lovely, and the atmosphere was overall relaxing. Nice place to visit for cheap souvenirs."
,,Loved Chinatow,5.0,,We visited everyday during our 4 day trip to Singapore. Our teenagers loved it. We bought lovely gifts from Chinatown.
,,Charming!,5.0,,"We had a great time wandering in and out of shops here. Only wish we'd made it in time for the temple visits. Dinner from the stands in the middle of ""food street"" was delicious and fresh! Highly recommend."
,,Always worth a visit,4.0,,"Most cities have a Chinatown area. Singapore Chinatown is quite a page area with a variety of interesting shops. The market area has much of the same things, but always worth a visit."
,,"must go, get foot massage, cool place, cheap souvienirs to buy1",5.0,,"must go, get foot massage, cool place, cheap souvienirs to buy1 also, great place for photo as well."
,,"A WORLD APART,",5.0,,"You have to go to China town for the food the markets and the atmosphere, it's always buzzing there, sit down have a beer and watch the world go by, every nationality you could think of. Get a bargain from one of the shops. Night time is magic there, go eat and soak up the atmosphere."
,,A place to go to in Singapore,5.0,,So many choices for food trip for a cheap price especially for group meal. This is where you can see also the cheapest souvenirs in Singapore. Excellent architecture of the old houses. There is also a public wifi available.
,,Showing a Spanish the Singapore styled Chinatown,3.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore in my own opinion is not as functional as it was back in 70s. With the changing of time, it no longer serves the local population as much as it did 30-40 years back. In my view, it is not a tourist site except for the wet market and cooked food centre.
While both food stores and souvenir stores are set up to cater mainly for tourist, I would strongly recommend that the Singapore Tourism board be involved to sell more products that are designed by Singaporeans. I am sadden to see many souvenirs that are not representative of Singapore and are definitely designed and made overseas"
,,Everything Was The Same,2.0,,"We were so disappointed with our tour to Chinatown during our three day stay in Singapore. Chinatown is only about 4 streets and all there was to do there was shop or eat. Every booth or vendor stall seemed to have the crap junky crap. Booth after booth, street after street, it was like a giant flea market. And it was hot. Oh my God was it hot. No, there are other nicer places to see and explore in Singapore than Chinatown."
,,Must visit temple,4.0,,"Worth a bit of your time to have a walk overthere and do not forget to visit the really beautiful temple with the Budha.
Along the streets you will see many interesting chinese products and souvenirs, street food places and nice street decorations.
You really feel like being in China."
,,Cool but a little scary.,4.0,,We were staying at the Mirimar hotel which has China town as the closet MRT station so popped up out of the subway right into the middle of a very busy market. Every type of food imaginable including the locally popular but slightly odorous durian fruit. Lots of souvenirs and clothes including a couple of pairs of harem pants that my darling said made all the difference in the 35 degree heat and 100 percent humidity. Had a reflexology session which was life-changing.
,,Could be so much more,3.0,,"The main drag between mosque street and smith street is terrible - I'm not sure when the Singapore Tourism Authority decided cheesy souvenirs and beer were the best ways to draw in the tourists.

The fact that the cheesy souvenir shops are jam packed side to side and take up a significant part of the street means that you cannot really appreciate the architecture of the shophouses that were expensively restored some time back. A real shame.

If you look hard enough, there are still a few authentic shops worth visiting. Tai Tong on Mosque Street is an old fashioned Chinese bakery specialising in moon cakes - lotus seed paste and salted egg yoke baked in a soft brown pastry flavoured and coloured with molasses. August and September is moon cake season in Singapore.

Other places worth checking out:

- the Buddhist temple at Sago Lane
- Sri Mariamman (Hindu) temple between temple and pagoda streets
- Tong Heng pastries on south bridge road (good egg tarts and other traditional Chinese desserts)
- Lim Chee Guan for excellent barbecued pork jerky; queues are snaking during the Chinese New Year
- Chinatown complex - if you want to visit an authentic food court and wet market in Singapore (a wet market is where fresh produce - vests led, fruit, meat and fish) are sold"
,,Must visit place in Singapore,5.0,,"This is one of the must visit place in Singapore. Lot of shops available for shopping and normally fixed rate shops. Do visit Pagoda Street, Smith Street, Temple Street and OG departmental store"
,,Place to buy cheap gifts,5.0,,"Most stalls sell basically the same thing - touristy mementoes of your trip and cheap gifts to take back home. Still, it's a good place to visit and you fell completely safe (I am a woman and I went alone)."
,,go china town,4.0,,There is a free walking tour every Saturday at 9.30 from opposite the tooth relic temple. Very good rain or shine. Takes you around differant areas. It is organised by the China town visitors center.after this you can wander a round the shops and eat in food street.
,,Most impressive Chinatown we have ever visited,5.0,,"This is a Chinatown to beat all Chinatowns. The decor, hustle, and bustle are outstanding. My son had a great time walking around and talking with all the vendors. Everyone is extremely polite and willing to talk to vacationers. Even if you do not buy from them. This takes about 2-3 hours depending on how much you like to shop and also take in the adjacent temples. Recommend good walking shoes, camera, hat, and maybe an umbrella depending on the weather."
,,What You Expect,4.0,,"Within walking distance of downtown core and Marina Bay Sands Hotel, but not a trivial walk. Two stops on MRT with convenient station locations. Chinatown is dense with souvenir shops and restaurants. Fun but some areas are crowded."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"What an experience. How fun! My wife and I have walked through a few Chinatowns, including San Francisco, Vancouver, Beijing, and Shanghai. Singapore's is a treat. Great sights, and really Made In China stuff. Great non-tourist food!"
,,Good experience,5.0,,"We go there every year since 2008, it's a good place to spend a few hours!!
You can find tipical souvenirs, imitations, shoes, watches...
Sometimes it's very crowded, normally at night.
It's better go around 5-6pm , so at 8-9 when it's full you can leave!:)"
,,A fraction of its former glory,3.0,,"I have been coming to Singapore for 20 years and Chinatown has changed significantly in that time. It is more sanitised and formal, built up and modern. That's not what you want in such an historic neighbourhood - bring back the character that the proximity of the financial centre with its eastern yuppies has crowded out."
,,Cheap souvenir,4.0,,"If you need to bring cheap souvenirs, Chinatown is the best way to get it. Don't forget to bring umbrella at afternoon"
,,Nice place to visit,5.0,,"This placr is surroundings with many food vendors and souvenir shops, there are almost everything here, you can find bags, shoes, foods, accessories, chinese lantern , even a comb lol, nice place to take a walk"
,,Veerrrrrrry enjoyable,5.0,,"The quintessential China town of every major city has a flavor all of its own. Singapore is no different. With deals available on everything from trinkets to fashion...This is definitely a melting pot of this city.
The unique Tintin Store was a pleasant surprise here - unlike anything I've seen before!!!"
,,A million and one shops and restaurants,4.0,,"Nice bit of nightlife - endless souvenir shops and plenty of places to eat, all with traditional lanterns decorating the place."
,,Food!,5.0,,"There is a lot of food!Bak Kwa,Satay,Fishball Noodles,and all manner of foods!Although,it can get stuffy sometimes."
,,chinatown breakfast,5.0,,we arrived early at Chinatown in singapore just like our very own in ongpin street.they smell the same n food smells everywhere.lots of bargain souvenir from China of course.there are cheap n high-end buys too.we skip the food n have breakfast at McDonald's.lunch is at Bugis junction
,,Beautiful and busy,4.0,,"I loved all the bourgainvilleas growing across the pedestrial bridge, the busy markets and the cheap food. I had a friend as a local guide and we ate some chineese food, tried the durian ""pancakes"" and had a good look around. It was great, although so hot!"
,,Visiting Chinatown,5.0,,"Your visit wouldn't be complete without a visit to vibrant Chinatown. Great shopping g especially if you're looking fine souvenirs. Fantastic, authentic Dining choices especially for lunch."
,,Modern Chinatown Depicts History of Early Immmigrants,4.0,,"Singapore Chinatown may not be the best in the world, but is a safe and clean place to be in. It is not about one long street like other Chinatowns in the World. it consists a cluster of streets, each filled with its own characteristics, immersed in Chinese traditions. The renovated buildings with its old architecture gives you a glimpse of the days of the early immigrants and their struggle for survival. Chinatown is unique because it depicts a multi-religious Singapore even in the early days. A visit to nearby South Bridge Road shows Hindu temple, Mosque and Buddhist temple, helps you to understand how the various races live together in harmony and peace. The recent rennovated Buddhist Red Temple houses the Tooth Relic is worth a visit.
A self walking tour will take about 2 hours with your window shopping not including your meals. It is safe to be in Chinatown and it is good that you wander around and sometimes get lost. But the help is always available to you, free when asking for directions. People here speaks English, Mandarin and some Chinese dialects.Touting is not allowed, and you can verify your bargaining skills in some shops. Enrich yr experience and memories to taste some of the local food stalls along the streets or those housed in food court. Each hawker stall is graded by the local authority for food process hygiene and cleanliness with ""A"" grading being the best.
Many travellers make Chinatown their base of stay during their visit. There are many budget hotels and not forgetting 4 stars stay around the corner. Also food is always available with a reasonable price. A simple meal may costs about S$5.50 with a drink at the local food court. And travel is make easy with local buses, and Chinatown MRT station bringing you to tourists' attractions like Marina Gardens, Orchard Road, Sentosa, Casinos, Botanical Garden, and almost the whole of Singapore.
If you are feeling unwell there is a popular family medicine clinic in Chinatown Point which charges same price as the local about S$28 for consultation not including medicine.
You may find yourself in a busy, big wet market in Chinatown Complex Basement, Smith Street. Take a walk in the morning and you will find big head fish, vegetables and herbal plants, flowers, fruits, and spices. A favourite haunt for the locals."
,,China Town,4.0,,"Lively Chinatown, with lots of Singapore souvenir stalls and hawker market for food. Buddhist temple also worth visiting, lovely spiritual experience"
,,Culture overload,5.0,,Been here twice now and still love it. You need to in the day time and in the evening. Totally different. We had dinner here one evening it was fabulous
,,Buzzing place,4.0,,This place is buzzing with energy. The streets in this area were decorated as if for a festive season. We started with some shopping (Not sure about the quality of the items but they were cheap) and then we went to the food street with loads of options for food lovers.
,,Great blend of old and new,4.0,,I visited Singapore on business for a week and opted for a hotel in China Town. Not the luxury option I normally go for as I wanted to experience China Town on my doorstep. Food was incredible! The hoka centres are a must. Cheap and certainly cheerful. A good mix of shopping malls provide variety for those inclined. Perfectly safe area throughout all areas as is Singapore in general. Worth a visit.
,,Fun Visit on a Short Trip,4.0,,"This is a delightful area of Singapore where one can roam and enjoy the culture of the area. It is small, but there is much to see. There are stalls where merchants “hawk” their wares. The discerning shopper will find some items of value, but most of what is for sale is strictly the touristy souvenir that will be put in a drawer, never to be found for many months or years. There are also food stalls where one can partake of local cuisine at a reduced price. The most interesting part to me were the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum and the Thian Hock Keng Temple. Both highlight the Chinese culture and are filled with relics and symbols of this culture."
,,Worth a trip,4.0,,Nice experience - lots of shops. A lot of the street shops are very repetitive. Some of the food stops appear to be a bit of tourist trap. Definitely check out the Maxwell Gawker centre. Watch for the booths with the long lines.
,,Shopping,4.0,,"Recently visited Singapore with my husband and had fun in Chinatown . We were so surprised how clean it was and not pushy.. We found lots of great souvenirs for our kids . Bag tags and passport covers, toys .. Hair clips etc Not great quality but fun cheap stuff.. Was surprised they didn't negotiate more like other markets we have visited around Asia.. Most had set prices!! Must visit.."
,,Ok,3.0,,Was looking for a little more but great for cheap shirt and gift to take home was nice to be away from the main shopping centres. Plenty of cheap restaurants to eat at before you shop.
,,A Bit Touristy,4.0,,"I visited Singapore on a business trip in June 2016. My wife, son and daughter joined me. It is interesting but a bit on the touristy side. There are a few worthwhile places to visit such as the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and the Chinatown Heritage Center which I reviewed separately. It is very crowded so you should be careful here and also time your visit so you are not here during the heat of the day."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"We love China towns, but this one was ""dead""--not much happening. We were there in late morning for a late breakfast and hoped to explore ""Chinatown"". All we saw were a very few people and lots of concrete."
,,Underwhelming,3.0,,"Was expecting so much but we left underwhelmed, we went through Chinatown on a nightly tour. I was expecting to buy lots but found it all so overpriced, there is a cheap shop that sells the same items in the shopping centre VivoCity for half the price. The only highlight was the Trishaw ride, very touristy but our kids loved it, and I love temples especially buddhist so the Buddha Tooth replica temple is worthwhile if you like that."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,On the MRT line so easy to get to. Plenty restaurants and street food stalls to eat at. Some shops and market type stalls too but quite a lot of souvenir stuff for sale that is not necessarily Chinese! Worth a visit but there are better Chinese restaurants to eat at around town!
,,Good food and shopping,3.0,,"The Chinatown in Singapore is a very typical Chinatown, with lots of shopping markets and food markets. As a result there is a large selection to choose from.

Chinatown is very authentic in Singapore. The buildings stand out from the towering business buildings of the city. Parts of it are a bit grimy, but in general it is fine. I would say it is worth seeing and staying a while in Chinatown."
,,Chinese lanes,3.0,,"This quarter of Singapore is something of a tourist trap. A large collection of retail outlets, with many selling identical products and eateries with same same menus."
,,A good place for collect souvenirs in a cheaper price,5.0,,"This place for souvenir collectors. Hundreds of shops here selling thousands of chinees souvenir, cloths, toys in very cheap rate. A must go place for tourists."
,,Visit with family,3.0,,There are more food stops than shops. Prices are generally more expensive. If you wish to buy stuff then head to Bugis. There is much more variety and prices are much better.
,,A must!,5.0,,"I visited ChinaTown in KL and Bangkok, and this one was the best! Be sure to visit this place, it has a metro station right beneath it! You have lots of options to show and to eat (all price ranges)!"
,,Very busy quarter,5.0,,Chinatown is a very busy quarter as everywhere in chinatown in the world. It's interesting to visit the booths.
,,"Supercrowded in Weekend, But Supercheap souvenirs",4.0,,"We visited this place in two days : Friday and Saturday, and I can assure you that weekend is the worst.
Hence, we enjoyed the view of a truly chinatown with all of its incense and huge options of food.

Moslems better find some place to eat since Halal restaurant is almost impossible to find.

Don't forget to Visit Chulia Mosque and Budha tooth relic museum nearby."
,,Cute place with a big market,4.0,,Chinatown was one of the two ethnic places we wanted to visit. It's cute and well presented. Most of the part we saw were the big market where you can buy the typical Chinese stuff. The temple was great and with a lot of details. The free WiFi was not working well in the area.
,,Augustus in Singapore,5.0,,"Great place to spend a few hours just walking around and soaking up the atmosphere. Very crowded with a pram but is still doable. Items are what they are and price is negotiable within reason, this is no Bali or Asia shopping. Tiger beer is only 6.90 for big bottle. And Wayan goes to the food street Smith st. For Happy hour a tour guide with lots of knowledge."
,,best shopping place,5.0,,"Shopping freaks can have best at this place, extremely clean market, and fixed prices, and prices are most reasonable here as comapred to expensive singapore. as good as geylang, there are 3 lanes back to back for shoping"
,,Nothing special,2.0,,"Chinatown doesnt change much over the years. However, it is just as ""dirty"" n uncomfy around certain areas. Over recent years, there are increasing number of foreigners hanging out there, making it more uncomfy to shop/ eat there. Overall, i will not make a purpose trip there unnecessarily, unless to get/ eat smthg specific."
,,Always interesting,5.0,,"Whenever visiting Singapore Chinatown is a must visit.At night it comes alive with traders bartering for custom.Food stalls magnificent and great bargains to be had,"
,,Culture,5.0,,"You must experience the tasty food, desserts, and drinks that make Chinatown so amazing. The history here helps you understand how Singapore has grown to become such a great city. The music, art and food help you come to love the culture and respect the place the Chinese have in our world. Shops are representative of the beliefs in the culture. When there you must try some stone soup. It is made of sea bass. The Hawkers there have a large varity to chose from. Look and select what you like, the choices are endless."
,,wish I had found it sooner,5.0,,"Came here on our last day, and I am thinking about all the sates, rotis chili crab and so on that I could also have devoured,as well as what I did!"
,,Great view into Asia,5.0,,"Great experience, great food, fascinating afternoon/evening out, also a great eating out, variety of ""street""food fabulous time for my grandchildren."
,,"I stay right on the edge of Chinatown proper, and it's a wonderful location.",4.0,,"I make frequent trips to Singapore from Hong Kong; I stay at a hotel which is just on the edge of Chinatown. There's so much to see, do, and eat in Chinatown. This historic buildings have integrated the new construction beautifully. A wonderful place to spend an evening."
,,Great place to visit!,5.0,,"A real Chinatown in every sense. Fabulous places to eat, score souvenirs and check out antiques. The wet market os a gem, with very exotic raw and even live foods such as toads. The hawkers are great, with even a Michelin star stall. Try to go beyond the tourist streets and you'll be rewarded with authentic Chinese-Singaporean shops."
,,Yucun Kitchen Restaurant - 30 Smith St. FIND IT!,5.0,,"Unfortunately this restaurant wasn't set up in here, so I have had to review it in this section instead.
My wife and I are seasoned travellers, and unashamed addicts of duck pancakes. We have eaten them in virtually every restaurant we have been in where they are on the menu. Across Australia, and many places around the world.
These are the best we have had.
We had something else too that was excellent, but I have already forgotten what it was.
The chef brings out the whole duck and slices it in front of the diners. He is a craftsman, making sure every beautifully rendered slice has it's own crispy skin attached.
Just go there!"
,,So cool!,5.0,,We were in Singapore for a week and kept going back to Chinatown! We were lucky enough the one day to have our local friend take us to old Chinatown where there are amazing restaurants and old architecture. Definitely go to Chinatown!!!
,,Pretty Touristy unless you know where to go,3.0,,"Yes, take in the main street with all the tourist shops but do explore the Buddist Tooth Relic temple and the traditional market with the food center across the plaza from the temple. That's were you will see what the locals experience. Try to get to the market early to see the fish, meat, fruit and vegetable vendors. Reminded me of markets across asia when I was younger. A more authentic experience for those willing to try."
,,"Ideal tourist destination, colourful and busy",4.0,,"Modern Chinatown type experience to suit tourist visitors, good food available at reasonable prices and plenty of trinket and souvenir shops, this area was vastly difference in the 1960s when few tourists would have ventured here."
,,China Town,5.0,,"How can you go to Singapore and not go to China Town? Not possible. Have fun, enjoy the banter, get yourself some lime juice, $1 a cup. Go to the D'Art Station. No 20 Sago Street. Its a tea pot shop. I don't even drink tea but I go there every trip and buy one of their little teapots. Have a look, Im sure you will be impressed. When you have had enough of shopping,or just need a rest, head to food street. Number 16 stall called Chinatown AH Hock Mini Wok has great food. Lemon Chicken, Black Pepper Beef, Great meals at around $9. We had maybe 5 meals there. Every one was fantastic!"
,,Loved It,4.0,,"I'm from San Francisco where's there's a great ChinaTown. This one is bigger and more vibrant and the eateries are much, much more proficient. It's full of good bars, clubs, and hotels; the MRT and the hop-on/off busses go through. It's just a fun place to explore particularly the markets. Of all things, I bought some silver coins there where you can find nearly anything."
,,Loved the street market and the Chinese Heritage Center,5.0,,"A visit to Chinatown Singapore is not complete without a visit to the Heritage Center on Pagoda Street. See review on the center elsewhere.

Chinatown on a Sunday was quite busy and we enjoyed viewing the tack in the market and the Buddhist Temple at the corner of Pagoda Street. Very relaxed with no pestering although I did note a sign warning of pickpockets.

There is a taxi rank at the end of Pagoda on South Bridge Road.

Well worth a look when in Singapore."
,,Massage center,5.0,,Actually went to the mall to have a good massage.It was very good and you get value for your money.Highly recommended.
,,An ok place,3.0,,Chinatown in Singapore was not as I expected. It is a small place. Few roads and restaurants. Ok for one visit if you want to eat Chinese food or buy cheap stuff
,,Superb place with awesome food,5.0,,Beautiful place with so many options for shopping and food. The local food is awesome and worth trying
,,Colourful and vibrant,5.0,,A fascinating soy to spend an hour or two eating delicious street food and shopping at the many stalls and shops. Easy access by public transport.
,,Loved it,5.0,,Great atmosphere great friendly people cheaper to buy souvenirs and great eating restaurant several Chinese temples in walking distance
,,A typical Chinatown visit,4.0,,We wanted to stop by Chinatown and get a perspective of how it compares to San Francisco's Chinatown. It has a similar feel although feels smaller in terms of places to go and areas to explore. The Budda Tooth Relic Temple is in the heart and a good quick stop for the history. When the hawker booths are open I'm sure it's interesting for foodies (which my kids are not). Lots of souvenir stands everywhere and restaurants. We are glad we stopped but not a highlight.
,,Always a bit of fun!,4.0,,"This place is always a fun place to spend a bit of time and some money on touristy things! The stalls are fun and filled with trinkets that always make a good gift!

The food here is always good, and the closest, and i guess safest, you'll get to the 'stereotypical' street vendor food.

If you can find Nice-Cream! definitely worth getting a cup or a cone!! YUM"
,,A look at old Singapore,4.0,,China town makes a great contrast to the modern designer shops of Orchard Road. There's a good choice of products with shop keepers willing to bargain over price. There's not too much pressure on and the market has a good feel to it. There's plenty of food stalls as well.
,,Lots of electronics,3.0,,"We went here to check out the shops. They have a good range of high street shops, thought the prices were expensive then the UK.
Lots of alleyways with tourist stuff and electronics, again, I personally didn't think it was really cheap, but still great to have a look at the gadgets etc.
Beware of all the beauticians etc offering all types of products and services, even laser, and offer it to very young children!"
,,Markets and food,5.0,,Great place to visit. Even if not buying much or eating it's probably still interesting enough just to wonder through. We found the markets quite cheap and enjoyed some chilli crab for dinner at one of the restaurants.
,,Chinatown is the same as every other Chinatown in the world,3.0,,Popped here as it was on our list of things to do. Once here we realised that Chinatown is pretty generic wherever you go in the world. Full of touristy tat and smelly streets. Not a good mix when it's so hot.
,,For a nice stroll,4.0,,Excellent place for a nice afternoon stroll. You can see many shops selling trinkets and souvenirs of all kinds.
,,Typical Chinatown of a country,4.0,,"Everywhere you go, when you hear a chinatown place of that particular country, it has always been the same without failed, that it has either the elements of Chinese architecture for the building or the culture and habits of that particular group.

Head up to the hawker for authentic Chinese food, at the corner facing the side road, there r 4 stalls that are selling crafts beers from all over the world, cheap and original."
,,Geography & History lessons come alive!,4.0,,Singapore's Chinatown has evolved dramatically over the last two centuries. The larger zone has skyscrapers and offices to meet the demand of land-scare city development. The old zone is gazetted for heritage preservation. There are many hidden gems that even the locals are unaware of. Take your time and enjoy the sights & sounds.
,,Food delights and cheap shopping,5.0,,Not to be missed. Plenty of cheap food choices to delight anyone who enjoys Asian food. The shops have plenty of junk and treasures if you look hard enough.
,,Great for shopping and history,5.0,,We love the Chinatown. It is full of history. It is great for shopping at the stalls and shops. Food is great and lots of variety.
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,"Look for pagoda street exit from MRT. Once you are out of MRT, there are lot shops selling artefacts, clothes(cheap island wide). There is also a food street here where you can lot of options of food."
,,It's Chinatown!,4.0,,"I buzzed through this area because we also have a Chinatown in LA. It seemed to have similar vendors and products that I've seen at home, so I didn't buy anything here. I did love the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple here though. That was one of my favorite things that I saw in Singapore."
,,Spoiled for choice!,5.0,,"After hearing so many things we had to visit and weren't disappointed, if you're a foodie or a market rambler this place is for you!!"
,,China spirit,5.0,,"If you love chinese way of live, you will find it there. Many stalls where you can buy all and nothing for few dollars. Food street and temples in this area. Visit chinatown worth it."
,,Best ChinaTown concept in the world,5.0,,"Though I haven't been to China but of all the places in Asia that have boasted a China market, I feel Singapore's is the best. The variety of stalls, souvenirs, food options are amazing and it can easily rob off a couple of hours from your schedule just to check out on each shop without even trying to buy them. Whatever you buy here, be assured it will be the cheapest deal in Singapore. Though I have never tried haggling with the shopkeepers as I always purchased below 10 SGD but those who charge you anything more than that, you may try to work out a bargain by asking for discount through volume purchase."
,,Same stalls and shops,3.0,,"If you go down one ""mall"" then you have seen everything. All the shops sell the same stuff.
The food is amazing.
There are temples there that are pretty cool to visit and get a different idea of different cultures.
Worth a look but not top priority."
,,cheap shoppers paradise,4.0,,u shall get most of the stuff for 1-10 SGD do not expect quality but still if you try you can get food deals
,,Nice neighbourhood :),4.0,,"I loked the buildings like little houses very colorfull. It's quite different from the regular Singapore architecture. Nice to walk around, get some suvenirs, food and drink ;) Quite reasonable prices as for Singapore ;)"
,,Family holiday,4.0,,"China Town what more can i say its busy with loads of tourists.

The stalls are well planned out and the locals dont hound you to buy anything which is great we spent and £180 dollars there which was not to bad.

I would recomend the local street food that was yummy."
,,Great for shopping and history,5.0,,We love the Chinatown. It is full of history. It is great for shopping at the stalls and shops. Food is great and lots of variety.
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,"Look for pagoda street exit from MRT. Once you are out of MRT, there are lot shops selling artefacts, clothes(cheap island wide). There is also a food street here where you can lot of options of food."
,,It's Chinatown!,4.0,,"I buzzed through this area because we also have a Chinatown in LA. It seemed to have similar vendors and products that I've seen at home, so I didn't buy anything here. I did love the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple here though. That was one of my favorite things that I saw in Singapore."
,,Spoiled for choice!,5.0,,"After hearing so many things we had to visit and weren't disappointed, if you're a foodie or a market rambler this place is for you!!"
,,China spirit,5.0,,"If you love chinese way of live, you will find it there. Many stalls where you can buy all and nothing for few dollars. Food street and temples in this area. Visit chinatown worth it."
,,Best ChinaTown concept in the world,5.0,,"Though I haven't been to China but of all the places in Asia that have boasted a China market, I feel Singapore's is the best. The variety of stalls, souvenirs, food options are amazing and it can easily rob off a couple of hours from your schedule just to check out on each shop without even trying to buy them. Whatever you buy here, be assured it will be the cheapest deal in Singapore. Though I have never tried haggling with the shopkeepers as I always purchased below 10 SGD but those who charge you anything more than that, you may try to work out a bargain by asking for discount through volume purchase."

,,Great Shopping,5.0,,Chinatown is a little dark and dingy at night but I highly recommend the night markets as they are great shopping.
,,Too touristy and expensive,2.0,,Although Chinatown has so much rich history sadly has become nothing but a crowded tourist market selling goods and souvenirs at high prices. Some stores actually have some good merchandise but the majority of them are just common souvenirs. Vendors are pushy and in your face at times. Probably good for tourists but avoid if you live in Singapore
,,Unique Atmosphere in Singapore,5.0,,"Chinatown is a sharp contrast to the futuristic ultra-modern downtown. It gives you a sense of heritage and culture.

There are so many restaurants and shops, and the whole town is always full of people, tourists and locals alike. It is a good place to find inexpensive souvenirs though some very cheap things are just CHEAP in quality.

If you want to eat well on a budget, there are two big food (hawker) centres: Maxwell Food Centre and Chinatown Complex Food Centre.

We once visited there in January, and found some big tents containing a lot of temporary stalls selling goods for the New Year. It was quite interesting."
,,Experience local culture,4.0,,"This was where the Chinese population stayed decades ago when they came to Singapore from China, where many of them used to work at the wharves. Today, most shops sell souvenirs or restaurants selling authentic cuisine from China.The most authentic local flavor of Chinatown and be found at the Chinatown market where there is also a large food centre on the 2nd level. You can see many elderly folks sitting around chatting. People's Park complex also offers a look at the authentic Singapore lifestyle. Also a place for cheap and affordable souvenirs to bring home."
,,Must Visit!!!,5.0,,If in Singapore it is a must visit place..Great food n shopping too..The high for us was the original Tintin merchandise shop wing rest buys n displays..The first Indian temple is also close by..There is a heritage museum too..Enjoi Chinatown as it was n is..
,,Must visit!,4.0,,"Chinatown is a must visit. Especially if you are a foodie or if you like very cultural things. It's a great place to get cheap yet souvenirs and trinkets for your workplace or schoolmates.

Overhead they have red lanterns and pagodas here and there. If it's quiet, it's a great scenic place to get a picture taken.

Try the BBQ pork slices. Sweet and yummy! I prefer the Bee Chiang Heng better than Fragrance but hey, to each his on.

Best to go in the evening.
Also good to note that during Chinese New Year, a huge Street market opens up. Best place to buy and sample some delicious local favourites during the celebratory period. It get crazy crowded so during that time, not wise to bring young children, prams or wheelchairs. It's a push and pull crowd."
,,The place with lots of interesting things,4.0,,"A Chinatown where early immigrants landed from China. Today, you see lots of old heritage buildings and all kinds of arts & crafts, including bargaining shops for souvenirs to bring home. You could chill out there in the evening after your long walk around all the various streets.
Visit Smith street market and roadside stalls for their local food, which are one of the best and good for your appetite, including buying clothes, souvenirs, and household items as well at all the street shops and market stalls."
,,Time capsule of heritage!,4.0,,China town is a living and breathing heritage capsule in the heart of Singapore - much better preserved than similar quarters in the region however not afraid to keep the streets alive rather than a museum. There are lots of tourist shops and eateries in this area including the temple to the Budhas tooth. Chinatown MRT will drop you right in the heart of the area.
,,Enjoy the Hawker Center in Chinatown,5.0,,"I would suggest you avoid Chinatown on the weekends. During the week there are no crowds.
A great place to buy chopsticks, key chains, fans etc.
Arrive around lunch an enjoy the Hawker Center; over 100 vendors of amazing food stalls.
Try Laksa soup for $3.00"
,,Food. Glorious. Food.,4.0,,The shopping here is not great...so don't expect to buy anything of high quality here. Come for the food - which still appears authentic. There is a Michelin-award winning stall (one of only 2 non-restaurants to hold awards in Singapore) located on the 2nd floor near 335 Smith Street. The queues are crazy though - so only really worth doing if you have time.
,,Worth a visit for culture immersion and understanding,4.0,,"I love all Chinatowns anywhere in the world. Singapore's is equally interesting. There are two temples within Chinatown which makes it even more worth visiting. will visit again, if given the opp."
,,many of The Buildings Have Changed - The Mojo is Still Here!,4.0,,"We have always enjoyed Chinatown in Singapore; you simply never know just what is around the corner or what is going to be offered for sale!
This trip we noticed that the Chinese Alternative Medicine is just as strong as ever and were surprised at the amount of Clinics and Herbal outlets in the district.
While the ""Big Pharmacies"" have definitely done their best to destroy every bastion of alternative medicine in the West - it was great to see that Singapore's Chinese community has managed to fend the Chemical establishment off and keep them at bay!
We also enjoyed seeing the second hand Rolex watch shops and Gold traders that inhabit this area; almost as if time has stopped still to take a welcome breath.
A wonderful area that you could spend days exploring!"
,,Good Chinese taste and feel,4.0,,"Okay, you may wonder if you have ended up in an open air museum but hey that is Singapore! Let's say that they succeeded in restoring and conserving a great piece of legacy of Singapore. It also serves as a nice introduction of Chinese culture and cuisine in Singapore."
,,A lot of PRCS. Really feel like in China.,1.0,,A lot of foreign workers from China like to go there. A lot of Chinese type of food. Therefore food safety is a concern. Feel like the food is the for a long time. Not sure whether it is fresh or not.
,,Authentic district,4.0,,"If you have a couple of hours - visit Chinatown. Sometimes it smells, but in common the district is very authentic. As a part of Chinatown life - visit market on lowest floor of trade center near Buddha tooth temple, you wan't regret. On third floor there is Chinese food court, it really smells, but if you are strong enough - go and watch.

After you can reach downtown in a few minutes."
,,Lots of cheap stuff to look at plus some interesting spots,4.0,,We walked here from our hotel and while we were pleased to spend some time here but there is a lot of stuff that is the same is several shops. I wanted to get a sun hat and found one I liked in one of the many row of stalls and shops. It took awhile as wanted one I could fold and pack. Did find some good cheap bits and pieces to take home for gifts but there was a lot of things I was pleased to leave behind. Food street had lots of yummy choices to our lunch. The shop keepers do encourage you to come into their shop but do not hassle you too much. Be prepared to walk so comfy shoes a must as the place has a lot of rows of stalls and shop.
,,Wonderful Place,5.0,,"Is a very lively street, if you like authentic Cantonese food, you will love this place. Lot of food Joints and small Souvenir shops."
,,Great for knick knacks,5.0,,"Spent a few hours happily looking at all the stalls that offer cheap souvenirs from Singapore, artwork, clothing, knick knacks, etc. After the shopping we stopped at one of the many eateries which had lovely food on offer and the beer was cold and a lot cheaper than bars and restaurants in the city!! Definately worth a visit when visiting this lovely country."
,,Ate some strange things,4.0,,"This is a great opportunity to try real (non-westernised) chinese cooking. Delicious food, eat from the food stalls, look for the most popular and eat there. Food was incredible"
,,Wonderful,4.0,,"If you go to Singapore, you must drop into Chinatown. It is a blend of old and new, where you can haggle for a true bargain."

,,Cleanest Chinatown I’ve been to,5.0,,"My wife and I visit a Chinatown when we are in a country that is if they have one and Singapore certainly has one. Chinatown in Singapore is rivaled only by San Francisco in culture but even is superior to it in cleanliness. As always, we bought all of our souvenirs here as it is usually cheaper than anywhere else in the city. The quality may suffer but I don’t need valuable souvenirs but rather mementos of my visit. We did sample foods and it was rather clean and was actually pretty authentic. If you want to experience somewhat Chinese culture and you’re in Singapore, visit Chinatown. Believe me when I say it’s nicer here than actually in China."
,,"Busy people, busy street",3.0,,"Place crowded with rushing people, eateries and etc. Mostly selling Chinese stuff thats why it was called Chinatown. Walk in-between small lanes and you might find something nice. There was a overhead walkway crossing the busy road and can find PRC women preying their ancient trade at old man there. Lots of air-con shopping area for ppl to escape from the outdoor heat."
,,"Chinatown, A Good Place To Find Some Souvenir and Good Food",4.0,,"Chinatown Singapore is a nice place for foreign tourists to know and experience a bit about the Chinese culture as well as enjoying the good foods there. Shopping is another big attractions for both locals and foreigners. Though it is a modern type of Chinatown and it is not big but one can easily feel the atmosphere and experience a bit of its culture. For myself, it is the variety of foods that attracted me there.

There is one hawker stall that is selling chicken rice and Hongkong noodles located in the hawker centre Chinatown recently won the 2016 Michelin award for good food in Singapore."
,,Get your Souvenirs Here,4.0,,"Pedestrianized area of shops and restaurants selling all the usual Chinese tat. But this is definitely the place to go for all the typical tourist souvenirs such as post cards, magnets, shot glasses, cheesy Merlion statues etc. Just to give an example, the same size Merlion that was S$12.00 at the airport was S$3.00 here. Enough said!"
,,Chinatown,4.0,,A busy area with a great variety of food available to purchase. Other retail shops are there to see including jewellers and some clothing shops. Found a great fruit shop selling some exotic fruits.
,,Tiring,4.0,,Lots of the same things here and the same price so just buy where you feel comfortable to be very busy place worth going to.
,,"Very authentic feel, lot of choice",4.0,,"Loved the agrees decorated in colours and flags and has a very old school Chinatown feel. There is a MRT station to the centre of this area and lots of stores to browse for anything you could need. Very popular are the bbq meat shops where many people buy the packaged meat (like jerky) to take home.

There are lots of traditional Chinese shops as well as the hawker style stores. Don't forget to stop by Chinatown complex to see the wet market, dry goods level and the food court where the 1-star Michelin hawker stall Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken is located."
,,Eat some food,4.0,,China town is fun for a look. Mostly just souvenir shopping. Worthwhile for a few cheap presents to take home. Try some inexpensive local cuisine.
,,always some good finds!,5.0,,"i have been coming here for years and buying some great souvenirs, inexpensive and yet fun. Every year I find new items that they have created for sale. In the earlier years I had picked up some excellent watches as gifts. The key chains are useless, they break very fast. so skip those. Hand bags with singapore logo are good. and last long. Lots of visitors, lots of stuff to see. Nice for a stroll on a sunday evening. check everything carefully before you buy."
,,Huge area covered and very interesting shops,5.0,,Chinatown is one place you must visit. It houses lots of good quality restaurants and shops where you can get cheap souvenirs. The streets also have a different characters than other Chinatown that I have visited in other cities. Get off at Chinatown station and head towards Chinatown place and you are right there. There is a huge food court there which you can get good cheap food and drinks.
,,Fun place!,4.0,,"A great place day and night. Felt safe to wander, eat at street stalls,haggle with stall owners. Night time tour great fun bit rushed but tri-shaw ride fun if hair-raising, bum boat night ride anazing. Lesson...no durian fruit in taxi, bus or hotel!"
,,Cool place!,5.0,,Loved Chinatown! So many things to buy and see! It's always a way to learn a little bit more about other people's culture. Very nice!
,,Loved it,5.0,,Chinatown is about the only area that hasn't changed in the 48 years since I lived in Singapore and I just loved it. Great for souvenirs but also for expensive bespoke tailoring. Fabulous authentic street food cooked in front of you and hygiene has improved over the years.
,,For the experience rather than shopping,3.0,,"Very interesting experience coming from a smaller town. Lots of rubbish goods being sold and some hard sells from owners of food stalls and suit makers to get you to spend money. Lots of food choices. Be prepared for interesting smells, especially from the durian seller (ignore the smell and give it a go, you may like it). Check out the temples as well."
,,Lots of times over 25 years - Always visit when in Singas,4.0,,"Lovely atomosphere, plenty of small stalls to shop eateries and some Chinese massages at reasonable prices."
,,"Woohoo, what an experience",5.0,,"Very happy to go here, you could spend hours looking at shops, trying food and drinks. We only managed to walk down the main strip, we found lots of trinkets and cheap places to buy souvenirs."

,,Heritage Protected Taste of Old Singapore,5.0,,"Chinatown is a lovely part of 'old Singapore' though it is now fully surrounded by the looming towers of the new world of commerce and high rise living. Despite this, it has still managed to retain its charm with the delightfully coloured cap (Chop) shops and their shuttered windows, crowded alleyways with cluttered shops and noisy food venues and their wonderful smells. The fruit and vegetable markets remain a central hub with produce foreign to Aussie tourists but central to this Asian culture and it's amazingly delicious cuisine. There a re shops for everything - cooking and kitchen ware, clothing and souvenirs, coloured silk pyjamas and traditional Chinese garb, herbalists with their magic concoctions, barbers with flashing scissors and of course the cap men who will make you your own stamp (or cap/chop) carved into bone with its accompanying wax stick for putting your seal on written documents. There is so much to see that it's worth a day visit and a separate night visit when it comes alive with with bright lanterns and happy chatter in the cool of the evening. Go by train as the SMRT arrives directly below the main street at Chi at own Station for perfect convenience."
,,Many street shops,5.0,,"This is he place to buy souvenirs and others to take home. One of the best Chinatown neighborhoods in the world. Beautiful, clean and very organized. Tooth Buddha is also in this neighborhood. Can walk up and down the streets in a couple of hours. Food also available everywhere. Recommended!"
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"Oh Pagoda Street! Right outside the train station,this street,most famous in Chinatown,has no cars allowed.Full of shops and restaurants! These shops have the best and cheapest souvenir in the city! Make sure you do all the souvenir shopping here,instead of the big malls and the airport.The same thing is sold for half the price! Save money and try the local Chinese here.Even the Buddha temple nearby is beautiful."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"This is a must do! Good shops, great food and beautiful temple. I really enjoyed the culture. There's a little bit for everyone."

,,Ya,4.0,,"If i say ti orchard road ""i don't belong here..."" So the opposite goes to chinatown hehe So much cheap souvenir and cute stuff"
,,Different from other Chinatowns,5.0,,"I really liked this Chinatown. I've been to Chinatowns all over the US, and I like this one because the architecture was really pretty. Also, look out for a Durian store that sells Durian cake, Durian coffee, Durian chocolates, etc."
,,Bursting colors!,5.0,,"When we visited in February, it was Chinese new year and the shops in Chinatown were full and vibrant! There were so many people also. I visited last year, on October and it wasn't like that. Hotels are a bit pricier than usual at this time, but if you are looking to be welcomed with a festive vibe, then this is the time to go. Beautiful Chinese and Hindu pagodas line the main street too, and many wonderful places to eat."
,,Tin tin shop,4.0,,"If you are a souvenir humter. Just try to Chinatown. You can go there by MRT, stop at chinatown look for exit A. You will find many unusual souvenir. There is a Tin Tin shop among the crowd. Also you can see some heritage houses."

,,A must to do in Singapore,4.0,,"A trip round china town is a must, try some of the food it's great. Good place for a cheap lunch. Lots of little shops too."
,,Singapore's Chinatown,3.0,,"If you put on good walking shoes, wear light weather-appropriate clothing, (a hat/cap/umbrella - just in case).Chinatown can spring you some nice surprises. There are temples, old-time medicine halls, artistic statues, works of art, quirky little hotels that have been revived, shops that sell paper money and goodies that are burnt for the dead so they have a great afterlife where they will lack nothing, and of course the Chinatown Food Street where you will truly understand why Singaporeans really love their food!

Walking tours (some paid and some are free) are also available for those who like some structure to their visit (a little bit of smart 'googling"" will get you the information). And of course, how could you leave Chinatown without some lovely souvenirs?"
,,One must visit it,4.0,,"I doubted I could change my mind about Chinatown in Singapore (based on previous experiences in other Chinatown places in other countries), but I changed it. It's a very nice place to visit and have meals (true!!!). The place is well organized and people are very polite and kind. Close your eyes to the cleanness, but try the food available in the place. You'll be surprised with the flavors and tastes."
,,Cheap with variety,4.0,,"Did a tour on a T rickshaw to China town with a fabulous meal and then got to do some shopping. There was a vast amount of everything. After our shopping we went on a Bum boat, would do it again. It was informitive and a great way to see the sights"
,,Good food and experiences,4.0,,"We were in chinatown as part of a food tour. Is a great part of the city, great food experiences at the hawker centres and plenty of cultural attractions to see. Definitely a part of the city you should explore when in Singapore"
,,Lovely place to browse & eat!,5.0,,"After numerous visits to Singapore, this is the first time I had the opportunity to walk the streets of Chinatown. Found it to be attractive, vibrant and interesting. The stalls were lovely and the souvenirs you can get are incredible let alone the food. It was a food extravaganza...try out all the stalls and small restaurants around there."
,,The Red Lantern Area,4.0,,"Good place to take back home some souvenirs... Beware of pick pocketeers though! Must try ""Rainbow Bread Icecream"" for 1.2SGD.. Also must watch "" Lion Dance"" happens at 7 pm in the Pagoda street on saturdays.. Try the food street if you a die hard food fanatic.... Go to hindu temple nearby.. Lots of temple in and around this place..

Overall a good place to shop last minute and That too CHEAP..."
,,Good for souvenirs.,3.0,,"A good experience, lots to see although you soon learn that many of the stalls sell the same things. Great Tintin shop. We bought some gear from the photography shop and was told that it was a bargin and below cost! We found out at the airport that we could have got it there for the same price. But fun all the same. Lots of signs saying to hang on to your bags but we didn't have an issue with this."
,,A place to enjoy,4.0,,"Chinatown is just a marvelous place where you combine historical buildings, culture and good food. In general the restaurants in this area are quite expensive though there are many great budget options. A great place to visit close to marina bay"
,,Fun and interesting,5.0,,"If you enjoy shopping there are lots of bargains to be had. Great for spending a few hours although very crowded, watch out as lots of cheap copies of designer names. Easy to get to and worth a visit if you have time."
,,Must visit and try the food,5.0,,Must visit and try the food. The porridge restaurants during the night are the best. Pork and raw fish!
,,Last minute shopping,4.0,,Not a bad stop off for that last minute shop before you head home. Food is cheaper than other areas and a pretty good range. We had a hard time finding any public toilets so look before you need to go. You know what I mean. Have fun and haggle.
,,Lovely place,5.0,,Do not underestimate Chinatown it is huge it is a very big place to walk around! There are plenty of places to eat and lots of shops I mean tons of different little stores to buy souvenirs from China and from elsewhere. I would recommend going to different shops and see what prices there are cuz you can get a keychain that is the same and one store that's more money than another store so I always compare prices because sometimes it is cheaper at a different place. Nearby Chinatown there's a famous Buddha Relic Temple which is a must-see as well.
,,Great place to visit.,5.0,,"You can find almost anything in Chinatown. From shops selling you the most diverse merchandise to food places, and temples of significance all within the same area. The metro has one stop right there in the middle of Chinatown providing easy access to and from anywhere in Singapore. The place is clean and well organized. A pleasure to stroll bargain hunting."
,,Cheap shopping,4.0,,Well worth a visit for a bit of bargain hunting and souvenir buying. Lots of small shops selling typical souvenirs and t-shirts etc.
,,"""So much to see""",4.0,,"Hubby and I walked for miles in and around the many, many street stalls and eateries too. We found a few bargain nicknacks to take home, even though we weren't going to buy any."
,,Nice market but small,3.0,,The kids loved it. Here they could afford to buy things. The rest of Singapore was very expensive. The only thing is that Chinatown is very small.
,,You pay for the view at the all River view Restaurant,5.0,,Unless you're happy to pay Sydney restaurant prices for food that is lovely but totally over priced. I would go one street back enjoy a traditional dinning experience.
,,Have you visited the one star Michelin hawker food store in Chinatown?,5.0,,"Recently Michelin awarded one star to ""Hongkong sauce chicken rice &noodles"" located at lot no.02 -125 in the Chinatown food complex ,building 335 Smith street.This is the first time hawker food stores have been awarded Michilin stars in Singapore.If visitors to Chinatown wish to add a one star hawker food experience to their credit it is worth a visit.If you are not prepared to wait looking at the long,Long queue is itself a unique experience.A plate of noodle/rice is extremely affordable at S$ 2.50.!"
,,Bustling stalls of food and tourist gifts,4.0,,Visited yesterday. It's quite a busy area with people jostling for the food stalls. Really feels like you are in Asia (proper) as opposed to Singapore. Shopping is mainly tourist gifts and clothes. Didn't really buy anything as we have done this stuff before. An interesting experience and a must if you want to escape to another side of Singapore.
,,Buzzing place!,5.0,,"I like China Town in Singapore. Always something interesting to see in the huge complex, good bargains and quite authentic streat with a roof. Visit the temple and all the food stalls. Remeber to look up - some of the house facades are beautiful. It's great to stay in one og the China Town hotels if you value being in the middle of everything."
,,Shoppers Paradise!,4.0,,It's a shoppers paradise for souvenir and knick knack shopping. Easy accessibility by metro. There are so many shops on either side of the road with plenty of things to buy for a dollar or two. They maybe a chance of bargaining on other stuff. All shops start closing by 9.30 so go with time in hand.
,,Loved exploring Chinatown,4.0,,"Not too different to a lot of other Chinatown set ups in large cities, but worth the visit to the Singapore City Gallery."
,,A buzzing shopping experience,5.0,,"This was walking distance from our hotel and I was impressed with the markets. There is a laneway of food outlets which offer every imaginable cuisine one could wish for. At night it is very busy and sometimes the queues for food are long, but worth it. The markets offer a huge range of inexpensive clothing,gifts etc."
,,China town,3.0,,"Worth going around. U get assorted fruits at nominal rates . However, not in my list of must see places"
,,Waaaaay better than Petaling St. (Chinatown in Malaysia),4.0,,"The street is directly above the MRT station - huge plus for convenience. The entire area is roofed, well shielded from the elements so anyone may visit during hot or raining day. Like other parts of Singapore, the streets are kept really clean. Prices at souvenir store are considerably fair, and there are a few interesting stores around. Drinks and slushie stores could be found on the street, very well manage and kept clean. The desserts are considered quite cheap (currency rate aside) and of good quality. Another huge thumbs up for the city council in SG!"
,,great place,5.0,,"great place to visit, lots to see, buy and do, we spent the day here, my six year old grandson was mesmerised by all the toys to buy, plenty of places to eat and get can get off the train right in the middle,"
,,too kitschy,2.0,,Plenty of small shops with a lot of plastic junk which can be bought on any marked in the world. It is a shame because behind all this hides some nice piece of historical architecture.
,,Little left,2.0,,This is unfortunately all that is left of the much bigger original China town in Singapore. Now it is limited to a small commercial area and mainly a tourist trap.
,,Chinatown is fun and so much to see!,5.0,,Chinatown is great! Good food and the seafood restaurant and great deals on souvenirs all throughout! People watching is the best too! It is a great sample of the Asian culture - and its great because most vendors speak English so shopping is not a problem! Markets are great to visit and buy from... the bars are fun as well. It is definitely a place to visit!
,,After A Meal or Souvenirs - Visit Chinatown,4.0,,"We enjoyed a good couple of hours in Chinatown with souvenir shopping and sitting down for a meal with a selection of foods from the stalls. The shops sell the standard Chinatown style wares that you see in most Chinatowns in capital cities. So, if that is what you are after, definitely pay a visit. If 'been there and done that' leave it off your itinerary and visit the many other worthwhile places in Singapore. However, if you are brave and prepared to eat from the street stalls, you will enjoy a good meal. While I was a bit worried looking at some of the foods displayed in non refrigerated shelves, a local bought us a selection of foods and they were fantastic. We didn't questions as to which stalls they were from, we just ate and enjoyed the experience. So be brave and enjoy the cultural experience."
,,Good place for visit,5.0,,"Good place to eat and shopping, must visit Smith Street for food the best selection for food choices and the street market with reasonable price"
,,Know your prices,4.0,,"I bought DSLR camera lens here and it was no cheaper than back in AUS, although I was led to believe that it was. Know your prices before you shop for expensive items in Singapore as I found that we could get most things back home for the same price if not cheaper!!"
,,China town a must see stop in Singapore,5.0,,Love love love China town. It's so vibrant and happy. Great place for a bite to eat and a beer. We went 3 times in our 2 day stay - I highly recommend this place.
,,Budget shopping!,5.0,,"- lotssss of souvenir to buy and it's cheaper than anywhere else in Singapore
- from 1 dollar key chain to 36 key chains fro 10 dollars (price depends on good style and quality)
- Singapore T-Shirt, many shop sell 4 t-shirts for 10 but I've found one shop near MRT entrance, they sell 5 for 10 dollars
- Singapore pens come in pack with 2 dollars for 3-4 packs for 10
- really enjoyed it but the weather was a bit hot
- go around sunset, the weather may cool down"
,,Clean stalls and friendly people,4.0,,"Great little place to visit for some affordable/cheap items. If your hunting a bargain and want to barter you can do so. Cotton dresses, shorts, pashminas,jewellery and tailors galore. Plenty of eateries to visit as well"
,,Could not get a cheap meal here any more.,3.0,,"Was a little disappointed with China town , food was quite expensive and the markets were pleasant but the shops seem to have same sort of stuff for sale.. No real bargains here."
,,My Review,5.0,,"China Town is a good place for shopping. We can find many cheap goods like watch, scarf, clothes, bag and so on. And also, we can visit the Buddha and Hindu Temple."
,,Cute small lanes,4.0,,Super crowded. All shops almost sell the same stuff. We took a hop off hop on tour and got down here. I did not really shop much here. You can skip it also!
,,Nice atmosphere,3.0,,We had lunch here and travelled by trishaw to get there which was a bit hair raising in the traffic. We made the mistake of going inside one if the many restaurants as it was quite hot to sit outside. Very expensive and not great quality of food. I would Definitely go at night time if I was to visit again and eat at one of the many outside stalls which were much cheaper and the food looked more tastier.
,,Not an impressive Chinatown,2.0,,"Nothing against the people, but the Chinatown we saw was very small, very commercial and not much to offer. The Buddhist temple was the best sight to see in the area but it had to be strange with a constant influx of tourists. Shops were pricey (as Singapore is) and only cool finds were ancient coins and customized rubber stamp in Chinese (you can bargain, prices vary)."
,,Wide variety of choices,3.0,,"In fact not just Chinese food, but also Malaysian, Singaporian, Indian ....food available。Some of the streets are now covered, become better in rainy days。"
,,Pretty great location to stay + explore.,4.0,,"Check out my blog for ideas/photos of Singapore and what i got up to in the 6 days i was there: https://asimplenurseslife.wordpress.com/2016/07/25/singapore/

I stayed at 'The Temple Inn' and it was the perfect location in the heart of China Town. Close to public transport and not too far from all the sites... it was the perfect location. Browsing the markets and sites in the area was great too!"
,,A Great Place For Photos,3.0,,Chinatown is great for taking photos but most of the shops sell the same things and a lot of things are quite overpriced. It is still worth a walk through but you will only need about an hour.
,,Chinna Twon,3.0,,"I visited China town with my friends,we can buy china products and we can eat china dishes on this place nothing else on this place."
,,Loved it,5.0,,"Great spot for food, markets and temples. Easy walk to city and stalls had a good selection to choose from. Had the best cup of coffee there."
,,"Temples, shops and food",4.0,,"Chinatown includes an fascinating combination of temples (Budhist and Hindu), plenty of shopping opportunities, as well as food options inside and out. We preferred outside and the option to buy food and drink from different places, whilst soaking up the atmosphere."
,,Stopover,3.0,,"Such a busy place streets are crowded with lots of people little markets and shops, beautiful flowers to buy. Interesting to watch the culture."
,,Reasonable Souvenirs and Foods,3.0,,"For me Chinatown in Singapore is average, as it is offer limited food dishes and unique souvenirs.

There isn't much unique Singapore souvenirs that I could buy, a lot of it is random and you definitely can get it cheaper else where. I definitely have seen a better Chinatown, therefore am a bit disappointed.

The dishes that is around the area is ok. It is definitely not that cheap, but I recommend that you try out the Spicy Crap dish! its spicy, juicy and very well seasoned.

Overall, you can give this a try but it not a WOW factor."
,,"FUN, SOMETHING DIFFERENT",3.0,,a place where you can find Chinese souvenir and lot of good Chinese street foods. One of the busiest street in Singapore. Must try and see the different from other Chinatown .
,,Always fun,5.0,,"A bit hot the day we visited but always interesting, much activity and plenty of cheap places to eat. Love going there."
,,"Lovely, Central, Lots to Do",5.0,,"I stayed in Chinatown on a very short trip to Singapore. I chose this area because it was where I needed to conduct my business. I'm so glad I stayed there! There's no shortage of hotels, hostels and food places, and I find the area very quaint. There are older buildings with looming glass and steel structures in the background - a lovely contrast. Because of the shortness of my visit, I didn't get a chance to explore as far as I wished so I think I'll have to come back! It's also easy and fairly quick to get to other areas of the city by subway from Chinatown."
,,Affordable,3.0,,One can buy souvenirs from here without making a hole in the pocket...some shops have fixed price while in some can bargain.. have few eateries also in case anyone use to rest n fill stomach ...
,,Touristy but fun,5.0,,I lived here for more than 6 years & was never bored with the cacophony of sights & sounds & smells. Wander around the backstreets (always safe) & inhale the way of life here in Singapore....allow plenty time as there's so much to see & do... Definitely ok to BARGAIN
,,Good place to buy souvenirs,4.0,,"Spent a nice pleasant afternoon here, despite the sudden downtown. Look out for souvenirs , the prices are better than the other places we saw. Apart from the usual magnets and keychains, you have fans, paintings, Chinese clothing and what not. Also got to sample Singapore's famous ice cream sandwich here. And don't forget to visit the Tintin Shop!"
,,Nice Place to Stroll & Pick up Souvenirs,4.0,,We visited here on a short layover in Singapore recently and took the opportunity to enjoy a bit of dim sum before browsing through the stalls selling tat ancient and not so old. The buildings have been preserved as they were back in the day and it is recommended as a place to visit as it is fascinating to pass a morning there.
,,Great just to walk around,4.0,,"We love the Singaporean architecture old and new, and this is classic. We also love Chinese food and the little glimpse into Chinese culture"
,,Had to see!,3.0,,"I really wanted to see China town during my visit, although I'm not quite sure what I was expecting. It wasn't as interesting as I""d hoped, lots of cheap tatty goods and cheap food. I thought there would be more specialist China and tea shops and better quality items for sale. I busted a temple which was interesting but remember you will need a scarf to cover your shoulders ."
,,"Souvenirs at a bargain, quick food and then some.",4.0,,"Trinket heaven! Come here for souvenirs at a bargain and ideal for those sampling hawker food for the first time. 'Premium' prices for street food and booze but small price to pay for convenience (all under one roof - or along one street, more like it) and organised chaos (i.e busy without the mess). I love that you can find a mosque, Buddhist and Hindu temple within one area. The cultural blend is beautiful. Chinatown is one of the few places in Singapore that still has 'character.' Tourist traps aside, it's worth a visit."
,,Good for Buy Singapore Souvenir Items,5.0,,"Go and Exit from ChinaTown in Singapore,You will have lot of item with good value for buy.I wish to recomment to any one to buy any thing."
,,Awesome place to visit,5.0,,"We have been to many Chinatowns in different countries but this obe is by far the nicest. It's clean, well organized and you can find really cool souveniers for very reasonable price"
,,Vacation,2.0,,"We took the double decker bus thru this area several. It has several routes, but several of them went in this direction. There was nothing extra special for us in this area. We saw it, that's all..."
,,Cheap souvenirs,4.0,,We went here and bought really cheap souvenirs and gifts. Lots of hawkers place with authentic chinese cuisines to eat in.
,,Very lively,4.0,,"Very nice for strolling around in the evening, taking in the lively atmosphere of the side walk restaurants and the bars and cafes along Club Street. Plenty of places for a good bite and a nice drink."
,,Joegrog,4.0,,A feast for the senses and great shops and 2 magnificent temples. A must see and we only spent a morning there before moving on to Botanical Gardens however we enjoyed it immensely. Look out for some great real artefact shops between both temples
,,Great Food and Fun,4.0,,"Even a tropical storm couldn't deter us from shopping along with everyone else.
Take care and cash is king! Don't pay first price on most things.
Great food dining but in a storm you may need to be happy sitting with your feet in puddles and the odd drip falling on you. All good fun in the holiday spirit!"
,,Myer's Jewellery in Chinatown. Well worth a visit!,4.0,,"I have been looking for a diamond ring for a while now. I saw an ad for Myer's Jewellery on a tourist map and decided to have a look while I was visiting Chinatown. Chinatown is worth a visit even if just for the experience. It's full of bargains and that's what I found at Myer's.
The woman I dealt with was lovely and seemed to really know what she was talking about. Her boss was lovely too. They both assured me that the price I was paying was wholesale and urged me to have my ring valued when I got back to NZ.
I did that. The ring was valued at almost $5000 more than what I paid for it!
If we ever go back to Singapore I will definitely go back to Myer's."
,,Bustling,5.0,,Stayed in the Dorsett hotel on the edge of China Town so it was an easy walk to get there. Quiet in the morning but it was very busy in the afternoon and evening. Food and merchandise of every kind is available A must see.
,,Good,4.0,,"If you have time, walk the streets of Chinatown. These old quaint houses are realy beautiful and the people very friendly. Lots of café's and restaurants and a good couple of stalls with all the souveniours you can think of."
,,The need are there,3.0,,Been there several times. Had a pretty good experience. Place crouded on evening and public holidays. Cheap stuff to buy and several heritage centre and tourist spots.
,,Chinatown revamped,4.0,,"In the ten months between visits the Chintatown precinct has had an extensive make over. During my previous visit the changes were still being undertaken. The results: excellent. There is more to see and do, certainly the shopping is good and probably less expensive than the Bugis Markets. The eating options are mainly Chinese, Korean as you would expect, but the food is filling and the beer cold. I enjoyed the night-time experience and partook an excellent meal. Easy access via the MRT or a taxi, which are not expensive in Singapore. The hop-on-hop-off bus tour also checks in at Chinatown."
,,Whats a visit to a city without visiting Chinatown! Lol,3.0,,"Being a Chinese-Canadian you get tired of hearing the word 'Chinatown'...so truthfully, we avoid visiting unless we 'must'. Singapore's Chinatown was a must for us only because we needed to hire a driver and a car for day trip outside of town. But I have to say, this visit was a nice surprise! The last time I was here was about 4 years ago...over the last 4 years, they've built such a nice concept for restaurants to open up and have a big rooftop you can walk under and get a little break from the scorching sun. A place to visit if you have some time on your trip!"
,,Travel with Young Kids,4.0,,"On our stay we followed the reviews and went to the Hawkers Market at Maxwell Road.

The walk through Chinatown was interesting and the children enjoyed watching the vibrant community including the men playing checkers and the usual market traders.

Maxwell road was a good Hawkers Market, clean and well run with a fabulous selection of food from staples such as Chicken Rice to delicious local Curry Puffs ( my personal favourite).

By chance we ended up back in Chinatown and happened upon the local food market at the People's Park, this was in my view far superior to Maxwell Road, it was more authentic, bustling and considerably cheaper and as an added bonus is metres from the MRT Chinatown Stop. We ate well as a family of 5 ( with big appetites) for around 25 SGD including soft drinks, the food was fabulously authentic and the people watching provided us with lots of entertainment."
,,Okay Like Others,3.0,,"It was very pretty and a nice,place to get Chinese food from street stalls and a few trinkets. You can barter. The stalls all sold the same thimgs after walking a bit, there's a gorgeous Hindu temple at the end of the street and Buddha Tooth as well."
,,Fabulous place,5.0,,"This is my favourite place in Singapore.
A must visit for everyone.
There are many souvenir shops and very inexpensive.
There are so many eateries but the hawker stalls are the best, delicious food cooked in front of you.
You can buy jade jewellery here but the selling is very pressurised.
Very atmospheric at night with the red lanterns overhead and the colourful boards at the Windows."
,,for the cheapest souvenirs,5.0,,Nice place to have some lunch and try chinese fast food. To have a walk and find some souvenirs from Singapore
,,Fantastic area for wandering,5.0,,"This area most definitely deserved more than the fairly quick tour that I took. I would highly recommend having a leisurely couple of hours to wander around and explore the back streets. This is my quick overview.
I started off at Chinatown MRT and did the lonely planet walk backwards as I was coming from Tiong Bahru. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a major Singapore tourism sight. I didn’t go in as a church or temple has to be pretty special these days to get me to take my shoes off and head inside. From a photography point of view, I enjoyed being able to capture its traditional architecture against the modern buildings of Singapore. Tourist buses galore here.
There is then a lovely road to follow called Ann Siang Rd which is to the side of the temple. The beginning of this road is full on tourist tat market. However, if you continue to follow it the road becomes far more atmospheric with beautiful buildings and delicious looking restaurants. This road then takes many turns and requires some stairs to take you on to Amoy Street. This was also a great street for wandering – very photogenic and interesting and different shops and restaurants."
,,Go beyond the usual street stalls,4.0,,"Go ahead and browse the street shops if you must. Great for cheap souvenirs from sundresses to satin wine pouches. It's also a place to try some great local delicacies and treats.
In Chinatown Point:
Basement 1 lift lobby area. Look for The Golden Duck. If in stock, these sell out salted duck egg coated crisps are to die for. Full of umame. You can't stop until you've finished the packet...and it's a large packet!
Basement 2. Look for Pure Pandan. It sells the most wonderfully-light-as-air pandan chiffon cakes. I had a slice and wish I had bought the whole cake. Tip: I declared it at Melbourne Airport on entry and IT IS ALLOWED!
Outside, look for Lim Chee Guan and Bee Cheng Hiang for their bak kwa (barbequed pork slices). Even if you don't end up buying anything, they will give out samples. Another tip: the sealed packets of bak kwa are allowed into Australia. Up to 500g. Just declare it. Even the custom officers know it as bak kwa!
Wholesale kitchenware alert at Sia Huat in Temple Street. If you have a lot of luggage allowance, this is THE place for all things wining and dining.
Chinatown Complex food market in Smith Street. A food stop housing even a Michelin-starred hawker stall. It's hot and humid. But it's good. There is even a beer stall in there which must have like a hundred different beers by the bottle!

So enjoy Chinatown in Singapore! So much to see/eat/do!"
,,Must see,5.0,,I always been a big fan of Chinatown around the world if you're interested in Asian culture food and good crowd this is the place to be a many shops great restaurants nice people very good bargain not only that you get to try foods you never tried before really it's a must see if you in Singapore
,,Good one,4.0,,Chinese in Singapore... Good experience and experienced travel. Cheap for leaving and loads of red color in the place. Ok to travel. Thanks.
,,Very unique,5.0,,Great place to hang around and shop for souvenirs. A lot of history ham packed in the modern way of life. Full of sites and colours. We spent an hour here but I could have spend half a day.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,My husband and I love Chinatowns all over the world so we couldn't go past a visit when in Singapore. Of course there are the usual stores with the usual stock but there are also some amazing things that are unique to this wonderful city. Also there is a shopping mall close by with the most amazing dumpling restaurant.
,,Great place to get your souvenirs and gifts,4.0,,"Loads of places to get traditional Chinese gifts, there's a bit of hard sell though, si be posted to say no and haggle on prices etc.

Also there Jade jewellery etc seemed very expensive compared to other places in Asia.

Lots of places to have dim sum etc"
,,Colourful and buzzy,4.0,,"Take one of the several buses to visit Chinatown. The buses in Singapore are the best in the world . Each bus stop has a live-update on the buses about to arrive . In addition the bus stop is complete with information on all the Singapore bus numbers and their destinations. You really cannot get lost in Singapore. Chinatown is full of wonderful Chinese eateries , cake shops and Chinese medicine shops. Stop by and have some dim sum one morning ( preferably before 11.30am before they start preparing for lunch )."
,,Short Street,4.0,,"Compared to other countries (perhaps Bangkok, Melbourne), Chinatown in SIngapore is short. Small. Walkable in 30mins.

But you may be tempted to linger at one of the many souvenir shops (trust me, the prices are mostly similar. those with cheaper price may not have the best quality), restaurants, cafe or perhaps just taking photos at the various hotspots. Not a terrible big experience. But if you're from a country with very little contact with Chinese people, then this is it.

Soak in the historical shophouses and learn the story behind them. Why they were built and who inhabited it previously.

Do it. (cos there's not much else to do in Singapore anyway)"
,,It's Chinatown,3.0,,It's Chinatown...a little more picturesque. Super touristy. Like any other city Chinatown...if you've seen one...
,,Chinatown views.,4.0,,Really interesting place with so many eateries. Found cheaper places to eat on the extremities of Chinatown. Great spot for Dim Sum meals.
,,Cleanest Chinatown!,4.0,,"I have been to a number of Chinatowns but Singapore has the cleanest of them all! We went to Smith St hawker area as there was construction on Maxwell area. We walked around scouting for a good place to have lunch. There were plenty of food and restaurant options! We were pleasantly surprised with the food at the Lanzhou Lamian at 19 smith st. The noodle dishes, soup dumpling fried rice and pork chop dishes we ordered were superb! After lunch, we walked around and got souvenirs. Souvenirs there were cheap! We also went to the temple near smith street. I wasn't able to go inside because I was wearing shorts. They will lend you skirts to cover your legs for free if you want to go inside."
,,Excellent food on a budget,5.0,,Many people talk about high prices in Singapore but excellent food at reasonable prices is available in Chinatown A vibrant lively place well worth a visit
,,very interesting to shop and dine..,5.0,,"my self and my wife spent a lovely evening at China town. We took the MRT which is the best way to travel if you do not have kids. China town has amazing sovereigns at dirt cheap prices, along with a line of restaurants that serve the best Chinese food along with a chill beer. Loved the experience."
,,Hustle but no hassle,5.0,,Always a joy to wander around among the many stalls selling trinkets galore. Great street food as always. Worth just settling down with a cool drink and watch the works go by for a couple of hours.
,,Sugar cane lovers,5.0,,"I visit chinatown in every big city. Here i had my first fresh squeezed sugar cane juice. Yammie..................
Walking into their medicine shops is also very interesting. I buyed some medicine oils, like White Flowers and its much cheaper than in the City(of course they have to pay expensive rents there)"
,,I always enjoy a trip to Chinatown,4.0,,"For interesting souvenirs, I always like to go to Chinatown. It's crowded and hot during the day, but fun."
,,Chinatown walk,4.0,,"Went here to find the relic temple, along the way was fun and lots of souvenir shops coming out from the Smrt, hawker place, lots of history, iconic buildings and restaurants, had the wafer Icecream and stopped by to grab some kopi c by hill street coffee, roasted chestnuts, bought bak wa sg version of a jerky after visiting the Buddha relic temple which was great"
,,It's a market.,3.0,,"Chinatown, Singapore is a section of the city where many Chinese people live and do business. The main attraction is the markets which are pretty much like markets everywhere. There is also a temple that has part of Buddah's tooth. It's a colourful area and you can buy lots of Chinese stuff."
,,Market,3.0,,"Many food and things to buy, becareful to get lost with your friends as it is crowded. Foodcourt filled with people however they have varities kind of food, interesting place for food lovers."
,,must go,4.0,,"China town is busy and hustle street in Singapore, which have plenty of souvenir, restaurants with cheap price."
,,Cheapest Rates!,5.0,,Visiting Singapore will be complete without the enjoyable shopping spree at Chinatown...do not forget to drop by at Bugis for your food trip where Shabu-Shabu is at its best! Cha La
,,A Souvenir Paradise,4.0,,"An interesting place full of little stalls. This is where you can buy those souvenirs to take home. There were plenty of food stalls as well.The OG Department store is close by and we found this to be very good, especially for shoes."
,,An afternoon in Chinatown,4.0,,We went shopping in the Chinatown Markets and purchased many of our gifts for family and friends as well as a new camera lens and a neck lace for the misses.
,,One of my top five favourite places on Singapore,5.0,,"You can spend a whole day walking down the streets of Chinatown and never see all of the wonderful shops and sights , but it's truly a destination not to be missed .
From the traditional Chinese architecture , to the delicious and wide section of food , it's a pleasure to enjoy for all of your senses .
Definitely plan to spend at least one full day and prepare to me immersed in great traditional ambiance and festive experience ."
,,Exotic and touristy,5.0,,"Walked around Singapore's Chinatown - many of the stalls appear to sell the precise same T shirts and other touristy souvenirs. Everyone had the same ""sale"" and was willing to give me a ""special price."""
,,Perfect Place for Souvenir Shopping,4.0,,"Chinatown was a wonderful section to explore and get to some reasonable shopping in Singapore. The streets are lined with merchants touting a wide variety of souvenirs for purchase, from postcards, to clothing, to knick knacks.

The venders were not overly pushy and allowed for a comfortable browsing and shopping experience. The further you went into Chinatown, the better the deals seemed to be.

Food is also available for purchase, although I was not adventurous enough for that."
,,Nice heritage buildings and temple,4.0,,"There is a local wet market in the midst of Chinatown. Lots of stalls to buy cheap Singapore souvenirs like key chains and tshirts. Some old shops selling traditional chinese medicine and household stuff. We like the hawker food street, with satay, hokkien noodles, laksa, tiger beer, etc. Best time to visit is early evening and stay for dinner. Plenty of nice restaurants in the vicinity too."
,,Locals consider this locale inaccurate at best,3.0,,"The population is predominantly Chinese and the tourist perception of Traditional China Town has long been replaced by the metropolis of modern Singapore. What you actually see are just shops that ply their trade for just tourists. Cheap Souvenirs are the only real attraction here. Few of these accurately depict what the Chinese demographic consider traditional items. A better venue would be the Singapore Museum or the Peranakan Museum, where historical accuracy filters out the deception that is designed to fit age old tourist misconceptions. The nearby Hawker Centre is a better bet for local fare than the overpriced restaurants that line the streets. Here food is priced at the lowest prices. Follow the long queues that locals form, they are invariably the better stalls. Warm, dirty and crowded, but the true flavours of the island lie here."
,,No,1.0,,"I simply dislike the noisy and dirty environment there.. if not careful, some ill-mannered people can push you, step on your feet without any apologies."
,,Souvenirs galore,4.0,,"This is the place to buy cheap aouvenirs amidst tourist attractions. The stalls are areanged neatly with a variety of Singapore souvenirs including wooden fans, t- shirts, caps, bags lipstick cases, purses etc. A few shops selling drinks, fruits, snacks and roasted chestnuts. In the night, the atmosphere is more alive with the crowds spilling over from the restaurants onto the streets and this area becoming a night market. An experience in itself."
,,Market,3.0,,Should have got a guide for the history and learnt what we could be didn't realize until it was too late.
,,Good way to spend a morning,4.0,,"Like other Chinatowns in San Francisco, etc., but a pleasant way to spend a morning looking at trinkets and getting something to eat. Easy to reach on the MRT."
,,Great food!,4.0,,China Town is great with a huge range of resturants and great food! There is also a huge strip of markets which are great little shopping stalls.
,,The best Chinatown i've ever seen in the world!,5.0,,"Been to ones in North america, but this one in Singapore is the most CLEAN and well ORGANIZED Chinatown of all!! could feel the true color/culture/gourmets in this part of the country! worth the time to go and explore, and you won't regret!"
,,Very Chinesse...,5.0,,"We've been to some China towns somewhere, but in Singapore you will see very very Chinese culture because most people here orginally came from China, they still keep their culture and tradition which is shown in the foods, house decoration, temple, languge....we walked around the town, had some shopping and took some street food there, a night with lots of fun. Loved it..."
,,Great afternoon wandering around,4.0,,"I found it very interesting to wander around Chinatown around about lunchtime on a weekday. The area was well patronised and vibrant, plenty going on and the foodstalls and restaurants were decently priced."
,,Bustling Chinatown,4.0,,"This is one of the best Chinatown's I have visited in any city. You have the markets, temples, Restaurants and food hawkers all around you. Loved the food alley with all the different stalls you can choose from to eat tasty fresh food."
,,A little piece of nolstagia,5.0,,"Despite the tourists- targeted shops that line the streets amongst the shophouses, the place still has that nostalgic feel to it. Historical buildings make great photo material and the food available is the area are aplenty, cheap and taste marvellous."
,,It is weird there's a chinatown in this china alike country/city,3.0,,"I found it very strange that there's a chinatown in Singapore the little china - although they don't accept it.
The core activity of chinatown, of course is dinning. You smell a mix of south east Asian cuisines and see westerns enjoying themselves in made for tourist food.
Architecture and decoration is what tourist like, but colonial streetscape is really not my cup of tea.
There a few quieter streets on the outskirts which I do prefer, but sadly they are packed with Korean and Japanese restaurants."
,,Good place to buy souvenirs.,4.0,,"This street filled with shops has a lot to offer. Make sure to make your way through before buying as some shops offer bigger discounts.
It's a great place to buy souvenirs at low costs. You can also enjoy the old buildings while you ealk through the street. Food is available if you get hungry while you shop."
,,"Sites, sounds, and food, glorious food",5.0,,"An easy wander up and down streets exploring the sights, engaging with jovial stall owners, shopping for those holiday trinkets, or even get a suit tailor made. Glorious food experience at any number of the hawker stalls."
,,Chinatown at Singapore,5.0,,A good place to purchase suveniers at good prices. You can taste the real chinase food. It will take half day to visit the areas of interest at Chinatown
,,Cheap goods,4.0,,Chinatown in Singapore is basically a series of shops but with a market feel. Whether you want copies of dvd's or presents for the folk at home you find it here.
,,Chinatown with the best satays and cold beer,4.0,,"Chinatowns all over the world seem to be similar, interesting little shops, some total junky tourist stuff and restaurants. Singapore Chinatown has all of the forementioned, but I do like the architecture of the old shop houses, few remain in Singapore, so that is unique. I really love the satay stall and cold beer that is served from about 6pm when some of the shops shut and the street turns into delicious food stalls offering all sorts of Singapore yummy food. Inhale the smells, absorp the warmth, listen to the chanter and noise and most of all appreciate the people who work hard everyday setting up, cooking over hot pans and grills and providing a nice smile when they serve you their specialty. The routine is simple, find a table on the street, the beer lady quickly appears and somehow produces icy cold beer, in a minute. While you savour the cold beverage you can decide which stall you would like to sample. You then wander up to the stall and purchase the item and then enjoy the piping hot fresh selection of food, made in-front of you. You can repeat this process till you can't possible squeeze another scrumptious satay and peanut sauce past your lips. Well possibly, you could just manage an icy dessert delight piled high with fruit sauces and colourful tasty things I can't even describe.

Visitors get a quick feel of street eating, while enjoying the sights of Chinatown, well worthwhile doing, its cheap eating, and even tho it's a tourist spot, as a local we would often pop in for a satay and beer. Don't worry, its safe eating, as all the food stalls have to meet stringent Singapore Food and Hygiene requirements. If the steamy air doesn't appeal to you, there are many restaurants to chose from which offer air con."
,,China Town Singapore,5.0,,"The atmosphere was great and the stalls are so original, you will find gifts that are found nowhere else.
The food stalls smell fantastic and the people are really friendly.
We had some clothes made by an independent tailor, we are still wearing the clothes today. As we were leaving the next day the clothes were made and delivered to our hotel the same evening, complete with an orchid to say thankyou"
,,Walking day,5.0,,Was great to walk around China Town called into the Buddhist temple and was able to watch a live service . The atmosphere around the streets was bustling with activity . There was lots of eateries both restaurant 's and street food. Along with market stalls and shops selling souvenirs to Cameras and jewelry of all types. With all the activity our two teenage boys where entertained by people watching as well as all the cultural differences from a real life Chinatown.
,,One of the nicest and most vibrant neighbourhood in Singapore,5.0,,"Chinatown is one of the nicest and most vibrant neighbourhood in Singapore, laden with history, early 20th Century building, shophouses, restaurants and cultural sights. Do not miss the food court at Chinatown Complex."
,,Different but in a nice way,5.0,,"What I like about Singapore is you visit several cultures but in small and one day visit package , china town is one of the nice experiences of Singapore from the MRT station opening in a souvenir shops alley to its unique food street the the temple , it's all a different and nice expectancy to enjoy , having a Chinese dish in street corner bar is one of them ."
,,Shopping,4.0,,"near to Chinatown MRT station. Crowded but yet able to do shopping. If Malaysia we will bargain price, but here I never ask for it. A lot of shop and stall. Prefer evening time."
,,Better at night,4.0,,"We did the daytime walk through the market area, and was pretty much the way we last saw it 2 years ago, very little seems to have changed. It is still an exciting ethnic place to come and see, better when they have some dragon dancing displays on though, even if the crowd can be a squeeze.
Night time this place seems to develop a surge of people, being mainly those that wish to come and sample all the traditional foods that are on show, at quite reasonable prices. Seating comes at a bit of a premium, especially the establishments that serve the fierce chili crab dish, which sorts the men from the boys we were warned! I wimped out I have to admit, you really got me this time Chinatown. Great fun, but not if you do not like crowds folks!"
,,Back Lanes of Chinatown,4.0,,"While there are modernization of Chinatown, please look at the back streets and quaint shops. Traditional methods are still there, if you can find it. If there were no re-painting or clean up, the place would have looked unhygienic and unsightly and possibly awful.
What the Singapore government had done was to spruce up the place and maintaining the old charm. Being one who has visited Chinatown numerous times per year, it is still a treat going back.
Along Smith Street, there is a traditional dim sum restaurant. $2 chicken rice, and this general shop selling everything which you need.
further down there is an organic food place and the menu changes everyday. They are run by a family passed down by traditions.
In the food centre, 2nd floor, there are again lots of traditional food stalls, look for the chee cheong fun, claypot rice and also chwee kueh shops!"
,,Commercialized Chinatown,3.0,,The traditional charm of Chinatown has somewhat diminished due to over-development. Prices of goods are higher due to tourism. There are still a few good Chinese restaurants in the area.
,,Worth a visit if you are in Singapore,5.0,,Wide range of shops and restaurants. Shops have souviniers and you can also buy clothing etc. Nice to walk around.
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,We really enjoyed our strolls around Chinatown. It's very similar to Chinatowns that can be seen in other cities. The prices are reasonable and you can even find cheap beer (cheap for Singaporean standards of course). There are some nice temples in the area too so explore well.
,,A Fun Place,5.0,,"Chinatown was everything we had anticipated, loud, colourful & boisterous. The SMRT station brings you up into the street market area where stalls selling all types of clothing, food & souvenirs abound. Our visit was during the day but we look forward to our next visit where'll we do a night visit."
,,Buzzing and fun,4.0,,"We stayed in Chinatown and loved Food Street and surrounding lanes. It's a handy location as it's close to Marina Bay and has plenty of atmosphere. The architecture is well preserved also, as is the local Chinese community."
,,Love Chinatown,5.0,,Great place to visit. Food is wonderful. Great souvenirs. Lovely at night. Very atmospheric...... Easy to get to by MRT

,,Colorful,4.0,,Chinatowns are always a colorful and fun place to roam about. Easily accessible with the metro and nice to walk through.
,,food street market,3.0,,chinese famous market at singapore food street and you can buy gift shop at market around here many hotel
,,Worth seeing,4.0,,"This Chinatown is quite similar to others around the world from New York to San Francisco to Los Angeles and others.
There are streets and rows of shops that carry many items and plenty of lower end gifts.
There are many restaurants that are probably frequented more by locals than tourists. Lunch time is a zoo."
,,Disappointing unless you move away from the shopping area.,3.0,,Away from the shopping area there are some nice buildings and restaurants but otherwise it's wall to wall tourist shopping.
,,something different but all same :),4.0,,Something different but after check all the shops all same :) boring :) oh well... been there and done that.
,,Good food and markets,3.0,,"Great place to walk around, check out some of the sights and shop. There are lots of shops and markets, however mostly the same things. There are many little restaurants and the food marked in the area, so great place for good and inexpensive eats."

,,Love Chinatown,5.0,,"I love Chinatown Singapore, good place to pick up a bargain or a souvenir, once your done you can relax in one of the many cafes. Or you can walk across the street to the Hawkers market and try some authentic Singapore cuisine. Exit Chinatown MRT Pagoda street for the heart of the action."
,,Food and markets,5.0,,"Found the market place, food and night activities a great place to explore. Look for Maxwells hawker food market a block or so away from the more touristy Pagoda Street"
,,A place to look for gifts,5.0,,Gifts for yourself and your friends. I am sure you find something they don't have back home. And surprise there is always some room to negotiate for more expensive items. Do look at the nearby chinese temple.
,,Mr,5.0,,It was cool. Transportation to China town eventhough far from where i was staying (Changi) was facilitated by the train which is relatively cheaper. Bought a lot of souvenirs at affordable prices.
,,Mass Rapid Place,4.0,,"The smell of Pork's dishes so strong (i dont like it), sell many cheap souvenirs and i love to check a pagodas.."
,,Fun evening in China town,3.0,,Wonderful sights in the evening and enjoyed eating out in the streets. Husband relaxed and had a beer while I looked at shops.
,,Stopover,3.0,,"China town is great for reasonably priced food . The markets are quite poor quality and lots of the same thing . Pleasant to have a wander around , has a good atmosphere ."
,,Hard sellers,4.0,,"We strolled around Chinatown during the early evening, it is a lovely place with many beautiful buildings, some less than beautiful too it has to be said. The stall holders tend to have a hard sell approach and want to get you into their shops, then you have to query the price, which they are obviously used to.
Worth a visit but once was enough, the restaurant was good though, see Zhong Hua Bao Ding.
Be careful where you walk as there are lots of religious offerings on the floor so walking is not always easy."
,,Souvenirs,5.0,,"If you are looking for that souvenir and night market experience, then you must come to Chinatown. You will not be disappointed. Don't forget to barter with the store holders but with in reason as everything is already very cheap"
,,Busy night market,4.0,,"China town is easy to get to on the MRT and we walked straight out into the market.
Lots of souvenirs and although some stalls sold the same just check the prices. China town has free wifi but i found it hard to log into it.
Signs around say beware of pickpockets but that can be said of any busy market."
,,Very authentic,5.0,,"Nice part of town and very authentic, had some great food here in a couple of small bars. A very memorable part of our visit to Singapore."
,,Back to Basics,4.0,,"Chinatown is the perfect antidote if you have been through the countless sleek (perhaps soulless) shopping malls around the city.
Forget Armani and Airconditioning, you will be exposed to good old fashioned street traders selling you any imaginable tourist trinket, at dirt cheap prices. The Buildings will bring you back to simpler days, reminiscent of its colonial past. The street food is also authentic and freshly cooked on the spot."
,,My visit,3.0,,If you want to buy bargain especially souviners for give away this is the right place for you plenty of shops and variety of items but sometimes place becomes a little bit to crowded.
,,A Must see,5.0,,"A visit to China Town is a must when in Singapore- its all hustle and bustle with tourists, lots and lost of food outlets, and plenty of souvenir stalls and shops, all selling low quality goods which in one way is an attraction of the place all in all its good to spend an hour or twp wondering the streets"
,,Don't visit Singapore without going to Chinatown,5.0,,"Singapore is a concrete glass steel and chrome city filled with soaring skyscrapers and it is magnificent. But Chinatown, with its narrow streets of old shophouses is a taste of the pre 1965 Singapore. It is full of colours, smells, noises of the Orient. Sikh, Buddhist and Muslim temples, Chinese medicine shops, outdoor food stalls, narrow streets filled with colourful stalls selling every variety of tat along with beautiful sets of chopsticks, intricately decorated porcelain, jade jewellery and silk kimonos. There is also a fresh food market where exotic fruits are sold alongside live frogs (4 for 10 SD), eels and an astonishing variety of fresh fish. Prices are very cheap but bargaining is not really encouraged. Decent public loos in the Food Street."
,,Good nick nack shopping.,4.0,,This is the place to buy you cheap gifts. Many cheap stores and for your needs. Forget getting stuff at attractions. Also good Chinese restaurants there.
,,Tourist must-visit,5.0,,"Easy access using Chinatown MRT A (Pagoda St.). Many food stalls, souvenir shops, and restaurant. Nice if you like to walk around, see unique things or buy souvenirs. There are some shops with exact price and also some where you can bargain. In very hot weather it may be uncomfortable to walk around the streets. Don't forget to try street foods, drinks, also local dishes."
,,Chinatown now and then,4.0,,"I have been going to Chinatown since a kid. I consider myself blessed to have watched Chinatown's transformation. The old Chinatown was bustling with street hawkers and perhaps a bit more rowdy. Gang fights and rickety wooden staircases from the coolie quarters were a constant fear. When I walked up the dark and rotten staircases, i was fearful that I could slide into a hole.

The now Chinatown is so pristine and many efforts have been made to bring back some vibrancy. Although it has been labelled touristy and lacked the color of the past, it has retained the architectural charm through extensive renovation. If you used to live upstairs in coolie quarters before, having soot from charcoal stoves covering the walls and the lack of toilet facilities, you would appreciate the clean environment. There are perhaps less residents in the coolie quarters. All of them are businesses and restaurants.
Do join a out of the beaten tracks by an internal tour to learn about a certain shop being a slave post, some savory rumors and folklore. Just let your imagination run."
,,Old charm,4.0,,if you want a bargain go to China town street market. Day or night always different. Old building like the Chinese opera house that is now a hotel. Also very good street food chilli crab great if you like hot and spicy. On the edge of china town you will find Buddha tooth relic temple and tourist information centre right in front.
,,Love it!!,5.0,,"We had a great time, plenty to look at, some the shopping is the same stuff but there is a lot of interesting stuff. Look out for the fish spa. My 3 girls convinced me to do with them what a great laugh."
,,worth a wander,3.0,,I thought there would be some nice stalls selling some individual trinkets but mostly the things on sale were all the same. A lot of stall owners coming out and trying to entice you in. Go and take a walk through by all means but have low expectations. There is a parade in the evenings that we didn't get to see but its worth keeping in mind.
,,China Town,5.0,,"We spent two days around Chinatown so were able to take our time to soak up the sights here. There are 4 main shopping/eating streets here and you can get around these failry quickly but it is very hot/humid so you might want to stop every now and again for a cool drink or something to eat from any of the various eateries to make the visit easier. Bargain shopping here for touristy stuff, clothing, knick-knacks as well as a variety of eating places. Busy, bustling but not overwhelmingly so. Enjoyable"
,,MUST SEE,5.0,,Colourfull - happy - plenty of food - many stores - excellent deal - massage places and good ones too

,,Okay bit not great if you have been to China,3.0,,"I visited this area, it was crowded but I found I was disappointed as I have been to other China towns and been to China so this felt a bit like a sad reproduction. I did buy a couple of trinkets but I would not recommend it. It was one of the few places that I did not feel safe because of pickpocket warning signs everywhere."
,,Night markets and food (smith)street restaurants,5.0,,"Great place to wander through and pick up a Nic nac or two, easy walking and straight off the train. Lots of stalls. We stopped and had a nice meal of satay sticks in food street - there is plenty of variety - something for everyone."

,,Mostly the same products,3.0,,Worth a visit but expect it to be crowed and most of the shops mainly sell souvenir items and they all have similar products. Expect to be accosted by Tailors wanting to make a sale and there are ample eateries to choose from. The area like the rest of the city is clean and well presented.

Take a wander down the atmospheric streets, dropping into shop houses to see what’s for sale.

Admire the rooftop dragons of the Thian Hock Keng Temple, dedicated to the Goddess of the Sea, and the festively gaudy Hindu Sri Mariamman Temple, covered with colorful cows and depictions of the gods.

The uplifting and often moving history of Chinatown’s residents is displayed at the Heritage Center, and you’ll find several large shopping malls here, including the People’s Park.

Of course, Chinatown is also the place to go to for great food, especially along Smith Street, which is often closed off to form an outdoor eat street. You can also choose from a huge array of street food at the Chinatown Complex hawker center."

Full of life even though it was Ramadan. Plenty of shops, stalls selling everything from tacky souvenirs to high end goods.

Good night life with a few bars but can also be expensive but then it is Singapore."
,,Fabulous location to immerse yourself in a Chinatown experience.,4.0,,"A great example of a 'chinatown'. Surpasses most in the world.

It's a giant open air market type environment through the streets and buildings. I found all shop keeper that I encountered very friendly. They are willing to bargain a little but don't be to insulting. I noticed if they came to there no lower price and I felt it was to high I'd say thank you and walk away... they would lower it go get you to come back. Food looked good although I never tried any."

,,"Loved it, then thought about it....",3.0,,"Initially I loved this area! So hustle and bustle and a refreshing change from skyscrapers and fancy food. We ate frequently at the hawker center here which was eye opening and tasty!

After a while the interest wore off and it was easier to see sometimes the locals weren't exactly as friendly as I'd thought, which was dissapointing.

But don't let that turn you off get down there and explore!"
,,"This is not the same as long time ago, but still interesting",5.0,,"Long time ago I used to spend days rambling through the Chinatown in Singapore. Recently the place changed quite a lot. It is more organized and highly polished for tourists. So, this not really the same. But, we have to accept what we can get. What I like there? Some of the temples are still great, but ""no photography"". There are here a few places where ordinary people eat. There is great choice of food, just regular South East Asian food. Sometimes the food looks so strange, but you have to be a bit brave and taste everything what you can find there. This is good adventure. I guess, not everybody will agree with me :-)"

,,"China town, Singapore",4.0,,"This is a nice place for eating, bargain buying & just seeing. There are so many things to buy, but you have to be a hard bargainer - you can start from 20% of the price quoted. Don't hesitate. Eat in the street shops - not the regular restaurants. I you are going in group, order as many items as there are people, so that you can savor many items. If you don't have anything to buy or have a full stomach, just go around. You will not regret it"

,,The Chinese experience in Singapore,5.0,,"We loved this place.
We visited first just wondering around the streets, markets, shopping malls etc. Then we revisited at the end of our stay for the obligatory souvenirs/gifts and actually still wish we'd bought more.
Shop around but prices are pretty much the same as in they are all offering the same stuff 3 for 10dollars. But great little gifts.
We ate in the food hall at the top of a shopping centre, we were the only Europeans there! Great sign to us and the food was great. Two different plates with meat and rice came to a total of 7 dollars.....my partners beer cost that on it's own. Superb value when you just need a bite to eat on a day out.

All in all great for travellers on a budget as we were on this trip."

The temple front entrance is very colorful . There is a very tall somewhat triangular shape plate decorated with many deities & scattered all over the tall triangular plate , that as placed above the entrance door. . There were also some other colorful statues of deities at the back of the temple that lined the edges of the roof. You have to take off your shoes to go inside the temple, which I did not want to do , for fear that my shoes might get lost so I did not see what was inside the temple. There was another temple further down the road , a Buddhist Temple . There was a ceremony going on when I arrived there. There were Tall Golden statues of their deity & the temple was decorated elegantly mostly in gold color & the ceiling has an artistic design in red & gold color. I was able to take some photos inside which was allowed. Along the way back to our Van with the tour group , there were street vendors & stores that lined the road & I saw some things that I like & bought some souvenirs. I enjoyed my visit."
,,Cheap Goods. Not Very Good Quality,2.0,,IT is a ok place to buy souvenirs. Very crowded. Product quality not very good. Better to stay away. However there are some good food shops there. Can be tried.

,,Great place to shop and eat!!!,5.0,,There is something for everyone in Chinatown. Great food with plenty of choices available. Easy access to / from MRT. People's Park shopping complex is a good place to find a Singtel sim card for your phone use. Much cheaper than global roaming

,,Nice place,5.0,,It is a good place to learn about history of the Singapore by visiting the heritage museum located in Chinatown.Also you will find traditional gift items with Chinese food all around for decent price.There are some Chinese medicine shops available too.
,,Souveniers at low cost,4.0,,"You can buy many gifts & souveniers from the shops located here. It's very cost effective. Most shops don't accept credit cards, so please carry sufficient cash with you. Don't forget to bargain. Also check out for durian in the fruit juice shop"
,,Fun and cheap!,5.0,,"Okay cheap is relative but compared to other Singapore prices, have a look and you can barter on some stalls. Food is good and cheap and very clean on all the stalls. Children would love to have a few dollars to spend on all manner of tat as well as purchasing a cheap hat or bag for yourself. Good atmosphere and there is a tube station right in the middle of the action."
,,Chinese authentic souvenir items!,5.0,,"The glory of Chinatown market can be seen once you move upwards using escalator from underground Chinatown MRT station. There are several similar tiny shops selling lots of authentic Chinese items, food as well as lots of souvenir shops and numerous other Chinese buildings and temples. Really worth a visit!"
,,Chinatown Singapore,3.0,,"OK place to visit. Mostly Chinese / Buddhist temples and Chinese shops trying to sell Poor Quality Chinese goods at exorbitant prices one has to negotiate a lot, still not worth the money. Authentic Chinese food mostly Non -Veg. Many massage parlous."
,,Some really good bargains,4.0,,"Most traders in China Town are trustworthy and very genuine. Love to come to this place on our trips to Singapore. We bought fans, chop sticks and a hairbrush at a really good shop. The girls are so good and attentive. This shop is midway down Pagoda Street. Have shopped there many times. Love it.
On the down side. There is a trader who is quite devious and not to be trusted. He has a camera store at the Temple end of Pagoda Street. Didn't give a receipt, stated he was duty free - no such thing in Singapore unless you are in the airport. There was many more things that this man failed in. Will never go there again."
,,Place for cheap souvenirs!,4.0,,"Nice place to take a stroll in the evening and check few stalls around if you want to buy some cheap souvenirs. If you like Chinese food, there are many shops offering good choices and that too is not very costly."
,,Nice place!,5.0,,"If you miss China, this is the place to go. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a must see. Good bargains. Colorful small buildings."
,,Busy busy busy...,3.0,,"If you like shopping, then this is for you. Thousands of small shop selling anything from a needle pin to a dead policeman. A definate place for shoppers, now go and spend your money..."
,,You'll think you're in China.,5.0,,"Spend an afternoon carousing thru Chinatown, see and smell all what it has to offer. Great food and culture...the Chinese are the second most amount of foreigners residing in Singapore. Meander thru the streets and buy a few souvenirs to take home."
,,Lots to see,5.0,,We took the light rail from our hotel to visit Chinatown. There are just so much to see and you won't go hungry because food stall are everywhere. We also bought some beautiful jewelry.
,,Worth a wander,5.0,,we spent hours strolling around the many streets and markets. Nobody hassled us to buy which is nice.
,,Worth a look,3.0,,Interesting place did like wondering around but seemed like stall after stall of the same thing. Going to the toilet had to laugh chased by an old Chinese lady yelling $2 and dont think paying will guarantee a clean cubicle went to 5 before I found one only to then discover no toilet paper so be warned in some of them you have to get the toilet paper from the one roll on the wall before you go in. I still enjoyed wondering around though because it was different
,,"So much to see, do and admire",5.0,,"Yes there's a Chinatown in every city in the world but Singapore's Chinatown has the terrific blend of the old, the kitsch, the new and the hip. The trick was to read up on the tourism website and other travel books. I was here a couple of years ago on chinese new year and glad to return without the massive crowd. There's several hip drinking bars and restaurants around. Suggest wearing a good pair of walking shoes and wander around 5 pm when it is less hot."
,,Pouring Rain but still spectacular.,5.0,,Stalls selling everything a tourist could want in hundreds of stalls. A complete contrast to Orchard road. Lots of places to eat and just watch the throng go by. Only place in Singapore I saw notices warning of pick pockets so be careful.
,,Great food and a place to buy stuff,4.0,,This place is unbelievable. The array of shops and places to eat is awesome. There are many natural medicine shops which sell an array of products to cure pretty much anything. Stop by at the Chinatown complex for some yummy and cheap food or a great place to buy some souvenirs. Still quite a traditional place and worth a walk. Chinatown also had a train station which sells the tourist pass
,,Nices markets and temples!,4.0,,Chinatown in Singapore has lots of authentic Chinese food available as well as lots of souvenir shops and numerous other Chinese buildings and temples. There's a subway station that will take you right to it! Definitely worth a visit!
,,China Town,5.0,,If you are looking for a souvenir or cheap Xmas present then you have found the place. Also not a bad place to eat.
,,Awesome Food and Shopping Experience,4.0,,We took the Subway from Little India to China Town and had an amazing lunch at one of the TripAdvisor recommended joints.We also bought some clothes which we got fo a good bargain
,,Busy tourist trap,3.0,,"After visiting here to try and see the original Singapore I was disappointed. It really is just for tourists, the real traditional Singapore seems to have disappeared and is now a huge modern city with just a nod to tradition with this tourist inspired area, and not a true picture of historic Singapore I'd really hoped to see."
,,Perfect size and lots of souvenir shops,4.0,,"We visited twice, and had a nice time. We had a beer at the main restaurant in the center, and enjoyed people watching. We found cheap t-shirts and the like.

We did find a Chinese BBQ stand that was amazing. We bought three types of pork jerky and enjoyed for two days as snacks. The taste and quality were top notch."
,,Good to see,3.0,,Its colourful. But not much cheap. Shopkeepers donot bargain much. There are shops where the rates are 1 to 2 SD. No chance of bargaining. Not good quality. Easily accessible by MRT.
,,Super place to spend an afternoon,4.0,,"Although Singapore is easy to walk around get yourself to the Chinatown MRT and it brings you out in the heart of Chinatown itself.

You can't help but feel happy when you step out into a wonderful souvenir and clothes market, with lanterns up above you and some really nice architecture. There are terrific places to eat and sample the local delights.

Just a couple of minutes walk away is the Buddah Tooth Temple which is really worth a visit. It's free. Extremely opulent and if you're not quite dressed for a temple there are aprons you can borrow to cover your legs.

Closet by is Lau Pa Sat - a terrific food market but the real draw here is the satay which you can find outside. Chicken, beef and prawn skewers are delivered to your table fresh, there's plenty of options for size, but between two just go for option A there's more than enough!

Also close by on Ann Siang Hill and Club Street are a number bars and restaurants. A lot of the seats are street side and make a great place to meet a friend.

Visiting this part of Singapore was one of the highlights of the trip."
,,A Fizzer,2.0,,"Have been to many Chinatowns across asia, this was a poor example, many stalls are shut, cheap junk, with a few exceptions. The meal at lunchtime was terrible, wrong restaurant. there were some good stalls near the Indian Temple."
,,Fun and great souvenirs,5.0,,We went here our first afternoon in singapore. It is a very interesting place to visit. Lots of different souvenirs to buy at great prices. Definite must see.

,,Very interesting,5.0,,Our visit to Chinatown was part of a free city tour during our stay in Singapore. The visit was very interesting as well as being informative. Buildings and architecture are beautiful and as good as we have seen elsewhere.
,,Old Singapore,5.0,,"Having been first in Singapore in 1962 -and then 1973 this was more like the Singapore I was familiar with. Great stalls with a few bars interspersed with the occasional ""Tailors Shops"" where you can get Suits - Shirts and trousers ""Made to measure within 24 hours - and really the best of quality material. I got three shirts - Perfect...wish I got more.
We had lunch at a Tia Café which was lovely. A bottle of Tiger to wash it down - perfect!!"
,,Good for souvenirs and Chinese food,4.0,,"Best time to go to china town is in the evening. Many stalls selling souvenirs of all kinds a prices. There are also many jewelry shops, always bargain with them and don't take first prices. There are many tailor shops to make ladies and gents items. Once you go in to the shop they will try and upsell you to more expensive materials. They get you in the shop through you browsing the clothes hanging outside...so beware. The massage spas are excellent value compared to u.k. Prices. Look for trip advisor posters."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,Conservation of old buildings and the local Chinese food should be the main attraction here. Walk through the stalls slowly and have a feel of the culture here in the afternoon. Have great variety of local dishes available for dinner. Easily accessible by public transport
,,nick knacks,4.0,,"As the title suggests Chinatown is full of nick knack shops full of souvenirs and perfume. It is a great place to buy souvenirs and also to get a reasonably priced and hearty meal.
You can also get bargain jewelry if you are prepared to negotiate. My wife picked up a couple of bargains whilst we were there.
They also have tailors who will custom make articles of clothing for you as well as some amazing hand painted paintings and hand carved wooden souvenirs.
When you in Singapore take a wander through Chinatown you will find plenty of great eateries as well as pick up a bargain or two.
You can get there by bus from anywhere in Singapore and it only costs you $1.60 Singaporean dollars to get there."
,,The authentic China ambience,4.0,,"I've visited this place thinking it'd be same as Chinatown's at other cities but this is the one which give the real china ambience with the food kiosks , pagoda structured buildings , shopping streets etc. This area has good range if dine and wine options spread across which is a pro for traveller who would like to relax."
,,China town,5.0,,"Vibrant and friendly,lots of stalls,couple of shopping centres,good street food.A must see if you are going Singapore."
,,Great cheap food and cheap markets,4.0,,"Great place to visit, the markets were cheap and there was a lot of variety. Food street would be the best place to eat, get some famous chicken rice or chilli crab for under $10. Very easily accessible from the MRT. We needed a lot longer here than 2 hours as there is so much to see"
,,A cultural experience like China outside China,5.0,,"A fantastic place of food and shopping of Chinese culture. Delicious food at great prices, including singaporean chilli crab, ice cream sandwiches, durian and pork jerky. Teo chew, cantonese, Mandarin people."

,,Cheap shopping in nice & clean environment,5.0,,"As the name says, it's a paradise for cheap shopping & shoppers. Gift items are available for as low as S$1.00. This place is worth for souveniers & gift items as it will not burn hole in yr pockets & you will get quality products also. Food & drink options are also available. Area is very neat, clean, well maintained & connected with bus routes & MRT."
,,In singapore you have to go,4.0,,"The MRT takes you right there. We went to the chinatown food court, with its huge selection of food stalls. Suggest you go where the locals queue [ its obvious, but it so works here."
,,Good to walk through at night!,5.0,,"Check it out at night, good alleys, pubs, restaurants, and unexpected finds. Has a wide variety of cuisine, not just Chinese. Also a few out-doorsy bars."
,,GREAT PLACE TO VISIT,4.0,,"The best time to visit CHINA TOWN is after 5 pm. It really becomes lively in evening. Try the best of Singapore Cuisine on the Food Street. There are a number of shops for buying souvenirs. If you are going by MRT then take the exit towards Pagoda street and you will reach exactly in the middle of the activities . You also opt to visit China Town Heritage centre which is located near the MRT exit.
Budha Tooth relic temple is a short walk away from there on South Bridge Road."
,,"Lots to see, do, eat and buy.",5.0,,"Very busy place, a hustling bustling market place seeling everything from hand made suits to souvenirs. Great food too, a must see."
,,China town,4.0,,"This the place where one can see the old heritage of Singapore , the buildings are beautiful and the heritage is well protected. Very cheap shopping as compared to even mustafa. The place is well decorated with red lanterns and traditional dresses, food is very typical Chinese and bargain also"
,,Singapoer Trip 2016,5.0,,"Great place to shop, Peoples Park Complex. The hawker centre on the first floor across the road from Peoples Park is awesome, it runs along Smith St, there would have to be at least 800 stalls that sell every type of food you could want, all about SG$3:50 a plate and a beer about SG$6:30 a large bottle. Great place for lunch but a word of advice, remember where your table is because you can take ages to find it again."
,,Lively and colourful streets,4.0,,The streets are well lit up in the evenings making it quite lively and colourful. There are several eateries all around offering local cuisine are very affordable prices
,,Not worth a visit,2.0,,"If you have a busy schedule skip going there, Singapore has more interesting things to offer. Go to Chinatown in New York, San Francisco or Vancouver instead"
,,"Interesting street, great food",4.0,,"We spent a pleasant few hours here browsing in the shops. There is a real plurality of offerings, from generic tourist tat to antiques and hand-crafted items. It's a good place to while away a few hours browsing, but be sure to try the food in the hawker centre - it's amazing!"
,,A great place to visit,4.0,,Fantastic place to wander and shop and eat. We went late on a Friday night and it was buzzing. There were three of us and we ate at a local restaurant and then wandered through the market stalls. A great way to end a busy day in Singapore.
,,Shop & Eat,5.0,,"We loved Chinatown, seems everywhere we travel & visit the respective Chinatown's we find the friendliest people and great shopping at some of the best prices around. If you like to eat & travel than this should be on your itinerary."
,,Colourful taste of old singapore,4.0,,"Lots to see and do in this warren of alleys and market stalls. There are lots of stalls selling the same thing, but just as many selling unique items. Look for those bargains. Haggling a price isn't really embraced in this place, but there is always room for making polite suggestions as to an alternate price. I wouldn't recommend using any of the tailors/dressmakers, their prices are not cheap."
,,Souvenir shopping,4.0,,Where affordable souvenir and gift items you can buy. Some stalls are open at 9am. Be early to avoid crowding.
,,Fun but nothing exceptional,3.0,,"OK to visit but nothing extra exciting. Visited during Sunday, was quiet not much happening. Maybe better at other times."
,,China town,5.0,,"Had fun in china town. We went on a tour which took us to a Chinese medicine place, then a yum cha dinner, then for a tricshaw ride around china town (fun) then for a bum boat ride. The tour was great, but now we have to go back to see more. So much activity and the food options WOW, could probably spend a couple of days in China town alone."
,,Allo plenty of time,4.0,,"We stay in this area whenever in Singapore. It is always buzzing and plenty to see.....quite easy to just stroll around the area but plenty of public transport...lots of 'interesting' food places and many bargains to be had. A fairly safe area to stay we think as the place is always busy with people....
Great place for a stroll around but allow a few hours."
,,Just love looking round China Town.,5.0,,"We really like wandering round China town, so many bargains and lovely things to buy. Plenty of lovely places to eat at. We ate at China Sea Food(Ba Dao Guan) an open air eatery opposite China Heritage Centre? At night it comes alive with the lovely red lanterns which light up the streets. There is so much to see and do. You must visit."
,,Brag,3.0,,"The only reason you are there is to take a few picture of you ( and your party) to show your friends back home that you have been in Singapore Chinatown, and nothing else. As a tourists' spot, everything is overpriced."
,,Buy your goodies here!,3.0,,"SG had a good rain when I went to Chinatown. So most of the stores were closed but this is the best place to buy your souvenirs or ""pasalubong"". There were streetfoods as well but I was full already. Haha :D"
,,Not an exciting experience,3.0,,"Although we heard and read a lot about China town but when we visited it was not exciting. Basically not much clean place, a downtown offering cheap products. Rather at times fake products. If you are looking for the quality, it offers little. If you are looking for a downtown Chinese living experience then you can visit otherwise not."
,,great food,4.0,,"I would recommend coming here at night with friends. Grab some late night Chinese food and drinks under the red ballon lights. Very cool spot to hang out. I went during the day, and I felt an extreme amount of materialism and pressure to buy things.. not my style."
,,LOVED this place,5.0,,Great to wander around and so many food places that have great food. Lots of small stalls and cheap souvenirs. Great for a cheap day out if you have a family with children wishing to spend a dollar. No harassment for buying except maybe some of the food places.
,,Is like China with more class and better ambience,5.0,,"Beat chinatown ever. Great shopping, superb food, Buda tooth relic temple a must visit. Avoid the indian tailors, you get a better deal back home."
,,Cheap and aplenty,4.0,,"When buying souvenirs, this is one of the best place to get them. Prices can be haggled and sellers are willing to give you extra for free when buying in bulk. The small chinese food stalls provide good variety of snacks while shopping. Just dont go when its raining as most stalls are outdoor"
,,A good blend,4.0,,"~ People's Park Complex - A large gathering place for Chinese from China, lots of shops, money changers and authentic China food stalls. Very China oriented.
~ Cross the road, a tourist hub with streets full of stalls selling various souvenirs and eateries.
~ Clean, well organise and convenient. Busy street on a Sunday morning. Good atmosphere."
,,Food central,5.0,,"Food market is full of wonderful dishes and styles so many choice really!! Lots of touristy tat, and gadgets. But beware f it pours down like it day on one of days there, not much cover and streets get slightly flooded."
,,Buy nice items with cheaper price,4.0,,"I'm from India got little confused with the shop names,but we can buy many items with very. Cheap price"

,,Cheap and cheerful,3.0,,"You can get cheap tourist souvenirs here along with more up market material. However, you also get a little slice of China. The food was cheap and wholesome and the activities going on around the square a sight to behold. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Must see place,5.0,,"Though rebuilt some 30+ years ago, Chinatown still has the original Singapore feel to it with small stalls to find and haggle bargains. Easy access by SMRT, great food court."
,,"Been there so many times, it's overrated but still good",3.0,,"It's basically just shops. So if you want souvenirs, then this is the place to go. Other than souvenirs, there isn't a lot that I recommend. The Buddha Tooth Temple is a great place but I consider that a separate attraction. The food stalls are nice and I've had some good dumplings and popiah there. But I guess after going to other Chinatowns in other countries, just don't expect an authentic experience. So go here but I think you should expect a commercialized Chinatown here with souvenirs."
,,Don't bother. Smelly streets. Rude people.,1.0,,"Too crowded with loud people shoving you with no manners. The streets very hot too.

Food places are smelly and noisy. Dirty and oily too. People are rude and interested to sell you things at marked up prices. Go to Mustafa Centre at Little India if you want cheap and fixed price same items.

Go to Kampong Glam/Arab Street (more relaxed) or Little India (feel authentic) better."
,,Must See Place In Singapore,5.0,,People Must Visit Chines Temple in China Town and Must visit shopping place in China town. Very colorful shopping place.

,,Always loved Chinatown,4.0,,It is a very interesting place where you can buy souvenirs and stuff if you need to bring presents back home. You also can find very simple little place where to eat on the run during the day (Chinese food )
,,Only Vegetarian eating place in Chinatown..Good for Pure Vegetarians.,5.0,,"Though there are many only-vegetarians eateries in Little India, there is this place in China Town , Chan Chan Heng eating place , that serves organic only-veg food. The ambience is no frills, non AC, small tables, but the food is tasty and the best part is pure vegetarians who do not wish to eat in outlets serving both veg and non veg, this is a big relief.
Location: Temple Street, Chinatown,Singapore."
,,Bargains Galore !,4.0,,"We loved walking through Chinatown and made several visits while there. Great bargains, people and atmosphere !"
,,Must see,4.0,,"We went here for souvenirs shops,and bargains. Lots of stalls and lots of interesting things to buy to bring back home. Lots of Chinese restaurants,nice food."
,,Many eating options and small shops dotted around. Cleaner than most Chinatowns!,3.0,,"If only the Chinese market towns in China had a minimum hygiene of the Chinatown in Singapore, then they would be more pleasant places. A stroll down Chinatown revealed all he key elements of what people seek for in ""Chinatowns""- ie food, shops and many people trying to sell you things. This said, Singapore is a very clean place, and perhaps gone Chinatown area in Singapore is not as clean as the other areas in the city, however, compared to other Chinatowns, this place is good enough to sit outside and enjoy a meal!"
,,Chinatown delight,4.0,,"Been Chinatown every time I visit singapore, simply because it's architecture is stunning and it's a good place to relax and have a cheap beer and watch the world go by.
Food is good here also and if you like souvenir shopping then this is probably the best"
,,Must see in Singapore,4.0,,Big contrast between the skyscrapers in modern Singapore and this old market place where you find yourself thrown back in time;

,,Food week,4.0,,As a regular visiter to the last remaining part of Singapore's past un -developed itcus aways rewards experience abd ny visit was no exception
,,Chinatown - good for shopping and food,4.0,,"Singapore Chinatown is a good walking destination for shopping and food. (Lots of food located on Mosque street next door). The decor is nice, and it feels like most other Chinatowns you've been too. A couple of hours max is all you need; but worth a visit."
,,Chinatown ... ok but nothing special,3.0,,"I took the MRT to Chinatowm to see what it offered: not much IMO. There are many ""mom 'n pop"" shops and cafes as well as a mini-mall ... all dirty with trash strewn about in places not seen anywhere else by myself in the places I visited. Unless you have a fascination with all things Chinese, I'd save the stop for another place."
,,Some shopping chinese style,4.0,,"Visit if you fancy markets with cheap stuff, really nice places to eat local food with friendly people. you can also get a foot massage if you get tired or just hop on to one of the two wheels taxis.. Not very different than other china towns around the world."
,,Curious shopper,4.0,,Holidaying on a budget can feel a lil damp. But in a place like this makes you feel like you still have coin! It really feels like China here. I got my eye brows embroided here. Not a lot of english speakers. You can haggle anyone down. There are stealers or snatchers known in this area to just keep your belongings close to your body. I ate some yummy korean bbq here! Some cool souvenir stalls but not everything is of good quality so just becareful
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,"Second time to Singapore - first time for more than 24 hours - and can't believe that I considered NOT going to Chinatown. My only regret was that I was too full from dinner the night before and breakfast that day to eat. Such a cool experience. Definitely not good at bargaining - and I may have gotten ripped off a bit - but got some fun stuff. Don't miss it. And in my opinion, better than little India. But maybe that's because I've spent a lot of time in India recently and chinatown was a new experience for me."
,,Must visit for cheap Shopping,4.0,,"Cheap Shopping area with most of the Chinese products available with nice food court with tasty food. But at the end we can buy lot of cheap gifts, Chocolates etc here"
,,Energetic,4.0,,"Like any china town, people and things to buy everywhere! Good and more affordable restaurants over here with better drinking prices than in town."
,,Shopping,5.0,,Totally loved this place. Loads of Feng shui which I am really into. Awesome food places to eat. Very friendly people. This is a must do.
,,So much culture,4.0,,Lots of shopping for souvenirs. Traders are very helpful. good to sample the local cuisine. Bargains to be had if you haggle!
,,Lots to see and buy!,4.0,,"I enjoyed several hours just browsing the many shops and stalls of Chinatown. Besides entering and enjoying the various cultural aspects of the area , such as the temples, I was looking for gifts to take back for friends and family at home. The area is a treasure trove for,this. Quality is good, prices may be bargained for if you enjoy that, as I do, but are very reasonable anyway.
For a solo traveller like myself the sense of safety and cleanliness is especially Welcome, and this applies to all parts of the city I visited, not just Chimatown."
,,most historical place,5.0,,"this is ancient city.have more memorable place.china temple,buddha tooth relic temple and museum,hindu kovila shoping complex have"
,,Bargins galore,5.0,,Fantastic place for your souviners. A bit haggling is required for the best bargins.You can have a suit made in a few hours. Such a vibrant place to be .Everyone speaks English so there's know problems. Would definitely recommend a visit here.
,,Great area for eating and shopping.,4.0,,"Come out of the Chinatown MRT and you are thrown straight in to streets of shops, restaurants and street food court.It really comes alive at night and is a great place to walk, taking in the sights and smells ( the Durian fruit stall ! )
Bought some really reasonable pashminas."
,,Great bargins,4.0,,"A large area of markets stall accommodating for all your souvenir needs!! Don't forget to barter to get a great bargain.
There is also a large area with over 20 food vans that offer different combinations of Chinese food cooked in front of you. Free wifi in this area too! It's hard not to find something you'll enjoy. China town is a bustling little area with temples and historic areas within the china town district. Worth a visit or two or three (4 visits for us!)"
,,Window shopping,5.0,,For window shopping and innovative items one should visit china town and there is so much to look around and sensible buying.
,,Visit only if you've done the other touristy stuff,3.0,,"This is a place that offers decent street shopping. The products on sale or priced low, and further negotiable, but don't expect durability. Not a bad option for buying souvenirs though. Also a good idea to check out the chinese temples around the area.
If you're a vegetarian, stay away from the food court because the smell of sea-food and meat can get overwhelming."
,,"Shop, eat and experience China",4.0,,"The place is lined with shops of all kinds. The market street and food street are the two major streets to explore. You can shop all kinds of souvenirs, ornaments, dress etc. for very affordable prices here. Will be a good place to buy gifts for friends and family when you return from Singapore."
,,Something to do at night,4.0,,We went here during the day when it wasn't busy. Interesting to see how the market for the locals is bustling and filled with weird produce but the atmoshere on the street is probably more lively after dark.
,,Such a lovely place,5.0,,China town is the best place to buy Chinese items and we can feel the feeling of China especially on the streets. Very clean and very romantic. I went there with my friends at Chinese New Year time and I was really satisfied with my trip at the time. Will come back there again. Singapore is a nice place for visitors.
,,Fantastic way to spend a few hours,5.0,,"The colours and smells of Singapore are never more overwhelming than during a walk around Chinatown. Lots of stalls selling food, trinkets and treats... No self respecting tourist could go to Singapore and not enjoy Chinatown... Loved it!!!"
,,Rather small Chinatown,3.0,,"Compared to other mega cities on this planet, Singapore's Chinatown is rather small- but you find some good souvenirs and gifts at the different street stalls."
,,ok !! not that great,4.0,,i like the chines temple there . Things found in china town was ok not that impressive. I had an hour time to look around . Loved the architecture around that place then shopping. shopped few key chains and fridge magnet there .
,,Period visit,4.0,,Nice walk around the old china town buildings and sights. Shoo Piping and haggling is fun but be aware if the tailors holding your hand and not releasing until you go into their shop
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Interesting, vibrant and a nice place to slowly walk around and take in the ambience of the area. Lots of places to eat. I loved it."
,,Vibrant,4.0,,"We visited Chinatown and Little India in a day. Chinatown is vibrant, has many places to sit and have a drink/some food and has lots of things on offer: souvenirs, medicine, etc. You'll be right in the middle of it once you exit the MRT station."
,,Chinatown in Singapore,4.0,,"Must go place in SG. At night, it's so crowded with people. The presents are also plenty to choose. Let's feel the different styles of Chinatown!"
,,Life once a upon a time,4.0,,"I took a month off work and chance to take a walk down Chinatown. Although it is near my current residence, I seldom have the opportunity to stroll aimlessly around. Being a Singaporean, I'm so glad that the government have persevered this heritage so that foreigners and future generation have the chance to see part of the history of Singapore. I must say its has been well maintain!! Thumbs up."
,,Another Shopping Place in Singapore,4.0,,Singapore China Town just like other major city's china town. Here you can shopping variety of merchandise at good bargain price. Next to this place is Clark Quay and Singapore River. It is interesting to explore it.
,,basic local information,3.0,,"As a tourist info center, this place is pretty basic - it has several people there providing local information. (some of the info I was given was wrong.). I was surprised that Singapore's visitor center does not do bookings or inquires for you for any tour or hotel - they only provided basic information based on the maps and brochures they have. No other help was provided."
,,Average,3.0,,Nothing that special. Very similiar to other chinatowns. Good to buy cheap souvenirs. I recommend visiting the temples although women have to be dressed appropriately and be prepared to remove shoes.
,,Graham milne,5.0,,Very nice .When in Singapore China town is a must .Herbs .tiger balm .smells nice .NZ dollar about same.Market in China town very affordable.
,,Singapore is Asia and China,5.0,,"What can we say about a China town? Oh yes, this Chinatown is the cleanest of them all. It doesn't mean that those in other cities are not, but you can decide on it. The food obviously are excellent."
,,Worth a visit to Chinatown,4.0,,"Well worth a visit, its better to visit Mid to late morning as it gets very bust in the afternoon. Huge variety of merchandise for sale and at great prices. Don't be afraid to barter as it is just about expected and you can usually get some great bargins."
,,Holiday 2016,4.0,,Chinatown is full of restaurants but suggest you go to smith street where you can watch your dinner being cooked we went to universal foods and when again the next night it was that good and reasonably priced .If you wish a drink there are ladies that run up and taking drink orders and take them back to your Table
,,Nice but like all others,4.0,,"Once you have seen one Chinatown in Asia or even San Francisco or NYC for that matter you've seen them all. This one is nice and has a lot to offer, but pretty similar to all others around the world."
,,Great visit to China town,5.0,,"I have spent an afternoon in China town, it's great. You should try the Old Chang Kee there, foot massage and buying the sourvenirs in the streets.
Next to the China town is the Pagoda, it is really nice to visit.
You can enjoy the street foods in China Town centre and I like the Hainam Chicken rice the most"
,,Chinatown Singapore,4.0,,"It was extremely humid whilst we were there I would recommend going early and take plenty of water. We enjoyed walking through the market but like most markets they have the same things over and over again, worth the visit though"
,,good fun,4.0,,"went with a small tour, much safer and more information is given, great to check it out with the locals"
,,Good place to shop on budget,4.0,,We took a mrt from kitchner road to reach here and i believe within 150 dollars lots of shopping was done. A good place.
,,Not the biggest or best China town,3.0,,Thought it would be big but very small. Difficult to judge in a country that is mainly Chinese anyway with so much going on
,,Lots of food and souveniors,4.0,,"Bunches of food and cheap crappy souveniors. You can barter a little here at the stalls not restaurants. Worth a meal and a stop, generally very very crowded."
,,Fun for a look and shop,4.0,,"Caught the SMRT here. There are a few different exits, make sure you take the one you need. I did a bit of souvenir shopping, lots and lots of cheap trinkets to take home to share. My husband had a massage for $30 for 30 minutes while I looked around. Worth a visit; I could have stayed longer."
,,for tourists only!,2.0,,"An amusing, but overpriced area for tourists because as there are so many Chinese living here, why have a Chinatown? the answer is to cater for tourists."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"Every China Town is a mixture of atmosphere, but somewhat 'touristy'. China Town Singapore is no different. The place has a unique atmosphere and is reminiscent of days gone by. In a city of concrete, it is so lice to be beside a complex of two floor old buildings. The shops are touristy, but again very 'Singapore' and bargaining is encouraged!

Food is inexpensive and tasty. Not gourmet, but still good."
,,Lost its charm,4.0,,"Chinatown is over commercialise now with new eateries .Other than the wet market in the morning , the old style tim sum restaurants no longer exist , the charm of old shop houses has changed .After an hour walk ..I wondered when will I come back here again ."
,,A bit disappointing,1.0,,"Maybe because I went earlier on in the day, but nothing appeared to be open. Walked round the streets where all appeared to be was eating nooks which I was not particularly interested in as they were closed and I had recently had breakfast anyway. A bit tired and uninteresting really."
,,Interesting aerea,4.0,,it is nice to visit the big temple. Food is good and reasonable price. It is different to the modern city of Singapore.
,,A great visit of little China,4.0,,Great things to see. Good food and snacks. Good souvenirs. Worth a visit for food people and also to just simply tick off the list.
,,Try the food,5.0,,"Great shopping experience, but try the food available as really cheap and tasty. Lots of souvenirs and electronics."
,,Shop amd eat,5.0,,Best place for shopping and best palce to meet filipinos. Foods were at reasonable price.So far for me China town one of best place for food stalls.
,,What a buzz,5.0,,This part of Singapore buzzes with activity and is also very colourful too. Plenty to see and prices are pretty sharp too. No harm in negotiating a better price!
,,Many heritage buildings,5.0,,One can see many heritage restored buildings here. This is not far from Little India. Actually no place is far in Singapore!
,,great food,5.0,,"Bright lights, lots of look at and great food... Bustling with food markets, touristy bits and local delights it's a must see and do!"
,,Great fun,4.0,,"Go to Chinatown early evening, it is a lively spot, the food is good and varied, tiger beer here is much cheaper than other places. The clothing is very good value and definitely best place to do shopping, there is a lot of rubbish too mind. Most of the stall holders will take no for an answer, unlike little india"
,,Yes Chinatown,4.0,,"Visited a few Chinatowns in my live and have to say they are almost the same.
You find all kind of stuff you never thought you need and the prices make you think ""hell yeah"" few weeks or days later you forget about it or it broke.
But it's a nice experience and I'll still go for other Chinatowns.
Food was really good and it is a lot cheaper here compared to all Singapore.
The Buddha temple is nice to look at as it is in very good condition."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"What a great little hidden gem
We found was what we thought was China Town but the further we walked the more we discovered this place just went on and on the further we walked down little laneways street markets knik knack shops shopping centers its all here
You will need to allow a good afternoon to truly discover this place and leave yourself some time to re-hydrate as its hot work"
,,Nice people,5.0,,Have to be there chose good food and enjoy your time on free open space setting plan. Order what ever you see you will love it.
,,Mini Holiday,4.0,,"Last night we had a Chinatown walking tour, quite insightful but not super great. We ate at yum Cha which was quite ok., plenty of food shops to visit and eat as well as shopping"
,,Chinatown is slowly fading in popularity,3.0,,"In 2009, I enjoyed strolling through the market streets buying souvenirs from the standard trinkets to items of clothing. This trip, I am sad to say but the stores and outside stalls have changed hands. But the other more historical sites are still there..."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"This is a very easy Chinatown to find, right on mass transit.
There is a mall like area where you can find all of your favorite foods at an extremely reasonable price. We enjoyed the duck, and you don't want to miss Tiger Beer. The whole area is very walkable and like all of Singapore very clean. We had a very nice afternoon browsing all the shops and stalls."
,,Great Location For Food,4.0,,"Interesting location for Hawker type food, close to the Chinatown MRT. Good quality food from the restaurants and the vendors in the centre of Smith? Street. Lots of tacky souvenirs, but some useful items also. A few silk items, reasonably priced scarves and other clothing. Well worth a visit or two."
,,China town that is not Chinese at all,1.0,,This is a simple area that tries to attract tourists and only has to offer little shops and so-called authenticity. Really not worth to visit except when it is Chinese NY. Than the ambiance is Ok.
,,Cleanest Chinatown ever,5.0,,A place to visit. Just take MRT to chinatown and explore the streets. Food courts at Smith Street are recommendable. Chinese Temple and also a Hindu Temlple can be visited.
,,Evening in Chinatown,5.0,,"You might have seen many China town around the world - be in Malaysia or dubai but the one in Singapore has a real touch to it - the best in shopping especially jewellery - PoH Heng is one of the oldest jewellers in Singapore, Chinese foot reflexology is must when you are in Chinatown, Koi restaurant is great in serving lemon and aloe drink to release you from the tiredness , local food is great, Will be back soon!!"
,,China products all around,5.0,,"Chinatown is the key place for most tourists. Every country we go, we look for Chinatown because we like shopping and food. Shopping experience can be quite good due to low priced items...

This Chinatown in Singapore is centrally located with direct MRT access.

All stores are selling China products, many Chinese restaurants too. If you need authentic chinese food... This is a good place. They have many Dongbei restaurants ... But make sure you can take spicy food.

Many temples nearby, be it indian or Chinese. Can be a good cultural trip..."
,,Bargain Hunting,5.0,,Had heaps of fun exploring and eating here. Always a bargain to be had. A bustling experience worth the time but make sure you have a couple of spare hours
,,A must visit,5.0,,A visit to China town is always great. Good shopping and great food. Good place to tuck into a Singapore Chilli Crab and a large beer.
,,Alot of great food,4.0,,"Alot of nice food around here, not too cheap tho. But i think the quality here is as good as lau pa sat."
,,Worst market and the peoples.,1.0,,Chinatown is the worst market. Anything you buy from here is waste. It will be better if you will buy such thing from your local market. And the hookers and sellers has no idea how to deal with foreigners. They will even try to fight with you because they knew that you will not fight . If you will fight then you will be in bar. So be careful. Go to Chinatown only for enjoyment not for shopping.
,,Very ordinary no wow factor,2.0,,"We have been to many China towns in other countries. This was okay to visit but there was no wow factor and not really that interesting. We went around 11am, perhaps too early there was no atmosphere and shops were selling same stuff and nothing interest to entice us to mooch around. If you do not have time you won't have missed anything not visiting."
,,Shopping with street food,4.0,,"Cheap shopping place with many kind of street food with good test. Most of the tourists visited there,lots of things to see over here"
,,You need to experience this,5.0,,"We got a train right into the markets, i have now completed a cruise around Asia and the best meal I had was at these markets in one of the carts down the middle of the markets. The markets themselves are great for a good bargain"
,,There is a 2$ shop in china town,5.0,,Very good for shopping And souvenir shopping You need to have good bargaining skills A must visit place do catch red bus hippo
,,Get whatever you need,4.0,,"Chinatown area is very interesting. You can get around to see how the locals are, try out their food. This area also have quite a number of supermarket, but it also have the more traditional market. Must go in Singapore."
,,"Lovely, must do",4.0,,"Great to walk around, excellent shops with little knick-knacks, awesome atmosphere...a bit like 'this is how it should be'. Little india is also great. These are definitely two areas to visit when you are in singapore!"
,,a feast for the eyes,5.0,,"Very much enjoyed my visit - spent an early Sunday morning. Lots to see. Great for the souvenir shopper, Lovely Buddhist and Hindu temple in the neighborhood."
,,everything in here,4.0,,"who want gifts,foods,temples,hotels you must come to Chinatown you'll find these. แหล่งรวมทุกอย่าง ของฝากแต่ละร้านไม่ต่างกันมากเท่าไหร่ เดินได้ มีจุดท่องเที่ยวใกล้ๆเยอะ แต่หน้าร้อน ร้อนมากกกกกก"
,,Commercial but worth a visit to eat,4.0,,I guess it's the trappings of big cities that it's all about 'dollar'. Chinatown Singapore is no different as soon as you exit the MRT station everyone wants to sell you some tatty touristy stuff. It's busy and bustling generating quite a decent atmosphere plus it has 'Chinatown Food Street' so you won't go hungry. I'd go again if I came back to Singapore so would put it on your list of places to visit in Singapore
,,CHINATOWN!! the 2th place to visit in Singapore.,5.0,,"You have to put this place on your list, Here you can feel the Chinese influence on Singapore. Our most favorite is food street in this area, every evening a feast of foods! Chili crab, Oysters etc."
,,budget shopping,4.0,,Loving the sale here 👌 everything is cool. Just everything you need especially those on budget shopping ☺️ noodles and healthy restaurants are just everywhere. Some cool place to explore 😊
,,Good for cheap shopping,4.0,,Nice stalls and lots of good cheap offers. Very nice to walk around and have a look. Lots of good options for food at reasonable prices.
,,Old world,4.0,,"This China town has lots of atmosphere & is in great condition even though it is quite old . Many excellent restaurants , not only Chinese , Asian --also feels safe at any time of the day or night . Cultural centre of Singapore & we always visit this area whenever in Singapore"
,,Crowded but nice,3.0,,Crowded wth a lot of stuff seller stalls and foods but nice to explore. So many cheap things you can buy from this area.
,,China Town visiting old haunts,5.0,,"Been to China Town since 1974, my first visit to Singapore, its all renovated buildings now, looks good but lost its soul, still many attractions to be seen, Guan Jim temple and the Buddha tooth temple with the rooftop garden, walking around there all kinds of food to be eaten most Chinese, Wan Tan a noodle soup the staple of Chinese and all Singaporeans, Bak Kuateau, a beef soup with spices and condiments.
Poeples Park shopping and food courts, Heinrich the German eatery beside the road opposite to eat Bratwurst and Sauerkraut and brezels and backleberkaese ( kind of meatloaf) baked to perfection take away as wellThere are Indian Temples as well if you like to see them. Go there have fun and its not too expensive to eatand drink and buy souveniers and clothing"
,,Food and shopping,5.0,,"We visited Maxwells Market for lunch and experienced perhaps not 100% local environment but at least I suspect 95%. Food was good, inexpensive and as always the happy people serving ""their"" speciality cuisine.

The shopping is like any china town ""know your prices"" but interesting nonetheless."
,,Full of Colour and Interest,4.0,,Take the MRT to Chinatown and you come up in the middle of it. Clean toilets are located at this station. The streets are brightly decorated with red lanterns and a variety of shops ranging from cheap souvenirs to more expensive goods are located on either side. Food street has a good range of little cafes but for a more authentic experience visit the Hawker Centre. We were having a quick visit so cooled off with an ice cream concoction that contained coloured balls that popped in your mouth. Great fun for a four year old. Venture further from the main streets and visit the malls where the locals shop. Climb the steps to the bridge for great views. Also look up when walking to appreciate the architecture of the houses with brightly coloured shutters. Take the time to visit the Indian temple and also the magnificent Buddha Tooth Relic Temple.
,,The cleanest China Town all over the world,4.0,,Singapore China Town is the cleanest all over the world I've seen. Reasonable prices of food and souvenirs
,,"Clean and Safe, way to see Singapore and not get harassed!",4.0,,"China Town in Singapore is not like HK or KL etc. It is orderly and well laid out. The stalls/shops do not taut or try and harassed the foreign looking tourists. Prices are very reasonable. The hawkers stall stalls in the multi-storey complex is worth a visit rather than the pedestrian walking side lanes full of food places. The multi-storey hawker stalls have some of the most delicious local food and they are so cheap. The best claypot rice and grilled fish etc is in this hawker complex. There is another multi-storey complex where food stalls are only on the ground floor and that is near the OG complex. The better one is the multistorey where it is with all the malls and side lanes. You can eat like a king and taste lots of different dishes that locals like.

My favourite bak kuah shop is also here in china town. (grilled pork squares that are somewhat like pork jerky but much much nicer!!!).

The souvenirs and stalls are also pretty reasonable. The prices are tagged and on display. You know what you are paying before deciding to buy. In HK and KL and many other places with Chinatown, the prices MOVE up multiple folds once they take a look at you.

Just walking on top of the road (overhead bridge) and landscaped rest area, you get a nice photo shoot of a very pretty street and mingle with locals residents who are there just having night air.

There are a few complexes in close proximity for people who want to shop. Those into gold jewellery, there are quite a few shops nearby. Money changers, watch shops etc and even shoe cobbler!! You can have your shoes repaired or even threaded (ie sew by hand to repair) for a small fee!!"
,,Enjoy budget shopping,3.0,,This place is a budget shopper's delight. We bought a lot of souvenirs for our friends and relatives without causing a big hole in our pocket.
,,Colourful vibrant place to visit,3.0,,"Typical place for a Chinatown with multiple street vendors offering trinkets, snacks and service of all sorts. There are open dining areas with budget dishes and alcohol drinks for interested parties and cultural items for deco and clothing.
Nice place to wander around and window shop for entertainment but not to actually buy much."
,,Bustling Chinatown.. Authentic Chinese feel in SG,4.0,,"Chinatown is a must visit place in SG , to witness the traditional modern Chinese life .The place is well connected by MRT Chinatown station..and its the heart of attraction in SG for shopping lovers to buy Chinese items and souvenirs, fancy items.The street food restaurants around are superb to taste variety of dishes. The area is vibrant with tourists flocking to visit Bhudda Tooth relic Museum , and the Chinese Building alleys with Chinese Buidings. Chinatown offers a contrast experience in SG with traditional buildings Shops, and alleys that reflects the Chinese Style of life in SG. Hindu temple Sri Mahamaariamman Temple is located in the heart of the area. The alleys is filled with numerous shops offering visitors an endless shopping experience.There is a free Wi-fi everywhere around Chinatown. I had really a nice and pleasant experience in Chinatown , Singapre URA Gallery is near by , and Red Dot Museum is jus located Opp to to SG URA gallery. Chinatown offers thieving for trendy and classical visitors to ve a relaxed and enjoyable time."
,,Love Chinatown,5.0,,"It's so easy, go down one side and back up the other but don't forget to check out all the little side streets. Amazing food in many of these streets. We had some fantastic Peking Duck. Apart from the food and the Market, the buildings and architecture is fascinating. A Must visit for Singapore."
,,Lots of fun,4.0,,"Chinatown is a lot of fun, tourist trap but with some quality shops. Great place to buy souvenirs, clothing, quality items and antiques. Many cafes, some air conditioned, that have well priced food. Some of the shop owners are very hard sell while others are more laid back. Definitely a place to visit when in Singapore, very hot though, so take water, hats & sunscreen."
,,Interesting mixture of religions and food,4.0,,"Chinatown is a place worth visiting in Singapore. There are a wide varieties of food and a deep culture of the early immigrants in Singapore (Chinese and Indian). There are a few places worth visiting like the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, The Indian Temple and the Chinatown Heritage Centre. There are plenty of food to choose from and many souvenirs to buy as well."
,,"Chinese New Year in Chinatown, great!",4.0,,Great trip especially during this time of the year. The place was buzzing. Lots of invitations to same the food but we did some shopping and watched all the spectacle
,,Slightly Disappointed,3.0,,"Not sure what I was expecting but just found lots of stalls selling much the same stuff, some of it was nice but a lot of it was the same old tat. Would probably be more atmospheric in the evening."
,,Nicest Chinatown I've ever seen!,5.0,,"Awesome food stalls, very clean & nice atmosphere. Could spend a day there. I was fascinated by the many colours of the buildings."
,,Good Market shopping,4.0,,"Just down the road from our hotel so visited few times, very big place. Lots of shopping markets, cafes, bars etc. Found a good money changer. Loads of souvenirs. Lots of lanes of shopping. The Chinatown MRT station is right out the front and easy to get taxis to and from (which are very cheap)"
,,Lots of food and souvenir shopping,4.0,,Travellers have a lot of choice on a variety of available food. There is also quite arrange of shops to get some souvenirs
,,Good for cheap gifts,4.0,,"Do not miss a walk round China Town, there are lovely well priced gift stalls, also a couple of temples to visit, food and drink if you fancy a rest is also available"
,,Great place for cheap souvenirs,4.0,,"Chinatown is full of cheap little markets where you can grab a cheap souvenirs . I've been twice only for that reason . It's not overly large , a hour or two is enough time is see everything . Great central location"
,,Don't go there during Chinese New Year holiday,3.0,,"nearly all the shops are closed during Chinese New Year holidays, only a few restaurants remain open, but full of people."
,,Interesting to visit,3.0,,"Quite lots of Chinese style Building around you. You can shop there. There are lots of shop selling Chinese style things, India features goods. Lots of the shop selling scarf, T-Shirt, Singapore magnets, bags or etc. You can buy Singapore souvenirs there."
,,Great place to explore!,5.0,,"Chinatown was one of the neighborhoods my fiancé, friends and I explored on our first day in Singapore. Great place to eat and shop for souvenirs! Thoroughly enjoyed it."
,,Local theme,5.0,,This Chinese quarter not looks like any usual that I saw before in other countries. Here a lot of from SG and its people but at the same time a lot of from Chinese culture. Two words about this place - must visit! Even once!
,,A convenient place to shop,5.0,,I'd rather shop here than in other place. It has a straight walk at Pagoda Street and from the MRT exit until you meet the main road you can find many shops with affordable price! I guess it depends on what event is happening. I went here on August 2015 during SG independence day and the price for keychain is S$10 for 24 or 36 if I'm not mistaken. But on May 2016 visit I buy S$10 for 42!!!
,,An Interesting Experience,4.0,,"we made a point of stopping in China Town about lunch time so that we could discover and take part in this dining experience. With so many stall to choose from and so many different meals to select from, there is no way anyone could say that they could not find something to satisfy their hunger. A great Time was had by All."
,,Souvenirs and walk,2.0,,"A place you con go eat, but if you are tourist, this is a place where the food is not for us, I mean the places are not cozzys and looks like the food is not as tasty as other place. The souvenirs are kind of expensive, and not good souvenirs. If you want more cheap stuff go to the store far from the start."
,,Excellent place,5.0,,"The entire surrounding is a mix of new and old, you would find those small shops selling typical chinese stuff and just across the road you would also find stores inside malls which sell fancy gadgets. Lot of eateries available, however need to be cautious if you are particular about Halal food."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,Such a friendly way of spending time wandering through Chinatown. Met so many great locals willing to spend time and chat. Had a ball there!
,,Interesting place to explore and hunt for bargains,4.0,,"My hotel was situated quite close to Chinatown so I had to take a peek whilst on a recent business trip to Singapore. As to be expected there was a multitude of little stores selling almost everything under the sun. I was looking for a simple bag to carry my stuff around on my walking tour of the city - found one. Then I decided that I needed a power pack to recharge my Smartphone whilst on the move - found one. And then I discovered that I had forgotten my ear phones - found some. Now whether I paid too much for these items, I don't know (I'm hopeless at haggling), but I enjoyed the banter that goes with shopping in such places. I visited just after having enjoyed a big breakfast otherwise I would have been tempted to eat at one of the very many food stalls.

Of course I could have stocked up on Chinese medicine, clothes (probably not my size though) and a multitude of other things but I was on a mission to explore Singapore in a day. So armed with my new purchases I headed for the Singapore Mass Transit Rapid Transit system (SMRT) and got on with my essential sightseeing."
,,Cannot go wrong in any direction,5.0,,"One piece of advice: Come when starving! You'll want to eat your way around the streets.

It's also a good idea to come around dusk or just before, so you're there while the sun goes down and the lanterns light up. Lots of cheap and fun (although also plenty of tacky and crap) souvenirs around the streets stalls. Look for the cloth market stall near Yum Cha restaurant, it's got some nice pieces available."
,,Excellent,4.0,,This is one of the better China towns. Everything is so cheap! Food is top and the whole place buzzing. Spent a lot of time here and will high on list for return visits.
,,Interesting little stalls,4.0,,"Very busy when we visited, but has lots of little shops selling all kinds of chinese trinkets and food shops all over the place. Intresting place to have a walk around for a few hours."
,,if you like that sort of thing,4.0,,this is a functional and living cultural area that is enhanced by the money that tourism brings into it but degraded by the tat that serves the tourists. - within it are places to eat - foods to buy and a cultural heritage of medicine and tradition - the knack is finding a way to see it without ruining it by making it into a goggle box.
,,Fantastiv,5.0,,"Very vibrant, great shopping, easy access.you can bargain in most areas of China Townvery easy to get to with the MRT."
,,The cleanest Chinatown of all,5.0,,"Yes, it's true. Forget the shady, seedy chinatowns you may find around the world, this is so pristine you have the feeling it was built yeasterday."
,,Bit disappointing,3.0,,I somehow expected more. It's a great place to buy souvenirs and see a temple but not much else really.
,,"Great atmosphere, great food",5.0,,"No trip to Singapore should be complete with a trip to Chinatown for a meal. Find your way to the food street where fantastic delights await that you can enjoy at the communal tables along the sides and at various points in the middle. Trying to decide what to have will be your biggest issue. You will find sitting at the communal tables also allows you to meet other travellers or locals and learn more Chinatown and Singapore. A huge bowl of soup or other fantastic meal will cost you between $5 and $10 - what value! After you eat take a stroll through the souvenir shops, pubs, jewellery and electrical stores that fill the side streets. A great part of Singapore that shouldn't be missed."
,,Enjoyed,4.0,,"Enjoyed our visit here. Great place to buy many, many Singapore souvenirs. The prices are ok too for the kind of quality products you get there. Loved the varied collection. Good medicine shops. Many eateries. Will definitely visit here again on our next trip to Singapore. Better to leave the kids back though, they may not enjoy the small street walking or the crowd."
,,Hawker at night,4.0,,We went in Chinatown at night when it was already closing time. We did some shopping but we spent most of our time eating. We are looking for stalls selling Chili crab but our budget is limited so we passed eating the chili crab (crying..huhu..). Maybe not that special if compared to other places but I think still worth a visit especially if you want to buy souvenirs.
,,"Food stalls, souvenirs, restaurants",5.0,,"One stall after another, all selling similar items. Interesting at first, but once you've purchased what you want, this may get tedious. Having said that though, there is a wide selection from souvenirs, to jewelry, to clothing and perfume. So if you've come to shop for bargain items, this is the place.
Various restaurants selling Sechuan style food amongst other Chinese styles. Can also find the famous Chilli crab here.
There is a street of restaurants and food stalls selling a wide variety of dishes - I think this may be open from afternoon into the evening. Nice vibe and great food, all at better prices than can be found in the more formal restaurants or restaurants outside of Chinatown. Unlike Chinatowns in other cities across the world, this is clean and very well maintained"
,,Eat here,5.0,,"Lots of shops selling anything you can think of from a scrubbing brush to a Rolex. Eat at the pavement eateries like we did. Great food and very cheap, 2 bowls of ramen 8 dollars.
Bought 3 silk shirts for 60 dollars. great place to just wander around."
,,A bit disappointing,3.0,,"A lot of shops, restaurant but seems very commercial Interesting for Chinese Traditional medicine. A nice pagode you can visit Restaurants but for tourists"
,,Recomended for buy souvenir,5.0,,"This place is not so big, but you can buy some or much souvenir here about Singapore, the price is low and quality is not so bad. So if you want to leave Singapore, don't forget buy souvenir here."
,,Not that special,3.0,,"As the world has shrunk and visitors grow, this Chinatown is nothing special when compared with London , San Francisco etc."
,,Has it gone downhill?,3.0,,"During all of my past 7 visits to China town, I always had a good time. Something has changed in the past four years. It does not seem to be as vibrant as it was, the food hawkers have changed. To me some of the unique atmosphere has gone, I will not be back for another visit."
,,Must Visit,4.0,,"With Singapore being incredibly multicultural, China town and likewise Little India are places you must visit. With a lot to see and a lot of cheap souvenirs, food stalls and temples. Its well worth your time!"
,,Must visit market for shopping,4.0,,"Good market with cheap and quality products. Chinese culture, products and colourful decoration with food street are all characteristics of this town."
,,Flavours of China,4.0,,"Singapore offers multicultural environment and main races here are Chinese, Malay, Indian and Western apart from all races of the world.
Chinatown is the biggest and offers variety from China. Either its food, clothes, temples or anything. Much crowded many times but this one is one of the worlds best China town. Must visit if you are visiting Singapore for more than 2 days."
,,Back after 32 years,4.0,,"My wife and I visited Singapore's Chinatown this afternoon after a gap of 32 years.

Lovely to be back and be part of the hustle and bustle here. Even a heavy bout of rain did not dampen our spirits. The wife spent a couple of hours browsing around the many shops and bought a few items.

We also had lunch at Ba Dao Guan which specialises in Chinese seafood.

Chinatown is a ""must see"" for all tourists to the Lion City."
,,"Food stalls, souvenirs, restaurants",5.0,,"One stall after another, all selling similar items. Interesting at first, but once you've purchased what you want, this may get tedious. Having said that though, there is a wide selection from souvenirs, to jewelry, to clothing and perfume. So if you've come to shop for bargain items, this is the place.
Various restaurants selling Sechuan style food amongst other Chinese styles. Can also find the famous Chilli crab here.
There is a street of restaurants and food stalls selling a wide variety of dishes - I think this may be open from afternoon into the evening. Nice vibe and great food, all at better prices than can be found in the more formal restaurants or restaurants outside of Chinatown. Unlike Chinatowns in other cities across the world, this is clean and very well maintained"
,,Eat here,5.0,,"Lots of shops selling anything you can think of from a scrubbing brush to a Rolex. Eat at the pavement eateries like we did. Great food and very cheap, 2 bowls of ramen 8 dollars.

The food court is one of the best ones, must try the chicken rice.
It is also one of the best areas to go shopping for souvenirs. If you are looking for some basic and cheap souvenirs, this is the place. They have very good offers.
If you are looking for chinese food, there is a shopping centre with the best things just opposite the tube station."
,,Must visit place for affordable Chinese food,4.0,,"I had a nice experience exploring the area.
Solo travel was not a problem in Singapore, including in the Chinatown.
There were signage in every corner, helped me not to get lost.
They even had public wifi for visitors which was really help.
The highlights were foods and souvenir shops.
There were plenty of mouthwatering dishes which came with affordable price in the foodcourt and also some local restaurants.
I think they had the best (budget) Chinese food in town."
,,souvenir place,5.0,,"its one of the best place to buy souvenir to carry back home, reasonable rate and fixed rate , no bargaining required."
,,It's alright,3.0,,It's not essential you visit this location while in Singapore. It's bigger than china town in London and Toronto so if your looking for Chinese food it's clearly got lots of choice but other than that don't make this a priority for time if pushed in Singapore!

,,A pinch of Chinese market,4.0,,"Chinatown is a great place to experience the ambience of Chinese market. It was festive, quite crowded sometimes, yet the streets are very clean. It is a perfect place to buy simple souvenirs or even beautiful Chinese crafts. Just walk toward Pagoda Street from the MRT station and stroll along the stalls. This is a place I visit when I want to buy keychains. You can buy them in quite cheap price. I once spend 10 dollars for 42 rubber Merlion-shaped keychains."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Great shopping experience but you need to know how to barter, us europeans are not used to bartering. I started with quarter the price and took it from there!!

China town food halls or hawker stalls as they are known are a must to eat in. The food is cooked in front of you, fresh and the flavour wow!

Personally the food at the hawker stalls is far far superior to what we ate at restaurants on Clark Quay though without the canal view. That said give it a go you will not be disapointed."
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"No matter how many visits to Chinatown there is always something to excite every time. Something to buy, whether it's jewellery or having a suit made here is the place to come. It's noisy, hot, wall to wall people, but it's above all fun !"

,,shop cheap,5.0,,Ethnic stores that sale clothing and souvenirs at a very cheap prices. Also many places to eat local food and lot of juice to drink.
,,Shopping experience.,3.0,,We caught the train to the China Town Markets and it arrives right at the beginning of it. Its crowded and full of stores all selling much the same thing but do browse first as prices do vary for exactly the identical article. It is certainly much cheaper to shop there. A small walk away from the Market and you are in narrow little streets crowded with eateries some offering discounts to dine with them. A bit further away is the business part of China Town with the shopping malls and more expensive goods but the quality is also better.
,,Super,5.0,,I really liked it. There are loads of food stalls and clothes/ souvenir shopes. It's a tad bit crowed. The place is kept clean though and organised though (compared to others that I've been to) Nice chines restaurant on the corner near the underground. Loads of outdoor seating and prices are good too.
,,Love it!,4.0,,"Noisy, hot, loads of cheap tat but just wonderful. As close as you'll come to the real old Singapore. Some great places to eat and some great antique shops which are, however, pricey."
,,"""Bullcart Water"" literally, name of Chinatown Singapopre",5.0,,"The heart of commerce where modern Singapore started, the place where Chinese immigrants first settled when they came. Today, there are more China Chinese shops and restaurants and a place to taste many cheap & delicious local delights. This is a place to be during the Chinese New Year period (Jan - Feb every year), where you can buy Chinese food goodies and enjoy street decorations & lightnings to immense in the festive atmosphere. Don't miss the Buddha Relic Temple nearby when you are in Chinatown."
,,Great place to visit during your stay,4.0,,"Classic Chinatown experience. The People's Park complex is the typical Hawker Center. An enormous variety of ethnic foods feeding lots of locals. There are some shops on that side of the street as well. Crossing the bridge over New Bridge Road will bring you to an area packed with outdoor shops. The old style architecture and colorful sights are great for pictures. Several restaurants line the street. If you head south a few blocks to Smith Street you will find an upscale Hawker Center in the center of the road with restaurants on either side. Plenty of spots for outdoor seating. If you are in town around Chinese New Year, you must stop by. Make sure you bring your camera."
,,Busy,5.0,,This place is so busy people are everywhere shop owner trying to get you to buy from there shops. The food stalls are great night time is the best time to visit.
,,A Peek Into Old Singapore,3.0,,"If you like tradition, then visit Chinatown now because old Singapore is rapidly disappearing. It's a mix of quaint shops selling touristy stuff like souvenirs, Chinese medicine, trinkets and clothing. There are some excellent restaurants and great street fare to be enjoyed. Do not visit in the mornings or afternoons when the town lacks atmosphere. The place really comes alive after 6pm. Check out Smith St, Temple St and Pagoda St. For electronic goods, visit People's Park Centre and People's Park Complex. ."
,,Excellent food,5.0,,There is a pedestrian street in Chinatown that is just food. Definitely worth a visit. Lots of stalls with different Chinese foods. Very enjoyable.

,,Fun for an afternoon,5.0,,"Lots of vendors and lots to see, along with great street food and indoor restaurants make this a charming pace for a visit"
,,A touch of the past,4.0,,What I see about the place was China in not so modern setting. Most of the houses I guessed were preserved through times. The nice thing about the Chinatown in general was there were so many goods you could buy ranging from souvenirs to household amenities and decorations.
,,Best place for shop and eat,5.0,,"Need shopping and eat with cheap price? well the place is here. It's a must visit place every time I'm at Singapore. The souvenir is really cheap, mostly cost 1$-3$. you can have cheaper price if you buy in large quantities. They have many street food which is cost from 4$-10$ and it's really good. Try their carrot cake and also pork dishes. another advice, try to buy from India seller. Their price is more cheaper then other seller, but still good quality. Have a good shop and eat!"
,,Nice shopping street,4.0,,Good shopping street. Lot of 2 dollar shops to get your souvenirs. Can be visited for your shopping needs. Typical Chinese street with some food options too.
,,Best value market,5.0,,Great street market. Negotiate and buy your souvenirs here. Lunch on the first floor of the car park where the street food is amazing and literally cheap as chips only its noodles and rice. Get measured up for your suit at Eurobest. Visit the Temple.
,,Eh...mostly a souvenir area.,3.0,,"Although there are a few cool temples around, this is a generic Chinatown with mostly souvenir shops. I was hoping for a massage down there but it was hard to find reviews on a reputable place and it's dicey risking that in SE Asia.
There was a decent amount of food but way over priced. The rest of the city has way better prices. I also thought the food bland at the 2 places we ate, and we are adventurous."
,,Fun Place to Explore!,4.0,,"Tons of great restaurants and markets. You have to explore the markets for sure, lots of kitschy (but super fun) Chinese souvenirs, traditional herbal medicines, clothes, food, and more. There are a few temples in this area too that are worth exploring. Loved just walking down the vibrant streets."
,,Amazing food and culture,5.0,,We lunched at a local establishment on Chilly Crab and beer. It was affordable and awesome! Chinatown was hot and crowded with many tourist offerings. It was a vey interesting place. We visited several antique shops along the main street and made a small purchase. A fun and interesting place to visit.
,,Classic Singapore,5.0,,"Hustle and Bustle is not for everyone but then I would question why you're in Singapore :)

If you want to get a real feel for Singapore then Chinatown is worth exploring either for the shopping or tasting the local foods. I've long held the belief you can't die of starvation in Singapore, there is so many food stalls and markets available and pretty much catering for every budget. You can sip you Mango Lassi like a local or take in a 5 star restaurant for western style food.

Exploring the markets gives you a real taste and feel of the true Singapore lifestyle."
,,Souvenier haven,4.0,,Good place to shop for souvenirs and view the preserved Chinese architecture in the fast paced and westernized Singapore.
,,Larger than many Chinatown places in the world.,4.0,,"Lots and lots of shopping and food places here. Huge Chinese department store like Harrods but not 5 star. Herb floor, clothing floor, food floor, furniture floor, etc. There are grocery marts and numerous gift shop placed and tailors."

,,My favourite day in Singapore!,5.0,,"If you want to take a step back from the hustle and bustle of the city go no further than Chinatown!

We originally came here for lunch at the hawker stalls at Maxwell Road...which was delicious by the way but ended up stopping for a drink at an outdoor restaurant on Food Street. Needless to say between the atmosphere, the heat and most likely the alcohol we ended up staying for more hours than we'd like to admit! You won't find friendlier people anywhere else and it's the perfect place to spend an afternoon watching the world go by."
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,"Wasn't sure what to expect but we found we loved Chinatown! Such friendly people, so much to look at, and the food was great."
,,Interesting stroll around China Town,3.0,,"China town Singapore is not unlike many other China towns, i.e. Bangkok & KL. there is large number is stores and shop selling gifts for tourist. There is nothing particularly unique, although the old colonial architecture is interesting and it's worth a visit, also it's a short walk to club street for a drink."
,,Great food,5.0,,"We went here three times and it is very busy and very cheap.
Go up and down the streets and take a map in case you get lost.
Plenty of places to get food, we even found a vegan restaurant for my wife and she loved the food there."

,,Great place to people watch,5.0,,"There are lots of lovely old colonial style and Chinese shop houses to see. Plenty of places to eat and drink, without paying over the odds. There is a great atmosphere with plenty of bustle and market stalls to take your fancy"
,,Great place to wander,4.0,,Great place to wander around and spend the day digging through random things you probably don't need buy might buy. Be sure to buy one of the inexpensive chilled coconuts to drink (fun to watch them chop them open and the original 'coconut water' you pay much more for in a bottle).
,,Retail therapy in Chinatown,5.0,,"Spent a great afternoon here. Lots and lots of shops and stalls here selling everything , tailors who will make you a jacket or suit in a few hours bought a lovely silk Chinese style jacket very reasonably priced. Lots of souvenir type stalls and busy bars where you can have a beer and people watch loved it!!"
,,"Great place to visit, lovely people and fab food",5.0,,"The food in China Town is just lovely and very cheap.

,,not usual tourist market,4.0,,nice selection of gifts mixed with good selection of street food and restaurants to suit most pockets

,,poor,2.0,,"Toilet facilities are very poor in the area. The shops are all the same. Restaurant owners wouldn't allow us to sit inside the restaurant as we were only having drinks, and not having food. We expected to find more traditional variety within the shops."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"China town is excellent, everything from great food to a hand made 3 piece suit!! The smells the happy atmosphere the lanterns and all the crazy stalls are great!! Buy all your souvenirs here as its a lot cheaper!"

,,Real Chinatown in Singapore,4.0,,"I love to walking around this area. Buy things and eat things, haha. But now Chinatown is not safe like before, so many money pocket there, as my bad experience at MRT station, a pretty lady open my backpack use her pen. She thought i put my wallet or handphone there as many Singaporean did. But i still lucky anyway because i always put my wallet and handphone not there.

,,Bazaar in Singapore,4.0,,"You can get cheap local food and able to buy cheap stuff - clothing, bags, gifts and some items like key chains,tags etc... at very cheap pricing.

One of the place must visit for tourist to feel that they are in oriental country. The structure of the building is worth looking especially along Chinatown Market one can see HDB. Preserving old along side with Public Housing.

You can buy at a very cheap rate for everyone whom you have never given a Souvenir as gift. The food is also good as compared to the Clarke Quay street food market. Thai friend rice is what I would recommend and the Tiger beer.
,,Great culture part of the city,5.0,,Visited this part of the city I my first day out if 3. Its convenient location within the city makes it easy to get to.

,,Bustling!!,4.0,,"Our visit here was on a hot and steamy afternoon so the conditions were not all that pleasant to us. However, in spite of this, enjoyed our time spent browsing the various market stalls and relaxing with a couple of large Tiger Beers under the cover of vendor umbrellas in Smith Street. Bargaining for items is customary but most stalls / shops seem to have the same items at similar prices. We had a light snack in one of the various restaurants that abound in Smith Street but, unfortunately, their food wasn't anything to write home about as far as we were concerned - bit disappointing in fact. Sorry can't remember name of restaurant. But their Beer was cold and refreshing. We were sorry we ran out of time for a revisit. Next time!!"
,,The tooth relic temple and bargain goods,3.0,,In our tour the main attraction at the China Town was the Buddha tooth relic temple which was a very peaceful place in the middle of busy streets. The shops were mostly selling ornamental items which were providing good bargains for bulk purchases.

BONUS : IF YOUR A TIN TIN FAN THEY HAVE A TIN TIN MEMORABILIA STORE
,,A little piece of China in the middle of Singapore!,5.0,,"This area started out as a segregated area within Singapore, and the architecture, surrounded by the newer high rises, definitely tells that tale. Wander the shops, and be sure to go inside the shops and not just look at what's available on the streets. A wide variety of souvenirs and trinkets, but also many interesting art pieces and the like. Restaurants (although I didn't stop to eat). It can be crowded and it will be quite warm in the middle of the day. Be sure to take a tour of the museum."

,,Great for tourists!,4.0,,"While living in Singapore for 2 months I found myself here around 3 or 4 times, my visits ranging from a whole afternoon to just a short shop and then dinner. The streets here are packed with stall upon stall of novely items, jewellery, stationary, clothing and lots of stuff labelled 'I <3 Singapore'. This is a great place to come if you need to buy presents for anyone back home, or want some momentos for yourself. I was in Singapore for Chinese New Year- so evidently Chinatown reflected this, selling decorations, foods and EVERYTHING covered in Monkeys (as its the Year of the Monkey this lunar cycle).
Don't be afraid to barter at the stalls, but generally you'll only find yourself dropping a few dollars off at best. They're much more likely to give you a discount if you're buying multiple items.
After walking around you'll soon find that a lot of the stuff is in every shop you go to, but you will find some great treasures if you look for them. Make specific note of what you found in which store if you'd like to look around and come back later to buy- beause they all start to look very similar!
Chocolate here is cheap!! If you love chocolate, buy it for yourself here- because it's a bit expensive in the supermarkets! Found some great flavours of Cadbury chocolate that we don't have in Australia here and they were a great snack.
Food Street is the best for dinner. Ignore the resturants on the side. You can buy from one of many of the food stalls and all sit together on the communal tables."
,,Great for souveniers,4.0,,"I loved China town, because you get some really cheap souvenirs for your friends and family. Had some amazing Chinese food as well. Definitely worth going."
,,Easy to reach using MRT or various buses,5.0,,Great place to visit day or night and explore shopping outlets and the numerous food outlets. The range of hotels in the area is increasing Always worth a visit every time you come to Singapore
,,Worth A Visit,3.0,,"As chinatown is very near my office, we always come here for dinner at hawker centre above CK dept store or korean eateries resturants; or some basic needs shopping at chinatown point; or browse through the many travel agencies here if we need to shop for travel packages.

A famous old hindu temple & chinese temple, maxwell market with the famous tian tian chicken rice stall are all located here. The famous bbq pork ""lin chee yuan"" stall whereby you may need to queue for hours during cny period is also here. Needless to say, there are many typical ""china"" resturants here which we never go.

A few well known chinese pastry shops, which have been here for more than 40 years, are also located here.

Many massage palours & spas (straight? or gay?), backpackers & budget hotels are also here.

Chinatown is the busiest only during chinese new year period, or should I say... cny eve."
,,Good place to eat on budget,4.0,,"Singapore is very expensive. head to Chinatown if you want to eat for reasonable price. There are several food markets, where you can have a street dish for 1-2£."
,,Bustling matkey,4.0,,"Brilliant bustling market where you can shop for hours for all the tack you wish, make sure to haggle though and walk away if the price isn't right. Busy the Buddhist temple also, I didn't see it but a family member did and loved it. Maybe not for kids in the temple though."
,,Always a favorite,4.0,,"What is not to like from chinatown, friendly atmosphere, cheap products, great foods, and you have that Tintin Museum here. For a Tintin fans, you should go."
,,unique,5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is like no other Chinatown in any major city. It has restaurants, bargains, atmosphere, fortune tellers. Something for everyone. Just go and see for yourself"
,,Best place to buy giveaways,5.0,,Items here are cheaper compared to bugis junction. So if you plan to buy giveaways in bulk.. This is the place to be...! cheapest place also to eat ur meAls.
,,Best place to get gifts,5.0,,This is the best place to do your shopping to bring home a few gifts a lot of the shops and market stalls all have the same kind of stuff.
,,Great place for bargains and food,5.0,,I would highly recommend visiting here for cheap souvenirs. The food was excellent- visit the Smith Street Hawker stalls for excellent food (Chinese/Indian/Seafood etc). I went there most nights and a meal + a small tiger beer was around $10-15 at most! A must see location in Singapore
,,Interesting Place to visit,4.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore has a little bit of everything. Of course there are a lot of shops in a flea market type setting, but be sure you know what you are buying. Not only are there a lot of ""knock-offs"", but you can easily pay too much if you run across a good salesman. There are a couple of temples that are interesting. I visited early in the evening and there was a large group people doing line dances to American music (even a little country too). And if your venturous, there are plenty of eateries to enjoy."
,,Was great,5.0,,"More to look around than shopping so many food stalls def a must see, alot of allys to walk through and reasonably cheap"
,,Loved it!!,5.0,,"Only a few minutes on the mtr travel system from marina bay, this place was full of character, lots of markets and excellent places to eat, and cheaply compared to that of marina bay. People like all of Singapore were very friendly and accommodating. For smokers this area is a lot more relaxed about where one can smoke. The older generation were playing board games day and night anywhere really that had benches which added to the charisma of Chinatown."
,,Great place for a wander and Tooth Relic Temple visit,4.0,,"Loved it in Chinatown, old building fronts and many stalls selling everything you can think of. See seperate Tooth Relic review. Not to be missed"
,,Bargains galore,4.0,,"what a variety of stalls and restaurants all for you including a Rin Tin Tin shop. I love the fragrances of incense, perfume and fantastic food cooking. Its a pleasure to stay here too"
,,Chinese taste in Singapore,5.0,,Chinatown of Singapore is well organized. There are many sellers of foods and souvenirs. There is also a big Buddhist temple. The foods here are very Chinese.
,,Full of PRCs,2.0,,It's a place for foreigners esp PRCs. Accent of them were heard everywhere and they behave as if they own the place. Expats who first visited there thought Singaporeans were from China.. What a joke this place is...
,,Cheap stuffs for souvenirs,5.0,,"We came around 12 noon and the place is already bustling with shoppers but still spacious enough to look around. There are lots of shops offering varieties of souvenirs from gem stones to t-shirts, slippers, key chains, ref magnet, coasters, clothes and bags. Good quality T-shirts (Singapore print) are quite expensive ranging from 15 to 30 SGD. We noticed anything related to clothes are quite expensive while souvenirs like ref magnet, Chinese slippers, beverage coaster, etc… cost 3 for 10 SGD or 3 for 1 SGD depending on the type of product. There’s a shop near the Temple where they sell bags with Singapore design costing 5 pcs for 10 SGD; for most shops it cost 4 pcs for 10 SGD. I suggest to check all the shops first before buying souvenirs if you are on tight budget. Stall owners are nice and helpful. Luckily we didn't encounter owners pressing us to buy stuffs; they mostly stand there on the look out for any customers who requires assistance. As for the food, there are lots of stalls and we chose the one near the stairs. Delicious and cheap. Chicken noodles/rice cost around 4 or 5 SGD. They also give free soup and there’s fruit shakes to counter the heat. Definitely my place for buying souvenirs."
,,"Too smelly on a hot, humid day.",3.0,,"A lot of 'junky' souvenirs, and tons of stuff that you probably don't need. Interesting if you've NEVER seen a Chinatown in any major city. Quite crowded, I wouldn't eat here if I had to, a bit crowded. The best thing is a visit to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. Well worth the stop. Amazing workmanship. Easy on the hop on hop off bus."
,,An interesting place,4.0,,"The Chinatown is a very interesting place. It has a bazaar selling all sort of trinkets. Amomg the bazaar tents and stalls there are few interesting shops tucked away at the back. I happened to stumbled a Tintin shop. Selling figures, puzzles,keychains of Tintin. If you like walking and exploring, Chinatown is one of the place."
,,A must see for China Town,5.0,,I have been to the biggest China Town in Vancouver Canada and San Francisco but this China town has an identity of it's own. The streets and houses gives out the history of the place. Good for photographers.
,,A great place to visit,4.0,,We love strolling through China town. There are a great selection of restaurants for everyone throughout. Try the chilli crab given the chance. A cold bottle of Tiger beer whilst the ladies continue shopping is always a treat. We attended a cooking class here on this latest visit at Food Playground which is a must if you are even remotely interested in cooking.
,,"nice food, temple and shopping",4.0,,"nice place, good food and great massage, clean but very crowded, safe place and a lot of tourist, have clubs for drinking"
,,Chinatown....Average,3.0,,"This was a 'must do' on our trip, was happy we visited Chinatown but did not enjoy the stall owners persistent push for us to buy something."
,,A taste of China?!,5.0,,We loved China Town! Lots of fun souvenirs & good prices & some wonderful food courts & restaurants! Definitely worth a visit!
,,Cheap cheap cheap,5.0,,I like to shop alot most specially the stores beside the temple... Food is great most specially near the maxwel place...ohhhh the chicken rice is soooooòo good
,,Must visit,5.0,,"You're in for a sensory overload here - something to see, hear, touch and smell on every street! The open plan style shops are selling all kinds of tourist tat (magnets, luggage tags, learning chopsticks etc!) and the streets are decorated in colorful paper lanterns. Food street is definitely worth a visit too with plenty of options available."
,,Great place full of atmosphere,4.0,,Went there during the night. Great atmosphere with lots of food and good market stalls. Great for people watching and just taking in the city.
,,awesome evening and night view,4.0,,"previously, i visited chinatown during the day and it was hot and pack with people. This trip, i visit it during the late evening, it was beautiful. The lights in chinatown were vibrant and portraying the chinese culture. there were still a lot of people walking around getting souvenirs. This place is a good place to get souvenirs for friends."
,,Excellent Place for Tourist,5.0,,Excellent Place for Tourist. I was walking around and spent more than one hours. Nice location. Thanks.
,,great place for souvenirs,4.0,,it is around pagoda street . if you want to buy small souvenirs . highly recommended also there is a place that you can return with taxi .
,,A nice place by night,4.0,,"By comparison to many other cities this Chinatown is one of the larger ones, covering quite a big area with plenty of shops, restaurants, stalls & it's very own large shopping centre called Chinatown Point but that is not surprising judging by the large amount of shopping centres in the city! You can get everything here and best of all you just feel as safe walking here by night as you would basically everywhere in Singapore. And it's very clean, which I can't say from every Chinatown I have visited over the years. Bought some nice traditional Singaporean pastries called Tau Sar Piah in the Chinatown Point shopping centre at a traditional bakery called Thye Moh Chan (on level 1). They were very popular with Chinese friends back here in England and my wife, who is Chinese. So I guess they must be good (not my taste, though). They also have a branch in Orchard Road. A visit to Chinatown should be on your list when visiting Singapore."
,,Interesting,3.0,,Good to visit but in truth no different to many Chinese communities in the UK. Sights and sounds are much the same but a good place to try food.
,,Overcrowded,4.0,,"If you plan to visit Chinatown, be ready cause it's too crowded. Wear the simplest clothes to wear cause you'll be having lots of sweat while strolling around. Best value for souvenirs and street foods."
,,Always love a visit to Chinatown,5.0,,"I always visit Chinatown when in Singapore because I love the colour and vibrant atmosphere, even though it is always very hot there in the daytime.

This time we caught the MRT to Chinatown station and then exited into Pagoda Street which is lined with shops and stalls selling mainly souvenirs, clothing and bags. We then made our way to Smith Street (Food Street), however it was too early for lunch so we went on to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. I had visited before so we didn't linger for long before we went into Chinatown Point and stopped at their food court. Here we had a lovely refreshing Papaya juice.

After more wandering around the street stalls and purchasing some knick knacks for my grandsons we made our way back to the MRT. There's a little food place with just a few tables and stools outside on the left as you enter the MRT from Pagoda Street and we stopped for some barbeque pork and rice and barbeque chicken and rice and mango juices. The meal was good and very reasonably priced.

Although hot and very tired, we thoroughly enjoyed our time at Chinatown."
,,Very nice,4.0,,The many little streets are full of sellers of souvenirs and food. Plenty of tourist and characters in the area. It covers a fairly large area but spread around so don't forget to walk down the smaller streets to get to the next area. I felt safe there on my own.
,,Worth a Visit,5.0,,"A lot of shops and foods! So do not worry getting thirsty and hungry, everywhere you turn there are food shops or stalls. Just worry about what you wear (clothes and shoes), it should be comfortable."
,,Lots of bargains and yummy food,5.0,,China Town is a favorite place to visit while in Singapore. There are lots of bargains here from scarves to suitcases etc. We have also found that the money changers have a much better exchange rate in China town as well. It is easily excessable via the MRT train system. There are a lot of places to eat here as well.
,,A mix of old and new,5.0,,"Chinatown is a must visit specially at night when the area comes alive with wonderful street venders selling souvenirs and street food. Chinatown is rich in history with family run business and shops selling gold, medicine, textiles and dim sum restaurants."
,,World's best Chinatown?,5.0,,"Maybe you've visited one of those ghetto, dirty, but authentic-feeling Chinatowns. Maybe you've visited a shiny modern one. This one really has everything. There are blinging new parts, streets lined with restaurants connected by lanterns hanging overhead, grimy food courts, souvenir shops, and everything else you could possibly expect in a Chinatown. The People's Park food court serves some of the cheapest food in town and if you can stand the dirtiness you'll be rewarded with a great, cheap meal."
,,Good for souvenirs,5.0,,Great to see Chinatown and a wonderful place to get souvenirs. Also near at least 3 temples that are great to see.
,,Great for the hussle and bustle,4.0,,"Really worth a trip to China town, there are two temples a Hindu and a Buddha temple both are extremely interesting. Then you can shop in the street markets and eat at the food stalls"
,,Ok for one visit,3.0,,This is the older part of Singapore where there are still some traditional Chinese buildings preserved . There are a few houses with good architecture but this place is mainly for shopping food items and restaurants . Best way to have a quick visit is to hop on to the city tour bus.
,,Very busy,5.0,,"I first came there in 1986 and back then it was so different. Now it is busy and crowded, but I didn't mind. Great for an afternoon out to get a cheap feed and gifts for those back home."
,,place to stay and to buy souvenirs,4.0,,Chinatown offers many budget hotel for travelers and the surrounding also gives strong chinese feeling with many chinese food all around and many chinese-singapore souvenirs that you can buy for gifts to friends.
,,Beats San Francisco!,5.0,,I always thought San Francisco had the best Chinatown and boy was I wrong. This place is huge with a great collection of food and shopping
,,Old School amongst the Glitter of Glass and Steel,5.0,,"Nestled near the heart of Singapore City is Chinatown. Luckily is was mere minutes away for me from my hotel and so it was an immediate trip to Chinatown as soon as we dumped our luggage in the hotel room.

This was a business trip and I intended to maximize every spare minute between meetings to make the best of this stay. One of my top choices was Chinatown to include the Buddhist and Hindu temples located in the area.

We were dropped off at one of the main side streets near the Hindu temple entrance and made our way down the side street with the intent of getting some great Thai food we had heard about in this area. The rumor about great Thai was true and there are many more restos in this area that can be availed. The food we had was not cheap. At the very least I would consider the food here mid-range in price.

In addition to the many restos available, there are shopping stalls and specialty stores everywhere such as Tin Tin's. The shopping stalls sell just about every imaginable touristy item and nick nack you will find in South East Asia. The selections of cheap house fodder and trinkets are endless and all at fairly cheap prices.

If you look carefully, you can find some specialty shops that provide more interesting and costly works of art for your homes. It is worth taking a look in some of these places as I am sure you will find some amazing items or at the very least give you some ideas.

Chinatown is one of those places that requires a full day to explore properly and I would seriously consider a guided tour if you have the inclination for such things.

Of the two temples the Buddhist temple was a must see attraction. I showed up at the Hindu temple during one of their ""smash-bang"" ceremonies and was pretty much creeped out. More about that in a subsequent review.

I do like the old architecture still present in Chinatown and can just imagine from a few glimpses they are still a few secret areas to be discovered."
,,Here's a secret,5.0,,If you want to dine like Luke the locals and pay as a local them eat at Maxwell Streets food court. It's a fraction of the price and the most delicious food. In terms of price at quality it doesn't get better than this. Love this place
,,A busy and interesting area,5.0,,"Lots of market stalls, shops and a wet market all add to this interesting and cheap place to buy just about anything."
,,A look at the Singapore past before the boom .,5.0,,"The Singapore for the international businessman or foreign tourist is but a very small vignette of the city/state. Chinatown is more reflective of the real Singapore working class. Crowded, noisy, bustling with a working class population and the less affluent and aged. A place to visit ? YES! See how people work to improve their lot, the enterprlsing nature of the residents, the electric atmosphere of vendors competing to empty your wallet.
For shoppers, there are many bargains to be found, but you have to search for the good stuff, a lot of fun ! Not to be missed if you are touring.

P.S. The food is the real deal !! Don't be put off by the no frills atmosphere of the food courts, its real life."
,,Chinatown is a Must!,4.0,,My husband and I spent hours in Chinatown just hanging out. One of the best Chinatowns we have been to!
,,Not cheap anymore,3.0,,Had a nice meal but was shocked at the cost. China Town was a place you could good for a great cheap meal. It is not cheap anymore. Food was nice but I would rather spend the same amount of money in an airconditioned restaurant and eat my meal comfortably rather than being so hot and sweaty. Not worth it in my books especially when it was expensive.
,,"Food, food, food!",4.0,,"Some may come here for shopping, but we only bought our necessities -- pork floss treats to bring home from Fragrance and Bee Cheng Hiang! You may also visit The TinTin Store here, near Exit A. Also, there are never-ending choices for your food trip!"
,,Bustling Activity Galore!,4.0,,"I have been to China Town more that once and have enjoyed the experience thoroughly.
You can't tire of it.
I was lucky enough to visit during the Chinese New Year and the riot of color, food and activity is fantastic.
You can end your hectic visit with an inexpensive foot massage in one of the many massage parlors....Your feet will thank you."
,,Lively!,4.0,,I love the ambience of this place. It has been my favourite spot to stay everytime I'm in Singapore. Lots to do and lots to see!
,,Great for shopping,4.0,,I would say we did most of our shopping hear. Lots of good bargains and most likely the cheapest place to shop. Also some great food.
,,Very cultural decorated Buildings & Cheap Souvenir Shopping Center,3.0,,"I had high hopes for Chinatown, expecting to see thick Chinese-culture exposed everywhere. Well, it was, but only to a limited area after you go out from the MRT station.

After going out of the Station, you can see lots of souvenir shops selling very cheap accessories etc. and you can feel the ""Chinese"" atmosphere. But the area is not large, just along a street. it's said that after the market, buildings go like any other places in Singapore.

So I can't tell whether it's worth it to take a stop right here, unless you've got plenty of time to explore the entire country."
,,Cheap eats and souvenirs !,3.0,,"Spent 1-2 hours shopping here while on a Singapore trip in February. It is a good place to shop for cheap, novelty souvenirs and grab some snacks while experiencing some unique architecture."
,,"Busy, vibrant, full of culture",5.0,,"This was the most enjoyable area I visited whilst in Singapore. Lots of brilliant building, a vast array of street stalls and food, and rock bottom prices. Quite touristy, but not in a tacky way. Great for an explore."
,,Go there.,5.0,,"What a fantastic place to visit. Great bargains but do not pay the first quoted prices, the same as any markets any where in the world, but harder to discount. The hussle and bussle is so different to the rest of Singapore and some very basic but yummy food can be experienced. Take your time, about half a day, and enjoy the experience (avoid the tailors).
John and Chris"
,,Many stuffs interesting and amazing,5.0,,Food and souvenirs available here. Many interesting things and clean Street. Food is cool and u can try almost every famous food in Singapore from here. Worth trying
,,Cheap place to shop,5.0,,variety of things can be found here at very reasonable price. There are many chinese food stalls too.
,,Nothing much to see,2.0,,"There's nothing new to experience here. They have the heritage place which I find it okay. Streets with full of local Chinese restaurants and nearby they have a street that sells souvenirs as well. Well I'm not tempted to buy anything from there as I find it quite expensive. Overall, nothing much you can see there even though theres a few popular hostels are located there."
,,Nothing but food,2.0,,"Go if you are keen on trying the local cuisines, plenty of options on smith street, and a few in maxwell Center. Other than that only flee shops with shopping for souvenirs. Cheap tacky shopping. But the food is good. Good for an hour long trip."
,,Wanna buy Souvenirs - This is the Place to be!,4.0,,"We kept a visit to this place on the very first day and the last day of our visit to Singapore. First visit was only to buy tickets to Singapore attractions at discounted prices, which some of the travel shops at this place provide you with. The last visit was only and only to buy Souvenirs for friends and family.

You can easily spend about 4-5 hours shopping here. Have some Teh C (tea) at one of the shops. Visit the Tooth Relic Temple & Museum on your way where you can spend some relaxing time. The shopping area is quite lively and you can see some performances as well, if lucky! Try going for BULK DEALS. Like 3 pieces for 10$ instead of 4$ for each and like that. Don't worry about the BARGAIN - since the prices are same everywhere. It is just that you might get range of colors and patterns of the same items in other shops. Have fun shopping! :)"
,,Chinatown Singapore,5.0,,Another place not to be missed when visiting Singapore. It is just a short stroll away from Clarke Quay Mall. Chinatown is a great place to visit at night and you are spoilt for choice with the restaurants and shops
,,Shopping and eating options galore,3.0,,We visited pretty late in the evening so many places were closing but there were still many colourful stalls open selling affordable souvenirs and food stalls with reasonably priced meals. There is a huge variety of foods available in a beautifully preserved area of the city.
,,Wonderful place,4.0,,"It makes me feel that I am in China. I loved the food and the place. There were various stores, food outlets and the decorations were authentic."
,,Worth It.,5.0,,"Great area, right on the subway line. Good prices for food and take home gifts. Outdoor food court is great.Compare prices and haggle a lot you can find great deals."
,,"Busy, noisy and hot!",4.0,,It pays to wander around and try bargaining at some of the stalls. Some good food restaurants with a good range of choices.
,,Cleaniness Chinatown,5.0,,"Visited China town at night because it is cooler. There were quite a few temples, if you like to visit them. Some of them require you to remove your shoes. There is a Food Street with all kinds of food from Asia. Price is reasonable."

,,Definitely worth a visit,4.0,,Had a wander in Chinatowm as part of SIA hop on/off bus trip. Interesting sights (we elected not to visit the numerous temples but you could if you wanted too). Street food was nice (plenty of options) and cheap. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Crazy Shopping for anything you can imagine,5.0,,"Tailor made clothes? A portrait carved in rock? How about real Korean stone cookware? Chinatown in Singapore is a delight for darn near anything you can think of.
Reminding me of the old TV game show "" Let's make a deal "", if they don't have it, they'll find it."
,,probably the cleanest china town ever!,4.0,,"Singapore China town seems to be the cleanest China town I have seen so far. Anyway, it offers good traditional Chinese food but still very touristy with all the streat dealer."
,,Average Chinatown,3.0,,"Went there with my kids on the TRAM exit ""Chinatown"" Not big one.
The food there didn't seem very clean so I walked across the street and eaten at a mall.
3 floors, no waw deals, I got foot massage and got the H. OTA there.
C U AROUND"

,,I love china Town,4.0,,"Got here a bit late, but have been several times so I know what to expect. lots of tourist shops selling almost the same, fridge magnets keyrings tshirts and the typical Chinese clothing. But I like the street food, the little street bars, and there is a temple right at the end of china town. if you like Chinese street food head for the centre if its packed with local people then it must be good. Have a sample of the local food with a local Tiger beer, or Chinese tea."
,,Good souvenir shopping,3.0,,"We enjoyed Chinatown and did most of our souvenir shopping here. I've been here at night and it is better then. There is a shop on the right as you exit the MRT station (Exit A) where you can buy $1 bottles of water, cold and refreshing after shopping! Beware of the camera shops here. I was looking for a cheap lens and the first camera shop tried to sell me one for $550 then dropped his price down to $225 - I got the same lens for $89 elsewhere. Most of the shopowners were lovely and helpful and ready to bargain. Others not so much, even giving up a sale for the sake of a $1!!!"
,,Cheap and lively place,4.0,,"Lot of market place at Chinatown. Easy to access by metro. Cheap place to by materials from china, souveniers and that kind of stuff."
,,Traditional Chinatown,4.0,,A great place to visit if you are in Singapore. A more authentic and unique experience with real food and shopping and if you have time - make sure you drop into the heritage centre also. Worth going.
,,Love it...all!,5.0,,"But then again I like China town no matter the country. In Singapore also go to Little India, Holland village , Arab St, the Malaysian corner and the Philipino market....love Singapore."
,,"Clumsy, cheap stuff that you wont want",3.0,,Chinatown tries to give you flavor of China in Singapore. It has some eating places which are ok but shopping is strict no as it has cheap stuff which you may buy but wont find useful later on.
,,Pamper yourself in Chinatown!,5.0,,"From a 2 hour massage, to *threading*, to manicures to pedicures, to a facial, to laser treatment... to tattoos on your lips or eyebrows or just a retouch if needed you may pamper yourself all day if you wish! It is fabulous! Or have lunch and shop! Whatever you want in Chinatown you will find. Had a wonderful day of pampering and can't wait to go back!"

,,fun,5.0,,"No matter the weather or what else you have on your agenda, no visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to Chinatown. I always end up buying far more than I intend but that's half the fun. This time it was in a sudden flooding downpour but it certainly didn't dampen my fun. In the middle of Chinatown is the Heritage Centre - a must-see for those who like local history. Enjoy the food, the buying and the people of this area. I can't wait to go back for more!"
,,Singapore at its best.,5.0,,A must for food and a bit of shopping.Always busy at night and sometimes during the day.Atmosphere best at night.
,,Best place for real chinese food,5.0,,"This place was real china town 40 years back, then it become a local place to visit during chinese new year. But recent influx of china people here to work and as tourist, this place has transformed into a little bit of real china. The street food (which is totally safe to eat) sold are from mainland china, and all different parts of china, such as the duck neck, potato biscuits, cold dish, meat buns. And then there are the singapore popiah, kueh tu tu, muah jee... all nice tasting from my point of view.
But my favourite reason for visiting this place is to change money, the rates are the best so far, ask around shops and bargain to your best rate, don't change at the very first shop unless you are changing less than USD 100.
Lastly, the annual chinese new year decorations around feb every year is a must see. If you want to eat the real good and cheap local food, go to the food center on the second floor near the buddha tooth relic temple, it's where the local eat usual lunch as well."
,,If you love Chinese food...,3.0,,"Worth a visit, there are lots of restaurants and you can browse the market. If you think all markets are the same and you aren't fussed on Chinese food maybe not worth a visit."
,,Wish we had had more time,4.0,,Passed through China Town during a city tour just after Chinese New Year. The decorations were lovely. Only wish we had had time to wander around and sample the fare. Maybe the next time
,,Vibrant Chinatown,5.0,,"Each time I stop over in Singapore for a few days of shopping I always visit Chinatown for the delicious Chinese food and colourful shops that sell all kinds of souvenirs and clothing. There is a nice Chinese temple located in Chinatown (see attached pictures) and you can enter it for free. At the top of this building is a lovely orchid garden, while the other floors are museums which are also free to enter. There is also a Hindu temple nearby which is interesting to look at and I noticed tourists entering there as well."
,,Nice place,4.0,,I've been in China-Town a few times and I always enjoy it. Sure the things they sell is nothing special but the atmosphere is nice.
,,Good for shopping and foodies,5.0,,Great Chinese fare on offer and a lot of places to shop for trinkets in. I spent half a day roaming around here.
,,Good food and shopping,4.0,,A good place to just walk around - have a great variety of Asian food for all budgets and also to shop around.
,,Nothing special,3.0,,After being walking though the china town I have to say it was just ok due to tempel and the fact it was there :-) The main part seems to be souvenir - 3 for 10 - all over. There is also a foodmarket but we did not try it
,,Busy and buzzing,4.0,,"Decorations were still up from Chinese New Year, colorful. Lots of eateries, markets, etc. Like Chinatown in most cities"
,,Dr,3.0,,"Strangely enough for Chinatown, you do not enjoy as cheap a stuff as you think. True you get the usual Chinese rubbish cheaply but anything else can be more expensive than you think.
You do enjoy the usual Chinatown paraphernalia and food stalks but the shopping streets where their lined with stalls are usually the most busy area.
I understand the fake goods stalls are usually more prevalent in the night time but we went in the daytime so I am unable to comment on that aspect."
,,Colouful,5.0,,Wandered around on two shopping trips. Outside stalls all sell the usual tat. Don't venture inside the shops unless you actually want to buy something or you have absolutely no means of payment on you.
,,"More like a flea market than ""town""",4.0,,"Easy to get to via the underground. There are many shops and smaller stores and although it is like a ""flea market"" the shops are larger and more formal. Almost everything is sold from cheaper knock offs to genuine antique asian stuff. Some of the jewellery stores have some well priced and genuine stuff and you can find almost anything you are looking for. There are many food stalls and although we did not eat there, it all seemed quite well priced."
,,Colourful During the Chinese New Year,3.0,,We stayed in Singapore just before the Chinese New Year so all the shops were selling brightly coloured items and it was quite a spectacle. You are warned to mind your wallet/purse but the area felt very safe. The many stall holder vied for your attention and business. Worth a short visit.
,,Chinatown- Simply Stunning.,5.0,,We visited Chinatown just after Chinese New Year to enjoy some of the sights and the culture. The history and the architecture makes this a must-see in Singapore. Please dress appropriately if you go inside the temples.
,,Average visit in singapore,3.0,,The place is good but nothing special in chinatown. You will find only things for Chinese people but to have a walk to discover the culture is nice. in bugis street you will find more things to buy and good price.
,,busy place,4.0,,"China town anywhere is usually very good, but Chinatown Singapore I think has that little bit more, Seafood on the corner is very good and reasonably prices depending on your choice that is and the tiger beer is cold, The markets stalls cater for all your trinket needs and haggling is required for a good bargain but remember to be respectful on how hard you go at it, I have had some rather bad stink eyes from stall owners we I went to low. cafes and food stalls are very clean and never get sick from the food. China town is easy to get to on the MRT as well, For an option go over the other sise of the main road across the walkover bridge or through the train station to another world that most people do not see, good shops and food stalls, in the shops there are a lot of stores for eye brows, facials and petty cure ETC. OG is the main department store there as well, TAKE A LOOK its free."
,,It has it's own natural beauty,4.0,,"You can arrive Chinatown by taking the subway Lots of colorful lanterns and eat out places The best place for hawker,s food with tofu,fish balls,BBQ pork and won ton in People,s Square"
,,Free cultural lesson?,4.0,,"Yes, the shophouse was the way many Singaporeans lived in the Colonial era. And yes, much of the streetside food is from the good old days. Its free to walk around and see the color and souvenirs. And to visit Peoples Park that has many good buys and is essentially unchanged since the 1960's? It's always bustling as many local Chinese still frequent the place, the Indians visit the Indian temple on South Bridge Road, and Muslims still pray at the mosque almost next door. Religious and racial respect and harmony at its best!
Only the relic tooth temple is very new and both tourists and scientists says it does not look like a human tooth! I've never been inside."
,,Busy but fun,4.0,,If you are in Singapore this is a must do. Busy in the evening but adds to the atmosphere. Lots of cheap stuff for sale and eating at one of the street hawkers has to be an experienced. Just walk about and enjoy . We got a taxi from our hotel and back. Other ways to get there but this was easy and hassle free.
,,Low cost More value,4.0,,"Walking along the streets of Chinatown was an experience of all manner of sights and sounds, andgood food. This is a place to go if you are looking to find hidden gems."
,,China Town with it's nice buzz!,5.0,,"Look for a small family run restaurant called Sawasdee, 34 Pagoda Straat; they serve AWESOME Asian food and cold beer."
,,Guess you need to have it on the list,3.0,,Well it's a spot full of tourists and every other store offers the typical souvenirs. Go to the temple and the information center to explore a bit of the history of this place.
,,little china in SG,4.0,,its a little china inside SG. good for shopping lovers. u can get the food and souvenir from here in good price. can easily reach here by MRT.
,,Thumbs Up!!,5.0,,What a great way to spend the morning and early afternoon. Take a look into a guided tour. We chose Wei (indiesingapore) and we were left with a greater appreciation for this area and a want to head back later in out stay to take a deeper look into the suggested tips Wei gave us. Lots of great local AUTHENTIC food here and tons of shopping too.
,,Beautiful and colourful,5.0,,"We did a tour of china town with buffalo tours and had a dinner with the tour. Excellent place, clean and very friendly people. Loved it here and would love to come back soon"
,,Amazing time!,5.0,,"Total immersion into Singapore-style Chinese culture. Fantastic food, culture, affordable shopping and hotels, and everything within walking distance. Don't miss it when visiting Singapore!"
,,Organized chaos!! Quite an experience for window shopping and hawker food!,4.0,,"Visited this place after a very long gap.
It is better than before!!
There are lots of lanes and by-lanes to discover and cover!
Good place to by in-expensive mementos

Finally, select a good place where you can rest (from the walk) and sample the famous Hawker street food at the FOOD STREET!"
,,"Cheapest food and drink in the city centre, lots of hustle and bustle",4.0,,"Great place to sit and watch the world go by, it has the cheapest beer I saw in Singapore, the food is cheap to but mostly genuine Chinese (no surprise!)."
,,A great contrast to much of Singapore,4.0,,China Town retains a very distinct character in what can otherwise be a rather sterile shopping city. There are plenty of old shops and a few new ones that are great for a browse and a bargain. It's easy to get to by either bus or MRT and well worth a visit to see a different side to Singapore.
,,Live some of the history and local lifestyles of Singapore,4.0,,"Busy, noisy, colourful and involving. Chinatown is a number of streets with shops, market stalls, food hawkers and trinket sellers. You will also find some spots of history including some early temples. Live crabs, fish and other such foods are on show to tempt you as well as wonderfully coloured silk clothing.
There are a wide variety of Chinese descendants to be found here with some interesting historical pointers. Keep your eyes peeled.
Worth a visit both during the day and in the evening. The difference is amazing."
,,Great to wander and catch a bite to eat,4.0,,"We visited Chinatown just as the Chinese new Year celebrations were about to get underway. It was packed, hectic, and a great place to spend an hour or so. Plenty of eating places, plenty of colour, plenty of people. With so many people we were advised by our hotel to keep an eye on our bags / pockets, but the area felt safe enough. The local hop-on, hop-off bus will drop you off close by and it's certainly worth getting off to explore the area properly."
,,buyer beware,2.0,,"we were walking through china town,and being a photography nut i cant help looking in photo shops,first mistake!
a guy came to talk to me and asked me to look at a certain product,ok second mistake.
the out come was i purchased a wide angle converter for my dslr.
the sales person talked the talk and sounded respectable,he could certainly sell!
i now own a completely useless piece of equipment,which needs a lot of image manipulation in photoshop to be anywhere near acceptable.
so as i say, buyer beware and do your homework before entering one of these shops and know what you whant"
,,Old walls behind the souvenir shops,4.0,,"Yes, it became very , very commercial. It's disapponting for thos who look for a real scent of the colonial past and the architectural thrill. All the beauty of the area is covered with t-shirst and all kinds of other souvenirs. Sometimes the stalls in front of tha houses are so large on both sides you can barely pass through. The owner of the shops invite you visit the inside. It's crowded.The restaurants look also very touristy vith very colourfull menus where meat is more red than ever. But in spite of this commercial aspect, it is stil a Chinatown or wht's left. So you have to go there like to Little India."
,,Cheap finds (in SG standard),3.0,,"The place is pretty safe but just like in any other place always be wary of your wallets and valuables. Shop for souvenirs ranging from 3pcs for SG$5 or 10. Don't settle for the first store. Always ask as there might be other stores that offer the same item for cheaper price. We bought key chains for SG$1 each only to find another store that sells 42pcs of keychain for SG$10! Oh, the place can be a bit muddy when it rains."
,,A neat and interesting Chinatown,4.0,,"We really enjoyed our multiple visits to Chinatown. There is a real diversity here- in food, shopping and people. I don't think you can go wrong with the restaurants- everything was great and reasonably priced. Worth the visit"

,,"Eat, eat, buy suveniers",5.0,,besides Little india and Arab street this is one of the cheap parts of Singapore. Chinatown as others.
,,Foods and foods,5.0,,"Our hotel is located very close to Chinatown where we can walk about 10 minutes or 1 station by train. There are so many local foods where you can choose there. Highly recommend street foods. The price are little expensive but we like all the favors. There is the local markets near by where we were quite enjoy buying some souvenirs and there are so many options. The white bag with different design of Singapore prints are very great quality and it's just 2 dollars each woww, I bought about 10 bags. Highly recommend this place."
,,Cheap food and souvenir shopping,5.0,,"Apart from temples, Chinatown is the best place to taste the street food of Singapore, with lots of stalls. Also it is the best place to shop for souvenirs like keychains, magnets, T shirts. The more you buy the cheaper it gets."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,Stayed in Chinatown. So much happening in this little pocket. Walk and experience the uniqueness that is Singapore's Chinatown
,,Good for an evening walk,4.0,,An MRT is situated right in the centre of the town. Good place to walk around with lots of chinese food options available.

,,Bubbly and full of life,5.0,,"We went to Chinatown to buy some souvenirs and get some delicious food as well, we were lucky as Chinese New Year was a few weeks away so they had lots of beautiful decorations and everything looked red, red,red and so colourful. It was a hive of activity, the atmosphere great, food dirt cheap along the food market strip."

,,souvenirs,4.0,,"Whenever we want to look for a cheap place to eat, then Chinatown is the place. We ordered Singapore chili crab and it never let us down. There is also a lot of cheap souvenirs like keychains, bags and other items. Walk a lot and be surprised."
,,as you would expect,4.0,,This is an authentic China Town given that it is in the heart of Singapore. It is frenetic to say the least. We visited just before Chinese new year so witnessed lots of fabulous displays going up. If you want to try local food this is the place to be although I have to say it wasn't for me!
,,Great bargains,4.0,,If you are looking for typical touristy items then this is the place to be. Loads of shopping options and dining areas are available as well along with traditional reflexology massage parlors.

,,tons to look at,4.0,,"be prepared to walk... a lot! you end up going from one street to the next to the next, then down a lane. I lost track of how many blocks we ended up walking, but found so many interesting things to look at"
,,Get down there.,5.0,,"From Chilli Crab to Souvenirs and Shopping Centres, Chinatown has it all. Ate the best Chilli Crab at Chinatown Seafood Restaurant. Then also went back another night for Satays at Newton's Satay. Also bought the majority of our Souvenirs here."
,,nice experience n shopping,5.0,,"It was a nice experiencev with China town .specify the food ,and shopping.many Asian flavour good and many tourists."
,,A must see when visiting Singapire,4.0,,With an abundance of stalls and food cafes Chinatown is an interesting and fun place to shop. The shopkeepers are friendly and helpful without pressuring you to buy. I bought my granddaughter a lovely Chinese dress with matching slippers while my friend founds lots of reasonably priced teashirts and Chinese dressing gowns.
,,Free wifi!,5.0,,"Coming from Europe I was not expecting that free wifi is not standard in Singapore. We stayed at Hard Rock Hotel Sentosa, which was charging 34 SGD for a day of wifi surfing! And in Chinatown wifi is free. Yes, you have to register, but it is very convenient. We spent all morning here and enjoyed Chinatown a lot!"
,,China town Singapore,5.0,,"Very easy to get to, bus etc or just walk The food stalls are great, and you can watch your food being cooked, very cheap Interesting shops if a bit samey ! We felt safe walking around unlike a few other countries"
,,"Losing The Taste, Expensive Food and Crowded",3.0,,"The heading says it all
Singapore Chinatown is losing its culture, you wont find cheap food there and it is overcrowded by foreigners especially national from China!

There is a hawker centre at ground floor and retail shops located at level 2 onwards.

Some stalls are still run by locals but many are runned by China National. In which is pretty common in Singapore now as less locals want to work as hawker due to long working hours!

The air conditioned shopping centre called People's Park (珍珠方) is also famous for overpriced goods. Bargain hard if you are buying!

Overall, I do not go there often but if I did, I must buy the spicy pig ears from the china stall and also the fruit / juicy stall, is super GOOD!!"
,,Very clean,5.0,,"Very clean and well maintained. Lots of authentic food. Good bargains. Clothes, jewellery and Chinese souvineers"

,,Good Food & Bargain Shopping,4.0,,"Great variety of food at Smith Street hawker centre, delicious& affordable, the dry beef and tendon noodles are exceptional good so is the Yong Tau Foo Go before the lunch time crowd as there will be long queues.Another good place to eat is the old Peoples Park hawker centre for Toh Kee roast duck,charsiew and roast pork-much enjoy. They also have a shop next door pau, egg tarts,*dim sum which you can bring home. Upstairs at Peoples Park are bargain shopping,knick knacks, clothes,&just about everything ...Have fun shopping to your heart's delight"
,,Very busy,4.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is throbbing with vendors and tourists so is a very busy place, selling all manor of arts and crafts, clothing and souvenirs. It has some very cheap restaurants as well as fast food outlets.
You need to be wary of pickpockets who operate in the area."
,,Dissapointing,3.0,,"Having travelled to many Asian countries was disappointed the the Chinatown in Singapore, not the same atmosphere & not a lot of fake goods that you normally find in Chinatowns across Asia"
,,This is a really great place to explore,4.0,,"Chinatown is a really great place to explore. It has something for everyone; history, architecture, shopping and amazing food (probably the best hawker center in Singapore). The only downside is that more than half the market is full of tourist rubbish."
,,Shop 'til you drop,5.0,,"A visit to china town is worth doing. It could take the best part of a day. The are many temples and not a surprise a very large market, full of electrical goods toys, nick-nacks, materials, food, everything!"
,,Cultural Experience,4.0,,"Comes alive at night. Busy and exciting. Lots of places to eat, Western, Chinese, Indian and many other Asian flavours. Shopping is also good. Well worth a visit."
,,Chinatown in Singapore,5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is a great place to lose a few hours enjoying the shops and food around the area - fabulous afternoon and totally enjoyed my time there. A must to see while in Singapore.

,,"Cheap souvenirs, no more no less",3.0,,"If you are in need for souvenirs you should stop at Chinatown and fulfill your needs for 1-2 SGD per item. Other than that, not too much more to see."
,,Fun shopping and interesting bargains...,5.0,,We had a great time shopping for treasures and talking to the vendors. There are some very interesting finds to be had...
,,Great atmosphere and food,5.0,,"I really enjoyed the walk through Chinatown. It has history, interesting building and the smell of food is fantastic."
,,Great atmosphete,5.0,,Superb for buying cheap souvenirs. Just to savour the atmosphere is well worth a visit. Just wander taking it all in.
,,Touristy food street,4.0,,"The food street in Chinatown along Smith Street seems poised to catch the tourist dollar. Expensive rents coupled with its touristy decor have resulted in unauthentic and mediocre food offered at high prices. As a result, the majority of its customers are tourists who know no better. Locals who know their street food know where to find the authentic stuff: at the Maxwell Food Centre diagonally across from the Buddha Tooth Temple. Tian Tian Chicken Rice, Sunto Gyoza (meat dumplings) and Tapioca Balls are just some of the good stuff found there."
,,Very atmospheric,4.0,,Great to walk through with lots of excellent things to buy ( better than the usual market rubbish) and numerous temples to visit enroute. Colourful and atmospheric.
,,Touristy but fun,5.0,,"I did not find any good shops or restaurant here, but I enjoys the hawker places around here. A real thing!!"

,,WONDERFUL ECCLETIC CHINATOWN,5.0,,"We have been here before but came back again to visit the Buddhist temple. This is an enormous hustling and bustling area full of wonderful colours. The shops sells some of the best Chinese chopsticks, bowls and souvenirs outside of China. But the highlight is the temple which stands serene among the crowds."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"You can find all kinds of thing in chinatown, try bargaining before you decide to buy. Lots of good street food. Must try."
,,Chinese New Year preparations were in full force!,4.0,,"Busy, hot ,lots to see and smell- good place to eat if you aren't too fussy and A grade hygiene- lots of stuff you wouldn't see in western countries. Quite touristy but some good bargains to be had and some lovely school children doing a tourism survey who seemed surprised it was our 5th visit"
,,Best Chinatown in the World,5.0,,"So full of heritage and tradition preserved in this time capsule. Definitely worth your time there. Plan half to most of a day so you can explore it. This Chinatown is not just a few streets, it is like a couple of dozen blocks! So good."
,,Chinatown to top them all,5.0,,"We always like to visit the Chinatown area in a city but usually disappointed - Singapore's though is lovely - stunning buildings, fabulous colours and lots of great eateries - western as well as Asian. Fabulous area to wonder around and great area to stay."
,,hustle and bustle on a hot and humid day,3.0,,"Lots of shops selling cheap Chinese novelties and lots of restaurants of varying price and quality We stopped off here when we were on a bus tour and found it very busy, hot and humid. Not the best China Town we have visited"

We had a meal at a restaurant which was amazing food followed by free.time.for a wander round and shopping then a trys haw ride.through the china town streets onwards to the river for a bumboat tour of the harbour and to see the Merlion.

All excellent. Trip booked via viator and was excellent"
,,Overrated,2.0,,"This might just be the cleanest Chinatown in the world, and to me, that is probably the only strength of Singapore's Chinatown. This is a place ""artificially created"" for tourists. Singapore's population is predominantly Chinese, and you can find Chinese people, Chinese food and Chinese goods everywhere in Singapore. So why is there a Chinatown then? You can get better Chinese food elsewhere."
,,Cute Chinatown,4.0,,"Having been to Beijing, as well as Chinatown in NYC & Honolulu I wasn't super impressed, but I still thought it was a cute place. Great place to walk around and people watch. Had lunch here which was fine, but didn't do any shopping. Tried to go into the temple but was stopped because I had shorts on. Which is fine, but the place was so mobbed with people that others got through. So just be aware if you want to enter the temple. Overall I'd put it lower on the list of things people must see while in Singapore."
,,Atmospheric part of town,4.0,,"Fun part of town to wander around, it has a bustling atmosphere with the obligatory lanterns and signs that seem to accompany Chinatowns the world over. There are plenty of street stalls to shop in and places to eat, including a food street nearby. Worth a visit if you're in the area, I'm not sure I'd want to travel here just to visit."
,,Feel of china !!,4.0,,"China town brings you the feel of real China in Singapore.The moment you step out of China Town MRT station ,you would feel as you though had been transported to China.The hawker centres are reasonable and offer tasty delicacies.China town street gives options for cheap street shopping,and cheap Singapore souvenirs."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,Plenty of different types of shopping and varying cultures. Great places to eat. Amazing architecture.
,,Exacly what you might expect:,4.0,,"Rows and rows of products made in.....? China ofcourse. If your looking for cheap souvenirs and food, mixed with some history, definitely make a stop here. Make sure not to spend too much time here though, as the rest of The magnificent city awaits."
,,Worth visiting,3.0,,"We spent the day here in March. It's a very interesting place to stop and visit. There are hundreds a of shops however they mostly sell the same things. If your after a cheap momento or bargain gift this is the place to come.

We stopped for a drink but probably wouldn't eat here.

Keep your possessions close and take lots of photos there are a few lovely buildings and things to take photos of"
,,Shopping,5.0,,"We love China Town, this is one of those places where all your senses are switched on, I have been here so many times and China Town never dissapoints. You need to be on your guard not to get hassled by the many salesmen who would sell their mother in law. The many food stalls have great variety. The people are mostly always friendly
& there are bargins to be found . Travellers need to be aware of their surroundIngs to keep safe after dark ."
,,Good shops and restaurants,4.0,,"As someone who's previously lived in China, this place had a lot of the little things you get there. On top of that the food was a really good match for proper Chinese food. Worth a visit for the food at least."
,,"if you are near, you can see it",3.0,,"nothing special, like many china town in other places, very beatiful temple, you must see it if you are there"
,,"Fun, Bright, Lively.",5.0,,"Great place to spend a couple hours. Plenty of cheap food places just outside the most touristy parts.

Enjoyed the Chinese heritage museum, took in a few temples and used the services of the Information Centre."
,,a little taste of China,5.0,,"Just walk around in Chinatown, explore the market and many shops and take a lunch in one of the little restaurants"
,,do all your shopping here,5.0,,"best place for bargains.

,,Last Day in Singapore!,5.0,,"Everyone's itinerary for last day is shopping !! and Chinatown is one the best shopping center around Singapore .You can buy a lot of souvenirs, shirts and etc., Feel free to bargain at there prices. They also sell cheap tickets for attractions! and you can find the booth of the Singapore pass at the end left side ."
,,Chinatown Singapore,3.0,,"I am a Singaporean and have witness the changes at Chinatown over the years.
My advise to tourist is if you can give the place a miss, please do so by all means.
You have to bargain when you are shopping around the area if you do not see a fixed price tag, chances are you will be paying a lot more if you do not bargain.
Finally be prepared to be shocked by the crowd in Chinatown during weekends, you will see a lot of migrant workers gather there for food and drinks."
,,So cool,5.0,,I loved China town. I got some great souvenirs to bring home for my family members. They still all love them and have them in their homes. The food is also great here.
,,a must see attraction,4.0,,took the hop on hop off bus to see china town was not realy impressed as it was a hot day and the area was cowded with visitors.

,,Singapore Chinese Style,4.0,,"A great place to eat for quality food is the hawker centre, beer and soft drinks only but very good value."
,,Own little China in Singapore,3.0,,"This place clearly differs from the rest of the Singapore. You will see the hectic market life and beautiful architecture. The food is also Chinese here, so forget about pizza and burgers.

You can spend a lot of time there, just by shopping and wondering around. Gold stores, electronics, food courts.... The only negative would be the humid air and +30 when you walk around a non aircon places."
,,Little massy.. Superb cultural temples.,4.0,,We visited China Town on 6th March.. Hawker centre for cheap food..and specially for non vegetarians... Roads are OK ok.. Not so good not so bad. Little massy area in all over the Singapore... Souvenirs for cheap rate ..

,,Amazing,5.0,,"We have been to many Chinatowns in many cities. This one is the cleanest I have encountered. The many market stalls and food places were while touting for business not pushh and offensive as experienced in other places.

,,Neat!!,5.0,,I have seen china town in neighbouring country Malaysia...I must admit Singapore China town is much more calm and close to its roots.

,,Disappointing,2.0,,"As I was walking through the markets, I was very disappointed to be conned into entering a store/ then being told that I should purchase a suit. When I told the store owner that I wasn't interested - he then insisted that I go and visit his wife who has a jewellery store (a few stores down). She was so pushy/ it was just totally awkward & she didn't want to take No for an answer. I ended up walking out...... I wonder how many unsuspecting tourists have fallen into their trap & felt obliged to purchase goods that they never wanted or intended to buy."
,,A great place for shopping and souvenirs,5.0,,The must go place for shopping and souvenir bargains Recommend the MRT to travel there I enjoyed the Buddist Temple in the heart of Chinatown

,,Fun place to walk around,4.0,,"I like chinatown, and I always bring out of town visitors to come and walk around.

Pagoda street, and the adjacent streets, is full of street stalls and tacky touristy gifts which is fun to walk around as looks at. there are a few Haker centres which are a bit touristy in my opinion but they are in a good spot for lunch or a refuel."

Otherwise nice place to walk in, if you wanna buy cheap things, visit a temple, the food there way too expensive and not the best in town.
Worth visiting"
,,A Happening Place,5.0,,"I have been going to Singapore since I was a child and like most Bengali families, my family only liked to hangout on Orchard Road and around. So this time when I was there on my own, I decided to check Chinatown out.

The options for good local restaurats are numerous and they are all really good! And the various stores are all worth a peak. And I dont mean the typical touristy shops. For instance, I was looking for Dim Sum baskets to take back home with me so I started asking around for it. A very helpful Singaporean asked me to follow his directions to a kitchen instrument supply store. Now, for an ametuer cook like me, these stores are a Mecca. I spent hours there looking at all the very reasonably priced kitchen appliances. And ended up getting way more than just dim sum baskets. And the bill was surprisingly low and that made me doubly happy. There are many stores like the one I visited and they are all full of treasures.

I recommend to spend a whole day at Chinatown. Have your lunch and dinner there because trust me, you are going to want to eat at mulitple places. So might as well spend the whole day there and get to eat everything you want. And you can always go back there over and over again for more!"
,,An interesting place to visit,4.0,,"Chinatown is easy to get to on the MRT underground system as it it the last stop on oe of the colour coded lines. Like Singapore itself, it is cleaner than Chinatowns in other cities but has many shops and food eateries. You know you are there by the sights and smells and there are so many things you can buy here cheaper than other places in Singapore, and yes, event barter a bit. Get off the two main streets for a more unique perspective."
,,Another China Town,4.0,,the china town in singapore and in malaysia are almost the same except in singapore its cleaner. i didn;t find the products remarkably cheap. but good to go and see the trinkets.
,,Chinatown,4.0,,Singapore Chinatown is a taste from China middle of Singapore. Easy to get lost (in a good way!) between the shops and excotic food places. MRT is really near so easy to get there. This time we visited Chinatown middle of Chinise New Year and it was full of beautifle decorations and red colour. Wonderful!
,,Wow...the cleanest Chinatown I've ever seen,5.0,,"If there is a Chinatown, I'm there. Whether it's San Francisco, Bangkok or Paris, I always make a stop in the local Chinatown where ever I travel. Hands down and without hesitation, Singapore Chinatown was the cleanest, most fragrant and bustling Chinatown I have ever seen. If you have frequented Chinatowns, you know the smells are not for everyone. Singapore Chinatown was delightful and clean - even late at night! Fun atmosphere, enchanting shops (along with the typical trinket junk you find in Chinatowns around the globe) and yummy food. Be careful as the streets are often narrow and deliveries and cars speed through - but all in all - I loved it!"
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"Good place to kill a few hours. Plenty of interesting shops (although we made the mistake of getting a couples massage in what may have not necessarily been strictly a massage venue). There's a small but very interesting Chinese history museum worth the small admission.

As an Australian visitor I would probably choose Kampong Glam for the Arab district, or Little India over Chinatown, simply as they are harder to come by experiences for Australians."
,,Old Singapore,4.0,,A nice area to walk around and experience the old Singapore. There are a lot of restored shop houses and nice restaurants as well as interesting Hindu and Buddhist temples. A nice contrast to modern Singapore.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Great place for budget shopping, eating and watching the world go by. It was walking distance from our hotel. Worth a visit."
,,What you need is what they have,5.0,,"You name it what you need to the people there, they will show you the ways. The pave is huge but fun. Must be little patient with the rough handling attitude and sweat. But it is a pretty much event you need one stop shopping and meal."
,,One of the best Chinatown s i have visited...,5.0,,"This is a vibrant neighbourhood, full of action and street vendors of exotic foods that westerners are not used to."
,,Cheap street!,4.0,,"You can found everything since food, decorations made by chinese at night market, or if you want buy sth for your parents. The chinese food is so delicious but spicy. Highly recommended for someone looking cheap food in singapore."
,,You should always bargain!,4.0,,"When you are in Chinatown, make your way to Maxwell Food center to try their Famous Chicken Rice at Tian Tian. Multiple guides also recommend malasian style jerkey and that is something you should not miss out on!"
,,I love Chinatown,5.0,,I loved the outdoor eating area at the night market I love the nightly entertainment during Chinese new year in the outdoor theater and I stated a wonderful little guesthouse called the beady best guesthouse. Directly across from the Chinatown subway station convenient to everything
,,Shop & Eat,5.0,,"We loved Chinatown, seems everywhere we travel & visit the respective Chinatown's we find the friendliest people and great shopping at some of the best prices around. If you like to eat & travel than this should be on your itinerary."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,We walked here although plenty of busses. had a feed and a few drinks. One of the few places in Singapore where you don't have to spend a lot of money.

,,Interesting,4.0,,Came here ust after Chinese New Year so a lot of the decorations are still up. Beautiful Buddhist Temple within the heart of this bustling area. The usual tourist tat on sale but the food at the Hawker centres is great and excellent value.
,,Love,5.0,,"Great architecture, lo e the side streets and all the markets. Food street is great and has tons of options, it's like a big food court. We had a great time wandering through the streets. Don't miss Korea town to the south of Chinatown."
,,The place to eat,5.0,,If you don't want to pay the silly prices elsewhere head to here for good food at half the price and wonder through the markets after.
,,"Always love to pop in, when in Singapore",4.0,,"Love to eat, shop or just browse here. My sisters loved it here and had each done a fair bit of shopping here. I myself, am happy just see what's new to sell here. Loved their Singapore printed t-shirts. It's always worth a look."
,,Chinese New Year,5.0,,"This place was buzzing with people and activity over Chinese New Year. Feels a very safe place to be as zero crime. Very colourful and fun, especially in the evening."
,,Wow!,5.0,,No doubt this is a must option for tourists; a huge number of stores and stalls offering lots of low cost stuff as well as food and higher end products. Crowded streets and great people watching.
,,Wander the streets...,5.0,,"loved just wandering the streets and absorbing the sounds, smells, flavours and most important soaking up the atmosphere. Grab a bargain, haggle the price and indulge in some real Chinese food...a real must when in Singapore by day and by night!"
,,Go for the food and atmosphere,4.0,,We went to Chinatown at night and during the day. It is so much better at night. It didn't hurt that it was Chinese New Year so it was beautifully decorated. The food is cheap and delicious. The beer is a bit pricey but that is the way it is in Singapore. The stalls are all brightly coloured and very inviting. Don't believe what you hear....you can haggle on some higher priced items. Also there is free wifi throughout Chinatown. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Chinatown,3.0,,"In smith street you can have a lot of chinese and thai cuisine Mostly open from 11am. In stall area, food average start from $8 Good taste but bad service For souvenir, lucky plaza have better price than chinatown"
,,Hustle and bustle shops and great food,5.0,,Lots of little shops and keen sellers in this area. You can pick up a bargain especially for souvenirs and jewellery. At night time the streets come alive with food stalls. Cheap and very tasty options. Also great for cheap massages / reflexology.
,,Chinatown,4.0,,Great for gift buying in padola st has a great chinese restaurant on corner of walkway .really nice food and huge bottle of beer for cheap price been there several times love this place . Great place to visit
,,Shopping and food!,5.0,,"I visited Singapore a couple weeks after the Chinese New Year, so China town was decorated beautifully with lanterns and monkeys. I walked around and enjoyed a cheap but delicious meal at one of the many hawker places that they have. Afterwards I crossed the bridge and walked the food off shopping at the markets for souvenirs."
,,Market atmosphere,5.0,,Loved walking through all the stalls and looking at the different products available. Lots if $2 shops all throughout the market; making it great for souvenirs and presents. Great atmosphere and no sellers are pushy whatsoever.
,,"Bargains, art, temples, hawkers",4.0,,"Come to grab much cheaper and more interesting souvenirs that you'll find on orchard road, head to Maxwell food centre for great, cheap hawker food and pop in to the tooth relic temple for a hugely interesting, beautiful series of displays on Buddhist worship."
,,Interesting place to visit & explore,5.0,,"We stayed in The Chinatown area during Chinese New Year for 4 days during our trip to Singapore & loved the area as we went exploring every day. There were so many beautiful decorations for the year of the monkey on the main street, New Bridge Road. We were near the Buddha Tooth Relic Museum which was an interesting place in itself. Maxwell Food Center was around the corner, too. It has many booths that sell local food so you can experience a variety of Chinese dishes. Chinatown Food Street on Smith Street is a great place to visit at night. There is a huge variety of food to choose from & some sit down restaurants as well. Our friends love to shop for knickknacks & they had a wonderful time each day exploring the narrow streets full of goodiess & the little stores, too. My husband had a sore neck and saw a street sign for a chiropractor so the 3 guys went and asked. They did get a good massage & were asked if they wanted more services which thy declined. No problems. WE really enjoyed our time in Chinatown & caught the Hop on Bus from here, too!"
,,Chinatown,3.0,,Kind of what I expected from a Chinatown. It was mostly full of souvenir market shops and it was the dirtiest area I have been to in Singapore. It is worth a look but they have signs up saying be careful of pickpockets and it is easy to see why this place would have that issue. I didn't eat there so I can't comment on the food. I did go to the Temple which was very nice.
,,Touristy but no less awesome,5.0,,"Although Chinatown was extremely touristy, just like New York Chinatown, it was full of hidden goodies and treasures. From the hawker centers and underground markets to the Bak Kwa, I loved my time here."
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,"Enjoyed strolling around Chinatown, shops were interesting lovely people. Food street was interesting, had lunch mine was a disappointment... Hubby enjoyed his and friend had a great beef and rice dish... Just choose right place and food should be good. I loved looking at the buildings also."
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,Shops galore although many things are just cheap knock offs. You have to bargain. I mentioned to my husband that I had NEVER seen so many Chinese Restarnats lined up like that - not even in China.
,,like the food centre near OG which have lot of good food. nice shop around chinatown,4.0,,"like the food centre near OG which have lot of good food. nice shop around chinatown . also quite clean too which is good. also lot of Chinese things, food and items. also rich in culture and see the Chinese around the area. also lot of interesting things to see."
,,Compared th other China towns not as colourful,3.0,,"Clean, orderly and rearly smelly this Chinatown corrsponds to the general presentation of Singapore. A good place to eat and shop for souveniers."
,,Busk in the mood of festivities,3.0,,"Like all Chinatowns around the world, this is the place to find a piece of Chinese culture and food. Good for leisurely walk if you don't mind the heat. You can find great food at the multi-storey hawker centre (ask for that). This haven lies great Singapore food of all sorts at totally affordable pricing.
If you'd prefer proper dining environment in air con comfort. Yum cha restaurant nearby serves good tim sum.
The place comes totally alive during lunar new year, needless to say."
,,A Must for Every Tourist,5.0,,"One of my favourite place to roam. Smith Street, Temple Street, Trengganue Streets.....they all intertwine. One end is People's Park Centre on New Bridge Road (many money changers here with rather good rates) , hawker centre and the other end on South Bridge Road (where during the day you can find many old fashion chinese jewellery shops, medicinal as well as shops selling dried goods like shrimp, mushroom, fungus, etc etc. as well as the popular Indian Temple. Besides the tourist-fare of open stores selling Sing-memorabilia,, open=air food stores and a mixture of other small restaurant fare (which I personally do not go for), the adventurer can explore some Chinese medicinal shops, antique shops, jade shops (good quality and authenticated, bought my jade bangle here 3 years ago). One of my favourite sells freshly baked ''wife cake'' & other chinese biscuits/cakes and the other of course offers sweet soup (tong sui)/bachang and plenty of other cantonese sweets not available elsewhere. This dessert shop is very popular."
,,Chinese New Year,5.0,,"Arrived there early as it was springing to life. Celebrations, decorations, food, bargains and fun people all over the place."
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"Singapore's Chinatown is a must visit. The Shop houses alone in Chinatown are already worth the time.

There are so many food choices in Chinatown. Aside from that there are jewellry, souvenir shops located in Chinatown. There is also a very nice Tin Tin Shop located near the Chinatown Heritage Centre."
,,"Fantastic Chinatown, especially during Chinese Lunar New Year",4.0,,"In multi-racial Singapore, Chinatown is one of the many places you MUST visit to get the flavour of the Singapore-version of Chinese-ness.
True, the country has evolved in Chinese-ness, so to speak, but Chinatown at least tries to retain the flavour, albeit in a too-modern way. Nonetheless, enjoy the atmosphere of festivities, and try the Chinese cuisines. Expensive place, though, for food and drinks, but a nice place for photo taking.
Visit the many temples too. A hindu temple in Chinatown also adds a nice flavour to the area!"
,,Budget souvenir and meal,4.0,,Lots of $2 shops. And you can have local chinese meal in people's complex with affordable budget. Also juice for $2-$3. It's just connected to MRT so easily accessable. Not far from Qlarke Quay by walking
,,Old town,3.0,,"It's a lil bit rainy when we get there so we don't go too far from the MRT station. We don't want to get wet, don't we? I have porridge and hubby have fishball noodle. Then we take a walk around it. Close to Buddha Tooth relic although we don't get to get inside, just a peek because they were have some event. Fortunately we come near to CNY so they sell so many monkey stuff and cute ornaments for CNY."
,,CHINATOWN,5.0,,"Easily accessible by metros and buses, this is a small historic picturesque hustling bustling town within singapore. It depicts Chinese heritage . The streets are filled with traditional shops and markets as well as cool stores and cafes."
,,Good for souvenirs & Dim Sum,4.0,,"You have to visit chinatown in every asian city. I just love the atmosphere, and the secret little shops still to discover. Also good place to get and bargain a good souvenir for friends and family !"
,,Shopping At Its Best!!,5.0,,"Our Experience: We took the MRT and reached there very conveniently.. Great place to buy souvenirs.. Walkable distance from Maxwell Food center.. although it was closed on that day so we found another hawker centre while walking back from there towards the MRT..

TIPS
1. Its alright to visit here even when it rains because all the shops outside the MRT are quite well sheltered from the rain.
2. Key chains and magnets are abundant and cheap so visit all shops before u finalize ur purchase.
3. Chinese lanterns are available and they look gorgeous so if u want some to decorate ur home make sure u bargain and get them.
4. Maxwell food centre was closed or something so we walked back and came across this nice food street on Smith Street which offers a variety of cuisines."
,,Food location Neighbourhood,5.0,,"If you're non Muslim, you can consider to go to china town...you can found so many food along the street from pork, chicken, beef, prawn, ETC"
,,Lots of monkeys,4.0,,"What a riot of color in preparation for the lunar new year. Appropriate for the year of the monkeys, the critters were everywhere in plastic, cloth, as balloons etc. I liked the quieter area where a Buddhist temple stood next to a mosque behind a small park with Malay fishermen statues. I disliked the many stalls in another area which sold mainly junk souvenirs. The gentleman in the tourist information pavilion gave excellent advice and gave us much of his time by explaining Singapore's history."
,,The best district!,5.0,,"If you travel on a budget and want to find a conveniently located accomodation, then Chinatown is the best choice for you! There are a lot of nice hostels, restaurants / bars and souvenir shops here - basically everything that a tourist might need. Moreover, you can do a lot of sightseeing in the area (Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, Sri Mariamman Temple, Jamae Mosque, just to mention the most significant landmarks). Chinatown MRT station serves as an interchange, so there are lots of places all around the city that you can easily access from here (such as Singapore Botanic Gardens or Marina Bay). And if you prefer to explore the city on foot, you can reach the main attractions (Merlion Park, etc.) in 15-20 minutes."
,,Chinatown - Singapore 2016,5.0,,Clinically clean and busy place during Chinese New Year with gorgeous food smells throughout narrow streets and excellent service from all food stalls. Refreshing cold lemon tea to die for in this heat.
,,It's like a real chinesse market,2.0,,If you like markets and street chinesse food you can walk around this place and buy some things from the vermin sellers. But nothing else.
,,LOVED IT,5.0,,We stopped in China Town as part of the Hop on Hop of bus tour.So glad we did.Lots of knick knacks and things to buy.Wide assortment of foods at a reasonable price.Could have spent half a day here looking at all there was to see
,,A 'must visit',4.0,,Visited China Town many times during my visits to Singapore. it is a must for all visitors. The Peoples Palace has a great atmosphere as well as very good prices. The Market outside is great with lots of bargains and bric-a-brac.
,,Great night had !,5.0,,"We went on a guided tour & by ourselves while in Singapore. The guided tour was excellent ! Took us to a great Tom Yum restaurant, had a great rickshaw ride to Clarke Quay & a fabulous river cruise from Clarke Quay"
,,Pretty and busy.,5.0,,"Definitely worth a trip. Really good food, pretty and bustling at night. Easy to get lost in the maze of malls and funny little shops. Good place to stay as well."
,,"Good Place, Good Food",5.0,,"Chinatown is a great place for chilling out. There are so many food stalls, souvenir shops, medical shops, and hotel/hostel here. Also don't forget to visit Sri Mahariamman and Buddha Tooth Relic temple. They're close to Chinatown area."
,,Nice to visit but not much going on in the evening,3.0,,"We went here around 8.30 - 9.30pm and it was quiet but colourful with the lights. There are a variety of shops selling all sorts from food to tourist tatt (many of these) and we didn't find it as good as we'd expected. However, we're pleased we went; it's good to see the area and as we went with friend who are locals we were given an insight into the foods they buy along with seeing their interaction with the stall holders."
,,It was a great walk,5.0,,"We were but lost while searching for a veg restaurant, but when we accidentally got in we just loved the place. Beautiful and old. Mix culture and definitely great culture mix"
,,Well preserved colonial setting,4.0,,"Amidst all the high rise multi storey buildings in this city, a visit to sample the old world colonial charm of the Chinatown district is a must, although a touch touristy & sanitised. You will find retail outlets that are family run going back several generations sandwiched between all the tacky souvenir shops peddling the usual junk."
,,"Fun night out, typical tourist china-town",3.0,,"Have only been here at night, so things may be different during the day. Touristy streets are fun, vibrant and stocked with tasty food. Lots of trinkets and odds and ends for sale. Main tourist street is covered, so OK for rainy day."
,,Fun place to visit,5.0,,The restaurants shops and the atmosphere is fantastic they also have great Jewelly shops and massage salons it's a very good place to people watch and have a great time
,,Trinket shopping! Gorgeous temple,3.0,,"We began our visit with a trip to the temple. Our taxi driver had advised us to use the lift to get on the roof. This wasn't obvious, but opened up another world of wonder. The temple is well worth a visit.

Chinatown itself offers hundreds of stalls selling all sorts of trinkets/gifts. Prices can vary significantly from shop to shop and some negotiation is allowed.

There is a slightly fishy smell throughout the streets. It was a particularly warm day, so that didn't help. It's a busy spot with lots of people."
,,A must visit in Singapore,4.0,,"It is just good to see the old style of Singapore row houses with shops down and living upstairs, with the wooded shutters, the architecture is wonderful. Couple this with some of the best Chinese eating establishments and a nice cold beer, what more could you ask for.

The Main Street from the MRT has all the usual tourist souvenir shops but venture away a little and you will find old antique shops, Chinese medicine shops and all the lovely markets for fresh food.

A nice place to take an hour or two to stroll around"
,,Chicken rice !!,5.0,,"Loved Chinatown ... had an amazing two types of chicken rice at one of the food vendors at the 'food street' reasonably priced and those aromas from all the mix of foods being prepared. Very high hygiene standards are maintained. Must go !
Visited the temples simply beautiful and serene.
Great day out !"
,,great!,4.0,,"During my visit to Singapore, I really enjoyed walking around and seeing the various delights of Chinatown. Here, you can easily go around and shop for cutesy souvenirs that are reasonably priced and there are plenty of food places to try. I recommend allowing yourself at least half a day here since there is quite a bit to do. If you swing by here early morning, make a small trek to Maxwell Food Centre for some breakfast since most of the vendors aren't opened until like 10am or later. After breakfast, take your time in browsing the different vendors and small shops. Most of the vendors will sell similar things at similar prices and there doesn't seem to be much haggling involved.

Some of the major attractions within Chinatown is: Chinatown Complex, the temple, visitor center and etc. I highly recommend stopping by the Complex for lunch / food. On the second level of the complex, you'll find a hawker center that is literally filled with various food stalls. If you like to shop for clothes, there is an abundant amount of vendors on the first floor of the complex that sells only clothes. If you're a tourist and want to make a one stop kind of deal on buying tickets to major attractions, stop by the visitor center. My friends and I purchase our tickets in advance to the Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the Bay and Night Safari there and managed to save money on some small discounts :]. As for the temple, it's really easy to find but do keep in mind that if you visit, shorts and tanks aren't allowed. So remember to cover up with the garments that are provided by the temple at the entrances.

Overall, this was quite a pleasant experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Singapore."
,,Interesting ...from a tourist perspective,4.0,,The area reminded me of just about any Chinatown in any other part of the world. It was not too crowded though I visited at the time of Chinese New Year. The same old touristy stuff is available in most of the shops but you will also see some pretty stuff at the back of the shops though these are expensive. Good for souvenirs!

Pagoda Street was full of stalls and fun things to look at. We bought kimonos, chopsticks, stone stamps and lots more. We took loads of pictures and the atmosphere was excitement in the extreme. Lovely people, lovely food to nibble and lovely gifts to buy! Can't say what it would've like if it hadn't been the CNY but were told it was probably just the same !! Loved it !!"

,,Busy!,4.0,,"It sounds odd having an area called Chinatown in Singapore (for obvious reasons!). It is a wonderful area though. Lof os colonial architecture still around, loads of shops, great places to eat, life everywhere!

It is a big area. There is big markets type area in the Pagoda Street area so if you looking for local nik naks, that is the area. There is the People's Park complex that has been there for years. It's full of odd shops but is the place to go for a foot massage. Restaurants everywhere and some are really good.

If you really like the area, there are a number of hotels in the area including some which are refurbished shophouses. These are delightful but can be just a little noisy.

If you are a tourist to Singapore, Chinatown is a must visit area!"

You can spend an entire morning or afternoon wandering the streets and visiting the unique stalls. We ate in 2 different eateries, each time was quite an experience. You haven't dined until you've had chicken feet! Chinatown is right at a Metro station, so it's easy to get to. In addition, be sure to visit the Buddhist temple there. It's open to the public and is an awesome experience."

,,Goes on and on!!,5.0,,"Really cool shopping venue, right off the MRT. You can literally spend hours wandering around all the shops. Many sell similar items, luggage tags, souvenirs, clothing, etc., you can bargain some due to all the competition. Also nice drink and snack stands all along the way. It's mainly outdoors, so if it's hot outside, you might want to wait until late afternoon to visit."
,,Mrs,4.0,,"A great place to buy holiday souvenirs. Most retailers were very courteous and helpful. Great prices and deals. The Chinese Heritage Centre was pricey, however so we didn't visit this place."
,,Different and nice,4.0,,This China town is different than other China-towns in other countries. It is a genuine China town. Make sure to buy all your souvenirs there as it is much cheaper than the shops in Singapore.
,,Amazing Accessibility,4.0,,"Take the Downtown SMRT line and walk out right onto the Chinatown Street, if one checks the exit gate carefully! This is amazing in term of accessibility!

,,Bruce Pullman,5.0,,"Not the most interesting Chinatown I've seen. Nothing seems authentic, genuine or reasonable. I mostly wanted to leave as quickly as possible."
,,Chinatown Wet Fish Market,5.0,,"If you want an experience this is the place to go. My understanding from an imformative taxi driver that this is one of the last fish markets in Singapore. It is so interesting to walk round and see many varieties of fish for sale that especially in the UK you would never see. One thing that surprised us and was facinating that they sell live frogs (4 frogs for $10. The gentleman we watched was putting loads of them into a carrier bag (obviously an order) so strange. They are bull frogs and its only the hind legs that are eaten.
There is also live ells, snakes and other live fish not all of which I can name. Loved taking photos round here and they do not mind. The stall holders are happy to talk to you if you want to know anything. The floors are very wet so you have to be careful not to slip and the smell is okay but obviously very fishy."
,,"Lively neighborhood, local food, cheap buys, temples, bars and restaurants",5.0,,"Chinatown is always a good idea. It's great for souvenirs, cheap buys, affordable food, visiting temples from different religions (chinese, buddhist, indian). It's also good for going out and clubbing."

,,A vibrant and colour area.,4.0,,You can spend and afternoon exploring the area. Lots of old shopping and stay for cheap drinks and chinese food as the sun goes down.
,,Interesting Place in Singapore,4.0,,"Chinatown in Mandarin Chinese is known as ""Niu Che Shui"" Been awhile since I come Chinatown and I was here yesterday. The MRT entrance at Chinatown seem the same as before. Along the street, look like there are a lot conservation or building focus on tourist attraction.

Somehow I can feel the traditional atmosphere and seem a hot tourist spot. I've tourist asking me for directions and shops and restaurants to attract tourist and backpackers. Very different from the typical neighbourhood in Singapore. Chinatown has many shop houses design which is attractive.

Maybe it is due to the Chinese new year lighting which is colourful and decorated with red lantern that make this place special and welcoming. I walk around and also pass by the Buddha tooth relic temple and food centre. There is also a road path with whole stretch of Chinatown street food.

End up I feel like i'm a tourist to this country and began to snap some beautiful photoshoot of this place. A good experience and I look forward to explore more of this place in future.

Hope you enjoy too!"
,,Place for Souvenir and Food,4.0,,"This area cover a big area, here is famous with the Souvenir. Here we can find so many store offer cloth, key chain, watch, mirror, etc as souvenir. Beside that we can find so many drug store and also so many restaurants serve chinese or other dishes, very nice place to visit and enjoy shopping and eating. I have one favourite durian pancake below the crossing bridge the store locate at the corner. Here we can also find so many fruit seller."
,,Still retains some charm...,3.0,,"If you are travelling to Singapore, you may wish to take a morning or afternoon in Chinatown. As a tourist, the most interesting places are those with a bit of history and all within close proximity are the Sri Mariamam temple, a very old mosque and a number of Taoist temples. The streets themselves have been somewhat sanitised over the last 10-20 years but retain some of the original feel that they must have had years before.

If you want something more 'earthy' then the streets of Penang or Malacca are more likely to satisfy the true historians. Nevertheless, the great advantage of the Singapore version is that there are plenty of English-speakers to hand and they are always quite warm and friendly.

Try not to be too intimidated by the numerous requests from shop fronts to step in and try their wares, try a new suit, avail yourselves of their delectable food etc. Most traders will stop if given a polite smile and a ""no thanks"". There are quite strict rules about what traders can and can't do and they are aware that if they overstep the mark they can be 'blacklisted' by Singapore's highly effective Tourism Promotion Board. There are some 'bad eggs' but they are definitely in the minority.

What to see and do? It's really a matter of taste. If you are a foodie then there are some really good eateries both here and close by in Clarke Quay and Boat Quay. Singapore has a rightful reputation as a food paradise and you'll find really satisfying food in some of the most humble locations. I tend to go for 'coffee shops' which are like little collectives of traders selling numerous different dishes. Often there is a change of stallholders as the day goes by with a group of breakfast, lunch and dinner traders all working away in quite tight confines.

Visually, Singapore's Chinatown is an exciting blend of old and new. There are traditional shop-houses close to brand new shopping malls. Transport is easy thanks to the MRT 'metro' rail network and easy to board buses. The transportation network utilises a cashcard type system (very similar to Oyster cards in London - although Singapore got there first). You can get single journey tickets on the trains but it is a much better idea to get a stored value card because then you can plan your own bus and train route with numerous transfers.

I tend to go to China town about 2-3 times a year these days. It is great to go for the Chinese New Year Celebrations and the Mooncake festival as these bring out large numbers of locals and tourists alike. The crowds can certainly swell - especially over the Lunar New Year - but that is half the fun. My favourite treat? A roast pork delicacy known as as Bak-kwa (it is often spelled in a variety of ways but if you get the pronunciation right no-one cares). It may look a bit odd at first but, trust me, it is a real joy. Locals describe it as 'heaty' and will often tell you not to eat it if you have a cold (based on the idea that there are foods that are 'heaty' and 'cooling' respectively). Keep an eye open for durian too when it's in season. This is the famous fruit that one either loves or hates. It has a distinctive odour as does its cousin the Jackfruit. I rather like it but I must admit that I cannot eat too much. The flavour is nothing like what the smell suggests and if you get a good one (believe me you can become a connoisseur of the various varieties) then it results in a creamy, rich and flavoursome experience. Oh, and watch out for the result later. After eating durian, it is very common to get a little gas. Every time you belch, the flavour comes back!

So, why just a morning or afternoon? Well, it really is your choice but Chinatown is very self-contained and after about 2 hours of wandering and browsing you'll get a sense that there is not much more to see. You'll also be either very hot or very wet as our equatorial climate can be a bit punishing to say the least.

For shoppers (especially textiles) pop across the road to People's Park Complex. This is also very close to one of the MRT entrances and in the complex itself is a food centre as well as numerous small shops selling all sorts of fabrics for the home sewer. In the large air conditioned shopping complex adjacent to this you will find numerous camera and electronic goods stores as well as travel agents, nail bars and massage stations. The latter are an acquired taste. Most are expensive and offer very little therapeutic value. If you are looking for a really good deep tissue massage you'd be better off going to one of the hotel spas. Beware the 'other' type of massages. Along a number of Chinatown streets (usually on the upper floors) you'll see ""massage"" advertised. These are very much for the ...ahem...sensual traveller if you know what I mean.

I could go on and on. All in all it's an atmospheric blend of old and new. You'll get to hear Mandarin, Hokkien, Cantonese and 'bazaar Malay' mixed in with bits of English. You'll see garish and rich colours, you'll smell Bak Kwa and durian, and taste all sorts of cheap and tasty food. A nice break from the overly air-conditioned hotel lobbies and shopping malls."

Many souvenirs at low prices. Same quality as in other places but price lower.
Can find good traditional food.
The are some signs to be aware of pickpoketing.

In allit was a nice experiance."
,,Singapore Chinatown,5.0,,"I stayed in a hostel in Chinatown during the 2016 CHinese New Year, which was a pretty cool experience. Some limitations due to CNY closures, but a nice area central to the city and easily accessible by walking, transit, or MRT."
,,China Town...It's just Okay,3.0,,Definitely not a 'must' see. If you have spare time check it out. Not overly cheap. Better at night when it is cooler.
,,Walk through China Town,5.0,,Used the metro to get to china town walked around for hours just taking the whole atmosphere in loved it no issues at all. The decorations where up for Chinese New Year - Year of the Monkey everything was great. Just browsing the food looked amazing and different
,,Lots to see and do...,5.0,,"A must-visit during your time in Singapore. I especially recommend the Chinatown Heritage Centre (I believe it's called), where you can witness the living conditions of the first Chinese settlers in Singapore. Also, there are so many cheap goodies here - including bags, snacks, souvenirs, you name it. There are several Hawker Centres in the area for filling, delicious, and budget-friendly meals. Hurray!"
,,No Singapore without Chinatown,5.0,,"Take a morning stroll through Chinatown, it is as good as at night. Have a bowl of soup in Chinatown centre and visit the basement to see some live animals before they get cooked and enjoy the souvenir stalls in this buzzling area. Always fun"
,,Typical china town,5.0,,The Chinese new year celebrations had just begun so a visit to Chinatown was well times. We has an excellent value lunch and drink in the very centre and visited many of the local attraction's. Always an entertaining few hours in a bustling environment
,,shopping heaven,5.0,,"great for bargins and the mrt is slap bang in the central of the market, great deals though you can also get great deals in bugis street as well, we had chilli crab here too as the food was fantastic"
,,Cheap place to shop,5.0,,"My wife and I visited Chinatown whilst in Singapore recently and although it was chinese new year and there were an large amount of people in Chinatown, we had an amazing time shopping with great bargains. The restaurants were reasonably priced and offered great food."
,,Super cheap places,4.0,,"I love this place, it feels like im coming to my hometown. Every single think is cheap n i love it. This place very good for all of u to buy souvenirs for your friends. This place sell everythink u want. Just try it"
,,Nothing particularly special,4.0,,"If you are into visiting Chinatowns of the world, come here too :) Came here during Chinese New Year day and was very crowded as expected. Lots of stalls selling souvenirs and little items while the restaurants are full.

The atmosphere is good though and full of New Year atmosphere with decorations filling up the place. The buildings are historical as well. I would recommend visiting here for the ""feel"" of the place rather than the stores for sure."
,,Has everything you can dream of,5.0,,"Chinatown in SGP offers something for everyone. Buddha Relic temple has four floors of art, it's s must visit place. Please dress apropriately. Sri Meriaman temple is smaller but then it gives opportunity to watch Hindu ceremonies (at 12.00 I think). Keong Saik Road has many trendy bars and restaurants as well as Club Street. I recommend the Disgruntled Chef and Comptoir Soori in particular they are a safe bet and my favorite places in SHP. You can see medicinal stores selling dried scary animals and god knows what more. There are also few tourist information places worth visiting. You will learn about the heritage center and small hidden temples. Finally it has a market where you can buy chop sticks, fruit, souvenirs etc, depending on your taste and wallet. Enjoy ;)"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Although the chinese new year isn't until the 16th of February the locals were gearing up for the festivities- lots of red everywhere, t shirts, dresses, toys etc. & lots of specail food. It's always fun in Chinatown but with the imminent festivities the atmosphere was wonderful."
,,A treat,5.0,,We spent the whole day at china town and had a really good time very interesting culture. And really good food. Though very hot needed to buy a hat to continue the site seeing
,,Visit during Chinese New Year,4.0,,We visited on the eve of Chinese New Year. The whole area was a vibrant sea of 'red'. Fantastic atmosphere.
,,Terific,5.0,,Great place to spend the day. Food halls are quite an experience and very cheap if you like to eat as the locals do. Good money changing booth in the main department store too.
,,Tourist Atraction,4.0,,"If you are into visiting every China Town in the world don't miss this China Town too. It offers the same thing other China Towns offer; cheap souvenirs. In Singapore additional to cheap Chinese products, it is also possible to find some stuff from Thailand and Indonesia. Usually very crowded and unbearable on a hot day. The food court however is interesting and gives great opportunity to try rich Singaporean cuisine for a little money. Small streets around the main market has some local shops where you can find some antiques and some interesting products such as Chinese wooden comb."
,,"Always a nice place to check out, but can get crowded",4.0,,"It's always nice to walk around Chinatown in Singapore, as there are many spas for relaxation, and sights to check out. The stalls all sell the same stuff more or less, so be sure to barter like crazy and you'll get a good deal. It tends to be really crowded on weekend nights."
,,Not to be missed while in Singapore..,4.0,,"No two Chinatowns are exactly the same anywhere in the world..depending on the origin of the early provincial Chinese settlers..that would lend itself to the distinct type of ""Chinatown ambiance""..in Singapore, the influence would be more of Hokkien, Hainanese origins rather than Cantonese..Interesting place to experience a hint of societal history of old Singapore..albeit it's a far cry from those truly days of yesteryears..Definitely, worth a visit..especially during the Chinese Lunar New Year season.."
,,Interesting area,4.0,,"Packed with ships and restaurants in authentic old shop front houses, this is a bustling and interesting area for both shopping and a wide variety of good Chinese food."
,,Love Chinatown,4.0,,"Did 2 trips to Chinatown. Both days were different, one was quiet as we were there in the morning, the other was a Saturday afternoon leading up to New Year, so the markets were packed. Despite the crowds we felt safe, and the shopping was good."
,,Fun place to see!,4.0,,"We stayed at the Scarlet Singapore Hotel which was within walking distance of Chinatown. We had a great time exploring, shopping, and taking pictures of the market. Our visit was during Chinese New Year preparations, so my understanding is that it was extra festive. I would highly recommend a visit. Expect it to be hot...just like the rest of Singapore :) We did have a minor issue with a vendor that gave us a sample (unsolicited) and then expected us to pay...irritating, but we walked off and did NOT pay."
,,Good Place,4.0,,You can find various delicious food & cheap souvenirs here. You can find the free wifi too in this area
,,Good Shopping,4.0,,We recently visited China town and were there for Chinese New Year. There are many great food places and good shopping. We found a Chinese Antique shop that had some amazing 100 year old vases and bowls. We also ate at a food mall in the main street that had so much variety a plate was about $5-00 so cheap. We found this to be the best value a lot of the restaurants add Vat & tax on to the bill.
,,Had a great tour with Rene from Chinatown Food Adventure - Urban Adventures ( singapore ),5.0,,"Had a great tour with Rene, he knows so much about Chinatown and Singapore and food was awesome. Recommend this tour to everyone. Singapore what a lovely City."

,,Beautiful.,5.0,,"Decorations for the Chinese New Year, year of the monkey, were being put up at the time of our visit. Colours were amazing and the stalls and shops were full of life and colour along with great prices for clothing and knick knacks."
,,Souvenirs paradise,4.0,,"Chinatown shouldn't be missed. It's part of the cultural heritage of Singapore. Many buildings with traditional architectural design can still be found. Chinatown is a great place to purchase inexpensive souvenirs. There are numerous souvenir shop lining the streets. So if you're looking for souvenirs, then this is the right place to go."
,,Funtime,4.0,,Very Crowded place. Fun time visiting the shops but most shops had same stuff. Buzzing street - enjoyed exploring - Crowded
,,Jammed for CNY,5.0,,"I was there during day and night the week of Chinese New Years. Jammed full and so authentic. Bargains and hawkers, great decorations, people from worldwide. Even in quiet times this Chinatown has a great feel to it. Highly recommended, especially early evening when lights have come on."
,,The day before Lunar New Year,4.0,,There're lots of people and lots of shop. Its very touristy. But nothing much happening. I'm a bit disappointed since I'm expecting much more.
,,Fascinating afternoon in Chinatown,4.0,,"Colourful area, with a very colonial look to the buildings. Lots of cheap shops all selling the same things, but charming in its own way, bustling with people.

The underground station is right in the middle so not difficult to get there if not located nearby.

Interesting food court at the far end, chock full of Chinese customers, so this is authentic street food, including pretty much anything you could think of - all parts of animals anatomy! Worth going just to see the produce on offer.

As well as that there are temples to visit, a vibrant area so different to the tall city bank buildings nearby."
,,Busy busy shopping area,3.0,,"Chinatown has a massive variance of shopping and night life. You can get pretty much everything in this area from a hover board to fresh oranges. We visited it during the heat of the day, would recommend an evening visit for a more comfortable time."
,,ABALONE and Scallop,5.0,,For the Chef and Great cooks as well as Abalone and Scallop Lovers ... this is the place to be! truly an experience.
,,Chinese New Year must go!,4.0,,"How can anyone miss this place during the Chinese New Year season?! Went last week and the streets were extremely crowded. Not only that, the Chinese New Year atmosphere was overwhelmingly spectacular!
There were many New Year goods on sale, and the items were really cute and not too expensive. Food street is not my thing however. Should try the Chang Cheng Porridge, which has a long queue! Really good frog leg porridge!"
,,Crazy fun!,4.0,,"I think this might be the best Chinatown (outside of China)I have been to. Lots of fun and things to see. Great food, get some chili crab. Shop in the street market. We were there for Chinese New Year too. It was amazing and crazy and worth going despite the crowds."
,,January family holiday 2016,5.0,,Absolutely love the atmosphere in Chinatown...really made us feel like we were in Singapore. Love Food Street - great character and ambience.
,,A Fun Chinatown!,4.0,,"We were lucky to not be too terribly far and walked over to explore. The outside street food court was full of delicious offerings, we had fun haggling with the street vendors for T-shirts and the typical tourist fare and in general enjoyed ourselves. Worth a visit."
,,Interesting,3.0,,"We visited Chinatown in January 2016 just before the Chinese New Year of the Monkey. The whole area was buzzing and vibrant (arguably a bit too cramped for some in the most popular streets). It's one of those places that all visitors to Singapore should visit; albeit, be prepared for hustle and bustle."
,,Chinese New Year,5.0,,We during Chinese New Year...so much food to eat and amazing decorations. Not sure how it is the rest of the year but we really enjoyed ourselves.
,,Lunar day eve visit.,4.0,,We went here the day before the new year and boy was it hectic. The colour the noise the people all walking talking in what was an incredible atmosphere. People selling anything and everything and the amazing colours. The lanterns were hanging from every where.Although there were signs of pick picks we did not feel unsafe in any way. What a great experience.
,,BIG PLACE!,5.0,,"A large area of outdoor shops filled with merchandise. you can find anything there but watch your bags, they have signs warning pick pockets. Great fruits and fish market."
,,Don't miss it on Lunar New Year's Eve,5.0,,"We loved strolling through Chinatown during the day, but our highlight was a visit on Chinese New Year's Eve - what a crowd. Enjoy the food on food street and all the business that surrounds it."
,,Great place to experience a Chinese street market!,5.0,,"Visited on the opening day of the Chinese New Year season, so it was pretty crowded. You can find absolutely anything oriental you might want here! Even cooked chicken feet!"
,,Very hectic,3.0,,"Chinatown is incredible and can easily result in sensory overload. We visited a couple of days before Chinese New Year and it was a bit overwhelming. That said, there is a plethora of restaurants and small shops, a total experience. Definitely worth going, but folks should be prepared for crowds."
,,"very crowded, lots of stalls, just not for me",3.0,,"Dropped by here on CNY and obviously very busy. Keep your lights on and your pockets zipped up as thieves are around. Lots of bargains to be had. Have a good time, but be aware of your surroundings."
,,Niu Che Shui,4.0,,"Immerse yourself in this busy area.... you will have food selections that make your eyes boggle ... and your imagination race. There is so much to see and do that it's literally an overload of information...but definitely one I would recommend. I have been to many Chinatowns in different cities, but this one assailed my senses like no other to date. It truly is worth going to have a look."
,,Food street worth visiting,3.0,,"Chinatown visited by majority of the tourists is a major attraction of Singapore and is of much significance to the locals and the tourists as well because Chinese are the largest ethnic group in Singapore. While the city has developed and is replaced by modern buildings, Chinatown still retains it’s original charm.

The main place visited by tourists is the area between Pagoda Street and Smith Street. You can find stalls selling Chinese trinkets, antique shops, shops selling souvenirs, handicrafts, silk, Chinese medicines, goldsmiths, tea houses etc. Many of the shops are selling cheap items. If you are looking for antiques, buy from reputed shops.

The Chinatown Food Street is occupied by numerous hawker stalls selling a variety of Chinese and eastern dishes. The Food Street is quite popular and is worth a try.
You can also find here Chinese temples along with Hindu temples and mosques. Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, Sri Mariamman Temple and Jamae Mosque are on South Bridge Road .

The streets are always packed and very vibrant too. Outram Park, Raffles Palace and Clarke Quay are all within walking distance. You can reach here by MRT, public bus or cabs."
,,Chinese Street Food At It BEST,5.0,,"Wow....we had heard that coming to the food street was a MUST. It was so easy to find the perfect dish of what you wanted. You can choose from the pictures:) There were four of us and we chose from different vendors. Don't worry about getting ""street food"" here. It is the cleanest place and has a reputation for that. Come at NIGHT. Sit and watch the crowds. There are MANY locals! Order a Chinese or Thai beer to go with the tasty food. And make an evening of this. We did come back during the day to see the different historical sites and the great selections in the shops. We tried some EXPENSIVE restaurants but the food here was the closest that you would get in China for the cheapest price. Love it."
,,Festive!,5.0,,"With the Chinese New Year just 2 days away, the crowd seems to have thinned out. Everyone must have completed their shopping, leaving only the stragglers to grab at last minute bargains. There was no queue at Lim Chee Guan! Tarts were going for 3 for the price of 1 at Fragrance!"
,,An interesting place with a super museum,4.0,,"Highly recommend a visit to savour the different atmosphere to the rest of Singapore. The Museum of Chinese heritage (recently opened) is well worth a visit, for a small charge you get a really good insight into life in Chinatown's past."
,,Modern Chinese feel,4.0,,"I have always loved going to Chinatown since young, because there's lots of interesting chinese cultural stuff to look at. Especially during Chinese New Year period. The place is getting more commercial, but there's always the Chinese cultural aspects to look at. Worth looking to see traditions and modernity blending together."
,,Loved the buzz!,4.0,,"This area offers a fantastic contrast to 'normal' Singapore, you are instantly transported to China Town life and all the markets and stalls are simply humming! Great way to loose yourself for an hour or two whether you want to shop or just enjoy!"
,,Colour and Life,5.0,,"We had a great time wandering through Chinatown and feeling like we were truly in Asia with a feeling of wealth mixed in with a developing country feel. Great food, awesome atmosphere."

Chinatown is good place for shopping... u can find economical items... but dont miss Chinatown Food Street and do try chinese food. Also visit Peoples Park at Chinatown."
,,CHINATOWN FOOD STREET,5.0,,"During a recent visit to Singapore, my wife and I ate at one of the street food places on Chinatown Food Street. I ate a delicious lunch of soup, duck and rice for about £3. The young guy who took the meet off the duck was such a professional and the food was just lovely. Sitting at one of the tables with a Tiger beer watching the world go by, a great pit stop.

So, if you are at all worried about eating street food, or are put off by the name Chinatown Food Street, don't be. It is cheap and it is way better than cheerful, it is fantastic. You can't beat it.

,,A Flavour of Singapore and Great for Street Photography,4.0,,"If you've been to other Chinatowns around the world, the basic idea is somewhat similar. Perhaps some of the highlights in Singapore's Chinatown are the fresh foods market (wet market) and the hawker food centre above the market.

Singapore is well known for its food. And there's no better place to start than the Chinatown Hawker Food Centre. You know it's good when there are queues of locals. Don't be fooled by the no frills looks of the place. Singapore boasts a very high level of food hygiene. And for foreign guests, what makes it easier is the hygiene ratings that are mandatorily displayed at each of the hawker food stalls. Go for those rated 'A', 'B' or 'C'. Bear in mind that the passing standard is 'D'. And... Don't mistake Singapore's Hawker Food Centres for dirty street food that you get in some other parts of the world. Hawker Food Centres is where you see many senior executives have their lunch.. Complete with the suit and ties sometimes...

After having a good meal, take a walk.. First building you'll see nearby is the Buddha Tooth Relic temple. Believers can pray there. I'm not, so what interests me is the classic Chinese architecture and the lanterns that hang from the buildings. Nearby are streets of touristy souvenirs and other normal shops.

If you're a kitchen gadget-geek like me, there's a large kitchenware shop called 'Sia Huat' nearby. If it's your first time in Singapore, stop by ""Bak Kwa"" shops and buy a few slices of roasted sweet pork slices. They're delicious and a must-have of Singaporean Chinese during the Chinese New Year season.

Further down the road is a Hindu temple called the ""Sri Mariamman Temple"". They're open to visits by people from all walks of faith. But be respectful. Take off your shoes and place them neatly near the entrance. Just do what the locals do.

Right beside the Hindu Temple is a Muslim Mosque named ""Masjid Jamae"". Singapore's a multi-cultural, multi-religious country. We're happy having our brothers and sisters of other faiths right next door. It's how Singapore is."
,,Visit the street market,3.0,,"Chinatown's street market is fantastic! Get in there, start walking around looking for souvenirs and the most important, get lost in between all the fruit, spices and tea stalls! In my opinion it is a must for tourists who want to take a nice souvenir home!"
,,"After 40 years, this is the Singapore we remember",4.0,,"We just sampled a couple of lanes shortly before Chinese New Year. This is Singapore at its best. Chinese market bisecting a Hindu temple and a mosque. Beautiful. We ate good quality, well prepared, tasty street food.

Be prepared for oppressive heat, crowds, smells and ""atmosphere"""
,,"Small, easy to navigate",5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is crowded and easy to navigate. There are many good bargains here. Also, see the temple. It's different from most others you'll visit."

,,Couldn´t move,3.0,,"On the night that we visited Chinatown there was some sort of special event on and it was basically impossible to move anywhere without being carried away in a sea of people. We asked the taxi driver on the way back to the hotel and he said that it had something to do with Chinese New Year even though new year was still a month away. I have heard many good things about Chinatown in the past and would love to return when it is not so busy so as to experience the many wonderful things that it has to offer,"
,,3 for 10 in Chinatown,3.0,,"Shopping for cheap souvenirs seems to be the main attraction here and the beautifully painted old rowhouses are left in shadow of the loud commerce. I managed to find hand painted pure silk kimonos for 35 sgp amidst all the polyester, the next shop was asking 150 sgp for the same garment. Going through several 3 for 10 stalls I also bought nice glass beads in bright colours and a Gardens by the Bay t-shirt for 4 sgp. I took a coffee and slice of green spongecake at a traditional chinese coffeehouse with small wooden tables popular with local male office workers."
,,Good food and buys,4.0,,"We rode the bus in front of Ibis Hotel. The streets were full of people shopping for Chinese New Year. Everyone was excited to buy stuff like bakwa or pork meat, fruits, trinkets and charms for luck. Such busy streets!"
,,Unlike Chinatowns in other countries - worth a look see,4.0,,I spent a rainy afternoon in Singapore recently ducking into temples and shops and restaurants as I navigated my way through Chinatown. Because this is Singapore - everything was immaculately clean and people were very very friendly. Loved it.
,,Little China !!,3.0,,"Visited Chinatown one night after getting off from the MRT. Had a dinner for a wayside eatery of Original noodles & prawn. The street was teeming with many tourists and the whole street was filled by them & eating places, Didnt shop."

,,China Town and Chinese New Year,4.0,,"Very busy and vibrant location. Chinese New Year , made the visit extra special, with the colourful decorations."

,,Great fun to wander around,5.0,,Lots of cheap souvenirs in crowded streets of China town. Food good value. Great to wander around and soak up the atmosphere
,,China Town A must,4.0,,"Singapores China Town is packed with Market stalls , shops , food stalls and dine in Resturants , a place the whole family can go and there is something for every one from clothes , jewellery , shoes , it's all there and you can't go past some of the food it's everywhere , traditional Bbq meats to spicey hot curries , seafood , it's a must"
,,Great place for suits and silks,4.0,,This is a great place. There are a lot of tailors around for suits and shirts. They also have some nice silk kimonos and dressing gowns which are fairly inexpensive but really lovely. Not too big to get around.
,,A place for wonderful food and shopping for souvenirs,5.0,,We have been there twice and it never ceases to amaze us as the colours change frequently. This time they were preparing for the Chinese New Year so the shops were full of items for that festival.
,,Local cultural and colonial buildings,5.0,,"Went there a week before CNY so the place was in its full swing with Spring Festival Market. Love the local way and festive decoration here though, i lost the way. Great place to observe local life and try local food."
,,Nothing special.,3.0,,VERY VERY crowded. Just like all China towns. Nothing seen out of the ordinary. Be wary of pick pockets.
,,Touristy,4.0,,This place is lively but really it's a giant tourist trap as all of the goods the are selling are of low quality
,,Go with the Flow,4.0,,"I wouldn't dream of being in Singapore , and NOT spending an hour or three amongst the crowds in Chinatown . Sure , it's packed with shops and stalls selling tacky souvenirs of Singapore , and you could be pestered by importunate shop keepers determined to sell you their wares ( haggle if they do ! ) , but that's an essential part of the Singapore experience . It's FUN ! But you can find ''gold'' amidst the dross , sometimes . And boy , can you eat ! If nowhere else , try the range of meals available at the Chinatown Complex on Smith Street , or use one of the multitude of eateries available to you . I always start by first dropping into the Peoples Park Complex by Chinatown station . Definitely non-touristy , and some great fixed price bargains to be had here , plus more , if haggling is on the cards .
If I'm ever asked in Chinatown ''Where you from ?'' I always take that to indicate that some enjoyable bargaining is on the cards ! On our recent visit my partner was offered a gold chain in Pagoda Street marked at over $1000 , but the price eventually fell to under $400 before we finally declined to purchase the article .
And , while in Chinatown , be sure to visit the museum of Singapore's early history . It's truly a gem .
Chinatown ? Love it , just love it !"
,,Colourful and Lively,4.0,,"I visited this place with a local friend of mine. I like the eating places here, lots of variety and reasonable cost. The shops are also very pretty with lots of stuff to but as soveigners from here."
,,The year of Monkey,4.0,,"The decorations this year was the nicest I ever seen.

The whole 500 meters of the main road full of lit up Monkeys holding pink Chinese peaches was very cute.

It was super busy tonight in each alleys.

Lots of choices of all types of Chinese foods."
,,First timer on festive Pre-Chinese New Year!,5.0,,"The streets were packed with food stalls from assortment of peanuts to assortments of dried fruit and jellys from Taiwan, it just amazing. Throngs of people around looking for the best bargain they can grab. Wondering how it would be on the CNY day itself!"
,,What an experience,5.0,,"Jammed into an historic part of Singapore, Chinatown has all the hustle & bustle of its larger counterparts in other parts of the world. If you are looking for cheap tourist trinkets then this is your place. Ripoff merchandise is not abundant due to Singapore laws. A fun experience."
,,Great ambiance,5.0,,"Nice place to stroll around the streets and great place to do great shopping at great prices,do not hesitate to go there and discover the food street also."
,,Food and local stuff,4.0,,Nice place for tourists. Good food opportunities on Smith street. Tintin shop hidden along a market street.
,,vivid place,5.0,,I have stayie in a hotel situated in Chinatow and I can say that it's a very vivid and animated place. You can buy suvenirs for a fair price.
,,Good Walking Tour,4.0,,"You can see and experience most of Chinatown in about 4 hours. It is rather compact and can be easily accessed by the MRT. We started at the Sri Mariamman Temple on South Bridge and Pagoda. Bring socks as you must shed shoes if you want to tour the temple. Proceed up Pagoda St which now houses countless street vendors selling all sorts of cheap souvenirs and custom tailor shops willing to make anything for you. Tried to visit the Heritage Center but it was closed for 2 days for a private party---must have been a good to last that long!!!Turned left on Trengganu which was lined with shops and restaurants---guess these were the shophouses they talk about. Walked down Smith St which has wall to wall food vendors. Turned back onto SBridge and toured the Newer Buddha Tooth Temple before touring Temple Street. The day we were there it was oppressively hot and humid but we spent an interesting 3 hours taking in the sights, sounds and smells of one of Singapore's top tourist attractions."
,,Always interesting,5.0,,"On every visit to Singapore I like to visit Chinatown. There is shopping for those who are interested. But my interest are the Chinese New year decoration, food, and Chinese Herb and Medicine Shops."
,,Chinatown,5.0,,One of my favourite places here is OG. You can access OG very easily by MRT as it is just outside the MRT. There are also lots of little shops that are like a maze just outside OG.

,,A must! Period. You have to visit Singapore Chinatown,5.0,,"Always a must to visit Chinatown in any city. But here in Singapore it feels like you are in China! All the crowd of locals shopping and tourist alike make this place fascinating. Eat at the outdoor food court on Smith St. Cheap and delicious. Don't forget to get a Fresh squeezed Sugar Cane drink, very refreshing on a hot day. Buy some lop chong (chines sausage ) or the bbq pork slices! delicious."
,,A Must!,5.0,,"Fabulous place wih great people , great bargains as everyone seems open to some haggling and you will be absolutely spoilt for choice of delicious and cheap food."
,,Best place to stroll around,5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is a fantastic place to stroll around and enjoy the colorful and scentful life. It's busy, but it is also very nice, it just feels good.
You can find some good deals on all kinds of stuff, but be aware that also fakes are sold here.
It's just an experience you definitely shouldn't miss!"
,,Lots of Attractions Nearby,4.0,,"Great atmosphere here, culturally beautiful. As you leave the MRT station, there are many stalls selling souvenir items along the walking street. Nearby there are both Buddhist and Hindu temples and mosques that you can visit. Some old historical shop houses have very interesting architecture. Also many eateries, especially Chinese food."
,,Eat & Purchase,4.0,,"I went to ChinaTown to try their food and experience the boutiques inside the compound, upon arriving I noticed that the location is spacious and the parking space was big enough for tourists and locals as well. I first went and try their food! the White Chicken with Rice was the best here.. you wouldn't need any more condiment because of its natural taste. foods here are fresh! then I went to the boutiques, they have so many stuffs but i bought too many in Bugis already so I decided not to buy anything there anymore and it is quite expensive too. but this is where locals and travelers meet so I suggest you try to visit this area."
,,Total Chaos,3.0,,"Not for the faint hearted! It’s Total Chaos. Thousands of people milling around. It's full of restaurants, shops and market stalls. Selling almost every thing you can think off. Very colourful."
,,Overwhelming (in the best possible way)!,4.0,,"Chinatown assails your senses: the colour, the sights, the sounds and the smells. It is mainly about shops and food, but we managed to see a kids' talent competition as well. Just stroll around and soak it up!"
,,Excellent but crowded,5.0,,It's the best place if you looking for purchasing some Chinese local stuff and affordable souvenirs. It's best enjoyed during late night hours but it's super crowded. You get everything from food products to clothes to souvenirs .. Just keep your purse/wallet close to you at all times :).
,,One of the best place to shop in Singapore.,4.0,,"Singapore is a diversely populated with people from different race and the best part to experience everything Chinese is no other than in ChinaTown. Pack with different shops and restaurant nearby, ChinaTown is definitely a must go in Singapore. It is here where you can buy some cheap souvenirs and experience authentic Chinese Singaporean style. Don't forget to try Chinese food, it is fantastic."
,,Souvenirs !!,4.0,,Visit this place to buy little tokens of singapore for your loved ones back home.. A good place for tourists
,,Good Shopping,4.0,,"I always visit Chinatown when visiting S'pore. There's lots of good shopping and many great places to enjoy a good meal. There are several shops along the main road selling dried beef/pork/chicken and I recommend giving it a try. If you have cash that you need to exchange for local (Singapore dollars, Chinatown has the best exchange rates you'll find anywhere. If you plan your vacation during the 2-3 weeks leading up to Chinese New Year, then you must come here for the decorations and other festivities."
,,Cheapest,4.0,,"Chinatown has the cheapest in terms of souvenir items. Cheaper to buy here rather than going to Bugis Street. They have variety of shops from souvenirs, clothing, shoes, bags, silk, perfume and a lot more. Some stores have fix price and some stores allow you to bargain. After shopping, go to the food court nearby and snack some yummy Chinese food."
,,CLEAN....,4.0,,"Has the buzz of Chinatowns around the world but oh so clean !! Good array of bars-food with the usual array of touristy shops selling stuff one wonders who actually buys it !
However with careful looking there are some excellent buys notably the shop selling handcrafted brushes and combs which my companion took full advantage of !"
,,Crowded and Cheap things!,4.0,,You go Singapore and want to find cheap things? or you wanna walk along the crowded place? Then chinatown is your best choice. Very crowded especially when Chinese New Year is coming along. Should visit this place when you come Singapore.
,,"Dynamic, Colorful, but not so different from the rest of Singapore",3.0,,"Sure, it is colorful, vibrant, has a great atmosphere, and all that. But the whole point of a Chinatown is to re-create a mini-China in a foreign land. Considering that Singapore is mainly Chinese anyway, it doesn't come as something very different. Not a must-see attraction (unless there is a major Chinese festival), but you an pass through on your way to some other attraction like the Harbourfront."
,,Chinese!,4.0,,"What can you say about any China town, anywhere? With the Chinese New Year just around the corner as of typing this it would be an excellent venue to take in the atmosphere of a Chinese spectacle."
,,Interesting place to go,4.0,,"Very interesting place to go, though you shouldn't expect a real piece of China - it's not! China still is very different from even this part of Singapore;)"
,,Just For Tourists,4.0,,"We try and avoid the Chinatown main walkways that are filled with the usual tourist trinkets but instead seek out some of the wonderful restaurants down the side streets. If you do the Food Street thing, avoid 6pm to 8pm and go after that. You will get a table and get your food quicker."
,,Chinatown,5.0,,Explore Chinatown and read the plaques to check some history of the place. Many temples from different religions hence if you want to immense to different cultures visit here.
,,Morning wondering around,5.0,,What a gemto find great for tourist shopping along with some tasty restaurants. Visited the Chinatown visitors centre right there in the mall interesting and staff really friendly .
,,As Chinatown,5.0,,"We visited at the end on january, so city is already decorated for new year celebrations. Very nice. Good food. On the street market products sold were mostly junk."
,,Just another Chinatown,3.0,,I didn't really see any cultural significance in the area. Plenty of stalls selling just about the same thing that you would find at any other street market in Singapore.
,,A Gem to Explore,5.0,,"This is a unique area of Singapore with plenty of shops, restaurants and bars. Sit and enjoy a beer and watch the day go by. The Hawker Centre is a real eye opener but this is true life in every aspect. Good quality souvenirs at realistic prices."
,,Fun if you are in the area,3.0,,"I won't say this is a ""must see"" as it is a pretty sanitized experience. It can feel a little hectic around lunch time when tourist flock in and would be a good spot to postcards for a good deal (5 for $2 SG).

We had fresh coconuts for $1 ea. but make sure to ask for a spoon :)

I would recommend the food hawker centre close by, ""around the corner"" from the Buddha's Tooth Temple and eat some fried rice with chicken!"
,,Colorful part of Singapore,5.0,,China town is the chaotic colorful part of Singapore. It is at its best during the Chinese new year when the shops wear some extra layers of colors. Good place to do souvenir shopping and visit some Buddha temples.
,,Great atmosphere,5.0,,"We visited just before Chinese New Year. The streets are crowed with activity...so much fun! Great food, wonderful people, affordable souvenirs, and VERY safe."
,,You MUST see the Singapore China Town -,4.0,,The Singapore China town is a very lively place and always worth a visit. I have been there several times before and always like to go back!!
,,Great place to wander and grab a bite to eat,4.0,,"Plenty of market sellers, interesting buildings and restaurants to keep you amused for a couple of hours and topped up with food!"
,,Seedy and cheap,3.0,,Interesting to wander round the place for a little while but we're not really keen on Chinese type food nor garish brightly coloured or gold items so no for us.
,,One stop center,3.0,,"Chinatown is one of the most busy part of Singapore. Nowadays the Chinatown is getting bigger, including the surroundings.
Here we can see chinese heritage culture in Singapore, also can see famous Sri Mariaman Temple.
We can also find and buy souvenirs.
Food food and food... Culinary journey along the road.
It is a very complete place and you can find almost anything you need here.
Unfortunately in some spot, not so clean."
,,Great experiences,5.0,,We did a guided tour on a double decker bus in the evening so whilst we didnt spend much time in china town itself we got to see the spectacular lights that were on display for chinese new year. There was beautiful architecture in chinatown and the smells from the market were amazing. I strongly recommend visiting chinatown!
,,Like a Chinatown should be,4.0,,"This is what a Chinatown should be. Crowded streets, markets, food everywhere and an atmosphere. You find all of this in Chinatown here. And don't forget all the lanterns, characteristic for Chinatown. I just loved it. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Markets are a Experiance,4.0,,"Go to go when the weekend Markets are on, great experience wandering through looking at all the stall's. Very crowded though, but if you can put up with it, you will find a bargain along the way."
,,Chinatown,5.0,,"Chinatown one of the best place to buy a key chain, t shirt or any singapore souvenirs or gifts.. you can see that this place has a colourful hanging lantern. My tips, don't forget to take a selfie :)"
,,MUST DO THE HISTORY WALK,4.0,,"If you go to China town you MUST do the history walk through with 'The Original Singapore walks"" find at information centre. At least do the Heritage Centre. Very interesting. China town has lost some of its bartering and authentic food stalls. but still interesting to walk through"
,,Old meets new,5.0,,Great selection of new restaurants and loads of atmosphere of old Singapore. Certainly worthy of a couple of days just walking around. Look out for the first food hall in Singapore and the new western eateries like Burnt Ends and Meat Smith.
,,Another Chinatown,4.0,,"Pretty much just another Chinatown, but none the less worth the visit and a look. Lots of shops, some cheap and nasty but a variety of all sorts and good restaurants to choose from. There wasn't a lot happening at the time of day we visited (morning), but preparations for Chinese New Year were underway so perhaps there would have been more excitement / entertainment at night."
,,Busy and great atmosphere,4.0,,"We got the hop on hop off SIA bus here and the stop is so close. Good place for souvenirs but we went here for the street food, there are so many different food stalls it is hard to chose from but we did and wasn't disappointed."
,,no fiesta atmosphere for CNY this time,3.0,,"we took the time visiting the China town on our recent trip in Jan 2016 and hoping to experience a chinese new year festivity atmosphere as we had in the year 2014 , where the Eu tong sen road was covered with very nice ornament and lampions with a very distinctive ambience.
But we did still enjoy the durian pancake for S$2.- each and also one of the cheapest Erdinger weiss beer for S$ 6.50 for a bottle 500 ml, which is a real bargain.
And we did some shopping in the OG dep store that you may buy some chocolates, cookies and snick snack with a reasonable prices.
there is a lot of eateries that you may try but mostly with chinese dishiest offer.
If you are looking out of the box tourist destination, then this is a place you may enjoy."
,,Good,4.0,,"Totally enjoyed it. We took our time and went into most of the shops, and brought a lot of items to take home. Kids enjoyed it. Would do again"
,,WOW!!!!,5.0,,"I thought I'd find this place to be filled with cheap, loud coloured things. Very far from it! It's a huge place! Lots of interesting merchandise to offer. It was clean. Lots of food options. Visitors will be spoiled for choices with regards to souvenirs to take back home."
,,Organised chaos,4.0,,We took the MRT to China Town & instantly we were caught up in the crowds gently pushing us through the street. Being a Saturday night I assume it was busier than usual. The restaurant we were recommended was booked out so we continued the busy walk through China Town & decided to go to Clarke Quay. The shopping in China Town is not for us but it was interesting!
,,Crowded but a good atmosphere,4.0,,"You can buy everything u need in Chinatown, souvenirs, food, clothes... Very colorful area, nice kind locals and very yumm food ;)"
,,a flavor of china in singapore,5.0,,"nice place for shopping, clean place and cheap items, but very crowded coz chinese new year is soon! food were all delicous! i like the mee goreng food in sinagpore spicy and yummy!"
,,FUN WALK.....,5.0,,"Central, easy to get too....Fun couple of hours walking around... and you must try something on the food street.... great buzz.... interesting display of several cuisines.... always find something to buy in China Town... Snacks, Gadgets..... it's a true Singapore Gem and definitely a visit should you have the time...."
,,Worth a look but watch the chillies,4.0,,Chinese New Year very busy but spectacular with the light and lanterns. Worth having a bite and a look. Watch out for those festy chillies they can be hazardous to your health. Easy to get a cab the cabs are cheap here
,,Chinatown.,3.0,,"I have been here for a while and really, it is not as great as many tourists and Singaporeans say it is.

Honestly, mostly I find most things in Chinatown do not stand out It is nice enough, especially at this time of year, but after walking (following the wife and kids) around for a bit it becomes boring.

OK, probably I am not good at shopping."
,,Night time visit during New Year celebrations,5.0,,"We visited the bustling street markets of Chinatown during the New Year Celebrations and the atmosphere was great.

There are many souvenirs and other goods available, but it was the food stalls I found most interesting. From the smoked goods (sausages, ducks, chicken) to the fruit, nuts and seeds - it was a sight to see.

You do need to be aware of pickpockets and there are plenty of warning signs - I did encounter a person who sidled up to me and tried - but had nothing in my pockets and was conscious of him there and on loudly 'hay'-ing him, he quickly moved away. My teenage kids were a bit more concerned after that. As the signs say, so keep hold of your bags and keep them in front of you.

Apart from that, our night trip to Chinatown, with all of the Year of the Monkey lighting, was wonderful and definitely worth seeing."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"I didn't get to see that much of Chinatown last visit to Singapore, and what I saw didn't really interest me so I wasn't that excited to return, but my friend who was visiting Singapore for the first time insisted that we go. I did, and I'm so thankful to my friend because I don't know what I saw last time, but I definitely didn't see the good part of it. It was beautiful, some of the shophouses were incredibly beautiful, I found the markets (don't know where they got to last time...lol), and we found the Buddha Tooth Relic Museum which was amazing. It was all new to me and it was fantastic. There are some great market stalls, some have very similar things and you can search for a good price and haggle. Lots of food and places to stop and have a cold drink and easy to get to. It was very busy, but that was OK, you expect that in such a great place. Singapore is one of my favourite places to visit and you definitely need a good chunk of time there to explore everything. I can't wait to go again."
,,The infrastructure was interesting,3.0,,"The infrastructure here is dominantly Chinese (from the name should be explanation enough). The Sri Mariamman temple sticks out quite unexpectedly though. Also good if you wanna buy Chinese food cheaply and souvenirs. But to be honest for me, the area was a bit boring."
,,lovely,4.0,,Love the china town anywhere.. good shopping considering singapore is costly. great food options also
,,"Very Touristy, but worth a visit",3.0,,"A riot of noise, smells and colour. We have been here many times, this time with my sister and brother-in-law to show the must do sites of Singapore. Worth the visit for the atmosphere, but would come every time I came to Singapore."
,,A lot of Pasalubong stuff,3.0,,"This is where we always go if where travelling back to Philippines. A lot of Stuff to buy (souvenirs, bag, robe, pens, mug, etc) it's so cheap there. 5 or 6 bags = 10 SGD! Try to negotiate. Food is fantastic as well."
,,A slow boat to China,5.0,,"I am not fond of tourist places but in Chinatown it brings a whole new meaning of turning back the clock. Things are cheap in Chinatown - I initially went to People's Park centre to make glasss, VG opticals are one of the cheapest and most reliable optical shops. Next door s Chinatown that has a feel and warmth of Chinese hospitality. A place not to be mssd."
,,Vibrant place,4.0,,"This was on our to do list. We came across an aged Chinese man who told us the history behind the place and explained the ""four streets"" to us"
,,Great shopping,5.0,,Chinatown has something for everyone. Has lots of great bargains and also offers free wifi. Chinatown also has its own train stop so its easy to get too.
,,Busy but fun great chilli crab and Tiger beer,4.0,,These markets were good fun. Lots of stall selling similar items so dontbuy from first obe you see and always bargin. My husband is not really a market person so we found a cafe tbat had cold tiger beer and chilli crab and he sat while I shopped and every so often boughg the parcels back for him to mind.
,,China town,4.0,,"Great atmosphere but very little of interest to actually buy, typical market stuff. Very crowded and hot. Not realy a lot else to say."
,,Chinatown is Chinatown,3.0,,"Honestly, I think Chinatown is pretty much the same in nearly every city I have ever been to. Some good cheap bargains available if you care to sift through all the stalls. Some Chinese temples with a backdrop of skyscrapers. All good though... people are friendly and easy to get to with the MRT."
,,Hot and bustling,5.0,,"Just what you expect as Chinatown prepares for new year. Bright decorations adorn the streets, lots of stalls selling monkey charms, delicious food smells everywhere. Well worth a visit"
,,Good Atmosphere,5.0,,"Visited a few times on our recent visit to Singapore. Very crowded on a Sunday afternoon, but great atmosphere. Lots of shops selling everything imaginable. No drainage in the streets so can get a lot of water when it rains. At the end of the stalls is Smith Street Hawker Centre, which is touristy, but excellent. Also, drop into the tourist information centre for maps, advice, tickets etc. They are very helpful. The is a food court with over 230 stalls at the end of Chinatown, upstairs. Very cheap food, geared towards locals. Downstairs, men sit and play Chess and other games under the shade of the trees. Well worth a visit, lots to see in this area. The MRT station brings you straight out into Chinatown."
,,Chinatown Singapore,4.0,,Lots of shops here selling different things to do with Chinese New Year. Also some small eateries around. Worth a look for some shopping or just to do some sightseeing!
,,Good place,4.0,,"U will find all the souvenir u will need it from Singapore with very good price , u can reach Chinatown by metro station . It will take 2 hours to do shopping there"
,,Fantastic food and shopping!,5.0,,"Singapore is a third Chinese, so the options for authentic Chinese food are a plenty. Just walk down the streets and follow your nose, you can't go wrong, or go to to Maxwell road food center for the national dish--Chicken rice."
,,“truely colorful..”,5.0,,"When we went there,, it's mid day... it's colorful festoon, road street food really delicious.. specially fruits. If you feel young, then going there."
,,Pleasant Experience,5.0,,"We had travelled extensively while in Singapore and finally made it to Chinatown. Our original perception of cheap junk was dispelled as we found shops with really good quality merchandise. The vendors are keen to sell but not as pushy as we experienced in ""little India""."
,,Typical China Town - shopping and Dim Sum,4.0,,Very typical China Town that you will find in most cities these days. There is some shopping here and food places.
,,Super,5.0,,"Best approached by Metro. Many eateries all serving excellent Chinese fare made Singapore style. If you are a Book lover, do not miss the Tin Tin shop and buy some memorabilia and take pictures including selfies. As usual all kinds of everything and needs about half a day to really make the trip worthwhile."
,,China Town Singapore,5.0,,"It worth a look but only if you have the time as there are so many things to do and see in Singapore , Photo , drinks, food"
,,Color and festivity riot on Chinese New Year,4.0,,Happen to visit the place during the Chinese New Year. It was a stampede with MRT halted due to excessive no of takers. There were fireworks and a colorful parade with specialized goat cutouts everywhere to welcome the year of goat. If you dont like crowded place.. this is not your cup of tea. Definitely not during Chinese New Year
,,Hustle and bustle!,4.0,,"Visited here during Chinese New Year celebrations. Everywhere packed with people. Loved all the hustle and bustle. Would recommend visiting one of the many soft drink stalls and trying a sour plum drink. Amazing, like nothing I've tasted before, delicious. Good for shopping."

,,As good as it gets,5.0,,"Singapore Chinatown is a great place to shop for the usual cheap Chinese products, nock-off clothes, and souvenirs. The restaurant scene is fantastic and varied and includes the ever-present hawker courts for cheap, but delicious, eats. Easy access by bus or MRT and walkable if you'e staying downtown, on Clark Quay, etc. Great at night around Christmas or Chinese New Year."
,,Fun,4.0,,Fun and buzzing place with some open air stalls (arrived in the lead up to new year). More 'real' than orchard road and shows the energy and real action of life in Singapore.
,,Great to Visit,4.0,,"Lots of colourful buildings. Lots of choices of places to eat. Most are good, but be wary of those who try to lure you in. We found some of the best were at the top of the market. Not trendy but good food cheap."

There are also many shops that sell various items such as fabrics, food, souvenirs, and so much more. There is a big buddha Temple there."
,,Good fun,5.0,,"There are very few parts of singapore that are not new and quite western. Chinatown is one of them. We didn't really know where to go, but started in Newbridge Rd and quickly found little alley ways and side streets. Bought some gorgeous lacquerware, stunning chopsticks and Chinese pyjamas for the little kids.
In the area there are a number of absolutely beautiful older buildings, painted in great colours.
Have a 5 hour stop over in singapore in February this year, we will use it to go to Chinatown, which is a half hour taxi ride from Changi airport.
Recommended"

,,Amazing Chinatown!,5.0,,"I'll preface this by saying that the Chinatown in my home town is full of poverty, illegal activities, and homeless people so perhaps I'm biased, but

This place was amazing! Very large, lots of booths full of fun knick knacks, clothes, and souvenirs, and cheap and delicious food. This also had some of the cheapest beer we've seen in this exorbitant prices for liquor city. I'd definitely recommend a visit!"

,,Not bad,4.0,,Great area for food and buying items for cheap. gets very busy here during Chinese New Year so best to avoid them times if you hate large crowds
,,One of the highlights of our trip to Singapore,4.0,,We visited at night and had a wander around. We went the day before the start of Chinese new year which the taxi driver we met highly recommended. Plenty of cheap shops in the markets and everyone seemed really nice. There were a lot of signs up regarding pick pockets but we had no trouble. China town is also really close to a lot of shopping centres if you're into that.
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,Enjoyed wandering though the stalls and the hustle and bustle of Chinatown. Definitely worth a visit. Lots to see. Had enjoyable meal there and beer well priced.
,,If you like chinese food,5.0,,"This is the place that is worth to go in singapore.

When I went there for a week I spent most of my time eating there. Its more expensive then china for sure but you could find pretty much everything.

Hotpot, noodle like in china (not only hongkong taste)"
,,Shopping,5.0,,"You can buy anything from here. They are super cheappp, you can get 42 key chains just only with 10 SGD :D
And near the Pagoda Street, you also find a buiding with the foodcourt on the second floor. They sell Chinese and Malaysia food. but I think Chinese one is better"
,,Good to visit,4.0,,Chinatown was a good place to visit but the stalls and shops are a bit repetitive . The food is great and not too dear. Take a look for the fish heads and chicken feet in the restaurants. Not to my taste though
,,Great place to watch the world go by,5.0,,I love it down in China town lots of little stalls with Trinkets and gift. We like to sit in one of the bars and watch the world go by and the chilly mud crabs look amazing (Bit toooo Hot for me)
,,Good shopping and restaurants in China Town,5.0,,Had a great time shopping in the Chinatown area. There are lots of indoor restaurants as well as food kiosks.
,,Lively and bubbly,4.0,,"I love going to Chinatown whenever I go to Singapore. Such a lively and vibrant place. It is not only shopping place but a nice place to walk down the lanes and have food in the eateries. They are very reasonable prices. The area was getting decorated for the coming Chinese New Year. So, it was very bright and colourful with lots of chinese decors. Things are much cheaper than elsewhere in Singapore.Going to Chinatown is also very easy by SMRT."
,,Chinatown with flavour ~ eat well and very cheap,5.0,,"Singapore is quite cosmopolitan with a vast number of different cultures co-existing but obviously dominant Chinese population.
Typical Chinatown setup but the food is amazing and it is was Singapore is renowned for and the Hawker setup is just teaming with locals all lining up to get the best noodles, fishball soup and dumplings they can get their hands on for very small cost. I fed family of four for AUD15. I love this place and will revisit for the quality not just the minimal cost."
,,Have an open mind,2.0,,"Chinatown wasn't my favourite place to be. It was very hot (seemed hotter than City Central) and there were things that they were serving up at Cafe's and Restaurants that you forever want to block out of your head. Its not for everyone, but i am sure there are some people that would love it here. It is also easy to access via the MRT as Chinatown is a station itself."
,,nothing's China about it,4.0,,"Chinatown is nothing really about China, and it is not a town. It's an area of a few streets for things Chinese..with shops selling souvenirs, eating places. However it is a one-stop to bring foreign friends to experience some food from China-Sichuan, Beijing, culture (chinese tea, dragon robes, chopsticks, oriental looking fans..). This place is livelier before Chinese Lunar New Year in January/early February. You can enjoy the lights. Go at evening times when it is less hot! Visit the food centre instead if you want local Singapore food."
,,Chinese New Year festive moods building up,4.0,,"I was at the Chinatown in the morning at one can even feel the CNY mood is already beginning to build up. Stores and shops alike are ready for the biggest festival season in Singapore. Festival trimmings, deco, lightings in Red and Gold colours are everywhere around the streets and corners of this place. I guess the evening when they are lighted up and more stores set up selling various New Year goodies to add on the festive mood and to welcome the new zodiac Monkey to 2016 !!"

,,Loved it here,4.0,,"Two hours after arriving in Singapore, we decided to leave our things at our host's place and decided to roam around for a bit. The initial plan was to visit Little India but we ended up in Chinatown instead. The area consists of restaurants and stalls selling cheap souvenir items. We checked out several shirt designs but decided not to buy anything until we get to visit Bugis. All that roaming around made us hungry so we decided to get something to eat. We ordered two bowls of beef brisket noodle and watered it down with Tiger beer. The surrounding buildings (with different colors) also made our visit interesting.The food and beer was also great."
,,Cheap Eats,4.0,,"Great for cheap eats around the area, heaps of options to choose from and finding souvenirs for last minute gifts for home."

,,"Fascinating & very safe area for food, shopping, museums",5.0,,"Great location with economical small hotels, loads of atmosphere & convenient to public transport, both bus & subway. Food street & the night market were interesting & if you follow the sound of music at night there is a plaza with community dancing. The dumpy-looking museum of the history of the revitalization of Singapore was very interesting, there is a beautiful Hindu temple & I expected a quick run-thru of he Buddah Tooth pagoda but it was incredible & I Spent about 2 hours!"
,,Chinatown Charm,5.0,,"Searching for great bargains on things you never thought even existed? Chinatown is the place you want to go! Walking out of the Chinatown MRT, you arrive straight in the heart of a bustling street market, full of tourists and Singaporeans alike. We walked down the street until we got to Smith Street, which is considered Chinatown's 'Food Street'. Taking a right turn we headed to Chinatown Food Complex which is pretty much invisible from afar, as it just looks like a car park building. But it is a foodcourt - the biggest in Singapore apparently - and sells the usual items of food at the usual low prices. On our way back to the MRT, we ventured into many of the stalls and bought a few knick knacks to take home as souvenirs."

Most people will queue in the kind of noodle or seafood stall."
,,"Great atmosphere, great shopping",4.0,,"Looking for shopping or authentic food in an absolutely authentic atmosphere then Chinatown is for you no matter what you are looking to buy you will find bargains everywhere but don't forget to haggle for that little extra off. And if it's great food you are after you will find that here too, go with an open mind and enjoy it all."

,,a night in china town,5.0,,We did a tour which included a walking tour around chinatown a meal and then some free time to roam the markets followed by a rickshaw ride and then a bumboat ride from Clarke quay down the river to the marina to see the lights and sounds of Singers at night. whole thing was great value and a heap of fun
,,A Typical Chinatown,4.0,,"I have been to Chinatown in every city I have visited that has one. This one has is among the most authentic ones I have seen.

Hawkers are not pushy- let patrons enter their stalls without hassle. Heritage Centre soon to open. Excited vibe January/February in preparation for Chinese New Year. love to go at night."
,,One Indian Food Stall as well !!,3.0,,"The Food street is between the Temple and Smith Street has a 4 lanes of food stall with a variety of South and East Asian cuisines on offer. You have the two normal lanes and two lanes right in the middle of the street. You have the seating arrangement on road itself and only pedestrians are allowed.
The road is covered on top so do not worry about rains etc and all the vendors will give you a Tax Receipt if you need one.
It is a decent neighborhood to stay while you are in Singapore and MRT station is connected by 2 lines.
Quite a few historical attractions are also there but nothing awe-inspiring."
,,An interesting morning. No American coffe shops in sight!,4.0,,"Visiting Chinatown, one gets an insight of Old Singapore. The Market does not open until 10am, and as we were jetlagged, we had time to waste. We probably should have had a suit made upon reflection, but it is nice to wander through and easly accessed from the MTR. Very picturesque. Take your camera."
,,Hot & crowded,3.0,,"What else do you expect? It's cheap, it's hot, it's sultry. It has good food for most (vegetarians & vegans not so much) we stopped by to visit The tooth relic temple. It was hot & super hot in January so not sure if I'd ever go in summer!!

Cheap & quite a selection offered."

,,Food and souvenirs,5.0,,"We had some great food and relatively cheap beer, then were able to find cheap souvenirs for family/friends."
,,Fun and full of stuff!,4.0,,"Visit the temple, check out the stalls, shops and food alley. You can have a great conversation with many stall operators - it is rare to find very aggressive salespeople here, with many being much calmer than a similar market in Bangkok for example.

Plenty of junk shops, plenty of fine quality silks and art - just be selective. I bought some fun souvenirs as well as expensive perfumes at great prices. Go during mid-week when it is quiet, even better on a rainy day when business is slow to get the best prices from the vendors. Take an umbrella to make sure you don't get drenched!"
,,Like most other Chinatown's in major cities,4.0,,"We walked to Chinatown from Marina Bay. Along the way we went to Telok Ayer Market (Lau Pa Sat) located at 18 Raffles Quay. We were there at an off time and grabbed a fresh squeezed juice and continued along the way to Thian Hock Keng Temple continued our walking path from Ann Siang Hill to South Bridge Rd. Across the street is the Sri Mariamman Temple (remember to remove shoes before entering and to have your shoulders covered, there is a small fee for taking photos). The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is a few streets away from the Sri Mariamman Temple (on South Bridge). Pagoda, Temple and Smith Streets are the main streets of Chinatown. Pedestrian mall of Trengganu Street links Pagoda and Sago Street and is intersected by Temple and Smith Street. There are several hawkers in the area the Smith Street Chinatown Complex is home to Smith Street Taps although it was not open when we were there. From Chinatown you can go to Maxwell Food Center. It is a famous Hawker Center that gets crowded early.

With walking this took us about 4 hours to see and return to the Marina Bay Area. It is also easily navigable via the MRT. The cab fare upon my return (on the second day) was less expensive per person for 4 people than the MRT there was for 4 people. It is a beautiful walk but if you are not accustomed to the heat and humidity it can be very draining."
,,Good Market In Area,4.0,,"This is a great place to go and see the temples, Maxwell Hawker Center, and the day market. I would take half a day to stroll around and shop."
,,Great place,4.0,,"I wish we had gone here earlier.
This is one month before the Chinese New Year and it's so much decorations all over the place.
A lot of food places and small shops!
Really good food and really cheap if you compare to the rest of Singapore!"
,,Unmissable,4.0,,"Makes the equivalent neighbourhoods in London or San Francisco look puny and plastic - this is much more true to life. The mix of sounds, smells, people - very intense but at no time threatening."
,,Terrible experience,1.0,,Very rude sellers. Low quality goods. Chinese market in Kuala Lumpur is way better . Very wide space take too much time in walking. Maybe good for souvenirs
,,Really fun and cool!,5.0,,"I always enjoy Chinatown everywhere I go. Chinatown in Singapore is actually a mixed of Indian, Chinese and Thai market. The good thing is you could try a wide range of street food and a lot of fun stuffs."
,,Perfect place to find souvenirs!,5.0,,"Great place to do some souvenirs shopping! Dont forget to bargain if you are going to buy something. And first walk the whole street and compare prices, for example the magnets are sold in many stores and some are just a little cheaper;)"

,,typical chinatown,4.0,,"if you've been to a chinatown, it's basically what you expect. Old chinese architecture, a lot of sellers, small shops, etc. If not yet, then this would be a good place to drop by to get another view of Singapore."

,,Great place for souvenirs or gifts,4.0,,"While Singapore is famous for its shopping, quite a lot of the malls and shops are expensive, so it's great to find bargains and a good array of gifts in China Town.

,,"If you need glimpse of China, here it is",4.0,,"If you have lived in Shanghai or China , and feel you miss it... This is the place to go. Local Chinese average meal, want to buy something small and Chinese , spend couple of ours walking around .. Here is the place.. Nice place to spend half a day with family or Friend..."
,,Some Shops but More Like a Night Market,3.0,,"Typical low end Chinatown with limited food and merchandise offerings. The street are filled with vendor stalls similar to Night Markets in many countries. If you are looking for tourist items for a gift then perhaps this is an option, but otherwise I would recommend saving your time for other Singapore attractions."

,,Worth a visit and great food,4.0,,"We took taxi to China town to experience the atmosphere and spent a very pleasant couple of hours eating in one of the many restaurants on the main food hall street with the food being excellent. Its worth taking insect repellent with you as my son was bitten a couple of times. The market was interesting and if you are in Singapore its a great place to spend a couple of hours,"
,,"Busy, great massages, cheap souvenirs",5.0,,"Love to walk around in the busy hawker center by People's Park Complex and maybe get something to eat.
The People's Park Complex is great for reflexology: $18 for 45 minutes, and around $20 for 50 min reflexology +10 min neck massage.
I also got a haircut in a salon at People's Park Complex and was satisfied with playing $22 (without wash).

In the tourists area of Chinatown they sell lots of common souvenirs at good prices, t-shirts, key chains etc usually in packs.

A very clean and tidy Chinatown compared to Chinatown in other cities.

Definitely good prices also in food stores and the market in this area of town.

If you like to stroll with less people around, mornings are great!"

,,RIPPED OFF AT AMAZON CAMERAS &ELECTRONICS,1.0,,"Beware of this shop in Chinatown Singapore!
Amazon Cameras & Electronics
11 TRENGGANU street Singapore 058465
Tel : (65)62216640

In Singapore I went into this electronic shop because I was looking for a flashlight on my camera.
In front of the shop 2 men were looking at the tourists passing by, picking those out with a camera, and trying to get them into the store.
The manager in the store ended up showing us a lens and demonstrated it on my camera.
He told this lens was the newest on the market, made in Japan. It would work much better than a flashlight on the camera.
He quoted the price 1600 $ and showed us a (fake) website with a photo of the lens and the price.
He also showed a folder (he had only one) about this lens.
As we were his first costumers he would give a big reduction and eventually we agreed to pay 690 SGD for this lens and a filter.
When we came home, we looked up the lens on internet and found prices for this lens sold at amazon for less than 100 $
Since we were already out of Singapore, we could not go back to this shop.
We send a mail, but of course, no reaction.
The receipt states “no refunds”
I want to bring this under your attention because I thought Singapore was a safe place to buy.
This is a shop that scams tourists. They heavily overprice items, supported by pricing on a fake website.
There was a big stock of these lenses in the shop! So lots of people get ripped off!
My camera is a Canon
The lens they sell is CARL’s ST DSR PRO MC AF DIGITAL WIDE CONVERTER W/MACRO 0,5"
,,Bring you Appetite,5.0,,"Taking the Metro to the neasrt stop places you on the edge of the shopping area, but if you walk a few blocks, , dumplings, noodles, fish, chicken, and pastries to melt in your mouth....WOW! the Hawkery in this area was even open on Christmas day and full of people.. went back another time to visit the sights and ate in the Chinatown food court... well worth the visit."
,,A Historical Tour of Chinatown at your Fingertips,3.0,,"I love the sights, sounds and smell of Chinatown! Great food, good bargains and some very interesting knick knacks and food options.

What interested me though was the juxtaposition of the old and new. Some of these old buildings are beautifully restored with a new twist to the activities that goes on within it. Experiencing the activities was one thing. Understanding the history behind it was another.

Found this app TimeTracks SG50 that brought us through the history of Chinatown. All at our own pace and time. With augmented reality, a mini drama on how life was like then and some in-depth details of the origins of Chinatown. I got an enjoyable 30min historical tour of Chinatown right on my phone!"
,,"not bad, but nothing much to explore",3.0,,"not bad, but nothing much to explore. It's just another normal street(s), with some tiny handmade gifts ideas for sale, etc. Not a must to visit."

,,Shoping area,4.0,,If searching cheap stuff.. You must go there and i have been there its always nice..you Can come night so you can light and lampion
,,a bit over rated,2.0,,Lots of cheap not unique junk for sale here and beware the camera shop sales people. Prices were ok for t shirts but other stuff a bit junky. Some haggling to be done in some stalls so a bit different than Singapore fixed prices be ready for this or pay to much. Temple at entrance makes a good photo opportunity but nothing you must see or do in the area.
,,Best place for shopping,4.0,,The best place to buy all goods and gift items for back home as the streets are full of gift shops and street food joints. Plenty of stores&food!the kids loved to see around and looking all the China souvenirs!

Stalls are open by 9am so good for a quick look. Otherwise evening markets at Bugis is good for $5 watches and cheap T Shirts. Happy shopping."
,,Downtown Chinatown,4.0,,"We stayed in an hotel in this suburb. Though we had been to the markets next to the subway entrance, we were amazed to learn of the various attractions in the same area.
Hindu Temple, Mosque, Buddhist Temple, and a large China town styled market.
It is a very good place to visit."
,,Bustling Stalls and Shops,3.0,,"This area is busy with stalls, tourists, and shops and a kind of chaotic but interesting to see once or twice. It looks similar to Chinatown in cities around the world. Lots of souvenirs and t-shirts and junky trinkets for sale. Lots of food too."

,,"Cheesey, over commercialised, but more",3.0,,"Stall after stall of cheap overpriced Singaporean and Chinese memorabilia, good food if you do your research or are lucky and a rich history
Do yourself a favour and get on a tour else all you'll see is the stalls of trinkets and some nice buildings, but you'll lack insight and understanding."
,,Good,4.0,,"Very walkable and cool to see, lots of great things to eat and see. Very cool stores the only down side is that they all pretty much sell the same tourist souvenirs and none of it is particularly cool or unique so it gets old kinda quickly. But the food is great and the bud goes right there so it's worth a visit, skip breakfast and go there for lunch. Get the small plates so you can try a bit of everything"
,,Souvenir mecca,3.0,,"we decided to shop at CHinatown instead for souvenir (we went to Bugis last time around) and it was a good choice. Most shops or stalls offered cheap and large varieties of souvenirs. Most priced the same, so you don't really have to shop for the best bargain. There are plenty of restaurant or watering holes around, but we just went for some browsing and shopping. We were there later in the evening, so the crowd wasn't too overwhelming and some shops already closed. Didn't encounter any problems during the visit."

If you are buying souvenirs you will find the best choices and prices in Chinatown. Smith street has all the food choices you can ask for and most on the streets in that area have are line with souvenir vendors. Seems pretty safe . We would stroll around here in the evening hours as our hotel (Chinatown Hotel) was with in the area.
,,Tipical Place to visit,4.0,,Chinatown is one of those sites that can not be missed when traveling to visit each one is special...
,,Nice Walk Around Place,4.0,,"I visited the Pagoda, Trenggnu and Sago Street. Take the exit towards the Pagoda street from the MRT station. The entire street, on both sides, is filled with various shops selling, more or less, the same sort of stuffs. There are variety of stuffs to choose from. There is one shop on the trenggnu street selling this nicely hand made ladies purse. My wife loved that stuff.

It was really wonderful to walk around these streets. You may choose to visit the temple."
,,The place to go to buy Souvenirs,5.0,,"This is the pace to go to if you want to purchase souvenirs for people back home. Any and all kinds of knickknacks available. You might need to browse for a while before coming across some good quality collectibles. Do not rush through and take your time, and you'll not end up buying something that breaks apart immediately after you've given it to a loved one!

P.S: visit the TINTIN store here, because how can you not?!"
,,Good Food and Shopping,5.0,,We like to stay in this area as there are some good budget hotels plus excellent food choices and shopping.
,,Classic.,4.0,,"To many of the more elderly of Singaporeans, this is Home. Today, it continues to attract locals and visitors alike, for a sense of history and certainly, the lively food culture. You will definitely taste some of Singapore's most authentic dishes here.

The place bursts to life in the month around Chinese New Year, where the shops and temporary stalls are stocked with festive decorations and other goodies. Expect, definitely, crowds, and beware of pickpockets.

There's a famous ""bak kwa"" (sliced barbecue pork) shop near the major bus stop along Eu Tong Sen Street, called Lim Chee Guan. People queue there for hours to purchase boxes of the stuff around the New Year period. You're probably better off visiting the shop in the off-season, usually from March.

Other things to see and do: see reviews of Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum, Club Street, South Bridge Road, and walking tours.

Bring a hat. It'll be hot."
,,Interesting place,4.0,,You can spend half a day wondering around Chinatown and there are some bargains to be had that you will not find elsewhere. Food is delicious and well priced

We went down to Chinatown food market, and decided on noodles with pork for about $6 a plate. It was delicious!
The whole area has an amazing atmosphere, the buildings are beautiful.
There are many places to buy souvenirs and snacks here."

,,Great place,5.0,,Lots of things to buy depending on what you desire. Just be prepared to walk .... outside the building ... Trade off against shopping area with higher price but lots of shade and air conditioned huge shopping area. Food at Chinatown hawkers is great on variety too.
,,Has just about everything you want..,4.0,,"Chinatown is cheap and convenient. Want presents for family, friends or work colleagues? It's all here. In the main people are friendly but you have to watch for pick pockets and tailors wanting to shake your hand while guiding you into their shops. Just say hello but don't offer your hand shake...

Catch the MRT (Train) to Chinatown - possibly the easiest train network to navigate in the world. One side of the station is Pagoda St and the Other are shopping complexes. Either way you can spend a whole day shopping and still not see everything."
,,Food Street,3.0,,"Walked over to sample the food, the duck and rice was good. Didn't see many bargains in the market. One of the stall holders was very rude and aggressive, expected me to buy Chinese dresses without my daughters trying them on. We went to another stall and picked up the same, but after trying on and checking quality."
,,Great place,5.0,,Plenty of souvenirs to choose from and places and people to see. Food choices are excellent and priced quite well. Watch the added tax though...it's not included in the menu price but written somewhere unobtrusive on the back page.
,,Absolutely fantastic,5.0,,This place is number one on my must see list of Singapore. Loads of food and drink options which is great for taking a break from all the shopping. Time your visit just before it gets dark to appreciate it fully.
,,The old way of life.,4.0,,Visiting China Town is like travelling back in time. Things have changed but the feelings and way of life of the mostly Chinese residents is the same. We came for Dim Sum (lunch) and to buy a Chinese Teapot set as well as some stones for luck and health and so on.
,,Large area with interesting sights.,5.0,,"Culturally interesting area of Singapore. Lots of shopping with very unusual merchants. Also, many varied and unusual dining options."
,,Chinese culture,3.0,,Shop houses that are preserved from teh 19 century. A place to visit for photography and learning about chinese culture. There are also a lot of hostel for accommodation. Great local food but make sure u check the prices as some of the coffee shops are over price for local food. Check out the multi storey hawker centre that is just opposite the relic tooth temple. The fired hokkien mee is best and of course clay pot rice around the corner.
,,It's all here,4.0,,Going to china town is like stepping back in time to old Singapore a bit all old buildings the hawkers and everything you can imagine for sale from iPad and the latest tec to key rings and placemats
,,Shopping,4.0,,Chinatown is a great place to simply stroll through and look at the latest items for sale. You can often pick up a bargain. There are also some excellent photo oppotunities.
,,Surprisingly different,4.0,,"I have been to many Chinatown's in all kinds of cities. I was impressed with how spacious the walkways were and how clean everything was. I was there just to wander the streets and found all kinds of nice little gifts for family back home. I especially loved the colored prints you could have done to match your name and could bring them home with or without the frame. The prices for everything was reasonable. You could also find a lot of natural herbs, spices and teas. Due to the heat, we only spent about an hour, but you could spend hours browsing the shops and tasting all of the food. I recommend going when they open before the crowds get too big."
,,Mix up of sights and sounds,4.0,,"Large number of shops, colorful mottifs, souvenirs, oriental medicine, and a nice food street to finish to all up."
,,BEST PLACE FOR DEALS,5.0,,Unlike most market places this one had good food and good prices. it was the only place I spent money. I found something i was looking for and I can't get in the USA and was very happy about that.Need to have Singapore dollars.
,,cheap goodies,4.0,,souvenirs are cheaper here compare to Bugis's prices. Going here is convenient thru the downtown line (blue line). Just find your way out of Chinatown Station and voila! there it is. Food is great if you wanted to try authentic food (local).
,,"Fantasic area - sights to see, shopping and eating locations",5.0,,So glad we did Chinatown as daughter wanted to have her hand 'hennaed' - they took less than 15 minutes to do her hand and she was delighted. Some great shopping with lovely Asian silk scarves and dresses at very reasonable prices.
,,Perfect place for a foodie & culture buff,4.0,,"Strolled around chinatown, super cheap knick-knacks - a good way to experience the real Singapore. We tried a ice-kachang & fresh sugarcane juice - both of them were quite worth it."
,,A very Enjoyable Tour,5.0,,"I confess this the best tour I have during my 4 weeks trip.It is very nice and very enjoyable.they took us to shop who provide medicine made locally by them for many years, the owners explained the history and details of their business ,then we went to a restaurant and we have enjoyed a very nice dinner and went through the whole area
which I find it very interesting (if it was not the last night I would go and spend an enjoyable night again) then we moved by cycles to another area and we went a tour in the river .plus we have saw some difficult games.it is rely enjoyable score is 4.5/5"

,,TOO BRIEF STOP,4.0,,"Interesting - shops, cafes, money lenders. Brief stop as part of a post cruise tour. We had actually stayed in Singapore for a few days prior to the cruise but only passed through on the hop on/off bus tour. Bustling, busy place - good bargains - we bought a lovely mahjong (sp?) set at a great price. Hindu temple at the beginning of our walk and the Chinese temple at the end."
,,Market for sojourners,4.0,,"Last drop before going back home. Cheap must have souvenirs. Name it and you have from key chain to t-shirts, bags, travel pillows etc. Don't be overwhelmed by the first stall try walking around, there's so much more in every nook. If you feel tired ,rest yourself with a pampering massage. Food street at night time is fun as well so don't rush, let your tummy enjoy as well."
,,Cheap and hot,3.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is simply a tourist destination, with most shops selling cheap Chinese good or souvenirs. A cultural experience for all and worth a visit once."

,,Reminds you you're in Asia!,5.0,,"Loved it here, this is the Asia I know and love! Great food available for very little money. We had an amazing meal (in Chinatown Complex, at the back on the right, run by a little 77year old man) of roast duck, pork and chicken with rice and noodles, plus soup which cost £7 for two of us and it was the best meal we had in Singapore - way better than the rip off eateries at Clarke Quay anyway!"

,,A little too anemic,1.0,,"Remembering Chinatown of 10 years ago we were taken aback by how modern and sanitised it had become. but that is regrettably,progress.Still a delightful place to visit and to be made very welcome"
,,So clean but still China,5.0,,"This is of course the cleaniest Chinatown on Earth! But it's very entertaining to all senses. I loved the food court. The food was between the good and average, but the surroundings was so special and somehow unreal. I will come back - sure!"
,,Chinatown !,4.0,,"You can buy Chinese groceries in here , snakes , food, Chinese medicine , and you can do transfer money back to China inside some malls , anyway , this place I recommend you to go !"
,,Best Places for Chinese Food and budget shopping,5.0,,"Peoples Park, OH and China Town Shopping mall, is best place for budget shopping, the food court next to OG shopping center, need one full day here because it so many things to see and need our skills to bargain. Anything can find here, garment, electronic, Chinese herb, singapore souvenirs and many more. Food court selling almost best taste of Asian food, empty your stomach and enjoy the food."

,,Standard and lack of personality,2.0,,"You'd find lots of food and souvenirs stalls selling things in Chinese (or Singapore Chinese) style here. In fact, many of them are selling almost the same staff until I'd say, it's lack of some kind of personality. I won't find this place dynamic or energetic, I've just thought it's too well-organised."
,,Plenty of Awesome Food here~,4.0,,"I come here often because of the variety of good local food here. My favourite places are Chinatown Complex Market/Food Centre, People's Park Food Centre & Maxwell Food Centre. These are where many Singaporeans will hang out for a meal despite the relatively less than comfortable environment compared with the newer and comfier outlets.

I encourage travellers and tourists to venture further beyond Chinatown MRT station to get their meal fix. Go where the locals go."
,,Great old buildings,4.0,,"It is a delight to the eyes and mind to stroll around the Chinatown, looking at the old houses, temples, markets, small stalls selling food etc. Everything looks so colorful and vibrant. It is a fairly compact area and the MRT brings you into middle of it."
,,Standard China Town,3.0,,Lots of food places and souvenir shops but very standard for a China town and very similar to the one in Kuala Lumper. Bargain basement souvenir shops galore! All in all you probably don't need more tag an hour here.

I also got to see a dance as the visiting time was close to Chinese new year."
,,LOVE love this China town,5.0,,As you get off the train the view is spectacular of China town with all it decorations. Great many shops to find anything you want to eat or buy. Though not very big you can spend several hours roaming around.
,,A must do in singapore,4.0,,So many places to eat. Great buildings and older style architecture. The hawker market is a great way to eat on the cheap. Heaps of variety. Typical souvenir stalls supply cheap goodies to take home. Do yourself a favour and just wander and explore. The mrt has a Chinatown station making it easy to get to. Visit Mamma Kongs if you have hankering for the best crab in Singapore. Yummy black pepper crab and the best chilli crab and at a reasonable price. Visit the area at night at you will find bars offering happy hour drink prices. Safe to walk around as well.
,,Hours before our flight home,5.0,,"The local taxi knows it as Chinatown OG. One of the store is called OG and it's the landmark used if you want to go to Chinatown. It offers many arrays of shopping from clothing, luggage, food products, gold jewelry, etc. Their food stall is a definitely a must to visit if you love different types of foods. Price is pretty reasonable and I am sure you can haggle for high end items better then going to a basic department stores. It is definitely one of the better Chinatown I've visited."
,,Chinese ... food ... fun,5.0,,"We ate a lot in this place
Cause the food was delicious and cheap
We were there last lunar Chinese new year and it was such a beautiful night

,,Recommended For shopaholic !,5.0,,Very recommended for you traveler who looking Singapore signature gift with minimum budget ! Very complete and negotiable price ! Some store accept pay with your visa / master card !
,,Awesome Experience,5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is not to be missed. It's like nothing in the U.S., where I live and have seen many Chinatowns. So many little shops are outside, some both inside and outside, many covered to help in the heat. It is colorful beyond description. Merchandise ranges from the cheesy souvenir stuff to nice high-end goods.

Be sure to take a ride in a trishaw, a 3-wheeled open-air carriage, like a bicycle with a sidecar. It is fun and you'll get a view of the area, whether just Chinatown or beyond, that's like walking without the effort. I appreciated it because I had a hurt hip and since I was in pain and couldn't walk any distance, I would have missed this whole area.

We took a wonderful tour, ""Chinatown at Night,"" that included dinner, a trishaw ride, some time to shop and a stunning bumboat ride in the Singapore River. A highlight of our time in Singapore!"
,,A little bit tacky but worth a visit,4.0,,Haven't been here for 28 years and it's not as authentic as it was but still a great atmosphere. Plenty of stuff to buy but the sellers don't hassle you incessantly. We had lunch while here at a food stall inside the local mall. It was really delicious and so cheap.
,,bustling road,4.0,,"its very crowded road with a lot of shop selling merchandise , beware of pickpocket when in this road"
,,Disappointed,2.0,,Bit of history to the place but basically it's a tourist trap to charge you more. Lots of trinket and general tat for sale on various market stalls. Jump off the red bus at stop 10 and then stop 20 mins there and jump back on the next red bus. At least you can say you've done it!!!
,,Alley for Souvenirs,3.0,,"China town is an stretch of shops selling Souvenirs , its a place generally give a glimpse of Chinese artifacts . You reach their with China Town MRT and can spend 1-2 hours , may grab few not so expensive Souvenirs and yes do bargain ..it gets over crowded during Chinese New Year (around FEBRUARY) , you may like to go there for real view of China town during Chinese New Year nights…"
,,The Real Chinatown,3.0,,"China Town in Singapore is really have the Chinese vibes (I am not trying to be racism here, guys..).

But the vibes, thou, is the one that keeps people coming back."
,,Great Afternoon Roaming the Streets,5.0,,"I love Chinatown in Singapore. Great places to eat and explore while still being exposed to how the locals live.

,,Typical Chinatown area,3.0,,We always like to see Chinatown area in large cities. This one was typical of most others. We enjoyed our time and had lunch.
,,Excellent place for authentic Chinese food and souvenir shopping,4.0,,"If you plan to buy souvenirs from SG, this is the place to find the best deals. You can buy 26 key chains in different designs for SG$10. Too bad my son and I already bought souvenirs the day before--24 key chains for SG$10. We thought that was already a good deal but Chinatown has better deals. The bags and magnets are also cheaper. Lots of local foods to enjoy, too. But make sure you don't eat at the restos where most tourists eat. The hawker's section where food is cheaper and more authentic is just nearby."
,,Food,4.0,,"Old town with great food. Found many great food here, the authentic Chinese food to satisfy your tummy :)"

,,The old charm of Chinatown Singapore,5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is the favourite haunt of tourists and locals alike. You can take Bus 147 or the NE Line and stop at Chinatown station (purple line MRT). Exit at Smith Street or Eu Tong Sen Street and you are in the heart of Chinatown. There are many shops selling souvenirs and Chinese products. You can buy keychains, clothes, Chinese cookies, musical instruments and almost anything under the sun.
There are buskers here in the evenings and if you are generous enough, you can drop a dollar into their collection boxes.

If you like Chinese food you can visit the Hawkers' Centre on the third floor or the many restaurants along Eu Tong Sen Street. There are temples, mosques and Hindu temples in Chinatown as Singapore is a multi- racial and multi-religious society.

No visit to Singapore is complete unless you visit Chinatown and the best time to visit Chinatown is during the mooncake festival or the week before Chinese New Year."
,,"Interesting place, good for shopping",3.0,,"Good place to shop if you are looking for inexpensive stuff - clothes, magnets, bags etc. Also a good place to pick up souvenirs if you're a tourist. Lots of food joints. I used to frequent this place as a new girl in the city, not any more."

There's a temple there as well (free to enter) which was nice as well."

Not only is it a great place to catch a few bargains with your shopping but there is an amazing variety of food venues from the more expensive restaurants to the street vendors out in the pedestrian areas. My favourite - the Noodle Man for the best noodles I have ever tasted! And at a good price.
,,China town,5.0,,In Singapore there is a china town n also India town too..China town ll give u looks of same a China n also to enjoy shopping n food of Chinese culture
,,Great centralized area for food and souvenir shopping,5.0,,"Of all the Chinatowns I've been to across the world, I'd have to say that Singapore's is my favorite. It's a vibrant area without feeling too packed, clean, and the decor is nice to look at. It can be easily reached via subway (purple and blue lines), a short walk to Clarke Quay, and a 15 minute walk to Marina Bay Sands.

If you need to buy some gifts, they can be found here for great prices. I bought 4 shirts for $10 USD! Also in the area are Food Street with decent food for a modest price, as well as the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum."
,,Good to fill in time,4.0,,"Visited Chinatown, Its like Chinatowns all over the world. If you enjoy wondering around in market areas this is a good place to fill in time. Heaps of souvenirs available in this area"
,,Another Chinatown,3.0,,Lots of cheap eatery's and massage establishments. Not a great deal of variety within the market stalls and not that cheap but that is Singapore prices. Worth a visit to have a look at the sights and sample the foods available.
,,Must see,5.0,,We had a great time strolling through chinatown while in Singapore. Fun happening place with lots of markets to visit. Make sure you visit the food hawker center nearby. The variety of food and tastes is well worth the visit.
,,Probably the cleanest in the world,5.0,,"Gosh I have never seen a cleaner non-CD looking Chinatown ever until I came to Singapore. The streets were lively and I loved the bargains to be had specially when buying in bulk from the little street shops that litter the streets. Oh and the street food is absolutely divine, cheap and there many to choose from such as chili crab which is a Singaporean dish that I loved. It seemed safe at night when all the shops are closed, I got there late one night and I still walked around and had no problem at all."
,,Must Visit - Great Shops for Souvenirs at Bargain Prices,5.0,,"A very energetic, busy and crowded place. Full of little shops selling souvenirs, food, and clothes; with a lot of tourist places in the vicinity (like The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple). Make sure you buy something here!"
,,A must experience,4.0,,"Worth stay in this place as our hostel was located in Chinatown. First thing I really loved in this place was the location. The distance to main attractions was not a problem and MRT was just right there. The streets were so lovely that anyone can explore it and everything was there , we never bothered getting lost because it was so easy to find and recall the streets, from Pagoda Street to Smith Street -Ansiang Road to Maxwell Road etc, from our stay we learned how to take the short cuts going to other streets. Secondly, Smith Street or what they call Food Street was a wow! There were many food stalls to chose from and I can say a cheap eat. Some food stalls near the metro are quite expensive.
Thirdly, friendly for budget shoppers, but don't expect a great quality for some stuff. Good for souvenirs- Tip: try to compare their deals example for key chains: in the morning 46 pieces for 10 dollars, while in the evening deals will change 32pcs in 10 dollars, good to bargain early in the morning.
Lastly,Chinatown has attractions too like the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum and Sri Mariamman Temple. However, Chinatown Heritage Center was closed during our visit(nov second and thrid week). In the evening, Chinatown has some activities, try to ask the locals.

Overall a must experience, good for budget travellers"

,,Must go Chinatown complex market and food center,5.0,,"There are plenty of sightseeing and variety of food in Chinatown. you can get many great experience here. but one thing you mustn't miss is the MOST local food located at Chinatown complex market and food center, locate at Smith Street level 2. when you exit from the escalator at Pagoda street, simply turn right at your next junction and cross 2 streets it's at your right hand side, level 2, where Chinatown food street is at your left. you get very tasty local food here in local flavor and local serving style and in more local price."
,,China town Every whare in the World,4.0,,Nice experience in China town. Lots of small shops were there. Most of the goods are cheap. All made in China. Streets all looks same to me :)
,,Shopping that won't break the bank!,5.0,,"Singapore is full of high-end shopping malls that glisten and gleam but nothing beats the more authentic sights, sounds, and flavors of Chinatown! This is one of my favorite areas in beautiful Singapore as it is full of vibrant life! Easy to spend a long afternoon strolling through the seemingly endless parade of open-air shops, stroll down to the Buddha tooth relic temple (beautiful) and then have a wonderful lunch at one of the many tasty options!"
,,Touristy place - but walk beyond to find hidden gems!,4.0,,"China Town is a fixed item in my itinerary for friends and family visiting us in Singapore.
Most people love the cheap and petty shopping (think souvenirs!) that you can do, while strolling along a historic corner of the city. The fact that it is just at the exit of an MRT station makes it extremely accessible as well.
But, the charm of the China Town area does not end with the shopping streets and other sights like Buddha Relic Temple and the Hindu temple. For me, the streets around China Town like Club Street, Ann Siang Hill etc. are excellent options for a good night out. A perfect plan will be to hit China Town in the evening and walk across to Club Street or Ann Siang Hill for drinks and food, may be on one of the many terrace restaurants in the area!"
,,Shopping Mecca,5.0,,"Chinatown is a must stop on every tourist agenda. Here you can shop for almost everything at cheap prices, especially souvenirs to take back home. There is also a street with some delicious local food. I had Chicken/rice, which is my absolute favourite.
Be careful with your money, this place can empty your pockets before you can sneeze, in a good way!"
,,Nice & cheap,4.0,,"Here's where you have to come to by the souvenirs you have to take home. Big diversity and very good prices for clothes, souvenirs and more. Great cheap Chinese food is abundant. The SMRT station will drop you right in the heart of the shopping street so is easy to get here. That's all!"
,,Does what it says,4.0,,"Walked rom our hotel one evening and decided to eat local, really interesting experience. We picked a food place that was v popular with locals, pointed at a few things that looked reconisable on the menu, and had a good meal at a very good price. Don't try this if you want a quiet meal or tablecloths!"
,,Viator Tour Disapointed,3.0,,Waste of an evening. Taken to dinner up the back of shops in China town and served a meal I could of had at home when we had already passed all the street food which looked far more interesting and appealing.
,,spent a good day wandering around Chinatown.,5.0,,"Chinatown has an ambiance of its own. Plenty of shops, restaurants, and places to eat and drink. Easily accessible on public transport"
,,Thank goodness they kept the charm,4.0,,"While the city of Singapore is a truely amazing Mecca of outstanding beauty with architectural buildings that blow your mind and shops that every man and woman would be crazy to be dissatisfied with the Singaporeans have ensured that they have maintained some of their past. Their culture goes back hundreds of years and while my first visit was 40 years ago I am delighted to see China Town holding on to the past. Well maybe prettied up somewhat but none the less, the charm and character of old hotels and inns to beautiful traditional tea houses to local markets and stalls. Even a taste of local food can be found and Selangor Pewter that was all the rage back in the '70's can still be found. I bought some beautiful quality will scarves, dressing gowns and PJ's that are so comfortable to wear. Tailors will greet you and offer to make a suit or tailored dress within a day and sometimes hours all dependant on the style. The people are very friendly and not pushy like you find in some other tourist destinations. Getting around is easy. Use the local bus transport, MRT, or taxi. Just be aware that if there is no metre in the car it isn't a licensed taxi. The licensed taxi drivers all speak excellent English and are very respectful of their clients and their industry so never be afraid to use this service. China Town is close to Clarke Quay so make a day or two and shop all day then eat and cruise along the Singapore River at night. It is such a beautiful experience. Enjoy!"
,,Throngs Shopping and Food,5.0,,"Street vendors, hawker stalls, lots of people. Mostly Chinese and Asian food of ALL types. If you don't like crowds don't go here. I enjoy the energy."
,,Lively place to visit,5.0,,"So far Singapore seems to be all about tax and shopping. The place is sterile and has no soul. However, after a visit to Chinatown I am pleased to say that bits of Singapore are real and have a good feeling"
,,Mostly same-same.,3.0,,"Mostly same silk-clothing, tailors, trinkets, hats, chopsticks etc. Very cheap though for nice silk kimonos and such. An hour or so is enough here, not many chinese restaurants."
,,Amazing,5.0,,So colorful and so interesting that one wanders thru street after street discovering the variety of goods and services. And it is a great place to shop.
,,Worth the experience!,3.0,,My partner & I went to china town to experience the food & culture. We walk around the stalls & shops at the market for several hours. They stalls all sell the same tourist items at the same price. It is worth a look & something to eat.
,,"牛车水 Niu Che Shui....Plenty of shops, restaurants and stalls to tempt the wallet.",4.0,,"Chinatown is compact few blocks, lots to see...locals and tourists vying for bargains and quick, good value Asian dishes.

Today was the first time in many visits that I was able to wander around at leisure. Each vendor assures you that they have the cheapest and best value goods for sale.

Many of the clothing shops offer custom made suits, trousers, shirts etc.. ""ready before you go back"". Their spruikers are well trained, unless you want to buy something, resist the request to visit their stall.

I purchased some humorous luggage tags - 8 for SD$20. I tried to bargain....but...I missed out...grrrr!! Still, good for gifts back home.

Be aware of the signs to keep valuables safe as you move around to reduce temptation for pickpockets in crowded parts of the pedestrian streets.

For lunch I had a BBQ pork, rice with soup and a fresh juice for SD$8, just right of MRT entrance in Pagoda St.

Interestingly Chinatown is known locally as 牛车水 (Niu Che Shui)!

Named after the bullock carts that used to supply fresh water to its residents.

Announcements on the MRT as the trains approach the station say ""Niu Che Shui""

Take your time to explore the heritage shops and the historical area."
,,Epic win!!!!,5.0,,Its Chinatown so by default its an epic win of a place. Great variety of cheap shops and good food. Definitely worth visit. This is SO much better than Arab street
,,"All that I remembered , but had forgotten",5.0,,"One of the worlds great Chinatowns , a far eastern mix of rubbish stalls, cultural sites , food places and bars , tailors and towts, but not too much pressure , we bought a little , saw a lot , and had a ball, bring cash"
,,Day and night that full of fun,4.0,,"Complete package when you have a full day at Chinatown, Singapore. At day, you can shopping with a fair price and fair quality, it's the right place to buy some souvenirs. You can find many things that just cost $1.
At night, when the food stalls open, you can fulfill your desire of chinese foods and snacks. Don't worry if you don't know what to eat, just see where the longest queue is. Haha. No need to worry if you can't speak chinese, because most of them can speak english. If not, you still can use your finger to say what exactly do you want. LOL!
It's only take a day if you want to know all the chinatown area (include the mall there, such as chinatown point, people's park, etc)."
,,Ok,4.0,,"Not a bad place to walk through, you get the odd seller touting for business. Keep away from the durian fruit, I hear it's usually off!"
,,Typical Chinatown,4.0,,"Just like most other Chinatowns around the world- plenty of cheap placed to eat, fast service. Also the place to go for your novelty items and souvenirs. A better selection than Little India. The metro station exits right in the heart of the action."
,,Buddha Temple,3.0,,I made a stop for a quick pray before the rain pop in. A nice stop in the chinatown area. A bit too commercial. But It's ok. A tourist stop.
,,Pretty average experience.,2.0,,Chinatown is a bit run down and underwhelming. It doesn't really have any unique features or defining characteristic. Obviously the stores and restaurants are Chinese but they strike me as pale reflections of Hong Kong eateries or even Chinatown in San Francisco or Melbourne or Sydney.
,,Good for gifts,4.0,,Nice cheap place to buy gifts. Dont buy perfume from there they are not authentic. They claim perfumes are 100% authentic but they are not.
,,Great cultural experience,4.0,,"A total assault on the senses. Food, spices, clothing, culture! It actually felt like we had slipped back in time!"
,,Great for inexpensive souvenirs,4.0,,"Went here to do some inexpensive shopping. Got some great deals, but started seeing some of the same items. We also visited the nearby mall, ChinaTown Point. Great location to eat as well. Easy to get to via MRT."
,,"China town, Singapore",4.0,,The place to go to for shopping for all kind of gifts to take back with you. A line of shops on both sides of the street as you step out of the metro with all sorts of items on display and many joints for refreshments
,,a fun place to wonder,4.0,,"a great place to wonder, eat and spend an afternoon. We enjoyed the open air food and easy accessibility."
,,A pleasant stroll from our hotel,4.0,,Chinatown is a haven for hawker food lovers It is divided into four areas with most activities centred around Smith and Pagoda Streets The Chinatown Rail Station is adjacent to Pagoda Street There are a number of ethnic places of worship in the area
,,A lot smaller than expected.,3.0,,We had half a day here. many of the stall sell the usual rubbish. We had lunch in a seafood restaurant. We spent a few hours eating what could only be described as average Chinese Food but the beer was cold and the service was efficient. I can't remember the name of the restaurant but it was right in the middle and had red and yellow painted tables and chairs. I always here about how good the food is in Singapore but I find it to be expensive and underwhelming. After lunch I bought some very nice jewellery from a place that was recommended to me by friends in Sydney. ( Myer ) was the name. Haggle for your best price but don't be too cheeky.
,,Lovely way to spend a few hours,5.0,,"Just when I though Singapore was just a city of skyscrapers, I ca,e across Chinatown. Thank you. Lovely way to spend a couple of hours. Grab some food and relax"
,,The Place to Eat & Shop,4.0,,"Loved Chinatown. Lots of places to eat. Best Chilli Crab. A bit messy to eat, but aprons provided, Plenty of shopping from clothes to gift items. Transport to and from Chinatown is frequent and accessible."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Lots of the same stalls but worth a look we picked up our touristy gifts for family members. Food available take s walk first to check out prices though as they do vary. But picked up some great items
,,Go for chicken rice at maxwell hawker center!,4.0,,If you visit China town you should drop by Maxwell hawker center and get to try all the local food! the famous chicken rice at Tian Tian is so good and worth the wait!
,,Very clean chinatown,3.0,,"The Chinatown in Singapore is one of the cleanest Chinatowns that I have been. There are a lot of souvenir shops, along with local stores. Old Singaporean architecture houses can be seen around Chinatowns. I had durian in Chinatown."
,,Chinatown...,3.0,,"Chinatown was a pretty average stroll. It really didn't differ from the Chinatowns i have visited in US, Canada and other countries. There was lots of walking, small shopping and food."
,,Another Must See,5.0,,"Not as good as China town in China! However, it was awesome. You were not accosted as in other places and the ambiance at night was great. Did it on our own using the MRT."
,,China World,4.0,,"Among all the china towns around the this is probably the best one...it is a very interesting place to visit for shopping or food..clean, modern and friendly people. also if you are looking for Chinese medicine products (i.e tiger balm, crocodile balm..etc)or very good quality Chinese tea this is the place for you...Don't leave Singapore without paying visit to china town"
,,Average Tourist Street,3.0,,The street is all about food and small items shopping. We bought our souvenirs from there. I think they have the cheapest stuff as compared to rest of Singapore when it comes to souvenir. I didn't eat there but there is a whole street containing food stalls.
,,Always visit the Chinatown in any major city I go to,5.0,,Always visit the Chinatown in any major city I go to and Singapore was not an exception but was a great experience. Lots of interesting shops and food places of course. The food places were exceptional and many interesting temples to see. A must go to on a trip to Singapore
,,Love this area of Singapore,5.0,,We love this area of Singapore. When we visit we always stay in Chinatown because there are really good restaurants that we like to eat at in the area. If you are looking for cheap gifts to take home this is the place to go.
,,Nice feeling of China !,5.0,,"We visited late afternoon when the colorful lights would give us more interesting photos and so we had them !
From the entrance we on in the china town was the Buddha tooth temple ! We were very lucky because they had a special ceremony in the temple so it's was amazing !
So many shops, so many colors !
We had very cheap and good quality food from the food street . Try it !"
,,cheap but not the best quality,3.0,,cheap but not the best quality .. if you are not a big fan of shopping .. many other attractions can be be a better option
,,Tons of delicious food around,5.0,,the chinatown complex food center and maxwel food center are my go-to when i want to find foods.. the foods there are so damn delicious and extremely cheap
,,cleanest and best organised chinatown I ever visited,5.0,,"as the title said, it s beautiful (architecture), it's clean and you feel really safe (like everywhere in Singapore).
good thing is that you can find as many cheap made in china low quality stuff than also expensive quality ones (harder usually to find for tourists like me).
really nice place to walk around and visit"
,,Great place to eat,5.0,,"We sampled food in the food court area of Chinatown , can't remember the name of the restaurant but it was a shop rather than a stall. Food was tasty but smal portions. We then walked past diners eating on the main road beside the bus stop and ate a further meal there which was very tasty. It was full of locals so thought it would be good.
Would recommend you go where the local eat as food tended to be better there."
,,Good,4.0,,"There are lots of items you can buy for your friends from your hometown, like souvenirs, clothes, keychain and so on. You can buy also lots of street foods and even you can choose a restaurant if you want to eat though."
,,A clean and touristy Chinatown,4.0,,"Chinatown Singapore is clean and well organized - more touristy driven. Checkout Temple street if you look for Chef tools, lots of different shops there."
,,nice architecture,5.0,,very cool architecture (older two-store buildings). very different from the modern areas of Singapore. enjoyed it very much!
,,"Good place to buy souvenirs, food and clothes",5.0,,"Chinatown is always a place for cheap stuff, food, and shopping. It's a low class shopping mall though not everything is cheap, like electronics. Food is everywhere. Souvenirs and clothes. Best place to exchange foreign currency also. But you must go around many and haggle. There's one small money changer inside the complex, always finish fast and close early. His rate is the best. You have to catch him fast."
,,Boo hoo,1.0,,I found the place overhyped.. Nothing really exciting ; unless you are ok to buy so called Chinese products at higher price than its worth.. Boo hoo!!!!
,,Great area of Singapore,4.0,,"They have some of everything in Chinatown. I really liked this area of Singapore. I didn't get to try any of the food because we were only there for a short time. But there are plenty of restaurants that I would have liked to try. If you get a chance, definitely go over to Chinatown Food Street and have some fabulous food for lunch or dinner."
,,Funny place with Noisy stretch,4.0,,"The streets are filled with souvenir shops and every one of them are selling the same items, magnets, pens & watches & handbags. Singapore's Chinatown is a very vibrant community that I recently had the pleasure of wandering around for several hours one afternoon. There are great public spaces where groups of elderly gentlemen could be seen playing and observing board games while conversing amongst themselves."
,,Cleanest Chinatown so far,4.0,,"Though I have seen only few Chinatown's ( Manila and Malaysia ) I Can say that this place has the cleanest Chinatown so far, (Aside from the fact that Singapore is one of the cleanest country ), maybe because Chinatiwn people are tedious when it comes to cleaning their surroundings. If you have a chance walking on the streets at 9 am, you can see locals sweeping and cleaning. You wont smell something rotten garbage or any smelly corner.
The malls are quite crowded. I find the items here cheap, almost same price a bugis.
Recommended place to stay, also if you want to have night life in Clarke Quay, you can stay in Chinatown, its walking distance."
,,A really fun place.,5.0,,"Shopping? This is the place for souvenirs, perfume , scarves yiu name it and plenty of restaurants that have a large variety of food and drink all in the streets between shop houses all decorated. The city has placed giant transparent pavilion covers in the shape of flower petals over the streets to keep you dry in rain. You're outside, but your not.."
,,Chin Chin Chinatown at Singapore,5.0,,"An absolute treat to just stroll along this area at Singapore.Rows and rows of shop selling Tshirts with Singapore written across fridge magnets,cases to keep glasses,mirrors,beautiful small chinese toys of FU,Lu and ShU,the Gods of Fame,Fortune and health.Umbrellas fancy ones,beautiful pillow and cushion covers,a Shop dedicated to TinTin,lovely Thai silk material sold in the shops.and so are there good food courts to have a meal or snack.Souvenirs available there are really cute and worth buying as takeaways to give friends."
,,Busy-Noisy stretch,3.0,,"Its like a typical Chinatown, noisy-busy. Was very well decorated with lit up in October which was a delight. Must visit for Asian cheap food lovers."
,,Fairly average,3.0,,I think that it could be so much more than it is but unfortunately it is filled with cheap and tacky trinkets that you can buy for yourself as a souvenir or as gifts for people back home. There are a collection of restaurants but I would suggest that you eat on the strip of little stalls where you can get satay/wonton noodles/char kway teow as these often taste better and are more authentic. I wish that there could be more of a focus on the unique architecture that you can see on the second level as opposed to all the tourist driven shops. If you want something different ask about the hawker centers that are in chinatown. Better places to eat and different atmosphere altogether. I wouldn't necessarily say that this is a must see but if it's on your way you might as well stop and have a bit of a look.
,,You can really feel the culture here.,3.0,,"Walking through Chinatown was an adventure. The market is great, very very clean, not a piece of trashnon the streets. Great variety of souveniers."
,,Meh,3.0,,"Most exciting part of Chinatown was the Hindu Temple. Otherwise, a lot of souvenir shops, traffic and restaurants. We went around noon. Perhaps it is better in the evening."
,,One of my favorite area's,4.0,,"Chinatown is definitely one of my favorite area's! Wandering through the little streets with various little shops and eateries. Around the year the streets get beatuifully decorated for Chinese celebrations. (Mooncake festival, Chinese New Year and probably some more)"
,,Very Chinese. Me gusta~,4.0,,"o Easy and relaxing walk.
o Nice food at moderate price (except for seafood!).
o Close to an Indian temple and Buddha Tooth Relic Temple that are worth a visit!
o Building architecture are not really Chinese but still gorgeous.
o Convenient! Easy MRT access!
x Crowded. (But OK lah! Not complaining...)
- Good to visit during the evening after visiting the temples. Not so hot during those hours."
,,Great place to shop and eat!!,4.0,,"We were staying not far from Chinatown and ventured down there a few times during our stay. I love the mix of temples,street stalls and food!! Everyone is friendly and asks but does not hassle! We had a great foot massage up the stairs in an old beautiful building and it was fantastic, like walking on air when we left. We also had a shoulder and neck massage which was awesome at another place. We also ate at various little restaurants and street shops, it was all delicious! I love the hussle and bussle of locals of all races and tourists all mixing together. Definitely worth a look, we also grabbed a few good bargains for the family back home."
,,Chinese Ethnic Centre,3.0,,Chinatown is a taste of China in miniature with lots of cheap souvenir shops and a wide choice of typical Chinese food eateries. The interesting area is not that extensive so it is relatively easy to navigate and to soak-up the Chinese atmosphere and food. Try some of the tea shops/cafes.
,,Good food,5.0,,A very laid back atmosphere to eat out with no pressure to get dressed up. All ages and countries. The service was friendly and fast. The savours genuine
,,China Town different expirience,4.0,,Almost all tourist city are having china town which gives typical feelings of China and one should visit this place
,,Good shopping on a budget,5.0,,"Chinatown market is well worth a visit for purchasing silk items, lovely fans and tea sets. Lot of toot as well but worth sorting through. lots of stalls. you will get stall holders calling out to you but they don't persist if you ignore them or say no thanks."
,,Great place to find some bargains,5.0,,Lots of shops to find cheaper tourists bargains than Orchard Road. It also has a lot of history. There is a museum there about the area.
,,Super commercialized with cheap trinkets,2.0,,Chinatown is really nothing more than a string of cheap souvenir shops. Arab St and Little India are way more interesting.
,,Cultural Visit,4.0,,"Very pleasant to go look around and buy souvenirs there (I don't like doing hassle so I don't know if you can do it there or not)..
If you have time, go visit Masjid Jamek and Sri Mahariamman Temple, two religious building located at the end of the Pagoda Street (MRT Chinatown Exit A)..
You can also stop by at Tintin Shop if you're a fan of Tintin..
Too bad the Singapore Coins and Notes Museum that happen to be in the same street are permanently closed.."
,,Interesting,3.0,,"I would like to state this area as interesting , as you will find a lots of shops on travel, currency exchange etc. If you love Chinese food then you should venture for this."
,,Vibrant!,5.0,,"Chinatown is essentially attack the heart of Singapore. Stroll here and takes in the sights, sounds and smells of the city. There are a host of street vendors and plenty of restaurants. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit here."
,,Must see quarter of Singapore,5.0,,"The smells, colors, nice people, interesting buildings, authentic restaurants, markets with small shops that sells almost everything makes this quarter of Singapore one of the must see attractions. Wander the streets there, sit in a local restaurant to relax with a cold beer and watch the people passing by. Just go to the ""Chinatown"" MRT station and you are there...
Very recommended to visit (!)"
,,Great,5.0,,China town is fabulous to walk around and see what is going on..lots of good food here and its really great value.also if you want souvenirs you will get them cheap here .. Strolling round the streets here is great fun.
,,Great food,4.0,,Great food at the hawkers markets and not far from the station. Its a big town so be sure to walk straight through before you find a place to eat because some of the outer eating spots are not as good.
,,Must visit place chinese town,5.0,,You can but unique objects from this town. you can feel like you are in hong kong beautiful place really. Chinese are little accessible for prices good to go
,,Disapointed with yes china hotel,2.0,,"I stayed in this hotel, and it's very unrecomended hotel. First impression, room was smelly, but a boy welcomed me was nice (hopely he got other job than as receptionist there). The girl or lady receptionist attendant (using jilbab) has bad attitude. I asked her to get laundry service and she answered me while chewing gum and taped something on her mobile phone.... it's so bad for chinatown reputation. Please ask her or trained her to be a good person, as receptionist as well. Bad attitude for a muslimah and chinatown citizen...."
,,Very touristy,5.0,,An incredibly safe and clean place. There are loads of places to eat and a zillion market stalls. The temples are definitely worth going in. The large shopping mall at the end is not so nice. The staff are rude and pushy.
,,Probably the best place to stay as a tourist!,4.0,,"Central, exciting food joints and always has tourists and locals shopping around! You will spot Indian temple here as well.... I would say eat in bites and small snacks so you can explore more food stalls!"
,,If you visit Singapore then Chinatown is a must.,5.0,,"On our first visit we had the famous Singapore Chili Crab it was just Yum, this time we tried the now famous Chicken Rice supposed to be the most popular I am not sure about that, we had this at the Hawker Food Centre standard portion was very small and full of bone, I can't see what is so great about this dish. Lots of stuff to buy from the street vendors at very good prices, worth a walk around to say you have been there."
,,Love it,5.0,,"Just loved it, we stayed just up the road and had dinner there nearly every night. Lots of shops and nice atmostphere. Go to the Buddah Tooth Temple just beautiful"
,,Loved it,5.0,,"We visited for the day. Was a nice experience. The eateries were good, I would strongly suggest researching the best place to eat before hand and deciding which cuisine. We weren't aware of the various cuisine available - Japanese, Thai, Chinese. There was a magnificent temple at the entrance. Lovely place to capture some amazing shots and absorb the culture. Didn't really feel pressured into buying anything. Haggling generally didn't go too well, but worthy place to buy a few souvenirs"
,,Real feel!,5.0,,"Loved playing a list to Chinatown, got a real feel for Singapore. After staying on the Marina Bay area it was nice to get amongst the hustle and bustle. Ate at a lovely Thai place in the market called Swasadee? Everything a great price, very popular and there is also a food street too, lots of seafood ++ Easily accessible by MRT"
,,Cheap and Good,5.0,,You get many good eateries around Chinatown. Very cheap as well. Quality of food is very good. Ah Hui at Fok Hai Building Hawker Centre next to China Town Point has one of the best Prawn noodle. Very good deserts at Temple street
,,Feels like I'm in china,5.0,,You will know you are in Chinatown because of the shops and decorations. Lots of bargains. Prepare to ask for discounts.
,,Authentic China Town,3.0,,A real great place for tourist. This place looks like a typical market in China. You can buy all typical souvenirs from there plenty of restaurants all pleasantly clean. You could easily spend a couple of hours there just wondering and shopping in the markets.

,,"nice place for quick meal, fruit shopping and souvenier",3.0,,"Love this place to get souvenir such as fridge magnet, keyrings, etc at reasonable cheap price
Food is ok but you have to be careful in choosing your restaurant. They are not cheap if you order seafood
Nice place to get already cut fresh fruit and you are able to get some beautiful mangoes, guava and other tropical fruits."
,,Great shopping,5.0,,Here you can buy cheap food and lots and lots of different bits to bring home. Very friendly people and good prices. Great for wandering in. Watching all the local people very interesting night.
,,Pretty as a picture.,5.0,,"China town is still good shopping, plenty to see, lots to do. Grab a bargain when you see it. Very colourful. The people are friendly."
,,Bustling markets,3.0,,Great for traditional asian food outside food stalls. Hawkers markets where u can find practically anything you want
,,nicely preserved buildings,5.0,,"Beyond an endless number of restaurants and stalls selling the usual products sold in all the world Chinatoens, it is interesting to see the old buildings behind the scene, most of which are well preserved."
,,Place for shopping,4.0,,"If you like to shop and bargain, this is the best place. You can find electronic, clothes, foods, everything is here. For window shopper just like me, you can do some sightseeing too. Foods are everywhere."
,,Same old same old,3.0,,The only reason I ever go to Chinatown is the food is extremely good and fairly priced as is the beer is the only place to get it at a reasonable price.The stalls all hold the exact same goods at the exact same price and not worth stopping as you are constantly hassled.The other reason to go is that there are some nice old buildings and temples to look at.
,,"Good colourful, bustling place to go!",5.0,,"Many things to see, you can buy almost anything. Great food with big variety available. Competitive prices and friendly people."
,,Cafes. Watering Holes. Old World Charm,4.0,,"Have always stayed in this neighbourhood on my visits. It has plenty of food options, good bars and decent hotels."
,,Food and gifts!!,4.0,,Great evening out if you want to feel like you are in Asia. Lots of venues to eat and boy lots of choice!!!!! Also an area to pick up some gifts if that's what you are after. Worth a night walk and dinner
,,Great for souvenir shopping and food tasting at Smith St.,4.0,,"Souvenirs here are cheaper than those in Bugis although goods are almost the same across all the shops. What makes this place interesting is the walk along the streets with the picturesque buildings and streetscape and of course, the famous Smith Street.

Smith Street has a lot of food stalls with decent eating areas. You can buy food from different stalls (and cuisines) and just bring them all in your selected table. Food is decently priced and filling."
,,Good experience great souvenir shopping,4.0,,This is a good place for some bargain souvenir and gift shopping. Good fun and some nice finds - practice your haggling skills. Ideal for a few Christmas stocking fillers too! Some good local eateries which were reasonably priced. There is also a temple which is worth a visit. Busy little place but good experience.
,,Shopping Shopping..........,5.0,,"amazing experience went with friends ,items are very cheaper and place for souvenir items.you need to negotiate the price ."
,,Chinaaa,5.0,,"China town is so good for shopping! Everything is cheap, bundle prices and promotions, you can also bargain depending on the item and shop owner. You can buy anything from souvenirs, shirts, tin signs, hats, frames... there are slme massage stores and cafeterias there but i didn't try them. I also suggest you keep your money hidden so you wouldn't get pickpockets around and to be able to get good deals. You need about 2 to 3 hours depending on how long you like to look. Although some shops have the same items, there are many that can have unique ones with different deals."
,,A must for Singapore,4.0,,"Easy to get lost ,so much to see and do and eat. Had no trouble with eating at stalls. Have a good look around before you buy and don't be afraid to haggle. Most shops don't open till around 11 am but stay open late. Have a good map."
,,Food galore,3.0,,While relatively small Singapore packs a lot into their Chinatown. Places to eat too many to count therefore hard to make a choice. Lots of small stores selling all the souvenirs you might want (assuming you want them). I basically walked around people watching but given it was so hot I was glad it was small.
,,disspointing,3.0,,"The streets are filled with souvenir shops and every one of them are selling the same items, magnets, pens & watches & handbags. After you go into a couple you can't be bothered with the rest & you just walk the streets."
,,Friendly and fun,5.0,,What a amazing experience went with friends and made more friends. Such a happy fun experience. A must do
,,"Shopping ""Pasalubong""",4.0,,Chinatown is a good place for souvenir items. It offers variety of cheap yet reasonable stuff. Make sure you have better negotiating skills to get the best price you want.
,,Chinatown,3.0,,"The chinatown itself is not bad... nothing special tho. You can buy all the Chinese souvenirs that you can get in home china markets too. There are very good restaurants tho! Worth to get some good, Chinese meals"
,,Ok,3.0,,"Probably the best place in Singapore if you want to but souvenirs. And eat. Cheap, very cheap. However, apart from that there's not much to see."
,,A great way to spend the afternoon,4.0,,"Singapore's Chinatown is a very vibrant community that I recently had the pleasure of wandering around for several hours one afternoon. There are great public spaces where groups of elderly gentlemen could be seen playing and observing board games while conversing amongst themselves. It gave a real community feel to this area.

There are also many many shops, stalls and eateries interspersed through the narrow lanes and streets of this area of Singapore. The shops offered a variety of goods and traditional clothing, food, and remedies.

All in all a very relaxing way to spend the afternoon while taking a stroll...."
,,Little China in Singapore,4.0,,"loved this place, actually I was in China just two weeks back and I was more happy here as I found the same souvenirs as in Shanghai much more cheaper and the food was much more tasty in the Chinatown street"
,,Great choice of food!,4.0,,"Open late, great food selection that wont hurt your budget. Good variety of restaurants, indoor and outdoor dining options and plus good place to get souvenirs!"

,,You'll Love This Place,5.0,,"This is great place to look for souvenirs and snacks were very tasty. This area is also wider than the Bugis Street, at least more choices of goods to be bought and we can get the cheaper price."
,,Souvenirs and More,5.0,,"This is a great place to buy souvenirs for people back home when you return. It's very accessible by train as well as bus. Do not pay upfront on the price that they provide you. Always ask for discounts. Don't be discouraged if they say no when you initially ask for the discount. Ask a couple more times and they'll give you one. You can also visit some of the mosques around the area which is a plus. Pagoda St is where most of their stalls are. Also, don't immediately buy at the first stall you see. Check out the other stalls first as you might find yourself being offered a better deal."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"Very authentic, and fascinating walking around this part of town. They were coming to the end of The Moon festival here, so lots of lanterns and banners and people selling and buying moon cakes! so a feeling of anticipation and excitement in the air. Visited the Temple here, who were preparing for the temple celebrations of these festivities...facinating to see!"
,,Economical,3.0,,Good place if u are looking gift and buy something economical for family and friends Lots of things to look out here quite good price

,,Singapore,5.0,,"A must when visiting Singapore. Vibrant and fun with lots of interesting sights, places to eat and bargains to be found"
,,Cheap buys in expensive city,3.0,,"China town was very close to our hotel at Orchard road. It is situated on left and right side of a major road.
Left and right side are joined by padestrian bridge and it's the best place to photograph China town at a glance.
There are several restaurants of Chinese origin but the best are the beautiful decorative food carts in between the walkway road.
There are very cheap Chinese goods for sale few of them are found in city at 4 times cost. But it's good if you want some thing otherwise it's a waste.
We enjoyed the colourful China town...."
,,Pleasant walk,4.0,,It can be a busy place on the weekend. You can haggle on the price a little. Great place to buy cheap souveniers.
,,SUITS YOUR BUDGET,5.0,,Excellent place for shopping for your near and dear ones. The price is also good and that its suits your budget. The offer 4 for 10 dollars is very trendy and popular over there.
,,Loved it,5.0,,"We actually stayed in Chinatown, so we had everything on our doorstep.

Bought some great little gifts as a reasonable price.

Food Street is amazing...so much choice.

A must see is the Budda Tooth relic museum.. Just beautiful. They have scarfs and skirts for you to cover up if you go in shorts and vest"
,,brilliant,5.0,,"I loved this place, lots to do and see. Food was very tasty and cheap, the local market has some good stalls but also a lots of stalls selling souvenirs some good some not so good. Well worth a visit, the people were friendly and always smiling."

,,An Interesting Cultural Experience,4.0,,Went on a free walking tour of China Town and a paid Breakfast Tour Both were very interesting especially the Chinese Food Market Saw live frogs for sale among the food items also lots of natural medical items
,,One of the cleanest and calmest Chinatown's I've been to,3.0,,"Chinatown has its own MRT station which makes visiting it very convenient. Upon arrival, it is easy to navigate due to good signage and maps at the MRT. Surrounding buildings add to the heritage feel, and there is the usual hustle means bustle that one would expect from Chinatown, however, I was surprised by how clean and calm everything was. There are many shops selling a variety of souvenirs and touristy stuff. I didn't buy anything but felt that there was a good variety and generally high quality standards. Tourists in the area looked happy and it was easy to walk around with my baby. Overall, it was a good experience. However, I give this only an average rating as Chinatown isn't really worth visiting unless you have something specific to do in the area."
,,Shopping,5.0,,"shopping...shopping...shopping place..hohoohoho...it's very nice place because have cheap goods, so you can shopping more"
,,Best place to have Chinese food,5.0,,"Lots of Chinese stuff, handicrafts where you can buy at good
prices. Plenty of Chinese restaurants to choose from.
Remember that only the Szechuan cuisine is available
here as we could not find any Cantonnese restaurants/
food at all. But once we chose one and had Szechuan
lunch we found that the Szechuan cuisine is so tasty
and we loved it. Lots of food kiosks with open air
seatings if you like warm weather for your meal."
,,A typical Chinatown district,4.0,,We walked to Chinatown from our hotel nearby. There were some lovely temples there and further along is the market area with colourful displays of all sorts of things you would usually find at Street Markets.
,,Singapore's Chinatown is the best,5.0,,"Compared to Chinatowns in other big cities, Singapore's is cleaner and more colorful. The streets are packed with small shops, foodstalls, fruit stands, local residents and tourists. Many of the streets are pedestrian-only. There is a ""food street"" covered by a glass roof and lined with hawker-stalls selling all kinds of local food. Arrive via the MRT and exit toward Pagoda St. As you come up the escalator from the subway, you'll fee like your entering another world."
,,Great Markets,5.0,,Chinatown has a MRT stop. If you get off here you will exit into the markets. So many stalls with great stuff at reasonable prices. Excellent food stalls with good size servings. Most people don't speak english but you can usually make yourself understood.
,,Much of the same,3.0,,"It is nice to have wander around, but many of the stalls all sell the same things, but there are bargains to be had. Some nice eating stalls."
,,Checkout the China(town),4.0,,"It is always worth a visit to most Chinatowns around the world. In Singapore it is close to the centre and full of character. However, shops seem to sell cheap touristy things and they all have the same. The food area is vast with lots of variety at great prices (eg S$3 chicken with rice). There is an MRT station right there. Lots of visitors add to the atmosphere without being too overcrowded. Of course the fact that Singapore have lots of Chinese residents adds to the feel."
,,Most amazing atmosphere.,5.0,,"I was a little dubious about Chinatown as it is mainly (but not only) a shopping market but my wife wanted to go, and i must say i am so glad that we went because the atmosphere was absolutely fantastic. It is just as you would imagine a Chinese market to be with stalls selling absolutely everything. The people are very friendly and helpful.
I never at any point felt unsafe as i have sometimes in the past at this type of thing.
There is also two fantastic Chinese temples, we only went into one which inside was breathtaking, the decor was amazing ."
,,Cheap Souveniers,5.0,,You can find souvenirs at a very cheep price from the stalls near the tooth relic temple. They are even cheaper than the Bugis street.
,,Okay but nothing special,3.0,,"Some of the food options were okay. Most of the shops/stalls had cheap souvenirs there were a few decent shops to look at, but u are never sure if the expensive items are the real mccoy or not. Lots of electronic shops but were they all legitimate items. Still worth a look and certainly a way to spend a couple of hours with some okay photo opportunities."
,,Buy buy buy - 3 for $10,5.0,,"Lovely souvenirs, cheap items, fairly good couple of seafood joints. Do not miss fridge magnets, Merlion statue miniature replicas, coffee mugs etc - 3 for $10. Singapore fabric bags - 5 for $10 Other keychains etc $1 - $2"
,,Fun to see,4.0,,"We walked from our hotel, Grand Copthorne Waterfront, to Chinatown. About 25 min walk or so. It has roads of shops selling trinkets. Small walking roads, not for cars. Some of the places sell more expensive stuff, but most sell cheap trinkets. I bought a set of chopsticks. Quite a few places that said they'd custom build us a suit. We passed. Figured if we did that and something was wrong, I couldn't do anything about it from overseas.
Also plenty of places to get food."
,,Probably the most charming in the world,5.0,,"Enjoy cheap street food (it's absolutely safe) and buy silk in the market.
Walk into antique shops.
It is charming during Chinese holidays and festivals.
Minus: there are few high-rise buildings here and they are ugly (with trousers and panties, drying outside, as in all Chinese cities)."
,,AMazing place.. lots of good food!,5.0,,This place is a MUST GO in Singapore. I've spent half a day there exploring and immersing in the Asian culture.
,,A lot cleaner than 40 years ago,4.0,,"Back in 1974 when I last was in Singapore, Chinatown was a rather exotic, albeit smelly and dirty , part of Singapore. It is now an interesting part of the city to vist, with a great variety of foods, all sorts of specialty shops (if you take the time and effort to go down some of the non tourist streets) but a lot of the touristy nick nacks are the same, shop after shop."
,,SO clean!,4.0,,"Get your Singapore souvenirs here and find amazing inexpensive food. I've ever seen a China Town so clean! And if you go to the neighborhood area, not the heart of Chinatown, but the neighborhood, you will find not only CHinesse food but italian, mexican, tapas, wine bars, bakeries and beautiful hotels to stay"
,,Colors colors,5.0,,"Went there on a busy Sunday , it was the hash walking day for the Indians as the temple is in china town , what a combination of colors , odors and ethnies in the same place, huge amount of shoes all around the temple acces, wonder how they manage to get their shoes back..."
,,Amazing,5.0,,While I have never traveled much in my life it was great to see China town everything took my interest and the people there were amazing. The food Street was great and really cheap in terms of what you get in UK currency.
,,Lots to see,4.0,,"This is a bustling part of Singapore with many attractions. Lots of interesting architecture, as well as temples, shops and a very historic atmosphere. Good to visit day or night."
,,A Great Contrast to Orchard Road,4.0,,"We had not planned to go here, but it was just a few blocks from our hotel. We had fun. There is a Hindu temple built in 1827 and now a national monument at the South Bridge Road entrance. The market atmosphere with stuff everywhere is great."
,,Buzzing,5.0,,"Visit food street for fresh cooked delights and cheap ,lots of different shops,some tacky others for getting a bargain.Gentleman can get measured for a new suit straight away the tailor says he could have it ready in a few hours ."
,,Authentic,5.0,,Many authentic restaurants selling great Chinese food. Lots of stalls selling the usual market items but some things you would only find here.
,,Bring your Cultural Appetite Here!! (As well as you physical appetite!),4.0,,"In Chinatown you will not have to look far to dive into the local culture and partake of local gems of food and tradition. Everywhere you turn, you will be offered one of a million types of local cuisine and small/large gem to purchase and take home."
,,Historical Chinatown,4.0,,Going to Chinatown is like taking a walk back in time - it still has its old time charm. The best time to visit is just before Chinese New Year when the bazaar is bustling with activities with throngs of shoppers preparing for the coming festivities. A must visit for anyone coming to Singapore.
,,Just stroll the streets,4.0,,"This is a very large area which we walked through. There were lots of businesses for souvenir shopping, and also for the local population. There were also lots of places to eat."
,,Tintin shop and quirky shopping,3.0,,"Wherever you are in the world, there's usually a Chinatown tucked in some corner . if you're tired of Singapore's endless malls, this place offers the chance to while away a couple of hours . you can have reasonably good Chinese, Thai, grab a few beers, shop for some quirky stuff or browse through the Tintin shop( yes, there's one here where you can buy official Tintin merchandise). You can even visit the Tooth Relic temple nearby"
,,"Excellent, you must go",5.0,,Great day out make sure you go down all the little side streets to get away from the most populated areas I have a fab time every time I go there. Also take your sunscreen and hat as it can be very hot but plenty of places to sit down and cool off with a cool drink. Brilliant day out but take at least half a day so you can explore the temple and all the little shops.
,,Excellent way to kill time in Singapore,5.0,,"A vast array of food, drink and shopping options. It also has an information center and cultural heritage center. There is also a Hindu and Buddhist temple within blocks of each other."
,,Shopping Centre,2.0,,"Chinatown looks like the Flea Market of Singapore. We were there only for a short while. The tour guide informed us that all ""genuine"" material was available in the market. However, the shops and establishments did not invoke much confidence, despite the reassurance in the guide's words."
,,Cool part of Singapore,4.0,,"This is a really nice district, and cheaper than many other parts. Great food is widely available from street stalls and also on the specific food street. Also great district for souvenir shopping. Easily accessible by the SMRT, surprisingly the station is called Chinatown."

,,A must visit,5.0,,This is a great place to visit. There are lots of stalls to wander through with a great variety of choice and the prices are very reasonable. We stopped and had lunch at one of the vendors - a good choice by us as it was delicious. I certainly will be back again when I return on my next visit to Singapore.
,,nice getaway,4.0,,"singapore is nice and clean and organized but if you want to escape that and feel a bit more asian, plus eat on a budget, then chinatown is a place to go. Nice alternative to all shopping malls and food courts. Meal is around 3,5 SGD and quality is good."

,,"We loved the various quarters, Chinese, Indian and Arab",4.0,,"We loved the lovely plants en route from the airport also the views from the Singapore flyer and the amazing architecture at Marina Bay. We loved the various quarters, Chinese, Indian and Arab and altogether were blown away by Singapore that we had never visited before and found to be a very pleasant, including the people."
,,Chinatown,5.0,,"Chinatown has many many restaurants, bakeries, a street market and more. It is a wonderful cultural experience. I just loved it !!"

,,Colourful! Lively and Easy on Pocket,4.0,,"When I wanted to buy souvenirs for friends home and did not feel like visit Mustafa Centre on a crowded weekend, I took MRT to China town and reached Pagoda street. Every souvenir, silk scarfs, Pashmina stoles, SG printed tea shirts, hats and silk chinese gowns and what not...
After I was tired shopping, had some good old beer with not-sure-what chicken dish - which went down well with beer. On the other side of the Pagoda street, the buddhist temple felt amazing, divine and totally disconnected from everything outside. To the end of the street and on far left, there was a Hindu temple but it was closed then.
Chinatown MacD also serves some muffins which I did not find in some other MacDs in SG.
The shopping streets are always colourful, crowded and picturesque."
,,Our Singapore Favourite Place,4.0,,"Every time we are in Singapore we make time for a visit to Chinatown, always friendly and bright with real bargains if you know what to look for. The shop keepers will help you and are not annoyed if you don't buy anything.
There is a lot of humour in their antics to get you into their shops and how can you go past Sawasdee Cafe they have the coldest Singha beer in Singapore."
,,Lot of Restaurant shops,5.0,,China town is verry Special place to visite in Singapoor.there is have a lot of restaurant and shops.if you want to visite Singapoor dont miss to visite this place.
,,Colourful Architecture and Great Food,4.0,,"Once you get past the usual Chinatown stalls selling cheap souvenirs there is some great architecture to explore (brightly coloured shophouses, temples etc). However skip the glass covered food street and go to the Chinatown food centre or Maxwell food centre for better food."
,,Vibrant,4.0,,"Worth a visit, but try the food off the stalls, rather than get sucked into the restaurants. You'll get better quality, for a fraction of the price."
,,Full of life and energy,4.0,,"If you are in Singapore it is just impossible that you do not visit Chinatown... It's a great place for food lovers who can try out the various delicacies at the Food Street... It's a great place to buy souvenirs, gifts and momento for friends and family..

There is a very beautiful Buddha Monastery and a vibrant Hindu temple adjacent to Chinatown which are a must visit..."

,,Rich chinese heritage with a good mix of multi racial culture,5.0,,"A must visit for traveller's to have a good vibe of the multi racial culture of Singapore . Along south bridge road you have Malay mosque ,hidu temple and tooth relic pagoda chinese temple where you could indulge in rich heritage of the little red dot. As for food it's a luxurious varieties of East meets west Asia style ,you name it they have it. Visit people's park one of shopping mall that still stood tall for decades and a place where you could really feel the colourful chinese culture in Singapore."
,,Interesting,3.0,,"Few closed down stalls but still much the same - all selling same sort of local wears, probably find what you want in one of the city shopping centres - with aircon"
,,A true China Town,4.0,,"Too often we find an advertised China Town to be a tourist trap. Yes, there were lots of tourists and lots of tourist kinds of things to buy but also locals shop there. It was colorful, crowded and many, many restaurants. Sad to report that McDonald's was full and not with tourists. We found gifts we needed to take home and did a lot of walking. Taxi's to and from were inexpensive"
,,Must visit the Buddhist Temple,5.0,,"We had the opportunity to visit the Buddhist Temple in China Town near the visitor information centre. from the moment you enter, it was such a peaceful wonderful place that we ended up staying 2 hours. Amazing such peace could be had in a place situated in the middle of busy Chinatown. The little roof top garden is very beautiful."
,,A great trip to Chinatown,5.0,,We had a great experience in this area and were treated so well .I bought some beautiful items but were not forced to do so.Everyone was very friendly and helpful. I have already recommend it to people.
,,The food options here at night are amazing!,4.0,,"We only went to Chinatown at night looking for somewhere to eat. The Chinatown Food Street is amazing. All the restaurants/stalls have an A cleanliness rating and will often cook things to order, so there's not a lot sitting around. We had chicken and prawn satay sticks, which were scrummy! Lots of seafood on offer too."
,,Chinatown,3.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is very small, but clean! There are lots of places to eat around here, and of course plenty of shops to buy souvenirs. The place is small, so you don't need to spend lots of time here!"
,,Chaotic streets and a few nice shops on the edge,2.0,,We are in our 60s and thought it was awful.Perhaps we should have had a guided tour.Very bright cheap gifts that we didn't like.Wouldnt go again.
,,Good Place for Buying Mementos ....,4.0,,"We were suggested to visit Pagoda Street (Temple Street) in China town by one of the hotel staff as we wanted to buy some mementos. It is one of the better places, in Singapore, to buy mementos & other household items. The prices are reasonable. The place is slightly congested but clean. It is conveniently located as the MRT station is nearby. Recommended to people who are looking for a reasonable buy"
,,good selection,4.0,,there are three shopping areas we found in Chinatown. One had Mc Donalds Fair Price and a selection of good quality shops. One more local and had some really good local eating areas and good local market type shops really fun and vibrant. The third was quite different and we felt a bit uncomfortable so really avoided it.
,,Center of town,4.0,,"China town of Singapore was located at the best location for traveller because it has many attraction here fir example Chinese temple and Indien temple. Moreover, you can buy very cheap souvenir there."
,,"Food, Souvenir, Culture",5.0,,This area of Singapore is a must in order to understand the Chinese influence on Singapore's history and Culture. Our tour guide also helped us pick good food to eat at the hawker center.
,,Chinese food for tourists,3.0,,"Lots of Chinese restaurants, yet surprisingly hard to find something attractive. Owners very keen to get you in to their restaurant. Try finding some hawker stalls instead."
,,An experiance,4.0,,Nice area Very buissy Lots of small streets and stalls people trying to sell you everything from spark plugs to a cat Some good food stalls
,,A colourful reminder of the past,4.0,,Chinatown is a nice place to spend an hour or so. The food is all very good and reasonably priced. The market is reminiscent of times gone by but the merchandise is mainly tat. For anyone searching for bags and fakes luxury goods be advised that these are not available in Singapore.
,,Buzzy,4.0,,"If you're looking for Chinese gifts at reasonable prices why not take a stroll around ChinaTown. You''ll find emporiums, and markets to cater for all needs."
,,Bustling Place To Be,5.0,,"Chinatown was definitely one of my places to go. I felt it was full of life and there was a great selection of things to do, see and eat. It felt authentic and although there were tourist directed places it was very enjoyable and was plenty of locals about. There was great food, great shopping and a wonderful atmosphere."
,,memorable,4.0,,"great architecture, good foods, unique souvenirs, very clean, accessible. i absolutely will visit this place in my future trip to SG"
,,Souvenirs Paradiseque!,5.0,,We went there to buy some souvenirs before leaving Singapore. the price was awesome! you could get 36 keychains for only SGD 10! hahahaa will definitely back!
,,I find the whole experience pleasant and happy.,4.0,,"Clean, orderly, good food, good beer, colourful shops, mild-mannered shopkeepers. If you have a pre-conceived idea about Chinatowns, that it has to be cantankerous, dirty, foody smells, loud and rude people, tourist traps.... then you might find this one a little boring. But I find the whole experience pleasant and happy."
,,A must see for shopping fans,5.0,,"Lots of stalls, small shops and very very crowded. Love the atmosphere. You can get all sorts of food. Lovely smells and sights. Spend a couple of hours here for sure."
,,Fun Experience,4.0,,Fun experience located close to our hotel. Lots of good bargains and food. Friendly and people willing to negociate but not too much. We visited an old Chinese clinic for some healing herbs. Very professional and legitimate.
,,Typical Chinatown but pretty clean.,3.0,,"Standard Chinatown w an outdoor market selling many different kinds of souvenirs and trinkets. Not cheap but but expensive, they also have an outdoor food market which was mixed with tourists and locals so it can't be bad. We never ate there. Had a foot massage and were on our way to elsewhere."
,,Great food and some neat hidden spots,4.0,,It doesn't matter if you are looking for a local Chinese feed in one of the many top restaurants or want to sit in the outdoor food market there is plenty to eat in China town. There are a few bars hidden away and an all hours MCDonalds for the late night food run. Look for the cat cafe for something different or the evening markets to buy some trinkets to take home.
,,"CHINATOWN: SIGHTS, SHOPPING, FOOD, HINDU TEMPLE",5.0,,"You really need to allow 3 hours plus for Chinatown and environs. We came by subway from Orchard Road area once, and by HopOnHopOff another time. We made time to visit the Hindu temple and paid the man at the door for a camera license. You are really welcomed here and there is so much culture, color, and things of beauty to see. There is no better place to encounter the Hindu influence within Singapore. The shops are like in Hong Kong with a wide array of merchandise from Traditional Chinese Medicine, to souvenirs, and delicious cured pork. The food in Chinatown is a MUST. Go to MAXWELL STREET and have the wonderful Hainaan Chicken at Tin Tin. This is Hawker dining at its best. The chicken is tender, juicy, fresh, and comes with rice and vegetables. There are many other choices...but the Hainaan Chicken is a must...just have other plates and share! There are other food vendors which must be sampled, if you can save some stomach capacity. The souvenirs are fun to check and to possibly buy for fun! The MRT is right there...it is clean, safe, and DELICIOUS to try."
,,Great market shopping and food,4.0,,"The night time markets are vibrant and full of souvenir type bargains. Try a trishaw ride, it's fun and cheap. There are plenty of places to eat at a reasonable price, we visited the Chinese herbalist shop. Very interesting."
,,You will have a great time here!,4.0,,"Because my hotel was right around the corner and the MRT is right smack in Chinatown, I practically lent there everyday. Plus when the thought of sampling the bak wah crossed my mind, I just had to take a stroll through there. Great souvenirs and clothing. Lots of restaurants to choose from. Overall, it's just a great time if you don't mind lol the hustle and bustle."
,,Chinatown is a must see but you see what you expect basically,3.0,,Chinatown Singapore must be checked out and there are plenty of bargains in the shops and pedestrianised streets crowded with shoppers but personally I prefer the Arab Quarter as a destination to stroll and look at less crowded shops with more upmarket goods.
,,A great shopping experience,4.0,,"This is the place to buy your souvenir from Singapore! But don't immediately buy on the first few store you will see. Explore all the shops along Temple Street and Sago Street and discover cheap and unique souvenirs!

I never been to our own Chinatown here in the Philippines so I cannot compare the two. I was expecting that the place will be too crowded and not that clean but I was wrong. The place is still clean like the whole Singapore. :P

There are temples around the area that you may visit. Lots of restaurant. There's the Chinatown Food Street and the famous Maxwell Food center. So this is a must visit for foodies out there."
,,Almost as good as the old Singapore,4.0,,"You can get the MRT to Chinatown and exit the station at Pagoda Street and you will emerge into the main market area. Pagoda, Smith and Sago streets are the main open market areas with lots of shops and lots of stalls selling high price as well as cheap and tacky souvenirs. You have to bargain at the stalls and even in the shops you can give it a go. Many of the shops are Aladdin's caves so you need to poke around and you are sure to find some treasure to buy. There are a good number of eating places in the area and all are unbelievably cheap at $2.50 - $4.50 for a main meal. It's very like the old hawker markets that were set up in places like Orchard Road at night.
The Buddha Tooth relic temple is in this area and well worth a visit. The Maxwell Hawker centre is across the road but we had our worst meal in Singapore there.
There are also a number of genuine massage parlours for necks, backs and feet. Choose a reputable one maybe with a Tripadvisor sticker on the door or check them out on this site before you go. You will also see the odd massage for men only!
Chinatown is a great place to visit but watch your belongings. My friend was there three weeks before me and she had her bag slashed and lost her purse with credit cards and her phone."
,,Colorful and awesome!,5.0,,"Chinatown needs a whole day seriously if you want to explore it properly as there's so much stuff to see, eat,shop and do!!
Do visit Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, Sri Mariamman Temple

Chinatown Complex, Maxwell food centre for food (There's Amoy centre and countless street vendors all around too)

Smith St. & Pagoda St. for shopping - lots of souvenirs like keychains, fans, chopsticks, magnets, lanterns, masks, traditional Chinese clothing for men, women, kids etc etc etc
(there's a Tintin shop too selling overpriced but great stuff if you're interested)

Nearest MRT - Chinatown"

,,Touristy area,3.0,,"So I come here often but not for the main strip where you Will find overpriced items and restaurants targeted at tourists.

Explore the back streets, Hawker centres, people's park shopping complex where you can find an array of goodies.

Outside of people's park there's a multi story shopping area with small shops and here you will find very cheap toiletries, perfumes, and all that other stuff which will.cost u a lot elsewhere.

This is one of my favorite places to.visit when in Singapore you just need to know where to find the treasures."
,,Mini China in Singapore,4.0,,Authentic chinese area in Singapore. One would get a real feel of China. Shopping in chinatown is a must. All kinds of items can be shopped cheaply. Buddha Relic Temple is a must see. There is a guided tour on Saturdays.
,,Convenient shopping and dining place in full Asian style,4.0,,"To me, Chinatown is not just a Chinese habitat but a community for all Asians. It has the best Asian food to offer and provides all sorts of souvenirs with bargain price. Go buy a 'No durian' magnet, a miniature Merlion statue, or a 'Singapore is a FINE city' T-shirt and amaze your friends.

Another attractions in Chinatown include Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Maxwell Food Centre. Try the renowned Tien Tien Hainanese chicken rice at Maxwell and treat yourself a bean curd jelly as dessert.

You can seek assistance and find souvenirs at the tourist service centre behind the Buddha Tooth Temple.

Chinatown is highly accessible by MRT at Chinatown Station. You may also reach there by SBS Bus Route No. 80."

,,Chinatown in Singapore,4.0,,Chinatown in Singapore in the day tends to be a little quiet. It comes to life in the night. I would recommend visiting Chinatown in the after 6pm as it is cooler and al shops and stores are open. It is a very colourful and brightly lit place. Authentic Singapore cuisine is available in casual setting. Definitely a must place to visit.

Access is very easy - the Chinatown MRT is right there. Well worth a visit, day or night. Good for all ages."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,This area does have its own atmosphere. It's good to see that the older buildings have been saved giving an idea of the old Singapore. Most of the shops are selling the cheaper souvenirs but the food shops are good and worth a visit.
,,Feels like in China !,5.0,,"Charcterised by street stalls, malls and wondeful eateries, Chinatown is a must visit for any visitor while in Singapore !"
,,Such a Lively Area,5.0,,"Visiting Chinatown is a must when you are in Singapore! This area is filled with cultural delights - friendly people, delicious food, temples and more! Plus, it has some of the cheapest eats in the country!"

,,My Favorite One,5.0,,on weekend i always go there to have some walk around with my chinese friends and we all have some food together. and eating noodles. and most of all good attraction places are quite nearby from here so we just go around by walk and visit..;)
,,THE place for souveniers.,5.0,,"Don't buy anything for anyone back home until you've come to Chinatown first. This place is a treasure trove of all the souvenirs you could wish for!

For something a little more unusual, if you walk all the way to the back there is a hindu temple well worth a visit, and the shops along that street have nice antiques and ornaments - there is even an old map shop just opposite the hindu temple there.

Worth a visit: Chinese Heritage Museum is amazing as it shows mock-ups of the actual houses the first chinese immigrants had to live in. Opposite that is a patio style restaurant on the corner. Food here is good....costs a little more than the more local places, but if you are tired of shopping and sightseeing you can get some great food, a cold beer and a little break from the crowds.

Ok to visit on a rainy day, as the shophouses all have paths undercover allowing you to walk around without getting too wet. These paths will a little more congested though, but rain in this area shouldn't stop you having fun."
,,Stalls galore,5.0,,"Had a great time. Took the mono rail, travel by foot, finally found the place. Good place, many stalls, souvenirs to look at, variety of food."
,,Brief visit to ChinaTown.,4.0,,ChinaTown was easy to access via the MRT. Short walk and you were amongst it. We found the people were very friendly and the town itself had plenty to offer. Inside shopping was a bonus s it was so humid and hot walking around.I found the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum - Dynasty Style absolutely stunning and spent a lot of time being mesmerised by the uniqueness and history of it. Bought a lovely souvenir of the Temple with a coin and was given a package including 10 postcards of the Temple which I appreciated. The food was very good as were the drinks and not overpriced - spent a thoroughly enjoyable day there.

,,Singapore Chinatown Attractions could be Much More Enhanced !,3.0,,"Local authorities from NEA and TPB could work harder hand-in-hand to further ENHANCE this unique historical Chinatown Splendours by :
1. Extensive Upgrading of the archaic Smith Street Wet Market @ B1 based on the renown world class Melbourne Fish Mart, and
2. Provide solar air-conditioning to the L1 small stallholders selling misc. goods, and
above all,
3. Engage renown food court architects to redesign the entire L2 to house the few hundred hawkers food stalls with air-con and comfortable chairs and tables ..."
,,Great souvernir shopping and food,3.0,,These street are full of shops and if you need any souvenirs wait buying them till you go here. Maybe they are slightly more expensive than in the little villages but you can defenitely find anything you qant here and bargain. On Saturday at 6:55 they will do some Dragon dances on Pagoda street. Food street is also really fun for eating during the day or evening.
,,Cheap Shopping,4.0,,Cheap shopping and eats in the markets. Plenty of tailors on hand if you want a shirt or suit made up too.
,,Street food,4.0,,"A paradise for street food lovers. The juices are a must try. Good place to pick up travel mementos like bags, fridge magnets,etc."
,,Two sides of Singapore in one area,4.0,,"Chinatown is split into two area by Eu Tong Sen Street. The southern area is for tourists, with the market, temples, museum, the Buddha temple. Preserved shop houses give an impression of the past. Various souvenir shops offer all kinds of memorabilia. The northern part with People's Park Complex shows the real Singapore. The market offers a variety of local food, it's packed with local people and the shiny image of Singapore gets a touch of reality. Do see them both."
,,Must visit market for any tourist!,5.0,,Chinatown is a heaven for people interested in buying small trinkets and baubles at cheap price. It is also near to Chinatown MRT.
,,For those fancy variety of street food,3.0,,"If you are first timer, you might want to stay a bit longer in Chinatown as its offer varieties of things including cheap souvenirs, massage, local hand made products etc. Most importantly food. Food are plenty and varieties. From cheap atreet food to seafood and fine dining
The ambience are cool with shops decor and some street performers
Nice place to walk and explore and easy access to train station, shopping center etc"
,,Full of street stalls,3.0,,Very interesting place to see SO clean and organized a great 1/2 day out shopping plus the Buddha temple is right there too great to see thank you all
,,Must see,5.0,,"Great Restaurants, shopping and plenty of other attractions. No visit to Singapre is complete without a visit to Chinatown to immerse yourself in Singapore's Chinese heritage. While here you can still catch a bit of the atmosphere of what the Old singapore was like back in the 70's & 80's with the old chinese style buldings and shops. Chinatown is a part of Singapore full of character and vibrancy"
,,Great food!,5.0,,"Huge Chinatown! Great food venue, lots of food vendors to match any palate; venue cleaner than many other Chinatowns visited. Market place is loads of fun for all sorts of trinkets and souvenirs. I'd eat here often if I lived there!"
,,"Few, if any, redeeming features",1.0,,"It makes London's Chinatown look clean and authentic. Lots of cheap food stalls about, but generally nowhere to sit down and eat, well not unless you want to sit on a step next to a bloke mending shoes in the middle of the street, or others chain smoking. Plenty of shops selling clothes and electronics, but the prices aren't much cheaper than the UK. Most of the rest resemble 99p shops. There's plenty of better areas to visit whilst in Singapore - pretty much all of them in fact!"
,,Little disappointed,3.0,,I expect something like nice food from china town but i could not find good place to eat after stop by a few places and the stall mostly sold not quality product and lots of souvernirs will mess u up....
,,Don't Miss,5.0,,"Old Singapore...Good food! Lots to see! Venture around you will not be bored! Talk w people, they are friendly this side of town, Curious even! Can shop...but not even necessary, just look at architecture n people!"
,,Friendly,5.0,,Went there twice. Great eating places & good value for money at $2.00 shops. Easy access via hop on hop off
,,Chinatown,3.0,,"October 2015 . This ""Chinatown"" is nothing to do with the real Cinatown . It is made only for Tourists . Not recommended , they are many other good Places for Example Little India . ."
,,Chinese New Year 2015,4.0,,"I visited on this date thinking it was the thing to do being in Singapore. It was very crowded as you would expect. But not as spectacular as I had hoped. Many market stalls selling all sorts. The fireworks didn't go on for long but they were so close the ash was falling on the crowd! They had some entertainment which was not up my alley and I didn't feel the same spirit of celebration I'm used to in the UK. But hey, I saw in the Lunar New Year in Chinatown! I think the build up to it might be more entertaining."
,,Interesting mix of old and new,4.0,,We strolled around Chinatown after travelling by MRT and alighting at Chinatown MRT. The station connects you directly to Pagoda Street which is actually a market street closed off to traffic with various alleys running off it. Great spot to buy a few cheap souvenirs to take home. Most of these shops sell similar items so it does get a bit much of the same after a while. The original shophouses which remain in this area are interesting and the Sri Mariamman Temple at the far end of Pagoda Street is worth a visit as is the BuddhaTooth Relic Temple.
,,Vibrant Busy Entertaining Colourful Exciting,5.0,,"Singapore Chinatown a great place for all the senses. Great array of market stalls, bars and eating houses to watch a busy world pass by and people watch. Interesting local stores selling there wares and a wet market in a nearby car park basement."
,,Colour.Sights.Sound,4.0,,"oh to have had more time here. what fun roaming the stalls, and how do you choose where to eat ! so many choices. lots of fun, we got there on the HOP bus. easy peasy"
,,Viator Trishaw Ride in Chinatown,1.0,,Beware that this tour is not as described. There is no longer any calligraphy demonstration and souvenir fan. Website has not been updated to say that they drop you off at the door of a medicine shop instead of craft center. Nothing more than a shopping trip. Ride the bumboat on your own at the harbor and forget about this tour. Worst Viator experience I have had in any city. Restaurant was mediocre. Chinatown shopping can easily be done on your own. Book your own trishaw tour with another company and actually get A TOUR instead of just a ride. This experience provided nothing more than bus transportation. No tour to speak of.....
,,Nice place for souvenir,4.0,,"Have a lot of good deal here for souvenir.. got 36 keychain just for 10 dollars! a lot of nice stuff too.. passport case, bag tags, a cute pig doll, etc.
have a nice food road too (its really in the road) and it's quite cheap.. you can get a meal with $5.. recommended to come at night, it's more beautiful with a lampion.."
,,Temples and souvenirs,4.0,,"A busy place full of souvenir shops, various temples and the building have so much character. A step back in time with various herbal therapy products that can be made there and then. You can easily spend three or four hours just walking around and shopping a few silk fans and scarfs for yourself and friends but don't forget to bargain for the price."
,,Lovely atmosphere,4.0,,Loads and loads of places to eat. Food is very good but I couldn't recommend any one restaurant. There are also lots of little shops to browse through. All shops and restaurants charge tax on top of price and an extra 10% service charge in restaurants so no need to tip.
,,Nice location with plenty to do.,4.0,,"I actually had a hotel in Chinatown. It's a great area with plenty to explore. We spent a good amount of time just walking the area, visiting bars, coffee shops, and the like. 8/10 would go again."
,,So love this place!,4.0,,"Went to walk around this place and ended up buying ""pasalubongs"". The place offers cheaper pasalubongs compared to bugis. I also love their ""food court"" were you'll have a variety of choices of Chinese food which is my most favorite food. :)"
,,Tacky souvenir heaven,3.0,,They say Chinatown has something for everyone. Unfortunately I couldn't find anything (food excepted) Rows and rows of tacky souvenirs do not excite me and I felt like it was Ground hog day as everyaisle replicated the previous. Restaurants however are plentiful and you should be able to dine adequately on any budget
,,Chinatown mix,4.0,,"Chinatown is a mixture of Hawker center, food street, restaurants, plenty of souvenir shops and temples. A lot of tourist stuff but underneath it appears to be a living community. I liked the area."
,,Souveni spot,4.0,,"A good place to buy some cheap and good quality souvenirs. Try to visit in the weekend for more discount, sometime it can be cheaper then Bugis"
,,My Favorite,4.0,,During Chinese New Year will be the best time to visit Chinatown. There will be festivals and also you can see some art performances on Smith Street.
,,Fantastic place,5.0,,"Chinatown is full of surprises. There are signs scattered around the are explaining the history of the street you are in or the building you are looking at.
The architecture has been preserved and there is a huge variety of shops, bars, temples and markets to visit. All a short block away from the tall buildings of the city.
Well worth a visit!"
,,Full of food,5.0,,The entire area is filled with places to eat. It's also a great place to get some souvenirs. It's definitely a place to visit when in Singapore.
,,Worth visiting.....,4.0,,"Nicely decorated Chinatown, very nice food courts, lots of markets, bargaining available.........only cash and dont forget to call them uncle and auntie, for better price ;)"
,,Wonderful family visit.,4.0,,"We had a wonderful visit with shopping opportunities for all and some absolutely delicious food, brilliant visit."
,,Cheap souvenirs in Singapore :),4.0,,"Easy access, if you use MRT blue line. The stop - Chinatown (of cource :) ).
Like everywhere else this part of town is colourful and lively. Magnets for refrigerator only 2 SGD. :)
Strange, because quite clean...
Checked the prices of food at the restaurants, it seemed to me expensive. Chinese food I guess must be cheaper than local food. Maybe I'm wrong.
Well, visit it."
,,Smith St hawkers very tourist friendly,3.0,,Spent an evening around food street checking out the market stalls and sampling various food. Most Vendors spoke good English and were very helpful to us hawker newbies. Went at around 6pm on a Thursday and was able to easily get a table. Was getting busier when we left around 7:30 but a few seats were still available.
,,Do not visit the people's park at night,4.0,,"Went to China town recently and after getting off the mrt went to the people's park. That was a mistake. It was pa ked and we got constantly stared at by alot of drunk and some high Chinese people. We crossed the bridge to the other side of the street and it was a total different atmosphere. Friendly, welcoming and relaxed. Feel free to haggle a bit on prices. Even though I'm not normally a fan of Chinese food We had a bite to eat while there and it was very good. Service was excellent. If you are in singapore for a couple of days it's well worth a visit. Just not the people's park"
,,LOVE!,5.0,,Yes stalls are much of a muchiness but everyone is so friendly. And the food... divine and dirt cheap. Some of the tastiest meals I have had in Singapore.
,,Lively,5.0,,Great part of town to visit. Easily accessed by mrt. Plenty of restaurants and bars. Good place for a walk!

The food is cheap, beer is cheap and there is a lot of great shopping.
We found the food in Food street to be really nice.
This is the cheapest place to eat and drink in Singapore."
,,Great souvenir shops,4.0,,Nice busy little part of town. Any time I went past or through there were lots of people about. Great for souvenirs and good food too from lots of different food stalls. Reasonably priced also. Visited the replica Buddhist temple which is really nice and is free to visit. Definitely worth a trip to Chinatown if you are in Singapore!
,,Never tire of it,4.0,,"I can,and have, spent hours here, just wandering the streets and taking in all the sights and smells. Yes, it's very touristy, but you can get lots of bargains to take home. There are endless shops and places to eat. You can also visit the temples and mosque at the end of the street. Come at night and enjoy food street, although it's not as quaint as it was"
,,Chinatown is a great place for souvenir hunting,5.0,,"I was in Chinatown looking for souvenirs. Many shops with colourful items on sale at a good price. Food is good and affordable. Very colourful decor and there are signs to mark SG50 Singapore's 50th year of independence. Check it out, street shops, shopping centres, restaurants, and safe eat street food from acclaimed vendors. The best of new and old with history."
,,well worth a visit,5.0,,"good for an explore, most of the shops sell toot, but some interesting items, cheapest beers in Singapore at café / restaurants where you can watch the world go by."
,,Loved this place,5.0,,"We loved the great shopping, everything was so cheap. Plenty of places to eat cheaply. It was hot in the day time but much better at night."

,,Colorful,5.0,,"Nice place to walk, great place to find a meal. Scenic and quaint with trendy restaurants and old fashioned restaurants."
,,One of the friendliest Chinatowns in the world!,5.0,,"My husband and I moved to Singapore almost five years ago. Whenever we have foreign guests or business colleagues, we take them to Chinatown. It amazes people with its friendliness and cleanliness. Also, the Chinatown MRT exits to Pagoda Street where many temples are located. Try to see as many as you can, especially Sri Mariamman, Buddha's Tooth, and Thian Hock Keng. Plan at least six hours to tour Chinatown properly, exploring narrow lanes, temples, souvenir stalls, and food alley.
Try the local foods there, sharing with your friends and family. Try to get docent (guide) tours of the temples which will fascinate you. The women of Singapore donated their gold for the relic room of gold at Buddha's tooth Temple. Chinatown is totally amazing."
,,Markets and architecture are interesting,4.0,,Some of the markets and the architecture are colorful. Beware of food stalls with mostly non-English marquees - pay AFTER receiving your order!
,,Interesting but pungent,3.0,,"Decided to have a walk through Fort Channing Park one morning and then continued on to Chinatown to have a look at the street market. There are some good bargains to be had in the market although we suffered from the ""we'll not buy it here, it may be cheaper at another stall"" syndrome. Unfortunately the heat and the overpowering smell of MSG-laden fish (especially in the indoor market) meant that we didn't go back to the first stalls so we came away with nothing."
,,A must on your list,4.0,,"Good and cheap shopping, try the juices there, visit the temples, and must try steam chillie fish at Tanjong Pagar"
,,Home to many good attractions,4.0,,"From food, to shopping, all types of therapy are available. One of the cleanest Chinatowns globally, it truly has everything for the locals and tourist alike. From Lim Chee Guan to food streets, temples and pubs."
,,Vibrant mix,4.0,,"There are lots of things to do in China town, we stayed about a 5 minute walk away and wandered in 2 or 3 times a day. Lots of street markets mixed with traditional businesses. Food street is must for those who love Asian foods or looking to save money we ate dinner for as little as $10, chicken rice and satay."
,,Grab some bargains,4.0,,We went here 3 times while we were in Singapore for a week. Amazing food choices which are very cheap and heaps of souvenir shopping that is really cheap. You cannot stay in Singapore and not visit Chinatown.
,,Beautiful Place Full of Old Fashioned Building and Awesome Food,5.0,,Chinatown is an awesome place for trying traditional food and traditional Nan Yang style buildings. I suggest that going there in the evening so you can try Singaporean food and then take a walk and look for old fashioned building. You can experience the traditional life of a Singaporean.
,,Nice shopping walk,4.0,,So many street shops and restaurants we had evening walk around this town and lots of shopping stuff for cheep prices. Nice and friendly people in this China Town. Not much recommend to but electrical items (eg: cameras).Most sellers are trying to do these sales looks cheet way. they try to do fast sales with offers but do not much happy to touch and physically check the quality these items.
,,China in Singapore,4.0,,"Well worth a visit, even if just to walk around and see the sights. Loads of stalls of various products and foods. Can pick up some bargains but need to shop around and also barter price. Quality in some places better than others, but some great local products on offer."
,,China Town Singapore,5.0,,You can spend hours just wandering around the shops and restaurants . Some very strange sights and smells but well worth the visit as you don't need to spend money if you do not want to . Try and visit when of the festivals is on to see the streets and shops decorated .

,,Chinatown Breakfast,4.0,,"Haze notwithstanding we headed on down to Chinatown for a local breakfast.
Its a lovely floor just above the market at the junction of the Indian temple.
The roast meats compete with clear soup noodles Singapore Laksa and little rice cakes smothered in sambal.

Breakfast was amazing for the aromas and scents and sights of the market."
,,China's touch in Sinpore,5.0,,It was very near from the hotel I stayed at in Singapore and I used to go there a lot to buy fruits and to take the bus also a lot of money changer with the best rates are there.
,,Find the hidden gems,4.0,,"Singaporean's china town is busling with shops and restaurants. In the middle is a large Hindu temple that is open to the public. Also be sure to find what is commonly believed to be the oldest Chinese temple in Singapore in Telok Ayer street. Surrounded by shophouses that now house businesses, is this functioning temple. This small quaint temple has just gone through another refurbishment and is looking quite new with its slick of paint but it has a lovely history. The china town heritage centre with its presentation and displays on the beginnings of Singapore and the life of the Chinese migrants in Pagoda Street is well worth a visit to see how Chinatown started and functioned in the past, before it was the touristy place it is today. They have recreated a shophouse living quarters to give a good visual idea of life in the early days of Singapore. On the streets you can find shops to get you name painted in Chinese characters, buy good luck coins, cheap trinkets and souvenirs. See the TCM shops with their dried sea horses and other concoctions to heal ailments. A fun, educational visit."

,,Hawker Center and Fresh Produce Highlights,3.0,,"Apart from walking at ground level and in the touristy district of Chinatown, take a short walk off the beaten path and head for the big building that houses the local market to explore the fresh produce sold in the morning.

,,Chinatown,5.0,,"Food options are massively obsessing! And the old china feeling with its exteriors and culture, superb!"
,,China Town,3.0,,"Great little place very close to Singapore's city centre. However, it's just like a China Town in any other city"

,,souvenirs shopping,4.0,,Liked the narrow street with the various stall with mostly souvenirs. If you in need of a souvenir its the cheapest I think to go too. Not much else just some clothes but nothing to spectacular. Worth the experience and could spend about an 1-2 hours there.
,,Cheap Chinese stuff all around,3.0,,"Visit this place only if you are interested in buying cheap chinese stuff and souvenirs of Singapore, other wise this place is less than average. But you can visit once to see how the streets look"

,,stop for chili crab at a street vendor,5.0,,"As one expects, the Chinatown area is bustling with people.

A Singapore must!"
,,Dissapointing,1.0,,"I thought there would be street stalls, lots to see, NOTHING! We were very disappointed, but don't let this put you off Singapore, so much to do and see, it is an exciting city, I will go back, just give China Town a miss."
,,Lots of souvenir stalls.,4.0,,"Fascinating place to while away a few hours. Huge amount of stalls selling souvenirs. The prices vary so it pays to have a walk around before buying. Prices inexpensive. Plenty of people offering to make suits shirts etc. Did buy some souvenirs, quality not bad.There is a main walkway which then goes off into lots of little off shoots. Take time to explore."
,,Very Nice,4.0,,"One of the better chinatowns I've been to. To a certain extent, it feels like you're actually in China. Nothing much to shop around, just local touristy souvenirs and the likes. Very accessible as the MRT goes straight to the heart of Chinatown. Overall environment is really nice as well."
,,If you like busy then ........,3.0,,"This is a typical Chinatown that you may find in many parts of the world. Busy, full of hassles and crowded. Not for me but it is a Singapore experience. Plenty of bars and restaurants nearby"
,,Chinatown Disneyland ...,4.0,,"This must be the cleanest, neatest, best organized Chinatown I have ever visited! And I have been to a bunch of them. Everything is so proper and tidy, to a point that it feels like you are walking around a theme park. The food street is covered against the rain even. After a while you notice that all shops are selling pretty much the same at same prices. Still a very beautiful visit."
,,"Still fascinating, no matter how many times you visit",5.0,,"Wewent there primarily for food, but found the whole precinct interesting. There is still enough of the old atmosphere, the narrow tenement buildings, and the quirky shops, to justify a long walking tour. The restaurants there are excellent value (although the food courts are still by far the best value!)"
,,One of the best Chinatowns !!,4.0,,"What a great little area to either have a bite to eat, shop for souvenirs, or simply relax and watch the older Singaporean men play checkers."
,,Anyone for a fake,4.0,,"Lots of stalls to choose from for snacks and eating, shopping galore mostly fakes etc make sure you bargain, watch your purse or personal belongings and smile while haggling! Take time out to sit and have a cold beer and watch it all go on, very interesting place considering Singapore as a whole is so organised and clean"
,,Chinese decorations in every inch....,4.0,,"Like china town any where else. very crowded, but lots of flowers and decorations. If you have time, you can wonder around, if not, you will able to see most of it, during the hop on hop off bus tour."
,,Great way to spend a few hours,5.0,,"What a great place to buy trinkets to take home to the family. Many hours can be spend browsing in the many stalls. There one street that is devoted to eateries, great variety of Chinese food"
,,Change,3.0,,I'm here every fortnight and its constant transformation is disconcerting. The local trades are moving out in droves and renting to non traditional trades. It's fast losing its character and I fear the loss will be irreversible.
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,We stayed in Chinatown and were suitable you impressed with the people and the shopping. Places to eat were a plenty and the food is always good.
,,Great place for shopping with authentic historical buildings,4.0,,"this is a great place to get cute, authentic souvenirs. Cheap and simply gorgeous with buildings that were historical, quaint and there's an Indian temple in one of the many streets. So accessible by MRT. So many food stalls there too and all delicious!"
,,The Original Singapore Walks,5.0,,"My wife and I did the ""Singapore's Chinatown: Guided Walking Tour"" through the web site in the review title. We loved it. Had a great incite into the history of Singapore's Chinese population and what life was like when they first came. We also had an excellent look around the precinct and were guided to great local places to eat. Highly recommend this experience. (about 2.5 hours)"
,,Good place for shopping,4.0,,I walked through Chinatown and bought some nice souvenirs. It is a cheap market with some good stuff to buy. You can spend here a lot of time for shopping and looking around. I recomend to go here and have a look into the big market and the nice people around
,,Hot but ok,3.0,,Went here on a very hot day in Singapore. Lots of stalls in the market selling lots of the same gear. Good place to get souvenirs for home. Lots of food places on offer. Taxi was hard to get from the taxi stand by the temple- lots of drivers simply refused to take you. Walk into Temple Street to get taxi as it is one way and where they drop people off. Would recommend going in the cool of the evening.
,,souvenir and food,4.0,,"this place you can find a lot souvenir with good price. Some of it better than you can buy at lucky plaza. And a lot food court you can find in here. Since this place is big, better you find what you want to do in here. So you not exhaust from walking around."
,,"Great neighbourhood gwith lots of interesting buildings, shops and gardens",5.0,,On my last trip to Singapore in 1997 I thought it was all new. In fact Singapore has a lot of very nice neighbourhood's each with their selection of shophouses and parks. Great place for bargains too.
,,Where to buy SG Souvenirs,5.0,,"This is the Place where you can buy Trinkets to bring back home. The CHEAPEST Place to Buy souvenirs in the whole Singapore. Especially during Chinese New Year, Chinatown Streets are flooded with Chinese delicacies that's up for grabs- FREE TASTE! So don't forget to bring your own water. :)"
,,Touristy but fun!,4.0,,"Singapore's Chinatown is world famous for cheap shopping and cheap restaurants. Because of this, the main streets (Pagoda and Smith St) are extremely touristy. But other than similar tourist places, this didn't seem to have an effect on the eateries. The quality of the food is great and the prices moderate for Singapore."
,,A must to visit during special occasions,4.0,,"We always go there for the wet market to get some special ingredients at the lower ground. If you think of food, do go to the second floors, as they have many variety of chinese food. at the main street of chinatown also full of restaurant and roadside stalls. During special occasion such as Chinese New Year and Lantern Festival, the street were full of red lanterns and it is bright and lively."
,,Thought this would be different...,3.0,,"... well, it was a cleaner Chinatown vs all the other Chinatowns I've visited so definitely a plus there. There are tons of souvenir shops once you exit the MRT that you will be confused (I was) as to where and what to buy. The contents of the different souvenir shops were almost similar so the price point is really the defining factor. The Buddha Tooth and Relic Museum is also here in Chinatown, so walking farther, there will be less of these souvenir shops and you'll see more of the normal Chinese stores that sell tea, jewellery, fans, chopstix, mooncake, etc. So if you want a different kind of souvenir from Singapore Chinatown, definitely take a walk and explore more."
,,Souvenir Shopping,3.0,,"We bought all our souvenirs here. We caught the MRT (train) here and there are lots of tailors, jewellery, souvenir stalls here."
,,Chinatown Singapore,4.0,,Great place to spend a few hours wondering around. Lots to see and do. The people in the information centre were very helpful. Lots of different market stalls and plenty of places to eat. We needed to use the bathroom and had to pay before we could enter a bit strange. The temple is worth a look very impressive
,,Another Chinatown..,4.0,,"Nothing special here.. if you visited a Chinatown in any other big city. Markets, merchandise, food, all the expected stuff. It is safe though."
,,Hawker Centre is a must!,4.0,,Was surprised by how much there is to explore here. My favourite experience is definitely the visit to the famous hawker centre. The pot stickers and xiaolongbaos were to die for! my friend and i devoured them in seconds. There's also a ton of korean bbq restaurants around.
,,Always a must do,4.0,,"One of the cheaper places to shop, food delicious n cheap, nice to walk thru even if not shopping, lots of interesting things to see."
,,Great place to explore!,5.0,,"This place is where you could see a great Chinese community. A lot of Chinese architecture details. Don't miss Telok Ayer for the great Chinese temples and Smith Street for good food. Best of all, there’s free Wi-Fi throughout the Chinatown area so you can continue to be plugged in while you sightsee, shop and eat."
,,Must see!,5.0,,"When you go here, go down the side streets and into the little malls. You will see so much more than what is on the main drag for all the tourists. The people are so friendly! Came across a local stage show that had locals singing. So fun! The atmosphere is just electric! Also found a hand and foot fish spa for $8 for 15 minutes. Also got a pizza like bread for dinner for $1. We will go here a few times before we leave!"

,,"Hustle, Bustle and Hagling",4.0,,"China Town KL is probably one of those places you either love or hate, personally I loved it, the colour and bustling crowds, the many stalls selling everything from food to clothes to phones and of course rip off fashion and accessories.
China town is the perfect place to pick up some bargain gifts for the family, In my case, i wanted gifts for my wife and daughter, and was able to pickup some very well made purses and handbags for a very reasonable price, the secret have a look at several stores before you buy, make sure you know what you want then throw yourself into some good natured haggling, it is great fun and all part of enjoying China town.
After your shopping spree head to one of the many cafes for a wonderful meal and a Tiger beer."
,,A place where you can find everything,4.0,,"The place have a good location , easy to reach by walking or taxi. It's a good place for shopping and watching the street life. Great place for souvenirs and lots of photographic stops.

,,Markets galore,3.0,,Go by the underground mrt to get there.stops right at Chinatown.nice cultural feel and a clean environment.can get very crowded . lovely decorations hanging above.must do if in singapore.the $1.20 ice creams in a wafer from the ice cream cart are the best

You can find all types of Chinese good ,antiques and you can try bargaining in singapore style .can and cannot .It is in open area with small shops on both sides .

,,Chinese Singapore,3.0,,"Not the greatest Chinatown I have ever visited but still a Chinatown! Chinese restaurants, medicine, shops. It's relatively small compared to what I expected. Lots of people around and a few cats!"
,,Great place to eat,4.0,,"You can get good food in every corner in Singapore. However, the atmosphere and the crabs are quite special in Chinatown. Worth to try."
,,Lots of things to see,3.0,,"Lots of things to see here. and of course lots of delicious food to eat, but the problem is, it lacks hygiene especially inside the building. The toilet is not really hygienic, but we still have to pay for that. I was a lil' bit a surprised though, when I came across a sex shop. But it didn't surprised me that much since I've encountered the same thing the previous day when I was in Bugis Street."
,,"It's okay, cheaper souvenirs",3.0,,"Lots of durian in the air so a lil smelly at times, delicious cheap street food and cold beers needed for the heat of the day. Worth a visit. Its close to a really nice temple. Little India is cheaper to get necessities like sweeties, shampoo, sunglasses etc."

,,chinaland,4.0,,"Lots of stuff happening around you, soak into the chinaland experience and buy a few trinkets or indulge in a few paus"
,,Core of S'Pore Heritage,4.0,,"Chinatown remains S'Pore core sightseeing site. There was a time when they were thinking of eradicating it. But due to local and worldwide complaints, they decided to renovate the entire area instead. And yes, they did a great job not only to preserve S'Pore heritage but to revamp all these beautiful and colourful traditional Chinese townhouses. Actually, Chinatown is much larger than the few streets where tourists come to visit these days. Do not stay there only and go and explore the whole area: you will be happily surprised."
,,ok,5.0,,"Very interesting district, feel so different, not like in other parts of Singapore. didnt find any special things, but just for a walk"
,,What a place!,5.0,,"Went to China town while visiting Singapore and fall in love in this place. Busy, friendly loud ;) You can shop, eat and drink, visit cultural places and not being stopped by strangers Absolutely love it"
,,soveneirs galore.,5.0,,"Visited Chinatown 3 times and each time saw something new. Brought lots of things I didn't need but enjoyed the haggling. Got some bargains. You can haggle on your own but if you have someone who speaks the native language then you will invariably get better deals. I think they see the tourists coming a mile off ...... and rightly so, I suppose. We did eat there once but didn't particularly enjoy it, so went to McDonalds on the other occasions. But on the whole, love Chinatown."
,,we have seen far better,2.0,,food poor loads of cheap junk shops not very well lit up at night we would not recommend go to little india far better

,,Chinatown,4.0,,Alot of shops to buy souvenirs n clothing . People are friendly . Theres a nice asian resturant on a corner .food was very nice and not too expensive . Definitely would visit there again .
,,A Colourful Spot,5.0,,A walk in China Town is something that I was told about by friends who had earlier visited the place. It is indeed colourful place. Lots of shops selling anything & everything from curios to electronics. Bargaining is a must. However quality could be a question as we discovered when we returned back home though it is not so with everything. The food street is awesome but not for us as everything coming out of the same station - pork included so we gave it a miss. However one needs to visit for sure.
,,Well worth visiting and would certainly return,5.0,,"Amazing and so many bargains, I bought two beautiful pashminas, four shopping bags, and my husband bought two shirts only $10 each and a Casio watch"
,,My Favorite Place in Singapore,5.0,,"I personally adore Singapore's Chinatown. There are lots of restaurants, hostels, hotels, shops and a MRT stop right in the middle of it. I usually stay somewhere in Mosque St or Pagoda St, there are lots of hostel to choose from. I also like to go restaurant hopping and sometime I would walk a bit to Maxwell Food Court for my favorite Hainan Chicken Rice. I think Chinatown offers the best ratio of affordability and accessibility in Singapore, perfect place for any kind of travelers."

,,Sanitised Singaporean Chinatown!,5.0,,"Singapore does not encourage or allow wildness- so it is a rather sedate, yet colourful Chinatown. Though predictable, it has a few quirky stores, eating places and VERY colourful, made for Canon/ Nikon/ Fuji windows! It has a Buddha tooth relic temple at one end, three bustling streets, a Hindu temple, dodgy massage parlours (!) and a lovely local hawker centre based beer joint at the neighbouring Chinatown Complex. It's called ON TAP... they brew their OWN!!! It's brilliant.
Other places where there are varieties of imported beers are Smith Street Tap and Good Beer Company but nothing beats the local brewed Gem!"
,,Nice foods and cheap shopping,5.0,,"China town is where I like to walk,to shop and to eat.
Walk around the place and youll see it,an outdoor restaurants and bars is good for me specially if you like to sit outdoor. Looking for people passing by you and thinking what they have been thinking lol. Anyway,if you like cheap souvenirs from Singapore China town is best."

We visited one of their temples which was stunning, very lovely to see the monks pray in such a well maintained building. Highly recommended for all travelling to Singapore."
,,Sight-seeing and shopping,4.0,,"This is one of the attractions a visitor should not miss in Singapore. The streets are lined with shops selling clothing, souvenir, food, drinks(including alcoholic), gadgets and many more. Some items may not be of high quality but at their prices, it is value for money. The experience of walking through the area is satisfying and worthwhile because of its uniqueness."
,,Poor,2.0,,"Very crowded, obviously smells like food, cheap in general. Nice only for the lights on the streets. Food is quite cheap on the food street but not good."
,,Colourful and full of character,4.0,,"I really enjoyed my visit to Chinatown during a recent trip to Singapore. It was beautifully lit up in the evening by hundreds of lights and lanterns making it very ambient. I just love strolling around the lane ways checking out all the goods and food on offer. Yeah, I know most of it is just mass produced junk but somehow when you're there it's hard not to get caught up in the atmosphere. It must have something to do with being Asian."
,,Vibrant,5.0,,"Like most Chinatowns around the world this is a busy and vibrant place, filled with souvenir shops and restaurants. But once passed the usual attractions take time to visit the surrounding Temples."
,,A night in Chinatown,4.0,,"It was a fun evening visiting Chinatown. SO many stalls packed tight with all kinds of merchandise, from clothing to food to quirky oddments. Stallholders not at all pushy, stepping back with a smile when one declined interest.
Our trishaw ride was a delight, a lovely balmy evening amongst all the Singapore traffic.
Trishaws have right of way, which amazed us, our cyclist proudly told us Singapore looks after their tourists! He worked during the day as well so as to educate his 3 children, Only 2% unemployment in Singapore. Our evening finished in a bumboat on the marina enjoying the city lights, old and new buildings and places of interest.
Singapore has expanded amazingly, now they intend building another airport terminal and reclaiming more land for further expansion! At present population is 5.2million.
Also one of the wealthiest countries in the World."

To me a stroll through this area is much more enjoyable than any stroll or visit to the many shopping malls."
,,Night market and Hawker stalls are a must.,5.0,,"Lively and colorful, the place comes alive at night. The best of an Asian city that never sleeps.
Great food stalls open up on Smith street at night. Also, options like Maxwell Street food centre, and Chinatown food centre (largest selection of hawkers, but its hot in there). Souvenir stalls for the affordable perfect gift to bring home."
,,Alive with positivity,5.0,,"This is a great area to visit whilst in Singapore. It has such a wonderful atmosphere with wonderful markets and food stalls, cafés and restaurants - so alive.

One activity I would highly recommend doing whilst there is going to the Tea Chapter to learn about tea and the social meanings for Asia."
,,Lovely Chinatown!,4.0,,"I've been to various Chinatowns in various cities, but I really enjoyed the one in Singapore.

,,Buy souvenirs here!,5.0,,"We went here to buy souvenirs and it was really very affordable (mostly 10sgd bundles). Make sure you wear light clothing because it's hot and comfortable shoes so you can walk around longer. It's best to compare prices before buying because some stores offer the same stuff at a higher cost. When you get hungry from shopping, you can easily find a food store/stall. We went to the market area and dined upstairs (take the elevator) because they have lots more food stalls and they're way cheaper."

At night we enjoyed the food stalls, some of the local specialties were really enjoyable.
Chinatown is extremely safe but like every international city protect your valuables.
We bought trinkets, cloths & gifts & had a ball.
Food wise we tried so many different foods form the Coconut drink to fried Oysters, duck to seafood.
The fruit & drink stalls are wonderful created from so many different fruits.

But you can shop for good quality chopsticks, calligraphy pens etc. There are at least 3 bylanes which are of interest. Don't expect to bargain much . After all this is Singapore.
Interesting food if you are adventorous. Multiple entry and exit points so quite convenient to find. Can get quite crowded and hot."
,,Chinatown in Singapore...so and so,3.0,,"It's ""Chinatown"", and you will get what you expect from it. As in other cities where there is a Chinatown, this one does not reserve any special surprise.

,,Well worth the visit,4.0,,"Singapore is simply a country of countries, and by that I mean there are so many cultures crammed into one tiny little country. Chinatown speaks for itself, it's basically little China within Singapore filed with all that you'd expect to find in China. The markets, the people, the food, the temples, and the games of Mahjong scattering the streets make this place a must go if you're visiting Singapore. It even comes with it's own MRT station. Visit by day or by night, both offer an spectacular experience!"
,,"crowded, cheap souveniar market",4.0,,"It was a good place to buy souvenirs and clothes. Very crowded. Well stuffed with merchandise. One can bargain to some extent.

,,The more local side of Chinatown.....People's Park Complex,4.0,,"As locals, we usually frequent the People's Park side of Chinatown more than the restored shophouses towards pagoda street and the buddha tooth relic temple.
OG department store will give you a more comfortable air conditioned environment to shop in.

The People's Park Complex hawker center has the best authentic, cheap and delicious local food/beer. Check out the original Koo Kee Yong Tau Foo stall, Cantonese Roast Meats, Sugar cane juice and tropical fruits. Its very local but not air conditioned.

However, if you are not into huge crowds please avoid the area during Chinese New Year period."

Theres many second hand shop which sells crystals, handicrafts, feng shui decorations, Chinese porcelain and weird inventions from China. Popular with locals and tourists. There's nice dessert shops. Down side is hard to find public toilet. only the McDonalds near mrt exit, pearl's center nearby. Pearl's center you can find many tour agencies and currency exchange and departmental store from China selling really strange but interesting stuffs. yue hua is quite a comprehensive store and it's short walking distance from mrt exit to Chinatown point. Avoid coming during Chinese New year as shops are closed and two weeks before Chinese New year there's bazaar selling dried food and festive goodies but its super super crowded and prices are high."
,,busy but fun,4.0,,"we enjoyed walking through this area, doing a little gift shopping and eating here on our most recent visit. Definately worth a visit. Be prepared to get a little overwhelmed as one shop blends with another. It is worth comparing prices as even though most are the same there are some places that offer a cheaper price. The large complexes such as the people's park centre are also worth a look and give you an air conditioned break."
,,A must for souvenirs,4.0,,"For tourists looking for Singapore branded gifts, Chinatown is a must stop when visiting Singapore. Items starting at S$2 like keyrings, lighters and much more. Pagoda road the ideal place with restaurant offering traditional food."

,,"Ox Cart Water - vibrant, fun and very Singapore",4.0,,"The official name of Chinatown in Singapore is ""Ox Cart Water."" A name that you'll see plastered everywhere, including the hakka stalls. I had some tourists from New Zealand hilariously ask me what ""ox cart water dumplings"" tasted like, since that's what the menu read. I assured them there was no ox cart water in the dish :D

Given the prevalence of Chinese in Singapore, a lot of focus is placed on this enclave by the Singaporean government. The major celebrations happen in Singapore, and each year's lighting ceremony is great. 2015, being Singapore's 50th anniversary was particularly special.

The street shops serve fantastic food at a decent price, considering it's in a downtown metropolis. Stop in, get some $5 noodles and people watch. You won't be disappointed.

If you haven't been to an asian wet market, it's worth taking a peak inside. You'll find plenty of absurdly cheap souvenirs as well!"

,,"A must see attraction - Souveniers, Food and Tailors",5.0,,"We took the MRT from ION Orchard where everything was pricy and visited China Town. I wasn’t sure what to expect, though once there I was pleasantly surprised. It reminded me a lot of China Town in San Francisco, with the shops and good restaurants.

We ended up going there 3 times for souvenirs, the price is right and the products are the same that you will find all over Singapore.

A word to the wise, work your way into the market, the further you go, the less expensive the item."
,,So many to see,5.0,,"This is yet again another not to be missed part of Singapore. My advise before you go do your homework work out what you would like to do at what part of the day and approx cost. Also include local transport ie bus taxi or boat and then you can ddcided against what you can afford to make the most of your stay.
We visited Chinatown at night. What a spectacular event this was. With lots of many nationalities out in the evening you van get lost in the many different languages. Local dress and fayre ensure you are never lost for something to see ensures yoyr time is filled with various sights all of the time. While there try local cuisine where you can order from a varied menu at most places at a fraction of the cost. Eating this way is an eye opener as fine China is not used but the food is so tasty and authentic and you get to watch it being cooked while you wait. Once again fine tableware isn't used it's pull up a chair at a clean table but all of that is it really necessary when the food tastes so good.
Would I recommend as one to visit yes I would. Would I go back yes I would."
,,The life and atmosphere here is great. Do take some tissues or wipes with you!! Some of this food is great and spicy!,5.0,,"LOVE Chinatown, it has the best food hawkers, stalls and shops on offer, sit and people watch!

,,Do yourself a favour and spend a few hours - but make sure you have an appetite.,4.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore was a recommended destination whilst visiting the City for a few days.
The place is easily accessible using the inexpensive (by Australian standard) taxis from the CBD area. Lovely interesting place to explore for a few hours with lots of shops/stalls etc and interesting people locals/visitors to entice the tourist. (ie. tourist trap). The big winner is the food both restaurant and street options. We ate at an A/cond restaurant and all had great food - so impressed we ended up returning the following night and opted for a more open street style restaurant - again we were on a winner. Sampled a Chinese Carrot Cake - not what you might expect and well worth trying, had some great chili prawns and pork rib dishes.
Great place to visit - felt very safe and food excellent - highly recommended.
(you can find cheaper food options in or around the place)."

,,Waste of time,3.0,,If you visiting Singapore for few days then there is no fun going to Chinatown market. It's all cheep stuff and shopkeepers are dry.
,,Worth a visit to Chinatown,5.0,,"I was quite surprised by China Town. It was so easy to get to it as the train system in Singapore is excellent. Good food, organized and some good shopping. Some shops set price but others very happy to bargain with you. Great for last minute gifts and the quality of clothing pretty good."
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"As a tourist, Chinatown is certainly worth a visit: it's large, has some great restaurants and shops including local street cuisine and and some unusual landmarks. Sadly it also has all the tat selling stalls and tourist shops like glow in the dark plastic toys and even Tin Tint shop (!), which makes it a bit sad. But this is also a functional place with many places of businesses, and is a useful cut through for other areas too."
,,"Cheap Souvenirs, Delicious Food",4.0,,"What else would you want? If you are tired of paying through your nose for everything, head over to China town for a breather. Here you get more reasonable shopping and dining options.

A Hindu temple stands at one end of Chinatown and a Buddhist temple at the other end. In between, the streets are lined with souvenir shops selling ancient Chinese medicines, modern electronics and everything in between. One of the streets is lined with restaurants and is commonly known as the Food Street. Here you can get several cuisines at a reasonable price.

Definitely worth a visit in Singapore."
,,Hunger saver!!!,5.0,,I stayed in Chinatown area and went to have meals at the Chinatown food center every day. I loved that it was so busy everyday haha. There were a lot of the souvenir shops and restaurants. The area was safe when I was there as I walked from the MRT station back to my hostel at midnight and there were still some places open with the customers inside and outside and that made the area safe.
,,Chinese merchandise and food,4.0,,Great for ambling around and getting a few cheap souvenirs. Also a good place to get a cold beer at a more reasonable price and watch the world go by. The nearby temple is worth a visit too.
,,"Great atmosphere, cheap souvenirs, good & cheap local food too...",4.0,,"Chinatown is the probably the biggest & cheapest place here to shop for a huge range of authentic & nice souvenirs. Walk through the street markets & soak in the 'festive' atmosphere. Many shops sell similar items; so shop around before buying.

As Chinatown is a big place, you need few hours to fully explore the place, including eating.

For cheap, authentic & good ""Local"" food; go to the huge food centre at Smith Street - on the 2nd floor of Chinatown Complex. Prices & menu are usually stated on the stalls; so no problem to order.

Just for the experience, go to the Wet Market at the basement floor of same complex. Besides usual market items, you will find interesting tropical fruits & vegetables- at cheap prices!

There is a nice modern mall Chinatown Point, as well. Here you find shops usually found in such malls; & toilets here are cleaner & nicer as well ( found on every floor ).

The many exits at Chinatown MRT station leads to various parts of this place. To go directly to the streets markets, look for exit to Pagoda Street ( think it is Exit B). The escalator brings us right into the heart of the street markets.

Come in late evening or at night so that it is much cooler but some stalls close at around 9pm; so don't come too late.

It is very safe in Singapore - even late at night. Whether it is the streets, MRT, buses, food centre , shopping malls, etc- you can walk with full safety confidence.

Currently it is Mid Autumn Festival - so you can see interesting decorations depicting this festival on the road ( see photos)."

Great to do at night, although we noticed some of the stalls packing up near 9pm. Seemed very safe area to be in at night.

The stalls tend to sell a variety of goods, and if you see something in one shop, you'll likely see it in another few shops.

Highly recommended for a couple of hours."

People are bartering through the market where you can buy impossibly cheap stuff and souvenirs (most shops have the same stuff so keep it moving if you think it's pricey). It's a great vibe.

Further more, there is a street to buy souvenir too."
,,Great little shopping and foodcourts.,4.0,,This was one of the first places we visited on our trip to Singapore and were pleased with the authentic mix of food and shopping opportunities simular to night markets in other Asian countries. You could pretty much find any type of food you were looking for here and it was fast and hot. Definitely recommend a visit for dinner time and people watching.
,,Some nice old buildings,4.0,,We did a nice walk around Chinatown. There are some beautiful old buildings of architectural interest. There are a range of shops and a good choice of restaurants.
,,Great place to explore local culture and cuisine,4.0,,"We walked to Chinatown from where we were staying (at the Amara hotel). It was a lovely 15-20min stroll there (depending on how many times you stop to take photos), as you get to walk past numerous buildings/beautiful arhitecture, shops, resturants, bars and other interesting sights. The maxwell hawker centre is on the way to chinatown too.
Once there there are so many streets and shops to explore. So I would recommend at least 5-6 hours here. As you will want to fit in lunch and dinner here as so many resturants to choose from! Definitely worth coming to explore."
,,Colourful evening adventure,3.0,,Chinatown is full of colour and interesting people. Some of the shop keepers are persistent though - and if you want to browse by yourself be prepared to have someone shadow you and make suggestions on what to purchase. You can haggle though... and that's a lot of fun - because its a safe shopping environment.
,,Nothing special,3.0,,It was nice and charming but nothing special. It was just another Chinatown in the row but once you are in Singapore why not to come here.
,,Con men,2.0,,"Very good food experience lot of variety and good prices on beers, can buy souvenir for a good price and feel a little bit of china here. Be wary of the shops, do you home work before you buy. Purchased a camera lens and was conned by the shop keepers. Feel cheated. all this left a bad taste for the holiday. just stick to eat and drinks here. Don't buy any thing even from a store. They keep fakes and charge a lot of money and give improper invoices."
,,Lovely place to visit,4.0,,"Hugh on our list of places to visit. Chinatown had temples, shopping and more importantly great food and drink. In the heart of it was one of the best restaurants in the city with probably the cheapest beer as well 6.95 for a pint bottle of freezing cold tiger beer. What a place to sit and watch the world go by and then indulge in a bit of trinket shopping."
,,Best place in Singapore,5.0,,"Just such a beautiful area of Singapore, we stayed in china town and they have so much on offer here, we took a walk around and it was just so peaceful in the day.. away from the hustle and bustle of other areas in Singapore.
The markets at night are so amazing too! really different stuff.. Like a lizard fan..(yes a real lizard).
Cant wait to come back again"
,,China Town,4.0,,"An interesting busy part of Singapore to visit, lots of shops selling the same goods cheap clothes and electrical items. If you look carefully you can find some interesting ceramics."

,,Best food in town!,5.0,,China town is famous for awesome authentic Chinese food and shopping. There are lot of good restaurants and also good street food for authentic food. Don't miss the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum.
,,A Must Tour,4.0,,My wife and I did the Night out in Chinatown tour whilst in Singapore. What a great tour. We started off by hearing about the history of Chinatown and then we walked through to look and buy at the stalls. We then went to a Chinese Restaurant above one of the shops for dinner. The food and service was great. We then went on a trishaw ride through Chinatown to Robertson Quay . This was awesome! Next we went on a bumboat down the river. A very well organised and fun tour for all ages.
,,Colourful and vibrant destination,4.0,,"Full of cheap tourist stalls, it is great if you are looking for some souvenirs to take home, otherwise, enjoy the colour and vibrant atmosphere. An easy walk from Clarke Quay. Explore the side streets, look for some interesting out of the way eateries, generally where the locals seem ot congregate, they don't always look 5 star but hey, you are in Asia, go with it as it is a great experience."
,,Chinatown Trishaw Night Tour - Virator,5.0,,The Chinatown Trishaw Night Tour would have to be the best tour I have ever done! No only is it good value for money it is a great orientation of this marvellous city. It starts with a surprise so I won't ruin that. Then it's off to the restaurant for a great feed. Time for some souvenir shopping in the markets before the Trishaw ride. I was obviously so excited about this tour I didn't read the whole itinerary. Just when I thought the tour was over there was a river tour which went into the bay. I highly recommend this tour.
,,Wrong name,2.0,,"I suppose my expectations were set on seeing and experiencing more Chinese than gift stores. Less is sometimes more that is the number of shops selling the same things must make it difficult to sell or make a living.

Very stuffy need to find a way to move the air

Clean and tidy

Would visit again

Paul"

Since we were getting hungry. We spotted a food court. It was dirty too, but we don't mind. Ha ha! We weren't sure if the food we ate was clean, but it was good not great. We didn't have stomach flu so the food were clean I guess. ✌"
,,put this spot in your bucket list when in Singapore!,5.0,,"what an impressive place to showcase Chinatown Singapore in such a colourful way. the food court with a wide selection of especially Chinese,and other local cuisine at very competitive prices is a must for our taste buds. we noted there is even an escalator in the Smith Street hawker centre. we had a go for durians too that tasted heavenly!"
,,Spent a nice time wondering around,4.0,,"We did not need to buy any souvenirs so we enjoyed walking around, briefly looked at what was offered by vendors, sampled some food and fresh fruits, and really enjoyed our time there. It is so easy to reach China town by MTR! We spend a couple hours there at the evening, when it was not too hot."
,,Little China,4.0,,Cultural gold mine if you look past the stalls selling all touristy trinkets. Speak to the Chinese about their cultural artefacts on display. We enjoyed the interaction with the people.
,,Loveed it so much went back 3 times and many hours and meals,5.0,,"Oh what a joy. They have also a food street in the middle of the market so cheap and fabulous food. The markets themselves very reasonable and all in the vicinity of a three lane block. Also great inside markets must see, just explore."

We like the many stalls with their bright colored displays - great place to shop for souvenirs. It has a little of everything. You can get some great buys in photo equipment, also. This is an endless place to take some great photographs, different architecture and some local color.
There are lots and lots great eating places to take a rest between shopping. A 2-3 hour time span is enough to see most of the places. If you think you missed out on somethings, you can always come back the next day!"

Authentic Asian dining.
Felt very safe throughout the 2 hours I spent walking around and shopping.
Was also impressed that some of the vendors actually accepted credit cards and mostly all gave receipts so us foreigners can claim our GST back!"
,,Husbands can sit and have a beer while wives browse,4.0,,It's China with a touch of India; the markets reminded me of the Muslim markets in Xian. The stalls seem to go forever but there is not need to visit all of them because the goods repeat. The prices are very good - comparable to China and its a great place to gather trinkets to take home as gifts.
,,Chinatown tour,5.0,,This tour is excellent the tour guide is good the shopping is awesome and the meal at the restaurant is average but the highlight of the tour has to be both the river cruise at night and the rickshaw ride both through china towns alleys and on the 8 lane main road both awesome and exciting
,,rice and noodles,5.0,,You are in China when you enter Chinatown. The whole atmosphere is wonderful. We were lucky enough to see the lion dance which happens every evening at 18-45 through the streets of Chinatown. Loved it.
,,Chinatown wonderful by day and by night.,5.0,,"We walked to Chinatown from Tangjong Puggar most nights of our stay to eat dinner and shop. Chinatown shopping markets are huge. We bought electronics, jewellery, gifts and clothes. We saw the locals dancing in a community square near the tooth relic temple and elderly people playing checkers and majong at one end and found the station at the other end. The markets open about ten am and close about ten pm or later. Some shops close in the evening especially after eight pm. This is yet another place of so many to enjoy in wonderful Singapore. Singapore has something for everyone to enjoy."
,,Very touristy,3.0,,"Since Singapore's population is made up of almost 75 % Chinese, everywhere you go feels like Chinatown. I found it very touristy, food in those typical tourist restaurants is overpriced and not even good."
,,A must in Singapore!,4.0,,"Great night or day out, lots to see and plenty of food options (of course all Asian cuisine!)
Make sure you check out the stores that sell handmade fans and chopsticks, they make great presents. Also there is a cute couple that also run an art studio at the back of their shop and the older gentleman does caricatures for a reasonable price!"
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,This place is excellent. You walk out of the MRT and your in the middle of a massive Chinese hawker centre with 10s of restaurants and stalls cooking fresh Chinese food and serving cheap beer. It's s great experience although very hot and sweaty! Must try when in Singapore
,,Buy all entry tickets here at peoples park,5.0,,"Do all your shopping here. Specially for souvenirs. much much much cheaper than at the parks. word of advise: buy all your entry passes to whatever you want to do in singapore like waterworld, Universal studios, zoo here at peoples park. Its less than half what you end up paying at the ticketing counter"
,,The colourful side of Singapore,3.0,,"Just amazing. Laneways, small shops, the markets, the people watching, the colour and the noise all comes together to make a great visit."
,,Go Crazy in Chinatown!,5.0,,Great area for shopping. OG Shopping Centre is great but so are the street markets Tip: don't just eat at the usual tourist restaurants ... venture further in to where the locals go and I promise you won't be disappointed!
,,Very impressive and almost a sensory overload..,5.0,,"I've ticked off a few Chinatown's now and this one would have to be one of the most memorable..

We were one MRT stop away from Chinatown so getting there from Clarke Quay was easy and convenient. From an MRT perspective, we took exit A and as soon as you hit ground level Chinatown smacks you in the face in a very pleasant way.

It is a visual feast and I only wish I'd taken photo's exiting the MRT. With 2 kids, crowds and more distractions than you can poke a stick at, photo's had to take a back seat.

Highlights are the plethora of outlets, souvenirs, trinkets and it is an enjoyable experience just to wander and soak up the atmosphere. Our visits were always at night, so perhaps heightened by the time of day..

From Exit A however the world is your oyster and we quickly manage to navigate and find foodie heaven in Smith St. My favourite.. the satay's. I could have lived on them alone for the week or so we were in Singapore. They are a must do if you're in the area.

Worth at least a couple of visits.. One to just soak it all up and wander round and enjoy the ambience.. the other do some shopping and enjoy the food."
,,Worth a visit...just,3.0,,"If you're after a cheap Singapore t shirt or souvenir then this is the place for you but proper Chinatown feel? Nimo. Yes a few decent places to eat and drink but almost solely for tourists. Bearing in mind, Singapore is a predominantly Chinese Republic, everywhere is like Chinatown ( not forgetting the Malay and Indian areas ) . But if you want to pass an hour or two wandering through here, it's safe and you could do a lot worse."
,,A place to buy inexpensive gift or present for your friend,5.0,,"Don't miss this place. If you want to buy inexpensive gift for your friend back home. Choose this place, a lot if choices to buy such as key chain, Singapore shirts, bracelets, etc. They also have food court where you can eat and very affordable."
,,Place for cheap food,3.0,,It is a place to find cheap food. The place is quite crowded and dirty. Toilets in the chinatown complex building is charged. Beware.
,,Souvenir And food paradise,5.0,,"Great area for foodies and bargain shoppers. Wide range of souvenirs, much cheaper than the shops and you can haggle. Street full of restaurants at very competitive prices and quite a bit cheaper than Clarke Quay and Marina Bay areas."
,,Chinatown - never ceases to amaze you.,4.0,,"Great value, great variety. Heaps of shops for those who want to get some trinkets for the folks back home. Quiet a few novelties."
,,Great destination,4.0,,"We stayed close by so Chinatown is the easiest destination for us either by foot or less than $5 by cab. We bought all our souvenirs from the markets, visited some cultural areas and ate at Smith St a few times. Well worth visiting for a few hours, quite a few tailors here so expect, the 'hey boss, you want suit?'"
,,Good location,4.0,,"We stayed hotel 4 days at Chinatown. It's good location for hotel, street food, Souvenir shop, MTR train, Hindo temple, buddism temple, Church and Chineses restaurant. Dim sum should be taste firstly and follow with Chicken rice."
,,"China Town, Singapore",4.0,,"Loved it! I love places like this. All the hustle and bustle, loads of little shops & market stalls, noise, smells and lovely Chinese food. It was hot and quite crowded but who cares, it was fun."
,,Come at night for the full experience,4.0,,"We often hit a Chinatown in the cities we travel to as they are often fun with good cheap food. This one of the best. Restaurants are full and shopping is everywhere this is a great place to be at night. This is just a fun area. Give it a look if you want good, cheap food and trinkets. MRT is also directly below it so getting in and out is easy and cheap too."
,,Delicious Chinese Food!,5.0,,"I spent an evening here as well as an full afternoon. In the evening I ate dinner from the food stalls on the ""food street."" It was absolutely delicious and very inexpensive. The next day I came back for a trip to the Fish Spa and fabric shopping. I found several wonderful fabric vendors in the complex above the food hawker pavilion. They're on the second floor. Some great finds!"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,First visited Chinatown in 1990. It has changed a lot since then but still worth a visit while in Singapore. So much to see here. Spend a few hours just walking around and take in all the sights and smells.
,,Worth for dine & shopping,4.0,,"Seems ok for family to have a walk there, there is a restaurant with seafood menu, the black pepper crab & vegetable are so good, we were there for dinner on 2 consecutive nights, & price was reasonable, quite lots of guest, need wait if you there for dinner at 1800 to 1900.....sorry not remember the name, the shop with outdoor dining area, all chairs are yellow color....quite lots of souveniour shops which can have a walk after your full dinner."
,,Enjoy the Chinese culture,3.0,,"Singapore's Chinatown is an ethnic neighbourhood featuring distinctly Chinese cultural elements and a historically concentrated ethnic Chinese population. Chinatown is located within the larger district of Outram. One of tourism area for tourists. But recently years, more and more people from china travel here to set business or shop assistant from china. Sometimes I was wondering whether I am landed in China or at Chinatown in Singapore. Too polluted with China native and sometimes they speak very loud.... Some can be unrefined, uncouth in action when they speak."
,,Great fun!,4.0,,Lovely to have a poke around and pick up some trinkets for souvenirs. There is a hindu temple there as well as Buddhist temple so v interesting to see the mix. It's the seventh month where the ghosts roam the earth so we were very fortunate to be able to witness monks chanting for atonement of the souls of the dead( I think!). Very interesting and colourful.
,,Cheap and trendy!,4.0,,A great place for shopping and eating nice local food. One just has to be careful as this is a place you should check 10 shops before buying to make sure you get the right price.
,,Fun times bartering in a 'safe' Chinatown,5.0,,"Unfortunately we did not get as much time in Chinatown as would have liked, but there are certainly great bargains, in a clean, safe environment and you can still barter on prices. to me as a tourist who has visited many other parts of Asia I certainly felt safe here, but able to enjoy the opportunity to barter down prices. I wish I'd had more time here to shop, as well as enjoy the history of the area."
,,Don't miss the temple.,4.0,,"Only genuine place in singapore that does need feel totslly sanitzed.mit is very clean and does not hav ethe feel of chinatowns elsewhere. However, big neough and manay things to buy can be found. Dont miss the shops that are in the street but behind the sidewalks. This is where most interesting stuff that not plastiky can be found. The buddha relic tooth temple is superb and worth any detour."
,,Original district,4.0,,"An area full of shops, boutiques and souvenirs merchants.
Very busy most of the day, and you really feel you are in a particular place, with a special atmosphere around.
Consider Chinatown as a real curiosity to discover in Singapore if you have a couple of hours to spend hanging around."
,,Specific,5.0,,"Like every China Towns on the wirld in this one has a specific atmosphere with many street shops,very intersting places to see,to eat etc!"
,,Bargains galore!,4.0,,"When the rest of singapore is so very expensive why wouldn't you pay Chinatown a visit! So many greats souvenir items, and a wonderful array of food. Can be a bit intense with many vendors on the SELL SELL SELL but it's worth it, lots of nice things here at great prices."
,,Nothing to say,2.0,,Hard to interactions with the peoples there. Fancy chinese shop and i don't really understand to asked price or whats the food who i can bought.
,,I like this place,5.0,,"Good for shopping, try the food there very tasty, Amazing streets for walk and great place to buy your souvenirs"
,,Old world Singapore,5.0,,"Stayed almost in Chinatown and spent many hours exploring this unique and interesting place. Be prepared to have people try and sell you things like clothing or getting clothes made, they seemed to think that I needed a suit very time I passed a tailor but that's the charm of this area, Food was good cheap and tasty."
,,Cheap souvenirs,4.0,,Lots of hustle and bustle with hundreds of stalls and hundreds of people. Stalls get a bit repetitive after a while - same souvenirs and same price - $4 each or 3 for $10. There are good eating places amongst the stalls.
,,old and new world charm,4.0,,"inthe earliiest days chinatown was rather rough,and grubby..it was one of the first well known sections you wiuld head for in singaore along with arab st it has not lost its initial characters, but is a much safer cleaner chinatown. it is a place you must visit to get the feel of real singapore.it is colourful exciting and has a great source of real chinese food,it has a feeling quite different than singapore at orchard rd or marina bay."
,,Singapore in square mile.,4.0,,"Lots to see, shop and browse and food in the food courts and also in restaurants and bars all around."
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,"We visited in the day, I am sure it is lovely at night. The temples and alleyways of shops create an exciting and busy atmosphere. Find Pagoda Road and go from there."
,,Nice,4.0,,Nice place for shopping.... :-) especially lucky charms.... :-). Variety of food available and nice place to hangout.
,,VERY badly organised pick up spoilt our experience,2.0,,"We had such a bad experience with a particular company who have a China Town by night and Bumboat tour. Firstly, they ask for you to confirm by phone call to say where you will be picked up. I had also told them twice before we left Australia that we had changed venues.
Waited and waited, only to recieve a text to say that we were a 'No show' at the original hotel so left without us.
After many texts and phone calls and repeating at least 5 times what hotel we were in, we were offered an alternative night for the tour. We were told to wait at the hotel entrance. We informed the concierge that we would be sitting down and he assured me that the tour bus would come to them and that they would let us know. We were about 10 metres form the entrance.
At the proposed time...they did not arrive and we thought ""here we go again""!
Next thing, we were told that our pick up was here. Low and behold....an extremely rude and aggitated man, waving his finger at me and his book as well...in my face shouting NO SHOW! NO SHOW! He said that he had been to our room which is impossible as you need security to get to our room. He kept yelling at me and I was soooo upset I felt like cancelling the trip. My husband is blind and he was extremely upset.
I complained to the tour operator about this incident and I have had NO reply.
Other than that, the tour was ok.....except for the poor old trishaw driver struggling to drive us and nearly getting us killed by the traffic.
The meal was average. There was not enough time to shop. The bumboat tour was the highlite."
,,Go crazy shopping,4.0,,"This is such a pretty place! Shops and food stalls and temples and Chinese decorations! Made for some pretty pictures 😄 Great place to pick up souvenirs, sample some local cuisine and just simply walk around looking at everything. Take an evening out for this."
,,getting rid of facial hair by threading,5.0,,"I went to Chinatown to look for food. On the way I was then stopped by a young Chinese lady who asked me whether i wanted to have my eye brows shaped as well as having my facial hair removed for S$10.00. I agreed because it was a good bargain. In Montreal I would have to pay C$40. Chinatown is an interesting place as one can find good food, massages, clothes, antiques, etc. Once upon a time there was a lane that was named ""bullock-cart street"" because bullock-carts were used for transport. Men used to smoke opium in tightly packed apartments."
,,My child hood play ground,4.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore are merely made up of several streets, from Hong Lim Street to Cantonment Road.
Within these streets you can find footage of heritage Chinese short houses where our older generation populated during our early 40s -60s, older shops can still be found in some of this place.
The limelight here are the local breakfast at the new Chinatown building that can starts as early as 6 in the morning, come experience what we eat for breakfast before we start off for the day ahead.
Another highlight here is the local Cantonese pastry that is handmade totally, grab some for souvenir here back home and assure you will be welcome immediately. Haha..."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,I visited it in August 2015 during my 3-day stay in Singapore. Nice neighborhood to visit if you would like to have a better feel about local culture. It has a lot of shops and also a food court with local dishes.
,,Not as good as Chinatown KL,3.0,,A little disappointing compared to Chinatown KL. No cheap jerseys or anything like that. Good electrical stores. Only been there during daylight. Probably more exciting at night.
,,Entered the Dragon,5.0,,"Chinatown Singapore is well worth a visit. It's fun, loads of places to eat and interesting but make sure you take cash with you. On our visit we came across what I can only call a Chinse Curiosty Shop. It was packed with loads of repro antiques and possibly a few real ones. The owner left us alone until we became interested in an ordinal metal dragon, you know the ugly ones used in dance on the pretty ones like Puff!we asked how much it was but the price was Fargo high. The owner asked me for a price but I did not wish to insult him. He said the dragon was already mine ...... He accepted a 100 dollars less and we went to the counter to pay. Whilst wrapping the dragon he asked if he could read me. The explained that when I entered the shop my presents was strong and I had the gift of inturision . Now I am not one to poopoo things we do not fully understand but I am not silly! For fun and Curiostity we gave him the dollar he requested. Well he became me........ In know or could feel how I think. How I why up things, the way I judge people quickly and am normally right. The way I know if an outcome will be good or bad. He said I was to be more positive, we have one life. He told me my strong inturision came from the fact I leave my body at night to travel and that I was once a monk or another spiritual being... What a load of bull I hear you say but we were there domes 40 mins in which the owner was ignoring other customers. Just asking them to wait or leave the money. The thing is, I was in Sri Lanka 14 years ago when a monk grabbed me by the chin with rough hands in a temple. He said things along the same lines to me........ Including some personal things that actually happened some five years ago. Makes you wonder does it not!"
,,Very touristy spot,4.0,,"Chinatown is located on the Singapore MRT purple line, chinatown exit.
Once you get to the MRT station, there are 4 main exits. Most tourist end up at the pagoda street. Many restored old chinatown shop houses.
The other 3 exits end up in shopping centers. People's park complex, people park center and chinatown point.
Being a shopping center, it has a bit of everything. There are lots of money changers in the shopping center area. They are all nearby and the rates do vary slightly between the money changers."
,,Another cultural area,4.0,,Every year we go there for eating adn shopping- Children are quite fond of the area and also the ladies
,,"A variety of tasty food, cheap souvenirs and budget hotels.",4.0,,"I personally love wandering around Chinatown, or just sitting eating/drinking by the roadside and watching the world walk by. But during the month leading up to Chinese New Year, Chinatown is an absolute must visit. Pagoda St for souvenirs and Smith St for food are my recommendations."
,,A little bit of China,5.0,,"If you are staying a couple of days in Singapore then this is certainly a place to check out. Okay, there are a few places of interest in Singapore, but this is definitely one of them, and the best part about it is that it is still very authentically Chinese. You have the Buddha Tooth Museum, the street markets (which spill out onto multiple streets) and of course more authentic Chinese Restaurants than you know what to do with. You will even find the old me sitting under some shelter playing Chinese board games, which are always cool to watch. If you go to Singapore and don't come here then you have seriously missed out. Oh, and it is also really easy to get to with an MRT station right at its heart."
,,Busy but very organised!,4.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore very much reflects the rest of Singapore, it is busy, fun but very organised and sanitised. Lots of stalls in the street markets, plenty of places to eat. I really enjoyed visiting the Hindu Temple, lit up in the evening it was beautiful."
,,Nice for the Chinese products,4.0,,Location is famous for the various shops that's exclusively selling Chinese products. Prices are reasonable and have wide varieties of products.
,,Well organised chaos,4.0,,"As compared to Bangkok's chinatown, the one in Singapore is cleaner and more well organised.

Here,you will find a melting pot of cultures from chinese eateries (run by china nationals) to western bars to a indian temple and even a malay mosque.

For chinese food,i highly recommend Ri Ri Hong Mala Xiang Guo (日日红麻辣香锅) at people park's complex hawker centre. You pick and choose your ingredients before giving it to the stall owner who will stir fry it for you with chili oil. You can choose from a few spiciness level ranging from no spicy to mild,medium or strong.

Head down to Smith street where you can find souvenirs like oriental fans, luggage tags,scarf. Some shops even sell their items for 3 for $10. Chill out at the open area just outside Buddha Tooth relic as you watch elderly men racking their brains and pitting each other in a game of chinese chess.

Chinatown is never boring. And here in every nook and corner, you will find something that will ignite your curiosity and excite your 5 senses. All in this organised place of chaos."
,,Commercial rather than authentic,3.0,,"Enjoyed the visit but found it really very very commercial. If you are looking for a traditional experience this is not for you.

I did however stock up on baggy pants and sun dresses from the stalls which were selling the same sort of selection you would find in Thailand.

,,Colour Galore in Chinatown,5.0,,"As you exit the MRT station, you are greeted by colour. Colour from the lanterns above, colour from the wares on display, and colour from the buildings. The area is alive & vibrant. It is a great place for souvenir shopping, & while stores and stalls have items priced, you can still barter! There are restaurants & street stalls to meet all food needs & budgets. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is well worth a visit. Women be aware that you will need to have your legs covered if you visit this temple."

,,Great food!,5.0,,Loved the atmosphere! So much fun to wander the alleys and try the great food especially the dumplings.... a must see in a visit to Singapore.
,,A corner of China,5.0,,Quite small compared to that of Hong Kong but still interesting. It doesn't get going until late morning so arrange to arrive just before lunch or later.
,,Nice Place for shopping and eating,3.0,,"so easy to get here, by bus or mrt..nice place to visit..i can go for shopping, buy some souvenir, and many local restaurant offer a good taste of noodle, fried rice and other chinesse food... and dont forget to try Manggo Ice Shaving at Mei Huen Yun, 3 temple street...really a good place you wont miss."
,,Cheap shopping and food,5.0,,On jalan petaling you can buy many brands of a very good quality for a very good price. Haggle hard since the first price can be 3 times higher. Good and cheap shopping. The stalls dont open before 10 or 11am.
,,Worth adding it to your schedule,5.0,,If you have any interest in shopping or eating then this is the place for you go here early evening for some dinner at the many places to eat and do a bit of late night shopping or just take a stroll down the many streets. What ever you decide to do you won't be disappointed s China town has a lot to offer to everyone.
,,Totally worth it...,5.0,,"Several sights to see in Singapore's Chinatown. Several temples, restaurantes and places to visit. Also a good spot to stay while visiting the city since it is very central with great public transports."
,,Chinatown equals shopping and eating.,4.0,,"If you are visiting Chinatown for a cultural experience, you may be hard pressed to locate it unless you visit the Buddhist and Hindu temples or inspect the traditional architecture, all of which are located on the periphery of the area. If however, you are after a shopping experience then that is going to be much easier to find.
To use a common adage ""you can shop until you drop"". Small shopfronts and numerous market stalls sell a vast array of goods including items such as clothing, posters and artwork, gifts, watches, sunglasses and souvenirs by 'the shipload"". You would be hard pressed to walk away empty handed.
If you happen to become hungry or thirsty ( I can guarantee that with Singapore's humidity you will become thirsty) then there are plenty of outlets selling food to quell your hunger and drinks to quench your thirst.
Well worth a visit to grab a bargain!"
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,"Nice place to visit, grab something to eat in one of the restaurants ( the one with the seafood was great) and to buy some souvenirs."
,,Place for Everything,5.0,,"Singapore's China Town is one of the best spot in the city. We can mostly shop, dine and experiencing. It is easy reached by MRT or buses. Try to walk through the Smith Street area and you can find lots of great street foods that you cannot miss. You can also find famous roast pork snack in the area and buy budget souvenirs."
,,Only In Singapore!,5.0,,"We've been in several China Towns all over the world and the one in Singapore is definitely one of our favorites. It is clean, well organized and you can take your time shopping without being harassed by the vendors.

We bought great silk clothing at very reasonable prices and the best part to me was that we were there at night and I never felt unsafe or threatened.

Great place to get gifts for everyone at home and don't forget yourself!"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Typical China town. Lots to see including cheap markets with jewelry, t shirts, souvenirs etc. Also some traditional chinese food to be had if you like that. Enjoyed walking around here for an hour. Easy to get to just walk out of the Chinatown MRT station."
,,Enjoy the chinese way,4.0,,"Its similar to the ones all over the world. Chinatown is a place where you will find authentic chinese food, chinese products and a place for tourists to buy lots of souvenirs back. you can consider to come over to chinatown during the chinese lunar new year with lots of lighting and decorations and its packed during thiese periods. enjoy the ""warmth"" and happy shopping!"
,,Worth the time,5.0,,"All chinatowns in the world are the same and yet different. The one here in Singapore is no exception. Prepare to have a good time eating, snapping photos and shopping if you are a tourist as its a great place to buys those souvenirs for friends and relatives back home."
,,Very crowded yet interesting,4.0,,"Chinatown is the place, you would not like to miss. You will find all the small and big shops, lots of hotel and malls as simple Singapore style. As told by the Guide, any locality in the Singapore city has the same proportion of the ethnic population similar to that of Singapore as whole. That is really interesting."
,,Explore,5.0,,"This is a must do visit in Singapore. Great shophouses, great shopping and great food. Lots to do and see, don't rush your time here, explore the side streets and character buildings."
,,Little China,4.0,,"Chinatown is the original precinct for ethnic Chinese settlers set aside by the British. The area is no longer exlusively Chinese. It is flanked by Hindu & Budhist temples and other ethnicities are alllowed to own and run businesses.

It does however retain the original 'shop front' architecture front colonial times, giving a shaded promenade around the precinct.

The markets have the usual tourist trinkets (I ❤ Singapore, Lucky Cats etc) hawker food and shops with traditional Chinese remedies.

Shops that sell shark fin and asorted dried animal parts add authenticity or ethical cringe, depending on your views on such practices.

However, Singapore is not cheap ...if you want a bargain l, this is the place for it!

I would tend to avoid eating from the street hawkers, where we saw food being stored in the Singapore heat and feral cats wandering the stalls."
,,Amazon Cameras & Electronics.....NOT TO BE TRUSTED SCAMMERS......,1.0,,"The day started by heading down to the train station near Clark Quay, to head over to Chinatown. On our way we were approached by an old man asking where we were going and offered us a $5 cab fare there instead. Being over the heat and humidity and with our son sick, we took him up on the offer as the cab was right there and air conditioned!
The driver seemed nice and friendly and talked the whole ride there. When we got there he offered to show us to where some good shops were. He took us to a jewellery store which we had no interest in so the owner offered to take us around to his electronics store.
Now I just want to point out that we have travelled before and are generally extremely cautious to scammers or anything that seems dodgy, but I don't know if it was the heat or what but our radars didn't kick in on this instance.
At the shop, Amazon Cameras & Electronics, the sales consultant, Jon Leong, came across as being extremely informative and his knowledge of the equipment seemed legit.
While I was looking at a couple of cameras I was interested in, the other half was off talking to Jon about Go Pro cameras. One thing I did notice was that there were no prices on items but didn't think anything of it.
So then I chatted to him about the cameras and told him what functions I wanted and he went and got another camera for me to check out. I had done my research at home on the first two but knew nothing about the third so had no idea what it was worth.
He took photos with it, showed the functions and let me have a go too. Seemed pretty good.
So we started to discuss prices for an action camera (not the Go Pro, a different brand) and a camera, full accessories included. He showed a price to the other half, also stating that we could claim back the GST when we left Singapore. We told him we were driving back to fly out of Kuala Lumpur and he said that we'd still be able to claim it, so that made the deal look even more attractive.
We decided on a whim to go ahead and purchase the items so while everything was being packed up and paperwork done he gave us all a drink, beer for the adults and a can of coke each for the kids. How good was this hey!
So with a final try to sell us spare batteries (which we declined) and throwing in a skippy plug (power point adaptor for Australia) we went on our merry way and enjoyed the sights of Chinatown, Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay taking happy snaps along the way with my new purchase.
That night I decided to see how good we did with our deal. Well my heart stopped when I saw the price we could've paid in Australia for our goods. I went into an immediate moment of severe regret and anxiety and woke up the other half to share the horrible news that we had been rolled big time!
We spent most the night discussing options on what to do and reading reviews of people who had experienced the same as we had by the same place! I have never felt so humiliated and stupid in all my life and what made it worse was it was in front of our children. Going back the next day and confronting them wasn't an option we were willing to take with the kids so by the time we finally fell into a restless, anxiety filled sleep we had decided to wear our own stupidity and call him the next morning to let him know that we knew he had ripped us off.
Unfortunately for us, charging well above the RRP isn't illegal so there is nothing that can be done except make others aware of these dealings that go on.
Be wary, that's all we can say. Be wary of being approached by anyone offering a taxi, be wary of ""deals"" offered and if you have the chance before hand, do your research and read reviews but most of all DO NOT SHOP AT AMAZON CAMERAS AND ELECTRONICS .... DO NOT TRUST JON LEONG!"
,,A fun place to visit,5.0,,"There is so much to see, great old buildings. I bought a bag and didn't haggle, they seemed a little astounded and immediately took me to a jeweller, where I didn't buy anything. We went there several times and loved it. Take goood shoes as you could spend a lot of time here or just browse through. The choice is yours."
,,reflection of chinese culture,4.0,,"if you like to buy sou verniers for low price this is the place. they have $10 shops where you can buy any three items for $10. less crowded. have lot of fashion stores for low prices and of course there are some expensive items too. there are small street food stalls where you can buy tradtional chinese and japanese food, fruit juices. there was a shop wich sells sugar cane juice. they put a whole sugarcane in to a grinder like thing and you can have a fresh sugar cane juice at $1.15. if you on a budget this place is ideal. food is also cheap in here."
,,WOW ! need 3 days to appreciate this place,5.0,,"We arrived around 7pm into Chinatowns MTR stop and hopped off the train straight into the bedlam that is Chinatown- While my wife had her nails redone - I went off exploring. The variety of shops in the precinct directly opposite would take all day to see- so in between browsing I stopped to have my feet ""groomed"" by the Fish Spa- an intersting experience S$8 for 15 minutes. There are so many cheap eats in the first street - from $2.50 - $5 hawker style - and further along in Pagoda Street you can find a tailor who will make you a suit and despatch it by post to your home- There are souvenir shops selling everything from keyrings vases to T shirts and silk garments and the like. The food stalls in Smith street are probably better quality if you like more general Chinese food rather than some of the stranger offerings and as you walk further along you will come across hawker style restaurants.
This place has it all - One day is not enough - Not to mention the Temples and other Chinese monuments that we all seem to miss. Maybe a walking tour would be great thing to do in the daytime .There are toilet facilities and the place is clean and safe."
,,Nice Chinatown,4.0,,"It's a nice place to walk by, the Buddha temple is nearby and it's seems the perfect spot for searching for inexpensive souvenirs! It's like a 30 min tour..."
,,Easy access from Bugis MRT via the Downtown line,4.0,,"We went twice, once to check it out and then to buy toys from an old lady at one of the stands. There are not too many places selling toys in Singapore but we were able to haggle a wee bit. The prices were pretty good when compared to shops in the large upmarket malls. Watch where the locals eat, we had very generous pork and duck meals for $5 each"
,,Chinatown - What more to say,5.0,,"The sounds, the colour, the smells, the people and the shops/stalls it has it all. Buy a tailored shirt/trousers,jewelry and watches. Not to mention the electronics. Don't forget to bargain. Then onto the souvenirs."
,,Vibrant,5.0,,"Vibrant. Full of people on roads. Not for someone who likes silence. However if you are like me who like to be part of a crowd, this is the place to have fun by observing different people and culture."
,,Go early for bargins,5.0,,"Forget the designer labels in the malls and Burgis street, check out Chinatowns stalls. My daughter and I went early in the morning (some places were not even open). You get the best deals if you are the first customer but you must bargain hard and be willing to walk away. I recommend Chinatown for a morning out or night trip. We purchased shoes, cloths, souvenirs and food and drinks all at very good prices. Nearby are some amazing cultural places Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum (Open 7:00am to 7:00pm daily), and Sri Mariamman Temple, both are worth visiting. Chinatown is a fascinating peek into Singapore’s Chinese culture and history with busy crowds, great food and fun shopping."
,,Busy but fun,4.0,,"OK, pretty bustley and some interesting things to see, nice to take relatives when visiting and a few nice places to eat as well. Gets very busy at the weekend though."
,,fascinating.,5.0,,"Culturally amazing, busy crowds, great food, somewhat expensive when compared to rest o the island but hey you have just travelled thousands of miles to get here. Soak it up. Buddhist temple is a must"
,,There is the place to shop cheap !,4.0,,"Forget the designer labels of orchard road or the tiny sizes of bug is street, Chinatown is the place to shop and eat/drink for cheaper prices. You can buy lots of souvenirs, clothes(yes bigger sizes) perfume,cups/tea sets, children's clothing tec. It is also cheaper to eat and drink here especially the beer prices compared to coarse qvuay area.highky recommend for a day out and a night trip as well"
,,"Great food, great sights",5.0,,This area has several wonderful restaurants and you are immersed in Chinese culture. The streets are clean and I felt very safe throughout Singapore.
,,Chinatown Historical Walking Tour (aka Red Light District Tour!),5.0,,"This was a Singapore Tour with a difference. It started in Chinatown as the old red light district and moved to Geylang, the current red light district. Sharul, our guide, was enthusiastic, passionate (sorry, no pun intended!) and entertaining. The 3 hours flew by! This is not the sanitised version of Singapore!"
,,Fun for a look around,3.0,,"We visited on our way to get to the maxwell food court for some chicken rice, lots of shops, my GF picked up a cheap dress and some chopsticks, great ice cream sandwiches from a vendor at the end of pagoda street for 1.20, the shops did seem pretty expensive though, and being from london I couldn't help thinking I was visiting Singapore's version of those ghastly Union Jack shops in central London. Plus the toilets here were one of the only ones we had to pay for and were nasty. Make your way over to the stunning marina!"
,,Chinatown and beyond,5.0,,"An interesting mixture of small market stalls, loads of restaurants and wet market. Lots os cheap tourist items on the stalls mixed in with taylors who will make you a made to measure suit or dress within a couple of days. Do haggle a little with the prices. The eating area in the centre has a wonderful array of dishes all very cheap and what we tried was delicious. See the local men playing board games on the tables outside the market. Wander away from the centre and explore peoples park which has a chinese shopping mall inside. If you want a manicure or pedicutre do go here as there are loads of beauty therapists available with their little shops here.
The MRT station is very central making access very easy."
,,Wouldn't touch the food with a barge pole,2.0,,"The architecture in Chinatown is quaint and lovely. We walked around in the morning when not much was happening. It did however make me never want to go back for a meal. Food sanitary was disgusting, we walked past stalls that had noodles left on the counter for vermin to eat (uncovered food stalls) there was also an old guy preparing food while feral cats lay on his preparation bench! Is there no food prep standards/laws???!!!"
,,"Great shopping, Very historic area.",4.0,,We enjoyed this vibrant area. The shopping cheaper than other areas in Singapore. We had a nice hour massage too. Very historic area. Great to see the old buildings of the past. A top vibe. Bit dirty in some areas.
,,Waste of time,3.0,,"I wouldnt waste my time here if i only had a few days in singapore, you will only find bad restaurants and plastic siuvenirs. The only good thing is the red pagode which is wuiet nice to see. You are better off visiting other parts of the city."
,,Omg,5.0,,Wow omg this place was very interesting to be there a lot of great thing to buys and to looki around. Very huge area to look at I am a great time there I am going back to o it very soon for another hoilday
,,Little Chinatown in the Big City,3.0,,"Tradition within the metropolitan modern city of Singapore. full of colours and even more colourful people, its pretty much the usual tourist haunt but it sets itself apart to show the prevalent chinese culture."
,,Wonderful Chinatown in Singapore,4.0,,We had a wonderful time in Chinatown in Singapore. We only had 4 days so it was a case of fitting everything in as much as possible. The people were friendly and helpful. We felt safe and secure at all times. We wandered and stopped when the mood took us. For a real local treat and experience like no where else head to the CBD (central business district) and look for Lau Pa Sat. (the old market) amazing selection of local and regional food on offer in an open colonial area. Well worth a visit.
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"Like a lot of Chinatowns, but the mix of restaurants and al-fresco options and markets makes a difference. Quite clean (as is expected in Singapore) and a good variety of options."
,,A cultural delight,4.0,,"Lots of market stalls and little shops. Great place to buy souveniers at a good price. At night the streets are lit up with lanterns and you can find a wonderful selection of food stalls selling well priced authentic meals. There are tables and chairs set up in the streets for you to to sit at and enjoy your meal and a beer. This area is famous for the original streethouses that Singapore architecture is famous for. These old buildings have been lovingly restored and decorated in an aray of bright colours. Lovely place for taking photos during the day and night. Visit the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. Although it is a new building, the inside is beautifully decorated and you are allowed to take photos. You can also watch the monks ""chanting"". It is truly amazing to watch. As you exit the temple at the back, you will find a tourist information shop that sells books and souveniers on Singapore. They also give advice and sell tickets for the various tourist attractions. They offer discounts on their tickets to Gardens by the bay and a few other attractions. Well worth visiting them if you want to see the various attractions."
,,Foodies,4.0,,"Smith street for all the food stores. Yes it's ridiculously crowded and filled with tourists. But if you don't want to go to the suburbs and get lost while finding where the stores are, you can find lots of famous stores on the foodie street. Just walk pass all the random little stores trying to sell you stuff.
Durian season, go to the ChinaTown hawker centre store. NOT THE ONE INSIDE THE TOURIST STREET! It's 5mins walk from the MRT station, lots of locals go there."
,,Traditional Chinese cities in Singapore,4.0,,"This area of traditional Chinese nuanced, with houses and traditional culture is still preserved. Building in Chinatown traditional architecture is still maintained. In this place you can shop, dine, or visit the temples located in this area."
,,Find everything,4.0,,"Really like the temples, the food, the ambiance of this place. Could find anything to buy and any food. The place is clean and great to walk around. Very near MRT."
,,A bit of Chinese Culture,4.0,,"To walk around through the streets into the market area you can get some real bargains, the smell of the Chinese food, the dumplings were great, I didn,t want to try some of the other food that was there in front of me, but I was not game. The people there were all competing for your trade, but a great experiance & we brought back some great gifts for our friends back home."
,,I like it!,3.0,,"I enjoyed the environment (opened air local market). It was nice to walk along the road side and see authentic local stuffs. There are many different kind of Chinese foods to try as well. Anyone who is a fan of frog legs must come here. Frog porridge is well known dish that must try. I tried frog legs clay pot, its so yummm...."
,,"Wonderful interesting area, a must visit.",5.0,,"China town is centered around a few market streets. Interesting stores and stalls with great purchasing opportunities. Also quite a few pleasant bars and restaurants. It's great to sit with a Tiger beer and people watch, They're from all countries visiting the delectable Singapore"
,,Exotic fruits,3.0,,You get plenty of souvenirs. You can taste the exotic fruits. You can visit the temple . Next bag to put your galoshes and be sure your shoes. Entering the temple with bare feet .!
,,Must Visit,4.0,,"Must visit when you are in Singapore. Eat at Chinatown food street, shop for souvenirs or trinkets and see the Tooth Relic Temple. Chinatown Heritage Center is close and is under renovation when we went here and will still be under renovation until the end of this year."
,,Good place to stop by for some last minute shopping,4.0,,There are really nice souvenirs for very low price... and it's a nice place to stop by to try some delicious food. The shops like 3 for $10 had a huge attraction. It's a bit crowded due to th cheap prices...but that won't be in your way for a nice shopping experience.
,,Simply a market place,5.0,,Most shop nearly sell the same cheap souvenirs but still appealing for people who like 3 for 10 $. Others sell your name written in Chinese and goes from 15 to 80 bucks.different experience as we had encountered some religious celebration.
,,Excellent Food,5.0,,"Great place for cheap eats, lots of food halls with the best food. See the old blending with the new. Fantastic markets in Sago Street."

,,The Buddhist Temple Is Great,4.0,,"To me, this is much like any Chinatown around the world.... Lots of souvenir type stalls and Chinese style housing and shops.

The highlights for me are the Buddhist Temple (be sure you go to the rooftop garden!) and Food Street, where you can have some tasty local street food inspired cuisine.

The Indian temple is also interesting when they're playing music."
,,Bargains to be found,4.0,,"Well you need to go when you have plenty of time. Also 32 degree heat made it a mission, but wouldn't have missed it. Look before you buy as there are bargians to be had if you take your time."
,,Cute place to take a walk!,5.0,,"Enjoyable place to take a walk, have a look in shops and temples. Eat great food and feel like you are in china!"
,,good place to eat,4.0,,So many choices in Eat Street. Also a nice area to buy souvenirs while your companions are waiting for your orders to arrie.
,,Like it Used to be,5.0,,Nice to see some of the old of Singapore has been retained. This is what I remember Singapore to be like when I was first there 25 years ago. Undercover seated areas -large bottles of beer with curry and a fast vibrant feel.
,,definitely reccommend,5.0,,"loved my visit to china town, great place to go souvenir shopping. take a map with you because there are a few places to see in chinatown such as eating at the maxwell hawkers centre, singapore city gallery, and Sri Mariamman temple, all within walking distance of each other and china town MRT station. Put it on your must do list!"
,,Good Food and walk around,4.0,,"Chinatown is definitely a good place for tourist to walk around and have a feel of the chinese community. There are many shops that sells souvenirs quite cheaply but do not expect it to be of high quality. As for food, there is a food street located at Smith Street but I would recommend the food centre behind the Buddha tooth relic temple, called the Chinatown food centre. This is where the locals eat and you cannot go wrong. Ground floor is where vegetables and other groceries are sold. Food are all located at the 2nd level."
,,Tropical Storm,3.0,,I was very disappointed with China town in Singapore it is quite small and very shabby We did experience the heaviest rain storm we had ever seen though
,,a visit with my husband,5.0,,Singapore is amazing lovely shops safe enviroment english pubs its where Japan met England and England saw them off great piece of history
,,Something different,4.0,,Being in Chinatown Singapore gives you the impression how organized this country is. I was really impressed how clean and well together the place looks like. I wasn't impressed with their products but its worth visiting for tourist if you are in Singapore.
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"Great Chinatown, lots of food and stores. Great atmosphere and located pretty central, so easy to visit."
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,"Just jump on the MRT to Chinatown station, easy, great place for cheap souvenirs, great food and electronics, cameras etc if you are careful.....great place for just wandering around and taking in the atmosphere, just like Hong Kong without so many hawkers. Easy to spend a day here"
,,street market,5.0,,"Booking hotel in here because we really like the oriental atmosphere, street market, street food and located in the heart of singapore"
,,Great place to go for shopping & food a must do when in Singapore,5.0,,"Chinatown is easy to get to by MRT or bus.There are plenty of shops and stalls selling everything and anyhting from touristy trinkets & baubles,cheap clothes,electronics and various other items.I find it very hard to come away empty handed.
There are plenty of cheap places to eat and have a beer when you are shopped out or just need a rest or just fancy people watching with a cold one.
I visit Singapore often and always drop by at least once per visit."
,,A Must Visit Market,4.0,,This is a must visit place when you are traveling to Singapore. Here you can find souvenirs and t-shirts at cheap price. Dont forget to try the seafood restaurant which located in the middle of the market. I dont remember the name but it was easy to find since its the most crowded with people and also has a tripadvisor logo at the entrance.
,,Street eats and bad shopping!,4.0,,"The street food in the Chinatown area is fantastic. Hard to go past a big prawn curry laksa. Cheap beers too. The satay's are also great value and taste really good.

Don't go to Chinatown though for any shopping. It's all $2 shop stuff. Didn't really spend anytime in the shops. Saw enough from the outside not to bother."
,,Chinatown with colonial architecture,3.0,,"First and import and to know - air condition is not present here and the bazar/eatery place has a transparent roof above. Inside temperature for a Scandinavian is like taking steam bath with clothes on. That means not much wish for food, but thirsty. Two diet cokes are about 12 dollars which I find ridiculous, comparing for all the prices around for gadgets being sold ""3 for 10 dollars"".
Compared to Chinatown in Kuala Lumpur it's clean and free from fake handbags and police raids. The food in Maxwell street is supposed to be legendary but we found it dirty, busy and extremely hot. We will maybe try again but my advice is plan your trip well. Instead of wandering around in extreme heat go for what interests you."
,,Good markets,4.0,,"The markets are markets...good range and what you would expect. However the food court there is not really worth the money, better to walk up the road to the Maxwell Food hawker centre."
,,Worth the visit and great for dinner,5.0,,Not sure how the resturants go as the food stalls down the middle have an awesome selection of food. The food is great and very clean. Many stalls to pick up bits and pieces along the way. We got the train there and so easy and you come out of the station right in the heart of China town. Really beautiful at night when all lit up.
,,A must visit place,5.0,,"A visit to China Town a must on the list things to do . The unique shopping experience will leave you happy with the good bargains , the typical Chinese eateries offering you non expensive meals are added bonus . Easy access by public tranport makes it more attractive a place ."
,,"Clothes, Fengshui, Memoirs",4.0,,"Mainly clothes and memorabilia in plenty. Hidden in between are a couple of perfume shops-with all world renowned brands. Home decorative items, fengshui in plenty. Very close to the Subway station. Take the exit towards Pagoda street at the China Town station."
,,The year of the goat,4.0,,"Visiting around Chinese New Year, this visit was lively and bustling and we went more than once. There was a tourist side with shops selling trinkets to take home but there were also areas where the Chinese would shop and eat and these were great.
We had supper at a Hawker centre that involved grabbing a seat at a large circular table then choosing food from the various units all with pictures of their food for customers to see. It was great to share a table with locals and really get to feel the atmosphere of the area.
We had to go when it was dark to see the wonderful illuminations that went the length of the main street. Goats everywhere!"
,,Wow is the word!,5.0,,"Shopping is easy in this area. I find it safe, convenient and fun. Street foods available everywhere and all good, a must try!"
,,China Town Visit,4.0,,During our Duck Tours trip around Singapore we stopped off at Chinatown for lunch and a visit to the various markets. The food in Chinatown is great with authentic Chinese cuisine available at a fraction of the cost of the usual tourist prices. Just look for the places that are frequented by the local Chinese people and you can't go wrong. The indoor and outdoor markets are great places for shopping for souvenirs etc. A walk around the area reveals a lot of unusual architecture that offers great photo opportunities. All in all a great place to visit.
,,Chinatown - great for the family!,5.0,,"We are a family of five and we absolutely loved the markets in Chinatown!! We also ate at the restaurants in Chinatown, the food was beautiful! The markets were full of mechanidise for the Chinese New Year, it was so pretty!"
,,A Good Experience!,4.0,,"Singapore’s Chinatown is definitely one of the better and larger ones that I have ever visited throughout my extensive travelling. It is a stop on the sightseeing Hop on Hop Off Bus and from there you can easily spend two hours roaming through the street markets, stores, food court and temples. I managed to get myself some very good souvenirs in the area and the food court is very affordable. I even managed to find the famous Chilli Crab there. On the downside I did find some of the merchants to be very annoying with their constant pushy attitudes trying to get me to buy stuff which I simply didn’t want or need. Even when I said no thanks, some of them come into your face trying to foist their merchandise on you. No thanks. If I want something I will buy it."
,,Bargains galore,4.0,,If you are prepared to bargain and bargain hard you can get some amazing bargains in Chinatown. Also definitely a one stop area for all your touristy souvenirs and take home gimmicks. Just a fun day out.
,,Great place for food,5.0,,Chinatown is very easily accessible in Singapore as there is North East Mrt line and also the downtown line. There are lots of great food found in Chinatown with the locals often going to two hawker centre there known as 1) Hong Lim food complex and 2) Chinatown food complex. Hong lim food complex is just behind Chinatown point where the famous heng Kee curry mee can be found there. Whereas Chinatown food complex's famous food is the Steamed Fish Head which sells at approx $15 each is the fav among the locals. Other local food can also be found at these food complex. Shopping is primary in this area as most things are souvenirs for tourists to get. Cheap Massage is also available at people's park centre and as well as getting Chinese herbs is also very easy to find in Chinatown as there are a lot of Chinese medical shops
,,Old World Experience,4.0,,"Shops opens early at Chinatown and it would be ideal to be among the first to avoid the crowd. We visited the area by ourselves though tours may be booked. Interesting are the temples that dot the area and its a pleasure to see and experience the religious practices of other religions. The architecture is well preserve reminiscence of a bygone time w/ the street filled w/ shops and eateries ( should try chili crabs). Except for the bake shops, food and medicine stalls the other stores are somewhat a disappointment as they generally sell the same merchandise (souvenirs and the likes). One souvenir that we had though is to have our name engrave in stone seal or chops the skill of the engraver is just fantastic! Took us about 2-3 hours to finish our tour including lunch."
,,"Modernised and Clean Chinatown, Singapore",4.0,,"Cleaner and more updated than many other Chinatown in other countries.
Not a tiny one or two lanes with graffitis on the walls, dated worn out buildings with dirty side streets nor clammed streets with stalls and pick pocket opportunists.
Singapore Chinatown is more than 1 or 2 streets. New and Old buildings offer variety of stalls, nice eateries, salons, local shopping centres, different classes of hotel (budget, tourist and business) within walking distance. Good transportation (MRT, Buses and Taxis) and safety. Enjoy good clean fun day or night. Specially, on Autumn Festival & Chinese New Year, Chinatown is well decorated and vibrant."
,,•Busy•Vibrant•Budget•,3.0,,"By Lanes of Chinatown are lined with Numerous shops dealing in Cheap to Mediocre Buys of Electronic gadgets, Paintings to Chinese Pottery, Clothes to Bags, Souvenirs, Handicrafts, Artefacts and accessories adding up to a Budget Shoppers delight.
Culturally strong, this township brings forth its Chinese traditions as initiated by their Ancestors. The Chinese New Year falling in Feb.month, ushers in the Revelry with an Eclectic mix, worth Visiting once.....for a Photographers Delight.
MRT connection brings you to the doorstep of Chinatown... from where the Buddha Tooth Relic & Sri Mariamman Temple is in vicinity and makes A Good Visit.
Pubs, cafes, Kiosk, Restaurants are strewn across this place brimming with Tourists.
For the Foodie buff authentic Chinese and diverse spread of SAsian Cuisines makes a Day/an evening enjoyable and the street style of Dining is a great experience !"
,,Chinatown in Singapore....,3.0,,"Being a Cantonese - my dad used to live in the Chinatown area and so did my paternal grandparents, more than 50 years ago....

My late paternal grandpa was a dentist and they also had a rattan shop selling rattan products and Chinese medicated oil...I grew up with my paternal grandpa and it is no wonder that I am attracted to nutmeg oil and I love nibbling on nutmegs too!

Chinatown - with a dominant presence of the Cantonese (one of the many Chinese dialect groups in Singapore) - it has a unique culture, flavour of its own..

Yet that was in the olden days - it's a thing of the past...

Currently, there was an influx of tourist souvenir shops of all kinds and many restaurants of non-Cantonese origin that came to operate in the Chinatown area... hence its Cantonese original flavour has been somewhat ""diluted""...

Yet despite this setback - Chinatown is a place for the first time visitors to explore a little about the Chinese tradition, culture and heritage of Singapore.

There are a few temples, quaint little shops along Temple Street, Smith Street where one can find all kinds of local souvenirs as well as items from Asia. There is Maxwell Food Centre where there's an array of local cuisine - Malay, Indian, Chinese food of all varieties are readily available for the adventurous food lover - who is ready to explore our local cuisines.

If you like to visit a Hindu Temple and a Buddhist Temple (with the relic of Buddha's Tooth) - do take a walk around and explore to discover the rich culture of the Lion City - Singapura!

Enjoy your stay in Singapura (the Lion City) - also known as SINGAPORE!"
,,Shops and kiosks with cheaper goods..,3.0,,"The area is decorated like Chinese town. The shops, kiosks and small vendors sell different cheap Chinese goods. We were not impressed with the quality of the good or with the ambience of the area. The place is just over emphasised. Go only if you have extra time in Singapore."
,,Singapore's Chinatown the genuine article!,5.0,,"Easy access for strolling around the clean and varied markets and food areas, where there is so much to take in you almost forget to take advantage of the bargains!"
,,"Great Food, Great Variety and a great experience",5.0,,"In the Middle of China Town there is a huge eatery (like market stalls) with all the different kinds of foods. We love Indian and Thai and there was so much to choose from. Every taxi driver know where to take you or you can catch a hop on and off bus that goes right past it. Satay Sticks are 70cents each and are just unreal. We had heard about this from our hotel and there weren't wrong. They are on the outside of this huge eatery and when you sit down they come around and ask you how many you want, they will also get jugs of beer for you so cheap. The fried rice is unreal and as you walk around you can experience all the different kinds of food, a great place to take kids. I would definitely go there again. Value for money"
,,""" Souvenir Place"",restaurants",3.0,,"Because,is a part of Singapore,I I went to see, lots of shops restaurants,lots of people.Was fun .but the shops are all the same, selling the same low quality items. But if you never saw a Chinatown you will like.If you want to buy fabrics,beads,sheets,pajamas.Is for you! Is fun ! Go see ,spend 2,3 hours,have a lunch. Take the MRt purple color Dt 19.."
,,We went later at night,4.0,,"We were on a night time tour of Singapore and our last stop was Chinatown. At first it looked like most places were closed, it was before 10pm. As we walked farther down the street, we were wrong, many stalls were open as well as different food places. It was fun strolling down the streets and looking into the different stalls and some stores. The nice thing was there was no high pressure person out in front of the stall. That can be really wearing while trying to just take a look. We bought a wall hanging scroll with our son and future daughter in law's names written in Chinese and the word love. It was hand done because we watched. The artist did a great job and we had a beautiful gift for the special couple."
,,A china town as many others around the world,4.0,,"If you have visited other China Towns around the world this isn't much different. Expect a lot of people and many shops selling the same ""china quality"" gadgets."
,,"Busy , busy , busy!",4.0,,"Always an interesting experience , this thriving part of Singapore makes you feel almost as if you are in China itself. Lots of interesting shops , restaurants and the temple in the centre of the market is well worth a visit . Peoples evident devotion to the buddha there is quite special."
,,"Fantastic Attraction, Excellent Variety",5.0,,"You'll love this area, full of shops, kiosks and eateries. There is even a fish spa for your feet! The variety of goods for sale and places to eat are tremendous. Easy access via Hop-On, Hop-Off & MRT. Highly recommended."
,,Was just OK!!!,3.0,,"We spent about an hour walking around China Town checking out all of the shops and stalls. Wasn't overly impressed with the quality of items on sale - in my opinion most of the stuff looked cheap.

When compared to other parts of Singapore I visisted, the area was no where near as nicely presented or clean."
,,Do the walking tour of Chinatown,5.0,,"We did the free walking tour of Chinatown and it was great! The guide was knowledgable and friendly. But the history!! From the shops to the clan houses to the temples, it was a couple of hours immersed in a bygone era. Well worth the time. And like any Chinatown anywhere in the world, plenty of things to buy, eat or drink."
,,Clean and a bit antiseptic but still worth a look,3.0,,"We returned here in May 2015 after our previous visit 4 years earlier. While it was still worth a visit, it was nowhere near as much fun as it was 4 years ago. The shops were pretty similar but maybe a few more cheap souvenir shops were around this time. Still the most 'real' bit of Singapore but not a patch on Kuala Lumpur. Go have a look but don't expect too much authenticity."
,,Nothing Special,3.0,,"Caught a taxi and had him drop off at the main street of traditional Chinatown at Pagoda Street.

Looked really nice with lanterns and a lot of awning covered market stalls.

My wife has been really keen to buy a pashmina. As expected stall vendors encouraging you in, offering to make you shirts etc etc. At the first place we decided to actually go inside just browsing at all the stuff they had....vendor asked where we were from....replied Australia and just browsing....next thing he started telling us that when Australians say they are browsing it means that they are not going to buy anything and that our Prime Minister Tony Abbott is just a big browser etc etc...seriously!! on that we decided to leave and not cop any more abuse. Clearly he must be doing well to scare customers off.

Overall it did not dampen our Chinatown trip but found the stuff was either really tacky or priced no less than Orchard Road...

The food however was pretty good.

We caught the Metro to Orchard Road."
,,Must Do!!!!!!!!!!!,5.0,,"Chinatown is a great area of Singapore, heaps of different Hawker Centre's and some really good Hotels in the area at well, we stayed at the Naumi Liora which was 2 minutes walk from the Chinatown complex, also of great area to walk around and take it all in. Really worth a visit"
,,totally different from the neat and tidy city,3.0,,"you climb up from chinatown MRT, and exit onto Pagoda street, and you might as well be in another city. narrow streets with awnings and stalls extending onto the stree, making it narrower. One exclusive shop selling tintin products. other dollar stores offering numerous cheap momentos, electronics, phone chargers, household goods, keychains, ...and you name it.
There are multiple small eateries , all serving beer.
You cut across temple street via narrow alleys, where you see electricity being conserved by smart lights which come on only when there is movement.
The Good beer company, serving innmerable varieties of beer on the tap is there.
the other end of smith street is the chinatown food street, with all variety of street food ( reviewed seperately).
A must for a visitor to spend a few hours in the evening to get some affordable shopping, beer guzzling, and having the street food."
,,My favourite area of town,5.0,,"Singapore is a very expensive town but the Chinatown area is very well priced with food and drink at a fraction of the costs of other areas of the city. Chinatown is a very friendly, fun area of town, lots of market stalls and cheap (£1 type) shops selling tat very cheaply. Great atmosphere and a genuine vibe.
A must see place"
,,Don't miss,4.0,,Shopping and food experiece. U can find what you like and you can talk a lot with the local people that are thinking only to the business! Nice to pass an half day.
,,Tradition in the midst of modernity,4.0,,"Interesting traditional neighborhood full of shops, cafes,bars and restaurants. Food street is a must."
,,"Chinatown Singapore - Souviners, Food, Hustle & Bustle!",4.0,,"I visited Chinatown in Singapore for a few hours during my trip in October last year - it was busy and crowded, but I love that so I had fun! As soon as I stepped out of the exit of the MRT I could feel the vibe, and a smile crept across my face. Lots of snack stalls, restaurants and shops. A must see!"
,,Smells good,5.0,,Yummy foods yummy smells novel way to order and eat. Love going to china town lots of Food stalls. So friendly and helpful.
,,Char Kwai Teou HEAVEN !,5.0,,"Personal Shopping: Check
Gifts and Souvenirs: Check
Amazing Street Food: Check
Busy and bustling, Singapore's Chinatown district is quite expansive.
Markets and little hidey holes everywhere, I'm pretty sure whatever you seek... If you look carefully... you will find.

Haninanese Chicken Rice: Check !!!!
Authentic Char Kwai Teou: Check !!!!! - send me back !!"
,,Ambling in Chinatown,4.0,,Found Chinatown to be interesting to say the least. Shopowners were not pushy but helpful. Had lunch at one of the cafe's and had a great lunch for a reasonable price. Bought a really lovely piece of authentic silk which I had framed when I got home. Looks great on the lounge wall.
,,The Chinatown experience...,4.0,,I loved it here. Food and shopping aplenty. You should be able to find just about anything you need here especially for souvenir gifts.
,,Food and shopping,4.0,,"I loved my chinatown experience! Food and shopping for great finds! The whole place screams of chinatown, nice chinese lanterns and the fascade of the buildings are cute and colorful. Here i bought things to give away to my folks back home. What's more amazing is that it has it's own chinatown food street!"
,,Boisterous and I love it!,4.0,,"Yes, you read it right - Chinatown is one of the boisterous places in SG :)
With its narrow streets full of sidewalk vendors, this is one of the shopping havens in the city, next to Bugis.

The stalls offer a wide variety of goodies for sale -- from souvenir shops to Chinese and Singaporean foodies. Also, eating in the hawker areas within Chinatown will make you drool and indulge in Singaporean and Chinese concoctions! One of my favorite places in SG for gastronomic adventure (aside from Tiong Bahru)!"
,,an enjoyable place to be in Singapore,4.0,,"Its one of the best place to visit in the whole Singapore. there are a lot of things to do like shopping/ eating(may be pricey at some store for food but beers are kind of cheap). The tian tian chicken rice at maxwell food centre is nice for lunch and at night for supper , the Congee/ rice porridge @ Tiong Shian Porridge(near MRT) is a must try"
,,Enjoy the bargaining and sight seeing.,3.0,,"Here has a lot of souvenir shops that we can buy, do not forget to bargain. A famous Hindu temple and a famous Buddhist temple also located very close, please prepare time to visit."
,,A great loud time!,5.0,,"This china town is crazy! It was really busy, but I think there was some kind of festival while we where there because there were dragon puppets on the street and some flags along the street lights. But it was awesome and the market was so busy and there were so many people screaming out offers and I tried some water infused with chia seeds for the first time. A really great time if you don't mind the loudness of it all."
,,Shop and Eat!,4.0,,Alot of good food around the area if you want to eat. There are a lot of shops here which sells cheap stuff. One good thing i like about here is that their Frog Porridge is delicious. :D
,,Feels like being there..!!,4.0,,"Mostly you find China Town in all Asian countries,like China market in Malaysia is in a market place but this China Town in Singapore gives you the feel of real China Town,where you can enjoy from authentic Chinese Food to Shopping mostly electronic,once there you feel being there."
,,Rainy ChinaTown,3.0,,"I am giving 3 star based on my judgement and maybe it should get 5 star but when I reached China town, I was really looking forward to eat in Hawker center but to my bad luck it was super heavy downpour I couldn't manage to look around and find what I really wanted. I could only take shelter and looks around shops.

I highly suggest that you don't go to china town when it is raining or you will be sad like me. And don't travel during rainy season (December and Jan), it is not like it rained whole day, it was just that when I reached china town it started raining and after 1 hour it stopped but I was already gone by then."
,,Best Place for Souvenirs,4.0,,"Recently, I went to Singapore and that was my second time. I always buy small things or souvenirs for people back home whenever I go somewhere be it within or outside the country.

Chinatown has always been my choice of place for souvenirs and small gifts rather than going to malls.

The place is clean, it has a near MRT station and the prices are reasonable but sometimes you can even haggle to get a better deal. They have so many souvenirs to choose from. They sell almost all items like shirts, magnets, pens, key chains, bag tags and other souvenirs from Singapore.

Apart from those, it is also the place where you can buy authentic perfumes for a lesser price.

After doing your shopping, you can also visit their temples and take pictures. They also have restaurants available but my favorite is Wall's ice cream. It only cost 1 SGD. They offer different flavors. What makes them special? You get to eat a thick, creamy ""slice"" of ice cream in between two wafers.

I'll definitely go back here whenever I plan to visit Singapore again in the future. I just love the place."
,,A Singapore highlight,5.0,,"We stopped over in Singapore for 2 days between Sydney and London and found we spent a significant portion of that time exploring Singapore's Chinatown.

Our 18 month old daughter fell in love with chicken rice and sugar cane juice from some of the local stalls.

We will definitely head back to Chinatown next time we are in Singapore."
,,Great place for food & street shopping!,3.0,,"I stayed in a hostel in Chinatown. This place is great mainly in terms of food and street shopping of clothes, souvenirs and other basic things. Bargaining is a must in this market. Food is available at economical price and also a lot of variety is available.

Must visit at night!"
,,awesome!,5.0,,"I loved my time visiting Chinatown in Singapore. The shops were stocked with many interesting items. I purchased two handbags, jewelry and some funky sunglasses! Loved it!"
,,Great market area,3.0,,The china town area is just beautiful so many colours and so many different eateries and markets. Get area to just wonder around. The market area can become very over grounded and can sometimes be very hard to walk around freely.
,,Economical place.....!,5.0,,If you want to buy something for a affordable price this is the best place which you must visit. Singapore souvenirs are very cheap in this place.
,,Good for food and gift,4.0,,"If you want to buy gifts for family and friends, you came to the right place. It has many variety of gift like tshirt, keychain, dolls, and etc.. You can also have a great breakfasta at people's park."
,,Colorful town,3.0,,"This place is crowded, we just took a taxi to look around and headed back to little India. China town was heavily decorated and looked very colorful."
,,Shopping,3.0,,Bargaining is a must. Great fun. Easy to find by using MRT right into Chinatown and Little India. Enjoy.
,,China town,3.0,,We went to China Town one evening. I would say this would be the better time to go as you see the night lanterns and they do look quite pretty. Overall I could have past on going here as the stalls were not what I was expecting as they were mostly all the same thing. I was expecting more variety of goods to be available. If you are keen for the cuisine then there are hundreds of places to eat.
,,Very intersting,4.0,,"Great place to walk around and see all the Chinese good on sale things you never see elsewhere also so very good resturants, or real worth a trip and walk around"
,,Quaint and charming at the same time,4.0,,"There are very few spots in Singapore that I visited on my 3 day stopover that I didnt find inviting. Chinatown was just one of those spots. Very quaint, squeaky clean! and enchanting. We purchased a nice brocade gown from one of the shop keepers next to the South Indian Temple.The temple by itself was a serendipitous discovery, though it was on the map. The streets are lined with small Chinese eateries selling everything from Peking ducks to other exotic dishes.
Didn't really spend too much time there- maybe next time."
,,Is a good place for food and others thing,4.0,,"If you have the time to walk around there is alot of food stall (e.g. tim sum, fruits, rice and many others more) as for things to buy e.g. chinese medicine, clothes, gold and many more, so do prepare for alot of cash if you want to buy alot"
,,Excellent food at economical price,4.0,,"Must go to Chinatown to see the place and eat the food. The hawker center's food is authentic and economical. However, the place is not so clean , hot n humid but worth the trip. Dress down n wear loose clothes so as the perspiration will not get into you. Most of the food stalls serves good food but those with long queues, serves great food. Walk around the Chinatown area and enjoy the sights."
,,a must visit,4.0,,"a good visit but it took us time to find the right China Town market :). we first went a mall next the China town market, then entered another area of china town, finally- succeeded in reaching to THE market. great experience- good shops - for tops and bags...30$ above in discount...i was happy shopping. Bought fridge magnets - pls magnets for ur friends form this market only- gr8 choice- all shops give 3 products in 10$. food is average. It is in middle of the MRT station - so, a great thing. across the road is a busy market with lots and lots of options, and a great shopping mall, OG. if u going with small kids..what a kids section..missed checking out the 'she' section - got fascinated with my daughter's shopping only...njoy"
,,Bustling with bargains,4.0,,I'm currently travelling through Singapore and I'm stopping in Chinatown. There are so many stalls full of bargains and everyone is so friendly and welcoming. There is a food court in the centre where you can buy a range of bits. All at reasonable prices. It's definitely prettier at night with all the lanterns lit up. It is touristy but I love all that.
,,Found by chance,4.0,,I was trying to find a temple and located China town just behind it. Its a nice place but for an Indian it doesn't offer much to shop. But its quite a vision. Although i did buy a pajama for 7.90 sgd.
,,must do went in singapore,5.0,,"walked to chinatown from where we were staying 10 min walk and was not disappointed love this area from the malls to the street markets.theres a few temples in the area (must see)
we went at night love the lanterns lit up at night. the soveniers stores (3 for $ 10)
the restaurant. the smells.just the fantastic atmosphere of the place
theres a mrt station right in the middle of it all,also went to the maxwell food centre cheap food a must do"
,,Bang goes my budget,5.0,,"We love visiting Chinatown, the people, food and atmoshere and spend quite a bit off our budget here lol"
,,"A must see, evening out.",5.0,,"Touristy, maybe. Alive, bright, busy absolutely yes. This is a must if you are in Singapore for any amount of time!"
,,Place to eat and shop !,4.0,,"Chinatown with filled with traditional shops, night markets and a lot of good food to try any time of the day ... many delicious foods !!
This is also an ideal place if one wants to carry small souvenirs for friends.
Cheap souvenirs & eats ! Go enjoy !

P/s : If you come here, you can try Bakkwa (Pork Jerky), I believe it will steal your stomach :)"
,,Must see,4.0,,"We walked round for ages there is just too much to see, the street markets are the best I think you can find almost anything . When it gets too hot go onto the air conditioned malls you will never see it all ."
,,Subdued and touristy,3.0,,"Based on some of the reviews, I guess it's best to go at night. During the day at least, it seemed too kitschy (touristy) and not really that authentic. It also seemed pretty subdued. I think Bangkok's Chinatown is much better. The ""street"" food (little shops in the center of one of the streets, not the restaurants lining the street) wasn't anything special. Better Chinese food is available elsewhere, I think. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is worth checking out, but the rest of Chinatown just wasn't that exciting or interesting."
,,The place to eat Chilli Crab,5.0,,"This is the place to eat the best Chilli Crab, In between meandering through the different market stalls. Pick up a bargain or 2. Friendly lively atmosphere."
,,Nice Place,5.0,,It is the mini china in sigapore.It is near to the little india.You will get taste of china here...It is better if you can visit during chinese new year.You will get all chinese chocolates and all other things.
,,China town,3.0,,"Nice place to go around during the day and also evening . In case you wish to purchase gifts , this is the place where you would get at a reasonable price .
As far as food is concerned, you would get lots of varieties of sea food and authentic Chinese dishes"
,,Another night time treat.,5.0,,"Like so much of Singapore this area seemed to come alive at night. All the lanterns, flowers and lights were really effective. Definitely worth a visit.

Very easy to get to, it is about 1km or so from Robertson Quay and less to Clarke Quay - so it is an easy walk from these and the subway intersects here too."
,,Great sites and photo opportunities here,5.0,,"Great walk through some of the old style areas of Singapore. Great multi story shopping arcade with lots of things to browse through from old to modern, souvenirs, cameras, electronics etc. There is a MUST try food hall here also with very small kitchens by the hundreds which makes it very difficult to choose what you want in one visit. Genuine Asian cooking and flavours abound here and the smells can be very exciting. Try not coming back the next night to try something else on offer."
,,your quota of culture,5.0,,"A quaint area where you can see traditional chinese culture and wander also shop for gifts like dragon pendants and feng shui items There is also a lot of street food available which you can try ,you can enjoy authentic chinese food here."
,,Bustling Chinatown in The Heart of Singapore!,4.0,,"Chinatown is located in city, so this is easily accessible by public transport.

There are many old shophouses that line the many streets and a stroll down these streets will allow you to see the diversity of each houses' design and architecture. Most of these shophouses have been refurbished and restored to their former glory.

There are also many eateries and shops that sell souvenirs for keepsakes. Eateries are more than I can count. You can choose from a food stall selling local delights to a sit-down Chinese restaurant.

The hawker centre and the wet market are also places that you can explore to see how locals go about their marketing or where they dine.

During important dates of the Chinese calendar, such as Chinese New Year, Mooncake festivals, the streets are also decorated with lanterns and lights to bring out the festive atmosphere!

Must-visit!"
,,The prettiest street in Singapore,4.0,,"The floral display hanging above the main street of Chinatown is what makes this place really special.
We were lucky enough to be taken slowly through Chinatown on a bike Tuk tuk. Our driver stopped in various spots and took photos for us and told us all about each place. We then had some midnight Chinese food and beer (this place was STILL open! ) Chinatown is like being in another country, whilst you're already in another country. Gorgeous!"
,,Special area,5.0,,"You find Chinatowns in every major city you visit but this one is worth a visit. Alot of restaurants where you can taste the Chinese and other Asian food. Alot of shops where you can buy souvenirs, clothes, shoes,... but also some shops in the second street which sells very good tea, antique, Chinese herbs,.. An area where many tourists wanna be..."
,,Fantastic place,5.0,,We travelled by taxi from our hotel to Chinatown. The shops were great for souvenirs which were very reasonably priced. We had lunch and a large beer which was excellent value for money. I would highly recommend a visit to Chinatown
,,"Food, food, food",3.0,,"If you've traveled around Asia, you won't be too impressed with the temples in China Town, Singapore. Nevertheless, China town is worth the visit. This is a nice escape from the modern and big city (mind you, it's still relatively modern for a china town). The beste thing about China Town is the food. Way cheaper than other main areas of Singapore and goooooood."
,,Clinically clean bustling area with food & soveniers to purchase,4.0,,"I was taken aback by how clinically clean Singapore's Chinatown was, like all of Singapore, Despite temperatures of 32 C and stiffling humidity not a fly or insect in sight! Coming out of the MRT line, cross the bridge and you are greeted by restaurant staff who will try to entice you into their restaurants. Lots of tourists in the area. Nice soveniers can be bought 3 for 10 Singapore $ just under £5.00 fixed prices. along the street lots of Chinesse fine foods and delicacies. On the next street are some good quality Chineese restaurants. Maxwell food centre a 10 -15 minute walk from here. Lovely place to sit near one of the drinks stalls and sip coffee, or a drink"
,,Always have to go back,4.0,,No matter how many times I visit Singapore I always have to visit Chinatown. It has that special magic about it that makes you want to go back. It has so much history. Just go and visit and you will understand what I mean
,,A highlight of any visit to Singapore,5.0,,"It's easy to spend a whole day here, loads to do, lots of places of worship to visit, lots of shopping available and lots of hawker stalls selling delicious food. It's also the place to come if you need to exchange currency."
,,Great food here!,4.0,,"This is a lovely place to experience local Chinese food. I ate here twice, many food stands and restaurants to choose from. Convenient to get here as the metro rail is close proximity."
,,A good place to walk around and get cheap gifts,3.0,,"This is not a spectacular Chinatown compared to areas like San Francisco but it is a good 4 hour adventure if you run out of other better destinations in Singapore. I would recommend doing the bus tour of Singapore with unlimited on/off for 24 hours. Visit Chinatown, Little India and Marina Bay to complete a full day of sightseeing and shopping."
,,worth a visit,4.0,,"Worth a visit since its famous!! A place for shopping, siteseeing and dining, especially if you are interested in Chinese culture. Some parts especially at the entrance are modern and blending with city, but go interior to see the true culture in narrow streets."
,,Wow!,5.0,,This was a great place to visit. Would recommend putting this on your must do list when in singapore!
,,"Supposedly one of the ""Old Town"" of the city, but...",1.0,,Array of shops set up but vendors mainly not local. Streets unclean with a foul smell at times. As with all other places you can just find shops and shops... But do beware that cheap goods might more often than not imply a compromise to quality. During festive seasons markets set up there are a total rip off. Vendors can be dishonest at times (based on past experience) and it is horrifying crowded during the lunar new year. Wise to avoid during festive seasons
,,Chinatown Singapore,4.0,,"Chinatown is a great place to wander around, and pick up some souvenirs. Get off the MRT and walk up the lanes and to the right to get to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. Well worth a look. If you're lucky there may be a ceremony in progress. Check out the food market near the station. Plenty of delicious, inexpensive hawker food to eat."
,,Great spot.,4.0,,"Always enjoy a Chinatown in a city but here was great, lots of choices on good quality merchandise and fantastic food places to eat.
It seems a friendly atmosphere and thus an enjoyable experience, I can highly recommend it for a visit.
Great also to walk around and enjoy the architecture."
,,Great cheap meals,4.0,,"Wonderful offerings for travellers on a budget or otherwise. Singapore is such an expensive city that the Food stalls in Chinatown are a wonderful place to get two courses for two people, for $30 in total. Nice!"
,,China Town of Singapore.,4.0,,There are several kind of food that Thai people can easily enjoy eating and you can select any souvenirs with the same kind but different prices.
,,Very Lively Even During The Day.,4.0,,"Lively and very colourful place to see.
Places like Clarke Quay are very quiet during the day but Chinatown is busy all day and night.
We did walk thru some of the small shops but before we knew it we had some guy trying to sell me a suit I wont wear.
I don't mind this sort of thing as Bali is much like this too.
Chinatown has a lot of restaurants like McDonalds and K.F.C for people who don't want to eat the local foods.
The price for food is cheaper here than some other areas of Singapore.
The cheapest way to get here is by the subway (SMRT)."
,,"Great to visit, but buyer beware",5.0,,"Interesting to vist, go thru once to price vs. buy on impulse. All old coins available for the ""US"" are counterfeit. Brass on the inside. Food in the restaurant areas very appealing."
,,WONDERFUL !,5.0,,"Being that my children have Chinese heritage we really enjoyed wondering around taking in the culture of Chinatown. The original buildings and temples , the friendly people, the shopping ..... We spent lots of time here exploring."
,,Trip to Asia June 2015,4.0,,"You could say, you've been to one and you've seen it all. not the case, because the neighborhood has a lot of diversity, there is a mix of Buda and Hindu and it makes it unique. Must go and explore."
,,Bargains,4.0,,"We visited Chinatown many times to pick up some bargains to take home. Very colourful. Some vendors were happy to let us browse, but majority were pushing for business. Most of the small shops all have the same exact items for sale, but managed to do some bartering. We were there during the Singapore Sale, celebrating Singapore's 50th year of independence"
,,Singapore spirit,5.0,,"Chinatown provide you a complex place. You can find the a lot of Singapore street food,and souvernirs with reasonable prices. Herb drink is also my recomment here, good but a little bit expensive."
,,Shpooing Place,3.0,,Nice place for shopping ....but bargening is must ...be carefull ....but noce stuff ....one of the good shopping place
,,Fabulous experience,5.0,,"Simply loved Chinatown. There is do much to do, the street food and restaurants serve wonderful food. We had the mud crab and it was truly delicious. There is a museum and authentic tea houses. It's a great day out and we'll worth a visit."
,,Wonderful place,4.0,,"Fantastic transport links from Chinatown with arguably the best street food in Singapore at the Peoples Park Complex. Chinatown has everything you need from the beautiful temples to money changers to tailors, fish spa's to pharmaceuticals, every kind of food you can imagine and excellent street markets. A much cleaner, safer and exponentially more enjoyable area than say Little India."
,,Old-day Singapore.,4.0,,"Old traditional buildings are restored and preserved to its original grory. Visiting this part of Singapore will give you some ideals, how fast it has changed from an under developed to the world most modernized country in roughly 50 years time. Here, you can find all kind of traditional Chinese hocker's foods, coffee shops, souvenirs, and even taylor to custom made your clothing."
,,Cheap shopping and fun,4.0,,If you wanna buy cheap souvenirs and gifts this is the place. Easy access and you can enjoy local dining here. The lanterns create the Chinese glow around the place you feel like walking around a tiny version of china. Lots of tourists roaming around the area. Also you can go to Temple of the Tooth Relic from here. Hindu Temple also next to the big gate. So you can see the religious deference also. This is nice. enjoy
,,Great shopping.,5.0,,We visited Chinatown a couple of times. The first in the early afternoon. It was enjoyable but hot and humid. The second time was early evening which was much better. We had dinner and shopped. It really is one of the better markets to shop in Singapore. Hint: Buy when you see something you like. Prices are similar and it will save going back later.
,,There is always a Chinatown!,5.0,,"Its funny isnt it, most the places i have travelled,there is always a ChinaTown.
Now im a lover of the old China Town Districts and like most, Singapore's ChinaTown its where you go to do a little culture searching with an abundance of absolutly stunning temples and sacred sites, cheaper and better massages than your run of the mill, nick knack shopping (cheap touristy gifts for the loved ones at home), a plethora of Chines Herbal stores and most importantly - incredible food. Chinatown here hosts one of the best Hawker Food Centres in Singapore - The Maxwell Hawker Centre, famous for its carrot cake which is actually a savoury dish, not a cake, the famous Hainese Chicken and Rice, Mushroom Omelette and a great serving of Roast Duck!

If you need it, Chinatown has it!"
,,Fun place worth a short visit,4.0,,Great place to walk around and shop for souvenirs and have some good local food and coffee. Can even take a break with their free wifi available only in the lanes of Chinatown
,,Be careful,2.0,,"The store owners are glib talking crooks. False discounts fast talkers and to be treated with absolute caution.
I had to return to one store and demand to speak to the owner. After an hour he would not return n any money but did give extra merchandise. Even so we were ripped off bud time."
,,Great Visit and a lot to see.,5.0,,"We spent half a day in Chinatown. A lot of little shops selling souvenirs, temples and food center with very delicious authentic local food. Used the bus to get there and train to get back to the hotel without any issues at all."
,,Hustle & bustle,3.0,,"Typical of many Chinatowns around the world there are narrow streets with crowded stalls, shops and eateries. The feel of it is in contrast to the rest of Singapore's wide tree-lined roads and relative calm.
The stalls sell all the usual cheap trinkets so it's not worth coming for that, but it is worth a visit just to wander around.
While in Chinatown make sure you visit the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple!"
,,Vibrant and a must visit!,4.0,,"Loved Chinatown! This is one of the best ones I have ever been. Vibrant, cheap, delicious food and a great experience! Good shopping there too!"
,,Place to eat and shop,5.0,,Chinatown is the place for great chinese food and markets. Within easy reach by the MRT and centrally located.
,,Easily accessible by MRT,4.0,,Great place to shop for first time Singapore visit. However all the stalls sell almost identical items.
,,Great place to eat and shop for souvenirs,5.0,,"Chinatown is a great place to eat local food especially at the indoor hawker centers. There is a street called ""food street"". There are some famous stalls at the hawker centers that sells out midday and the vendor just closes up shop until the next day. Great place to shop for souvenirs - e.g. Shopping bags with Singapore logo, chinese style clothing, greeting cards, jewelry- there are some nice jadite shops( expensive - so ask for a gem certificate if purchasing an expensive piece). Saw a stall with gorgeous lanterns but was a little pricy for me to buy one; besides, I had my eye on something else. Not a place to buy brand name goods. There are so many shopping complexes that look so much alike, I get lost trying to get back to the same place."
,,Vibrant,4.0,,Great lively place. One of the best Chinatowns I've been to. Good place for a cheap eat. And a market style shopping area
,,Convenience location,4.0,,I live in China town for this trip because of convenience location. There is a bar and food street nearby. Some of the restaurants opening until midnight. That's very good for me.
,,So disappointing,2.0,,"Having walked through Little India, I went on to Chinatown. Perhaps I didn't go to the more interesting parts but very little of it was of interest. Eating seemed to be the main pre-occupation within the area. It seemed something of an anti-climax and I felt as though I had wasted my time as a tourist."
,,Fun place to get gifts,5.0,,"good location, very friendly people, good to shop for gift items for relatives and friends, very intresting local food, especially if you are into non veg"
,,A look at Little India,4.0,,"We visited little India and went to the Mastufa Shopping mall,,what a place,,it is jammed pack with items for sale,,you can buy just about everything you need or want here,,if you can't find it, then it probably isn't available,,but worth the visit to check it out,,you never know what you might find there,,"
,,Place for oriental food lovers and souvenirs hunter,5.0,,"Lots of affordable chinese or oriental food. great place for culinary trip. and at the area, you can find many stores and stalls that sells souvenirs. mostly they have price tag on it, but if you have energy and keen enough, you can get cheaper price by bargaining. i spent hours here going around for souvenirs and food."
,,Nothing Different,2.0,,"Same China town as everywhere else. Nothing special. Only the Temple was worth seeing but Ladies be aware, you need to cover up."
,,It's Chinatown,3.0,,"My 1st impression of Chinatown - Singapore is ok. At first I thought it was like Chinatown in Chicago but it's just ok. If you want to buy lots of souvenirs, chinatown is the place to buy. They are cheap and nice too."
,,"Food, Massages,and Souvenirs",4.0,,"Vibrant, crowded and teeming with people around the world. Recent improvements have been made for the better providing concentration of like minded shops and services. We like to stay at the Scarlet Hotel on Erskine, just on block away.

Presently, there is a renovation at the Scarlet, so there is no restaurant for a couple more months."
,,One of the best Chinatowns in Asia,5.0,,"I have been there twice. First of all it is not as busy as many other ones in Asia. Secpnd, I loved souvenir shopping there and street food as well. Recommended!"
,,Not must to do or see,1.0,,Walked the streets and found that there was not anything different or unusual to see or buy in the area. I was a bit disappointed.
,,Typical Chinatown,4.0,,"The Chinatown area in Singapore located not really far from Clarke Quay. The area seems crowded like typical Chinatown and selling many cheap stuff. There is Buddhist temple nearby and also the place have outdoor food court area. Not forget to mention, there are many hostel here with affordable price."
,,Cheap cheap and cheap souvenir,4.0,,"If you visit singapore, you must visit here. Here you will find a lot of cheap souvenir for you carrying when go back yo your country. The best place for shopping of souvenir"
,,A colourful maze to be explored!,5.0,,"A very beautiful part of Singapore that shouldn't be missed! A warren of small shops selling artwork, china & chopsticks, suits, perfumes, you name it! There are a couple of interesting temples that you can walk around if you don't mind taking your shoes off and if you wander far enough and arrive early, you'll reach a huge food market that has at least 3 levels and sells just about everything. I enjoyed drinking from a fresh young coconut whilst watching a competitive chess tournament break out in one of the squares! Oh and prices are very good here, shop around and find a bargain! Perfume in particular was very cheap (more so than at duty free!)."
,,Good for cheap tourist gifts,4.0,,Plenty of stalls selling cheap tourist items. Also great food stalls with some great egg tarts in the bakeries. Recommend catching the MRT as station is right there.
,,The best Chilli Crab in Town,4.0,,"Grabbed a cab one night and headed off to China Town for dinner and do some last minute shopping. The place was heaving with Tourists and Locals alike, which is always a good sign when choosing a restaurant. And I was not disappointed. After buying the usual trinkets and Chinese paraphernalia as souvenirs to remember my visit. I found a sidewalk restaurant, pulled up a plastic chair and ordered a most delicious chilli-crab , garlic prawns and oysters all washed own by a bottle of Chile Chardonnay at a ridiculously cheap price based on Singapore standards. Cant remember the name of the restaurant but it was off to the left at the cross junction in Temple Stree. Well worth the visit if you can find the place."
,,One of the cleanest n organised Chinatown,5.0,,"Streets are all interlink ,roadside stalls are neatly and hygenically station for easy browsing or window shopping. Location so good and convenient to go elsewhere by train (mrt) local buses and taxis
Not to mention ..food glorious food every corners and streets.
You will be spoilt for choices. From as low as S$3 and sky is the limit"
,,Lot's of Fun - A Vibrant Community,4.0,,"Singapore's Chinatown is a fun and colorful place and a great lunch and shopping stop for inexpensive souvenirs. You can bargain with the hawkers and/or purchase some custom-made clothing. Stick around for lunch, you can try some authentic Chinese food or snacks."
,,"fun to visit, lots imteresting shops, food stalls and restaurants",4.0,,"worth 3 hours or so to explore, eat, drink and be happy. Nice shop houses of bygone era preserved. Well organized open areas for walking and food. some parts a bit touristy, but I like it. I will return to enjoy it"
,,Best neighborhood in Singapore,5.0,,"Chinatown is not known as a luxury destination like Marina Bay or the Orchard area, but it has its own irresistible charm. The possibilities here are endless: the variety of street food of Chinese heritage, local stores, Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and a mosque on Mosque Street, and also fine dining options with Italian and French restaurant if you desire a change. Bustling with people and action, Chinatown is a must-visit."
,,Must go,5.0,,"you will fine the gifts that you need to take home,good food, cheap beverage and a great atmosphere, it feels like asia, don't forget to get a foot massage, you will need it after all the walking go and visit Erick and Austrian Chef selling great Austrian sausages in Chinatown, close to the temple"
,,Must See Chinatown,5.0,,"If you go to Singapore and miss visiting Chinatown, then your just going to have to come back for a second visit.
There is a very good evening tour for first timers to China town, includes a great dinner at an authentic Chinese restaurant, a look at what's available in china town, heaps of places to buy that special gift, a ride in a Tri-Shaw and to finish off a Bum Boat ride from Clarke Quay down the river to Marina Bay and the Merlion, brilliant value and it really gives you a taste of the nightlife and what you want to go back and revisit."
,,Nothing like Hongkong or Kuala Lumpur Chinatown markets,2.0,,"Didn't find anything fascinating here, other than that some souvenir and Camera shops. The Clothing and other items are worthless and its better to shop at Bugis rather than killing time here.
The second street of Chinatown has food street with all different cuisines available. Surely visit and fill up there. Not worth a second visit!"
,,China Town Day Out,3.0,,It was my summer 2014 Vacation we went to China town @Singapore. Its a good place for some shopping and trying Chinese cuisine specially sea food where you can pick tour food among the live sea creatures like fishes crabs prawns. China Town offers you free internet for surfing also that's super cool.
,,Somewhat China. Cheap prices,4.0,,"Having lived in China for several years, thus somewhat comes close but (as anything away from its origin) is a copy adopted to Singaporean standards. You will find a lot of nick-nacks and souvenirs for cheap prices, even clothing can be surprisingly cheap for Singapore. Enjoy the stroll, eat done local food and have a sunny exploration day. Good to see, crowded like many Chinese places, worth a visit."
,,Shopping,4.0,,I love shopping in Chinatown in Singapore. You have to make time at least a day to glance threw all the vendors and spoil yourself with some items
,,"VERY Touristy... but for some reasons, I have feelings for this place...",4.0,,"Yes it's touristy... Yes it has many shops selling kitschy souvenirs... YES you get all wet when its raining... but for some reasons, I still love Chinatown. I would even live here if I have the money... Take a walk... shoot some nice pictures... laugh at kitschy stuff... is not a bad way to spend a free afternoon or evening. Just do some research and you will avoid tourists traps and have a good time. There are also landmarks dotted around Chinatown... from the Sri Mariamman Temple to the Santa Grand Lai Chun Yuen ""Chinese Opera"" hotel... Oh and don't forget to shoot a picture of the sign reading ""Street of the Dead"" at Sago Street. Don't worry it is not a spooky place... :)"
,,"Now it turned to a place only for tourists to buy small, reduntant souvenirs .",3.0,,"As if there is no Chinese people in Singapore that you have to go to Chinatown to feel the atmosphere? Probably the only thing positive about Chinatown is you can have everything in a small confined area. Other than that, there isn't any particularity that differs it from Chinatown in other countries. There is an Indian temple, a new Chinese temple with no particular historical value, unlimited shops selling tourists' souvenirs and lots of food. Many Chinese from China recently moved to Singapore to set up restaurants there and hence they serve authentic food from various provinces in China. There are however some delicious Chinese food that Singaporeans love in the food court in 2nd level of the complex. But you have to know which stall to go to."
,,Chaina in Singapore,4.0,,"In every big city you can find an area where you can have the flavor of China. Here you can have the testy Chinese foods, verities of dress and toys, jewelry and message center. China Town is a little China in Singapore. Just visit the area you may forget where are you. Peoples, foods, fruits, vegetable, shops, language all areas like China. Price is reasonable but you have to negotiate with the seller. Love to go and move there."
,,"Cheap foods, clothing and tradition building",4.0,,You can find good foods at the resonable price here. Street like 1960s of Singapore. Now is very difficult to find elsewhere in Singapore again.
,,Nice but small,4.0,,"Nice to visit, good food, has own MRT station, but small compared to other china towns i have visited e.g. London"
,,Chinatown at Singapore,2.0,,"Bit busy , and found some places to eat. But difficult to speak English . I must talk slowly to communicate with the people. Also bit difficult to get HALAL Food. Somehow .. it's good to know this area. If you need Chinese herbs here the place ... just write down what your pain and give to the shin she or Chinese doctor. Lucky if you can write in Chinese or shown them the translation from your device to make them well understood what you want to buy."
,,"Lots to see and eat, but small pricey rooms.",3.0,,"Good place to visit especially if you like colonial period Chinese buildings and numerous souvenirs (likely made in China). A lot of good food (though not the best for individual items) so walk around and find something new. If you want to stay here, make sure you are comfortable with room size and price (Singapore is generally pricey anyway). Try to ask for a quiet room especially on Fridays and Saturdays. Easy to access via MRT or bus or taxi."
,,Best place for souvenirs,4.0,,Chinatown is best place for tourists to buy souvenirs....many stalls to check around...reasonable price that wont burn a hole in yr pocket.chinatown complex has many food stalls for you to choose local cuisines if you can withstand the stuffiness.if not you may eat at chinatown food street in the open and pick from top selected stalls ..there are few bakua shops to pick from to buy famous bbq for tourists to bring home for loved ones too.traditional chinese herbal shops are there to let one catch a glimpse of old spore
,,Night time is the best time,4.0,,"Convenient for the hotels on the river and just a short walk away. A wonderful atmosphere of cheap local street food restaurants, coupled with better class restaurants aimed at the tourist. When were there it was decorated for Chinese New Year and everyone was out shopping for decorations. Absolutely loved it - great atmosphere."
,,Shop your Heart Out,5.0,,"Visit to China Town was a part of our 7 Day long trip to Singapore in 2012. And other than food and eateries I loved everything about it. The locals were courteous with plenty of roadside stalls selling Chinese wares at Throw away prices. A fantabulous place to pick up wonderful souvenirs for a travel back home after your vacation.

I for myself picked up plenty of Chinese stuffs and ended up spending only $50.00. This place should be a must visit on your itinerary if you are visiting Singapore. If you have fetish for Chinese food feel free to try the delicacies around else chose to stick to Mac D and the likes. If you ask my experience – It’s a must visit."
,,Strolling Singapore,4.0,,"Although this area is not that much impressing from an architecture point of view it offers what is typical in every Chinatown, namely souvenir shops, restaurantes, herbal stores. In addition, u can find here strolling around a rich mosaic of different nationalities and cultures."
,,"Good site, but I have seen better in London and U.S.",3.0,,"It's a good but very small. It ends before you know it. Very touristy! One can find quick souvenirs and other cheap magnets. The best part about this is the ""story of sago street"" and the Buddha temple."
,,"CHINA TOWN, SINGAPORE",4.0,,"In the yester years, when China was suffering from famines, floods......many Chinese from the Southern coastal towns (XIAMEN, GUANGZHOU,TEOCHEW......) sailed down to the SOUTH (NAN) OCEAN (YANG) hoping for a better life. They landed in Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaya (Singapore & Malaya were one country then). Sir Raffles created an area for the Chinese immigrants in the Southern Singapore. The living conditions were very poor. Chinese immigrants turned the area into gambling, gangster, prostitution and opium dens, There was no water supply in the area. Water has to be transported by bullock/ox cart to the area; hence the Malay road name ""Kreta (Bullock/ox cart) Ayer (water)"" and Chinese road name ""Bullock/Ox
Cart Water"". Both of the road names are still used by many locals. The area was named :""Chinatown"" in recent years for the benefits of tourists. The area has transformed into a hot tourist spot. Many gifts shop and restaurants mushroom; catering mainly for the tourists. The area also put on shows during THE CHINESE NEW YEAR and Autumn Moon Festivals. The area is best visited during the evening, as it is too hot during day."
,,Awesome,4.0,,"What a great way to spend an afternoon in Singapore. This place is an array of shops and restaurants. Food Street is a must as it has some wonderful restaurants. In addition to the restaurants, there are food carts that sell hawker style food. In addition to tasty cheap food, Chinatown is a great place to shop and buy souvenirs."
,,A little China for you,5.0,,"If you would like to taste the local specialities of Singapore, you have to come and see Chinatown. You can bargain and buy nice stuff for the homies at the market."
,,Too hectic,3.0,,"We popped into Chinatown a couple of times whilst staying in Singapore. We had just done a couple of weeks in Borneo in the middle of nowhere with relative peace and quiet. Chinatown brought us back down to earth and reality. At first it made a change to see lots of people and to be able to pop in and get a feed and a drink. But if you sit down and think about it you get to see it in a different light. There are many stalls but they seem to sell the same thing, all the restaurant staff are on your back to come in and have a drink or meal but once they have you seated and served the meal and the first drink they are hard to get hold of because they are badgering the next victim. At one place when the food arrived the waitress literally threw the plate of food onto the table. If it’s not on the menu they don’t have it. They hover over you before you have time to choose your food and then huff and puff when you ask them to come back in 5. Saying all that it’s not all that bad really. It was just a shock after the peace and serenity of the previous days. I couldn’t visit too many times though. It’s good for buying cheap trinkets and presents for back home and somewhere to eat and drink cheaply but that’s about it."
,,Excellent authetique Sechuan Restaurant,4.0,,"33 Mosque Street...thats all you need to know.....
Considered by the local crowd to be the BEST Sechuan cuisine.
Iron stomach a must, volcanic levels of spicyness
Sign outside only in Chinese but menu in English with reliable photos. Sign had the number 33 on it, thats your que.
We let the waitress bring us the chef's signature dishes. Highly recommend the frog in chillis signature dish - beatifully served, delicious and challenging.

ENJOY!"
,,"Bussling and busy, full of character.",5.0,,Come out of the MRT into Pagoda street and walk down and around. Exciting and full of colour. On the edge of China Town are both a Buddist temple and a Hindu temple both well worth a visit. If you catch the fire walking even better. China Town is a must for all visitors.
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"If visitin SIngapore, a visit to Chinatown is a must. There is a plethora of cheap trinkets to buy and staff are not pushy or pestoring. Be aware that it is normally hot and humid so a hat and water are essential. There are many eating places and they serve the coldest Tiger in town. Oldies, be careful of the roads, pavements and step downs. Easy to fall if not careful. An experience not to miss."
,,"Choices, choices, choices",5.0,,"Just like any Chinatown from around the world. Lots of food, lots of shopping, lots of temples. All of it amazing and delicious. Great way to have some variety and escape the normal Singapore tourist areas."
,,A taste of the old Singapore,5.0,,"This is as close to what i remember as a very young sailor in the 1960s, somuch has changed,but along with Chinatown,you might like little India,Arab Street,and if the bud, get allows high tea at the oldest hotel in town,step back in time. ."
,,A good place to visit,4.0,,"While you're in Spore, pay a visit to Chinatown area! You'll get lots of interesting spots to visit: Sri Mariamman Temple, Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, Singapore City Gallery, Red Dot Design Museum, and Tintin Shop for you Tintin lovers! They're only some highlights of Chinatown, but once you stroll along road by road (and alleys) maybe you'll find your own ""gems"" here, and of course.. hundreds of shops! Don't forget to spoil your tummy at Chinatown Food Street and Maxwell Food Centre for culinary experience like I did. Chinatown is easily accessible by any public transport, but personally I recommend MRT as the station has direct exit to Pagoda Street (one of the famous street at Chinatown). Approx. 2 or 3 hours will be enough for fast browsing, but I spent moooore at the end.. Enjoy!"
,,Souvenir and eateries,4.0,,"Here you can find souvenirs and eateries everywhere.. Affordable prices.. Suits well with semi-backpacking traveler like me.. Try to go here in the evening, you can get a photo with lampions for the background.."
,,China town good value for shoppers !,5.0,,"Every tip to Singapore I make it a point to visit chinatown. It's a v interesting place to shop look around the small shops which are full of handicrafts. Bright and colorful chinese stuff to take back home and give it as souvenirs at a bargain price ! V affordable . It's quality controlled which was a pleasure to see. Chinese colorful pouches ( 4 for 10$) wow where can we get such a barging with intricate designs ! Everything was priced in the same style. Clothes with batik for holiday makers use it while you are there , take it back home or chuck it if you have had enough! I shopped bags full!"
,,Fun shopping days,5.0,,"Don't buy any little gifts to bring back until you go to Chinatown. Chinatown is clean, safe and fun to walk around. The hawker center on Smith St is graded (A through C), be sure to eat at A stands if you are a visitor. MRT station will bring you right to the middle of the marketplace! Don't forget your camera!"
,,Should do for the experience,4.0,,"Definitely worth while to experience the markets, food, culture and history. Easy to get to and easy walking. People friendly and be prepared to haggle on the prices!"
,,Markets galore,4.0,,"Chinatown is a must do when you go to Singapore, allow plenty of time to stroll around the markets/shops/eateries. most of it is out in the open though so be prepared for the heat."
,,overrated,3.0,,"This old section is overrated. One street sells mostly trinkets. A few old buildings survive, but the overall feeling of a community apart isn't there."
,,Very atmospheric,4.0,,"The good was pretty amazing but not cheap! We had one crab between us as it was $54 and only for lunch, pretty good though. We didn't feel hassled at all and the things we bought, other than the crab, was reasonably priced. It was very busy but full of atmosphere."
,,Lots to see,5.0,,"Chinatown is a vibrant, colourful and busy place with lots of shops and places to eat. From the Chinatown MRT station take the Pagoda Street exit and you come up into the heart of Chinatown. This street has many restored shophouses. There are temples, mosques and Hindu temples close by and a visitors centre as well."
,,Great place for cheap food,5.0,,This place is great for a bargain and a great place for cheap food. This is where you should buy your chicken rice from as it's cheap and also the best we found in Singapore
,,"A vibrant and interesting section of ""Old Singapore""",5.0,,"There is only a small area of the old China Town remaining in Singapore (about seven streets covering about four city blocks). The old buildings and streets (decorated accordingly), remain as a reminder of Singapore's past. Numerous traders still fill these vibrant streets as the area offers numerous Asian food outlets, tailors, the usual tourist fare of gift shops and a number of specialist Chinese arts and supplies. One street is entirely devoted to a variety of Asian restaurants and street stalls selling a vast variety of meals including the locally famous chicken rice and chilli crabs. I am convinced that the buyer needs to be wary in this tourist spot as the cheapest prices and best product will not always be found here. (One restaurant inflated their bill by a few dollars by not disclosing all costs in their menu). A number of points of interest for the tourist are in the vicinity and can be located on the many tourist maps available through several tourist information booths available in China Town. Nearby these seven streets of old China Town are a number of city blocks of the newer China Town with businesses offering a range of Asian products and their prices are competitive. (I saw fewer ""Westerners"" here). There is so much to see and do in this area of Singapore that the tourist should allow a number of hours in their itinerary. Accessing the China Town area is easy by bus or the MRT. (Public transport costs are very reasonable and the tourist could avoid the expensive cost of tours and tourist hop on and off buses with a little effort). There is also a free bus operating hourly to and from the Great World City Shopping Centre."
,,"A riot of sounds, colors, and flavorful aromas",5.0,,"Singapore's Chinatown is a cacophony of different flavors, colors, and sounds, but in a good way. It is kept amazingly clean, and given the Singaporean obsession with cleanliness, that is a good thing. I purchased several souvenirs for folks back home for under $20 USD, and they were every bit as high quality as the more expensive items seen in the larger shops. There are also several food stalls here serving various Chinese regional as well as other cuisines. If I had been able to fit it, I might have had one of the tailors there make me a suit! You can't go wrong in Singapore's Chinatown."
,,Chinatown a must to see,5.0,,"Chinatown is a fantastic place to visit.

So much history of ear.y times in Singapore .

Should you want to do a tour try Singapore walking tours which are cheap and very informative.

If you are around Smith street there is great food and entertainment to be had.

Shopping for those quirky Chinese items is a must."
,,"Shop, shop, shop",4.0,,"Only place in Singapore for pocket friendly stuff. Buy souvenirs, t shirt, accessories, paper lampshades, paper fans, handbags n other stuff at affordable rates. Try shakes n juices once tired from all shopping. Can reach there by metro too."
,,Chinatown.,5.0,,"I must have spent hours and hours in Chinatown. This place has everything that all travellers require, in relation to souvenirs. There is also amazing, and delicious street food, that is to die for. Beautiful fresh fruit juices. All travellers, get amongst Chinatown, you will all really enjoy yourselves. I have been to Singapore, twice in 2 months and Chinatown is one of my favourite places to visit."
,,A memorable past and a dynamically changing landscape,4.0,,"Chinatown occupies a common place in the hearts of many Singaporeans that we tend to take it for granted and treat it just like any common casual place to shop and eat.

Yet, for me, this place invokes many old memories but the landscape is dynamically changing fast that I am really worried that one day when I re-visited this place I could no longer recognize the familiar features that I once used to see her.

The Criminal Investigation Department was once housed at that blue colonial building at Eu Tong Seng Street. A decade back, it had moved to the modern sophisticated looking Police Cantonment Complex and the former Eu Tong Seng building is now converted into a student hostel and I could no longer find the blue paint that once colored the old Police building. The sentry post that was once a familiar sight as you walked past the building had long been demolished and I wondered if the CID lock-ups that once detained the most wanted and notorious criminals for criminal investigation in Singapore had been converted into a comfortable and air-conditioned student dormitory.

I remember the old Police quarters behind this building where I used to visit some of my Police friends but now those quarters had long been demolished and gone. I remember those days the Attorney General Chambers office was located at Adelphi Building but it has now shifted over to Chinatown and is beside and overseeing Hong Lim Park.

There is now a national library within Chinatown Point and is packed with readers. There are so many books on China and I recently attended a book review talk at the library crowded with many Chinese readers. It was spectacular and there was an exhibition on Dr Sun Yat Sen in the library. I thought I was in a library in Shanghai or Beijing and was marveled by the many Chinese readers. The library resembles more like a Chinese cultural center with the many Chinese books.

I remember I used to visit Pin MIn Medical Hall in Chinatown for consultation and purchase some herbs. The TCM shop is still there and located just beside the food center. The herbs here sold here are said to be reasonably priced and I still met the courteous and friendly owner and his daughters and wife at the counter but the whole hall has since renovated with a modern pharmacy look and totally different from the old TCM medical hall marked with those `antique' characteristics.

The whole street of Keong Saik Road has also changed dramatically with more pubs and lounges and eaterieries. Other than the Hindu temple at the corner of the road junction I could hardly recognize her original identity.

Dorsett Hotel building that now occupies the prime location opposite the Police Cantonment Complex was a new injection into the landscape of Chinatown.

It is changing dramatically and it is going to be a great dynamic change in the landscape. With an increasing influx of tourists from China and the soon opening of the North South line, the landscape in Chinatown would dynamically change.

I really wonder if I could still retain my old memories of this place when the old buildings give way to new ones."
,,Get off the beaten track Chinna Town Singapore,4.0,,"To see & experience the real China Town you need to get off the well worn tourist track & delv into where the locals eat & shop. Perfectly safe Singapore still offers some great bargins if you get away from Orchard road and the major centres. Massages are common and well worth having different from a resort massage these are the real thing.
Wander through the fresh food markets for an experience & marvel @ the array of produce available. Retailers don't mind haggling if they don't they will soon let you know."
,,Best place for cheap souvenirs & local tasty food...,4.0,,"Chinatown is a must visit place. It is easily accessible by MRT & buses.

Beautifully conserved buildings/ architectures, modern shopping malls amidst many street shops & stalls selling local delicacies, food & souvenirs.
There is a Hindu & a Buddhist temple as well.

Chinatown is the best place for:

1. Cheap & wide, beautiful varieties of souvenirs. Probably the cheapest souvenirs can be found here. And an amazing huge range too. But remember to shop around before you buy souvenirs as not all prices are the same in every stall or shops.

2. Cheap/reasonable & authentic local food. There is an open food street in Smith Street serving local food. On the same street, there is a huge food centre on 2nd floor of Chinatown Complex. Here you can find very good local food, wide varieties and many nice food - at cheap prices. There are also many shops on 1st floor selling clothes, shoes, accessories, etc.

If you want modern malls, there is Chinatown Point & OG Department Store. For a mix of local & cultural products, go to People's Park Complex & People's Park Centre. For really authentic Chinese products/delicacies & food, go to the many street shops & stalls."
,,Worth time visit.,4.0,,"Especially, for the non-Asain. You will see many interesting shops and stuff. In my opinion, I used to see stuff like this in my country. Anyway, I recommend this place for either visiting or shopping."
,,Nice,4.0,,A nice area of the city where there are a lot of tourists. One of the places to visit from the airport's free Singapore tour.
,,A great safe place to get bargains,5.0,,We shopped here for a while. Bought a beautiful dress for $100. Price started at $250 but we were persistent.
,,It's worth visiting,5.0,,"Been to a lot of ""Chinatowns"". I thought the Chinatown in San Francisco was clean, this Chinatown is definitely a lot cleaner. There's a lot of restaurants. It actually gets overwhelming because you just want to keep on eating but your stomach is saying ""stop"" lol. Thank goodness there are tons of shops so you get to walk off all those calories (well at least some of it :). It's so safe there and you just have that feeling you can go anywhere. Plus the best part is, you can practice your haggling skills with the vendors. Definitely worth visiting."
,,Great little tourist spot,4.0,,"Great litre market place to buy nick nacks and souvenirs. Be prepared to be hassled and dragged into shops and stalls but barter hard, stick to your guns and hold onto your cash until you are prepared to hand it over. The older section of the market has some hidden treasures to be found.

Food market is great. Food is cooked fresh and the beer is cold."
,,Colorful,5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is beautiful…much better than in San Francisco and bigger. When you exit dark MTR stop and emerge from the underground you are hit with colors, smells and sounds! This is the best place to shop for souvenirs and the cheapest."
,,Nice,4.0,,"Great food from the stalls in the evening, great atmosphere during the day. Just be prepared to say no a lot to the tailors and guys at the camera stores"
,,Something for everyone,4.0,,"Could spend hours there, and went back several times. The trishaws were great fun, cheap souvenirs and amazing variety of food. Chinese medicine shops are very interesting, as are the people. Grab a tour and get full value for money"
,,"A different place to visit, in a positive way",4.0,,"It is completely different from a Chinatown in any other city for two reasons:
1 - it actual seems safe, not dodgy
2 - For some reason they don't sell a lot of Chinese things

This part of town has a very nice atmosphere, good food and apparently a lot of tailors that harass you with their special prices.. Fun place!"
,,Fantastic place for the adventurous foodie,5.0,,Not huge but good enough to spend a whole day walking around and exploring. We love the food stalls both inside and out. You can get a free walking tour and tip what you like or simply explore on your own.
,,Food galore,5.0,,A must if you're heading into Singapore. Come during the early evening to get the most out of the stores and cooler weather. It sparkles as the sun goes down. The Food Street should be your number one spot to hit. Ignore the indoor restaurants and try one of the carts. Mmmm!
,,Another place for shopping,4.0,,"Another places for shopping. Not really a ""Chinatown"" like in other countries where there's so many original Chinese stuff. I know most travellers / tourist like to get souvenirs from this area."
,,Fantastic - as it ever was,5.0,,"If you've not been to Chinatown before, it might be a shock. Bustling, noisy - shops, stalls and restaurants with stunning architecture all crammed together and alongside Hindu and Buddhist temples. An amazing place where bargains can certainly be found - don't be afraid to haggle. Clothing, electronics, medicines, jewellery, toys, housewares and tourist bits and bobs are all here. It is possible to take a nighttime tour, with a trishaw ride and a guided walk, including dinner and a boat ride around the harbour - this is a great introduction to the magic of Chinatown. It is a slightly crazy place, but we loved it."
,,New old Chinatown,4.0,,"Original Chinatown was like most Chinatowns in other countries, messy, dirty and disorganised. With the government efforts, this place is now beautiful, buildings refurnished to look new but still retain their originality and streets paved with tiles with shops and stalls along both sides of the streets. Sell almost everything: clothing, shoes, watches, accessories, souvenirs, etc. Also, cafes and restaurants. Best time to visit is January which is pre-Chinese New Year period when the place is decorated with lanterns and other decorations."
,,beautiful place,4.0,,"i like to come hewe again sometimes, becose there is a chinatown market that always crowded by the visitor.
and also there is a food street along the alley. the price in chinatown market is also cheaper than the other place.
very recomended if u want to buy some of souvenir from Singapore."
,,More than meets the eye,4.0,,The usual tourist tat is here in Temple Street but delve deeper into her streets - look in the TCM shops at the wild and interesting medicines on display; go to Club Street and look at the beautiful tiled exteriors of the shop houses. There is more here than meets the eye.
,,Chinatown & Ann Siang Hill,4.0,,Lovely original Singapore buildings and plenty of places to eat. Take the short walk as well to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple then cross the road towards Ann Siang Hill to Club Street where there are plenty of restuarants and bars (they close the street off at night).
,,end of cruise,5.0,,what a great place to visit lots of stalls selling everything we purchased temple lanterns here the only place we could find them on our travels lots of food places going back here end of this year
,,Colorful...Joyful...,4.0,,"This was the first place I visited after landing Singapore. Full of colorful lamps, great shopping options especially souvenirs and not to forget the juice corners- they serve some of the best fresh fruit juices..."
,,Busy place,4.0,,Chinatown with its markets is an interesting and busy place. You cab buy and eat almost everything there. Only neg. point: the markets in Chinatown open late and close early.
,,Great food and good place to visit during the night,4.0,,"You can probably take better photos in the morning but walking along China town will be similar to a sauna experience.

The night scene is vibrant here. You get probably one of the best rate in foreign exchange (just go for the one with the longest queue)

The food centre (a 3 storey building) has lots of nice and authentic Singaporean food that is friendly to your budget. $10 per pax is more than enough for a hearty meal. Highly recommended food are the clay pot rice ( but do note you may have to wait up to 45mins to be served) the seafood stalls serving up many types of dishes and also simple food like fish all noodles and chicken rice."
,,In love with this part of Singapore!,5.0,,"It was recommended that we book accommodation in Chinatown for a short stay in Singapore....absolutely loved it! Most hotels are in close proximity to food stalls, markets, restaurants and other Chinese stores...cheaper than the rest of Singapore as well. We had an awesome night of karaoke at the Cow&Coolie with the locals - they were so welcoming and great fun to party with. Marine Bay and Orchard Road are not far away, an easy bus or MRT ride. I highly recommend to stay here, otherwise this is a great stopover for a bit of shopping, massage and lunch at the food street."
,,Great food :-),4.0,,"Great for food, shopping and souvenir shopping. Hubby and i had our best meals down in chinatowns little alley way in pagoda st :-)"
,,Enjoy eating after day,3.0,,"This area is good for shoping and eating. I went to find some resturant for dinner. Its was my long day then I found that I got real relax with easy resturant, Easy drink, Easy food and cheap."
,,Sunny Chinatown,4.0,,"Lots of stalls that sell the same goods but it was cheap. Lots of great food there, hor fun, dim sum and etc. The old heritage building was great looking."
,,"Tantalizing sights, food, stalls, and people",4.0,,"Ohh I loved it. I caught a taxi from my hotel and browsed so many food venues where do I pick? I found a corner budget food area with red chairs and many westerners eating and settled down to noodles around $12.00
I bought several trinkets to take home and wanted to go back again but ran out of time
Take cash and smaller notes"
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"Busy streets, lots of stalls who sell the same cheap mediocre quality stuff. Did not dare to eat in the neighborhood. Nice for an afternoon stroll though and some people watching."
,,Cheap Gift Shopping,4.0,,"This is the place to go for all you cheap goods, the goods are however generally the same and of poor quality but there is quite a lot of variety if you take your time to look around.

When you're done shopping make sure you try some of the local chinese food!"
,,Great food,4.0,,"The food is great in china town and you can find almost everything you want, there are some old heritage buildings as well, but I mainly come for the food. There are also some budget and boutique hotels there you can stay at"
,,Culture,5.0,,I have had a few experiences of Chinatowns...but Singapore has the most exciting and historic Chinatown anywhere in world. The temples and fusion of cultures is amazing and the history of how the early Chinese settled in Singapore....fantastic
,,Lots of variety at a good price!,4.0,,"We enjoyed our discovery tour of China town yesterday. It's much bigger than anticipated and it goes on and on. We bought our vegetables there as they are cheap! Lots and lots of shops, jewellery, cameras, watches etc.... There is an open hawker centre but we opted not to eat lunch there, too hot and too many people! There are trinkets souvenirs to buy. We will come back for a second look."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"The name says it all !!! You can find 7/11 stores, bars, restaurants & various types of shops and stalls."
,,"great food, shopping and attractions",5.0,,"we caught the MRT to chinatown - very easy, cheap and fun - and you come out right in the middle of Chinatown. we had lunch at the food hall at a shopping comlex - delish and cheap. went shopping - lots of bargains and so much to see. went sightseeing - there is the gorgeous kitschy Hindu temple and the reverent interesting and beautiful Buddha tooth relic museum and pagoda with a lovey gardens on the top roof. strolled around the area and had drinks in a cool and funky bar along one of the lane ways. only spent one day there but cant wait to go back to Singapore and Chinatown again. i still have a lot to explore there."
,,good food nice place,5.0,,excellent experience in Chinatown. The food is fantastic and the price so cheap. the street is clean. The local people are very friendly and helpful. Love this place and will spend time longer on my next trip to Singapore.
,,"Not so sure about ""China"" town",4.0,,"If you have never been to the real China, then you might be impressed. You could think that what you are seeing is authentically Chinese, Singapore being mainly Chinese anyway. In reality, you are seeing a South East Asian tourist precinct with the usual lap sap souvenir shops ("" I love Singapore"" tea shirts, caps and key rings - you get the picture), restaurants, cafes and so on. Unfortunately, the locals' taste for durian is inescapable, as your nose will testify.

What is good is the old architecture, particularly shop houses built a century ago which have been well (some may say overly) preserved. I am not sure about some of the garish colours used, but at least they add a bit of character to the area.

Don't spend too long in Singapore's Chinatown; half an hour at the most should be sufficient."
,,"Authentic, Colorful",4.0,,"Chinatown is very vibrant and buzzing. Full of everything you love about Chinatown. The sites, street foods, temples and most of all shopping. Very easy to get to using the MRT. Its probably the cleanest Chinatown in the whole world. You can visit the Buddha Tooth Tekic Temple and Museum, have lunch at Maxwell Food Center, visit the Hindu Sri Mariamman Temple. After looking around, you can get a quick massage."
,,An interesting part of 'Old Singapore'.,4.0,,"Although now a prime tourist attraction - with all the attendant hype - it still has a lot of old buildings worth seeing that show what Singapore was like in the 'old days'.
If you want to get an idea of how Singapore has been so amazingly transformed in the past 40 years or so you should certainly visit this area.
At the end of your visit you can round it off with a meal at Maxwell Road Hawker Centre which is nearby."
,,Sterilized Chinatown,3.0,,Like many attractions in Singapore Chinatown is a little overly sterilized for my taste. That said we still visit every time we come. If you are looking for cheap souvenirs this is probably the place for you. The food street has a few gems yet certainly lacking the soul you find in many other Chinatowns. For the adventurous try the century old egg!
,,Chinatown go for the food!,4.0,,"A great foodie adventure, lots of choices like chilli crab, cute little bakeries and just grilled delicious everything! Take your time go for a walk through the marketplace. Ignore all the cheap junky tourist merch and head to a local restaurant instead. There is a main hawker centre nearby and has a wet and fruit and veggie market on the ground floor and cheap hawker food on the upper floors. Right next to the MRT station ."
,,China n more..,5.0,,"Even tho its named Chinatown, u hav everything down here.. Streets upon streets are lined with tourist shops, ornaments, chinese herbs n medicines n everytin u can think off..
It's like a maze of shops..
Good food is avail at every turn..
Jus b prepared to walk.."
,,A bit too touristy for me,3.0,,"Chinatown is reasonably interesting, but a bit to touristy for me. There are some lovely heritage buildings there, but it just doesn't feel like genuine Chinatown. I did find a good restaurant out of the main tourist precinct though, so my advice is visit Chinatown, but explore around its edges."
,,Neat atmosphere,4.0,,Fantastic hustle and bustle area. Great cheap reflexology foot massages. Great food and atmosphere. Also good place to try durian in many forms.
,,Clean Chinatown,3.0,,A vibrant place teeming with restaurants that offer a variety of cuisines at affordable prices. This is probably the cleanest Chinatown I have seen. There are plenty of stalls that sell cheap items from souvenirs to personal stuff that don't look durable. Just make sure to conduct yourself with restraint since you might end up buying loads of useless thingies just because they come so cheap.
,,"Shopping, Food and Sightseeing",5.0,,"Chinatown is a great place for those who loves Chinese food , Chinese artefacts and souvenirs. It has the traditional Chinese cuisine. Bak Ku The (Pork Rib Soup) at Song Fa Restaurant is great and in operation since 1969.It started off with humble beginnings, pushcart kiosk by the roadside, from the now defunct Johor Road at the present Bugis MRT. Today Song Fa has got 5 outlets (http://www.songfa.com.sg/outlets.html) reminiscing the oldies feeling and taste. Chinatown also has it fair share of tourist sightseeing spots like temples, mosque, churches, Ann Siang Hill and lots more. People's Park is a good place for shopping for cheap and branded products. Lots of food courts too. Easily accessible by 2 MRT stations and lots of buses. A number of backpackers to 5 star hotels in this area. This is the place for Chinese Food, Artefacts and Souvenirs. Never to be missed."
,,"Nothing Chinese about this China Town, except food hawkers recenlty arrived from China",1.0,,"What used to be a vibrant China Town has been modernised and sanitised out of existence. Traditional trades are all gone, pushed out by sky-rocketing rents. Souvenir shops sell cheap made-in-China only the most gullible of tourists would buy. Save your time for elsewhere"
,,nice,3.0,,On our excursion we past Chinatown and it is allways nice to visit Chinatown in a place. WE were during daytimes but often it is in evening nicer to visit Chinatown
,,Overrated,1.0,,Very Cheap tourist crap items very over priced. Same items you can buy at any local Asian market back in your home town
,,South Asian Ambience.,4.0,,"This place has lot of shopping shops and malls. All around can see a Chinese culture and packaging. It is good place to spend an evening there. Regards, Vishal"
,,Chinatown Complex,4.0,,"The Chinatown Compleax is a multi storey market right in the heart of Chinatown in Sago Lane. The basement incudes a wet market with fish, meat vegetables and fruit for sale. Level onwe is a series of stalls selling mostly clothing. Level 2 is where the real surprise is; here is a medium sized food cout full of Hawker stalls here.

My wife and I am experienced travellers and not averse to sampling street food wherever in the world we may be. I was pleasantly surprised at the range and quality of fare on offer. We sampled Hainan Chicken Rice, for $4.00 was a bargain, which was as good as any we have tried and a platter of Satay. At $0.40 each this was also a bargain. All of this was washed down by a very tasty Sugar Cane juice at a whopping $1.60.

Please do not be put off by the prices. We had a tremendous flavourful lunch for under $10. I recommend this place."
,,It was nice bazar.,4.0,,"It was funny nice bazar with Chinese and also some Indian thing and costumes, full of wanders if you like to explore and find some souvenirs and it is near hindu and famous Budda temples. It is 2-4 hours activity."
,,Buyers Market and food haven.,4.0,,Going to Chinatown for souvenirs hunting is always a good reason; you will always be successful and you may even buy too many items. Food is also very good and there are many choices to make. Many restaurants to choose from. Within walking distance are also interesting temples to see.
,,Singapore China town,4.0,,"one of the best places to experience the 'real'Singapore..the lifstyle of the locals I love it..shopping, eating and entertainment as well as great night life ..and a safe place to be.."
,,Loved loved loved Chinatown,5.0,,"Great , cheap souvenir shopping Awesome, cheapish food Old architecture (look up) Fantastic people watching Grumpy vendors though ! A must."
,,SEE AND ENJOY,3.0,,"A nce place to look around o see nice building and of course if you like to buy anything to bring to friend, the Food there is also very nice and good with good prices in the Food street in the middle of the market and of course the Budhaa temple that also there,"
,,Love it if a little noisy,4.0,,"We are currently staying on Temple street and I can safely say that Chinatown is my favourite part of Singapore. It has so much character unlike the more built up areas. It's perfect for souvenir shopping and dig deep into the stalls for some beautiful handbags and jewellery!
The only downside is that it is incredibly noisy from around 9am - 2am.. Not great when you're staying the mix of it but I guess that's the hotels problem with the lack of double glazing!"
,,Little China,5.0,,Like being in China. Very special feeling and lots of things to look at. Strange to see the high towers all around and feeling like you walk in a small village.
,,Souvenir Hunting,4.0,,"Visited China Town on 01/12/2014. Brightly lit with colourful lanterns and bulbs the neatly maintained ground plus three story buildings were wonderful to watch. Street food, clothes for all ages, souvenirs of different items and sizes representing Singapore are available. One can also bargain in this market.

We picked up Selfie Sticks at SGD 10 each which were being sold at other places for SGD 20 each. Picked up a few Singapore Tees and other souvenirs for friends back home.

Also bought packed jack fruits and bananas for dinner."
,,Take a look at Chinatown,4.0,,Great place to visit and wander through the streets. Heaps of stalls to peruse and some really good bargains especially if you want some cheap souvenirs to take home. Take a look at the temple and walk up the road to the hawker food stalls for a taste of the local food and drink.
,,Poor and far too touristy,2.0,,Came here for a bit of culture was was sorely disappointed. It was just stalls full of trinkets to sell and not much to do with actual Chinese culture. We tried to bargain with some of the vendors for a price as you do at a market and one Chinese woman actually swore at us in Chinese and we had to leave the shop she was so aggressive. Do not bother with this part of town.
,,We had a great time there,5.0,,On our visit of Singapore we lived there with two friends. Place is really nice with lots of shops and restaurants.
,,Colourful,4.0,,"An area, that you do not have to skip while in Singapore. You will find there a large number of little booths selling cheap souvenirs, cloths, many eateries, mysterious medicine shops. Nice heritage buildings everywhere. Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum and the Hindu Sri Mariamman temple are located here. Lots of tourists and visitors around. Very vibrant atmosphere. Easy accessible by MRT."
,,Twice (Day & Night),5.0,,"We visited Chinatown twice; and would be happy to go again if we had time. Will go again next time we are in Singapore. Once at night for a nice slow wander before going for a very nice meal at ""Yum Cha"" and another during the late morning that was a little more rushed. Really enjoyable seeing what was available. The ""sell"" wasn't at all hard, the traders ""tried it on"" but most were happy to let you go when you said ""No"". An enjoyable experience when compared to the Cartagena (South American) ""shopkeepers""!!"
,,Not what it used to be,2.0,,My wife and i went during the day and a lot of the shops and restaurants were closed except for the street markets we were there several years ago and it was great however it might be different at night time suggestion go at night
,,"Cultural experience, if you must...",2.0,,"If you want the cultural ""china town"" experience in true Asian-style, then take the time for this one. But be aware that it is a rather seedy part of Singapore, dirty, overly crowded, and generally unpleasant shopping. That said, one thing you may appreciate is that Singapore does not allow the shop owners to stand outside their shop and ""hawk"" (call out and try to entice you to buy). You can attempt to discuss lower prices, but they are reluctant to budge with tourists, especially Americans. If you need budget shopping and souvenirs, you may enjoy a stop here. We were there in the evening and the sidewalk cafes were so crowded we went elsewhere for eats. Lack of restrooms and other convenience are also an issue here."
,,Interesting!,5.0,,We went for dinner here. The food was great - we didn't go for any of the frog dishes though! We stuck to chicken and prawns! Really great atmosphere here too.
,,Good place for buying souvenirs,3.0,,"China town is a colourful and crowded place. You will find a huge collection of souvenirs, bags, t-shirts etc. But be careful, some of the stuff is real cheap quality. One of the bags which we bought tore on the very next day. I guess, you get what you pay for !

Most of the usual souvenirs (key chains/ fridge magnets etc) which you will find in other tourist places, you will get here in a much cheaper price. We also bought a few nice looking chop sticks and a couple of pretty batik printed umbrellas. Overall a nice place to do some budget shopping. But it is not a must see, you can skip if it if you don't have much time."
,,Not to be missed,4.0,,The place is a bit touristic but it is very nice and with a lot of activities. There is a big market selling a bit of everything most of it most probably counterfeit stuff and as well is perfect for the famous Singapore street food.
,,Visit to chinatown,5.0,,"Plenty of F&B hawker stores and shops. They are also near a few shopping centers. The only trouble I can't find any toilet here thus having to walk to a shopping mall.
It is also a place where you will some prostitutes from China (approach by a not so young) but of course reject and ignore.
Overall it is a nice place to try not only local Singapore food but that from China."
,,A great place to go,4.0,,"Most of the tourist buses will stop in Chinatown where you can look at the temples, amble down food street (quiet when we were there mid morning) or shop for presents. The prices seemed very reasonable and we spent quite a lot on various cheap items. I would be wary about buying higher priced items as, unless you are an expert, you could land up with a cheap copy at a high price. We looked at some painted bottles, listed at S$150.00 - we had bought something very similar in Beijing for the equivalent of S$20.00. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Old Glory,4.0,,"Chinatown is a heritage area. It comprises five districts: You will find In Telok Ayer Old temples and mosques; in Bukit pasoh nice hotels and restaurants with old houses as well, in Tanjong Pagar, residential apartments, commercial buildings and nightspots. In Kreta Ayer traditional trades good hawker food around. In Ann Siang Hill area shops and cafes.

Enjoy Trisha ride here. In some areas you get free wi-fi. See Lion Dance every Saturday at Pagoda Street. Take Walking tours from china town visitor centre.

Reach there mostly on Saturdays. Take MRT for China Town Station. There is no fee if you go around on your own. Will have to pay for taking official walking tours, trisha ride etc."
,,Chinese Wonderland of street food! Foodies' haven!,4.0,,"Many Chinese and Disney's style of colonial buildings; market store selling gifts; hawkers' stores selling food street where we could purchase food. There were two temples, a Buddhist and Hindu which had been built and designed with great many traditional features. Like many tourists I took many photos of various landmarks in Chinatown. I also visited their tourist information centre and learned lots about the history of the place.

I enjoyed walking around and taking photos of the lively streets."
,,Shop around,4.0,,Chinatown is good for tourists looking to pick up souvenirs and other small useful things. Most of the things here are cheap and you can spend couple of hrs shopping and eating.
,,Loved it,5.0,,"We stayed just two streets away from Chinatown at the Bliss hotel so we visited Chinatown many times during our stay as it was so cheap to eat there and buy lots of goodies. We loved the street food. Loved eating under chinese lit up lanterns, grabbing a table, getting some ice cold ice tea and exploring the many food choices from the food carts they have. All freshly made all amazingly delicious and so cheap. We ate with two small children and always found something that they ate too. Roasted chicken and rice or duck and rice were a favourite. We got dessert there too, shaved icecream with all the toppings, delicious. There was such a great atmosphere, we really loved it. Shopping is so cheap. We went to Buggis street one day and we left to come back to Chinatown as there is much more to choose from and cheaper too. Like 36 keyrings for $10 or 4 bags for $10 or $1 magnets or 4 souvenirs for $10 or 3 necklaces for $8 or 4 purses for $8 or 4 brcelets for $10. Dresses for $10 each and much more i could go on. It can get busy and crowded especially in the evening but each time we went we had a stroller and even with the stroller we could get through so its not all that bad. I recommend this place to everyone. Its a wonderful place with wonderful food and so much to explore. Lots of things are more than they seem so explore, ask and have fun. Some of the jewellery we were suprised to hear what they are made from and how many hours it takes by hand to carve each symbol etc. Lovely place indeed"
,,Not a must seen attraction,2.0,,Few streets with cheap shops with lot of stuff you do not need. If you have limited time I suggest to skip this place
,,I had a day to explore before business,5.0,,"I wanted to do a little exploration around town before work. I liked it all! Architecture, shops, markets, people and Food! The Buddhist and Hindu temples are Amazing!! I had lunch in the Market. There is probably 100 food booths with every kind of Asian food you could taste and inexpensive! A word seldom heard in Singapore."
,,Eastern magic,4.0,,A must place to visit with a vast variety of stall selling just about everything imaginable. Some sellers were a bit over zealous but good for a bit of banter.My partner bought several dresses and souvenirs at good prices.
,,Sensory blowout!,5.0,,"You need a day for this, from walking the narrow hot markets, to the magical pergodas, it's truly amazing. Easy to get to via MRT. Try the food at Maxwell St hawker market - just join the longest queue for the best food. Buy a silk suit? The choice is yours. It gets hot here!"
,,Nice architecture,4.0,,Buildings and shops all around. Good architecture. A tooth relic monastery and a hindu temple are famous here.
,,Give this a miss,2.0,,If time is short in Singapore then give China Town a miss. There was nothing here that I even wanted to consider buying and the lunch I had (seafood fried rice) was very poor. Much better places to spend time.
,,Safe walking alone,5.0,,"There are many arcades and malls with shops selling food, clothing, souvenirs and services such as massages, manicures etc. there are also streets and lanes with open air vendors, lanterns and streamers giving a wonderful atmosphere. Many open air food stalls provide cheap places to eat. I walked to and from Chinatown and felt completely safe. The streets are lit up at night and this creates a lovely atmosphere. A central place for special Chinese Festivities."
,,Interesting architecture,4.0,,"Easy to access on the MRT and worth a visit to look at the architecture. The bargins in the markets are few and far between but it's very clean and organised. There are plenty of dining options and unfortunately some of the high pressure salesmanship you'd expect but overall, it's a great way to spend a few hours."
,,Clean and colorful,4.0,,"Singapore's Chinatown is somehow different to other cities. It is a very clean and colorful place, recommended for a walk and some cheap shopping. You will also find several outlets to have a quick bite."
,,Not to be missed,4.0,,"this place comes alive in the evening. Lots of shops, restaurants and street food vendors. Chilli crab available in most eatery's and worth trying. You can bargain in the shops and we got some great deals on kimono's and tea sets. Lots to see including great architecture. Don't miss this"
,,"Lots of shopping, lots of food",5.0,,"Street after street of vendors selling all sorts of souvenirs - purses, technology items, t-shirts, knick knacks, jewelry. Not the greatest quality on most of it, but good for picking up some souvenirs to take home. I loved the children's chopsticks they sold and bought several of those. And picked up a selfie stick for about $10. Best was the Maxwell Rd. Hawker Centre with food stall after food stall of authentic foods....spicy crab, chicken rice, oyster cakes, coconuts, etc. A real treat for the senses and lots of fun."
,,Charming!,4.0,,"So our friend Rewell had us walk from Raffles to the streets of Chinatown for the view he said. Later did we find out, he was actually doing it to earn more steps to his daily walking exercise. No kidding, that was a looong walk. Haha, but really we stumbled in such a charming place. Lots of history, bargains and food. This is Chinatown at night. Singapore is one of the oldest Chinatowns, and the largest."
,,Chinatown is NOT Just The Street Market,4.0,,"Looking at the reviews here on ""Chinatown"", many people think that Chinatown is just the small area where all the stores selling gaudy goods and cheap Chinese stuff - IT's NOT!!!

There is a separate attraction called Chinatown Market - I think this particular attraction ""Chinatown"" deserves to be reviewed separately. The street market is cheap and bustling and, like I said in my review thereof, it's just not what it used to be 10 or more years ago.

The real Chinatown is behind and beyond the street market and it is WELL worth taking the time to explore that all on it's own. There is such a rich culture in the area with many little temple and many, many little restaurants and bars. The restaurants are predominantly Eastern themed for obvious reasons but there are a few more Western type restaurants sprinkled in between.

Many of the buildings in this area date back to the 1920's and in many cases, time has stood still in these back streets. THIS is the real Chinatown and this is where you'll find true Singaporean culture and cuisine.

Take the time, you'll need a good few hours to explore around. If you start at the street market, walk away from the downtown business area and two or three streets up New Bridge Road, hang a left into the side-streets. Well worth the visit and definitely take the time to sample the fare at teh many restaurants in the area."
,,Burn a few hours,4.0,,"Super easy to get to, the MRT brings you straight out into the shopping areas. Most food here is reasonably priced. Shopping is cheaper than in other areas but like most of Singapore bargains are hard to find. Very friendly area, locals happy to chat. Some staff do shadow you as you browse but at least no touting!"
,,Loved it!,5.0,,Loved the shops and bargains and the sites. A glimpse into the origins of Singapore. Easy to find. $5 taxi ride from Marina Bay Area.
,,One star for the tourist Chinatown - 5 stars for the local Chinatown food complex,1.0,,"One leaves the Chinatown MTR and exits into streets lined with every bit of conceivable tack imaginable, everything at inflated tourist prices. Like every tacky tourist spot in every city in China.

Lots of restaurants, but why pay inflated tourist prices when Singapore is loaded with great places to eat at reasonable prices.

If you want great local food, head towards the Buddah Tooth Relic Temple and behind it, is the Chinatown complex. Upstairs is an enormous food court with a huge range of dishes available from small stalls. This is what local eating should be all about. I discovered a small pancake stall selling both coconut and read bean pancakes. Never tried them beofre and at .80c a slice, absolutely a new favourite.

And if you're a dedicated foodie and have a camera, head for the basement which is a dedicated local market selling fresh produce. Fruit and vegetables, not a lot of meat, but stall after stall selling seafood. You might be in luck as I was - fresh frogs were on special: 10 for $4.00."
,,"For some restaurants, Maybe",3.0,,"We found a wonderful local restaurant to have our Spicy Crab, but we have been to many ""Chinatowns"" around the world and were not impressed"
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"As we only stayed in Singapore for one evening before joining our cruise, we only had time to visit Chinatown which was approx 200 yeards from our hotel...right in the action. Chinatown is a very dynamic place, which made us feel that we had really reached the Far East! We loved it. All the stalls, lit up for the night, lots of lanterns everywhere, and a fantastic atmosphere, it was buzzing. We had our evening meal in the Foodcourt Street, which was also amazing. Great value and all cooked from fresh, and sooo much choice. (Although I wasn't keen to see live crabs, and even a little turtle, plus handle, for sale to eat. However, we were in Singapore!! How I wish we had booked extra nights there. Enjoy....we did!"
,,An oasis for chinese and korean food lovers.,4.0,,"The Singapore Chinatown is very easy to exlore on foot as it is quite compact sizewise. The highlights are the market streets and especially the food street, that comes alive around and after 6 pm. Cantonese, hainanese and sechuan kitchens are well represented here serving meat, seafood as well as vegetarian delicatessen. For those of us loving the Korean BBQ, there's a very good selection of restaurants on Tanjong Pagar and Tras streets behind the Maxwell hawker center. Some restaurants have early bird offerings on drinks if you arrive btw 5 to 6 pm."
,,a lively area,4.0,,"It is a lively and chaotic area, but not as exotic as I would have liked. But it is a nice place for an hour walk."
,,Old Singapore,5.0,,Loved exploring the streets in china town never know what you will find . The cobblers mending the shoes. really good buskers Cheap food and drink. And the market where you can pick up lots of bits and pieces
,,Quite the active place!,4.0,,"Merchants selling all sorts of goods and souvenirs. Chaotic but interesting. Like the old architecture on some of the streets. In hot humid weather, it can be stifling on the narrow streets."
,,"Interesting, but commercial",3.0,,"Think $2 Shops on steroids. Bargains galore of the cheap and touristy kind, ie t shirts, rulers, pens, bags, jewellery, etc.

An intetesting and photographic temple and mosque in the area.

Worth a half day visit, but not as good as Little India or Kampong Glam in my opinion."
,,Exciting place to visit,4.0,,"Whilst in Singapore spent an evening in china town
The colour and vibrancy of the area is intoxicating
Shopping is abundant
Reasonable resturaunts, with excellent food choices
And the highlight of the was the rickshaw cavalcade through the street for 30 minutes was exciting and something not too be missed"
,,Bright and colourful,3.0,,Like many Chinatown areas this one has a number of restaurants and shops. Make sure to visit the temples in the area - the Buddha Tooth Relic temple in particular
,,Similar to any other Chinatown,3.0,,We stayed in China town for four nights. Overall nothing to different from Sydney Chinatown. Worth having at least one meal here but you can do this in half a day. As Singapore has a lot of other great activities to do.
,,Worth The Experience,5.0,,Lots of small markets to shop! Great food to eat! People are so friendly in Singapore - it's clean and you feel safe! What more could you ask for.
,,Souvenirs and temples,3.0,,"The three places of worships (Buddha Tooth Relic & Temple museum, Sri Mariamman temple and Masjid Jamae Chulia) provided a nice contrast to the crowding commercialism around them. As per norm of a Chinatown, it has everything. From cheap hawker food to fine dining restaurants, all type of foods, fashions from branded to unknown, medicine, spa, even furniture and library, not to mention the abundant of competitive stores selling souvenirs."
,,some hidden finds!,4.0,,"there are many souvenir shops along temple road and smith street, but many items are cheaper at the nearby CK department store. walk around and observe before buying anything.

people's park centre has a good wet market in the basement, and an extensive hawker centre at level 2. try all sorts of affordable cuisine there throughout the day. although most stalls don't open till late, that is exactly when the boutique beer places come alive/ smith street taps is one. unique beer+local grub=great night.

just opposite is the buddha tooth relic temple, and there's a vegetarian dining hall at basement 1. enter from the stairs at the side, facing the carpark which is currently under construction."
,,Just took it all in,4.0,,"I strolled around Chinatown by myself for about a half a day. It was just a bustling place with stimulation overload. Lots of colors, smells, sounds and PEOPLE! Lots of vendors that are all selling the same treasures and trash, but it is an experience and I really enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend if you like the hustle and being engulfed in the business of the neighborhood markets!!"
,,worth to visit is you have a chance,3.0,,The place is worth to visit but if you have more than 5 days in Singapore !! we went there for only 4 hrls at the Chinese new year day.... totally different from the city of singapore.... but if you need to buy cheaper things and eat its good :)
,,GREAT NIGHT MARKET!!!!!,5.0,,"Chinatown is a nice area and has some yum eateries.

We found some of the best shopping bargins in the whole of singapore, at the Chinatown markets.

While walking down one of the aisles, a shop on the left had this older man shop owner who was so pushy, we had to leave. He wouldn't let me look around the store and instead kept shoving these badly made silk shirts at me, and reakoned they were worth hundreds of dollars. He also tried to sell me this huge model plane, whose wings couldn't even be removed for travel back to NZ. I was so glad to escape his store.

The neighboring store had very well made womens clothing like beautifully made dresses, and they were very cheap.

Same alley but on the right side was another clothing store that had great quality cheap clothing and a really lovely man who was very helpful. I purchased these really nice button up shirts with embroidered patterns like a golden dragon (I've had so many great comments about that one in particular) & it cost just $18 !"
,,Can't miss!,5.0,,"Unique neighbourhood of Singapore with 2 great hawker centers: Maxwell and Chinatown complex. Go here for unique food, the real Chinatown atmosphere and don't forget the temples... Within a few hundred meters there is a Buddhist temple, a Hindu temple and a mosque.

Some streets seem a bit touristy, just wander off and find the real life!"
,,Step back to 1940s,3.0,,The streets are decked with sidewalk stores selling goods of 1940-1950. Very nostalgic. Can get souvenirs like tee shirt and knick knacks. The darnest thing i saw was selfie with kisses only S$18. Also enjoyed the sidewalk food stores.
,,A place with various goodies,4.0,,"Take a walk around chinatown, many cheap goodies that you can bring home. Don't forget to visit Tin Tin shop that just opened, for you all who loves 'Tin Tin', its a great place."
,,Get on the right road...,3.0,,"You would think that everything you thought you wanted could be found here… If you are looking for “fake goods” or DVDs or electronics then go to KL. Good on Singapore for having regulations about counterfeit goods. So what can you buy here? > Tea, medicine, Chinese goods etc… I’m sure there’s more but we really didn’t want to venture into the back streets where the only language communicated was Mandarin. Where did all the Cantonese go?

Our first night here, we were sucked into what we call the “China” end of the markets. We were hungry and the front restaurant ushers were very enticing showing us pictures on the menu. We gave in to a Korean restaurant and ended up paying AUD$130! That’s crazy! Wouldn’t pay that back home especially in China Town…

A little wiser, we returned on our last day. There are super cheap Food Courts/ Complex (AUD$3-8) for a decent dish or go to the ever popular Smith Street… (sounds so Western).

Here you can definitely get great food at a fraction of the price elsewhere in Singapore. There are stalls serving Hainanese Chicken, Satay, Chilli Crab etc… at resonable prices. Great if you like beer too but because we wanted to drink our bottle of wine, ended up at Fatty Wangs Restaurant.
Corkage was $10 but the food was great. I got my fix on an exceptional sweet and sour pork done Cantonese style. Duck, pork, tofu, fried rice etc… was great. We did pay more than the stalls but at a total of AUD$75 it was cheaper than any other dinner we had in Singapore."
,,Fantastic place to mooch and shop,5.0,,We really enjoyed strolling through Chinatown - just make sure you choose the right exit when you come off the metro otherwise it can be hard to get your bearings! There's a great selection of stalls selling touristy souvenirs and even a dollar shop which is very reasonable for cold drinks etc. Note too the Tintin shop!
,,Fun place to buy souvenirs n South Asian food,4.0,,Nice place to roam around and you can bring lot of souvenirs for your friends n family without making your wallet empty ;) though all them are made of China ;)
,,Nice views of the buildings for first timers!,4.0,,"Upon arriving from the MRT Station, I said ""WOW!"" when I saw the buildings and surroundings of Chinatown. This is my first time seeing with my own eyes what a Chinese structure looks like. Almost everything you need is here. Shoppings, Foods, Temples, Hotels. You name it."
,,Great place for good food!,4.0,,"Trust your eyes and ears when here. The food is traditional Chinese and you have a huge variety of options here. We sat at a restaurant where the lady at the reception could speak english. I forgot the name of the place but the food was really nice. You will find a lot of Chinese food and Chinese goods at China town (As the name suggest) But I really do not know if its really worth spending your money as we thought the goods were over priced.
Please feel free to ask any questions regarding this place :)

Safe Travels!
Make the most of it!"
,,Vibrant and bustling,5.0,,"Having visited Singapore on previous occasions we always make for Chinatown. It is very easy to get to on the MTR and is a vibrant, bustling part of the City. Sit with a drink at a pavement café and watch the world go by and browse the many shops and stalls."
,,Character retained in modern city,5.0,,"Chinatown in any city is a must visit for us. They all have little trinkets, interesting utensils, great food stalls, jade jewellery and historical souvenirs. Singapore's Chinatown is one of the best. We never visit Singapore without going to Chinatown. I bring a shopping list in case I get caught up in the goings on and forget what I wished to purchase. Always bustling with colorful activity. Love it."
,,Still holds its charm,4.0,,"Massive markets for you to buy your souvenirs, cloths, get a good feed and take in the ambiance of the place."
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,"Great place to get some cheap and tasty eats , some souvenir bargains and to soak up the atmosphere with a tiger beer !"
,,Great time and shopping,5.0,,"We were in Singapore for 2 days after our 2 week cruise. We decided that we wanted to try Dim Sum in Chinatown. Took a short cab ride from our hotel and walked around looking for a ""crowded"" restaurant. Found one and we were in luck that some people were leaving. There were 3 of us. We ordered up a storm and the food was amazing, definitely different than the one in the San Francisco area, but delicious. By the time we left, the line to get a table was pretty long. After dim sum, we walked around Chinatown and found lots of good buys - sterling silver jewelry, and souvenirs. We came across a beautiful Chinese temple. After a 2+ hour walk, we took a cab and went back to our hotel to freshen up and see more in Singapore, which by the way, it is a gorgeous city."
,,Usual range of stalls but interesting buildings,3.0,,"Buildings were interesting as mainly original but most of area is now a market selling the usual tourist stuff - T shirts, gifts etc. Poured with rain when we were there which resulted in shop keepers covering up their stalls and us getting very wet!. Prices and quality of products was OK - although not as cheap as Malaysia. Worth a visit"
,,Loved shopping here,4.0,,"Came here a few times, first day was a quick afternoon trip, was way too hot to be out walking around. Next was by night, so much better, even had a very nice dinner in the middle of Chinatown. Last time was on our departing day, just to spend the rest of our Singapore cash & fill up our suitcases! 16 & 19 yr old kids loved souvineers & were all the right price for them. We loved them all too, heaps to bring back for family & friends. They do have a lot of things that you just don't find back home."
,,Some of the best food in Singapore!,5.0,,"My hostel was in the area, and I loved coming to the pedestrian street (between Mosque St and Pagoda St) to find the hawker food! There are many little shops where you can buy souvenirs and clothing. Even at night, it was a great place to be!"
,,Love this Guy!,4.0,,"It is always worth a trip to the noodle guy, pulled noodles that are great.

We had noodles, of course, and the food comes fast and is so fresh.

We ate in the tiny place but there is also seating outside of the walking street.

You can watch the noodles being pulled and if you are lucky get in for a picture.

We took the subway and that was super easy!

Everything we ate here was great not a single disappointment!

Did I mention how clean the place is?"
,,Great Food and Shopping,5.0,,"A great place to eat and shop. Lots of clothes, souvenirs and a short walk from Clarke Quay. A great morning/afternoon out."
,,Korea restaurant,5.0,,Good style. Good service. Good good good good good
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,"We stopped off the sight seeing bus and had a walk around. There is an amazing Buddist temple here and some great paces to eat. Well worth seeing if you are in Singapore. Lots of market stalls and shops selling some tat, tech and clothes."
,,"Very, very good experience!",5.0,,"China Town is a very charming area in Singapore. You could spend hours and hours walking aroung, going to the temple, or having a meal on the busy street. I highly recommend the si chuan soup, which is a blast!"
,,Chinatown is Chinatown,4.0,,Took the bus to Chinatown in Singapore in the evening - the atmosphere was great - actually went to go to the Tin Tin shop and had a wander around the alley ways. The lights were fantastic - not sure if it was a special occasion but the place was very busy. Worth a visit.
,,Loved it.,5.0,,Catch the MRT to DT19 hop off and your at the start of China town. Great shops better than orchard road IMO. The stalls are great place to pick up some much need dried snack food and nuts.
,,Compact and worth a visit,4.0,,Easy to get to and from (liken mioost of the places in Singapore) lots to see in a compact area Restaurants are plenty as well as the shops. Certainly worth a visit while on Singapore!
,,As Chinatowns go it was better than most,4.0,,"We went in the evening right before all the lights turned on throughout all the shopping stalls. The surrounding streets also had lots of Year of the Goat lighted decorations. It was here, and only here, that we broke our ""no eating from the street vendors"" rule for southeast Asia. It was pork satay that was well cooked and we didn't seem to suffer for it. I bought some interesting T-shirts and had a 30 minute Chinese foot massage for about 20 USD - expensive when compared to Thailand but cheap for the US. It's easy to get to Chinatown from the MRT. There is also a Cat Cafe there - worth a visit."
,,Festive Chinatown,4.0,,"Restored shophouses add charm to a lovely and cosy suburb nestled close to the city. It is comparable to the Jewish Quarter in Paris and similarly houses boutique hotels, shops & restaurants. At its prettiest during Chinese New Year & the Lantern Festival but come prepared for the crowds at this time. I often dine there."
,,A perfect place to stroll and feel the cultural ambience..,5.0,,"We visited Chinatown by MRT, and as soon as we exited the station, the atmosphere caught us by surprise. The exit is located at the heart of Chinatwon, showing architecture that is strikingly different with the towering modern building in the bakcground, while many, many souvenir shops greeted us on the paveway.

Make sure you head first to The Visitor Centre where you can get Chinatown Map and have warm chit-chat with the staffs about the history of Chinatown and places in the area that you should visit.

Stop by Chinatown Streetfood Center or Maxwell Food Center to taste local delicacies. The souvenirs have fixed price and are quite cheap for us.

Panggah
Jogja, Indonesia"
,,China shopping,4.0,,A very good place for the tourist to haggle and purchase. The place is bustling with touristy purchases. Tip : take your time scout around before you buy.
,,Great fun good food,4.0,,We got to China town from the hop on and off tourist bus. We enjoyed a lovley dinner here and did something souvenir shopping at many of the traditional style traders within the eat street area. We walked back to hotel from only a few blocks from the Clarke Quay area.
,,A good three plus hours required,5.0,,"We went the second day of Chinese New Year, it was super busy, but you expect it to be at this prime time of year, with us tourists flocking to see the area.

We went via the MRT, but you can go by taxi, public bus or one of the hop-on hop-off tourist buses.

There are many things to see and buy, yes there are cheap tacky items, but there are also some unique things to look at and buy.

Visit the Chopsticks shop, selling many different types of chopstick, from different materials, but also hand made fans and wooden combs.

Three well made waterproof shopping/hand bags for S$10, pencil cases, giant pencil erasers, pens, mirrors, badges, etc. from one of the may souvenir shops.
Perfect for the Indonesian visitor that has to buy many 'Oleh-Oleh'.

While in Pagoda street, go to the end of the street and visit the Hindu Temple.
You will need to take your shoes off and ladies will have to cover their legs, they will also want you to pay S$3 (photo charge) towards the upkeep of the temple (many people did not, but why disrespect the temple to save S$3.

Take time to walk all around the area and if hungry, eat at one of the many attractive Chinese restaurants in the area.

Have fun."
,,Awesome Street Food,4.0,,"I really like China Town in Singapore. There is an excellent food corner with tasty and cheap China food. I recommend dumplings. Street market is also very interesting. What I miss there, is a historical point, the place where is possible to find out more about historical background of China Town. But, being in Singapore and if you like street food, don't miss this place."
,,A consize market,4.0,,"Chinatown I have visited is actually a one street (Pagoda st.) with many shopes and stands/stalls which sugest all chines items you may imagine : kimonos , scurfs, pillow covres, decotative items, home footware, toys, all kinds of food, accessories, floweres and many many other nice items. Here you can find also tailors( most of them Indians) who will be glad to have your order.Worth a visit, but without small children. Besids Pagoda st. there are few others aruond which sometimes sugest cheiper prices but not so colorful and so impressive as Pagoda st."
,,Typical Chinatown with a Malaysian twist,4.0,,"Visited today (3/4/15) Good Friday, heaving with people and tat...! Loads of places to eat and shop, even got a McDonalds and its own railway station, worth a visit but mind your pockets."
,,Worth a look around,4.0,,"Probably One of my fav places in Singapore! Very awesome and cheap food and great street market. Could deffo spend hours there. Surprisingly u clean as well, considering the amount of people every day."
,,Crowded & expensive food,3.0,,Wasn't so keen on this area - the time of our experience was extremely crowded - we decided to eat in one of the restaurants along the main strip - nothing special but prices quite high.
,,Hawker Food Markets,5.0,,"We found a small food market on our way to Chinatown and it was such a wonderful experience. Locals were very friendly and helped us wok out how it all worked - excellent value, messy chilli crab and rice but an unforgettable memory."
,,Chinat Town,5.0,,A well set out centre of this area for shopping and food places to eat with a good variety of goods on sal
,,Goats and Garlic,4.0,,"Chinatown was just around the corner from our hotel - the Dorsett - so we ended up walking through it several times. We ate at a good Dim Sum restaurant - Tak Po - and also at the Hawker Centre which tempts you with aromas of garlic and hot oil.
Chinatown is very busy, noisy and has the usual array of fascinating sights and smells, food, medicine and tacky souvenirs shops. It was Chinese New Year, so there were orange trees everywhere and hundreds of illuminated goats lined the main street.
On the periphery of Chinatown were lots of really nice looking bars and restaurants.
Definitely worth an explore."
,,Well Worth Spending Time,4.0,,"ChinaTown is well worth a visit. Lots of tiny shops selling all sorts of touristy items. Lots of repeats but if you browse you are sure to find something of interest. Several tailor shops that will make a suit in 24 hours, or a business shirt in 5 hours for about $80. Lots of authentic food cafes and restaurants that seem well priced. Probably best to visit in the evening as walking around in the sun is a bit too hot.. 32deg and 90% humidity and that's in April!"
,,New years @ Chinatown,4.0,,"Visited Chinatown during the Chinese new year 2015, it was lively and the firework and float was awesome. The place was crowded and the food street had nice selection of treats."
,,Language of Budget Shopping,4.0,,"There is the Paragon and high-end shoppes at Orchard Road. Then there's Bugis Junction for the trendy twenty to thirty-somethings. For the rest of us looking for best of the bargains, there's always Chinatown.

And Singapore's own has it all: gourmet food rivaling the best of what Orchard offers, traditional and avant-garde cuisine that Bugis Junction is known for at more reasonable prices.

For the visitijng business person meeting business partners in Chinatown or adjacent areas, the two adjoining malls provide a refreshing retreat."
,,cool place for bargains,4.0,,"This is a cool place to wander and get lost looking at the flea market type stalls. There are all sorts of things to buy, but bring cash!"
,,Vibrant,4.0,,"We were there for the evening, needed more time to browse around, good chinese food, very oriental, with typical chinese building, would love to go there again but with more time on hand, good bargains. Good malls"
,,"Hot ,crowded and I still loved it",5.0,,"I was there in Feb ,liked it so much that we went back again in March ,it was hot ,humid and crowded but the atmosphere is fantastic, better prices than rest of Singapore . Colorful and vibrant, bargains on just about everything.it will be the first place I return to if I have a chance to go back to Singapore"
,,A must see and experience in Singapore,5.0,,"Chinatown has something for everyone, just don't go before about 11am as not all stalls open early. Early evening is perfect. This historic precinct with its old buildings, vibrant atmosphere, noise, incense and brilliant colours just has to be experienced at least once in your life.
Whether you are seeking authentic food, trinkets, souvineers, cheap clothing, bespoke tailoring, electronics or jewellery etc, it is all there.
When it all gets too much, retreat to an oasis of tranquillity, the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum if only to admire the rooftop garden."
,,Lovely place to get lost...,4.0,,"This is a lovely part of Singapore to sit and watch the world go by, or wander through the tiny streets and enjoy the culture and food. Be sure to watch out for the Line Dancers. They are amazing!!"
,,VERY COLOURFUL AND A GREAT PLACE TO VISIT.,5.0,,"A great place to come and very colourful, especially at night. Lots of shops selling all kinds of things. Great restaurants and some bars to eat and drink from cheap till expensive. A must when you are in Singapore."
,,"china town, food court",4.0,,The vibrant colors and authentic architecture make this area so special. The temples and the food streets are fool of people that is always gives a feel for the excitement for looking and sampling the goods (at stalls) or food at the food court. Easy walking from our hotel.
,,Don't Miss It,5.0,,its a lovely part of the city that has excellent food and cheaper drinks. Walking through the markets is fun and getting a saying marked on a scroll or your image cut out of paper is fun and inexpensive. They make great souvenirs. Definitely take an afternoon and stroll through.
,,Good place to shop,4.0,,Nice place to spend your time with family.. Near to metro station and good for buying gift items..Mini China in Singapore..!!
,,An Absolute Delight!,5.0,,"We visited Chinatown whilst on an extended stopover en-route to Australia. In fact we visited several times, as we found it an absolute delight. Loads of different things to see, taste and smell - lovely food, great value goods, and very friendly people. The ladies had senna tattoos done by a very nice young lady just near the entrance....quite beautiful work. The only let-down was the coffee we had in a cafe round the corner - probably the worst cup of dishwater we've ever tasted....but that didn't stop us thoroughly enjoying the overall experience! Brilliant - we'd love to visit (everything but that cafe) again and again!"
,,"""Upmarket"" Chinatown",5.0,,"Been to many 'Chinatowns', this is one of the best. Interesting touristy shops, great food cafes and bars. Easy walking around. It was hot so stopped for a cheap beer in a cool cafe/bar. Bought 3 trendy ladies watches for S$10, all still going. Stopped to eat (do not know which cafe) but it was soooooooooooooo good."
,,Quick visit,4.0,,"Walk from Lime Restaurant to Chinatown MRT station. This walk goes through many of the stalls selling cheap items of variable quality. It was the Penultimate night of the Chinese new year celebration, and area was beautifully lit up (see photos)"
,,Buy souvenir and chinese cultural,5.0,,"You can found a lot of SG souvenirs here, the price are cheap and various. Chinatown also is a cultural places, where we can see temples, old building at here. Beside that, we can stay at cheap rate hostel near here, there are a lot of choices. I will visit here every time I come to SG."
,,Mega size China Town,4.0,,21st March 2015 was not a very crowded day for China Town in Singapore. Interesting food shops all around. A market place for bargain hunters. I doubt if all the goods were from China. Singapore is full of great traders. Goods from other parts of Asia can be found. Window shopping is just as fascinating.
,,"Vivacious, lively, crowded, noisy - great!",4.0,,"Well worth a visit, especially in the evening. Easy to get to by Metro. Very crowded, very noisy, loads of tourist rubbish to buy, but also some bargains. My wife bought a jade necklace and earrings at two thirds retail price (genuine jade, too!)
Eat there if you can. One street is cleared in the evening and tables & chairs put out. You find a seat (any table) and then buy food from one of the stalls in the centre of the street. Basic food, but cooked fresh in front of you, and delicious, especially with a bottle of Singapore beer.
Chinatown has to be a ""must see"" in Singapore!"
,,China Town,5.0,,Any visit to Singapore requires a visit to Chinatown where there ar number of shops and attractions primarily The Temple of Budda's Tooth and whilst you are there there are shops that will write your name or your business's name in Chinese writing - something totally different. As a different experience go to Chinatown via the MRT and alight at Chinatown MRT Station. A definate must
,,Quick visit,4.0,,"My family spent almost 2 hours walking around here - but 45 minutes of that was spent getting a foot and back massage, which was very good and cheap. There are tons of little souvenir shops and merchants wanting you to come see what they have. Fun place to experience."
,,Good Food and nice flair,5.0,,"whatever you eat there, it is great. the Feeling being in such a nice street is just cool. all People around seems to enjoy."
,,Busy Place.. but not a favorite,3.0,,"There are so many stalls, stores and vendors in the place. Yes it is indeed a busy area. You can find lots of people shopping, eating and selling stuff. However, it is not really a favorite place cuz I got dizzy when I went to the place. I have a very sensitive nose and I usually got headache when I smell strong odor or scent.. So I didn't really enjoyed it, but I think it is a good place to shop. We went there to exchange money as they have good rates there."
,,One of the best Chinatown's we have visited,5.0,,"This Chinatown is very beautiful. Decorations everwhere, street food that melts in your mouth shops with great bargains and even a mall. A larger Chinatown than we have seen elsewhere. And off course , being in Singapore, pretty clean."
,,Busy and fun,5.0,,"Enjoyed visiting Chinatown with my sister and 3 teenagers, we shopped and ate and drank and just enjoyed the general atmosphere. Lots of souvenirs and cheap trinkets but also great food"
,,Junk town,3.0,,This was not my idea of China town. Junky souvenirs everywhere. people all trying to get you into their shop. However the redeeming features are the food and the temples.
,,Great food & souvenirs,5.0,,"In Chinatown you can find lots of hostels, restaurants and souvenir shops. Chinatown complex has food markets in the basement, clothes etc. markets on the ground floor and a food hall up top. There is a great range of food and it's pretty cheap.

As expected, this area is best at night."
,,Vibrant area t explore food & shopping,4.0,,"This place comes to life in evening afterwatrds...
as you exit the MRT chinatown you will come to pagoda street, this where the action is...
both sides are lined with numerous shopping stalls & restaurants...

use your bargain power & you can get many good stuff.. enjoy the experience & then relish some of the delicacies at the street side restaurants..."
,,A Must Visit Place,4.0,,"During my visit in February 2015, the entire area was decorated with red and gold for the chinese new year which augmented the beauty of the buildings. There are lots of street vendors selling various items including food and souvenirs. The latter items are very cheap in chinatown. Saw several religious places including Lord Buddha Tooth Relic temple and Sri Mariamman temple. There are plenty of places to eat out. Travelling is easy especially with the MRT. Visitors to Singapore should not miss a visit to the chinatown."
,,Wonderful during Chinese new year,4.0,,It is one of the location in Singapore you can not miss and specially during the Chinese new year with lots of local and Chinese stuff on sale and lot of eating places that would be enjoyed and more so if you like eating at the street. Hygiene in Singapore is much more better on streets too than other Asian countries.
,,A must stop destination for dinner,5.0,,"Street food vendors in a very clean and well organized environment created some of the most unique and tasty treats I experienced during my week long stay in the area. A host of trinket shops are all around the area for souvenirs. The area was well maintained and quite well organized compared to what I've experienced in the United States. Having arrived just after Chinese New Year celebration, a good portion of the decorations were still up making it all that more interesting."
,,Best place for souvenirs,5.0,,"This is the place to come to when getting souvenirs! The night markets are wonderful and so cheap. For example keyrings i found in other tourist areas for $5 were $1 here. So many amazing deals to be had. Its true that many stores sell the same things but each store does sell something unique so its worth searching your way through. It is annoying when the sales people hound you while your trying to shop though. Each store has their own unique specials. Some sell 4 tote bags for $10 and some 36 key rings for $10....you will definitely find something cool to take back home for your loved ones. Some things are pretty bad quality but other times i was surprised at how good some items were.

There are also many fantastic places to eat here and new exciting dishes to sample at great prices too. Its easy to get here as the train stops right next to the markets. Been twice and will being my friend back next month when she comes to visit."
,,Nice place to visit,5.0,,I enjoyed browsing around chinatown because of their beautiful buidlings. There are shops that you can find souvenirs in reasonable prices. There is a Thai restaurant that is good if you miss Thai food and they have free wi-fi. I can't wait to be back again. Love it!
,,Not too shabby!,4.0,,"My husband went to a great 1/2 day cooking class in Chinatown (whilst I hit the shops) ...incidentally it was FOOD PLAYGROUND and he highly recommends it! Later that day we jumped on the Hop On Hop Off (or Hippo as they call it in Singapore) and got off at Chinatown. Really pretty, a little touristy compared to a lot of ""Chinese"" precincts that we have seen but definitely worth a visit and a look around."
,,meet the locals,4.0,,very fast very nice very cheap had a good time food good liked the are go to the toilet first it is asia lol
,,Some things around Chinatown,4.0,,Chinatown is best reached using the Chinatown MRT station. For seeing Chinese New year items - the main street has the really big setup and display near the People's Park Center exit (which is a massive shopping and food court plaza). If You go up on the Chinatown Point complex side - check out the food courts to the rear of the building. It is also that same area t go see decorations for the Hungry Ghost festival in August. Walker towards Speakers Corner park early in CNY and see the decorations there - as well as during the Moon Festival. Go to Temple street to check out a nice temple - and next to it is Smith Street and the food hawker areas.
,,Interesting,4.0,,"Chinatown was brilliant. Very vibrant and buzzing.
The street food stalls were very busy and we had lunch from one of them and it was very nice. Value for money for sure.
We ran out of time but I would like to go back and visit at night. All in all a must to see."
,,"Authentic, colourful and fun",4.0,,"Full of everything you love about Chinatown, sites, temples, food, shopping and decoration. It really is superb here with great local architecture."
,,As Chinatown's go not a bad one,4.0,,"We've been to 'Chinatown' in a number of cities and in comparison this one is'nt too bad. There's a better mix of shops and food outlets here than in some of them. Yes there are the really cheap and tacky shops but there are also some with better quality stuff in them and quite a variety too. Good atmosphere and reasonably clean too. There's also the Tooth Relic and Sri Mariamman temples which are both worth a visit. Also worth it is the Thiang Hock Keng temple a couple of streets away. Its easy to walk here from the river area ( 10 mins).
Finally - had a very cold ( and cheapish ) beer here at the Chinatown Seafood Restaurant near the Heritage Centre where you can sit and watch the world go by."
,,Nice to walk around,4.0,,"Nice to walk around the cultural Chinatown in Singapore. There were cute little booths and sidewalk eateries to stop by. Inside the Chinatown area, you will see the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum, the Maxwell Food Centre, and the Hindu Sri Mariamman Temple. We walked around and stopped by a Chinatown restaurant to have chicken satays and the Singapore signature dish of chilli crab for dinner."
,,A great experience,5.0,,We were lucky to be in china town at Chinese New Year.the place was buzzing.we had the best singapore sling.
,,Check Out Smith Street for great food,4.0,,Great Little Food Places around here! They also help you with your chopstick skills ;-) inexpensive. Good for backpackers and foodies
,,lovely place to wander around,5.0,,"We spent an afternoon wandering around Chinatown and loved it.The atmosphere there was great everything we expected.There was a very pretty temple there a good place to look around.We went just after Chinese new year so a lot of the decorations were still up lovely.Well worth a wander around,plenty of shops and eating places."
,,Love the colors here,4.0,,"Visit Chinatown for the Singapore Souvenirs, a quick massage, good food & the wonderful colors of Chinatown. You will find fridge magnets, small gift items at a very reasonable price here. The magnets are much cheaper than those available in Sentosa or other attractions. Lot of 2 dollar items shops. It is a very colorful market and a foodies paradise. On Purple line MRT, very close to Little India and Clarke quay. generally there are no refunds here so carefully check the quality of what you pickup.

There is an Indian temple at the end of the market. I think it is the oldest Indian temple in SIngapore. Good architecture. This is one temple in which I saw an idol of Draupadi... Had never seen it in any temples before."
,,Great exercise - great souvenir shopping!,4.0,,"Were staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel and took a taxi which was very inexpensive, +/- US$7 down to Chinatown. It is actually within walking distance of the MBS if you are interested in some exercise.

We did the traditional walk around looking at some of the buildings and architecture and like any touristy Chinatown it offers the good shopping, plenty of off the street restaurants and lots of movement local smells and bells to witness!

There are a lot of shops selling a lot of trinkets and souvenirs and keen prices from what we experienced. We found the alley ways somewhat congested and busy but this is to be expected, overall the place was reasonably clean and a great place to visit."
,,Lovely culture and heritage,4.0,,"Went there with my friends and teachers for a fieldwork. While interviewing tourists, we were impressed by the preservation of heritage and Chinese culture. The local food offered at the hawker center is very reasonable and delicious - ranging from Nasi Padang to Yong Tau Foo! However, it may get a little sunny in the afternoon and late morning, so bring along a cap or umbrella. :)"
,,Markets,4.0,,"All the New Year Decorations were still up (they'll leave them for a month) so very colorful and nice atmosphere. We went to the markets next to the Indian Hindu temple and that was lovely, bought some cheap and cheerful souvenirs. At the end is the entrance to the MRT China Town, so very handy.
My friend had a stamp made in Chinese characters and European letter, bargained it down by 50%!
We had already eaten, but there are plenty of small restaurants. They weren't pushy, just the tailors and jewelry shops are trying to lure you inside."
,,Very predictable!,4.0,,"We were staying close to Chinatown so we become very familia with it. It isn't as cheap as you would hope. There are some very ""junky"" things to buy but make sure you shop around for the best prices. Food in Chinatown is reasonably priced and generally very fresh.
Saturday morning shopping in Chinatown is qite a cultural experience with lots of interesting photo opportunities."
,,Very impressed!,5.0,,"If you love your markets - this is the place to be!
We had a wonderful time exploring the little alleys and scoring great bargains! Enjoyed some delicious food - and some not so delicious! But that's all part of the experience!
Sales people pushy but not over the top.
Want to visit again soon!"
,,Multicultural,5.0,,"Spend at least a morning here if you can, there is so much to see and do.
There are three different religions all in a row. A Muslim mosque, a Hindu temple and a Buddhist temple. The buddha tooth relic temple is fascinating.
Plenty of places to eat - food street at night is good, but has lost a bit of its charm since it was modernised
The Chinatown Heritage Centre is currently closed for renovation"
,,Too crowded ever!,4.0,,i went here around 7pm and it's too crowded coz' it's one of the shopping place in SG! Bring a lot of money coz you will be tempted to buy souvenirs..lol
,,A few hours in China,4.0,,"Although slightly apprehensive due to the numbers of Chinese as it was Chinese New Year We enjoyed the atmosphere and the reality, enjoyed the Temple and the peace it created and the banter with all the street traders"
,,love Chinatown,4.0,,"we visited Chinatown area a few times during our recent visit to Singapore, great place to buy a few cheap items.
We ate at eat street one night, very busy yet great atmosphere.

Just over the footbridge to People's Park is were you can find some great food vendors and lots more shops.

Chinatown is only a easy 10 min walk from Clarke Key.."
,,Unhappy,2.0,,"This was my first visit to any China town , didn't really know what to expect but found a market , full of cheap and nasty merchandise , the stall holders were mostly grumpy and didn't want to talk to anyone , we would have brought some souvenirs if someone would have taken the time to explain what the meaning of certain things were , we found the people rude and unfriendly . Based on my experience I would not visit this attraction again , but glad I went just to see for myself ."
,,Nice Place,3.0,,Nice place specially if you are looking forward to seeing old Singapore and from there you can view new singapore and its modern structure viewable from there from roads so it gives nice mixture of old and new singapore
,,More than just a market,4.0,,"Yes there are tourist shops like anywhere in Asia, but this place is different.

Go one street back from the Main Street in any direction and this is a busy lively place.

There are lots of artisan shops around: tailors, artists, smiths, and food.

Speaking of food, even though there are lots of tourists and visitors around, this is not a tourist trap. There are plenty of good spots for a cheep feed.

Spend some time just wandering, there are some heritage buildings around every corner."
,,Interesting and good food,4.0,,"We quite enjoyed the markets in Chinatown and also the food stalls were so yummy. Would recommend that you try some of the unique delicacies that are available. Chinatown also has some great alternative medicine stores, which were good for muscle tension. We went here twice on our stay just because of the food."
,,Traditional Chinese Culture,4.0,,"A mix of Chinese history along with trendy bars and boutiques and anything you want to buy from food,clothes,house items and relaxing massages.."
,,"China town, shop eat and look around",4.0,,"I've been in a couple of China towns around Asia, and the are all the same, a lot of cheap street food, markets where you can buy everything and always a nice temple, but you can definitely spend a couple of hours here, and they have affordable accommodations. And here the coke can was 1S$ everywhere else between 2-2,5S$, so if you're on a budget do your shopping here and save money"
,,Revisiting Chinatown after many many years....,4.0,,"Interesting to be back in Chinatown after many many years.

It is much smaller than it used to be nd visited by much more tourists,
but still an interesting place with some good buys around and also some decent restaurants to choose between.

Worth a visit while being in Singapore"
,,Overwhelming and underwhelming,4.0,,"Obviously one of Singapore's attractions, but a bit overwhelming in terms of shops, trinkets and souveniers, yet more of the same as other city ethnic collections. The food street(s) provide options which we did not get a chance to sample as our hotel lunch was part of our tour. Tourists should allow themselves a few hours to explore the area on their own. They also should gage their need for water and escape from the humidity."
,,Great place to stroll and enjoy,4.0,,"Full of people, noise and smells but that's what Chinatown is all about. Not much left of the traditional Singapore so this is a must see. Enjoyed just walking around, some food and soaking up the sights. Easy access by MRT so no excuses for not visiting,"
,,best place for shopping,4.0,,ita a best and cheap place for shopping dont forget to visit china town when you visit singapore ..i love the place
,,Chinese New Year's Transforms sleepy neighborhood,4.0,,"We had the good fortune to be in Singapore during Chinese New Year this February. Instead of the quiet neighborhood I had visited in the past we spent the day in a bustling throng of shoppers, tourists and families loading up on traditional holiday items for the celebration. Incredibly fun filled day.
One of the best opportunities to shop for little remembrances for loved ones and have some authentic food. Bring your camera!"
,,"Eat, walk, Shop",4.0,,"Good place for eat, nice place for shopping, and even just for walking. Prepare your feet and your money if you want to shopping. there are so many product to sell. It's also a place you can buy souvenir."
,,awesome shopping and food,5.0,,"highlight of my trip visiting China Town, great food and cheap shopping. great murals and artwork on the walls in some of the ally ways."
,,crowded and dirty,2.0,,I visited China town the first night of my Singapore trip. It was the second day of chinese new year. The china town was crowded and very dirty which made me so disappoited about the trip. Not much things to do at the China town excepting chinese foods and night market.
,,GOOD SHOPPING,4.0,,"Plenty of places here to shop. You don't get hassled here and there are plenty of 3 for $10 (Singapore) around £5. Jewellery/bags/purses/scarves/clothes without the hassle of bartering which I hate. Lots of places to eat too and a couple of department stores on the outer area.
We went during the morning when it wasn't too busy but I would think nighttime would be fairly crowded."
,,A must during chinese new year,4.0,,"Great place during Chinese New Year!
The streets are all decorated, shops stocking lots of traditional decorations and a great buzz. It does get very crowded though so keep a close ey if you have little ones. Definitely the place to get souvenirs - from unique (chinese calligraphy or antiques or handicrafts) to cheap and tacky! Something for everyone."
,,GREAT PLACE FOR GREAT FINDS,5.0,,"If you are a lover of cheap yet good quality items, then chinatown is the place to be. You can also buy memorabilias here for you to bring home to your friends and loveones. Many cheap clothes too."
,,Lovely at Chinese New Year,4.0,,The decorations and ambience of Chinatown at Chinese New Year was a great experience for the children. All the lanterns adorning the shophouses and the large goat statues lit up at night were a great experience for the children.
,,Superb food and great value for money,5.0,,"We have been here twice and have enjoyed Singaporean, Thai and Chinese food at a fraction of the price you would pay in the Malls of Orchard Road - the beers are great value too. The service is friendly, quick and efficient. It also has its own MRT (subway) stop too. The atmosphere is electric. Don't miss a visit here"
,,"Souvenirs, gifts",4.0,,"Perfect place for buying souvenirs and gifts for a very good prices. Almost in every shop they have action ""Buy three, one free"" and various other offers. If you like Chinese cuisine, you will be more then happy here. Not so crowded like Mustafa center!"
,,Singapore Chinatown - My Home,4.0,,"When visiting Chinatown, don't forgot to lunch at the hawker centre in People Park. What to eat? Just join any of the long queen and it will never go wrong. If you option for restaurant, there are many cuisines to choice from the restaurants running on both sides of the many small alleys in Chinatown.
During the Chinese New Year, there are temporarily stalls running throughout the nights. The overhead bridge are also beautifully decorated to the theme of most of the festivals in Singapore."
,,Need a gift or ????? its there and cheap,4.0,,"China town was amazing, lots of people, lots of """" name brand """" shoes, purses, electronics, you name it its there, you can have a new suit or ?? in 3 hours tailor made, lots of shawls, but silk is still expensive. Had fresh pineapple from a vendor, delish, A MUST GO"
,,Chinese New Year in Chinatown!!!,4.0,,"First of all we didn't expect to find a Chinatown in Singapore....almost redundant! We fortunate to be there during the Chinese New Year celebration. All of Singapore and of course, Chinatown, were beautifully decorated with outstanding fireworks every night. Chinatown was especially festive and no shortage of shopping and places to eat. This added a special treat to our Singapore visit......highly recommend."
,,Wonderful place wonderful people and food,5.0,,"This is a great place clean with loads of shops and bars . Great hotels , cheap food and gifts . I lot of other places should come here to see how well it can be done . China town at it's best new year . Just go see the lanterns and animals in the ms in street ."
,,Chinese New Year in Singapore,5.0,,"The time leading up to and including the New Year is when Singapore's Chinatown is at its colorful best. The streets are decked out with endless lanterns and lights, the crowd impenetrable, the food delicious and diverse (especially in the food courts) and the sites and sounds memorable. February is a great time to visit when the weather is a bit cooler and less humid."
,,cheap...,4.0,,There are so many things to buy..but if you don't like chinese items..just forget..but worth to visit...
,,Chinatown - best street food ever,5.0,,Loved the hustle and bustle of the place. Inside food hall is not for fine dining but does produce the best barbecued duck and pork I've ever tasted. Washed down with a Tiger beer and you can keep the more pretentious places. The cost is minimal and I'd have been happy to pay more.
,,China town crowds,4.0,,"Very nice China Town, as far as China Towns go. Stay out of the tailor shops unless you want something made, or want to kill time."
,,Great place just for watchin the world go by,5.0,,Lots of cheap shopping and cheap tiger beer ( $7 for a big bottle). Nice place to sit and people watch
,,Amazingly colourful,4.0,,We were fortunate enough to be in Chinatown while the New Year lights were still up. That combined with the vibrancy of the street life made walking through Chinatown a real pleasure. Chinatown is easy to get to via the MRT and is an experience not to be missed.
,,The nicest and most clean Chinatown I've ever seen!,4.0,,"I've been to a couple of Chinatowns in both Europe, America and Asia and this is by far the nicest and most clean I've ever seen. Honestly I'm not a big fan of Chinatowns but this one I really enjoyed. Had a good meal in one of the restaurants and just enjoyed walking the streets. If you're around, make sure to visit the Hindu temple Sri Mariamman."
,,A must visit place,5.0,,"Seems everything you can find here. Stores, foods and landmark are everywhere and of course with chinese style. A lot of souvenir can be bought here with good price. A lot of market can be found in every corner of small street. After tired of walking, have a seat in one of many foodstall there to relax and enjoying authentic chinese dishes with the locals. Will be more enjoyable if you understand chinese language."
,,What you expect it to be and much more.,5.0,,Many different things going on as I'm guessing it's the case in many other Chinatowns across the globe. Easy and hassle free shopping with many dinning options at every corner. And of course use there public transport as it leads you to its door step .
,,Street food in China town,5.0,,"Awesome place worth a visit Check the status of the place A,B,C, or D with A being the cleanest place to eat.

28 chicken and peanut sauce satays later with a cold tiger beer. Well worth a look and visit,

Off to China town for a meal again tonight"
,,Just what I expected it to be,4.0,,Loved Chinatown. Smith street was fabulous for restaurants and the night hawker food amazing. Had lots of atmosphere and markets. Loved it.
,,The Temple At Chinatown,5.0,,"Chinatown is fun, festive and happening. But a must is to visit the Buddhist temple at the entrance. It is beautiful and ornate. If the ladies have exposed shoulders and/or knees, don't worry, tey have plenty of coverings women can borrow at the entrance."
,,A great place,5.0,,"Great place to visit in the evening. Food off the market stalls on Stanley street is excellent value and pretty tasty as well. The market stalls themselves are full of the usual tourist fare, but still worth a visit."
,,Chinatown is a must visit place in Singapore,4.0,,"Chinatown is a colorful collection of attractions in Singapore. From the market in Pagoda street, the Bencoolen area, the covered streets in the Far East Plaza area, the busy shopping areas, the mysterious medicine shops, the heritage shop houses; too much to cover in one review. Don't skip Chinatown when visiting Singapore."
,,A great place that offers you many things,5.0,,"Chinatown in singapore is one of the authentic chinese comunity outside of China.
This place offers u many things, cheap hotel and hostel, authentic chinese food, unique goods store, and many more.
In this chinatown, the interesting place is not only at the road, but also in their traditional market.
Oh one more thing, dont forget to visit the temple around this area. Thats great also"
,,Must visit in singapore,5.0,,"One of the places a tourist should not miss visiting.Great place to shop for souvenirs,sight seeing and enjoying good food at the most reasonable prices.The outdoor markets are full of things from fruits,flowers ,hawkers food .I liked the old buildings in vibrant colors.Mrt Chinatown. Station makes it very accessible.and absolutely felt safe walking around it's crowded streets!"
,,Cheapest place to eat in Singapore,3.0,,"We found Chinatown the most economic place to eat in Singapore, even though for a City Chinatown it was still quite expensive. And it was nice to stroll around looking at the stalls. The place gets quite busy when the sun goes down, and it's a lively, atmospheric place to eat your evening meal."
,,Totally Authentic,5.0,,Great selection of shops selling everything from Chinese medicines to carpets and food. Great selection of eating houses and prices were very competitive. A great difference from nearby Orchard Road. Worth every minute of browsing time spent.
,,"Hot, lack of ventilation",3.0,,"In Chinatown, the weather here making the place super duper hot, and together with the close proximity of stores on the road, making the condition worse.
However it is, there is a lot of things tat u cn buy at there
Chinatown has lost the identity a bit since there is more ppl from China than Singaporean"
,,Try a Fish Spa,5.0,,"Chinatown is a great place to get authentic Chinese cuisine, shop for souvenirs, and visit temples. If you’re looking for a bit of relaxation after a chaotic day of walking in the heat, try cooling off and relaxing at one of the fish spas. It is a unique experience and was way better than a few of the regular massage spas we tried."
,,Very good area for all things chinese,4.0,,"More than enough restaurants to suit anyone, lots of tailors, and jewellers shops, as well as general goods."
,,Great time at New Years,4.0,,Things we're all decked out for Chinese New Year with lots of colour and decorations . Good for souvenirs and different tastes to try. Try to go early in the day as in the heat of mid day it would not be pleasant.
,,"Shopping, shopping!",5.0,,"As it's known, Singapore is one off the most expensive cities in a world, so this place is great deal to visit and buy nice cheap things for souvenirs.
Also you can find few nice places for rest, eat or drink coffee.
Near is also Hindu Temple that you can visit.
Good part to visit."
,,A must to flavour the uniqueness of Singapore.,4.0,,"Went to chinatown on week of Chinese New Year. It was an amazing sight but be prepared
for crowds of people. It can be very overwhelming. We got the subway and it was confusing
until we got our bearings and found the street we wanted. We went back another day and knew
exactly what we were looking for and where we were going so it was much easier.
We were only interested in the stalls and goods and there was great value...lovely kimonos
and of course the latest craze of selfie sticks in abundance. It was Fun."
,,Authentic Singapore catering for tourists,4.0,,"Although cheek by jowl with the modern 'Gucci' Singapore, Chinatown retains its own identity and it was a different experience to be in the bustle of crowds, noises, smells that were met around every corner. A lot of souvenir shops selling trinkets to the many tourists alongside shops for the local population. Very easy to access the area via the MRT and always felt very safe there. We shopped there in the afternoon and came back in the evening to eat at the food court alongside Chinese families. Good food, eaten on plastic tables in the street amongst the hustle and bustle. Everybody we met was friendly and helpful."
,,Very colourful.,4.0,,We were here across Chinese New Year so there were lots of decorations everywhere. It did however mean there were loads of people packed into the roads and markets. An interesting area with plenty of cheap tourist type goods on sale. The fruit and food produce made an interesting backdrop.
,,A must visit,4.0,,"I was fortunate to be in Singapore for the start of the Chinese New Year ,so my wife and I went down to Chinatown to have a look ,you could not move for people ,the whole area was decorated with lantern's and goat's ."
,,A must for any visitor to Singapore,4.0,,"There is always lots happening in Chinatown and this is even more true around Chinese New year. Many places to eat together with lots of shops (some selling rubbish, some with some old antique pieces and lots of gold shops). Worth a walk around to enjoy the bustle and imagine what Singapore was like before it became overrun with shopping malls."
,,Bargain shoppers,5.0,,Very nice & easy to get around. Wonderful choice of all types of cheap products. Friendly & helpful people with plenty of food
,,Plenty to do!!!,5.0,,Our hotel was located here so we spent a lot of our time exploring this area. The mrt station is very central and on the downtown line. There are plenty of shops and restaurants around and we could have sat all day watching the world go by. Also a great place for people watching!! Worth a visit if in Singapore.
,,A Bustling Example of Chinese Life,4.0,,"Chinatown was a very interesting place to visit especially as it was being prepared for Chinese New Year. Goats of all sizes, hanging lanterns and flowers were placed everywhere giving the area a very festive atmosphere. There are lots of small shops selling all sorts of interesting and unique items. Several shops can be found selling Chinese herbs and medicines. There are numerous food stalls serving authentic Chinese food . It was quite crowded though and we were warned to be careful of pickpockets."
,,Best place to find cheap souvenir items.,3.0,,Here is a good place to find souvenirs that you can take back to be distributed to friends. Prices are quite reasonable and food is easily available if you get hungry while shopping. But be aware that it's a bit warm over here due to the weather and the crowd.
,,Sights and Sounds of China,4.0,,"The Chinatown area of Singapore, just south of Clarke Quay, is easily reached on foot or by metro. The main market street (Pagoda Street) leads past stalls selling all sorts of goods to South Bridge Road, where a number of temples are located. We visited in the run up to the Chinese New Year, so the whole area was beautifully decorated."
,,Must visit place in Singapore,4.0,,Must visit this place when you travel Singapore. Lot's of shop and lot's of food options. must visit at evening and dinner time. There you will get lot's of company who sells candy and chocolate. you can try some free as tester.
,,Interesting place,4.0,,"Chinatown is interesting place , which is easily accessible by MRT. There are many small shops with various interesting gifts, street restaurants serving authentic Chinese food, shops with Chinese medicine, calligraphic inscriptions of names. Very interesting is the Buddha Tooth Relic temple and museum and Sri Mariamman Temple."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,The hotel I was staying at was only a short walk from China town and I attempted to navigate my way there alone. At first all I found was a few lone shops selling different foods but then I found a large mall where they had shops selling everything you could imagine and a lot of beauty and massage parlors. Out one of the exits of the mall there was a whole street decorated with Chinese lanterns and other decorations and tons of stalls selling all sorts of weird and wonderful things. Its definitely worth a visit even if you're just browsing.
,,A Fun Place to Visit in Singapore,4.0,,"No visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to China Town. A great place to mingle, (Beware of petty theft) and eat. We tried their shaved ice - Mango was exquisite and Durian interesting - not liked by my husband, but worth trying once. Going near the time of the Chinese New year Celebration is an added bonus. In addition, there is the SrI Mariamman Temple and Buddhist temple to see. The Sri Mariamman Temple will charge you $3 Singapore dollars to have your camera with you in the temple."
,,"If you have seen Chinatown elsewhere in the world, you have seen this.",3.0,,"We found Chinatown to be very similar to Chinatowns elsewhere in the world, although we did find this one to be more congested than most. Because of the small alleys through the stalls , shops, restaurants, and temples, it can feel oppressive and, of course, there is an increased awareness that pickpockets could thrive in such an environment.
Having made a brief visit on our day of arrival in Singapore, we avoided Chinatown for the remainder of our very enjoyable visit, except that we used the Chinatown metro station on a number of occasions - providing easy access to many sights in the city.
The food, generally, did not look very appetising, whilst we do love Chinese food, both in the UK and in China.
The cheap things on the stalls were just that - cheap tat."
,,Did I miss something?,3.0,,"I was told Chinatown was a busy, bustling marketplace full of bargain shopping and that traditional Asian experience of a crowded sea of stalls with trinkets, souvenirs and authentic street cuisine all happening at once in a mix of noise,nights and people! We literally got off the train at Chinatown and were convinced we were at the wrong place. Yes there were maybe ten small stalls for household items (eg. Brooms, dustpans, kitchen utensils, etc), and maybe two of the stalls had clothing...But that was it. There was a LOT of food places, so that was cool - and it was the authentic street food we expected. But for shopping? A real disappointment. It was like a ghost town once we'd walked about 30metres from the train station. Not sure if it's because we went so close to Chinese New Year (visited on Tues 17th) - but we were told it would all be open. I feel like perhaps we missed something or were in the wrong place, because it seemed a lot less than everyone's description...I feel like we'd seen everything after 10mins, wouldn't recommend, and wouldn't go back."
,,Interesting place to visit,5.0,,Very interesting place to visit. Lots of small shops selling all sorts of weird and wonderful items. Loads of food stalls and the smells and sounds make this a most visit when in Singapore
,,fascinating place.,5.0,,"this is a late review but i love this place, in the market i found many things in cheap value. and find old antique thing to buy here."
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,"We were fortunate to be in Singapore a week before Lunar New Year. China Town was even busier than usual. Really amazing buzz to China town. Unfortunately, it was bursting to the seams, so we had to cut our visit short. Great place for a visit."
,,So Charming!,5.0,,"I just love to stroll around and discover unexpected buildings with charming facades, little gems along Club Street, Ann Siang Street or Duxton Hill and Road. Maybe because I love old Czech towns as Prague and Cesky Krumlov so much as well. There are many restaurants and cafes to refresh in and the interesting places are well described on the boards all over. There are those famous places as Buddha Tooth Relic Temple etc you can find in every good guidebook but do just stroll in the neighborhood, it's really charming."
,,Vibrant Area,5.0,,"Pros:
1. It is conveniently located at an MRT station.
2. There is a Visitor Centre with helpful staff and materials.
3. There is a Chinatown Heritage Centre for visitors to have a better understanding of the history and culture of the area. It is currently under renovation and will be reopened later this year, but a full interactive virtual tour of the museum is available online.
4. There is free WiFi here (Wireless@Chinatown) which is great for tourists who want to Google about the place, upload pictures, etc.
5. There is beautiful and well-preserved architecture, such as shophouses and temples, great for photography.
6. There are plenty of stalls selling food, Chinese cultural items and Singapore souvenirs.

Cons:
1. It might get quite crowded, especially during Chinese New Year.
2. As it is an open-air concept, it might get quite hot if it is sunny / wet if it is rainy.

Tips:
1. Set aside an estimated time of 3 to 4 hours for your visit. If you want a more in-depth understanding of the area, plan your visit such that it coincides with the guided tours.
2. Make a visit during Chinese New Year to catch a glimpse of the most vibrant state of Chinatown. There will also be additional decorations, light-ups and performances that contribute to the festive spirit.
3. Bring a camera as there are plenty of photography opportunities.
4. Try bargaining when buying items as the shop owners will usually agree, especially on the eve of Chinese New Year."
,,Best to vist during Chinese New Year Celebration.,4.0,,"Chinatown Singapore come up alive during Chinese New Year with all the areas draped in auspicious cChineses of red, gold and orange.

Stores selling Chinese New Year decoration accessories and tibits can be found in all corners of the lanes.

There are assigned street performances like the Lion Dance but that depends on how lucky you are because they perform on selected days only.

There are light-up in the night and you can take beautiful shots. Every year, there is a different chinese's zodiac representation-2015 being the year of the Goat.

On other ordinary days, Chinatown is less lively. There is an Indian and a Buddhist temple nearby where you can visit. Entry is free.

If you are hungry, you can drop by the hawker centre which serve many local delicacies. You have to try your luck as it may not be likings to your taste bud (some food are made to be spicy, oily, sweet or salty).

Or you can into any restaurants along the streets. They provide air conditioned ambience but price can be more expensive.

In summary, Chinatown Singapore is worth visiting."
,,Last bits of history left in Chinatown,5.0,,"Chinatowns world wide are quite similar - it's always the first place the immigrant Chinese gathered together to find some semblance of home. Singapore's Chinatown is no different - used to be called ""Ngau Chieh Sway"" in Cantonese meaning Buffalo Carrying Water. When you walk down the Temple Street, Pagoda Street - look up and look at the house architecture - blot out the shops and the modernities and imagine what it was like 50 years ago - poorly maintained, dark steep staircases, like the modern immigrant workers, this was home to the immigrant Samsui women workers (red hats) living in bunks sharing one small room with all their ""sisters"".
Come visit Chinatown in Singapore for its history and also note that in the middle of Chinatown is a huge Sri Mariamman Temple - religious tolerance & harmony was easy then cos every one was in the same boat - working in a foreign country to send money home to families for a better life - not a new story still!
By the way - there is now also a sheltered food street (cooled by air coolers) where you can sample local hawker dishes which are of a good standard for visitors. Take the Chinatown Pagoda Street MRT exit and weave your way up and down the streets till the Outram road MRT entrance."
,,"Great place for people watching, food stalls, and small shops",5.0,,"What a place, vibrant, noisy, colourful, great for those last minute trinkets and presents. Its just a manic experience, full of fun, great shopping, buskers, and general people watching! Its a must do trip when visiting Singapore."
,,Hang around place,4.0,,Chinatown - Nice place for buying good souvenirs and T-Shirts. Good eateries. Sri Mariamman Temple - nice heritage place.
,,Chinese new year is crowded,3.0,,"To crowded for us :(
Espacially because of the way some asien people react in big groups (it's not raisist, it's what I experienced ) it's really uncomfortable to go around. Everybody is pushing you to get in front and see things better. If you don't get your elbows out u r lost!
The decoration was amazing but the rest only crazy. Wouldn't do it again.

Chinatown its self is like u expect it. I love the colours and after Chinese new year it was a lot better with the crowds. Have a look around ;)"
,,Just another Chinatown.,3.0,,"As you might expect there are dozens of shops and restaurants all through the area. Vendors will call out to you ""Hello sir"". Of course its a good place for shopping (remember to bargain) and for eating. The only thing different about this one is the Sri Mariamman Temple which seems completely out of place for the area. The Chinese Heritage Center is now closed until mid-2015 according to the note on the door, but I suspect it may never re-open. (That was one of my reasons for going to Chinatown). By the way, we ended eating at McDonalds."
,,Great to visit for lunch,4.0,,Chinatown in Singapore offers a unique and unparalled view of the history and cuisine of the city-state. We visited the district during Chinese new year which made the experience even more unforgettable. We walked from the Marina Bay which takes about 20-25 minutes to get to the heart of Chinatown but there is a subway rail that is very convenient and affordable. Be sure to take a map and guide yourself to the Main Street in Chinatown which offers the most diverse food options as well as links to temples and other historical attractions.
,,Crazy mayhem,5.0,,This is crowded due to the lead up to Chinese New Year. Decorations and atmosphere was just full on. Better bargains at Bugis compared to Chinatown. Dont forget to check out the Tin Tin shop and the Bath Culture Foot Therapy to recover from the mayhem and tired feet. Both temples are pretty cool - go about 7am to get good photos of the amazing heritage buildings. The place was crowded until 10pm .. there were performances at night but very crowded.
,,Chinatown during Chinese New Year's is the bomb,5.0,,We go to Chinatown about once a month. This year we went down during Chinese new years and it went off. Lion dances all kinds of very interesting things. And if you go the day before China Chinese New Year's you get a great deal as all the vendors want to get rid of their good so they can start their holiday. Chinatown is our go to place when all our visitors come to see us. It's constantly evolving so it never gets old. Just be aware of all the cheap Chinese stuff for kids and adults. You get what you pay for.
,,A great day out,4.0,,We loved visiting Chinatown in the lead up to Chinese New Year. The decorations were magnificent and the vibe amongst the market stalls was electric. Some fantastic food options especially in the Chinatown Food Street.
,,Singapore Chinatown,4.0,,"As in almost all cities, there is always a Chinatown. Singapore Chinatown.- architecture is well preserved but limited in variety of authentic and true old traditional Chinese food. Perhaps there is no demand and if there is, it is pricey. But don't miss it. It has the crowds, the atmosphere and architecture for some great photo shoots. Still some great value and delicious meals can be found in Kreta Ayer Hawker Centre where most locals will swear by it as the place to go for true Cantonese food. Steamed fresh fish head in traditional sauce, roast meats, rice rolls (chee cheong fun), yam cakes, wanton noodles, black sauce chickem etc. Look out for the long queues for the best ones. Must visit."
,,Chinese food,4.0,,"We visited Chinatown when we stayed in Singapore.
You really have to eat at the food market or in one of the good Chinese restaurants! The food is very good. When we were in Singapore it was shortly before Chinese New Year - so there were many stands were you could buy souvenirs. I would really recommend to visit Chinatown when in Singapore."
,,Meh,3.0,,I am a big fan of Chinese cuisine and I was looking forward to my visit to Chinatown but I found it a bit of disappointment. The food was not as great as food I've had elsewhere.
,,a brilliant market.,5.0,,we went in a taxi from our hotel to chinatown . we wanted to see something different. and also to buy some gifts. first we went into a temple-beautiful! then we went around a good part of the market but you get weary as so much to see as goes on for a long way. got a few gifts including some handpainted pictures for gifts done by a lady as we waited. i got a meal for lunch as my husband wandered off. i would recommend this place. we also stopped oudside a tiny little juice shop and i had a coconut cut open and had a straw to drink the refreshing pure coconut juice. we took photo also of a local child with her father.
,,Must visit Singapore Chinatown for Tourists!,4.0,,"It is wonderfully Chinese in every sense! Food, clothings & busyness bursting with life.
Warm, crowded but a new discovery each time I visit Chinatown, even for me, a local. There is the cheerfulness & vibrancy of movement. Everywhere is filled with the smell of the barbequed sweet meat with Chinese medicated products displayed along the passage way. Restaurants serving simple Chinese dishes are everywhere. It is a nice place to visit if one is visiting Singapore"
,,Truely Singaporeans,5.0,,"Being a Singaporean I really like this place. I enjoyed the good, cheap and yummy food in the hawker centres. I also enjoy the good buys at people's park. Enjoyed looking at the old folks playing chess and observing the strange medical herbs."
,,Static in time,3.0,,Good for a first time visit. Over time though nothing changes with same food stalls and same merchandise on sale. Very touristy and so can be overpriced At new year it is so busy there's no enjoyment to visit
,,Why would you not go to Chinatown?,4.0,,"Of course, it will rain when you get there ... but that's ok because you can sit under an umbrella and have a big bottle of beer (for a mere SGD 6 or so) and watch everyone else walk by (they brought umbrellas.) Maybe 2 beers. Possibly some black-pepper crab also (here it is much cheaper than in Clarke Quay, for example, ... but if you want the least expensive, go to Little Thailand.)

After 2 beers the rain will be over, and you can go about the business of being hounded by the tailors.

Don't schedule your trip so as to leave around 4 or 5 pm ... a taxi will be hard to come by.

Have fun ..."
,,Authentic,4.0,,I loved visiting Chinatown just before the Chinese New Year. Busy and bustling it was nice to wander around the markets and check out the wares.
,,An option for a day trip out from the city!,4.0,,"The culture of Chinatown is intriguing and worth a half day visit (also go to Little India whilst your there too!). There are street markets filled with hanging laterns overhead, the buildings are beautifully painted and there are some wonderful Buddhist temples near the road (that you can visit, but make sure you abide by their customs). It also sometimes is the best place to get a good exchange rate if you are low on cash, and a good cheap place to get grass jelly drinks. Just be aware that sometimes that some shop keepers will try and rip you off by telling you the incorrect price of a purchase, so be vigilant and challenge them if need be. One other fantastic thing is that if you have shoes that need to be repaired, there is an old man out the front of the China Town MRT station/ shopping complex entrance that can add new heel soles and whole shoe soles for only a couple of AUS dollars. He's also super quick! A place to visit for sure in SG."
,,Faking Chinatown,2.0,,"The Singapore Chinatown is a misnomer. It is not a representation of the general Chinese culture and lifestyle that one associate with Chinatowns found in say, San Francisco or Toronto. It is not a place to get to know the history of the Singaporean Chinese. To me, Chinatown is blatantly a tourist trap where prices are marked up exponentially and the buildings are all modern and do not hold any historical values.

There are shops selling cheesy trinkets and souvenirs that no sensible locals would think of buying. There are also food stalls along the open air street with overpriced menus that again, you do not usually see locals patronizing. If you must try some local food, go to the nearby Chinatown Food Centre, also known locally as a hawker centre. Or you can take a walk to Hong Lim Market and Food Centre. Locals favor these places for the reasonable prices and wide varieties of local food.

So, is the Singapore Chinatown worth visiting? In short, no. If you are interested in how the locals live, you would do well to visit a housing district like Clementi, Jurong or Woodlands."
,,Bustling with life,4.0,,"Now during the Lunar New Year you find people by the hundreds during the day as well as at night. At times, you simply have to go with the flow of the masses and can hardly stop at a stall to look at something or buy. However, during the other weeks of the year, you find it a lot more entertaining with its interesting shops, street vendors and street food stalls. I especially enjoy Smith Street with the covered food stalls and sitting places. Here and at other streets in China Town, you find delicious food from all kinds of kitchens with a variety of tastes. Don’t forget your camera and to listen to the languages spoken. MRT, taxi or a bus will easily bring you to China town."
,,Great place to explore,5.0,,"Such an interesting place to visit. All your shopping and souvenirs can be bought here. I would really recommend to go down the side alleys and explore, you could easily spend a full day here, plenty of great places to eat."
,,Worth the time,4.0,,"Choose a cool part of the day. The place for multiple, affordable gifts - 10 solid keychains for $10, 3 sets of brocade purses ditto at $10, ceramics, 'antiques' etc; Balinese clothes, the latest from Thailand and Jakarta and silk things for under $50, semi- precious gem jewelry. Plenty to see and eat, fresh coconut water, Chinese specialties. Not a ripoff place, easy to get to and fair parking. Even locals shop there, and bargaining is still possible. A big area, so wear comfortable shoes and explore also malls nearby."
,,The colours and charm of Singapore Chinatown,5.0,,"Visitors to this little nation state can still get a good feel of the colours and charm of the old Singapore right in its Chinatown . The well organised open open markets with numerous hawkers stalls are forever busy and its a great experience to try out all sorts of food at very very reasonable pricings.Absolutely no need to go to those touristy and pricy Orchard Road for shopping too! Have to be there to really feel the beat and vibrancy of the real old Singapore especially during any festive seasons be it Christmas , New Year, Chinese Lunar New Year, Hari Raya or Deepavali !"
,,Chinatown !,3.0,,"Nice place for stroll around the lanes , which has lots of shops to buy soveiner !
Chinese temple + indian temple ..good architect designed ( Pic)
And good street food around the china town ( awesome good dishes of all varieties - lane dedicated near the Chinese temple + toping up with nice chilled beer :-) !"
,,Good food,5.0,,Simple food and well priced. Sit in the mall/alley not at restaurants unless you want to pay double for the meal. There is a price for the shade. 😃
,,always lovely,5.0,,"Chinatown is one of my favourite places in Singapore. It is always lovely to stroll, eat at the food stalls or in one of the small restaurants (my favourite is Penang cafe), have some beers (which are quite inexpensive compared to usual Singapore standards) with friends and buy little things. During Chinese New Year Chinatown has a wonderfull decoration. I also love to visit the Buddhist temple and its museum or the other temples. Wherever I live, I will always come back to Singapore`s Chinatown!"
,,Cheap! Easy! Fresh! Check it out~!,5.0,,"A lot of ppl are turned off from exploring this area, because they don't speak Chinese, or it looks messy from the outside, or it smells funny? I'm telling you, some of the best, freshest, healthy foods are yours for the consuming if you just give it a look.
Pay attention to what the ppl in front of you keep ordering (often each stall or shop will have a specialty that most ppl go there for), and watch out for food that looks like it was made that morning and nobody has bought all day. It's a small community, ppl talk, if the latest batch of noodles came in a little off ... then they'll know, and be buying bao instead of lunch.
Get a duck one day, get a massive bao one day, get a fresh fruit smoothie.
It's even cheaper than the already excellent Singapore prices, and as long as you're open to trying a couple different things that the locals eat (and don't just get something safe that's put on there only for tourists), you can have a great experience!
cheers~!"
,,Good Fun!,4.0,,Chinatown is hectic...full of colour and activity. Lots of nice shops...and lots of 'Ticky tacky' shops... Lots of Cafes. I liked 'Happy Harry's' for the batik pieces..which I use as tablecloths..and the husband has been Very Pleased with the suit he had 'custom made' there... As well...there are some lovely temples and a beautiful Mosque to visit. And...the nearby Maxwell's 'food court' is well worth a look...for the busy-ness...as well as the Food. All in all...a Fun...Busy place to wander around....
,,One stop shopping,4.0,,"Chinatown, the smells, the sounds, the very essence of Singapore can be found right here in Chinatown, did I mention the shopping, ? well, that is all part of the 'old world charm' that is Chinatown. You can look, buy, smell, touch just about anything you want, right here in this bustling part of Singapore. Don't be slow, give it a go. CHINATOWN - SINGAPORE."
,,One of my favourites,5.0,,I simply love Chinatown. Not just the tourist parts but getting out and wandering around all the side streets. Although we stayed at a very very good hotel my husband and I would wander down to Chinatown at night to do our laundry at People's Park as we could sit and watch the locals playing checkers and mah jong as well as the regular line dancing in the square. I absolutely loved going into the kitchen supply shops and seeing chefs from major hotels in their uniforms looking for odds and sods next to the local street food vendors searching for the equipment they needed. love it.
,,Busy!,4.0,,"So many stalls, so many shops, so many restaurants. It was really busy but so fascinating. The place to go if you wish to purchase oriental goods or you are after some authentic Chinese cuisine."
,,: Dare explore China town behind the screens.,4.0,,"Well worth a visit. But don’t just stop at all the tourist stalls, go beyond them and visit the more local areas. You’ll be rewarded with more experience. The shops here enclose typical Chinese antiques, carvings, pottery, etc. Here one can find both reproductions and genuine items from the past. If you do find something to your liking, bargain!"
,,Love the atmosphere of Chinatown.....,4.0,,"A visit to Singapore would not be complete without visiting its Chinatown. Temples and old chinese buildings, market stalls, make this an area of real character. Good for chinese artifacts,Great place to shop. Sample the street outdoor eateries.excellent food ."
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,"If there is only one place you visit in Singapore make it China Town. My wife and I always manage to go to Singapore during or just before Chinese New Year for our wedding anniversary when it is really humming. Everything and everywhere is decorated depicting the animal of the year to come. This year its the goat. Although China Town is quite a large area its the centre of Mosque Street, Pagoda Street, Temple Street, Smiths Street and Sago Lane with Thengganu Street linking them together that is the most exiting. All the old Shop/Houses are nicely renovated and decorated and with stalls both sides of the street it's a shoppers paradise. A fine wool tailor made suit for $120 (£60), watches 3 for $10 (£5) silk cushion covers $2 (£1) each and a whole variety of clothes, jewellery, souvenirs at rock bottom prices. Smith Street is also called Food Street, for obvious reasons. We ate there every night. Chicken fried rice for $4 (£2) swilled down with fresh pineapple juice. Beware though if you want alcohol its expensive. Even their Tiger beer is $13 a bottle (£6.50) and if you want a whiskey or brandy forget it. At this time of year it does get really crowded to the point of not being able to move at times but that adds to the atmosphere which all visitors and local alike enjoy.
If you want a change then there are five shopping centres in and around China Town Area, enough to keep you shopping for a whole week, as it did us."
,,Great Shopping!!,5.0,,"Great shopping for shoes, handbags and souveniours. China town has a good variety of shopping and unique gift and homewares."
,,Pleasant for a few hours,3.0,,"We quite enjoyed walking around looking at the stalls, despite must of them selling utter rubbish. We also bought a few drinks and a lovely ice cream from a stall at the end of the street.

There is a square & we sat and watched people line dancing - not very Chinese but who cares?? Took up 10mins of our time anyway."
,,Getting ready for Chinese New Year,3.0,,"We visited Chinatown a few days before Chinese New Year at about 7pm and the place was rammed! We fought our way through the crowds to get to Noti Restaurant which was where we had decided to eat. Unfortunately it was Sunday and Noti does not open on Sunday!
The food stalls looked tempting but unfortunately my wife was not keen to risk.it. The place is very colourful and livley"
,,Like most Chinatowns but larger area.,3.0,,"I enjoy Chinatowns wherever I visit in the world.This was not what I expected.The crowds were there but the usual stuff I wanted wasnt.Because it was just prior to Chinese New Year most items were for that ceremony (19-22 feb) everything red (prosperity) for the year of the Goat.I wanted knock of clothing,wallets,bags,CDs ,watches and the stuff markets are made for.There were places selling smallgoods,fruit ,general household food items.Some eateries and bars.However is was a flop for me.Had some Tiger beers to improve the mood but was ripped off a bit.Sellers were offering large bottles for SGD6.95 which on the surface seemed ok.No mention of the ++,service and tax,so final cost was SGD8.25.more gloom.The bottle was 633ml not the standard 750ml.Just needed to get that off my chest.Now,perhaps after New Year the usual fare will return,but I doubt it.This market is just for the Chinese.The pace is frantic.Not for kiddies or oldies."
,,Fun and stimulating experience,4.0,,Went to Singapore with my wife. We came back to Chinatown more than any other place in the city. We loved the Chinese New Year festivities and the food was fantastic on food street. Very safe and clean too!
,,Very diverse Chinatown,4.0,,"The city of Singapore is very diverse which includes Chinatown. One would think that Chinatown would only cater for 1 single population, but they have a Hindu temple and others. This is the place to go when all other eateries are closed at night and you can hangout and get some real Mandarin food."
,,A must visit area of Singapore,5.0,,"This large square of land is full of atmosphere and preserved old buildings. A shoppers paradise providing bargain clothes, toys, bags etc etc and of course - food! The grid system of roads makes it East to negotiate. It also has several religious buildings including Hindu temp,es and mosques. Find a morning to visit and encounter authentic Singapore."
,,"Busy, bustling,crowded",4.0,,"We ate in a small restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. We could have eaten at one of the outside tables but decided it would be a bit cooler inside. We had dim sum, kebabs, fried rice and stir-fried pac choi. The pac choi was delicious just wilted with garlic. There was a really good atmosphere, very lively and vibrant. There are lots of stalls selling everything you can think of. Prices are very reasonable."
,,Run-up to Chinese New Year - a great buzz,4.0,,"Chinatown was getting close to the Lunar New year celebrations, so the place was fairly buzzing with activity, and at the weekend a large number of people were around. Loads of stalls, many focussing on goods for the celebrations, but also those selling more general fare. Some bargains to be found, no doubt, and we were constantly told that the bargains got better as the actual Lunar New year got closer. A great atmosphere and good fun looking around.
Note: access for wheelchairs was probably possible, but on one of the days we were there, I would suggest it would have been hard to navigate a wheelchair through the huge crowds and narrow gaps between stalls."
,,Festival leading up to CNY,4.0,,"Wow. Colour, movement and noise and so many interesting things to look at. Great variety of food stalls and restaurants with the streets closed after 6pm."
,,Interesting and fun,4.0,,"Wandering the back alleys of Chinatown is fun. It's safe and there is an incredible array of Asian goods available. Most is quite cheap. If you enjoy markets and food stalls you can spend quite awhile wandering. As it was lunar new year the place was abuzz and there was a perceptible level of excitement.
If you are visiting Singapore Chinatown is worth the time"
,,Eat yourself silly - and then walk it off . . .,4.0,,"If you are not a timid eater, then Smith Street, at the heart of Singapore's shrinking Chinatown, still offers a dazzling choice in a covered, open-air paved terrace almost half the length of the street. Crowded at weekends - and at lunchtime in the week - you can find live crabs (two ways), fish heads in soup or sauce, beef tripe or tendons, pigs tails and 'fresh' frog porridge - the poor unfortunate amphibians perishing before your eyes before their reincarnation as dainty morsels floating on perfumed congee. Round the corner, a traditional BBQ restaurant offer - amongst other tasty meats - marinated quail, traditional but now very rare. Outside the food choices, there is a plethora of nick-nacks aimed at tourists, such as plastic jade (and some real) bracelets, Chinese name seals, paper cut-outs, and twenty types of peanut and sunflower seed. The odd 24-hour suit or shirt maker survives, along with barbers and less easily identified services on the upper floors for those willing to brave the steep stairs. Despite the crowds, Chinatown's tourist-packed street feel safe and friendly - the brilliantly-lit stalls, and the overhead lanterns for Chinese Lunar New Year dispel all gloom and lend a festive air, Visit the spanking new 'historic' Buddha Relic Temple nearby, or walk slowly north to Clarke Quay and across the Singapore River to Parliament and Downtown areas."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,Nice cultural experience in the middle of the city. Narrow side streets full of life and people.Cheaper restaurant prices and all kinds of nicknacks for sale.
,,Atmospheric,4.0,,"A maze of market stalls, temples and old chinese buildings make this an area of real character. Good for chinese artifacts, food etc. Access via the hop on hop off buses makes visiting this area a doddle. Good for an hour or two."
,,Its a town with not much of China.,2.0,,"Singapore's demographics is approximately 75% Chinese so a Chinatown enclave does not make sense but for the heck of it we decided to drop by. I was disappointed to see a completely sterile area, devoid of the hustle and bustle of the Chinatowns I'm used to in the West. There were not many restaurants to choose from or stores to shop. The streets were mostly empty. I guess most of the shoppers are in Orchard Road. Worst, I saw mostly Indian run stores."
,,Take a walking tour,4.0,,"This is an interesting area especially when you learn the history of it. There were a number of brothels in the area , in fact it was packed with them at the turn of the century . There were gambling houses and all kinds of nefarious activities going on along side medicine shops and barbers in china town . Not any of that here today , but the area is still enchanting and well worth a look ."
,,"shopping, food and architecture",5.0,,"This is the place to shop in Singapore - great choice, low prices. Also, loads and loads of food. Also many preserved old Chinese buildings to see."
,,Must see,5.0,,This is a great China town it's so busy and just fits in . If you are only in Singapore for a short time make sure you go. Great shops and food is amazing. A must see
,,Love it!,5.0,,"The sights, sounds & smells of China Town are stuck in my memory. The market stalls serving freshly cooked food to some really good restaurants. Tip.... If the restaurant is empty or quiet avoid it. Look for the busy one. That means the food is rated good!"
,,Shopping frenzy!,4.0,,"Most of you people visiting Singapore will be looking to take back a lot of souvenirs when you go home , right ? If so, Chinatown is THE PLACE for you. But bear in mind that China town is a relatively large area. So , if you get down at the MRT station and simply wander without knowing where to go, you will only see a lot of malls with shops having expensive pricetags, like the rest of Singapore. This was what happened to me first. After a lot of asking around, I came to know that PAGODA STREET is the area with small shops and market. Actually, you can access PAGODA STREET right from the MRT station, an escalator takes you up and you come out right INSIDE the street. And there, you can browse around for ages. lots of shops selling all sorts of curios, gifts , dresses, electronics. There are also a lot of eateries , where you can try good chinese food at reasonable rates"
,,Not to miss!,4.0,,"China in a confined area! Good to visit! As the little India, shops, restaurants and places to eat! People friendly and easy to reach!"
,,Plenty of bargains and inexpensive food,5.0,,A visit to Singapore would not be complete without visiting its Chinatown. Very busy place all day and night. Browse the shops and stalls for bargains. Excellent local food and inexpensive as well.
,,Browse Chinatown,4.0,,"A good way to spend a morning wandering around, plenty see and so many cheap options for your souvenirs and also eateries."
,,a must see during Chinese New Year period,5.0,,"There is just something about this place during Chinese New year. At first I didn't want to go because I thought it would be too crowded - and yes, it is definitely too crowded. But everyone is so happy and there is so much noise, that to walk around, one already feels happy. We walked down Smith Street and one side is open air and how and the other side with all the food stores is like open air and with air-con. So it is cool and there is a lot of atmosphere when we sit there to eat because there are people announcing programs over the loudspeaker at regular intervals etc. There seems to be a lot going on and overall very festive."
,,Chinatown in February,5.0,,"We ventured in to Chinatown as the Shops, Stalls and Restaurants are all gearing up to Chinese New Year festivities and the whole area is full of red Lanterns and colourful decorations, so if you are in Singapore over the next two weeks call in as it,s great fun"
,,Chinatown,5.0,,"Love the atmosphere of Chinatown, very busy and heaps of bargains, need lots of time to have a good look as you find something cheaper 2 stalls away, no visit to Singapore is complete without visiting here."
,,A good day out,5.0,,Good day out well worth a visit. Sample the street food excellent.also browsing the shops and stalls.
,,Hustle Bustle place,4.0,,"You can find everything from buying groceries to eating of all different provinces in China easily in
Chinatown. Price is unbelievably cheap, not as expensive as anywhere in Singapore. May be because some older generation Chinese believe in treating their customers fair and square so they are willing not to gain maximum profit. A must to visit while in Singapore!"
,,market is a must,4.0,,street market is the kind of place some people love others hate if you like a proper noisy vibrant hectic market visit chinatown in the evening. Also you may be on plastic chairs and tables but the food was great and very reasonable to city prices
,,Awesome place,4.0,,"Chinatown is an awesome place to go...but do not go on friday nights,it is VERY CROWDED!!!!If u go to Chinatown u must go to the ""night market"".It is freaking cool..."
,,Beautiful Lightings & Decorations,5.0,,"Soak in the sight of the beautiful lights & decorations at 2015 Chinatown CNY Bazaar which is spread out across Pagoda, Smith, Temple & Trengganu streets where there is an array of exciting events & colourful street decorations. It is a place to be for Singaporeans & Tourist alike during the Chinese New Year period. The street light up, which features Goat shaped & Gold coin latern to Usher in the year of the goat is a crowd puller. Walking along the streets mentioned, one can find street vendors stock up traditional CNY items such as decorative wall hangings, lanterns, tidbits, red packets, waxed meats & name painting etc. One can also have food"
,,Must visit,4.0,,The main road was decorated with goats as the Chinese New Year was fast approaching. Plenty of shopping possible. Lively little streets as well.
,,Celebrations in Chinatown,5.0,,"We had the good fortune to visit Chinatown for the opening celebrations of the Lunar New Year. It was a thriving mass of people, food stalls and amazing energy. Our Singaporean friend guided us through the throngs, for tastes of pork, nuts ( macadamias of all varieties), duck and the BEST barbecue chicken wings I have ever devoured, accompanied by spicey green beans and a cold Tiger beer. What more could you ask for?
The decorations and lights were a dazzling spectacle and the family groups enjoying the evening were numerous. What fun!"
,,Very interesting place,5.0,,"This was a difficult place to find using the subways because there are always multiple ways to exit from the underground and not all of them lead to Chinatown. Thankfully a gentleman who overheard us looking in vain for Chinatown directed us to where we needed to go (in the opposite direction we were heading) and he walked us there, and even took a picture of all of us! Chinatown was so interesting with street and street, running parallel to each other, of vendors and food places. We found all the typical thinks there, buying fans and brocade jewelry rolls, and even found an artist who used to be a pig farmer but lost the farm to big business. His art was fantastic and we bought quite a lot from him. Chinatown is a protected area, nobody can buy up lots and build skyscrapers here so it retains the charm of old Singapore. If you eat here, make sure you choose a place that is busy, locals know where the good food is and avoid the empty places, they are empty for a reason!"
,,Blessed with lots of foods and Chinese desserts,3.0,,"Chinatown is no new to no one, and as the name suggest it's a Chinese community area. The moment you get out from Chinatown MRT station, it's packed and you hardly find the space to linger around but to keep walking. There are many stalls(foods and drinks) just outside of the station and you won't be able to resist temptation, at least not me. Tried a few drinks and their Chinese desserts are pretty good which cost from $2-$4. They had plenty of dimsum place as well. I can't remember the store that I went as it was written in Chinese. Pretty good stuff. It cost us about $30 for 3 people. Ain't too bad. Only downside that it's so crowded, I got a fuzzy head after a short while there."
,,Good food and beer,4.0,,"One of the best places in Singapore to eat Chinese dumplings and sip on cheap beer. Some Chinese eateries have $6.95 633ml Tiger beers! A bargain in Singapore!
Don't be afraid to eat outside or in outdoor eateries. The food is good. Singapore has strict food standards.
A shopping mall is nearby. A famous Hawker center by the name of Lau pa sat is a 15 minute walk from Chinatown MRT. I would highly recommend it for those who want to experience great Singaporean food and atmosphere."
,,Getting Ready for the New Year!,4.0,,"Great place to shop, lots of cheap junk around. Also some very nice shops.

the area is currently getting ready for the Chinese New Year celebrations beginning February 19th, so lots of very colorful sights.

Good, cheap food available, check out the food court. I had a head cold, and sought out the soup stands. Really good, cheap food."
,,Fun place to visit,4.0,,Walking around this area had a great atmosphere and gave you a good feeling of the past only a short distance from the modern. Good place to spend a few hours to look for the somthing different. You must pop into one of the temples and pay respect.
,,"Ok, but not top of the list",3.0,,Worthwhile if you're after very cheap rubbish type trinkets. Good yum cha and other Chinese available. Cheap but effective massages available also.
,,Best Durian Fruit,4.0,,"What fun to see the Chinese Temple, market, and food hawker/stall. Durian fruit has a bad smell and never liked by many. The durian in Chinatown was the most delicious we've ever had. Pricey but worth it. Fun shops for souvenirs and was happy not haggle (like Hong Kong). Shop keepers did their best to speak English. If In Singapore, take the time for Chinatown and please try amazing durian:)"
,,Great food,5.0,,Great selection of food and reasonably priced. Free WiFi for the traveller. Loads of stalls to walk round.
,,An OK Experience,3.0,,"We toured the stalls and purchased a hat to keep some of the intense sun at bay. The market area had a good range of items from things you never knew you needed to cheap and cheerful. All ok, but nothing different from other similar markets around the world."
,,See what the Chinese New Year in Chinatown offers!,4.0,,"It's the year of the Goat (2015) and South Bridge Road is teeming with dozens of the animals (paper and wire ones that will light up at night!). The stalls on Temple Street offer all kinds of new year sweets and dried fruits ,and are set up a few weeks before the Chinese New Year celebrations!
Be sure to visit Smith Street where the food-stalls have reopened after a year long hiatus( for a complete overhaul). Some of the ""organic ambience"" has been removed, it is ""cleaner and tidier"". I am sure the food is good, but I prefer the ""earthiness"" of the old hawker stalls.
Look for Bee Cheng Hiang barbequed pork and ""pork floss"" on South Bridge Road.. A Singapore treat !
Try to get to Chinatown on week nights . Expect crowds on weekends.
Gong Xi Fa Cai!"
,,A fascinating & truly authentic China Town,5.0,,"So easy to get to on public transport. Compact & easy to navigate, this China Town is fascinating. Browse the various stalls & shops (beware of hard sell store keepers) or eat at one of the dozens & dozens of totally authentic restaurants from every region in China & beyond. Great prices too compared to downtown."
,,Fantastic food,4.0,,we walked from our hotel Furama not too far. the food is super and so cheap have not gotten so much for doing little anywhere else
,,vibrant,5.0,,"Food stalls - having mainly been to Bali, we were not sure what the street food would be like, but it is excellent - never had a bad meal, always tasty, and cheap in comparison to many other places. No smells, or rubbish in the streets.
Food is done quickly, then grab a beer, and a table on the street.
Market stalls - Singapore is an expensive place, so we were surprised to find that the stalls were quite cheap, with many ""3 for $10"" deals. Like any stalls, some stuff is rubbish, but most is good quality for the price.
Great atmosphere, and recommended."
,,Super friendly super safe,5.0,,Visited here intending to just walk through and ended up staying hours. Great food and such a wonderful ambiance with people happy to share and give an insight into their culture. The sights sounds and smells will stay a long time. Haggle for bargains on the stalls and shop around for great bargains to be had.
,,"Food, glorious, food",5.0,,"We visit Chinatown almost each and every time we visit Singapore but this time around we were with a local who pointed out places of interest and gave us tips as to where to find the best bargains and eating places. Chinatown is best place to buy toiletries, canned goods, laundry and cleaning stuff as they are at least 30% lower than in grocery stores. Also good place to buy local delicacies and snacks and souvenirs to take back home at very reasonable prices. Clean and orderly place, quite accessible via MRT but there are also ample parking spaces if coming by private car. Not to be missed is the nearby Maxwell hawker center for some of the best Hainanese chicken rice."
,,Getting ready for Chinese New Year,4.0,,"If you want to see China Town then go before or during Chinese New Year. The market stall's are decorated with amazing Chinese Red lanterns, and many more decoration not normally seen throughout the year only now. Bargains to be had, but shop around first and barter you can get knocked down prices. The place is packed with locals and tourist, and the atmosphere is something to be experience. Older Chinese don't always understand English, but they do understand your money so will always be ready to sell. If you want traditional Chinese hawker food then there are plenty of places, but remember it is not Western taste Chinese probably what you are use to, so ask what it is first. This year is the year of the goat so the decorations related to the goat, with different size models and stuffed toys of goats. Behind the stall's there are still old Chinese building to photograph and reminds me of living here in the 80's, but modernisation had to come, but you can still feel the atmosphere and a must to visit."
,,I cannot find the words to accurately describe the markets of China town....,5.0,,"During our 13 Day stay in Singapore we visited the china town markets about 5 times... Spending a minimum of 2 hours there each visit.
We were all hooked on the atmosphere that the markets had as well as the bargains (So much in the 3 for $10 deal!!!) But also the bartering (while unsuccessful alot) was incredibly fun

This was one of my fave things about Singapore,
if you are a shopper (Like Me) IT IS A MUST!!

P.s. be careful not to be ripped off in regards to prices, we were a few times haha :p"
,,Lots of bargains here,4.0,,A very worthwhile visit for shopping and eating. Lots of bargains and excellent selection of eating locations for lunch or dinner. Walking through China town is a great way to spend a weekend afternoon.
,,Food,4.0,,"1 word.. food

Lots of cheap delicious food
Night market also quite fun.
Cheap stuff. Rare stuff you cant find in a mall.
Love hawkers food..

Carefull if you cant speak Chinese. Some of the old seller cant speak english. So dont get offended by their gesture.

Just think that they DO sell good food. And THAT'S what you're after."
,,Great atmosphere!,4.0,,"Visited here as part of a tour group one night where we got our names written on red fans and had a 7 course meal in a restaurant. The food was surprisingly good! After dinner, the whole group got on trishaws 2 by 2 for a thrilling ride through the markets and little laneways. Thoroughly enjoyable! Also visited by day where the dirt shows up a bit more...but the place has a great atmosphere and is always busy!
Didn't buy anything except a bottle of water but the myriad stalls are full of all sorts of wonders.
We were lucky enough to visit on the lead up to Chinese new year so the streets and shops and stalls are decorated in red and gold for as far as the eye can see :)"
,,A good cheap experience in a very expensive city,3.0,,"While Singapore is an expensive city(comparatively) to visit, the China Town area is not only a great experience for travellers but also provides a fantastic night food market. Street stalls provide an array of meals at really cheap prices which allows tourists to spend a night out in Singapore and keep within their travel budget.

The shopping markets are not what you might expect which is the only reason that an average score is recorded here.

This it China Town via taxi from any CBD hotel. Very centrally located."
,,All set up for New Year,4.0,,Beautiful displays of coins suspended over the roadways and many silk goats for the coming New Year. Food is plentiful and fun to check out. Many vendors offering their wares. Don't pay regular prices as bartering is expected. Sample little cookies-I loved the almond! Great way to spend some time. Take your camera
,,Most amazing street food in the world,5.0,,"Vibrant, clean, safe, with the best street food in the world and not expensive! This is best visited in the evening to fully appreciate the great atmosphere"
,,Singapore's Chinatown Trishaw Night Tour,5.0,,"What a fabulous tour!!
Start by being picked up from your hotel, head into Chinatown, get a red fan painted with your name in Calligraphy, then roam around the markets for a while, meet back up at the restaurant for dinner, and you get fed WELL!!! Very yummy Chinese dinner, head to the trishaws, which is such an experience and a laugh!! The trishaws take you to where you board the bum boats for a river cruise, all the best sights are from that river, then transfer back to your hotel, a total of four hours, and value for money was incredible!"
,,Not a outstanding Chinatown,3.0,,"Very disappointing. Too many stalls selling junk to tourists. Not the genuine article. Having said that there were two places we were glad we went.
1. Buddha Tooth relic temple. Very impressive, beautifully designed and maintained. A real experience.
2. Eu Yan Sang, 260 South Bridge Road, for high quality wild ginseng, at good prices. A beautiful store just to wander around, even if nothing catches your eye. Its right there when one alight's from the HOPO bus."
,,"A bit touristy, but it's still a good time.",4.0,,"Pretty much what you'd expect with lots of things to buy, and lots of things to eat. Nice way to spend a sunny afternoon."
,,Chinese New Year,4.0,,"With all the decorations currently being displayed in readiness for Chinese New Year next month (year of the goat), a trip through Chinatown is highly recommended.

We went down there one evening, ate some heavenly satays and then after a wander through the many stalls/shops, eventually managed to get a taxi (not easy!!!) and had a slow drive to take in the wonderful array of vivid red decorations and the many illuminated goats- quite spectacular and well worth the effort.

If possible, try to co-ordinate your trip with Chinese New Year, or just before so that as well as the scrumptious food you get the opportunity to see the wonderful decorations; simply unbelievable!"
,,Vibrant,5.0,,Lots of stalls selling just about everything. Many food outlets under a covered street. Two interesting temples
,,Something for everyone here,5.0,,"Especially food. Don't miss Maxwell Hawker Centre during the day and Boon Tat Street , behind Lau Pa Sat, comes alive at night and turns into satay heaven after 7pm."
,,Friendly!,5.0,,"Chinatown is the place to go in Singapore for tourists. There is a lot of history and art here. The people around here have so much respect for the other races, cultures, and religions living with them in the city. Food and shops are amazing-be careful with the cheap stuff they sell, it will break : ). Very cool area, and it doesn't take long to check out! Right next to the mtr so if it doesn't interest you, no harm! Get back on the train!"
,,"Great place to shop for souvenirs, but be wary of the anglicised chinese food shops.",4.0,,"This is a great place to buy your chinese souvenirs. Loads of shops to choose from, and nice cheap prices. Keep following your nose and follow the market around. There are heaps of places to buy souvenirs from. There are also hidden museums in this area, that I would recommend you make time to do. Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to enjoy them, and will have to go back to see those little museums. Be wary of some of the food shops though. Don't make the mistake that I did, and make sure you go somewhere that was packed. I went somewhere , and it had the worst duck pancakes I've EVER eaten! Make this part of your singapore trip."
,,Great Night Market,4.0,,Chinatown has a great night market that is very colorful and extremely popular. Get there early enough to have a look around Chinatown and then do the market later. Great food and items to buy.
,,Fun Atmosphere,4.0,,We enjoyed Chinatown for it's atmosphere. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed browsing and shopping for souvenirs which were well priced and plentiful. The food stalls and restaurants were varied and good value also. Glad we stayed within walking distance. Great to do at night.
,,Chinese New Year Chinatown,5.0,,"Best time to visit this attraction as all Chinese will be celebrating Chinese New Year. With all stalls out in full force to peddle their wares, you can be assured of the vibrancy of this area. Do soak in all the festive atmosphere and try out all the crackers and cookies (free sample) Notables ones like ""Chi Gu"",""Love Letters "" etc...Those with toddlers, do not bring the baby pram as it is very difficult to maneuver. As it may be extremely crowded this season, wear a pair of shoes just in case someone accidently step on your feet. Be wary of pickpockets and place all wallet in front of your pockets, prevention is better than cure (low crime doesn't mean no crime).Walk to the streets like Pagoda and Temple and have fun!"
,,Colourful but overpriced,3.0,,"A must see place in Singapore, colourful and full of character but be warned, food there can be expensive. There are other places in Singapore you can have authentic Chinese food less expensive. Also watch your drinks, beer served in restaurants adds to your bill, sometimes a lot."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"Chinatown different, very clean and organized and with lots of movement and decoration. the ideal place to buy souvenirs."
,,Shoppers dream,5.0,,"Our hotel was in Chinatown and we made the most of it.
Shopping for souvenirs is amazing - their is literally shops everywhere with bargains galore at very reasonable prices. Just make sure you do your numbers and ensure you get a good deal on larger purchases - i.e. cameras etc.... - it is easy to get carried away in the moment !!???
Food is cheap and very tasty - if possible try something different to excite your tastebuds!!!
We always felt very safe and the locals where always very polite and helpful.
Just make sure you have room in your case for all your purchases!!!"
,,Great atmosphere.,5.0,,We went to china town for the second time. The 1st time was 18 years ago. Although it had changed a lot it was still a great place to visit. We had lovely street food and bought some gifts that were real bargains. I recommend everyone who visits Singapore should pay Chinatown a visit. The only down side was getting a taxi to take us back to our hotel. Most of them refused because it wasn't a big enough fare.

,,Night Market and Food Street at night,4.0,,"Singapore is well rich in cultural diversity. Chinatown and Little India are two places one must visit in Singapore for an explorer apart from the city. Chinatown street market and food street is very informal place for goods and foods. I must say, come here to buy souvenirs such as bags, pens, T-shirts, key tags with Merlion and so much more Singaporean souvenirs.
I visited it as night and it was beautiful as well as colourful at night.
Probably the cheapest prices in Singapore."
,,Must on the list :),5.0,,"Chinatown is a bustling mix a old and new, filled with traditional shops and night markets. Cheap eats and souvenirs :) Go enjoy !!"
,,ChinaTownn,5.0,,"Very cheap and great food with many options.Near by some interesting shop for souvenir and clothes,etc."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,Awesome town! Best prices and a good feel of their culture while walking around. They have a great alley food court with many options for food
,,Excellent way to while away a few hours.,4.0,,"Well laid out with interesting shops and excellently preserved buildings and history. Visit a Buddhist temple, Hindu temple and Islamic Mosque all within 5 minutes walk from each other!"
,,Loved Chinatown,5.0,,Great place for souvenirs and clothing. Also cheap great food and beer. Can eat in the open or pay a little more to dine in one of the restaurants. Singapore can be very expensive so this was a nice relief to the pocket. You can there easily on the MRT or taxi.
,,Best prices in Singapore,3.0,,"I hate Singapore and everything about it, especially the prices. The most over priced dump in Asia. Chinatown is the only place you can buy something, eat and have a drink without having to re-mortgage your house. If you fancy paying 15 sing dollars for a beer go to Clarke quay. If you want to pay 6 dollars, go to Chinatown. Plus Tons of markets and to eat.

Best place and best prices in Singapore!"
,,Average tourist destination,2.0,,"History of China town seemed to be overshadowed by shops selling cheap junk, which made it hard to navigate and apreciate the environment."
,,Good place for shopaholics,3.0,,"Definitely worth a visit. Recommended to go by SIA airlines hop on bus. Heaps of bargains to be had if you know what you are looking for. You will need to look around. I found it relaxing and enjoyable.

Tip - sunscreen , sunhat, comfortable shoes and a good eye for a bargain"
,,Average Chinatown,3.0,,"This is just another average market, nothing special. Guy writing names in Chinese tried to rip us off, which was poor by Singapore standards. Wouldn't really visit here again."
,,A 'must see'.,4.0,,We made an evening visit to experience Chinatown after dark. It did not disappoint. There are lots of stalls selling tourist tat as well as nicer souvenirs. We ate street food in Smith Street which was very cheap and had a great atmosphere. We were lucky enough to find the Buddhist Temple of the Tooth Relic had a service going on and we were allowed to stand at the back and observe.
,,Fun time,4.0,,"Use the hop on hop off bus service to get around. If you fly Singapore airlines, its only $8 per head for 24 hours on their every 20 min service. China town has many cheap tourist trinkets as do other places in Singapore. We had shirts made to order in three hours and had them delivered to the hotel. You will battle for sizes if you are normal average westerners. Visit the temple too and the main shopping mall. Plenty for sale including electronics and jewellery."
,,Great food options,4.0,,"If you're looking for budget eating options, go no further. They are all here in Singapore's Chinatown. Apart from many shops selling all kinds of flea market fare, there are many restaurants, either small food stalls, takeaways or a la carte, providing quite a budget-friendly and very tasty eating options. I found Chinatown with more atmosphere than Little India and would recommend anyone visiting it."
,,Fun bustling lively place with prices that invite you to buy!,4.0,,"Confession: 5 mins into Chinatown and we had to find an ATM (located inside the chinatown MRT station) as we were being lured by the prices on stuff like souvenirs, artificial jewellery, shoes, iPhone covers etc. I find this place offers best value for money and you can come home with enough knick knacks as well as gifts for family and neighbours! The streets are narrow and colourful. We took a cab as we were returning from the zoo (no MRTS) but it is easily accessible by the MRT. Great for a walk-through, shopping and eat-out.
Restroom is inside MRTS but not as clean as you'd like."
,,Chinese culture and bargain shopping!,4.0,,"I used the hop on, hop off bus whilst in Singapore and hopped off to explore Chinatown. It is a bustling hive of activity where you are able to buy a range of souvenirs and inexpensive Asian food. I loved the atmosphere and enjoyed visiting the shops where I could browse without being hassled to buy which occurred constantly in Little India. The souvenirs were often the same in most shops and the prices are very similar so if you see something I'd recommend buying it without shopping around. 3 for $10 is a very popular selling tool here!"
,,Fantastic food,5.0,,Great food - particularly on the walking street. We went back three days in a row. Easy accessible via the metro or the hop on hop off busses.
,,Organic vegetarian restaurant in Singapore china town,5.0,,"If you are not meaty meals in Singapore's China Town, go to Temple Street and look for: 1) Chan Chan Heng coffee shop Yi Xin organic vegetarian 2) Buddha Tooth Relic Temple's LG level vegetarian restaurant"
,,Chinese culture,3.0,,"I had went to Chinatown for few times. There are clothes shops, stalls selling sovenier, Chinese culture museum, restaurants etc. Most of the sovinier items come from China. Some shops selling similar things. A lot of tourists here. There will be crowded during weekend."
,,Great place for souvenirs and local food,5.0,,"This place is a paradise to get souvenirs at a reasonable rate. We went their thrice in our six day visit. The rates are comparatively cheaper than other places. Trust me if you don't buy souvenirs from here, you will end up paying 15 times more for the same thing.

You can try local food as well and for those who are burger freaks, they have McDonald's as well.

Girls - you will love to street shop here as they have plenty of neckpieces, hand bags (non-branded) and other stuffs at good price.

Suggestion-
1) First, explore this place as different shops will have different price for the same stuff.
2) If you are taking MRT to Chinatown, take the exit to Pagoda Street. This will directly take you to the shops.

Cheers,
Shilpi"
,,3 for 10$ craze,4.0,,"most of the shops in chinatown will sell souvenirs 3 for 10$. lot of fridge magnets, key chains, luggage tags can be bought from there. Even Wifi is available for free in chinatown. People should visit if you want to give something at your home after singapore visit. Asian food is easily available. Money exchange shops are also available."
,,Full of Chinese tradition,3.0,,A nice place for shopping and a hugh food market for providing excellent local cuisine. There are various different religion temples for visits.
,,Secret Shops and Tasty Food,4.0,,"Lots of things to shop, but for those looking for something special, there's a Tintin store right beside one of MRT Station exits. Also if you explore further, there are some specialty stores like a Lomography toy camera shop.

For food, there's plenty of good chinese food in the area. speciafically the grilled stingray!"
,,Great place for new visitors to Singapore,5.0,,"Not sure if the locals love it, but for someone who's new to Asia and new to Singapore, this place is a haven! Great atmosphere, lots of culture and just so different to the CBD, Orchard Road and financial district areas. A must visit for all first-time visitors to Singapore!"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Def worth a visits while in Singapore good selection of restart to eat in and quite resonably priced also good selection of souvenir shops which seemed more resonably priced than the rest of Singapore
,,GREAT VIBE,5.0,,"Chinatown's arguably the best precinct in Singapore. Fantastic food is on offer at hawker's stands within all of its shopping complexes. All have been rated and display their rating either A or B. We ate at mostly ""B"" stands and did not have any problems. It's proximity to trendy Duxton Hill and rows and rows of gorgeous shophouses enhance the area. The Chinatown MRT is well serviced and offers a ticket office for easy purchase of your 1/2/3 day pass. There is hustle and bustle and fewer tourists than other precincts which makes it feel more of a true experience of Singapore's culture."
,,The cleanest Chinatown you'll ever find!,4.0,,"The main street - Smith street - which has lots of food stalls etc was a good place to eat for under $10SGD. A lg btl of Tiger beer was $8SGD.

After an expensive meal in Clarke Quay, we ate here for our remaining dinners and each time the food was very good. There's also plenty of low priced souvenirs and browsing or shopping in this extremely clean Chinatown."
,,An average Chinatown,3.0,,"I'll rate it as an average Chinatown. Souvenir prices are fixed, can't even negotiate at all. Hey, the food around here is quite high. I would recommend to walk a little further to the FoodCourt...more varieties and much cheaper and tasty, too. Here's a place to get some Oriental souvenirs. A place for photography, too...lots of old but refurbished buildings. The visit to the Chinatown Heritage was quite interesting, though. Lots of antiques n history, too."
,,Bad smell & Rude shop keepers,1.0,,Visited this place twice but never had good experience. Shopping is not that cheap here. But every where there is a small of poke and bit dirty keeping standard of singapore in mind. Shop keepers are very rude. Bought charger he charged for original but gave bad quality and when I asked to exchange he is very rude.
,,Retained its Charm.,5.0,,"First went to China town over 24 years ago and it still has all the charm it had then. Food is excellent and from expensive to very cheap, I had rice, chicken, veg, soup and pickles for £3.00 you cant beat that."
,,Chinatown Trishaw Night Tour,5.0,,We were in Singapore for 24hrs and wanted to see / experience as much as we could. We have zoo's and theme parks back home so we chose this tour for the variety. It was amazing and worth every cent! We met some great people of all different ages. This tour was the highlight of our trip to Singapore.
,,Shoppers + Foodie's delight,5.0,,"This is undoubtedly a shopaholic's delight.. Being used to Singapore's high prices this is a big relief for those wanting to take back souvenirs.. Once you exit the metro you alight on Temple Street which is lined with shops on both side selling more or less similar stuff, but of good quality. The package deals (5 for S$ 10) are worth the money.
The food street is parallel to this street and is a foodie's delight. One can find any kind of cuisine here made with great hygiene at very reasonable prices. Tourists flock here in the evenings and it is like a street carnival.
To do justice to Chinatown one needs a full half day."
,,Busy yet nice and awesome street,4.0,,Chinatown is really quite an awesome place especially there are food and cultural attractions there... one popular cultural attraction is the buddhist temple located right outside the chinatown complex. The building is filled with histories and also intricate designs on the walls. The Chinatown complex has lots of delicious food that you can get on the 2nd floor.
,,How it's suppose to be,4.0,,"My hostel Toast & Pillow Heritage was located in chinatown (38, Upper Cross Street). Its chinatown how it's suppose to be. The food prices are a little high, it starts from S$5,- for a decent meal. You can also find some typical Chinese souvenirs. If you plan to go to Chinatown in Singapore take a look inside the Buddha tooth relic temple. I suggest to visit Chinatown when you have time enough in Singapore, it is not a must do."
,,Good Ol' Chinatown,4.0,,"Well, just like a Chinatown in my imagination, the Chinatown in Singapore is bustling with people speaking loudly in Chinese or its dialects. There are lots of tourists, so many food centers (with really really good food), stuff to sell (sometimes weird ones) and even though Singapore is a relatively safe country, it's good to be alert in Chinatown. I do like sightseeing and picture taking. The MRT station is nicely located so that you can go to any direction and see many places."
,,Fantastic Shopping - Chinatown,4.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is directly accessible by the MRT and is a great place to pick up knick-knacks. Of course everything has a fixed price, but then some hard bargain are also called for. Food is not as cheap as other places and a lot of it is just seafood."
,,Remnants of old Singapore,5.0,,"I highly recommend a visit to Chinatown, so that you can get a glimpse of old Singapore.
It's a great place to find reasonably priced souvenirs to take home.
Also, if you are interested in alternative medicine, this is the place to buy traditional Chinese medicinal herbs or get a reflexology massage."
,,Colourful area with bargains galore,5.0,,"Colourful area of the city with shops of all descriptions selling goods at knockdown prices (i.e. 5 t-shirts for S$10 or UK£5). There are also a couple of Chinese and Indian temples to be seen amongst the old chop-shops and more modern buildings. The sights, sounds and smells are a feast to the senses."
,,"Chinatown, great shopping, but be aware of the tax reclaim.",4.0,,"I really enjoyed shopping here and had a great time picking up gifts for Christmas, there seems to be everything in Chinatown, from clothing to toys to fridge magnets, and many other items so my Christmas shopping was done within a couple of hours and this year everyone got at least one present which was different from what they would normally see from my shopping trips in the U.K. It is up to you whether you want to spend a lot of money or not too much and I did a bit of both. I did not try out any of the food stands but it all looked very good to me.

A colourful place, took quite a lot of photos and generally had a good time. Highly recommended and got to and from there on the tourist buses so no need for taxis.

BUT - be aware of the rules concerning tax and the reclaim of the Sales Tax, which the jeweller told me can be claimed back at the airport on leaving the country, so long as you have the receipts,he used this as part of his sales pitch, but what he did not tell me was that you have to have a form which you obtain and fill out before going to the airport, I learned that part of it at the tax reclaim desk in the airport itself, by which time it was too late to do anything about it.
A polite and non - accusatory e mail to the merchant concerned has gone unanswered.

Fortunately there was not a great deal of money involved so it didn't spoil the experience but I would like to make others aware of this and if anyone can give more details of the procedures I'm sure that would help too."
,,A definitive place to go,4.0,,"As the largest ethnic group in Singapore is Chinese, Chinatown is considerably less of an enclave than it once was. The district does retain significant historical and cultural significance. The place has a lot of shops, restaurants, and houses are nices."
,,Worth a Visit :),5.0,,A very cheap but excellent culinary treat. Great food in modest surroundings but an excellent experience. Cost in sharp contrast to Singapore's more trendy destinations. Great to catch some cheap food and drink with an opportunity for souvenir shopping!
,,Wonderful market and temple tour,5.0,,"Good:
1. cheap items stands for Singapore.
2. Lots of stores selling various kinds of items => beef jerky
3. Wondeful temples (Hindu) => Sri Mariamman Temple
You can enjoy Hindu culture at Singapore.
4. Icecream with bread in front of Sri Mariamman Temple
Unique experience. But taste was nothing special.

Bad
1. food: too strong chinese spice. We could not eat any food at chinese town local restaurant."
,,Make it a stop on the hop-on hop-off tour - and have lunch!,5.0,,"When in Singapore and on a hop-on hop-off tour, be sure to stop in Chinatown. Browse, people watch, and find an amazing place for lunch. There are dozens of excellent lunch and shop options. Go enjoy."
,,An exciting Bazaar,4.0,,"We visited Chinatown on a very pleasant cloudy December morning and started our trip with a visit to Buddha's Tooth Temple. a very serene place with soothing chants and aromatic agarbatis.
The various streets of Chinatown were having attractive, no-so-expensive gift items. A large collection with concessions offered for buying 3 or more similar items at a time. One can collect items such as key chains, magnetic paintings, bags, purses, toys, fancy stationary, ceramic items and much more for friends back home.
Chinatown has a food street where one can have freshly pre pared food at reasonably low price.
There is a Indian Temple and a Mosque. One can spend entire forenoon shopping and end with a nice meal in the food street. A must visit while in Singapore."
,,love Chinatown,5.0,,"Too bad our tour guide only gave us under an hour to shop...this place is so big, you need hours...This place was so fascinating...didn't know what direction to go and what to buy first, but I did manage to help the economy...silk fans, purses. silk kimonas, a Merlion, Singapores national icon, the popular Tiger Balm, wallets, and more...."
,,Pleasantly surprised,4.0,,"Browsing through lanes of craft goods, fashion & what nots etc. is not something I normally would commit a lot of time too & as the norm I didn't plan to this time either, but I found myself pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed myself as we wandered up & down the numerous lanes often chatting to merchants & grabbing a few bargains in what was a beautifully presented and welcoming part of this great city"
,,A place which must be in your itinerary,4.0,,"This is a place which must be in your itinerary because of below reasons.
1. Easy accessable to get there (by MRT or many bus services)
2. Many souvenirs with cheap and affordable price
3. Clothes with cheap and fair price
4. Colonial style buildings
5. Many nice foods to try (a lot of Sichuan Authentic foods)
6. Clean and well organized
7. Close to another top destination ""Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum"
,,Singapore perfection?,5.0,,"Singapore's Chinatown is probably one of the most organised and well restored in the world.
Not at all chaotic, something at least I seem to note of most Chinatowns I've been to. It's nice
To walk around , lots of restaurants, some decades old, some new and more tourist types. Many
Massage shops and spas as well souvenir shops and trinkets. Definitely worth a visit, at least half a day! Lovely old restored town houses to admire as well!"
,,little china in singapore,5.0,,"it is a great experience going here, wonderful architecture, wonderful food and until now i still curious the taste of tian tian chicken rice, every time i got there the queue is like hell"
,,Good clothes shopping,3.0,,"Very hot day when we visited but normal for Singapore, Picked up some nice clothing but the rest of the stalls sell the same as we get in Australia in Cheapie shops and we can get cheaper at home. Every stall just about pounces on you as soon as you even think about taking a look. In saying that it is worth a look, the streets are pretty with hanging flowers. Watch your possessions in stall areas."
,,Welcome to little china,5.0,,"Singapore population is heavy composed by chinese people, so you can figure out how authentic Singapore Chinatown is. There you will find food, art, culture and lots of souvenirs to buy. Dont miss."
,,Clean Chinatown that shows you another side of Chinese,4.0,,"I've been to many other Chinatowns in the world (mostly in the US), and this is one of the cleanest. Enjoy the food, temples, the museums, the trinkets and Fine$ Singapore T shirts if that's your thing. A visitor commented that the food isn't so much Chinese as it is Singapore, which is an inaccurate statement. Singapore is very much an ethnic Chinese society. Most of the street food that is the staple diet of locals are Chinese dishes - char kway teow, fishball noodles, bak chor mee (minced pork noodles), carrot cake, bak kut teh, the list is endless. The Chinese food here is Singapore Chinese food. Of course it's vastly different from northern Chinese food in Beijing. Southern Chinese food is very vastly different from northern Chinese. Singapore Chinese culture/food is derived from southern Chinese culture/food. Which in itself has variations in mainland southern, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia."
,,A Must On The List,4.0,,"If by chance you get to visit any country at all, you have to go to Chinatown. In Singapore I'd say it's a great experience. It's clean. Aside from the shops, I go here for the food. You just have to find a seat then choose the food that you want to eat. I went back here because of the chendol but also tried other food selections. A must try."
,,Get down to Chinatown!!,5.0,,"Such a great morning out. Great people watching, markets were bustling and interesting and there were loads of new and exciting foods to try. Lots and lots of cheap Singapore souvenirs too!"
,,Authentic,4.0,,we love singapore Chinatown. We eat at the hawkers centre then wonder through the streets . Many things to purchase if your looking for a bargin. We will return again in March before another cruise
,,A Chinese Heritage,5.0,,"Migrants of Chinese origin gathered here and started their lives here while settling as coolies on the Singapore River.

A Chinatown Heritage centre has been set up whereby it depicts the lives of these settlers. A small fee of S$20 is payable for admission.

Majority of the shophouses have been turned into restaurants and lots of souvenirs shops to offer you Chinese souveniurs in every street.

There is also a high rise hawker centre in our housing development board where all sorts of hawker fare are offered.

Chinatown is reachable by mrt, bus or taxi."
,,Good shopping and lots of food outlets,4.0,,"Good shopping for cheap souviner items etc ,lots of variety and prices differ .Its clean and I found the shop owners to not hound you.Good for gold jewellery etc."
,,Interesting Area,4.0,,Has a wide range of shopping and some really good Restaurants particualy Smith Street with quality food and all are very clean at reasonable prices. You can buy almost anything from heaps of gift items to clothing jewellery perfume electronics etc. we enjoyed China Town and visited a cople of times during our stay. We will visit again when we return to Singapore
,,China Town in Singapore Style,4.0,,"It is mainly for shopping and food. But in terms of shopping, it is not really so ""Chinese"". It basically sells selected products from China at a much higher price that cannot reflect the true Chinese culture. For food, the cost is low and hygiene is satisfactory. Instead of selling Chinese food, it is more in Singapore style and is a good place to experience Singapore local dishes."
,,Best place to buy gold jewellery,5.0,,"Was looking for gold charm & coins, found large selection at many jewellers all around Chinatown. Bought merlion charm, gold coin & frame for coin, all at different shops. All gold sold based on real gold price & weight, very transparent system & nice products."
,,Nice to shop & great clean street food,4.0,,Lots of stores with interesting stuff from fridge magnets to ties to oriental fans. Rates vary wildly. So make sure you go to a number of them before bargaining. There is an excellent food area right in the middle serving up some really delicious food at very nominal rates. The crabs are especially delicious.
,,Chinatown Food Centre,4.0,,"Chinatown Food Centre, a place for cheap and delicious food. Singapore's modern Chinatown has many old charms in this food centre. Your guideline to good food would be the newspaper cuttings and posters of food critics' recommendations displayed at the stalls. Look around and discover who's who. Many of them speak English and when you can strike a short conversation with them, you will be amazed Some of the food sellers are retired chefs from restaurants and international hotels. Bon appetit!!"
,,"Food, jewellery, tourist goods it's all here",5.0,,"Don't miss a visit to China Town. The vendors don't annoy you like it some countries, they are actually helpful. A typical market experience with lots of stalls to browse through and plenty of excellent food and refreshments on offer when you get hot or tired after a feverish session of shopping or just browsing. Much cheaper than Orchard Road but watch out for fake goods unless that is what you are after."
,,My Jerky Place,3.0,,"I first visited Singapore for a college field trip about ten years ago and was recently there last November. Have seen significant changes and still, nonetheless, very expensive... although Starbucks is roughly the same. I always hunt down my favorite Jerky in Chinatown - and that's my main purpose of going there, followed by getting souvenirs. I was just amazed, some people didn't actually speak English so getting lost in the little streets there would be difficult if you'll ask around. I suggest keep your GPS available."
,,Loved it!,4.0,,I'm on holiday visiting my Uncle and have been to Chinatown twice! Loved it! It has a very friendly atmosphere and the food is lovely! The best Kopi C I've had so far in Singapore! So easy to get to via the MRT. Taking family to visit for a third time on Friday! Would definitely recommend! :)
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,"I have visited a number of Chinatown overseas, this one, in my opinion is fairly big, can spend at least 2 hours roaming around, doing some shopping and eating. Many local fares can be found there. Still quite charming"
,,Wonderful busy area.,5.0,,Great shopping especially if you want to try your bargaining skills. There really is a wonderful selection of things to look at and the shop keepers are very friendly. Whilst in Chinatown you must try some of street food. Great prices and top quality as well as being authentic Chinese food.This is a must do in Singapore. Busy but just go with the flow.
,,Good place for shopping small sourvenirs,4.0,,"I often go to this place to buy some small gifts for friends. You can bargain here so if you are patient and lucky, you can find many items with very good price. The average price here is about S$10 for 3 items. Besides, Chinese food in this place is also good. A disadvantage is this place almost close after 9:30 pm. Besides, some shoppers cannot speak English so you may need a small calculator to bargain."
,,nice place,4.0,,Decent place for bargain shopping and decent food at night .People are friendly and is open till midnight.
,,"Cleanest, Prettiest Chinatown You Will Ever See",4.0,,"Like the rest of Singapore (except Little India, which is authentically gritty), this Chinatown is exceptionally clean. The area is not huge so it is relatively easy to make a good walking tour on foot. The interesting shops in restored old buildings are on the side streets, and each is a photo opportunity. Accessible via the subway system."
,,Lovely to explore!,5.0,,"Unfortunately, I did not have much time, but enjoyed very much the walk around Chinatown streets. Walking away from the main touristic street and wondering around, will take you to China...typical remedy shops, tea vendors, meat vendors...worth trying any food here! It all smells delicious...also, buying tea is so worth it! Specially Jasmine tea that is so expensive anywhere else in the world!"
,,"Fun shops, lots of food choices- what's not to like?",4.0,,"This is a fun area to just stroll around in. All 2 story buildings, nicely maintained and just feels like a whole different country.

Start on Smith St and head towards New Bridge St and just meander around making sure you hit Temple Street. There's a nice covered street food area with seating inside small restaurants as well as outside. There are also loads of small and larger stores just crammed full with all things Asian. If you want to pick up a bunch of really pretty inexpensive fun things to take home- this is the area. I l bought several of the glass chili pepper hanging things- so delicate and pretty.

The Buddah Tooth Relic is just down the st. And so is Sri Mariamman Temple (Singapores oldest Hindu temple)."
,,Visit China town,5.0,,China town has lots of stalls selling all sorts from magnets to clothes . Great of a night it's all lit up with Chinese lanterns good food at little stalls and restaurants cheap to . We loved it here
,,Love the atmosphere,5.0,,"Old houses, wet markets, plenty of food options, my favorite walk in Singapore. Sunday is great for photographers."
,,Must visit,4.0,,"This is Chinatown Singapore, its a must visit place for any tourist to Singapore, you can easily spend several hours to an entire day exploring this vast and wonderful place, from the great temples to museums, hawkers center, and amazing restaurants its not to be missed. You will experience some amazing sights here, such as the Buddha tooth Relic Temple and Museum with 4 floors of relics a tranquil garden and a pure vegetarian restaurant."
,,Cheap shopping,4.0,,"Colourfull streets and a grate place to buy survivors , fashion jewelry. streets are full of 3 for $10 deals and you will not regret the visit. Walk along the food street and enjoy some chinese dishes.."
,,Check out the Monastery,4.0,,The shops in the streets of Chinatown were good. But the main reason I am writing the review and giving it a four star is because of the Monastery present near the Chinatown shopping lane. Its a five-storey monastery which is very beautiful and has complete information on Buddhism and its growth. A must-go to place if you like to discover places on your own.
,,Easy touristic area !,4.0,,"I like Chinatown because you can buy lots of stupid things to bring home: chopstick, bags, magnets and other souvenirs... and for once, shops are not in a mall ! So take you hat if it is a sunny day. I am just a little bit annoyed by the insistence of some shop assistant when they see ""tourists"" - nevertheless it is definitively a place to visit in Singapore !"
,,Chinatown is a must to explore in Singapore,5.0,,"Chinatown is a must to explore to understand the a crucial part of Singapores heritage and culture. Chinatown offers history, culture, cuisine and religion of Singapores Chinese culture. Modern and contempory resturants and clubs intermingle the past with the present. Explore, eat and revisit the riches of this section of Singapore."
,,Great ambience but careful of tourist prices,4.0,,Its as authentic as it can get with an artificial set up. But the original shophouses and religious buildings create a nice ambience to make it worth exploring the area. For sure you'll be able to buy a couple of souvenirs but food in the coffee shops tends to be overpriced so it might be worth making the trip across the road to the Chinatown complexes for more variety too.
,,Glad I Went,4.0,,"Another Chinatown? Since I am not a shopper, I really had no desire to add Singapore to the long list of Chinatowns I have visited on other travels, but when we found ourselves within easy walking distance around lunchtime, we decided to go. I must admit (even though I face teasing by my husband) that he was right in pushing to go see what it is like. The sights, smells and colors were worth the visit. The usual pushiness of vendors was thankfully absent. The local architecture was interesting and the temples worth seeing. It was a lovely way to spend a few hours."
,,we love chinatown,4.0,,"we love walking around chinatown,real chinese food,hm delicious.it is very crowded that we got panic sometimes due to mass of people.we love going to people park.thank god that it is still there.we went to the food court that is not so directly there,where we can sit and enjoy chinatown food.it is on the side road and we did not see tourist sitting there.we got some chinese ointment,they are very good for pains,you will not believe it,it works good.we got some chinese ointment when we are in Sgp."
,,Colorful inexpensive place to shop but crowded streets !,4.0,,"Visiting chinatown on my first visit to Singapore was not so great because the MRT (station) was lot crowded but yeah the moment you enter the streets its definitely too colorful and look lovely ! Everywhere you will find shops selling 3 things (souvenirs) for 10 SGD type though one cannot guarantee the stuff you are buying.
Since now i stay in Singapore so for me its not an attraction anymore but overall i will rate it good to go because there's a lot a scope to the one-time visiting tourists as the place welcomes you with its colorful lanes and temples :)"
,,Bee Line,5.0,,"when my wife and I are lucky enough to be in Singapore we Always make a Bee Line for Chinatown , you can spend hours just walking through its streets and shops , it is vibrant , colourful and interesting , there are tonnes of great places to get food and its great to take photographs."
,,Good shopping,4.0,,"Good shopping in Chinatown. Hubby had his glasses made here, and got it much cheaper - and better - than in Australia. Lots of bargains to be had in the shops. But don't take their word for the best price. Seeing that we had to go back to pick up the glasses, I had time to get better prices in other areas of Singapore!"
,,What a buzzing place,4.0,,"We went too the Chinatown area for a look & see.
Well I was amazed by how busy the place is, it's packed with little stores, Taylor shops competing for your business, trinket shops everywhere.
We loved the atmosphere & the buzz if the area, so much that we stayed all day & had dinner there.
What I liked was you can still haggle on items"
,,Great area to visit,4.0,,This was one of the first places we visited in Singapore and it didn't disappoint as there are so many places to visit the Sri Marimman temple was very good and the area had free WiFi as well.
,,A peek into local Chinese culture in Singapore,5.0,,"Our target destination at Chinatown was the Buddhist Tooth Relic temple but we found ourselves taking in a beer first at Food Street which is sandwiched by that Buddhist temple and an Indian temple. Right beside and around Food Street, there are stall upon stall selling Chinese stuff like charms, fans, clothing, and other touristy souvenirs. This is where we got our merlion statues and keychains to give as gifts for friends at home. You can haggle with sellers here. We peeped at the gates to the Indian temple where music and bells ringing filled the air while someone pranced around . It was the complete opposite of the solemn atmosphere of the Buddhist temple which was grand and ornate."
,,Get Your Gifts Here,4.0,,We enjoyed our visit and got lots of gifts here. Market shopping and a good street of a wide variety of foods. If you're buying clothes you need to be pretty small. In Singapore you can take taxis everywhere because they are really cheap.
,,amazing,5.0,,"we were there 5/6/7 Sept so everything was decorated for the Mid Autumn Festival. Loved all the lanterns/decorations. Lots of bargains/souvenirs at the market. My favourite was seeing the temples, especially as there are Hindu and Mosques all next to each other, amazing and beautiful buildings. My husband loves Mahjong and enjoyed watching the locals playing by the Big Buddha Tooth Relic temple, gave me extra time to walk round the market!"
,,full of heritage and fun,4.0,,"arrived by taxi and strolled around looking at all the food stalls and markets. Smells were amazing. Very colourful. Had yum cha which was excellent. Wandered until we found an upstairs restaurant. Very busy, great food and a lot of fun"
,,a must visit for any traveller,4.0,,"It was one weekend when we visited chinatown. lot of restaurants and eat outs available with sea food and chinese food. Amazingly vegetarian chinese food was also available. And to any travellers advantage, chinatown has some free wi-fi zone too. it would be probably the best place to buy some souvenirs, the cheapest."
,,Save a night for great food & fun markets,4.0,,"Every time we return to Singapore we make sure to visit Chinatown at least once. We usually go around 6pm so we can stroll along Eat street and surrounds to choose a restaurant. Regardless of your tastes and budget you can find great food - and the chance to watch everyone else as they walk by! After dinner do the Temple st night markets. Yes, they are a bit tacky but who can go past a summer top at just $10! Getting here is simple. If travelling on a budget take the MRT to Cinatown and take the Temple Street exit. Otherwise taxis are reasonably priced ( around $12 from Orchard Rd)."
,,Colorful,4.0,,"One of the most tourist centric places I have been to in Singapore. Lots of stalls that sell souvenirs and items, mainly for tourists like myself. Goods are cheap but not sure about the quality. I have enjoyed the Smith Street the most: they have brought a wide selection of local street food to Smith Street. I could enjoy all the nice food in Singapore in one location."
,,A little bit of everything in one place,4.0,,"area is covered with many little heritage rich surprise in every corner. Having the mosque, Indian temple and Buddha tooth relic temple in one area, it brings out the rich history of Singapore as a multi-racial country. As the name chinatown also goes to show, the background of the shops and majority of the chinese ethnic in the area. A lot of restaurants and cafe which serve chinese cuisine from different part of china, the north, south and central parts.

Shopping is also an eye-opening experience as you can bring back souvenirs of various types and pattern. Just remember , not to haggle but negotiate calmly and if it is not successful do not force it. Everybody is just doing their part to work and do their very best to serve the patronisers.

In the evening if you are looking for places to chill and relax, there are some classy pubs and drinking areas such as those at mosque street or club street. Open KTV is also a common hangout joint in this area. Do check out chinatown food street and maxwell when you are here. All within walking distance of 5-10mins."
,,you will never know what lies in those streets,4.0,,"During our visit to Singapore, got to go to chinatown to find some chinese universal oil,- a handy medicine for the home. Of course I'm expecting the same usual chinatown like in other countries, full of chinese medicinal store along the street. As i get inside in one of the store, im glad that the owner was too much accommodating in finding the medicine we needed. After that we decided to roamed around the street, I myself have no plans on buying anything fancy in the street. But as we go along i became thrilled on the items i have been seeing around. And i cant help myself but to rummage on those pretty souvenir things, and in my mind im starting to counting and remembering the names i needed to give souvenirs way back home..Afterwards our stomach started to grumbling, and we decided to go to Maxwell Hawker Center as recommended by my relative. During lunch hour, the place was full and customers needed to fall in line in order to get the food they wanted, but its worth the wait for, because the foods were really delectable and you will savour every bite of it, considering also for its affordable price. You will never know what lies in those street, unless u roamed around and give sometime to appreciate your surroundings. In the end we were satisfied with our visit to Chinatown, Singapore and went home with a big smile and happy tummy..."
,,Proper China Town,5.0,,"A lot of cities claim to have a China Town and it is fair to say that some are better to visit as a tourist than others. Singapore's version is great. Compact and easy to walk around it really is worth a visit. There is some very good shopping and some really good eateries to choose from, Fatty Wheng's being one of the more memorable for the quality of its food."
,,Somewhat commercial - but still a great place to visit,4.0,,"Chinatown at night is especially pretty, with lanterns, street stalls and the famous 'food street' giving off an awesome festive vibe.

Despite its obvious tourism commercial bend, it's still a lively and fun place to visit. I recommend staying away from food street and eating instead at the Maxwell Hawker Centre - or some other little hole in the wall that is feeding the locals rather than tourists.

Definitely a must visit if heading to Singapore - balance your trip with a visit to Little India as well to experience the vast difference in these two cultures and to witness the Asian melting pot that is Singapore."
,,great food and cheap,4.0,,I recently went to Chinatown and had a great lunch in the food street. The food was cheap and delicious... well worth a visit. I also visited some of the shops and bought gifts at the local shops that were reasonably priced.
,,The Best Tour,5.0,,I took the tour of Chinatown during my recent stay in Singapore. This was the best tour of them all. Our tour started with a stop at a store to have our names painted on fans in Chinese. This was followed by a traditional seven course meal at a local restaurant (there are vegetarian and gluten free options). We had time to shop in the local market where everything was extremely cheap. We then embarked on a trishaw ride around Chinatown and down the busy roadways to Clarke Quay and a boat tour around Marina Bay. It was a fabulous evening.
,,Worth to go,4.0,,"You can see lots of things in China Town! Different delicious food nearby the street. You also can buy the tradition Chinese style souvenirs in reasonable price like silk scarf, CD etc. It's worth to visit!"
,,My favourite area in Singapore,5.0,,"I love Chinatown. Every time I visit I enjoy it more because I discover little parts of it that I haven't previously visited.

I always find some colourful piece of clothing to buy or some interesting souvenir. I also find the stall holders to be friendly and approachable.

This last time I ate at the Maxwell Food Court and found it to be great."
,,Singapore Chinatown,3.0,,"I am chinatown lover but this chinatown has something different...
Visisted last month and as all chinatowns it is crowd, you can find a lot a of souvenirs,clothes,food.

this chinatown is quite clean (what is good) is has its own food court and food street (both with delicious things) but there some chinatown feeling missing.

Overlay a great way to spend the afternoon."
,,Everything you need but noisy,3.0,,"I stayed at the Bliss Hotel in Chinatown for three days. Chinatown is very compact so you step out onto the street straight into the markets, restaurants, cafes, traffic and plenty of noise.

Be alert here thought. I tried to buy three items in a 7-Eleven in Chinatown. The total price should have been $5.60 but the shop assistant asked for $52. She became quite aggressive when I asked her to check the price. No apology. Two other sellers demanded the right money when I purchased food items. Would not give change. Another pushed her fingers into my purse telling me to give her a different money note. I was given a $10 note with a small tear in one edge when I purchased a train ticket. Six shops in Chinatown refused to take it as payment for items. Only my hotel would exchange it.

There is a warning on government maps of Singapore to double-check change, don't accept additional charges for using credit cards, and so on. Good advice. You will need it in Chinatown.

If you love bustle, 24/7 noise and bargains at your fingertips, stay in Chinatown."
,,Bustling,4.0,,"Chinatown is so busy and crowded but it's a great place to pick up cheap souvenirs, clothes, toys, perfumes, pretty much anything. Great experience that's very easy to get to. Some temples nearby too."
,,Excellent,3.0,,"Visited this temple about 8 years ago and revisited recently. It has gone into a bit of a decline, but if you haven't seen a temple before, it is good to visit. Chinatown itself, is within walking distance of all major attractions, but there are also tours and hop on, hop off open topped buses that do all the major attractions. When we visited in November 2014 the fare was singapore $18. Good value"
,,Clean China town,4.0,,Lots of places to see and food to eat. Singapore has good food with cheap prices and China town doesn't fail. It is a very clean China town but overall singapore is. You will enjoy the street shopping as well as the regular shopping here
,,Just another Chinatown,3.0,,"This was just another Chinatown. Have you seen it in one city, you have seen this also. However, if you are buying something be sure to check the prices. They fluctuates."
,,Tourist trap but interesting,3.0,,"Thankfully it wasn't as busy as some areas of this soulless city. Where have all the real places gone? This is it now. A reasonable place to buy tacky souvenirs, a fairly decent area to look at the facades of the buildings. Some of it really is rather quaint but I fear the area will diminish over the next few years and become just another concrete and chrome mall. I did feel safe though which is a bonus. And we weren't pestered by anyone. For which we are always grateful."
,,The feel of China,4.0,,"The place is similar to what i have seen in china. shopping, eating, people from various countries experience Chinese cuisine. the best thing is the dinning out along side the streets. The place was full of lights and lots ans lots of eating outlets from restaurants to stalls."
,,a good place to shop for souvenirs,4.0,,"yup... during my 2nd visit to singapore, I stayed in a hotel with my parents near chinatown train station and its near chinatown. its a place in singapore where you can find souvenir items such as ref magnets, keychains, and many more!"
,,Best place for cheap shopping and good chinese food!,4.0,,"Ideally you should start the tour from the Indian temple and then enter the street next to it... keep walking, browsing the various shops and sampling the street food delights... Don't miss the roast duck stall in the street food market!"
,,Fake Chinatown,3.0,,The cleanest chinatown I have ever seen. No fake stuff. Only souvenir and chinese handcrafts. But nice place to visit to take pictures and eat chinese.
,,Shop. Eat. Get a massage & repeat after me! I am free!,5.0,,"One of the most overlooked places to visit from a Tourist perspective. Most of the Indian tourists I know who come to Singapore go & to Mustafa for some odd reason! That's like visiting New York & heading to WalMart first! Chinatown is a treasure chest of odd buys, amazing food & just a quaint back neighbourhood feel with a little bit of good natured commercialism thrown in for good measure. Here is my list of top 10 things to do when in Chinatown & the surrounding areas. (This is what I do at least)

1) Grab a beer near the Pagoda street & temple street junction.
2) Head to Sichuan Village on Mosque Street for some of the Yummiest Chinese food you have ever had in your life! (The Chilli Oil Sprouts fish & Diced Chilli Chicken is a pungent feast)
3) Take the sky walk & cross over to the other side & explore people's park centre.
4) Cross back over to Pagoda street & head over to Temple street for the traditional Chinese desserts at Mei Heong Yuan. Brave the crowds. It'll be worth it. Trust me. After that head to the neighbouring Bath Culture Foot Therapy massage center. It's clean. It's reasonable. It's great if you're tired from all the walking or you wanna kill some time indoors.
5) Walk over to Maxwell food court & have the Popiah & famous Tian Tian Chicken Rice if you've still got place for some food.
6) Walk down club street & Ann Siang Hill side for the more high end dining, continental or drinks experience. This place livens up in the evening & they shut the street off for cars.
7) Walk over on Tanjong Pagar road & check out the various Korean bbq establishments. Head up to Duxton Hill for some of Singapore's most fine dining experiences.
8) There are many bars & gems Duxton side & it's the perfect place to bring your hot date.
9) Cut accross from Telok Ayer by foot & enjoy a 15 minute walk to Boat Quay where you can head out for some more live music & alcohol.
10) End the evening with some thai food or greasy roti prata at Boat Quay."
,,Fabulous must visit area of Singapore,5.0,,For visitors this is a must visit part of Singapore. We lived here for 6 months and had a wonderful time getting to know all the options for food....one of my favourites is the Chinatown Seafood cafe - its the one with the yellow chairs along Pagoda Street as you exit the MRT. Great Black Pepper Crab (ask for a 20% discount which we used to get as regulars) Walk around food street eating snacks and the market area for souveniers
,,Best for shopping for tourists,4.0,,"This is the best place for tourists to shop. The chinatown market starts through one of the exit of chinatown MRT, which has a wide variety of souvenirs, gift items, clothing, chocolates, jewellery for ladies and lots more in a quite good rate. Almost all shops have deals like 3 for $10 OR 4 for $10 OR 5 for $10 depending on the product. There are restaurants also in which you can have local food."
,,Good place for stay in Singapore !,4.0,,"It's located in central of city so get easy to go everywhere by Mrt or bus. There are many food courts, markets, shopping mall and attractions. The food is cheap, everything is ok. U can walk to Clark Quay and Boat Quay, no need take a bus or Mrt , it's close and very convenient. U should to stay there!"
,,Good for relatively low cost shopping,3.0,,"Plenty of smaller shops scattered around Chinatown with an array of cheaper goods for purchase. Also a selection of cheaper places to eat. During CNY this place can be ridiculously crowded, but also quite fascinating to observe the street markets etc."
,,Nice spot middle of SGP,4.0,,Chinatown is really nice place to see little shops and eat cheap and good food middle of the street. Easy to get by bus or by metro.
,,Fantastic sight,5.0,,China town was a great place to visit especially just before chritmas . The decorations were fantastic. Shops sold lots of cheap crap but I was there for the sight not the shopping.
,,worth the visit,5.0,,"we recently visited chinatown in singapore. a great place to wander the laneways and pick up a few bargains. then the skies opened and the deluge was quite impressive! so we headed off to the lane way where all the restaurants were and waited it out while drinking and dining. this area has a huge glass ceiling erected over it, so you are safe and dry beneath, yet still outside, dining alfresco.
too much food to choose from, but i would recommend the vendor at the very end who sells satay. the satay here is head and shoulders above what is found at satay by the bay, which is saying a LOT. that satay booth is attached to an indian food stall where we ordered some prata to accompany the lamb sticks, and then from the adjacent chinese restaurant, the ginger long beans were the perfect accompaniment.
i have made my mouth water writing this review."
,,A 'must' for visitors!,4.0,,"Chinatown of Singapore is a vibrant place,full of affordable souvenoirs and local food.It is easily reached by bus or MRT.Better to eat where locals do(in the 2nd level of Chinatown Complex)than the covered Food St. meant for tourists(expensive and not very authentic). In the basement of the same building is a wet market where locals do their marketing.The vendors sell fresh seafood and vegetables.On the 1st floor cne can buy ethnic Chinese garments for adults and children.Everything is so colorful and vibrant here, and part of the excitement is in haggling over prices!"
,,Chinatown is a Key Part of Singapore's History,5.0,,"When you are in Singapore, leave the big shopping districts behind and take a walk in Chinatown. The Chinese played a major role in Singapore's creation, and Chinese descendents are a large part of the citizen population here. You can experience the history and the dining in Chinatown, while shopping in a variety of settings.
There is an area with covered shopping stalls near the Buddha Tooth Relic temple, so wander over there to shop after you visit the temple. I bought a terrific pair of sandals there for a good price that have seen daily and extensive use for over three months. You will find other items of clothing as well as souvenirs, at better prices, and often more authentic, than you will in the more expensive districts.
Go in the evening and find a little place to eat to enjoy Singapore as the night lights up and the air cools off."
,,"Great fun to walk through, browse the knickknack stalls and eat street food",4.0,,"And have your camera ready because you'll be clicking away. Most things on sale were not particularly cheap. I priced some bespoke trousers at one of the tailors and didn't think it was a bargain. I did buy some flip-flop sandals in the indoor bazaar building which were a lot cheaper than on Orchard Road, but that still didn't make them a bargain, just affordable. Street food on Smith Street was good and good fun. We tried food at a couple of the stalls. It was all tempting. And then out of nowhere we came upon a very picturesque Hindu temple and a green colored Mosque which was quite modest in comparison.

It's very easy to get to this area by train. It's definitely a place to plan on walking around because it's all pedestrian streets."
,,"Perfect Place for Shopping, Dining, and SightSeeing",4.0,,"If you want to stay in a location close to the shops and restaurants Chinatown is the perfect choice. Scores of accommodation options that suit any budget can be found in this area. I never had the chance to visit Chinatown during my earlier trips (1980s) so I did all my shopping at Lucky Plaza and other malls in Orchard Road and spent a fortune for small souvenir items. It was only in 2007 when I decided to visit Chinatown and was surprised to see how cheap the items are compared to the prices I paid elsewhere. Since then, Chinatown became my favorite shopping destination everytime I visit Singapore. There are popular tourist attractions and interesting places within the area like the Sri Mariamman Temple at the end of Pagoda Street, the Chinatown Heritage Center which is just a short walk from the MRT station, the Maxwell Hawker Center and the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum just to name a few."
,,Cheap Souvenirs,3.0,,"I must say that I was disappointed in the goods I saw in Singapore's Chinatown -- alley after alley, stall after stall of very cheaply made souvenirs with very little originality or difference between them. I have to say, though, that I stuck to the street level stores. One of the reviewers mentioned that there were better quality stores on the higher levels, which may be true.

We had just come from Hong Kong, where the outdoor Chinatown markets were amazying -- with a higher quality and variety of merchandise, so I couldn't help but do a comparison."
,,Old-Styled Food Centre,4.0,,"For a authentic taste of good old local hawker food, go to the People's Park cooked food centre. Join the queue and savour the famous traditional Yong Xiang Xing Yong Tau Foo and other local fare. Take a walk up to the shops on the levels directly above the food centre for great deals on clothes, shoes, cosmetics etc. This is old style shopping for the locals at it best ... and at fantastic savings. A must for a less touristy China Town experience."
,,Do Not Miss,5.0,,"Something for everyone, wear sensible shoes, you will need them! Numerous shopping malls, start at the top floor for designer items and work down floors and price. Cheapest usually at the bottom. Turning to the food - you will eat some of the best food ever here. From top class restaurants to fabulous food courts which are not expensive, you are in for a treat. Lots of great places for a massage and good prices too. Very easy to get around and cabs are relatively cheap. If there are more than 2 in your group its cheaper use a taxi than the trains. Some traditional china town decorated streets with market stalls, a bit of everything really. We spent 3 days exploring here and could have done more. Loved it!"
,,Great street food,5.0,,"Had dinner here on two nights of our Singapore stay. Had the best satay sticks and a wonderful duck dish with sautéed greens in oyster sauce. You order individually at each hawker van than wets your taste buds. Ladies wander around and take your drink orders and your dirty dishes are taken away for you. Lots of comfortable, clean seating all under cover amidst amazing old buildings full of history and colour. Food is cheap and plentiful. Lots of bargains to be had for souvenirs in all the lane ways running off several streets all easily accessed by MRT. A great way to spend an evening or two."
,,Cheap souvenirs and a great way to kill some time,4.0,,"I needed to kill sometime and this was a great way to do it, I spent quite some time strolling the streets looking at junk to buy as souvenirs. I preferred this area better than Little India."
,,We shopped!,5.0,,"We went to Chinatown 2 years ago when we were in Singapore and it was a number 1 thing to do. When we were there again in late October 2014 that was our first stop. We like the bargaining aspect of the place and the variety that it has to offer. We had my grand daughters name done by a person that makes each letter of a name out of a drawing of bamboo, a panda, a tiger, etc.
Each letter is different and each name is very unique.
You can buy beer here cheaper than most places in Singapore.
It was not too far from our hotel so the walk was not an issue."
,,Just like China,4.0,,"The place has plenty of small shops around , and even the price of everything is not so expensive. Good place to go around and shop."
,,Lots to see and do,4.0,,You could get lost in Chinatown for a whole day. From People's Park to Chinatown Point (Daiso!!) over to South Bridge Road for foodie heaven aka Maxwell Road Food Centre and LeeTongKee. There's a Buddhist temple across the street from the Food Centre and the main Hindu Temple in Singapore just a stones throw down the street.
,,China Town visit,5.0,,"China Town: Easy to reach by fantastic Singapore Subway called MRT, by North-East Line NE4 (Violet Line) or Downtown Line DT19 (Blue Line) Lot of shopping and many nice outside restaurants, specially evenings........"
,,A thoroughly enjoyable visit,4.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Chinatown. When leaving the MRT and entering Chinatown for the first time it really had (for me) the wow factor. There are so many shops and stalls selling silks, wooden items, jewellry, and tailors offering a made to measure service for suits'. There are plenty of places to eat and there are also a couple of Temples to visit a long the way - something for everyone!"
,,Best place for souvenirs,3.0,,"You can buy lot of Chinese souvenirs for few dollars here.
Folding fans, dolls, chop sticks and anything you want to take home as a memento.But for other stuff better to go to places like Mustafa Centre.
There is a food street which mostly serves Chinese food for a cheap prize.Even if you didn’t by anything you’ll enjoy strolling down the streets with lanterns hanging and lot of old buildings selling Chinese herbs by the side. Best to go at night like any other Chinatown."
,,Everything you're looking for!,4.0,,"We loved Chinatown in Singapore. We felt like it was very authentic and purchased several items, most loved was the tea. If you're looking for souvenirs, tea, silk, household products, or grocery ""market"" items, then this is definitely the place. Loved the temples and the people. Hope to return some day."
,,Our Chinatown (Rating: 3.5),3.0,,"For foreigners , the best time to visit here would be around the eve of Chinese New Year as you could really feel the festive spirit . But it's also not a very good time to visit as many shops would be closed during the first 2 days of CNY. There's lantern light-up during Mid-autumn Festival too.

While I do agree that our Chinatown is not the Best Chinatown in the world but it has its own beauty. There are many stories behind the street names and the most unique thing would be having 3 different religious temples along the same street!"
,,easy to find Singapore Chinatown,4.0,,"If you visit singapore for the first time, finding this tourist attraction does not need detailed study its whereabout and getting there. It is very easy to take MRT to chinatown from your hotels and it is a cheap mode of transportation. You will never get lost, just take the MRT anywhere in Singapore and look for the CHINATOWN MRT STATION. Upon arrival, its main entrance leads you directly to this attraction. Take your time touring, as there are 3 very popular tourist- attractions within the Chinatown area, namely a beautiful INDIAN's temple and if you come at a right time you can see a fire walking rite, next comes a Chinese temple where you can learn about buddhism and finally, visit Chinatown heritage centre ( a small fee is charge for entry) to give you a understanding of its rich history.
Chinatown tour take about 2 to 3 hours and wear light clothings for the walking experience."
,,china in singapore,4.0,,"Singapore Chinatown puts many other Chinatowns to shame. This one is the real deal, where you can find authentic Chinese attire like silk shirts and ties .
Singapore is probably the closest thing you can get outside of China and HK. Every night is night market here; the surprise is that the oldest Hindu Temple, ""Sri Mariamman Temple,"" is located in Chinatown.
This is definitely a place to visit when you're in Singapore. There's also a train stop here as well. This is probably the safest and cleanest Chinatown.
pretty much half covered in tents so still shoppable during their rain storms.
Singapore Chinatown in the district of Outram, where finally the streets are clean and so many moderately priced food options and Chinese souvenirs yet with an ethnic Singaporean Chinese flair as Curry Powder, red bean paste buns, Soya Bubble Tea, and slice beef jerky. It fends a Southeast Asian immersion to the historic parts of Singapore with a longstanding cultural presence. There are many ethnic Singaporean Chinese Buddhist temples. Gifts of Feng Shui and colorful chopsticks of Chinese cultural elements are readily available. A Night Market contains many moderately priced peddlers where visitors can bargain until comprised,
For visitors who are not afraid to be immersed in Asian culture, with an open mind, Singapore Chinatown is surely a worthwhile visit."
,,Very nice to be on Chinese street food!,5.0,,I love the area as it very easy to find exotic food and the feeling of being there is like you are really in China. There are lots of souvenirs with reasonable price for everyone.
,,The old has been maintained and restored,5.0,,"It was a great relief to see that the Chinatown night market (and in fact daytime too) still exists. The Govt have set aside areas that have been kept from developers. The old blends well with the old. It is fascinating walking around Chinatown looking at the old shop houses, eating a Chicken Rice or viewing the temples and mosques."
,,Not Great,3.0,,"We used the hop on and hop off bus , which was great fun, but to be honest once you been to Chinatown in Hong Kong this was a little bit of a disappointment, the only reason we went was to go to one of the temples and I think we stayed for about 1 hour.

To be honest Singapore is so beautiful and clean, this was a real let down."
,,Shopping spree,5.0,,If you are into great buys with cheap cost then this is the place that u must not miss to visit if u are a tourist in.Singapore.
,,I love to buy vases there - cloissone vases on the Temple street,4.0,,"Big China Town with many small shops at interest - and small restaurants, Must see in Singapore to undestand the culture and flavour of the city. This time I bought the vases and a horse statue."
,,"Average place, good for souvenir shopping",3.0,,"Quite accessible, the market opens right from MRT entrance. Free WIFI area and great for cheap shopping items. expecially souvenir etc. We found an orginal tintin store in the market which was great but expensive as expected. Overall a good place. Visit in your last leg.. 1-2 hr approx."
,,Great way to spend a day,5.0,,"Luckily our hotel was in Chinatown so exploring the area is very easy. There are plenty of places to get some wonderful food, and to see some of the old Chinese buildings. The MRT station is right in the middle of Chinatown and makes visiting very simple."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,Used the hop on hop off bus to get around and had lots of fun even though the same things are on offer all over the markets. Naturally very hot.
,,Great fun,5.0,,"We actually stayed in Chinatown this time so spent a fair bit of time there each evening. The markets are really fun have been to a number of chinatowns around the world and these are comparible, lots of 3 for $10 shops for souveniers, plenty of cheap clothes, and trinkets. The Smith street food street we ate only once opting to go to Mawells Hawker Food Centre a couple of nights great cheap food and bakery."
,,Fun,4.0,,"Hot, but Fun. It's an open air market. You can find any kind of street snack and drinks in here, also the famous Lim Chee Guan traditional Bak Kwa. Go a bit deeper, and you can find chinese groceries, medicine, various tea leaf and flowers, and fashion market."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"Well worth a visit, some fantastic unusual gifts to take home at affordable prices ! loved the hassle and bustle feel of the place ...lots going on !"
,,Good food & shops,4.0,,"Geared for the tourist trade, the Chinatown in Singapore nonetheless is a good place to spend an hour or two. Peruse the many shops selling a variety of clothes, trinkets, little cats with hands and many different types of luggage tags of all things, then take a seat in the street food market for some lunch or dinner. And a beer. Try the frog porridge or pork liver stir fry if you really want!"
,,Delightful,4.0,,Very interesting and easily reached by subway. Chinatown is another Singapore shopping mecca with countless shops basically selling the same items and plenty of merchants ready to make a deal. Don't suggest you visit during the middle of the day as the heat and humidity tend to drain one's energy. The Food Street is interesting with an abundant selection of food stalls and side restaurants serving a wide variety of Asian cuisine.
,,Well worth an evening,5.0,,You can accomplish all your souvenir shopping in a few minutes and then have a super cheap dinner after. Enjoy frog porridge for S$8 !!
,,China Town,4.0,,"We had a good night out in China Town, lots to see and do and some interesting food choices, check out our little video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXUxzHj4vCw"
,,Myer's Jewellary Singapore - a rort for tourists,1.0,,"Recently when visting Singapore I was taken there by a taxi driver (the blue Singapore cabs) to this shop. That should have been warning enough but I am obviously niaeve! Found a apecific pair of earings I wanted but knowing the prices in , they were overpriced. Finally negotiated a price which was about what I would be happy to pay in Australia, of $150 Australian, down from $250 Singapore. They persueded mw to do by credit card as they said the goods would be insured if they were lost. The docket the got me to sign was for $250 Singapore which they said was $150 Australian. A total lie as I found out when I got my credit card statement.
My advise would be that if you were foolish and gulliable enough to buy there, (as I was!) do it in Singapore cash money.
Also they don't give proper invoices and are not recognised for GST refund when you leave the country, as was explained to me by the Singapore officials who said you must buy from legitimate stores to get the GST refund. Now a wiser shopper!"
,,"Must visit while in Singapore for bargain shopping, gifts and food",4.0,,"We spent 2 afternoons wandering the streets of Chinatown, doing some cheap shopping and good for souvenirs plus a street with cheap hawker food stalls running down the middle of it. Great noodles, rice and satay cooked over the coals all in very clean environments"
,,Chinatown,3.0,,"Loads of market stalls... Clothes, clothes n more clothes and usual collection of budget items...the hawker food stalls upstairs....great variety to choose from. "" go where the locals go"" if a long line of locals, is good. Prices are great... Dinner or lunch for $8.00sng for two."
,,Worth seeing but watch out for scammers.,4.0,,"The markets and district are fun, picked up some great bargains, there are a number of other attractions in the area and the Maxwell Street Hawker Centre are all in an easy walking distance. But be careful of scammers, the extremely helpful taxi driver who stopped and offered me $2.00 fare to go to the markets, also very helpfully took me to a discount jewellery place, where the owner attempted to selling anything and very heavy handed. Do not buy any 'discounted' jewellery. If you travelled Thailand, you know the scam."
,,Good souvenirs and food,5.0,,Our hotel was just up the road from Chinatown so we went there a few times for meals. Good food and souvenirs. We did a night tour as well which included had a trishaw ride that was fun.
,,Loved it:),4.0,,"Love the atmosphere of China town in Singapore. A great place to pick up some souvenirs and grab a bite to eat. You get hassled a lot less than other Chinatown markets such as KL which is nice and you get the chance to browse in peace. It's right near a MRT as well so easy to get to. Also if you are a Tintin fan there is a dedicated shop, a bit pricey but I love Tintin so didn't mind."
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,"Great market,good atmosphere full of bargains to buy,great for souvenirs and ethnic clothes.There are cheap places to eat around here and you can spend afew hours browsing around."
,,Great lively vibe,5.0,,"Loved it here,I loved the lively vibe of the place and so many cheap places to eat yummy food.Great markets to stroll around and pick up some great bargains.We first went there during the day then went back the next evening,it was very lively and everything seemed bright and lit up.Highly recommend a visit."
,,Alleviate - reflexology foot massage in China town....Worst ever!,1.0,,"My husband and I both had reflexology at Alleviate in Chinatown Singapore.... It was the WORST waste of of an hour ever..the massage ladies had no idea what they were doing and had absolutely NO pressure. We have reflexology often and sadly it was a waste of time!
The foot massage place on pahang st in the arab quarter is the best place for reflexology. They had excellent pressure, rythm and knew where the pressure points where..... Highly recommend them."
,,"Partly for tourists, but mainly for people",4.0,,"A real China town, not comparable to e.g. London. Go beyond the tourist façade and see all the small shops and food places, the very cheap food malls with >90% Chinese people sitting there. This is the everyday life for a lot of people, quite different from my life. Very close to the Bayfront area with all it's modern buildings but so different in style."
,,Felt very comfortable here,4.0,,"As a solo female traveler I felt instantly comfortable here in Chinatown, Singapore. There was loads of different foods and shops to explore. The real highlight for me was the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple at the forefront. This building is so beautifully crafted and loads of opportunities for happy snaps. I've been to a few Chinatown's around the world - this one made me feel at home, regardless of my heritage/nationality."
,,Lots of Atmosphere and tasty treats,3.0,,"On the route of the Hop on bus so easily reached. Lots of atmosphere and smells drifting in the air.
It does look quite modern with its coloured facades. Lots of food stalls selling food. To be fair we were not impressed with the quality or quantity of the food we bought. I have better else where. It just appears to be quite a fake area and I'm sure there are more authentic places to eat.
But non the less it was lovely to walk down and then peruse the Chinatown street market and beyond.
I thought it was going to bigger than what it is but gives easy access to the temples."
,,"Quite a big area with plenty to taste, see and explore... Fantastic.",5.0,,"I have travelled in Taiwan and Beijing and lived for 18 months in Hong Kong and think that the Chinatown area of Singapore is pretty authentic and a vibrant place to visit to stimulate all your senses. I stayed at the 'Bliss Hotel' for 3 days which was great for exploring the Chinatown area.

Chinatown is a very culture rich district with some great places to visit such as the 'Thian Hock Keng Temple', the 'Sri Mariamman Temple', the 'Jamae Mosque', the 'Buddha Tooth Relic Temple', the street markets, food vendors and one of my favourite Chinatown 'experiences' would be the Chinatown Complex in Smith Street... This is a multi-level trading centre with a atmospheric 'wet market' in the basement and then other shops and traders on the 1st Level and Food Stores on the 2nd Level. Do go here early and do go to the wet market where you can see fresh fish being prepared, live frogs in cages for sale and exotic fruit and veg stalls. Not for those with a weak stomach though!!

Chinatown is buzzing by day or night with so many interesting things to take-in and so many places to sample fantastic Chinese food and drink... Spend a good day if not longer exploring this fabulous old district of Singapore. Also go by day and night as it's fabulous in different ways at these different times."
,,Food Heaven,5.0,,"I cant recommend this area highly enough.
If you want to eat like the locals you must visit here.
This is the opportunity to sample lots of delicacies.
The food courts are an inexpensive way to eat.
Dishes are usually $5.
The only issue you will encounter is deciding what you will eat 1st.
All of the food stands have pictures showing each dish.
All of the vendors are helpful, they want to assist you in purchasing their dishes.
Extremely happy memories. I promise that Chinese food in the UK doesn't come close to these delights.
A personal favourite in this area of the world is Satay skewers. 10 for $7. Out of this world.
Bring some back for me!"
,,Very Convenient,4.0,,"I stayed at a hostel here with my friends. It's very convenient, close to the train station and also bus stops. Public transport is very efficient here, as long as you know your stop, it would be a breeze. Chinatown has one of the cheapest souvenir items in Singapore. I bought keychains and stuffed merlion toys here for like SGD10 for 3 pieces (I actually thought I heard the lady wrong so I had to ask again). It's also quite safe, I watched a concert alone and had to walk the street late into the evening and I didn't feel threatened whatsoever. The streets are well-lit and no drunk people loitering. The hawker food stalls are inexpensive yet tasty. There are plenty of options for everything here."
,,It's all here,5.0,,"This is absolutely a happening area in Singapore. All kinds of shopping, great food and drink, Tailor shops, and major religious shrines. Just across the way is one of Singapore's best hawker centers, where you can get that all important chicken and rice. The vibe here is great, and it should be noted that the atmosphere changes entirely after dark. So, it's worth more than one visit."
,,Pleasant shopping,5.0,,"Visited Chinatown last week. It is one of the nicer China Towns with all the usual trinkets and souvenirs and knick knacks. Felt totally safe and the shop staff were not too pushy. Picked up some clothing, perfume and souvenirs at reasonable prices. Very easy to get to on the MRT, as you walk straight into Pagoda Street. Would recommend you have a look."
,,A must-see in Singapore,5.0,,"Go visit this now, because it may be vastly changed in another 20 years or less.

There's still a lot of commerce here, cheap knick-knacks and t-shirts for sale, weird but wholesome foods, temples and incense, hawkers and hucksters. Of course the more expensive furniture and antique places are beginning to muscle in, and soon it will become all expensive boutiques.

Just get there and enjoy a little haggling and cheap but delicious food, before it all disappears into high end commerce.

Oh, and visit as many of the temples as you can - Buddhist, Hindu, Moslem, they're all there."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Amazing experience with lovely foodcourts and shopping. Busy, noisy, colourful, smelly - all good :-) WOW - love it !! Totally different than things you'll be used to. Try it, enjoy it, you won't regret it !!!"
,,Loved it!!,4.0,,"Great place to visit! Food is amazing and great variety for shopping. The chestnuts roasted in coffee beans were so good! Make sure to eat at one of many hawker stalls or foodcourts, the food is amazing! The great thing about these food centres in Chinatown in Singapore is that every stall has a certificate displayed for cleanliness and hygiene, most stalls rated B with some having an A rating."
,,"Must visit for sure, but keep it short",3.0,,"I think one can just walk around for half an hour to get a feel of the place and then have something to eat from the Chinatown Food Street which has plenty of options.
Unfortunately the Chinatown Heritage Centre was closed for renovations so not much to do here if you are not interested in shopping for souvenirs."
,,Shopping shopping,5.0,,If you want to have the great finds and sales then see this place and get what you want. Recommended to those who doesn't care much about brands.
,,Resized rings,5.0,,"I read the previous traveller's review and went to Singapore with 5 pieces of jewellery. I had quotes given at home before I left. Mike and Florence genuinely looked after me. They repaired a broken 5 stone garnet ring as well as replacing one stone, for less than a third of a quoted price. I had 4 other rings resized for about half the cost. Yes they did their best to sell me another ring as they are in the business. I declined and told them next time. It is in their best interest to please their customers, as we all know, the internet has become a very valuable tool for serious business people."
,,Old in the trendy city,5.0,,"Place bustling with activity, especially near the Chinese new year period. There are many shops there, and this is definitely worth a visit, if you want to experience something different in modern Singapore"
,,Lots of shops - cheap souvenirs,3.0,,"Lots of shops with cheap souvenirs. easy to find gifts to bring home - but that's about the extend of what is there. 30-45 minutes is enough to spend there, in my opinion."
,,Great night,5.0,,"Awesome shopping one of the best and busiest night markets we've been to. The food was good ,the people were friendly . We had a number of nights there and all we tops."
,,Smells & Taste of China,4.0,,To visit and get the smells and taste of china. lot of shopping malls and at very good price. bargain for good deals. Nearest MRT - Chinatown
,,loved it,4.0,,"Chintown is a happening place,it has mordern buildings as well as traditional shops a shoppers paradise , a beautiful buddhist temple .Two times a year one on Chinese new year in Febuary and other in Sept when they have on a full moon night lamp festival China town isbbeautifully decorated . I was fourtunate that I visited in September when the lamp festival was on. sharing few pictures."
,,Awesome for sale hunters,5.0,,This place is a haven for all of those looking for great finds. If you are tourist in Singapore visit this place for some souvenirs. There are lots of food stalls around too where you can enjoy authentic Singapore food
,,"Great place to walk, shopping a bit overwhelming",4.0,,"This is a must see in Singapore and I was only there a couple of hours so maybe didn't do the place justice. It reminded me very much of Khaosan Road in Bangkok but cleaner and minus the pad thai and spring roll vendors. There are shops after shops selling pretty much identical souvenirs and trinkets, so this is a great place to buy gifts for the folks back home. There are several houses of worship such as a mosque and a South Indian Hindu temple. It is very conveniently located on the metro line. I would like to go here earlier in the day and spend more time, when I went it was late and I was tired."
,,Nice stroll,4.0,,"Nice stroll among the antiquities, merchants and souvenir shops. Check prices in multiple places before you buy, it can vary widely."
,,Shopping place,4.0,,"Lots of food around the street, looks yummy, durian ice-cream save my life me under the hot weather. A tempo near around as well."
,,It's a happening place,4.0,,"Chinatown is easy to reach by the MRT and is the vibrant heart for Singapore. Great markets for clothing, jewellery and souvenirs. Lots of good places to eat and drink and the prices are a lot cheaper than other parts of Singapore. Definitely worth spending an evening."
,,What you'd expect but lots of fun,4.0,,"We've all seen Chinatowns in various cities and Singapore's version is pretty typical, but it's an enjoyable place to visit and you can shop there for everything from trinkets to jewellery. After the somewhat twee environment of Orchard Road this was more like the Asian retail environment I'd hoped to see - chaotic, varied, and everything's negotiable. Lots of cheap junk too, of course, but when you've got grandchildren it's a way to stock up on presents without spending a fortune. There's a wide range of fashion, mostly the inexpensive variety, and things like cameras and phone accessories to name just a couple of the categories on offer. Plenty of food available there and the lunch we had was just as good as any Singapore restaurant could provide. The free wi-fi throughout Chinatown was a pleasant surprise and it worked!"
,,china town shopping,4.0,,"I love china town....especially peoples park shopping Centre, great food and juices, so many jewellery shops, I had a massage and fish eating my feet in fish spa for only $30 , their is many many beauty treamant place in the peoples park centre, where I had treatment done that would cost thousands here, only $300 their and service and treatment is superb!!!"
,,love chinatown in singapore,5.0,,"a must see in singapore.
theres two temples and the food is delicious anywhere you go here. I love yum cha, the dim sum is traditional and also unique. the shopping is endless. love the culture and the history here. easy to get around in this area. a lovely walking tour."
,,Chinatown in Singapore,4.0,,A typical Chinatown environment. The shopping and restaurants average. Expected a larger area for a city the size of Singapore. Enjoyed our meal. Even Chinese restaurants are expensive in Singapore.
,,Seen better,2.0,,"If your short on time Don't Bother with China Town, it's quite expensive, half of it was closed and it was junky, have seen way better china towns than the one in Singapore"
,,Another lovely Chinatown,5.0,,Almost all countries I've been too have their own Chinatown and this is one of those lovely spots where you can buy cheap buys but are definitely good and nice.
,,Something for everyone,4.0,,"There are several aspects to chinatown depending on what takes your fancy (some or all)

1) shopping
2) food
3) culture

The busy markets and souvenir stalls/shops are amongst the cheapest for those small gifts to take home. Take your time and find the best bargains although most are similar. Not sure on the cheap suit offers though.

Food options are little restaurants or the Maxwell food centre

Culture is mixed around all this with some great temples and culture."
,,Just another Chinatown,3.0,,"I've never particularly enjoyed any Chinatown that I have visited. It all feels contrived. This one was no different, but I did prefer it to the Chinatown in London and Bangkok. It did feel a little (but only a little) more authentic.

There is a good road for picking up rather tacky (and a few not too tacky) souvenirs if you need them.

Make sure to check out the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple."
,,Nice for an evening walk and dinner,5.0,,"Chinatown is a nice place for a spot of street food and a walk about. There are lots of market stalls selling tourist souvenirs at very low cost, some tacky, some not so! The street food is worth a visit alone and not expensive."
,,Love the area,5.0,,"Don't stop to the busiest streets wuth useless souvenir...walk around and discover how fascinating and historical is this part of Sg. It is usually very crouded, so its better to visit on weekdays"
,,Great atmosphere and shopping,5.0,,"I took my family here to experience more of Singapore, its culture and what it has to offer; and it did not disappoint. We spent hours of shopping (little too long IMHO) as there was plenty in the markets (Chinatown Complex) and along/within the streets. We had lunch at this great place along New Bridge Street (Oriental Chinese Restaurant), rather than the tourist precinct as it looked like a favorite for the locals; see my next review. It is easy access via the MRT which has an opening in the middle of Chinatown. We also visited a few temples along the way for the kids to see and experience other religions and cultural beliefs."
,,Murals and Street art in Chinatown!,5.0,,Starting at The People's Theatre at the Kreta Ayer Community Centre you will be able to see an artwork that was left half finished and I understand from the people around that work will be continued from mid October till April next year 2015! The theme will be mainly heritage and it would be very interesting to see how it will all turned out once they are completed! many more empty walls will be painted so look out for artwork around this area The CC is behind the Visitors centre at Sago Lane
,,China town with a Capital C!,3.0,,"Place to get what ever you can imagine for some few dollars!! Bling bling, mobile accessories, dolls, scarfs - yeah you name it! Also a lot of cheap places to get good Chinese food - overall a worth the visit, with the lights, people and over crowded streets!"
,,hidden gems,4.0,,"This review is for a morning walk cum breakfast. ( 8.30 or 9am onwards is ideal) Chinatown Complex at Smith Street is one of my favourite haunts for marketing and breakfast, You will find the basement has a wet market, the first floor has many shops selling souvenirs and clothes and the second level has a food centre.
So many times I see many foreign visitors at the wet market with their guides at the wet market. That is all. A pity they don't venture beyond the wet market. Let me give our foreign friends some tips from my perspective to make it more personal and special :

Tip 1. Discover the wet market's nooks yourself (basement level). I mean, why pay $70-100 per person with a guide when u can walk around on your own ? Afraid of getting lost here ? Isn't it more fun to discover than see it only from a travel guide's perspective ?
Time spent : about 30 mins. Seriously u don't need to pay a guide to come here. The hawkers here r understanding n r used to tourists. walk around. Look for stalls that sell frogs n eels. One or 2 still sell turtles. Look for the herb stalls. Take photos quickly. Don't block people walking around. If u like, ask the stallholders some questions like ""How do you eat this?"" V interesting. This wet market has many excellent fruit stalls (more than 10 stalls here). If u want to buy some fruit , remember you only buy at the crowded stalls. Say ""Hello, I want this"" n point. Use simple English.The floor is a little wet so wear sneakers or old shoes. Only a word of caution : honestly safety is usually not an issue here but to b careful, just bring about 20-30 dollars here in your pocket. Don't flash your money.

Tip 2. Go to the Food market at the send level for breakfast or lunch. Take stairs or lift. The food stalls r spread out. Be patient. You can find nice vegetarian food, excellent yong tau fu (bean curd stuffed with fish paste) behind the big prayer altar which is v close to the escalator. Take the long queue - if there r 10 people, the queue is about 30 mins. If u aren't sure, just ask the locals ""Is this the best yong tau fu?"" , closely, the peanut pancake (there is a gd one- if u can't find it, ask around) n if u r there before 9,30am , look for Xiang Xiang Cooked Food (opens at 6.30am it sells ondeh ondeh- traditional sweet potato balls filled with coconut sweet in the centre -3 for $1) n try fried potato balls n tapioca cake. Or try bean curd milk or any food u fancy. Go for crowded stalls. They r crowded for a gd reason. u will b rewarded if u can find these hidden gems.

Tip 3 : head to the surrounding streets to buy souvenirs. Big variety. I don't know about u. For me, I usually refuse souvenirs that r not manufactured in the country. For ex : why buy made-in-China chopsticks in Singapore as souvenirs unless they r irresistible ?

Tip 4 : Some people visit the big Buddha temple next to it .For me I won't bother coz it is fairly new, has only been there for about 10 years. Want to see a really old temple in Singapore ? Head to Telok Ayer's Thian Hock Keng Temple ( can go there after your breakfast - walking time bat 20 mins. Or catch a cab). It is the oldest temple in Singapore. By the way Telok Ayer is a v nice area to explore.

Tip 4 From Chinatown Complex, find South Bridge Road n walk over in 5-8 mins to look for Tong Heng which sells egg tarts. These r v nice, better than those egg tarts in Macao !

Tip 5 Walk 2 mins from Tong Heng to another iconic food market in Singapore _ Maxwell Road Market and look for Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken -C'mon u haven't been to Singapore if u leave without eating Hainanese Chicken Rice. This one is gd.

Hope this review helps a little to start you discovering the colour and flavour of Chinatown !"
,,A must do visit to Singapore,4.0,,A very cheap but excellent culinary treat. Great food in modest surroundings but an excellent experience. Cost in sharp contrast to Singapore's more trendy destinations. Great to catch some cheap food and drink with an opportunity for souvenir shopping!

,,"Great food, shopping and atmosphere",5.0,,"An area best explored on foot, wander around the markets and find a hidden gem for lunch or dinner. Easy to reach on the MRT"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Worth a visit but try to avoid the tat which can be overpriced. Check out the chop sticks shop and the lady doing the chinese names which as both excellent value for money.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Spent about half a day exploring, could have spent a full day but dividing our day between relaxing at our hotel and adventuring before f1 races began in evenings.

The markets are good for souvenirs, picked up a few things here. There are a lot of places to eat and get takeaway.

Great spot to check our for sure.
MRT will take you right here."
,,Awesome food,5.0,,"We caught the mrt line which takes you straight to Chinatown. Awesome array of food, so cheap and so delicious. The street decorations were beautiful. Don't miss it."
,,Loved it,5.0,,"Beware its noisy, it can be smelly and its mostely shopstands.

Im not much of a shopper but the ambiance is just great. You dont have to buy but just walk past the many stands, sit and eat, try the local food its fantastic.
Just observing the people is a great thing.

There are temples nearby you can visit and the metro is next to chinatown. Easy to travel easy to go if you dont like it."
,,Worth staying there,4.0,,Chinatown is in a class of it's own. It is busy and full of interest. There is a great interesting heritage museum. Eating the local dishes with the locals is a must. Shopping can be cheaper than elsewhere.
,,Great to Eat,4.0,,Went to china town for a browse..this must be the cleanest chinatown i have ever been to. Great choice of cheap nice food to eat. Good place to pick up cheap presents.
,,Singapore Chinatown,3.0,,"This area is accessible by the North East Line MRT(Purple Line),as you proceed up the escalator, you will be able to see both rows of shop houses. There is a few shops selling BBQ pork/chicken slices, famous ones like Lim Chee Guan is located just by the main road, alternatively, you can buy it from Bee Cheng Hiang which is just as good.There is a new food street in between of Trengganu street were you can have the local food like oyster omelet and Char Kuay Teow, (Black Flat Noodles with sliced fish cakes, blood cockles and lap cheong).Do walk all the way to the indian temple called Sri Mariammum which is another Icon,Do remove your shoes before entering and do place some donations in thr temple offering box if you love it"
,,Must see.,5.0,,"Being Singapore. it was a safe, hustle free, evening outing, shopping and browsing and eating,in Chinatown. We had pre arranged a guided city tour and returned via the Hopp on Hopp off Red Bus.

Should you have one evening destination choice only, to treat your wife, to something extraordinary .take the Red Bus..and go to Chinatown. It 'makes' Singapore special.especially at night. Safe, fun, educational. Shall be back."
,,Chinatown,5.0,,"We were last in Singapore 44 years ago, and had been warned that the present Chinatown was nothing like the old. Most of the old buildings have been demolished. Nevertheless, it was a great experience, and had last none of its charm. If you want to eat the same food the locals eat there are plenty of places to do that, probably far cheaper than in a restaurant. A 'Must' place to visit."
,,Vibrant and energetic,4.0,,Nice place to visit for cheap souvenirs. Very clean. Nice restaurants everywhere. Can take ones time and wander through streets and stalls without being pestered to buy goods. Nothing like China but it's more a tongue in the cheek experience. Take it for what it has to offer.
,,Great place for souvenirs and food!,5.0,,"If you are a souvenir hunter, then this is the right place to be! you will find everyyyyything here for cheap prices and after shopping you can have really delicious streetfood there."
,,Similar to all the rest,3.0,,"I find Chinatowns all over the world very contrived, and this one is no different. If you want to experience china, go to china. Frankly, a ""Chinatown"" can be a poor representation of the real thing. Good Chinese food can probably be found in other parts of Singapore rather than Chinatown. Ironically, there has been an influx of real china food in the past 10 years due to the government's massive allowance of china immigrants into the country. But their quality is suspect. In terms of shopping, it's basically low quality trinkets

If you will never have the opportunity to visit china, you can pop here for an hour and tick off the bucket list"
,,Interesting and colourful,4.0,,"The MRT takes you right into the heart of China town but make sure you venture outside of the central area to experience a more genuine China Town.
A good day out walking through the market streets browsing the many stalls. The temple is well worth a look around. Beware that thefts from rucksacks are common. The cafés within the market are very expensive, and if you search out the local cafes they are not only dirt cheap, they have far more atmosphere and experience to them.
We ate in the food hall over the road from the temple. A great experience, you find a table and then buy different dishes from the numerous food kiosks. You get some really good food here. The largest queue was for the fish head soup which I really now wish I'd tried. Its not for the feint hearted as it doesn't look clean, but take some wet wipes and clean the table and cutlery before use."
,,Fabulous Decoration,4.0,,The place looks wonderful at night will all the artistic lamps giving the street a colorful glow. The place is filled with restaurants and shops. They also have a museum and a temple.
,,Worth a look,3.0,,"Went here 3 times. The clothes shopping is mostly for tiny sized people but there was the odd piece for a kiwi size lass.
Most shops won't let you try on the clothes which is frustrating as I would have bought more if I knew things fit.
Felt accosted by some trades people as they stand outside their shop and harass you to come in. Some very polite so you feel rude saying no. It's all a ploy. You need to be hard and assertive or they'll have you inside sitting down trying on $500 rings before you know it! !
Food wasn't too bad and the fruit juices were lovely."
,,"Chinese festivals, shopping, food",4.0,,"Chinatown will keep you busy for the day or night. Lots of shopping, eating and touristy things to do here. Recommend the Buddha tooth relic temple/museum as well. If you are lucky like we were, there will be a Chinese festival going on and the street decorations are fabulous."
,,Not A Good Experience...,2.0,,We did not like this place. Too much crowd than other areas and sticky smell in the road. Food and other items are much cheaper in China town but need to bargain. They ask almost 3-4 times price than the actual sell price.
,,great for knick knacks,4.0,,We ate lunch here. There are a lot of cheap places to pick from. Also great for souvenirs. We caught the mrt .
,,Great shopping,5.0,,"Best Chinatown visted yet. Some good bargins, food section had a lot to choose from, but beware coz ""hot dog"" in NOT a saveloy in a bread roll - it is what it says - I passed on that."
,,Worth a visit and walk around...,4.0,,"Very worthwhile to visit and walk around the market stalls and streets to get a ""feel"" for Singapore. We stopped in a Buddhist temple which was a calming experience in the bustle of Chinatown and I think if you visit Singapore this is a good thing to do to get away from the 'packaged' tourist things and have a bit of an explore. I had some clothes made by one of the tailors there which was a good service.
We walked back to our hotel by the bay, alongside the Merlion, fabulous little wine bars and bistros to pop in."
,,Really good,4.0,,"I was impressed by the China town. We got down at ChinaTown MRT station and walked along the Pagoda street all the way to the Sri Mariamman temple. Bought lots of souvenirs from there..
Bargaining wont help that much as most of items are fixed price.
A must visit while in Singapore"
,,Nothing Special,3.0,,"Just an area of Singapore where there are a lot of Chinese stores, restaurants, and other businesses catering to the Chinese population. There are a lot of nicer Chinatowns in the world."
,,"lots to shop, lots to eat",4.0,,"Everybody should take a look at Singapores chinatown. Try out chinatown seafood restaurant, directly in the center (red tables, yellow chairs), good place to get cheap chili and pepper crab in this area of Singapore!"
,,Chinatown Singapore - one of my favourite hangout places,5.0,,Plenty of good food at good prices. A variety of shopping and great window shopping experience as well. Every type of merchandise can be found around this place. I come to this place practically every other week.
,,Peaceful and quite area,5.0,,"China Town is impressive here. Every houses sell Chinese products. I bought a lot of souvenirs when coming here. Mainly Chinese traditional med & tea products. Different from Marina Bay which is always busy, China Town is much more quite and peaceful. There are marts selling cheap products. However, there is nothing much about those marts to expect."
,,Wow,5.0,,We went in to Chinatown for dinner and wow . Lots of awesome vendors and little places to eat . The sights & sounds and atmosphere was just great
,,Shops galore,5.0,,"I liked the shopping vibe here. Good area to pick up smaller souvenirs, and there are lots of camera and jewelry shops. While most prices are firm for souvenirs, there was wild variations on the prices for jewelry and camera stuff- especially if you start to walk out! If you know what you want I think its possible to get some bargains. There are tons of eating establishments and you can easily spend half a day here just exploring."
,,Chinatown in Singapore,5.0,,Heaps of cheap souvenir shopping opportunities. Great food for lunch from as little as $3.50. Great variety of stalls. Be prepared to walk and avoid if you don't like crowds! Otherwise go and shop till you drop!
,,Great Place full if Chinese Culture,4.0,,"This really is a Gem if a place, such a contrast from the usual Singapore High Ruse Skyscrapers. If you enjoy markets that are busying with colour and everything under the sun this definitely is a must. Eateries by the dozen, all serving great food at reasonable prices. Market traders just about selling everything all at discounted prices compared to the rest if Singapore. On the cultural side, do gaze up and admire the wonderful old buildings that are lovingly cared for. And don't forget to check out the Green Mosque and the colourful Hindu Temple."
,,Good souvenir shopping,4.0,,"My kid is making noise wanted to go shopping, so we decided to bring him over to Chinatown. There is a walking street full of souvenir shops at great prices. Next to it, restaurants and hawker centers are convenience for tourists."
,,Historical Attraction Preserved,4.0,,"Chinatown aka Niu Che Shui is an ethnic neighbourhood featuring distinctly Chinese cultural elements and a historically concentrated ethnic Chinese population. Chinatown is located near the heart of Singapore. Large sections of it have been declared national heritage sites officially designated for conservation by the Authorities.

Today's Chinatown comprises five districts; namely Telok Ayer, Bukit Pasoh, Tanjong Pagar, Kreta Ayer and Ann Siang Hill. Designated as conservation areas by the Urban Redevelopment Board in 1989, these districts have over the years cultivated their own unique identity.

Besides being known for its picturesque places of worship, Telok Ayer also features quirky shops, cafes and drinking holes, all found on the slopes of Ann Siang Hill. A recent influx of new businesses and developments have filled the slopes of Ann Siang Hill with quirky shops, cafes and drinking holes - making it a great weekend hangout for the younger crowd. The heart of Chinatown, Kreta Ayer is home to an assortment of traditional trades, homegrown brands and some of the best hawker food around.

Travelling to Chinatown is not difficult. Chinatown MRT Station (NE4/DT19) is a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station on the North East Line and the Downtown Line in Singapore. On the North East Line, it lies between the Outram Park and Clarke Quay MRT stations and between Telok Ayer and Fort Canning MRT stations on the Downtown Line. It is directly below and serves the district of Chinatown. There are also many buses which serves this high traffic destinations.

My favorite place in Chinatown is the Chinatown Market and Food Centre. Basement is where the wet market is located. Here many people can get daily groceries at a very cheap rate. and of cause Level 1 is where there are many shops selling clothes and accessories at a very cheap rate too! Then at Level 2 is where the food centre is located. You must visit and try to know how good the food there is, there is also a wide range of variety of food."
,,Place to find hidden jewel,4.0,,"Chinatown S'pore have a nice mixture of historical structures. There are many mode of transport to get you there. The easiest is take the train (SMRT). There are plenty bargain souvenirs outlet. The people there are friendly. You really need to venture the place on foot to find the hidden jewel. You will be surprised that you may stumble upon good bargain antiques. Food is not an issue coz you have plenty of selection. From fast food, hawker stalls or restaurant."
,,Local food with many choices and shopping at a reasonable price.,4.0,,"If you want try Chinese foods and place where you can look for China stuffs. This will be the right place. Lots of nice local foods and must try.
Festive shopping and wonderful experience of season must come the durning the Chinese New Year there will be flea market just like Taiwan night market and once in the life time experience."
,,"chinatown, singapore",4.0,,"Chinatown singapore is near the MRT train station. It has many shops, colourful and bought the dried pork which is very nice to eat. The price is cheap and good value for money"
,,Shops shops and more shops!,4.0,,If you are looking for a place to buy cheap souvenirs go to chinatown! Its a place where you can grab a handful of local cuisines as well
,,China Town alright!,5.0,,"Just as I imagined, everything you could think of, a chance to barter, busy with people from all over and full of vibrant colours. Great place to visit."
,,Must See!,4.0,,"Having been to several Chinatowns across the US, I must say Singapore's takes the cake. Not only is it large, its much cleaner and vibrant than those in the U.S. Great place to buy Singapore gifts to take home. Also plenty of places to eat. Free Wi-Fi also throughout Chinatown, however hard to log onto with no Singaporean phone number."
,,Perfect place for souvenir hunting!,4.0,,everything you need is in china town. I enjoyed this place because its very lively and you will never get bored. there are a lot of souvenir stores and food hawkers. i feel save walking around even at nice. it is a must visit in singapore!
,,"Great attraction, good variety, and value",5.0,,"It was suggested we do the ChinaTown Tour - Tour East. We had a fantastic night out in China Town.
It included a visit to Yong Gallery, dinner at a chinese restaurant, shopping time in China Town, a Trishaw ride to Clarke Quay, which was great fun, and a bumboat cruise along the Singapore River. The tour is good value and china town in the evening really comes alive."
,,Vibrant and colourful,3.0,,"Chinatown were having a festival when we visited, there were huge colourful flowers adorning the roads. It was very busy as we visited at lunch time. The food we bought was from a Hawker market, although all the restaurants in the same road were also trying to get our business. Food was cheap and okay but nothing special, maybe we chose the wrong stall? The stalls were set up for tourists and very cheap, definitely the place to go if you want cheap items to take home for friends, although not the best quality. We found a lady who did calligraphy while you watched which was fascinating, she was so fast!! We bought 3 pieces from her she was so good. Overall a very interesting experience."
,,Chinatown - a microcosm global cuisines/cultures,3.0,,Myriad of restaurants; all cultures. Affordable. Historic British colonial architecture. Multi-cultural. Handy access.
,,Very busy- great cheap souvenirs,4.0,,Very easy to reach on the MRT. Lots of nice cheap souvenirs. Chinatown Food area is busy but a great experience and the food is so cheap compared with the rest of Singapore!
,,Time visits to Chinese holidays,4.0,,"if possible. I was there during the Mid-Autumn festival, so they had flowers strung across the road, which made it look a lot nicer. Chinatown also hosts the Buddha Tooth Museum and Sri Mariammam Temple, which are both neat attractions. They are less than a five minute walk apart, so it's worth seeing both if you are in the area. For those interested in shopping, prices are reportedly cheaper in Chinatown than elsewhere, though most of the stands are open air, so there is no air conditioning or stalls to try things on."
,,Nice local food,4.0,,"Right in Chinatown, there's a big food complex where at level 2 is a place where you can get nice cheap local food. Here is also the place for you to grab cheap souvenirs.
Only problem, if it rains, not much place to hide as shelter area will be crowded."

,,Nice area to explore,4.0,,Friendly people. Yummy food. Was just like being in China (which I have visited on 3 occasions). Great Chinese massages and Portuguese egg custard tarts to die for.
,,Always busy,4.0,,Visited last August. Having visited Chinatowns all over the world including Beijing - I have to say they are a great place to spend an hour or so. They are all vibrant lively places. This one is bigger than most. Some brilliant cafés to people watch from and rest up a while. The usual touristy bits. Busy busy!
,,A Place to buy souvenir,4.0,,"Here you can buy souvenir , that you wish to take with you, to gift it for your relatives, near to MRT station. Also famous for its Food Street."
,,Loved my Chinatown experience,5.0,,"I loved this area of Singapore. The markets are great, you can pick up lots of nic-knacks for great prices. The food street is amazing, so many dishes to choose from and really cheap! If you like markets and good food, visit Chinatown!"
,,a nice wander,3.0,,"Let me start with food. We had a very nice salad lunch (vegetarian) in a cafe right next to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. It was good to sit down after wandering around. Lots and lots of shops, as is true for all over Singapore. I don't recall the name of the shops we went to but they are on the side of the temple - one with chopsticks, fans and hand made combs. Another that had various kind of sweets and I wish I had indulged in the green tea nougat. These two or three shops stick in the mind but the other shops/ stalls with souvenirs - worth a look but if you have been to Chinatowns in other countries, or to China, then...you may not want to linger. But along the way walking towards the Chinese heritage museum, we asked at an Indian jewelry shop if there was anywhere we could get a foot massage (accupressure in this case)and there was. An older Chinese lady who held fort summoned others on her mobile to deal with the many feet our group presented (all aching from a rather long wander the previous day) while we lay back in a dim lit room. It was rather relaxing and feet were soon restored to a state of bliss. Worth the dollars! But so blissed out were we that we decided to skip the well recommended heritage museum and head on back to our hotel. We came across plaques with the history of the streets and that was interesting. And I wished I had managed to read up a bit more before my visit. It was a nice day."
,,Chinatown like all other Chinatowns,3.0,,"It's the same everywhere, but this one is bigger, be prepared for the shop keepers to do everything except kidnap you off the street to come into the shops, pretty good place for small, cheap souvenirs."
,,Best street market,5.0,,Always have to visit Chinatown. Just walk around & enjoy. Great inexpensive hotels & Singapores best street market shopping.
,,An eye opener,5.0,,"Visited this area and was shocked by the vast variety of foods, smells and shops that sold anything from souvenirs, clothes, to jars full of mystery animals. Bizarre ! Would advise just sitting down and having a drink and people watching as it gets very busy and on times crammed. Although there is so much food to choose from in the market I would be careful what you eat. Also is you have the time have a head massage as there are relatively cheap and very relaxing, which will help you escape the busy hustle bustle of the market. Definitely worth a repeat visit."
,,Leisure place to visit,3.0,,The recently restored food centre - Smith Street is brilliant. You can visit there after 3pm onward. You may also get a bonus drink b4 5pm ;)
,,Art craft and Tintin Shop!,4.0,,"We went to China Town because Tintin Shop Singapore is there. Many shops within the area selling souvenirs and art crafts, also food stall, but we din't try the food though. It is easy to reach by MRT so you will easily go there. The old buildings keep it's china heritage yet few buildings around it shows more modern side. You can also find a temple at the end of the street. The garden bridge crossing the main street is also a good place to sit and rest while viewing the Chinatown from second level."
,,Overload your senses,4.0,,"Great place to visit. The temples, the food, the market. Worthwhile taking a seat just for a drink to just people watch. We were there during Chinese New Year. Not very well explained for tourists and it was difficult to obtain information as to what was happening despite doing our homework before heading out to Singapore. That being said the decorations in the streets and around the temples were amazing. Worth a visit both day and night as the whole place changes. Tours can be arranged from the Tourist Office within Chinatown."
,,Lots of everything for the tourist,4.0,,"There are so many shops and stalls that sell almost anything for the average/budget tourist. Souvenirs are abundant and there is so much to see and do. Go back in time to experience Singapore in the old days. With the new 30 stall Food street where famous hawkers selling Singapore food is gathered together at one place, this is a food paradise. So much to choose from and definitely worth a repeat visit if you have the time and money to spend on affordable gifts and souvenirs for friends and family."
,,"Nice souvenirs, good price, nice food.",4.0,,Good place to get souvenirs! Very good price ;) and nice place to get food too. This is the best Chinatown I have been. It's clean and convenient to reach by mrt.
,,Loved Chinatown!,5.0,,"Fantastic shops, temples and street food. This was the highlight of my trip to Singapore. Have room in your bag for your new purchases!"
,,Chinatwon - Well worth the trip,4.0,,"Great place to stroll and spend a half day grab or more. Ton of food options and trinkets/souvenir shopping. There are also a variety of places to explore nearby like the various temples (Hindu/ Bhuddist) , Chinese / asian medicine shops, spas and roadside cafe/bars. Free wifi which is always a bonus to stay connected via Skype with family/friends ;)"
,,Best Food in Singapore,4.0,,I am a great fan of Chinese cuisine especially Sichuan Dishes and the best place to find all my favourite food in Singapore is none other than Chinatown.
,,Food and souvenirs!,4.0,,"Nice atmospheric place to buy some yummy food and some reasonably priced souvenirs. Love the look of the Chinese styled buildings, and make sure you stop by the religious buildings that are nearby to chinatown!"
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"I love going to the different Chinatowns in the countries I travel too,never a disappointment.Love all the different foods and people"
,,Just for food,4.0,,Just for some delicious chinese food. Very cheap and delicious. Cooked fresh. Walking distance straight from clarke Quay.
,,Heaven for Street Food Lovers,4.0,,"Chinatown is an interesting place with people buzzing around. The entire place is mostly crowded by native locals and foreigners who are here to see two temples nearby or just to try out the amazing range of street food offerings. There are also shops from where you could buy gifts or souvenirs. You can reach to Chinatown either by MRT or by any other public and private transport. Althought you would have to walk through quite a distance if you want to use the MRT. The food stalls around the Tooth Relic temple is amazing. You can find Thai to Chinese, Continental to European, Scandinavian to African food."
,,Love the vibe..,4.0,,Love te hussle and bussle of Chinatown.Place is packed and couldn't eat unfortunately.Love being in China without having to go there.
,,Smith Street Food not to be missed.,5.0,,Great food at prices that you can't believe. Fantastic selection of delicacies and you can fill up for under $7.50. Beer is cheap also including Heineken. Lots of basic Tourist goods & souvenirs BUT shop around as prices vary between stall holders.
,,Multi-cultures Experience,5.0,,"Chinatown, Little India and Kampong Glam are within walking distance. The area is bustling with food and markets at night."
,,"Great for souvenirs and food, but don't expect a lot. Very LOCAL-packed also.",3.0,,"Easily accessible by MRT or Taxi, Singapore's Chinatown is bustling with local Chinese businesses and architecture both old and new, a packed market-area, and who cannot escape the range of food stalls available!

Chinatown is worth checking out if you'd like to shop or pick up souvenirs. Don't expect much though, nearly every single stall sells the same range and type of products. And beware of overpriced goods too, some of the miniatures in particular are far more cheaper in the souvenir shops at the airport or in the main city! Keep an eye for $1-$2 shops though, they are by far the best bargains you can find and tend to sell the same range of products mentioned earlier at more cheaper prices.

Its also worth mentioning too that this district is very 'connected', in other words there's wi-fi everywhere no matter where you step within Chinatown. It's free too!"
,,Tourist area with non-tourist prices!,5.0,,"I am a local and what I've realized is that this place offers (standard, cheesy) souvenirs at very very affordable prices. Unpretentious chinatown with chinese calligraphy services, duty free perfume (???), souvenirs, and everything else and cheap beer. Weirdly there is also a Tintin museum... When you are here, rest assured you will not be ripped off!

Do check out the open air food street (open evenings till late), although I would direct you to the smith street hawker centre for a more authentic (and cheaper) meal."
,,Go with a Local. Experience Singapore's Culture.,4.0,,"Singapore is composed of different races but possibly the most dominant are the Chinese. In Chinatown, there's always an interesting store or knick knacks nearby. Go with a local and ask directions for the best and (cheap) xiao long pao (dimsum with soup inside)."
,,The best for interesting shopping,5.0,,"Fantastic little shops and markets with beautiful knick-knacks, such as porcelain tea sets, jade dragons, teapots, kimonos, chopstick sets etc. No one was pushy, everyone polite and keen for you to look at their wares. So much to see, then eat at the Chinatown Food Hall, in the centre. Excellent duck rice!"
,,top class chinatown,4.0,,"Good to see one fo the best chinatown outside of China. Very clean, colorfull, safety. You can see Chinese culture and history. Close to metro, you will need 1-2 hours to see it. Also you will find planty of shops and good restaurants."
,,Lots of interesting food options,5.0,,"There are many interesting traditional Chinese medical shops, stores selling souvenirs, local mini markets, temples and food options. Don't forget to try out the various hawker centers (e.g. Hong Lim food center) in Chinatown - there are many food options at cheap prices."
,,Veritable Fun Place,5.0,,Chinatown is simply fabulous with it's many little shops selling all sorts of items including numerous local snacks freshly made in your presence. It is best to take a walk in the late afternoon when the sun is going down and it is both cool and breezy. During the weeks before the annual Lunar New Year the area becomes even more lively albeit a trifle crowded.
,,Typical Chinese area,4.0,,"We walked the Chinatown area, visited a few temples, did some shopping in the street vendor area. Had a nice lunch. Perfume is a good buy here."
,,"Poor service in Chinatown, even to locals.",1.0,,"I'm was extremely shocked to receive such bad service in my own country. there was this ridiculous shop selling hand held fans, (only 1 in the whole street, not difficult to spot.) The shop hangs a sign ""no phototaking"". Tourist attraction and photos cannot be taken? Wanted to buy over 20+ fans to give business to this store but the shop owner did not bother to ask despite we were obviously locals & chided us for taking photo. His bad attitude just turned off all our moods. What kind of mentality is this! I would have suspect no phototaking is to prevent tourist from taking selfies but we went to the shop with a purpose to purchase their fans."
,,Wonderful stay in Singapore,5.0,,Singapore is a wonderful experience and just loved visiting Chinatown. There is a variety of Chinese cuisines here so there is something for everyone.
,,Perfume great prices to be had,4.0,,We need to buy perfume for my sister and this is definitely the place to buy it we got Estee Lauder and YSL at least 50% cheaper than even the duty free price at the airport. Have plenty of time as it is bigger than you think if you have the time to look. We also got Camera equipment here I needed a lens for my Pentax which I could not get in a lot of places we got a great price and a great lens ended up buying a new camera case as well. My Son and I had a foot massage That wasn't relaxing at all. There is an under cover section where I managed to get a great comfortable pair of shoes for $10 and a lovely handbag for my Daughter. No brand names here so if you are a brand name person you need to go to Orchard RD. Plenty of places to have something to eat I loved watching them cook it be aware if you don't like heat in your spices be careful what you order. Toilets are hard to find so don't leave it till the last minute.
,,"Trishaws, lights and music",5.0,,"Had a blast the kids really had a fun time, great guide as we did the Chinatown tour - Trishaws, dinner, markets, harbor cruise at night - lovely way to spend our last night in Singapore highly recommend this to families :)"
,,Fantastic at night,5.0,,"The food stall street was light and airy, has interesting seafood eg fried oysters (delicious) and consumer friendly seating and clearing of plates. This is well organised and is a most interesting way to spend an evening."
,,Best China Town !,5.0,,"Have seen many China Town in Asia.

I would grade this as the best China town in Asia. It is clean and really beautiful and very big.

Everytime I visit Singapore, this is definitely a place I will not miss .

Reasonable pricing for the food and souveniors on sale in China Town.

Love it."
,,Bring my international friends to this place,5.0,,"This place have alots of history and the best is the place have alots of good foods selling and cheap if you go hawker center. It have good place to looking around about how Chinese people stayed here in olders days.

Tips to go there is Lunar New year eve (Chinese New Year eve), going at this period all the shop selling cheap and get discount because they want to clear stock. The cheaper that I brought was new year rice cake cost 30 cents only since 1 year ago."
,,Great Culture and food,5.0,,"Fantastic place to visit at night. We saw it during the day and then that night and it comes alive at night, plenty of food options all fresh cooked in front of you. Sit down and share a meal together and enjoy the atmosphere!"
,,OK Chinatown,3.0,,"I suppose I am spoiled as I have seen many Chinatowns around the world. This one is fine lots of shops, we purchased some bone knives and bits and bobs. There were many many people which made getting into the shops and seeing what was on the other side of the road difficult but it is great for people watching. We checked out the temple and saw some interesting buildings on the way to Chinatown."
,,Busy place to enjoy a bit of people watching,4.0,,"Lots of places to eat both fancy and casual.

There also many many different types of market stall where can grab a bargain!

The number of people that visit here you also can't help but people watch and it is extremely fun with all types walking around!!"
,,Good place to be,4.0,,"i have been to other China town's but this one was special.....Loads of shops to shop , good atmospher + place where you get Soveiners........Specially they have a TINTIN SHOWROOM in Chinatown which is worth watching...Also, many of the jewellery shops are located within the People's Park Complex.....
You you small electronic items in the complex ( Made in China ) but worth a visit."
,,Similar to other Chinatown but worth a visit,4.0,,"If you have been to other Chinatowns before, this one won't be much different. However, it's still worth a visit! There is great food (with awesome prices) and lots of tourist shopping. It's also fairly clean for a China market. I suggest visiting along with Clarke Quay since they are walkable distances."
,,Shopping at Chinatown and Arab Street Singapore,2.0,,"Persevere with the the humidity and compare prices. Tony's Fashions on South Bridge Road charged Singapore $187.00 for Batik Kaftans, even though I purchased 4 of them. While Happy Harry's Shop, further down the street quoted Singapore $135.00 for one similar garment. Happy Harry's has a website: www.happyharrytailor.com.sg and has a far greater selection of fabrics than Tony's Fashions. So be careful, don't get ripped off as we were.

Arab Street is a fascinating area to visit. It has the most magnificent range of fabrics and products. There is a wide range of Batik fabrics available at AIK Bee Reality Co 69/73 Arab Street. Move around the area into Bussorah Street, where you can buy very reasonable priced good quality souvenirs and Batik products and materials by the yard/metre.

Both shopping areas are fairly central. Taxis are very reasonably priced"
,,Great place to vist,5.0,,"Full of history and culture. The buddhist temple is wonderful, as are the quaint stalls, streets, cafes, etc. in the area. Well worth spending a morning/afternoon."
,,Clean safe junk market,3.0,,"Not much different to any other collection of stalls selling junk to tourists, but it is clean and the sales people aren't as in your face as elswhere.
Best to go a couple of streets away from the main tourist strip to get a real sense of what the area is like. Find the out of the way hawker markets for good cheap food - even if you have no idea what you are eating. Check the cleanliness ratings on the store, so you don't get cockroaches with your organge juice as we did :-)
Take a walking tour you'll get to learn more of the history.
Revisit the area before 9am, when the streets are deserted and you can get a better look at the architecture."
,,Cleanest Chinatown we've ever visited,4.0,,"In our view, it's a regular Chinatown, but absolutely spotless. It's almost eerie and un-Chinatown-like, if I may say. We loved walking around before hearing to the Breakout Room. This is where to go to pick up ubiquitous SE Asian clothing and souvenirs if you're so inclined."
,,Barter with everyone,4.0,,Found quite a few good deals here. Can get very crowded on the weekends. Be sure to check our the pedestrian streets and the temples.
,,"Great variety of food, good shopping, fun atmosphere",4.0,,"A visit to Chinatown in Singapore is a must with so many good and cheap food options, fun shops and a nice atmosphere. We were lucky to be there at the start of the Singapore food festival so there were extra special food offers, etc."
,,Must see destination!,5.0,,"I could say that besides Merlion Park, Marina Bay and Universal Studios, Chinatown is a place that travellers must visit when come Singapore. Plenty of nice souvernirs, cheap food here. You could also rent a inexpensive room here."
,,Its where the locals go,3.0,,"Clarke Quay is good, but for better value local meals, Chinatown is where it's at. Cheaper Singapore Chilli Crabs can be had here."
,,Great food and loads of shopping,4.0,,"We stayed here and it was a great location, plenty to see and do with so many great restaurants close by. The trains are close by and taxis are very cheap. Loved it"
,,Go to while in Singapore,4.0,,There were a few of us that went to Lau Pa Sat for dinner then walked on to China Town. We were not disapointed. All the lanterns all lit up at night time. If your looking for that tourist souvenir you can definately get that. It has a lovely atmosphere and everyone is nice and friendly.
,,Great for Exploring,5.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is a great place for exploring. There is so much to see. Try Chicken Rice from one of the many street cafes, it is so cheap. There are many tailors that offer handmade suits and shirts. I've been having my suits made in Singapore now for a few years, they are well made with Italian or English material and wear really well, plus they fit perfectly. I use Raffles Creation Tailor on South Bridge Road, however there are many tailors in the area. Try and get to Chinatown for Chinese New Year, we were there for 2014 for the first time. What an amazing experience, the atmosphere was electric."
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,Had a wonderful lunch on a corner cafe and thoroughly enjoyed the market with great gifts and souveneirs. Definitely worth a visit
,,Go see it.,4.0,,"We had never seen anything quite like Chinatown in Singapore. If you are looking that gift for someone back home who is impossible to buy for, go here....you'l find it."
,,Don't miss the Chinatown Heritage Centre,4.0,,"While you're in Chinatown, don't miss the Chinatown Heritage Centre (48 Pagoda Street). It's a small museum but it has 15 halls, each of which displays a particular theme re-enacting the harsh life of immigrants from China in the 19th century. Through the display of replicates of cubicles they inhabited, the narrow wooden staircases of that time, the artifacts of the day-to-day struggling to survive, you'll be touched by the harsh conditions they had endured and would treasure more what you have now."
,,Great food nic nacks,5.0,,Great to browse around for nic nacks. We bought some t shirts with tin tin on at the rin tin tin shop plus I bought a key ring .We had lovely dumplings .
,,Great Place for Budget shopping,4.0,,"If you looking for small gift or shopping of souvenirs etc. from Singapore, must visit China Town market.Be it Clothes, bags, Cosmetics, Footwear etc.... Items at very reasonable price as compared to big Malls and Big Shops."
,,different from other chinatowns,4.0,,"it seems that every country will have a region named chinatown but this one in singapore was a bit special. it's not called chinatown in chinese but niu che shui. very rich history behind the name and buildings, unlike the other chinatowns that were made so that chinese people can come together. this was a place of history and culture. very touristy though, so i wasn't really sure if the experience i got was authentic, especially food wise because smith street tends to be slightly more expensive then other hawker centres in singapore. lots of backpacker hostels in the area too, where i stayed. they have got awesome dim sum and chinese food you cannot find in the states though."
,,Best Chinatown by a country mile,5.0,,"After seeing good things about this Chinatown, we decided to go on a lazy Sunday afternoon to see what all the hubbub was about.

Simply put - this Chinatown is amazing. It's clean, well organised but retains its unique charm with bustling streets and vendors yelling out their ways. Souvenirs is a must buy here - nice and cheap, but a decent variety.

The tintin shop is a MUST visit for fans of the series - I was awestruck!"
,,Great place for souvenir shopping,4.0,,"Very busy with lots to see and plenty of places to eat and shop for gifts to take home. Before you buy anything look around because the price differs from stall to stall, we found that out the hard way after spending $25 on an item only to find it in the nearby street for half that. There is a great little shop in food street called the Noodle Man, yummy food, very nice staff and you can watch the noodles being made. There is a temple you must see in temple street, the decorations are amazing. Worth the visit."
,,Hustle and Bustle,4.0,,"Though very busy, it was easy to get around and visit the markets and shop for that all important souvenir. Plenty of options for a meal, that was both cheap and good."
,,For shopping alcoholics,4.0,,Just have look of wonderful and colourful buildings ant attractive lighting and various chines goods being sold. Bargain do happen in the market and overall good for visiting once
,,"""Great place to explore""",4.0,,This is a great place to wonder around looking at the many market stalls and hunt for bargains and gifts. This is one of my favourite places to go when in Singapore.
,,Very nice in Chinatown,5.0,,We really loved and enjoyed Chinatown in Singapore as it is one of very few authentic places in the so very clinical city of Singapore. Nice and friendly people and certainly very nice to stroll around.
,,Straight from a movie,4.0,,"As my first Chinatown that i've ever been to, I was amazed by how much it looked like the china town from the movies. It has a more, shall I put it, ""authentic"" Asian vibe there. Great hawker centre ,Maxwell Food Centre, nearby with chicken rice and such. We got our fairly priced (5 SGD) tourist t-shirts here. Fun vibe, definately should be visited in order to see a different side of Singapore."
,,A wonderful shopping ride,5.0,,"This is a perfect place for shopping, especially when you try to find reasonable-priced souvenirs and original Chinese hand-crafted materials. The place offers hundreds of shops ranging from food, clothing, magnets, magnificent Chinese hand-made crafts. Best of all, the price is right! Also, this is a free wi-fi zone."
,,Your typical Chinatown,4.0,,"If you into cheap food and clothing then this is the place. There are countless of stores selling china products at bargain basement price.

It is noisy and crowded, this place goes crazy during festive season.

Behind Chinatown is where I prefer. The food court is called Maxwell and locate behind a large temple holding a relic of Lord Buddha. Inside the food court at the entrance from the temple is a chicken rice place. Many local consider this as the best chicken rice in Singapore.

Overall Chinatown is great for bargain hunters and cuisine seekers. Return again yes to Maxwell chicken rice. You can't really missed the place, just follow the queue."
,,Good fun,4.0,,"Great to see, very quaint, lots to see and some bargains to be had for tourist souvenirs to bring home. everything is pristinely clean, good food and felt very safe, even though we were there late at night."
,,China town at it's best,5.0,,"We spent an afternoon in China town and what an amazing afternoon it was. We visited the Buddha tooth relic and museum, it was an experience we would recommend to all who get to see China town. The restaurants and shops are just beyond belief, we brought great kids clothes at a great price plus all the usual nick nacks. We did all of our sightseeing from the excellent big red bus it stopped just opposite the fantastic traders hotel."
,,Cleanest ChinaTown,5.0,,"Very organised and well kept. The walkways are spacious and clean, partially sheltered from the heat and rain. Food prices are decently priced and good bargains from the stalls.. A good place to spend the evenings as its cooler towards the night."
,,For lovers of Chinese Food and Shopping,4.0,,For cheap holiday souvenirs and a million other things you would never need Chinatown is a shoppers paradise - the restaurants however serve some great food
,,Worth a visit to chinatown,4.0,,"Cheap meals, very easy to find and a short walk to our hotel.( Riverview ) There are many places to eat and the food is being cooked in front of you."
,,tour of china town is not of worth,2.0,,"directly come to china town by taxi as booking tour for china town is of no worth as guide don't go with you in china town. things are costly. you have to bargain and say 4-5 times lower price in comparison with the price offered by shopkeeper. I bought bag for my I-pad .he offered 70 Singapore dollar and I offered 20 dollar and finally deal in 25 dollar. shopping at china town is of no value and only for souvenir purpose ,few items of cheap value can buy."
,,Superb food and souvenir shopping,4.0,,"The path I took: Get off the MRT at China Town station. Take exit A onto temple street. Walk along the street, taking in the sights, sounds and smells. I did all my souvenir shopping here. Move onto the parallel road with all the food stalls. Sample the wonderful cuisine at the street stalls. Finish at the serene Buddha tooth relic temple."
,,exciting shopping,4.0,,"1st off all I was pleasantly surprised at how clean Chinatown was,although after visiting Singapore for the 1st time I was hoping to maybe seeing a cigarette butt or something to make me feel at home but nothing......the cleanest city I have ever seen or been to.
great bargains everywhere ,very friendly stall holders...although I did get sick off the locals trying to sell me made to measure suits,1 was enough.chinatown not normally my cup off tea but my wife @ I really enjoyed the experience"
,,Visit China Town but dine in PotatoHead Restaurant,4.0,,China Town is great fun but if you are hungry and want to enjoy a wonderful Art Deco building visit Potato Head. I had the best cheeseburger of my life and a home made chocolate mousse that defies description in its gloriously decadent taste
,,Such an out-of-expectation experience,4.0,,"It was very nice. i mean, the ""chinatown"" concept in my idea was vastly different from what i saw at the one in SG. It was a very peaceful place, or at least it's the feeling i got when visiting there. i went there in the very early morning, around 7-8am, after a light rain, so the air was nearly perfect, humid and cool, even though it's summer time. the streets were very nice to walk along, and you can shop many little tiny lovely things there. it's a very different angle of SG, something...traditional to add in between the typical modern SG"
,,"Plenty to see, taste and experience My China!",4.0,,"Singapore's Chinatown is a chi energy zone second to none. While its confines are not strict, the main streets of Pagoda, Mosque, Smith and Temple do the honours for garish, tourist trap and access from the Chinatown station on the underground is right there.
Across South Bridge Road is the delightful enclave of Ang Siang Hill and Club Street, where French bistros and bars proliferate, although housed in restored Straits Chinese shop houses.
Smith Street has the best kitchen shops in the world! While they mainly cater for the trade they happily sell you a prized cooking pot from Italy or a wok from China.
Food is Chinatown's overarching allure, from the simple Malay cafe on the corner of South Bridge and Temple to the raucous street stalls on all the interconnecting lanes there is a cuisine for all tastes. In Cockney rhyming slang, China plate means ""mate"" or friend, thus the expression ""My China""."
,,a must visit when in Singapore,4.0,,"A great place to shop. If you want that different gift for those at home this is the place to come. Not a bad place to bargain, to gmet the price you want."
,,Nothing Special,3.0,,"A friend of mine insisted on going to Chinatown at night so I tagged along. Unfortunately, it was disappointing. It really does not come alive until after dark, when the streets are filled with stalls selling cheap souvenirs, t-shirts and the usual herbal medicine products. Just as disappointing - shark fin for sale everywhere. I did have a decent outside dinner of baby lobsters stir fried in dried chilies, which cost me about US$70 for 2."
,,Eating in Chinatown,4.0,,"Exellent variety of stalls to choose from, we enjoyed a large open food court with the food prepared in front of us, the aromas were divine ! A must for any foodie folks."
,,full of character and colour,5.0,,"Chinatown, Singapore is a must if your in the city. Full of colour and bustling with activity it's easy to get caught up with the hype and spend a few of your Singaporean bucks on a memento or two with the friendly sellers.. The prices are reasonable, especially for produce, and the standard of hygiene cannot be faulted. If your in the city, even for a short stopover, make your way to Chinatown and have some fun"
,,"Love, love, love this place!",5.0,,"Singapore Chinatown is a wonderful place to visit. Quite clean, lots of wonderful restaurants and food stalls, sellers who are willing to bargain but are not too pushy, lots of souvenirs to buy. Just a very interesting place overall."
,,Too crowded .,3.0,,I have been there many times. This is a place I love to visit though crowded. I love the market stalls. They sell things cheaper. Also lot of cheap eating places. My favourite drink there is Sugar cane . It's very refreshing in hot & humid weather.
,,Lots of stalls,3.0,,There were many stalls and not that many people when we visited mainly tourist souvenirs and tailors if you need a suit run up.
,,Pretty authentic,4.0,,Great place to go if you want the china experience outside of China. The food is pretty authentic and decently priced. Be mindful that with the authenticity you will also get the hawking from merchants as if you were in a Chinese marketplace.
,,"Great food vendors, best massage ever!",5.0,,"We visited Chinatown on our first day in Singapore and the day before we left to return home. We had such a good time in Chinatown. Yummy bakwa (delicious meat jerky) and seafood on skewers from the street vendors. I wish we had been hungry enough to try more. It all looked delicious. Walked into OD Wellness for a massage and reflexology. Not at all relaxing, but certainly beneficial. We booked another massage before flying home and I'm certain it helped reduce the strain of travel."
,,Hustle and Bustle for a taste of something different.,5.0,,"A far cry from the modern glass and metal building that make up a large pert of the City, Chinatown feels more real, more in your face, an assault on the senses. Spare a few hours to walk aimlessly and don't be afraid to pull up a chair and sample the local cuisine. Colourful and noisy. You should not miss it."
,,The cleanest Chinatown I've seen,4.0,,"When traveling, I always make sure I go to Chinatown to do my souvenir shopping. This place didn't disappoint me. They have souvenirs like 3 for 10 sgd. The souvenirs are nice and omg, it's the cleanest Chinatown i've been too."
,,Visit during the Chinese New Year,4.0,,"during the Chinese New Year time,this whole area becomes vivid with street light ups and crowds haggling to buy CNY decorations,talismans and other knick-knacks. There are also CNY sweets which you can sample for free before buying and the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a beauty. Maxwell food centre is ever famous for its street food."
,,lots of shopping,3.0,,"Mostly shopping of little souvenir trinkets here - lots of 3 for $10 deals. Had an ABC (apple, beet, carrot) smoothie, which was very refreshing in the midst of the humidity of Singapore in March (even at night). Bargained for some clothing as well. Overall, a very touristy feel, and very crowded."
,,as always be cautious,3.0,,As you know your parents and advisory have told anyone just be careful of new places.Seems renovated but there are tricks to get money from you.There is a scenic garden walkbridge too.Do you get a good service?...debatable.But Businesses will be located here.Also many prominent worldclass shops are here.Everyone has to start somewhere in life but do not get lured by funny promises.To the Advantage of the Chinatown Area a new Subroute Downtown has been created.Your eyes will be dazzled by the improvements and relative wealth.A good place for a short holiday But readers of this write up should contact me before you venture to this place.Basically nothing is cheap or free in this world...just lower your expectations or be an adjusting type and cautious of dealings.Recently took my Brazilian pal here who wanted to see a sanitised Chinatown.He too exclaimed about the mixed nature of things here.Some people will willingly show their thighs and assets to you.
,,"Not the real deal, but take it as it is",3.0,,"I think that this is a mixed bag - it is certainly not authentically ""Chinese"", but is rather a cleaned-up, touristy version of it. On the plus side, it does have some good food and a couple of attractions that justify its name.

Like some similar ""Chinatowns"" in Asia, you'll find merchandise that is really obviously catered to crowds of tourists. it's far from authentic but take it in the right spirit - this is the time to indulge in cheap, cheery and cheesy, whether it's giant ""Hello Kitty"" merchandise or little fake silk Chinese dresses to hold wine bottles. Indian tailors will bombard you with pleas to make a full suit, hmmmm not sure that's what the average shorts-wearing tropical tourist really wants, but still...

The place (being Singapore) is almost supernaturally clean and smell-free for a Chinatown, but there are some nice sidewalk cafes and hawker centres dotted around. Take a local friend, because Chinese hawker food is very different from what you may have had in a ""Chinese takeaway"" in a European or American setting.

To make the visit have a little bit more depth, try visiting the temples and absorbing the atmosphere (not all temples here are Chinese, there's actually an Indian temple here with great, intricate roof carvings.)"
,,Awesome street food!,5.0,,"We loved the awesome Chinese food here. The taste was authentic - we loved the chicken satay - it was at a very affordable rate. Close to the MRT, you can reach there without any hassles. The place is good to buy token gift items like fridge magnets and other knick-nacks at a very good rate. We had a good time!"
,,Different...,3.0,,"This was a very different shopping experience .. Cramped !! However , good for the best authentic Chinese tea , tea sets and accessories . Got some great bargains !!"
,,Another budget-friendly shoppers' haven,4.0,,"Other than Bugis, shopping could also be worthwhile in Chinatown because of its affordability as well as the richness in culture all over the place. You'll enjoy delectable buys of Chinese victuals the whole time, too! (visited March 2011)"
,,Good shopping,4.0,,"This is a place where you get a variety of things and reasonably priced. Clothes, shoes and a lot of knick-nacks. I like the colourful scarves which costs just a couple of dollars and can be given as little gifts to friends. Lots of food and pricing ok."
,,loved it,5.0,,"visited in June 2014 with friends and family we ranged in ages from 10 to 60 and Chinatown had something for everyone, massages, shopping, eateries and all so clean and helpful. cheap key rings and t shirts to knicknacks and other gifts there is lots to keep you busy for hours. In our week stay we visited on 3 occasions and never got sick of the experience. Do not haggle or barter like in HK or KL but they clearly display their prices. Found when having massages if you went as a group you got a better price. Would thoroughly recommend a visit during the day then pop back if you can at night you won't be disappointed!"
,,The cleanest Chinatown I've seen,4.0,,"When traveling, I always make sure I go to Chinatown to do my souvenir shopping. This place didn't disappoint me. They have souvenirs like 3 for 10 sgd. The souvenirs are nice and omg, it's the cleanest Chinatown i've been too."
,,Visit during the Chinese New Year,4.0,,"during the Chinese New Year time,this whole area becomes vivid with street light ups and crowds haggling to buy CNY decorations,talismans and other knick-knacks. There are also CNY sweets which you can sample for free before buying and the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a beauty. Maxwell food centre is ever famous for its street food."
,,lots of shopping,3.0,,"Mostly shopping of little souvenir trinkets here - lots of 3 for $10 deals. Had an ABC (apple, beet, carrot) smoothie, which was very refreshing in the midst of the humidity of Singapore in March (even at night). Bargained for some clothing as well. Overall, a very touristy feel, and very crowded."
,,as always be cautious,3.0,,As you know your parents and advisory have told anyone just be careful of new places.Seems renovated but there are tricks to get money from you.There is a scenic garden walkbridge too.Do you get a good service?...debatable.But Businesses will be located here.Also many prominent worldclass shops are here.Everyone has to start somewhere in life but do not get lured by funny promises.To the Advantage of the Chinatown Area a new Subroute Downtown has been created.Your eyes will be dazzled by the improvements and relative wealth.A good place for a short holiday But readers of this write up should contact me before you venture to this place.Basically nothing is cheap or free in this world...just lower your expectations or be an adjusting type and cautious of dealings.Recently took my Brazilian pal here who wanted to see a sanitised Chinatown.He too exclaimed about the mixed nature of things here.Some people will willingly show their thighs and assets to you.
,,"Not the real deal, but take it as it is",3.0,,"I think that this is a mixed bag - it is certainly not authentically ""Chinese"", but is rather a cleaned-up, touristy version of it. On the plus side, it does have some good food and a couple of attractions that justify its name.

Like some similar ""Chinatowns"" in Asia, you'll find merchandise that is really obviously catered to crowds of tourists. it's far from authentic but take it in the right spirit - this is the time to indulge in cheap, cheery and cheesy, whether it's giant ""Hello Kitty"" merchandise or little fake silk Chinese dresses to hold wine bottles. Indian tailors will bombard you with pleas to make a full suit, hmmmm not sure that's what the average shorts-wearing tropical tourist really wants, but still...

,,"Food, souveneirs and atmosphere",4.0,,"i have been here a few times and enjoy the atmosphere, food and some of the items for sale are actually good quality. Oh and say hi to the couple that do caligraphy in in small tent in the middle of the street love a chat."
,,"Busy, bustling, bright and brilliant",5.0,,"I took my son for his 18th birthday to Malaysia and Singapore. We caught the train to Chinatown in Singapore and when we got off at the station there was a shopping complex. I thought to myself this isn't much and I wanted to buy jade trinkets to hang off my purse. Each shop I went into didn't have them so I asked where do I get them from? An older man told me to cross the bridge and be very careful as Chinatown was the other side. Well my son and I went on our trek up a lot of steps across the long bridge and down the other side. What an experience it's fantastic I was gob smacked with the hustle and bustle. It was Chinese New Year when we were there and the stalls were giving out freebies the color, old buildings and chanting was fabulous. Both my son and I had a ball not only did I get my jade trinkets but any souvenir you could imagine. Crossing the bridge coming back the street was blocked off and we had a first class view of the dragon dancing down the street with loud drums, a total awesome experience. This would have to be one of my favorite places. Go and see!"
,,Interesting in places,3.0,,"There are a lot of interesting places in Chinatown and there is some lovely architecture, but taken as a whole, there is nothing exceptional about it compared to other places in this part of the world.

There are temples, shops and restaurants. There are nice buildings. Somehow, it lacks the hustle-bustle of other 'Chinatowns' and such neighbourhoods in neighbouring countries. Definitely nice and definitely worth visiting, don't expect too much though."
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"Chinatown never disappoints. We have visited on number of occasions for different reasons...to visit temples, to eat and to learnt about history of Singapore. Chinatown comes alive in the evening when the little lanterns illuminate and you find locals eating outside. Chinatown is easily accessible by MRT Chinatown, purple line."
,,Great combination,4.0,,"I love the mess and the colors of chinatown allover the world, but this is even better!
In the big market you can find everything: from souvenires to herbs, from antique to clothes.
Plus there are many food option and if you are tired to dig in the market you can loose yourself in the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple or in the bigger Hindu temple.
Absolutely worth a visit!

,,grab a bargain,5.0,,"Try this at night its colourful noisy and very busy, the atmosphere is amazing. Plenty of bargains to be had don't forget to haggle. Can recommend the tailors quick and the end product is excellent ."
,,Great shopping and food !,5.0,,Great shopping ! The only hassle you get is from the tailors trying to make you a suit but other than that the experience was very pleasant. Very good places to eat as well with fresh produce. Definitely a must see !
,,well worth a wander,4.0,,"Hawkers galore! A great way for your family to see a different side to singapore There are loads of touristy buys at both Little India and Chinatown, but nowhere else can you smell the distinct aroma of the durian......certainly a smell you never forget. Colourful temples and some yummy food as well. Well worth a look to see a different view of Singapore"
,,Red Lights all over,5.0,,I loved walking in Chinatown @ night as it was awsumly decorated during tht time as the Chinese NEW YEAR was going on. I likes it a lot. Its a very much clean market. & you may shop too as per your requirements.
,,Typical Chinatown but much cleaner,3.0,,"This was a typical chinatown like you would find anywhere in the world, but the only difference is that it is much cleaner, no cooking smells and no trash on the street. Its shops are average, and if not for those rare items from china, I wouldnt consider going."
,,Why does all cheap things are in chinatown?,4.0,,"To be honest i dont want to come here, i live in a chinese country and i thought i would find interesting here but guess what...
My partner is a chinese and he do a lot of reserach for the that we should go well obviously number 1 is chinatown...why?
The foreign exhange here is much higher and you can even bargain if your selling a lot of money...
After we stroll to chinatown we found the best offer than any other exchange rate shop.
During the night they also have like a food court here where everythjng is much cheaper compare to other places...delicious food and nice ambience, theres also a lot of things to buy here..we didnt coz its all chinese products we got it in macau and hk already hehehe. But should try to visit its worth it. And also there is this one shopping mall next to the mtr stn where you can buy tickets in almost all the attractions in singapore for a very reasonable/cheap price! Yes you heard me...our ticket for the universal studio and jewel cable car is bought frim these travel agencies and its much more cheaper to compare ur going to buy it from there, try to consider if your keen with the money you spend. Well thanks to chinatown we save a few hundreds"
,,Best place for souvenirs,4.0,,"If you are interested to take back home some good amount of souvenirs, then China Town is the place. s$10 will fetch you 3 gifts and the more you buy the lesser the price. It has some good food in the vicinity as well if you love Chinese food."
,,Interesting place for souvenirs,4.0,,It's a place in Singapore whereby you can find a lot of souvenirs and the abundance of lights make this place lively.
,,A good place to shop for souvenirs,4.0,,"Shopping is a sport in Singapore, and the city consists of a multitude of shopping malls. China town is excellent for getting asian souvenirs, and decently priced electronics (Lucky Plaza Mall).

The Chinese food court on top of the small mall in Chinatown (next to the Buddhist temple) is excellent."
,,Spoilt For Choice,4.0,,A very variedselection of shops and restauants.i ate at a different restaurant each night>Mind you I had to take acre as many of the dishes they served were very hot to my taste and I had a burnt mouth the rest of the night.Bing near to my hotel made it extra convenient.
,,Always good.,4.0,,"Lived in Singapore for 6 years and always enjoy going to Chinatown. Usually have steamboat when we go there and also BBQ stingray at one of the stalls. Smith street is a must, and if you like oysters try the oyster omelet. Best to get a good table , a few Tiger beers in a bucket of ice and watch the crowds go by."
,,Nice place for food and cheap buy,4.0,,"Don't be fooled by the photos posted in TripAdvisor. This place is only decorated like those photos during special events, i.e. Chinese New Year and Lantern Festival!

On a normal day, this place is just like any other old street. However, you get cheap and good food and cheap buys at the non aircon shopping complex near Sago Lane.

There are also many shops selling a variety of wares...all at bargain prices!

Be prepared to walk around in the heat."
,,"Another chinatown to visit, if you can....",4.0,,"Like we said in another review we love visiting chinatown around the world. we couldn't wait to see this one after reading all the reviews lol. It is quiet close to Boat quay. Easy way to get is by metro.Very busy place with all the bargins, and nice food. we love it. It is similar to Kuala Lumpur chinatown. There is also little mosque and a temple which we visited. Over all dont miss this place."
,,A bit of a tourist trap,3.0,,"The core of China town seems to be around two or three blocks. Lots of similar shops selling T shirts and stones that can have your name or symbol. Other shops had bright coloured clothes and prints.
It was early afternoon and only reasonably busy - somehow there was no buzz, no excitement. I was expecting something more spectacular. I did not eat but I assume that the restaurants there are good.
Possibly it is more fun in the evening.
Disappointingly I left without making a purchase and only indulging in a coffee and toast with the lovely coconut jam.had coffee in one place"
,,"The cleanest ""China Town"" I've ever been to",4.0,,"Singapore is known to be one of the cleanest country in Asia. I didn't expect the China Town to be as clean as it was when we were there. Atmosphere is different it is not as crowded as the typical China Town that I ever been to. We were surprise that vendors speak very well English and they don't haggle you for any thing. Prices are very reasonable you can get 5 in a pack good quality key chains for $2. They have a big food court that is outdoor with so much to choose from, tables have covers so you feel like you're eating in a restaurant not food court. It was a very nice China Town experience."
,,Beautiful Heritage & local food,5.0,,"Chinatown is a melting pot of cultures , with the Sri Mariamman Temple , Masjid Jama'e Mosque and the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple , shophouses make up most of Chinatown and have been well preserved.A great museum to learn about Chinatown's history would be the Chinese Heritage Centre.You might want to eat at the nearby Maxwell Food Centre or Chinatown Food Centre , both are near the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple.Hawker centres embodies the best local delicacies , not restaurants!In addition , they serve relatively affordable food."
,,China Town Singapore,4.0,,A place where you can find bits of Singapore history particularly those related to the Chinese immigrants. This is also a place to go for the local Chinese foods. Don’t forget to bring your camera and take home some nice shots including the street venders and their colourful displays.
,,Cleanest China Town ever,4.0,,"As you may expect, you get rather cheap chinese food, a bunch of small shops selling everThing from traditional chinese over electronics to copied western articles.
Chinatown is well connected to the merro system.

However - the place is rather small for a city of that size.
And: I have never ever seen a Chinatown so clean and well organized.

..you even get free Chinatown Wifi on the main locations."
,,Nice,4.0,,"I've been to many Chinatowns all over the world, and this was a bit unique. I enjoyed myself watching the people, vendors, and items for sale. I would definitely come back to visit it again."
,,Look up!,4.0,,"Street markets galore!
The vendors hassle you at every turn, but that just adds to the fun of the area. The stalls/shops are varied and many are quite cheap - but shop around...and haggle about a price. I think they enjoy the banter, too!
We dug around and found an eatery where we cooked our food at our table. No real idea on what half the ingredients were, nor whether we were cooking it right. We seemed to be the only English speakers there (unusual for Singapore) which made for some comical exchanges as we blundered our way through our undercooked/overcooked? dinner, which was nevertheless, fairly
edible!
We made quite a mess too, which no-one else seemed to. Cost? S$14 to feed four of us. Bargain!
We'll worth a look."
,,Food was lovely,4.0,,"We walked around all the food stalls in chinatown and setlled on a stall with chicken noodle curry, mixed satay and a banana and chocolate paratha. All were lovely and it is definitely worth a visit if you are looking for cheap, tasty food."
,,Good food,4.0,,"Take a visit at night. The small streets filled with people and small stands with all Chinese crafts, but they are likely from China ... Tried the famous frog congee and Dim Sum, so tasty."
,,Happy Chinese New Year,4.0,,It's always a good idea to go to Chinatown for a festive chinese new year feel. It is a must to go if you are keen to get some pretty decorative items to decorate your house for the chinese new year. Value for money snacks and goodies are also available to stock up on for the visitors. I strongly reccomend a must-go and to wear comfortable shoes!
,,Still has that old world charm about it,4.0,,"I was here for a photo tour and had a lot of fun. There are numerous shops here selling trinkets and various souvenirs. It's a street photographer's paradise and one feels safe taking out a camera and walking about composing and framing to get that elusive ""winner."" The place tends to be crowded but not overly so."
,,Nice !!,4.0,,A nice place for lots of shopping n street food. There are lots of nooks n alleys to explore. Lots of souveneir shopping at reasonable prices ( after lots of bargaining) although i found little India cheaper for shopping.
,,Colors feast for the eyes.,4.0,,"Nice ""Chinatown"" to explore for nice souvenirs, and savor some local cuisines from the foodcourt. Better to try the Chinatown Foodcenter for more localised cuisines."
,,Excellent not-to-be-missed location if you are looking for very affordable & nice souvenirs and to savour local food,5.0,,Singapore Chinatown is a very nice location which offers lots of souvenir choices and local food for you to sample.
,,Colourful,4.0,,Chinatown is eclectic and fun Shop keepers are friendly. There are lots of historical places to see. Pagoda st has markets. There is outdoor street dining on Friday nights
,,No visit to Singapore is complete without a trip to Chinatown,4.0,,"If you are looking for some gifts or maybe a good massage, tailored clothing, good food or just a bit of people watching then Chinatown in Singapore is the place to come. Access is easy due to the excellent public transport system, you can choose from the MRT, busses or taxis.
There is always a great vibe, especially during Chinese festivals and now there is an excellent free public wi-fi system covering the whole of Chinatown.
Lots of things to see and do, if you want to avoid the crowds visit during a week day, if you want to see it at its busiest pop down for some great street food after 7pm."
,,Great place to shop and eat,5.0,,"Chinatown has everything. Good hotels, local to amenities, great restaurants, tourist shops and wonderful stalls to buy freshly cooked food. We love to come here and browse and use Chinatown as an excuse when we need to visit one of the Banks. All local Banks are situated here. It is also one of the best places in singapore to exchange money. Tout for the best deal.
Search out the hot pork/corriander and cucumber fills in a white bread base..."
,,Heritage place in Singapore,3.0,,"There are quite a number of shops here selling cheap souvenirs and clothes. A great variety of food selections can be found within Chinatown - if you want to experience the local cuisine, try the food stalls at the hawker centre."
,,An enjoyable experience,4.0,,"We made two short visits to Chinatown during our stay in Singapore. On both occasions, we dined at a small street cafe as they appeared to be very popular with the locals and less expensive than most of the restaurants in the tourist spots. We also did a little souvenir shopping from the colourful stalls, but to be honest most of the same goods can be obtained at any other international market across the globe. It was still an enjoyable experience!"
,,great place to shop,4.0,,"You actually feel like you are in China, This place has good shopping pretty cheap. They have every kind of suuvenir you can think of. The food seems authenic and the beer was cold. It was an enjoyable afternoon."
,,Shop Shop Shop!,5.0,,"Great time to shop for cheap souvenirs with never ending shops around. There are lots of food courts, temple, cheap souvenirs. never ending walking also!"
,,Crowded market.,4.0,,Great for souvenir shopping! Just don't start buying at the first shop you see and make sure you walk around. I thought 3 postcards for the price of S$5 was cheap but ended up getting 6 of them for only S$2!
,,Didn't fancy me!!,2.0,,"It’s a place where you can get to see Chinese stuff. Like a mini China market . It’s a place for great deal but the quality is absolute no guarantee.
If you have enough time to spend you may just visit to see how it is and what it is all about!"
,,Walk around china town,4.0,,A perfect place for a evening walk as well as for having a view like china street... you will find yourself walking in china
,,great for shopping,5.0,,"Chinatown is a great spot to do some souvenir shopping! Head up the market street for a large number of souvenir shops that are quite cheap. You can get everything here from clothing (including silk kimonos), toys, electronics, and typical souvenirs like magnets & t-shirts.
The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is also worth checking out - it's very impressive!"
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"When you are in a China or ethnically a Chinese dominated country, what does then Chinatown mean. Well in the case of Singapore Chinatown, it means, where the Chinese of Singapore first sowed their seeds and established their roots. It is where the history, architecture and culture of early generation Chinese can be found. It is also the place, where Singaporeans act more Chinese than Singaporeans (I believe me, there is a difference). When Singaporeans want to visit there past they head to Chinatown. This where some fantastic restaurants have recently been established and this is where the old and now restored buildings provides a glimpse of what Singapore was like in its early days. The heart of Chinatown has now been taken over by new money, paying multimillion dollars for small pieces of old properties and bringing them back to their original glory and establishing a fancy restaurant, bar or a boutique. The nightlife in this area is thriving and the place gets busy with diners and bar hoppers as the evening approaches. This is after the day tourists have had their fill at one of the local street-side restaurants. There are many old shops in this area that carry on with the same business started 2-3 generations ago, especially worth the visit are those dealing with Chinese medicine. To be honest, I Chinatown and Arab street are two of my favorite areas in Singapore that provides both a modern and historical feel. Something culturally genuine and authentic."
,,Plenty of Shopping,5.0,,"Need gifts for your friends back home, then go here. You can buy anything, from magnets to clothing. Went here and bought alot of stuff, poor husband. We bought some cute shot glasses, mugs, tee shirts, keychains, & postcards. Got everything I need to show off my great stay in Singapore. There are also many restaurants, not as cheap as the hawkers, but the stuff coming out at these places looked good."
,,Crowded street market,3.0,,I went at the time of chinese new year. It was full of colors and street food at cheap price everywhere. I personally didnt like this place much as the food was not my taste and there was no place to sit and relax .Just keep walking and walking along with the crowd.
,,China,4.0,,You really imagine you are walking in a Chinese town. Lots of small shops and places to eat. Loved it!
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,Great marketplace with a lot of nice food and always a gift to find for your family or friends. You can also visit the museum about China culture.
,,Good Food n Cheap price,3.0,,"This place is good especially for Indonesian, food taste almost the same with Indonesian ""tongue"", price also not so expensive. Many cheap price around here, but you must know to bargain, even the electronics and mobile phone so cheap in here but I not recommend you to buy in here, better buy electronics at electronic supermarket like best denkie, even a bit expensive but safer, guarantee and everything clear."
,,Very clean version of Chinatown,4.0,,"One of the things that remain impressive to me having visited Singapore many times is the preservation of heritage buildings by retaining the exterior architecture. Many of these heritage buildings have the recognizable style of windows and today there could be restaurants, bars, and boutiques that occupy these buildings. In Singapore's Chinatown, the building preservation is no different. Each storefront has their windows painted uniquely so that each store carries its own character and personality. The main commercial strips of Chinatown are along Pagoda Street and Temple Street.

The area beyond the main commercial strips have evolved into a night spot destination among the young professionals. Who ever says that Chinatown is not a place to hang out in the evening? Along Erskine Road and Ann Siang Road are boutiques. Club Street has intimate eateries offering European cuisine and these establishments that take on the colorful facade of what one would expect of Chinatown.

Perhaps my most favorite part of all is how true diversity is reflected in Chinatown. In the multicultural fashion of this city state, there are three different places of worship located on the same street in Chinatown. The Sri Mariamman Hindu Temple, Jamae Mosque, and a Chinese temple are located just a block from each other along South Bridge Road."
,,Great morning spent mooching about!,4.0,,"loved Chinatown, a great way to spend some time. the usual stuff and more! Stop off at MAxwell""s Hawker centre for lunch! We ate Dumplings, noodles and a variety of other delicious food for a variety of the Hawkers a great experience!"
,,proportional for singapore,3.0,,"in the context of singapore an interesting location - away from the glitz, singapores chinatown offers a compact yet fulfilling experience. larger enough to be considered a market style but not bigger enough to warrant more than a few hours which makes it perfect to be able to fit into ones schedule. what it does suffer from is repeativeness....there is a lot of the same stalls and the same in a lot of ways but it does have its own atmosphere and character.
another bonus of this area is that it runs parallel with the food precinct and the subway station brings you out right at the entrance."
,,Great place to buy souvenirs,4.0,,We went there for lunch and to have a look around. Easy to get there on MRT. If you want souvenirs to take home then this is the place. Many eateries to eat at but beware if u go inside a restraunt you will pay for aircon and nuts if on the table and hand towel. All this will b added to you bill plus 10% tax. Best to eat out on the street. Can get suite or dress made here as many Indian Taylor's and they will deliver to your hotel. Also good buys on camera gear and jewellery gold diamonds and silver. Don't forget to bargain.
,,Souvenir place,3.0,,"When you're on a trip to Singapore, this is a good place to shop for souvenirs to bring back home. The prices are much cheaper compared to other places. It is conveniently located at MRT Chinatown station. This place can get really busy. There are also a lot of food places where a lot of tourist drink at night, even in the daylight."
,,Great place,5.0,,"Many things to see and do. Shopping at local centres, food tripping att Maxwell Center, Smith Street, People's Park for local food, souvenire shopping at Pagoda and Temple St, Sri Mariaman Temple, Funan Digital Mall near the area so as Asian Civilization Museum. Planned a day around the area, fun to be at."
,,Busy Place,4.0,,"At any time of day Chinatown is busy. We decided to do a walking tour ourselves with a map and spent four hours going around various sites before looking at the stalls in Food Street. The vendors in Food Street are more active than elsewhere in Singapore - they actually engage you in conversation. For reasons best known to the tailors they kept choosing to sing at my husband, which made the kids laugh."
,,"Temples, Mosques and Shrines",4.0,,"Chinatown is centred mainly along South Bridge Road, where you will find the colourful Sri Mariamman Hindu Temple. Along Temple St and Pagoda St you can get a suit made up in 24hrs from one of the many vendors. If you are suffering from mosquito bites I highly recommend any of the herbal medicine shops. One man fixed me up with the most fantastic dragon balm which works a treat. Slightly further afield, walk down Amoy St and Telok Ayer St, the historic heart of Chinatown. Thian Hock Keng Temple is a good starting point to discover more about the Chinese community. You will find information boards dotted around the streets here each with some quirky story attached."
,,great for shopping!,4.0,,"I loved the atmosphere here. It's full of people, old Chinese style building, food and souvenir. I always have fun walking around here and taking photos. Last time I came here was for Grilled Pork of Lim Chee Guan which I had to queue up every time but it always worth trying!

Chinatown was the ideal location which was very convenient to go anywhere, so there're lots of hostel and hotel in this area which are not expensive at all compared to living cost in Singapore.

Everyone should come here when they come to Singapore. Lots of fun!"
,,"Great for shopping , eating and sightseeing",4.0,,"We went there first for the sightseeing as it is quite different from the other areas of Singapore .
There is an interesting Hindu temple at the main entrance right beside a big Mosque and the main attraction is the Buddhist temple at the other end ! The streets are filled with little stores where we found that prices are lower than elsewhere ; it is the perfect place to buy souvenirs !
Finally , it is a good place to try the local food at a good price . One has the choice of Food Street where there are dozens of stalls and small restaurants or Food court in front of the Buddhist Temple !
There is sometimes a show in the middle of the afternoon on the main square between the Buddhist Temple and the Food Court . A band was playing some R&R music while we were there !"
,,History in Singapore,4.0,,"Try a visit to Chinatown,you will see history,and current living around the area. Close to the city centre and you can catch the MRT or try a city tour."
,,Great Place to Buy Soveniers,4.0,,"walked down to some streets and lors in China Town Singapore you'll find a lot of merchandise shops. Great place to buy tote bags, key chains, t-shirts, etc at a great price."
,,"Great food, great deals",5.0,,"Amazing place, and amazing food. Been to the one in London as well, but this seemed more natural. Though not as huge, this place is cleaner and well maintained. Retains some heritage unlike the ones elsewhere. Easily accessible from anywhere in the city. Should have more dining options like in the UK and better deals. Food is cheap yet exceptional. Dined there for two days in a row and for what I know, it has the best food in all of Singapore. Souvenirs are dead cheap... and we picked up a whole lot of them. Stop by the store that sells fresh cut fruit and the Nanyang cafe for a morning coffee. Had a wonderful experience and this place is what I miss the most."
,,shop til you drop,4.0,,So many stalls to choose from and lots of variety. We did find a place that you can buy a hollow glass ball that has been hand painted from the inside and you can get your name written on it too. And reasonably priced. Lots of food outlets to choose from also
,,Absolutely loved it,4.0,,"We got a taxi which dropped us off near the markets and we were so excited when we started looking around. It is such a great place to wander around looking at the unusual items. I bought a few silk scarves and also the usual tourist souvenirs which were very good value. I also bought a parasol as it was extremely hot and humid. We loved Chinatown, the experience, the products available and the value for money. One thing we didn't like was a trader who tried to sell my son a suit which he said he would make for the following day for $180 Singapore dollars, then he changed it to 180 GBP at the last minute. Not a good way to do business. I would definitely recommend a visit but possibly avoid the middle of the day because of the extreme heat. A lady in the shop where I bought the scarves gave me a seat and put the air con on for me, I must have looked as if I was about to collapse !"
,,Same Same but different,4.0,,"If you're looking for souvenirs, a visit to Chinatown is a must. Same souvenirs as can be purchased elsewhere but at much cheaper prices (magnets selling for S$5 elsewhere, 3 or more for S$10. Tshirts selling for S$33 elsewhere, S$15. Interesting and bustling place. A visit to the temples in a must. Enjoyable few hours out."
,,Great place to explore,5.0,,"Chinatown is an impressive area of Singapore. Plenty of hustle and bustle with every knick knack, food and giftware shop you can imagine.

Hubby and I spent a good few hours wandering around.

Maxwell Hawker centre is worth a look, but on such a hot day, we passed on the hot cooked food available.

Easily accessible by MRT and an easy way to spend a few hours."
,,A Chinatown That Compares Favorably To Its Namesakes,4.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is easily accessible via the MRT. This concentrated dose of Chinese culture is a big draw for tourists. And, of course, a multitude of shops and restaurants cater to the influx of people. Considering the abundance of Chinese influence in most of Singapore, the Chinatown area works surprisingly well, and it compares favorably to other ""Chinatowns"" that I have visited - which is the basis of my rating. Most of the stuff sold, especially in the touristy stores, seems pretty flimsy, but they still make for decent souvenirs and at slightly reduced prices when compared to more formal gift shops elsewhere in Singapore.

On this visit we did not stay long enough to see all of Chinatown or even stop for lunch, so I cannot comment or recommend any eateries. I really want to visit/see the Maxwell Hawker Centre but ran out of time. The Indian Temple near the MRT station was having a wedding, so there was a sense of celebration in the air (and fancy Lamborghini parked on the street awaiting for the wedding couple - and it seemed completely out of place)."
,,A real Chinatown NOT a fake brand ripoff,4.0,,"The Chinatown of Singapore depicts the real life of Chinese settlers throughout history. There are many authentic Chinese shops, buildings and the street market mostly consists of goods relating to Chinese culture. A vibrant place to visit. The Chinese Heritage Center is recommended."
,,Just explore Chinatown,4.0,,"Many shops, temples, restaurants to wander into and explore. Chinatown is not just for visitors many locals come here to shop."
,,maxwell road hawker market,4.0,,"the shops, the food, the temple and maxwell road hawker market with its characters and personalities was fun. Make sure you have shoulders covered for entry to the temple."
,,Great Shopping,4.0,,Got to buy old coins and old teapots for a little price. It was clean and the salesperson was not pushy but very helpful.
,,Small China in Singapore,4.0,,"In China town in Sing , i could find many things of china such as food , culture , clothes etc and almost they were so cheap. However , China town is not really clean like other road in Sing."
,,Little China in Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore is united country , that mixing from European people , Asian (Indian , Chinese , Malaysian ....) Each area they have each different community . And here is just little China in Little Island , Singapura"
,,becareful,3.0,,"nice place to have a kind of street food but becareful you might lost your bag anytime, it's not safe here"
,,Festive,4.0,,"I want aware that the majority of Singapore is made up of Chinese. So of course China town is a hive of activity. Nothing is cheap. But nothing is really that cheap in Singapore. However loved the color and diversity of this area.
Good place to peruse."
,,Just loved the buzz,5.0,,"We arrived in Singapre on a Saturday afternoon so with nothing else planned we made our way to China Town, what a good choice. it is a really lively place with the market stalls, restaurants and hawker stalls all vying for your custom but never in an aggressive way. At 6.30pm on a saturday evening there is a dragon dance show at the temple end of temple street, its for the tourists but still good,colourful and loud. Very different to China Town in KL and I thought better although if its fakes that you want then they are well hidden too the point where we couldn't find any."
,,Little China,4.0,,"It seem like a small Beijing , so many cheap thing tourist can buy here . Also tourist can get a lot of special food with very cheap price. We went here in the morning and finished with the Tomyam steamboat in the night time. China town where the Singapore begin."
,,Authentic food,5.0,,"Shopping is cheap and colourful, but the best thing there is food street, which comprises of small food stalls and shops, each specialising in various chinese dishes. Great food and cheap."
,,Cheap souvenir items,5.0,,"Don't buy right away upon stepping inside China Town. Roam around and you will see what outlet you can get the most out of your money. A must item are key chains, calendars and Tshirts. If you are tired and still want to shop, take a walk at nearby McDonald and have a burger and fries. Buy thisrts from this place for giveaways but if you wish to have a good quality shirts buy it from branded stores like GAP."
,,Busy with tourists,4.0,,"China town is a very important part of Singapore and cant be missed. You could grab some local Chinese food here (great dim sum!), do little souvenir shopping or just walk along the streets and make some memorable shots."
,,One for the tourist - and locals,3.0,,"Busy with tourists and quite expensive. You need to wander off track a little to find something more authentically Chinese but be prepared for the lack of spoken English and the directness that the locals have. Fortunately my partner speaks Mandarin so we weren't sent away as some poor tourist were. We had some really good cheap food.
We had just come from Penang and found the locals less friendly and prices that bit higher.
Worth a visit though"
,,Memorable event,5.0,,"4 days in Singapore in March 2014 - Our guided walking tour of Chinatown was one of the highlights of our first visit to Singapore. Our tour was ""free"" commencing at the Heritage Centre, we ""tipped"" the guide what we thought it was worth. How can you put a value on 3 hours of informative and entertaining dialogue provided by our very knowledgeable and friendly guide.
We were provided much more history and insight than is possible walking on your own.
Our guide specialised in historic tours and we were lucky enough to tour Little India with him on the next day."
,,walking tour,3.0,,We did a few brief walking tours in and around Chinatown-- standouts were the Hawker stalls across the street from the City Galleries and the long rows of buildings with updated facades. I recommend bringing a written guidebook which will give you the story about many of the buildings and the area before the City updated facades and redeveloped portions. Definitely makes the visit to this part of town more interesting. Some guidebooks also suggest specific routes which might be helpful.
,,Excellent Place - A must Visit in Singapore,5.0,,"plenty of shops with varieties of goods to buy, from branded to local, very reasonably priced
the best attraction was The Tintin Shop, its there in only 4 countries in the world, u will get everything related to Tintin here
they do have roadside food carts, very tasty n varieties
dont forget to carry water as its taxing all the time
Very Good Place to visit in Singapore"
,,Typical Chinatown,4.0,,Easy to get to on the MRT. Lots of places to eat and shop. Enjoy the atmosphere and pick up souvenirs (don't forget to haggle).
,,Great Place for Foods and Souvenirs Shopping,4.0,,"Chinatown definitely worth a visit! Here you get to experience lively buzzing atmosphere surrounded by traditional Shop houses coated in varieties of colors, arrays of restaurants offering delicious delicacies, and plenty of shop selling souvenirs with a very reasonable price! It is one of the cheapest places to buy souvenirs in Singapore in my opinion. I must also add that Singapore's Chinatown is in fact one of the cleanest I have ever been. I can go on forever raving about Chinatown, but let's keep it simple; it's awesomely rich with culture, cheap bargain for foods and souvenirs, it's clean and one of the best Chinatown I have ever been! A must Visit when you're in Singapore."
,,An interesting place to wonder but not to stay.,3.0,,Chinatown in my opinion is more geared towards rounding up your last souvenirs and exploring singapore. It seems more of an everyday living place for those of chinese heritage. Great authentic Chinese restaurants.
,,<3,5.0,,I love chinatown in Singapore. It's easy to get to and a great place for cheap souvenirs to bring back for friends and family.
,,"Chinatown, more than just Pagoda Street",4.0,,"If you have the time spread your wings around the general area as there are lots of markets just outside the Pagoda street area. We found these have a better range (of more useful clothes and goods), and the prices can be a little better as well, some really nice food is available from the market food courts also. As can happen the afternoon rain may really come down :), thats a good time to have a cool drink and enjoy the show."
,,Went here without expecting too much...,4.0,,"When we decided to go to Chinatown, we didn't have a specific plans. However, we did spend most of the day here, shopping for souvenirs and checking out the various stalls and museums. There were a lot of tourists, but it was an enjoyable trip."
,,Hidden treasures,5.0,,"Going to Chinatown doesn't really allow you to immerse yourself into the Chinese culture - most of us Singaporeans are too influenced by the Western. It is instead, the agriculture which sparks interests in individuals who head there.

Walk along Ann Siang Hill, and you would see something you would want to capture with your camera. Continue walking down the lane and you might land yourself in Duxton which has lots of cafes and even a bookstore (Littered with Books).

If you're going there for the Chinese food, then head over to Yum Cha (right above Santa Grand hotel). The Chinese food there is perfect and the price is reasonable. You can also go to Maxwell Food Centre and try out the famous stalls there, paying only a cheap price for the many variety of dishes.

Have fun!"
,,Much like any other,3.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is a bit of an oxymoron given the vast majority of the population are Chinese anyway... But that aside this is a good place to wander aimlessly, gawking at cheap tourist tat and to secure all those tacky souvenirs and gifts you simply have to take home with you (otherwise you weren't really there!).

Beyond that there isn't a lot of reason to come down here anymore than there is to pop into Bugis Street. The good thing here is that the place does have a (mild) flavour and the stall holders won't nag you relentlessly like on some such places. Recommended for the purchase of knick-knacks and cheap souvenirs."
,,bargains,4.0,,Has some great bargains and amazing food in hawkers centre's. Allow a few hours to see much of the area as its huge.
,,Good,4.0,,A crowd of shops of all kind Touristic but not anoying Better than little india Here you can buy the stuff you have to bring home for your friends/family
,,Very nice place to Eat and Shop,4.0,,"It is the best place to eat and shop for souvenirs when you are in Singapore. The place has loads of eating options and many shops to buy souvenirs. If you are a Tin Tin fan, you are in for a surprise as there is a Tin Tin store here. The notorious Singaporean fruit calld Durian is also on sale here."
,,Exellent!,5.0,,"I love the architecture, atmosphere, and so on so on...... Very good time walk in chinatown. I bought delicious baikute spice here!"
,,Lots of market stalls,5.0,,"This is a great place to pick up a bargain, check out the lovely status in the temple at the front of market lots of snack places and foot massage you will need it after all the shopping"
,,Good,4.0,,"A very nice place to buy souvenirs and if you're a Tin Tin fan, there's a fan shop right in the middle of it. It is probably the only Tin Tin shop that i know across south east asia."
,,Good For Shopping,4.0,,"we visited Singapore just after chinease New Year. China town start from China Town MRT. There are lots of bargains to be found, great for small souvenir. lot of Chinease restaurants. we bought some key rings, clips purses and also discounted tickets for popular attractions. A must visit to have an idea of singapore life."
,,Cracking!,5.0,,"In case you're wondering 'cracking' means 'brilliant' and thats just what it was. The shopping is most excellent in that you can have a good haggle and get what you want for a good price, bearing in mind you can go to Bugis and get the same stuff for cheaper but without the haggling or the atmosphere. The eateries are fab if, like Dad and I, you like to eat like the locals and not spend astronomical amounts of money. We visited the food hall opposite the Buddah Temple (on the outskirts of the shopping area) and loved it, there was a huge variety of vendors and we ended up sitting and chatting with some locals who were really friendly.

P.S - Have to put couple because there's two of us and there's no option for family travel without kids!"
,,a good place to buy souvenirs,4.0,,"the lim chee guan sweet meat is yummy as compared with other shops. I also buy a pain relief plaster (5 pieces in a packet), Anshy Gau Plaster is only sgp$2.5 per packet and it is work ! I will certainly buy it again if I come to Singapore again."
,,Good,3.0,,I visited on 16th January when the chinese new year was just around. So I believe it was specially crowded and joyous. You can buy chinese stuff and lots of food from roadside stalls and small shops.
,,Great way to see the Chinese culture of Singapore,4.0,,Easy to access and lots to see. The shopping is great and affordable compared to the rest of Singapore. This is the place to buy Singaporean souvenir for cheap. Lots of small restaurants and small food vendors. A must see! Great atmosphere.
,,China for Tourists,4.0,,"Very easy to access by the MRT (underground) this area has been gentrified quite nicely. The area around the station is designed for tourists but if you go a little further out, there are streets which are used by the locals and give you a bit more of an idea of Singaporean life. You can always retreat to Nanyang Old Coffee for a reviver if it all gets too much."
,,Brilliant atmosphere,4.0,,"During our 10 day trip to Singapore we visited Chinatown on three occasions. The first time was about 10am purely because we had to kill time before we could check into our accommodation. Many of the shops and stores weren't open but the place had a promise of a buzzing atmosphere. Had a beer and a lunch at an asian cafe in the centre of Chinatown and fell instantly in love with Tiger Beer and the sates. The second visit was during a mid afternoon on our way back to our accommodation. Every shop and stall was open and we were able to see what was on offer. Lots of the usual tourist tatt as expected of course, but there were some great shops selling everything from cameras to hand made suits. We found a shop that had some very different and good quality tableware and purchased a few items. Had a Tiger Beer at the same cafe (opposite the Cultural Centre... can't remember the name of the cafe but it was brilliant). On our last evening in Singapore we decided that we had to go back yet again to Chinatown and have dinner at that same cafe... bought some more tableware and a few silk kimonos and kaftans, and upgraded our camera as well. We had been looking at doing so and had decided on which camera to buy prior to leaving Australia, but had not got around to doing anything about it. But we scored majorly as the camera we had decided on was so much cheaper than Oz. It was a very wet evening and although we had our ""3 for $10"" umbrellas, we were mostly sheltered from the rain by the awnings all through Chinatown. Overall it is an amazing place....yes there is a lot of tourist tatt and there are some very pushy salesmen and women.... but hey this is what you expect isn't it? The atmosphere is fantastic and when we go back to Singapore, we will go again, even if it is only to have a meal at that amazing cafe!"
,,Amazing food,4.0,,"China town is amazing, there are lots of bargains to be found, great for getting all those gifts for family back home, all in 1 location. Seafood Restaurant (that's it's name) on main corner of ChinaTown, was fantastic and we all would meet back to relax, have a Tiger beer and food is awesome."
,,My Favorite Place in Singapore,5.0,,"I love the Chinatown in Singapore. It is a great place to walk around and explore. They is so much to see and it is a great place to stay while in Singapore. I stayed at the New Majestic Hotel in Chinatown and was comfortable walking around here day and night. It was at the end of the New Year celebration while I was there and the streets were decorated with magical horse that pranced down the two main roads. The Dragon was dancing and envelopes were hidden for him to find. It's a good place to pick up a bargain, have your name written in Chinese, or have a wonderful meal. Your choices here from sit down restaurants with white table cloths, lots of casual places, McDonalds for your junk food fix or a cold soda, or live frog porridge if you are far more daring than me. Grab a Tiger beer sit down and watch the excitement in this area. Great temples and museums to explore."
,,"Nice, but not unique.",3.0,,"This is a nice part of Singapore, where you can find some cheap shopping and Chinese eateries. Having said that, there is absolutely nothing unique about this part of town, and it looks exactly the same as other Chinese quarters in other cities."
,,Worth a look,4.0,,If you are looking for an affordable place to shop take the MRT to Chinatown. Take the time to go through the shops and you can pick up some great bargains and gifts for friends and family back home.
,,I always come back,5.0,,"I've been to Singapore many times. I always come back to Chinatown. Why? Some really affordable and good quality hotels and hostels, delicious food right outside of the door (chicken rice, mie, popiah, etc.), great and friendly atmosphere, tons of little shops to explore, and the colorful houses and architecture in this part of town. Not to mention it's walking distance to the MRT. It's one of my favorite places in Singapore. There are some really comfortable coffeeshops where you can sit outside and just do some people watching. And recently the foodstreet is completed which only added to the atmosphere. I highly recommend people planning to stay in Singapore to check out this area."

,,Good place for cheap shopping,4.0,,"in the middle of the city and spread across a couple of blocks, this is a souvenir shopper's paradise. From watches to Singapore souvenirs, from t-shirts to shoes - you can get all of it here. Also, very well connected by the metro."
,,Hustle and Bustle!,4.0,,"We travelled to Singapore a week before the Chinese New Year - so needless to say, Chinatown was packed. There were many roads which were closed just for markets, which seemed to run continuously. After a while, I found myself getting annoyed at all the people yelling at me to come in to their stores, but I guess it's just a culture difference. If you are after some souvenirs, Chinatown is great. We picked up some Perfume for cheap, and in one of the malls a white gold Topaz ring. All real and legit. Surprisingly, didn't spot too many knock off's - which is something I was expecting.

We actually went back a second time."
,,Nice place to do some shopping and visiting historical place,4.0,,"China town is bustling place in singapore. More known for it's food, flea market, it's worth the visit. You can spend your shopping amount here. There are lot of shops where you can do your shopping.

Buddha temple is worth the visit and a nice place to experience the buddhist culture in singapore.

Non veg food lover's , this is the place to be to have your stomach worship."
,,Good fun place to visit,4.0,,This reminds me of some of the markets in old HK. The place was clean and there were plenty of shops. Amazingly most of the shops have the prices clearly marked but don't expect to bargain. There are plenty of places to have something to eat and drink. If you want to buy cheap souvenirs in Singapore you will find this place is miles cheaper than anywhere else. It is very easy to get to by the underground which comes up right in the middle of Chinatown.
,,The Place to Shop for Souvenirs at Bargain Prices!,5.0,,"This is the place to go for bargain gifts and local souvenirs. Things are sooooooo cheap. Lovely scarves, phone cases, bags, decorations......... You name it they've probably got it. There are also many places to eat.
Tip: Go in the late afternoon to evening when it is cooler. It is great to see this place at night!
You can get the MRT right to Chinatown & go out at Pagoda Street if you want the souvenir shops."
,,Chinatown Complex : Wet Market,5.0,,"If you want to see a different side to Chinatown away from all the tourists go to the wet market in the Chinatown Complex. It's on three floors the basement sells fish, flowers, meat and fruit and veg. The fish comes in all shapes and sizes and customers are also buying live snakes and frogs to take home and cook! The middle floor sells clothes, shoes and is very much a cheap retail outlet. The roof is the Hawker food centre and it rocks. We were the only tourists in the place and it was a fantastic insight into the ""real"" Chinese community of Singapore. Fabulous."
,,Not Impressed,3.0,,"Chinatown has lost some of its sparkle and authenticity since our last visit 5 years ago. The traditional market shops in temple street have been replaced by stalls you would see in any flea market. Maybe this was due to the lead up to Chinese new year. Pagoda Street markets were good to browse.
Take a look"
,,Interesting,4.0,,"This is a good place to go if you want to see strange foods you've never seen and probably wouldn't dare eat. All kinds of paraphernalia in the Markets, they even have a 'Tin Tin' shop. Verrrrrrrry cheap food and drinks!! Cheapest in Sg."
,,Step into tradition and have some fun!,4.0,,"We visited during Chinese New Year so the place had an extra buzz to it, but I have visited at other times of the year and its always a fun place to be.

Lots of restaurants, traditional desserts and bakeries, dim sum, tea shops, boutique hotels, backpacker inns, temples, tailors, souvenirs ( some tacky, some not ) reflexology , a historical exhibit of the area etc.

All in all a good half day's entertainment - -- I would always drop in to this area when I am in Singapore for some Chinese food and desserts, if nothing else. BTW it's also clean and well organized , like everything else in Singapore."
,,Nice Chinatown,4.0,,"Many cities have a Chinatown. Singapore' sis one of the cleanest we have seen. Nothing unusual, just fun to see and interesting people everywhere."
,,"Best place to shop for cheap souvenirs and stuff, but very crowded",4.0,,Best place to shop for cheap souvenirs but be sure to bargain. Lots of food for free tasting. Lots of restaurants and money changer. Very crowded at night but that's part of the fun.
,,Big on Atmosphere,4.0,,"I visited China Town in Singapore over thirty years ago and came to the same conclusion as I do now; what the area lacks in cultural and historical interest, it makes up for in atmosphere.

The area has certainly changed. It’s larger and far more modern, with its excellent underground railway station and overhead cover for many of the shops and stalls. The attractions of the temple and the pagoda adorned in Chinese lanterns are as before - rather ‘touristy’ and ‘plastic’. The colonial buildings are now painted in brighter contrasting colours and look more attractive.

Having said this, we still loved our visit. We enjoyed seeing all the exotic wares and foods for sale and taking in the busy ambience of the streets. As it was Chinese New Year, we were lucky enough to see a Chinese orchestra and dancing dragon. The ‘dragon’ was very amusing in its antics and wobbly eyes. Because of the heat the performers had to change every few minutes.

We took the time to have a drink in one of the many bars. It was great to watch the world go by and study the many nationalities, in their mixture of clothing styles, enjoying the market and the hustle and bustle of the place. It was also great to eat in one of the numerous restaurants and enjoy the many delights of oriental food.

We think it is an experience not to be missed whilst visiting Singapore."
,,Nice Place,5.0,,"Very nice place,colorful and i buyed lots of souvenirs for friends.The people there are extremely friendly and helpful. ... If you're looking for a place where you can buy interesting souvenirs or in the mood This place is very historical, a lot of fun, and there is plenty to tantalize all 5 of your senses."
,,A must in Singapore,4.0,,"My timing was good as it was during Chinese New Year, so the streets were well decorated. It's a nice walk around, and a good place to purchase souvenir from the street market. Price was good and reasonable if you want to bring Singapore's souvenir. Make sure you go through the Temple."
,,What's the big deal?,3.0,,"I'm really not quite sure what the fuss is about with Chinatown in Singapore. Sure, there are lots of great Chinese food options, and there are markets for those that are that way inclined. But, there are lots of good Chinese/Asian food options all over Singapore ... the Chinese are hardly under-represented!?! :-) Also, I felt the CNY decorations around Marina Bay were better, although granted I saw those in the evening when it was lit up whereas I went to Chinatown during the day. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad and probably worth a visit, but hardly worth going out of your way to see, and nor is it that much different from all the other Chinatowns around the world."
,,Nice Chinatown!,3.0,,Of course this is more of a souvenirs junk place. I find it exciting for about an hour then I am done. There is the same stuff being sold at most of the shops. There is a little variety of restaurants but it seems either real cheap or real expensive. So plan to go but also look at only a couple of hours to fill your time!
,,Clean and Exciting,4.0,,Lots of shopping for my family and great local food !! Easy access to train/MRT and taxi...we'll be back
,,Lively Chinatown,4.0,,"we loved Chinatown very easy to get to by MRT it takes you right there. We went at night time and daytime. As it was Chinese New Year it was looking very pretty. This is a great place to eat, buy souvenirs and grab a bargain. The temples are not far is you want to have a look. Look our for the ice cream man who sells ice cram sandwiches for a $1.20 they come in many flavours. I had raspberry ripple very yummy for those hot days while looking around."
,,Chinatown at CNY!,4.0,,Visited during the day and night - the decorations were Chinese New Year were amazing (especially at night). Definitely worth a visit. Very crowded (we went a few days prior to the start of CNY)
,,Pleasant experience,4.0,,"I actually visited Chinatown twice on my trip to Singapore, the second time was to pick up some items I wished I had purchased on my first visit. I was fortunate to be here prior to the Lunar New Year and the decorations were beautiful. There were some temporary nurseries set up for the holiday selling beautiful flowers and orange trees for the New Year celebration, they were picture worthy by themselves. I found the tea shops to be particularly interesting and purchased tea to bring home as gifts. I agree with previous posts, this area is a welcome relief from the high priced stores on Orchard Road. Also, very easy to get to on the MRT. Don't expect to find the designer knock offs you find in other Chinatown locations. An interesting place to spend a couple of hours."
,,An experience!,4.0,,"Chinatown on and around the Chinese New Year is amazing! It is always a vibrant and alive place to visit but there was something extra during this trip. During the day time the streets are alive and the bustle and ""life"" put everyone into a good mood. The food stalls selling seasonal meats had queues of eager people waiting for new deliveries. With the exception of New Year's Eve and New Years Day, the area closes by 1030, as does most of Singapore except the well known bars and restaurants in the Quay areas."
,,Lively and cheap,4.0,,"Easy to get, because Chinatown MRT station is right in the middle of hustle and bustle. Really lively and vibrant area, full of restaurant and shops, actually whole feeling is way more Chinese than Singaporean. After some expensive malls on Orchard Rd and 100 SGD wine bottles on Quays, it was real nice to rest your wallet here for awhile. Delicious street food for coins and after little bargaining citys cheapest souvenirs."
,,Interesting and vibrant,4.0,,"Chinatown is a complete contrast to the 'prim and proper' stores on Orchard Road. It is amazing it still exists.

The place is positively bustling and vibrant with real character and charisma. We had the added bonus of being here during the Lunar New Year celebrations which made it all the more spectacular. The markets are teeming with people - and interesting sights to see. Would recommend.

We also stopped and had some wonderful freshly-made fruit juices."
,,Best Bargains,4.0,,"Chinatown is definitely the go-to place for cheap souvenirs. There are key chains, shirts, magnets, fans, chopsticks, purses, and all sorts of souvenirs here that are much cheaper compared with other markets. Make sure to buy in bulk to get a discount. There are also plenty of eating places here and some stalls selling beverages right when you get out of the train station. One advice though: it can get really hot in the afternoon, so shop in the morning.

Also, for some reason, my map application does not pick up all the small streets in Chinatown, so it's much easier to get lost here than anywhere in Singapore when relying only on digital maps. Make sure to bring an actual map and ask around, especially if you're planning to visit the temples in Chinatown."
,,Loved China Town,4.0,,I loved China Town but it was very busy as it was close to the Chinese lunar year. Lots to see and was within walking distance of my hotel. Shows were available but difficult to get a seat.
,,Good Place,4.0,,Good to walk and pass your time the food is great but the ways are a bit confusing. Great to see another type of place in Singapore!
,,nice to walk around and buy cheap souvenirs,4.0,,"I went there a few weeks before Chinese New Year and the decoration of horse (this year will be horse year) and chinese coin in here is really make me in Chinese atmosphere. You can buy many Singapore cheap souvenirs in here, made in China though haha.. There was a night market too that sold many kind of traditional and authentic chinese goods for the New Year. In here there are a lot of food stall, but unfortunately I cannot buy them because I cannot eat pork. Also if you want to change your money, the money changer here has a good rate (I compared it to Lucky Plaza in Orchard road and they have a same rate). Another good thing is, I found a mosque in mosque street near People's park. :)"
,,Sights and sounds of China and a great place to buy souvenirs for folks at home.,4.0,,"We visited at the begninning of the Chinese new year festivities. The place was decorated with cellophane pineapples and horse sculptures. There were many 5 for SGD 10 and 3 for SGD 10 offers giving us a good opportunity to buy souvenirs for all those folks at home for whom we wanted to get something small to mark the trip. Shawls, embroidered purses, replica merlions, playing cards with Singapore sights on them, all are available at budget friendly prices.

The Tintin Shop in Chinatown was an unexpected little jewel. The prices were hardly comparable with the other prices available in the area as everything was expensive. But if you are a Tintin fan, you would be thrilled to see lfesize figures of Tintin, Captain Haddock and Snowy as well as smaller figurines of the Unicorn, Thompsons, Madame Castafirore and other familiar characters. Collector's editions of the books too are available so save up if you're a Tintin buff and want to get a few items.

The hustle and bustle in the evenings can get a little difficult to handle if you dislike crowded spaces so morning may be a better time to shop but if you want to soak in the Chinese new year in Chinatown experience you should go in the evening to see the lanterns, lit up sculptures and fireworks."
,,Nice to walk around and good food !,4.0,,It's nice and good to walk around. Food are nice here. Looks simple and touristic. The shops looks colorful.
,,Nice to walk around,4.0,,"Although around pagodastreet is just another market, it still breathes enough chinese atmosphere to make it attractive. Some pagoda's confirm that feeling. It's not a real shopping arcade, but nice to wander around for some time."
,,Pick your place to eat,4.0,,"Great place to visit especially if you happen upon a Firework display, health and safety tends to go out the window, but very enjoyable. I love Chinese food but again you have to be careful and look around for the reasonably priced places, it is very easy to get ripped off, check what you actually get for your money, not everything is included in the price. The shops are very interesting to wander through."
,,INTERESTING,4.0,,We saw the beginning of the opening of the Chinese New Year parade/festival. Very noisy and crowded but enjoyable. We couldn't see much but there were big screens. Also an OK firework display. The market was interesting and buzy. Food stalls aplenty.
,,Love love love Chinatown,5.0,,Wow love it. The hawker stall are amazing and the street market feel is fab. U can by an endless supply of suvineers here as well as spend at least half a day just wandering around and the streets full of lanterns spanning the width of the road.
,,Well worth the visit,4.0,,"Very safe, very accessible area of Singapore which during our visit was looking its best in anticipation of Chinese New Year. Quite easily in a day you can take in the main sights of the Chinatown Heritage Centre, the Budha Tooth Relic temple, the Mariammar temple and be spoilt for choice for lunch in the Maxwell Road Food Centre. Oh and then there is the shopping - a wide variety of everything .... we did barter for a couple of items and got the lower price"
,,Great place to wander around,4.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic temple was great to visit and go inside. Also nearby and worth visiting are the Sri Mariamman Indian Hindu Temple and the Muslim Mosque. Note...you do need to cover up shoulders and legs in some of these but they all supply cover-ups for you to wear.

A good day out and well worth a visit!"
,,Poor imitation,2.0,,"Seems a little faked up for the tourists, not what I expected considering the large Chinese presence in Singaporean history."
,,one of the best attracrtion In Singapore,4.0,,"I love to go here because It has a lot of restaurant which are delicious food ; Yum-Cha, Tak po, Hawker restaurant , Char siew Rice and Duck roasted rice on Chinatown Complex"
,,Short trip will do,3.0,,"Imaging a large amount of market stalls in a very strong Asian theme and you can picture what's going on in China Town. It's mass souvenir shopping at it's best with a few temples and dining experiences scattered throughout. We walked through, bought a few items and saw a nice Buddhist temple on our travels.

It's worth seeing briefly for an hour before you head off to your next destination. There is a train station in the heart of the area, getting in an out is easy enough."
,,Souvenir Shopping only from China Town in Sinagapore,4.0,,"China Town is best visited in Singapore to Purchase and get lots and lots of Cheap Souvenirs for your friends and family.
Once you get off the M.R.T from china town you are right there in the Sovenir street.
Please buy all your stuff from Gift master...i purchased a whole lot of souvenirs from there.
S$10 for 3 gifts.tissue box covers,bag tags,bags,Mirrors,stationery,small purses etc S$ 10 you can get 6 key chains or 6 magnets which i thought was great.
Please survey that street carefully before you purchase anything as all the shops keep more or less the same stuff...but i just thought that Gift Master was a branded and cool shop which also gave a reciept for your purchase."
,,No special experience,3.0,,"To me it seemed like any other china town experience I've had so far! Lots of people and cheap, oriental goods. Had a coconut. That was pretty cool. Recommend it for first time china town visitors."
,,Nothing Special,3.0,,"Not much difference to other Chinese Quarters in other big cities.

It is however quite pleasant, with myriad of food options and a small pedestrian mall with the market stands selling your usual crafts and clothing, etc

Not a place to rush to during a short itinary, but worthwhile for a combined visit / dinner"
,,chinese New year lights up on 11 Jan evening,5.0,,"As the chinese lunar new year is approaches, this is the best timing of the year to visit Chinatown. The lights up ceremony will be held on Sat 11 Jan at 6.30/7pm. The whole streets will be decorated with festive lights, good for photo taking.

Do look out for the rows of street stalls selling new year goodies and all sorts of snacks, decorative items. Soak in the festive atmosphere!"
,,"A little bit less Singapore, a little bit more Asia",5.0,,"We went to Chinatown in Singapore and although we've been to more impressive Chinatowns in other cities, we really had a good time there. We spent a lot of time in the Chinatown complex. It felt like we were the only two non-Chinese there. Especially in the basement floor (all the fresh food, vegetables, fish) and the 1st floor with the foodcourt. Foodcourt means hundreds of little 2x3 meter stands with chinese food. You'll need a little trust that your stomach will be fine afterwards (which it was), but then you'll get some great food there."
,,Colourful,4.0,,Little market stall shops were a really good way to get some resonably priced gifts. I really loved the architecture though. It is very pretty to look at the houses ompared to the rising buildings in the background it takes you back to another time.
,,What you'd expect...,3.0,,"From Singapore Lockdown at Clarke Quays, we walked to Chinatown and had a wander around. Pretty much what you would imagine. Great for cheap souvenirs and we got some lovely paper cut art pieces that I am yet to frame and hang. A highlight of this area would be the temple at the end of the road. The building is extremely beautiful and amazingly detailed."
,,A Visit to China without the Visa,5.0,,I love visiting Chinatowns. I believe the Chinatown in Singapore is the best around - outside of China of course! The place is colourful and authentic. Our family always goes searching for the best foot massage whilst there and each time we're not disappointed. Once off the plane with swollen feet - head for Chinatown and get those feet massaged for a very small price. For Yum Cha we head for the Yum Cha Restaurant. This is expensive - you pay for towels and peanuts as well as the food - but worth the visit. Pop into the traditional medicine halls for an education and haggle for souvenirs. The surrounding temples are also worth a look. Its a great place to visit.
,,The other Singapore,4.0,,"Chinatown, a part of Singapore that makes you feel you're in another place altogether.... A different side of Singapore. Old Chinese temples, quaint little restaurants serving authentic Chinese food and a lot more to see.
I've been to two or three restaurants there and loved them. Next time I'm going to try some more."
,,One of the main touristic attractions in SG,4.0,,"Chinatown is a neighborhood that you visit regularly, even if you are a SG resident. The atmosphere is something different from the rest of the city, and you can add some cultural experiences to the shopping and eating (i.e., you can visit the Sri Mariamman Temple, and the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum, which is beyond impressive and obviously the Chinatown Heritage Centre, which, I feel, is overlooked by tourists and it's a huge pity). The amount of cheap & bad quality stuff you can buy hides quite amazing products, so you really need to take time and look everywhere. Just a warning if you have young kids: if you visit during weekends, it can be difficult to go around with a stroller (and during Chinese New Year, impossible)."
,,Chinatown Hotel/ lunch place/ Tailor.,4.0,,"I stayed at Hotel 1929. Great service, clean, and very near Chinatown. This meant I could pop back ""home "" for a cool down and drink if I wanted to. I went to the markets nearly every day of my 6 days there. Very impressed with Sinagpore generally, safe, clean, polite people generally.

I had lunch at the café under the Buddha Tooth Relic temple, nice Chinese food for a donation, or you can just have a cup of tea, again, a donation. All vegetarian, and delicious. The Temple was beautiful as well.

I used a Tailor in the Pearls Centre, an Albert Tan, his stand is called ""Wardrobe"", on the ground floor, he often has his female assistant working there. Mr Tan respectfully measured me for a pair of women's trousers, despite my having worn a long floaty dress that day! 2 days later, the trousers were delivered to my hotel, and they fit me perfectly. Turns out, he makes the uniforms for my hotel staff as well.
."
,,A trip of Chinese culture,4.0,,"The first destination is Tak Po restaurant. It is a famous traditional Guangdong restaurant so we can have morning tea here. We get up early so there are few people when we get here. However, we can only have the preserved egg porridge. If you go there in the afternoon, you can choose various of food, including different kinds of porridge and more desserts. I think the most delicious food is ,the crimp is really fresh! The steamed pork rib is also a good choice, the pork meat is very tender, you can even feel the gravy in your mouth. It is not very expensive because we ate until our stomachs swollen and it only cost each of us about 10 dollars. It is in the Smith Street, it takes about 5 minutes to go there from the MRT station. On the way to the restaurant, you can see a Tintin shop which will be a fascinating place for the comic fans.
We reward four stars for Tak Po restaurant.

After a satisfied morning tea, we went to Nagore Durgha Shrine.The Shrine is a religious building for Indian Muslim. As for architecture, it has Indian features. The parapet has fringe which is of Indian style, and the pattern on the minarets and the arches has Indian features as well. However , it doesn’t open to public because it is in the maintenance until the end of this month.. If you want to visit the inside, you should go there in January.

Thian Hock Keng Temple is a traditional Chinese temple, it is a combination of different religions in China. You can see Confucius, Mazu and Buddha there. Only a few Chinese people are Buddhist but we will go to the temple and pray for the grace of the Buddha, especially at the beginning of the year. Mazu is a goddess who blesss the sailors according to the folklores in Hokkien area.
Al-Abrar Mosque is a Malay mosque. However, is is influenced by Indian architecture.

The next task is quite interesting, we needed to find certain architecture in the Amoy street . The process was not easy, because we had to know much about different architectural styles.

There are two food centres in Chinatown. Maxwell food centre is a smaller one. I tried a milk tea called three-colour milk tea. You can see three different colours because it is mixed by chocolate , coffee and milk tea. The Chinese complex food centre is much bigger. We played a interesting game. To win the game, we must be the first group which find all the food shops. We won the game although I lost my way in the centre.

Fried Hokkien Mee
Although Hokkien Mee is popular in Singapore, it is my first time to try it.
The chef put noodles and bean sprouts into a pan, and added soup, fresh shrimps
and pork to it. Fresh lime and chili sauce was added in the end.
To begin with, I didn't know that I should squeeze the lime juice into the noodles. However, the noodle itself tasted good enough. The noodles may be a little bit different from the ones I had in China. In addition to the original taste of noodles, the fresh shrimps and crispy been sprouts made it tastier. Adding chili sauce and lime juice to it, the noodles tasted special.

I tired fish ball noodle at Chinatown. I think it is very delicious. The fish balls are quite different from china. In china, the fish balls are very soft and they are made from finely dices. In contrast, the Singapore’s fish balls are very compact and elastic. To start with they tasted like tofu but harder than tofu. The balls won’t disintegrate unlike Chinese fish balls, if you bite it. They remain the umami of fish but don’t have fishy taste. In fact the noodles are not traditional noodles, they are rice noodle，it looks like vermicelli, but it is softer than traditional vermicelli, and it has fragrance of rice. I am sure you will love it.

At first, I think the temple is quite different from the temples in Northern China, especially the decoration on the eaves. After we were back to the hostel and searched for some information on the Internet, I found that the painting on the wall and the decoration was a typical symbol in traditional Hokkien temples. I felt the great differences between the North and the South of China and the greatness of Chinese culture. However, there was an atmosphere of relaxation in the temple, which was totally different from the serious and holy atmosphere in the temples we visited before.

Chinatown is a good place for the foreign visitors, but I don’t think it is a good destination for Chinese people. It doesn’t feel like China at all. It is a combination of a variety of cultures including Hokkien culture, Malay culture and Indian culture. The only thing I think it is belongs to Chinese culture is the Buddha tooth temple. There are many gliding Buddha and handwritings in the temple. However, you can have many kinds of Chinese food in the hawker centre such as roast duck rice and yuntun noodles. Most of them are the food in southern China, if you want to try some food of northern China, you may be disappointed."
,,Chinatown Market,4.0,,"Loved the chinatown market, lots to see! Very touristy and the stalls sell mainly souvenir goods so be aware if this is not your thing. Located next to Sri Marianmam temple. Worth a look around if you are in the area."
,,"Fun to walk around, weave in and out of shops",5.0,,"Plenty of shops, food, touristy things…but all together worth a stop. You can weave through the narrow streets, appreciate the architecture, and visit a few temples along the way. Might as well stop through as it's quite close to many other attractions in Singapore."
,,Touristy,3.0,,"This area has a lot of souvenir shops. If you choose to base yourself here, there are a lot of relatively affordable (by Singapore standards) boutique hotels and eateries, including the famous Maxwell Hawker Center, so there's a lot to do just by walking around It's definitely more affordable here than in Orchard Road, but it's still more touristy than Geylang or Ang Mo Kio. Interesting sites to check out here are the Chinatown Heritage Center, the Buddhist Temple and the Sri Mariamman temple.

If you're coming from other parts of Singapore, access is easy with the Chinatown station and the Tanjong Pagar line at the other end."
,,VERY POOR SERVICE IN CHINATOWN,1.0,,"I am a tourist from Malaysia. Before I came to Singapore, I think that Singapore is a clean, green and the people here are very friendly and kind. Today (14 Dec 2013 Saturday), my family and I (10 people) went to visit Chinatown at around 1-1.30p.m to shop and buy some souvenirs. However, we encountered some unpleasant conflicts. We saw a shop that sells 4 for $10 bags and we wanted to check it out. There was a China saleswoman that served us. After we had decided to buy, we asked sincerely if we could check whether the zips are working but she gave us a horrible attitude. She shouted to us in Chinese “Just hurry up and give me the money first, if you want to check, go out and check. Such cheap stuff no one will want to cheat you.” (钱拿来钱拿来！这么便宜的东西谁要骗你？要check 出去外面check！)We were selecting the different type of bags happily but she gave us a frustrated and fierce expression. Although, we asked her politely and gently, she raised her voice at us and demanded us to pay quickly. When we left the shop, another man (maybe is her boss or colleague) standing outside the shop, scolded us in a rude tone. He shouted in Chinese “You thought you are buying something expensive?” ( 你买十块的东西你以为你买一百万？) I felt very angry and disappointed at how the service was delivered to us, we wanted to shop even further and buy more things. Due to this incident, our moods and our trip were spoilt. We find that such kind of behaviour spoils the image of Singapore and Chinatown. We love travelling in Singapore but such behaviour will damage the tourism in Singapore. We wish that actions can be taken and be put into light.

I had taken some photos of the saleswoman, the location of the shop I am a tourist from Malaysia. Before I came to Singapore, I think that Singapore is a clean, green and the people here are very friendly and kind.

I had taken some photos of the saleswoman the location of the shop (which is beside Santa Grand Hotel Chinatown, the address is 20 Trengganu St)and how the shop looked like"
,,Good shopping,4.0,,"Like the good bargain of goods, good varieties for towels, household, food, etc Dislike kia Su attitude"
,,Great Area,5.0,,"If your in Singapore, Chinatown is a must see area, great food and just a great area to explore. Don't just do the shopping area, visit the other parts for a great experience. If you get turned around just ask anyone and they will be more then glad to help. We were in Singapore for 2 months visiting family and we spent at least 2 days every week in Chinatown. Have fun, it doesn't get any easier then this to enjoy a great culture."
,,Atmosphere and of course - shopping,4.0,,"There are a number of temples in Chinatown, but the best is Sri Mariamman Hindu temple with its colourful entrance. It is on the corner of Pagoda Street which has a very lively market for Singapore souveniers. It also houses the many tailors who will run up shirts in 24 hours or suits in a little longer. There are a few eateries on this street but there are better choices on adjoining and parallel streets such as Smith Street. On Pagoda Street is the Chinese Heritage Centre which is well worth a visit."
,,"Always love visiting Chinatowns, won't miss this one.",5.0,,"Getting to Chinatown is easy via MRT as there is a Chinatown station. One can spend hours in Chinatown as it is quite expansive and there are many streets. There are actual stores in buildings and there are also many stalls set up on a couple of streets. If you need refreshments stop at the Chinatown Complex and go to the floor with all the hawker stands. There is a wet market in the basement where you can buy many things, especially fresh fruit if you are a tourist who want to try all the exotic fruits. Some are cut up and ready to eat. Maxwell is another hawker center which is close by. If time is not of the essence and you love it you can probably spend a whole day/evening here. So colorful and so many things to see and buy."
,,Great gift shopping,4.0,,lots of shops to buy cheap souvenir and gifts. Do take your time and walk around before making your purchase if you are bargain hunting.
,,Wanna find some cheap but good stuff? Come Here!,4.0,,"Well, if you want to buy your family or friend some stuff from Singapore, you can come to Chinatown. It is cheaper than any other shopping area in Singapore. After walking around shopping area in Singapore such as Little India, etc, I found that chinatown is the cheapest among all of them.

Since the MRT station is right in front of the chinatown street, it is very easy to reach Chinatown!"
,,Vibrant part of Singapore,4.0,,"Chinatown is a great place to do some shopping or just walk around and soak up the atmosphere. In particular, night markets are good. The place also has quite a colourful history. If you want to eat here, I would recommend Smith Street or any of the nearby hawker centres - some of the restaurants are nice but a lot more expensive. Also, be prepared to be offered a suit several times as you walk past the tailors' shops."
,,A place to get lost,4.0,,"Allow yourself to get lost here and visit the small and quiet streets of the south-east side of the New Bridge Rd. There are some lovely small boutiques.
and take a trip down there during the night and enjoy the red lantern hanging above the roads - it's great!"
,,Good place to wander around and do a bit of shopping,4.0,,We like to wander around markets do a bit of window shopping stop and eat have a drink on the side of the road etc etc. This is a good place to do it could have spent hours wandering around here.
,,"Chinese market, cheap rates and few temples",4.0,,"One of the must visit place for the people who wanted to see the Chinese market and to buy the cheapest dresses both males and females both. Key points for this place
- Rates of cheapest Singapore logo t-shirts are “3 for 10 SGD” and here “4 for 10 SGD”
- Varity of Chinese ladies dress.
- Foot massage, Fish Spa and Body massage.
- Buddhist temple, Hindu temple, Mosque etc.
- Lots of foods option Chinese, India and Muslim food."
,,Chinatown tour with the best trishaw experience,5.0,,"Bus collected us from our accommodation and we met our guide who took us to a little Chinese shop where gave a gentleman our first name and he painted it on a fan in chinese letters and we got to keep the fan. We were then taken around the corner to the markets to shop for about 45 mins (nothing too interesting here) and then we went upstairs to a yum char restaurant for dinner (I've had better - one dish we didn't know what it was).
After dinner we jumped on a trishaw for a ride to Clarke Quay. This was the best - our rider was so friendly - my partner yelled our Merry Christmas when riding through the markets, they both kept yelling out Merry Christmas, helllooo and waving at everybody, we had much fun.
We finished the trip off with a night cruise."
,,Go with a local,3.0,,"Chinatown is dominated by a small, tawdry tourist market selling rubbishy trinkets - a shame, as it detracts from the genuine culture and history which you have to really seek out.
We went with local Cantonese speakers, and so had lunch at the oldest still-operating yum cha house, as well as snacking at the best of the hawker stalls.
There is a tourist info centre, small but very contemporary, that gives a taste of the rich history of this area that built so much of Singapore's commercial and cultural present. Also in the area are several significant temples including the historic (and hectic) Kuan Im Temple in Waterloo St, and the modern, colourful pagoda of the Buddha's Tooth Relic Temple - look out for the old men playing Chinese chess on the small tables outside, keeping up an old tradition of leisure and community."
,,Great trip at Chinatown,4.0,,"After hearing my friend's advice, I decided to visit Chinatown. Walking on the street at here, I feel like in China. True of its name, everything of this place is same as in China. It has great atmosphere and the street vendors selling many types of peppers, dried herbs, fresh seafood, and typical Chinese souvenirs. We bought a lot of things at here and price was reasonable. I love here very much. Highly recommend. If you have a chance, I will get back here."
,,crazy for jade or glass bangles or chinese dresses,4.0,,"They have a good collection of china stuffs.... like silk scarves,dresses for kids n grown ups... jade they hav varity.... u hav to b smart in ur bargain n buying.... u can also get cheap souveniers.... but i find the place clean.... there s a mosque nearly the shopping area....."
,,China Town,4.0,,"China Town gave is totally differnt from the rest of Singapore as you cannot find the huge skyscrappers but just two or three storey buldings. You will find the same general interests as other chinese areas in big cities around the world but with a sense of a greater severity, which from my view characterizes the whole city"
,,Chinatown in Singapore,4.0,,"I was in Singapore in Sept of 2012 for a business trip. For me, it was the place to go to buy items for friends and great local food. During the two weeks I was there, I ate in a regular restaurant once. The rest of the time I ate in the food courts in Chinatown. It was wonderful."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"After finally finding it at the second attempt was pleasantly surprised very nice atmosphere around the place, plenty of tailors if you're in need for a custom made shirt or suit. Cheap food outlets and beer :-)"
,,Great area to look around,4.0,,"Got MRT (train) to Chinatown. Great place to wander around and look in the shops and stalls...some very good bargains, clothes, souveneirs etc. The Buddah Tooth Relic temple was great to visit and go inside. Also nearby and worth visiting are the Sri Mariamman Indian Hindu Temple and the Muslim Mosque. Note...you do need to cover up shoulders and legs in some of these but they all supply cover-ups for you to wear. A good day out and well worth a visit."
,,Head to Maxwell Rd hawker center!,5.0,,"The MRT takes you to straight to Chinatown, making it very easily accessible. A great place to pick up souvenirs as its a lot cheaper than most other places in Singapore. Skip the indoor market, the outdoor market is so much better! Head to Maxwell Rd hawker center (located near the Buddha tooth relic temple) for some yummy food at very affordable prices. You will be spoilt for choice."
,,Chinatown is very nice for good and cheap food,5.0,,if you stay in chinatown you can have very good food for low prices all around this part of the city. everything is open till 10pm we stayed there one whole day walking and sightseeing this part. you can go there by metro (chinatown MTR)
,,Lots of cheap finds,4.0,,"This place is filled with shops and restaurants. Easily accessible via MRT, Chinatown offers a lot of cheap finds, perfect for souvenir shopping."
,,Bring home a slice of Chinese Culture,4.0,,"As you come out of MRT, you land in heart of Chinatown, Singapore’s largest historic district, nestled close to the bustling business hub. Chinatown is now made up of exotic pre-war shop houses, home to merchants who have been hawking the same wares for years – bales of fine silk, traditional handicrafts, and gold and jade jewellery. It stocks a wide array of authentic Chinese products such as tea, medicinal herbs, foods, household items, antiques and traditional Chinese costumes. Do buy souvenirs, fridge magnets, wall clocks, wrist watches having Singapore theme on them."
,,Culturally fascinating place,4.0,,"There is almost certain that you'd see a Chinatown in any large cities and Singapore is one of them. As there's a large Chinese population in Singapore, this Chinatown is a very comprehensive, culturally interesting. Some beautiful displays will catch your attention as you arrive. Very easy to get there by MRT from anywhere in Singapore. Many souvenir shops along & fun to stroll around. Shop keepers will try to get your attention but you just have to say no thanks & move along if you're not interested. Shops have lots of touristy stuff but you could find some interesting souvenirs too."
,,Great place for tat and none sense,5.0,,"MRT station brings you up on the street itself. Everything Singapore is here and at a very decent price. It's also a good place to walk around even if you don't want to shop. Good restaurant and bar in the middle which was full of men watching football, presumably whilst the shops were full of women!"
,,Tourist tat mecca!,5.0,,"With the MRT stop back in the middle of Chinatown it couldnt be any easier to get to.

The market is essentially full of tourist souvenirs but a little digging turns up some gems. There is a restaurant in the middle of the market thats called Chinatown Seafood. It does large tiger beers for the cheapest price I could find in Singapore (bar a 7/11)

Great for a walk around."
,,Buy your tourist stuff here,4.0,,"I went here on a Wednesday during the day. Not overly crowed. Glad I went, was an enjoyable stroll.

The area has the usual Chinatown stuff, such as Chinese medicine shops, food, massage/acupuncture/reflexology/cupping therapy venues etc.

Chinatown has its own MRT station, so its easily accessible. Buses are also an easy and cheap method of transport.

I wandered through Pagoda and Temple streets. If you want to pick up some cheapie souvenirs such as key rings, fridge magnets, I love SG bags, chop sticks, trinkets, clothing, etc, etc, this is the place to buy them. For example a pack of 6 key rings for $2;Decorative chopsticks for $1. Wander through and have a good look before buying, as stock, quality and prices vary slightly from stall to stall.

There are also a variety of food stalls about...however if your not the adventurous type, or allergic to seafood like me, you'll find a McDonalds on the corner of temple street.

Worth a look about if you feel like strolling about for an hour or two.

Happy travels : )"
,,Excellent place to visit/friendly,4.0,,"We went to Chinatown with my hubby and 3 children, by mrt, and the children where surprised about Chinatown and they loved it, the place is very busy with alot of markets, foods, etc. eating there isn't a problem as there are hawkers huts and restaurants everywhere, if you walk around Chinatown town it's amazing how there are some old buildings hidden away, the main market was excellent to view and look around. This place is definitely a must if you have time to spare, the children enjoyed it and the people where very pleasant."
,,Buyers Beware Jewellery,4.0,,"Went to a Jewellery store in China town on my last day. I was taken around the back streets by a Tri Rickshaw guy. Very pleasant showing me all the sites and the last stop he motioned me to a Jewellery store. After being harassed by the occupants of this store I sat down and looked at the Jewellery they had on offer. I finally settle on a lovely ring! Supposedly emeralds in a silver setting. The price was negotiated down to $150 Singapore dollars.
I was quite happy with my purchase until: I wore it for the first time out to dinner back home. I placed my hand on the table to show my friends and the ring just broke in 3 pieces.
Even costume jewellery wouldn't do that! I was certainly scammed. The unfortunate part of all this I have lost all the pieces that I was intending to send back to them with a very nasty letter.
I have learnt my lesson not to trust buying something I don't know anything about and especially from people that harass you and have you believe things are genuine.
$150 for experience!!!"
,,An eye opener,4.0,,"china town was a good afternoon trip, great atmoshere and lots on offer for sale, some good some rubbish. Fresh and dried spices and herbs and all manner of foods. very colourful lots of stalls. be careful about being talked into shops where they want to make clothes or sell you jewellery etc, difficult to get away without being rude!"
,,nice place to shop,4.0,,i loved the buddhist temple in chinatown. it is definitely worth a visit. the giant buddha and numerous smaller ones are a sight worth seeing. shopping is also worth it especially souvenirs like magnets and keychains which you csn buy in groups of 6 !
,,Nothing Special,2.0,,"Unfortunately the beautiful architecture of Chinatown is hidden by tacky stalls selling plastic rubbish to tourists. If you want a crap Tshirt from here then do visit! The hawker food is extremely expensive compared to other hawker centres in Singapore and nothing special. If you want decent Chinese food at a good price, go to Albert Court food court near Bugis instead."
,,INTERESTING CULTURE,3.0,,"Visit Chinatown area of Singapore and you step back in time. It's street vendors selling many many types of peppers, dried herbs, fresh seafood, and typical Chinese souveniers. The people were friendly and humble. Definately a simple way of life and seemed to be much poverty here. But so glad we had the opportunity to experience it while in Singapore."
,,CHINATOWN SINGAPORE.,5.0,,"A beautiful part of Singapore is Chinatown to view & shop in this beautiful area of the city.Clean,ornamented with corful lanterns in mid Autumn festival celebrations added extra attraction & color.Me & my sons purchased many souvenirs & gifts for our loved ones at reasonable prices on 13th Sept 2013.I will highly recommend other visitors to go around , visit & shop at this place."
,,fun exploration for Chinese Culture,5.0,,"it is definitely a great place to go if you like everything Chinese. The food there are authentic, such as freshly baked egg tarts.And plenty stalls selling Chinese traditional decorations, antiques, etc. Very close to the train station, too. Very convenient location."
,,save your money,3.0,,"Really disappointed. Food was very expensive at a street cafe. Could not believe that hawker food on plastic chairs could be $89.00 for 3 people. Less than average, noodles, fried rice and wontons and spring rolls. i serve of each shared. Poor quality food. Shopping was trash but was fun at the same time. A little expensive but friendly people. Tintin shop was great, found another eatery upstairs Smith street after we had eaten where a lot of locals were. May have been better. trickshaw riders hit two pedestrians crossing smith street so be careful.
Not a big area as expected but was fun. Found out later you can barter with prices, never mind had a great night although did not purchase much."
,,Now more modernised,5.0,,"This area has been completely renovated with too many tourist shops although you can still see traditional Chinese shops such as traditional pharmacists and grocery shops. I first visited this area in 1972 when there was a really traditional Chinatown and the last time 17 years ago, when this had been modernised."
,,save your money,3.0,,"Singapore Chinatown is okay for a quick visit. However, after visiting India and China the price of trinkets seemed unreasonably expensive. We did do some bargaining and pricing was adjusted a bit. It didn't help that the place was overflowing with cruise line tourists that appeared happy to pay whatever cost was posted.
Singapore has been very successful with redevelopment of the city, but too often most of the charm and uniqueness of the neighborhoods are lost in the translation.
Transportation was easy. We used the Singapore airlines bus. This is really the best deal in Singapore."
,,Great cultural fun,5.0,,"So much to see and do. Great food and affordable drink. Shops of all kinds to explore and actually mingle with the owners and their helpers. Very different experience from Orchard Road. If you shop to enjoy yourself, then you will love this area. If you shop to be seen holding bags from expensive department stores so you can be the envy of others, there are endless other areas to explore than here. We did feel very safe in this area."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,We visited on a Thursday afternoon and evening. Was busy but not overly crowded. Fun shopping four touristy gift items. Great ambience.
,,Nice place to shop and be around,3.0,,"Explore the chinese culture and see how they enjoy their life. A good place to shop and get cheap stuff in Singapore. A Must visit place during the Chinese New Year where they celebrate at midnight with fireworks and big time celebration. If you are an Indian, there is temple for GANESHA, (they called it as the temple for the ""ELEPHANT GOD""), just outside Outram Park MRT. It is believed that if you take 108 rounds of the temple, you wish comes true."
,,Sunday wandering,3.0,,Great for those cheaper tourist nick knacks. Some good little stals for snacks. Place fills up quickly on Sundays which gives good vibe. Buddhist Temple nice place to visit. Very calming.
,,Chinatown Chowdown!,5.0,,The family arrived here in the evening seeking sustenance after a long walk through the Botanic a Gardens! The first thing that struck us were the lanterns that lit up the Chinatown precinct. We were there just after the Moon Festival but everything was still grooving! Great gift shops to pick up presents for family and friends and also to add to our numerous fridge magnet collection. A huge array of restaurants - great choice and just a 2 minute walk to catch a cab back to the hotel
,,Great foodies to be had by locals and tourist alike at the Chinatown Hawker Center,5.0,,"Lucky me, my hop on and hop off tour Captain Tan had recommended the best Hainan chicken dish in this location not known to tourist ( I did ask passer by who is clueless & had to be rescued by locals)
When I ate at the 4 B level ..the locals just stayed quiet regarding the "" no good"" Hainan chicken, perhaps? Wow, it was the best tasting ever..tho one does have a choice of roasted chicken which I pass and chose the original's best. Just follow the long line , tian tian I think is the name & which it's line moves on rather quick apt 3.50$. Try also peanut soup with sesame balls and fried dough, yumm coconut was just huge and drinkable but too hard to eat the flesh, so take take glass option to cool off in the muggy heat since the place is not air conditioned and then off to Chinatown for some interesting tons of souvenirs stroll and passing into India town.
There is a small desert place amongst the souvenir stall in Chinatown and I found the green pandan awesome! Ladies, the bathroom was recently remodeled and will cost 20 cents
I, did not need to go there and walked up to a deserted mall for the much needed air con and free bathroom for the use and spotless,
Enjoy!"
,,Diverse and Interesting,4.0,,"As a local, I visit Chinatown regularly as there are many interesting food finds there. Chinese cuisine in Singapore has been localised and various additions have been made to spice up the original dishes that arrived to these shores decades ago. At the food courts above the wet market in Chinatown, you will find many stalls hawking a melting pot of food. My favorites are Satay Bee Hoon, Poh Piah (best spring rolls with crunchy garlic bits..mmm), Beef Tendon noodles...the list goes on..besides food, you can find Beer! A landslide of beers have been released on this island. Previously, say 10 years ago, you could only find 4 different brands, now, I haven't been able to complete the count. Tiger seems to be the favorite brand for the visitors, but I love Chang. Many other sights to see and smells to experience here and if you come during the Chinese New Year, you will be bowled over by the experience, especially at night, as the Chinese make up about 70% of the population."
,,Chinatown _ Peter Jackson,5.0,,"Always a great place to visit when in Singapore, plenty of shops, And Resturants are cheap, try the big food court in the middle."
,,"Great place to stay, shop, eat, shop, eat, eat, eat......",5.0,,"We stayed at Chinatown recently for the second time out of the 3 times we have visited Singapore. We love the colours, markkets, eating places and the fact that the MRT is always close by to travel around Singapore to explore. A night walk around chinatoown is brilliant, whether in the markets or on the outskirts, looking at the old shop houses to the ""Street of the Dead""...we love it and will return again and again. The new chinatown point shops have been really well done too...plenty of choices for anything you are after...."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"We caught the MRT to Outram Park and then walked through Chinatown, towards Chinatown station. We did this in the evening, taking advantage of the market stalls set up in some of the streets. There are lots of eating options too. Chinatown is a good place to purchase souvenirs.
On the other side of the road to Chinatown station is a Chinese department store - a different type of shopping.
Walking on past Chinatown station brings you to the eating outlets and entertainment of Clarke Quay."
,,Lot's of activity. Bargaining fun.,5.0,,"A slow walk through the streets stopping to shop and bargain was truly enjoyable. If one doesn't go to Chinatown, one doesn't go to Singapore."
,,A vibrance next to china itself,4.0,,"Whilst in Singapore it is a sin not to visit Chinatown. Not only can you visit the fabulous Hindu temple but the vibrancy of the area and the markets behind the temple, leave you quite breathless but not penny less. Unlike the Souks in Northern Africa, the traders are not that pushy and allow you,with some reverence, to check out their wares. There are kilometres of narrow passages so take care to note markers and not get lost. Enjoy it is an experience."
,,Worth a visit in context of Singapore's history,3.0,,"While there are many chinatowns worldwide, possibly Singapore's is the best because of the museum tracing the history of Chinese settlement and the depravation people had to go through. Restaurants are good and relatively cheap by local standards. While shopping is also something to go there for, especially tailoring (good men's suits for SGD 500), if you're shopping for anything else especially jewelry, you have to know what you're doing (for example, real jade just cannot be had for the prices quoted and you can end up paying hundreds of dollars for worthless stuff)."
,,Bustlinng ChinaTown,4.0,,"Worth the trip to China Town. Bustling with people and activity! Went for a great foot massage - Bath Culutre Foot Therapy in Chinatown, much needed after walking for a couple of days!"
,,Singapore china town?,3.0,,"Not the most impressive site I have seen or visited. Crowdy and not so intersing. It's falls in the category ""was once spectactular"" is now in the category ""let's find something else to do""."
,,Best Chinatown I've seen!,5.0,,Mist big city's have a Chinatown. This one is so far my favourite. It's so different from other areas of Singapore & so many interesting shops & food places. Definitely worth a visit to this area - you won't regret it.
,,Night out on China Town,4.0,,It was a lovely evening and we were a couple of colleagues visting. There was such a nice vibe and atmosphere in China Town. We had to dine there because we could not leave without a true Chinese cullinary experience. It was a perfect evening!
,,Clean and authentic,4.0,,"It seems every time we visit Chinatown there is some kind of Festival going on this time Lantern and moon cake Even though this Chinatown is now typically 'Singapore sanitized"" still worth a visit with authentic Chinese food and gifts If you look up still a lot of authentic restored shophouses to photograph.
For the collector there is even a Tin Tin store which is one of the best in the World.
Best time is evening as lights come on but disappointed that most shop owners start to close down at 10pm
We went both during the day and night to get full on experience Take a stroll off the main drag to find interesting stores and food patronized by locals
Chinatown MRT right in center"
,,Fun!,4.0,,"This was something completely new and different for us. We really enjoyed just wandering around soaking in the sights and sounds of Chinatown. So much colour in such a small place. Bought a couple of little souvenirs but it would be very easy to spend a lot of money in there. My husband got talked into buying some silk shirts which was quite funny to watch - there was 24hr tailors amongst the many souvenir stalls. We had a cheap meal at one of the food places, great dumplings and big bottles of beer for $7. Fun way to spend the afternoon."
,,Chinatown Trishaw Night Tour,5.0,,"What a fun, informative time. Visited a calligrapher who wrote our names in chinese characters onto a fan, dinner and walk around Chinatown (for shopping fix if needed). Had a fabulous Trishaw ride and then ended the night with a boat trip on the Singapore River from Clarke Quay. Great night."
,,souvenirs heaven,4.0,,"In the souvenir market, just try not to buy them all, you might find better deals on the next store. Most of the items are made in Thailand, though. In nearby shopping area, you can find low price food and don't forget to try the fresh juices, they offer many fruits! Depend on the season, they also sell durian"
,,dirty old chinatown,2.0,,"My wife loves it here,to me its just a dirty old part of Singapore,I suppose it has a kind of raw charm but really not my favorite place. The snow ice place in temple street is good though....."
,,shoppingggg,4.0,,Shopping place for cheap souvenirs other than bugis street. I always love the athmosphere.. you can find almost everything here.
,,Must do when in Singapore,5.0,,"When visiting singapore - Chinatown must be on your to do list. However Chinatown is a big area, and not all parts are great. The food hawkers restaurants & market stalls around Chinatown Heritage Building are the Best.
Must go & try the Chilli Mud Crab at Chinatown's Beer & Seafood Restaurant next to Heritage centre- right in the middle of the Markets."
,,"Great cultural experience, shopping fun with kids",4.0,,"China town was an interesting experience for kids that haven't travelled before. They were amazed at all the cheap ""crap"" you can buy and loved the vibe of the place. It was very colourful and interesting."
,,All human life is here,5.0,,"The markets, temples, street vendors and general bustle all contribute to a fantastic area. Lots of building work going on but that doesn't really get in the way of a fantastic experience"
,,China in Singapore,4.0,,"Chinatown is a very busy street in Singapore which tries to replicate a Chinese atmosphere. You'll find all kinds of Chinese foods and shops in here. Its a nice place to buy souveniers for tourists. You will get plenty of stuffs like T-Shirts, showcase items from Singapore, Merlion models, handbags, etc all with a singapore logo/caption/pic."
,,Disappointing.,3.0,,"Recommended as a true test of the Orient. Very disappointed; very colourful, but people less that polite and shopping expensive for little."
,,Better luck next time,3.0,,"I must have walked in the wrong direction because I did not see anything that everybody else is writing about.. I guess make sure you walk in the right direction!
We caught a train here didnt know where to go because the place looked empty & dead.. We did abit of walking and found food but that is all.
What a shame :("
,,Great markets and cultural sites.,4.0,,"Great place to pick up a souvenir. Don't miss the Buddha tooth relic temple. Just be aware you must cover your shoulders and women their legs. They provide a cloth at no charge for you if you need it.
Great juice bar in the market area just near the temple. $3 ea. I recommend the pineapple. I could have 10 of them!"
,,A must see,5.0,,"Similar to other china towns around the world, china town is a must see in Singapore. Expect bustling streets and bartering for good prices. Shop around and wander the market to find the best deals."
,,Tip: buy your discounted tickets at the Information Centre!,3.0,,"As usual, there are many places to eat at Chinatown and lots of souvenirs to buy (there are also lots of places to get a massage! Although not particularly cheap...) I can't remember the name of the shop, but there is a popular place here that sells delicious shaved ice deserts which are perfect for a hot day.

A tip that we learnt too late is that you can get tickets for many of the major attractions at discounted prices at the information centre in Chinatown. I would suggest that you head here early in your trip and visit the information centre with an idea of what you want to see while in Singapore and buy your tickets from here instead!"
,,Can be enjoyable if you know what to expect.,4.0,,"Its a challenge to write a meaningful review for an entire area - especially if it is something like Chinatown or Little India. Places and services run the gamut from terrible to superb so it's important to do you research on specific attractions and locations in advance and to make sure that its current as things change almost overnight.

I have been to Chinatowns around the world: New York, Toronto, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Bangkok as well as extended stays in Shanghai and Guangzhou so I do have references to compare locations.

Like the rest of Singapore Chinatown here is remarkably clean and well organized which is a plus to start with. Its easy to get to either view taxi which is relatively inexpensive in Singapore, or by MRT to the Chinatown station. The MRT station deposits you directly in the middle and if you take a taxi have them drop you off at Temple Street which is one street over from the MRT. (the MRT street is a vendor mall and not really a working street).

So what can you expect in Singapore's Chinatown? Color, lots of inexpensive souvenirs and gifts, many traditional Chinese medicine shops, a few good and a few great restaurants.

Its fun to explore and experience a little of the importance of the Chinese culture to Singapore's colorful history. Its easy to explore with each street offering interesting merchandise and foods.

Take a look at the website - yoursingapore.com > Culture & Heritage > Cultural Precincts > Chinatown for helpful information and also the TripAdvisor walking guide: http://www.tripadvisor.com/Guide-g294262-i12751-Singapore.html.
I recommend you print a copy out so you can find your way around this very diverse area."
,,Delightful,5.0,,"Singapore Chinatown was a delight. The area is rich in history with a variety of shopping including electronics, locally made wares, art, craft and imported souvenirs. In addition there is a range of food options and services including massage, fish spa and other services.

An enjoyable day to wander the streets shopping and look around. The architecture is also in stark contrast to the architecture of other precincts in Singapore with much of the buildings protected for heritage reasons.

We enjoyed Chinatown much more than Little India and would happily visit again next time we're in Singapore."
,,Love this place! Great atmosphere - A Singapore 'Must Do',5.0,,"Chinatown is a definite 'Must Do' for any trip to Singapore. It is very easy to get to by public transport, taxi or one of the 'Hop on / Hop off' buses. The markets are great with many interesting Chinese grocers and natural therapy shops selling all sorts of weird and wonderful things. You will find some very good & cheap souvenirs. There are also a few places to grab a cheap lunch or dinner. The area is very safe for tourists. The Budda Tooth Relic Temple is also located in China Town - you must not miss this either!"
,,A must see,5.0,,When in Singapore China town is a must see we went 5 Times in a 6 day stay and found new areas everyday
,,"Chinatown ""A Must-Do""",5.0,,"If you are not already near just get the Purple line and get out at NE4 up the ramp and presto you are in the thick of Chinatown. We have eaten at western and Asian eateries and the food is great, inexpensive and touchwood we have never had a tummy-wog. There are heaps of souvenir stalls, great clothing stores, and pretty good for electronic goods...but word of warning, know your prices as you could pay more than you might on special at home."
,,Wonderful atmosphere,4.0,,"We spent the morning looking around and had a great time. The hawker food centre was amazing. We had eaten at our hotel so only bought some fruit drinks (really nice) but still enjoyed the wonderful smells of the different foods being sold there. If we ever get back to Singapore a hawker meal is definitely going to be included in the itinerary. The whole area is great to just wander around and savour the sights and smells, so different from home."
,,Great for food and culture,4.0,,"Yum, definitely visit the hawker centre, great fruit stalls and such a variety of food. Great singaporean experience!"
,,Nice to see 4 sure,4.0,,Good food Nice for souvenirs See the culture Definitely will go again there next time when I'm in Singapore again
,,Interesting place.....,4.0,,"Although it was very hot and humid at 2 pm in midsummer, I really enjoyed the place specially for its architecture, colors, shops and of course food. It was fun to explore Chinese culture within a small area and people here are also nice too. Me and my wife had good time there and would love to go back again with more time to spend.

Have your lunch there if you are a Chinese food lover."
,,Fun shopping experience,5.0,,"We took the MRT to Chinatown from our Hotel, and were pleasantly surprised to find that Chinatown is a great place to walk, shop for trinkets and dine! Some streets were closed to cars, making the experience even better! Make sure to bargain in the open market!"
,,Good place to buy souvenirs,3.0,,"Unless we missed the interesting and typical part of Chinatown, we only recommend this place if you want to have an amazing choice of souvenirs to bring home from Singapore.
The streets consist of souvenirs shops with some of them selling chinese looking stuff .You will also enjoy Chinatown if you look for a tailor as some Indians own these kinds of shops. Electronics can also be bought in these streets but our questions about prices showed us that prices are not interesting at all (ie. a camera lens was proposed to us at 750 SGD while it can be purchased on the official website at 400 SGD..)."
,,Ethnic and original: Chinatown Singapore!,4.0,,"This is another not-to-be-missed place in Singapore. Ethnic and original. All the way from the cheap street food, to the bargains in the street market. Also, the relics of Buddha and the Hindu temple at the other end give it a distinct add-on.

Go there early, as the market closes by 8pm on weekdays. Food options are a plenty, and a meal will cost you about S$5.

And incase you love doing street photography, then this is your place! Just ask before you take snaps, and people will oblige."
,,Sensory overload,5.0,,"Loved Chinatown! Interesting buildings, people, food. Shopping was brilliant. Go to the People's Park for food. Fresh juices, mind boggling choice of food, have a good lunch for under $5."
,,Food trip and bargains,4.0,,"Chinatown offers a wide variety from food to shopping. Try the foodcourt in chinatown malls, or the hawker style, they serve cheap and tasty dishes and also i found there leather wallets on good sale plus also luggage / bags in cheaper prices!"
,,walk into a different world,4.0,,We walked to Chinatown from the merlion..it was wonderful to see the streets change and we entered into this heritage area..a different world.. the lanes are beautiful with wine bars and cafes and you can visit temples for a different feel of this modern city
,,Very Interesting,4.0,,"Many different shops from making of suits for men plus women s cloths & eating outlets of all types of food .

Electronics items of all kind .There is so much to see over a large area.

I feel that you cant afford to miss Chinatown

Bring water with you.It gets Hot with the humidity ,head protection is a must along with sunglasses.

Take your time and enjoy"
,,shopping haven,4.0,,"definitely must bargain for the souvenirs. various types of souvenirs from ornaments, decorations, tees, keychains and plenty more. also admire the building structure ..."
,,SINGAPORE CHINATOWN is the BEST,5.0,,"I've been to many ""CHINATOWNS"" but, this is the winner!!! NO crowd? What happen to people? I should not complain because crowd is not a good thing. Prices are affordable for souvenirs, they have the best food that you could eat. Many choices around, you can eat in the streets or be cozy and be inside the restaurant. Merchants are so friendly and attends to your needs. I was puzzled why there are not much local shoppers around except the tourists. A friend of mine who lives in Singapore told us that the only time Chinatown get crowded is during Chinese New Year. We enjoyed our time here, so chilled that we don't have to hurry and just go with the slow pace. I wish all Chinatowns are like this :))) I would definitely go back in this area if I have the chance to go back to Singapore."
,,Best bargain for Goods and casual restos,4.0,,one of the popular tourist spots in Singapore where you can buy cheap goods as pasalubong for loved ones. Stroll in the area and you will find chinese style architectures that are well preserved despite the progress of the city.
,,Center of everything,3.0,,"Numerous times we visited the Chinatown of Singapore , we spend most of our stay in Singapore in hotels in this area.Accessible with every transportation method available in SG ,like MRT ,Buses, Taxis.We prefer to use the MRT to go to this place , the exit of Chinatown MRT is just in front of the Pagoda street.You can find Singapore souveniers like keychain , pillows , shirts etc in the stalls and shophouses along Pagoda street.Some outdoor restaurants also serve Chinese and international cuisine.Look for the Tin Tin shop ,the Chinese Heritage Museum , the Buddha tooth relic temple ,and a big Hindu temple within a short walk.U can find bargain hotel and hostels also near this area , and some shopping complex.Worth to visit and feel the atmosphere.View in the evening was stunning with red lanterns all over, a must see"
,,"Myer's Jewellery, Chinatown, Singapore",5.0,,Before we visited Singapore I got a quote from a local jeweller to set a semi precious stone in 9ct gold. I took the stone with me to Singapore and found Myer's Jewellery while we were walking around Chinatown. A tall man named Mike / Moke / Michael served me and gave me a quote to have the stone set in a 14ct gold cast setting. After doing some bargaining the quote was approximately 1/3 of the cost to have the stone set at home. The ring was ready for me to collect 24 hours later. I was given a Certificate of Authenticity and the ring is stamped inside the shank. I enjoy wearing my pretty ring and recommend this shop to other travellers.
,,An interesting place to visit and eat good clean street food,4.0,,"I would recommend a visit if you want to eat either in a restaurant or in one of the street vendors. As you would expect from Singapore everything is clean. Food is tasty I particularly like the skate and also the sweet and sour fish as well as the crispy baby squid. You can take a look at the many stalls to buy some souvenirs and see a temple and also another market less touristy. There are a few places where you can have reflexology or a massage and also some nice shops where you can buy some Chinese antiques such as coins, pots or some bigger items. Also next to the tube but within walking distance of the quays or get a taxi as they are not expensive. If you want to get a cab ask to go to Temple Street and then you have several parallel roads to explore. Well worth a visit wen if you don't plan to eat there."
,,What is a real Chinatown to you?,5.0,,"Interestingly, tourists' impressions of authentic Chinatowns are recollected from memories / visits of Chinatowns around the world: bustling markets, relatively ""dirtier""/ less-kept than the rest of the other city, filled with Chinese/Asians and Asian-run shops / restaurants / with original / immigrant occupants etc (eg. a commercial cum residential enclave), older buildings etc. Singapore's Chinatown in fact looks ""new"" (repainted, conserved, new shops, some un-Asian looking shops). Would this makes Singapore's Chinatown any less-Chinatown than the rest of the world?

Unfortunately, for tourists who have been to Singapore before the mid 1980s before extensive conservation was made to Chinatown, the Chinatown then and now is very very different. Some who lived through those periods would have remember Chinatown as old, bustling, crammed (buildings crammed with occupants), very smelly (food/ poultry / vegs were sometimes thrown down the drain, choked). These old crammed buildings were both fire and structural hazards for their occupants. Some tourists those days would not have venture into Chinatown then - the smell and sights were quite overpowering/overwhelming to some.

A painful but necessary step was made to conserve the beautiful architectures of Chinatown by resettling its many occupants (many families could be staying in one single shophouse unit)! Many structural reinforcement were made (relocating the occupants were the only way) - but the building facades were retained and restored to its former glories to be enjoyed for many more generations to come.

To have a Chinatown conform to certain qualities - pose questions on what ""authenticity"" truly mean? Is there a certain definition to Chinatown? Its occupants? Its markets? The original ""intents"" of Chinatowns around the world have evolved to serve different purpose in current context - some are serving new immigrants who are not necessarily Chinese in origins - some are just gathering places of Chinese restaurants and goods in a society that have largely assimilated them. In Singapore - faced with many challenges then - our Chinatown today have also evolved like the rest of the world. The history and culture of our Chinatown are preserved through the conservation of buildings (many beautifully restored), culture (still a meeting place of many Chinese shops including traditional medicinal shops, Chinese jewellers, cuisines, festivals (heart of the festivities during Chinese New Year), place of worships (including Hindu temples/ mosques). In Singapore's context, today's Chinatown is a much more attractive and accessible place to visit for a larger population of tourists and Singaporeans.

To label Singapore's Chinatown as unauthentic / wacky / artificial / amusement park is missing the entire point of what Chinatown really is to its people. Such labeling of Chinatown can also be outright offensive even to the point of becoming or reinforcing ""racial"" stereotypes of particular quarters. Our entire Chinatown has taken quite a different route from the rest of the world (eg. Bangkok, KL, NYC, Toronto, London) - lovingly restored / preserved so that many can enjoys its beauty for many more generations to come.

For those who wants to know how the Chinatown pre-restoration was like, below are some amazing footages of the ""authentic"" Chinatown of Singapore then:

,,Not my cup of tea.,3.0,,"We did the ""Night @ Chinatown"" tour and I must say Chinatown was quite boring and full of cheap junk that was much the same in every shop. As part of the tour we had a meal at a Chinese restaurant and the food was quite bland and boring but having said that I'm sure you would be ale to get much better food if you went looking for it. When we left Chinatown we were taken down to Clarke Quay by Trishaw which was a lot of fun as our driver/rider was a bit of a comedian! From there we jumped on a Bumboat for a ride down the river and around the Harbour and being night time the trip was fantastic with all the city lit up. All in all a good experience but could have been better."
,,got to visit,5.0,,"one of the best tourist areas to visit in Singapore. there is a little bit of everything, food and drink, small shops large shops market stalls, you can buy anything you can think of. there are sights to see, pagoda and temple to start with, and lots of places to just wander round and look at.
all in all one of my favourite spots in Singapore."
,,One of the better China Towns.,4.0,,"This is the place to go for cheap souvenirs. Lots of 3 for $10 shops but also a lot of good quality souvenirs also available. Lots of places to eat. Make sure you explore the People's Park Complex and the People's Park Centre and sample some of the local food from one of the hawker stalls. Maxwell Road Hawker Centre also has many excellent hawker stalls. If you're after chicken rice from Tian Tian, get there early otherwise the lines get very very long."
,,Has to be visited,5.0,,"Nice place to go and see a little bit of China, this is the place to buy souvenires, eat a lot of chinese food, good and cheap and if you need a taylor made suit, you can do it here, good quality, good price and very Nice fabrics"
,,Good taster for the kids of what Chinese life is like,4.0,,"An awakening of the senses. Smells, colour, foods, noise, and temples for the soul! In small but accessible dose. Bargains to be found. Some of the Chinese very welcoming, chatty and interested... But not all! Very doable in half a day, or longer if you want to meander"
,,So much energy and people watching,5.0,,"I would say that Singapore's Chinatown is a must see. Take the NorthEast (purple) train line to Chinatown and then leave the station via Exit A which will bring you out directly onto Pagoda Street.

Chinatown is full of 3-for-10 stores. You can buy any three items marked as such for SG$10. This is the perfect place to get some touristy souvenirs. We didn't bargain at all, unlike KL's chinatown, but give it a shot if you want.

There are a number of covered outdoor restaurants that serve decent food and cheap drinks. Large Tiger beer for SG$6.75 or an ice cold coconut... yum! From here you can engage in some great people watching."
,,The allure of Chinatown,5.0,,A visit to Chinatown is a must for all tourists who come from afar. Here you will experience the life and soul of a typical Chinese town in modern Singapore. You can get good Chinese food and visit the Chinese temples. This place comes alive during the Lunar New Year and also during the Mooncake Festival. The elderly folks come gather in the open courtyard to play Chinese chess and chit chat after a hard day's work. The Chinatown MRT station is nearby and this is the NE line which connects you to HarbourFront and Punggol.
,,Must Visit,4.0,,The hype is for real. There are quite a few food stall at Maxwell Hawker Centre that need to be visit. Most notable is the Hainan Chicken Tien Tien. Their competitor right across from them is great too. There's a congee place on the other side that is pretty damn good. Don't forget to visit the desert and drink place before you leave. Diagonally across the street is a very nice temple. Chinatown Singapore is great there is so much to see and try.
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Most major cities have a Chinatown....Singapore's is by far my favourite, even over NYC. Hustling, bustling with plenty of cheap sometimes tacky souvenirs to buy and great, cheap restaurants. Must see when you are here!"
,,Cleanest Chinatown ever..,5.0,,"I am from San Francisco and have visited China Towns in San Francisco, San Jose, Houston, L.A, Kuala Lumpur and other places and have never come across a more cleaner and friendlier China Town. Great place to pick up souvenirs. We shopped over there till we couldn't carry any more. You might think that all shops are the same but that's not true. Although most items are the same, we did find unique items and different prices at different shops. We went there several times and at first we would be amazed at the items offered in the first few stores at such an affordable price only to find them even cheaper once we had made our purchase. So on our most recent visit we made a point that if we liked something at one store, to walk around to see who else was selling that same item and for what price. Gave us a solid reason to explore most of china town. Very fun experience."
,,Well worth the visit!,5.0,,"An abundance of shops, and well worth the visit to stock up on any souvenirs. Lots of local food on sale, and very cheap. Would definitely go back."
,,Scenic china town,4.0,,"View from the entrance of the china town from MRT station is so beautiful.attractive Chinese red flags&lanterns decorate the roads near Chinese temple.There is the world's largest coin which is made up of rocky stone like structure near the heritage building.
Almost all the tiny streets are filled with 3 for 10 $ shops which includes Singapore souvenir items(key chains,shirts,mugs etc).
This place is very famous for tailors who are specialists in stitching wedding coats.
Wrist watches are so attrctive &lots of varieties are available here."
,,A must see ... great food.,5.0,,A must see ... great food. Definitely stop by one of the TCM shops to get an eyeful of the local medicine.
,,1day at Singapore,5.0,,"My husband and I had an 8 hr transit in Singapore. Rather than whittle away time at the airport ( which is amazing btw), we took a ride on the MRT to Chinatown. Am so glad we did, it was fantastic! Heaps of market stalls and traditional stores, selling everything from chopsticks to fine artwork. The restaurants were too expensive, so squeezed into McDonald's for lunch, spent 2 hours wandering around, then back on the train to airport. Plenty of time to spare, and so easy to access from airport, only $8.00 return p/p. plus there are people to help you out at the stations if you need."
,,Excellent Place To Spend One Full Evening,4.0,,"Nice; neat ;crowdie ;traditional place with Chinese style decoration in full street and shops ,cheap but good verity shopping good ; place to buy gifts in plenty for people back home ;nice restaurant to eat ; walk around full evening enjoying and mixing with happy crowds ;Indians tourists –Locals – tourists from other traditional countries ;happy and polite shop keepers who try to greet Indians in Hindi .Spend as much time of your evening as you have but will not get tired or bored .Only go in evening for maximum fun"
,,chinatown at singapore,5.0,,"the prices and the variety of small gifts and tokens that one can take for their friends and home .the souvenirs are very classy and can adorn my wall at home.the food court out there was very good.
prices very affordable.yet to see the temple there.Buddha temple"
,,Worth a visit - even just to people watch,5.0,,I LOVE CHINETOWN! The best food - lots of new things to try and share with family and friends. Stalls to buy keepsakes for home and family - remember you can barter!
,,Shopping Mecca,4.0,,"Definitely the place to shop, eat and drink. We found similar souvenirs to Thailand for less and the cheapest beer in Singapore."
,,Souvenirs,4.0,,The stores in Chinatown would open around 10-11 AM. This is a place where you can buy cheap souvenirs. Magnets. Keychains. Shirts. It is very easy to go to this place as it is directly linked to the MRT station.
,,Worth a visit!,5.0,,"China town is a very important part of Singapour and cant be missed. You could grab some local chinese food here (great dim sum!), do little souvenire shopping or just walk along the streets and make some memorable shots."
,,Great for shopping,5.0,,"Cheap stuffs (souvenirs, accessories n etc). I even bought a wallet for 4 SGD which is very cheap. You can find a lot of backpacker hostels here with some restaurants providing local food. Great for sight-seeing at night :) The shop owners are very friendly here."
,,Do not ever buy electronics in Chinatown,1.0,,"Especially cell phone store right by China Town MRT close to OG Store. They write the prices way cheaper than original and call it promotional prices but they will charge your credit card for warranty at prices 3 times the phone original price. I bought samsung galaxy s4 for 500 SGD and they charged 1500 SGD extra extra deducted over 3 years every month after making me sign fake warranty. Whatever it is just dont buy there, those singaporean seller will scam you, stole money from you credit card. Also dont ever buy from bargaining places like Lucky Plaza and Sim Lim. They will side track you and you will never know the quality of the goods you bought. Trust me"
,,Love it!,5.0,,"I love Singapore Chinatown, so much so that I went three times. The Hindu and Buddhist Temples are there and they are well worth a visit. The shopping, from the stalls to the indoor market is fab. I bought some souvenirs, trinkets etc, an embroidered top and an antique Chinese perfume bottle and a rucksack for my travels. There are some very interesting food shops where I bought some orange stuffed olives which are like sweets. This shop also sold dried everything, including what looked like dried poo bur was in fact sea cucumbers. They let me take some photos!

The place is awash with restaurants, take your pick. I ate at the 8 Treasures vegetarian restaurant (and gave it a poor review unfortunately) but I also stopped to have a coconut drink, straight out of the nut with a straw. The owner of this street eatery chatted with me and told me that the Thai cocoanuts are sweeter and nicer than the 'normal' ones...I tried both and he is right! Just watching the dining experience of others was fun too (I tried not to be intrusive but it was fascinating). There is a row of restaurants where people were given raw good and either pans with oil on a stove or boiling water on a stove and they cooked it as they went.

In the large central square on one of the occasions I went, there was a concert on, a older suited man belting out Asian songs, good fun."
,,Cheap eats and great shopping in Chinatown,4.0,,A definite must to visit and feel how old Singapore may have been. Love the temples and the street eating as well as finding bargains in the alley-ways.
,,Fun,4.0,,"Lots of the same to buy at the markets, but good to look around. Had a lovely lunch here, and enjoyed our visit."
,,The best deal to get souvenier,3.0,,"We purposely came here to look for souvenir and it was worth. We came back with 36pcs of key chains for SGD10 and cute rubber fridge magnets.During the visit, we found that somehow the place was smaller than expected. Maybe because we came on Tuesday night.

However, we enjoyed to look around in this place cause there were many cute items available."
,,Somewhere for day & night.,4.0,,We recently visited Chinatown in Singapore & were pleasantly surprised how nice it was. We found it clean with stall holders in the market very friendly. We recommend visiting any of the temples as they are a sight to see. Bright colours & very different to western places of worship. We also went back to Chinatown at night for dinner. The area was buzzing. Really busy & alive but you still felt safe. Had a great meal in one of the restaurants.
,,fun place to be...,5.0,,"We visited chinatown last October. Its a vibrant place with lots of shopping, eateries and culture. There were lots of roadside shops selling various sovenirs, clothes and things. Its one of the must visit place when visiting Singapore. The various eateries selling street food and other snacks were tasty and awesome. We visited in the evening and by the time we were done strolling through this area, it was already nighttime and we couldn't stay longer because of the kids. A nice place to be."
,,Very good,5.0,,China town is full of culture and lots of market stalls to buy almost anything. Great place to get some souvenirs for the friends and family back home. Feels a safe place compared to little India and has a lot more culture. Loved it.
,,Mix of cultures,4.0,,"This area has lots of bazaars with cheap similar item. Cheap souvenirs.
The most interesting is the mix of architectures: traditional small houses surrounded by modern buildings. It's a nice and very unique mix of cultures.
There is a small mall with good bakeries and fresh drinks."
,,Tours,5.0,,"We did two tours booked off the Qantas site - they picked us up from our hotel and took us so it was very simple to do. On the first one, we were taken to Chinatown at night and were given a quick tour of the market, then we were taken to a chinese restaurant for dim sum then on a trishaw tour through the streets of chinatown and then over to the river for a bumboat ride. ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS. After two weeks away and 3 countries, my kids still rate the trishaw tour as in their top 3 things we did while on holidays. It was so much fun.

The next day we went back to chinatown and did a walking tour - our guide was fabulous - he took us to a wedding shop, a medicine shop, a tea shop, a sweet shop, a funeral shop, the wet market, the hawker market - he explained all the traditions and customs associated. He went so far out of his was after the tour - he made sure we were able to get lunch and get into the Singapore flyer - gave us train maps and made sure we were ok. Far above the call of duty!"
,,Still good fun,5.0,,"Still fun at night for all great value food and shopping,singapore has cracked down on ""copies"" ,don't expect it the be like Bangkok for knock offs like bags and watches"
,,Average,3.0,,"We had come from Little India and then visited Chinatown. we were very surprised at the differences, Aggressive food stall owners.There were several souvenir stores that had nice shopkeepers and some nice items, at inexpensive prices. After that we went over to the Maxwell Street Hawker Center to eat instead."
,,Well worth a visit.,4.0,,Bustling lively and colourful. Packed with shops and restaurants. There are also numerous tailors who will offer to make you a bespoke shirt or suit in no time at all.
,,the place is much more than little shops owned by people of Chinese origin,4.0,,"With sprawling shops lined on the by-lanes to the west of North Bridge Road, the place is much more than little shops owned by people of Chinese origin. It gives you a glimpse of the lives and times of those people, chilling out with their cups of tea and back-to-back games of Xiangqi (Chinese Chess) in the shaded areas behind the Temple Road, Mosque Road and on the courtyard behind Buddha Tooth Relic Temple."
,,"Nice place to visit, with many shops, attractions, restaurants.",4.0,,"As the largest ethnic group in Singapore is Chinese, Chinatown is considerably less of an enclave than it once was. The district does retain significant historical and cultural significance.
The place has a lot of shops, restaurants, and houses are nices.

A definitive place to go.

For access, Chinatown has a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station, called the Chinatown MRT Station on the North East Line and the upcoming Downtown Line."
,,Eh- unimpressed,3.0,,"I was staying t a friends apartment in Chinatown and was just so unimpressed with everything about it. It was busy, loud, and people were not friendly. The only thing there was to do was eat."
,,Colourful atmosphere and sights,4.0,,"A nice, clean area full of the expected stalls, shops and eateries. Traditional old style buildings lovely to see. Easy to get to on MRT. Was pleased I took the time to wander through the area for an hour or two."
,,Cheap food & buys. Very clean. Pretty,5.0,,"Cleanest Chinatown I've ever seen. Still has that Chinatown charm though! Cheap food, local food market areas, cheap shopping, cheap souvenirs and jewelry stores. We had a great day roaming the streets there. I would highly recommend this area."
,,So far it is the most clean and well kept chinatown I ever visited.,5.0,,"Prior my trip to Singapore, I have visited New York, Boston, LA, SF, Vancouver, Thailand, London's chinatowns, but none of them capitvate me like the way Singapore did. The moment I stepped out from the MRT, there is this warm welcome feeling. Your eyes instantly drawn by those different era historical design architecture in such vibrant colors and the lanterns, those wooden shutter windows and balconies, the archy narrow pedestrain sidewalks with chinese lady paintings, I felt liked I have stepped right into a movie set! I also like that it is very clean.
Instead of shopping for tee shirts or ties, I had spent hours inside kitchen cookware shops, incase you like cookwares, there are few complete restaurant supplies stores down on Smith street (if I remember correctly) and the Chinatown food court is closed by as well. By the way, you do have to pay a very small fee (less than 10 cent, depends on if you need tissue or not?) to use the WC inside the food court."
,,Though commercial in nature...this is still ranked as one of Singapore's must see!,5.0,,"Good:
-Even at night, the streets are safe for you to walk.
-Many street shops offer you bargains.
-Ample eateries.
-Easy access to the Chinatown train station,
located at the basement.

Bad:
-Try not to bargain...that would be embarrassing!
-Hot weather.
-Hot weather may make you shorten your visit, or run to the nearest aircon place for cover!"
,,Same same but different,4.0,,"We always like to explore different places and culture. although China Town is a bit tacky as you would expect but it's still very nicely located in a old traditional part of town, good street food and a very good vibe. well worth the vist."
,,"Touristy, but worth a look",3.0,,"While interesting, Chinatown felt the most touristy of the market areas I visited. I had Brunch there my first day and didn't think the value and variety was worth it (I found another hawker centre in the area later that was much better), but it's one if those must visit places.
Just don't buy your souvenirs there! Their stalls had some of the higher prices I noticed,
Also, there is a fun wet market you can visit. It's decently large and has lots of variety, so I purchased some fruits and such to taste test later on. Fell in love with jackfruit...but not the durian.
So, stop in and have a look. Easy train or bus ride. You can visit the Buddhist temple, Hindu temple, and mosque all on one street if you are so inclined (and dressed properly). See the Street of the Dead or grab some food. Just know that you're paying a little extra :)"
,,Touristy but quite Charming,5.0,,"A lot of previous review have remarked on how ""sanitized"" Singapore's version of Chinatown is. I'm not sure what they were expecting in Singapore, but if anything this is one of the few places that still retains some down to earth charm about it when compared to the rest of the beautifully manicured city state. The rows of shophouses and lanterns strewn between them look especially pretty at night, and there are enough temples of different denominations to make this well worth a stop on a trip to Singapore.

For some real or authentic (ie dirtier) fare, take a short walk to the people's park complex shred yu can observe daily Singaporean life and have some cheap regional food at the food court. I was here on business, but if I do go back to Singapore with my wife I will definitely take her here."
,,Pleasant,3.0,,"Go when it is nearer to dusk so not so hot and more vibrant though some shops are closed. If you go during morning, you can see the lifestyle of people - still quite real."
,,What a place!,5.0,,"Packed full of hectic shopping, and a mass of friendly people, Chinatown is a must see in Singapore there is so much to see here, from shop to temples, restaurants to the busy streets - the vibrant colours really are something to be seen!"
,,Not what I was expecting,3.0,,"SIngapore's Chinatown is much more touristy than I thought it was going to be, especially around the Buddha Relic Tooth temple. I am sure there are some smaller off-the-beaten path restaurants and cafes that are worth checking out but overall my impression was just average.

It isn't a bad place and I am sure it will make it onto most people's lists of things to see in Singapore, but my recommendation is to check out the back streets and steer clear of the gift shops.

Very commercialized."
,,Chilled China,4.0,,"With sprawling shops lined on the by-lanes to the west of North Bridge Road, the place is much more than little shops owned by people of Chinese origin. It gives you a glimpse of the lives and times of those people, chilling out with their cups of tea and back-to-back games of Xiangqi (Chinese Chess) in the shaded areas behind the Temple Road, Mosque Road and on the courtyard behind Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. The Chinatown (market) Complex bustles with little shops with colourful diversified articles on the 1st Floor and hundreds of Food Stalls on the Second Floor. Come out of it and head left towards the by-lanes if you take interest in chinese garments, show pieces, wall hangings, chinese medicine, umbrellas, designer chop-sticks. Chinatown may also pose to be the best place to buy memorabilia for folks back home even if you take a tour of Chinatown on the first day of Visit in Singapore. On your way out Mariyamma Temple may catch your attention, being one of the oldest Hindu temples in Singapore. (Complete Tour Layout in other posts)"
,,Great fun!!!,3.0,,"Fair selection of stuff and reasonable prices, felt very safe and it was lots of fun. Usual fare, my wife and I got our names written in Chinese (coupled with some rather bad language) - great!"
,,Sad travesty of bygone days,1.0,,"My husband and I had visited Chinatown by day on our previous visit to Singapore 5 years ago, and despite finding it. Very commercialised, had fun there and so took our family back there at night on this trip.

While reluctant to harm the prospects of the good shop-folk there, I have to caution prospective visitors to lower their expectations considerably if they are not to be severely disappointed.

There is now precious little charm and nothing more than a series of shops with the same '3 for $10' type of souvenirs, jewellery, hair accessories etc.

Having said that, I bought 3 cute necklaces which I have been wearing with pleasure, so let's not be snobbish about this :-). Just don't expect to discover gorgeous crafts and antiquities etc.

The couple of bars and restaurants were well patronised and everyone appeared to be enjoying themselves.

We were also advised to visit the People's Park shopping centre next door. Didn't have time that night, but my hubby and brother returned a couple of days later - it is up the steps from the MRT (Chinatown subway) so all in all its pbly still worth a visit, especially if you continue straight up the street from the MRT exit/entry into Chinatown and visit the Indian temple, utterly fascinating (we did this last time).

All in all, if you are short of time, you can safely give this a miss. It is nothing like the colourful maelstrom of bargains you will find in Kuala Lumpur's Chinatown, or Hong Kong's Ladies and Temple Street markets. However, if you have some time to kill, jump on the MTR and enjoy a Tiger beer there for an hour or so. Don't waste your money on a tour!!"
,,Meh,2.0,,"If you need to get away from the concrete canyons this is one option though not a great one. It's far too small, touristic, and sanitized to be of interest.

Perhaps I'm overlooking something. However I suggest that There are lots of other ways to spend your time."
,,average,3.0,,"As with other reviewers, I have to say it's all very ho hum. If you've been to one Chinatown you can safely say you don't need to go to others unless there is something specific you want to get. Same cheap stuff and street food as others. I went at night to fill in some hours before my flight, and expect it is probably better then due to lighting and the different atmosphere that night brings to any place."
,,Great place for cheap souvenirs,5.0,,First time to SIN and Chinatown. We found a great Thai restaurant which used to be an opium den. There are hundreds of stalls which sell everything you could think of. The area is beautiful with lanterns everywhere. People are nice although some areas I would feel a bit dodgy if I was alone. It's easy to access by MRT and you can spend a day wandering about. I loved it.
,,Not a priority....,3.0,,It may seem strange to have a Chinatown in the middle of a country that is 75% ethnic Chinese but Singapore does have one. You can reach it on the MRT (Chinatown MRT station). If can find cheap souvenirs here on the pedestrian street and there is a really nice temple there. Walk around a few of the streets but there isn't too much to see. I think it shows better in the nighttime. No need to spend a lot of time here....
,,Like any other Chinatown,4.0,,"I agree with the other reviewers here, this place is just like any other chinatown in other countries. Went here last year with a friend, had a good taste of the street food offered here. Went to shop for some souvenir items here, which were cheap. Place is okay, and is a good place to visit if you have a lot of time in SG."
,,just like another chinatown,4.0,,"yap, just like another chinatown around the world. you can find cheap street food, cheap accommodation, and the chines shop everywhere"
,,Worth two visits,4.0,,"First come for the food then come for the shopping. Chinatown is just a melting pot of smells, aromas and some of the best that Singapore has to offer. Make sure you go upstairs to the huge hawkers market. Meals range from S$3 to S$5."
,,Loved Chinatown - worth a visit,4.0,,"We went to Chinatown to see the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple - but really enjoyed walking around looking at the streets and architecture - definitely worth a visit if you have the time - otherwise you can get a flavour of it from the hop-on, hop-off bus which goes through some of it."
,,Chinatown Singapore as a Complete Place,4.0,,"Chinatown is identic with china culture. Chinatown means cheap souvenir, great food and religion tolerantion.

If you want to get many souvenir with cheap price, this place is really recomended. You can buy little souvenir started from 1 dolar. Then you can get discount if buy with big quantity. It's really interesting !

For culinary lover, you can eat great food in all street. In the afternoon, the street is really busy and the light make this place look perfect.

For moeslem or indian, chinatown have good place to pray. I visited one mosque in Chinatown. In the other side I can find a place with many indian people with pray activity.

It's really recomended place."
,,Old Chinatown,3.0,,"Nothing change much here since i dont know when.... the streets are the same and the sellers will line their items along the streets. Good place to go to soak in the atmosphere, especially during the chinese new year period. A must visit for foreigners."
,,chinatown has changed,3.0,,"I have been to Chinatown many time in the recent years but this time found it changed, not as friendly as before but at one of the stalls was quite frightened by the antics of the husband of the owner. I was trying to buy a dressing gown for my Son and in trying to make up my mind was accosted by the husband who tried to Bully me, so I just kept walking, the wife and son just stood by."
,,China Town,5.0,,I remember all of those electronics we bought for very cheap - we still have our electronic photo frame from Singapore - china town!! And the blue taxis were the cheapest!
,,Very interesting Chinatown,4.0,,"The fair itself and its shops may seem a little touristy, but the interesting part of this Chinatown is that waling around it will allow you to visit so many landmarks (temples, heritage center, etc.) that it is a neighborhood not to be missed."
,,Typical Chinatown,3.0,,"Chinatown Singapore is typical of Chinatowns everywhere – crowded, bustling stalls/shops, lots of cheap goods and Chinese food supplies. Many restaurants although quality of food dubious. There are also some conventional shops and department stores on the main roads which sell good quality items at very low prices.
If you are after gold jewelry at competitive prices go to the People’s Park Complex, just behind the MRT station entrance on Eu Tong Sen Street. There are a dozen or so stores there selling good quality gold/diamond jewelry at good prices – authorized traders, so reliable and fair."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"Chinatown is the slightly older part of town, where not too many tall buildings have cropped up. Chinatown is quite an interesting place to spend several hours, strolling around and combining it with buying cheap souvenirs and trying close to authentic chinese meal."
,,Need to shop? Hop here.,3.0,,"There are so many things you can buy here in Chinatown from cents to a couple of dollars. Souvenir items here are relatively cheap compare to malls and other shopping center. Rich in culture, Singapore souvenirs, food stall, and many more."
,,Great,5.0,,"Chinatown is great to visit to get some different food. Take your time to walk around Chinatown area. There are lots of shopping to do, not to mention food, and more food. The district is small, mainly one tourist-friendly pedestrian street."
,,Definitely a Chinese fantasy for foreigners!,4.0,,"For people from Asia or chinese culture country, this place might not be ""authentic"" enough for you. But for foreigners who are curious about traditional chinese cuzine, architecture or people, this place won't let you down.
Along the Pragoda street, you may but the Singapore style souvenir with a really good price! If you want to find some good dishes to enjoy, just head to Smith street for everything you want.
Don't for get to visit the Sri Mariamman, an India temple, which will make your little trip more inspiring!
It may take 1-2 hours to hang around the area, just take the SMRT purple line to the chinatown station and start your chinese experience!"
,,Good attraction,4.0,,"A very good tourist attraction spot. Plenty of singaporean and chinese souvenirs, clothes, gift items to buy. Variety of restaurants too. Walking distance to MRT station is a plus point. Dont worry if you don't have enough singapore dollars, this place has Money exchangers too. Finding parking could be troublesome."
,,Interesting,4.0,,A great snap shop of life. Good food and cheap tiger beer. A good place to find trinkets to take home. Buy furthest in where cheaper. The migration museum is fascinating and tells how tough life really was and not too long ago either.
,,"Great mix of history, culture, food and souvenir shopping",4.0,,"This is one of the iconic neighborhoods of Singapore. I recommend taking time to slowly wander the streets for a few hours. Go hungry, there's lots to eat and drink. For an authentic experience, navigate your way from the tchotchke shops and head to ""Chinatown Complex"". On the bottom floor, there is a fantastic wet market where you can find all kinds of tropical culinary treasures that Southeast Asia has to offer."
,,Fabulous food & interesting browsing,4.0,,"We really enjoyed the food at the stalls on the upper floors. The food was varied, generally delicious and very cheap. Fresh sugarcane juice, roast duck & pork with rice, noodle dishes and much more. The lowest level had a wide variety of fresh foods and would be worth a visit if you are cooking during your stay. Most of the other stalls had similar fare for sale, with a lot of cheap clothing, ornaments etc. We did find a good stall of lingerie which came in handy as we had under packed. I was surprised at how good the quality of the underclothes were and wish now I had bought more to bring home. Toilets were clean and well maintained which was a nice bonus, after so much fresh juice."
,,See how others live,5.0,,"China town Singapore is a place that is for the local Chinese population. Here you can buy the real deal in food, medicine and services all with a Chinese tilt.
It’s a crowded place but fascinating with brightly coloured items swaying in the breeze outside the shops.
I never felt hassled as I walked along and most people seemed indifferent to my being there which I liked.
Guided tours are available and are bookable from many of the hotels in Singapore."
,,"Conned at people's park complex Chinatown ""mobile 888 LTD""",1.0,,"We went to the PEOPLES PARK CANTRE chinatown in hopes of purchasing an ipad mini and an i phone 5. To cut a long story short our credit cards were cloned and maxed out (6478sgd) by the mobile 888 ltd store. They asked for a credit card to verify the purchase as only 2 items per credit card was allowed they said, they also said no money would be taken out and we paid for items cash. When asked for a receipt they replied that as this was a tax free store if we were issued a receipt we could claim tax back at airport.

My advice is follow your instincts and keep your wits about you, if it seems to good to be true it usually is. The people who served us said their names were TEDDY AND SUNNY and seemed so genuine, looking back now I can see alarms bells being raised.

To make matters worse our bank said without a receipt of cash payment they cannot investigate and we are liable for the payment.

Stay away!!!!! Don't be lured in!

Regret this big time.. As I type this from my iPad :/

Apart from this, china town is nice place to look around too bad that experience was ruined by this one"
,,Brash and touristy,3.0,,If you can visit early morning for a wander around ... and try not to be pulled in by the traders. There's a great food hall on seneral floors.
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"So much to see and do! There's plenty here to keep any bargain hunting shopper busy for hours and hours. We visited on several occasions over our seven day stay and thoroughly enjoyed the ambience, our massage and the brilliant food."
,,Great eats on the street,4.0,,"I go to Chinatown Singapore every time I visit Singapore. My favorite is Singaporean Chicken Rice, sate and Tiger Beer. It makes me happy. Cheers!!"
,,"Bah. Average, touristy, yet great pagoda",3.0,,"The highlight here is the beautiful pagoda with a Buddha tooth in a gold reliquary and a very nice and free museum. The rest is a mix of tourist traps, stench, good food, cheap clothes. There is a minute yet great tea shop called Kokotea in the back of the China Complex (left hand side). Great for pu-erh tea."
,,Drink it all in,5.0,,"The sights, sounds and smells of this must see attraction are worthy of praise. A must see attraction on any Singapore itinerary."
,,Love Singapore- Beware China Town,3.0,,We love Singapore and have felt very safe there on previous visits but this time have really been ripped off at Amazon camera shop in China Town. Spoilt a lovely holiday for us.
,,love chinatown....full of cheap stuff but also great food,4.0,,"Chinatown is great to visit to get some different food, make sure you walk through and look properly u can find some beautiful items in amongst the junk"
,,Singapore's Chinatown is unique if you know what to look for!,4.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is a popular place to visit when in city. Some consider it too clean, tidy and polished. This may be true, if you are looking for a more classic, Chinatown experience. However, it is an easy and accessible place to visit and spend time in Singapore and there is some nice attractions to see there.

The first thing we like about Chinatown is that it is not 100% Chinese but has other important cultural attractions. On South Bridge Street, you can visit Jamae Mosque, the Sri Marimman (Hindu) Temple, which almost right next to the Chinese temple by the name of Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum. This multi-cultural aspect of Singapore's Chinatown is very unique! The Sri Marimman and Buddha Tooth Relic Temples, in particular, are both very good attractions, two of our personal favorites in all of Singapore and are well worth making time to visit when in Chinatown. We'd suggest allocating 30 minutes for Sri Marimman and 45-60 minutes for the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, depending on how interested you are in seeing the museum located there as well.

Shopping is another fun activity in Chinatown. You can walk down Pagoda and Temple streets in particular and see the traditional street market scene. Again, it is very tidy, clean and well managed, much more so than even our better street markets in Hong Kong. The buildings in the market area are well painted and make for a nice environment. There is a popular Chinatown Heritage Tour that you can follow. Maps can be downloaded from the helpful Your Singapore website or they can be found in quite a few locations around Chinatown, including the Chinatown Information Center behind the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and at the China Heritage Center on Pagoda Street.

Dining is another good reason to visit Chinatown. All manner of Chinese food can be found here from Hainanese, Sichuan, Cantonese and locally inspired dishes like black carrot cake and the ever popular toast breakfasts. In addition to the numerous traditional restaurants in the area, there is a large area setup for street side dining on what is called Food Street. Prices are generally higher here and many complain that quality is sometimes lower but it can be a fun experience. If you want to dine with the locals, two other popular options are the Maxwell Food Court and the Chinatown Complex where you can find the traditional hawker and stall food centers, cheap and good eats! Specialty foods round out the dining experiences in Chinatown. Our personal favorite is Bee Cheng Hiang and the succulent Bakkwa that is just so delicious.

Overall, Chinatown is a nice place to spend a few hours when visiting Singapore. It is an easy and comfortable visit and a nice look at probably the cleanest, tidiest version of a Chinatown you might ever see.

Tip: We recommend to start visits there in the early afternoon so that you can visit the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum before they close. You can then spend time in the nearby Sri Marimman Temple which stays open quite late. The street markets are much cooler after dark and Food Street and other dining areas are more active, providing you to see what Chinatown looks like during its busy time."
,,Beautiful district,4.0,,"If you travel to singapore and want to avoid the urban part with big building.
Go for a walk at Chinatown it's a popular area for tourist.
You can visit Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, Chinatown Heritage Centre or Sri Mariamman Temple and lot of things like shops.

Remember to go to Maxwell Centre for eating."
,,Yet another Chinatown,2.0,,"There are cheap souvenirs (like other Chinatowns) and the Tin Tin shop is close by, but honestly it was like all the Chinatowns I've been in in Australia. Not really a must see."
,,Pretty but kitschy,4.0,,Good food and nice to see some old traditional buildings. Most of the markets seemed to be selling the same Chinese mass produced junk.
,,'Cleanest' Chinatown I've Ever Seen,3.0,,"This Chinatown is reflecting the city of Singapore: very clean. The district is small, mainly one tourist-friendly pedestrian street. It's definitely not a must-see if you are like me used to what to expect from a Chinatown in any major city; unless a big event such as Chinese New year is ongoing at the time you're there. The Sri Marriamman Temple is just around the corner, and this is a gorgeous Hindu temple you don't want to miss, so just combine both!"
,,"Chinatown, Singapore",4.0,,"Our last day in Asia we went to Chinatown. We were there about a week before the Lunar new year so it was decorated to the hilt. Red paper lanterns everywhere and the stalls were full of decorations and souvenirs.
We had lunch in the Hawker market with the requisite Tiger beer (huge bottles, meant for sharing) and had the absolute best pork dumplings I have ever tasted. The kids were a little freaked out by my fish and noodle soup and stuck with pretty bland stuff.
After that we walked all over, shopped a little (bought umbrellas! was a tad rainy) and just enjoyed the sights.
If you venture into the shops you can find some beautiful jewelry (we bought some jade for friends back home) and there are lots of odds and ends in the street stalls.
A really fun way to spend a day before you head back home to North America."
,,"Cheap shopping, but cleaner than other Chinatowns that I have visited",4.0,,Cheap shopping for mid level quality goods. Crowded but very clean. Fixed prices reduce the scope for bargaining.
,,For the Tourists,4.0,,Plenty of hawker stalls selling a variety of foods as well as the usual tourist souveneirs - mostly lower level tat though. Well worth a visit for the experience.
,,Mid Autumn Festival - Beautiful!,5.0,,"The Chinese people in Singapore celebrate the Mid Autumn Festival on the 15th day of the eighth Chinese Lunar month. This festival is also known as the Moon Cake or Lantern Festival.

According to Chinese legend, the Mid Autumn Festival celebrates Chang’e who was the wife of a terrible ruler; she drank the elixir of immortality to put an end to her husband’s evil ways. So this is a time for many people to go home to their families and celebrate.

Our last visit to Singapore we were lucky enough to be there during this festival. Chinatown and the surrounding streets are decorated and lit up like fairyland with fantastic lantern displays and all the shops and markets are selling beautifully decorated Moon Cakes.

The cakes now come in so many different flavors, I remember years ago I bought a traditional one in Hong Kong and did not like it at all, but now there are chocolate flavored ones and even ice cream Moon Cakes.

There is so much to see and do during this time with performances of traditional dances, puppetry and operas and admission is free so it is a very noisy and busy time around Chinatown.

On the last night of the Festival there were thousands and thousands of people in Chinatown watching shows and then the finale – a spectacular fireworks display.

It was a great time to be in Singapore."
,,"Authentic, fun",4.0,,A must see ... great food. Definitely stop by one of the TCM shops to get an eyeful of the local medicine.
,,Hetic,2.0,,"I thought that china town was a real tourist trap, highly over priced and not authentic. Was dirty and smelly and you were hassled by the shop keepers wouldnt rush back"
,,Great for cheap shopping and sight seeing,4.0,,Spare one or two hours to have a walk here. You will find great deals and you can find anything you want.
,,night glory of China town,3.0,,"Came to China town at the night was pleasant. At that moment the Chinese new year celebration was not ending yet. Some of accessories about Imlek still leavings that can seen above along the street China town. Lots of red lampoons were hung off above the street made glory of atmosphere China town. It's fantastics view at night can seen along the street.
For travelers who need get Singapore souvenirs, here is the right place to visit. Many kind of souvenirs can found and price not so expensive. The street site crowded many tourists for sightseeing in the night glory of China town."
,,Full of Buzz,5.0,,They have started to do up China town and its looking great. The markets are wonderful and heaps of variety and prices. Restaurants are aplenty so you won't starve! The Temple is amaising!
,,"Beautiful buildings, delicious cuisine",4.0,,"Definitely worth a visit. It is especially beautiful at night, with lots of lanterns lighting up the authentic Chinese buildings. The market stalls are fun to look around. Grab a bite to eat, the food is delicious!"
,,Chinatown Chinatown,3.0,,Pleasant place to wander around and see the same goods being sold everywhere. Look up at the buildings fir some different architecture. Not the cheapest place to eat fir budget backpacker and just s short walk away will find better local type restaurant.
,,"Bustling, noisy and fun",4.0,,"Loved this place. Great food at the Hawker Centre, multiple shops, great little booth where you can put your feet and hands into tanks full of little fish, who ticklishly nibble at you.If you like noise and bustle and really want to feel like a stranger in a strange land (we visited from Australia) then this is the place."
,,grimy destination with no real touristic value,2.0,,"The Chinatown in Singapore was actually kind of a letdown. With so many Asian and Chinese influences in food and culture and history, I made a point to go to the Chinatown here, especially since it was within walking distance of downtown Singapore. When I got there though, I was rather disappointed. As opposed to the rest of Singapore that is well-kept and enjoyable to walk through, the Chinatown was kind of a dump, with some parts bordering on a slum. Small shops and grimy miss were everywhere.

As opposed to the Chinatown in America and other countries, I was let down. I didn't even bother saying you're too long, because there's actually nothing of touristic value to see there. It's not a bustling destination like the Chinatown in San Francisco for instance, so I think it's just somewhat of a tourist trap. I can't say I recommend making Chinatown a destination, since it's lost its old-world charm long ago."
,,A must visit place for Foreign Travelers,4.0,,"You may find the china culture and local foods when visiting chinatown. Especially during chinese new year season (normally is in Jan - Feb), the stalls will full of Chinese celebration food for purchase, this is the good time you visit China Town."
,,Just another chinatown,3.0,,Have been to chinatown in many different countries and think this one was nothing special. Lots of junk/souvenir places to buy. Good access from metro.
,,Don't miss the chance to get in Chinatown.,4.0,,"In correspondence with the Chinatown MRT station, I think is the most beautiful Chinese quarter of all the cities I've visited so far.
Very extensive, it is not only the market but much more, but the most interesting thing about this neighborhood is its folk market, an intersection of roads, these everyday are invaded by tourists, between a stand and the other you can find everything, from clothing to electronic items and much much more ... a place I feel very nice and definitely worth visiting."
,,Fascinating area!,4.0,,"We enjoyed wandering around Chinatown and just soaking up the atmosphere of the market stalls, buying some lovely silk scarves en route. We discovered a priceless corner which was basically a ""Seniors'"" playground, with an exercise bike, seats to rest in, etc, and a sign which said ""No sleeping / No urine""!! We sadly didn't have the time to go to the Heritage Museum, which looked so interesting. We visited a beautifully decorated Hindu Temple, within Chinatown, and, as we happened to be there during a festival, were able to watch some of the rituals, and see people of all ages, including tiny children, enjoy what was clearly an important family event."
,,Cheap souvenirs and stuff,3.0,,"Went here by night. Really affordable souvenirs such as keychains (2SGD for 6 pieces), stuffed toys (3 for $10), displays and such. Also has cheap shirts and caps, the quality is not that good though. But we found really good neckties @ 2 for $10!"
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,"During our recent trip to Singapore we visited Chinatown, from my previous visits to Singapore over the last 40+ years Chinatown has developed in to a very pleasant Tourist Attraction. Bright, colourful with all the noise and ""aromas"" one would expect from such a place. We found the stallholders friendly and enjoyed great banter with them as we haggled for our usual trinkets to take home. Prices were reasonable in the cafes and the Tiger Beer was delicious and cold!"
,,Tourist junk trap,1.0,,"I found the shopkeepers not friendly and very pushy. Having visited CT Bangkok, CT Shanghai, CT Penang, there is very little resemblance.
The products here in CT Singapore are the absolute lowest quality, and quite highly priced. I quite frankly went away disappointed. My advice is there are plenty of other wonderful things to see in Singapore that you would have good memories of."
,,Super,5.0,,"Don't forget this area. It takes 5mn by walking but the atmosphere is excellent, take the time for a diner, in the street. it is very good, very cheap if you like to be in the local atmosphere far of the ""customer's side of Singapore"", you have ot go there."
,,buy 3 for $10,5.0,,I loved the people the atmosphere and the bargins. It is easy to get to. It is clean but there wasn't to many food street venders to get teh unique Asian mardet atmoshere but the food is good and reasonable but not bargin cheap
,,For an ethnic feel of Singapore,4.0,,"Chinatown is the slightly older part of town, where not too many tall buildings have cropped up.
The heritage centre is apparently interesting for history lovers, but i'm not one, so we didnt pay a visit to this place.
We did go to the mariamma temple which is a tamil temple of hindu deities.
There is also the buddha relic temple nearby which was very sacrosanct and gives you a very pious feeling to be inside. So well made and gives you a sense of deep peace, i really liked it a lot.
Not far away, we visited a place called the tea chapter, which serves up a variety of tea in a pot. The setting is brillliant, and you sit on wooden stools in a wooden building, which makes you feel like you are in some other place, away from the hustle-bustle of the city.
It's a good way to spend a couple of hours and maybe try some street food."
,,Nice Temples and all your Trinket needs,3.0,,Nice contrast in architecture from the skyscrapers surrounding. There is a tourist information center on Sago Street which is the southern end of China Town who are very helpful. Looking for a laundry there is a self service one here on Sago Lane
,,Average over the years,3.0,,"If you're visiting China Town on any day of the year except for Chinese New Year Periods (Jan to Feb) usually, i think its an average place, not much ""LIFE"" and even the street of hawkers that sell local food, their business seem much quieter than years ago. Not many are opened as well. Food is much pricer too. Would recommend East Coast Lagoon or Gluttons by the Bay (Beside Esplanade). The former has a wider range of food at better prices!"
,,Chinatown in Singapore,4.0,,"Best time to visit is during the lunar or Chinese New Year, when you would be able to buy and eat lots of good food and goods.

During other time of the year, you can have a walk around, eat at the local food or the korean restaurant at the Mosque street, one street apart from the MRT station only."
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"Although Singapore is mostly populated by Chinese, Chinatown is worth a visit because the authorities have made an attempt to preserve some of the old buildings which gives an historical flavor to this area. The Chinese Heritage Museum, located in Pagoda St is a great place to visit first because it will give perspective to what you're seeing. A Buddhist and Hindu temple and Mosque are located in one street. All are worth looking at and their location gives a great sense of tolerance to Singapore. Great markets, both day and night are worth a look but I wouldn't eat in the most touristy streets. Go a couple of streets back or across the main road and eat somewhere that is full of locals. That way you get to eat not only wonderful Chinese food very cheaply but you can experience some great nonya food as well. Don't forget to try chendol a coconut ice dessert, or ice kechang . They are both very refreshing in the humid Singapore weather. If visiting at Chinese New Year, Chinatown is an absolute must, vibrant decorations adorn every street and the sounds of Lion Dancing fill the air. Definitely worth a visit."
,,The discrict has its charm! Don't miss sri mariamman Temple!,4.0,,"Chinatown is quite an interesting place to spend several hours, strolling around and combining it with buying cheap souvenirs and trying close to authentic chinese meal. The disctrict is just 1 min away from the same-name MRT station. There are lots of cafes with good and cheap meal, stalls with souvenirs and clothing. The architecture of the area is interesting and very different from other parts of the city. It still keeps the flavour of old Singapore. The area has its sharm. Don't miss an astonishing hindu temple Sri Mariamman which is the oldest temple in Singapore. It is richly decorated with bright ornaments and statues of the hundu godds. It is worth getting inside. The combination of the statues and skyscrapers on the background is remarkable!"
,,One of the best,4.0,,"I really enjoyed visiting China town - the heritage buildings, markets etc were worth the visit. I can't say that I was tempted to buy anything from the market stalls but it was enjoyable being there particularly as it wasn't that busy. Make the time to visit the Indian temple and the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple (air conditioned!)."
,,Chinatown is a frequent haunt for me,5.0,,"Take your time to walk around Chinatown area. There are lots of shopping to do, not to mention food, and more food! And if the heat and humidity gets to you, just pop into any of the air-conditioned shopping malls. The latest, revamped malls like Chinatown Point is really worth taking a look. People's Park Centre, which is across Chinatown, is my frequent haunt because I do a huge amount of crafting and sewing and that is the place where I get all my stuff. Chinatown is the place to watch the elderly spend their time at their familiar place with familiar friends."
,,"Gaudy, busy and interesting",4.0,,We wandered through during an afternoon. The place wasn't exceptionally busy. The architecture interested me more than the myriad stalls and everywhere the smell of joss sticks. Poke around a bit and enjoy the experience!
,,well worth the time to visit,4.0,,"While the side streets are full of brightly coloured clothing & cheap knick-knacks, the shopping mall is full of cheap gadgets & top brand items.
If you have come this far you may as well go into the Raffles hotel long bar for a Singapore sling as this is supposedly where it originated from though beware £15 a time!"
,,Interest to go,4.0,,"Interest to spend a half day there for dine and shops. Easy access to take MRT-drop there. Very famous, food market with local stir-fried noodles, chicken rice, satay, black pepper crabs...dessert...many many. Recommend!"
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"Loved walking around chinatown. We caught the MRT to chinatown station and walked around. Found lots of little stores that sold nice souvenirs very cheap especially compared to the rest of singapore. Stayed for lunch and had bbq pork which was good. Beers at hawker stalls also only $5-$6 for long neck.
We found a really lovely bakery that sold lots of nice sweets for $1. Delicious!"
,,A slice of China,4.0,,This was a vibrant place to visit and reminded us of our trip to China two years ago. Well worth a visit & easy to find. We travelled here by MRT.
,,Very good.,4.0,,But it is a bother to me that many vendors have the same products. I used to walk through it on every visit but now only go when hungry or on special events. If you have never been to a China town the n for sure check out out. If you have then its about what you would expect.
,,China Town,2.0,,"China Town is just an other China town. If you have China town in your city, is gonna be the same, for me is just a poor dirty place with some nice things, but not much to say about it."
,,To go for real Chinese food,4.0,,"Well, I know elsewhere in Singapore, you could easily find chinese food. However, here in Chinatown is like a 'concentration' place where you could find most within the area. Avoid visiting the restaurants on the main street/ close to MRT station (more pricey), try to visit some restaurants on Upper Cross Street, Eu Tong Sen Street etc, they are also local style but slightly cheaper, most importantly - not only serving the tourists

We visited Chinatown twice for food hunting. We bumped into two different styles of Chinese restaurants, we had nice experience with spicy and strong flavor cuisine. We loved it and would still consider to return from time to time.

It is nice to visit here with friends for food hunting, so you could try more type of Chinese foods with a reasonable price :)"
,,Dont be scared to wander,4.0,,"There are some great bargains to be had here- IF U Look!!

Peoples place is a great place to begin and go to all levels - I brought a great canvas messenger bag which the vendor reduced to a very reasonable price before i even attempted to barter!I had been looking all thru singapore for something like this but was getting annoyed wth the incredible price tags at the major centres for products of a lesser quality!

The markets are then accessible via the overhead walkway and here you can get prices very similar to Phuket and Bali if not cheaper."
,,A Photogenic & Colourful Visual Treat !,4.0,,"I started the walk from Smith Street shopping area and it was awesome time . They host exotic food stalls along . you can get frofs to eat here . i didnt taste it as i am veg . Many tea shops were found in old historical houses . It was a good experience overall .

One must not miss the Pagoda Street . All authentic chinese shops here . Aa it was post CNY time the discounts and SALE were on .

It was colourdul treat to the eyes . Red , Yellow , Saffron .... All colours were covering the entire area .

One must not miss the Chinatown Heritage Center on this street .

The oldeat Hindu Temple , Sri Mariman Temple is worth visiting , they charge for camera usage . Exactly opposite this temple there Re awesone bars to unwind .

And the cultural monument which i visited last was Buddha Tooth Relic Temple . Its a pleasant , serene & tranquil place to be at . Absolute majestic and impressive . The holy relic tooth of Buddha is kept in the temple . You can see 1000 Buddha's statue . This is a must bisit place . And they dont charge for camera & you needn't remove your footwear .

I will highky recimmend this tour in morning 0800-1200hrs slot ."
,,Singapore's Chinatown,4.0,,"We were fortunate to be in Singapore in time for the Chinese New Year & seemingly, it was one of the few places where businesses remained open & lively with lots of people while the rest of SIngapore was the opposite,being a holiday.We witnessed the new year countdown & the dazzling
fireworks display which greatly added to the festive mood. It was a good opportunity to shop till you drop literally since businesses will close for 3 days for the new year & we had no other time to
shop later because it is here in Chinatown where you can buy a variety of dry goods, souvenirs & food items at a bargain. However, one should be careful & vigilant because there are also some bad elements who will take advantage of the crowd & the chaos,like pickpockets,etc."
,,small but nice,4.0,,"It is commercial here but also a nice places to visit. The building here is very maintain and remember to visit the small Buddhism temple in the area. Several good restaurant in the area. Most shops are for turist her, but as long you know it it is no problem."
,,Do not waste your time,3.0,,"Singapore itself is a big China town so why you need to go there.
Chinatowns in San Francisco, New york, L.A., Yokohama, Kobe etc would be better as it is different from surrounding areas. if you have time to kill, then please go.Only one good point is that there is an Indian temple as well there similar to those in Little India so it may be good to visit China Town to feel China and India instead of visiting both places.Taking this opportunity I would like to mention so called ''Arab Street.'' There are Malay people in Singapore who believes in Muslim and that is why Mosques are there and has nothing to do with Arab. The street name should be changed into Muslim Street."
,,Chinese new year is the best time to visit..,4.0,,Chinese new year is the best time to visit..As the entire area is very well decorated and super barganing can be done here.. It can be easily reached by MRT or bus or Taxi. One can buy cheap souvenirs.. nice eating joints. small but nice street shops.
,,"Busy, crowded -- and fun!",4.0,,"Besides walking around and taking in the busting environment, Chinatown is filled with photo ops, great food ( delicious Dim Sum and desserts plus much more ) and good shopping.

The Chinatown Heritage Center , Buddha Tooth Relic Temple , Kreta Ayer district, Chinatown Center , several Buddhist, Hindu and Muslim places of worship and Medical Halls are all worth a visit.

As for shopping, there are good places for Chinese tea, tea paraphernalia, hand embroidered linen, Chinese porcelain and antiques ( including the famous Yue Hwa store on New Bridge Road). Plenty of cheap souvenirs too.

There has been a genuine attempt to preserve Chinatown , its old ways and architecture.

Take time to walk around -- and discover life as it was in the old days. Chinese New Year is a time when the area is at its liveliest -- I personally prefer a quieter time of year, when I could keep my own pace."
,,Buzzing with shoppers for the upcoming Chinese New Year,4.0,,"Colorful area, the temple is awesome....must visit inside. The red and gold ambience is really regal"
,,Ripped off,1.0,,Warning dont buy in Chinatown they start by converting currency and find product you know little about once they know they have you the price changes upwards using currency conversion before you realise you get a offer of a discount and like a mug you jump at it a $700 dollar camera with a recommended retail of $299 if this protects one other person I will be happy.
,,Melting pot,5.0,,"Easy to reach, lots of good and great food, lots of cheap souvenirs (if that's your thing). The place is just bustling with life. A very big selection of food variety are on offer, from delicious german sausage to Gong-gong clams. And there's a Tintin Shop here. Being a Tintin fan, this is a major plus side."
,,souvenirs for you,4.0,,"just outside mrt station there's a mall that you can find variety souvenirs including key chain,watch etc with quite low prices and don't forget you to taste chinese food there's plenty in here."
,,Easy to access,5.0,,"We joined the Chinese New Year celebrations and made the experience that even when really crowded it is still easy to get around. We had only the evening which is not enough, you should at least plan 3-4 hours"
,,China Town - Street Food,3.0,,"China Town is a very good place, as Little India, to spend a whole day, walking arround. It’s also a very good place to look for a hotel. Everything is very safe and clean, so ... as in this part of Singapore the streets are little and everything is near, you can find everything you nead for have a nice time. Many chinese shops and interestings antiques shops and the most nice Hindu temple and many many medical shops. Chinatown near Singapore River, was the heart of the city's trading activity in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Restoration traditional shop-houses, full of colour, yellows, pinks, blues, greens. Shops of souveniers, antiques along Pagoda and Trengganu Street.
It`s pretty clean by `World Chinatown` standards, but definitely a Singapore experience not to be missed. The sights and scents of China are unmistakeable as you wander the streets here. There are tea houses, grocery stores, enthusiastic vendors, restaurants and endless trinket shops. `$4 each or 3 for $10` is the most common sign you will see in Chinatown shopfronts. It is certainly one of the cheapest places to buy Singapore souvenirs, and bargaining is acceptable."
,,Cheap and Best,5.0,,"This place is perfect for all de tiny miny shopping lists ur wife gives u .... Cheap , Reasonable , very good to bargain . Must visit for all ......"
,,Fun for Year of the Snake,5.0,,"Chinatown is always decked out in RED during CNY and the build up to Year of the Snake is no exception. Lots of fun stalls with decorations, snacks, etc."
,,Do your homework before you go for more enjoyment,5.0,,"At first glance it is just another Chinatown, which.. don't get me wrong.. I love Chinatowns all over the world! And it is the Singaporean version so reasonably clean and organised! Which if anything was a little of a disappointment. It is really easy to get to on the MRT. The Chinatown MRT stop lets you off straight into Pagoda street and you can walk through the shops with all the Chinese 'stuff' - plus a Tin Tin store.. which is strange but makes it unique from other Chinatowns I have visited.

I say do your homework because there are numerous side streets, hawker markets (e.g Maxwell rd), the wet market (plus hawker market above), cheap massage & haircuts in the People's Park complex, restaurants on Smith st etc. You may just walk around and miss half of it. Also LOOK UP! And think about the history of the buildings and appreciate that they have been preserved. If you go for a cheap massage upstairs off Pagoda st you will get an idea of how it used to be with the steep staircases and narrow rooms.

It is definitely worth checking out with friends and family. I would NOT recommend a stroller as pathways are uneven and if it rains you may not be able to fit under an awning. Baby carrier is the way to go. I've seen people with strollers and I think it is often too crowded at night anyway to safely have your baby in it. People are pushing each other too much."
,,Enjoyable,4.0,,"As a Singaporean, I do visit very often. Mainly because it has things that are different from most of the shopping malls. I go to the Dim Sum there because it is more traditional style. I enjoy the bric a brac shop and the antique reproduction shops. There are shops that sells Vietnamese decor/home items. I always buy my wine holders in Chinatown because it is a very pretty gift wrap. Also you can get good deals for cushions and table runners. I also like the Museum shop - in particular the greeting cards are hand embroidered, so it is very different. Worth it considering how much Hallmark is charging these days. The Tin Tin shop is a real change from the usual Chinatown and worth a visit. You can buy all kinds of Chinese teas there. Also much of the traditional Asian cookies. Nearby is the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre to try local food. Forget the one in Chinatown itself - the quality isn't very good. Or for something a little more modern, walk across the road to Ann Siang Hill/Club Street where local designer boutiques are located. And several bars that offer a burger for lunch if that's what you fancy. Some nice patisseries are around that area for an afternoon cake too. Go Chinatown only during the day, because the goods are displayed sometimes outside, it's just harder to look at things at night.. Visit the Indian and Chinese temple if this is on your list too. Are they any good - let me put it this way, I've been to better ones!"
,,"Tintin shop, that's the centre of my attention",4.0,,"I went there to accompany my mom. For my mom, she loves being there. She bought a lot of stuffs, souvenir and t shirts. Bags and other things. I like the building being so colourful and bright. I love one coffee shop that serve kaya toast. They had the best coffee I've ever had in singapore. But the reason why i went to china town is definitely tintin shop….!!!!"
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"Since we are from San Francisco, we felt while in Singapore we needed to visit Chinatown to compare it with our local one. We liked Singapore Chinatown quite a bit. The shops had good quality items and the prices were pretty good compared with San Francisco. We liked the fact that there were a lot of pedestrian areas so you didn't have to deal with crowded sidewalks and cars and the area seemed pretty clean. Lots of restaurants to choose from, and the famous Maxwell Road hawker center is close by. Definitely work your time."
,,Best chinatown ever!,5.0,,This area is one of the most colourful and tasty in Singapore but moreover it's a really clean and safety place to be
,,Nice part of Singapore,4.0,,"Nice and so different from the rest of what we saw in Singapore. Lots of small local restaurants, the Night Market."
,,Good for shopping - but all same same,3.0,,"We visited here after dinner (probably our first mistake) and explored the main shopping areas, only to discover that ALL of the shops were selling the same cheesy Singapore stuff. There were a few little gems hidden around but were hard to find. Yes, everything is really cheap so it's a good place to visit to get little knick knacks for people back home."
,,Bargain Hunting at its Best,4.0,,"When you're pressed for time and low on the budget then this is the place to be. If you want to get those souvenir SG Shirts, you must take the time to visit Chinatown. Try to roam around and scout for the best bargain and get ready to haggle."
,,The most sterilized Chinatown I've been,4.0,,Clean and orderly. I doubt you'd get lost or feel unsafe yet you'd be excited if you were a shopping junkie.
,,Food to die for,5.0,,Chinatown for my is all about the food. The most amazing Chinese cuisine can be found hidden in these streets as well as a few boutique hotels and hostels.
,,Bargains,5.0,,"This is the best place to get your gifts, the prices are very cheap. I saw some of the same items in Australia 4times and more of the price, ie. 3silk ties for $5. The Temple is opposite the bus stop and is well worth looking at, it is beautiful."
,,shopping for gifts,4.0,,"China Town full of wonderful small stalls/shops awaiting a treasure hunt w efound lots of trinkets,delicatechinese fans, my favourite's and some must have scarve's ,chopsticks and chinese memorabilia.A great day out wandering around,enjoying all the colours and things to purchase."
,,Chinese new year,3.0,,"This is the place to be during Chinese new year. Visit to see Chinese arts, taste yummy food and buy cheap souvenirs. Dont miss the firewaorks during the new year. People with crowd allergy should avoid this place :)"
,,Flee market,5.0,,"lot of chinese and taiwan innvovation stuff you could buy useful around the house. i bought a malalion which is a must buy and a few dryfruits, chimes, laminatin small device which was pretty useful aroind the house.Chinatown is an end less streets of fell market. dont be suprised if you gt lost but have fun"
,,Typical Chinatown similar to those in other cities,3.0,,"Very touristy, quite akin to many other Chinatowns in other cities. Lots of souvenirs for sale, food stands, red lanterns hanging from the top. I did notice the world's largest coin on display, so that was something a bit different.

One shop had a bunch of old Chinese artifacts for sale. When my bf asked how much the giant Buddha sculpture went for, the guy said too much. LOL, it was an antique worth thousands. I saw a lot of name chops that were kind of cute, but I already have one somewhere in my parents' house, I think--and besides, I never use those things.

We walked into a shopping mall that was a bit old and decrepit and quite dead. One shop had a funny sign that said, ""Out for lunch/dinner. If you need me, I'll skip dessert!""

I had to use the bathroom, and the ones on the upper floors were locked, probably due to lack of tenants nearby. So I went to the one on the bottom floor and discovered... a squatter! Haven't seen one of those in ages, since I was a wee girl in Taiwan.

There wasn't anything worth shopping for in the mall, so we just took a quick look at some of the jade ornaments for sale and then walked on out."
,,Very busy but fun.,5.0,,"Lots of cheap souvenirs and cheap buys, but the best part is the amazing choice of foods, especially the black pepper crab - expensive but great. There are also lots of cheaper dishes, and great lanes and malls for finding a bargain!"
,,Worth a trip to add it to your list,3.0,,"Chinatown is close enough to Orchard Road to make the trip, about a $15 cab fare I guess.. It was an OK place to visit, but many of the shops are repetitive, offering similar goods if not identical. Its not huge, however it does have an atmosphere worth checking out. If your there and looking for something to do in the evening in Singapore, check it out, it wont take long and the food there is good in the restaurants, hope you like it..."
,,Take it or leave it...,3.0,,"While this is one of the tourist areas of Singapore, I found Chinatown to be a 'whatever' moment. It is akin to many Chinatown around the world and to be strictly honest, if you want to see Chinatown, you might as well see China."
,,Best Part of Singapore,5.0,,"Lovely area, teaming with culture and nice architecture. plenty of places to sit, eat and drink and some great souvenir bargains to be had too!"
,,nothing special,3.0,,DIsappointing to find a Chinatown as run down and grimey. Surprisingly in Singapore where most things gleam and sparkle.
,,food food and food,5.0,,"so many place in China town that you can find a cheap food, medicine, clothes and Malayan oriental buildings. And for me, china town is heavenly food stall. 9 cent pork bapao for breakfast or famous bakut teh for dinner."
,,Great atmosphere,5.0,,"Chinatown was a nice place, where we could speak Chinese, because we are Chinese,too. Loved this place and the food, clothes and people here as well."
,,Great Buzz,5.0,,This is a must do whilst in Singapore. The Indian and Chinese Temples are great to visit and good photo opportunities. The stalls are also good to look around.
,,Warm up your bargaining skills,5.0,,"I have been to quite a few Chinatowns, so I almost skipped this one. It has all the standard fixtures: hawkers vying for attention and an abundance of knickknacks. This one is a little bit different though. Singapore is such a melting pot of cultures and you can really see it in the stall offerings. There was a fantastic chopstick stall, which had an amazing range of sets from souvenir to extravagant, including styles from Chinese to Taiwanese. Make sure to drop by Smith Street for some Chicken Rice from a local vendor. I had a lemon chicken rice from one at the end of the road that was absolutely fantastic - and cost a mere $3.50!

Also, if you've never been to an Asian street market this is a great place to start. You can practice your haggling with vendors who all speak English and are generally friendly and good natured."
,,Cannot be missed,5.0,,Always love going to China Town and spending lots on antiques - there is a great shop there. My husband has tailored shirts and trousers made and there is always a bargain for scarves.
,,Enjoyable Stroll and great History,4.0,,"Enjoyed an evening here with friends, enjoyed the market stalls and hd a great meal. Would recommend for all to do."
,,OK,3.0,,I wish Chinatown shops had more Chinese people working the shops and stalls; many don't even speak Mandarin -- I find Chinatown underwhelming living in Beijing prior. Great little massage places though!
,,Tradditional life after buildings,5.0,,"We found this place was great to looking for a different and tradditional life after modern Singapore. Great sights, restaurants, hostels, all was great for value"
,,Full of Chinese flavor,4.0,,"The style of building is very traditional, good for photo shooting. On a road with a lot of red lanterns, there's a lot of road-side restaurant which looks attractive.

The famous 'Lin Chi Yuen' BBQ pork shop is just next to the MTR exit, we buy some as souvenir and it really taste great.

Highly recommend BBQ pork instead of BBQ beef."
,,Different Singapore,5.0,,"Take the MRT to Outram Park and walk to Chinatown and you will be able to see the real Chinatown and not just the touristy part. There are a buddhist, hindu temple and a mosque to see/visit. Even the small tourist stalls won't overcharge you, it is Singapore after all. You can try and haggle over the price, just might be successful. Across the Buddhist Temple is the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre, a better, cheaper place to eat than Chinatown itself in my opinion."
,,yummies in the tummies,5.0,,"Food Food Food

one of the many brilliant taxi drivers we got told us to go the hawker area in Smith St

He told us the proper resturants are no longer owned by locals but the stalls are and the food is more Singapore - he was right

Could not find an atm to save myself the first night though

Bit of souvenier shopping paradise and of course they do take visa"
,,Nice buzz!,4.0,,"Always nice to walk around in China town. Always busy, nice foodcourts, nice restaurants, great place to hangout and choose either restaurant a-la-carte or go for one of the best Hawker centres. Also check out the botique hotel - The Scarlett. Don't eat there but staying a night or 2 is a nice experience."
,,Atmosphere,4.0,,At night it's got a certain atmosphere of a crowded night market. Best time to visit is before Chinese New Year shopping for all the Chinese New Year goodies.
,,Too touristy but overall enjoyable,4.0,,"As usual, the Singapore govt has turned areas of cultural significance into mere tourist traps. Unless you have never been to China, I would advise you not to buy touristy souvenirs from Chinatown as much of these souvenirs are sold in China at a fraction of the price in Singapore.

Putting all the touristy elements aside, Chinatown is quite enjoyable. Take a stroll along the colonial shophouses. Some of the shops still preserve their original state (e.g. a 1950's style clinic, a traditional Chinese herb shop which is still popular for their high quality herbs at reasonable prices). The food is generally good too. If you want a genuine Singaporean experience, skip the fancy restaurants (there aren't much good ones in Chinatown, anyway) and head to the hawker centres to sample the local fare. Tip for lost tourists: it is usually safe to buy your meals from stores with long queues as this is usually indicative of the quality of the food.

Visit the Buddha Tooth relic temple as well. Even though it is a relatively new structure in Chinatown (if i recall correctly), the facade is impressive. Also the Indian temple, though I have never stepped inside.

Also another attraction is the 'death street' (seh yan gai), where old and ill people went there to wait to die in the past (kind of like a modern day hospice without the medical care). Now, small shops occupy the building. Do visit the shops there as they sell tasty cantonese delicacies such as egg tarts and char siew sohs (a kind of pastry with braised pork inside - delicious!).

Also visit the Maxwell Food centre, which is just across the road from the death street. Many food stores inside have been featured in the local food shows on TV and have won numerous awards for delicious food.

Within walking distance is Ang Siang Hill, another place with rich history. See the colonial shophouses (which boasts a different style than the ones in the heart of Chinatown) which have been largely rejuvenated with pubs and restaurants.

Chinatown has much to offer. Just veer away from the touristy elements and I think it would be much more enjoyable. In other words, explore Chinatown the way a local would."
,,Chinatown - Well Worth A Visit !!,4.0,,"We really enjoyed our visit to Chinatown. We reached it on one occassion by the shuttle from the Copthorne Kings Hotel, and on the other via the Hop On Hop Off Tour Bus.

It was buzzing with atmosphere. Admittedly you do get many of the shop staff quite enthusiastically trying to get you to buy from them. The tailors, and the massage people are the most persistent. As well as seeing the local sights, I was keen to buy a camera so decided to scope out what was available first having already researched prices and models on line. One of the first shops we visited was Synergy electronics where we met a lovely guy called Gordon who was both friendly and immensely helpful. He gave us his card, and we told him we would return the next day. Having checked out a few other stores who it seemed wanted to rip us off by charging in one case over $300 Singapore dollars more, we returned the following day. Gordon was surprised to see us, and proceeded to devote his time to us for nearly the next hour, and persuaded us to buy a much better and different make camera than I had intended but at the lower price of my intended purchase. He also showed me how to use the camera and threw in a branded case, and rechargeable batteries and charger ! Oh and let me study the worldwide guarantee provided just in case of problems. He provided top class service, with a high level of friendliness and warmth, which would lead me to recommend going to see him if you are looking to make a purchase.

By the way, if you think you smell gas while in area it is likely to be over ripe Dorian fruit - they smell foul ! and seem to be evident in many places.

Also worth a photo stop, the lovely temple near the Hop On-Hope Off Stop of the tour bus , and the start of the market stalls and shops,"
,,One way to spend an afternoon,3.0,,"if you are in Singapore your trip won't be complete without visiting the Chinatown , specially if you never visited a Chinatown before . It is not one of the best though , but it has nice small shops and traditional restaurants . It would be a fun way to spend an afternoon , but would not visit again ."
,,Singapore's Chinese Place,3.0,,"Lots of souvenirs and street shopping and food. Nothing too much on the high end but there can be some good buys too! Might be hot in the afternoon. Night generally usually cooler and street lightings can be quite bright and beautiful. Extremely convenient by MRT and many typical chinese food can be found. There's many small streets and nice vintage feel buildings to take photographs and explore. Good place to visit especially during Chinese New Year festive period where you can see lots and lots of red decorative items, clothes and all."
,,Okay!,3.0,,"I stayed near china town my last visit to Singapore. There is nice lush scenery everywhere and it is nice to walk around. Okay shops, lots of souvenirs and food places. Some clothes shopping which I, even an obsessive shopper, didn't buy anything except an eye shadow because all the stuff was similar to Aus and similar pricing. Didn't feel very comfortable from all the dirty looks I was getting and it smells in some areas so bad I was vomiting the whole plane home."
,,Souvenir and Chinese food hunting time,3.0,,China town in singapore was a great place for souvenir hunter. There are fixed price and negotiable price. Also Enjoy the chinese food. Suggest to visit at night for better atmosphere. Easy to reach with MRT (proceed to Chinatown MRT) or Bus also.
,,Shop and eat,4.0,,"Surrounded by the night market streets and Lots of souvenir shops. I can almost finish my shopping list here: t-shirt, keychains, and famous pork jerky shops are close by. Food stalls open later so go there in the evening if you are more interested in the food"
,,"Hit or miss, still something you should visit",3.0,,"For a country that has a majority population that identifies themselves as Chinese, Chinatown celebrates the historical past of Singapore. This was where the Chinese lived and opened shops when Singapore was a British trading port and the Chinese were mere immigrants ( and a minority then).
Now it has evolved to become an overpriced souvenir hunting place with overly rude shopkeepers and cheap restaurants. Still I do recommend coming to Chinatown just to see the lively place with the colonial style shophouses, the varied lovely small nooks of restaurants that serve good food at a reasonable price, great place for souvenir hunting and learn to hone your bargaining skills. But the Buddhist temple and the Hindu temples are both must see and across the south bridge road is the Ang siang hill where there are western restaurants and a small lovely park connector via Ang siang hill."
,,Everything about Chinatown and more,4.0,,"This place really is busy. It's crowded, hot, a bit dirty (yes, Singapore isn't as clean as everyone thinks) but mostly, it's fun. Lots of stores... Lots of food stalls and lots and lots of shopping. During january this place is off the hook. Lights, festivities and night life for the Lunar/Chinese New Year... a must if you are here then... But fun all year round."
,,Shopping!!!!,4.0,,"As you get out of the MRT station Chinatown, You come on very narrow road fulled with people and shopkeepers trying to sell their product. This is picture is unusual for city or country like Singapore.
It is a net of narrow roads crossing each other with shops of antigues, electronics, cloths and gifts.

Enjoy shopping in Chinatown."
,,Just lots of shops here,3.0,,"There isn’t much here to see except to get Chinese styled souvenirs and food. As compared to Little India, this place does not have much to offer in culture. If you venture into each of those shops though you might find some nice surprises to buy and bring home like calligraphy, ink stamps in Chinese etc. Overall its just lots of shops selling clothes and souvenirs. There is a free walking tour in the afternoon though and it was quite good."
,,A nice market and temple,4.0,,"Recently went to Singapore and visited Chinatown on Day1 itself. It has a nice market. The shops are neatly lined up, various souvenirs to choose from and very colorful. The shopkeepers were nice and friendly. Prices are fixed and no bargaining. We enjoyed our walk through the markets, bought a few things (probably everyone will buy SOMETHING at least) and saw the beautiful Buddha Tooth Relic and Museum."
,,Best souvenir shopping,5.0,,Amazing range and prices - got some fantastic clothing bargains here too. The place to go for souvenirs. My only advice is to come and have a look and then come back and do your shopping. The range and number of shops is a bit overwhelming
,,Bargain Place-a must when in Singapore,5.0,,"A must visit when you are in Singapore the bargains to be had here are huge..so clean/so organised..great place.so many places to eat and prices are good ,we found an old chinese place that was great so much food we could not eat it all..cant wait to visit again early next year."
,,Great food,5.0,,"My Favourite place in Singapore. As someone who has previously lived in China for over 10 years, Chinatown captures the spirit of ""lao zhong guo"". Lots of street snacks. Head over to People's plaza if you want a massage by an experienced reflexologist. Electronics, travel agents, and stores selling food and knick knacks. There's something for everyone."
,,Worth the walk,4.0,,"I wouldn't buy anything here, except if I knew the product and the vendor very well. It's just the atmosphere in this bustling area of Singapore. And the many, many food shops: what a culture!"
,,Buzzy and worth a visit,4.0,,"I enjoy the Singapore Chinatown for quite a different mix of shops, outlets and many food choices. Nice place to get a foot massage and wander round."
,,Good Food,4.0,,It's a nice place. The streets are lined with colorful old Chinese houses and lanterns. There are shopping places too and you can bargain. Some stalls sells interesting things like colorful chopsticks and Chinese umbrellas. The best thing about this place is the food. Go to the famous dessert cafes near the MRT station.
,,Best Shopping!,5.0,,"Singapore is well known for its high end/designer shopping - but Chinatown is the place to shop in Singapore if you are a poor-broke-college-kid (like me). Great deals, and you can haggle everything. And the food is great in this area too!"
,,Steer away from the camera shops,5.0,,"Lots of souvenirs to buy here from the street shops. Interestingly, this is not just Chinatown, there's also a Hindu temple here. We did not enter any temples but just by walking around the shop houses you can get a feel of how people lived in the past. We also visited the museum Chinatown Heritage Centre located right in the heart of Chinatown. Very representative and realistic. Good educational tour. Meanwhile do steer away from the shops selling cameras or tailored clothes. They might sound attractive initially but usually lots of mark ups at the end."
,,China town in Singapore,4.0,,"Is a large area and there are many shops selling gifts and clothing, but the product is not very good. Besides having a large temple with beautiful design."
,,NICE PLACE TO BUY BARGAIN ITEMS,4.0,,it was very easy access to china town by mrt. There are lot of 3 for 10 and 1 dollar shops where you can do lot of bargain hunting.There are lot of eating places also.
,,Amazing atmosphere,4.0,,"Been there for several times, now we stayed there to know the atmosphere of the Chinatown. The MRT is NE 4, Chinatown, the best way is get out at pagoda street, you can find the Chinese Heritage Centre with lots of souvenir stalls, foods stall, and at the end you can find Hindu Temple and a mosque next to it at the South Bridge Road. You can also cross the road to the People's Park, with the shops of Chinese traditional product, food court and many other shops. As a multicultural city, you can find halal food in the food court at the People's Park. We found the atmosphere was amazing and always busy till late at night."
,,Nice Stroll Through Smelly Streets but Great Food,4.0,,Have traveled Asia for over 30 years and enjoy a stroll through the smelly underworld of asia as this is where you find some of the best food. In most countries the smeely underworlds is not too safe but Singapore is a very nice exception. On this trip we stopped at a place that had great chili crabs and shrimps. We sat there for hours talking and eating in later August 2012 (this is a late review written in Nov 2012). Got to love it and I will be back
,,Take a free tour from Chinese Heritage Centre,5.0,,"There is a free tour every weekday at 14.00 starting from China Heritage Centre on Pagoda Street.
It will give you an idea about the history of Chinese settlement, informative guide will explain a bit about architecture, temples, food and people.

Then enjoy exploring by yourself."
,,Favorite Hangout,5.0,,"We love going down to Chinatown on Friday nights for seafood and beers. Food is good, beer is cheap and the people watching tops everything off."
,,Take your time to enjoy China town,4.0,,China town holds so much of Singapore's history The dreams of so many Chinese for a better life. Today you have the open markets but the old buildings remain. Take a guided tour if you want to learn more about the temples and the buildings.
,,Mix of old and new and kitsch,3.0,,"You could probably find whatever you're looking for in here if you're a tourist. Some of the streets are full of shop houses, but then you also have a few shopping complexes as well. There are also a few ""night market""ish streets as well with a few restaurants and lots of tourist offerings to top it all off.

Good for an hour or so of wandering around and picking up some souvenir. Be sure to visit the Sri Mariamman Temple while you're at it (not much to see, but the entryway is nice)"
,,As far as Cina towns go its a little average,2.0,,"Been to quite a few around the world, but as the ethnic chinese populationis so high in Singpaore, this part of town is a little average and run down. beware of the food as not always the best quality or cleanliness."
,,Busy and fun,4.0,,China town is full of stalls dripping with souviners and places to eat or drink. Its totally geared up for the tourista but still good fun. Look at the edge of china town full of locals to eat as its a lot cheap and the food is amazing
,,Of course it is worth it !!!,5.0,,"Of course it is so worth visiting , cheap food, few shops , temple, mosque to visit ! and i love the Vault - chic , good music, good food, beautiful people. little streets behind with all a lot of restaurants / bars."
,,Different world,4.0,,"It is interesting part of Singapore, felt like stepped in another part of world. Chinatown is perfect for buying souvenirs, variety of choices. There are also few interesting temples."
,,Better at night,4.0,,Fairly average during the day but comes to life at night. When all the lanterns are lit and all the colourful stalls open in the market you actually feel like you are in Chinatown. Plenty of shopping and good food to eat.
,,Another Chinatown!,3.0,,"Well most of the stores are concentrated in the shopping center, where clothing is predominant. You can eat and buy cheap souvenir stuff. But forget cleanliness or napkins. Yes, all the food court stores do not have napkins. We saw some ladies selling tissues paper to be used as napkins"
,,Maxwell hawker centre,4.0,,"Maxwell road hawker centre is located pretty close to China Town, but yet the price of food there are much cheaper and tastier. You can find all kinds of authentic Singapore cuisine such as Hainanese chicken rice, laksa, Singapore sweet desserts (ice kachang, chendol, bo bo cha cha), etc., in this so called hawker centre, it's actually a food centre.

In Singapore, food inside an outdoor hawker centre taste much better than you go to the food court inside shopping malls. Although outdoor hawker centre has got no air conditioning, the weather can be very hot during noon time, you can enjoy the authentic Singapore food better than anywhere else."
,,Most clean beautiful Chinatown in the world,4.0,,"Singapore are very good at maintaining historical buildings. When you go there you can imaging you're in the mid-1900. Don't forget to visit the Chinatown visitor centre, and get some souvenirs before you leave, cheaper here."
,,very interesting for sure,4.0,,"there were so much to see, to buy, to eat.. i love the visitor centre near the buddha relic temple. and also a not-so-wide park with a pagoda on the overpass. the colonial architecture is well-preserved with many different colour paint."
,,Visit to Chinatown,3.0,,Was bit disappointed with Chinatown was expecting more. Have been to Chinatown in Melbourne and it was much better.
,,Great Singapore Food,4.0,,"If you want to try the local delicacies, this is the place to be. All sorts of Chinese food to be found within the streets. The buildings also have a lot of historical value behind it. Be sure to check out the crowd during Chinese New Year. Stalls line the small streets. Streams of people walk down the streets purchasing new year goodies. Get the festive season in the mood!"
,,felt like a different country for an afternoon,5.0,,"i absolutely loved my trip to china town. in fact i felt like i had stepped off a plane into china. i walked up temple street and visited the markets. great fun i noticed things were very chreap as compared to thailand. most of the stuff was souvenier type things but clothes etc were available. i than did the spa package at the bath house in termple street. across the roiad is the peoples place shopping centre great plavce for cheap massage, eyebrow shaping etc. all in all i really enjoyed my time spent here"
,,Catch the vibe,4.0,,"People, stalls, temples, food, buzz... go there to catch the nice vibe and buy some food or souvenirs"
,,Chinatown,5.0,,"A great place to pick up tourist trinkets; keyrings, fridge magnets, perfume, and cameras are plentifull as well as some great restaurants and drinking spots. Don't miss the wetmarket. Quite an experience!!"
,,"Great fun, great food and shopping",5.0,,"This vibrant and exciting part of Singapore is worth a visit. There is so much going on, smells, colour and a hive of activity everywhere. You can wander along it's many lanes browsing in the shops and along the stalls and then take your pick from the numerous delicious eateries dotted all over the place. Wonderful little teashops to rest your feet or take shelter from the heat or the rain."
,,Its a good area to look around but tame,3.0,,"Its a decent sized Chinatown and the Pagoda and temple are pretty. It is a little bit tame and full of tourist tat shops and tailors. It was a little irritating having almost every other stall trying to shake our hands, sell us a tailored suit or offer us their business cards. At night Smith street turns into a hawker center with food stalls lining the street. We had chilli crab their on our first night, it was expensive compared to other foods available, we might have been ripped off but it was tasty all the same. 2 chilli crabs cost about 50SGD, we also had fried rice. Also we had two large bottle of Tiger beer that cost 5.90 SGD each. The food was good as was the atmosphere, lots of locals eating there too."
,,One of the best Chinatowns outside of the real deal!!,5.0,,"Great food, great shopping. You might as well be in China as you wander the streets, eat the food from local stalls or eat at some of the wonderful restaurants."
,,Good place for everything! !!!,5.0,,"I cant say too much for this place because its very big and u can find anything in here. Food,stuff and anything. This is a great place for buy anything"
,,great location,4.0,,"china town singapore
there are a lot of place to visit in this area (buddha relics temple, sri marriaman temple)
the price of souvenir are also very cheap
there is a jade shop at smith st called lihong jade that offer hi quality jade
try a lot of tea at tea of time at mosque st
and many many more"
,,A true flavor of days gone by,5.0,,"Singapore is a truly remarkable city, green lush spotless and very expensive, however if you want to touch the ""old soul"" of the Lion City, then head down to China town.

Still clean still remarkable, but so much more for your dollar, from tacky holiday gifts to expensive cameras, its all here, you can barter (great fun) be prepared though, these guys are very good at it, you can eat fantastically authentic Asian food from so many regions, at a fraction of the cost of Orchard Road.

For eating try a different course in different places, great fun, you may not always know what you are eating but it will taste and smell good.

Night time brings an altogether different vibe to the area, but trust me, this is how Singapore used to be, check it out, you wont regret it."
,,Chinatown decorated,5.0,,The China town was decorated all along the main streets. When you get close to them you know you are entering China town. We been there almost every second day whether shopping or dining.
,,A 'must visit' location,4.0,,"We love Chinatown and always spend time there when we are in Singapore. There are shops selling a wide range of products, alot with a connection to Chinese culture of course, but also electronic tech, cameras, clothes, jewellery etc.

There are hours worth of browsing in this area, both in the malls like Peoples Park Centre and also in the precincted area, where there are also lots of cafes and restaurants. Please note: the food hall in basement of Peoples Park Centre is excellent. There are a number of food outlets here and you can chose as many or as few dishes as you like and pay surprisingly little for it - about £2.50 for a well filled plate of very tasty chinese food.

Chinatown is always busy. Yes, it is quite touristy, but you will also see locals shopping and eating in the area. It's possible to eat in Chinatown from early morning to late late at night. Don't make the mistake that Chinatown is only the immediate area around the Chinatown MRT Station, cross the main road via the foot bridges, to get to the precict area, which takes in several lanes of shops and eateries.

There are also Temples and the Chinese Heritage Centre in Chinatown, so it's not just shopping and eating!"
,,Cultural Trail,4.0,,Would recommend for tourists who are interested in the Chinese culture in Singapore. There are really nice food around that area.
,,Mini China,3.0,,"This place is a tourist spot.Located to mrt station known as Chinatown Station.There is food court, shops, will be croweded spot for Chinese New Year and Latern Festival."
,,A must shortly before Chinese new year,5.0,,"Most people are travelling during Chinese new year, therefore, go shortly before, where all the decorations and the people (still) are there. impressive."
,,Very busy,4.0,,Chinatown is full of streets of touristy shops and shops that supply cooking equipment and tailor shops etc. It is full of people most of the time and at night when everyone seems to come out to eat when it's cool. Some very pushy shop owners hassle you quite a bit so be strong and keep moving.
,,"Buzzing, colourful, entrancing",5.0,,"This area has everything - interesting temples and museums, markets with every conceivable item on sale, stalls for tourists with extraordinarily cheap bags, fabric items, souvenirs etc. for sale, wonderful food shops, probably a festival - don't miss it. It's easily found on the MRT."
,,Disapointing Street food prices,2.0,,"10 years ago this was a great place to eat street food, but now the vendors are still on Smith Street, but really its just post restaurants selling from behind stalls. ie sweet and sour chicken at $14SGD i can eat fish and chips in harry ramsdens in singapore for $16! its become a bit of a tourist trap for street food, you think its good and cheap but you can get the same or much better at not much more cost!"
,,Nice Shopping street,5.0,,"Good shopping street with lots of restaurants. I tried some chinese restaurants and they were good. Buy lot of items very cheap. If you're buying more, don't forget to bargain."
,,Chinatown? More like tourist-souvenir town,3.0,,"I'm not sure if I understand what 'Chinatown' means to our friends from various parts of the world - I haven't been to that many. However, this place is more like streets and streets of shops paddling wares for tourists - selling chopsticks and fans and such. Oh yes, marked up electronics too. Each of the streets used to have distinct flavours and functions, but the vanishing trades have succumbed in the face of astronomical rental rates in Singapore. If you're here to look for Chinese cuisine, that it's also going to be a hit-and-miss affair. Unless a particular place has gotten rave reviews from people you actually know (or reviewers you trust), then you may end up unimpressed, or having the wrong impression of Chinese cuisine.

It won't be a complete waste of time for those who has never been here. Just plan the trip and look for specific attractions here, because wandering down each of the streets aimlessly might end up disappointing you."
,,Souvenirs..,4.0,,Great place to find souvenirs especially if you have intentions of buying a lot. A place where you can bargain the price.
,,Good attraction,4.0,,A very good attraction and it really represent a Chinatown because majority of the businesses are run by chinese from china.
,,"Good atmosphere, awful customer service",3.0,,"Going to china town is a must; seeing all the Chinese lanterns set across the road is impressive, as are the amount of stalls and market shops. There is a central performance area which puts on shows, however we just missed one.

We went upstairs to the food hall, as a word of warning, not all of the food stall workers speak English. We also picked up a drink from another side stall and their attitude was abrupt and rude. Food was good to experience, I would recommend wanton noodles, as duck has a lot of bones in it.

Ideal if you want to buy some souvenirs to take home."
,,CHinatown by night by Tour East,4.0,,"We did a tour by night of Chinatown. This was through Tour East. We were collected at our hotel and transferred to the main tour bus. Our guide, Maggie, was a scream. She is very knowledgable and told us of the history of Singapore, and of the local landmarks and sights. We went to a calligrapher who put our names, in chinese, onto red paper fans. We then went to do some shopping in chinatown. Afterwards, we has a chinese banquet at the Yum Cha restuarant. The meal was good and there was plenty to eat. Next we did a trishaw ride from chinatown to Clarke Quay. This was a the highlight of the tour. The riders are funny and enjoy their work. Thet love taking photos & having their photos taken. We were then delivered to a bum boat ride up the Singapore river. This took you to see the Marina Bay sands & Merlion at night. The tour was worth doing."
,,brilliant atmosphere,5.0,,We visited Chinatown during their autumn festival it was absolutley amazing.There were lanterns everywhere.So very colourful.Cheapest Tiger beer in Singapore and the food was amazing!Shops were pretty good too! a change from all the shopping malls.Full of hustle and bustle full of character go you won't be dissapointed!
,,Great place!!,5.0,,Don't miss it! Great jewellery at Mayer Jewellery at 25 Trengganu Street. Good jade deals. Try to be first customer as you will get the best deal of the day. Great food in Chinatown Complex food hall.
,,A unique melting pot of cultures,4.0,,"Singapore's Chinatown is not your usual kind of Chinatown, you must visit it to see and experience it yourself."
,,Unique China,5.0,,"I had been to China in 2011 and this year i came to Chinatown in Singapore. It have its unique features and being a multi-racial and multi-cultural. Indian Temples, Mosques, and churches can be found alongside Chinese Temples and Monasteries. This is a really bustling district, where you can just walk around and shop all kinds of things."
,,Got a dress made by a tailor,4.0,,Although it wasn't actually that cheap but the service was friendly. Love the narrow streets with booths and the hawkers centres and the pagoda are amazing!
,,Delightful during Mid-Autumn Festival,4.0,,"Chinatown is a nice little place, even when the Mid-Autumn festival is not On. The place is always vibrant and teeming with little shops selling Chinese souvenirs and goodies. But during the festival, i.e usually around September, the place is at its best. With lanterns hanging all around the place. And the shops busier and livelier than ever!
This place is a huge relief from the high rise buildings of the main city. The shops are smaller and affordable. And the buildings are smaller and more traditional in design. This is THE place to experience Chinese culture in Singapore."
,,Nice day trip!,5.0,,"walk through the local Chinatown in Singapore for a trip of the senses....sights, sounds, fragrances!"
,,"Fun, Fun, Fun!",4.0,,This is one of the very few places in Singapore where you can find cheap goods for sale. The place looks nice cause of the lantern displays and this is one of the cleanest chinatown I've been to!
,,When you need to bring back gifts from your travels...,4.0,,"Perfect place to people watch and bring back gifts from Singapore without breaking your wallet! If you have a jade fan, there are tons of shops with jade of all shapes colors and sizes. There is plenty to eat and satisfy your cravings after all the shopping, food vendors are just as plentiful as the shopping.

Don't forget to check out the Budist and Hindu temples while you are there. Also, any American will enjoy the line dancing on Sunday at the pavilion...no joke, the locals come here to line dance to c&w and they are also dressed the part! Join in and have some fun...or burn off the food that you ate and one of the awesome cafes"
,,Good Atmosphere!,4.0,,"Chinatown has good atmosphere, especially in the evenings and during festive seasons like the Chinese New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival. There're quite a few authentic Chinese eateries at reasonable prices. The souvenir gift shops offer souvenirs at decent prices (but be sure to shop around for the best deals). There are quite a few attractions in the vicinity as well, including Buddha Tooth Relic Tempe, Sri Layan Sithi Vinayagar Temple, Sri Mariamman Temple and Masjid Jamae(Chulia)."
,,Hustle and bustle,3.0,,"Crowded, especially during festivals. The restaurants are tremendously overpriced and target mostly tourists. Still a couple of gems within, but it takes time to find them."
,,Interesting for a visit and some good food stalls,4.0,,Definetely worth a visit. A good row of quality food stalls each with a cleanliness cert as required in singapore. Very clean and reasonably priced with a nice choice of food where you can buy different dishes for the same meal from various stalls and a drink from the local shop all in the evening warmth of Singapore. I loved eating sweat and sour chicken with skate and special fried rice washed down with a beer or soft drink. There are also plenty of restaurants to visit too. Then do some shopping in the stalls and shops and see the temple and market. Go and spend an evening there you will enjoy. Then when your feet hurt go and get a foot massage.
,,Fun to shop in a very vibrant part of town!,4.0,,"We wandered around the shops in Chinatown for a couple of hours. The shop owners were not as pushy as in other cities we have visited. They had an interesting assortment of trinkets. The area was decorated for the Autumn Festival which made it all the more enjoyable. The Chinatown subway station was easily accessible but after looking at the cost for 2 persons, we just took a taxi as it was easier and not that much more expensive."
,,A must visit,4.0,,"A must visit - we went in the day and evening and ate both times in the market area - just chose a booth and order your food, which is cooked up fresh in front of you - as easy as that!
We spent the rest of our time wandering around and taking in the atmosphere.
We visited the Temple of the Buddha Tooth Relic, a beautiful temple entrenched in gold"
,,"Sama as every Chinatown in the world, nevertheless worth visiting",3.0,,"Very dynamic, there is a nice pagoda. Huge market with everything you can image. Cheap and relative good textile products, lot of gadgets (beware of copies). Walk from the financial district and get on the subway at Chinatown station.
You can eat very cheap, but expect low quality, not really European standards."
,,Don't really like it,3.0,,Don't really like Chinatown. Don't know why. Maybe because it looked so messy. I will avoid going to this place if I can.
,,What a busy area,4.0,,"We visited Chinatown as a part of a tour. In particular we enjoyed the night markets and what they had to offer. The buildings in the area were all festival lit and bright. As a part of our tour we undertook a bicycle and side car ride (Rider - owner with 2 guests in the side car) through the markets and Chinatown which was very exciting and different.

A bit scary at first but we were glad we did it."
,,Commercial but fun,5.0,,"Obviosly going through Chinatown nowadays is going through a Chinese bazaar, full of souvenirs and shops. Despite the commercial side of it, it still keeps some of the spirit and it's very nice to walk around. If you go for dinner at the food court you will find the real Chinese essence (only you have to escape from the 4 main streets and the shopping trap!)"
,,"good food, cheap beer, lots of souvenirs",4.0,,we spent a couple of nights in chinatown as it was close to our hotel; we liked the food and we also like looking around for useless (but nice) stuff in the little shops; people are smiling and happy so do go for the atmosphere!
,,Good for shopping and yummy food,5.0,,"We arrived in chinatown after checking in the hotel we went straight to chinatown and had noodle soup and roast pork with rice and roast duck with rice in one of the hawker stalls. Cheap costing us only $20 and yummy. After the meal had a walk to the flea market where a lot of souvenir items were on sale, loved the colorful ambience, very touristy as well key chains were being sold a dollar each which was very cheap and good . Went crazy here bought silk scarfs For 3 for 10 and they had beautiful designs. And you could bargain as well people here were tourist friendly. It reminded me of mongkok in hongkong. Loved every minute here was sorry that we went late, anyway i think next time i go to singspore i will stay in a hotel near chinatown. Lovely and friendly place. Too bad they close at 10pm"
,,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple,4.0,,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is right next to the Chinatown Visitor Centre (in front of the Chinatown hawker centre). On top of the things to see inside the temple at ground level, there's an interesting rooftop garden to explore. Take the lift up."
,,great bargain!,5.0,,if you are looking for bargains or souvenirs to bring back home. Chinatown is the place to go. You can find plenty of nice stuff with low price from chinatown. I went there twice on my visit to singapore.
,,Just another China Town,3.0,,"I found this China town to be very average. I found it very similar to China Town in many other countries I have visited.
I went and at the Hawker Centre there and the chicken rice was nice and quite cheap which was good but apart from a quick wander through I found there was not a lot to do - although the Tintin shop is a must see for those interested!!"
,,Exciting different culture!,4.0,,"We wandered around Chinatown with different sights on every corner. We went through the Chinese temple, with its different colourful walls and acts of worship. We watched devotees splashing water on a smoking deity, surrounded by offerings and garlands of flowers. The silk brocaded walls were fascinating. The street markets were lively and different, and we looked at Chinese silk gowns, tailor made clothes, and a bevy of souvenirs. We saw herbalists and their wares, loads of brass statues, interesting take-aways and good bargains for clothes. Nearby was another Indian temple with their colourful lifelike statues on the walls. Dont miss it."
,,Interesting.,4.0,,"Loved Chinatown, so many things to explore, lots of food, shopping and performers. It is extremely cheap for the shopping and food and the atmosphere is electric especially at night when there are performers.

You will find the traditional tailors here where they can make you an outfit in 24 hours and you can see and pick the material, the quality of both the material and workmanship is excellent."
,,Interesting to say the least,1.0,,"A little disappointing, as it rained the day we were, we went into the mall opposite the Temple and the stink that came out ofthe air system was worse than the local tip, locals were very rude and ignored our presence on a number of occasions, shopping very interesting, but the bartering was fun, overall a disapointing experience. Touting was very annoying, some of them followed you down the road, a little intimidating for the females, but for me, some certain australian frazes got the point across. Just be careful."
,,Bustling and fun!,4.0,,"I stayed at a flashpacker hostel right inside Chinatown actually .... so I got to walk around the area every day for the 4 days I visited November 2011. The atmosphere is bustling and dense with shops and restaurants. Somewhere nearby Pagoda street there are hawker stalls for food, and there were also restaurants that offered specialty crab dishes and where you can dine al fresco. Its a great place to buy souvenirs and t-shirts and other gifts for friends back home. There are some areas in Chinatown that are not so clean compared to most of what I've seen in Singapore. At night the place is still very much alive... but some areas don't feel very safe... I also liked the fact that they had money changers that offered the most competitive rates I'd experienced in Singapore. I'd definitely come back here again but probably not stay till late night."
,,Worth seeing,4.0,,"We were in Singapore for a week, and we enjoyed visiting Chinatown. We were a little confused about where the boundaries and “heart” of Chinatown were actually located. Chinatown seems to be split into two parts with a wide street in between. The confusion was strictly on our parts though. We just didn’t do enough planning ahead of time. I suggest that travelers get a good map and decide exactly where they want to go in Chinatown and how much time they want to spend there. It is well worth seeing."
,,Nice place to buy souvenir,4.0,,"Problaby this is the best spot to stay, since i was staying in chinatown, the people was nice, there are many places to eat, and you will have good bargain for souvenir price in here, so doesnt matter if you stay or not, you need to visit this place"
,,Great walking tour!,4.0,,"Sights, sounds and smell makes the journey so wonderful. Walking around here never bores the eyes with the beautiful rich Chinese culture surrounding the area."

,,fun and colourful,4.0,,Been to several Chinatowns but this one seems to have a more relaxed and eastern character. I visited twice and had a great time strolling around.
,,Local shopping and dining experience,5.0,,"You need to buy some local stuff and you have limited budget? Try Chinatown. You'll find great deals for souvenirs and even for yourself. Try to eat some local food too, dining alfresco. Best to go late afternoon to dinner time."
,,Amazing sights and food,5.0,,"Don't visit Singapore without visiting Chinatown. Easily accessible by MRT it is a visual and culinary delight!
Amazing atmosphere and the best place for cheap souvenirs and great people watching! It especially comes alive of an evening and should definately be on your Singapore ""to do list."""
,,Local food at local prices!,5.0,,We ventured into China Town looking for local DIm Sum and perhaps the famous Singapore Chilli Crab. We were taken upstairs to a crowded room filled with locals. They had picture cards for us to choose our courses. We had great fun and the food was fabulous. We topped it with the Crab. They have plenty of cotton service totes and cool water. A real whole of body experience! When the bill came I enjoyed it even more. Five big eaters for $100 S. Do yourself a favor!
,,Good place for hunting souvenirs,4.0,,Good place for hunting souvenirs. cheaper compare with other place.
,,"Lots of junk to buy, go to the wet market...",4.0,,"Streets of souvenirs to buy, it felt like little of the original Chinatown remained. Look up and admire the architecture and shuttered buildings, your imagination may be able to conjure images of days gone by.
We visited the wet market in the basement of the Chinatown complex which was fascinating with stalls of fresh poultry, live frogs and turtles, eggs , huge bags of dried shrimps, etc. highly recommend having a look.
There is also a toilet in the complex which we found handy more than once!
We also headed own a side street fom the complex and found the CK department store and bought lots of cheap shoes."
,,A weekly visit for fun and excitement,5.0,,"Our best memories of Singapore were our weekly visits to Chinatown. It is a fun place to buy trinkets, and see the thousands of visitors who flock to Singapore. We enjoyed the festive activities and colorful decorations. We always felt safe there even among the heavy crowds. We lived there from 2005-2008"
,,"An average, touristy Chinatown",3.0,,"Chinatown was very touristy - markets were selling a lot of junky touristy things at average prices.
We were told to go there early, and when we did, it was a ghost town - It doesn't open until 11am so keep that in mind. We went back there in the afternoon and it was bustling.
There seems to be a fair few places to eat in the area, and lots of shops
I would say the highlight of Chinatown in Singapore is the buildings and architecture - very beautiful.
Chinatown is very easily accessible by train, as the station leads right out into one of Chinatowns streets."
,,good place for eating,4.0,,hmm...good place for eating...and shopping .. you will get little bit cheaper there..and look of varieties of chinese food there
,,Touristy,3.0,,"Touristy, with prices to match. Try and bargain whenever you can. I'd say the main attraction is the food at Smith Street."
,,Shopping @ Pagoda street,4.0,,"I did a bit of shopping on Pagoda Street in Chinatown and was in love with it. It has various shops for souvenirs, curios, bags, art, and street jewellery. It is right outside Chinatown MRT and easily accessible. If you want to buy gifts and souvenirs wait till you visit Chinatown as you get good stuff at affordable prices.

I was thrilled to discover the Tintin shop on this street. Being a huge fan of Tintin, I could not resist looking through the shop which had some amazing original Tintin collectibles.

There is also the Chinatown Heritage Center which you can visit."
,,Ancient Chinese Area,4.0,,"Chinatown is aplace not to miss.You can get cheap sovennia,nice good chinese food"
,,Robust Chinatown,4.0,,More vibrant during Chinese New Year in a cluster of unique housing architectures of Chinese origin .
,,Lively area with plenty to see,4.0,,"We were a little disappointed that the whole area appeared to be undergoing renovations of some sort. We really enjoyed eating there though, and walking through the busy streets."
,,A real Chinatown experience,4.0,,lot's of resto's with small or big bites cosy little market lot's of shops ofcourse easy to rech by public transport real Chinatown athmosphere
,,Buddhist Temple not to miss,5.0,,"Found some really unique souvenirs at great prices. Got a great strand of fresh water pearls for $20 U.S. don't forget to bargain. Had some great Dim Sum, many restaurants to choose from. I must say we really enjoyed the temple. Great to experience a new culture, an immerse yourself. Great day!"
,,Typical market scene - busy hot and smelly,3.0,,"I really like markets but this one did not really do it for me. The smell was not one of culture or food, it was of rubbish or smelly drains. If you need a fridge magnet, flag or a waving cat, this is the place to go."
,,"There are ""better"" Chinatowns",4.0,,"Nonetheless, if you are in Singapore, it is probably essential to go and view. The Temple of the Buddha Tooth Relic is located there, almost next to the Chinatown Complex monstrosity! Hey, may ge I expected some staged authenticity."
,,"Great place for nice meals and some ""shopping""",4.0,,We went to Chinatown quite few times during our trip. First we went to see the temples and the get the overall ambience. Since it was so nice we went Chinatown Food street for dinner and then some souvenir shopping at Night Market which was worth seeing. We also went to eat Chinatown Hawker’s Food Centre. I think Chinatown is very interesting place that should be experienced both day and night. We also enjoyed some drinks and people watching there. What a vibrant area.
,,Convenience Location,4.0,,"You'll find every thing here! Heaven fo food lover, Asian food lover in particular."
,,"Be aware of scam in electronics shop in people park close to the chinatown mrt station , it called ""gadget sensation shop"".",4.0,,I have trick such way to pay more than it should be.. Never buy anything electronic stuff from chinatown shop. Pay for extra warranty that actually not exist.
,,Best Deals in Singapore,4.0,,"This is the perfect place to pick up souvenirs (and snacks!) if you don't want to spend a fortune. It is very clean, just like the rest of Singapore, and the wares remind me of items we typically see at a Cost Plus World Market or similar store."
,,many chineses stuff and food,5.0,,you can get the typical dirty SE asian market and food stall on the street at night!!! I saw the biggest ice cream plate.. it looks like a mountain peak!
,,Place to go if you want to know about Chinese Culture,4.0,,"Chinatown has pretty much gone through alot of changes over the decades but the people living there still retains its colorful history & Chinese culture in many of the shops there. In Chinatown, you could experience the Chinese culture to its fullest! From the food to the shopping.. the whole experience is wonderful! Though it has become more touristy in the recent decade, I still enjoy going down Chinatown for a good meal or decent shopping! You can find many Chinese-related souvenirs & wedding related items in the shophouses located along Smith Street. There is also a big market where many old shops have been there for a long time. It's definitely a good tour if it is your 1st time to Singapore. However, many of the places are not air conditioned & you might not want to go during noon time where the lunch crowd comes in from the offices nearby."
,,Beautiful; a jewel among gems,4.0,,"Singapore Chinatown is a lovely place to visit, shop and eat. The irony is that most of Singapore is one big Chinatown, but there is a special section in town called ""Chinatown"". You can easily catch the subway there and walk all around. It is also near the Riverwalk, so that is another sight to see at the same time. Be prepared for tired feet."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"Great neighborhood of Singapore - we loved the restored shophouses, the restaurants and markets, the temples... definitely visit Chinatown when you're in Singapore!"
,,"Best place foot sights, sounds and smells.",5.0,,One of my very favorite things to do in Singapore is to walk around China town. The exotic smells of local cooking are an attraction in its self. But the sights and sounds of this busy place are something to see. I don't always buy things but I always eat something. And if your a people watcher like me this is definitely your place.
,,Chinese New Yea Light Up,3.0,,"I think the main comcern here is the piles of trash left at almost every waste bins that need to be cleared regularly. Also, for safety, cars should not be allowed to continue to drive along the streets that already so crowded."
,,An unsurprising experience,3.0,,"Before even going to Chinatown I imagined what it may be like.To my surprise I wasn't wrong, lots of the same shops selling the same things. Chinatown lacks niche stores present in other 'Chinatowns' throughout the world. There are some unique stores like the TinTin Shop and some of the Catering Supply Shops that sell every kitchen utensil imaginable. Chinatown is easy to walk around and easy accessible by the MRT getting off at, you guessed Chinatown. A place to visit to tick off the places you have visited in Sinagpore."
,,A Truly Humble Experience,5.0,,"We visited twice in our week visit , daytime we visited the various temples, my favourite was the ""Tooth Temple"", it was a very humbling experience and an insight into the what the western world seems to be missing, the locals were fantastically friendly. When we were shopping, bartering was fun and eating at 'hawker places where you can buy local cuisine at amazingly low cost , delicious and probably some of the best food we tasted during our stay, Chinatown, properly explored is well worth the visit"
,,One of the best chinatowns,4.0,,"One of the best chinatowns in the world, though a bit touristy. Beautiful shophouses, lots of restaurants, and chinese men playing chinese games at the back of the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple."
,,Cheap Shopping,4.0,,Another Good place for cheap souvenirs and other gift items. Its a must visit place when in Singapore.
,,"Wonderful, atmospheric",5.0,,"A must do in Singapore, visit the Buddhist temple, peaceful oasis in a busy thoroughfare. Also China shopping mall, and the variety of restaurants is unbelievable."
,,A Singapore Classic,4.0,,"No visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to Chinatown. Mostly a night market tourist area, with very affordable souvenirs and clothes. You definitely won;t go hungry here either. Even as a vegetarian, there is a large vegetarian restaurant right at the entrance to the night market on Sago Rd, next to the Buddha's Tooth Relic Temple. Chinese lanterns and very old buildings are evident as you look up above the vendors, very photographic. Most of the trinkets for sale are what you would expect to see in a 'Chinatown"". Also you can watch the old men playing some sort of Chinese board games (?) or just people-watch. Also there is an Indian Temple and a Mosque to see as well."
,,China Town,4.0,,Look especially at the old houses above the market. Lovely area in parts to just look around at. Markets ok but don't expect bargains
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"We visited Chinatown twice on our recent trip to Singapore - a great place to pick up a few cheap souvenirs and enjoy a very reasonably priced meal. We had a dinner at one of the local restaurants at a cost of $15.50 for two adults and two small children - bargin!! The food was great, tasty and very quickly served. Make sure you choose a busy restaurant where there are plently of locals dining and you can't go wrong."
,,A great place to hang out in a busy city of Singapore,4.0,,"Despite of the mushrooming skyscrappers in Singapore, buildings in Chinatown are well preserved with own design and style. A lot of Chinese food here, ranging from local Singaporean Chinese food to Sichuan spicy food and the price is quite reasonable. Lively night market to walk around and shopping, bistros, massage, and fortune-telling"
,,great little taste of China,4.0,,I really enjoyed walking around by myself here for a few hours. the markets are a great place to pick up a few cheap souvenirs! there are a few attractions here too which are worth seeing!
,,A Fun Place to Spend a Few Hours - No Different to other Chinatowns,3.0,,"I am probably a little jaded as I word right next to Adelaide's Chinatown.

While I appreciate the Singapore version is bigger, probably more authentic and with a larger variety of goods I really don't know if I enjoyed my visit as much as someone who does not go to a Chinatown everyday would have.

On the plus side:
- Very cheap beer ($5.00 for a long neck) - Mr PugHugger enjoyed himself!
- The hawker food is fabulous, we ate ourselves silly, I am still a bit disgusted about how much I managed to put away! Fried and steamed dumplings, Hainese Chicken Rice and a 'Mee' something dish that I have regretfully forgotten the name of were the culprits of the day!
- Good fun to wander around.
- Easy to access via MRT or bus.

Negatives
- Its hot and not well air-conditioned. We were okay as we had been in humidity for a few weeks but it might be a bit much for a more sensitive person.
- The shopping centres seem to have nothing in them but phone and camera stalls and cheap (nasty) clothes and souvenirs. Fabulous if that is what you want but we were hoping for a more unique gift.
- While walking past the restaurants in the evening people try to drag you in, its the same in Clarke Quay sure but I personally do not like it and refuse to eat anywhere that does it as I assume the great places don't need to.
- On the Sunday lots of stalls especially in Hawker centres in the vicinity were closed which I was not expecting.
- The toilets are nasty, no other way to describe them.

All in all go for a couple of hours at least as the sights and sounds are good fun and interesting. For someone who has never experienced a Chinatown I can imagine it would have a greater impact. I still enjoyed it and would probably go back if I was in Singapore for a few days."
,,great in Chinese New Year,4.0,,This is a great place to visit during Chinese New Year.
,,Night Visit,4.0,,"We came here on an organised night tour. We thorughly enjoyed it, the stalls were all lit up and I bought some things to decrate my christmas tree. We were taken for a very good chinese meal and then we all got into a rickshaw and were taken back to Clark's Quay. Great fun and very noisy as each rickshaw had music blasting from speakers!"
,,A happy feeling of time well spent,5.0,,"With the Chinese accounting for virtually 75% of Singapore’s population, Chinatown is a must-see heritage locale. The easiest way to get there is on the MRT – the Chinatown MRT is in the middle of Pagoda Street, which is thankfully closed to traffic. The first impression that one gets of Chinatown is activity, colour and lots of life.

An eclectic mix of heritage, architecture, cuisine and shopping, Chinatown offers a fascinating insight into Singapore’s Chinese culture and history. Chinatown's primary attraction is itself, composed as it is of restored shophouses selling everything from the mundane to the sublime – your best bet is to wander where your feet take you and see what you can find!

Kreta Ayer is considered to be the heart of Chinatown since it is home to the Chinatown Heritage Centre, Chinatown Food Street and Chinatown Night Market – it is also a favoured place for local food. Telok Ayer is home to Chinese temples and old mosques that trace their origins to the earliest days of Chinatown. Pagoda Street which takes its name from the Sri Mariamman Temple is the hub of shopping especially from early evening onwards.

While it is impossible to be immune to the fascinating architecture of Chinatown, it is equally impossible to classify it since it seems to draw from both Occidental and Oriental inspirations.

Hint 1: A few of the must see heritage tourist spots at Chinatown are (a) Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, South Bridge Road (b) the Jamae Mosque on South Bridge Road (c) the Sri Mariamman Temple also on South Bridge Road (d) Chinatown Heritage Centre on Pagoda Street (e) Singapore Coin and Notes Museum (entrance from Pagoda Street) (f) Thian Hock Keng Temple on Telok Ayer Street

Hint 2: If you are looking for a place to stay in the midst of all the action, Chinatown offers some trendy boutique hotels such as The Scarlet, The Club and Hotel 1929. If on the other hand, you are looking for really economical accommodation, the edgy A Beary Good Hostel offers bunk beds at just SG$26 a night!

Hint 3: Do try the dim sum breakfast at Chinatown – I rate it a must do. Dim sum house options abound along Temple Street, Smith Street and Trengganu Street.

Hint 4: For lunch or dinner head to Maxwell Road Hawker Centre, that has over a hundred stalls, offering a mind boggling array of local food – I guarantee you will be spoilt for choice. Some of the must-try items here (recommended by all foodie blogs) include Tian Tian Chicken Rice, Congee with Pork, Fishball Noodles and Char Kway Teow. This hawker centre is open daily from 8am to 10pm

Hint 5: Smith Street, which has the nicest ambience amongst the food centres in Chinatown, closes to vehicular traffic after dusk - most Smith Street stalls are open for dinner only. Here multiple alfresco dining options that serve up all the popular local dishes are available.

Hint 6: For inexpensive souvenir and gift shopping, tourist friendly Pagoda Street is easily the best bet. For upmarket antique and handicrafts, South Bridge Road seems to be the place.

Hint 7: If you are a Tintin fan, I recommend the Tintin Store in Pagoda Street where you can pick up all kinds of really cool Tintin stuff, a good bit of it at pretty reasonable prices.

Hint 8: At various places in Chinatown, you are likely to be ambushed by tailors promising the most amazing fits and fabrics at supposedly throwaway prices – the advice we were given is don’t be tempted unless you happen to be with a well informed local person.

Hint 9: While we missed it, Chinatown is apparently at its busiest and most colorful in the month preceding the Chinese New Year, when lion dances and other street performances take place in festively decorated streets. So catch that if you can.

Exploring and experiencing Chinatown simply leaves you with the very happy feeling of time well spent."
,,excellent atmosphere,5.0,,"visited twice in our week visit , daytime we visited the temple , very humbling experience and an insight into the locals . nighttime visit we met family who took us shopping, bartering was fun and then we ate at an 'hawker' local cuisine at amazingly low cost , delicious and probably some of the best food we tasted during our stay.
both experiences fun, interesting and good memories"
,,Exciting,5.0,,"Chinatown wel we just loved it.Walking around all the stalls and the stall owners bargaining with you and all so nice about it. If they get a bit over bearing you buy you buy we would just say we just loooking and they were happy with that. We bought lots of lovely things form the markets, i picked up quite a few bargains for little gifts for my firends back home. We just loved wandering and stopped and had lunch in one of the little eating places in the market, we spent a good two to three hours there. If you want ot buy mobile phones ,i pads, etc go to Chinatown you will get a bargain for sure. There was so mcuh to do and see and found it very exciting and fasinating."
,,More like the Old Singapore that I remembered,5.0,,It was like going back in time. The lovely old shops. Lot of tourist tat but ignore that and just take in the atmosphere. Great big market where items aren't designer and priced out of the market. The Food Hall had a huge selection and very cheap. The hardest part would be making a choice there was so much and all looked fresh and tasty. The Buddhist Temple is a must see (Buddhist Tooth Relic Temple and Museum). EAsy to get to on underground.
,,"In Danger of Turning intgo ""Chinatown: The Theme Park""",4.0,,"Every time I come back to Singapore, the old shophouses are more gussied up, the hotels pricier, the drinks more expensive, and the feel less authentic. There are still some parts of real Chinatown around, some good old-fashioned cafes, the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a little over the top, but a great addition. But, still, I fear the trend. More and more Chinatown is a place most Singapporeans couldn't possibly afford to live in."
,,More varied than you realize at first,5.0,,"I've stayed in Chinatown and visited Chinatown in Singapore many times now, and each time I find something new that brings me pleasure. I'm not much of a shopper, but I love eating in Chinatown, especially at one of the places along Smith (Chinatown Food Street). Chinatown has been undergoing a revival and up grading, which is nice to see since it means those lovely old buildings will be around for the foreseeable future. Lots of charm, lots of complexity, lots of good food."
,,A must see for visitors,5.0,,The Singapore government has done a great job of preserving this cultural icon. Lots of fun little stalls and good cheap restaurants.
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"Chinatown was packed, but it is easy to get a chilly crab and authentic music from street vendors. Be caustion in the camera stalls, however, even though they represent name brands. Most of their wares, however, are non-branded items, which is what they will try to sell you. Don't fall for it."
,,Chinatown is not just the Pagoda Street area,4.0,,"Visiting Singapore Chinatown means almost automatically the Pagoda Street area with the shops and market stalls. Despite the fact that half of the shops deal with cameras and eager tailors who want to outfit you with new clothes overnight, this area is well worth a visit with the Chinese shop-houses, the market stalls and interesting buildings. Another part of Chinatown is the area around Far East Square, where ancient streets with shops and restaurants are enclosed with glass; you enter the complex through sliding doors and the whole street complex is air conditioned. If you want to see a completely different Chinatown, with far less tourists, you can stroll through the Bencoolen Street area. (Some pictures attached)."
,,Tacky trinkets to take back home,4.0,,"Chinatown should be visited at night under the red lanterns. Pagoda Street, Smith Street and Temple Street should be on your list for this experience. It doesn't feel like the old Singapore where dying people were left to spend their final days in the shophouses. But how can you miss a deal for 3 key chains for $10 as souvenirs for your friends back home? There are genuine articles too..try bargaining and you can use the miney saved for a Tiger beer in the heat of the night."
,,chinatown,2.0,,"the place is crowded . many pedlars. Noisy. Food centres are lacking in cleanliness, not to mention the undesirable condition of public areas and toilets."
,,went at night,5.0,,"went to a great resturant here its a hive of activity,great food and cheap...actually food in singapore is very good and cheap"
,,Hustle and bustle with good food and drink options,4.0,,Great range of stores in a marketplace like lay out. Wander up and down the streets and see what you find. If you stop and are interested in the chopstick seller or the herbalist people are interested in you as well. Worth putting aside 2-3 hours to wander around.
,,Chinatown tour Singapore,4.0,,"The Tour East Chinatown night tour of Singapore is a good experience. We were picked up by car and driven to the Singapore Flyer (ferris wheel) where we got on a bus and were taken to Chinatown. Our guide was knowledgeable and pleasant and she gave us some history of Singapore. We stopped at a little Chinese shop where we could each give a gentleman our first name and he painted it on a fan in chinese letters and we got to keep the fan. We were then taken around the corner and upstairs into an old chinese restaurant and the food was okay. Then we were left to shop for about 40 minutes before being taken to by trishaw to Clarke Quay. There were about 30 in our group and each trishaw (bicycle with a sidecar) took 2 passengers. The riders then pedalled us out of Chinatwon, down the main road to Clarke Quay. Each trishaw has its own rock n roll music and it was quite a sight to see about 15 of them racing each other down the main road with Elvis and Neil Sedaka etc belting out at mega decibels. Our little Singaporean riders were amazing (ours was a toothless little man of about 60 with a wide grin) and they genuinely enjoyed the trip and had great fun in racing each other. If you're the type who worries about changing lanes in front of buses and cutting cars off and disobeying every traffic law ever written, this is not the trip for you - it's white knuckle stuff. We were taken to Clarke Quay where we were given a ferry ride of the harbour. A most enjoyable night out."
,,Great visit - even better at night,5.0,,"We had a great visit in Chinatown, truly authentic and opened till late at night. Plenty of food selection."
,,Great place for the tourist,5.0,,"Chinatown is one of the oldest places in Singapore but its more or less a tourist destination only. Its the cheapest place to buy souvenirs in Singapore. The street food there is also quite decent and offers all sorts of food from Chinese to Indian to European. Do visit the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, the Sri Mariamman Temple, and the Masjid Jamae Chulia."
,,Some amazing places to eat and bargains to be had!,4.0,,"Great place to walk around for the smells and sights, especially at night when the lanterns are on. The restaurants here go from basic street food to high end, and all looked amazing. The ones in particular we went in were excellent. It is well located to Boat/Clark Quay and is a nice walk in the evening. We got some great bargains there on electrical goods and clothes, a super experience."
,,NightMarket Finds,4.0,,"Avoid to hussle and extra charges of Orchard Road. The stalls are open late and if you have the time to walk around and comparison shop, you will get good deals"
,,A mini night market you can explore in less than an hour,3.0,,"Singapore's Chinatown doesn't look any different from the night markets of Taiwan, HK or Thailand. The usual souvenirs items like t-shirts, key chains, ref magnets, etc. are all on sale, plus chopsticks in all designs and colors!

Also located there was the Chinatown cultural museum that one can visit for only S$10, but from 10 am to 6 pm only. There were also the usual street food stalls selling Singapore dishes of noodles and seafood in hot or hotter variety. We enyojed going around the market and shopping for stuff to bring back home, and of course, eating whatever caught our fancy. But since I'm sort of a night market veteran, I found Singapore's Chinatown pretty small. I remember raoming around Pat Pong or Shih lin or Temple St. night markets for hours until my feet were swollen from too much walking and standing!

Still, Chinatown offers value for your money that you'll be hard pressed finding in pricey Singapore."
,,Great food,3.0,,"But very touristy, worth it to get souvenirs at very cheap prices. Remember to head to Maxwell Hawker centre to get checked out!"
,,Amazing,4.0,,I really enjoyed Chinatown. The warmth of the buildings and authenticity created a great ambience. I've seen other Chinatown's before that simply consist of a fountain and couple of chinese eateries so seeing streets lined with lanterns and colourful heritage buildings meant great photographs.
,,A different experience in the middle of the city,4.0,,Chinatown is a different experience from the hustling bustling city of singapore..the old heritage buildings with colourful window add a different colour to the tall business centers around it..visit the chinese templeand the nagore dargah built by sea farers long ago to thank when they reach the shores safe...
,,Overpriced and overated.,2.0,,"We are regular visitors to Singapore and this last visit in June 2012 to Chinatown was disappointing.It is very overpriced and crammed with tourist junk! It's a good look and on the tourist list but be wary of the inflated prices.Ignore the shopkeepers ""fixed price"" mantra and offer less! I would not recommend buying a suite or coat here as my recent experience suggests you will pay a top price but not a reasonable one. The food is good, and try to eat in Smith Street from the small stalls rather than the big tourist shops. You can catch the marvellous MRT right into Chinatown and the tourist two or three day pass is the way to go."
,,No longer authentic,3.0,,"Plenty of well-preserved shop houses; lots of tourist tatt; some OK food stalls. Go at Chinese New Year or the Mid-Autumn Festival or to visit the Hindu Sri Mariammam Temple, otherwise don't bother. For a more authentic experience, go to Geylang."
,,Great for bargains,4.0,,Great place to wander around and soak up some atmosphere. bargains to be had bu take caret fakes are everywhere so be warned
,,clean busy street,4.0,,"like: clean busy street, affordable tasty food...."
,,Cleanest and most Organized Chinatown EVER!,5.0,,"Well there's tons of chinatowns elsewhere but this one shares the characteristics that the rest of Singapore has. I'm not quite sure what to make of it though, it's not very bustling area nor does it have that chaotic yet charming atmosphere that I envision most Chinatown to have. In other words, it feels rather dull and boring. On the plus side it is very tourist friendly with a lot of certified establishments from restaurants, snack shops, specialty stores, etc."
,,nothing special,2.0,,"i thought chinatown was nothing special to see. we didn't went for eating so i don't know about that but there was nothing special to see/visit in chinatown. They have a lot of stores and restaurants, so if you are going for that i' m sure it won't be disappointing."
,,Don't forget it,5.0,,"Cinatown is clean and well organised, It's China in Singapore especially during the night"
,,Strange to have a chinatown in china,3.0,,"I guess the way Singapore has dismantled all of its original structure a small area as a ""disney-like"" experience is more for tourists rather than for locals."
,,The Same Chinatown,3.0,,"This is just the same Chinatown I visited in another countries. Same Chinese herbal scent and almost the same Chinese shops.
Since this is Singapore, the Chinatown layout is neat and not so crowded compared to other Chinatown.
If you want to buy chinese herbal medicines, go to Chinatown. They have many shops selling herbal medications. You can also buy bakwa here, a local delicacy. I personally like bakwa made by Lim Chee Guan. They only have 2-3 stalls in Singapore and you can get it here."
,,Very Very Busy,3.0,,"I was very hot, very busy and very sweaty. I went when it was chinese new year and it was very pretty. Having been to many China Town's over the world, I don't think this on was too different.

Worth a visit, and the food isn't too bad."
,,Red Chinese Lanterns Made My Day,2.0,,"Except for those Red Chinese Lanterns and silk scarves which are very costly as compared to other silk scarves sold at other countries Vietnam for example, I don't find anything worth visiting at Chinatown.."
,,Interesting,4.0,,We found it a great place for a visit. Lots of stalls to get bargains at and many cheap places to eat delicious food. Must visit while in Singapore.
,,Fantastic Chinatown,5.0,,"Chinatown was the real surprise packet of our trip. It was much nicer, cleaner and friendlier than I expected it to be. Many bargains to be had here. Get a suit made at Happy Harry's Tailor shop on South Bridge Road (between the Indian and Buddhist Temples). There is so much to see in and around the maze of side streets. We visited Chinatown about 4 times on our holiday. Excellent."
,,Great,5.0,,"Excellent atmosphere and Market, also has a Tin Tin shop."
,,Authentic and cheap food,4.0,,"We had a nice time tasting authentic, tasty and reasonably-priced dishes at the food stalls located in the People's Park."
,,Good Chinese food but the wine was not served correctly,4.0,,"Ate at a restaurant in Chinatown. This restaurant has been at the same location for more than 83 years. They were offering 83 cent pecking duck for spending more than $83. This was easy as we had 6 people in the party. Ordered white fish, pecking duck, soup, veggie, egg rolls and some sort of pork dish. Also ordered a bottle of Australian red wine. To my surprise, the red wine was chill. They kept the wine in a cooler along with other soft drinks. When I sipped into to it, I couldn't really taste the wine. Little disappointed but great food."
,,Interesting to walk around,5.0,,"There was a fascinating museum in Chinatown: the Chinatown Heritage Centre. That was excellent. I visited this my first time to Singapore in 2008. If you like history, I highly recommend it."
,,Great area especially at night,4.0,,"Great restaurants (great Peking duck), bars and atmosphere"
,,Fun!,5.0,,"At night Chinatown comes to life with its red lanterns and pretty shop front houses (look up above the souvenir shops!). Lots of shopping in the area, i bought some beaded bracelets and a skirt. A good variety of interesting things to buy, we also bought paint brushes with the bristles made from wolves hair. There are pretty kids clothes, tea sets, lanterns and lots more. The Tin Tin store is located on Pagoda street, open till 9pm though. A few food places in the area, the buckets of ice beer was appealing. The train station is right in China town, only a minute from Clarke Quay."
,,Only here for the food,3.0,,"Not exceptional compared to other Chinatowns in other cities, but the food is so delicious."
,,30 for ten dolar,5.0,,"a place its great!!! we found all the cheap things here, key chain 30 pieces only 10 dolar..wow. Great mosque for pray.."
,,"Colour, congestion and chaos.",4.0,,"This area of Singapore reflects the Chinese shopping culture in that the small shops line the streets and bargaining is de rigeur. Fun to stroll along the streets, grab a bite to eat in one of the 'hawker fare' areas and just people watch.
After the sun goes down is a good time to visit."
,,Great location for a visit,5.0,,We found Chinatown really interesting and enjoyed walking around the stalls. Don't miss!
,,Fun area to explore,4.0,,This is a fun area to wander around and explore. Many shops and hundreds of restaurants.
,,Food street is not to be missed,5.0,,Food Street is exactly what the name says. Great restaurants for authentic Chinese food. Also fantastic shopping in Chinatown.
,,Love Chinatown.,4.0,,Love the dim sum and the bragains. Also the Heritage museum is fascinating.
,,Beautiful buildings,4.0,,Went for the evening market. Lovely and very interesting buildings
,,"Temples, food and more",4.0,,Lot's of good places to eat and there is a fantastic Buddhist temple as well as a Hindu temple (we ran out of time so could not visit this). You can also buy cheap gifts for people here.
,,Regular- Chinatown,4.0,,"This is the place to go for your Singapore souvenirs and other tiny handicrafts or electronics items. Food is also available but not restaurant style.. In the weekends,it is crowded. Since most of it is outdoor it is very hot."
,,Lacking in atmosphere,3.0,,A pity that this area has been remodelled. It is so different from the early years and the atmosphere is not like a cluttered and bustling Chinatown of old. These days the shops are all selling similar merchandise and it becomes a little boring. Still worth a visit. There is more character and authenticity in Little India which is worth visiting.
,,Find good food and shop for cheap stuff,3.0,,This is the place to find good food and to shop at a lower level of price compared to other areas in Singapore.
,,A must to do,5.0,,Chinatown is a fantastic place to visit. It has a great atmosphere and certainly allows a look into some of singapores past. There are plenty of places to eat and some great shops. It's best to visit Chinatown in the evening and give yourself plenty of time to just stroll around and look.
,,Serious Shopping,5.0,,"This is the place to go for your Singapore souviners, and any thing else you could imagine, it is crowded, it is hot, it is safe, just be firm with no if you are not interested in their wares, but they are all polite and helpful. Big thin I found was multiple items for a set amount, so I ended up with a heap of stuff but what the heck this was Singapore."
,,Authentic Chinatown,3.0,,"The streets and food area are a bit unclean but that is expected of chinatown. If you brave these, it is well worth the shopping and sights not to mention the reasonable prices of wares and food which are all very tasty. Old men sitting on stools beside houses and gambling on the center square makes good photographs. Colorful silks, very cheap t-shirts and jade for sale. A good way to spend an afternoon."
,,Typical chinatown,4.0,,We found some good eat places here and it is your very typical chinatown.Also lots of shops.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Anything you ever didnt want is available here and remember to bargain. You will need a few hours looking around and there are dozens of great food places also. Try the seafood restaurant on the corner, fresh good quality asian food and a very reasonable price. Also keep an eye out for the German sausage stall, he is world famous in Chinatown."
,,Charming and well-maintained!,5.0,,"Lots of interesting shophouses and things to buy. The streets are clean and well organized, with beautiful temples nearby."
,,Have a Beer and watch the World Go By,4.0,,"When we visit we have taken to stopping by Chinatown and having a beer and just watching the passing crowds. The place is full of tat of course but it's still a good experience for the kids, who love the Tintin shop (probably the only authentic thing there)."
,,Bright & cheerful,5.0,,"There are loads of things to see here including some beautiful temples, the shop houses are full of silks and tat but there are some nice souveniers here. The shops behind the stalls are more expensive & once they've got you in they will try & sell you other things! Try the Chili Crab at China town Seafood restaurant in the center of the stalls- it's fantastic but make sure you have plenty of fried buns for the sauce!"
,,cheap eats and lots of souvenirs,4.0,,Go to Chinatown for the best souvenirs and cheap Chinese cuisine. If you want to see the more authentic lifestyle head for the square at the buddah tooth relic temple where old Chinese men play Go and you can find the wet market there.
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,From clothing to trinkets you will be driven mad by stallholders. At least a dozen guys will want to measure you for a suit and have it ready tomorrow. But it's all good clean fun. When you tire of them go to the Chinese Cultural Museum and the Buddist Museum.
,,Loved Chinatown,5.0,,"Spent a day exploring this interesting and diversified area. Had a great lunch, explored numerous markets, stores and street vendors. A highlight of our stay. Don't visit Singapore without touring Chinatown."
,,shopping spree,4.0,,"Find cheap stuffs to buy here, coz the proce doesn't get better then this!"
,,Kitsch paradise,4.0,,"Just as any other Chinatown around asia, this is the place to find all your kitsch souvenirs. There's also a huge foodcourt you can go to to try out a variety of cheap local cuisine, not just chinese. The architecture in some places is really nice too, with old colourful houses which contrast with the fields of skyscrapers around you!"
,,Enjoyed the area! Great food everywhere,5.0,,"Temples, food,food, shopping, fantastic trains in Singapore,easy to get around !"
,,nice time in china town,4.0,,found several great deals on having a few shirts made. great material and fast turn around. 4 shirts and 2 pants with silk tie for 385S$. great food
,,Go see this great place,5.0,,"Did a tea ceremony there and learned a lot. What a fantastic experience. The place is very interesting, especially the food, kitchen ware shops and tea rooms."
,,"Rip off, not a good chinatown.",2.0,,"Got very ripped off by the restaurant next to the National Chinese Heritage Museum, the food we wanted they didn't have (basic curries and desserts), charged a fortune for bad quality food, charge $3.50 plus the tax for water! Not as good variety of chinese food as I expected, just cheap knick knacks."
,,every night,5.0,,We spent every night back in Chinatown. The food and beer were heaps cheaper and it had a real atmosphere.
,,Kitschy knick knack town,2.0,,"This may be the most boring Chinatown-all you see is store after store of chinese souvenirs that you can buy in any Chinatown worldwide (some Singaporean souvenirs). The restaurants are mostly for ""Steamboat"" (hotpot). Maybe the best things to do here is to buy cheesy souvenirs and perhaps visit the wet market (go in the morning)."
,,Great food.,5.0,,Shopping was OK but if you want a great meal then this is a must to visit. So many choices of good restaurants.
,,Very different,5.0,,We loved Chinatown good bargains & good food two train stops from Hotel
,,Cheap & Cheerful,5.0,,"If Orchard Road isn't to your pockets fancy, then stroll into Chinatown! Cheap & cheerful Chinese goods, food, drinks & even massages. Don't miss the Chinatown Heritage Centre showcasing the old Chinatown. Colorful streets & colorful people, don't miss it!"
,,Secret of the Red Lantern,4.0,,"It is a differnt sight when you go in the night. Street hawker zone is full of people with a variety of sight,smell and flavours. During the day do not miss the visit to the Buddha temple and its calm atmosphere inside."
,,Have a visit.,4.0,,"Chinatown is still full of bargains (if you barter), good atmosphere, good beer!"
,,"India meets China, culturally",4.0,,Loved the atmosphere and was fascinated by the Chinese people worshiping at the Indian Buddhist/Sikh temple.
,,Nice place to visit to take in some culture in Singapore,4.0,,"Spending an hour or two in Chinatown Singapore is a worthwhile experience. It's a bit touristy, but fun to stroll the streets. Lots of trinkets to buy, and you can sit outside for a cold beverage and snack before hopping back on the MRT to your next stop."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Best place to get souveniers so much cheaper than anywhere else. Good cheap places to eat as well.
,,Good bargains,4.0,,"Good place for souvenirs and bargains and easy to find your way around. Perfumes cheap. Try haggling prices, the vendors are usually ok to bargain with you and always very keen to get you in their shop."
,,china town,5.0,,we went to china town twice during our visit day and night. Had a great meal in the dat but the nightime is when chinatown really comes alive. reccomend this area for a visit
,,the porridge opposite Pearl centre (corner shop) is highly recommended,4.0,,Rude people in Singapore that disregard traffic rules
,,Not a lot of traditional Chinese charm here,3.0,,"30 years ago a trip to Singapore's Chinatown was like stepping back in time. It seems to have become a tourist trap over the years. Wall to wall shops with overly aggressive sales people, most of whom are not even Chinese.

The Maxwell Road Centre is still worth a visit. It still maintains some of the old charm. Explore the great variety of produce and meats on the bottom floor and then head upstairs to enjoy some of the stalls in the hawker centre. Yum!"
,,Good quality and value for local fare,5.0,,"The place to get the famous local fare like bak kut the, chicken rice etc. Good quality and value."
,,Crowded and have evrything!,3.0,,"Well, if you want to find anything related to chinese stuff, this is the place, especially near to chinese new year. But beware of the heat and the packed people"
,,Nice place,3.0,,"Good to walk around but with high temperatures and humidity it can get a little ""sticky"" with lots of tourists looking for bargains."
,,Rich with culture,5.0,,"Take the Chinatown MRT and step directly onto the streets of Chinatown. There are lots of shops, plenty sidewalk restaurants and even a temple."
,,Sky's the limit shopping :-000,5.0,,"value for money shopping... great chinese food amongst the hustle and bustle, try chilli crab- amazing!"
,,Sanitised version of China?,4.0,,"Singapore is a strange place.

The taxi drivers are amazingly helpful and cheap. All are very proud of their country or at least claim to be whether they are Chinese, Malay , Indonesian or whatever. They speak generally very very good English

Service elsewhere varies. The tourist places seem to have a shortage of English speakers, especially in the new places

Chinatown is one of the key places and is mixed between the tourist bit around the Chinese heritage centre and the authentic bit which is cheaper a bit smellier but interesting

For a city where 75% are Chinese it is a bit odd to have a china town, but they do along with a little India, we'll worth a vist and an Arab area

You see more of what Singapore is like if you travel well away from the touristy areas where you can see what people are so proud of

Singapore is a modern green pretty city where if you work hard you can be successful. People seem to be generally as free as they chose to be

Finally nothing is cheap, a bit like Dubai but if you want sanitised Asia this is it."
,,Too overcrowded and smelly,3.0,,To my mind I find it too overcrowded and smelly but different people think differently
,,A neat experience,5.0,,Chinatown was one of my favourite parts of Singapore. Great shopping for souvenirs. You must sit and have a coconut juice. And definitely eat at the Maxwell hawkers.
,,Very cool place with some good bargain finds,5.0,,You can find all sorts of good memento or trinkets at Chinatown. the prices are pretty good too (but be sure to bargain for best deals.) The streets are very clean and the overall area is very well organized with great restaurants. Highly recommended!
,,average market,3.0,,"Having been to Vietnam prior to SIngapore, we found the market pretty average and over priced."
,,just chinatown,4.0,,typical china town with many places to eat and shopping.
,,"Just another Chinatown, nothing special",3.0,,I guess once you have seen a few Chinatowns there just about the same. We thought the one in Bangkok was far more interesting.
,,Great,4.0,,Colourful as you'd expect. Really good bargains and you can barter. Food was lovely and reasonable.
,,Worth a short visit,3.0,,"We spent an hour or so walking round the couple of temples, the street market and the shops in this area. It gets repetative pretty quickly, but was enjoyable. Beware if you get a taxi back to your hotel from this area, we ended up with a driver who had never been to sentosa and basically couldnt drive! I got the impression that the chinese community within china town were very insular and didn't know the rest of Singapore which given the size of the place is rather surprising!"
,,Fun place to shop,4.0,,This is a fun place to shop. Many of the stalls sell similar items so you have opportunity to bargain.
,,Great place to shop for souvenirs,4.0,,"Since we were planning to go overseas to meet up with some friends, we decided to visit Chinatown to shop for some souvenirs. We went around 7 plus in the evening and had so much fun going from shop to shop. Most things are sold at $10 for 3 items and there is quite a variety of gifts you can choose from : bags, purses, cushion covers, table runners etc. All the items are tagged and priced so there is no need to worry about being cheated or having to bargain. The shop owners leave you to browse through their items and do not pressure you to buy from them. The overall experience was pleasant."
,,For the Culture Vulturs!,5.0,,"China Town - like any other in different cities - caters to not only the Chinese community but also to Tamil Indians. The oldest Hindu temple - The Mariamman temple is situated right in the heart of China Town! Besides clothes, knick knacks, food, you will find traditional Gold shops, where you can buy pure gold ornaments, coveted by Indians and Chinese alike."
,,"Tacky, but fun!",4.0,,"Lots of trinket stalls, but still enough architecture remaining to give you a glimpse of the past"
,,Where the rich go to shop,3.0,,"Not my favourite place, it was good to people watch for a bit and then it got boring, so many better places to go see in Singapore"
,,Best place in Singapore,5.0,,Great place for shopping or eating. I highly recomend Chinatown Seafood Restaurant.
,,shops and more shops,3.0,,"Although a lovely place to visit with the temples and hawker centres it is also full of tiny shops and markets. I am giving this an average due to the shops not offering much to the tourist.
A few years back you could get a very good bargain for electrical items in China Town, not so much now. Some shops are not even interested in coming down in price and instead charging a silly amount for something you can buy cheaper in the UK. Just be wary when buying such things always check prices back at home and if you have internet on your mob check while in store - also be wary of items that are too cheap... if its too hard to believe than it probably is."
,,Fine for a tourist,4.0,,"The shophouses in the Chinatown area give this place character and is worthy of a wander, even if many of them sell stuff you can find in markets elsewhere in the region. Still a place for a visual idea of how life might have been in the past. Food here is good and the choices, endless. Hop over to People's Park and that place is another shopping institution too! Back in its heyday."
,,The Best part of SG!,5.0,,"Everything about Chinatown was wow. The food choices range from croc meat to simple seafood. I would surely try more the next time.
The street is so well lit up and the old Chinese buildings look awesome. And don't miss the Tintin shop if you are a fan of the little guy!"
,,Just fantastic,5.0,,This was the best part of our trip.....lovely little shops for the kids to roam and cold beer for us!
,,Colorful experience,3.0,,"Great shops for souvenir and maybe the cheapest place to shop by far that I know in Singapore. Great food stalls and restaurant for those who loves Chinese food, not bad the Thai's too. Had my late lunch at Sawasdee's Thai Restaurant there, cheap and friendly owner too. There is Tintin Shop for those who love that Belgium's comic character. Loved the old shop's building, colorful and well-maintained."
,,Chinatown,3.0,,Not too exciting.... bit bored.... For over more than 10 years not much different... and they need to make a big make over.
,,Very close to being in China!,4.0,,So many great shops and fantastic deals to be had!
,,Enjoy the experience,4.0,,All china towns are similar but this one was a bit special in atmosphere . Also some good deals especially in things like IPADs. Plus there was a cafe selling cold lagers at less than 3pounds a litre. Cheapest in SIngapore
,,Cheap and fun,5.0,,"Chinatown brings a little of China and a lot of souveniers fro you!!! If you want a place to buy (cheap) gifts from your journey you will find here!
Once you bargain you should buy it, so if you don't like this kind of place, avoid it.
I had a great time =)"
,,Lively Place - Recommend for Night,4.0,,"Its one of the best place to visit at night.
Place is very live and active during night...You can do lot of things...go for street shoping...hv a looks at latest electronic gadget...or just simply enjoy wide variety of awesome foods..

If you are in Singpore during Chinese new year then this place is simply superbbbb...

there are lot of acoomodation option available ranging from 1 star property to 5 star property..."
,,"Love, no matter how often I visit",5.0,,"After Arab Street, Chinatown is my favourite place to go. It is excellent for cheap shopping with the notable exception of the Tintin shop - which is not cheap by any stretch of the imagination but a true delight if you're a Tintin fan.
Chinatown is also good for great food - visit the little German kiosk for a fix of sausages and bread and don't miss the small restaurants on Smith Street to enjoy great Sichuan and Northern Chinese food. Old Chengdu restaurant near the MRT exit is also fantastic - but beware of the sichuan peppercorn and go only if you can take really spicy & hot food.
Chinatown is also worth a visit during the Chinese New Year, when it gets lit up and hosts the parade."
,,"If you like markets, you'll love this.",3.0,,"China Town either appeals to you, or it doesn't. The fact that it didn't appeal to me is in no way because this a poor attraction in Singapore. The markets were very interesting, but be prepared for a lot of pressure from the stall holders and the hawkers."
,,Food and Juices fresh and cheap,5.0,,"all kinds of tasty local foods and juices and prices that you can barely believe, and the atmosphere is authentic."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Any Chinatown in various cities in the world never fails to amaze me what with it's various shops and restaurants. What fascinated me more in Singapore's Chinatown are the various shop houses which have been preserved. The area is fairly clean.
,,China Town,5.0,,Loved the bustle of this place and the little shops and stalls selling all sorts of interesting bits and pieces. Lovely little eating places too.
,,Six hours of more...,5.0,,"You must have in mind that when going with your family to Chinatown you will have the need to be patient :) there you will find so many nice things to buy and to enjoy that time will fly and your wallet will be in panic :) It is a safe place, very charming, many shops of all sorts and they will also tell you some - partially true, partially small lies from colorful sales people - about the stuff they sell. Quality might be of the different sort, but take it with a smile and chose wisely."
,,The traditional Singapore lives on ....,5.0,,We love Chinatown. Its markets. Its shop houses. The food. The sights. This is where you get a sense of the old Singapore. Clinging on defiantly. Wander the streets here. Morning. Afternoon. Night. Always different. Always alluring.
,,OLD CHINA WITH MODERN TOUCH,4.0,,Lots of unique stores and very comfortable place to shop. Cheap price makes everyone loves to come and shop there. With it's unique modern touch makes the old building looks fine. Tips: You can bargain as low as you can... SHOP TILL YOU DROP! ;)
,,"OK, but better in KL",3.0,,"Was good, but small and not very atmospheric, better in KL"
,,Great experince,5.0,,"OK Chinatown is touristy, but so what. You HAVE to visit the wet market there though. the most interesting part of it is at the bottom floor, so do not be fooled by the cloth stalls on the ground floor. First go downstairs (attention is closes really early once they sold their stock) and then go to the 3rd level and get some great chinese grub"
,,China Town,5.0,,"China Town is definitely worth a visit. Beer is half the price than it is in the city and the stalls are plentiful. Getting there is very easy, using the hop on/hop off bus. Try the food at one of the locals and it is cheap and good."
,,A bit artificial,3.0,,"Not as authentic as Little India, Chinatown is now populated by modern eateries and booths selling touristy kitsch. Although if you look hard enough, you may still find some gems such as Da Zhong Guo, a traditional Chinese pastry shop, which also sells very popular mooncakes during the mid-autumn festival."
,,Good fun for souvenirs,4.0,,Buy your cheap souvenirs here. Good to know there are no imitation goods in Singapore.
,,Give me back the old Chinatown,2.0,,This place has lost its quaintness due to overcrowding with shops and eateries catering more to the tastes of people from the People's Republic of China rather than to local Singaporeans.
,,Chinatown interesting,4.0,,"The little shops in chinatown had a great variety of items, and we enjoyed poking about there far more than Orchard road. Lanterns made it feel quite festive, and we found a wonderful place to lunch."
,,manageable,4.0,,Coming from Hong Kong I was not too interested in China Town and didn't spend a lot of time there but my first impression was good. It looks nice and is not too big. Good to see.
,,very interesting little part of Singapore,4.0,,loved the street scene. Was good just walking browsing the stalls. Quite cheap too. Try the pork jerky
,,good for a couple of hours walk,5.0,,"Spend a couple of hours walking around China Town. Great for tasting different foods, looking at souvenirs and Chinese knick knack... The colours are fascinating and so are the jars with pickled snakes and ginseng!! A funny place to get a small insight to Chinese culture. You will see the older men playing games on the streets next to stalls and in between small temples.
A must see - and taste- in Singapore..."
,,Great Shopping Experience,4.0,,"I always thought Singapore was very expensive but the Chinatown experience changed my view of the country....of three countries I visited last April of 2012, it was in Singapore Chinatown that I bought a lot...who would not be tempted of souvenir items marked 3 for SGD 10 and 30 for SGD 10..and my friends in Singapore said the prices are much lower a week before Christmas...that gives me an idea"
,,Very cool part of Singapore...,4.0,,"We caught a taxi here from the airport in between flights, and are so glad we did; what a wonderful, bustling piece of Singapore this is! The womenfolk in the family shopped without having to keep track too much of the spending as everything is so cheap; they all have some lovely Chinese style clothing!
The temple of the Buddhas tooth is just so serene in the heart of the hustle and bustle that for that alone, it is worth a visit, then the charm makes its impact....
If you have some time to kill, then this is worth it...."
,,Bargains,4.0,,Goods are cheap. Food is authentic. Love the hotpot.
,,always a fun place to visit,4.0,,"Great food, fun shopping, lots of jewelry supplies, fabric and crafts. Also beautiful temples to visit."
,,Traditional Shops in Chinatown,5.0,,"Singapore Chinatown is constantly changing - I hope the traditional shops such as the medicine shops, furniture, arts and crafts, tea rooms, Chinese restaurants are retained. Visit the traditional locales vs the commercial venues to get a ""feel"" for true Chinatown. Stop in at Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, sip on young coconut, indulge in dim sum, check out the wet market and the local HDB shops."
,,RE: Old is preserved,4.0,,"The old building gives you the charm of Singapore, I loved it.. It is another place to do your shopping, for the budget conscious, this is the place."
,,enchanting,4.0,,lots of things to be explored and seen inside Singapore's Chinatown. you can find very delicious foods inside a small restaurant and even find a very great bargain from a store nearby.
,,Chinatown,5.0,,There is a buzz about this place and you feel safe even walking about at night.
,,Chinatown Tourist Information Centre,5.0,,"The Service at the Chinatown Tourist Information Centre was amazing, the staff are so helpful and efficient. Jesslyn and Clement went out of their way to help us when booking tours.
We booked the Singapore Zoo tour and Singapore flyer tickets. Easiest way to get tickets for any tours in Singapore. Would highly recommend any travellers to use this service.

Also would recommend Chinatown as a great place to stay whilst in Singapore; great street food, locals fantastic, beautifully restored buildings, fun night market, the whole area just has loads of character.

Caroline"
,,You could get lost!,5.0,,"I like spending time in Chinatown with the small crowded streets, excellent dim sum, awesome street food, and blending in with tourists. The temple in Chinatown is not what you would expect and is a total contrast to the mayhem on the streets below. It is like a quiet sanctuary giving you respite from the craziness that most Chinatowns attract. No better place for you try the famous Singapore Chili Crab."
,,Shopping,4.0,,"Lots of cheap stuff, and you need to inspect the clothing items carefully for faults before you buy. Bargaining is the order of the day. Remember - you get waht you pay for...."
,,Fantastic food malls there,5.0,,Brill but not too sure what was in most of the dishes!
,,nice area,5.0,,"nice litle Chinese shops alway's good to walk arround, have a meal on the side of the street and enjoy the location"
,,Good night market,4.0,,Walked down from our hotel. Lots of shops and market stalls selling souvenirs and Chinese goods. Plenty of places to eat especially on Food Street! Worth doing in the evening.
,,Chilly Crab,4.0,,Well done up tourist friendly strip now with traditonal shop fronts with Chinese influence. Still has Chilly Crab restaurant along the street to give it that old Singapore flavour. The Tiger tooth temple still there. The rest is now a tourist trap.
,,Tourist Trap... Unless you know what to look for.,4.0,,"Well this is an obvious tourist trap but you might want to check out a few things:

1. TinTin Shop: Yes, this is a shop with collector's items and memorabilia for everyone. It's pretty much hidden so you got to keep a sharp eye. It is on the left if you are coming from the MRT station.

2. The Buddist Temple. We were lucky enough to pop in and have monks chanting so it was definitely a refreshing experience.

3. The Indian temple. No visit is complete though the indian temple charges SD3 to bring your camera in and SD6 for video cameras. You have to take off your shoes as well in the indian temple."
,,The real deal!,4.0,,"Singapore Chinatown was easy walking, a little crowed in places but for the most part enjoyable. Vendors were willing to compromise on prices.....some of it was nice and also had souvenir type stuff. There were plenty of places to eat, if you could get past some of the smells. Jewelry and jade was
abundant. There are a couple of temples in the area to view. Taxis are also available."
,,Loved it,5.0,,"Just loved Chinatown - Cheap food - good shopping and icy cold beer,"
,,Very nice place to visit and get Dim Sum!,5.0,,"Ate at Yum Cha Restaurant in Chinatown, at #20 Trengganu Street ... very good food!"
,,Very small and commercial,3.0,,"The Chinatown area is quite small and while retaining some of the old buildings, it is largely a collection of stalls selling cheap clothes and collectables. A couple of shops worth mentioning - A TinTin shop specialising in collectables and the Singapore coffee shop with a different take in this popular western beverage."
,,Colourful,3.0,,Liked the food disliked the cheap souvenier shops where have all the interesting shops gone. Chinatown is full of the same things shop after shop - boring.........
,,Excellent Place,5.0,,"Great place with lots of restaurants and stalls around, hanging lanterns and bottles of Tiger beer for $5.90, the cheapest around!"
,,Nice part of Singapore,4.0,,"You can find here the good and cheap Chinese food, nice shops and there is a beautiful Chinese temple."
,,"China town, mysterius and cheap.",5.0,,"Good dining,cheap clothing,exiting atmosphere. I never go tired of this place."
,,good experience,3.0,,"good for a lazy stroll , some shopping and lots of eats and cheap beer."
,,Cheapest dinner around ...,5.0,,"We went to Chinatown in order to eat at one of the food courts (my wife had never experienced these). Dinner came to around $12 (£6) and the food was beautiful (Po Piah, Yong Tau Fu and sugar cane juice to drink). Obviously, the eating area is a bit basic - don't expect table cloths etc. - but the value for money food and the sheer experience are not to be missed. The rest of Chinatown is really worth wandering around - on the edge is the Sri Mariammen Hindu temple, and there are many shops and traditional Chinese herbal shops."
,,Extraordinary Shopping,5.0,,Chinatown has everything you are looking for .. plus THE tastiest array of food from which to choose when you're feeling hungry!!
,,Singapore's Unique Chinatown,4.0,,"Most country has a Chinatown, in multi racial Singapore, this IS a place tourist can't miss (bring yr camera). From quaint to nostalgic, rustic, yet modern. Let me go thru by areas.

U should explore large area and it overlaps the business district. From Tanjong Pagar mrt, u can walk to White House building, pass Red Dot Museum (bars come alive at night), and u will see Maxwell food centre, which has a huge selection of local fare, opposite is sago st which has alfresco dining, surrounding it u can find restaurants. There's at least two vegetarian restaurants in that vicinity.

Check out the Buddha Relic Temple and Sri Mariamman Hindu Temple.

Ann Siang Hill and Club is a great place for late night drinks, there's many choices for italian/french restaurants, cafes. The shophouse style district is very pretty. The shops there sells unique/exclusive items which cannot be bought elsewhere, ranging from staioneries, bags, earrings and novelty items. There's also shop selling vintage clothings (7 Ann Siang Hill). Go further to Neil Rd and Duxton, there's a mixture of dodgy pubs, night club, karoke bars, restaurants, decent drinking places, etc. The gay scence happens in this area too.

Explore other parts from Sago Lane - Temple - Mosque St, are mostly retail shops, lower end restaurants, street markets, massage parlours. Some nice chinese stuffs from chopsticks to cushion covers. Bbq sweet meats, medicated items, chinese herbs. This is the best place to buy cheap souveniers. There are also shopping centres, no harm exploring some or just to get some AC because its so hot and huimid.

There'll be rip-offs cases, but its not rampant, and people here are usually not pushy. Most shops sells similar things so scout around for best price."
,,Cleanest chinatown in the world,5.0,,"I could not believe my eyes, the stores are immaculate; merchandising is tidy, the place is really neat!"
,,Chinatown Tour,4.0,,"If I had my time over, I probably wouldn't bother with the tour: you can easily wander around Chinatown and markets yourself, and if you get a copy of Lonely Planet or some other guide, you can learn just as much as a tour guide. Really enjoyed the Singapore Chilli Crab and cheap beer at the marketplace!!!"
,,Spoil yourself,5.0,,"This area of town is now quite sophisticated with its tourist type offerings. Several stalls also offer cultural treasures.
Hidden in a tall building, close to the MRT is a wonderful museum of the Chinese history of Singapore. Well worth your time to explore this historical presentation."
,,Great atmosphere,4.0,,"We spent a morning at Chinatown we were greeted with fantastic locals, great food, and shops were quite diversed. Would return to Chinatown again."
,,Nice for strolling and Photoshoots,3.0,,Liked - festive atmosphere. Cheap souvenirs Disliked - overcrowded.
,,"Chinatown is a great place, great food, fun, and clean",5.0,,Highly recommend strolling around for an evening and picking anywhere to eat.
,,Very nice,4.0,,"The Chinatown in Singapore is different from what we are used to in Manila. The place was clean and lined with several stores, bars and restaurants. They have outdoor dining, surrounded by different pushcarts and restaurants that offer a varied selection of chinese delicacies. A lot of foreigners (caucasians) frequent the place for a quick beer and get together with friends. It's another must in your itinerary!"
,,Chinatown visit,3.0,,Go to Chinatown early in the morning to avoid the crowd and the heat plus humidity in the afternoon. We visited the Buddhist temple right next to Chinatown. It is an impressive temple with the garden on the top floor. The food court is great with a variety of Chinese dishes to choose from. It was hard to find table to seat though at lunch time. I suggest that you have brunch at 11 or mid-afternoon snack at 3.
,,old town,3.0,,"china is as usual at anyplaces, old architecture, red colour, food are many, but usualy not very clean. many tourism gift if you like to give some to your friend like key chain, etc"
,,Give your self time!,5.0,,Take your time browsing through the endless shops. Sales people are not pushy. We had a lot of fun here and brought back many inexpensive souvenirs whcih our friends loved!
,,A don't miss,5.0,,"Great shopping, fun experience and lovely setting."
,,Amazing Prices.,3.0,,"And...not in a good way. Most of the cheap street-front shops open into larger, higher-end shops in the back, inside the buildings, with AC (thank God). But the prices inside are incredibly high. Example - A Yixing teapot that I bought in Cannon Beach, Oregon for $45 was selling for $189 here in Chinatown! And it was from China! The exact same style! Everything else that I could put a reference price to seemed to tell me that there was about a 150% tourist price mark-up.

However, the food was good, and reasonably priced, and it was fun to walk around the various shops."
,,"Chinatown, Singapore",2.0,,"Did not like anything. The buildings were ok, but the whole place could have been much more interesting"
,,Shopping paradise,5.0,,"Could get around to bargain, pearls etc, need to know your prices and quality of goods"
,,ok,3.0,,"the place is ok, not that much interesting but good to visit sometime, for shopping and for others."
,,Just Great,5.0,,"Chinatown is one of our favorite places, a really highlight is the mango chicken rice from the Heritage Restarant, another is the cheap Tiger beer. Overall a great place to spend half a day or more.
I have to say the last time I went the shopping was not quite as good, but I mainly go for the food anyway! If you are in the market for some nice jewelry however, go to Myers. Ignore the extortionate prices, if you barter you can often get it for at least quarter of the prices displayed!!"
,,A bit of soul,4.0,,Chinatown is not as sanitised as much of Singapore and therefore seems to have a little more soul and character. There are lots of small shops and markets from which to buy almost anything at good prices.
,,better than jakarta chinatown,4.0,,"been to Chinatown in Amsterdam, this one is bigger, a lot of souvenir shops, chinese herbs shop, foods.

And there is a big temple in there, and also chinese garden and people's park.
If you want to eat, this is the place, they have a huge hawker center and it is very good. A lot of food in there. Dim sum, ice, drinks, noddle, kwee tiau, and a lot food that I can't mentioned..

If you have time to go there, you must go to the Chinatown, it's fun!!"
,,good timepass,4.0,,"we had kept chinatown as a last option on our tour because we thought it wouldn't be worth but were pleasantly surprised to find the place so interesting! the innumerable red chinese lanterns herald entry into the tourist space. the local aromas and ethnic stuff available is remarkable. we visited the buddha tooth relic temple as well as the hindu temple both of which were splendid. chinatown is excellent to but cheap souvenirs. we bought chopsticks, handfans, dragons and even ethnic garments at very reasonable rates (after bargaining a lot of course). i was left blushing after an elderly lady selling garments became too inquisitive and actually proposed to marry me when she found out i was single!!!"
,,Defo worth an afternoon stroll!!,5.0,,Take a walk around Pagoda street etc in the afternoon and take in the markets... our kids loved it
,,China town,3.0,,"Smaller than I thought, interesting enjoyed a tour using rickshaws, and meal, met some nice people, all discussed our travels around a Chinese meal"
,,Good Price Good Food,4.0,,"After shopping souvenir we had variety kind of Ice Cream, this shop very popular in Chinatown"
,,Singapore April 2012,5.0,,My daughter had been told that a visit to Chinatown Heritage Centre was a must so we decided to go along to see for ourselves and we really enjoyed our visit there. The exhibits were well done and the history of Chinatowns colourful past was really extremely interesting. I strongly recommend a visit to this Centre.
,,typical small joint with quality chinese cooking,4.0,,"fast, good, affordable. Of course, limited service in a noisy environment. Excellent deal though for a couple of dollars"
,,Gone too touristy,4.0,,"Chinatown when I first visited Singapore some decades ago, wasnt the tourist place that its become today. To me the area has been spoilt somewhat by the worship of the tourist dollar. If you can see past the trinkets for sale, have a close look at some of the buildings, they are examples of the shop-houses that once were more common in Singapore. Some of the buildings have been lovingly restored. At night the street vendors, or the modern equivalent of them, occupy the streets and some excellent food can be found. Accessable by MRT, Chinatown is easy to get to, easy to move around, and pleasant to visit."
,,Good night out,4.0,,The cheapest beer I could find in Singapore. So if you enjoy a drink this is a good place.
,,Love Chinatown,5.0,,"Possibly our best experience in Singapore. You must go late in the afternoon, near to dusk. That is when Chinatown comes alive. Have the chilli crab and drunken chicken, wash it down with a Tiger beer. I wish I could remember the name of the restaurant we went to but I'm sure wherever you go, you will not be disappointed. Chinatown is a cheap place to eat and drink - spend some time....."
,,China town without the chaos,4.0,,"Whilst a little lacking in atmosphere from other Asian City China towns, the comfort and lack of chaos are a welcome substitute"
,,"Reasonable charges, suit most commoners",3.0,,Food choices aplenty. Prizes quite reasonable. Environment general & clean.
,,"Good, but a bit touristy",3.0,,"Chinatown is definitely worth a visit if you are in Singapore.

It offers an array of sights, sounds and smells and is fun to wander around. There are various market stalls selling the usual array of touristy kitsch, but there are some genuinely interesting stalls.

Food options are wide and varied, however the closer you get the the centre the higher the prices get and the less you feel like it is a genuine experience.

When I travel I like to get among real people their lives and Chinatown feels more like a show for people off the cruise ships than the way real people live. Ironically it is the parts of Chinatown closer to the MRT and away from Chinatown itself that felt the most Chinese."
,,A Fun Experience !,4.0,,"As most China Towns in large cities, the Singapore China Town did not dissapoint ! It is a colorful area with lots of bargins from China. We found the people there to be kind & helpful. Enjoyable !"
,,fascinating,4.0,,"very interesting culture. lots of market stalls and a great comparison to little India-almost like two different countries. Beware the men stare! ..and grab so dont travel anywhere on your own if your blonde like me, luckily i had my bf with me to give them the glare."
,,"Fun, safe and tasty",5.0,,"Street food is not my usual choice of cuisine in any City but the Chinese Quarter and food stalls is both compelling theatre and a great food. Of course the question that raises itself which is 'where did you eat' and frankly I don’t know other than observing that the Chinese, Malay and Thai dished be sampled were excellent and the visuals and atmosphere were stunning."
,,Bustling Lively Locations,5.0,,"Chinatown is very lively place. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a must visit. There are many shops selling local delicacies and gifts. ""The Traditional Dessert"" at 64 Temple Street is a must visit."
,,Great Atmosphere!!,5.0,,Cheap Street Food in a vibrant happy environment!!
,,The cleanest China Town in the world,5.0,,"The tile speaks for the itself. Such a clean Chinatown. The hotel staff recommended us to have Dim Sum there and I fell in love with the place ""Yum Cha"". Very affordable, fresh and variety of food. So many people but worth waiting. Would definitely recommend"
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"Almost every stall sells the same things but the variety of restaurants was interesting and we enjoyed some aspects of the Chinese Culture Museum, although it could use a good sprucing up and someone to see that the electricity in some of the exhibits is functioning. But kudos for attempting to show the various aspects of adjusting to life in a new country; not unlike that of Chinese immigrants in Australia and the U.S."
,,If you´ve been to other China towns...,3.0,,this was not so different. Worth walking thru for a check up though.
,,Authentic - love the architecture!,5.0,,"Chinatown is one of the last places in Singapore where you can see vestiges of the old architecture. Great place to shop, eat and take lots of photos for the album. We went several times during our trip and would love to go back!"
,,Good for bargains,4.0,,Cheap touristy stuff for tourists and cheap food for local residents....don't buy the first t-shirt you see and have fun bargaining a little ....
,,Avoid,1.0,,"Nothing special-expensive, loud, commercial. Better see other places."
,,Terrific Shopping :),5.0,,You can buy whatever you want there. there are strange things made by Chinese. You should definitely buy spoon for rice...
,,Great food,5.0,,"Really nice atmosphere,loads of interesting things to see-chinese medicine shops,massage salons etc. Excellent restaurants on every corner,however the prices are kinda for tourists. Chilly crab costs cca 30 dollars while at Makan Sutra is for 15."
,,just a city inside a city.,5.0,,"Start with going around in the afternoon and see how the life is and was of the first ""guest"" labourers long time ago and still see the old traditions and do not forget to visit the nice chinese restaurants with beautiful food."
,,Shopping,4.0,,"The girls loved shopping down the alley ways, the boys found the cheapest beer in town, so we sat and people watched."
,,traditional,4.0,,loved the oldies playing checkers and youngsters standing arround them
,,Not the China Town of old,3.0,,"While some sellers will stay haggle much of the fun has gone. It is much more straight laced than it was 10 years ago. No more shonky watches, clothes, etc."
,,great stalls,4.0,,the stalls in the market place are great..the actual peoples shopping precinct leaves allot to be desired though
,,Good atmosphere,5.0,,Plenty of stalls and a great atmosphere. We love exploring and found some great spots off of the beaten track.
,,Just a dirty place,1.0,,The food market is dirty and the food is not good at all. Washrooms are terribly horrible. Don't go there. A waste of time!
,,Very interesting. I wonder is China like this??? Chinatown must be a preview of The Peoples Republic.,4.0,,"Here, you can shop till you drop!!! The prices are often shown in Mandarin, so always as before buying."
,,Great local food! Many goods from around SE Asia.,5.0,,"Great local food! Many goods from around SE Asia. If you would like to get local SE Asian goods, it's the place! :)"
,,special chinatown,3.0,,"nice place with special aroma. I tried unique beverage here. it's kind of coconut but i didn't know the name. it's slightly different from coconut. it's only 1 dolar and 50 cents. I also visited a temple. actually, I came there in China new year celebration. Some of the shops didn't open. but, we can still find others some which sells many clothes, chinese merchandise etc. You have to visit Chinatown if you go to singapore."
,,Similar to other countries,4.0,,"Good bargains for souvenirs. Most of the restaurants in the underground food court had a B rating, but if you can get past that, the food is pretty tasty!"
,,A small China in the middle of Singapore skyline,4.0,,I went to a restaurant in temple street and was surprised by the Chinese lantern decors and the multitude of Chinese restaurants. We had dim dums & dim sums and more dim sums for lunch. The Chinese temple (on the same block) is a sight to see.
,,A Chinese experience,3.0,,"Walk through the crowded people, you can sense nice ambiance, pretty old temple, and chinese well-preserved architecture.
You can buy souvenirs here, but in my experience, the price of the goods sold in here were more expensive than similar goods found in Bugis Street. I myself prefer to buy souvenirs at Bugis."
,,NICE WAY TO SPEND A MORNING,5.0,,Nice tourist venue that allows one to shop for momentos and gifts for people back home. Worth a morning
,,Stunning Architecture + Cheap Buys + Good Food,5.0,,"The buildings were preserved just as it was before, and it looks absolutely stunning. The souvenir stuff that we bought are very cheap, especially compared to those found in souvenir stores near tourist traps around the city. There is like a street lined with food stalls, and the dimsum tastes really good. Also, this is perhaps the cleanest Chinatown that I have ever been to. Kudos to those who turned this historical and cultural area into such a magnificent sight for people around the world to see!"
,,Shop shop eat,5.0,,Nothing better than downing a Singha beer after a hard day market shopping in china town ... The wonderful street cafes and bars are so welcoming...icy cold drinks and Singapore noodles are so tasty and there Re so man bargains in Chinatown. Be careful you don't get lost n the alleyways...it's easy to become disorientated as they all look the same after a while!
,,Buy your souvenirs here,5.0,,"This is the perfect place to get your keychain souvenirs at a bargain! I was able to buy keychains for S$2, the same as the ones being sold in Bugis for 3 for S$10."
,,was average,3.0,,"i thought i would find some cheap stuff like they have it in Thailand(shoes,bags etc) but they had nothing like that and instead it was more about pottery kind of articles. I would only go there for a quick look and given that i can't go to Thailand on my way back."
,,Fun and vibrant,5.0,,"Such a relaxed atmosphere, so diffierent to the shiney newness of Orchard Road and the Marina. Lots of phot opportunities. Lots of market stalls to shop and hawker stands to eat."
,,"souvenir shopping, sightseeing and taste the local food",4.0,,"brought my American friends to get local souvenirs, magnets are going for 7 for $10, Bottle Wine cloth holder 4 for $10 etc. Did the Tooth Relic and Indian Temple - tried local food at the hawker centre - a 1-stop shop for almost everything!"
,,Not too exciting,3.0,,It's very crowded and dirty compared to the rest of Singapore. Be careful what you buy there because a lot of it could be fake. It may be worth a visit. Up to you.
,,best place to shop,3.0,,you can find tiny little gifts for you friends.And much fake goods. you should ask for discount!!otherwise you can pay much more for the same good your friend has bought...
,,Great Food,5.0,,"Lots of shops and great food, had a wonderful dinner"
,,Great fun in a compact spot.,4.0,,"Although the bargains were not as good as Hong Kong or Viet Nam, we really enjoyed the courtesy and cleanliness here. Got some great jewellry buys after hard bargaining and some pretty souvenirs for reasonable prices."
,,souvenir shopping,4.0,,"Chinatown is easily accessible by the MRT. and the Chinatown exit drops you right in it.
There is a lot of souvenir shopping in Chinatown with the best prices we found in Singapore. The temple that you might be interested in seeing in Chinatown were within a 5 minutes walk from the MRT exit."
,,Chinatown Singapore,4.0,,Chinatown in Singapore was fun and crowded with the typical Asian market flare. It is much cleaner than many other markets that you would typically find in Vietnam or Cambodia for example. It spans several blocks and houses many decent eateries and restaurants.
,,Very touristy but still charming.,3.0,,"Most of the Old Chinatown are gone - if you're looking for anything older than the early 1940s, you really have to dig deep. But this place still has its charm as many older local Chinese folks are still living here, providing tourists a glimpse of life into how old folks live their lives in Singapore."
,,Fun place to visit,5.0,,The night markets were lots of fun. Loads of different products to look at and some great bargains to find
,,Good place to eat and shop,5.0,,"Great to walk in all the pedestrian streets of Chinatown. Food street has something for everyone and the ambiance is pleasant. Nice temples to see and of course, great shopping."
,,Great but watch out for touts,3.0,,"We were picked up by a tout who was very clever, he delivered us to a tailor who was helpful but we decided not to go ahead with a purchase. We were then pressured with the tout coming back into the shop telling us not to be so silly the price was good... We left feeling like we had done something wrong.
Other than the tout, china town was great, not as clean as elsewhere but interesting Chinese heritage museum and architecture."
,,Tourist trap,3.0,,"It may have been a real slice of old China once, but not these days, especially now with its own MRT station. Unashamedly aimed at the tourist dollar. However, there is some good food at low prices if you venture off the main tourist strip."
,,Nice shops,4.0,,"Nice place, and cheap shops for to buy things for to take home, You can als let make an new shut, very quick."
,,A great place for good food,4.0,,Avoid the main tourist joints and head to the back streets for some local food. You save yourself a fortune and get better quality food.
,,Wow,4.0,,"Is a little China Town.., all is available about chinese ,, like food, tradition,history, etc"
,,cheap souvenir at Chinatown,4.0,,Any souvenirs sold here are cheaper than those sold in another area. You also can find g good number of decent chinese restaurants in this area. Take MRT to China Town station which is linked to the main attrction and check-out around. Good experience.
,,Fun,4.0,,Lots of shops at very cheap prices. Wish I had more time there! Had lunch at one of the outdoor cafes and people watched. Fun place to buy souvenirs.
,,Maxwell Market,5.0,,Food local food at value for money price. Chicken rice is a must try.
,,Good shopping experience,4.0,,"We had an amazing shopping experience at China Town. Though you tend to get lost in the myriad lanes, its worth a visit for the food and beautiful saviours to bring back from your trip."
,,Kind of a China town,3.0,,"More a trinket finders heaven, a few deals, but the only exciting shops are the religious icon shops. Amazing items, albeit expensive , are beautiful....Little India is more impressive"
,,Chinese New Year in Singapore,5.0,,"As with many of the evenings that were to come on this trip, we had big plans. The community was gearing up for Chinese New Year so what better place to start than with a tour of Chinatown with our lovely and knowledgeable guide, Ms. Anna Ong. After traveling the green line to the purple line, we exited in downtown Chinatown. The only experience that comes close to this alighting from a transit stop and walking into something so outstanding would be exiting the Tube in London and walking out to the sights of Big Ben and Parliament. The entrance into Chinatown was not only breathtaking, it was also visually overwhelming. The sights, sounds and smells of this area at first overwhelmed the senses in a fascinating way. Once on the street and with the help of Alex’s iphone, we located the petite Ms. Ong who was dressed in the most unique jeans which had Asian designs running the length of both legs. Ms. Ong has more energy and stories than my simple brain can retain and will share but it is always my recommendation to spend some of the travel budget on local tour guides with small groups. Ms. Ong was a fabulous find and earned a recommendation from us. Even with Tucker living in Singapore for two years, Ms. Ong was able to greatly increase his knowledge of the Chinese influences in Singapore.
Ms. Ong wanted us to start in the underground food market since it would closing first, another benefit of a local guide, and presented us with foods we had never seen before. The two that stand out are the “king of fruits”, the Durian, and the “queen of fruits”, the mangosteen. I enjoyed both, however, the group voted for the queen. The dragon’s eye deserved honorable mention; once peeled, it revealed a clear fruit with a black seed creating the look of an eye. The fish section of the market had already closed but remnants of the day’s activities still remained. Perhaps the most fascinating food item was the sweet and sticky cake that is given as a gift for Chinese New Year in order to satisfy the ‘kitchen gods’ and keep them quiet by being sweet enough to make the gods smile and sticky enough to keep their mouths shut. I had noticed small cakes on our walks through markets when accessing the MRT but in this extensive market, they had large cakes with one priced at 288 Sing dollars which is $225 US. The use of eights in the Chinese pricing structure is also important because it means prosperity! This would be an impressive gift for the holiday table and the many boxes of sticky cake indicate how much money there is in Singapore.
In addition to enjoying the taste of these exotic fruits, Ms. Ong turned us onto the ‘popiyah’ which can be described as a spring roll that is not deep fried and doesn’t have to be. The description that I provide does not do justice to this snack dish and the skill at which the wrap or shell is made and how exciting it is to watch the process. The chef has the skill to determine how much dough to put onto the hot skillet to create a very thin shell; it is clearly a much practiced skill that reminds me of an artist. We also sampled some fruit drinks and other beverages that are not found in the states like sugar cane and lime, lime juice, and sour plum and lime. More on drinks later.
After the quiet respite of the dining area, we entered the shoulder-to-shoulder chaos of Chinatown with the Hawkers of merchandise selling their wares using headsets projected on loud speakers all in Chinese with an occasional English word thrown in. All the people, the smells and the noise created a very dynamic and exciting atmosphere for both the tourists and the locals. With Ms. Ong’s good looks and our white skin, we had many free samples, mostly of candies, for Chinese New Year which weren’t a sell.
To escape from the chaotic street scene, Anna took us into a Buddhist Temple that was engaged in a ceremony. Before entering the temple, the women were required to cover their shoulders, knees and cleavage so Anna found the table that held the clothes that could be wrapped appropriately around each body part to allow entry. Tucker and I were able to pull our dress shorts down into the ghetto position to cover our knees which met the temple standard. During our tour of the temple, Ms. Mindy had a little accident with the wrap covering her chest and exposed too much cleavage and immediately a security person came up to her and helped her cover the fellows back up! The prayer ceremony consisted of much chanting and clanging of symbols but the depth of this ceremony is hard to describe. We were allowed to take a video which should make up for my lack descriptive words. Needless to say the experience is worth engaging in if a Buddhist temple is near anyplace in your travel plans. And if you have a guide like Ms. Ong, you will be all set.
Another benefit of a local guide service is knowledge of the local eateries, and Ms. Ong, for as tiny as she is, seems fond of eating. This evening’s adventure was what I would call an ice cream and dessert parlor Chinese style. We shared a shaved “ginger ice with beans and syrup sauce” and a mango shaved mango dish. The mango was my favorite but I was pleasantly surprised by the ginger ice and I am not a bean fan. Anna had what I would describe as a cold soup which was grey in color with white cream around the sides. The dark and light effect of this dish seemed to be relevant in the Chinese culture perhaps because it was akin to the idea of yin and yang.
The next learning experience for us, even for Tucker who is a school teacher, was about the Peranakan culture. A Peranakan is the offspring of a Chinese man (China-Fu Jain) and a Malay woman. The families seemed to have a similar strategy to the old “blue bloods” of America, that is, marrying the money families together! We will share more Peranakan culture during the Penang leg of the Americans Travel the Far East. At one of the Peranakan vendor stalls, Ms. Ong quizzed the girls on the clothing by asking why the tops (Kerongsang) did not have buttons. The riddle was solved with the answer that the amount of money you have determines what type of brooch will be pinned on your Kerongsang. If you are one of those aforementioned money families, your buttons are probably gold or precious stones. While my family would definitely be the pearl or plastic! Although Ms. Ong informs me pearls are only for funerals so maybe just a plain pin.
As we were nearing the end of our four-hour tour, Anna explained some of the architecture of Chinatown. The merchants that had retail on the street level would reside on the level above the store as we have see in many cities. These first generation residents had very low ceilings and small doors and windows. During the second generation, the two stories remained but with higher ceilings and vents above all doors and windows for better ventilation. The third generation added a third story, increased ceiling heights and improved the exterior design of the façade and to the openings of windows and doors for better ventilation, very fancy. During the third generation period, there was also a neighborhood fire that destroyed some of the structures. This created an opportunity to rebuild for the fourth generation and save on taxes since the third generation owners were paying taxes based on frontage. The fourth generation that rebuilt built two stories, three stories, or even 3 ½ stories but reduced the frontage by narrowing the street entrance and expanded the rear of the building thus creating a “V” effect architectural design. We found it very interesting and worth comparing buildings on different sides of the street.
The final stop for Ms. Ong on our tour was a meat store. This store prepared the satay and a flat patty which was grilled and seasoned. We sampled several different seasonings and would compare them to a jerky style meat from the states only much fresher. The preparation area is glassed in and affords the public a good view of the preparation. This establishment is also very popular with the locals for at 10PM, the line was a considerable length and Anna informed us during peak periods, like Chinese New Year, the wait can be up to two hours for their tasty meat treats.
As Ms. Ong departed, she left us by a huge dragon sculpture for the New Year which is a dragon year. It is supposed to be very good for weather which the Far East can use after the flooding in 2011. Four hours was 180 sing or $126 US, a bargain for all we experienced! Ms. Anna Ong can be found through Private Guides Singapore; http://www.privateguide.com/guides/singapore/?Language=63
After Ms. Ong’s departure we had much needed break at the Singapore Cultural Center restaurant where I enjoyed two large cold Tiger beers and some deep fried appetizers which were not worth mentioning. What was worth mentioning was the people watching, as always one of my favorites pastimes, and with the large crowd in Chinatown for the New Year, there was plenty fashion, skin and couples to be seen. The most salient group was the table of ex-pats across the street and their consumption of beer was quite impressive, as well as their flirting with the local girls during a smoke break on the street. Got to love humans at their best! We debated the MRT or a cab home since we had been walked out on our marathon tour and as the cab was right in front us the choice was easy, and for 13 Sing = $9.00 US, a good choice."
,,Great fun,5.0,,"We arrived in chinatown on the tube and its a great site as you come up to street level and find yourself right in the middle of dozens on market type shops with tons of trinkets for sale.
Worth a trip if you enjoy shopping also lots of places to get a massage after you have walked your feet off."

,,elderly,4.0,,dementia center is located above a big hawker center
,,Best Chinatown I've visited,4.0,,"Went expecting yet another typical Chinatown and was pleasantly surprised - I should have remembered that this is Singapore!!

Chinatown was clean and the overall feel was added to by the narrow streets lit by red Chinese Lanterns. The stalls sold the same typical souvenirs, but the food stalls were great and sold beer at a much cheaper rate than in Clarke Quay.

Definitely worth a visit."
,,Great Chinatown with all the usual suspects,4.0,,"Got some good shopping in at Chinatown.
Clothes were good value and the touts weren't too hassling.
Enjoyed a beer when it all got a bit hot.
Not a good variety available for souvenir shirts and lots of tacky gear, but bargains to be had also.
Jewellery on offer, Food & Drink, Perfume, Singapore souvenirs even a TinTin store. Heaps of options to while away the shopping day."
,,No pressure to buy,4.0,,"If you ignore the touts trying to sell you a myriad of things and wander around the back streets, you will see the real Chins Town, its worth exploring"
,,Atmospheric and picturesque.,5.0,,"Our favourite area in Singapore - authentic ""shop houses"" all beautifully renovated, colourful markets and shops, a wonderful little museum of Chinese life & culture. Wander among the stalls and try some real Chinese cuisine - great !"
,,Litte China Town,5.0,,Compared to other China Towns I have been this is quite small but very clean. Clean China Town in Clean Singapore. Nothing much to see except the Chinese Temple and the Hindu Temple. But good place to buy gifts.
,,Shop and eat,4.0,,"Surely you can find almost anything there, and the foods are mniumy as well."
,,A maze of wonder and best souvenirs,5.0,,"I almost considered skipping chinatown and im glad i didn't. Such a gem in Singapore. There is so much to see and the best part are the affortable and variation of souvenir offerings available. I would advise not to buy your souvenirs anywhere else in Singapore, and wait till you visit Chinatown. its almost 30%-40% cheaper.

Best area is around the chinatown MRT heading towards the sri miramamman (Forgive my spelling) temple.

HIGHLY rceommend."
,,Great experience,5.0,,Loved walking up and down the streets of Chinatown. Some good bargains to be found.
,,Temple and Smith Streets were great...worth the visit!,4.0,,"We visited Chinatown several times while in Singapore. The restaurants were good, the shopping a bit of fun and the Tiger beer was great. The chefs at all the restaurants were really good and the food could not be faulted. Would visit again any time."
,,Don't miss it,4.0,,Excellent place to find a bargin. Places to have a drink.
,,Very fun place for shopping and eating,4.0,,"Chinatown is lively with great shopping, lively markets, and a huge variety of places to eat. It's great any time of day but is especially lively in the evening when all the food stalls are open and all the vendors are displaying their wares. It's very easy to get there by public transport (and much cheaper than a taxi)."
,,Busy Busy Busy,3.0,,So many people...lots of cheap stuff to buy...and always getting hassled to buy. Not a great experience.
,,Great place to wander,5.0,,Lots of shops and stalls great fun a real must easy to find and a safe environment
,,Get a Feel of China,4.0,,"Getting of the china town MRT take the pagoda street exit to reach the pagoda street which is ghe market street lined on both sides with shops selling lots and lots of souvenirs .interspersed with a few restaurants . Shops selling trinkets and souvenirs with price range from 3 for 10 dollars to 7 for 10 dollars. worth a look and purchase if you are planning on giving gifts to lots of people back home ,otherwise be careful in your selection and buying as these are not of the greatest quality.There is a tintin shop here exclusively for tintin memorablia etc.perpendicular to the pagoda street is the food street where u can indulge in good chinese food at reasonable prices.one can spend close to 3 hours in this place and wind it up with food and chinese beer."
,,Bustling chinatown,4.0,,"Food in one of many foodstalls, try fresh squeezed juice."
,,Good for souvenirs,4.0,,Great choice of cheap souvenirs but is often crowded and a little dirty (like every other Chinatown around the world).
,,"Great tour, bad food",3.0,,"The trishaw trip is fun, the boat ride is fantastic and Florence, the tour guide, is amazing. The shops are ok, if you are into cheap tat. The food is awful. 41 of us were fed in 45 minutes and I have had tastier sweet and sour out of a jar. Not authentic, not worth the money. It would be better to do the ride and the boat trip without the meal, you could choose your own restaurant if you wanted to eat."
,,A real Chinatown,5.0,,So much food and shopping in the Chinatown area; and several subway stations provide for easy access.
,,"shops, food, sights!",5.0,,You can get some great take-home gifts here. Best prices for foot reflexology around- bargain though.
,,If you are in Singapore you must stop by,4.0,,"Ok , many may disagree with my comments about Chinatown but let me explain myself. Ive been to other Chinatowns before but this one was the best one ive seen. Remember that more than half of the population is chinese so yu can see more authenticity in this one than in others. Also a good place for buying souvenirs. Dont buy anything expensive , not worth, but buying souvenirs is definetly the place. Also very nice local food for good prices but search for the local places , dont go in if you see too many tourists, try finding the hidden spots, stairs , places where most locals go and few tourists. You also have a MRT station right in front of it m so its pretty easy to get there.
Dont forget bargaining, its part of their culture. If you see something for SD$ 20, just say SD$ 10 and if they say know no, just walk away, you will soon get what i mean."
,,Full of surprises.,5.0,,"from the market to the restaurants to the electronic malls, Chinatown has so much atmosphere. No longer home of the great bargain, but still worth a day out or two."
,,A place to go !,5.0,,Cheap items and lots of choices. You'll never go hungry there were lots of Restaurants to choose!
,,CNY is the way to see this place,5.0,,Absolutely busy over the CNY period and great to see all the stalls selling all the bits to CNY. Fabulous area with great places to enjoy S'pore eating pastime.
,,Great food and cheap Beer,5.0,,Chinatown was as great place. Food was good and not expensive and so was the beer.
,,go as part of a tour,5.0,,"we went as part of a tour, had a wonderful meal, a fabulous Trishaw ride through the streets of Singapore, then on to the river cruise. A fabulous and fun evening"
,,Chinese New year,5.0,,"We were here a few days before new year and it was a mass of colour, smells and people. Quite manic really but a fantastic atmosphere. Well worth a visit."
,,historical,5.0,,very nice for a walk and shopping for souvernis...
,,Fabulous place,5.0,,"Spent many hours here just wandering around and sampling all the different foods and just watching the people, a great way to spend a day, and then I caught the river taxi from Clarke Quay down the river, a fabulous day."
,,Unique market,4.0,,"Another place for looking cheap things, do not hesitate for walking more deep inside, usually they are more cheaper there."
,,great stuff,4.0,,visited Chinatown at night was hot and balmy. Got lots of bargains though - must do again.
,,Good place to shop and to have Chinese food,4.0,,"It is like any other china town that you can find in many big cities. Very clean. God Chinese restaurants. Lots of things to shop for. If you have time at hand, a must visit."
,,Sensory overload.,4.0,,"Lots to see,good atmosphere,lots of lovely cafes ."
,,Interesting,5.0,,"We visited Chinatown during Chinese New Year and it was interesting to see all the colourful lanterns and displays, although goods were a bit tacky."
,,shopping time,4.0,,I like the cleanliness and the goods are many. Make me want to shop more. But i dislike the restaurant on its corner. The price is not worth it at all!
,,Vibrant,5.0,,"Go by day and return at night to see the place look and feel very different.Don't miss the street food in Smith Street,the choice and food are wonderful."
,,Not quite what I expected,3.0,,"Did a 4-hour walking tour of Chinatown with a private guide. The neighborhood has lost it authenticity however, since the government renovated the neighborhood. A lot of the original Chinese inhabitants left the area after the prices went up. Although there are still a lot of Chinese shops, you can tell that these are mainly focused on tourists. Visit the Chinese and Hindoe temples while you're there. These are extremely beautiful."
,,China Town great for bargains,3.0,,"China town is a great place to buy trinkets and unusual gifts and also gives you the chance for a bit of a haggle. Some stalls sell the same thing so you can grab a bargain because of the competition. I bought a lovely Pashmina for my daughter and it was very cheap $15. A tip for anyone bying fridge magnets buy them in Chinatown as they are only a dollar each compared to $3 in other shops.
The disappointment for me was it was only one street and very busy and hot I was hoping to see houses that were different to other places but the outside streets were quite tatty."
,,exquisite,4.0,,"the market has a life of its own .Fantastic gifts to buy , at reasonable cost"
,,a real highlight,4.0,,"This is the 'best' chinatown i have experienced anywhere in the world. It is easy to get to from Dhoby Ghaut metro and takes 2 minutes literally. Atmosphere is terrific with lots of little shops and 2 temples, one buddist the other hindu. Also some terrific heritage building that are a feast to the eyes. Several eating options also. Highly recommend."
,,Shops shops!,4.0,,you like to shops? just come and see china town. cheap stuff at the markets
,,Colorful and delightful taste of a Chinese market such as one sees throughout Asia.,5.0,,"This is a good place to visit if you have not been into Chinese markets in other parts of Asia. The Buddhist Temple is quite elaborate and nice. The market area is clean, safe and attractive."
,,Local sights and smells,5.0,,"I like to go where the locals go - Chinatown in early morning to see them shopping in the ""wet market"" - buying fish, meat, fruits and vegetables, and in the evening when the food stalls set up their ""street kitchens"" for outdoor dining."
,,Vibrant Chinatown,5.0,,"It has a great charm and I would recommend that this be the first thing you see in Singapore. It also has buildings from other faiths /cultures mixed in so you see a nice variety of interesting things. After touring, you can get to Clark Quay and have refreshment on a river patio."
,,Place to buy souvenirs in SIngapore,3.0,,"(+) Cheap, unique and many selections of souvenirs were sold (-) Fixed price, some of the sellers were not friendly and some of them could not speak English"
,,So much hustle and bustle,3.0,,"We went on an evening tour of Chinatown which included a trishaw ride. The markets in the town were so much of the same thing over and over again. The trishaw was exhilarating, but scary when we came to main roads and full-on evening traffic. This place would be better explored at leisure rather than part of a tour."
,,Not so exciting,3.0,,I must be expecting something as pulsating as hong kong so it was a little letdown. It's antiseptic Singapore Chinatown . There are good bargains though if you know how to haggle in the small shops.
,,Busy place,4.0,,Two main streets and lots of massage parlours. The cuban bar sells cheapish beer by Singapore standards and the food is OK. If the waiters and waitresses who stand in wait for your custom at some of the restaurants show you a menu it will probably be the double price menu. Tourist are offered a different menu to the locals so be careful. Cuban Bar is an exception to this as I remember because the prices are on display to everyone.
,,A CLEAN CHINATOWN WITH GREAT FOOD,4.0,,"Visited here twice in February on stop-over holidays.

ATMOSPHERE: Clean and packed with things to see, eat and do.
COMMUNICATION: Almost all stalls spoke English and made a concerted effort to communicate in a friendly way.
FOOD: A great selection on Chinatown Food Street BUT, FOR THE REAL GOOD FOOD, go to the 3 storey hawker centre where all the locals eat and order something there. You might have to go on pictures, in stead of knowing what is in the food, but it's a great experience.
SOUVENIRS: Good for a few curios, but a lot of the same. Not too expensive, but slightly expensive by ""Chinatown standards."" Shop off the main street for some cheaper souvenirs and postcards.

Definitely worth a see if visiting Singapore, no matter how short your trip."
,,chinese treat,4.0,,"what couldn't you say. everything possible about china & its culture are right here, you could spend many days, just wandering around the temple & market. loads of places to eat & drink"
,,"Bargain, bargain, bargain.",4.0,,There are lots of stalls here and vendors are not really pushy. Do not take first price though. Always bargain. We bought clothing at the stalls inside the building rather than the stalls in the street.
,,nice china town,5.0,,"good deals on the ususal stuff, but clean and no pushing"
,,another china town,4.0,,"I've been to few CTs in States and Canada. More or less the same, the different is Singapore CT is cleaner and less gloomy. And interestingly there is a Indian Temple right middle of the China Town."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Spent the day doing a free walking tour and saw all the sights. I had some wonderful food and shopped for bargains ( plenty here).
You can get some soveniers for as little as 3 tee shirts for $12.
Then later i treated myself to a massage for and Hour. This was worth every penny for my tired feet."
,,I love Chinatown,4.0,,I love to walk in China town especially during the weekend. I walk in the small streets and look at the shops and restaurants. There are people eating at all hour of the day after 11 am...There is a huge food market where one can find and taste the different kind of specialties of every region of China. Look where the locals queue up that is the best way to locate a great restaurant. Don't forget to take tissues with you as there are no napkins in food markets in Singapore. There are sometimes elderly ladies walking around selling tissues so don't hesitate to buy from them it helps them make ends meet.
,,A Must See in Singapore,5.0,,"Start at Chinatown MRT. Be sure and sample the Bakwa, or tasty BBQ pork squares served in the shops along New Bridge Road. Pagota street is a popular street for tourists. Try the chopstick shop for great souvenirs. Don't miss Temple street's Yumcha restaurant for some authentic Dim Sum. There are some great dish shops along this street, where virtually every restaurant in SIngapore buy their dishes. Srie Mariamman temple is colorful and proceed up Ann Siang Hill for nice restaurants, and some great Steak and Frits. This is the place to go during Chinese New Year, and the Mid Autumn festival."
,,dumpling and chilli crab heaven,5.0,,"crazy atmoshere, lovely food and amazing dumplings"
,,Just wondering the streets,5.0,,"We loved wondering the streets and enjoying the various street foods on offer. We even braved ear candling, which was very interesting."
,,Nice to spend an hour,3.0,,Nice for a stroll and have a look but an hour will do
,,Always awake Chinatown,5.0,,"It is a pleasure walking around in Chinatown with all the small shops, with owners who are indeed very eager of selling their products. :-) Very nice area for a relaxed evening walk."
,,Busy and very Commercialised,3.0,,The 'market' in Chinatown is entirely tourist orientated and the goods can be bought more cheaply in nearby malls.
,,"Central, beautiful architecture, lots to do",4.0,,We stayed in Chinatown and had an incredible time. Most of the older architecture was well-preserved and the rest was beautifully-designed. Lots to do and see.
,,Smile but say no,4.0,,"An experience not to be missed, do not buy without first bartering and agreeing a price, lots of good things to buy and plenty of great restaurants"
,,LOCAL SCENE,3.0,,"If one is looking for old buildings and architecture of the 1950s, this is the place. One can still find things selling on the streets in the open and next to it are the old traditional houses of the 1950s. One can still find good Chinese hawker food there if one does not mind sweating it out at the multi storey carpark food court."
,,Good food and atmosphere,4.0,,"First Chinatown I have been to where you are not hassled by hawkers selling cheap copies. Try the Dim Sum, great value and taste."
,,Cleaner Chinatown,4.0,,"One of the clean china town I have been to. We took MRT, there is a museum and 2 chinese and Indian temple in the chinatown. We tried the chicken rice and sate. There are a lot nice food stall on the road side"
,,Tatty tourist spot,3.0,,"We went at night to a beautiful little restaurant where the chinese food was amazeballs (I cant remember the name) but the rest of Chinatown at night just reminded me of a tacky tourist spot for cheap souvenirs, rows of the same stuff. So many nicer places to visit in Singapore."
,,Don't Buy From The 1st Store You Visit,5.0,,"Many of the shops carry the same items. I noticed that if you walk further into Chinatown you can find a much better deal on the same things (sometimes 50% less). You can also bargain with any of the shop owners. There are a lot of stores in the market selling cheap/cheesy items (which are still fun to buy), but there are a few that have some really great masks and wood carvings. You could easily spend a few hours shopping here."
,,Great area to browse around,4.0,,"Chinatown is a busy bustling area of Singapore and a great place to spend an afternoon browsing the shops and the People's Park shopping complex. In the evening there are many restaurants that offer better value that some of the well known hawked centres such as Lau Pa Sat. An example would be satay which we found cost around half the price of the Lau Pa Sat satay vendors.

Chinatown has many shops to attract the tourist dollar, selling the usual range of tacky souvenirs and t-shirts, however it is a fun area to spend a few hours

I believe the area does offer more that shops and restaurants, for example the Chinese Cultural Heritage centre and a Chinese temple. The area is certainly well worth a visit."
,,"Great shopping, temples, and food",5.0,,"Clean, attractive environment. Great shopping. Interesting temples. Good variety of food."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"I hadn't been to Singapore for some years. I have however been in other countries in Asia and so found Singapore's Chinatown disappointing. Shops sold much the same thing at much the same price - little variation in goods and goods I recognised from Indonesia. . Great for cheap gifts if that's what you're after but apart from that, I could find little else."
,,Fun place to visit.,5.0,,"This is a great place to have lunch or dinner, fun shopping and great foot massages! Easily can spend a day in this area, it is close to Little India and Arab street."
,,"Most items have marked prices, but bargaining is still possible",5.0,,"We had a fabulous time wandering around Chinatown. It's hot and hard work sometimes, but there's always plenty of fabulous food stalls and they sell Tiger beer in big bottles! Look out for the Tintin Shop and some of the little antique shops. There are some real treasures to find!"
,,Interesting mix of oriental.,4.0,,"Everything authentically Chinese with a local twist, from things you need, to quirky souvenirs, plus, there's great food at every turn of the corner."
,,Not the best but worth a visit...,3.0,,Not the best Chinatown I've been to and certainly not the cheapest but there was a good selection of toot for sale and the restaurants were spread out nicely. Well connected on the tube.
,,Nice and Clean Singapore Chinatown,5.0,,One of the most clean and organized Chinatown I´ve ever seen.I enjoyed so much.

,,Well worth a visit.,5.0,,"If you get the chance of a Tri-shaw ride then do it, amazing how they get them through some of the streets in Chinatown and hair raising on the major roads!!"
,,9th time in Sing,4.0,,"every traveler to Sing has to venture into Chinatown, it's safe , friendly ,affordable and a splash of colors for your eyes , some of the back starts can smell a little strong ,other than that it's a great place to spend a day going around and having lunch with a 1L bottle of Tiger!"
,,great place to shops till drop and chinese culinary,5.0,,"It is easy to catch with MRT from every station..

I do not think that Chinatown's better than I expected.
Spacious place to buy souvenir items of Singapore, a wide variety at low prices. The place is clean.
And headed to Chinatown from the taxi drop off, there are places Hindu worship like India Hindus temple.
Children also enjoy spending time here, there is also a Chinatown trinkets for the kids.
This place is better..; better and better than the Bugis street.
Merchants can speak Malay and a little English, but all of them are Chinese.
Various souvenirs can be found, from key chains, bags, shirts, write the name with the China's letters, china medicine dealers, jerky and there is a most impressive shop that there's 1 shop sells memorabilia and original of Tintin. Called TINTIN-shop.
It is amazing to visit that store. It is selling items on Tintin- because I'm a big admirer of him so it can be like heaven to have his memorabilia.

It is no regret at all to visit the Chinatoen in Singapore.."
,,Have to visit if in Singapore,5.0,,Great place - Highly recommended - went twice in a 5 day period.
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"Some lovely old buildings, real bustle and eating opportunities"
,,Busy and lively ...love it here,4.0,,"Stroll along Pagoda street, very lively and really enjoy the atmosphere. Souvenir sold here is very price consistent, you almost find the same prices in every stall, which is good. Had a quick half hour foot massage which costs SGD18. But the restaurant along this street can be pricey, for 2 persons, 2 types of dishes, rice n drinks costs SGD42. Weather can be hot if you choose to come in the morning, went to OG department store for air con and more shopping."
,,Very small china town,3.0,,full of cheap suvenirs if that is yoiur cup of tea.
,,Great food,4.0,,"Great place to visit, good shopping and selection of local cuisine."
,,"Ambience, shopping, good food",5.0,,Relaxing in Chinatown over a beer is great. Lots of nick-nack shopping. Great food ranging from western prices to $3 meals at the hawker's markets. Always busy and fun to visit.
,,Great district in Singapore,4.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore combines some very good things - a huge and very cheap hawker market for budget-conscious dining - with some very bad things - rip off camera shops that will sell you horribly overpriced electronics - along with some strange and unexpected things - for instance, near the Temple of Buddha's Tooth, there's a stall where a German chap will sell you delicious pretzels and sausages. Not entirely sure how he's ended up in Chinatown, but it suits the random collision of cultures in Singapore.

Likewise, there are some interesting sights - several large temples - and also some fairly ugly streets, or unappealing housing blocks, all mashed together. Perhaps because of these collisions, it doesn't feel like there's a very natural centre to this area, and depending on whether you want see some Chinese culture, or go to buy some Chinese souveniers of Singapore, or possibly look at a rather dusty shop full of kitchen products, you'll be happy in some parts of Chinatown and disappointed in others. But there should be something here for most people to be happy at least some of the time."
,,Great gift shopping,5.0,,"Loved chinatown, shopped in People's Park Complex - they have an amazing selection of stores from Fish Foot Spa to Travel Agents to a store specializing in winter gear, coats, gloves, hats (in Singapore! but we found out later Singaporeans love going to the snow for their holidays). Had afternoon tea at Yum Cha restuarant and then waited for the night markets to start - everything seemed to be open just after 5pm. Got a lot of nice presents to bring home. Top pick was a chopstick store..worth the trip."
,,Not so many fake's!,4.0,,"This China town isn't full of fake's for sale. There is some great hawker stalls, and local handicrafts."
,,have to go and have a look,4.0,,a bit tourist orientated but some cheap shoes to be had
,,Night of the cards,5.0,,"Spend a few hours here after dark and explore the market, before visiting some of the many excellent restaurants in the area. Don't only visit one. Go from restaurant to restaurant and try a few dishes to share."
,,You just have to go there,4.0,,You can not visit Singapore without a visit to Chinatown. Same old junk the whole way thru but an experience. For beer drinkers the cheapest place to buy Tiger beer in Singapore. Friends got cheap cameras there.
,,Food,5.0,,I loved eating at the various food courts there and the atmosphere is good.
,,Have to go there,5.0,,"We went there for our dinner. A lot of street kitchens, but with photoes to deceide from, makes your choise easier than in for instance Bangkok. We had chicken i sweet and sour sauce and a duck dish. The duck dish was double as expensive as the chicken, but it was only what we in Denmark would throw away, that was in the boiler.
A part from dinnerplaces there are a lot of all kind of shops. Many are the same, shops selling 4 things for 10 Singapore Dollars."
,,We went to the Heritage Centre,4.0,,cheap and cheerful shopping outside. Go to the Heritage centre it is worth a couple of hours
,,Authentic Chinese Culture,4.0,,"Great shopping experience. One can pick up souvenirs in plenty and shopkeepers are very helpful. But the best experience is the Food Street in the evening. Unforgettably delicious dishes - make sure you reach early, as the queue in many popular food outlets can be loooong!"
,,Like Every Other Chinatown Everywhere Else,3.0,,"It was just like Chinatown in San Francisco, or Kuala Lumpur, or Saigon, same same, selling the same stuff, with the same red lanterns over the streets. Not really worth the trip if you're looking for something unique."
,,Do your own thing,5.0,,"We first went on an organised trip to China Town and missed half of what was to see, so went back the next day on our own and spent several hours just walking and going into the Temples and wandering round the market and streets. Very safe and clean and well worth the visit."
,,"Fun, clean, affordable",4.0,,Chinatown is very clean and beautiful. I've visited other Chinatowns in various places but the Singapore Chinatown was really nice. It can be very crowded and unless you want cheap tourist souvenirs I would avoid the stretch of stalls that are very crowded with tourists and feature most of the same stuff. I found it more interesting just to walk down the different streets and see all the different kinds of shops that I have never seen before. I also prefer the little street stalls and the food centers to the Chinatown restaurants. The people stand outside and try to get you to come in. While they might have AC and look nice I don't think the food is that good and it is overpriced. Honestly I think the worst meal I had in Singapore was in one of those restaurants. I would also recommend going after the sun sets because they have a lot of lanterns up and I would imagine it is very beautiful at night and of course it will not be so hot once the sun is down.
,,Great Shopping,5.0,,"Didn't like so many people pushing ande shoving, but the shoppoing side of things was really good. Food excellent andvery nice people. Not many could speak English but we got by."
,,Same as China,3.0,,I didn't enjoy that much due to unexpected mess everywhere.
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"Chinatown, much like many other Chinatowns around the world. Good market atmosphere and great food. One of the bigger Chinatowns I have seen."
,,Very touristy,3.0,,"I think it bears little resemblance to the original Chinatown, but it's still worth a visit."
,,The only place to be on a Singapore evening,5.0,,"The food, the smells, the great Tiger beer, the buzz. Need I say more."
,,Lovely place to stay,4.0,,"Having been to Singapore many times we decided to stay in Chinatown we had a good time, it is lovely to wakeup late and cruise through the day then return in the evening. It isvery good just to sit and have a beer and watch the world go by.or shop til you drop, visit the temples or hop on the train, be careful what hotel you pick if you stay there ours was awful but to visit is a must"
,,as good as it gets,5.0,,"eat in food street with the locals, inexpensive and great quality"
,,Must do this,3.0,,"This is simply something you should do if visiting Singapore. The temples are good- and of course all the tiny market stalls get you in every time - no matter where they are. Try a walk around the blocks opposite the markets though - lots of european style cafes, restaurants and stores to check out."
,,Probably the most coordinated Chinatown in the world...,3.0,,"Well...we always love to stay in Chinatown areas, where ever we are, because of the liveliness of these areas. Also there's always lots of great eateries in Chinatowns all around the world.

Don't expect to find a Chinatown as mentioned above in Singapore. As everything else in Singapore, this area is very much controlled and coordinated.

After about 23.30, the streets go quiet, leaving no rubbish or noise anywhere. Foodstalls are all neatly lined up besides one another (well, it's more restaurants instead of foodstalls), as are the marketstalls.

If you don't expect to find a Chinatown like Bangkok (for example), you're ok staying here. But in the evening, little Arab is much nicer area to be at."
,,It is like stepping into another world.,4.0,,Chinatown is reasonable compact and easily reached by bus or taxi. We felt safe walking around and were met by smiling faces and owners of shops willing us to browse. The street food stalls smelt good but we were not tempted. Lots of bargains to be had and do not forget to haggle.
,,Shopping & Eating,4.0,,You can shop an eat then shop some more an eat again......its a place you have so see while in Singapore
,,Year of the Dragon---Celebrate Chinese New Year!!!,5.0,,"Even when it it isn't a holiday, the shopkeepers of Chinatown will woo you to buy their teas, peking duck, and tailor made silk clothing. Take your wallet!"
,,Repetitive,3.0,,Lots of market stalls that all seemed exactly the same - got a little lost thinking I had gone down new streets already.
,,Again a must see...,5.0,,"Not to be missed, and easily reachable by subway. Extremely busy, attractive prices. It seems you might buy anything you want."
,,Unmissable,5.0,,This is a fascinating area full of interesting shops to buy souvenirs at reasonable prices without the tedium of having to bargain. There are plenty of restaurants as well as delicious freshly cooked street food. Do not miss The Buddha's Tooth Temple.
,,Loved it!,5.0,,If there is a Chinatown to visit anywhere in the world you've got to have a look. We went back for seconds. Be wary of the bag snatchers in the central market at this Chinatown. A few simple precautions should do the trick.
,,Still going strong many years on!,4.0,,"This is always worth a visit - the markets and general ambiance are very ""old Singapore""."
,,Great shopping,4.0,,Shopping can be overwhelming but there's some great bargains to be had and some fabulous food as well.
,,A bit sterile...compare to other China Towns,3.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore and have a few days in town, sure you can go and stroll around. Just comparing it with other china towns in other cities around the world.
Don't eat at the restaurants in that area...it's a rip off and food not that great."
,,get anything you want in terms of chinese produce,4.0,,"certainly worthwhile a visit to just explore and find ones way around. this is part of Singapore and of its history and it more than belongs here. thoroughly enjoyed spending time there and getting the odd thing to bring back home. From the lucky cat to thai soap, from tea to chinese medicine - you can get it all. take some time to venture through china town and also have a look at the old architecture and history hidden in there."
,,busy,4.0,,"We saw most of chinatown via the hop on bus but found the buildings etc great. Did do some of the shops on the outskirts. Always find these places interesting and this didn't disappoint, nice atmosphere."
,,"Enjoyable, with a treat in the middle!",4.0,,"I was quite stunned when I came out of the Pagoda Street exit of CHINATOWN SRT station. Up the escalator and immediately into a Chinese market street, full of stalls and bustle. WOW!
I enjoyed strolling around the stalls in the equatorial heat and not being pestered by hawkers. Many of the stalls had 'tat' but many also had genuine Chinese wares.
Suddenly, I would happen upon an exotic religious building dotted about throughout the neighbourhood and then...
The foot spa on Temple Street. A magic treat."
,,A lot Local food stall with reasonable price,3.0,,"You should try the food court next to OG dept store. they have quite variety of foods that taste very nice and the price very reasonable. You should try Kho kee fishball noodle, chasiu noodle and tan tat cakes. In front of People Park, they also have alot of snack stores. its worth to try."
,,Embrace the chinese culture,5.0,,"Wither you go for gift shopping, foot massage, visit one of many temples or just sipping Chinese tea, this place will be giving you a rich cultural experience you won't forget."
,,OK but not brilliant,3.0,,"We enjoyed a stroll around Chinatown, but like most it's a bit jaded and we were not tempted to eat there."
,,"Good food, fun to see, souvenir hunting",4.0,,"really a must go. If you're in for souvenirs, this is a good place. And you can actually try to get some of the price off..."
,,Fun!,5.0,,"Nice to walk around, see the shops, try interesting food. Very clean by Chinatown standards. Mostly tourist crap for sale, but still a lot of fun."
,,Bustling with people,5.0,,"I like this Chinatown where it sells alot of Chinese things from Satin dressing gown, foods, Wood ware etc This is the place to go and it had adjacent Metro linked to Chinatown so you haven't got very far to catch..."
,,Temple is amazing,4.0,,We had a wonderful time in Chinatown - exploring the shops and street vendors and we ended our visit with a trip to the Buddhist temple where there was a prayer service. AMAZING
,,average experience,3.0,,"This chinatown is basically almost the same with other parts of Chinatown of other country. One thing for sure, this China Town is far cleaner than the rest of Chinatown Worldwide... for the sake of experience, worth a visit, but not coming back."
,,Not very China but Singapore,4.0,,This is a nice preserved area. Lots of Good food and shopping. Try it during the Chinese New Year squeeze and Mid Autumn celebration...
,,If You Haven't Been to China visit Chinatown,3.0,,If you've been to China you could skip Chinatown but if you haven't been to China you will find it interesting. It is similar to some of the areas you will see in China but prices are higher.
,,Chinatown,5.0,,Great food Great prices You can get whatever you want there. Will go back as soon as I return to Singapore
,,Storm in a teacup!,4.0,,Staying five nights in Singapore - a must is to visit Chinatown. To have a beer at one the cafes along the street - to watch the world go by and the torrential rain pour down - it soon dried up and we were able to continue our Chinatown experience.
,,Amazing Smells,4.0,,Unfortunatley we visited during the day and regret that we did not have the time to visit during the evening. The smells and food were fantastic
,,Awesome China Town,4.0,,"One of the calmest, cleanest China Town's to visit with great shopping and cheap, delicious street food"
,,"Noisy, and very much like any other Chinatown",3.0,,"The restored buildings are interesting, and there are plenty of terrific restaurants (especially Smith Street, called 'Food Street' by the locals). But if you only have a few days in Singapore, there are better places to visit."
,,CNY Galore!,5.0,,"The scene here just before the Chinese New Year was awesome! The place is so clean and there are many things to see although some of the things gets repetitive from shop to shop. But overall, it is a good experience."
,,are we in china?,4.0,,when you enter here you soon feel like being in another country. everything around you is chinese and the athmosphere is amazing.
,,Near New Year,4.0,,"We toured through Chinatown just a few days after the Chinese New Year. There were many stalls and friendly people everywhere. Great food, good experience. Quite crowded in places, but that might just be because of our timing."
,,nice place to buy gifts,4.0,,Managed to get good and cheap gifts for my friends back home. There is a cluster of gifts shop here so be sure check around before buying to get the deal. Worth a visit...
,,Amazing at New Year,5.0,,"Went on arrival day in Singapore, Chinese New Year of The Dragon. Market was bustling."
,,Souvenir street,3.0,,"More the Chinese souvenir street, then the Chinatown itself. Too many tourists. However if look a bit more careful there couple of good restaurants and some of the souvenir shops are worth to look inside. Mostly the ones closer to the temple."
,,Nice place for buying gift for friends,4.0,,"I visited here at evening and don't have much time here, but I wish I have more time to enjoy here. i bought some gifts for my friends and my niece here with very cheap price. Highly recommend! People tell that the food here good also but It's pity that I hadn't have enough time to try."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,Great little area and street stalls. Loved it. The temples were so interesting. Don't miss this place.
,,"Not that good, not that bad",3.0,,"The food price is average, not very expensive, but not very cheap either. Their are wide range of food choices you can get, overall I think this place is okay."
,,Yue Wha Depatrment Store,5.0,,"No trip to Singapore is complete without some Chinese shopping. The Yue Wha Department Store has top quality merchandise at reasonable prices. Though on sale, I recently purchased some really good golf shirts for about $12 US each.
They also carry a lot of herbal products competitively priced to the stalls, and the clerks speak English."
,,VERY GOOD,4.0,,"This is certainly a place to go of an evening, or during the day. At night you have all the lights which make it magical. Lots of stalls selling lots of trinkets and souvenirs - a must for the tourist."
,,A colorful explosion!,5.0,,"Singapore is a big party for all the senses. A modern state city, safe, clean, with the best public transport. Until the more traditional places, in spite of preserve the culture and local traditions, show those qualities. Chinatown, is formed for 4 or 5 blocks near the Business District and is a colorful explosion, making the tourists feel themselves in the middle of China, with small shops and kiosks selling everything, good and varied street food and a exciting agitation that fire up the senses.In the place there are very good Chinese restaurants. Specially, I and my wife recommend a little hidden gem, where we have lunch at least 6 times, with a simple ambience and food worthy of the emperor at very low cost. It is the Cheng Li Yuan restaurant (72 Tanjong Pagar) in the south of the neighborhood."
,,Like any Chinatown,5.0,,Great for shopping and getting a foot massage.
,,Chinatown without shopping madness,3.0,,"If you have seen other Chinatown like for example in Malaysia, and you are looking forward great cheap shopping, Chinatown in Singapore will let you down, you cant buy same stuff which you can get at KL Chinatown for example like branged goods, but instead traditional Chineese souvenirs. I have done research in Singapore and some sources say such shopping in Singapore its illegal so you can buy only what officially China has to offer, however Little India district brakes all the rules and you can find almost anything but still not all that :) Chinatown has few places with traditional Chinese food, markets and boutique shops."
,,Overall OK,3.0,,Tourists can buy most of the cheap sourvenirs here. It will be more exciting and crowded before the Chinese New Year period.
,,Lunch and a New Ring in Chinatown,3.0,,Had lunch at a tourist oriented seafood restaurant. Nothing special for the price. Bought a nice diamond and emerald ring for a good price from one of the numerous jewellery shops. Tourist refund received about a month later as advised.
,,Great Culture - Great Food!,5.0,,"Having been lucky enough to visit during the Chinese New Year , we set off to explore Chinatown by night. What an experience! the fantastic decorations and lights lit the area and transformed it into a photographers delight!
Everyone was again so helpful, and when we found the ""Food Road"" with all the individual stalls serving every dish imaginable we knew we were in for a real treat. Having chosen our dihes, (from two different stalls) we simply paid, and then sat on the public tables set along the street. The food was delicious, and the meal for two of us only cost £9.00 - BARGAIN! All the stalls are controlled by the government for hygiene etc so there are no worries there and we felt very safe walking the streets at all times. If you visit Singapoer without callinng in on Chinatown then you will have cheated yourself out of a real treat!"
,,"The noise, the sights, the smells....all good",5.0,,Try visiting the Museum in Smith Street and eat the best chilli crab! Unbelieveable!
,,Great Deals,5.0,,"I like the place lots of shops to choose from. Great deals, great food. Buy your souvenirs here very cheap and good quality."
,,Chinatown anywhere in the world is the same,2.0,,I wasn't impressed by Chinatown. It was no different than the Chinatown in San Francisco or New York. Its a good place to buy souvenirs and get an inexpensive massage.
,,Lots of places to eat,5.0,,Great food and lots of little market stalls. The shops were not too keen on haggling however but most things were pretty cheap anyway. Look out for the big food court in one of the shopping centres for lunch and sit and eat next to the locals at a fraction of the price you find in hotels and restaurants.
,,mass of humanity,5.0,,Worth the visit to see the architecture and the area. 2 parts of Chinatown the very commercial with shops and the off streets with no people just interesting store. Get a map of Chinatown and follow the trails
,,Busiest During CNY,4.0,,"It's a must to visit the place especially for foreigners who need a little of cultural experience on their trip. It's Chinatown, like everywhere else's Chinatown but there are other good spots to see such as the Coins & Notes Museum and the Tintin Shop.

Lots of cheap stuff are sold along the streets but it's not really a good place to go to when it is raining. A must try is their Mango Sago dessert which I think should be pretty famous among locals.

If you want to get away from the busyness of the place, walk a little distance to Ann Siang Hill where foreign coffee shops are lined up. There are also temples closeby such as the Sri Mariamman Temple - the oldest temple in Singapore."
,,Fantastic place to shop and eat,5.0,,"Trade and bargain at a fraction of the Orchard Road prices. Eat with the locals at stalls, which will cost less than $10 for lunch."
,,Classic,5.0,,"All you would think of a Chinatown, Great bargains, lots food courts."
,,Chinatown,3.0,,"Lots of places to eat, food was good. Good place to buy souvenirs. Area wasn't very clean, but that how Chinatowns are."
,,Fun Place!! Good souvenirs,4.0,,"If you're looking for some good souvenirs of Singapore, you can find them in Chinatown. Also lots of great eateries. It's always fun to walk up and down the streets and really experience (sight, sound, smell) a place."
,,You really get into Asia here,4.0,,"I think it is a must if you go to Singapore as you could truly believe that you are in a another city. Go and mix with the crowd, try the food and smell the air as that´s something you won´t forget. Try the shopping too."
,,really happening,4.0,,you can get alot of cheap stuff over there. the restaurants there is expensive & commercialised. you can just try local hawker center instead.
,,Singapore's Chinatown is a great area to explore day or night.,5.0,,"Singapore's Chinatown is a great area to explore day or night. There are lots of shops selling the usual trinkets, T-shirts, and gadgets as well as others that offer quality merchandise at reasonable cost. I like the restaurants who server a beer for 5.5 SGD
Most of the food is acceptable priced for Singapore standard."
,,Lost it.,3.0,,Absolutely lost the local colors. Everything you see has a bit of elements from other countries but Singapore.
,,Different,4.0,,Great to see and very different from the rest of Singapore.
,,Great Place,5.0,,Great place for bargains. Would definitely go again.
,,"""No photos allowed""",2.0,,"If you try to take a photo of the shop from outside, you may be stopped by the shopkeeper. What a waste really as the shop is part of what makes up Chinatown and we are here to get the experience. Another negative point is you have to pay for using their toilet. And there is no toilet paper provided. It is pathetic. What an arachaic system in this age!"
,,Best enjoyed with alot of time to walk around.,4.0,,Spent a whole afternoon there jump walking through the market and taking in the atmosphere. Lots of shops and people but I wouldn't say it's too over the top. I particularly enjoyed seeing the old revamped housing of the early day Chinese settlement. Make sure to look up whilst walking through the street market.
,,Fun and educational Chinatown....,5.0,,"Singapore's Chinatown is a great area to explore day or night. Several of the streets are blocked to auto traffic and crowded with shoppers and gawkers. There are lots of shops selling the usual trinkets, T-shirts, and gadgets as well as others that offer quality merchandise at reasonable cost. There are some super little food stalls with delicious Pan-Asian options at much lower cost than you will find in the area's cafes and the opportunity to sit outside made it even better. In the heart of the district is the Chinese Cultural Center and two major temples, giving you the chance to learn a bit more about Chinese influence in Singapore. We were there during the Lunar New Year celebrations and got to see lots of free performances at the cultural centers outdoor, but covered, performance venue. We had such a good time that we came back a second time just to eat and shop and a third time just to walk around and take photos. I recommend a visit for all Singapore visitors."
,,S'pore China Town,4.0,,"Too much changes & commercialisation. Loose the Chinese favour. It is purely a place where imported Chinese product from China, Taiwan & some Singaporean produces. This is Singapore, changing too fast."
,,Worth Spending a day/half a day,3.0,,Very cheep tourist items everywhere. Make sure you shop around because you will always find a cheaper price in the stores deeper in Chinatown away from the more tourist areas. The temple in Chinatown is stunning.
,,China Town Singapore,3.0,,"Always very busy, some nice cultural sites and you can find some good tours both by day and night - the walking ones are best"
,,Try for the novelty,4.0,,"A little bit crowded in the evening, but highly recommended for those who wish to experience authentic Chinese street food fare. One tip, like in most hawker centres in SG, establishments are rated based on quality and cleanliness, so if you're the squeamish type, choose the ones with A rating. But personally, even those with B and C ratings are pretty decent. Germans would have a good time there by the way since sausages like Weisswurst, bratwurst etc. are available. The eatery is run by an Austrian.

With regards to souvenirs, chopsticks in Chinatown are quite cheap; you can buy a good pair for 1 SG dollar."
,,Chinatown - for shopping and dining,5.0,,"A ""must see"" for anyone visiting Singapore. You can soak up some of the history of Singapore, buy tons of souvenirs for your friends back home and then relax with a great meal. I prefer to go in the morning or in the evening to avoid the heat."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"We were lucky enough to arrive on the morning of Chinese New Year's eve. The streets were lined with market stalls, brilliant colours - predominantly red and yellow, and crowds of busy shoppers. We loved the food hawkers - inexpensive yet excellent food eaten in the open air. The Chinese temples are beautiful, ornate and brightly coloured - well worth photographing. We were sad to leave!"
,,Chinatown,4.0,,"We went when it was Chinese new year and the place was mental. Very busy, colourful and great place to be and soak in the atmosphere.Lots of stalls, places to eat and shop"
,,Chinatown,5.0,,A very good Chinatown. I had the insiders tour of it by my Singapore Chinese friend. Well worth seeing.
,,Best Place to Shop,4.0,,Best Place to Shop ... All asian stuff you can easily buy here in China Town ..
,,Enchanting,5.0,,"Chinatown, not as exciting as KL's but still enchanting. Spend two different nights there and enjoyed the soft shell crabs and the cheap beer, will be back."
,,Great.,4.0,,Love Chinatowns all over the world and their differences. This one has amazing food even at the touristy places and the usual abrasive service. Great shopping but Singapore is really expensive
,,all the same stuff,3.0,,"this china-town is no different that china town anywhere else - it's good for a short walk, but not amazing."
,,Good experience,3.0,,"Lots of clothing, Chinese traditional medicine, food and tea stores.You can try so many types of Chinese good food with reasonable price. Most of the area in Chinatown are dirty and run down. Very crowded most of the time."
,,"Slightly manufactured, but good for pictures",3.0,,"Chinatown in Singapore is slightly ""manufactured"" but the atmosphere and architecture are interesting and good for pictures. Try going in the late afternoon/evening time as it'll be slightly cooler."
,,Very Touristy but still an enjoyable experience.,4.0,,There is a lot of tat for sale but still a good day out and you can enjoy a meal that does not break the bank. At Chinese New Year the whole of Chinatown is exceptionally busy so if crowds are not your thing go another time
,,Great place to grab a bargain!,5.0,,"If you're looking for a bargain, this is the place to shop! A good place to pick up small, inexpensive gifts and souvenirs for just about anyone. The (product) quality is decent and the food in Chinatown ""Food Street"" is fabulous! Try the Chinese BBQ Pork - Char Siu. We ate at Da Dong Restaurant for lunch and were not disappointed. It's been around since 1928."
,,Very chinese,5.0,,"This part of town is a very nice part of the well preserved part of Singapore. Hopefully this will stay like this for quite a while, as this has old roots. Meaning no new concrete buildings. When in Singapore a must to see what it must have been 100 years ago."
,,Maxwell Food Centre,5.0,,"If you seek a delicious Hainan chicken rice in Singapore, this hawker centre is definitely the place to visit."
,,Truly Asia,5.0,,"You could easily visit Singapore and eat just western food, never see much other than the bay and partake in one Singapore Sling, but it would be a crime! Visiting places like China Town and little India is what makes Singapore so diverse and great! You only have to travel 5 mins out of the central business district to visit China town. China town is cheap for beer, great for authentic Asian dishes, brilliant for Chinese souveniers, tailors and temples. Not only that, but the streets are small, colourful and you cannot help, but soak up every ounce of atmosphere. Visiting China Town makes you realise you really are in Asia and I pinch myself all the time that I get to call Singapore Home!"
,,The vibrant atmosphere of Singapore Chinatown leading up to Lunar New Year,5.0,,"For the second time in 3 years, my wife and I visited Signapore just before Lunar New Year. Chinatown is a must see any time of the year, but the two weeks leading up to Lunar New Year are the best. It seems like all of Singapore heads to Chinatown during that time and the vibrant atmosphere is contagious.

The Hawker Food Stalls on Smith Street and also on Maxwell Road, should not be missed. Just across from the Maxwell Food Centre be sure to stop in to see the Buddah Tooth Relic Temple that is especially ornate for the days leading up to Lunar New Year.

For a great boutique hotel nearby, that is not too expensive, try the Berjaya Hotel on Duxton Road. They serve a wonderful breakfast."
,,Go at the evening!,5.0,,"Chinatown has it's own atmosphere. The lights, the restaurants and the countless little stores where you can buy cheap presents. It worth to take a walk there."
,,Must See!,4.0,,"Chinatown fans will love Singapore's Chinatown. It's pretty, with restored shop houses lining each and every block. Has places of interest (like the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and the Chinese Heritage Museum), good food, hotels and hostels, and street stalls for clothes and toys. Enjoyable!"
,,great time in the ole town tonight,4.0,,"spend your heart out wont cost you a packet ,mind you ,you wont be walking out with the top end products but for all the nicknacks you promised to take home to all the aunties and uncles and the buy us a present while you o/seas friends this is the place to be /go for it"
,,Chinatown,5.0,,This place is a great place for cheap gifts and souvenirs. The night market is a must see also. It is packed.
,,A piece of old Singapore,4.0,,"We visited at Chinese New Year so the area was full of dragons and lanterns. The shops are mostly the original ""shophouses"", small with living rooms above. Plenty of cheap clothes and tacky souvenirs. Beware the jewellery shops they are pricey but you can haggle and get a good discount.Remember it's only a bargain if it's something you really want so be prepared to walk away."

,,"Crowded with people, full of life",4.0,,"We went to the beautiful Thien Hok Keng temple - there weren't any tourists - so the atmosphere was grave and reflective. After the consumerism and bustle of Singapore, it was a welcome break. It is also worth visiting a Chinese medicine shop, even if you don't actually buy anything. Avoid the souvenir shops -the Tintin shop is fun, however."

,,chinatown,4.0,,as usual the chinatown is. the hawker area is very good to have chineese food here. Be careful while asking them that what is complimentary or not else they pretend that this is free. But later they give you the bill to pay.

You'll get to see temples of all religions, markets and lots of shop houses. This is also the place to tacky souveniers and lovely silk lanterns and caligraphy artwork.

Also very close to Club Street and Ang Siang Hill for some great bars and restaurants.

,,chinatown and the heritage centre,4.0,,THe heritage centre in chinatown is well worth a visit. It recreates life in a chinatown slum dwelling in the early part of the century and is very atmospheric and brings home the conditions poor immigrants from China faced in those times

Of course, there are the three famous hawker centres in Chinatown - Smith Street Market, People's Park Market and Maxwell Market, offering wonderfully local experience in an otherwise touristy historic district. The public flats at Smith Street also provide wonderful contrasts of the old and new - if you are interested to see how the locals live, they the lift up to the higher floors! Enjoy a panoramic view of Chinatown from there!

There is also People's Park Complex for local shopping, and for Chinese goods shopping, head to the famous Yue Hwa store for large variety of imported goods from China. Remember to bring back the famous barbequed pork from Lim Chee Guan or Bee Chien Hiang etc (free to sample) - must try!"

,,Touristy but good photo opps,4.0,,"You will encounter lots of other tourists here, but the locals frequent this neighborhood as well. Leading up to Chinese New Year, Chinatown gets PACKED!

This was the place originally where all the chinese stay and make a livelihood. As such, you will find all sorts of chinese food and items here.

Still packed the old world charm if you visit during the chinese new year season where the streets will be filled with vendors selling all kinds of items. dress light while visiting this place as it can get very crowded."

This is a result of the fact that, because of its location, Chinatown's water supply was principally transported by animal-driven carts in the 19th century. Every year, Chinatown becomes the centre of attention for the Chinese New Year celebrations. and the who district comes alive with people, decorations and street vendors. It's no different this year, and if you happen to be coming to Singapore, it'll be a great place to be."

,,"One of Singapore's highlights, and good place to shop",5.0,,The new Budhist Temple across for the Hawker Food Stalls is simply gorgeous. Be sure to visit all floors of the temple. It is an artistic gem and remarkably peaceful. Be sure to see the priest blessing all the young married couples. The Hindu temple in Chinatown is amazing with all of the colorful art on the sides of the building and on the central tower. It is a beehive of activity. Chinatown is the best place to buy souvenirs and gifts.
,,just can't get enough,5.0,,"Great foods , I love the old shop houses and just exploring the streets late into the night"

,,Celebrate the New Year Here,4.0,,"Chinatown is interesting any time of the year, but try to see it decorated for Chinese New Year."
,,Best Chinatown I've ever visitied,5.0,,"Fantastic atmosphere with great bars, restaurants and shops. The charming colonial enhance the sparking red lanterns and delightful decorations on the lively streets. I enjoyed reflexology for $10 and it was fantastic... we also had our fortune told by a local character who had us in stitches with his humorous method of predicting our destiny. I would have loved to visit the area after dark as some of the bars looked so full of atmosphere and life...I would definitely recommend and hopefully return"
,,Worth a look,3.0,,"Worth a look, especially in the run-up to Lunar (Chinese) New Year but I dislike the hard sell from shops and cafes. Prices at eateries there are inflated versus two streets away."
,,Singapore,3.0,,"Like all the other ""Chinatowns"" of the World. Plenty of kiosks, selling cheap souvenirs, cameras accessories, lens, tripods, restaurants with all type of foods, goods, seeds. Very busy, very turistic, very average.
Nothing really special.
Only recommended if you spend more than 3 days in town or if you tour with the hop-on hop-off (heading into Chinatown)."
,,stuff your face,4.0,,Good cheap local food. Really cheap and cheerful and a good atmosphere
,,great walk and great bargain,4.0,,"walking there is nice with lotsa colorful buildings and not really afraid of snatch theft. loves the ornaments displayed along the road. It seems like in Chinatown, everyday is Chinese New Year"
,,A definite must stop while in Singapore,4.0,,"I thought that this place was quite fascinating. Yes, it's a tad bit touristy, but on the other hand, its feels truly genuine, and have also made it a ""must go to"" location whenever I've traveled to Singapore. One main reason? There's no shortage of food stalls and restaurants to choose from in Chinatown and you're greeted by all the entrances into this section by brightly colored red lanterns that hang all throughout the streets. Also, there's no shortage of vendors to buy that special gift from and for myself, being a serious music lover, I've taken to buying two very cool Chinese music cds from a local vendor who specialized in music cds and even traditional Chinese musical instruments. This place also makes for a nice location to walk around in the evening when all of the lanterns are lit up (and the temperature hopefully a little cooler than what could be expected during the daytime).
Overall, it's a nice place to visit and would certainly recommend to anyone visiting to see it.
* There's also a very VERY cool red shrine located near the southeastern corner of Chinatown near Sago Lane and is right in front of the Chinatown Complex (the building that houses a large range of food vendors as well as as clothing and other assorted items)."
,,Lost Charm,3.0,,"Modernization and urbanization to this place where the old Singapore pioneers used to gather have totally turned this place into yet another urban/polished shopping district. Tried what may, the lost charm of this place cannot be replaced with all the man-made structures. Chinatown will not be chinatown without the traditional noise and smell. SAD....."
,,Cultural immersion,4.0,,"The Chinatown area of Singapore is a wonderful enclave of Chinese culture. Bright & colourful, authentic shops containing goods and food, friendly characters. Even the Chinese shop here. A very pleasant way to pass a couple of hours."
,,Easy Shopping & Just Great Walking Around,5.0,,"Loved Chinatown, after a bit of shopping, lovely to sit in one of the outdoor cafe's & have a cooling drink in the shade. Did not mind the morning/afternoons showers at all - go with the 'flow' like the Singaporeans do."
,,Still a great place to visit,5.0,,Make the effort to go it's well worth it. Have a wander around Peoples Park and then head across the road to the old shop house area.
,,Extensive renovations,2.0,,We could not get a good appreciation of this area as there was scaffolding everywhere but we did manage to weave our way through this and you can experience the atmosphere of the Chinese marketplace and this was interesting.
,,fun and bargain,5.0,,"Every time I'm in Singapore I take at least two trips to Chinatown, it's a funny place where you can enjoy very good traditional food and you can make some excellent deal on chinese manufactures (paintings, pottery etc.). If you are looking for fortune cats don't go to the shop close to the Tooth Relic Temple items are double the price in the other Chinatown shops. Excellent minispas for reflexology"
,,Small but nice place,3.0,,The place was small but the area is nice. Nothing special but fun to see.
,,Singapore Chinatown,4.0,,"When in Singapore you must visit Chinatown. As it is the year of the dragon it was beautifully decorated with red, red, and more red! We went in the afternoon so was very cool, and was empty. Bought some souvenirs. Most places were fixed prices, which we were ok with that, so less hassle.

Iis very clinical as it is a very clean chinatown as to what i remembered it to be. But a must visit when in Singapore. Wasnt too keen on the food here, maybe we didnt know what to order, but wasnt a hapenning thing."
,,Great food,5.0,,We enjoyed a great late night meal here with the locals. Order a few dishes and drink some beer!
,,Still excellent for bargains,5.0,,Chinatown is still a place for bargains if you look around. We had some clothes made there with no problems and were very pleased with the result. Food and souvenirs are still cheap and great value and the hawkers are pleasant.
,,Chinatown,5.0,,Great shopping and food but go at night for the lights and atmosphere
,,"Artificial ""Chinatown""",3.0,,"The hustling and bustling of Chinatown in the pre-60s has long gone, replaced by clinically clean and preserved buildings that are kept only at the facade, but where are working class? where are the dirty streets and noise typical of most Chinatown? No more. The new Chinatown is in Geylang."
,,"Nice place to shop, eat, and drink...",4.0,,"This is probably a must see area when visiting Singapore. It located near downtown, boat quay, etc. thus easy to get to. Souvenirs are cheap, Tiger is cheap, and overall just a nice casual enjoyable environment."
,,cheap as chips,4.0,,the place to get a bespoke suit of cheap food and gifts
,,Crowded but colourful,3.0,,"It gets pretty hot and crowded out there, especially Pagoda Street and there are lots of annoying touts but it's interesting if you've never seen a Chinatown before (is that possible?!) Mosque Street nearby has some cheap hostels and an internet cafe but watch your pockets."
,,crowded but with lots of character ....,5.0,,"went on the seconnd day of new year and with chineese new year aroung the cornor , the street was filled up with people , both local and tourist .

plenty of things to purchase and eat . in particular you will have wide variety to buy i phone covers , generally sold for 10 dollars ."
,,Great place to go for good finds,3.0,,"Singapore isn't really the cheapest place to shop but if you want good finds or if your aim is to pay for the items you see in the other tourist areas at a cheaper price, Chinatown is the go-to place. Food here is excellent, but make sure you thoroughly scout for good food. I would suggest going for mini hot-pots, pot stickers, and noodle-soups since they cost less but taste better compared to the pricey restos around Singapore. When shopping, scout for the cheapest option since stores compete in terms of price and the best prices are found in the innermost part of Chinatown. When buying garments, beware the Indian tailors who sell Chinese dresses since they tend to double the price of these dresses. However, if you plan to have clothes re-adjusted, I would definitely recommend the Indian tailors. Last tip, try staying in a hotel outside Chinatown since it gets too crowded. I would recommend Park Regis which is a 5 minute walk away."
,,Chinese shopping heaven!,4.0,,"Plenty of shopping opportunities here for you shopping addicts especially if you are into Chinese goods. We were there on a public holiday, January 2nd 2012 and the place was packed!! Couldn't move for people! Plenty of interesting smells, culture and extremely colourful! Well worth the visit."
,,It is like chinatown everywhere else,3.0,,"It is not different from china town you might have seen in other countries. If you are short on time, then give it is miss. There is a buddhist and an indian temple in china town, which you can visit while there."
,,nothing to see,2.0,,you may find there a market with cheap souvenirs and nothing more
,,Beware the Tourist Scams in Chinatown,2.0,,"Sit down at an alley side table in Chinatown and be prepared to pay for your napkins, peanuts and whatever else they can squeeze out of you. We paid $74 for a lunch meal which was not nearly as good as the price would portray. Instead try an Austrian sausage and save yourself about $60. Go here for Erich's place http://wuerstelstand.blogspot.com/. The restaurant that rips off tourists is directly across the Alley from Erich's.

Want to pee, also be prepared to pay 10 cents. I have no idea what the Tourist and GST fees equating to 17% are used for, but it isn't for restrooms."
,,mix of cultures,5.0,,Great area with great people... Really wicked budish temples around as well and good food. We loved the cocrodile!
,,The new Change Ally!,5.0,,"Well 10 min. walk from our hotel, just great, reminds you of the old ""Change Ally"" fantastic shops barter is a must! The indian temple is also a must see $3 to use your camera"

,,Must See While in Singapore,5.0,,"This has to be on your list of things to do while in Singapore. Shopping, temples, food...plan on 3+ hours. Don't forget to negotiate on any purchases. Don't pay full price, negotiating is expected."
,,A MUST for lovers of good authentic chinese food.,5.0,,"We just love to sit at one of these restaurants and enjoy the atmosphere, the food and the friendly chinese service. Absolutely no rip off what the prices for food concern no matter whre you go to eat. The shops are most interesting and it's fun to shop in Chinatown. Just love it and don't miss out on a visit each time we find ourselves in Singapore."
,,Souvenir heaven !,3.0,,Great place to buy souvenirs. Visit this place on the first day and buy all the souvenirs and dont buy from anywhere else. This way you will save money from expensive souvenir shops at various tourist attractions.
,,Good Area to buy cheap thing and eating,5.0,,"The thing very cheap and the chinese food not bad,the souvenier cheap than other place"
,,Can´t miss it!,4.0,,"Chinatown is a must see everywhere you go, it displays their culture and you can learn a lot from listening to their inhabitants talk while offering cheap items. Food is great and you have several options to choose from, definetaly a must do here!"
,,Ann Siang Hill - a haven near Chinatown,4.0,,"During the festive season I escaped the madness of Orchard Road to Chinatown. After pushing through the mostly kitzchy souvenir stalls (except for the TinTin Shop) on Pagoda Street you will see the Hindu Temple. Across the street from the temple is the road leading to Ann Siang Hill where there are lovely converted shophouses housing boutiques, wine bars, cafes where you could sit down for a glass of wine after a walk around the charming area. Drop by the ultra camp Scarlet Hotel on Erskine Road - their roof top bar opens at 6pm and supposedly has great views over Chinatown. If you're looking for something different to do - don't miss this quiet piece of heaven in Singapore."
,,Place to buy souvernirs,4.0,,"Chinatown brought a lot of authentic restaurants, seafood and otherwise. Our main reason gor the visit was to pick up some souvenirs and gifts. Quite pricey as they all try their luck with the pricing, so make sure you bargain, even with the shops!"
,,Get immersed,4.0,,"Before you buy any of the souvenirs that you see on Orchard, take the time to go to Chinatown. Merchandise galore--and lots of great restaurants and markets."
,,A Fantastic Bhudist Temple,4.0,,"If you have time to do only one thing in Singapore, visiting the Bhudist Temple in Chinatown is the place to go. This beatiful place, with thousand of Bhuda images, the golden Altars and the praying Monks is undoubtely a fantastic adventure in the midle of Chinatown in Singapore. In addition to that, the Chinese markets, with the food courts and hundreds of small shops, could be a tourist traps, but they are a wonderful place to observe the local chinese population and the colorful decorations, the tipical sounds and oily smell from the fry foods. A fantastic sensorial experience. In addition to that, not to far from chinatown you can visit the Hindu temple, another fantastic experience, mainly if you visit tehm during one of their festivities."
,,Get some history,4.0,,"This gives you an feel for the old Singapore, much of which has been sanitized and modernised - a great place for local food"
,,Interesting,4.0,,Intersting place for shopping and eat. Delicious chinese food. Seems a bit more westernized than the real China.
,,A must visit for tourists and even local,5.0,,"Conveniently located next to the MRT station. There are so many restaurants in Chinatown and I love those serving the steamboat buffet - really worth the money. There are many local delights in the hawker centre (food court) in Chinatown - I could eat 3 bowls of the Chicken rice from Heng Ji which is on the 2nd level! The coffee from the stall ""50s"" is also something I will not miss. I will also go to a shop ""Big China"" to buy the mooncakes. A good place to buy souvenirs too - Many of the keychains are sold for only S$1 or 12 for S$10."
,,"Fantastic food, great value",5.0,,"Caught the mrt to chinatown, only 3 stops from Marina Bay. Brilliant food and great prices for Singapore. Interesting architecture in some of the side streets."
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,Not sure what i expected but on the upside was to experience a proper chinatown with nice little eateries for genuine chinese cousines. On the downside the realisation that every other store is offering the same nick-nacks...
,,Great Shopping,5.0,,A shoppers paradise for those nik nacks and presents. Don't forget to barter in some of the establishments.
,,"If you know the place, it is almost always a good place to go.",4.0,,"I used to go to Chinatown area everyday with my schoolmates when I was studying as my school is just within the area. Almost everywhere in Chinatown have been explored by myself.

Used to be a very exciting place compared to other places in Singapore and you can see alot of things, food, happenings. There was a very exciting local wet market in Chinatown whereby I saw almost extinct animals like small deers (yellow golden fur) selling as pet for S$50, all kinds of snakes, bats, exotic animals etc. Also exotic food like turtle soup, lizard and rabbit meat etc. But you don't get to see that anymore.

Nowadays, Chinatown is very much quieter and the people there are also different. You can see more of the young Chinese from China there which you don't get to see years ago due to the immigration policies towards Chinese from China. There is a lost of the original Singaporean Chinese culture in Chinatown and it is been replacing at a fast rate taking over by the China (PRC) Chinese.

There is a variety of food in Chinatown and there are places that I still can recommend although many great food have extinct or lost their original forms."
,,Chinatown is a must visit in Singapore,4.0,,"Chinatown is a must visit. Excellent for ""small"" shopping and good food. Amongst the more traditional Chinese tourist shops, the Tin Tin shop was amazing. My kids loved it. Just beware of bargaining and the small ""polite almost harassment"" by the local shop owners trying to sell their goods. Very safe and should take kids. Visit the Relic Tooth Buddhe Temple whilst there. A must visit."
,,Dont miss the Chinatown Heratige Museum,5.0,,"The museum is well set up with original living quarters and stories of those who lived there. Chinatown itself is a bit of a let down as the Chinese love to spit.. a bit disconcerting when its the person stirring the food people will be eating...Smoking is also on the increase with new designated smoking areas now in many areas of Singapore,, a reall backwards step ."
,,A little bit of everything...,4.0,,"Loved Chinatown. Brilliant food & .interesting shopping. A must visit is the Chinese Heritage Centre, where nothing is behind glass and things are in their original place. (very sad, but very worth it.) Mao's favourite pork dish was sensational."
,,Awesome place to shop and explore,5.0,,"We did the hop on/off tour and jumped off in Chinatown. We got a bite to eat, shopped and shopped some more. I really enjoyed my time in this area. Beautiful colors for photos! I would go back again if I had the chance!"
,,Great place for bargain hunt,5.0,,Good place for bargain shopping and eating. Many market stalls on side streets. Worth walking around the many shopping malls. The metro will take you to the heart of China Town.
,,Cute heritage area,4.0,,"Chinatown has loads of cute and well-maintained shops, but the only thing is that the original traders in these buildings have long gone, having been replaced by watering holes and legal firms, to name a few. This dents the appeal a bit, as there is no longer the ""life"" that the area used to be unique for, unlike what we can find in Penang."
,,"Shopping, eating & visiting in China Town",4.0,,"Walking along Pagoda Street is an interesting experience & also it has an entrance to the MRT station.
Maxwell Road Food Centre is a must. It is a bit out of the way and not very attractive from outside, but once you go in and walk around, you will have difficulty choosing from the wide range of delicious food and you will find things to cater for how hungry you are. Don't forget to stop by the drink stalls."
,,Great bargains you can barter for as you wander around the sights and then top it off with some great chinese cooking.,5.0,,"What a myriad of sights and sounds with bargains to be bartered for and had in electronics, clothing and souvenirs. Start your bargain hunting under cover in the ""Peoples Park Complex"" on the Eu Tong Sen St. side of the Chinatown MRT where there are plenty cameras, computers and other electronics to be had and then wander through the street markets on the other side of the road for more bargains and souvenirs. Make sure you visit the Indian and Chinese temples in South Bridge Rd. at the far end of the markets. The Chinese temple is particularly impressive and it can take a bit of time to view it all. We found a great little Sichuan restaurant at 33 Mosque St. called Si Wei Mao Cai. If you like spicy Chinese food then this is a must because the food was outstanding."
,,Not only for the Chinese,5.0,,"Visit Chinatown close to Chinese/Lunar New Year Period. You would be able to see the festive decorations and tonnes of people flocking down to CHinatown for goodies and bargains.

Over the years, Chinatown might have lost some of its heritage culture due to moderrnisation. However, it still try to maintain its culture as closely as possible.

Be sure to try Barbeque Pork (Bak Kwa as they called it) and take a look at those cheongsams. But be careful, prices may not be cheap"
,,Walk in Chinatown,4.0,,Very nice place - somehow what you expect. Somehow authentic - lot of shops with funny things and souvenirs. Got a haircut for 15 SD - great!
,,Hawker centre,5.0,,"just had to try the food here after reading some travel books, i had chilli crab and it was delicious a great experience if not the cleanest place in the world to eat but very very cheap"
,,Aunthentic,5.0,,"As you would expect Chinatown is vibrant and colourful. Great place to mooch around and there are not that many touts who bother you. In fact the only people that attempted to ""sell stuff"" were the tailors."
,,Good place to visit,4.0,,"Very much worth a visit to China Town. A lot of the good are the same but you can definitely barter for a better price.
They don't just have local tourist stuff but also some very unique items.
Have some good local restaurants including a great Thai restaurant with delightful and reasonably priced food.
A must see."
,,You Have To Go There,5.0,,We visited Chinatown at night to have a meal and we were not disappointed with the choice on offer. We had a lovely meal and afterwards had a walk through the shops in the area.
,,shopping addict,5.0,,"My first time in Singas i stayed in Chinatown and always coming there since to do souvenir shopping, some of it were tacky as common souvenirs, but i really enjoyed shopping there. I like the environment of Chinatown, i think that what makes me always coming back there everytime i'm in Singas."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,A very nice experience to visit China Town. It seems very authentic and there were a good atmosphere and it was very worth while spending the hours there
,,So much fun,5.0,,"We did this as part of a tour and it was brilliant. The tour included:
- A trip to a calligrapher who produces a fan with your name on
- A meal in a Chinese restaurant
- The opportunity to browse the stalls in Chinatown
- A Tri-shaw ride to the quays
- A Bumboat ride along the quays

Highly recommend!"
,,Temples and shopping -side streets or main street,4.0,,"I like the food court here in the basement next to the MRT (Metro station). Be aware though, that inside the money changers do NOT always put their rates on the board. This means you ar expected to ask them what their rate is then they may not let you go.
Take a walk up Mosque street to the very end and should bring you out onto a street with a temple or two.
(Chinese and Indian temple.)

Vegetarian food can be found cheaper inside the foodcourts than on the street if you look around.

Pagoda street is more expensive to eat and drink since this is the more touristy area adn you may get hassled by a tailor!!"
,,"Hustle and bustle with the markets, take time out for special meal",4.0,,"Daytime or Nightime a walk around China Town is well worth while, restaurants are not well appointed looking more like transport cafes with plastic chairs in shop fronts , but dont be misled the food is what you are there for and you will not be disappointed. The markets will allow you to walk off the meal and savour the vibrancy of close quarter shopping."
,,Chinatown - complete contrast to modern Singapore,4.0,,Every major city has it's Chinatown with a similar history of why Chinese immigrants moved in. Singapore's story is very similar but what makes this area different is the contrast from the skyscrapers and modern architecture that you first encounter. You get the hustle and bustle of a living community from food courts selling delicious food to market street sellers and herbal medicine shops. Follow the well posted trail and you wander down side streets selling the usual tourist tack but you also encounter some gems. Chinatown Heritage Centre on Pagoda street gives you an insight on how these first immigrants survived and were forced to live. The wet market in Chinatown Complex on Trengganu street allows you to experience the sights and smells of fresh Chinese ingredients. Lots of signs around explaining it's checkered past. Stop at the hawker food stalls for excellent fresh food. Chinatown is well worth a mornings visit.
,,Need some cheap souvenirs...chinatown is best place.,5.0,,"You want a picture of a Hindu temple, a mosque, chinese caracters, grab some cheap food or if you have to bring some souvenirs for friends...Chinatown is the place to be."

Would love to visit again and highly recommended either to stay nearby or visit by MRT if staying elsewhere!"
,,Just another china town,3.0,,A China town is a china town .... It would be same through out the world :)... Therefore this one is also nothing special..The food street is good and the cheap shopping stalls are the way they normally are. So if you have never seen a china town.. then dont miss this... otherwise you wouldnt miss much even if you miss this one. Just take a 40 mins walk through this one to get the feel.
,,Touristy,3.0,,"Chinatown has a few streets that are really just for tourists = menus all in English, sovenir shops and the like. Little India is much more authentic."
,,Good place for hawker food,4.0,,Recommend to visit Chinatown from 6pm onwards. You get to shop for souvenirs and plenty of hawker stall to try (open 6pm onwards).
,,Souvenir Shopping,5.0,,"Take MRT to Chinatown exit and shop souvenir there. Numerous stores selling singapore souvenirs (keychains, magnets, silk, tshirts and etc.) with much less $$$ than similar products at Changi airport. No bargain needed, all prices are posted and mostly the same price from store to store."
,,Food Street not to be missed,4.0,,Make sure you visit Food Street at night... great experience.. awesome food... and clean!
,,Exploring China Town,5.0,,"Visiting China Town is fun, it is always busy there and nice places to eat"
,,China Town,5.0,,"This is a place where both the tourist and the locals like myself would go...
Hence the prices of stuff there are very local. No worries (except for gifts shops where only tourist would go).
Food there are also fantastic ... go to the Kerate food centre - a multi story complex where the basement is the wet market (fresh food - uncooked food), the ground level is where they sell general stuff like clothings and shoes, the 1st level is where the best food are...
Go to the stall where they do not call you to sit down and eat - these stalls are the ones local eat ..."
,,Way better then little india!,4.0,,Great shopping and food. Some items were even cheaper then I got in Thailand. Much cleaner then little india.
,,roamin place,4.0,,"chek out prices of stuff before u reach chinatown, comparison is not always nice, but still souvenirs are nicely riced. nice sugar cane drinnks there, chinese couisine also there, very much crowded and not absolutely clean like ther parts of singpore, but shopkeepers dont bargain, and its better that they dont, prices look good"
,,Great place to shop,4.0,,"Good place to walk around, do some shopping and get some food. The restaurants here serve good food at reasonable prices compared to the places in Boat Quay - and the food is sometimes better."
,,Probably the Cleanest Chinatown in the world,4.0,,"Don't get your expectations tooo high...but yea, it's much cleaner than Chinatowns in NYC, SF, Toronto, London. Really good food if you know where to go. Cheap wares and lots of flea markets"
,,A must,5.0,,Great to make a trip to China Town. Still a bustling place with lots of shops selling various medical supplies. Some great cheap resturants and lots of stalls selling souvenirs. Usually gets busy late afternoon and early evening but still good fun
,,suites for Indonesian who likes to shop for souvenirs,4.0,,"can buy any souvenirs you need here, cheap too. no need to bargain, prices are based on per 3 pcs and more"
,,Very Crowded,3.0,,"If you frequent south-east asia, then china town will not be a new experience for you. It essentially comprises of many little stalls selling a lot of the same crap as you would find anywhere else, in any market in asia. The prices are not great, the variety is questionable and the crowds can be very testing given the surprisingly small space to move around in. We happened to visit close to Chinese New Year which admittedly was not well thought out especially as we had a small child and stroller. I am sure that at quieter times of year, it would be less busy and more pleasant.

My main takeway from this excursion was that it didn't really stand out from other markets in S E asia and as such, I was not impressed. If you have not visited an asian market before, it will give yuo an authentic enough experience and is still worth the trip. There are cheap eats there and some good knick-knack/ souvenir shopping to be done and it is well situated to public transport."
,,Great Night Market and Food Street,5.0,,This china town the cleanest we have ever seen. Wonderful to wander through. Great bargains and be sure to stop at Eat Street where local carts and restuarants set up shop in the middle of the street. Great food!

,,"Nice, interesting.",4.0,,"Nice to walk true. Good food, good shoping. was ok."
,,"Fun, inexpensive shopping",4.0,,"Chinatown has several inexpensive restaurants with great local food, as well as a number of temples and classic Asian architecture. Otherwise, it's mostly a giant flea market: a great place for inexpensive souvenirs."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Chinatown was lovely to walk down their red lanterns shining brightly as we walked down the road. This is a very safe place to visit day or night. We went at night 7.00pm ish and wanted to observe the night life which was exciting and busy.
,,Great food experience,4.0,,There was a monster food court in a covered open sided market. Don't let your spouse go off alone - he'll get lost!

,,Shopping at flea markets,3.0,,"I did not like behavior of sellers: if you are a foreigner, then they tend to sell you making lies"
,,Modern Old Chinatown,3.0,,Modernised with lots of souvenir stalls mixed with Hindu temples. Does not have an old charm feel about it.
,,Beats Little India,5.0,,"Great location, great restaurants and very clean in comparision to Little India."
,,not very clean,3.0,,"the place is quite crowded, not clean, there're many ppl smoke in the hawker centres."
,,Just like all others,3.0,,"There is nothing terribly special about this China Town, once you've been to one they all look pretty much the same. The prices aren't that great, you have to be very knowledgeable of prices to get the best deals."
,,One of my favorite places in Singapore,5.0,,"Its a complete stress buster for me to goto Chinatown. Maybe because i know a lot of people and business owners. Its quite serene walking along the streets in the middle of all the souvenirs, the temples in the main road and the food stalls. But at least like in some of other chinatowns in the world. No one dare tries to dare hustle you into buying anything. Souvenirs pick up place for all tourist in Singapore. Also check out the Chinese Tooth Relic temple"
,,Simply adorable!,5.0,,"A unique Chinatown with its folklore, scents and dishes. Don't miss the Trishaw ride as it's a funny way to explore this area of the city."
,,Accessible by MRT - a good walking tour,3.0,,"Lots of shophouses and preserved buildings. Good restaurants, curio shops and quaint alleys"
,,Hustle and Bustle!,5.0,,"I just loved china town, the many shops, food and a few bars! Buying souveneirs was a hoot, By one for four singapore dollars and get three for $10sd. Brilliant!"
,,Kinda expected a lil more from it..,3.0,,Pretty cool to walk around at night. Interesting food and pretty decent prices; however this is coming from a backpacker so its hard to pay alot for food. Hawker stalls at lunch time in the 2nd floor on Smith street is a great deal though!
,,Great,5.0,,Food fantastic. Good bargains to be had. Just thouroughly enjoyable experience
,,Too crowdy,3.0,,I went on Sunday. This market was ok. It was very much crowded. Cleanliness was ok. You can have good food here. Suvenirs can be found in this market. You can have time pass here. It is just near MRT.
,,Full of lights and character,5.0,,Great little spot to check out. I recommend going at night as I have been during the day and the night and the night time is far better. Keep walking around until you find pagoda lane where all the food stalls are.
,,We didn't like...,1.0,,"We arrived in Chinatown in the afternoon. The shopping experience was terrible, because all the Chinese shop holders were trying to determine us to buy something from them and if not, they became nervous and they refused to say goodbye to us...
Cheep things, bad quality..."
,,Chinatown-market paradise,4.0,,"Good location to stay at, MRT handy nearby. Lots of accomodation on offer. But also good because there are so many hawker markets, food stalls, restaurants and markets to fulfil your every needs!

The markets are massive! Make sure you have lots of time to browse through. Start early"
,,They sell low quality shirts and shoes but still quite expensive.,3.0,,"There's a grocery at the first floor, goods were priced reasonably."
,,"Food, Food, and more Food...",5.0,,Walk from one end to the other and just sample the atmosphere and the different foods. People come here in the evenings and sit outside so all are on view. See something you like? Stop and try it.
,,Touristy yet still feeling authentic if you scratch the surface,4.0,,"We stayed close by and had many opportunities to wonder around Chinatown and were glad we did. Although with the usual tourist stalls and bars/cafes, there are however many good cheap hawker stalls and food centres and markets dotted around which make it well worth a visit. We preferred Singapores Chinatown to KL which we visited soon after."
,,Culture mix,4.0,,"Pagoda street offer great variety of culture, from chinese which was the prominent one, until the western food thas was also served there. Great place for budget shopper and traditional stuffthat you cant find in orchard."
,,Always china town no matter where you are at,4.0,,Disliked being hassled by 'government taxi' drivers looking for conmmissions from business in china town
,,Taste of China,4.0,,China town is souvenir palace!! really other than a bit of culture this area has been commercialised in the extreme but is great for a bit of bartering with the locals...good for some cheap stuff but no quality here!
,,Lots of things to be tempted by,5.0,,"I have been to Singapore lots of times and I always make my way down to Chinatown. The main place to start is Pagoda street as there are lots of stalls down here with interesting items for sale. A good place to buy hand crafted goods and clothing. China town has lots of nice places to eat from street vendors to more up market restaurants. For a bit of a cultural treat, try visiting the Sri Mariamman Hindu temple at the end of Pagoda Street, it is a wonder to behold."
,,Same as Chinatown Everywhere ..,3.0,,"Dull and boring with nothing special to spark the interest in terms of food, shopping or atmosphere"
,,Great area to wander about,4.0,,"Lots of sights, sounds, smells, shopping bargains, food - has it all really."
,,Fun to see - perfect to buy souvenires,5.0,,You can get a bit of a feeling of being on China market. Perfect spot to buy souvenirs. Nice templets to see. Don't miss them! They make the whole walk worth doing. Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Sri Mariamman Temple are the highlights.
,,good place for shopping,5.0,,"it was afternoon it was hot weather but nice staffs u can buy from there , i had a massage there is was nice ."
,,Mostly Tat,2.0,,"As most cheap markets around the world, it sells mostly tatty goods. We did find some lipstick boxes with an integral mirror, these were undoubtedly a bargain compared with elswhere. Apart from those we found nothing much of interest."
,,A must do in Singapore,4.0,,"We went to Chinatown in the afternoon, we did a bit of shopping had a couple of beers and had an early dinner in Smith Street. It's a nice area of Singapore which has alot of atmosphere, good bargains and a bit of history."
,,fun place for great little treats!,4.0,,"Love china town in Singapore, its a fun place to pick up some bargains & nice little gifts! some of the things you see fo sale in china town are being sold in the more expensive shops in centre of town or triple the price! You dont get to hassled by stall owners and are often just left in peace to browse - there are plenty places to eat and sit and have a nice cool beer and people watch! the MRT takes you right into the heart of the markets and is very handy, all in i love it :)"
,,Eating in the Street,5.0,,I love Chinese and Asian food so eating in Smith Street is always fantastic
,,Not the best Chinatown I've ever seen,3.0,,"When going to Chinatown, anywhere in the world, you expect to find rather unique items, at incredibly low prices. Usually there is great competition between two stores that carry similar items, which causes the prices to be very cheap.

However, interestingly, here the items are just as bog-standard as the ones in Chinatown New York, but for some reason, they cost a lot more. There is also a smaller variety of items. I thought that because of its location, far east, it would be even better than the other Chinatowns.

I honestly am hesitating about whether I should recommend this place or not. I think, that because of the extraordinary temple buried inside it, I will give it a yes.

Tip for all Chinatowns: Never go with the listed price. Always bargain, because it always works."
,,Fun area with good bargains,5.0,,"Although it was pouring rain during our afternoon visit, Chinatown is a fun, colorful area with bargains to be had, and wonderful (and safe) street food."
,,Great Food Options,5.0,,"Lots of market stalls, with cheap souvenirs. Great food options. Maxwell's Hawker Market was excellent and very cheap"
,,Not well maintain & deteriorated,3.0,,"Everytime I visit this place, It seem to me that less shop & high price. Quality of goods item is not upto the standard a few years back. Food quality was not attractive and good as before. Compare with KL and HK, they are better now. Feel sad to see it like this. I will not recommend to any newcomer. You better go to Bugis Junction for this souvenir things."
,,Colourful at Night,4.0,,Great experience moving around in China Town specially at night; the crowded street with colour lanterns and the sound of tourist and vendors all will have a great feeling such that we landed in a different world. Those who visit Singapore must vist China Town also preferably in Night without which your tour will not be completed.
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,Had a wonderful time in China Town. Great food in and around the place. Had a cup of juice (of fruit that I had never seen in my life) but was out of this world. and the shopping was fabulous ... defiantly a place not to miss. Happy shopping!
,,The real Singapore hustle is here,4.0,,Great for evenings. Go after dark and stroll the stalls for cheap and cheerful items. Then when you are done pick one of the many cafes and enjoy a beer and a great meal. Then you get the free show as you watch the world stoll by.
,,fun to visit,4.0,,"China Town is vibrant and has some of the feel of Old Singapore about is. Make sure you take a rickshaw ride down to the river and a bum boat ride that is a highlight.
Lots of good things to taste and see here, although touristy"
,,Take a walking tour.,4.0,,"We took a walking tour of Chinatown with The Original Singapore Walks, and it was very good. This company pride themselves on showing you the unusual, taking the road less travelled. Our tour guide, Joo Ling, was very knowledgeable and great fun. She talked about the history of the area, and explained how the Chinese originally came to Singapore and the terrible conditions they had to suffer. She took us into a traditional Chinese medicine shop, where we got some samples and the philosophy of traditional medicine was explained. Joo Ling also explained the religious influences and customs. Due to time constraints, we walked through Little India on our own a couple of days later, and really felt we would have got so much more out of it if we had taken a tour."
,,Nice & exotic shopping experience,4.0,,"Definetly a place to go, if you search for an oriental shopping experience. However I rather prefer Little India where erveything was even more colourful and authetic. If you're looking for a good alterntives to the more ""standard"" shopping malls, this is highly recommended.

Don't miss the temples!"
,,Great place for souviners,4.0,,Picked up really nice magnets and liked the street shopping
,,The best chinatown I've ever been',5.0,,"Clean, safe, alot of tourist places you can visit, which will make your Singapore trip more better since tourist sites are quite near with each other so it means that youll save alot of time."
,,A good place to go for food and pressies to take home.,5.0,,"Chinatown is very busy and there is a lot to see. Be prepared to be approached by tailors wanting to make you a suit - I have had 3 made there and all very good quality at a reasonable price. Be prepared to haggle if you go for a camera or you could find yourself paying over the top. Best get that sort of thing at The Funan Centre (near Raffles). The food is good and cheap. Have a god look round there is plenty to buy such as cushion covers, ornaments, clothes and jewelery."
,,Great Chilli Crab,4.0,,"you must try it, its fantastic Try the foodstalls."
,,one of the best chinatown we have visited,5.0,,"cleaner and better maintained than many others, but we also liked the surrounding area of Chinatown Complex better than the Complex itself."
,,Well preserved culture and building,4.0,,"a lot of food and gifts to buy with low price, even late at night!"
,,Great for cheap sounvenirs and sightseeing,4.0,,"This is a must see for cheap Singapore souvenirs and knock-offs. The scenery is awesome and we didn't get hassled by any traders, overall its very laid back. Catch the MRT right there. Visit the buddist temple on a Sunday -awesome!"

,,Great night out,5.0,,We ate on pagoda Street with a large group. The service was superb.
,,A must visit ..,5.0,,"This is an excellent shopping area, offering so many bargains that on one visit, I had to ship excess baggage home by DHL ahead of our flight! There are also many food halls, offering wonderfully tasty and fragrant Chinese dishes, all very cheap and filling. There are shops selling jewellery, silk clothing, cosmetic, food, gadgets - well pretty much anything really. Bottom line - I couldn't imagine visiting Singapore and not visiting China Town."
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,Loved some of the older buildings and alley ways and there are hundreds of shops here if you are looking for little knick knacks/make up bags/hair clips etc
,,Its worth a look,3.0,,Been here twice now the best time to come is Chinese new year. Dont forget to haggle the price to get a better deal . Good camera shops here.
,,Great atmosphere,3.0,,good but comercial as most things are in Singapore
,,for market lovers!,5.0,,"chinatown is all that you expected. tons of authentic chinese cuisine being served from food vendors, also a lot of little souvenirs and goodies with really cheap prices. definitely a must to visit while in Singapore."
,,"For food awesome, not great shopping",5.0,,"From an 8 dollar set to upmarket air con establishments just love the food here. Transport around on the subway is easy and excellent even though the taxis are cheap. Really think the shopping here for the cheap items is poor though.
All about the food and location for me but will always stay in this part of town. Orchard area is better for shopping and boozing."
,,Relaxing stroll through street market,4.0,,"Not as hectic as other night markets, nice stall holders, not hassley, good restaurants, shame about the embarrassing British tourists too full of Tiger beer. Right outside the MRT station, so very handy for an evening visit."
,,Variety of sorvenir,3.0,,"If you looking for variety of sorvenir, i suggest to go here. At my first visit to Spore, i didnt manage to go here and this time i simply go to downstreet of Lucky Chinatown. Here, finally i found lot of shops selling any kind of sorvenir from keychain, fidge magnet, tshirt, to bag... whatever you need, u can simply get here. Try to survey the prices from different shops. There are lot of shops to survey. Otherwise, you will regret when found the shop that offer cheaper prices. Some shops sell fidge magnet for SGD2 for each but some 10dollar for 7pieces. And keychain also cheaper here, only 10 dollar for 24pieces. And so many other choices that definitely make you wanna but everything and broke"
,,Eat at the Hawkers,4.0,,"Two of us ate here for about 5 GBP, a real bargain and great food. The streets are full of interesting shops and stalls and the welcome we received was fantastic."
,,A view in an other world,4.0,,"To eat authentic chinese food this is the only place to go. In the chinese market you will find all kind of electronic items and many really nice souvenirs. More authentic is Little India, our favourite place!"
,,Bargains galore,5.0,,"If you like bargains, you'll like China town. There is so much to buy at incredible prices. We followed the Chinatown Walk, which takes you to some of the quieter, historical areas where you can visit the temples and learn about the early settlers."
,,More of Asia Town...,3.0,,"Chinatown has a typical South Indian Temple, A Typical North Indian Mosque, an European Chapel, An Asian Buddhist centre, cosmopolitan crowd and yet is called Chinatown!!! Yes some buildings are built in the Chinese architecture but the overall feel is of a melting pot town!!! Very close to the business district so you may be able to pass through this..."
,,just like any other china town really...,2.0,,wasnt overwhelmed. intresting to look round for an hour or two. i woudnt trust any of the restaurants there unless you have a recommendation. i'd choose a restaurant in orchard road which has decent hygiene standards.
,,"Tourists...but when you leave the main street, you find lots of locals",4.0,,"Chinatown is easy to reach via the North East Metro line: exit....Chinatown.
When you walk up Pagoda Street there are many shops that clearly cater to tourists, but when you turn into the side streets towards Temple and Smith Street you find a covered market with dozens of stalls selling oriental clothing and household equipment. The place is easy to find because the Durian fruit that is sold there smells all penetrating. Chinese (and other Orientals) love this fruit that is named the Queen of all fruits. Westerners have often a problem getting used to it. In Singapore it is forbidden to bring Durian into the metro and other public places...if I remember right, the fine is $ 500. The number and kinds of infractions one can commit in Singapore seem endless and some of them can be quite unexpected. From what I understand it is better to be informed, because ignorance is of no protection.
Anyway, coming back to Chinatown, there are several very nice bakeries on Sago street, I tasted several buns and pies and they are yummy.
I stopped for lunch at Tak Po, on 42 Smith Street and ate delicious Dim Sum and pork ribs on rice. And I had an excellent foot and shoulder massage for a very affordable price. There are several walk-in shopees...I tried Four Season Foot Reflexology Centre on 17A, Trengganu Street and it felt wonderful after a day on may feet."
,,Fun,5.0,,Go to a hawker centre for amazing and cheap food. Great atmosphere.
,,A great place to bargain and buy!,4.0,,"Shopkeepers will greet you with a hearty ""Hello, where are you from?"" and try to take you into their shops for the sales pitch. No problem, you don't have to go in if you don't want just politely excuse yourself. All kinds of silks and cottons and a huge variety of clothing is available, from the very cheap to custom-made outfits. Most shops will bargain. There are plenty of eating places in the area. Don't miss the beautiful mosque just on the edge of Chinatown...and believe it or not, your shoes left outside will still be there when you return."
,,good at afternoon,4.0,,visit China town in the afternoon to evening is better than morning.
,,Try a Trishaw Ride for Something Different,4.0,,"100's of Stalls offering all types of souvenirs, clothing and shoes. Went on a Singapore night tour of Chinatown which included a Chinese meal, trishaw ride to Clarke Quay and a Bumboat Ride. Went back to China town the next day to do more shopping."
,,Cheap and great food,4.0,,"I loved the souvenir shops and local food stall here. Bought a lot of fancy watches, souvenir magnets, keychains. All worth the price for SIngapore pricing :)"

,,great food,4.0,,this is the most clean china town ever in the world :) the food is very nice with fusion between local and chinese cuisine. the ambiance is very good.
,,Very busy,4.0,,Worht a walk though even at night. Very typical china town it some good food and bargains of course.
,,So much to see !,5.0,,"Take a good map and just go for it. Wander the streets, look at the architecture of the older sections, stop in the markets, go into the temples watch the people. I felt quite safe and the residents were all so helpful in helping me find my way. Crowded but clean. So many different smells ! Make sure you at least get a smell of durian fruit, even if you don't have the nerve to taste it"
,,A different view of life.,5.0,,"Singapore Chinatown is superbly presented and a wonderful tourist highlight particularly following the traditional calf path that takes visitors down through old streets srrounded by shopping, eateries, and places of worship. Best to see however are the not so familiar back streets where traditional chinese housing and living is to be seen."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,We went in the day and it is wonderful but may be much better at night
,,Cheap souvenirs and cheaper food,4.0,,"If souvenirs and tourist kitsch is what you're looking for, this is the place to be. Each place pretty much sells the same things. The entire area remains lively throughout the day.

The fantastic shop house facades look particularly sublime in the evening, light up by the lanterns."
,,great evening out,4.0,,good food cheap beer lot of tacky sovenier stalls but good fun
,,Great bargains,4.0,,"Very busy, but great atmosphere with cheap yummy meals & shopping."
,,We got lost,4.0,,A really great experience even if we did get lost at 65 & 70 it was fun..just loved wondering around at our own pace. We would certainly go back again...You need to like being in crowds
,,interesting chinatown,4.0,,chinatown is a very interesting area of Singapore and lovely to walk around looking at the different stalls and the different foods available would like to visit it at night next time
,,A Must Go!,4.0,,"Before you purchase some souveniers (a thrift traveller like me)you need to walk along the streets and stalls and check the prices.
Items (same item, different seller) would have different prices so better check.
You would be engrossed to the little/amazing/funny stuff they sell that you cannot mind the time spent!"
,,makets in China town,3.0,,it is worth to go there and have a look. I love to walk between stands with all kind of goods... don't do it at noon... easily accessed by MRT
,,Worth a Visit,5.0,,Worth a visit - particularly the Hindu Temple. Perhaps a little touristy
,,Fun Shopping in Singapore,5.0,,Singapore is pricy. Chinatown has better prices (cheaper products) and lots of nifty junk (but isn't everything). You can also haggle on prices in Chinatown.
,,pasalubong,5.0,,"if u wanna buy pasalubong of gifts to you loveones from singapore, this is the place to be! this is where you can test your haggling skills. if you wanna buy jewelries, check also this place."
,,Cheap food and nice ambience,4.0,,"As lovers of Chinese Food we felt we had to go and visit Chinatown to eat. We bought our dishes on Food Street and then grabbed a communal table nearby to eat it. A lady comes around with large bottles of Tiger Beer at a reasonable (by Singapore standards) price.
Food was cheap and cheerful and there was plenty of choice especially if you like fish.
A must do for any trip to Singapore."
,,Certainly lively!,4.0,,Had some yummy Chicken rice at Maxwell hawker Centre; it was nice walking through the old Chinses style buildings; the market area itself was a big dissapointing full of overpriced kitsch souveniers. The place had a very vibrant feel about it and was worth the visit.
,,"Bustling, interesting quarter",4.0,,"This Chinatown doesn't disappoint. Lots of foot traffic here, interesting shops and restaurants, centrally located downtown. Easy to navigate. Great deals."
,,Choices,4.0,,"Great choice, plenty to see and do. Many pubs, food choice, friendly smiles - bargins, from shoes to woodworking artestry, to bells and whistles...."
,,Interesting in every respect,5.0,,"When once I discovered Chinatown in Singapore I kept going back. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is there as is the oldest Hindu Temple in Singapore, the Sri Mariamman Temple. Both are worthy of a good visit. The shops are all different with some very interesting products. We bought a couple of hand carved wooden bowls painted with delicate cherry blossoms for a very good price. One can have a silk suit or traditional Chinese Cheongsam made to order very cheaply yet very good quality. Be sure to have a couple of days to have your garment made so you can pick it up and check for a good fit! At night in Chinatown all the streets close down and out come the tables and chairs and it appears to become one huge restaurant. As you wonder about the smell of all the foods and the lights of the stalls make Chinatown at night a must do when in Singapore."
,,Always something new to see,5.0,,"I visit on every trip to Singapore. Chinatown never disappoints me, there is always something I've not seen before. Almost like stepping back in time when on a walking tour of the old streets."
,,A slice of life,4.0,,"Chinatowns around the world have similarities, but are never ""the same."" Worth a stroll between Hop On Hop Off stops"
,,Not as good as other China towns,3.0,,"We were a little dissappointed, not as good as China town in San Francisco, Melbourne or Sydney mainly hawkers, & could not find any restaurant doing Yum Char"
,,Great food!,5.0,,"Great food, excellent sights and lots of fun haggling in the markets!"
,,Some Great Food and Good Shopping,5.0,,"Some wonderful places to eat and many of them are tax free so they are cheaper, great bargains in the street market, and The People's Shopping Centre has some great shops and cheaper than Orchard Road!"
,,"Great architecture, great food",4.0,,"I have to admit I liked the architecture more than almost anything else. There are loads of restaurants, and I did have a really good meal here. However, the shops and stalls sell quite a lot of fairly generic Asian products and tourist tat. Still amusing to wander round for an hour or two, but I went home empty handed. Very full-tummied though!"
,,An area of Singapore with its own identity...,3.0,,"It is easy enough to get here via the MRT on the North-East MRT line.
We came out of Exit A (Pagoda Street) and were pretty much into the thick of things.
If you have the time for some culture there are a few Temples, Museums and the Heritage Centre to explore.

Having been here a few times in the past, Chinatown has certainly been upgraded for us tourists! Long gone is the era of dilapidated and rickety ’shophouses’, which somehow added to the charm!. Most are well restored with some lovely colours and now add a new, modern feel. On the other side of things, we saw a few skyscraper-housing complexes that detract from the old style atmosphere.

Shopping and eating are two good options if coming here just for that.
Several stores, a mall, Yue Hwa for quality (but more expensive) Chinese products and lots of touristy style places to buy trinkets etc.

Food here can be cheap and 'Chinese' and the Chinatown Complex plus Smith St (smaller and more upmarket) have hundreds of 'hawkers' stalls. However, it’s not everyone's cup of tea so head to Clarke Quay or Tanjong Pagar (Korean) for variety.
There are also a few good wine bars for those who prefer a liquid break!

It is worth experiencing this area for a few hours and it particularly comes to life in the evenings.We saw a sense of 'community' happening here during the day with people doing their exercises, playing board games or going about their workday.

Enjoy your visit!"
,,Buzzling Chinatown,4.0,,"We visited Chinatown because of its rich heritage.Rows of shops and stores selling everything CHINESE; silk clothing, scarf, ties, artifacts, paintings, toys, food and beverage,etc

Most importantly, tourists can fnd Singapore sourvenir here to take home. Singapore merlion T- shirt 3 for $10,Singapore logo keychains 36 for $10, chopsticks 5 for $10, oriental pillow covers 3 for $10, etc. These are good stuff to bring home. There are also XXL or XXXL sizes for our bigger friends. However, do try on the outfit as they may not fit.

Do check quality for tear or stain, etc.

Things are relatively cheap. Do stop to try some chinese snacks. There is a chinatown Heritage culture center within Chinatown that you may visit FOC. There is also, well smack within Chinatown, a hawker food center. However, prices are steeper and quality not as good as some of the stores nearby. Within Chinatown, there are two important religious places of worship; the Indian temple and a Chinese buddhist temple, just within a stone throw away from one another. For the Indian temple, you need to visit ""barefoot"" . However, if you are wearing expensive shoes, please be careful. Better to have someone watch over cos they want you to leave your footwear outside the temple.

You may also want to visit the shopping malls opposite from Chinatown; People's Park, OG, Pearl's center,etc. These malls are with airconditioner so may be more comfortable for browsing purpose.

Look around before you buy as one shop may be cheaper than another. So walk around first and then you can walk back to buy your sourvenir.

Dress light as weather may be hot and on certain days, Chinatown may be very crowded.

The good thing is, it is clean except for the toilets.;0

There is a western guy, German that sells ""hotdogs"" in Chinatown. He is part of the attraction. Many visited his stall which is at one corner, opposite from Fatty Weng Chinese restaurant.. Imagine a western store with a western owner in buzzling Chinatown. How cool can that be?;)"
,,Great Lunch!,4.0,,Freshly cooked chilli crab which you picked yourself. Lots of yummy food on offer.
,,Awesome!,5.0,,There's heaps to see during all parts of the day and the place really comes alive in the late afternoon / night. Plenty to eat with heaps of stalls selling cheap tasty food. Lots of tailors around so go around and bargain and you can get clothes made to your measurements. I went to Silk of the Orient and had a suit made which is excellent.
,,Some great buys,4.0,,There aresome intersting Antique and Brick aBrac stores that are worth spending some time in if you are into that kind of thing. Bargin hard there isroom to play.
,,A taste of China,4.0,,"Great food from the stalls in the evening, great atmosphere during the day. Just be prepared to say no a lot to the tailors and guys at the camera stores"
,,Good place to shop,3.0,,"This is a decent place to get some basic Asian souvenirs. But, if you live in other parts of Asia, you have probably seen all of these before."
,,Chinatown,5.0,,Kitschy and worth a visit - the architecture is great - wander the less populated streets for a nice architectural tour and the temple there is amazing!
,,Snug space,4.0,,"Busy. This place is really busy. The sidewalks are crammed, as are the shops... but the place is fascinating. There is a bit of everything on offer. Do visit the market hall, where on the ground floor one can find all kinds of fish, meat, poultry (including a live poultry stall-- I haven't been there to see if they dispatch the animals for their customers) and fruit and veg-- but the smell is... well, it smells of the goods on offer! Definitely worth a visit!"
,,Great Place in Singapore - Chinatown,4.0,,"Taking the MRT or a Cab is the easiest way into chinatown. After getting up the escalators you already get this feeling like beeing in china. sure, most of the stalls there sell the typical tourist things like chopsticks or tshirts, but there are such nice small restaurants and stalls within chinatown. the further you walk, the different it gets. Behind the Main Street you find Shops where you can buy typical chinese tea or even medicine.
And of course, in middle of all that is a german selling real german sausages :-)

Try one of the SPA`s there (Dont worry you wont miss it, as many people waiting and stadning with flyers to attract tourists). I payed for half hour back and half hour foot massage around 38 SGD. Good i did that at nighttime cause i felt so tired after that !

Chinatown is a great Place to see, they also have some temples there to visit and def check them out. The Area is not that huge, so you wont get lost. Signs guide you the way back to the mrt or nearest Taxi Stand."
,,Souvenirs and food galore in every direction,5.0,,After much persuasion my husband finally agreed to take the MRT into Chinatown to see what this beautiful part of Singapore has to offer. The last time I had visited Singapore 20+ years I had the best time in Chinatown. From the moment the escalator took us to the street level my husband's first words that came out of his mouth were 'Wow'...The streets are all lined with beautiful red lanterns and souvenir stalls to die for. They even have the old fashioned hats with the fake braid attached to them which both my boys begged me to purchase as a fabulous keepsake. We were surrounded by the culinary smell of all the food stalls and were truly amazed that this part of SIngapore has been preserved throughout its time. Do take the time to visit you will not be disappointed.
,,Souvenir shopping and local food galore…,4.0,,"I recommend this as place to go for souvenir shopping...

Walked along Temple Street and Pagada street and managed to grab a bagful of souvenirs for my friends and colleagues.

Another great place to check out is the Chinatown Market on the 2nd floor which I chanced upon. It is a food centre with plenty of yummy local food. This is a place where the locals eat. Would recommend this for those who want to try out local food at local prices."
,,"A ""must-do"" when in Singapore.",5.0,,"Words cannot describe this place. Food, bargains, lights and more bargains.
If you are going to Singapore .. don't miss the experience. Best time is about an hour after nightfall.
If the little old Chinese busker is playing his two string instrument on the corner in the middle of the markets, take the time to listen to him and give him a dollar or two! Have a chat with him. He is a real character."
,,Great place with lots to do,4.0,,"We went to Chinatown 3 times in a week. First time during the day to look around and buy some souviners (yes they have lots of cheap stuff as well as some quality items), and walk thru the temples. Second time at night to walk amongst all the market stalls - they seem different at night - and to eat. The third time just to eat again, cause the food is good, not overpriced, and the beer is cheapest in Singapore ($5 for a 630ml 'stubbie'). Do eat at the Chinatown Heritage Centre. They dont overcharge you or give you 'extras' that you don't ask for."
,,Get ready to be ripped in Chinatown,2.0,,The place is nothing great and it is just a street with some Chinese lanterns burning and some shops on display. Really did not do much to impress. The place is kinda full with tourist traps. Beware that when you eat in the Chinese restaurants they will keep peanuts and wet towels on your table without you asking or ordering for it. You would probably think that it comes complimentary but be ready to see those charges on your bill.They will not listen to anything (even when you say that nobody informed you that it is chargeable or you never ordered for it) and would also suddenly pretend that they don't understand English.There is a good place called Maxwell food center. Head there and you will find a number of food stalls offering various varieties of Chinese food and nice too. But be there before 8PM to experience it all.
,,I got ripped off in Little India - Go to Chinatown first!!!,5.0,,"I was soooooo peeved when I walked in to Chinatown and the first thing I saw was the bag I'd bought in Little India only 48 hours before - for HALF the price I paid. SO SO mad!! GRRR!

I loved Chinatown though, I got a whole bunch of souvenirs, tried some good food and saw the beautiful temple at the end of the street.

A few tips - like another reviewer said, go hungry!

There's a little shop beside the MRT station that was selling water for only 70c instead of the S$2+ other places sell it for (and yes, I checked the seal wasn't broken!)

HAGGLE!!! We wanted to buy a bathrobe and got over $5 off by haggling. Don't pay asking price! We went to Malaysia earlier this year and prices are comparable to the Chinatown there!

We had a great few hours here, the sun set while we were eating dinner and all of the paper lanterns turn on - it's gorgeous, bustling and very reasonably priced!"
,,Go when hungry,3.0,,"We visited Chinatown during Chinese New Year, so it was absolutely crowded. We didn't particularly enjoy our visit (especially when compared to other areas such as Little India and Kampong Glam). I think it would have been better if we needed to seek out a meal while we were there, or if we knew to look for things like the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple or the Sri Mariamman Temple. My advice is to go when you are hungry or do your research so you have an idea where the temples are. The MRT takes you straight there."
,,The best Chinatown,5.0,,"This is Singapore, so everything is easy - you come up the escalator in Chinatown MRT station (take the Pagoda Street exit) and you are right in the heart of Chinatown. Mornings are quieter if that's what you like, but the hustle and bustle of afternoons and evenings really gives you a taste of the place. The market is great (good for exotic inexpensive presents) but don't confine yourself to that alone. There are temples and restaurants and foot masseurs and lots of less touristy shops and stalls, such as Chinese herbalists and antiques, once you get out of the main area (which is only a few streets). It's always hot and sticky, but there are also plenty of places to have a pot of Chinese tea or a beer - and a huge selection of Chinese food. Don't miss the amazing Indian temple at the top of Pagoda Street - take your shoes off and go in, you are welcomed - the cultural mix in Singapore is wonderful!"
,,Chinese culture in the flesh,4.0,,"We visited Chinatown for a few after a trip to Sentosa's Universal studios. We arrived into Chinatown around 4pm and it was pouring down with rain , but it didnt hinder us as the shop houses were all fairly sheltered. If you are looking for anything to do with Chinese culture from chinese food to books to Chinese medicine to massages , this is the place. Plenty of shops that sell items you can display on your mantlepiece. Jade, porcelain, gold, Chinese cheongsams for ladies. The world is your oyster. Worth a whole days visit to soak and appreciate what Chinatown has to offer. Dont forget to buy the local sweet meat . Absolutely delicious."
,,an afternoon well spent,4.0,,"When in Singapore, you should at least save half a day for Chinatown! Its nothing like the Chinatown in Bangkok, its a ""singaporean chinatown""- meaning tidy, clean, welcoming. You can do some great shopping if you are in the mood- my bf and I ended up buying electronics:) Also, you should definately dine there because there are cute little places you can eat real chinese food, cheap and- most importantly- clean:) liked it far more than the arab street"
,,"If you don't see it, your not getting the Singapore Experience",4.0,,"Singapore has many cultures, Chinese, Malay, and South Asians.... and the Chinese are the ones that make up more than 50% of the pop; therefore visiting Chinatown is a Must.

The best time to visit it is in Chinese New Year but this can get VERY VERY crowded, but at the same time its a great experience. Chinatown is full of delicious food, colors, shopping, and one of the most important places in this great city."
,,Great!,4.0,,"Excellent assortment of places to shop and eat. The Temple of the Budda's Tooth was stunning. Stretching over 5 floors, this amazing building is seriously worth a visit."
,,"A cultural , historical attractions !!",4.0,,"We had 5 days 4 nights trip in Singapore and then Thailand, Cambodia an Vietnam. Of which, Chinatown is our highlight . Actually, this district does retain a cultural and historical significances. It includes a wide variety of souvenir shops, restaurants and especially a lot of heritages sites (pagodas, hindu temples......) . The souvenier here is very cheap so you should buy some for friends. We went to Chinatown Complex in the Smith Street for lunch and it is very delicious with a reasonable price (we've got a tian tian hainese chicken rice for 2$ and fruit juice for 1$) . On top of that, Buddha Tooth Relic Temple , Sri Mariamman Temple ( free admission) on the South Bridge Road are all well worth visiting !!!"
,,Great Visit!,5.0,,"Chinatown is amazing!!! you must go and walk around !!! cheap stores are there so you can buy souvenirs. cheap and delicious food is also there, you must try the chilly crab, it is amazing! when you are there you can see the hindou temple and the chinese temple. It is worth a visit, you will definitely enjoy your time."
,,Great experience,4.0,,It's good to have a variety of experiences when you travel I believe. Singapore isn't that large though places like Chinatown give you another experience very different to other parts of Singapore. Strong Chinese culture. Traditional people & values.
,,BIGGEST hawker centre in Singapore,5.0,,"I am a Singaporean, staying in Singapore.
I would recommend the largest hawker centre of Singapore, which is located in Chinatown.

The hawker centre is located in New Bridge Centre, in between Smith Street Keong Saik Street. Nearest MRT station is Chinatown MRT.

This hawker centre have quite a number of the 1st generation hawkers. Their prices are low and affordable.
You're spoilt for choice of food in that hawker centre. :)

If you're in Chinatown area, don't forget the hawker centre. ;)"
,,At least a quick stroll is essential,4.0,,"Just like Little India, a complete and totally different Singapore is over here. There are a lot of markets and stores with so many different items, the aroma and the surroundings are so different from the rest of the city. If you have the opportunity to eat over there don’t waste that experience."
,,No Big Trouble in this Little China,5.0,,"I stayed in a hostel on one of the main streets in Chinatown, so was in a really good position to explore at leisure. Even if I hadn't stayed there, Chinatown would be a must for visiting. Even if you're not in the mood for shopping, there's plenty to see, do and eat.

TOP TIP - shop around! Very often you will see similar items with big price differences. Generally, shops are a bit more expensive than stalls."
,,Great way to spend a few hours,4.0,,"Great galleries, old buildings with lots of history, markets, excellent food amd found some beautiful old wares which unfortunately we couldn't bring back. We really enjoyed our time here and wished we had a little longer"
,,Reserve your Half of a day at CHINATOWN!,5.0,,"I've been here on February 26th from morning till lunchtime.. a good place where u can easily get varieties of Singapore souvenirs from the printed t-shirts, fridge magnet, keychains, food (thailand and chinese restaurant), all sorts of souvenirs. U will never regret of spending half of ur day at Chinatown as u can get everything here with a cheap price and do not forget to BARGAIN!"
,,Was going to skip this and glad I didn't,4.0,,"I usually don't like to go to Chinatowns/Little Indias/etc. when I travel - I feel like it's interesting enough to learn about the local culture, the immigrants are just another layer better saved for a second trip. Also every major US city has a Chinatown so I couldn't imagine this would be much different. I ended up going just because it was close to a restaurant where I was having lunch, and I was very glad I did. The major temples (Buddha tooth and the Indian one I can't remember how to spell) were some of the top examples of temples of that kind that I've seen even in China and India, the Heritage Center had an interesting exhibition on the history of the Chinese immigrants, and the overall architecture of the area was gorgeous and quite different from most of the rest of Singapore. I had a great time walking around among the shops and restaurants, and I'm glad I didn't skip this. For those who are still skeptical, as a benchmark I thought Arab Town and Little India weren't worth the MRT rides (very similar to others I've seen in other cities), but I thought Chinatown was really unique and worth going to see."
,,Interesting lively place,4.0,,"My hotel was located in Chinatown and it comes alive early in the morning. There are lots of shops and many street vendors. Its a great place for economical shopping, especially for gifts and souvenirs.

Lively, interesting place to spend a few hours and do a bit of shopping."
,,enjoyed the temples & ignored the market stalls,3.0,,"When you emerge from the MRT station you are immediately surrounded by the market stalls but once away from this main shopping street we enjoyed visiting some of the temples in the area, particularly the hindu one, and wandering the less crowded areas"
,,Very cheap - great for souvineers and delicous food,4.0,,"Chinatown is a brilliant place to get souvineers and little knick knacks. You can buy keychains, magnets etc (about 4-5 pces for $10 or less) It is a great place to poke around for shopping or just looking.

The food stalls are brilliant and again, so cheap. You can get a plate of rice with one meat choice & 2 veg choice for about $3-$4. Or if you are vegetarian, you can ask for 3 veg choices - all for the grand sum of $2.80! The food was not freshy cooked on the spot and was only warmish but what do you expect for $2.80?

Would highly recommend a walk around this area. Not sure if it's the best Chinatown that I have visited but it's nice and clean."
,,Clean and good...,4.0,,"Compare to Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) Chinatown, Singapore Chinatown is really clean and good. Don’t miss the tourist spot which is close to Chinatown is Sri Mariamman Temple. Tourist should negotiate all the time in all shops..."
,,Still an Icon of Singapore,5.0,,"Although I've heard some saying that Singapore Chinatown has lost some of its charm, I personally find that it is still Iconic of Singapore. The architecture and looks of the buildings are preserved from the pre war days and some of the oldest in Singapore.
I like the atmosphere which is certainly somewhat different from the high tech malls found all over the other places.
Still a place to visit when going to Singapore. Recomended"
,,Graze your way through Chinatown,5.0,,"We spent our time mainly eating our way through Singapore, and Chinatown was a fantastic place to poke around, do some shopping (not buying), and graze as we came across fun things to try: durian pancakes, duck necks, cuttlefish, egg tarts, cut fruits (ones we weren't familiar with), fresh pressed sugarcane juice! And all the fun foods at the hawker centers. All this is right there when you exit the Chinatown MRT station.

While in the area, take note of the ornately painted and decorated buildings (just look up). The wet market is worth a visit - some good photo opportunities, but I got the feeling the vendors were a little tired of people taking pictures and not buying.

As mentioned by a previous post, except for trinkets, I wouldn't buy anything of significant value here."
,,Ripped Off Camera Accessorie shop in Chinatown Street Markets Singapore,1.0,,"Visited Chinatown Street Markets on our first day in Singapore and my partner wanted to buy a power adaptor to charge our camera battery and shaver. Coming in from South bridge rd end I saw a the first camera accesories shop on the right. The man serving us asked when we arrived where we were from etc and took the adaptor from a drawer behind the counter. He said they were $55 and would give it to us for $50 My partner said we should look around then the man said they are the same price everywhere and he wouldnt rip us off etc etc so I decided we should just buy it there as we needed it and having been to Singapore before found it to be safe and people trustworthy. Walking further down past China Heritage Centre I went into another accessorie shop where they said they are usually $20 and he would give it to us for $15
The location of the shop that ripped us off and did not give us a receipt is - if you walk out the doors of China Heritage Centre and turn left it is on the same side as China Heritage Centre."
,,great day out full of atmosphere,4.0,,Great day out and loads of bargains to be had.. really enjoyed it. Dont eat there though we went to a nearby shopping centre and ate at 1/4 of the price.
,,Good Shopping,4.0,,We found Chinatown the best place for shopping for our 5 and 7 year girls. Beautiful silk chinese dresses for S$10 each. Hand painted umbrellas S$5 each and other great presents for the girls. We didn't bother haggling over the price as things were so cheap already and the people were so friendly. Only down side was the tailors and electronics sales people trying to hassle you in to there stores.
,,Chinatown - a lot to see,4.0,,"Late afternoon is the best time to visit Chinatown as it is not as hot. There is so much to see - people, food, market stalls, antiques and buildings painted in so many different colours. There are a lot of 3 for $10 shops - great presents for the people back home. Buy some cd's or dvd's, have some great food, it is a great experience."
,,I love China Town,3.0,,"China town's a cool place to walk along if you are free... the structure of the buildings are incredibly astonishing... Not to mention the food centre is really good and serves varieties of food... You guys must give the claypot a try.. cant exactly rem which one, there are ard 3 or so there, but all are really good.... Also, not to mention, there are stalls that sells realli cheap CDs jumping off from $6... Originals...."
,,Walk around a bit,3.0,,"Nice area to walk around a bit. Buildings are brightly painted. I was there on Sunday - most things are closed. Happened to walk through the Night market area, didn't find it special; lots of vendors of cheap stuff."
,,shophouse architecture,5.0,,"The colorfully painted shophouses and covered sidewalks (called 5-foot ways) are lovely, and you can catch glimpses of the men's social groups and kitchens behind the scenes. Also, don't miss going into a chinese herbalist shop or two - they're astounding. I was there the weekend after Chinese New Year's, and it was reaallly quiet. If you are in Singapore mid-Jan, though, leading up to New Year's, it's incredibly lively and mad with people. Gong Xi Fa Cai (Happy New Year!)"
