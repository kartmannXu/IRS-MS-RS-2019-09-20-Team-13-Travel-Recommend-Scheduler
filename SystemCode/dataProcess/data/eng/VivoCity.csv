,,"customer service ist the worst ever, unfriendly and incompetent",1.0,,"Wanted to collect a Tourist Privilege Card - you only get one, if you will present your passport AND the the white card for leaving singapore. They even are incompetent to recognize that i was in singapore for several times the last year, just if they look in my passport. Just buy at other places - it‚Äòs less expensive and the people are much more friendly."
,,World class shopping complex,4.0,,Amazing Shopping complex in Singapore and can by all the top brand and it look as stylish building and world class facility
,,Shopping Near Sentosa,4.0,,"This is the closest shopping centre to Sentosa Island.
There are so many shops here, I preferred it to Orchard Road as more suitable shops to what I needed & a large variety of food options, both Asian & Western options.
All the locals are found at lunchtime down in the basement level.
On the main level there is also a supermarket where we bounght basics before returning to Sentosa Island."
,,Wonderful !,5.0,,"Best place to shopping in Singapore. If you will come to Singapore, you can come this place and get great shopping experience."
,,Great shopping destination,4.0,,"Such a large mall with a good variety of shops. A lot of the popular clothing stores had decent discounts when we visited which was lucky. All depends what you are looking for I guess.

Great food court is Basement 2 and lots of accessible toilets and parents facilities."
,,Support Hair for Hope,3.0,,Went with family to support Hair for Hope event at VivoCity atrium. 14 company staff brave to get the hair shorn to raise funds and support children with cancer.
,,Gigantic shopping mall - can spend a whole day easily,5.0,,"I was very surprised to see the size of the shopping mall - it had every shop and restaurant I could name. Luckily, there were seats around the mall so tired customers can take a rest before moving ahead to the rest of the mall. The view outside (facing the harbour) was excellent for photos as well."
,,Sherin Nafie,4.0,,"A nice mall to visit with a variety of shops, cafes & restaurants. It gets quite crowded in the afternoon & on weekends. Not far from Sentosa Island."
,,New malls at basement 2,4.0,,Several new malls at basement 2. Tried Nakhon Kitchen. Still affordable Thai food considering it is in a shopping mall. Had pineapple fried rice for $6. Queue starts to build up after 12pm.
,,Busy at the weekend !!,5.0,,Our advice would be to go to Vivo on a weekday morning. Any other time it can be really busy. Difficult to get in the obvious lifts but the service lifts are great for wheelchairs. Plenty to see in the way of shops!!!!!
,,Vivo review,4.0,,"Great view, and a variety of shops to choose from! Gets really crowded during the weekends tho! Enjoyed my time there"
,,Broitzeit vivo,4.0,,"Nice crew,very observant amidst the bz after hours crowd. I didn‚Äôt take down the ladys‚Äô name who serves alfresco but she made my meeting a pleasant one!meticulous service! Will sure go back for after hours drinks!"
,,love love love,5.0,,i love this mall.. so good .. so many store i love too.. and there is sentosa express to go to universal studios
,,busiest mall in singapore,3.0,,"qmy least favourite mall in singapore because it's always so busy and especially on sunday

occasionally come here for gold class cinema when my favourites don't have the film I want at the time I want and it has a couple of good bars, queen and mangosteen and brotziet

but it's never quiet"
,,Huge Mall,4.0,,This mall has A LOT of things. Can spend a whole day in this place. Has a huge spread of food choices and also for shopping. It is also near Sentosa for tourists to stop by and get some stuff!
,,Amazing mall,4.0,,"I love the food court here the most.
Vivo City is a lovely shopping mall.
You can transfer to Sentosa from here.
But coming back to the food court... I ate twice here.
I was so happy to see some Chinese food here.
I found my favorite hotpots and some south Indian food.
A nice mall."
,,Big mall,4.0,,"This is a huge mall located right at the entrance to sentosa. The monorail station to sentosa island is also located here.

A number of eateries can be found within the mall and the giant supermarket is also found here at the mall.

Very convenient located as the mall can be reached by MRT and many public buses."
,,Amazing Mall,4.0,,Multilayer with every possible name brand shop in Singapore üá∏üá¨... great layout with the train station (MRT) at the basement and the monorail üöù on the top leading to Santosa A must visit for every traveller visiting Singapore‚Äôs highlights
,,Gateway to Sentosa,4.0,,"As an entry point to Sentosa you'd probably see this mall several times. But the mall deserves a visit on its own too with stores and brands catering to all tastes and price ranges. The MRT connects internally like most big malls in Singapore and the lower floors have all chain fast food places.

The Food republic on level 3 was one the largest food courts we saw in Singapore. Indians would be particularly glad to see a branch of Sarvanna Bhawan in the food court, it was good to have those familiar idlis and dosas after 4 days of non stop oriental stuff.

Managed to forget my phone in the food court but it was stowed away safely in the mall management office where it was handed over to us with minimal fuss."
,,Shopping with a view,5.0,,"A not to be missed when in Singapore üá∏üá¨ Overseeing Sentosa Island üå¥ Harbourfront, Universal Studioj, mono-rail, cable car üö† ships üö¢ A variety of transport.. all wifi. Your view.. besides shopping till you drop in addition to a sumptuous food paradise."
,,Gateway to Sentosa Island,4.0,,"Nice to have a place like this to fill-up on some food and supplies before you have to deal with the expensive options on Sentosa Island. Likewise coming back, it's a great place to cool down if you did some major walking like I did. Looks like a great mall with the usual options for normal, everyday people. Couldn't find the XXL size t-shirt though."
,,Where are the seats for senior citizens?,2.0,,"Senior citizens need seats to rest from time to time... But in this centre unless you enter a restaurant there is not much chance of finding a space to sit. If you are lucky enough to track down a place to sit you are going to find it already occupied by someone with a pram.
So as a senior citizen tourist visiting Singapore... Sorry guys... This shipping centre gets a low rating"
,,Cool huge mall!,4.0,,Cool place. Its huge and has tons of shops and eateries. We really enjoyed the food court area. Its a great location. There is a walk way to Sentosa where you can go to the trick museum and watch the crane dance. Check it out.
,,Shopping? You'll find it all here,5.0,,"Huge mall with an array of different shops to satisfy every need you have. Unfortunately, as is everything in Singapore, prices are on the higher side so eg. a t shirt from H&M in the UK would be about 3GBP and here in Singapore the same thing from the same shop would be at least double that."
,,Great Shopping Mall and Food options,5.0,,"Spent about half a day here recently, mainly for some shopping and lunch. Amazing number of shops to look through and then the food and drink options as well."
,,Level 3 Food Republic has a rude staff member,3.0,,"The shopping mall large, modern, visitor-friendly and has an MRT access. However, I encountered someone unpleasant today. A staff seller at a Chinese BBQ Food stall near the entrance of the Level 3 Food Court was rude to me when I was confused by its menu. I had planned to order a BBQ pork set from the menu at the counter but couldn‚Äôt find the price there. Then I asked him. Surprisingly, he blamed me in a bad way that I didn‚Äôt look around since there is another menu pasted on the wall which displays the price. He said ‚ÄúYou are inconsistent.‚Äù He also laughed at me and mocked at me by talking to other customers. I didn‚Äôt buy his food at last."
,,Good Shopping Mall,5.0,,This is a good shopping mall with lots of options on shopping and eatery as well and the main thing is that you can go to sentosa island easily from here
,,Food court is nice,4.0,,"Nice view from the top of the mall. It's all interconnected which makes it easy to walk around. The food court on the top level has a pretty good selection. I got my lunch set from a place that was reviewed by Food King and it was a great deal for the amount of food I got!
Also it's connected to the Sentosa monorail (which was luckily free for MRT pass holders when I visited) so Sentosa is only a short ride away!"
,,"Good for food, otherwise just another mall",3.0,,"Vivo is filled with a great selection of meals and dessert restaurants which I'd recommend it for, you can also access the Sentosa Boardwalk right outside Vivo. If you are coming here for shopping, the store hosts the typical branded shops you can find globally"
,,Everything under one roof,5.0,,"This is the best mall In Singapore in my opinion has everything. Connected to the MRT and the Sentosa Monorail, buses and taxi also easily available. Loads of Restaurants, Fast food, food stalls and a food court. Has almost every brand, my kids loved the open Play Area which is free and a the water play area. There are some lovely water facing restaurants and bars looking towards Sentosa. We we were there they had an amazing Lego Movie Promotion setup where kids could play with Legos and take part in fun activities plus they got to meet the Characters too which was fun"
,,Not a stroller-friendly mall,2.0,,"There are only 2 very small lifts from B1 (near innisfree) and always very packed with able-bodied people. There is no way for a stroller to enter. Waited for more than 10trips and still unable to get in. Management needs to do something about it esp, during peak period.

The variety of shops and restaurants are great but nothing unique or exclusive. It‚Äôs always possible to go to other malls."
,,Just too big,2.0,,We found it too big and nearly unusable. Without a map you could carry around it meant you had to keep stopping at info screens. These were so popular indicates mobile app would be better. Unlikely to return as so. Many other options
,,go at night!,5.0,,we went there at night with the purpose to get a great view from the cruise's lights. so lucky that there was the cruise that time.. We think that is the best thing about Vivo City; the view..
,,Just another large shopping mall,4.0,,"We just went to Vivo to be able to catch the monorail over to Sentosa island. The cost was $4 return, which was a lot better than the $35 for the cable car. I do agree that the views would be superb, but a lot to pay for such a short trip. If you want to spend time shopping, Vivo would be for you; all the main name shops there. Singapore is not cheaper than Australia, so I would prefer to spend my time out of the malls. Kuala Lumpur on the other hand, has excellent shopping."
,,Largest modern mall with full of international brands,5.0,,"Huge modern mall in Harbour front area and largest in Singapore. Mall has all that‚Äôs needed and expected of. Full of international brands. Nice shopping place, eateries, gaming and one can spend good time with family."
,,Great shopping,4.0,,This mall had some great shopping options and food court plus access to Sentosa via cable car and sentosa express train. Also the MRT was useful and made it easy to get to. Great mall.
,,Biggest mall,4.0,,This is probably the biggest mall in Singapore with a variety of stores. For snacks remember to grab the korean sweet potato from the basement from this shop called guma guma. The food republic has a wide variety of local food too.
,,Nice mall,5.0,,Great mall to escape the heat and do shopping. All kinds of shops you need. Located conveniently underground just beside the metro exit. Wonderful Harbor walk overlooking the Sentosa island bay with various European food restaurants.
,,Shopping Mall is one of the better ones in Singapore,4.0,,I found the supermarket and food courts to be very good here. Shopping in Singapore I found expensive but this mall seemed to have a few bargains for us. It is the gateway to Sentosa Island so it was nice to get out of the heat into the air conditioning when we got back
,,Huge,5.0,,Right next to the cruise port terminal so decided to have a look before getting back on to the ship. It‚Äôs huge!! A mix of shops with eateries. Well worth a visit.
,,vivo,4.0,,Nice and big place for you to hang around. It is connected to the MRT and also the gateway to Sentosa. Lots to do in this huge mall
,,Good shopping centre,4.0,,"The VivoCity shopping centre is an international style, multi-story centre easily accessed by the MTR (station under the shopping centre). It‚Äôs also serviced by a number of buses, with an interchange outside one of the entrances.

It has a number of food courts featuring the international brands that you would expect as well as a good number of local operations and options.

Situated on the water, overlooking Sentosa Island and Universal Studios and there are a number of restaurants on the promenade, overlooking the water.

As far as big shopping centres go, this is probably as good as you get."
,,Fantastic mall for shoping,5.0,,"A really fantastic mall to shop in and have a browse. Has a very good Zara, H&M, bath and body works, M&S etc."
,,Covers many of the usual,4.0,,"All your mid range brands under one roof. A well stocked M&S, Zara, sports apparel and shoes on the second floors. Loads of food options. A good mall to while a few hours . I believe also nice places to eat on the
Outside but didn‚Äôt get to try any. Wrong time of the day."
,,As big as they come,4.0,,"What can you say about a huge, modern shopping mall? It is a clone of several other mega malls in Singapore. All the same stores are present. I went there because it is the nexus between the monorail to Sentosa island and the MRT back to the CBD. Beyond that, it is huge, clean, glitzy and fairly soulless."
,,"Nice, Modern Mall",4.0,,"My family visited the mall by taking the Cable Car from Sentosa. It was a great little ride and the mall was nice. We ate down in the basement at the food center, but in hind sight, there were lots of cute restaurants. I wish we had eaten somewhere else in the mall. We were able to catch the subway from the mall to head over to Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands. It's easy to navigate and very clean."
,,Big is Beautiful,4.0,,Very large Mall with excellent shopping- tons of shops - great food - was pretty crowded when we visited.
,,VivoCity is a Shopping City,4.0,,"My visit to Vivo was quick .. I did not have a chance to go all over the place .. it has very good shops .. what u need .. u will find ..

During my stay in Singapore .. if I have a chance I will visit again

Wish u enjoy it"
,,Huge!,5.0,,"Large shopping mall with many shops and restaurants. The rooftop often has lighting decorations during festive seasons. Vivocity is also a gateway to sentosa. Either take the $4 tram at the third floor, or use the sheltered boardwalk (about 700 metres)."
,,Humongous,5.0,,"It‚Äôs a humongous mall located just at the entrance to sentosa. Literally, you can all you need at this mall, from apparels to groceries to high end watches. There‚Äôs a boulevard where you can see the island sentosa right across the sea, scenic."
,,One of the largest food courts I've ever seen,3.0,,"This mall has just about anything and everything you would need, bottom floor has a huge array of food eateries plus grocery store, upstairs mall with plenty of high end stores also. Outside very nice views of Sentosa island."
,,Shop and eat!,4.0,,"Fabulous mall! Busy, vibrant, buzzing... we didn't manage to get round the whole place but what we saw was great... any kind of clothing or food it has! Only downside was hailing a taxi afterwards... took us nearly 40 minutes (but it was a Saturday evening). Definitely worth a look for high street fashion"
,,A great mall indeed!,5.0,,"I'm not lying when I say this is one of the nicest and biggest malls I've ever visited. I mean I'm not much into shopping, but this place i got to recommend. Exciting place to visit for both young and old and everyone in between! Definitely not your typical boring shopping mall. Name it, they've got it. And nice brands to top it all up!! Great place to come to and shop, shop, shop!!!"
,,Shopping and eating,4.0,,There are varieties of shops available from sports brands to luxury brands. The options of food to choose from are also a lot. It is just a 15minutes walk to Sentosa from Vivocity.
,,Gem place to shop Sentosa island,5.0,,"Gem place to shop plenty brands selection all the places we know and love with great choice

It was great to see my favourite high street shop from UK Marks Spencer some delightful food
To enjoy loved the place

Really enjoyed the food choices international types food to enjoy this was outstanding place to enjoy

Look we stayed on Sentosa island at the Sofitel it was marvellous and we had great service and experience from"
,,great variety,5.0,,"love this mall , stayed on Sentosa & the hotel had a free shuttle to Vivo every 30 minutes . Came here to shop & also had dinner every nite in one of the 3 food courts . Never paid more than A$6 each for a meal . Will def come back again"
,,Huge mall,4.0,,"This place is most concentrated with all the large brands. You can find most fashion brands here. However, this place is so big, its easy to lose direction and walk the same area twice. I love the outdoor area on the top most floor, suitable for kids to run around and for friends to sit down and chill talk at night."
,,The best mall in Singapore!,5.0,,"We love this mall for the sheer numbers and variety of shops all around, food court and easy access to Sentosa Island. If you have to visit one mall and have very less time in Singapore, then this should be it. Lots of activities for kids as well"
,,Best on weekdays,4.0,,I'm a big fan of this shopping centre and always shop here when I'm in Singapore. I highly recommend shopping on a weekday as it's super busy and hectic on weekends as I found out first hand. Always leaving an hour before the shops shut will help you get a taxi in the taxi stand a bit quicker then when the shops are shut and there's a crazy long line.
,,Accessible to mrt,5.0,,"From our hostel its easy to go to this mall just to pass by going from and going to universal studios.
Nice mall and nice food in the food republic section...
Good place to chill and get something to eat before and after enjoying the USS"
,,Big crowded boring shopping centre,2.0,,Yes it is big and yes there are hundreds of shops selling all sort of stuff and yes there are all the international chains and yes it is very popular - but in the end this is just another soulless and boring shopping mall that could be anywhere in the world. And the food court has less atmosphere than a hospital canteen with mediocre food to match.
,,Good review,5.0,,Good stock to buy and fresh. All the fruits and vegetables are all well taken care of. Keep it up Giant!
,,Convenient with Varieties,5.0,,"One of the biggest shopping malls in Singapore. Above the Mrt station. Many good Michelin rated restaurants. Always have new up and coming restaurants. Varieties of shops, cinema, food court, clothing stores (Levi, Uniqlo, super dry and many more). You can collect points to enjoy a discounted carpark payment."
,,Shopping & Food Paradise,5.0,,We stopped by this big shopping mall on our way to sentosa... This is a vibrant place with nice crowd and a great food court... There is a variety of food options and we enjoyed our lunch a lot.. Nice place to hang around in deed...
,,Very busy,5.0,,Easy to find your way around.great shops.rail line goes to Sentosa Island and connects to all other rail lines.they have many different food court's. Something for everyone
,,Accessible,5.0,,Stop by at Vivo city from Universal Studio is good place to continue holiday take rest while we can see up scale and low scale product at shopping mall. The area food court is clean and many choice of food and beverage with justified price.
,,Shopping and restaurants,4.0,,One of the biggest and best shopping malls in Singapore. Many global brands ranging from high to medium end and some local brands. A great foodcourt with lots of food choices. Busy and bustling place. You can walk outside on the Promenade/Walkway to Sentosa which is a bit quieter and enjoy a drink in one of the waterfront restaurants.
,,Shopping mall near Sentosa and Harbourfront,4.0,,"This mall is a jump-off point to Sentosa island and Universal Studios. Aside from the usual clothes, shoes, groceries, restaurants and electronics, the wading pool at the 2nd and 3rd levels and the theme decors are a must-see in Vivocity. This time we we were able to see the Mid-Autumn decors of Disney's tsum tsum."
,,Tsum tsum,3.0,,"Mid autumn Disney theme... I think vivocity is really creativity. I am looking forward to the next mid autumn festival in vivocity. Although this tsum tsum is a little smaller than what I expected, still a nice experience. Still quite crowded even after the mid autumn festival."
,,Shop up a storm,5.0,,"A big variety of stores, plenty of facilities, clean and tidy with lots of food options. Handy location with MRT and skytrain to Sentosa Island."
,,Complete,5.0,,This is a huge mall. Connect with harborfront MRT and Monorail from/to sentosa island. You can spend hours here
,,Great variety of shops & services,5.0,,"I was at the VivoCity yesterday meeting a friend and we spent a few hours there helping her to shop for some birthday gifts for her friends.

This is a great place to shop as you will find many shops, with offers of great varieties of different items from luggage, fashion labels, shoes, bags, sports apparel, watches, jewelery to engraving services.

There are many international fashion labels which include Sacoor Brothers, Benjamin Barker, Mango, Zara, Tommy Hilfinger. Various shops sell shoes from Birkenstock, Ecco, and sports shoes from Nike and Adidas.

Many restaurants are found here along the Promenade and you can enjoy Alfresco dining with superb views of the cable cars and Sentosa island. We have Peranakan food, Italian Restaurants, Japanese Restaurants as well as Tapas Restaurants. You are spoilt with the choices.

Families with children can bring them to the roof TOP with playgrounds on the third floor, and wading pools. Currently, there is a Disney Tsim Tsum display with many lanterns at the roof top as well as the largest lantern sculpture of Mickey & Minnie. The dimension of the sculpture is 8.4m x 10.4m x 5.2m.

We are celebrating our Mid Autumn Festivals, and for tourists do try our Moon Cakes, which are on offer at The Central Court. Enjoy the choice of baked mooncakes or snowskin mooncakes. The traditional ones are made with fillings of lotus paste whereas the snowskin mooncakes come with many different Flavours with mango, durian, strawberry, passionfruit, pandan and etc. Do try them as the last day of offer is on the 24th of September.

To enjoy some of our Singapore local specialties, head to Food Republic on the 4th floor. I had this wanton noodles with roasted meat from this stall - Great World"" HK Roast. When you enter the food eatery, it is on the left hand side. Try our Hokkien Noodles, Beef Noodles, Hainanese Chicken Rise, Fried Kway Teow, just to name a few.

The nearest MRT station is the HarbourFront station on the North East purple line, or the orange Circle Line."
,,nice shopping mall for transit to Sentosa Island,5.0,,you can do window shopping here while on your way to Sentosa Island by the Sentosa Express MRT train there is a genuine Samsung mobile phone shop here if you are interested to buy the latest Samsung phones very good place to visit
,,Our nearest shopping spot.,4.0,,"While staying on Sentosa, VivoCity was just at the end of the monorail, so we went here a few times, even if it was only for the MRT. There was a giant supermarket in the bottom with good stuff- no wonder they call it Giant!! It's a good place to get out of the heat, or to shop- of course."
,,So much choice!,5.0,,"This shopping centre was awesome! Very large, so many choices, plenty of eating also. There is something here for everyone!"
,,Popular Stopover for Transit Visitors,3.0,,"Vivocity, located on the southwestern tip of Singapore, is one of the largest shopping malls on the island that sees high footfall daily as a link between the Harbourfront MRT Station at its basement and (a) light rail link to Sentosa Island and (b) sheltered walkway to the Harbourfront Centre next to it which houses the ferry terminal to Indonesia's Riau Islands.

Vivocity has a tried and tested formula with a cineplex, a department stores and two supermarkets as its anchor tenants. The supermarkets (Cold Storage and Giant) are frequented by holidaymakers who stock up on beverages and snacks before heading to the resort island of Sentosa across the narrow straits.

Vivocity seems more successful as a dining destination than as a shopping destination as many of the shops are no different from those at other malls in Singapore. The F&B establishments do brisk business but shopper traffic to the standalone stores can be quite forlorn on weekdays."
,,Cool Disney Tsum Tsum lantern display at Vivo city (level 3),5.0,,"Smart idea to make quality use of Vivo City's open space at level 3. There are probably a couple of thousands lanterns that showcased all the familiar Disney and Pixar characters. From those I grew up with, like Chip & Dale, Bambi and Dumbo to the new characters like Frozen's Elsa and Anna.

It wasn't as hot and humid I thought it would be probably because the exhibit area was divided into smaller zones. Think its great for families with kids, just make sure to watch out for the little ones and don't forget to bring along their water bottles.

Anyway the display is till end of September so there's still plenty of time left."
,,"Shop, eat and just chill",4.0,,"Easily accessible by MRT - circle and NEL. Is located near Sentosa. It's connected by a bridge actually into Sentosa.

The bridge has a sheltered trevalaor that you can hop on and off from to take pics. This makes it all that easy.

Vivocity itself is a one stop option for all including shopping for brand names, eating out and watching a movie."
,,VIVO,5.0,,"a perfect shopping paradise for all, its a huge market place with all top brands available in one roof."
,,The largest mall in SE Asia,4.0,,"The mall is not just large but also a red dot to connect to Sentosa (outdoor activity and fun place for many) and Harbour Front (cruise ship boarding). You will get lost easily as the layout is not the most friendly. For the size, you should find what you need to shop or see there. It's crowd on weekend and will not be a good place to relax.
It will take more than a few hours to cover the whole mall before sitting down to fill your stomach if you wnt to spend a whole day there."
,,Lots of options to shop and eat!,5.0,,Vivo is a maze because there's so much to do. There are plenty of options to shop and eat and it makes life so easy to run errands here. The weekends keep the shops swamped so avoid traversing there during peak hours and days.
,,‚Äú Nice shopping centre ‚Äú,5.0,,I have visited lots of shopping centre in my life amount them Vivo city is one of them . It‚Äôs looking very nice view if anyone in Singapore please visit a while .
,,Great place to enjoy after visiting Sentosa,5.0,,This is a great place with a nice outdoor at the top of the mall. Take a time to enjoy the evening hours maybe after you go back from USS/Sentosa Island.
,,Well connected shopping center,4.0,,"Train and cable car to Sentosa, MRT, bus, old cruise terminal. Very crowded. lots of good food under air-con. Many interesting things to buy."
,,Express Train to Sentosa Island,4.0,,"Visited VivoCity because it has Express Train station which connects Singapore to Sentosa Island. The fare is SGD 4.0 (return), and we can actually pay using EZLink (MRT) card.

The train from Sentosa to VivoCity gets too crowded in the evening since all travellers are returning to the main land.

We also managed to have some dessert in VivoCity Food Republic. It tastes good and refreshing."
,,Vivo City Singapore,4.0,,Nice mall that is connected to Harbourfront MRT. Many shops inside and of course a food court. From this mall you can walk outside to Sentosa Boardwalk if you want to walk to Sentosa island.
,,Shopping,5.0,,It‚Äôs got a lot of different things to look at from phones to chocolate üç´ ect and more + the food is nice I recommend coming As it was a good day
,,Vivo City Singapore,4.0,,I like coming here very much.. It is very convenient..The parking fee is redeemable upon purchase and also it has a MRT just underneath the Mall... Many many good food outlets.. You get the Giant and cold storage supermarket... The shopping are all mid-range.. Easy for foreign tourist too..
,,A nice trip to getaway of Sentosa island,5.0,,"Wonderfull Mall, it‚Äôs is the short cut to go inside Sentosa Water Park, I‚Äôm interesting with Food center or Food court In Harbourfront, delicious, Yummy, with, Resonable Price. All the way transit to Sentosa island. It‚Äôs a redcomend for a restop."

,,Vivio City -Huge Mall facing the sea!,5.0,,"Huge mall where you can dine, shop, watch movie, take a trip to batam, bintan,or take a cable car to sentosa or take a train to sentosa. Just many activities to do here. We come here to eat and shop. Transport to get here is very easy and fast. The circle and north south line, buses, taxis.
We could eat by the sea cos many good restaurants along the side facing sentosa. Very nice view. At the very top, there is children playground, small fountain pool for kids to play. So it is good for family panic as well. The kuds can ride a choo choo train along the seafront area.
There is a cinema if you want to watch a show so other than hotel, everything is within the mall. There are hotels opposite from this mall but I still feel better stay in city and take a train here.
Clean and green. Even the outdoor area is nice with artistic statues."
,,"Big shopping mall, in front of Sentosa Islands.",4.0,,"CYC+CG ( 18.07.19 )
We visited this area after Sentosa trip for dinner. There connected to Sentosa Islands by monorail. The mall was bigger than I think, and had good atmosphere. Many restaurant and shop was operating, and too wide, I think. We walked around this area and had dinner. Good shopping mall.."
,,Nice place to visit and shopping in Singapore,4.0,,"From Vivo City, you can view the port and Sentosa. From here, you can take the train to Sentosa. Inside Vivo City, there are many shops, restaurants and food courts. It's a nice place to visit in Family."
,,Super size mall and transit centre,3.0,,"Vivo City is multiple levels of a mixed bag of shopping from well known labels to interesting collections. Interesting food options - high class dim sums, hawker style food halls and main stream takeaways and cafes. Super clean and you can access a variety of transport including the monorail to Sentosa.
This mall is completely focused on shopping and it is styled to ensure that you continue purchasing. There is very limited seating throughout the entire mall - to rest you need to be purchasing something in a food outlet. For those with physical disabilities that do need to rest often planning will need to be undertaken prior to locate lifts"
,,Connected to MRT station and Sentosa express,4.0,,"This is a high end mall that connected to Harbourfront MRT. If you want to go to Sentosa, you can use Sentosa Express on the third floor. There's a food court near to it. There's a wet playground that kids will like to visit."
,,A nice and big mall,5.0,,Vivo city is a huge mall that you also need to pass if you are taking a train to Sentosa. There are twin food court and both have good food selection. Many shops and it‚Äôs a good place to kill time.
,,Shopping Heaven,4.0,,Very big shopping centre with a variety of shops and restaurants. Worth a visit when in Singapore. Stores for all type of items.
,,Shop Til You Drop,4.0,,"The Vivo City is the largest shopping mall in Singapore with numerous (over 300) cafes, restaurants, stores and a cinema. It's so big that on our first visit we got lost several times before we got hold of the directions. There is something here for people of all ages and you can pretty much spend an entire day here.

One can reach Vivo City with bus and metro. The monorail to Sentosa leaves from Vivo City mall and costs mere 4 SGD.

The people at info were very kind and eager to help. While asking for directions they let us know about the Vivo tourist card that fetched us some discount and freebies from several shops and restaurants."
,,great place for shopping,4.0,,"the mall is so big and you can find a lot of things here! you can said this is one of shopping paradise, you can find a lot of branded things easily also a lot of cafes / restaurants too!"
,,Nice mall,4.0,,"If you're staying at Sentosa Island you can use the train to get here, but don't forget your pass as you need it to get back. The price is good at toys r us comparing to the middle east."
,,Excellent mall for families,5.0,,"This is a mall that features paddle boats, indoor/outdoor playground and even a choo choo train for the young ones. My kids go absolutely nuts over these attractions, especially when driving the electric toy cars. We usually spend 3-4 hours there to have a meal and then cover the activities they like. That would include going to the biggest toys r us store in Singapore. This place always brings smiles to their little faces. And when they smile, so do we!

Vivo city - a great place for families with young children."
,,Nice vibe at this mall,4.0,,"This is a must visit mall if you are in Singapore. Lots of people from everywhere, great places to shop, always very active, and great eateries too!"
,,Good place for family,5.0,,"I always come here at least once a week previously, since it's near my kid's school and it's a good place to exercise, shop for groceries and $2 shop. The $2 shop (Daiso) has since closed (space taken for upcoming library), but Vivo City has improved its shops listing once again by adding a new B1 area (above Kopitiam), adding a new bookshop Popular, and sports shop Adidas, Nike, Ltd ed and Mi Store. Currently, there's Vivomart at Vivo City, that consists of Guardian Pharmacy, Cold Storage supermarket, and Giant Hypermarket. Good to fulfil all my grocery needs. There's also Golden Village Cinema if you want to watch movies. There's an outdoor playground for young children, as well as a rooftop garden. Plenty of clothing shops (Uniqlo, Zara, H&M, etc.), plenty of eateries from Food courts (Kopitiam & Food Republic), restaurants (Sushi Tei, Bornga, Jamie's Italian, So Ph√≥, etc.), and fast food restaurants (McDonalds, Long John Silvers, Burger King, etc.)

You can reach Vivo City by Bus and MRT, it's also connected to Harbourfront Shopping centre where you can take ferry to Batam, Bintan and other islands; or, take the Cable Car to Mt Faber or Sentosa Island.

For tourists going to Sentosa island, you can take Cable Car (from Harbourfront) which is the most expensive, or take the Monorail from Lv 3 at VivoCity ($4/person), or cheapest option is to walk to Sentosa island (about 500metres). Walking is not too bad, there are some travelators (although sometimes under maintenance), but once you're in Sentosa, monorails and buses inside there are free (even taking monorail back to Vivo City is free)."
,,Close Mall to Sentosa,4.0,,Perfect Location for a mall to shop after you finish beaching on the island. Hotels sometimes provide a free pass to use the sentosa express to go the the mall.
,,Everyone should visit,5.0,,"I travelled to Vivo City from the island called Sentosa and it was such an easy commute because you could catch the Sentosa express and was quick and easy, Ghe shops at Vivo city were for everyone all age groups and also it was really convenient that you could catch the MRT‚Äôs from Vivo City and it has such a good Singaporean vibe to the area and shops it self. If anyone loves shopping Singapore is the place to go"
,,lovely city,5.0,,"nice place for shopping, time pass, catching sentosa express, food options to consider from, bargains, place to relax and take great pictures and enjoy cable car ride."
,,Weekend getaway,5.0,,"Biggest shopping mall you can find in Singapore with various fashion labels and food outlets that will spolit for choice. This mall is also a transit to Sentosa which you will catch the monorail at level 3, just beside the foodcourt. This mall is easy to access by public transport such as MRT named as harbourfront station. You can catch a great view at rooftop access overseeing Sentosa island and the sea."
,,Excellent shopping,5.0,,"Love Vivo city shopping , you can catch the train to the centre .
It has all levels of shopping from bargains to name brands.
I'm going on a cruise in December leaving from harbour front can wait to see the Christmas decoration , Singapore does Christmas so well."
,,OK,3.0,,Didn't shop here but ate in the food court. Lots of options. Just your basic food court food. Cheap. Very crowded. Shops seemed typical for a mid priced mall.
,,Vivocity mall review,5.0,,"We went to the Vivocity Mall on June 9, 2018 Saturday. It's a very good mall. Lot of food and shopping options. Ideal for adults and children. Best to visit in the evening. But it's crowded and food joints are full. A little expensive for budget travelers. It is right outside Harbour Front MRT. There is a board walk to Sentosa island from here. A beautiful laser show at the Sentosa island can be seen from here. The laser show starts at 7.45 pm."
,,"Lots of shops, connect Sentosa !",5.0,,"A metro station included connect to Sentosa, where you can buy tickets to Sentosa and Universal Studios. So many brand inside for shopping, must see & do."
,,Lunch review,3.0,,"This restaurant is part of food court and is located on the top floor of Vivo city. South Indian set meal was good but not great. They repeat same menu items for the set meal with same test.not good to have on daily basis.
Quality- Average
Taste- Average
Location- Good
Hygiene- Good
Staffs friendly- Okay
Price- bit higher"
,,Convenient and nice,4.0,,"The first mall i have been when i got to singapore. This place is only minutes away from where we stayed and not to mention that this mall is the gateway to Sentosa where Universal Studios is located. Going here through Bus or MRT, either is a good way. Shops are many, Restaurants and others also. As i remembered, there are three floors in this mall and also a basement where a grocery and a good food court where you can eat. One thing i love here is because the smell is so fragrant."
,,Lots of shops. Near Sentosa,4.0,,Located at the southern part of Singapore near to Sentosa this mall is usually very busy and has the usual shops and cinema that you can expect to find in Singapore. You can take the monorail to Sentosa from here also.
,,Wow,5.0,,A mall of I don't know how many floors. A metro station included. You need a map or be lost. I liked the informative interactive maps everywhere and I liked the fact that halal restaurants are clearly mentioned here.
,,Huge!,5.0,,"This place is just so BIG! It seems to go for miles, shops everywhere... I‚Äôve never seen so many people at a mall on a Sunday night. Another must see and do."
,,shops and more shops,4.0,,"seem shoppings is the only thing to do here ,,,,,,,,,,,,,food too haha enjoy the day shoppings everything discounted food court is nice with lots od drinks and foods"
,,Average at best. No. Not a patch on orchard road,2.0,,Pretty disappointing given the reviews. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend and wouldn‚Äôt return. A couple of interesting different shops but overall a pretty average down market shopping centre.
,,Interchange to Sentosa,4.0,,You can go monorail to Sentosa from this location. Very seamless access. Integrated with MRT. There are many brand inside for shopping
,,It is a semi luxurious mall with Train station at the top.,4.0,,"It is a place where you can buy tickets to Sentosa and Universal Studios. You can buy a 2 day pass which includes Sentosa and Universal Studios. You can also buy the train ticket to Sentosa at a affordable price. Cards are accepted, but I paid by cash. The staff is helpful, but there is a line so you will have to wait a couple of minutes., Also the mall is quite reasonably priced and you can find clothes, sim cards and food to eat in the mall."
,,Lifestyle and Family Mall,4.0,,"This is a large mall located en route to your trip to Sentosa. Go here for a cool off after a hot day out in the sun at Sentosa.

This mall has everything to offer from dining options to boutiques and department store. There is also an electronics store called Best Denki there.

Prices are all fixed but it includes a wide variety of options. For the budget traveller, visit Giant supermarket at basement 2 for all your self cooking and snack needs.

For a taste of local cuisine, consider the food court at basement 2 for the budget conscience. There is also a small eatery just outside it called Encik Tan where you can sample some local halal food.

For a pricier alternative food court there is one at level 3 near the Sentosa train stop called Food Republic. There are also other dining options at level 1 and 2. Fast food options are also available at level 1 and basement 2.

Shopping options are a myriad of choices including brand names like Sephora, Kate Spade, Zara, Uniqlo, Lacoste, Ted Baker, Charles & Keith, Toysrus, Tangs, Muji and more!

This is a mall to visit after your visit to Sentosa. So combine it and end of in the evening with a nice dinner at Vivocity. You can consider the restaurants on level 1 and 2 facing Sentosa island. The restaurants all feature glass windows that showcase the evening and night scene of Sentosa. Watch out for a brief fireworks display on weekends at 8pm or 9pm... cant recall exact time!"
,,Massive Mall with everything in one place,5.0,,Massive Mall with everything you could want under one roof great Brands loads of restaurants. The free playground was a great hit with the kids there is also a water play area on the roof also free. The arcade Timezone is just massive my 7 year old went crazy. The mall is very well connected by buses and the Mrt leads you right inside the mall. As it is situated at the entrance to Sentosa you will either drive by it or go through it if you take the Mrt and walk to Sentosa by the Sentosa boardwalk which we did a couple of times. The restaurants situated on the boardwalk level have a lovely view of Sentosa. You can sit outside and enjoy dinner by the sea overlooking Sentosa.
,,The biggest mall in Singapore,4.0,,"I was in Singapore a week ago on business (stayed here for 3D2N) and on the second day, after my morning appointments (the second of which was in Chinatown), I decided to head to VivoCity which was a short 10 minute drive away - both for lunch and a walkabout, since my last trip to SG's biggest mall was more than 5 years ago!

While there were loads of food outlets in this place (notably Subway, Fish & Co., Marche Movenpick, Secret Recipe, Toast Box, and McDonald's, I had my lunch at the revamped Food Republic at Level 3, which was beautifully done up with the theme of ""Old Singapore"". There was a myriad of food choices to go for and I ended up with a Lemon Chicken Rice + Beansprouts that was actually quite affordable at SGD9.00, yum yum!

And the usual tenants found in both Singaporean and Malaysian malls can be spotted here, including Toys R Us, Tangs, Akemi Uchi, Best Denki, Uniqlo, H&M, Lego Shop, Coach, Sephora, Royal Sporting House, and the Big Two pharmacy chains (Guardian and Watson)... As well as not forgetting this place being the gateway into Sentosa, where a FUN Shop and ticketing counter are at - and where this cute blue model of the Express monorail landed in my hands! XD

So if anyone is making their way into the Lion City for work or leisure, just skip the struggling Orchard Road and head to VivoCity instead - you'll get more bang for your buck whether for shopping, entertainment, or food! :)"
,,International shops and sentosa linkway,4.0,,"Alot of international and local shops too,if you planning to take sentosa express or boardway you reach them through here"
,,large mall with a vibrant atmosphere,4.0,,"Despite having been around for years, Vivo City remains fresh and vibrant and does not seem to get old. The mall itself is very big and has lots of open spaces at the top. There are plenty of shops, some common and some a little quirky, that keeps the shoppers' interests piqued. There are also a large number of restaurants that makes it difficult for one to choose. The monorail to Sentosa Island departs from here as well so it adds another reason to visit this gorgeous mall."
,,My fav Singapore Shopping Centre,5.0,,"This place is huge and has so much to offer. Great stores, Gold Class Cinema, Chinese food market stalls, transportation to Sentosa. Is there nothing this place cant do?"
,,A lot option,4.0,,"Lots of choices of shops nice restaurants. Great playground for the kids, movie theater. It also gets super crowded sometimes, because very touristy."
,,Huge shopping centre,5.0,,Huge shopping centre where you will find all you need. At L2 they even have a big cinema. The monorail to sentosa goes from L3
,,Huuuuge,5.0,,Loved Vivo City. We went there to get the cable car to Sentosa and managed to get ourselves quite lost but the shopping centre itself was fantastic. A great supermarket underneath the complex and foodcourt on the same floor. Great range of shops that kept male and female shoppers happy in our party. Also has a Food Republic on the top floor so a huge range of food places to try. Highly recommend a visit.
,,Huge mall,4.0,,"The largest mall in Singapore, has a metro station and from there the funicular and the tramway to Sentosa Island leave."
,,Huge and amazing mall,5.0,,It is a very big and awesome market place. It has plenty of luxury brands. The colored fountains outside look beautiful in the evening. You have plenty of restaurants to cater your tastes. The design of the mall is also really good. Overall I loved it.
,,On our way to Sentosa Island,4.0,,It's a mall that is not as good as the ones on Orchard Road although it too has a great variety of restaurant's caf√©s and shops. The main reason for our visit was the fact that it has an monorail station connecting to Sentosa Island.
,,Stop over Sentosa,5.0,,This is the second time we visit this place on our way to Sentosa Island. It is a nice place to do window shopping. Worth visiting on your stop from Sentosa.
,,One-stop Getaway,4.0,,Vivo City is conveniently linked to Sentosa Island via the Sentosa Express tram system which takes you out of the island and plonks you right on Vivo City's lively doorstep. The mall has a roof deck that has a view of Sentosa Island and its boardwalk.
,,Great place to shop and dine,4.0,,Shopping and dining at Vivo City is a must. You can look forward to a wide variety of restaurants serving different cuisines of food. Not forgetting to visit Sentosa by just taking a tram or walking by the boardwalk. You would never regret going there.
,,Huge,5.0,,"This is a huge shopping mall near sentosa, well located at the southern parts of Singapore, huge amount of shops and food outlets here."
,,Good except one diaper changing table is very unfriendly,3.0,,"Playground area is really good The shopping mall has many restaurants, stores, etc But I found baby nursing room to have only one diaper changing table very unsatisfied and unfriendly"
,,Nice,4.0,,Big shopping mall and We particularly liked the Food Court designed to look like a Traditional Hawker. A mix of branded and unbranded shops and a lot of eateries to choose
,,Nice shopping mall,5.0,,"Another great shopping mall in Singapore. We came here after playing in Universal Studios. We bought a lot of stuff in here, from clothes, shoes and other things. We also ate in the food court in this shopping mall which taste delicious as well."
,,Another Great Shopping Mall,4.0,,"Shoppers ideal location to spend a few hours. A great selection of stores to browse, and plenty of places to ear/have a coffee break. You can take the express train from here to Sentosa."
,,Nice shopping mall,5.0,,Vivo city is a nice shopping mall with lots of shops and restaurants. We went to Sentosa in the morning and took the Sentosa Express train to the Vivo city in the afternoon. Spent sometime there before going back to hotel.
,,Shopping experience,5.0,,"Great shopping mall with lots of restaurants, stores to suit everyone. Outdoor garden areas, bike tracks."
,,Back to the nice good mall,4.0,,Back to the nice good Mall Vivo City The way to Sentosa island Busy in Sunday Every where in shops or restaurants I like to walk around relaxing
,,Enjoyed a lot,5.0,,A lot of shopping options as well as places to chill and enjoy food. Cinema is great. Convenient transpo options.
,,Great family friendly food,5.0,,"Great bars and restaurants on the ground floor overlooking the water. Excellent food court including a wide range of fresh foods and cuisines on the roof. Also children‚Äôs water play / wading pools on the roof. Great shopping, huge centre."
,,A huge shopping centre with open sky park !,5.0,,"Its a huge shopping center of Singapore. You can get to here by buses or by rail. Its adjacent to Harbourfront centre and Harbourfront rail station. I loved the the Vivocity mall. This place have many eateries and an food court too. Food court is bit cheaper and serves many types of food including Indian, Chinese, Vietnamese etc. You can spend some time in the sky park, which is basically a rooftop park. Nice view of the city from this place is worth mentioning."
,,Good mall with little shops,5.0,,I've visit this place couple times and able to found some unknown eclectic shops and bargain books at the book fair. It's pretty compact mall with good food court too
,,Good shopping mall,5.0,,"Good number of shops, if on sale, can have good shopping good options for food and eating if you have kids, nice play area for them to play close to cable car"
,,Just shopping,4.0,,"VivoCity is the mall located in Singapore's Harbourfront district. It features wide, open spaces for waterfront relaxation and entertainment, and a full calendar of festivals and events that draw both local and foreign visitors. It is the largest shopping centre in Singapore."
,,Top shopping,5.0,,Probably the largest shopping center I've seen ... honestly say I think you'd need 3 days to look around it and you can get the mono rail or cable car to Santosa where there's loads to do the Luge carts or universal studios and loads more lovely place
,,Nice vibe in this well organised place.,5.0,,"On Singapore's southern shore , this impressively large shopping mall appears to have everything; good location, plenty of brand restaurants , cinema and numerous shops from fashion to books. Nice vibe in this well organised place. Very popular."
,,Shopping,5.0,,This was by far a larger mall in Saigon with many sjops and restaurants. We came back few days later for more shopping.
,,"Everything under one roof, and more...",4.0,,"Definitely one of the better shopping malls in Singapore, you can get or find almost everything for all ages here. The mall is easily accessible via MRT and is spacious enough to find your personal space although incessantly crowded. The shops are dynamic and ever-changing with the latest trends. I recalled visiting a mega bookshop here years ago which has since disappeared during my recent visit. Given its location across Sentosa Island and with the recent completion of the covered walkway across to that island, you could also take a lovely stroll across to Sentosa (about 20 minutes each direction) and be rewarded with views of the Singapore port, Resorts World Sentosa, and cruise ships anchored at the Singapore Harbour Cruise Centre."
,,One of the better malls here in Singapore.,4.0,,"This place is huge. It is quite long, however, not many floors in height. There is everything you could need or want in a shopping mall. High end, mid range brand names and supermarkets. Restaurants, cafes and even a cinema. It‚Äôs all here."
,,Tonnes of shopping options,4.0,,The shopping mall is located at the harbour front and is the entry point to Sentosa island (if you are taking the monorail). There are a lot of outlets of various brands if you are looking to shop (including Cotton On and Forever 21). There are also lot of restaurants where you can eat. If you are going to the Sentosa island it would be ideal to have your meal here since the shops at Sentosa are overpriced.
,,A vivacious city,4.0,,"This massive shopping complex looks like a self contained city because it seems to have everything money can buy - designer shops, restaurants. Its easy to get lost in the labyrinth of shops on the different floors. The shop i liked most was the Choco Express and I'm sure I was one of its best patrons!

The place is always crowded, more so in the Christmas season."
,,Overcrowded on holidays,4.0,,Came on Dec 26 after visiting USS. This mall is huge but still overly crowded with the visitors. There are a lot of shops from mid range to luxury. This mall also connected with the MRT station and Monorail to Sentosa Island.
,,Large and overcrowded,2.0,,Don't make the mistake of coming here on a weekend or in the evening as it gets extremely crowded along the relatively narrow walkways. There are all the usual generic brands you find in any of the other larger malls in Singapore. Connected via mrt from nearby Harbourfront station. Also the entry point to Sentosa on the Sentosa Express. But I generally try and avoid this place if at all possible due to too many people.
,,Love this one,5.0,,"Its my favorite mall, you get everything here, view, good food! I just go there take a walk outside following the sea water and enjoying the view!! Then you have so many options to choose from when it comes to food! Shopping oh i just love it here!"
,,One of the bigger mall with lots of options in Singapore,4.0,,"This mall is huge and if one really wants to explore all that it has to offer, spending a full day here might be necessary. There are also a huge variety of food and beverage options so no worries about going hungry. Unlike other malls in Singapore, this mall has limited mall promotions nor are their ""membership"" remarkable. However, one distinct feature of this mall is the space. Could be that this mall is away from the city and prime area resulting in cheaper rentals, shoppers here (mostly) do not feel as squeeze and shopping and moving around the place have a relax atmosphere to it. Sentosa is also within walking distance from the mall."
,,Singapore's largest shopping mall,4.0,,"On an island with few natural attractions, it's only natural (please excuse the pun) that locals gravitate towards shopping and eating to pass the time. And the larger the shopping mall that facilitates these activities, the better. That Vivo City is the island's largest shopping mall probably excites (it's shopping heaven) and turns away (crowds can be crazy) folks in equal measure. Nevertheless, it's a useful place to engage in retail and culinary therapy with loads of shops and restaurants to suit every budget. Vivo City is linked by the MRT and buses, so it's easy to get to. And it serves as the terminal station for the monorail to Sentosa Island, another good reason to go there."
,,Great place to shop!,4.0,,"I have been to this shopping centre on numerous occasions and although it is away from Orchard St. and the CBD I have always enjoyed a fast MRT trip to this great shopping centre.
There are shops upon shops and many if not most of the top brands in clothing, footwear etc are represented here.
I particularly like certain brands of clothing and have always been successful in obtaining and fulfilling my wishes.
Probably not the best for dining but never the less reasonable food is available.
While there a few weeks ago there was a huge Singaporean Marines display which was very informative and by the attendance of many young school age teenagers I would think that it was well accepted by Singaporeans.
The ""city"" is spacious, clean and well laid out and a showcase of the shopping centres of Singapore. Will be back again in a few weeks time!"
,,Quality time with myself,5.0,,Vivo city is my favourite place to walk or just enjoying me time. The place is quite big and what makes it so special that it has roof top park with the view of harbor and sentosa island.
,,Vivo City,4.0,,Fun shopping for all. Many choices of stuffs available and a lot of eateries available too. A must for everyone.
,,What a mall !,4.0,,Fabulous mall ! Comfortable connection to Sentosa ... so much of food options ... so many shops at varied prices. Some lovely waterfront bars ... and hypermart ... just avoid taking cab from there and go to harbour front !
,,Excellent shopping,5.0,,"Both super luxurious and cheaper places share the same shopping mall, located by the ferry terminal in southern Singapore. For the movie nerd, there are several shops offering memorabilia from sci-fi and fantasy movies. Clothing, luxury items, electronics... everything is available in this super large mall. Convenient parking (at no charge)."
,,A scene that worth your attentions this Christmas,5.0,,"This Pre-Xmas decor for year 2017 seems great! The sparkling of those LEDs bulbs on the Xmas tree lighted up in that dark sky. The views before last light was great, nice backdrop with the details like those u can find in the oil painting. If u have the opportunity, please give this place a visit and enjoy the scenaries."
,,Great Place to Shop,4.0,,Big shopping mall with many shops and restaurants to go for. You can go our via MRT if you want to and also you can choose to take the Tram or Cable Car to Sentosa from there.
,,Busy Mall Near Sentosa Island,5.0,,Vivo City is one of the busier malls in Singapore. There is a nice food court located at the top of the building and you can take a cable car ride from here to Sentosa Island. The air conditioning is good....a perfect place to hide from the sweltering heat of Singapore sun. Lots of good F&B outlets to choose from.
,,Good Shopping Centre...,5.0,,Worth killing an hour to escape the heat or showers. Lots of brand names to see and lots of places to eat. Easy to get to via the MRT.
,,Varieties of food but messy table top.,2.0,,A place i can always look forward for nice and reasonable food. But clean table are hard as it is messy with leftover plate and food. Disappointing.
,,Flagship Mall,5.0,,"It was the biggest mall I saw in Singapore. It is well connected to MRT (metro) and public transport. It also is the Sentosa Express starting point. It houses many brands, restaurants and it located near harbour."
,,Nice mall,4.0,,The mall provides all the good brands and restaurants . Quite happening mall with decent number of crowd.
,,Shopping at Vivo City,4.0,,The kid‚Äôs playground on the rooftop was excellent. It‚Äôs nice and clean and very well maintained. Vast variety of shops at this mall.
,,Great meeting spot for MRT & Sentosa too,4.0,,"We travelled here a few times recently as we stayed both in the city and then Sentosa. It's a handy spot for catching connections in the MRT as well as doing a bit of shopping. The food hall on the lower ground is great with loads of choices, but we love spicy foods so happy here. First thing in the morning the bulk of the shops may not be open but by late morning the centre is busy and bustling. We also found use of the taxi rank around the back- use an app if you can to book as we waited 30 minutes mid afternoon - fine if you have time.
A nicely presented place, all in all."
,,Gateway to many attractions,3.0,,"For many years that we have been coming to and fro SG, Vivo City is the gateway to Sentosa, Universal Studios and Batam, Indonesia. It's a food hub, money exchange, and MRT interchange to many points and destinations."
,,Shopping centre Sentosa,3.0,,"Attended the shopping centre with my husband. Numerous shops for men, women and children. Clean and cool.

We had a free shuttle service from our hotel but were already at Resorts World and it was too early for the shuttle so we got a taxi over. It cost approx $8 SD.

Within the complete there are many cafes and restaurants. We went to a cafe and had a lovely Caesar salad and a reasonable price $10 SD.

Only trouble we had was leaving the shops. We wanted to leave before our shuttle had arrived and get a taxi. This was extremely hard to do and ended up waiting 40min for our shuttle.

Great idea would be a paper map of the shops. They do have the technology based maps spread around but I think the old fashion maps come in handy when technology is down or when u r in a restaurant or shop wanting to plan your next move."
,,Nice children playground and food,4.0,,"Very good and free children playground at Level-2, reasonable priced and wide variety of food at basement, is a good place to have food before or after go to sentosa island.

The famous Ya Kun Kaya Toast is here too, can plan for breakfast here, they open 0815.

If you are tourist, you can also buy Irwin Salted Egg Fish Skin at the basement (ofcourse with Q also) if you cannot get it at airport, remember ask them to issue tax refund receipt."
,,Very Good Food Court,4.0,,"Big shopping mall on the way to Sentosa. We particularly liked the Food Court designed to look like a Traditional Hawker Centre. Very clean, good food and lots of variety. We were there for a very late lunch, lots of stalls had lunchtime specials. The prices were very reasonable."
,,Good Shopping Mall,4.0,,Good Shopping Mall to stroll around after a fun filled day at Universal Studios. A mix of branded and unbranded shops and a lot of eateries to choose from.
,,Cool but big and not user friendly,4.0,,"Great mall. Lots of choices of shops nice restaurants ( cool food court). Great playground for the kids, movie theater. Main issue is the lack of logic in the design and most importantly lack of signs in the mall. We went several times and it is so easy to get lost or confused (and we are mall experts). The worst is if you come by car. Memorise well your location and your entry point because patking is a labyrinth. It also gets super crowded sometimes, because very touristy. Now you know so good luck :-)"
,,"Interesting Place to hang out, many things to do and buy!",4.0,,"Our trip to Singapore made us visit this shopping mall. We found it interesting and good place to spend few hours, walking, eating, drinking with an access to the tube and overground bus service. In close proximity to Sentosa."
,,Great place for shopping,5.0,,Good place to go for shopping in Singapore where you will find all the big brands with lot of varieties!!!
,,Great Shopping,5.0,,"We stayed at the Excelsior and it was so easy to get to this Mall on the MRT from Clarke Quay. MRT goes right under the Mall so you do not have to go outside at all.
We sometimes struggle to find what we want in Singapore as we are not interested in Designer clothes etc. This Mall has it all,from the expensive to the everyday and also lots of food outlets. We found everything we wanted and reasonably priced. Next time we visit Singapore we will definitely shop here.
Great views of Sentosa Island from outside.."
,,going to Sentosa,4.0,,"Before going to Sentosa, you can go the VIVOCity for a walk. You must walk through here before you go to Sentosa, by Express or on foot. It is a good place for air conditioning and eating before enter Sentosa. Everything is Sentosa is expensive, so it is good Idea to bug things like snack and water before enter Sentosa"
,,Good place for shopping & dining in Singapore,4.0,,This is a huge place to visit in Singapore. You shopping around and having dining here. Don't forget to visit their Kopitiam food court at the ground flour. But maybe need your passion to have a seat during lunch time
,,Huge mall,4.0,,"This mall is a definite must visit. Prices are fairly good but more so lots of restaurants are here. Perfect for lunch or dinner. You have some facing the sea port. Also great for children.

Make sure to visit if you are in Sentosa even if it's just for lunch or dinner."
,,With small children,3.0,,"It's a huge mall with lots of variety of major brands and eateries. Many people will spend time on the way to Sentosa, it's a nice cool respite from the Singapore humidity. However, we spent less time than we hoped as the splash park and playground are exposed to the full sun and as such we're very uninviting."
,,Go there for some dinner,4.0,,"Go to Vivo city in the evening. Take MRT to harbour front via. Dhouby Ghat (shorter route).

Mall is as good as any other mall, however there are some really cool dinner places by the view of sea on harbour front (e.g., Marche, Modesto and others).

You can spend some time sitting outdoors with friends or take a walk around.

Also must try the Japanese store Daiso on Level 3, they sell everything for dollar 2 and makes for some great quick shopping."
,,Easy stop when at sentosa,4.0,,Came over for dinner one night and lunch in the food court another day. Shopping was a mix of mainstream stuff you can get in the US and many other Asian and European stores. The food court was very cheap (~6sgd average) and we all enjoyed our food.
,,Fantastic view,4.0,,"Inside this big mall,some of the restaurants are facing the seaport, the island and having a fantastic view especially at night"
,,Kids Playground,4.0,,The kids playground and the rooftop was excellent. Its nice and clean and very well maintained. The foodcourt beside the Sentosa Express station was also great. They sell a wide range of Singaporean delicacies.
,,"Exclusive food, shopping and casino",4.0,,"For some exclusive moments in Singapore, vivo city is a good idea. You will find the exclusive branded shops for watch, shoes etc.) Good restaurants of local food and international cuisine are there. From vivo city, you can buy ticket for sentosa/ Sentosa"
,,Multipurpose mall,4.0,,"It is one of the biggest malls in Singapore. Usually, what my friends and I do is going to Sentosa and before or after the trip to the island, we would spend some time in the hawker centre at the topmost floor of Vivo City. At the basement, one can catch MRT trains to continue their journey to anywhere in Singapore."

,,One of the best Malls.,5.0,,"It was my first time visiting Singapore and I could already tell that I will enjoy my vacation and fall inlove with the place. My cousin took me on a tour to Sentosa Island and we passed by Vivo City to explore and have lunch. This is probably one of the best malls I‚Äôve been to and very clean, fun, and nice food court. (Hawker style)

If I go back again, I will look around more and check out the entire mall since I didn‚Äôt really get to walk around much (It‚Äôs a huge mall) It was also conveniently located near the area we were staying at and is accesible via Metro."

2. There are Halal foods available

3. There are all what you may need for your trip"
,,Great Mall,5.0,,Vivo city is a must visit cool mall. The roof top gives you a great view of the harbour and the port. They have children's play areas also. Lots of places to eat and dine.

The market has a water perk on the top floor where u can practically enjoy a boat ride!! Good and spacious shopping mall and when I lost hope to find xiaomi products in Singapore other than online shops suddenly I bumped into one and only 'challenger ' the super cool electronic gadget shop. But alas! I had a very little time with my toddler crying a lot to get home soon."

,,Ok but not great,3.0,,"Has shops like Zara, Mango, Marks & Spencer, Levi's, Forever new etc... hard to understand where you are interlinked sections between shops mentioned above and cheap & tacky. Sentosa hotels offer free transfers to Vivo City to promote. Easy to get to from Sentosa by light rail/ monorail which is also free for Sentosa guests."
,,Nice Shopping Mall,4.0,,The first thing I love is the variety of food that sell in the Food Republic. Apart from that lots of things that you can find there.
,,"Very busy, very large",4.0,,This mall is a train station for subway and the cable car station to Sentosa at the same time. Large mall with any typical shop and loads of cafes and restaurants. It also offers a nice view to Sentosa Island.

This morning the NE line train was full of excited people - standing room only.- most headed to the Sentosa Express or the walkway across to the island.

I had a wander around -- most retail chains have an outlet - food options on most levels...I enjoyed morning tea while there.

There is also a movie complex in the mall - lots to do without going to Sentosa Island."
,,Everything starts from here,5.0,,To reach this mall you have to take mrt to harbourfront station. Everything starts from here. Here is the sentosa express train to go to sentosa.here is the ticket office and the station of the cable car to go to sentosa.

,,Train link to Sentosa,3.0,,"Its more famous for the monorail link to Sentosa than anything else.
Also has an underground MRT link.

The huge roof top garden is very unique and unexpected. And next to it is the busiest and most organised food courts i have ever seen.

Its a unique mall due to a lot of reasons and you do not get a taxi after 10pm. Which is a horrendous experience.

You will be left stranded if you dont know bus or MRT routes.
So plan your visit accordingly if you have your family with you."
,,Bridge to other worlds,4.0,,"I often came here to take ferry to Indonesia because it's connected to the ferry terminal. However, Vivo offers more than just that. There are lots of shopping varieties and great restaurants. There even used to be the amazing NatGeo store once and it was amazing. When you go to Sentosa, this is also the hub that connects the island to Singapore mainland."
,,Reasonable shops and size convenient to Sentosa,4.0,,"This has all the main shops, M & S, Zara, Uni goo etc etc. Not always very big branches but enough to keep you entertained for a couple of hours.

,,Wifi never works and everything closes at 10,3.0,,"Wifi hardly ever works in any part of the centre. We visited over a long weekend and the Centre was so busy, there were lines at almost every food outlet. The positive is that there is such a large variety of stores, and a cinema. But they could do with a better variety of food outlets... especially because what they have clearly can't keep up with the demand. The food republic upstairs on level 3 is pretty good, but very hard to find a seat! Also, why does everything close at 10... every night we went the place was still jammed full of people at closing time."
,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,Allow a full day for shopping at this centre. Lots to do for kids and great place to get a photo of Sentosa Island. MRT stops in basement. Plenty of food options. Great escape from the heat
,,great place,5.0,,VIVO City is a mall where you take the metro to the sentosa island from the third floor. The mall was good place to shop. however not comparable to Orchard Road
,,All under one roof,4.0,,This is probably one of the biggest if not the biggest mall in Singapore. It is convenient to get there via MRT (Harbour Front MRT station). It has loads of retail shops and F&B for you to choose from. Golden Village cinema is also situated inside the mall.

,,Singapore's largest shopping centre,4.0,,"At Vivo City, there is generally something for everyone. Large stores are side by side with small retailers. Access is easy, via either public transport or the many available car parking spaces.
A visitor need never be hungry, with the many food outlets, or the hawker centres. These in particular are very busy at some times of the day, so patience may be required."

,,Amazing space and offers an array of places to eat and shop,4.0,,"Love Vivo for the open foyers and array of places to eat and shop. The open spaces and courtyard is amazing. The best part is the connectivity to Sentosa. Universal Studios, the Waterpark and other attractions are so easily accessible and there are so many things to do around Vivo. The hawker's centre is great (there are 2) and I love the fact that it has and MRT station, making it easy to get to. Highly recommend it though it gets very busy during the weekends. It boasts a Marches and a Jamie Olivers for all the gourmands out there."
,,What can I say? It's a mall.,3.0,,"Convenient if you're coming off Sentosa Island and need something, but I wouldn't make a special trip to see it. You catch the Sentosa Express Monorail here which is free with an Island hotel reservation."
,,Great food court,5.0,,"The food court in Vivo city is awesome. Good Asian food, very reasonable price. Cheaper than some of the touristy hawker centres. Loved it."
,,Not Smartphone,3.0,,Vivo City has no connection with Vivo Smartphone. It's one point to reach Sentosa Island & Batam by ferry.
,,A big shopping + walkway to Sentosa,4.0,,"We went to Vivo City to take the monorail to Sentosa, didn't expect this is so big, lots of restaurants, the podium is quite beautiful. As the monorail was broken down, we walk to Sentosa, it's hot, but a good experience."
,,One of Mega Malls,4.0,,One of the large Mega Malls in Singapore with a lot of brands to choose from. There are plenty of restaurants too.

,,Excellent shopping centre,5.0,,"Seems to be more of a local shopping centre rather than upmarket like most of Orchard Road. great choice of shops, lots of dining options including good value food courts. Probably my favourite shopping centre in Singapore. Open to late every night and good for tourists as it provides access to the Sentosa island Monorail and is right next door to the Cable Car base."
,,Suprise,4.0,,"I was staying in a hotel across the road. I went for an evening stroll to find Vivo City on my door step. Its standard Asia mall with hundreds of shops, many cheaper than orchard road area. Nice surprise, good food ranging from cheap local to upper price restaurants. I didn't buy much but it was all there. I wouldn't travel from elsewhere in Singapore to visit, but if you're near it go and have a look, or if its pouring down!"
,,Great shopping...,5.0,,A fantastic shopping mall with everything you need. You could probably spend all day here looking around the shops!
,,Lack of lifts,4.0,,"Being one of the biggest mall in Singapore with direct access to Sentosa, Ferry terminal, and so on this place is always crowded during weekdays or weekends. Going here could be stressful as it is packed. Carrying a stroller also not easy as only two major lifts and the people who are too lazy to walk always easily slips in the elevator regarding there's people in wheelchairs in need. The mall itself is filled with many stores that sells international and local brands. From fashion, beauty, cosmetics, groceries, food items, restaurants, banks, and so many more, even when you're not satisfied the harbourfront mall is connected for a more variety of options. We found that harbourfront is more locals and bargain while Vivo City is more high ends and International. The food area is on the basement where there Giant Hypermarket. There's a lot of restaurants, food courts and food stalls along the way. All the way up there's clothing and huge department stores. The unique part is the deck, where on a special occasion there's big ship coming. There's a lovely place to enjoy sunset, and very romantic ambience when there's no people smoking. When there is, it's not easy to breathe. Sometime during weekend there like thede bazaar stalls open on the outdoor, usually some tidbits for the kids. There's a outdoor water playground that the kids will love. It's one of the first in Singapore with adequate space for running children. So there you go. A place for the family. Fun, many offers from medical, style, activities and so on just need to bear the lifts if you carrying strollers or on a wheelchair, I do hope they add more lifts in the future for those in need only. Like a special restricted lifts until the people in Singapore or visitors could be considerate enough."
,,Just another mall,3.0,,"Nothing special about this mall at all. Stock standard shops with a few cafes, restaurants and food court. Positives are it's a good spot to catch the cable car and there is a taxi stand there too. Much better places to visit."
,,Nice shopping place,4.0,,Went here to buy and try the famous Irvins salted egg potato chips and fish skin. Besides that its a good shopping center near Sentosa. Very accessible to mrt and bus

,,"Many Shops, many things to do",5.0,,"One of my favourite mall, the cinema is great, there is a lot of food option, apparel brands, the rooftop park is really nice, for hanging out, for kids etc. There is a whole lot of transport option too. Great for killing time and shopping."

I really enjoyed the time spent here and had a blast looking at all the different shops to go into. This was a different experience for me as we don't have a shopping centre this big near me."
,,Shopping! The best remedy on a rainy day,4.0,,Shopping mall with a wide variety in shops. I say ' let's go shopping when it rains.' A large shopping mall near the harbour with a great and close view on the harbour in the roof. Don't go to the 3rd for food. There's a better selection of little resto's on the 1st.

,,Amazing Shopping Centre,5.0,,"This has absolutely everything you could ever want from a shopping centre.....we just wandered for hours trying to take everything in.
Then you can relax watching the river as it sits on the water front...we went on the monorail from Sentosa to VIVO City...well worth the effort."
,,Good for shopping,4.0,,"Its a nice destination for shopping n outing, great stores n deals , the terrace garden n views are amazing, lots activities for kids."
,,Convenient shopping mall,4.0,,"We spent the day at Sentosa island and then went to Vivo City by foot. Beautiful walk and there were some night markets near vivo city which were awesome and cheap, and you were able to bargain!
Coming from New Zealand the shops in Vivo City were more or else the same. We were hoping to check out the Singapore brands and shops however the mall is mainly worldwide brands. A bit confusing navigating around as they also have shops and food courts in the car park floors. Other than that, good and worth checking out!"

,,Alternative to Orchard Road,5.0,,"I stayed a couple of days in Sentosa for a corporate meeting. While I would have wanted to squeeze in a little shopping time at Orchard Road, my schedule just couldn't permit it as Sentosa is a bit far from the city center. Vivo City was a great option! If you're staying in a hotel in Sentosa, you can get to Vivo city by riding the train from Imbiah or Waterfront station. The hotel would provide you with a purple card that allows you to use the train for free. The place is huge so you'll find most of the favorite shops there. Also a lot of choices of restaurants and bars. The mall was also like a park where a lot of activities for the kids are available eg paddle boats."

,,Nice and clean,4.0,,The mall is very nice and everything is available there. Price is average. If you visit universal studio you must visit this mall.
,,Unless you really know you shall wander where am I,5.0,,"One thing all visiting to Singapore must remember is that they do not have any ground floor at Singapore. What we generally understand as ground floor is call as Level 1 at Singapore. B 1 and B 2 etc are the basement floors. Vivo city is a mall with around two basement floors and three floors atop itself. It is situated right at the top of the Harbour Front MRT station. This is also the starting point towards the Sentosa resort world.

Vivo city has a very large number of shops. It has become a culmination of two different malls as One. Namely the Vivo city and Harbour shopping center. You can find almost all brands find their presence over here. This is a huge place. In case you get lost anywhere the best way to trace your route is by locating the Concierge counter that freely guides the visitors about anything and everything.

There is a food court in the basement of the mall. It has a Kiosk at the 3rd floor that sells sentosa packages. We visited this place around three times during our visit. Two times to catch the Cable car and the Mono rail. I recommend this place for serious shoppers and window grazers."

The foodcourt is quite crowded and you need to secure your place so that you can sit after paying the food."
,,Great place to chill and shop,5.0,,"Enormous expanse of shopping and dining at reasonable prices....also a transport hub for MTR and monorail. Ate a few days here and there are a vast array of really good caf√©s and restaurants, both European and Asian, mostly around the outside, overlooking the busy harbour."
,,A great place to shop,5.0,,"\We spent the afternoon here, amazing selection of shops and restaurants. Could have spent days here. Very clean and worth a visit."
,,Probably the best Australian like shopping centre,5.0,,"Compared to many of the Orchard road establishments I found this one to be more logically laid out. More choices of western food and in general more food variety than Orchard road shopping centers I visited. (that catered almost exclusively to Asian tastes) Whilst there is still lots of overpriced luxury stores there was some good shopping - a huge Toy's R US , Tangs and other mid-tier brand name stores. e.g Sketchers

From the shopping center Level 3 you can take the Monorail to Sentosa Island so its a good location to start your trip in Singapore at."

,,Cheap Local Eatery,4.0,,"Visited Vivo city after undertaking Southern Ridges walk. It is like all Singapore shopping centre however on the third floor there is a small eatery serving various styles of food and at very low prices ( $4 for rice, meat of choice and vegetables).
The food was freshly cooked and I would highly recommend for anyone on a budget."
,,A wonderful potpourri to please everyone !,5.0,,"This suburban mall in the south close to Sentosa has developed fully over the years to be a popular haunt and it's really crowded on weekends.

Our favorite restaurants :
Level 1 : Crystal Jade Jiang Nan, Crystal Jade Dining In, Serenity (Spanish), Jumbo Jpot (steamboat)
Level 2 : Sushi tei, Shin Kushiya, Putien
Basement 2 : Ichiban Boshi, London Fat Duck (for good dim sum)

For cheap eats :
Kopi Tiam food court at B2 and Food Republic at Level 2

The big anchor shops here are Tangs (departmental store), Best Denki (electronics) and Giant (hypermarket).
Not to miss is also the famous $2 shop called Daiso at level 2.

If you fancy a walk, the waterfront promenade connects with the Sentosa Boardwalk to lead you all the way to Sentosa and the entry is free.

All in all, something for everyone."
,,Good Mall,5.0,,"A lot of retail / shops here so you don't have to go all the way to Orchard to look for an item or two. The mall itself is definetely better after the renovation about 5 years ago. There are 2 food courts: the one on the top floor (a bit over priced), and the one on the basement (next to MRT station, the price is not pricey, but nowadays there are less option here than usual)."
,,Plenty of Shops,4.0,,"Relatively high end shopping but some good food selection, access to harbour ferries and cable car is near by and straight forward as well as MRT number one line underneath the mall. To big electronics stores as well - we found a mobile wifi hotspot device in the Best Dinki."
,,All in one shopping mall,5.0,,1. Good for families and everyone 2. All in one shopping mall 3. Easy to find everything as it's all in one building 4. Spoilt for choices for food 5. Family Friendly
,,"Come only if you are going to Universal Studios, Sentosa or to catch Pokemon",3.0,,"This is a typical suburban mall, though it's pretty large. Would not recommend you to make a special trip to Vivocity for shopping unless you are going to Sentosa or Universal Studios or taking a cruise to nearby Batam or Bintan. Most of the shops in this mall can be found in Orchard Road (Zara, Mango, Uniqlo, H&M, Esprit, etc). The anchor tenant is Tangs, Giant supermarket and GV cinema. There's a good variety of food options here. Mall tends to be crowded on weekends or when the cruise ship docks in the adjoining HarbourFront. This is a great place to go if you are into Pok√©mon go. There's many poke stops within the mall and pokemons :D"
,,Higher end mall next to where the cruise ships dock,4.0,,The higher end sister to the Harbour Front Centre mall which sits next to it. Very convenient when embarking or disembarking on a cruise. At the end of the mall there is a metro station to get to Sentosa as well as a walkway. Inside the mall you will find the usual suspects consisting of higher end stores and a mix of restaurants from Burger King to finer fare. There is also a convenient grocery store there.
,,"Great for shopping, but no Indian or Vegetarian Food",3.0,,"This is a huge mall, quite a lot of shopping options from budget - mid range to high end. Good for shopping clothes, accessories, electronics, toys etc.

There are at least 50 outlets for food (restaurants, cafes, fast food, kopitiam etc.) But we struggled to find any outlet offering Indian food or vegetarian food. This is surprising considering a lot of Indian locals or tourist visit Vivo City / Harboufront to hop into Sentosa. We could go to Subway for veggie sandwich."
,,Expensive and not well organised,2.0,,"The one of the largest shopping center in Singapore.
There are certainly many shops, restaurants and cafes around.
It connect to famous Sentosa.

The prices of those places are too high and not really worth it.

View from the top and children's water play area is good but facilities are not well maintained just like rest of Singapore playgrounds and dirty.

The worst things at this place is taxi queue....
Those expensive $50 one way trip taxi awaiting while normal taxis are hardly coming in. The operator could provide much better services but they on purposely not provide cheaper one then keep shouting ""Taxi is here!"" for the expensive one to offer...

I just wish they show more kindness and willingness for the services they provides in Singapore so people would not feel pressured and neglected."
,,A lot to see and a lot to do,5.0,,"If you fancy a day of shopping this is a great place to go. There are a few high end shops but mostly affordable, midrange priced shops. There is definitely something for everyone in this shopping centre. There is also a cinema here too if you fancy catching a movie."
,,Very nice and modern and big shopping centre with great food republic on the rooftop,4.0,,"+ nice and modern shopping centre
+ many shops
+ Tangs
+ many food options
+ great Food Republic on the roof top
+ Daiso
+ nice location at Harbour Front
+ MRT and busses
+ nice architecture
+ Giant and Cold Storage

- very full on weekends"
,,Nice harbour mall,3.0,,"quant little mall situated just on the way to Sentosa Island, not as good as other Singapore Downtown Malls, but is big enough to spend an afternoon browsing. Full of cafes, restaurants and places to eat, shop, relax, clothes, electrical goods, hair salon and more"
,,Restaurants galore,4.0,,This is a mall near Sentosa Island. easily reached by SMRT (Station in the basement) and monorail connecting to Sentosa Island. Large parking garage also. Plenty of stores but what attracted me more are the very diverse restaurants in the mall. From authentic Hawkers food court to Western restaurants.
,,"Excellent food, shopping and atmosphere.",5.0,,"Vivo city is just as you exit Harbour front MRT station, there is everything from food, right through to household goods to be bought.

You also access the Sentosa boardwalk and shuttle train from here as well as the sentosa cable car.

A very lively and interesting shopping centre with plenty to see and do. Worth a visit if your on your way to Sentosa or just fancy some shopping."
,,You name it you can find it,5.0,,A visit to Sentosa can not be completed without visiting Vivo city mall. Awesome array of shops. We spent our entire evening buying items on Christmas sale. A time worth spent by ladies.
,,Popular and crowded at all times,4.0,,"Went on Christmas Day and it was crowded as expected, Long queue to reach drop off point but fortunately our Uber driver knew a second drop off at level 2 so we saved 20 min.
Plenty and plenty of restaurants and shops and some facing Sentosa have nice views.
It's connected to HarbourFront mall and Sentosa via train, his place is always crowded with both locals and tourists."
,,Deserves a visit in its own right,4.0,,"On previous trips to Singapore I've only visited Vivo City briefly as I've passed through it on the way to, and on the way back from, Sentosa.

However, this last time I decided to make a special effort to spend a few hours there without tiring myself by visiting Sentosa on the same day. I'm glad I did.

There's a good mix of retail outlets as well as many dining options. I had the pleasure of sharing a table in the Food Court with a lovely local lady and her two young daughters. I had soy sauce chicken and rice and a watermelon juice and it was delicious. We had a long, pleasant conversation and I left with a light heart and feeling rejuvenated.

Whilst walking around I came upon a stall manned by volunteers who were selling handmade items made by elderly nursing home residents. The money they made was to go towards funding their care facility. I bought three very colourful table mats and a useful pen holder, and when I look at them in my home I'm reminded of my enjoyable time at Vivo City."
,,Great mall with good eateries and affordable shopping,4.0,,"Its a must do when you visit sentosa. Most brands had good offers.. We picked up from sephora, aeropostale, Mac.. good eateries like bread talk and subway.. you need at least two hours to check out shops and more of you intend to really shop."
,,Reach the Sentosa island and Universal Studio through Vivo city Mall,4.0,,"if you were in Vivocity mall Singapore, you could easly reach Sentosa island. By Walk-through the level 1 until you had the exit (u may find artificial flowers statue) then go head and walking using the Sentosa Boardwalk.

but if travel by MRT you could:
take North-East line/Circle line to HarbourFront station.
arrived at Harbourfront station, you could enter the resort by: taking the RWS8 bus to the Resort. taking the Sentosa Express. walking using the Sentosa Boardwalk."
,,Lots of options for shopping and dining,4.0,,"Vivocity is a great mall with well-rounded options for both mid- and high-end shopping. We can spend hours just hanging out at the Skypark on the top floor, sipping drinks purchased from the huge supermarket (literally called ""Giant"") at the basement level, or maybe some iced coffee from both local kopi shops and international chains. It's also a great place to hunt for rare Water-type Pokemon if that was your thing. Great fun for all ages!"
,,Hurray !!,4.0,,If u have a child who is super active and u don't know how to take out his energy - this place is must !! From train ride to motorised vehicles to water play to toddler play to good food to amazing outlets - your hands are full !! One of best malls - a Singapore has
,,Merry Christmas Vivocity,5.0,,Came here with family and baby. This mall is very friendly with baby stroller. They have a playground on the top floor. Children will happy to play. They also have an outdoor Christmas tree. Merry Christmas Vivocity.
,,"Roque One At Atrium, Roque Two At Messy Banquet/Kopitiam",3.0,,"Vivo City is a shopping city.

A myriad of stores touting favorite international brands, countless fast food outlets, top notch dining treasures, food alleys, food courts, beverage stalls, classy coffee joints, banks, money changers, big name bakeries, candy empires, supermarkets, cinemas, departmental stores, DIY outlets, hairdressers, hair salons, cosmetic giants, spacious sky terrace, proximity and easy access to Sentosa and its sea surrounds, seamless transfer from Harbour Front MRT station - convenience defined.

My visit in Dec 2016 saw the Atrium converted partially into a Star Wars set. Reindeers floated mid-air. It was Christmassy but Christmas subdued ... in the mall.
Outside ... on the Sky Terrace.. in the open.. stood a massive, impressive Chrismas Tree. Wonderful.

Not so wonderful, however, was my experience at Banquet/Kopitiam. The chicken rice dish cost $6. The dining area was completely occupied. This was aggravated by soild dishes not cleared from tables vacated by diners who had finished eating. I had to, like others, stack up trays of used crockery onto tables and chairs so I can have a decent eat.

Not so Good Tidings, I fear."
,,Nice shops,4.0,,I liked this mall the best It was nice cheap and had good food places It has all top brands The MRT is just there
,,Shopping...what else!,5.0,,"There are soooooo many shopping opportunities in Singapore but I would recommend Vivo City as the number one go to. They have a vast variety of stores and food outlets as well as a great cimema outlet to take a few hours aside to sit, relax and see a movie."
,,MUST-VISIT: Largest Mall in Singapore,5.0,,Vivo City is the largest mall in Singapore that has many many shops that caters to people of all ages. You can also get to Sentosa via the tram at the top floor. Definitely a must-visit for tourists visiting Singapore. Alight at Harbourfront Station on the North-East Line or Circle Line.
,,Lots of shops and restaurants,4.0,,My hotel on Sentosa has shuttle bus to come here. Also well connected with MRT. All major chain stores and many restaurants to choose from.
,,So comfusing,3.0,,This is a massive mid tier shopping center - which pretty much has everything BUT be prepared to get lost because it looks virtually the same where ever you are. The developers should have realized this would make some shoppers frustrated specially when in a hurry.
,,Massive!,4.0,,"Vivo city, like its name, is a massive shopping mall. It connects with Harbourfront shopping centre, which is also a ferry terminal. Its 10-15mins away the all spicy Sentosa island for your recreation activities. My mum is wheelchair bound and we were just shopping around the area. Lifts are quite far away from whereever we walk so we gotta make huge rounds to get to it. Some wheelchair toilets are faulty as well. Often roadshow by various stalls happens with attractive gift aways and discounts. Lots of place to eat as well and has a movie theatre by golden village. Favourite part, Giant Hypermart. Good place if youre on a budget and need to get your everything at decent quality . All in all, it us quite crowded most of the time."
,,small,3.0,,another mall in Singapore. small but in a good location. the waterfront in the back of the mall is relaxing area to set and dine by
,,Good.,5.0,,"It is a very jam packed mall, full of people due to everything Vivo city has. Cinemas, restraunts, shops, carparks etc. It is full of good activit√©s. But they should make it larger!"
,,Budget Friendly Mall,3.0,,"When you traveling with tight budget, Vivo could offer you a warm embrace. Cheap foodcourt, easy access to MRT and Sentosa Island (via boardwalk). Also good choice for those who came to Singapore by ferry boat."
,,Best & Favorite Mall in Singapore,5.0,,Its the best mall in Singapore which attract many tourists of Singapore. Don't miss to visit here on your way to Sentosa.
,,A Great Mall - except from the fact that it's jam-packed!,5.0,,"A great mall in Singapore, it is even one of the best! Very lively, and some good shops! Only one problem - it's jampacked!"
,,A great shopping centre and tourist hub,5.0,,"Not only does this amazing shopping centre house a huge array of shops it is also the starting point of Sentosa Island adventures, Cruise terminal as well as having connection to the main city of Singapore via Buses and MRT (underground train).

The shops have very western prices so might not be the bargain centre of Singapore but its a very nice place to go shopping for the day or to enjoy some great food. There are even places where one can have fish clean ones feet and a huge roof top deck great for photo opportunities or lazing on the grass to relax.

A novel way to keep the building cool is by having large shallow pools on the roof. The kids can ride little paddle boats in them or splash about in the water...not for swimming but a nice way to cool down none the less."
,,Amazing mall,5.0,,"Its so big i never seen this type of huge mall in india, its to huge i think 8 floor building metro connected direct inside the mall, ferry service to indonesia custom, immigration, office inside the mall its so big i can't tell you."
,,Very large mall,4.0,,A great relaxing way to stroll around the shops after spending a day on Sentosa. Lots of great shops and places to eat. Very clean and easy to get around. Access to MTR is easy.
,,busy shopping centre,5.0,,"We briefly entered this busy shopping centre on our way to Sentosa Island, Ive actually never seen as many people in the same place out for shopping. It is easy to get to by MRT and it is also serviced by a bus interchange"
,,Favourite Singapore Mall,5.0,,"This is my favourite Singapore mall. While many people say that a majority of the malls in Singapore ""are similar"" because of the same shops appearing all over the place, Vivo stands out for these reasons:

1. Outside city areas - hence no ERP
2. Easily accessible by MRT
3. Good place to chill out before or after a visit to Sentosa
4. Huge and spacious, with a very nice 3rd floor open air area
5. A very good loyalty program for motorists"
,,Huge clean mall,4.0,,"Really nice Mall with all sorts of shops to chose from. Not just designer ones but high street store including UK ones such as Mothercate, Marks & Spencers and Topshop.
Great place on a hot or wet day as enough to see and keep you occupied."
,,"Regular mall, but HUGE & good food !",3.0,,Nice restaurants to enjoy lunch / dinner outings with friends. Good view. Well it's a mini-city within the city country - justifies the name well !
,,Good variety of shops,4.0,,"Modern, clean shopping centre. Great views to Sentosa from boardwalk. Lots of different eateries. Shops standard Singapore prices."
,,Disappointed,2.0,,I was expecting a lot from this shopping centre based on reviews and I was extremely disappointed. It's an average size centre but there is not much in there and was confusing to get around. Don't waste your time travelling there.
,,Fabulous giant shopping mall,4.0,,"Right opposite Santosa island, you can get the monorail inside to Santosa for the princely sum of 4 Singapore dollars. In the basement are number of restaurants. A variety of foods. My husband and I preferred the food hall on floor B2 which was unusual as it was mainly authentic foods which was very reasonable approx 9sd for a meal.we eat extremely well here."
,,Perfect Size Of A Shopping Mall,5.0,,"I normally hit Vivo City en route to Sentosa Island. I normally go there for the food, There is a food court on the top floor of the shopping mall, offering a wide variety of local Singapore street food. It's not cheap but certainly worth the try. If you are a shopaholic, it's also a fabulous place to shop for all the items that you need. After all, it is the largest shopping mall in Singapore."
,,It has a beach on the roof,5.0,,"This mall is my fave in Singapore. Lots of great stores, Lots of great places to eat and it has a beach on the roof with lots of little beachy activities to do there."
,,it's huge!,5.0,,"vivo city is literaly the gate of singapore since its near the harbour front checkpoint. the first mall you see in singapore is this huge mall. it has long range of option for shopping and food. it also a monorail station to access sentosa island.
try to spend your time in the rooftop terrace near the foor court. you could see the sentosa siland and cable car from this place."
,,"big, crowded",3.0,,"As one local senior citizen singaporean pointed out in one of my smrt rides, vivo city is the biggest mall in singapore and it is also expected to be crowded because it is next to, if not a gateway to sentosa island. Being the biggest mall, ceilings are considered low (for me), and the corridors especially on the upper floors are not wide enough to accomodate the malling public. It has a lot of options both shopping and food, but I dont think this is enough to justify deliberately going to vivo city because there are shopping malls scattered all over singapore. But for the one time tourist to Singapore, it will be a good way to go and finish it from your bucket list."
,,Great Mall,5.0,,"Vivo City was easy to find and to negotiate around, a great selection of food, clothing, and general shopping. a great hub for the monorail to Sentosa Island and the MRT system"
,,Enormous shopping mall!,4.0,,Everything you want in 1 place! Al brands available so shop till you drop! Next to that really good restaurants and a food court with all small food stall's where you can enjoy all the different kinds of cuisine.
,,"well if you have little time , go vivo city mall",4.0,,"having a hundreds of shoping brands and resturant , snacks corner , always rushy , filled with tourist , especially on weekend crowdy , having mrt station , easily connected ,"
,,This is MEGA,4.0,,"This is a MEGA Mall in its true sense, and like most mega mall its very difficult to find your way around.The location is excellent, just opposite of Santosa, you can wlak across to santosa from here. The mall itself is buzzing and has variety of good choice, Its pricey but still affordable.Its a must see place for shopaholics.
You can also have some excellent views from the riverside of this mall, which is very cool."
,,A labyrinth!,2.0,,"Trying to get from Harbourfront Station to the Sentosa Express was like trying to navigate through a labyrinth. The lack of helpful signs indicates a very poor attitude towards tourists. I ended up on the 3rd floor where the Sentosa station was supposed to be, but had to return to the first floor and start looking again. It took me about 45 minutes to find it on a different 3rd floor. Remarkable!!! I am a 72 years old with arthritis and negotiating your maze was no fun! Get your act together, Vivo City!"
,,Huge and with views to boot!,5.0,,"I love Vivo City and every time I come I end up back here for the shopping and the restaurants. I love being able to get all of my shopping done under one roof, not to mention the playground AND the sheer variety of shops. I love it here because she you have had enough, just either drop out into the walk ways and view sentosa and the cable cars and the harbour or grab a beverage at the restaurant and bars available. the staff are super helpful, and after trying a good proportion of the malls in Singapore now (yes the pockets hurt) I still come back here and will continue to do so. My picks are the top level food court for local and cheaper cuisine with a view... and the kids play area to get the frustrations out when Mums dragged them all over the place."
,,The Best Mall to Shop if you've only got a Day!,5.0,,"This mall is probably the best to hit if you are on lilted time - it has all the famous brand names for women, men & children. Has a great food court and a connecting mall too. The best place to shop in a day and shop for the whole family too!"
,,My favourite mall in Singapore,5.0,,"Vivo City is a huge and fairly busy mall, also my favourite mall to go to in Singapore. I'll never get bored of it because it is always up to trend and every time I go there I will be seeing new stuff. It has a pet shop and a gaming arcade at the top floor which is most popular for family fun. also, it has a large cinema and a few playgrounds for children. Another reason why this mall is great is because it is also a station. It is called the Sentosa Station and with Sentosa Express($4 ticket), you can get around Sentosa easily with three stops, Waterfront(Contain Universal and hotels), Imbiah(Contain Sentosa World and Hotels) and Beach(Contain Beach and hotels) Station. This will be the kind of mall you want to go to if you visit Singapore and it won't disappoint you!"
,,Average,3.0,,"I was really disappointed. Same brands as every where else. Just big and fairly souless. I found it a bit boring, not worth the trip out there specifically. Getting a taxi back to the hotle was just a nightmare."
,,Entrance to Sentosa/ USS,3.0,,"This mall is attached to the Harbourfront MRT and is the access point to Sentosa Island/ Universal Studio. The are restaurants inside (Saravana Bhavan if looking for Indian). The mall is quite large, but nothing extraordinary considering there are other big malls in Singapore."
,,Mall in a station,5.0,,"Built above the Harbour front MRT station, Vivo City is a mall / city in itself with multiple levels containing shops and eating joints. You have to access Vivo City to take the sky train to Sentosa island / Universal Studios as well as the piers for the Cruise."
,,Rooftop at Night,4.0,,"It's a nice walk to have at the rooftop level outdoor. It's a nice park. Go in the late afternoon. At night, some of the landmarks are not lit. But it's a nice place to relax and hangout, especially for couples.

They have a good selection of shops and there is a Giant hypermart in the premises too."
,,Multi Purpose Commercial Complex,4.0,,"This review is quite late. The Vivo City is a huge commercial which is housed in a multi-storey building. From here you can take a monorail ride to Sentosa, or opt to walk all the way to Sentosa along the Sentosa Board Walk which starts just outside the building. Likewise, you can do a quick shopping before boarding the ferry boat to Batam Island."
,,Largest shopping mall. wide range and penty of shops.,4.0,,Largest shopping mall. wide range and penty of shops. It is start point to sentosa express and cable car. So you can cover this mall to get the singapore shopping experience.
,,Yet an other large mall,4.0,,"I went to Vivo to catch the monorail to Santoso
and got lost
I do prefer Rafle city where the Swiss and Stanford are easy to find your way around
this is more for the local and expats
So many little shops to
However it a bad mall if you have the time"
,,Huge Shopping City,4.0,,"It's the biggest mall in Singapore full of many shops with different kind Resturant and cafe and is crowded most of the time
The monorail located in the 3rd floor where will took you to Sentosa fun island
The golden village cinema located at second floor
We spent nice time"
,,The biggest Mall,5.0,,Vivo City is easily one of the biggest malls in the world. Its on the way to Sentosa and the Sentosa express and Boardwalk starts from Vivo city mall. There are plenty of shops and kids play areas and the terrace area in the evening offers good view of the Sentosa. Top floor and the basement floor has food courts and the bay side also has good dine in options.
,,It has everything you expect from a shopping mall,4.0,,"We visited vivo city several times on our way to sentosa. It has lots of branded shops and expensive items. But if you really take your time and explore you can find places with reasonable price and good value for money. There are number of sales going on for up to 50% off in certain places. However you need to have a subtantial amount of time to search for it.

Also the food court is fabulous. It has a vast variety of food items ranging from vegetarian to non veg.

The place is usually crowded but it is worth paying a visit. Also in the top floor, there is a small suvenior shop which is very cheap. It has offers like 24 key tags for $10.

So all in all, it is a not a bad idea to have a look through vivo city because you may find something interesting."
,,Expensive and Conmen,2.0,,"We continually got told that we should go shopping at Vivo City..., well we did and we wished we hadn't.
Most of the shops were very expensive or exclusive.
I had a terrible experience with one of the salesmen at the Cannon photo shop who ripped me off terribly knowing I was in a hurry and not paying complete attention.
The upside was the lollyshop, the kids train ride and the kids play areas..., other than that a total waste of time and money.
These shopping centers are targeted at the tourist with ridiculous prices.., if you are bargain shopping, go to lucky Plaza, not as exclusive.., and neither is the price."
,,Shopping!,4.0,,"Vivo City is the largest mall in Singapore. It has a good mix of mainstream stores (forever 21, topshop, etc.), however, I felt it lacked some unique store options.

The food is expensive here so make sure you eat before you come. Also, there is practically no seating in the hallways of the mall so if you get tired from walking the only real option is to sit on the outdoor staircase facing Sentosa.

In summary:
Big mall with lot's of stores."
,,Best Mall out of Orchard,5.0,,Huge mall so close to Sentosa! You literally will find everything here from food.. to movies.. to shopping! Not to be missed!
,,A big mall,4.0,,"This big mall have everything you need. My favorite part in this mall is ""Food Republic"", a food court that have lots of food and beverages. You can also buy tickets to any attractions at Sentosa Island."
,,Vibrant but enormous,3.0,,Vivo City is bigger than big. It's so hard to get your head around. We arrived on the MRT (train) which is so easy but confronted with Sunday crowds going to Santosa we just turned around and left. We probably didn't do it justice but we found it too overwhelming on this crowded Sunday. We preferred Orchard ION or Marina Bay Sands. Same shops and great Foodhall but easier to remember where you are.
,,One of the best Shopping Malls in Singapore.,5.0,,"Everytime I visit Singapore I always visit Vivo City. It's the largest shopping mall in Singapore, lots of variety of shops and restaurants and you can't really get lost despite the size of the mall. It's close to Sentosa Island and it's easy to get to by the MRT, via the HarbourFront MRT Station on the Purple North East and the Yellow Circle Line."
,,Big Shopping Centre at Habourfront Area,3.0,,This is one of the big shopping malls in Singapore at the Harbourfront area. Has all the typical shops within the building. The design is bright with a lot of natural light. Has outdoor area to view towards the Sentosa Island.
,,Vivo City Basement Food Court (For Tourists),3.0,,"If you are a tourist in Singapore and are looking to experience the famous Singapore street food (or so-called hawker food), in air-conditioned comfort, the Vivo City Food court located at the basement is the place to be. You will see all kinds of cuisine - Chinese, Indonesia , Malay, Indian, Straits, etc. at affordable prices.

But beware, not all stalls are good and honest. I am motivated to write a review about Stall No. 6 (see photo). The food servers are rude (I think they are from China), and I think they are dishonest. I ordered the herbal black chicken soup (it looked good in the pictures). What I got is a miniscule piece of chicken meat (all bones) and no veggiws in the soup qhixj tasted sort of herbal but not savory. For the price I paif, I felt cheated. But this should not discourage you from trying out the other stalls.

Avoid stall no. 6 like a plague."
,,Good shopping,5.0,,"Good place to buy souvenir for friends and family. Food court is also yummy... dont get surprise to see eldery man or women serving you. I love watching them, they look happy end enjoying their woork.

View is awesome too... if you feel hot. Deep your feet at 3 floor if im not wrong there is pool as deep as your angkle."
,,The biggets mall in Singapore,4.0,,"Nice mall, but not for western people. Obviously the price from products we have in America no COMPARISON. I went on sunday so u cant walk a lof of people, looooooooooooot. U can take the monorail and the cable cars from Vivo."
,,It's a shopping mall,3.0,,What do you really want me to say? It's a shopping mall. The air conditioning is really good. The prices will rape your wallet. But you get what you get and you don't get upset!
,,Big Mall! Great Brands,5.0,,"A wonderful mall with the Sentosa and Harbour front walk way in the backyard. The mall has big brands and makes a great place to shop for. It is also connected to Food Republic which offers you a array of Asian, Chinese and Indian food. The mall is a wonderful place to spend some time and get insights into the Singapore society and way of life. The Giant / Vivo Supermarket offers wide range of products for home shopping. Great place to be at."
,,Full,5.0,,"Mall with all the important branches, full of people. Very good connected. Has 2 supermarket. Much restaurants. Metro stop, terminal ferry to batam (indonesia)"
,,Black society from Hong Kong? Restaurant,5.0,,"A restaurant that suprise me . there are lots of restaurants in Vivo city .shops,department store.it takes also a day to walk around.I love Hong Kong food, Local food. The special name attract me to try. The design is good and the price is fair. Salad with soya egg.dim sum.and vegeterian food must try.seafood looks good but I am vegeterian so can't try .
after lunch .i walk to the ferry terminal link to Vivo buy a ticket go to Batam which is a small island of Indonesia ...great shopping area.things are cheap massage only half price of Singapore about S$20
.if interest to stay overnight -bought package when you purchase ticket.but be careful of pick pocket.lady must have partner, dont walk at night.

hope you enjoy it
Singapore weather is cool and a little raining.but it is to safe ,lady can walk along alone at night .great to travel on yourself .convenient and cheap public transport. most people speak both English and Chinese.and some can speak 4 language.

now is mid autumn festival.time for you to buy some moon cake home (dessert with lotus seed plaster and salty egg yolk)"
,,Nice mall,5.0,,"Another big shopping mall in Singapore, loads of shops, restaurants to choose from. You can get to Sentosa island from Vivo."
,,Always crowded,4.0,,"Vivo City was a nice place to hang out, walk around, shop, play and dine. However, as Harbourfront MRT station was right under it and the express monorail to Sentosa took it as its primary hub, it was always packed with people. Those who are looking for a shopping mall with less people should be carefully consider to visit Vivo City."
,,A mega mall,5.0,,A place where you can stopover for an aircon place after a hot day trip to sentosa which is just a Milestone away Many shops and restaurants around
,,Great air-conditioned shopping mall.,4.0,,"It is a very good destination for shopaholics. There is a huge variety of shops. Besides that, the restaurants are not too bad. Another reason to come here is to take the very efficient mono-rail to take to Sentosa. The last reason to possibly come here is to collect ""pokemon""."
,,Large mall and great view,5.0,,This mall is full of shops and restaurants. People can enjoy shopping and eating in one place. Great view of harbor and Sentosa especially evening to night.
,,Lots of shopping,4.0,,Vivo city is really big and full of shops and restaurants. It is just outside harbor front mrt. The sentosa express is also available here.
,,Nice place to shop,4.0,,"If you had a wander down Orchid Rd you would have been amazed at the number of high end brand stores. Great to look at but way out of our price range. Then there's Envivo City, I could afford stuff here-a lovely clean shopping centre. We also ate a place called LeNu, a Taiwanese beef noodle house. This place has fantastic food at a great price."
,,Under one roof,5.0,,"My 2nd visit to Vivo City didn't disappoint. As expected, enjoyed shopping here - a special treat was the sale at one of my favorite shops: over 50% off! Essentially all the shops that I'd like to visit can be found here, all under one roof. Can be crowded, as it's popular place to visit for families and friends, especially those who have visited Sentosa."
,,Pokemon hunting all over the place.,4.0,,"We were there and reach with the nice magnetic train from Sentosa. We reach in this big mall who have pretty much everything spa / brand shop/ food court / view of the river / cruise departing!
What was very strange was all this young and old people that was hunting Pokemon everywhere in the mall but apparently this is common in Singapore. Just be careful if you come from a place where you not use to this and you saw people running in one way you could think there is a terrorist attack but not at all a Pokemon rare should have pop out in the mall.

But the mall was very nice.
Pierre."
,,Always too crowded,2.0,,"I've been here on many occasions and I'm always left with the impression of how crowded it is. More recently I try to avoid it as I generally don't like really crowded places. Of course there's a huge selection of the usual generic shops and eating establishments, but these come with the associated cost of the hordes of people everywhere."
,,"huge, modern and clean",5.0,,"huge mall with many restaurants and a direct access to mrt. restaurants, electronic shops, department stores, fashion outlets. one of my two favorite shopping experiences in singapore."
,,Best air-conditioned place to catch Pokemon! (As of Aug 2016),5.0,,"With the horrible haze these days, it's just so hard to go outdoors to catch Pokemon. I'm so glad I found Vivo City. The centre area has 4 poke stops with lures almost all the time. There's a few other poke stops at the corner. In the few hours we spent there, we caught enough magikarps to evolve into a gyarados. There's also quite a few Dratinis that appeared.

Best of all, there's thousands (i'm not kidding) of other Pokemon players around you! I followed a mob running through the mall, and caught a gyarados together with them."
,,"Good place for kids, confusing like a maze",3.0,,"Vivo city has nice playground for kids, it even offers a water pool on 3rd floor which my baby girl enjoys so much. I normally come here to let her play. Other than that, if you're interested in household items you may find Daiso at Level 3 or the shop at B2 quite interesting.
Cons: this shopping mall is so confusing that I'm always lost, after 5 years coming there. The layout is scatter, signs are poor. I wanted to go B2 and after making a big round at Level 1, I still couldnt find any escalator that lead to B2 instead of car park. Besides, it is quite pricey here, given not many special items."
,,Largest Mall,4.0,,I guess Vivo City Mall is the largest Mall in Singapore. The top floor has an monorail station which will take you to Sentosa island.
,,Gateway to Sentosa Island.,3.0,,"This is one of the largest shopping centres in Singapore, which makes it very very busy as it is also the gateway to get over to Sentosa Island with all its attractions. I personally would say that there are a lot of better shopping centres in Singapore that offer a much less crowed array of shops.
If you are going to Sentosa then yes stop have a look around. They offer a lot of eating experiences in the basement and a large food court at the Sentosa express station on level 3.
If it is shops that you disire then head to Orchard road where your itch will be scratched 10 fold.
Top Tip. Take a big wallet."
,,Large modern shopping centre,4.0,,"Huge shopping centre with all the shops you could need. The best fun was visiting the local supermarket for a local view. It's big and you can get lost easily so take plenty of time to explore. For some authentic local food try ""food republic"", it's on the top floor. It's cheap and fun. It's a whole stack of market stalls. It's soooo much better than a regular shopping mall food outlet."
,,Good place to shop,3.0,,"located at harbourfront station, if coming by MRT you can enter directly into this mall. provides access to Sentosa mono rail and cable car"
,,"Loads of shops, plenty of eating placed",4.0,,"A good day out. Loads to see and plenty of places to eat and drink. Attached to Harbour Front that has even more shopping. Big 'Giant' for weekly shop. Cinema complex with multiple screens.
It's just down the road for us so we frequent for various reasons, in addition to those previously mentioned."
,,A very relaxing and wonderful place to take in the sights and some shopping,5.0,,"The Center has a long promenade adjacent to the jetties where we saw a P&O cruise liner docked. The variety of eatery along the promenade caters to all tastes ( Local Chinese, Thai and European). There are shaded seating spots too.

One can walk across to Sentosa (15 minutes at most) or take the mono rail.

I am sure it will be an enjoyable day."
,,Free train to sentosa,3.0,,We went to Sentosa first and took the free train to Vivo for lunch. Food court in Vivo was quite big and has lots of local food. The mall is very big and has lots of shops. Affordable and good for shoppers who wants a bit of everything.
,,Not just for shopping,5.0,,"While the shoppers in our group had a great time with the variety and quality of the products on offer, others loved the variety of food.

As well as the usual outlets you would expect in Ireland and the UK there were some great local eating houses specialising in local street food.

Very impressive tech offers but I couldnt find any bargains as things were quite pricey compared with home. That said the quality of the products was fantastic.

Well worth a visit and there is a free shuttle bus from Sentosa."
,,Great shopping centre,4.0,,"We went here because we got off the Harbourfront MRT and had to board the sentosa express.

The food court on the ground floor was great, many options including halal and non- halal, as well as veg options. Prices were okay too.

The usual kind of shops you would get in a mall."
,,A great shopping mall,5.0,,"A huge mall with all conceivable brands, you can find them here. Fronting the narrow waterways across from Sentosa. Great location to rest n relax whether you are going or coming from a day in Sentosa. Many eateries, again what you can think of,, they have it here. Golden village cinemas also located within its premises with a hyper market. You can spend a day here. Only downside, the Republic food court championing local hawker food is way too expensive. You might as well done in one of the many other restaurants in the mall. I frequent thus place at least once a month. Good for tourists."
,,Great shopping mall,4.0,,"This shopping mall is superb but the only thing that is frustrating is that it is near Sentosa which means it is quite far from the city

Shopping:
The shopping mall is quite huge with lots of different options for shopping
They need to have more shops like video games in the ground floor"
,,Vivo shop,4.0,,"Vivo city is located at the Harbour front and just across from Sentosa. It can be accessed by cable car and the MRT.
It is the biggest shopping centre in Singapore and it would be the equivalent of a Westfield's in Sydney just on a bigger scale. The shopping ranges from cheap to luxury. It's big so be prepared to burn some calories.
There are familiar fast food places for westerners and an abundance of local cuisine. There are plenty of places to eat and grab a coffee.
For Australian's, you will see many familiar shops such as Cotton on, factorie, tempt, typo, H&M, Zara to name a few. There is Tangs which seems to be similar to David Jones.
Due to its location, you can visit the water front shops or go for a walk along the boardwalk by the sea.

There is something for the whole family."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Probably one of the best malls in Singapore where you can have affordable shopping experience (Tangs for apparels and Japanese firm Daiso for other stuff), if you are looking for great dining experience there is Food Republic which offers a variety of mouth watering delicacies. Also not to forget, You have a monorail link from vevo city to sentosa island. All yoh have to do to get to vevo city is to get down at Harbour front MRT and take an exit towards vevo city mall."
,,All in one place.,4.0,,"Shopping and eating are pretty much the top 2 primary aspects of a tourist visit to Singapore. Vivo City has both. It is large enough with plenty of food choices and variety of shopping needs catering to all ages. Vivo City is located just across from Sentosa and is served by the train services, making it a logical destination for those done with Sentosa and wanting some air condiitioned place to relax, eat and shop."
,,another shopping plaza,3.0,,"Vivocity is another big Plaza. There are hundreds of these Plazas all around Singapore. Vivocity includes the ferry to Batam (Indonesia). So the place is a bit more busy. But otherwise it is the usual collection of shops. The one thing, as a vegetarian, I enjoyed is the excellent vegetarian foodstall in the foodcourt. The food was really 3 star. Try it, even non vegetarians will like it!!"
,,Great mall,5.0,,Have various ranges of shops and restaurants. Hobbies stores too. Near the Seaport as well. MRT access is also good.
,,Great place to visit and shop,5.0,,"We stay on Sentosa Island at least once a year, so we have visited quite a few shopping centres, Vivo City is my favourite, its ranges from cheap to expensive so has a wide range of stores and a great variety of restaurants, also great access to trains, buses, taxis and walking distance to Sentosa, I highly recommend."

,,Biggest shopping centre in Singapore,4.0,,"Used to work in Habourfront area, so visit this place very frequently. Vivo city is link up with habourfront shopping centre. The shopping cente is huge, great selection of shops and even recently even the carpark area is also being converted into shopping areas, that will make the shopping experience even better. At the 3rd floor of the shopping centre, you can either take monorail to Sentosa or you can goes to the outdoor area, there is a big water pond where by you can indulge your leg to cool down in this hot weather and the top always boast a great view overseeing sentosa."
,,Huge,5.0,,This mall just goes on and on and on... Great selection of shops and places to eat. I found some amazing Japanese style toys for my kids as souvenirs and had a very nice dinner from TCC. I considered seeing a movie but the timing wasn't right. Just enjoyed seeing all the people and the water area for the kids on the top level.
,,Very good shopping Centre,5.0,,"This shopping Centre is filled with lots of shops and restaurants that are able to make you spend at least half the day there, especially when just beside it is Habourfront Centre. You can get a good view of Sentosa at the highest level sky park."
,,Not very impressed!,2.0,,This mall is near the harbourfront centre which is a more attractive mall...not many different kinds of shopping stores available!
,,best mall in singapore,5.0,,"the best mall is singapore. so friendly lots of things to do and great eats, we went to the movies and watched dory that was fun. we travelled far to other malls and just wasted our time, you have it all here...."
,,Sunday Brunch at Vivo City,4.0,,"I arrived at 11am, having not yet had breakfast. The MRT deposits you at level B2, and as you exit the station and walk in to Vivo there is a large food court on the right.

Keep walking straight past MacDonalds, well you would anyway, wouldn't you?

Head to the far left-hand corner where the penultimate food stand is a guy selling noodles and soup. I paid less than S$8 for a large bowel of delicious noodles with beef, and a bowl of soup with a couple of meatballs.

The noodles either come 'dry' or 'wet'. The dry version is with a thick, meaty sauce. The wet version has more of the soup pored over it. I went for the 'dry' version. Absolutely wonderful."
,,GIGANTIC MALL,4.0,,"One of, perhaps the largest, malls in Souteast Asia when it opened. Vivo City is an attraction in itself. Aside from the obvious shopping and dining you have great views of the Singapore waterfront and Sentosa Island."
,,Huge selection of restaurants and great stores,4.0,,"Vivo hosts easily more than 50+ restaurants and the selections of different types of cuisine is amazing, much better than what I saw in Europe. The selections of stores is also very good with most major retailers present. The mall can accomodate huge crowds without beeing too crowded, which is a plus. Also, has a great connectins to MRT."
,,Second best shopping mall in Singapore,4.0,,"I say second because its location, number of brands and building type , other wise it has a large number of good brands that is affordable for the mid-range buyers , also it has best restaurants if you compare it with the other malls , view from front restaurants is perfect , the fact that harbor front (mrt) station is located under it is giving it another advantage , I really recommend it ( try to visit it the same day you want to ride the promenade cable car )"
,,Pleasant surprise for weekend....,5.0,,"We visited the city mall on Friday and Saturday and we also got a discount cum promo which lasts for hardly 30-50 minutes also,you can get 20-25% discount on market priice, rerely seen in other malls,Good shops of electronics."
,,Quick Visit,4.0,,"Always have a quick visit for few hours since this one a must transit place to/from Sentosa island. Typical mall with various brands and shops. Good stop for dinner after a long day fun activities in Sentosa (Universal, Mdm Tusaud, Casino, Sea World an several others places)."
,,Way too commercialised although the food court was ok,3.0,,"When our plane landed in Singapore at 6am, this was our only option for a local breakfast at 8:30am. Half the eateries inside the food court was opened. Toilets are clean and located close to the eatery. Taxi queue was quick, although on the day we left which was approx 7pm, the taxi queue was really long and no one really around to help as a lot of queue jumpers (locals presumably) were hailing the taxis or calling for taxis before they arrived at the head of the queue. This place I found also had a lot of the usual overseas brands from Australia. Nothing really amazing. Some water park on the roof which I would not recommend, looked dirty with random people taking off their shoes and soaking or cleaning their feet in the water. Yuck!"
,,Very nice,5.0,,"I went to vivo city with my family as we wanted to take the monorail to sentosa, however we ended up spending more time there than we actually expected! For little ones, there is a shallow pool like area on the roof so it is very fun!"

It had a small craft market on the day we visited.
This one is closet to sentosa and can be reached from there on the monorail and by walking walking along tbe boardwalk.
To get to sentosa express you have to walk through it and up the escalators to level 3.
The MRT which serves it is Harbour front."
,,Huge Mall and Close by to Sentosa!,4.0,,"This huge mall is filled with shops and when I say its huge.. its huge!

It doesn't open until 10am however the selection of shops covers all the big chains (H&M, Zara, Uniqlo etc) and also has a supermarket to pick up some affordable snacks and even beer/wine. Vivo City offers air-conditioned relief in between seeing the sights. By the afternoon (we were there on a Sunday) it was extremely busy so be sure to keep little ones close."
,,"A very large, very nice mall!",4.0,,"This mall is very big and very nice and really has just about everything you could want in a mall. Being on the harbourfront in Singapore it is a little on the expensive side but it's still worth the visit. If you take the subway to Harbourfront Station you can exit to the ground floor of this mall and if you turn right on the ground floor there's a very large Asian food court. On the top two levels there's a large outdoor deck area with views of the Harbour and Sentosa Island. Also, you can buy tickets on the top level of the mall for Universal Studios and Sentosa. You can also purchase a ticket here for the monorail across to these theme parks, or instead just walk across the bridge (about 15 minutes walk)."
,,Great Shopping Mall with great features!!!,5.0,,"Been twice here and I love to play water at the sky park the most!!! You can access the monorail to Sentosa at the very top floor also, if you're lucky then there will be any cute standee figures on the top floor ^^"

Do visit if reasonable stuff shopping is on ur list
Has brands like innisfree, skechers, m&s, Mac etc!"
,,Worth popping into when going to Sentosa,4.0,,"It's just a standard mall which has a good variety of shops and restaurants.Found it a really maze to get round though. A lot of the signs where wrong which was very confusing. Wasn't too impressed by the ""park"" or the kids area. The boardwalk is nice and good way to get to Sentosa Island."
,,Massive shopping centre for all wallets,5.0,,"This is a shopping centre like any other the world over. What makes this one different I guess is that from one end you can walk down along path to get to Sentosa island. The shopping centre also covers all types of budgets with high end shops in one part of the centre and a low end market stall type section at another. It also leads with a bit of a walk to the Fort Harbour port, and cable car,.........so check it out if you like shopping or want somewhere to eat and use as a base before going to Sentosa."

,,A hub and a mall,4.0,,It is the hub to Sentosa using cable car or monorail. It is also the hub to Faber Peak using cable car. It has marina for cruises and boats to Batam. The mall itself is very long and big. It has movie theater and aot of dining options.
,,Best of both plus more,5.0,,"If you enjoy shopping, eating, drinking and sight seeing then this is the place for you as it has it all.

,,A Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,There is not much more to say than what has been said by other reviewers. If you want to shop in Singapore then Vivo City is a very good choice. The place is enormous with just about every type of shop imaginable. Located across the water from Sentosa Island and easily accessed by MRT (Harbourside) or taxi this complex is likely to satisfy the needs of most shoppers. One of the best super malls I gave been to across Asia.
,,Large mall,5.0,,"Went into the mall with the Mrs and we walked from shop to shop for hours with no end in sight. The name says it all.. Vivo CITY, it literally is a city.. Word of warning.. Enter at your own peril looking forward to emptying your wallet. .. You will end up buying something.."
,,Something for everyone here,5.0,,"This mall was a 5 minute stroll from my Singapore workplace whilst contracting there.

There is everything at your finger tips plus a cruise terminal should you wish to cruise into the sunset.

Cold Storage - a small supermarket proved a great place to keep me in supper essentials, and I found a great nail salon (The Cove) and many other useful shops and restaurants to keep me entertained for four weeks worth of lunch hours!

Loved this place."

,,VIVO City A large shopping complex and the start of TheSentosa Board Walk,4.0,,"Vivo City - a busy shopping mall that is ideal for a rainy day. The Mall is air conditioned with some interesting shops.
One shop ""Daiso"" is The Japanese 2$ shop (¬£1) everything is 2$ - china, glass, stationery and filing boxes, soft toys, artist materials, the pastels 18 colours, are quite good. Kitchen ware, sun glasses, glass cases, adhesive labels and adhesives garden goods, cleaning materials, plastic storage boxes. If you enjoy browsing it is worth a visit. On the floor directly below, you can visit The Fish Co. and enjoy a Soup, 2 fillets of battered Fish and Chips, plus a drink for ¬£8.50. (S$17.00) Very good value.
After browsing and eating fattening Fish and Chips, take a walk to the other end of the Shopping Mall and on Level 2 walk along the Sentosa Board Walk for a 1/2 mile. A very pleasing walk."
,,Vivo City ... The ultimate shopping destination,5.0,,"Every visit to Singapore has to end with shopping at Vivo City. It's connected with the Harbour Front MRT. It's the most convenient shopping mall with major brands available for all ages. It's a hugh place and it will take you a whole day, or even more if you decide to visit all the shops. There are lots eating joints. It also has a supermarket called Giant. I recommend that if you are shopping for chocolates buy it from Giants and will be much cheaper compared to buying for the chocolate stores."
,,Shops Aplenty,4.0,,I would say one of the biggest shopping complexes in Singapore. Plenty to choose from. Mixture of high end shops and mid range. Worth a visit. Long wait at taxi rank to get back to hotel.
,,All you need is here,5.0,,"I never thought that Vivo City would be my best choice of Singapore's mall. they had everything inside it, from famous brand of clothes store until the best food court at Food Republic. I shop a lot when I went there after enjoy a play time at USS and I really had a great time here. Food Republic also have great food and dont worry about the price, its really reasonable. I also love the store which is sale everything cost 2$. I forgot the store name, but its located at top floor near Timezone. Oh and they have garden with small pool also at top floor. I really love Vivo City!"

,,Super sized shopping mall with great eating places & lovely waterfront views,4.0,,"This mall is huge and until you get used to it, you may find yourself getting lost or walking back on yourself from a place you've just come from! Hehehe! We came here a few times during our stay in Singapore as it was only a few minutes on the train from our hotel and very convenient.

There's a wide range of stores including top name international brands here as well as a really good choice of eating places, cinemas and easy access to Sentosa Island.

The choices for dining vary from cheap & fast food like Carl's Jr to finer dining like Jamie's Italian and everything in-between!! You shouldn't have a problem finding something to tickle your taste buds!!

You should probably allow several hours (3+) just to browse the stores and if you're at Vivo City of an evening, the view over to Sentosa is lovely."
,,A good place to while away a few hours,3.0,,"An enormous shopping mall! Good to wander around if you have nothing better to do. The shops are OK, nothing special, but there are heaps of eating places some of which are quite good. There is also a huge food court on the top floor of the complex which services nice hawker style food at a relatively cheap price."
,,Nice shopping mall,5.0,,"Vivo got some of the better places to eat, such as Serenity, The Queen and Mangosteen, Brotzeit and many other, in the evening the view over to Sentosa is fantastic, fireworks or laser/robot show can be viewed after nine. Vivo also have a nice cinema including a gold class theatre. There is a bridge going straight to Sentosa, in the evening its free to enter but daytime there is a small feel"
,,Like any other mall,3.0,,The mall is huge and somewhat confusing we got lost more than a few times and there are multiples of lots of the restaurants so it can make it even more confusing. It doesn't open until 10 which was kind of disappointing if you're trying to get things done early before heading to one of the local tourist attractions.
,,Dr,4.0,,"This is one of the largest shopping mall close to Sentosa on the Harbourfront area.
As with all shopping malls in Spore, it has a wide range of shops. It is connected to the Harbourfront shopping complex which appeared to me to have the cheaper variety of shops and this is also reflected in the choice of eateries but that is not to say the quality is any inferior.
It is on the MRT line and you can also take the monorail to Sentosa from here."
,,Food Republic,5.0,,"Food Republic: We go back to Vivo city and eat our dinner in one of the Hawker center called Food republic. It has a wide selection of food, beverages and desserts ready to fill one‚Äôs stomach at a relatively cheaper price. :)"

,,A shopper's dream come true!,5.0,,"I don't there is anything you cannot find at Vivo City - this massive shopping centre is spread over three stories and has everything you could possibly ever need.

Fabulously modern, Vivo City is conveniently laid-out and even boasts the terminus for the Sentosa Express Monorail that runs to the resort island as well being connected to the HarbourFront Centre that incorporates offices and the Singapore Cruise Terminal.

The shopping centre contains the Golden Village Cinema, a food court in which can be found a number of different cuisine options as well as a huge range of specialty stores and supermarkets, so you'll be sure to find whatever it is you're looking for here."
,,Huge shopping mall,4.0,,Good selection of shops and some good bargains to be had. Clean and spacious as you would expect. We parked the car and got the train to Sentosa before coming back for a bit of retail therapy. I think this is the biggest mall on the island.
,,Modern mall right by the waterfront,3.0,,"You can come here by MTR,even on a rainy day you don,t have to get out

Lots of people activities with young families

The major attraction is the food court in level B2 with excellent food selection and varieties typical Chinese style e.g.authentic beef and pigs body parts

There are lots of shops but somewhat pricey,but is good for an afternoon stroll and enjoy the sunset in the afternoon

It is directly connected to the Cable car station to Sentosa island"

,,Shoppers Delight,5.0,,If you only want to go to one place to shop go here. This has everything you need. Easy to get to by bus. If you have children the Toys R Us is awesome.
,,A shopping mall and more,3.0,,"It is acclaimed to be the largest retail mall in Singapore, by area size, however it just doesn't feel so when inside, may be because of its' unique architecture design, that make it feel more than just a mall. However, true enough, almost everything and any brand could be found here.
It more than just a place to shop but also to dine, to watch movie and to play.
Vivo City also well connected with public transport, a bus stop located exactly in front of the mall and also MRT station just beneath it.
Situated at the Sentosa Island entrance, and well connected with the Island (including few hotels in Sentosa that provide shuttle service e.g. Shangri La, Sofitel) it just complement one stay in the Sentosa Island."
,,"Vivo as in, Alive",4.0,,"The mall is huge; I wonder if all a person needed can be found here. I didn't get a chance to wander around as I only went there as a gateway to Sentosa. Since it is a big mall, expect a high volume of visitors from dinners to shoppers, to Sentosa-goers to what have you. The rooftop of the mall is quite cool, too."
,,What ever you want to buy is here.,5.0,,The amount of shopping here is crazy. This is my wife's favorite shopping destination. They have everything here and more what ever you could want to buy. And its so big it seems like its not busy at all. And what ever you feel like eating its here from fast food to sit in nice resturants.

,,Child friendly mall,5.0,,"This is a lovely family friendly mall with a big playground on the rooftop for children. They have amazing childcare service located at the ""drop off point"" next to the electrical cars (opposite starbucks) if your little one gets overstimulated, he will be pampered there by the lovely crew (always the same people, very trustworthy) with arts and crafts, electrical car rides or just some play time inside. Also loads of children clothing shops, toystores (although toys r us is quite overpriced and has hardly any staff) H&M, great food court etc etc. Lovely way to finish off your visit to sentosa."
,,everything you need and more,4.0,,Great central shopping location. So many shops got lost and tired. Movie theatres when you want to relax and unwind. Every type of food available.
,,"Huge nice mall , linked directly to Sentosa Express monorail (Universal Studio).......",4.0,,"For those going to Universal Studio or other attractions in Sentosa Island , this is the place where you take the Sentosa Express ( monorail train) directly to Sentosa Island. Take the MRT to Vivo City via Harbourfront ( NE or Circle lines).

Vivo City is the biggest retail mall in Singapore. If you have been to Ion Orchard, note this is even bigger. This is very nice,cosy & spacious mall where one can find almost anything expected of a mega mall.

Everything here is extra large- rather it is huge - the shop sizes, the walking aisles between shops, the atrium & the 3rd floor open space garden Skypark too.

There is a huge supermart ( Vivomart), huge electrical/electronic store ( Best Denki), huge department store ( Tangs), huge everything at $2 general store ( Daiso Japan), huge dining options, etc..

The Sentosa Express station is located on the 3rd floor of this mall. It's just up the escalator, on the left.
But take note Sentosa Express is located next to Food Republic food court.

If you ended up on the wrong side where you see a Daiso store instead, no worries. Just follow the signs & walk outside across the Skypark to the other side. It is about a minute walk.

After a long hot day at Sentosa, Vivo City provides a cool comfortable relief for relaxation & dining. And shopping if one still has energy."
,,big place to shop,4.0,,"linked to sentosa island. this would be a wonderful place to shop. they have lots of shops and also restaurant!

,,Dining Shopping Leisure,5.0,,"Come here for Dining, Shopping n Leisure. I call this ""All-in-one"" shopping centre. Great food can be found here, too. Catch a monorail train to Sentosa or just take a scenic walk. Love coming here. Let's go vivocity!"
,,Massive Mall,5.0,,"Largest mall in Singapore,3 floors crammed with shops for all budgets.Plenty of choices for eating and easily accessible to Sentosa Island,well worth a visit."

,,Shopping and entertainment,5.0,,"Densely packed with retail giants, such as Best Denki and Tangs. Very hip selection of clothing and lifestyle gadgets. Massive cinema complex, and if you're bored, you can catch the monorail over to Sentosa. Great dining options as well."
,,Paddang Lezzat (Kopitiam Nasi Padang),3.0,,Kopitiam in Vivocity doesn't have much food options with over rated prices. I recommend the Food Republic on the 3rd flr and the Bagus foodcourt at Harbourfront and the the TuckShop at Harbourfornt is also good place to eat wih reasonable price.
,,Great mall,5.0,,Good mall. Lots of shops from basic to high end. Kind of crowded but that;s normal for a mall. We were here three times our whole vacation in Singapore.
,,Pretty standard mall,4.0,,Pretty standard mall that has the MRT station that leads to Sentosa Island. Has a food court that has a nice laksa that was better than average
,,Rooftop Garden and The Fountain!,4.0,,"Biggest shopping mall in Singapore! You can find almost everything. A place for you to fill your stomach when you are hungry. Favorite spot : rooftop garden and The fountain! Boardwalk to the rooftop, a view not to be missed."
,,Best if on way to sentosa,5.0,,"Vivo city is a huge mall which one has to pass if going/coming to sentosa. Great for shopping or dining (both budget or fine). 3rd floor is a food court where one can try all oriental food (thai, malay, korean, japs etc) and also one south indian restaurant. Please remember, they only take cash and no shop wise dedicated sitting area. It may get crowded during peak times. Vivo city is good for shopping. All brands are available. Enjoy"
,,Food republic,4.0,,"Before and after you go to sentosa, you must pass vivo city to take a cable car, monorail or boardwalk. In 3rd floor, near the monorail station, there are a food court named food republic (cmiiw) and it offer a good food. You can pick a various food ftom thai, malay, indonesia, vietnamese or western. The price relatively fair."
,,On the way to Sentosa,3.0,,Easy to get to via catching MRT to Harbourside station. The shopping complex had a good range of shops including cinema and international food court. Great if on your way to Sentosa.
,,Dekat dengan / Near Harbour Front Ferry Terminal,3.0,,"Ind: Lumayan luas juga, Kadang saya dengan teman lupa jalan kembali ke Harbour Front, Jadi jangan sisa waktu pas2 kembali ke ferry terminal, Ketinggalan kapal -,-""
Eng: Considered wide, Sometimes I and friends forgot the way back to Harbour Front, So don't shop until last minute of your ferry departure time."
,,Good shopping and great food alternative,4.0,,Good shopping mall. With many great looking restaurants. After 2 days of eating at hotels and the atraction area restaurants. We had the best meal there and you could see many locals enjoying the food as well. It is worth the trip just for the food options
,,Good food and shopping destination,4.0,,Vivo City is a good shopping and food destination especially if you just came back from Sentosa. Their food court offers a wide array of cuisines that food lovers will surely enjoy.
,,Great shopping,5.0,,"This is a good shopping centre for tourists and locals, excellent range of shops and has Gold Class Cinema if you wish to rest up for a couple of hours and take in a movie. Good eating choices as well. Not so easy to get a taxi at change of shift in the evening but other times ok."
,,Super Shopping Mall!,4.0,,So many levels here with every type of shop you could think of. All the world wide brands here as well as loads of other more quirky shops. I particularly like all the stalls dotted around the mall. Love the equivalent of Poundland on the top floor. Also great food court up there selling great food at good prices. Down in the basement you will find fabulous a ice cream shop. Always come here when we are in Singapore.
,,Review,3.0,,"This shopping centre is crazy big! There's so much to see. Clothing is great for all ages and there is a wide range of food so everyone is satisfied. I recommend it as a great shopping complex for people going to Singapore, Sentosa"
,,Great Mall,4.0,,One of the best malls in Singapore. Well connected with the skytrain which connects to all the attractions in Sentosa Island.All the brands available. Must visit for all shopping sprees.
,,One of my Favorite shopping mall in SG,4.0,,"Here is the place could give you almost everything in SG. A shopping mall with a view of sea shore, a gateway to connect you with sentosa island, fancy places for chocolate shoppings, branded stuff, dining, everythings. I like this place."
,,Shop till you drop here!,5.0,,"The largest shopping mall in Singapore, you almost need a map! We arrived earlier than most of the locals and had a casual stroll and shop before enjoying a late morning coffee. Once 11am came the local shoppers came out and the centre was packed. A good place to see a range of shops and brands. If you are thinking cheap, this is not the place as this and many shops in Singapore are aimed at the higher end of the market."
,,Shops! Shops! Shops!,4.0,,"We stumbled upon Vivi City on the way to Sentosa Island.
There are so many shops and food to try! It's best to allow a day to walk around and see everything.
There is a rooftop garden which overlooks the city. The MRT station is located below so it's very easy to get to."
,,Nice good Mall,3.0,,Nice good Mall At the Harbourfront The way to Sentosa island Busy in Sunday Every where in shops or restaurants I like to walk around relaxing Taking some pictures
,,Colourful and decorated mall,4.0,,"Its also the transit point for sentosa express that we need to take to go for UNIVERSAL STUDIOS, SEA AQUARIUM , UNDERWATER WORLD etc .. it's just huge and very colorful and a nice place to roam as well..."
,,Excellent shopping centre,4.0,,"Nice to walk around, very big and a lot of different types of shop, and supermarket, it's a one stop shopping , love the shopping"
,,vacation,3.0,,It was a good for passing by necessity shopping on way to universal studio. . nothing out class . H&m was good no rush n some juice shops near sentosa mono rail were good .
,,Vibrant mall,5.0,,"Vivo city was all decorated for Christmas when I visited them
In the third week of December. The mall was beautifully decorated and had several Christmas sales and offers going on. This made the mall all the more charming. Vivo city is host to several international as well as local Singaporean brands. I ended up shopping a lot from the local brands as they have something different to offer in comparison to the usual international labels. This is the differentiating factor of this mall. The local brands are very well priced and are of excellent quality. Besides the amazing shopping, vivo city also has some really good eateries. From local Asian cuisine to international chains like max brenner, u will find them all! All in all, it's a really good mall to visit."
,,Lovely mall,4.0,,"This mall doubles up as a passage to Sentosa along the harbourfront walk. The mall is huge! There are a lot of eating and shopping options in this mall, with most of the best international brands here. We got pretty good deals in our shopping. Liked it so much that went back the next day!"
,,Great options but crowded,4.0,,"Nice, new shopping complex. Lots to offer for all budgets and a nice big food court for a break in shopping. Go early to avoid he crowds. Also, get a map if you are new to this place as it can seem to be confusing to get around."
,,Vivo City & HarbourFront area - Singapore,5.0,,"Vivocity is one of the biggest malls in Singapore,
It has a Small tram like transport to Sentosa from Level 3 of vivocity.

Its an excellent place because
- So many brands ( everyday as well as some of the premium) under one roof
- All Aircon
- Eating options / Bars/ Coffee
- Amazing view from level 3 where you can just sit with your coffee for hours staring at the water or the sentosa island or just the horizon

Has GV for movies with gold glass as well"
,,"Great shopping and eating destination, but can be supremely crowded",4.0,,"As a mall in a city where malls are abundant and the retail tourism is a major lure, Vivo City stands out as being a very central location:-

- accessible by MRT
- adjacent to a express bus depot
- adjacent to Sentosa Island

Whether you are arriving in Singapore by bus, or coming/going to Sentosa Island, Vivo is a convenient place to shop and dine before/after your trip.

The range of retail outlets here are nothing unique compared to the rest of the city. Most outlets you can find here are also found in the various malls at Orchard Road. The plus point is that all the outlets are under one roof at Vivo as compared to having to visit several smaller malls at Orchard Road.

The F&B outlets are what standout for me as there are restaurants to cater for all budgets and a variety of nationalities (local, asian, south american, western, etc).

Definitely one of my favourite one-stop shopping centres to visit during my trips to Singapore simply for the variety."
,,My staying for 4 days 3 nights 13-09-2012 till 16-09-2012‚Äù,5.0,,"The largest shopping mall in Singapore with more than 300 shops (correct me if I am wrong). Selling good items. Lot of restaurant & Starbucks. From Vivo city, if you want to go to Sentosa & Universal Studio, you have to purchase ticket to go by skytrain which cost S$3.00 for one way but no need to pay for the return trip"
,,Massive Mall with great food court,4.0,,"VivoCity is apparently the largest shopping mall in Singapore, and cant argue with that. It is massive and you will pretty much find any shop you can think off.
We usually stop there to grab a bite to eat, prior to heading over to Sentosa island, - love the Republic Foodcourt upstairs as the food has been consistently good up there and its good value for money.
They also have a mad cake shop on the bottom level where you place your oder via a I pad, and one cake looks more delicious than the other"
,,Massive shopping mall,3.0,,"Big shopping mall with all the usual suspects. Very Western, US-centric shop selection. From the shops I visited, got the impression sizes XXS and XS were the only ones on offer - M is hardly to be found. May have been unlucky."
,,The perfect mall,5.0,,"I have been a regular customer at VivoCity since the day they opened. I cannot be happier there, as they have absolutely everything you need. Fantastic mall!"
,,Positive Experience spoiled by long wait for taxi,3.0,,We stopped by here after a long day at unversal studios. Since it was quite late we decided to take a taxi back to the hotel. This turned out to be a major mistake. We only got a taxi after waiting for one hour. There were many taxis but they were prebooked. Very few came to the taxi stand to serve the queue. Learnt a lesson here.
,,all shop in one place,4.0,,"its big mall, any majority brandeed shop available here.. many food restaurand and there's place for children to play, a deck up to see sunset or sentosa island.. and its connected to harbourfront centre so while waiting for the ferry, better going around here"
,,Great place to shop,5.0,,This is a massive mall with a great range of shops and plenty of eateries. It's easily reached by public transport and you can get the Sentosa express from here too.
,,Typical Mall,3.0,,"Just A&E typical shopping mall really. Granted, it's a really nice, clean mall, but basically it's a lot of shops and eating places. Much like any mall, any where."
,,3 stars mall,3.0,,"The mall is not that crowded, they have like a park on the mall itself which is not that big.. The stores are also not that much if we compare it with malls in Orchard rd."
,,Nice At Night,4.0,,Is a great place to visit at night after spending all day on the Sentosa Island. You can relax and enjoy the atmosphere of the night at Harborfront Port Area. Many eating places that might be quite expensive in the region.
,,A great place to shop,5.0,,Be prepared to spend a whole day here. You can find from high street brands to the high end stuff. Diaper changing stations are located almost everywhere on each floor providing hot water and a sink too. Food places ranges from fast food to light snacks to those serving main meals in all range of prices. You can find all sorts of items here from clothings to electronics to school supplies or even groceries.
,,Good selection of shops from mid-range to higher end brands,4.0,,"VivoCity is a convenient stop for travellers or tourists coming or going from Sentosa Island - most hotels on Sentosa provide complimentary shuttles to VivoCity for their guests' convenience. There's also a train service from VivoCity to Sentosa for those who prefer that mode of transport.

There's a wide variety of shops, from international brands like H&M, Pull & Bear, Topshop, Forever 21, to smaller, local brands selling clothes and knick knacks. Food choices are wide and cater to various budgets - there are restaurants ranging from Jamie Oliver's Italian to McDonald's, and a food court."
,,"Huge mall with some local flavor, fun for a tourist",5.0,,"This review is particularly for tourists. If you don't just frequent the expensive and well-known stores, you are in for a treat. Go downstairs. Take the MRT (subway) to other places like Chinatown, Gardens by the Bay, the National Library, Botanical Gardens, etc. See the huge food court and other food places and bakeries in the aisles. There are many Asian and other foods to overwhelm the senses and attract the eyes. Downstairs there may be more deals to be found, though prices are still higher than I would have liked to see. Walk the entire mall.

Logistics: If you are coming to/from Sentosa Resort, there is a free shuttle bus that takes you to VivoCity often (get the schedule). If you intend to do a round trip, be sure and note where you were dropped off, since that is where you will be picked up later. It wasn't that easy to find, since it is a very big mall. It took me an extra 10 minutes the first time I did this, so allocate extra time so you don't have to wait for the next shuttle (or make a little map so you know where you're going in the mall on the way back)."
,,"Get ready ""for everybody""",3.0,,"Went to Vivo City the 1st time and felt like ""everyone in SG"" was in Vivo City. Definitely a lot of things to do but you also have the crowd. Going home, be prepared for the long taxi line."
,,Good,4.0,,"All ranges of shops and retail outlets can be found here. All kinds of food available. Overall, good experience."
,,Just another Mall..,3.0,,"Not so much comment about this mall, just like any other malls with the exception of the outside area at the L3, a beach like area.. The artworks are pretty lame in that open area. Certainly the mall got more crowd because of link to sentosa, and the SMRT. ."
,,Huge Huge Mall,4.0,,"There is a loottt of shops, and lots of food courts at different levels. You can find almost anything here. Connected to the MRT station Harbour Front, when you exit the MRT you will find a food court at your right. On the 3rd floor you can check the outdoor part facing sentosa island while your children can play mini boat water. And from this floor you can connect to Sentosa Island with MRT which will cost you $4 for round trip."
,,Mall to keep coming back to,5.0,,"This the mall in Singapore I keep coming back even its quiet far from our place. I love the selections of brands in here and its really huge. It has also a little park on it for children to play. Its the mall right opposite to Sentosa island, so if your going to Universal Studio better have some time here to shop."
,,Huge local mall,4.0,,"We were staying with family near Haw Par Villa and so this is their local shopping centre. Massive mall on several floors with middle priced brands and a branch of Tangs (the John Lewis of Singapore!). It also has the Giant supermarket - I have been to large stores in the USA but this took the biscuit! Great shopping and reasonably priced compared to the UK. You can get everything here - and don't miss the two dollar shop on the third floor!
Some nice bars and restaurants overlooking the straight to Sentosa."
,,Huge mall,4.0,,"This is a huge mall that come with lotsa shops and food courts at different levels. You can find literally everything you want at this mall, from groceries to high fashion goods. There are many good restaurants throughout the mall itself. Just a short walk and you will find yourself at the wharf, facing the sea looking at sentosa."
,,Good to see... Good to shop !,4.0,,Many shopping activities for both the old and the young at heart üòâ. Skypark is excellent as it even comes with a water play area which is large and the kids enjoy it ! Also a good gateway for the entrance to Sentosa !
,,Convinient shopping mall,5.0,,I live in singapore so i that i already went to vivo city quit often. It is very convinient because you can go to sentosa fast. Vivo city has great shops. They even have toys r us and smiggles. Yes both of them in one shopping mall....
,,Largest Mall in Singapore with a good selection of shops and restaurants,5.0,,"Although it is not located along a popular shopping belt in Singapore, it is located next to Sentosa and if you dine in one of the restaurants overlooking Sentosa, be prepared to be stunned by the beautiful view, especially the night view. This mall houses really a really good variety of mid budget shops. It is not a luxury mall, neither a shabby mall. 5 stars for cleanliness, 5 stars for layout, 5 stars for making this a one stop mall for all.

It is also home to some of the best collectible toy stores in Singapore, located on Level 2 next to Golden Village Cineplex like Action City for Hot Toys, Funz Centre for Game related products and Simply Toys for everything Hollywood under its roof.

You will also be spoilt for choice when it comes to food. However, you might want to avoid this mall on a weekend and public holiday. It WILL DEFINITELY be crowded during these days."
,,Big and busy!,3.0,,"As title says, large and filled with visitors. Good range of shops, lots of places to eat at. Good to visit if you're on the way to Sentosa."
,,Best shopping mall in Singapore,5.0,,"the biggest shopping mall in Singapore. Can easily catch the MRT to it. Shops galore, shop till you drop dead! It has every store you can think of, high end fashion names, boutique stores, Sephora, Bath and Body Works, sports stores, Daiso (Japan's top brand household store), food courts, Starbucks Coffee and the gateway to Sentosa Island."
,,Sky Park is a MUST!,5.0,,Watch the sunset and the view of the whole Sentosa Island from the Vivo City Skypark. You can also frolic the knee-deep water play area where children can splash. Opening Hours: 10am‚Äì10pm daily How to get there: Take the MRT Yellow Line to Harbourfront Station
,,Just Next Door & easy to get to,4.0,,Vivo City is just next door to our office so frequently visited. The shop choice is probably the same as everywhere but not so boutique. Can easily be reached via the MRT. It has the wonderful Food Republic if you are there at meal times. Has a great clam and safe feel to it.
,,Something for everyone,4.0,,"Really liked this shopping mall. Easy access to public transport. This is the mall for ordinary shoppers. Not all high end brands like in the city centre. Affordable, great variety, a lot of food options & transport makes this mall my favourite. Also access to Sentosa Island transfers."
,,Nice mall with great outdoor concept,5.0,,"We always love to come to this mall when we hit Singapore. There's plenty of food inside.. lot of shops.. and spacious open space around it.
I always love to eat and the food court area.
But this mall is very crowded at the weekend.
It's easy to come here because there is the MRT Station that connect to it. You also can go to Sentosa side by using the monorail from here."
,,"More than Shopping, its where it is located",4.0,,"Two important things to note for Vivo City and why it is so popular. It serves as the main station if you plan to take the Sentosa Express to Sentosa Island or USS. Its on the 2nd floor or something. Secondly, if you come in early from Sentosa after all the fun and games, it gives you the option to enjoy one of its many eateries if you did not find enough variety to eat at Sentosa or maybe it was too expensive. Also, it is a good thing to reach here early and check option for public transportation since Sentosa Express tends to get really crowded, once the shows end.

Otherwise, it is as big a mall as any other in Singapore."
,,A little for everyone,5.0,,"On vacation in Singapore. Lots to do for everyone at Vivo. Movies, food, shopping. Safe for your teens to stroll around by themselves. Can be busy and lots of people escaping the heat and wasting the day. But if you need to be stuck in a mall - this is a good one. Also really conveniently located near Sentosa"
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"Went with my wife to this centre near Sentosa, she went nuts...best centre in Singapore as it has everything you want..."
,,Biggest in Asia but it's not that big,3.0,,It may be the biggest in Asia but it's not that big. Better off to head towards Orchard Road. Has all the run of the mill shops you see everywhere. Nothing special. Easy to get to by MRT
,,"Great Stop, for shops, eats, cablecar, boardwalk ~",5.0,,"There is much to do in VivoCity, it is bright and vibrant with plenty of people walking around. There re well branded shops everywhere and Plenty of nice walks and photo spots from the roof of the building to the boardwalk outside the shopping centre.

The top floor near the Sentosa Ticketing (for cablecar) area had the best Food Republic there, with several types of menus from all over Southeast Asia, cheap eats with many varieties. The boardwalk next to the water is also great and is highly recommended ~"
,,great for shopping,3.0,,"They offer lots of stuff here. I usually go crazy here during sale, and if you're a tourist, you can claim your taxes. Imagine how much you can save. Plus you can travel from here going to Sentosa. Nice view also from the top."
,,Our Favourite!,5.0,,"Definitely our favourite shopping centre during our stay!! Unfortunately we found it late in our trip. It's mid range in shop pricing, not the cheapest or most expensive and has lots & lots of delicious places to eat! There is a water park & playground up the top for the kids & wonderful view of Sentosa! Access via Harbourfront MRT!"
,,Great shopping centre with access to Sentosa,4.0,,"We were told that this is the largest shopping centre in Singapore, and we found there are many varied shops here for all types of shopping. There's lots of eateries here, from food courts to fast food to restaurants.

Great way to spend a couple of hours on the way to or from Sentosa."
,,Just another mall,3.0,,Nothing really special here. If you are already in the area is fine to come for shopping and eating. But if you are not in this area >>> not worth the trip
,,A lot to do here!,5.0,,"The mall looks busy but there are so many activities for families with kids, especially the open playground areas."
,,Massive!!!!,4.0,,"This mall is absolutely massive! Great choice of shops, from top end shopping right down to the basics. We are returning tomorrow to finish the mall and have lunch at the Food Republic food court, it looks fantastic!! If I was to chose one mall in Singapore to visit this would be it."
,,Not as good as Orchard Rd,3.0,,"If you want to shop on the cheaper side then this is a better place to be than Orchard rd, but, this place lacks the vibe and overall impressiveness of Orchard Rd as well. I think there was some refurbishments being done here but overall this was just a mall. In another country it would be rated higher, but in Singapore it falls down against the others."
,,great for dinner place,5.0,,there are so many restaurants so it is recommended for dinner after Sentosa where the restaurants are crazily expensive.
,,Just a mall,3.0,,"It can gets you to Sentosa and that's what it matters. Poor sinalization in the middle of advertising might be good the the advertiser, but it's problematic for the costumer. The mall's map work fine, thou."
,,If you don't enjoy shopping malls you won't enjoy this,3.0,,"Singaporeans are known for their national hobbies of shopping and eating. Vivo city is one place you can get both in great abundance and variety. Even my wife, who enjoys ""shopping"", became somewhat claustrophobic with the crowds, the number of options (including numerous top shelf stores) and the relatively high prices (compared to US). Connected to Sentosa Island and the amusement park atmosphere it is easy to forget the general tranquility and beauty of Singapore."
,,Vivo City - every time!,5.0,,"This is my ultimate shopping mall. Every time I'm in Singapore I head straight to this mall. It's huge. So huge that I always run out of time when visiting. The only downside is that the taxi waiting rank is horrendously long. So do plan to leave much earlier if you have alternative arrangements that require you to actually leave the shopping centre, otherwise you'll be stuck there for a solid hour waiting."
,,"Malls, malls, malls",4.0,,"One of the gazillion malls in Singapore, Vivo City is strategically located where visitors, commuters, residents converge and provide a one-stop shop of sorts for all."
,,shop and sight see,4.0,,"it is a great place to shop with an enormous food court on the top floor. what i discovered on my last day was, you just have to step outside towards the sea and there is a walkway leading to sentosa island. you can also see the theme park across the water from the esplanade."
,,One of my favourite malls in Singapore,5.0,,The side across Sentosa. One of the favourite shopping places in Singapore. As an avid foodie the Food Republic is always the highlight of my trips here. Though I love the roof deck too :)
,,Crowds!!,4.0,,"We were there on a public holiday. Horrendous crowds!! Long queue for taxi. Do not visit on a holiday! otherwise, it should be very nice with lots of shops and restaurants."
,,Huge shopping Mall,4.0,,Vivo City is a huge shopping centre in Singapore down near the waterfront. By MRT you get off at Harbour Front station & the station takes you directly into the complex. Vivo City has everything from upmarket designer shops to bargin areas & any type of restaurant or food hall you fancy. A great place to spend a few hours. All very modern & clean with escalators between levels.
,,Nice place to shop & chill,4.0,,"This is a huge mall opposite Sentosa near the port & just above the Harbourfront MRT. Excellent range of shops with high end expensive brands, mid-level brands, and affordable brands, so something for everyone. We went during the anniversary celebrations & almost every shop had 50-60% discounts! Electronics are not any cheaper here or in Singapore in general but you can find some great deals.

Most of the restaurants are spread on the sides of the mall on every level while there's an open-air food court on the roof top with cuisines from all over Asia. Meal times can be a battle at the restaurants, especially on weekends, so plan to eat earlier or much later. Try for a table near the windows as you can get a view of Sentosa Island.

The roof-top also has water features for kids to splash around. You can also look out across the sea to Sentosa and see the cruise ships that are docked at HarbourFront.
The 3rd level also has the mono-rail which leaves for Sentosa. Use the MRT to get to & depart from this Mall as the taxi queues are too long."
,,vivo city mall,4.0,,"A mall with a good selection of stores, food, and movie theatre to escape the heat for a bit during mid-day. Not worth a trip out of the CBD for itself, but if you are heading to Sentosa or the cruise ship terminal anyway, could be a good distraction.

Check out the branch of local department store, Tang's."
,,Nice mall for shopping,5.0,,easy to get here by Harbourfront mrt station. Huge and clean. Many shops and restaurants. also Cinema. Nice place to spend money
,,Very nice experience,5.0,,"Vivo city is very nice multipurpose mall-cum-stration for monorail that goes to Santosa island. A lot of eateries, all types of cuisines in Food-planet. Very near to SMRT station."
,,best shopping centre we experienced,4.0,,"this one is opposite Sentosa near the port, designed by a famous Japanese architect, has roof top water features, the design of the shops is good large walk ways, modern, clean with a great food republic eatery.

the mono-rail leaves for Sentosa from the 3rd floor well set out.

My only issue is security guards will not allow you to sit on the floor on the Sentosa level floor, it is a huge open area with enough seating for about 10 people, so people want to sit down it could hold 500 seats, please add more seating.

the taxi departure area is terrible 3 times we waited for 45minutes + for a taxi, worst spot in Singapore for taxi, they need an attendant there, the taxi's do not come down to the rank, they sooner wait for a call and pick up customers from the exit doors (100 metres away) so they can collect an extra $3, the taxi's are excellent everywhere else by at Vivo City, please lift your game centre management."
,,Another typical mall in Spore,3.0,,Can be easily reached by MRT. A sizeable mall with plenty of shops inside for all of your shopping needs.
,,Mall gateway to Sentosa,4.0,,The mall where you will take a ride to Sentosa. Very nice big mall where you can find everything you need before you go to Sentosa.
,,"Organized sale , the gateway to Sentosa",4.0,,"Vivo City is big. It is very clean, organized, shoppable and a good mall to spend your money. the 3rd floor is where to take the train to Sentosa, just a short 5-minutes ride and u r there. Sentosa is full of surprises. Vivo City is where to bought our groceries for our 4 day stay."
,,Nice big mall. With everything you need. Connection to Sentosa or Resorts World. Can be crowded.,4.0,,"A very nice big spacious mall. With everything you need. Shopping , dining, pets , electronics, grocery... It's a shoppers paradise. There's also a kids play area, water fun zone and waterfront Boardwalk. There's also a good cinema.
A good place for all in the family or romantic dates. With connection to Sentosa island or harbor front cruise area.
Since it's so connected it can be very crowded. Meal times can be a battle at the restaurants so plan to eat earlier or much later."
,,Swanky shopping for those inclined,4.0,,"The mall is large, modern and very clean. The shopping here is for those who like luxury and well known brands.

I feel it's one of the more pricier malls to shop at in Singapore at all shops, fashion and food alike.

The mall is well placed on the waterfront, with a view and walkway (as well as train ride) to Sentosa Island attractions. For this reason the mall is aimed at tourists, hence the prices that apply here."
,,"Nice, Big Mall",4.0,,"I'll start off by saying that we were staying near Orchard Rd, so by the time we got to Vivo City we'd visited most of malls we wanted to check out on Orchard already. We popped down for a day to at least check it out. It's big and spread out and seems to be kind of attached to another weird little mall and if you cross the invisible line into the ""other"" mall, there were people begging for money. One old lady actually grabbed my arm and tried to pull me back when I shook my head and started walking away, it was really weird because I hadn't seen anyone else begging like that in Singapore. It was near where the gondola thingie goes to Sentosa I think?

There's lots of good stores to pick from, but I found a few of them to be a little smaller than some of the ones we saw on Orchard with less selection (Uniqlo and Superdry come to mind). There's a lot of restaurants in the mall also, but none of them looked that great (we are self-professed food snobs). There are some play areas for kids, but I couldn't tell you much about those, just that they are there.

It's a good spot to shop if you're staying in the area or want to do some shopping on your way to or from Sentosa. But if you're like us and did a lot of shopping on Orchard already, this mall doesn't have much more to offer for a special trip."
,,great mall,4.0,,"lots of shops to look at, lots of food choices, great location, near to Sentosa, convenient as both buses and MRT are available."
,,Huge shopping center...,5.0,,We just came off a hike from Henderson Wave bridge and needed some food and a buy some groceries. Didn't know this mall existed and it was quite a surprise for us how big it was. They have an amazing food court and of course all the shopping you could want. You can take the boardwalk to Sentosa or grab the MRT. Good place to hang out.
,,Nice for shopping,4.0,,"I had luch in a restaurant with a view for the sentosa island, the mall offers many options of good stores for shopping"
,,Plenty of variety,5.0,,"Vivo City is part of the Harbour Front precinct at the southern end of the island. It has many levels of shopping and dining with lots of restaurants. There is plenty for all ages including a rooftop sky park and an open air playground on the 2nd level. Well serviced by the MRT and local buses it is easy to get to. It is really close to Sentosa and all the attractions there too, which can be easily accessed via the connecting mono rail."
,,A perfect mall to shop!,4.0,,"Vivocity mall is a huge mall and it has almost everything you need. This mall is near Harbourfront Station. This mall should be visited post Sentosa visit or post Universal Studios visit. Due to the large space, it never feels crowded.

It has almost all the brands you need to variety of restaurants, all under one roof.

This is indeed one place where all the shopping needs can be finished."
,,vivacious vivo,4.0,,A very airy mall. Lots of space. Does get crowded when universal studios shuts at 7pm. So get to a restaurant before then.
,,"Sprawling mall, where you can shop till you drop!",4.0,,"This mall is located at the entrance to Sentosa.

It's connected to the NorthEast Line and there re many buses that will bring you to its doorstep. So its easily accessible.

You can also hop over to Sentosa via the monorail or buses.

The mall is huge and sprawling and has many amenities: cinema, restaurants, shops selling a a myriad of items - ladies fashion, men's fashion, children, household and more.

Do visit the restaurants on the ground and second floor, where if you sit near the windows, you can enjoy the view of the sea and Sentosa while you dine!

The rooftop is a must-visit. It has a wading pool that's popular with children, and there's an amphitheater and several restaurants.

You can also look out across the sea to Sentosa and see the cruise ships that are docked at HarbourFront Centre."
,,We Found This Mall Handy.,4.0,,"We went here every day of our holiday as we stayed on Sentosa Island and used the mono rail to go in and out of Singapore.
The mono rail enters the shops on the 3rd floor then the (SMRT) subway is in the basement level.
There is heaps of different restaurants here from American fast food to Asian cuisine.
This was more important to us than buying stuff to take home.
Try some of the water front restaurants for a meal at night and enjoy the view.
There is a smoking area at the front of the shops near the bus stop and grassed area."
,,"Big shopping mall, mrt harbour front",3.0,,"Big mall, find anything you want.. near harbour.. It's so hard to get taxi from here, que almost one hour when i get back around 8 pm. Better make a taxi call."
,,"Huge, spacious & beautiful mall with a view of Resorts World Sentosa....",4.0,,"VivoCity is one of the biggest malls here. However, what you find here can mostly be found in most major malls in Orchard Road or Marina Centre area. Resorts World Sentosa can be seen from one side of this mall.

For those going to Sentosa Island or Resorts World/Universal Studios, this is a good place to get yourself equipped with cheap food/drinks as it is much expensive to buy in there.

This is a well designed, spacious and beautiful mall. One of the nicer malls here to shop or just hang around. It is linked directly to Harbour Front MRT station.

On the opposite side of Vivo City is a bus interchange & a food centre, where one can find quite a number of good local food, at 'local' prices. Inexpensive good food. But the food centre can be pretty hot especially around noon time onwards as it is open concept.

Unless you are going to Sentosa Island or its attractions, no point to make a special trip here. As said, what you find here can be found in Orchard Road & Marina Centre malls."
,,Too Big to finish in One Day!,5.0,,"Had visited this mall to buy some dinner, but turned out to gaze around the mall as it had many interesting shops and unfortunately could not finish the mall in the time available. I would visit this mall in a better opportunity with sufficient time."

,,Must visit for every singapore visitor,4.0,,"Went looking for some window and regular shopping.
Couldn't believe that so much is tucked away in this seemingly small looking shopping mall. Even after 5 hrs. could see 50-60%. Range of products at reasonably good cost.
Lots of food court to explore , if you have the right appetite.
Real foodies can have good time."
,,nice place to hang & dine at,4.0,,"Nice decent size mall that suit your needs for a day. Lots of dining options from foodcourt, cafes & restaurants. Has an indoor pay- playground for the young kids, and roof public-playground. Lots of shops to look around too. Keep everyone in the family happy .."
,,My favourite mall in Singapore,5.0,,"What makes me like vivo city a lot is the fact that is made for people with differeny income levels, you can see high end expensive brands, mid-level brands, and affordable brands. most of the restaurants are spread on the sides of the mall on every floor while when you reach Level 3 there are restaurants scattered around the roof gardens. The mall is connected to sentosa island train and ferries that takes you to indonesian islands. In addition to the good range and variety of restaurants, the mall has great apparel/ clothing brands, entertainment options for kids, and golden village cinema. Enjoy and shop till you drop."
,,Shopping Experience,4.0,,"Excellent shopping with large variety, good location with easy access to public transport. Food court has large selection as well"
,,Good spot,4.0,,"Was pleasantly surprised by the choice in this mall. Really was in line with what we would find in a big suburban shopping centre back in Australia. Has the typical brands like Converse, Vans, Nike etc, don't expect any real bargains though as strictly retail . The best shops to me were the three toy and hobby stores up near the cinemas. I wish we had those back home, seeing some nice high end action figure collectables was a nice surprise."
,,The top deck has the best view in the mall,3.0,,"This is dubbed as one of the biggest malls. The architecture is quite impressive. Cable cars to Sentosa is nearby. If you get lucky, there are seasons where there are visiting Dutch ships parked in front that you can hop onto for just a few bucks to snap some photos. Best view in on the top floor of the mall."
,,Lovely huge mall,4.0,,Vivo city is a big lovely mall which is connected by cable cars taxis sentosa rail and mrts. It houses the broadwalk for sentosa. The shopping mall houses many types of luxury brands and has a unique superb outer building shape. Has mc donalds in the underground which is connected to mrts. The broadwalk is in the south corner near the bay area. Ideal place for shopping rich goods.
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"In 2011 when i was in singapore i usally spend my past time in this mall

,,Another shopping mall,4.0,,"Its located at south side of Singapore. It's just the typical shopping mall, just that because its near to Sentosa. There is rail service to take u into sentosa"
,,Everything under one roof!,4.0,,Harbour Front Vivo City is good as a one stop destination for shopping. All brands under one roof (don't expect a bargain deal at every store though). The restaurants on the roof with several small shops for local cuisine are not to be missed.
,,Just another shopping centre,2.0,,These are the same the world over. Nothing different I can't find in Australia. I was really hoping for someone different than the aussie shops but it is just the same. If you love malls then you will like this place but don't expect it to be different from what we have already in Australia.
,,Great place for shopaholics ;),5.0,,"This is paradise for shopping lovers ;) you will find everything from here, low cost shops, asian shops, expensive shops, apothek, big supermarket etc.
There is also much places where to eat! And also if you are not that hungry, you can just grab smoothie, juice, sandwich, coffee, tea...

This is also place where you go, if you want to take sentosa express to the sentosa island or you want to walk there!
If you have any opportunity to go this shopping center on weekdays, please do it! There is too much people on weekend. You just have to push yourself through all people if you want to go some shop :D it is not maybe best feeling ;)"
,,Big shopping mall that has everything you need,5.0,,"Lots of brands, great restaurants, good cenima, great view as It is overlooking sentosa.if ever you visit this mall try this restaurants. You prefer Japanese food, then try to dine @ Shin Kushiya restaurant they are famous for their kushiyaki which is charcoal grilled pork, beef, seafood etc. great food and nice ambience. It is located in second floor. Also try to visit the marche they have great food as well."
,,Compact shopping centre,4.0,,We had arrived at Vivo as the Cruise port terminal adjoins the shopping centre. Usual shops present all designer but did have a smaller version of Tangs Department store. Plenty of restaurants. Not much of a view but easy to get around and all undercover.

,,Big and Luxury Mall in singapore,5.0,,Cool Shopping center.. and you will find this mall connect to the sentosa island... it's great place to rest after a day playing in sentosa island...
,,Popular Shopping Mall near Sentosa,5.0,,"One of our favourite shopping malls in Singapore. The complex is huge, and first-timers sometimes find it quite hard to locate a particular shop or eatery. The architect is the famous Toyo Ito from Japan. VivoCity is joined to the Harbourfront Shopping Center which has an underground train station. It is also well-connected with Sentosa, by the Boardwalk and also a mini-train (Sentosa Express). Giant Supermarket attracts the most shoppers, as it has a very good selection of food items as well as clothings, electrical goods, etc -- at reasonable prices. There are quite a few good Restaurants and Cafes on Level 1 and 2. The Food Courts on Level 3 and Basement 2 are also very popular with locals and tourists."
,,Nice,3.0,,"Its a nice, clean and big mall. Close to Sentosa Island and not very near to the usual local neighborhoods, its a fun place to spend a couple of hours."

,,All in one Mall,3.0,,"We have to go to this mall in order to get to Sentosa, the interchange of MRT also connected to this Mall. Its offer good variety of restaurant too, so we can fuel-up before going to Sentosa. This mall had a National Geographic store before, but its closing up now :("
,,Gateway to Sentosa,5.0,,You need to go to this mall if you want to go to Sentosa island by monorail or take the broadwalk. It is a huge mall with a lot of shopping outlets. It is easy to get here since it is connected to the HarbourFront MRT station. The mall looks great in the evening in lights while waking back from the Sentosa island.
,,Good cheap souvenir at lvl 3 vivo,5.0,,"Been to singapore for the 2nd time n just found it at level 3 vivo city very cheap pushcart infront of toast selling singapore souvenir. 24pieces for $10 very good deal for keychain, and many good items with reasonable price also friendly lady seller.

,,Massive,5.0,,Huge shopping centre with plenty of food options and lots of shops to have a look in very convenient to get to by harbour front MRT
,,Big mall,4.0,,"Vivo City is located at Harbourfront MRT station. This mall is very big with lots of restartuant and clothings store. It's linked with Sentosa with a tram station. However, during weekends the crowd is very huge and sometimes difficult to do shopping. Overall, a nice mall not to be missed."
,,Crowded,3.0,,After Orchard Road and Bugis I think this had just become another mall for me. I found it lacking.. just the same shops all over.. just got very bored Crowded and taxi queue long.
,,Great variety,4.0,,"Lots of options, features both local and popular international brands. Wide range of eating options also, from restaurants to the big food court."
,,Vivo City,4.0,,"Great.
Excellent range of shops, cafes and restaurants.

Electronics are not any cheaper here or in Singapore in general but you can find some great deals.
Picked up some great clothes bargains for both myself and my wife.
Cheap taxi ride to & from our Singapore river hotel the first time.
Discovered the MRT on our last day in Singapore - use this if you are staying near the Singapore River area, Chinatown or Orchard Rd."

Also, this mall serves as a gateway to the Sentosa island and the Universal Studios theme park as the Skytrain departs from here."
,,Nice place to chill out late afternoon.,4.0,,"Probably one of the biggest mall in Singapore? (I'm not too sure). The same place where you can take the sentosa express train (on level 3, just next to food republic food court). On the same level outdoor you can chill out to sentosa island view, with ferries around, the cranes and cable cars. Spent our last afternoon there just before our flight. We were also there two nights before we depart. Had the opportunity to catch the night view which is a pretty sight too.
Alert: for travellers who plan to chillout there before their flight, there's no storage/locker room to keep your luggages. We had to drag ours everywhere we went."
,,Crowded yet spacious,4.0,,"Vivo City is located at Harbour Front MRT...u will pass by this mall when wan to take MRT to Sentosa Island
Maybe tat day is weekends....everywhere inside Vivo City are filled with ppl...feel crowded but the mall here is super huge n very nice to walk around
Alternative place to find food to eat if u dunwan to eat at Sentosa Island (expensive)"
,,Vivotastic,5.0,,Customer service is alive and well at Vivo....great range of affordable shops with sale pricing. Easy to grab a taxi unlike Orchard Road.
,,top city,4.0,,"Vivo City is an imposing part of the country‚Äôs plethora of shopping options, Singapore‚Äôs largest retail and lifestyle destination. Located next to the water across from Sentosa Island, the mall is beautifully set up as an easy-going and fun shopping destination. Wide open spaces to ensure it is full of vitality and energy, and Vivo City is also home to a series of artworks, has an open-air playground for the kids, multi-screen cinema and a rooftop amphitheater.
Vivo city has 140,000 m2 of gross floor area and 97,000 m2 of retail space, its shopping outlets cover everything you‚Äôll ever want, from fashion, books, electronics, sport, lifestyle, fashion and more. And next door is the Harbour front shopping mall with its ferry and cruise terminal, and cable car station for Sentosa.
Across the waterway is Sentosa Island, if you wish to hop over, you have three choice Sentosa Express monorail terminal located at the third floor, walk using the Sentosa Broad walk with its travelator, or take a bus over. The Harbour front MRT is located at the basement level, if you what to get out of the tourist belt, and go where the locals shop i highly endorse a visit."
,,Backward jurassic mall- Just Pass thru here,1.0,,"In this info age where Singapore is known as one of the most modern cities in Asia and the world, it is mind boggling that this entertainment center particularly the retail shops do not have the capability to process payments via credit cards. And the prices here are 20% higher than those in the center of SG so this really is a bummer. Don't shop or eat here."
,,Big Shopping Mall,4.0,,It is one of the biggest shopping mall in Singapore and is linked to Harbourfront mrt station.It also has the sky train to Sentosa at level 3 and there is a link to Harbourfront centre as well.I personally like to go to Toy Outpost at Level 2 as there are many interesting and unique things like accessories with Brands like Cachet Avenue & many more.
,,Good Value,4.0,,"Lots of shops and excellent restaurants and food halls so you can eat at whatever expense you wish. Shop staff very helpful.
Being somewhat mobility impaired, there is a lack of seating around the shops. This was surprising as Singapore seems to get most things right."
,,Best mall in Singapore,5.0,,Great location and easy access with MRT (Harbour Front Station). Like all shops the choice is endless and great movie cinemas (level 2) for a day of relaxing from sightseeing. Food court at B1 and B2 good range and good price.
,,Big malls in singapore,4.0,,Went there with friends on christmas day.. Very hectic and crowded.. This mall is very close from harbour front ans also have access mrt inside the mall. Quite complete for all stores i search for and if you want to go to sentosa island. This the right place to hop to their train link.
,,Shopping with a view,5.0,,"We were staying on Sentosa, and our hotel had a complimentary shuttle bus service to Vivo City, which made it our local shopping mall. In fact it is really two shopping centres in one, as right next door was the older Harbourfront shopping mall with its ferry and cruise terminal, and cable car station for Sentosa. Vivo City's basement houses the Harbourfront MRT, VivoMart giant supermarket, a food hall and numerous eateries. The remaining floors contain various well known, and not so well known, outlets together with various eateries. There is also a multi screen cinema, children's play area, and on the roof a shallow outdoor pool for paddlers with seating areas and views across to Sentosa. The third floor contains the Sentosa Express monorail terminal, but if you wanted to walk to Sentosa you could use the Sentosa Broadwalk with its travelator at the rear of the shopping centre. For those on a budget wishing to eat I would recommend the Bagus food hall on the ground floor of the Harbourfront mall (just as you enter it from Vivo City) were you can get a meal consisting of two steaks, fries and a salad for just ¬£4 or S$8, or more local food for ¬£2 or S$4, but get there early or late as it does get busy at lunch time. This has to be one of the best shopping malls in Singapore because, when you tire of shopping, you can relax on one of the many seats by its sea frontage or on the roof with its views across to Sentosa or the overhead cable cars."
,,average,3.0,,"Large shopping mall ,but nothing special,worth a look if you have time the location stunning,but that's about it"
,,Best shopping mall in Singapore,5.0,,"My daughter and I must have visited Vivo City about 6-7 times during our stay and we still kept finding new sections of the centre. We used it as a base for the MRT and to getting to Sentosa.

The best meals are up on level 3 at the food Republic. Well priced as well.

The terrace on top is great to sit and enjoy the views or in our case watch the NYE fireworks."
,,Shopping hub before entering Sentosa,4.0,,"Visited on Dec 26, 2014. Exit the MRT and joined a huge crowd to the mall. Had brunch at Kopitiam and proceed to Level 3 if you would like to take Sentosa Express Monorail. Otherwise you can walk through Sentosa Broadwalk or take RW8 bus that wiƒ∫l drop you in front of RW Casino. The Mall itself is huge. One of the most complete. Connected to The Cruise Center if you took a cruise here. The Food Republic is on 3rd Floor and offered wide range of food selection. Dont forget to visit the rooftop park with lots of space to explore and unique art decoration, looking at Sentosa."
,,Big Shopping Center & Foodcourt,4.0,,This building is the place you must go if you want to go to Sentosa. The skypax floor has the beautiful view and the big foodcourt. We love eating in this foodcourt because the food is diversified and delicious with reasonable price.
,,Massive,4.0,,"Wow this mall is crazy big. I think this is one of the biggest I've been to and I've done Dubai.
main advice is to keep your friends close cos if you loose any one you will not find them. We had a meeting point so we managed to find everything in the end. But it took us ages.

,,so much shopping you need multiple trips!,5.0,,"there are so many stores it's hard to get your head around the place. I went 3 separate times over as many days and kept finding new places to spend money. Good value, huge selection, something for everybody."
,,Just another mega size mall,3.0,,This mall is not much different from the mega size malls I have visited before in Malaysia. Great for shopping and nothing else. Some of the outdoor areas and public amenities are in need of maintenance.
,,Busy for the holidays,3.0,,I usually like how tourist-friendly Vivo City is but because of the holiday rush it feels like a market place because of the big volume of the crowd. It was also rainy during my latest visit so I didn't get to enjoy the outdoor terrace.
,,Best shopping centre in Singapore,5.0,,"Love Vivo! Everytime we go to Singapore from Australia we come to Vivo. The place is amazing. Food outlets are wonderful. Our favourite is Swenson's with the buffet bar. Shopping wise, we love toys are us and build a bear. But they are lots more of course. Great afternoon out!"
,,HUGE variety of stores (NOT high end only) shopping center,4.0,,"I am not a big shopper. When I shop I am not going to buy anything at the super pricey places although I do like to wander around and see what's happening. In a recent visit to Singapore I felt there were just two options- either the kahCHING BIG $$ stores or the little local jumble of stuff. Then I found Vivo City. It's a huge shopping center with all kinds of food and shopping choices. There's all the usual international stores but there are also lots of food options. From super crowded food courts to nice restaurants.

The big hit for me though was the VIVOMart-GIant located on floors 1 & 2. This is a gigantic supermarket/grocery store that also has clothing/shoes etc...All very reasonably priced. I spent at least an hour there just looking and ended up buying all my little gifts for friends back home.

Viivo City is connected to Harborfront Center which is also a shopping/office complex.

You can get there on the MRT easily.The cable car from Sentosa to Faber Peak stops here."
,,great shopping mall with acces to sentosa island,4.0,,"this is the right place to meet your friends for recreational purposes. From this mall we can get to Uss or sentosa island so easily, by bus, walking or the train. And for all moslem, this mall have a moslem food court named Sedap, so we can get halal food so easily."

,,A great shopping mall,5.0,,"We went this shopping mall mainly to go to Sentosa Island by monorail. Monorail to Sentosa starts from Vivo City shopping mall. After we finished visiting Sentosa, we returned to Vivo City by monorail and we had a stop at Vivo city and had some shopping. This is a good shopping mall with a lot of variety in items and products. All the famous international brands are present in this mall. Vivo City is a good choice of shopping in Singapore."
,,One of the best in singapore,5.0,,Very good shopping mall with all the brand that you might need. It has a big food court with a huge selection of food. Situated next to the merlion and has train connection to Sentosa island.
,,A Good Place for Quick Visit,4.0,,"Another mall in Singapore with unique design outside. I didn't have much time to explore because my purpose to go to Universal Studio. The monorail line facility, Sentosa Express, is helpful for me to reach Sentosa Island. After my visit to Universal Studio, I enjoyed the promenade at night and it's simply entertain me because the scenery of the harbour is dazzling. Also, there is open air playground (below the promenade) for kids. Back to its mall, there are some shops selling souvenirs with cheap price. As I know, it's the only place where you can find Ovomaltine."
,,Boring suburban mall,3.0,,"This is a suburban mall outside downtown, but next to the sentosa entrance. It has all the typical mid-range brands and nothing outstanding . Probably the only draw sometimes is Jamie Oliver's restaurant, and even that is nothing great"
,,Visit On Your Way To Sentosa Or Mount Faber,3.0,,"To shop or eat at Vivo City on its own, even with convenient subway connections (Harbourfront) is foolish. Singapore is expensive and given the high rentals you should not expect a good bargain from Vivo City or other shopping malls. On one's way to Sentosa or Mount Faber, a drop-into this place is fine. This is a ine-stop mall. We planned this route for our friends who normally visits Singapore at year-end (being cooler) - Harbourfront MRT - Mount Faber - Cable Car - Sentosa - Harbourfront Bridge - Vivo City (dinner + window shopping) - Harbourfront MRT. Duration: 1 D. Approx expense per person - S$ 70."
,,"Huge mall, but gets very crowded on weekends",3.0,,"There are plenty of shops to choose from in this massive complex, but on weekends the place gets really very crowded, especially near the exits from the MRT. I find that there are just too many people to make the experience pleasurable."
,,Top Notch Mall,5.0,,It has shops for everyone including a grocery store. Hawker type food shops are upstairs where you can enjoy many Asian food. It has easy links to the main downtown area and is the only link to the Sentosa monorail. Not many luxury boutiques but the mid range shops can fill your senses. A branch of Tangs department store is located there for more choices.
,,Nice mall with everything under one roof,5.0,,Nicely located with easy access by public transportation. I parked my car here and shopped at the mall before taking the monorail from inside the mall across to Sentosa Island. On the return leg I walked across the straits by the Sentosa Boardwal which connects to the rear of the mall & spent more time in the mall.
,,Big shopping mall,3.0,,"Shopping for well known brands? This is the shopping mall for you as you would be able to enjoy shopping with your gf/bf. If you are tired, there are many restaurants for you to ""charge up"" as well. As the night falls, you may want to go up the sky garden to enjoy the night scenery with your love one.
Sentosa is just across the shopping mall as well."
,,Singapore's largest mall,4.0,,It literally has everything you need in terms of brands and good place to escape the heat for a couple of hours. Easy to get to on the MRT (harbourfront station) and open from 10-10 daily its great retail therapy but its not cheap (compared to the UK).
,,Meet up place,5.0,,Met with our friends here to dine. Had breakfast at Mc D's before heading to Sentosa and then dinner here as well after.
,,Bustling Beehive,4.0,,"Visited this place one evening. Terrific Ambience. Proximity to Sentosa adds to the lusture. Real cool mall. More than adequate dining options.
They have an amazing Terrace view as well. One of the nicest things is the regulated Queue with a Guard who manages the Taxi lines really splendidly"
,,Biiiiig mall!,4.0,,"This mall was huuuuuge! It's just that it can be a little bit confusing to go around as it did not seem to me that the shops and restaurants were organised into sections, if you know what I mean. But if you are into shopping, this mall carries just about every brand imaginable."
,,true to its name,4.0,,the place was so lively and the mall is full of people who are buying and shopping. restaurant is all around and the place was so cozy and nice to shop. the ambiance is good and transportation is accessible.
,,great place for shopaholics!,5.0,,"the biggest shopping mall and indeed is an heaven for all shopaholics! with harbor view make it a nice spot to hang out. anything you can find here, everything you can eat here, and anywhere you can go here :)"
,,Giant shopping complex,5.0,,"Vivo city is heaven for shoppers, what i like the most is the artificial beach they have created on the 3rd floor. Nothing like beach but great place to just put your legs in the water and relax after a tiring day."
,,"Great place to shop, eat and can go to Sentosa by monorail.",4.0,,"Great selection of food resto, food court (love the Indian food,chinese and others), cake shops, bakeries. To come here, take MRT Harbour Front. If we wanna go to sentosa island, pay 4sgd (return ticket) and take monorail on the 3rd floor."
,,High end plus mainstream shops,5.0,,Good mix of high end and mainstream shops. Love the Toys'r'us there. Cinema is also good. Large space for road shows also.
,,Large modern shopping centre,4.0,,"Staying on Sentosa this was a very convenient shopping centre with a good cross section of shops and a wide selection of dining options.

We were a little disappointed as many of the shops are duplicates of what's available here in Australia so if you're from Oz and after some unique shopping this probably isn't your place.

Travel from Sentosa is very easy and cnonvenient with the use of the free shuttle / Skytrain"
,,Meal after the beach,4.0,,"This mall is very big, and is filled with many shops. Shopaholics can take note to visit here. It also has many eateries to visit after going to sentosa. However things are definitely pricey."
,,Fun mall that has everything,5.0,,"When you come to Singapore you have to visit this mall! This mall has everything. From Jewellery, Fashion, Toys, Electronics, Cinema, ATMs, Pharmacy, Grocery store, Department store, Salon, amazing Dessert, Cafes, Restaurants, Food court and more food court! This mall is huge, so if you wanna ask for directions you can go to Information desk at Level 1 and 2.

How to get here? You can take a taxi, Bus or MRT. If you use a bus, theres a bus stop right in front of the Mall. If you take MRT you have to go to Harbour Front Station (purple line).
How to find a taxi stand? The easy way is to find Swarovski shop at Ground level. Then turn right until you are outside. From there you can see Taxi stand a bit further in front.

One of my favourite place is the Roof top at Level 3. There are small ponds where you can play with your kids. Or just sit down and enjoy the architecture and sun.

There's another spot i love in Ground Floor. Its in the back of the mall. Theres a big outdoor place where you can see beautiful view of the Sea, Harbour and Sentosa island. You can take beautiful pictures here. If you feeling like sitting down and enjoying the view, there are a lot of Restaurants, Bars, and Cafes along the walk too. The ambience really nice especially at night.

If you like night fun life, theres a Clubbing place across this mall called St. James Power Station. Go to level 3, right besides the Golden Village Cinema, theres a connecting bridge.

This mall also connected to Sentosa Island. You can go to Level 3, right besides the Food Republic. There's a mono rail heading to Sentosa Island. Right now it costs SGD 3. Quite cheap. Stop in Waterfront station if you want to go to Universal Studio.

VivoCity mall also connected with Harbour Front Centre where you can take a Ferry boat to Indonesia island called Batam. It takes 45 mins and costs around SGD 31 one way round. But you might need a Visa if you visit Indonesia.

So, make sure you visit VivoCity mall with your family and friends. Its one of a kind."
,,Best mall in Singapore,4.0,,"This place pretty much has everything - except for cheap knock-offs. Apart from that, there's a great hawker food court, and Jamie's Italian also has a restaurant there. Most big brand stores including Uniqlo and H&M. It's just across the road from the MRT and the rail to Sentosa island also stops there."
,,Huge shopping mall in the south,5.0,,Great mall in the south of singapore..a lots of mall espcially for the kiddos..spoil for chiices regards the food as there a lots of restaurants..park at seah im food court would be better than vivo itself..
,,One of the Better malls,4.0,,"Vivo city is one of the better shopping malls in Singapore. It has a huge variety of shops, is cool and clean and there is atmosphere. Not teh elast it connects to Sentosa as well and easy to get to for harbourfront MRT station."
,,Huge mall....worth a trip,4.0,,"Vivocity is a huge mall.near the southern.side of singapore near the cruise centre. It is linked to.the older harbour front mall.

Vivocity is also where you take the.monorail to sentosa island where the amusement part is.

Its huge shopping mall full.of high end to normal shops so its a mall for everybody including children.

Worth a afternoon trip.and then have dinner there at one of the numerous restaurants and fast food eateries"
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"Excellent shopping mall, integrated with sentosa island as Universal Studio Singapore. Many food, subway, mc Donald, or food court. I Love Chocolate Shop in basement. I always spend my time to visit this mall even busy. Good air. Clean. Awesome place."
,,Good mixture of shops and easy to combine with a day at Universal studios,4.0,,"A great shopping centre with a good mix of high street and some designer shops. Good choice of food outlets and a great supermarket. I liked that it connected to another mall with smaller speciality shops in it. I'd leave buying souviners to you go to Lucky plaza on orchard Rd or in Chinatown as the smaller mall connects to a ferry terminal and found the 4 for $10 items being 3 for $10 here.

If you want a tourist privelage card you need to remember your passport, they won't accept a drivers license.

Like most shopping in Singapore, shops don't open before 10am some are even later. I walked into one that had its door opened at 1025 and was ushered out of the shop saying the door was only half opened for employees to enter. I think centres shops should be uniform to avoid confusion .

Good to be undercover incase of rain, or the sun. You can easily combine here with visiting Sentosa or Universal and make a full day of it."
,,Huge and trendy mall,5.0,,Such a huge and trendy mall with a large food court as well on top. They have a water park kind of thing on top for toddlers which is really relaxing after a tired shopping.
,,Enjoy getting your feet wet on top of the shopping center!,5.0,,"We didn't realize that the top deck of Vivo City actually have a big shallow pond area where people can just leisurely walk into the pond bare feet. That was fascinating experience for the kids (well, for the adults as well) and we really enjoyed strolling along the pond. We went on a weekday so we were the only people there and I would imagine that the place will be packed during weekends.

Recommend to stop by en route to Sentosa!! Your kids will love it."
,,Nice stop after a day in Sentosa,4.0,,"Singapore is home to many malls, but Vivo City was one of the nicest. Great selection of shopping, also one of two departure points for the Cable Car to Sentosa."
,,Excellent shopping mall,5.0,,You can find everything in mall and best being a foreigner you will get privilege and discount on shopping .
,,shopping mall near sentosa island,4.0,,"malls are crowded, because it is one of access to the sentosa island we took the elevator to several floors above. after paying we will see aÀô view towards sentosa island, from a cruise ship, the pedestrian street in singapore boardwalk.

in the shopping mall, we can also shopping, my mom bought me new clothes of my choice.
his prices fairly.

warm regard's
ronnykeff."
,,super busy,3.0,,"As malls go singapore has some better ones. If you are staying in Sentosa then you most probably visit this mall, although it is large and has a lot of shops, resturants, etc the mall is super busy along with the low ceiling makes it uncomfortable to walk around with all the noise."
,,One of the best shopping malls in Singapore,4.0,,"Good selection of shops, restaurants, bars and a cinema complex to suit all budgets. I would however like to see the following additions.....Massimo Duti, British India & Havaianas (available at Tangs so all's not lost).

Favourite eateries Soup Spoon (quick & cheap), Marche (self service buffet style can be expensive) & Food Republic (great selection and very reasonably priced)."
,,Shopping and food,4.0,,"A large range of brands, good restaurants but too much time to catch a taxi.If there are a lot of people waiting, try to call one.At the taxi stand is written what location you should tell the operator"
,,Lots of Shops!,4.0,,great shops here it is a huge mall with lots of shops and restaurants overlooking sentosa island. However this equals lots of people we waited 1hr to get a taxi from the rank outside!
,,Shopping spread out,5.0,,"What a great shopping centre on just two levels. Always spend too much here as lots of boutique fashion outlets and a substantial Asian food hall on the higher station level. If it's shopping you like, spend a day here on the way back from Sentosa Island"
,,Great day out,4.0,,"Loved these shops. Head for the NEW part of Vivo City where Top Shop, Miss Selfridge etc is. There are older shops attached too but the new part is best. They even have Jamie Oliver's restaurant in here, next to Starbucks, well worth a visit. We were lucky to find the tail end of the sales in Zara and other fashion shops so was a bonus! This is great until we needed a taxi. We firstly couldn't find the taxi stand, then we had a half hour wait for a cab. Would use the MRT with a pre paid ticket next trip. They need to fix this as we were approached by a ""private"" driver at the taxi stand and quoted $50 to ride 2 blocks to Marina Bay - he must not have been there legally? this is a bad image for visitors and soured our day."
,,Great place but lack of taxi stand,4.0,,"I would say vivo city is one of the biggest shopping mall in Singapore, unfortunately there is only 1 gate of the taxi stand. So if you are the other entrance you will have to walk so far away to reach the taxi stand. Once I reached there, i can't even see the line .. People simply stop taxi whenever they see one. When I asked them if the know where is the line, they said don't know and grab the taxi there. I would say going to this place is nicer with shuttle bus from hotel nearby."
,,Stick to Orchard Road,1.0,,"We were out here for our last day in Singapore to take the cable-car ride to Sentosa and to have lunch at Vivo before stopping at Raffles for a drink before heading to the airport. Terrible mistake. We thought being the biggest Shopping Centre in Singapore it would have lots of great places to eat. But not so. It took so long to find a place to eat that wasn't Asian, and we had to walk miles (a lot of it outside in the heat) trying to follow very poor signage. The place we eventually found was pretty awful (King Louis Grill - see separate review). The place is very disjointed and confusing and has a lot of empty areas, things being constructed and confusing directories. After the beautiful shopping in Orchard Road it was a waste of time. A lot of the shops are very ordinary and I didn't see anything new or different there during our travels. After lunch we went to get a taxi for a quick trip back to Raffles but the queue was so long we would have been waiting literally an hour, so ended up getting cash (two ATMs we tried were broken) to buy train tickets and by the time we got back it was too late to visit Raffles. It was a total waste of time and I am so glad I didn't waste my time going there on any day previous to that. It's also not at all picturesque, it's quite industrial and unattractive despite the water location. Not worth the trip."
,,Building with complex structure,4.0,,Nearest biggest shopping complex in the close proximity of the attraction called sentosa. lots of good food and renowned brands for your experience. Local food from $3.50 a plate to high end lobsters and abalone. the roof provides a water feature and awesome view of sentosa and cable cars
,,VivoCity - The Gateway to Sentosa,3.0,,"VivoCity is from where you have to start for the Sentosa Islands only if you don't have a helicopter chartered for you. So other than that, whether you take the monorail or the public bus or your own private car; you would have to cross into ViVoCity. The food and the water was exceptionally expensive. Thus I second the recommendation which helped me from others saying 'Get your water bottle before you arrive at Sentosa"". I would rather say, get them before you get to VivoCity. Other than these, they have good shopping opportunities for both men and women. You could also try the Grilled Lamb on the Food Republic."
,,The Shopping mall,4.0,,"This is one of the best Shopping malls in Singapore. Located beautifully on the water front and nice Restaurant opening into the waterfront with a view of Sentosa.

You can soend a nice day and evening at this place.

A must visit on the list for everybody"
,,Too busy,3.0,,I must admit we did have very bad timing when we arrived at the mall the crane dance water light and laser show had just finished on Sentosa Island so there were hundreds of people waiting in a line to get a taxi. If we had waited we would have been there for an hour. So we walked out of the mall and down the road for 5 mins and hay presto there was a taxi waiting for us. Perfect. Its pretty much like any other mall but its close to Sentosa so if you are on the island check it out. You can get from the Island to the mall via the monorail or the boardwalk. Check out the night photos from the boardwalk very nice.
,,Whatever you're looking for.,5.0,,"Great to just walk around or to shop.

Prices range by shop but you will find some more expensive than others. Plenty of bargains and plenty of rip offs.

Overall a good experience! Tell the help desk your a tourist for discounts and freebies.

Be polite to all staff, they don't expect it and it's an awesome reaction. :)"
,,Great place for retail therapy!,5.0,,"If you're staying on Sentosa, your hotel should offer a free shuttle to Vivo or it is easily accessed with the monorail.

Vivo contains all the usual high street haunts - H&M, Zara as well as UK favourites like TopShop, Miss Selfridge and Warehouse. Some high end dealers too - Armani, Calvin Klein etc so all budgets are catered for.

Loads of places to grab a bite - we ate at Jamie's Italian one night. Also has a supermarket which was great as our 3 yr old couldn't get enough bananas during our stay!

An easy place to while away a day - there is a play area for kids but it's outside and we found it was too hot for our boys."
,,All you need under one roof!,5.0,,"Vivo is a shopping mall for all your needs under one roof! We have been to this mall a few times throughout the years and it used to be quite dead. But this time round it was alive and filled with people!!!

It's the closest shopping mall to Sentosa island and is well connected by a monorail at Sentosa station. If you are staying at a hotel in Sentosa you will be given the passes to ride unlimited times.

From a world class food court to Giant supermarket. There's an outdoor kids playground to keep the little one entertained.

It's the place to be!"
,,Best Mall in Singapore IMHO,5.0,,"I've been to almost all the malls in Singapore. Yeah Orchard Rd probably has it over Vivo in terms of sheer volume, but as much as I enjoyed Orchard Rd the first few times, I find it quite taxing now and totally avoided it on my last trip.

However I always go to Vivo. It's big, has pretty much everything, and has some great food and drink options too. It's nicely laid out, easy to get to in a variety of ways, gives access to Sentosa, and I think it's a brilliant mall."
,,The place to spoil your child,3.0,,"A great mall,great enough for shopping spree and to spoil your child endlessly..recommended for another shopping spree"
,,Everything's there including children self amusements,4.0,,"This is The shopping mall for families, mostly, with a lot of areas for children.
If you don't fall in this category avoid at any costs weekends and school holidays periods as it gets really overcrowded. During the week you can shop and eat at your pleasure.
Because the proximity to Harbor Front (ferry & cruises), to which it is virtually attached/connected, it is never empty.
MRT station to Harborfront right on the doorstep, but also taxi station fairly serviced (apart for the overcrowded weekends)."
,,the best mall in sentosa,5.0,,vivo city is again a very good mall in sentosa which has lots of shopping stores having great stufff and offers so be sure before you go there as we went nuts shopping for kids and all there..food choices are almost none for vegetarians though...
,,Good place before off to Sentosa,3.0,,Nice and good for shopping or window shopping before head to sentosa island. Lot of international brand...
,,Huge,5.0,,"Huge mall located right outside sentosa. There are a lot of eateries here from the more upmarket ones to the local food court that serve local street food. There's also a nice walkway outside near to the wharf.

Location wise is great as the mrt stops right below the mall and there is a bus interchange opp the mall too. During the weekends, people may find it difficult to find parking lots."
,,Shopping Ahoy.,4.0,,Taking the MRT to Harborfront gets you to the spacious Vivo City Shopping Centre. It is typical Plaza shopping with all the glitz and glamour and air conditioned comfort. No Top End here but plenty to amuse and keep shoppers amused. The Food Republic up top is probably the best we have experienced and we keep going back every trip. A short distance from there is the Monorail which takes travellers to Sentosa Island. That is another fantasy opportunity and well worth the visit especially to the significant Casino but remember your Passport for entry.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"You can come here via Harbourfront MRT. It is Singapore's largest retail mall and it did not disappoint. There are a lot of shops from electronics to fashion boutiques, and from toy stores to restaurants. There is a movie house and a huge parking lot (there are signs so you can park right under/above/near the place you want to go). The restaurants serve all types of cuisine (Japanese, Chinese, Italian, etc.). This is the perfect place to go if you are bored, and it even has a playground for kids."
,,A Perfect Mall!,5.0,,"If you are visiting Sentosa by Sentosa Express then you hit this mall first! Well, that's how we came across Vivo City. But we ""explored"" this mall while coming back from Sentosa.
Everything about this mall is, well - Perfect! It is well connected by MRT - Harbour Front Station is IN the mall :). There is a huge car park in the basement. The mall is very well laid out. On every level you have the overall map and the detailed map of that level. There is an assistance bay. There's one food mall in the basement and premium restaurants are on the terrace. Many premium brands - be it clothing or chocolates or ice-creams or toys or electronics - are there.
We bought some toys and cloths, had a good dinner then had a scoop of ice cream as dessert!
We had a feeling that when you buy anything from here you are assured of the quality of the product and you don't mind paying a premium for that. I believe, apart from the intrinsic quality of the product, the overall premium feel of the place also contributes to this feeling!"
,,A map would have been useful!,4.0,,Large shopping mall with enough to look at and keep you amused on a rainy day (or any day). A branch of Tangs which is a good department store. Lots of eateries. Sentosa Express leaves from here and there are also desks where you can get ferry tickets to other islands. Outside areas that are pleasant for a bit of air and views over the harbour to Sentosa. Ways of keeping children entertained and clean toilets. A map would have been useful to help find my way around but I don't think that is considered environmentally friendly.
,,Very nice,4.0,,Went to Vivo city because the train going to sentosa is located here. There are so many shops and restaurants. Nice view of the sentosa island.
,,Confusing but good place to be,4.0,,"Glad to report that Vivo City like most other shopping malls in Singapore has plenty of clean toilet facilities and is very child friendly, children get so bored shopping and to have somewhere for them to play, on most floors is a godsend. There is so much choice food wise too you would be hard put not to find something to eat that suits your needs.
And then there's the shopping, again so much choice, from the big names to the small independents.
Good all round experience."
,,Enormous Mall,5.0,,An enormous mall located across sentosa island. Vivo City has shops of every sort and is a great place to spend your afternoon and have lunch. Do not miss the Boardwalk at dawn. Loved this mall and its design.
,,Love Vivo City,4.0,,"There are so many reasons why my family and I love this place. There are so many options when it comes to food and there's the indoor kids play area (SingKids I think), an outdoor playground and the outdoor water park. And if you're bored, then take the Sentosa train straight into Sentosa Island. My family and I frequent Vivo City on the weekends and most good banks have branches here which are open on weekends. Perfect."
,,Not just a Mall !!!!,4.0,,"Getting here is very easy. Take an MRT to Harbour front station and follow the signs for Vivo city Mall. You don‚Äôt even have to exit the station internally its connected.

A huge iconic dwelling for retail and entertainment for locals and visitors.

For Shopping the largest mall in town has a series of brands local and international. Hypermarket for daily shopping. For entertainment for adults and kids for unlimited fun filled day it offers 15cinemas, Rooftop amphitheatre and swimming pools.

You have lots of eateries, coffee shops, restaurants, fast-food. There are currency exchange bureau. Tour operator desk.
Level 5 of the mall takes you to the embarkation point for Cable car.
Ground level way may take you to the cruise boarding area, ferry terminal.

It‚Äôs just not a shopping complex, it offers various things."
,,Nothing to shout about,3.0,,"While regarded as Singapore's largest mall, having been pampered by larger malls in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, I honestly feel that this is nothing much to shout about with the exception of the large variety of good Western restaurants here."
,,Huge Mall,3.0,,This mall is huge and easy to get lost. It is also rather out of the way....unless if you are heading to Sentosa! Too many shops in zig zag layout....
,,Great mall outside sentosa island,4.0,,This is one of the few malls that I frequent in Singapore. Caters to all kinds of crowd and very children friendly. There are 2 big supermarkets located here; giant and cold storage. Many eateries to cater to different taste buds and budgets. Public transport to this place is ample with buses and mrt right beneath the mall.
,,Relaxing and Nice Shopping,5.0,,Vivo City Singapore is a nice place for shopping and you can view the Beautiful RWS Sentosa ay the floyer of Vivo City. Prices at the shopping outlet shops are reasonable and can have cheap lunch or dinner at the Republic Foodcourt.
,,They've got it all!,4.0,,"Whatever you need, you will find it at Vivo City! What an amazing shopping mall! Very big, so you could loose your way but there is always someone to help you back on track."
,,awesome mall,5.0,,an awesome mall with plenty of restaurants and a great food court with local delicacies lots of different stores with everything imaginable and its connected too the m r t
,,Lots of shopping and gateway to Sentosa,4.0,,"Big shopping mall well positioned at Harbour Front and close to Sentosa. Heaps of shopping, food and people watching opportunities. My girlffriend took me their and we enjoyed every momnet of it - particularly one of the chocolate shops! Good place for families and the constant cool airconditioning makes all the more better. Very highly recommended and I look forward to returning."
,,Went there for dinner,3.0,,"We had originally wanted to walk to Sentosa Island for dinner but being 9pm already, we decided that it was rather late and turned back. Looked at the restaurants on the boardwalk and then the ones at Vivo City with outdoor views and seating. Nothing really suitable for my Muslim friend, so we headed to the food court in the basement. Saw The Chicken Rice Shop which was halal and then we found the halal section of the food court. Not so clean and there was hardly any water at the wash basins. Had a western meal of beef steak and pasta which was rather average.

The mall designed by the famous Japanese architect Toyo Ito was interesting, especially when viewed from the outside but I think that the newer and smaller Beachwalk at Kuta, Bali (with similar fluid curves and organic forms) was nicer."
,,Great location and good for shopping,4.0,,"Going there was very convenient with lots of bus route stop just in front of its door, 2 subway lines, and Sentosa express. And there're plenty of restaurant and shops that you should have at least half a day to explore all of them. But what I loved here was food at food republic which was great and the price also not so high compared to other restaurant in the building."
,,Go to Sentosa and shop on the way home,4.0,,"Situated at Harbourside, which gets you to Sentosa Island. This was the cheapest shopping centre that we found. It was not crowded which made shopping a pleasure. Styles for the younger set, as it is most everywhere in Singapore, but found some things and shoes for my over 50 self and husband. 2 sections to Vivo City, Seems to have an Older section (near the Taxi's) and a newer section, overlooking the boardwalk to Sentosa."
,,Great location,4.0,,It was a great experience. The mall is so damn huge and I got lost :))) alot of stores and various brands for everyone
,,nice place,5.0,,"It is the other famous place in Singapore. Traveler can shopping or have lunch or have dinner in here. Although it is not near Orchard, it is very near Sentosa. Visiters can take Mrt or Bus to go very easy."
,,Love the Sky Park!,5.0,,There's a sky park located at level 3 and a splash pool to soak and chill your sore feet from walking and exploring Universal Studio Singapore. My children had a great time in the pool and love this place so much!
,,Great Location but unappealing stores & food options,3.0,,"Nice location with links to MRT and boardwalk/sentosa; which i would say is the best appeal of this shopping centre. Otherwise after a long afternoon of walking (sentosa), we walked here via the boardwalk in search of dinner and could only find a few restaurants (two or three which were full) and the food court was in the distant end of the mall, poorly planned, unappealing food, not enough seating and super over crowded. Had a difficult time finding directories and maps within the mall, in the end was happy to Leave this mall"
,,Very nice place to visit,4.0,,You will have almost brands you want for shopping and very convenient to take train to Sentosa island.
,,Nice place to visit,5.0,,"My ship docked at Singapore port and I had opportunity to shop around in VivoCity. It is very convenient to go there from cruise center, coming out from the terminal, go straightup towards the front building and there you will find escalator to the second floor, follow the sign indication to VivoCity; you will pass a long walking way to this shopping center. The shopping mall is huge and it is in a whirling shape and very easy to get confused. Besides many retail outlets, there are many restaurants and eateries at different levels. Retail shops usually opens from 10am to 9:30pm in weekday.

There are total 5 levels in VivoCity, B1, B2, L1, L2 and L3. Sentosa Express is on level 3, a single day pass costs S$4 for unlimited rides. Operating hours: 7am - 12mn. HarbourFront MRT station is located on the B2. take Exit B (Harbourfront Centre). Follow directional signs leading to Singapore Cable Car station at Harbourfront, and you can find many package deals there.

If you have time, go to Sky Park on L3, there are amphitheater, splash pool and nice view of harbour.."
,,Everything under one roof,4.0,,"A vast array of shops, food, cinemas and cafes. All air conditioned. Great shopping, cheaper than Orchard road. Very friendly, spacious and next to Harbour front MRT."
,,Best Place to Shop in Singapore,5.0,,"VivoCity is Singapore‚Äôs largest retail and lifestyle destination.

,,Impressive mall for shopping,4.0,,"It was my last day, few hours before my flight I embarked on this nice mall. I wanted to go Sentosa, but there was hardly any time. However, I was on the roof looking on to the cruiser, bridge to Sentosa and a long list of things to buy text-ed by my wife back home. Fortunately, I bought all the things needed , and it was good experience indeed."
,,"A big mall, but I won't say huge, only appeal is Invicta watch store",3.0,,"I'm from Hong Kong, a shopping city, hence wanna to see how good the biggest shopping mall in Singapore will be like.

Though it's the biggest mall in Singapore, but I won't say it's huge, as the storey is not high. But I was amazed to see there are so many cars in the car park while all my singaporean friends are telling me how expensive a car is in Singapore.

Back to the mall, the only interesting store inside is the Invicta watch store (It's a low to medium brand but the watch size is huge for big guys like me), which I seldomly see anywhere. Zara, Berksha, Brooks Brothers, Levis, Giordano, ToyRus etc. Not high end but medium range.

I bought 2 pair of kids shoes at 50% discount, but got nothing else. Though Tang's department store is having a sale. Lots of restaurants there, I tried the Malaysia food but it's not that great.

I took a cab from Marina Bay to HarbourFront (Vivo city), costs me SGD 12, I don't think it's worth it to take a cab there. It's ok if you got time and want to explore new places."
,,shopping shopping shopping,4.0,,If you cant find what you are after in this place then you should probably leave singapore. It has everything for everyone. All the designers shops and heaps of nice restaurants . Also the gateway to sentosa island.
,,Modern Mall opposite Sentosa,5.0,,"If you want Retail Therapy then this is the place for you. Modern shopping centre, with plenty of stores of numerous variety. Sentosa Island is just across the water, near by. You can even walk to Sentosa along the boardwalk from Vivo City. This is an especially lovely walk at night with all the beautiful lights along the boardwalk."
,,Mall was very good but not as great as we hoped,4.0,,"Vivo City we were told is the largest mall in Singapore. We spent there half a day and it was ok.
We visited Suntec and Orchard Road were better places due to their atmosphere.
Vivo City is so large it would take days to view all the many shops. This place is very popular."
,,Something for everyone,5.0,,Brilliant shopping mall and is ideallu located in close proximity to Sentosa where we stayted. Has something for everyone ranging from low-cost items to the top end fashion labels. Definitely one to pencil into your shopping intinerary.
,,Great mall and easy to get,4.0,,"Located near cable car and because there is MRT station and Monorail station to Sentosa, it's easy to get here. Clean, modern and full of shops, restaurants etc"
,,Plenty here!,5.0,,"We visited on numerous occasions in January 2014 with our two children aged 7 and 10. Our hotel situated on Sentosa Island had a free shuttle service.

Vivo City has plenty of shops and places to eat. We also found it very convenient starting point for our travels via the MRT.

My youngest daughter enjoyed the battery operated 'cars' on the second level near Starbucks.

On the eating front we enjoyed food at the hawkers centre on the rooftop and also at Jamie Olivers restaurant on the ground floor.

I found the amenities (toilets) very clean.

You will find something for everyone here."
,,Biggest mall in Singapore,4.0,,I liked for shopping here as the price was not so expensive if compare to mall in Orchard area and of course connected to Harbour Front. I disliked for the toilet as it was not so clean and with bad smell.
,,what more could you want from a mall?,5.0,,"Man, this is the mother-ship of all shopping malls. In fair disclosure, though, my family tends to go here on a stop to Sentosa, but when we stop, there's certainly nothing lacking. Shopping? - everything. Food - endless options. Best part for families - a terrific play area up top that has water fountains, a small slide, and a few rides. My three year old gets so excited every time she sees the place from inside the mall that she just sprints right through the doors. Nice extras are rentals for little cars or motorcycles ($5 / 5 minutes), and an indoor play area with toys and arts/crafts. If you wander outside, of course, you're waterfront with views of Sentosa - if you're bored here, you'd be bored on the moon. Only challenge is long taxi lines, but use your phone app or just be patient instead of annoying everyone else."
,,A big shopping centre in Singapore,4.0,,"It is huge with many many shops! It is almost certain you could find something you like. But after shopping, it was a long long queue at the Taxi Stand."
,,excellent mall,5.0,,Nice mall to spend time.. very crowded because its connecting MRT to Sentosa.. but lots of shops and food options..
,,Excellent spot to spend time and unwind,5.0,,This mall is a perfect place to spend time and unwind after a days hectic schedule. There are multiple choices of cuisine and restaurants and also may big shops of branded items. Spend time and leisure.
,,Overcrowded,3.0,,"The mall is easy to reach by mrt and it is the biggest mall in Singapore so you can find a lot of things inside and it also the gateway to sentosa island. But when i came it was too crowded especially the one near with mrt, it was full either with local and tourist make me cannot really enjoy my shopping activities there. I will recommend to visit this mall during weekday which not really crowded so you can enjoy your shopping activity."
,,Safety Concern at Vivocity,2.0,,"Vivocity is a mall with a lot of brands and a lot of food options and options for leisure activities. Another plus is the design (really beautiful with an open-air playground and a beautiful water park on the roof, where kids like to play).

So why does Vivocity only get a ""poor"" rating from us? There are several reasons:

1) It is very large and you will spend long time searching for this. We were for example searching for access to the B2 Floor with the food court, but had to try 3 elevators as the first 2 only took us to the car park section of B2 Floor.

2) Taxi availability is poor. Also here we agree with previous reviewers.

3) The worst: The mall has unsafe facilities. Our son got hurt today when walking on the Level 3 Skypark towards the Sentosa Boardwalk. As we came directly from the water pool, we were barefooted. But the stretch towards the Sentosa Boardwalk is wooden and very poorly maintained. Consequently, my son got 5 (FIVE!!!) wood splinters into the sole of his left foot - just by walking normally. He was not even running.

Some of the splinters were very deep, and we went to a doctor on the second floor in Vivocity to get the 5 wood splinters removed. When the doctor first saw my son's injury, he mentioned that he has seen the same thing here at Vivo City many times!

Had it not been for this accident caused by poor maintenance, I had given Vivocity 4 points, but with this safety hazard makes me only give a poor rating."
,,Huge and confusing,4.0,,"It's a huge shopping centre with everything you could need in there. But it's sold at prices equivalent to Australia (don't expect cheap) and it has the feel of an unplanned centre that expanded without thought. It's very hard to find a specific thing as there's few maps. The rooftop area is nice though, lots of grass and a shallow pool to wade in."
,,Too big to be excellent,4.0,,"Although Vivo City is a perfect shopping mall in many people's opinion, with many shops ranged from reasonable and affordable and some good places to eat, I felt quite uncomfortable visiting it. I got lost there and made the whole coach to wait. :("
,,Perfect Mall for family with kids,4.0,,"Vivo City is located next to Harbour front. There are many water feature to play with, from the dancing fountain at front terrace, to the kids playground at the rooftop and the giant pond for kids which is unimaginable to be exist at a mall. Food Republic is located at the rooftop level. My favourite store is Ben & Jerry ice cream. If you are bored with the top-notch super luxury shopping malls at Orchard road, this is the different one."
,,Large Mall,4.0,,"This is the largest Mall in Singapore. Great place to spend some time window shopping, expensive shops. Some great dinning but can also be expensive. On the third floor you can catch the Monorail to Sentosa Island, ezlink pass is excepted. MRT stop is in the Mall to get to and from the area."
,,A nice place!,4.0,,There are many shops to visit and it has restaurants with foods of good quality... The decor makes the place look more vibrant and bright! A place with a link to the monorail to explore the other parts of sentosa and a link to the MRT's North-East line! Good to come here!
,,shoping mall on the harbour front,4.0,,"one can easily access by mono rail from sentosa,all the types of food and shoping of electronics,saloons children product awailable with this market,also there is doller shop and childrens play area"
,,Poor taxi availability,1.0,,"After spending a lovely day at universal studios we decided to have a meal at Vivo City, great meal, however the wait for a taxi was horrendous, it needs to be better organised over an hour wait. Unable to order a taxi as no phone. Would put me of shopping there."
,,Huge.,4.0,,"like any other shopping mall in Singapore vivo city is huge. seemed to have more than the other malls, plaza singapura etc though, so was probably my favourite. has outdoor terraces that give great views of sentosa and also has a kids area. also like any other place in Singapore avoid on a Saturday, you cant move in the shops or the MRT station!"
,,found great supermarket at vivo city,5.0,,"to eat on sentosa island and at the hotels can be expensive. we ate at vivo city as it was more economical and had more of a variety. we found this great little korean supermarket on the bottom floor that sold local and Aussie brands of food and fruit. It was very cheap and fresh. we brought alot of bagels, whole roast chicken for $4, sweet bakery treats, fruit, youghurt, milk, biscuits, bread, cold meat. we took this back to the room and ate it there as well."
,,After taste of the Faber Mt.,4.0,,"After a hot walking of the faber mt. you can stay here, have a cold drink and some break. then just take a look at those shops and restaurant. There's lot's of food with different kind and country around this mall. and path of the mall is wide, have a good rest after the faber mt. walk here."
,,"Very Large Mall, great shopping and good food.",4.0,,"If you're looking forward doing some shopping while in Singapore, Vivo City is one of the best places to go. Lots of international retailers, lots of varied food offerings and direct SMRT access."
,,The must go shopping centre in Singapore!,5.0,,"Vivo city has every shop that you would expect it to have. The best thing is that it is joined to Sentosa Island so you hit 2 birds with one stone. There are 2 food courts with an array of cuisines available.
Vivo city has stores which sell cheap yet good clothing and shoes. Which is definitely a must for a good holiday!"
,,a very nice place but i dont know why ?,4.0,,"This place has a very uniqueness compared to all those other malls in singapore , may be that the first impression when entering through the MRT or may be since it is the entrance to Sentosa Island however it was a very nice place , had some things that i was searching for and a good selection of food as well. visited the place thrice during my 4 day stay there :)"
,,Another Excellent Singaporean Mall!,5.0,,"I've been to Singapore twice now and Vivo City is one of my favorites as it's next to Sentosa. The mall boasts among others, Zara, Ben Sherman, G-2000, Aldo, Giordano, Pull&Bear (Zara's youth line - not available in the U.S.), Uniqlo, Ted Baker, and Lacoste. Once you're done shopping, you'll find an impressive array of restaurants and cafes to dine and relax. These ARE NOT your typical mediocre U.S. food courts. For dessert, there is a place that specializes in Japanese cakes/tarts as well as numerous restaurants service Japanese food. Of course, there are restaurants/cafes serving local cuisine, Chinese, Korean, American etc. Once you're done shopping/dining, take the free tram to Universal Studios or Sentosa for beachfront activities."
,,Great Mall!!,4.0,,"I come to this mall almost everyday last time but i just cannot get boring..

I can find huge variety of food starting from my favourite haagen dazs and ben and jerry, got sushi restaurant, got foodcourt at the basement and 3rd level, got yummy kolo mee also at the basement, got many2 choices of fast food started from McD, Burger King, Texas..

Many variety of shops from clothing, baby, maternity and kids..
Ans last but not least this mall also have pet shop..

This mall have many connecting points such as 2nd level connect to harbour front mall and 3rd level have sentosa express that can lead us to sentosa.."
,,Good Place to Shop & Dine,4.0,,"We visited Vivo City when we transferred hotels from Singapore Island to Sentosa. The place had your usual international brands of clothing shops plus a wide array of food options. Also a good place to buy some souvenirs. Situated just at the start of the bridge, Vivo City is just the perfect location to stop, shop, and dine if you're heading to Sentosa."
,,Affordable Shopping,4.0,,"If you are after affordable clothes then this is the place...Gap, Nike, Adidas, Puma et cetera with plenty of food outlets. A short stroll from Sentosa and an option if wanting to save some money on dinners. There is also Chemists for any medicines that may be needed."
,,Not too bad for main stream shopping,4.0,,Located at start of bridge to sentosa Vivo city had all the main shops you want in an average setting. Some shops and areas seemed a little tired and it was not on par in my opinion with what you find at Ion on Orchard and even Raffles city
,,Good Location,4.0,,this mall is near by. if you are looking for some sovereigns to buy! you will find nice collection in few shops on 1st floor. you will find wide range of shoes and accessories (neck-lace) and at very good price!
,,Good shopping and restaurants,4.0,,"We've been to the shopping mall a few times during our stay. We are staying on Sentosa and have travelled by bus then monorail which is free. We have also caught a taxi if we are feeling lazy approx. $6. The shops catered for all my kids aged 16, 13 and 6. There is Zara, Forever 21, Top Shop, Pull and Bear, Sports Stores and electronic stores for the teens. They found things they liked. For the munchkin there are lots of kids stores. The playground is outside so we didn't use it. Too hot. There are lots of jewellery, shoe, H &M, Marks and Spencer, Makeup, Mini Mart and other stores for the adults. We also went to the cinema and had lunch overlooking Sentosa and the Cable Cars. You can easily spend half a day here. The mall itself is clean (as expected in Singapore). This mall is more affordable compared to the Marina Bay Shops."
,,Great shopping center,5.0,,"This is a very nice shopping centre, beautiful laid out, good variety of shops and relatively good prices. You won't have the a Orchard Rd and MBS high flyer brands but also not the market ware. Really good shopping for in between these two.
The range of restaurants amazed me and looking out over the water towards Sentosa is beautiful too.
We took a cab to get there which was excellent as we saw something along the way as well.

It's definitely a place to go back to."
,,Awesome shopping centre,5.0,,"Went here for the first time this past weekend and would have to say it I by far one of the BEST shopping centres in Singapore.The food area is amazing.The food was of high standard.Massive selection of foods to eat.
Great play area for kids but it was just to hot outside.
Toilets very clean.All round Excellence!!!!"
,,"HUGE shopping experience, would not rate the kids playground though",3.0,,"I was recommended Vivo City as a shopping centre with a kids playground (was travelling with my 4 year old).
Lots of variety of shops & dining options, however the kids playgroud was out in the direct, hot Singaporean sun and was really not suitable at all! The few items they had to play on were all scorching hot from the heat.
I'm sure there a much better places to take kids in Singapore for a play than here."
,,Excellent !,5.0,,"Shops , Food, Multiplex , View Points, Banks , Gym, Childrens playing area, Cafe's, Supermarkets - Name it and its there. One stop shop for everything. Very spacious and easy to get lost !! :) . Have fun !"
,,Largest mall I ever seen.,5.0,,"We always started our day at vivo city, we were in Singapore for 6 days, and we start at the mall cause it was at the center of all the best attractions, and has taxi access, I do recommend calling a taxi then just the que. The movie theater was the best. Lots of different places to eat, from snack shops, drink shops, fast food and restaurants of all price ranges. Lots of shops, lots of people, everyone I encountered in shops and food places were very polite and helpful. And outside the mall there is the river, you can see the cruise ship arrive or depart, they have the cruise station inside the mall, also the outside has a nice place to sit and just relax with a river view. Also you can purchase tickets to Sentosa Island attractions, from S.E.A Aquarium to Universal Studios, also has a tram that travels to the island inside the mall. The taxis were not expensive, our hotel was far, and it was like a 20 minute drive by taxi and it was between 12 to 15 Singapore dollars. On Saturdays at the mall they have a chef band that walks around playing music. Lots of things to do other then shopping, Even had a fitness center."
,,very nice mall,4.0,,"very nice shopping mall
they have nice cafes and food court i like sitting in Fruit Paradise Cafe or HONEYMOON DESSERT cafe some times i go to the terrace to view the marina
the shops not cheap and also not so expensive
some times i bought from stands out side the shop"
,,"The Shopping Mall is good but beware of the rude, abusive person on the taxi rank who targets tourists",3.0,,"The shopping centre is good with a great variety of shops and plenty of places to get a decent coffee!

It is very pleasant to sit and watch the boats moving about in the harbour and there is a variety of outdoor restaurants where you have a good view of the harbour across to Sentosa Island.

We did have a problem with the man that was supervising the taxi stand at Vivo shopping centre who became rude and abusive. He lets locals jump the queue & get in the standard taxis &tries to direct the tourists to the higher priced prestige taxis. When I said we were waiting for a regular taxi and complained that he let others jump the queue he became extremely aggressive and abusive including pointing his fingers right in my face - all in all a very unpleasant & frightening experience . Because of this I would not return to Vivo shopping centre and would strongly advise tourists to consider taking the MRT instead of dealing with the unpleasant staff at the taxi rank."
,,Biggest mall in Singapore with nice view by the strait,4.0,,"You can go outside of this mall and enjoy afternoon breeze by the sea, nice view of Sentosa island. I ate at honeymoon dessert here. It was decent."
,,Another great a Mall,4.0,,Vivo City is another enormous mall in Singapore. It's pricing is just like everywhere else as far as I could see and the range is great. Something for everyone. Lots of food outlets to feed the masses. This is where you catch the pink monorail over to Sentosa. You can now use your MRT card which is a good thing.
,,loved it,4.0,,it was a great mall and not too badly priced eithier ... the food court was okey but could have better service .... if you are planning to go make sure u are ready to.walk alot because it is a.very big mall... also make sure you see the.samsung.store anf other electronics store very nicely.priced
,,AMAZING SHOPPING EXPIERANCE,4.0,,"Singapore's Vivo City is shopping heaven. I arrived via the Sentosa Express on my way to the MRT downstairs. A multistory arcade with vast spaces. So many food options! A beautiful garden, pool and walks on the roof, access to the cruise terminal and, where I was headed, to the subway station. MRT. I find with no exception, the staff I interacted with, to be friendly and most helpful. Off to check out the shopping on Orchard Road next. Love this city!"
,,Great shopping,4.0,,Lovely shopping mall - clean and well laid out. Good restaurants. We particularly enjoyed Jamie Oliver's. and there was a free bus sevice to and from our hotel and great underground access which is so much nicer to used the the London tube.
,,Great time at the Vivo City,4.0,,"This Shopping mall is located at the Harbour Front area , at the south of Singapore Island.One of the biggest shopping mall in Singapore.Ferry deparature and arrival docks eg.to Batam island ,Indonesia is accessible quite near from here.Vivo City is the gateway to Sentosa Island , boarding the Sentosa Express , stationed on the top floor in this Mall.Excellent place to shop , fun for family and kids, many food stalls and eateries all over ( worth to check out the FoodRepublic beside the Sentosa ticketing booth).Got an outside park with water sprinkler and shallow pools.This shopping mall is accessible by taxi , but we always use the MRT , more convinient ."
,,Excellent Mall,5.0,,"I travelled to Singapore during Aug 10-13,2013 with my son. We spent 1 day at Vivo City. The first half day was only pass to Sentosa. The last full day in Vivo City. I enjoyed a lot in this mall since very easy to go by MRT, Harbour Font. A lot of eating place, sight-seeing, shopping. My son get stuck at one comp-game shop and end with 4 items of PLay Station Vita. For me I get stuck at DVD Shop and bought some StarTrek collection. This place is really an enjoyable place that you cannot miss."
,,Great mall for shopping and eating,5.0,,"Vivo City is one of the biggest malls in Singapore. The layout and design of the mall is such that it's very open and spacious, so it has an ""enormous"" feel to it, but essentially it's just walking from one stretch to the other. So even at times when the mall is thronging with people, you won't feel claustrophic.

Unlike Orchard Road, which has numerous designer shops, Vivo City is a mall which has a pretty good balance of shops catering to different needs and budgets. Good to come during June-July season, when the Great Singapore Sale is on, one might enjoy some nice discounts here!

You can also find numerous dining opportunities here as well, depending on the budget. You are really spoilt for choice on what to eat! So many different cuisines to choose from!!! Depending on where you choose to dine at, you can get a nice view of Sentosa Island too, namely the Resorts World Sentosa. Be it in the afternoon, evening or at night, the views are simply stunning! A wonderful complement to a sumptuous meal! =D

This mega-mall is also located near Sentosa Island, another tourist destination. From Vivo City itself, one can take the Sentosa Express (this mini-train) that takes you straight into Sentosa, or you can choose the walk across via the Boardwalk!

The mall is quite family friendly too, the roof has this play area for the kids. There is a playground, there is a mini-pool too. While the kids roam and have fun, parents can catch their breaths at the rest areas nearby.

Vivo City is very convenient to get to, it sits right above Harbourfront Station (take the Purple or Yellow Line); loads of parking space available but best to come early. I've been coming here for years now, and i never get tired of it!"
,,"Good place for shopping, eating and kids fun",4.0,,"Vivocity is a nice place to visit. Firstly due to the well connectivity with MRT and this mall is huge with lot of good brands to shop. Many food joints here and specially for kids they have a dry and wet playground to enjoy. Kids can spend hours here and on weekends it is crowded.
On the rooftop again kids and adults can enjoy the water area and relax.

This mall has a nursing room as well so good for mums with babies."
,,Just Another Shopping Mall,3.0,,"Vivo city is the connection point for the Sentosa Express so we checked it out upon our return from Universal Studios on Sentosa Island (see separate review) for a couple of hours. Nothing special here that we have not seen in hundreds of other shopping malls across the world. It was clean and had plenty of shops, but prices were not anything special."
,,Spell 'Sophisticated'!,4.0,,Passed through this mall on our way to the Sentosa/ Universal Studios area. This is a very beautiful mall right next to the MRT and the metro going to Sentosa. It's one of the most sophisticated malls I have seen in all my travels so far in the SEA region.
,,Great shopping mall that needs to be checked out by all!,5.0,,"Vivo City is a great shopping mall that has everything really. If its a food shop you want to do, stop for a bite to eat, buy a new pair of shoes, see a movie etc you can do it all here!

Easily accessible as most of Singapore is. Also has an MRT station inside so it's really easy to get to other areas of Singapore and really quickly!

Definitely check it out! Highly recommended!"
,,Alive morning and night,4.0,,"Whether you visit vivo city during mornings or night time, you will surely appreciate the place, it gives a feeling of elite shopping and you can choose from a number of stores. A lot of choices and there are food stalls too. The facade is really cool as well as the interior inside. You can never waste your whole day here."
,,Serene and beautiful,5.0,,"All though it has lot of shops to do shopping and great places to eat. The best part I liked is place on top of the mall where one sit. It faces the harbour. It is probably the best thing that I found there. One can also bring drinks and food there(there is also 7/11 shop at the mall) and sit. It faces the santosa island and in evening one can also see ""songs of the sea"" from this place. If there is some wind, then it is the best thing. Just loved the place."
,,Cool shopping centre,4.0,,I could spend a whole day here. It was great. I agree the hawker area called food republic at the top is very cool too with so much variety and very reasonably priced.
,,Use of lift,4.0,,"My mum and I were on holidays in Singapore and we went to do some shopping in Vivocity last weekend. My mum was on the wheechair and we had to wait very long to get into the lifts at the basement because the lifts were always full of people. I do not understand why able bodied young people need to use the lifts when there are escalators. These youngsters just stared at us and did not have the courtesy to reserve the lifts for wheelchair bound though we noticed that there is a wheelchair sign. Some even rushed in instead of offering us to go in first. People nowadays really lack graciousness. No wonder Singa gave up on them,..."
,,Food Emporium amazing!,5.0,,The food emporium (food court) at the top of Vivo City next to the Sentosa train station is amazing! All kinds of Singaporean food and more. We had the best laksa ever there!The whole area is decorated like in the olden times. Very authentic. Shopping is good.
,,Probably the best mall in Singapore....,5.0,,"Of all the malls in Singapore, Vivo City is probably the best. It has it's own MRT stop (Harbour Front Station) which is located directly in the mall. It has a wide variety of restaurants - both sit down & fast food. For clothes, it probably has the best selection of all the malls with many well known brands. There is a playground on the roof. You can access the monorail to Sentosa Island from this mall or walk along the boardwalk over the the island (easy 10 minute walk). It has a large 'Giant' store. Website: http://www.vivocity.com.sg/index.php"
,,Great place,5.0,,"Wow what a great mall, we had been to many of the malls in Singapore but not this one, this one was great, had loads of food options in the food court and the shops were great, more mid range than top end but certainly had everything that we needed. We had previously passed through to get to sentosa but we'd definately shop here again."
,,Fantastic shopping center!,5.0,,"VivoCity is Singapore‚Äôs largest shopping complex which covers over 24 hectares and is located at HarbourFront Walk just opposite Sentosa Island.

Besides having every shop and restaurant you could possibly think of there is a beautiful Sky Park, giant playgrounds for children, wading pools. Singapore‚Äôs largest Cinema complex is also at VivoCity with 15 screens and Asia‚Äôs largest cinema screen.

The land around the shopping complex also has lots of areas where families have picnics and there are fantastic views of the waterfront and Sentosa Island.

We really enjoy going to Vivocity and of course a few of my favorite shops are in there like, Guess, Espirit, Tangs and Traveller World."
,,Suitable to go shopping,4.0,,"We bought a lot of things here and it is really good at November,December when Christmas not come yet. All travelers should come to Vivo City at this time, we can save money than. I love Singapore fried rice in their Food court, love it much."
,,get the tourist privilege card,5.0,,"When you visit VIVO City, make sure to get your tourist privilege card (its free ) and the card would give you discounts for your purchases, free coffee from McDonalds (No purchase required) free gift for a minimum spend of SGD60 (travel Pouch) or SGD80 (wall Clock) single receipt."
,,Such a grate mall.,4.0,,"A Mall monstrously huge and in my humble point of view the most important and crowded throughout Singapore.
This is in correspondence with the MRT train station Harbour Front, the line color is purple.
The Vivo City has built on 4 or more levels, all conveniently connected one another by escalators.
Inside the Mall, an uncountable number of shops, cafes, banks, and an area dedicated entirely to the food court, this is at the top floor, within the Sentosa Express train stop, also located at the top floor of the Mall.
Also just from this Mall you can walk to the island of Sentosa across the Sentosa Boardwalk, and besides that I should mention the presence of the cable car station not far from here, a couple of hundred meters away from the Mall, this cable also connects the Vivo City to the Sentosa Island, it is actually an expensive alternative to the monorail or simply walking."
,,"Convenient location,good selection of outlets",4.0,,A rare surprise this well placed centre has all the brands plus some good value outlets and a great variety of food venues.Located at the entrance to Sentosa Island it is most convenient and whilst large it is not overwhelming.
,,"""huge nice mall with pool on top""",5.0,,"Singapore has lots of shopping malls...This one with pool on top and there You can view ferries to and from Indonesia....You can do sight seeing views from Sentosa's mrt to and from....fresh ambient for family, children and friends. Very nice-must go, shop and relax there!"
,,"Forget Orchard malls, I like here better :)",5.0,,"We went here after our visit to Sentosa.
it's so huge, you will need to check for the shop directory at every floor.

Getting here is so easy, just board the purple line MRT to Harbourfront, and there you are,
To be honest, we have the most shopping experience here rather than walking all the orchard malls, everything are here, lots of places to eat also.

The mall also have an excellent view of the harbour and sentosa"
,,Huge shopping mall,5.0,,"Vivo City is huge, my favourite stores are here so I often visit when in Singapore. The mall is lovely and toilets are always clean :) Purple MRT line to Harbourfront (there is a smaller shopping centre right next to it called Harboufront which is connected to Vivo City)"
,,One of the famous malls,5.0,,"Vivo city mall is one of the famous malls of Singapore.It is very well connected and can be reached by MRT or Taxi or Bus. Pleasantly made and beautifully maintained..The third floor of this mall lets you enter the whole new world of Sentosa island and Universal Studio by travelling through the famous Sentosa express.It is the only link from the city to the sentosa island through train, as the sentosa express starts and end here.. Its a great experience to see yourself travelling over the sea. Vivo city has all the famous brands ."
,,One of the main shopping malls,3.0,,"even though there is nothing special about the shopping mall experience, the view from the top in evening is nice...especially the view of sentosa island and the marina.."
,,It's another Western Mall,5.0,,Lots of western shops and boutiques that wouldn't look out of place in Paris. The big improvement over UK malls is the outstanding cleanliness. Top marks to whomever banned chewing gum in public places.
,,Another modern mall,5.0,,There's a plethora of malls or shopping complexes in Singapore. Vivo City is the mall you must go through if you're bound to Sentosa Island. There's a food court on the top floor (prices are not always reasonable...)
,,shopping paradise,5.0,,I stayed at geyland hotel and I took the bus 100 direct go to this shopping complex. Wow the amazing thing is I could take the LRT from vivo city to Sentosa. This shopping complex full of the thing that you could shop from morning till night.
,,Heaven on Earth...,5.0,,"VivoCity evokes a lifestyle experience that is modern, stimulating and accessible to everyone, a place bubbling with energy and flowing with vitality.VivoCity's iconic architecture sets it apart from the traditional box format of many retail developments in the region as it includes event spaces, al fresco dining by the 300 m long Promenade and a large roof-top amphitheatre. The Sky Park has been a popular place for all walks of life since its opening. The Play Court and the open spaces in the mall are popular with families and children.The Sky Park has an Amphitheatre and was where the grand opening was held. It is also a place popular to view Sentosa. Some hold picnics in the mall's outdoor space as well.The mall has Singapore's largest cinema multiplex with 15 screens and 2,172 seats by the cinematic company Golden Village, along with one of the largest cinema screens in Asia.There are two giant food courts Kopitiam Group and BreadTalk Group. Other features include a True Fitness gym, spas, restaurants and dance clubs. Finally Vivocity is well connected to the city and the nearest resort ""Resorts world sentosa"". That's all from me. Adios"
,,Shopping galore!,5.0,,"So easy to get to this mall with the HarbourFront MRT station located in the mall itself. The place is massive and unfortunately we only had a couple of hours to spare here. Could easily spend a whole day browsing and enjoying the activities available. Apparently there are 3 malls connected together. Wow!

Try the Republic foodcourt. It's tucked away but goodness me, what a good looking foodcourt! Lovely wooden tables and chairs, everything is really clean. Nice food too.

You can also get the cable car or train from here to Sentosa Island. And there's also a ferry/ cruise terminal on one of the levels!"
,,Shopping and Entertainment on a Grand Scale,4.0,,"Even by Singapore standards this is shopping and entertainment on a grand scale. There is a huge range of shops that cover a very wide range of different price ranges and includes department stores and a large hypermarket for every day requirements. There is a cinema complex, countless restaurants and food stalls and Vivo is the gateway to Sentosa Island.
Easy to access by subway or bus and a plentiful supply of taxis."
,,The world of shops,5.0,,"Well I know Singapore has lots of shops but I do not think you will get a better views of busy Singapore .on one side you have the busy docklands the middle you have universal studios then the casino ,cable cars overhead and finally some huge cruise liners this can all be seen from many restaurants looking over the water you can pass the day or night there oh I forgot the monorail going back and forth ."
,,Trendy shopping mall with reasonably priced shops on the sea front,4.0,,"Nice, trendy shopping mall with great choice of restaurants and a very good food court. Good place to have a glass of wine and watch the world go by whilst partner is shopping"
,,Great place for kids to spend the day!,4.0,,"If you have kids and you want to bring them to a mall in Singapore, Vivo City is the place to go. It has a good combination of playground and shopping. My kids absolutely love the place.

On the top level, there is an shallow outdoor pool that is good for children to engage in some water place. When they are bored, bring them one level down where they can play with more water and some interesting swings and slides.

On level two there are some good shops selling interesting stuff for kids. Parents can do some shopping there. Should the weather turn bad, kids can explore Toys R Us. For kids who like the various modes of transport, they can take either the monorail or cable car to Sentosa.

While the mall does not boost of any high end shops, it certainly has a good mix of shops.

There are many restaurants as well. I recommend Black Society and Jpot. I am sure others can add to the list."
,,Vivo City shopping,4.0,,"Reasonable sized mall Did not come across any proper restaurant for dining, saw coffee shops mainly They do not have international designer boutiques"
,,big mall with very nice roof area,5.0,,"Find Everything I need here. Charles and Keith, check! Giant, Check! Cold Storage, check! halal food place, check! a big open spaces for enjoying the air and go picnic, check! movie theater, check! you name it! it's a really big mall and you can burn your calories by walking around this mall alone."
,,Retail Extravaganza!,5.0,,If you like shopping - Vivo City is the place to go in Singapore. You can spend more than a full day at this centre.
,,Big mall with lots to see,4.0,,"This mall is just along the MRT line, with plenty of places to see and shop. I love the National Geographic boutique here!"
,,I Love this place,4.0,,"I love thisplace, we enjoy our fams vacation in here ! Food are great, and we can go to sentosa island with cablecar from here"
,,Nothing very exciting,4.0,,"I came across this shopping mall while on my way to take the monorail to Sentosa Island.

This mall is best reached using the MRT as it is connected to the Harbour Front MRT station. Despite its tag as Singapore's largest retail and lifestyle destination, it has nothing more than the usual outlets that you will find in any shopping mall - supermarket, department store (Tangs), cinema, specialty coffee outlets ( Coffee Bea and Starbucks), sporting goods outlets, etc.

One interesting feature, though, is its Promenade where you could see the Sentosa Island."
,,A shopper's paradise,4.0,,"Whenever we are on holiday in Singapore, we always manage to find our way to Vivo City. As a rule, we generally know which of the hundreds of stores to head for. That is not to say we do not just wander around. We do, but not as much as the first time we visited a number of years ago. One store that is on our list is M&S. Unfortunately, this is the nearest store to us, here in Melbourne. Although they are not as cheap as the British stores, at least they do stock some of the items we cannot buy elsewhere.
As we always use a travel card while we are in Singapore for their excellent public transport system, Vivo City is only a bus ride away from out hotel. The bus stop is right outside the hotel, so we do not have to walk far at all. We can save our energy for shopping.
With many places to eat and drink, any visitor can rejuvenate themselves for more shopping. As a rule, we try to eat in the food court on the bottom level. As with most Singapore food courts, they are far cheaper than certain other fast food outlets. The only downside being they are always busy."
,,Lots of shops but avoid peak hours,4.0,,"A mall with lots of shops for all ages. Cotton On, Tangs, MotherCare, Toys'R Us and even Daiso!
Traffic to car park can be quite bad during peak hours, with many drivers cutting into the lanes by taking the ""to Sentosa"" lanes. Keep calm stay cool and just endure...you'll still get a parking lot with > 7 stories of car park.
Xmas tree on Level 3 this year is so beautiful....just sit outdoors and take in the sunset...watch cable cars and just relax."
,,Good,3.0,,Nice and happening area but the worst area to get a cab from vivo. We had to wait for almost an hour just to get a cab to kg bharu which is approximately 10 to 15min away from vivo.
,,cool place to cool off,4.0,,"Just a short sail from batam, next to harbour front, with mon8rail access to sentosa resort, and many things in between, vivo is a place to have fun, if you feel like gambling or just to visit universal & enjoy the resort, just hop on the monorail, or explore the vivo itself ,have snacks or local food at food republic or spkash some water at the splash pool on the boardwalk"
,,The Usual Shopping Mall,3.0,,"Unlike the shoppes at Marina Bay, Vivo City has much more affordable stores. What separates this Mall from the others is the broad walk. You can see the sentosa island and the Singapore cable car crossing. It's best to enjoy the view during sunset."
,,Paradise For Shopaholic,4.0,,"A very huge shopping center with bunch of choices. You could spend your evening here after you come back from Sentosa Island because monorail station starts & ends at Vivo City (3rd floor). If you get lost, proceed to Information Table, the staffs are very friendly to assist you."
,,The best mall in Singapore,5.0,,"If you like shopping then you will love Vivo City. Even if you don't you will find the views from the board walk and the roof top worth the visit. Vivo City is our favourite mall in Singapore and is extremely popular with the locals too.

While extremely large Vivo City has more pedestrian brands than other malls such as the Orchard Ion. That said you will find a wide range of stores and products as well as eateries. You can easily spend a day wandering around the mall and purchase almost anything you can imagine. Big name brands include Uni Qlo, Ted Baker, Lacoste, Toys R Us and Gap, but there's a lot of specialty shops and some great little places to grab a snack. There is a good food court in the basement level.

Toilets facilities and clean and well maintained and there are plentiful baby change rooms.

The roof top park is well designed and thought out and there are out door play areas for children.

The roof top is also the location of the booking office for Sentosa Island and also where you can catch the Sentosa Express. Be warned on weekends and public holidays people going to and from Sentosa can overwhelm the escalators and make getting in a little tough. However this is mainly during the morning and late evening.

Getting there is easy on the MRT - just take the purple line to Harbour Front."
,,Viva Vivo!,5.0,,"Singapore's largest retail and lifestyle destination, Vivo City, is a must for all visitors. Great views of Sentosa Isand, is the home of Singapore Cruises, and over 300 specialty retail shops and 70 restaurants, this shopping city within a city is a paradise of surprises.
Take the escalator to just one of the Daiso retail stores in Singapore, watch a movie in one of the 15 cinemas in Singapores largest multiplex featuring the widest cinema screens in Asia.
The day I was visiting there were crowds of people lined up for the Sentosa monorail and I was unaware that about 35,000 people were making there way over to Sentosa for the Bird Man Rally event!
Therefore, the crowds and congestion throughout Vivo City was enormous, and a half hour wait for the mono rail ruled that out, and headed for a taxi to Sentosa.
No surprises here, long lines waiting for taxis, but at least they were coming and going fairly quickly, so waited probably about 20 minutes for the taxi, in what was one of Singapores hottest days as well.
Visited the cruise terminal and the Superstar cruise liner Virgo (that doe's trips to Malaysia, and Phuket) was at the terminal due to depart on it's next cruise. There are great views of the Cable Car and Skytower and Sentosa, and enjoyed the shops on all levels.
This is a very modern shopping centre with escalators everywhere, and shops like Carls JR Burgers, Quiksilver, Rip Curl, Daiso, and many others.
Vivo City has the 'Celebration Of Art In Life', designed by acclaimed Japanese architect Toy Ito, Vivo City is an architectural icon inspired by it's waterfront location. On display are over 13 extraordinary art pieces by six international artists specially commissioned to represent the vibrancy and vitality of Vivo City. Information provided by the information desk!
James Bond 007 latest movie 'Skyfall' had a special display that was very good and attracted a lot of attention.
The mall also features waterfront restaurants, was in the process of installing Singapores largest christmas tree, there is an outdoor Skypark and open air interactive Play Court for the kids.
Great place to visit when in Singapore. Taxi fare to Vivo City around $10SGD from most parts of city area.
After a visit to Vivo City you can make a quick trip by taxi or monorail to Resorts World Sentosa and take in all the excitement of Universal Studios, the casino, and various attractions there.
The monorail is free, and stops at several stations and returns to Vivo City. Runs continuously but at weekends expect long lines of people waiting for the monorail at both Vivo City and Sentosa stations.
Highly recommended to all tourists in Singapore, liked it very much."
,,If you stay in sentosa this is a must,5.0,,Love this mall it's huge great array of shops restaurants beauty therapies etc also chemist and supermarket. Easy way of spending half a day here if its raining
,,It's a mall...,4.0,,"OK, if you like malls, you'll love this one. I guess, because I'm not really into malls. The selection of restaurants outside is quite nice."
,,A Good Mall,3.0,,"Vivo City is a good mall with some nice varied shops. However there isn't very much to differentiate it from other similar malls. It is well situated just off from Sentosa and is home to the mainland Sentosa Express monoral station. Here you will also find easy access to taxies to take you anywhere else in the country. The mall isn't the easiest to navigate around and can be a little confusing at times. Some boutique shops are well priced with a good selection of items to browse. Vivo city is alos home to the Singapore Ferry and Cruise terminal. If you arrive in Singapore via a cruise this would be an excellent place to start your Sinagpore holiday.

The toilets were very well maintained and cleaned. Staff were helpful and friendly. The mall also offered a tourist discount voucher book that could be collected from the information counters around the mall. This offer discounts at certain retailers and also at key attractions around Singapore (including the Sinagpore Zoo and Sentosa attractions). You will need your passport or driving license to obtain this voucher book and ""I Love Vivo City badge"".

The setting and location of the mall is gorgeous and within easy access of Sentosa Island via the Boardwalk. However, otherwise this is a pretty standard shopping mall."
,,"Great Shopping Centre, But Very Busy",4.0,,"Good range of shops, excellent food court and restaurants. Plus there are usually lots of promotional events on at the weekends."
,,Much like many of the other shopping centers in Singapore,3.0,,"This location can be found at the last MRT station (Harbourfront), and the gateway access to Sentosa Island.
This is yet another shopping center that I'll somewhat frequently visit if in Singapore. It does have many of the same stores that you can find at equally large shopping malls like Ion Orchard, or Bugis, but it's still nice to browse around if in the area or just looking for a place to shop at.
Retailers like Zara, Quiksilver, Levis, Rip Curl, Coach, and Calvin Klein can all be found here along with my favorite bakery, Breadtalk. There are also a great number of restaurants to choose from if getting the munchies and in need of a meal or snack.
There's also a movie theater on the second floor at one end as well as an array of places to eat on the basement level right after getting off the MRT.
A good place to shop though."
,,Great shopping and roof top views,5.0,,"Billed as Singapore‚Äôs largest retail destination, Vivo is located on the harbour front a few minutes from the city centre by taxi or train. Of the seven or more shopping centres we visited in Singapore I spent the most at Vivo ‚Äì on clothes and gifts. It is worth a visit to the rooftop sky park for views across to Sentosa Island."
,,Spacious & good for strollers,4.0,,"Large mall which is good for kids and strollers. The food court in the basement has halal and non-halal sections separated by a wall. There is a kids playground (outside) and upstairs and fountain/water feature that people walk around in (though not sure you are meant to?!). It is stroller friendly from the Harbourfront MRT. All the usual shops plus a Giant supermarket (good selection at good/medium range prices), Camper shoes, Zara, etc. Lots of restaurants with a view to Sentosa Island and over the water which range from fancy/night-out to family friendly."
,,"Good view, family place",4.0,,The family and I so enjoy going to vivo city. The food Court on the 3rd floor is good and the children can run around outside in the water features on the roof. Shopping can be hair raising with the crowds but the parking is convenient. Worth it to go there for a wander.
,,fun place to shop,5.0,,great number of shops to cater all categories of people... a lot of impressive products in the mall shops...the arge supermarket is a great place for good deals.. we stopped by in the shops on the way to sentosa island...the best way to reach sentosa...you get some amazing singaporean and malay food in the food court in the basement..fresh food..also enjoyed a visit to the pet store ..
,,Good,4.0,,Convenience and food are easily available. But nothing to be impress of. Accessible by MRT or bus. The place is packed with people during weekend
,,Excellent shopping,5.0,,"Whatever you want, you should be able to get it at Vivo City! There are shops for everyone and it's a great bustling, but comfortable environment. It's very handy for Sentosa Island and probably the first place you'll want to stop if you're staying on the island and coming over to the mainland. It's a great place to get something to eat as well as there are plenty of places to choose from."
,,Shopping and food court is good,5.0,,You catch the MRT to Harbour Front and get off and there you are in Vivo City shopping centre. Great for food in the food court.
,,Waterfront,4.0,,"plentiful of food choices, good shopping place albeit some being pricey, but overall a good shopping destination. the waterfront overlooking Sentosa Island is a nice place to chill at night."
,,Good concept of bay mall,4.0,,"I like this mall for the location in the harbourfront. Located above mrt, have monorail, bus, and cable car to sentosa. Have very good view on the top of the mall."
,,excellent,5.0,,this is one place where i visited 3-4 times during my stay to singapore my id loved the terrace area of vivicity and even mall is excellent
,,"Huge shopping centre, great location",4.0,,"Vivo City is just massive, it has a range of shops from a giant supermaket (it's actually called Giant), and a huge range of clothing, shoes, a cinema and food outlets etc.
It is situated at the Harbour Front (end of the North East line on the MRT, very easy to get to) and has a lovely outdoor area right on the water which looks out to Sentosa.
We found Vivo City was not as high end and suited those of us not wanting all of the expensive designer labels you find at Marina Sands, it's more like the average shopping mall found in Australia and caters to the average shopper and family oriented. There are many outlets you would commonly find in Australia including a Gloria Jean's around almost every corner."
,,Great Place to Stop Off before Senstosa but its not the best mall in singapore,3.0,,"have visited this mall a few time son the way to sentosa, its in a great spot as you can have a little shop around whilst you wait for the train to sentosa. the mall itself is nice and clean and has plantly of shops but its not the best range in singapore. it has plenty of western mainstream retail. worth a quick browse whilst your waiting for the train"
,,Gateway to Sentosa,4.0,,"Fairly new, Vivo is located far from Orchard Road. It should be visited however by those heading to Sentosa as the mall serves as link to the island.

Stores-wise, Vivo does not have much designer stores but it excels in being a family mall. There is a cute pet store inside the mall where you can see dogs being trained. Really a refreshing view to watch. There is also a lot of variety of food offered. One should not be bored in Vivo. It has a lot going on."
,,Proximity to Sentosa,4.0,,"Location is the most vantage point for Vivo City. Its on the edge of Sentosa and the mono rail for Sentosa starts in Level 3 of Vivo City. The retail outlets are not much to talk about, just good.
Food outlets are a plenty with also a good number of fine dining restaurants too. Have been to Go India and the buffet is very affordable at 22 SGD++."
,,Viva Vivo,4.0,,"Vivo City is a good shopping centre, it links up from the MRT train station and then you can access Sentoosa Island. Therefore the area has lots to do, starting with the shops and then there is the views towards the sea."
,,attraction at its best for the family,5.0,,"At Vivo City, you can bring your children to stroll and play around. There's a secure place for your children to play with water or walk or run around. There's also a shopping place. Name it and Vivo City has it. I love this place. It's also near train station."
,,HUGE!!!,5.0,,"This shopping centre is massive! Its has everything, shops, restaurants, movie theatre and kids play area. It is one of my favourite malls in the world! It is so huge it can be daunting but if you have lots of time you will be very happy. It has every shop you could want and also has lots of fast food, coffee shops and restaurants. The malls right on the water so its very beautiful and a great way to spend a day. You can easily take the tram to Sentosa from the top level of the mall. I highly recommend this as a shopping destination in Singapore."
,,ViVo,4.0,,Signage good. Food at food court average. Great to see ferry dock and cruise ships. Good view of sea and sentosa
,,Almost too big,4.0,,"Is it possible to have too much shopping? Vivo is huge, clean and accessible, but a little daunting given its size. Where to start? the food court is good, but crowded, so it's hard to get a seat. Overall a nice day out, but for those of you with a Y chromosome, perhaps too much?!"
,,"This is a very, very big shopping mall",4.0,,"This is a very, very big shopping mall that has virtually everything you need under one roof. No need to go to Orchard Road unless you are after high end designer clothes, even then, I'd probably go to the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. Vivo has virtually everything you need. Apart from the normal range of shops, there is a huge range of dining options. One of the sushi places, always seem to have long queues of people waiting to get in. There's also a good supermarket. Harbourfront MRT and lots of buses service Vivo. A short monorail ride or an easy 10 minute walk to Sentosa."
,,A big mall near Sentosa,4.0,,This is a big mall near the Sentosa. You can reach this place if you're staying inside the resort via the monorail connecting Sentosa and the Resorts World Sentosa and the Vivo City. It has numeous food outlets and shopping choices for the serious shopper. I recommend this place if you're in town.
,,one place for everything,5.0,,"so if you stayed in the sentosa, and you feel like lazy to go to the city, but you need to do some shopping, this is the place where you can find almost everything.
They have cinemas, lots of foods, shopping arcade, and a really good surrounding."
,,big-big very big,5.0,,oh my god this place is too big...too many things...but expensive to hang out frequently me....sometimes i go there i my self dunno what to do...to big so many shops...shops...shops...creative way it was build...and its the biggest mall in singapore!!!!i guess whatever you want you can get it here!!! legal stuff i mean hahaha
,,No ordinary mall!,5.0,,"I disagree with a previous reviewer that a mall is a mall is a mall etc. This is NOT the usual boring box-shape and is aesthetically pleasing: Of course it is Japanese-designed. Interesting water features, sculptures and playgrounds adorn the exterior. Two food courts - one next to the Sentosa Express (top level) and one in the basement as you get out of the MRT. Good cheap eats. Loads of cafes and restaurants in between as well. The mall is not exclusively high end brand names and some bargains can be had - look out for Daiso - everything S$2 .... decent (Japanese) quality. (There is another one in the B4 level of Ion, Orcahrd Rd) I dare you to emerge having bought NOTHING! The only downside is that it is quite easy to get lost - the mall is not a uniform box shape and the levels seem to snake all over the place!"
,,Best place to shop,5.0,,"If you go to Singapore for shopping this is one of the better places to go, The mall at the MBS is nice but this is great for those who are not worth millions of dollars."
,,All-in-one mall,5.0,,"Vivo City is one of the biggest malls in Singapore. The layout and design of the mall is such that it's very open and spacious, so it has an ""enormous"" feel to it, but essentially it's just walking from one stretch to the other. So even at times when the mall is thronging with people, you won't feel claustrophic.

Unlike Orchard Road, which has numerous designer shops, Vivo City is a mall which has a pretty good balance of shops catering to different needs and budgets. Good to come during June-July season, when the Great Singapore Sale is on, one might enjoy some nice discounts here!

You can also find numerous dining opportunities here as well, depending on the budget. You are really spoilt for choice on what to eat! So many different cuisines to choose from!!! Depending on where you choose to dine at, you can get a nice view of Sentosa Island too, namely the Resorts World Sentosa. Be it in the afternoon, evening or at night, the views are simply stunning! A wonderful complement to a sumptuous meal! =D

This mega-mall is also located near Sentosa Island, another tourist destination. From Vivo City itself, one can take the Sentosa Express (this mini-train) that takes you straight into Sentosa, or you can choose the walk across via the Boardwalk!

The mall is quite family friendly too, the roof has this play area for the kids. There is a playground, there is a mini-pool too. While the kids roam and have fun, parents can catch their breaths at the rest areas nearby.

Vivo City is very convenient to get to, it sits right above Harbourfront Station (take the Purple or Yellow Line); loads of parking space available but best to come early. I've been coming here for years now, and i never get tired of it!"
,,Best mall experience in Singapore,4.0,,"Vivocity mall proved to be an all-in-one mall. Very good architecture, extremely spacious, gentle on the ears and easy on the money. Although a lot of expensive stores are there, but you have your choices. All five floors are unique and the top floor had the cinemas. The cinemas are ok, I would say that it was a bit of a time-waster for me. Since we don't have Carl's Jr. where I live, we were delighted to have that whenever we went there. People will children will definitely love to go there, as it provides a lot of activities for kids.

All in all, its a good mall and if anyone has ample, they should definitely go see it."
,,My kind of mall in Singapore,4.0,,"After all the designer retail stores in Orchard, we were glad to have finally found a mall that was kind to our wallets. We were afraid even to look at all the retailers along Orchard for the fear that one purchase would make us sit on the edge of the streets of Singapore with nothing to eat or do until our departure. We dropped by after our trip to Universal Studios. Took the Sentosa Express to get to this mall.

A lot of stores here with reasonably priced merchandise. Loved the food court at the top floor. Everything just looks delicious. Near the entrance of the food court is this small kiosk that sells some souvenirs which I gladly bought to save me the trouble of taking another trip somewhere for cheap souvenirs. 24 key chains for 10 SGD, 3 tshirts for 10 SGD, etc. Show your passport at the information counter and get a tourist pack (a card that will give you discounts with participating retailers). Most of the stores were on sale when we went so it was a bonus for us."
,,A good combination of restaurants and shops with some childrens' entertainment thrown in,4.0,,This shopping mall was a pleasant change from the purely designer malls of Hong Kong and KL. There were also a number of interesting restaurants and a childrens' play area. The giant supermarket also stocks some organic fruit pouches which also retail in the UK which was useful.
,,VIVO,5.0,,"Loved this place everything under one roof, Transport every 20 minuted fro Shanrila, picked up some real bargains.."
,,Best part of Sentosa Island,5.0,,This is not on Sentosa Island but it is the monorail station (somethign free in Singapore!) on the mainland. Give Sentosa a miss - just anothertourist trap. It is not the cheapest shopping but the stores are fantastic and you will find things there tha tyou will not find anywhere else.
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,Largest shopping complex in Singapore (as of 2011). Awesome play centres and outdoor area for kids as well. It links to the monorail to Sentosa Island. Great views of Sentosa. Great place.
,,A mall is a mall is a mall.......,3.0,,"Yes it's huge. Yes there are hundreds and hundreds of shops and eating places, but somehow, it was just another mall."
,,Interesting centre worth a visit,5.0,,Lots of nice shops and many in the affordable range. Lots of eating places. Also little kids entertainment. Top floor is amazing. A huge roof top garden and water paddle area. Roof top sounds small. This place was huge. Like a football field size. Nice bay and habour views and of Sentosa island. Nice lights and colours at night. Affordable foods will bring me back here for sure. One can only love singapore more for places like Vivo city.
,,Big but....,3.0,,"Okay, so this mall is big. But it's still too crowded! Nothing special to see here, typical brands you can see in other countries (Marks and Spencer, Esprit, Mothercare, Tommy Hilfiger, etc...)"
,,More than a shopping mall,4.0,,"One of the best Shopping Malls in Singapore, Vivo City connects you alao to Sentosa Island by Monorail. Many very nice restaurants and shops"
,,Beautiful mall,4.0,,"Coming from Sentosa Island, we took the cable car to HarbourFront and walked to Vivo City. It is a big shopping mall with a lot of interesting shops, like the National Geographic. The food court was made out to look like the early 1900's so it's got some character not usually associated with such eateries. Convenient too as it has access to an MTR station."
,,A Big Mall; Nice View of Sentosa Island.,3.0,,"A mall, is a mall, is a mall. There are some good deal (I picked up some postcards) but it's not so different from a mall you'd find in the United States. They have a permanent set up for wedding planning on the ground floor which was definitely unique. There were several restaurants to choose from and of course it's air conditioned so that is as good a reason as any to make a stop here. There are some nice views of Sentosa Island from the Sentosa Boardwalk so you can get some nice pictures and it's walking distance if you actually wanted to pay to go to Sentosa for gambling or an amusement park type of vibe. Overall, not a bad place to spend some time to take a break from the heat!"
,,Spend 1 day at Vivocity,4.0,,"Singapore's biggest shopping mall. Can spend 1 complete day there as there are shops, push carts, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, open spaces. Great for shopping, chilling out or just browsing and giving yourself a great workout walking all over the place."
,,Megamall!,4.0,,"Vivo City is conveniently linked to Sentosa Island via the Sentosa Express tram system which takes you out of the island and plonks you right on Vivo City's lively doorstep. Most stores here open from 10am and kick on right until 10pm+, so that makes it perfect for tourists who want to take it easy in the mornings.

There are five floors featuring all manner of stores, from electronics to clothing to beauty parlors. If you can't find it at Vivo City, you aren't looking hard enough. Thankfully, there is a Vivo Mart on the lowest level, which is great for grocery shopping for anyone staying on Sentosa for a protracted amount of time.

The mall itself is well presented and connects to another shopping mall, the slightly smaller Harborfront Mall. When I say it's connected, I mean literally. Blink and you'll think you're still in Vivo City!

The prices aren't anything to write home about and are standard fare. If you're looking for bargains, you're in the wrong place."
,,Great Roof Concept,4.0,,"The mall has a roof deck that has a view of Sentosa Island and its boardwalk. I liked staying there late in the afternoon for the sunset whilst waiting to go over Sentosa in the evening. Many locals go there to dip their feet in pools of water. Just a place to relax and chill.
The next lower level has an open air playground for children. The foodcourt was also great. Easilly accessible by bus and the MRT which has a station in the basement."
,,huge and confusing,5.0,,"Another massive shopping mall, but this one has a pretty fabulous food court. Great for sunset the one of the place that you must visit when visiting Singapore."
,,Nice place,4.0,,"Two malls in one and very baby friendly. I love the Coffee Club that is in Harbourfront which is the mall that is directly connected to Vivo City/. These two malls have so many things to see and do...so many places to eat, and so on. It is a great place to go on a hot and boring weekend. If you have a baby, there are quite a few places to change his/her diapers and breast feed him/her if you need. Suggestion: Harbourfront is easier on babies as it is much quieter!"
,,Favourite mall in Singapore!,5.0,,"I was recommended this mall by a local Singaporean who does all her shopping here. Much better price point than expensive Orchard Road. The Food Republic was excellent with tons of choice and lots of seating. Very enjoyable way to spend several hours. HarbourFront MRT stop is in the basement and we loved the scenery outside, a peaceful respite from the air-con and people."
,,A shopping mall which suits all pockets.,4.0,,"Vivo City is right by the harbour front and the gateway to the attractions of Sentosa. The views of the harbour and the waterfront is well worth stepping outside the air con interior with plenty of dining options on offer. (Also the docking area for the cruise ships). Inside, the mall is divided up into 5 floors, the lower floor having the MRT connection. This mall is very popular with tourists and Singaporeans as the shops are well within the pocket range to entice buyers unlike the designer malls on Orchard. Good food courts, well known coffee shops and rest areas. Like most malls it opens from 10.00am to 10.00pm."
,,Lots of shopping option,4.0,,"Wonderful shopping venue. Big, open halls and many shop to choose from."
,,good range of shops and fantastic food court,5.0,,"Great range of both medium and high end shops Great atmosphere. Lots of restaurants within the mall, but there are 3 huge food courts- our favourite's the food republic. Great decor. Easy access via MRT (Harbourfront station) and you can reach sentosa island via Sentosa express, all located within the mall. If you stay in Capella like we did, you get half hourly shuttle that drops you to the mall!"
,,Not a dull moment - great shopping and board walk,4.0,,"I found Vivo City to offer a very broad selection of shops and brands for all budgets. They have an M&S (funny to see this outside of the UK) and a Zara, which sold...winter fashion. There is a Tangs and an Armani Exchange and much, much more, including many restaurants of which I tried two that were quite good.

Vivo City is easily accessible by metro (Harbour front station on the North East line). I spent some time there on my way to Santosa island, which can be reached via the Monorail that departs from the 3rd level of Vivo city or via the boardwalk."
,,SHOP AHOLIC,5.0,,We got lost so many times but it was fun and a laugh i cannot beleive the shops in this place is a dream. Not everything is expensive here i got so many bargains and the food choices heaven
,,Shopping by the Harbourfront,5.0,,"There are a plethora of malls in Singapore, some with a few anchor stores and a small variety of stores mixed with a few mega malls that has almost all the big names.

Vivo City which opened in 2006 is a humongous mega mall. Located at Harbourfront in the vicinity of Sentosa, it is nice to be out shopping away from the Orchard Road area.

Vivo City is one of the largest malls in Singapore, it also has the largest cinema toy store in Singapore too. In fact we did quite a bit of toy shopping at Toys r Us as they had a sale on. There are an array of stores ranging from low end to high end fashion shopping as well a hypermarket for food shopping.

It has an interesting design from the outside to make it standout in Singapore and it was heaving at the time of our visit."
,,Great shopping and great view,4.0,,"Lots of interesting stores can be found in this mall. The access from MRT (Harbourfront) is fast and easy. This is also a departure point for ferries so the mall is very complete. There's also a nice restaurant that overlooks the sea.

One of the better malls in Singapore."
,,Meeh,3.0,,"Its a so so place, personally i don't see it that much different than many other malls, i prefer Jurong Point Mall because it was closer to my location and not worth the time it took to go to Vivo. The mall is like any other big mall in Singapore, but u should definitively check it out if u plan on doing a lot of shopping."
,,Well worth a visit.....,4.0,,"I enjoyed Vivo City but,unfortunately,not as much as my wife !
Its Singapore's biggest shopping mall and located near the harbour front just a few minutes train ride from the island of Sentosa.
There are many many shops and restaurants in this mall for you to peruse.
Shops like Zara,Topman/Topshop/Forever21,crocs,Armani,Calvin Klein,Marks & Spencer etc.
Plenty of reasonably priced restaurants,as well,some with lovely views over the water.
Food Republic,on the 3rd floor,does excellent Hawker food at a decent price.
On the 2nd floor,Pacific Coffee does delicious cakes and pastries as well as drinks.
It has comfortable sofas,views looking out over the harbour and free internet access for customers.
To get to Vivo City on the MTR from central Singapore you go to the Harbour Front Station and the Vivo City mall is only a few minutes walk away.
You can easily spend half a day here and its well worth the visit,in my opinion."
,,"Huge, great, but still able to improve.",3.0,,"Vivo City isn't really an attraction. It is a shopping centre, Singapore's biggest one in fact. However, since TripAdvisor does list 'shopping centres' under attractions, why not?

Vivo City opened in 2006 by Mapletree Property. I was amazed at the structural beauty and humongous interior of the shopping centre. Located at Harbourfront, the shopping centre may not be at the best location, but I don't think someone would put such a massive building somewhere in Orchard Road.

One common flaw among big shopping centres are its maps directories. Vivo City is no exception. It is bigger than an airport, and simply trying to find one outlet would take around ten to fifteen minutes if on that very floor. However, this is understandable, and at least they tried to make ends meet.

There is indeed a variety of outlets. From world-reknowned brands to small, start-up ones, Vivo City has them all. Containing the largest cinema in Singapore and the largest toy store too, it is no wonder why there are so many patrons at the shopping centre.

Other facilities include a small wade pool on the fourth floor that is not for swimming, an amphitheatre, a fairly decent playground. Three of the four big food courts of Singapore - Kopitiam, Banquet and Foodrepublic, are available at VivoCity, two of them even sharing the same space. A pet shop, video arcade and much more are available.

Despite this variety of shops, I still think the shopping centre is fairly decent, probably because it lacks that kind of feeling when one goes to a shopping mall. Nonetheless, I reccomend this 'attraction'."
,,Its a MALL people,4.0,,Vivo City is a mall with one of everything that you would find in pretty much every other mall on the planet. And therefore it isnt really an 'attraction' in my book. Having said this you want to have a break from the heat and a great selection of resturants topped by the fabulous hawkermarket/foodcourt that is Food Republic on the 3Flr. You cant go wrong with a trip into Vivo. Also the MRT train to Sentosa departs from here so if you were planning on a trip over Vivo is a good break in the aircon after a day out exploring.
,,One-stop Getaway,5.0,,It was a fabulous place that catered for my whole family. From my 68 year old mum to my 2 yr old nephew. We had an enjoyable time and ended up having both lunch and dinner there. Just went to show how much there was to see and do. Time sure flies when you're having a fun time. The wide range of shops and eateries had us going on a marathon. Imagine three extended families running rampage just to get the best deals in town. It's a sure top winner in my family for weekend gatherings.
