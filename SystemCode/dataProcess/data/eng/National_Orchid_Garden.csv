Smth new is currently being built nearby - so lots of construction noise.
Try to go in the morning as it is less crowded and less hot."
,,Simply Stunning,5.0,,Depending on when you visit the National Orchid Garden the displays vary - but the orchids on display are wonderful. I would suggest that you take your time and sit on the benches available and marvel at the colours of the flowers on display at the time of your visit.
,,Fabulous collection,5.0,,It takes several hours to comprehend all the different varieties and to fathom the complexity and breadth of this orchid collection. Highly encouraged. Set aside a day for the entire garden.

My 15 year old daughter loved it so suitable for all.
I am very glad I didn’t miss it."
,,A place to go,5.0,,"I visited the botanic garden and the orchid garden during a Saturday morning. Half a day is enough.

The Orchid garden is impressive.

You can walk & walk and discover the world of orchids reading many pannels that explains secrets of orchid ""production""."

,,Beautiful but parts of the garden were under renovation during our visit,4.0,,"Despite having visited Singapore and the Singapore Botanic Gardens on a number of previous occasions, this was our first visit to the National Orchid Garden. We were able to gain admission by using the attraction passes provided to us as part of our Singapore Airlines Holiday stopover package.
The varied displays of orchids were just magnificent. However, because we were there in the hottest and most humid part of the day, we needed to take things slowly and stay out of the sun as much as possible.
Under normal circumstances, I would have rated the garden as a 5 star attraction. However, at the time of our visit part of the garden was under renovation and this detracted slightly from the ambience of the garden.
If you have plenty of time, the 5 Singaporean dollars admittance fee would certainly provide you with good value. There are just so many beautiful varieties of flowering orchids to see."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,The National Orchid Garden cost about $5US and sits within the free Botanic Gardens. The flowers were magnificent and the grounds beautifully maintained.
,,Lovely and Peaceful,5.0,,"Easiest way to get to the Botanical Gardens is by MRT, exit from the staion takes you to the entrance of the gardens.
Lovely grounds to stroll around, beautiful trees and a couple of lakes to look at. Refreshments available in several places as you walk around.
Not only trees and shrubs to see, we saw lizards and otters in the lakes.

You have to pay to enter the National Orchid Garden, its costs less than £4 and reductions for seniors. There are some very pretty colours and displays to see depending on the time of the year.
Very popular with visitors are the photo shot spots, you may need to wait your turn to get in the photo spot but is usually worth the short wait.

Just a hundred yards from the Orchid Garden exit is a taxi rank if you do not wish to walk back to the MRT entrance, fairs for the taxi's are quite cheap if there are 3 or4 of you.

Well recommended for a few hours stroll.

,,Beautiful,4.0,,Hot and steamy singapore produces beautiful orvhids Cheap entry Not to crowded in morning Bit of a walk over 2kl there and back to mtr But lovely gardens with squirrels and monitors about Food and drinks through out
,,Orchid garden in Botanical Gardens,4.0,,"This Orchid garden is located inside Singapore Botanical Gardens. Although the Botanical garden has free access, the Orchid garden requires $5 to get entrance. Very beautiful,"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Such a huge range of beautiful orchids. Even the kids were impressed! We spent an hour there at 4pm and the humidity wasn’t actually too unbearable. We didn’t have time to wander through the rest of the gardens though.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"If you get a chance to come to the botanical gardens, then the orchid garden is a must. The varieties are many and make beautiful photography, there are some nice peaceful spots to just sit and enjoy the beauty, maybe try and come earlier as it gets quite humid and sweaty in the gardens.
Still a lovely couple of hours of walking around."
,,So many orchids,5.0,,"Beautiful place. There are a lot of Orchids there, but not all of them are labeled. I loved the old plantation house because it had orchids named for famous people or events. It was really interesting to read the history of certain types of orchids."
,,I am jealous,5.0,,So many beautiful orchids it was too hard to pick a favourite. I am very envious of so many different species that I will never have.
,,Largest collection ever - VIP Orchid Garden is,5.0,,"During your stroll through the Singapore Botanical Gardens a 1 hour visit to the National Orchid Garden is a must see. The botinical gardens are free, but for the Orchid garden a small fee needs to be paid. The garden contains the world largest and most diverse collection of Orchids. It is a beautiful walk with stunning photo opportunities. On the top of the hill a small building contains special VIP Orchids of Obama, Lady Di and several other presidents."
,,Breath-Taking,5.0,,"Despite some construction due to expansion, the garden was spectacular! Very beautiful and fun little nooks to explore all over the place. As the national flower of Singapore this is a must-see!"
,,One of a Kind?,5.0,,"You have to pay 5SGD to see the largest display of tropical orchids in the world (over 60s, 1SGD - check concessions!) - but it is worth it. After all, it is the only part of the Singapore Botanic Garden that is not free, so it probably subsidises the rest as well.

It can be mildly amusing to watch everyone avidly photographing the flowers - all amazing variations on a theme - just hoping to get at least some great pictures for the folk back home. There are so many! Orchids are rare in the UK, so it is wonderful to see so many different ones, but I don't think that many people would want to go back time and again. Once was great!

The three hectare orchid garden is certainly large enough for a visit in its own right, but it is surrounded by the Singapore Botanic Gardens, which a excellent, too.

The gift shop has some great souvenirs - even gold-plated orchid flowers!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,You must take the time to visit this spectacular orchid display. One of the world's orchid banks and you get a sense of the achievements being made in reproducing the gorgeous flowering plant.

The staff member at the information booth inside the gardens entrance was extremely helpful in suggesting where to go in the time we had available."
,,Humid but so very beautiful,5.0,,"Very much recommend visiting if you love orchids. We went in March and it was very humid, try and find out when it is less humid and travel then if you can. We got a bus directly there."
,,Sherin Nafie,5.0,,Beautiful gardens located inside Singapore Botanic Gardens. Admission is only S$ 5. I really enjoyed my morning walk amongst the colorful orchids. Highly recommend.
,,Amazing Orchids!,5.0,,"Ive been back to these gardens twice now and they never disappoint! This visit the weather was just pre storm so not too steamy and there was a little shade but if you struggle with the heat definitely come prepared with water, hat, umbrella and light weight summer clothing. The sun can be very hot and there is limited shade. The walk takes about an hour although if in a hurry you could see some orchids in half an hour. Its tricky to get to by MRT so we caught the MRT to Newton and then jumped in a taxi right to the door to save the long walk from the MRT through the gardens to the Orchids area. They seem to be building new display areas which look amazing on the plans so I have no doubt I will return for another visit next time I am in Singapore. Entry is only $5 which is extremely good value considering the number of beautiful flowers and displays on offer!"

Amazing orchids to be seen here that grow like weeds. It was a nice break from all of the concrete surroundings of downtown Singapore where we were staying. Stunning photos to be taken, but bring plenty of water as it is a bit of a walk and it gets very hot in the gardens. I honestly can't remember the entrance fee, but it was worth it as this is the largest garden of its kind in the WORLD. DO not miss out!"
,,National Orchid Garden,5.0,,If you are a gardener you will love a visit to these spectacular Gardens. Give yourself lots of time to meander between the various parts of this wonderful relaxing location.
,,A Mesmerising Beauty of a Garden,5.0,,"Singapore's National Flower is the hybrid orchid, VANDA MISS JOAQUIM, created by our early Armernian resident, AGNES JOAQUIM, born in Singapore. She passed away just before the turn of the 20th century. You will see this brilliant orchid, and other lovely ones, including VVIP orchids, in the Garden. Do not give the Garden a miss, as it has a mesmerising beauty that will instantly soothe the soul, and stay in your mind, for years to come."
,,beautyful and sheer pleasure to experience it.....!,5.0,,"Singapore's National Orchid Garden must be one of the best in the world. tidily kept and beautyfully manicured the Garden attracts tens of thousands from all over the world.

I went with my aunt and uncle, who are both very keen and knowledgeable gardeners. They were overwhelmed by the whole experience and were amazed when they saw varieties of Orchids that they had never seen before.

The walk around the whole garden was a very pleasant experience and, like I said before, I was impressed with the layout, cleanliness and atmosphere of the place.

Take time to visit the amazing shop."
,,Dazzling display,5.0,,"So psyched to see orchids (so many orchids!) in an outdoor garden, coming from a place where climate (and winters) make outdoor orchids an impossibility. This garden is a huge section of the larger Singapore Botanical Gardens. The orchid garden itself is so large that I got a bit lost (though there are helpful maps at pretty much every intersection of the paths). Highly recommended."

Lots to see and just take in all the beautifulness these beautiful flowers have to offer.
,,Awesome orchids,4.0,,This certainly wasn’t on our bucket list but it was included on a city tour. Absolutely no regrets.

,,Nirvana for orchid lovers,4.0,,"National Orchid Garden has the largest collection of orchid blooms (more than 60,000) in the world. We don't really know from orchids, but the variety is amazing; it seems that creating new hybrids is the thing to do, and many of the strains are named for dignitaries who visit Singapore, from Jackie Chan to Jane Goodall to Barack Obama."
,,One of my favourites!,5.0,,If you're a garden lover and love orchids.. This is a must! Their Orchid breeding program began in 1928. There's over 1000 species and 2000 hybrids. The display of these orchids is truly spectacular!

,,"Lush, elegant and uplifting orchids galore",5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is situated within the sprawling and lush Singapore Botanical Garden. There's also an orchid growing lab which one may visit or simply view through glass panels; with ample explanation of what's being conducted in the lab
Above all the orchids are amazingly beautiful and dignified.; with many new orchids being grown to reflect occasions or be named after eminent visitors
It tells history too, in this way and tells it in a gracious manner"

,,Special place....,4.0,,"Tucked away in the heart of the Botanic Gardens, the Orchid Garden is one of the exotic places to visit if you like flowers and don’t have the time or the money to pay big bucks at Flower Dome in Gardens By The Bay. It can be covered in 30 minutes, has an interesting mix of various Orchid species and several unusual ones. Photo opportunities are plenty and the place is pretty quiet most of the time.

,,A Unique Orchid Garden Worth Visiting,4.0,,"It is part of the Singapore Botanic Garden. I have been to the garden twice in the recent 2 years. It could take half a day if you wish to see every single detail. There are 13 highlights shown on the official guide map. We walked from Crane Fountain to Mist Garden and Silver Arches which provide good photo-taking opportunities. Later we went to Tiger Orchid Fountain and Heritage Orchid Display. A nice path to walk to arrive in Burkill Hall and VIP Orchard Garden. Celebrity Orchard Garden is another spot you should not miss. Finally, we passed Golden Shower Arches which provided us another instagrammable spot for photos before we left the Garden."
,,Beautiful walk with beautiful flora,5.0,,"We set aside half a day for this trip and it's a long walk to get there depending on where you're coming from, so I would highly recommend good walking shoes and a bottle of water. The garden itself is great for lovers of orchids as they're abundant and extremely well looked after. It wasn't crowded for us and it was a really nice refreshing walk. I would've loved to have seen more information on the different species and understand more about them but this is more of a garden, rather than a science centre."

,,Beautiful Botanic Garden,5.0,,"Being senior citizens, we received huge discount on the admission. The garden is beautifully laid out with all kinds of tropical flowers and foilage. I guess the park is so lush because Singapore is right on the equator so the city gets a lot of passing showers and plenty of heat and sunlight as well. This is much better than the other garden (the one with the lighted towers) that gets more press."

,,Excellent..,5.0,,A well maintained botanical garden which will surely benefit the botany students and all who love green and flower......
,,Absolute gem of the Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"We went to the Botanic Gardens having no idea this separate orchid garden existed. The main gardens are well worth visiting - they are well structured and there is a lovely tree top walkway.
Having stumbled upon the orchid gardens we decided to go in - on $5 (Singapore) to enter, so not a great impost.
They make a massive effort in the orchid gardens. Huge displays of orchids of many different varieties have been carefully built up by the gardeners. The orchid gardens are quite large with many displays so there has been a big investment by the gardens.
There is a large room that displays orchids named after prominent people visiting Singapore, and I was startled to see one named after Rodrigez Duterte, the Phillipines PM, who does not appear to have a lot in common with delicate flowers...
I would definitely return to visit both the Botanic and Orchid Gardens."

That aside the fee should be reduced or waived at present as a significant part of the garden is undergoing redevelopment so there is no access, hence the reduced score."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Fantastic orchids in a well laid out walking path. Don’t hurry. A few fun side paths. Nice gift shop

Each orchid has been so carefully and meaningfully selected. So, when you study it - it really says a lot about the person it is dedicated to.

The Orchid Gardens were undergoing some renovation and expansion works when I was there. Can't wait to return when its completed."

THe Botanical gardens themselves are free, and the small fee for the Orchid garden is well worth it, the orchids are just lovely - there's areas that tell you about their propagation and history, and the gardens are so well maintained. 10/10"
,,Orchids Galore,4.0,,"For tourists, a visit to Botanic Gardens has to include a trip to the National Orchid Garden (S$5 per adult). I am quite sure that they will rate it as a five star attraction.

So why am I not giving it five stars? Well, there were some enhancement works going on the day I visited and so I did not get to see everything that I was looking forward to see.

Apparently the following areas have been closed for enhancement works since 10 July 2017:
Mist House
Bromeliad Enclosure
Cool House
Orchidarium
They will reopen sometime this year 2019 (more reason not to give it a miss!)

Having said that, despite these closure, the National Orchid Garden is certainly still a must-visit especially if you are a tourist, and more so if you are a flower-lover type of tourist!

It's a beautiful place to see a whole spectrum of orchid species, including hybrids especially cultivated in honour of VIPs.

There's an air of serenity just walking around to admire everything in bloom.

Best time to visit is in the morning to avoid the sun. Bring along an umbrella in case you need to shield yourself from the sun or rain (Singapore's weather is unpredictable!).

Depending on how long you wish to admire the flowers, a visit can last from as short as half an hour to as long as an hour if you must scrutinize everything and snap photos everywhere!

Afterwards, adjourn to the gift shop located at the exit to buy some orchid themed souvenirs home. Note: even for those not visiting the National Orchid Garden, access to the gift shop is still possible at the entrance.

There are restaurants just outside the National Orchid Garden, with a kiosk selling drinks, light snacks as well. Toilets are on site too. Since it's a garden, wear comfortable walking shoes. The place is wheel-chair friendly (there are some steps within the grounds, but totally avoidable)."
,,Serene and spectacular,5.0,,These gardens are beautifully laid out to showcase the many orchid varieties and allow visitors to enjoy the tranquility of the gardens.
,,Fantastic and fascinating orchid garden,5.0,,This garden was well worth the small admission price. The rest of the amazing botanical gardens are free. The orcids are spectacular and the garden well set out and very beautiful. It was very quiet on a Monday afternoon. There are interesting boards about the orchids and how the Singapore orchid industry works to produce lovely commercial hybrids. Some of the area is under development at the moment so I'd love to visit again once these are completed.

,,Oasis of colour,4.0,,"This colour oasis in the botanic garden is definatley worth the $5.- entry fee. Beautiful beds with different orchids are arranged after different themes, such as a VIP strech, where Orchids have been named after significant people. The walkways are wheelchair and stroller friendly, and there are nice little spots to sit and observe the orchids. 4 stars because parts of the gardens where closed and I wish there were a few more signs to inform about Orchids, but maybe I just missed them all!"

,,"Beautiful, Great Varieties, Shady and Well Managed",5.0,,I am a plant person so it was especially fun for me to see varieties of orchids I have longed to see that won't grow in my area. The grounds are large and the design is well executed and beautifully maintained.
,,Must see in Singapore!,5.0,,"Near Orchard Rd the National Orchid Garden is also surrounded by an urban rain forest that includes a walking path and a walking path that leads thru urban gardens and open space perfect for a picnic lunch, people watching and dog walking. The fee to enter was $1 for seniors, free to locals. I believe it was $5 for others. The National Orchid Garden is spectacular. Vibrant colored orchids are displayed along walkways that wind around the park. Be sure to go into the display that has orchids named for visiting dignitaries and heads of state. There are benches along the way to rest and there is a gift shop at the gardens exit as well as a restaurant. The Gardens open early so to avoid the heat of the day go early or later in the afternoon as the gardens stay open later."
,,Second visit - it's that good!,5.0,,"If you visit the Botanic Gardens you must pay the entry fee ($5S or $1S if over 60) and wander through the amazing orchids. So, so beautiful. There is some renovation work going on, due to finish later this year but there is still plenty to see."

There is free admission to the gardens and only a small charge to enter the National Orchid Garden. It is 5 dollars for adults and only 1 dollar for over 65s.
The range and colours are amazing, I took so many photos.
The journey from Chinatown only cost £2 each way so an excellent was to have an enjoyable day leaving plenty of money for a great evening meal."

,,A Must See In Singapore,5.0,,"My husband and I took the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) to the Singapore Botanic Gardens from the Singapore Cruise Terminal. We walked through the Botanic Gardens to the National Orchid Garden (located inside the Botanic Gardens.) (Currently, there is a SMRT station under construction near the National Orchid Garden. Check to see if it is open when you go.)

The National Orchid Garden was beautiful! As time passed, more people crowded in, so it is recommended to go early.

Every inch of the National Orchid Garden is a delight for the eyes, with over 1,000 species and 2,000 hybrids. Fountains, arbors and stone work structures and statues are everywhere, between all of the orchids! Bring your camera, but beware you will take many, many shots!

The gift shop at the National Orchid Garden has an excellent selection of high quality and reasonably priced items.

Instead of walking back to the SMRT Botanic Gardens station, we took a taxi back to the cruise terminal. There were several signs directing you to where you can catch a taxi. We ended up at the main entrance for the National Orchid Garden. There is a button you push that signals to taxis on the main street that there are people who need a taxi. Allow yourself a lot of time, as empty taxis don't appear to drive by frequently. We actually took a taxi that was dropping someone off at the National Orchid Garden."
,,Never knew there were so many types of orchids,5.0,,Most of the paths in the garden are shaded so it is a nice place to stroll out of the sun. The varieties of orchids was really amazing! Every time I turned around I would find a new variety! Well worth the trip
,,Beautiful!!!!!!!,5.0,,"Within the grounds of the Botanical Gardens, this is beauty within beauty. Over 300 different species of the magnificent orchid to admire. There is a cost to enter $5 Singapore or $1 Singapore if you are disabled, or over 60. Good value and enjoyable."

,,Beautiful!,5.0,,Beautiful flowers in a wonderful park all for an incredibly low price. Would love to go again. Definitely a must see!
,,Magnificent gardens,5.0,,"Although some sections are still closed for renovations there is still plenty to enjoy in the gardens. The orchids are spectacular as there is such a variety of types with many different shapes and colour. There is so much more than Orchids to see and you could easily spend a day wandering the paths to different sections such as the Ginger gardens and the Rain forest with its massive trees.. There are a number of delightful sculptures such as the Flight of the Swans at Tang Lake. While we were here we watched an Otter at play and two large Monitor Lizards swimming close to the edge of the Lake. Other sculpture such as the Cranes, Farfugium Fountain, the Geese and Girl on a Swing are artfully placed around the gardens. The vegetation includes a huge variety of plants and trees so that the range of colour, bark and leaf types is quite fascinating. It is very peaceful and quiet which is surprising with its city location. There is a souvenir shop that contains a large range of gifts and mementos all at a reasonable price."
,,Orchids & Orchids,5.0,,Words cannot express how beautiful the garden is. It will be doing an injustice if one starts describing the Orchid garden.
,,Outstanding day,5.0,,"Beautifully maintained and a wonderful walk. We hiked there from Orchard Road Hilton even when it was warm, but enjoyed the trek. Lots to see. It is a combination of great botanical experience and exercise. We think younger children will tire a bit from the walk and be unimpressed with the spectacular flower displays. While they might wilt in the heat [however, there is lots of shade!], just keep their visit within the park to about an hour? Great gift shop of course :)"
,,beautiful,5.0,,"An orchid lover's paradise. So many different and beautiful varieties of orchids, it's almost dizzying. Ends in a hallway of arches covered with dancing ladies. Surreal."
,,Orchid Heaven,5.0,,"The beauty of this garden has to be seen to appreciate! The hybrid named blooms were a political, royalty, celebrity who’s who joy to behold. Everyone who is anyone has been to the Garden and had an orchid named after them. Unfortunately I was not blessed by this honor !"
,,Concentrated beauty,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden is easily accessible. Unbelievable variety of beautiful orchids. I don't think there is anything similar elsewhere in the world. Plan to spend at least an hour, better two, strolling around the convenient paths."

,,If you less than 70 years of age dont both,1.0,,"We HAD to pay for both observatories and only wanted the one for starters. Second, its a GARDEN people, nothing to do, less to see. Unless your excited about gardens. Which most of Singapore has and its free to see. Don't waste your time and money."
,,A lovely garden with quite a few variety of orchid.,4.0,,"It is a decent sized orchid garden with many variety of orchid and they have set up a few spots for photo shooting. But somehow lacks ""Wow"" factor, which I have seen in Dogashima Orchid Park in Izu, Japan. For quite sometime I have been seeing the renovation/construction work going on in certain parts of the Orchid Garden. I hope they can bring this ""wow"" factor in the newly renovated/constructed area. Yet people will definitely enjoy this garden. They have a section kept for newly developed orchids named after visiting VIPs like Queen, Princesses, and political figures."
,,Lovely garden to lose yourself in.,4.0,,"Small fee to see this lovely garden area inside the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Too many orchids to photograph all, amazing! Take your time to see all that is on offer in this garden space apart from the orchids. As with all of Singapore, take water, a hat, sunscreen & insect repellent."
,,This is a must if you visit Singapore,5.0,,Charge your batteries and make space at the memory card before you visit this atraction. Amazing orcids in all colors are waiting for your camera. It was verry hot the day I was there but in the orchid garden there are threes and shadow so it is pefect for a hot sunny day in Singapore.
,,Oasis of calm,5.0,,definitely worth a visit - go early morning or in the late afternoon as it can get very hot whilst walking around. Comfortable shoes and a hat is recommended. The whole gardens are immaculately kept and the orchid displays are stunning.
,,Very beautiful garden,5.0,,"Huge garden and beautiful place. Get water bottle with you, because there is lot of space to walk around."
,,You need to like Lilies/flowere,4.0,,Worth the small fee in. Plenty of photo opportunities and free in if you bring your student card. All ends with you in the gift shop.
,,Must be put on your list to visit,5.0,,"Set relatively centrally, this garden is beautiful and well worth the entrance fee. The botanical gardens are also awesome and many hours can be spent walking around them. You do not realise you are in the centre of the city."
,,Lovely garden,4.0,,"A very impressive garden well laid out for easy walking/viewing of orchids. Be aware, part of the garden is being revamped but this didn’t spoil our visit. A fairly relaxing place to visit whilst in busy Singapore."

,,Colourful beauty!,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden in Singapore is shady (so a bit cooler) and quiet and restful.

Such a wide collection of orchids, many which are propogated “in-house” hybrids, and named after dignitaries and celebrities. It’s really worth a visit."
,,Must be the best in its class,5.0,,The orchid garden has an entrance fee and interesting shop. The orhirds are well maintained and these puctures stay with you. Unreal experience. They are busy with major changes which promise an ever better experience.
,,Feel pressure to rate it highly,5.0,,"#2 out of 885 things to do in Singapore? I can surely come up with dozens of other things I'd prefer to do. This was really a fun walk with some lovely orchids - but I guess it's still just flowers? Maybe I lack sentimentality.

So - I gave this five stars to maintain it's position since I clearly lack the ""flower lover gene."" If you lack this same gene, spend your time elsewhere. If you love flowers and a muggy and hot walking experience, this might be for you."
,,Shady and spacious Garden with many different plants displayed in a natural and artistic form.,4.0,,A must visit place in the garden is the orchids area where you can find plants species named after Royalty and Politicians.
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,"The National Orchid garden is beautiful and well-worth a visit. I was underwhelmed by the ""orchid tea"" that I bought in the gift shop which turned out to be flavored teas with a few orchid flowers thrown in. The packaging is attractive but if you are buying gifts for a friend who appreciates fine tea, I recommend that you look elsewhere."
,,Raj na zemi,5.0,,"Fantastická záhrada, plná nádherných orchideí. Každý turista by ju mal určite navštíviť. A ručím za to, že pri ďalšej návšteve S´poru sa tam bude chcieť pozrieť znovu.
Fantastic garden, full of beautiful orchids. Every tourist should definitely visit it. And I guarantee that the next time he visits S'or, he will want to look there again."
,,Drop dead Gorgeous orchids!,5.0,,This is a must see while in Singapore. Their displays are very artistic and beautiful. A stroll through takes about half an hour minimum . Don't miss the orchids named after the celebrities in the building at the top of the path. Well thought out venue!
,,3rd visit big disappointment,3.0,,This was our third visit and took friends who had not been before. We made such a fuss of the place but was really disappointed that a number of the hot and cold houses were closed for refurbishment. Appreciate that this is necessary but prior warning would have been nice as the old famous people orchid garden was severely reduced and indoors and the hot house was completely closed
,,fantastic not to be missed,5.0,,Loved this tropical garden paradise - It was an absolute steal at $5 per person and you do get reductions on that for eligible visitors - not to be missed if you love flowers

,,Beautiful,4.0,,Not our first visit here . The botanic gardens are free to enter and walk around which is amazing when you consider the charge to go to Kew Gardens . The do charge to go into the Orchid Garden However but well worth it . Do be aware that it does close earlier than the rest of the gardens though .

,,Amazing venue,5.0,,"Visited the Botanic Gardens, including the Orchid Garden, in Singapore many years ago, memories were getting hazy, so decided on a return visit on our recent trip to Singapore. It was a reasonably hot and humid day, so decided to concentrate on the Orchid Garden this time around.
What a truly amazing venue, the gardens are spectacular, the staff super friendly and helpful.
We started at the Nassim gate entrance (Information Centre) received maps and great advice from the very friendly staff, a pleasant stroll through the rainforest area, then to the Orchid Centre.
To repeat myself once again, truly amazing. The layout, the structure and general presentation were magnificent - We had forgotten just how beautiful the orchids (and the rest of the garden) truly were.
After an hour or so of admiring and photos, a very gentle downhill walk (about 1km) past the lakes, more gardens and picnic area to the Tanglin Road gate and an inexpensive taxi ride back to our hotel."
,,A stroll through multicolored orchids,5.0,,This was a beautiful display of orchids. There were many colors and varied displays. The pavilion was interesting to view orchids dedicated to famous visitors.

,,"Singapore Orchid Beauty -, for Nature Lovers",5.0,,"It is set in the middle of the Botanical garden.
Lots of place to run around for Children. May need a stroller for very young children.
. It is atleast a 500 m walk to the nearest taxi stand, and a 1.2 km walk to closest MRT. Accesible by 2 MRTs.

Takes about an hour to cover. Colourful, well sheltered, very affordable and well maintained.

They have an ice cream, snacks, drunks shop and a souvenir shop at the entrance.

It is not air-conditioned, open air. some good history on singapore's orchids as well.

Worth for family, kids, seniors. nature lovers."

,,Orchid mania,4.0,,"Even if you aren't a flower person it's still worth a visit on a if you have some spare time. There was some construction (but I couldn't see or hear it) that was going on and by the looks of the picture of what the renovated area will look like it's going the be very nice indeed. I believe construction is scheduled to be completed in a year, but go anyway as it's still very nice."

Although the entrance to the Botanic Gardens is free, at the gate the the Orchid Garden you have to pay a small fee, even a tiny fee when you are over 65. For the review I will refer to the pictures I have added. You can walk the paths for a considerable time and will be stunned at every corner by fresh forms and colours. The Singapore Botanic Gardens are a 5 point rating in their own rights, but one of the main reasons to visit is the National Orchid Garden. Also a 5 point rating."
,,Beautiful Gardens - A must see,5.0,,We visited the gardens with a Princess cruise tour. If you have time to visit on your own I would highly recommend it. It would take several hours to see the entire Botanical gardens including the National Orchid garden. Use the MRT and don't bother with Taxis. Very easy to travel the MRT.

,,"Must go, if in Singapore",5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is one of the highlights of Singapore, fairly easy to access and entry fee $5 is more than reasonable"
,,A must if visiting the Botanic Gardens,5.0,,Very impressive. You pay $5.00 to enter but if a senior it is only $1.00 so make sure you go in. They are currently doing this garden area up and it will be huge. There is still plenty to see inside so makes me think when it is finished it will be even more beautiful.
,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,"Lovely to stroll around these beautifully manicured gardens with the different variations of orchids on display. Only $5 adults and $1 over 60s. The only drawback is that the Orchid Garden is located right in the middle of the Singapore Botanic Gardens (which is not overly spectacular) and it takes a good 15-20 minutes to get to the Orchid Garden from the Botanic Gardens MRT.

We went on a Friday so there weren't many people, however I would imagine it would get very crowded and a bit uncomfortable on a weekend."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"A massive garden with so many beautifully displayed plants. Cheap entry, great signage. Highly recommended"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,This garden is breathtaking and hard to believe this oasis is so close to such a big city. The orchids are amazing but the care taken in the maintenance of everything is just wonderful.
,,Fabulous,4.0,,Its a wonderful place to visit You don't even have to be a gardener to appreciate the wonderful orchids - the smell is lovely.
,,Awesome Orchids,5.0,,"The National Orchid garden is within the Singapore Botanic Garden. The layout of the Orchid garden is superb and we noted that it is continuing to be refined and developed. The orchids are truly beautiful and range in size from very very small to large flowers. Time and time again you turn a corner and are rewarded with a new vista of (different) orchids. While the garden is not large it should be covered at a gentle pace so that you capture all of the carefully designed views. There are lots of excellent photo opportunities.
We also spent time in the wider botanic garden in areas such as the swan lake. There is a Hop on Hop off bus stop quite near the Orchid gardens so access is easy."
,,Has designated station on MRT. (Botanical gardens),5.0,,Free entry to Botanical gardens. Excellent different ares. Free maps. Orchids 5 dollar entry or only 1 dollar over 60's
,,Spectacular array of orchids,5.0,,"Wander along the paths to discover an amazing display of orchids of all shapes, sizes and colours. They nestle into the gardens in every nook and craney and attract beautiful brightly coloured birds."
,,Just dont miss it !,5.0,,"Whether a gardener or not this must be one of the best gardens , anywhere ! Enjoy the individual plants or stand back and admire the borders. Fabulous"
,,A beautiful experience,5.0,,"An absolute must for first time visitors to Singapore. Such a beautiful experience - just don’t do it in the middle of a very hot, humid day as there is quite a bit of walking involved."
,,most beautiful ever,5.0,,one of the most beautiful places we have ever seen. The flowers & orchids are phenomenal . The layout is wonderful with the pathways through the gardens. It is located in the center of Singapore & easy to get to. We were on a tour of the city.
,,Orchid Lovers Heaven,5.0,,"Entry to the National Orchid Garden was only $5SGD, a bargain for the experience of seeing a huge selection of beautiful orchids. We have a small collection of our own but after seeing these, I need to figure out how to acquire some of these.

Just like the botanic garden there were many different sections. However the orchids added so much color to the landscape they facilitated a lot more photo taking opportunities. So many people were carrying big SLRs here.

The entire garden was lush and green which I attributed to the hard work of the large number of gardeners who were everywhere pruning or watering.

A nice paved path and recommended directions enabled me to easily access and experience every section. The house at the top contained varieties named after famous visitors. Another section displayed those varieties created here. Waterfalls, ponds, walk in cages, metal statues, trellises and rock formations were all creatively used to showcase these orchids.

Towards the back a new section was under construction to further expand the park. Artist renditions were posted and looked like it will be another well designed addition.

Definitely worth coming back again and again."
,,If you want to visit the Botanical Gardens then take the time to look round the Orchid Garden,5.0,,While the Botanical Garden covers a very large area most of which has little or no shade from the sun most people limit their time to the National Orchid Garden and its immediate surrounding area. If you are passionate about orchids then do try and take time to visit this garden but if your time in Singapore is short and not passionate you may wish to give this a miss.

That said, our visit was long enough to appreciate the enormous variety and beauty of the orchid displays. One just doesn't know where to turn first for photographs. It is beautiful in every respect. One added bonus - we saw a huge lizard whilst we were walking round. It looked like a miniature dinosaur!"

,,"Beautiful flowers, interesting signs",5.0,,"An amazing array of different orchids. Beautiful. All signs in English. Information to first time visitors could be better.

The weather was hot & very humid, it is outdoor & some of it is under roof. An umberella would be useful for protection."

,,"Beautiful Gardens, Lovely Walk Around Property",5.0,,"This is a very large park, so you could spend the entire day here. We only spent a few hours seeing a portion of it, but it was very worthwhile. I learned a lot about orchids and the gardens are in pristine condition. Beauty surrounded you everywhere you looked.

,,Don't let the small entrance fee put you off,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens is the only UNESCO site in Singapore, and within it's heart is this jewel, the National Orchid Garden. There is no entrance fee payable to enter the Botanical Gardens (which we found astounding), but there is a small entrance fee - with a reduction for seniors! - to the Orchid Garden. Trust me, it's worth every cent.

We visited the Botanical Gardens in February, when there isn't much colour in the gardens (even though they are beautiful), so the Orchid Garden is an absolute blaze of colour and a feast for the senses. The orchids are stunning and the range of colours, sizes and varieties just stunning.

The gardens can be very crowded, so if you want to take photos you'll need a shed-load of patience."
,,Very beautiful,5.0,,"The orchid collection is really impressive and so beautiful. Really a must visit, even for me that is not so into flowers."
,,Glad I went. Go if you like flowers.,5.0,,"Gorgeous and varied. Therefore crowded with visitors taking photos. It was sometimes hard to take a photo without someone else in it. Well worth the 5 SGD and leaving the city center.

,,Always a joy to visit!,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is simply wonderful - such a huge variety of orchids and so beautifully displayed.

,,Amazing place to visit.,5.0,,"Georgeous orchids, other flowers and plants. Well laid out, five hours was not enough time to see it all! You can even have a hybred orchid named after you. This garden lives up to Singapores reputation as the ""Cleanest, Greenest City on Earth! Can't wait to go back again."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Just pure delight, I last visited many years ago when the only place that you could see orchids was here. Nowadays they are abundant in every UK superstore at very low prices so the amazement is not quite the same.
However it is so well maintained and designed, just pure delight to visit and enjoy the colours and visual layouts.
Very clean toilets and free drinking water top up from a fountain near the shop."

,,Must go place for nature & flower lovers,4.0,,"This is a must go place if you are nature and flower lover. I have been there four times already, although recently it is going through renovation and few sections are closed. Still a wonderful place to visit, specially if you have more plans in and around botanic gardens. Entry fee is minimal and visiting time would be around 2-3 hours based on your interest and walking speed."
,,Breath Taking,5.0,,"This is a must see for anyone as it is the most tranquil beautiful setting with absolutely gorgeous orchid displays and variety.

Although they do not advertise wheelchair rentals they do have them on a first come first serve basis. This meant my disabled husband, the true nature lover among us, could enjoy the entire garden with it's winding paths, water sprays, private gardens, and stunning natural beauty.

Such a lovely way to enjoy one of Singapore's true treasures."

,,SO BEAUTIFUL!!!,5.0,,"yes, the caps are intentional. you would understand what i mean if you have been to the orchid garden. It is one of the most beautiful places i have the privilege to have been in. singapore wants to be a city in a garden, and their effort to maintain this garden is testament to the effort. again... SO BEAUTIFUL!!"
,,Underpriced beautiful garden,5.0,,"I honestly think that the entry fee for this garden is underpriced. An adult is only required to pay 5 dollars. Elderly and students are 1 dollar. Kid under 12 is free. I went there with our 2 kids, 3 and 8, my wife, and our parents. We all love the garden. It is not too big that you will get tired but it is also not too small that you will leave unsatisfied. If you are with kids or elderly, I would recommend you to follow the suggested path. They are convenient and cover most of the best parts of the garden. If you take a taxi, the nearest taxi drop-off point is at the Drop-off point at Learning Forest, Tyersall Gate entrance. You will only need to walk 5 minutes to reach the Orchird Garden."
,,Paradise on earth,5.0,,"The garden is one of the destinations that are worth the trip to Singapore. It is Unesco heritage since 2015. Not too big, it is very well visited and it is inserted inside the park in the city. A riot of orchids and natural settings that take your breath away."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,This was a beautiful place to visit and a must see if visiting the Botanic Garden. So many amazing colors and flowers.
,,Beautiful orchid garden,4.0,,"Well worth the S$5 entry fee, the botanic garden itself is free to enter.
It is well laid out and landscaped to fit in so many different orchids and display them to show off their best qualities. It is wheelchair friendly but it is also on the side of a hill, be warned. The paths wind their way to and fro with special display features at intervals offering many photo opportunities. There is a new display section under construction (Feb 2019) which should make it even more attractive.
There are WCs at the top too, just in case."
,,A must for Orchid lovers and gardeners,4.0,,"A very pleasing visit to the Orchid gardens, many hundreds of varieties to see, and lots of interesting structures and gardening ideas to consider. A good opportunity for a photo shoot, and a pleasant afternoons visit. There is a small shop at the conclusion of the visit for those wishing to purchase a souvenier. Toilets available inside the gardens"
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,The national orchid garden is amazing to visit!! They have beautifully laid out the plants. There's a lot of places to rest as it can get a bit tiring. It's sometimes difficult to travel with a stroller as there are some steps. Don't forget to visit the VIP lounge. If you are 60+ your in for a treat as the entrance ticket is just $1!! Can only upload a max of 10 pics so have to leave the best for you to go and see!

,,The place for the flower fans,5.0,,By far the most impressive flower garden I have been to. The orchid collection is really amazing. Highly recommended for flower fans!
,,Even if you are not into flowers.......go,5.0,,"The national orchid garden is truly fascinating. The garden, aside from the wonderful range of varietals is an education for all. Signboards explain in detail the hybridization process and how the different strains of orchid are created.

It is also a lovely diversion from the hectic life of the City and somewhere to stroll in tranquility amongst the perfectly manicured gardens.

The national parks authority deserves special commendation for this garden as it really is a truly lovely place to walk around and relax in. Well worth the trip especially if you combine with the equally tranquil and well manicured Botanic Gardens"
,,Orchid Aria,4.0,,Well worth the additional price of admission. An explosion of colour and shapes that provide so many photo ops for those who like beautiful things. Conveniently located in a section of the Botanic Garden

,,A beautiful place to visit In Singapore,5.0,,We wanted to see the biotanical garden. Included in that was the National Or hid garden. It is a very special beautiful place. We almost missed the entrance but eventually found it
,,Pinterest and IG worthy place,4.0,,"It was raining a little bit when we visit this garden but that did not stop us and it was a great decision to visit even when it was raining. The national orchid garden is 1.5km away from the entrance of the botanical garden so you there's a long walk to get there, the garden is very peaceful though so it is not a problem. The orchids in the garden is so beautiful and very well maintained. My favorite part is the arch that would make a really great photo."
,,Right by Botanical gardens. A real gem.,5.0,,Wonderful selection of beautiful Orchids. So beautiful. Lots of chances for great photo shoots! Great visitors shop too!
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden is outstanding! The spectacle of colour is a joy to the eye. There is a small entry fee, worth every cent. I recommend morning or late afternoon as cruise ships offer this tour, and it can get busy later, however I walked around, very easily at about 11am and only became aware of large groups as I was exiting. An hour is ample time, but lingering longer is a joy."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Happily added this onto our walk through the botanical gardens. Just lovely and well worth the visit. A couple of nice small places to eat just next to it too.

,,A Must Visit,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is a popular area of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. When I made it to the location, there were quite a few tourists, but not so many where you couldn't take in all of the beauty. There is an entry fee, I forgot how much, but it wasn't expensive at all. If you are visiting the botanic gardens, stopping by the National Orchid Garden is a must."
,,Very nice,5.0,,"You need to pay acouple of dollars for the entrance, but it worth it definitely. The only payable thing in the Botanic Garden. The orchids are amazing!"
,,as part of the botanical garden,5.0,,"the jewel in the crown of the botanical gardens - that saiud we loved it all

,,If you don't have a lot of time at the Botanic Garden Go here,5.0,,"If you don't have a lot of time at the Botanic Garden be certain to go to the National Orchid Garden. Included in the modest Botanic Garden admission fee, this is no doubt the highlight. We had never seen such a variety of orchids, some of which, unless you were an orchid expert, you might not even think to be orchids. The beauty and splendor of this part of the Botanic Garden is not to be missed."

,,Pleasant enough,4.0,,"Talking January 2019, the place is okay, but a fair area of it is shut off for redevelopment, so you're not really getting full value.

There are about 1000 species of orchid and about 2000 hybrid species. There are many colored zones, namely “Spring” zone, Summer Zone, Autumn Zone, and Winter zone. Names have been given according to shades of gold, yellow, creams; reds, pinks; orange, greens,; whites, blues and violets. So nicely landscaped, and so beautifully arranged garden. Really love it. Entry is ticketed. Opens from 10 to 5."
,,"Beautiful, magical world of Orchids ! Only place in the world to see Biggest variety of Orchids in One place !!!",5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is located inside the Singapore Botanic Gardens. It was opened on 20 October 1995. There are more than 60,000 orchid plants, with over 1000 species and more than 2,000 hybrids in this garden which is about 3 hectares of carefully landscaped slopes.

Spring zone has Orchids with bright and lively shades of gold, yellow and creams, summer zone reds and pinks, autumn zone consists of matured shades while the winter zone is pre dominantly of whites and cool blues.

They also have a huge collection of carefully selected trees, shrubs, herbs and Hybrid orchids with matching foliage.

They also have various hybrid Orchids with the display of the famous personalities for whom they have been dedicated consisting of famous political leaders from around the world, film personalities and other big shots from all over the world.

,,A must do!,5.0,,Never tire of visiting here. Well worth the small admission fee. Certainly a must do when visiting Singapore

,,Magnificent Orchid Garden in absolutely full bloom in March,5.0,,"I liked the garden very much - very well sculptured, perfectly maintained, not too crowdy, with a lot of orchid species and a lot of descriptions. This is one of the top three nature things to do in Singapore, along with the adjacent National garden and the Gardens by the bay. Get there with the touristic double-decker and spent about two hours - it is really hot, but every minute spent is a magical one. The pictures I attach cannot tell how beautiful the place is."

There is an entrance fee to this part of the gardens but worth every penny. Make sure you have plenty of time, this is not a place to be whirlwinded around especially if you really want to appreciate the plants and flowers."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Beautiful place and breathtaking collection of orchids! Worth every minute spend there! Will definitely visit again!
,,A Garden within a Garden but ORCHIDS,4.0,,Especially educational in the field of Orchids with many different breeds. A spectrum of colors before your eyes as u walk through the enclosure. Must visit for people interested in the field of orchids.
,,Incredible place!,5.0,,"The Orchid garden is well hidden in the Botanical Gardens, but we managed to visit it. It is an incredible gem of Singapore. I had no idea so many types of orchids exist!"
,,Botanical Gardens: A National Treasure,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens often draw a lower rating than the Gardens by the Bay. Agreed the latter is a more impressive technological feat and usage of space. It is set against the futuristic backdrop of Marina Bay Sands. It nicely categorizes and collates all types of species of plant. For a visitor following a tight schedule, it might be the better choice. My personal vote (as a 34 year resident and naturalized citizen) is solidly on the side of the Botanical Gardens. This gem is more authentic and historical, shaped more by Nature's hand than an computerized architectural model. It's generally less congested, more spread out and, for most attractions, free of charge. The free Sunday concerts in the outdoor amphitheatre might draw a large crowd butt most of the time the Gardens offer an ideal venue for a leisurely stroll, jog or quiet contemplation.
If you still want more of an over the top features of Gardens by the Bay, you will find it the National Orchid Garden. For a modest admission fee ($5 general, $1 senior citizen), you can walk through some exquisite arranged foliage, pass through an old colonial black and white to view a spectacular orchid garden (with various species named after famous visitors to Singapore) and detour to an enclosed Arctic ice garden to make quick work of any perspiration. Our guests and visitors have never been disappointed. A few caveats:
1. It can get congested especially by shutterbugs staging photo shoots. You are likely to cross into the line of camera or Iphone.
2. For the past year, the site has been under heavy construction with most of the Orchid Garden and the Ice House closed down (but full admission still charged!). The National Parks Board should have scrapped the fee because without those two features, even the $1 for senior citizen charge seems overpriced.
3. Borrowing from the Las Vegas casino floor plan, the elegant stroll through the Garden deliberately ends at a very overpriced gift shop which one is obliged to pass through.
The real beauty of the Botanical Gardens is in tits natural layout, not in the carefully constructed attractions like the Ginger Garden, Rainforest or Orchid Garden. This has required more tending and, regrettably, resulted in accidents (falling trees, closures). But the magical timelessness of the original, unspolied parts of the Gardens are my favorites. There are some trendy, pricey restaurants as well but this old Singaporean prefer to trek outside the environs to either the Adam Street Hawkers across Bukit Timah from the MRT station on the North or at Samy's Curry past Tyersall Avenue and across Holland Road on the South."
,,Best place to relax and refresh,5.0,,"If you fee llike going to the real garden city, a must visit place for you. Best place to relax and refresh in the city in the complete surrounding of nature and nature only."
,,Must visit when you travel to singapore,5.0,,"Sadly this place is missed by the travellers...a must view if you are in singapore, there are orchids named after all important dignitaries who visited the island nation"

,,Lovely place for flora and fauna lovers,4.0,,"very nice part of the Singapore Botanical Gardens, where you have a chance to see different orchids."
,,Amazing collection of natural beauty!,5.0,,"If you haven’t heard, the Singapore Botanic Gardens is an official UNESCO Heritage Site. The grounds are beautiful and it’s so fantastic to have such a large patch of nature in the middle of a metropolis such as Singapore. But one of the best parts of this place is the Orchid Garden. If you have any interest at all in plants, you’ll see some amazing and gorgeous examples here. Last but not least, the temperature controlled climate inside this part of the Gardens provides a refreshing respite after strolling through the rest of the park. ;-)"
,,Very unique,4.0,,Heavan for orchid lovers and those interested in the different species of orchids. Cool respite from the heat too. Have to pay entrance fee.
,,Incredible Presentation of Orchids,5.0,,"The orchid garden is well worth the long walk from the metro system. The orchid garden is large and the presentation is extraordinary. And, being in Singapore it is spectacular!"
,,Extraordinary place,5.0,,Beautiful flowers all over. Spend around 2 hours there. Great place to take pictures. definitely one of the most beautiful orchid garden in the world
,,Pictures speak louder than words,5.0,,"Absolutely the most beautifully set out gardens. I think I preferred these more than the orchids at Bay of the Gardens. Inexpensive entrance. Discounted for seniors. Immaculate. Gift store was very expensive, which was a shame."
,,Be prepared for lots of walking.,5.0,,The botanical gardens are free to visit but a small charge is made for entry to the Orchid garden. Well worth the visit but be prepared for lots of walking.
,,wooow,5.0,,This place is so nice and eye caching place.We really enjoyed in this place. Thanks for all guys help us
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"A friend and I spent an afternoon wandering through the botanic gardens, which were absolutely beautiful and felt a world away from the hustle and bustle of the CBD. It is well worth paying the entrance fee to view the orchid gardens - it's so beautiful and well maintained."
,,Splendid: the World’s Best,5.0,,"Singapore’s National Orchid Garden is the foremost place in the world to see orchids. Which makes it a remarkable attraction indeed, even if you’re not a fan of flowers. I can think of few floral equivalents anywhere: perhaps that rose garden with 7,000 species in Tuscany, or the Valley of Roses in Kazanlak, Bulgaria. But, leaving questions of beauty and fragrance aside as individual tastes, orchids are considerably more interesting that virtually any other flower around (except perhaps for a Rafflesia in full bloom, a morbid taste). Most, but not all orchids, don’t pop up out of the ground; they’re epiphytes which hang down from trees that they’ve hooked onto. This is survival strategy from the good old days 18,000,000 years ago or so, when they evolved. Then as now, the greenery at the canopy level of a tropical rainforest doubtless absorbed all the sunlight, leaving the jungle floor so dark and gloomy that only a mushroom could thrive there. So to survive, orchids deserted ground-level and became aerial flowers (see Airborne Orchids photo). They still love sunlight (see Sunlit Orchids photo). As you wander round the grounds, both the variety and exquisite beauty of the orchids is astonishing (see Orchid Walk photo).

The garden estimates that there are 25,000 to 30,000 different species of orchids on our planet; they’re mostly tropical, but range from the Arctic circle to Patagonia (by comparison, there are fewer than 6,000 species of us mammals, and the count keeps going down). I once discovered stunning orchids, to my shock, on top of Machu Picchu in the Andes (which is about 2500 meters / 8000 feet above sea level). This dedicated garden within the Singapore Botanical Garden, is the best place on earth to see them.

The total number of orchid species worldwide is a moving target, by the way. Among other causes of this, the National Orchid Garden itself is breeding brand new ones left and right as you read this review. If you’re a world leader and are coming to Singapore on business, odds are good that Singapore will have a new species of orchid invented for you or your spouse before your airplane even touches ground. Among the hybrids concocted here you might find splendid orchids created to honor a Japanese princess on the occasion of her wedding, a Finnish or Thai prime minister on the occasion of his or her visit to Singapore, or a British princess in memorium (see, respectively, Dendrobium Masako Kotaishi Hidenka, Dendrobium Matti, Ascocenda Yingluck Shinawatra, and Memoria Princess Diana photos).

The association between the Singapore Botanical Gardens and hybrid orchids is long-standing: in 1893, when Queen Victoria was Empress of India, and Singapore still reported to Calcutta, the director of the Singapore Botanical Gardens was walking down the road, whistling a merry tune as it were, when he spotted a very curious purple orchid hybrid in the garden of a Miss Joachim. Haven’t a clue who Miss Joachim was, but today her orchid is the national flower of Singapore (see Vanda Miss Joachim photo: her name, by the way, was Agnes, not Vanda, which is a type of orchid, though Vanda would have been a splendid name for the lass).

Singapore may not be the best place in the world for seeing either pyramids or winter Olympics; but it is the best place in the world for seeing orchids: don’t miss this one."
,,Beautiful Gardens- Stay Hydrated While You Enjoy!,5.0,,"Wonderful visit to the National Orchid Garden. I would highly recommend carving out a 1/2 day while in Singapore to enjoy the Botanical Garden overall (the Botanic Gardens are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and absolutely beautiful). The Orchid Garden requires a slight fee, but it is well worth it to explore the many wonderful floral varieties. If botanical photography is a hobby, this place should not be missed. As the grounds are expansive and Singapore weather is notoriously hot and humid, staying hydrated as you stroll throughout the grounds is a must."
,,"Lovely, but Renovations Going On !",4.0,,"Renovations going on, and was raining. But still managed to take great photos. Would love to visit when renovations complete."

,,Stunning,5.0,,Worth the ride. Stunning gardens. Handicap accessible path so anyone may enjoy the magnificence. Wonderful morning among colorful splendor
,,A joy to visit,5.0,,"You don't need to be ""into"" orchids to appreciate how beautiful this place is. Just outside the city centre, it's well worth a visit in its own right even if you don't visit the main botanic gardens."
,,Great in January,5.0,,beautiful orchid blooms on show in January - only $5 to enter after browsing around the botanical gardens
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Being from the UK we only see orchids wrapped in plastic and usually highly priced. This is a ticketed venue but well worth 5 SD to get in. This garden has them everywhere, even growing from arches over head. There is a display of orchids named for visiting foreign dignitaries we were interested to see the Margaret Thatcher and Duke and Duchess of Cornwall orchids. I could have wandered round all day but the heat made it impossible. The shop at the exit has some fabulous merchandise beautiful boxed T-Shirts and gold gilt orchids."
,,Very beautiful,5.0,,"This is probably the crown jewel of the Singapore Botanic Gardens and has a separate entry fee.
It is advisable to set aside some time specifically for the orchid garden when you visit the botanic gardens. It has several hundreds of varieties of Orchids, and is done up very beautifully.
Unfortunately, we could not enjoy it fully as mid-way through our visit the skies opened up and it rained down in bucketfuls literally non stop for 2 hours at least..

It is definitely worth a visit"

,,Orchid heaven,5.0,,"The National Orchid garden lies inside the Singapore Botanical Garden and the environment inside is truly mesmerizing. One can enjoy a great photography with over 1000s of varieties (species) of Orchids. This attraction requires an entrance fees of $5/person and student and senior citizen can enter just with $1, while it is free for children under 12. Loved this place - truly blessed with mesmerizing nature. There is also a souvenirs shop to buy varieties of orchid based glass block and others together with books etc. A most to visit attraction."

,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit! Enjoyed it more than Gardens by the Bay, Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. There are different sections and lakes. Places to eat and nice toilets. Really good value for money $5 each. Senior citizens $1. Park is free. Great for any age."
,,Well worth it for some respite in the city,5.0,,"Loved the Orchid Gardens - they are so beautiful and well worth the SGD$5 entry fee.

There’s a never ending array of stunning orchids which are beautifully well kept, as is the old heritage colonial house inside the garden.

This is the Singapore of my childhood and it’s lovely to see it being so well preserved when other places (like Sentosa Island!!) have been brutally converted over.

Go to the gardens and find some peace away from the hordes in a city now full of high end malls."

,,Amazing amount of orchids,5.0,,There is no doubt that this is the pinnacle of orchid gardens. There are so many varieties that you can't keep track of. The actual area is not large and is part of the Botanic garden but every inch of it was filled with orchids of every size and colour. Definitely worth a visit unless you hate plants.
,,awesome orchids,5.0,,"The varieties, the design of the garden and the ease of access makes it a must-see for all visitors and locals who enjoy beautiful flowers .

Well worth a visit."
,,Fun with family,5.0,,Afternoon out with family. One of the best garden i ever visited and very well organised. Singapore knows how to entertain.
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"Part of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, this is a must see. One of the worlds most beautiful flowers shown off better than I have seen anywhere. A couple of pounds to go in does not break the bank either!"
,,Tons of colors,4.0,,"It is my must do suggestion if you want to give a green flavour to your Singapore visit.
The garden is undoubtedly rich of colors, even though not so rich in varieties.
Relatively small when compared yo the overall size of botanical gardens, it is certainly worth a visit.
Beware that it is under renovation and big parts are not accessible."

,,Surrounded By Beauty,5.0,,"The tour by Bus was never going to be adequate to fully appreciate all the beauty on offer here. Only with half an hour to visit, much was achieved regardless. Stunning Orchids of every variety were on offer...."
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,I know it's hot and humid in Singapore year round but you do feel it when walking through this garden. There are parts that are uphill but at the top you get to see the orchids that are named after famous people. The gardens are indescribable they are so beautiful. I don't know how many types of orchids are here but each one is unique and colorful. I took a ton of pictures.
,,Beautiful Garden worth a visit,5.0,,Very happy I decided to hop off the bus tour to visit the National Orchid Garden. Beautiful well maintained garden with truly beautiful flowers. A short walk from the main entrance it was well worth it even on a blistering hot day. There are times you have to navigate a number of people taking photos (which I’m guilty of myself) but the area is big enough to find some peaceful corners to take it all in. I felt it was well worth the small fee to take in the natural beauty.
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"We visited this place as we were already in the botanic garden, and the entrance fee was only 5 sgd per person. It was such a beautiful place! Different types of orchids to look."
,,Mind blowing!,5.0,,"A visit to the Orchid Gardens was included in our tour of Singapore - and we really weren't sure what to expect (orchids, obviously...) - but the whole site is amazing!

Allow plenty of time just to go through this section of the Botanic Gardens."

,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"The ticket price was 5 Singaporean dollars per adult, so reasonable. The walk through the garden was enchanting. They have orchids named after famous people like Princess Diana - in memory of her, and other dignitaries that have visited the park. The views are breathtaking. Plenty photo opportunities. In the same location as the botanical gardens, which is free."
,,Paradise on earth,5.0,,"Been coming here for 33 years each time I stay in Singapore ! A bit disapointed by the closed sections du to renewal but no problem : understandable. Don't worry I will continue to come and visit this delicious and peacefull place ! Nicest Orchid Garden in the world for me and I've been to Malaysia, Thaïland, etc..."

,,Orchid Heaven,5.0,,"If you love orchids or just flowers in general, you'll find yourself in paradise at the National Orchid Garden. We were blown away by the thousands of blooms in myriad varieties and colors. We signed on to a private, free tour of the garden. Our guide, Edward, gave us really useful insights into orchid propagation and care, as well as an appreciation for the amazing expanse of orchid varieties. The garden is superbly manicured and beautifully designed - a world-class experience not to be missed."

,,An eye candy!,4.0,,"A visual paradise, a very pleasing display of greens with various colors blooming all through the year in controlled environment and utmost care. A must see place for those who derive immense pleasure looking at all the vibrant colors offered by nature."
,,An inexpensive and delightful orchid garden to visit,5.0,,"From the front gates near the Botanic Gardens SMRT station to the National Orchid Gardens it is roughly a distance of 1.3 kilometres and thoroughly worth the effort to reach. The walking path through the Botanic Gardens are wide and pass through a variety of beautiful gardens and landscapes. For the small fee of SG$5 we were surrounded by the most beautiful arranged orchid gardens, we self-guided our way along the terraced paths not knowing what beauty would lie ahead. At the back of the gardens I very much appreciated the relief of the Pavillion building with enormous ceiling fans which offered great relief from the heat and humidity of the morning. Inside the pavillion building was a very interesting display of exquisite orchids which have been breed with special people in mind and named after them. I read that there are over one thousand species and two thousand hybrids in this National garden. To conclude our visit we stopped into the air-conditioned souvenir store which had some very nice gifts to purchase, even tea leaves made from orchids."
,,The Finest Orchid Garden Ever,5.0,,"This place is a must see while you are in Singapore. It is a calming oasis of tranquility and gorgeousness. Walk in the botanic gardens, too. Go early in the morning to avoid the hordes of people. They open at 5 a.m. Stunning place to visit."

,,The best in the world!,5.0,,"Having been fortunate to visit many of the best gardens around the world, I can truly say the National Orchid Garden housed within the free spectacular Singapore Botanical Gardens, is the best display of this type I have ever seen. Located entirely outside, endless varieties of orchids are displayed in every conceivable setting. A small indoor site explains cultivation. Needless to say, the reasonable entrance fee to the Orchid Garden is well worth the investment. It is a stop on the SMRT transportation system, so transportation is cheap."
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"National Orchid garden which is located in the Botanic Garden in Singapore, is the one of the most beautiful garden in the world. I visit there several times to enjoy a lot of flowers. There are many visitors from all over the world."

,,Currently under rennovation,4.0,,"What you can see in the orchid gardens is splendid. However you will spend a lot of time waiting for people taking pictures across the narrow paths, although garden management have cleverly set up a number of photographic backdrops off the main path. There is an admission price for all foreigners, and at the time we visited, Singaporeans and students were offered free admission. Some wonderful garden ideas to be had in this little garden and by all accounts, the new and improved garden will offer a lot, lot more."

The garden itself is situated in the Singapore Botanical Gradens, which are also awesome and totally worth the visit. Highly recommend the beautiful orchids."
,,Nice collection of orchids with bad landscaping,3.0,,"The place is good with lots of orchids but not many rare ones. As I went with my parents who had to be taken in wheel chairs I found it extremely difficult to do so. Even though we paid for two wheel chairs we found it extremely difficult to wheel them around. The landscaping is not done with a thought for the elderly. The landscaping is hills and slopes, where we found extremely difficult to handle the wheel chairs. We had to leave the place half way and it was very disappointing. Hope the management will look into and rectify the mistakes and make it more user friendly for all."
,,Amazing Orchid Collection,5.0,,A beautiful and stunning collection of orchids in very well maintained gardens. The best thing we did in Singapore.
,,Very good,5.0,,Set within the Botanical Gardens this is very much worth a visit. You have to pay to go in but it is worthwile.

,,Very nice and I totally enjoyed the visit,5.0,,It is a must see sight when u visit Singapore Botanical Gardens. There are many orchids and tropical plants. Great photo place too.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"The gardens are set on a hill so there is some climbing to do and in the heat and humidity this can be a challenge. The orchids are beautiful and so well worth the effort. The gardens are wonderfully maintained and the staff work hard to keep everything clean and neat. Maps are provided at the entrance and well worth using as there is a maze of paths and buildings in order to see everything. Take water and an umbrella as there is shade but not all the way. Recommended to start by walking to the top and then walking down. There is a smaller garden which can be seen in about an hour and then there is a much larger area which you would need several hours to visit. However, the smaller garden gives you a good enough experience and is recommended if you are short of time or if it is a very hot day, or for the elderly or those with small children."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"It’s very pretty , well organized place ... lovely and costa just 5 bucks per person . My parents loved it as they are avid fans of orchids . It takes about 3 hrs to see ..."
,,Fresh and Soothing,5.0,,"such a refreshing place to walk, the variety of plants is incredible. you can just sit down in random bench to breath some fresh air and do nothing lol. the sound of water pouring down is also very soothing. overall it's a total refreshment from the city center for you to clear your mind~"
,,Beautiful Place in a Lovely Location,4.0,,"It’s fair to say I am not a big horticulturist but the Botanic Gardens are a great place to relax, walk and enjoy some amazing plant and wildlife.

I have visited the enclosure 2 times so far this year and have yet to see some of the species blooming! The Gardens had displayed some unsual “scented” orchid species elsewhere but not in this enclosure, I wonder why. At the time of writing, the Gardens are upgrading and developing further with a ‘mist house’ amongst others. Guess I have to pay another visit next year...."

,,A Huge Collection of Orchids,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is housed within the Botanic Gardens, so you can visit both the attractions on the same day.

You will encounter crowds and be ready for some jostling at the points that are popular for clicking pictures. Carry water and some sunscreen."
,,Well worth a visir,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit to gardens by the bay as there is so much to see and do. I would recommend allowing at least half a day. Also I would suggest having a walk around the gardens as there is a lot of great areas, sculptures and attractions to visit and take photos of!"
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,"OK, so I thought I knew a bit about orchids since I grow a few at home. This place blew my mind. I just about gave up orchids when I got home I felt so inferior! If you like orchids, colour and gardens make the trip here a priority."
,,Superb Displays,5.0,,The colourful display of a large variety of orchids provides a relaxing haven in fast paced frantic Singapore.

,,Highlight of our visit,5.0,,If you have traveled to Singapore and not visited the Orchid gardens you have to go back. The beauty and variety of the flowers is absolutely incredible.
,,A mecca for orchid lovers.,4.0,,"Stunning. To someone who does not live in an environment where orchids grow (in our case the UK) The National Orchid Garden is a paradise.

The garden is easy to walk around - although if you struggle with slopes you might want to think about whether or not to visit - with wide paths and beautifully planted borders.

The collection is not so extensive for anyone visiting with you who is not a gardener to become bored yet there is plenty to marvel at.

My only slight criticism would be the lack of information boards which would have been useful.

If you only have a short stay in SIngapore and love plants this is definately a place to visit."
,,a must see in Singapore,5.0,,"If you like orchids, you should not miss this garden. A little unfortunately part of it is being renovated, but the rest is just gorgeous."
,,"Go early, before the crowds, and the heat!",4.0,,"We rushed through this garden too quickly. Easy to get there using MRT (Orchard Rd station). It was quite warm and crowded by midday, so go earlier! Small fee S$5 for tourists."
,,Not long enough,4.0,,I recently visited the garden as part of a City Tour and didn't have enough time to see the garden properly as we only had 40 minutes. I was going back in the afternoon but we had heavy rain. I would recommend others to go and visit
,,Beautiful garden within Botanic garden,4.0,,"There was an entry ticket you need to buy, but the orchid are truly something different. At the time of our visit (Nov 18), there were some renovation going on, but the garden was well maintained, there wasn't that many people. Get your camera out as there are lots of photos to be taken."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,So glad we went. Very reasonable entry fees and worth every penny. So many varieties of Orchid beautifully displayed. Would recommend anyone to escape the hustle and bustle and take a look.
,,Best Orchid Garden!!,5.0,,Such a great and lovely way to spend a couple hours strolling through a wide variety of beautiful orchids.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,If you are wondering through the botanical gardens then it is well worth a visit! Entry is $5 a person which seems fair given the beautiful orchids on display.
,,Outstanding display of orchids,5.0,,"Where I am from, Orchids are quite rare. I've seen a few as houseplants. This was absolutely incredible.

,,Stunning Orchids but Busy,4.0,,"No doubt if you like orchids this is a must-see. However it's quite busy (being the focal point of the Botanic Gardens) and sometimes difficult to get a close view of some of the more impressive varieties. If you like orchids and you're happy to wander round and wait for the odd tour group to pass then go. If you're a bit impatient or nonplussed by orchids, then there are many other areas of the gardens that are just as beautiful. We would happily go again next time we're visiting Singapore but wouldn't be disappointed to miss it."
,,All I can say is WOW!,5.0,,"We took a package tour which stopped for close to an hour at the Orchid Gardens. We really enjoyed it. There are lots of orchids, mostly in a garden setting outdoors. The gallery where they had photos of the special orchids had an explanation of how to make a hybrid which I found interesting. We all enjoyed the special orchids named for people like Margaret Thatcher, William and Catherine, Laura Bush, and many others. I would highly recommend visiting the orchid gardens. The gift shop also had some very unique gifts including gold plated orchid flowers, orchid flowers encased in clear resin as paperweights or hangings, and paintings of flowers. Most things were quite reasonably priced and we purchased a couple for unique gifts."
,,Wow,5.0,,"The way they have designed the garden is breathtaking. If you don't know much about orchids, this is the place to go. There are even free guided tours by volunteers, so I would recommend joining one of those so that you can learn something. The flowers are absolutely beautiful and I don't have the words to describe them. You should definitely go there, but make sure to give yourself plenty of time."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,This is the only area at Orchid Garden which has a paid entry but it is well worth it. There is a very wide selection of Orchids. The color riot makes a visit to this place delightful.
,,well worth a visit,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens, perfect opportunity to get photos of family, flowers, or just walk and relax. Take water or purchase at one of several gift shops, places to eat. Staff so helpful. Look for the beautiful birds as well."
,,Fabulous!!! Not to Miss!!!,5.0,,"Located within the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the Orchid Garden is not to be missed. There is a charge to enter; however, it is worth it.

,,Lovely Surroundings,5.0,,"Nice walk, lots of colour and detailed information , a decent cafe at the end for lunch, plenty of shade"
,,Absolutely Breathtaking!,5.0,,"Situated in the Botanical Gardens, which are beautiful to visit and free. The Orchid Garden is the most outstanding collection of Orchids, displayed through winding pathways with fountains and water features complimenting their beauty, the structures and frames these plants are grown up and around are quite amazing. It’s is breathtaking in more than one way, but there are many sheltered area to sit, relax and enjoy the views as well as the Orchids. The vibrant colours and delicate beauty of these flowers, was greatly enjoyable in this park. But please don’t miss out on the rest of the the Botanical Gardens, they are fantastic in their own right. it’s a good half a day at least! Quite majestic slightly old Victorian, well worth it!
Look out for the Freeze Dried sealed glass gifts in the shop, real Orchids mini bouquets from the gardens to last for ever and Orchids encapsulated in resin great presents I thought, really good keepsakes of our visit!
Orchid Garden $10.00 for two adults."

,,Stunning,5.0,,Well worth paying the extra fee to go in and see when at the Botanical Gardens. Easy to walk around and places for shade made it enjoyable

,,Great place to spemd an afternoon,5.0,,"Beautiful orchid gardens, a fascinating variety of flowers - and that's from someone who isn't really into flowers in the first place. Worth paying the extra admission for (the botanic gardens are free)"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,If you’re in the botanical gardens it’s well worth a $5 visit to see the Orchids. I’ve never seen a display like it before there were thousands!
,,Beautiful little garden,5.0,,This garden is lovely and well worth a visit if you're in the area. There's plenty of shade inside the garden but I would still recommend going early in the morning before it gets too hot. Huge variety of orchids as well as a room with hybrids named after famous/notable people. Entry is cheap at only 5 bucks.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Being a part of Singapore Botanic Gardens, this is the only attraction within it for which you need to pay. But the ticket fee (=SGD 5 per person) is not so hefty but instead, worth every penny.

It's stunning to see a large number of different kinds of flowers all around. There are different photo spots too, where one can click memorable photos.

Definitely worth a visit while in Singapore. Otherwise, your visit to Singapore is, as I opine, incomplete!"

,,Lovely manicured garden to display one of nature's marvels!,5.0,,"Easy to navigate even with a frail elderly. Many photo stops. However, would love to see a section devoted to orchids in their native setting, not so controlled like in a Victorian garden,"
,,Bucket list tick,5.0,,"Thanks to watching Martha Stewart I saw this garden. I was captivated. It was part of my Singapore city tour. It did not disappoint. The orchids were a riot of colour and they looked magical bathed in the aftermath of a Singaporean storm.
The orchid is Singapore's national flower and I never realized how many diverse colours and shapes they came in.
This is a must do for any avid gardner on a trip to Singapore. Would have loved more time."
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"I paid the extra to get into the orchard gardens. They were very beautiful. The varieties I felt were a bit limited. As I was expecting a much wide variety range.

The arrangements were quite clever and for the most part the grounds are very well kept. It took me about 90 mins to tour the area and it is not as crowed as the nain garden areas. You will be able to get lots of great pics in this exhibit so it was well worth the small admission charge."

,,Small yet full place,5.0,,"It is incredible how much could be packed into this very ""small area"" place of interest. The careful planning of the garden with walking paths built around the exhibits ensures you see more orchids than crowds. The VIP orchids place is a must-see. Somewhat all the orchids used around the garden though they are not the main exhibits are also beautifully curated and maintained. An orchid is an orchid, VIP or not. So in that sense, the entire garden is orchid-full."

There are hundreds of different Orchids growing in a carefully maintained setting. There’s information about hybrid varieties and examples of these created especially for VIP visitors. It’s definitely worth a visit.
,,amazing garden,5.0,,"well kept. amazing garden. i can keep coming. it also in botanic garden, one of the best garden in the world."
,,Orchids on mass..,5.0,,"Visited here along with a visit to the full Botanical Gardens, well worth a visit spent 3 hours here+"
,,Love this Garden.,5.0,,"For a small entry fee, these gardens are beautiful, clean & well designed. The long established gardens are constantly updated & renewed for those-once-in-a-while revisits. Most of the pathways seem wheelchair accessible, with some steep rises. Love this Garden."
,,Very nice relaxing couple of hours,5.0,,"We went after the Grand Prix weekend to the National Botanic gardens, which is free entry, and was amazed at the tranquillity and beauty of the gardens, then we paid the 5 SGD entry fee for the National Orchid gardens inside.very nice way to spend 2 or 3 hours relaxing just walking around and so peaceful even though it’s still in the city."
,,Peaceful and Exotic at the same time,5.0,,"This is the only paid property situated within the Botanical Garden. And the nominal fee you will need for entry, is totally worth it. The garden is what it promises - Orchids, in abundance and in various colors and types. I loved every second of my stay here. And it's a heaven for people who loves flower photography. Even I could not but snap a few amateurish photos. I eventually bought a little orchid plant and really am hoping I can bring it to full blossom back home."
,,Nice add-on if you are in the botanical garden,4.0,,"Unless you really are into orchids not sure if the garden as such would be worth to travel all the way there, but as the botanical gardens are simply marvelous and definitely worth to see, it absolutely is worth to spend some extra time and visit the orchid garden as well."
,,Gorgeous Gardens & Exquisite Orchids,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens has a spectacular array of gardens filled with an immense variety of plant life along trails that the public can freely enjoy. You'll also be able to view various birds and some animals in the park. There are wide paved trails with occasional benches and places just to sit and relax among nature's beauty. Although there are some stairs and moderate inclines, it is entirely handicap accessible with paths going around the steps for those with a wheelchair or other needs. Many local people come daily to walk or jog through the park. The highlight of this outdoor complex is the National Orchid Garden which is only a five dollar entrance fee and worth every penny. There are a few places to buy food or drinks inside the park but you are allowed to bring your own items. Public transportation of either the MRT (metro-rapid-transit), buses, and taxis will take you to one of a few different entrances. I'd recommend taking your time (3 to 5 hours) or more if you enjoy taking photos and love the outdoors. Don't neglect this beautiful park for the often crowded tourist attractions of Singapore. Get away from the skyscrapers and relax in the splendor of Singapore's nature."
,,Great day out,4.0,,Spent the day wandering through the garden. 1000’s of orchids and to look at and touch. Great photo ops because you can get so close to them
,,Beautiful orchids,3.0,,Beautiful place to visit and definitely worth going if already visiting the botanical garden. It is a nice little walk and the complete garden can be completed in 20-30 minutes or so.
,,A trip to orchid gardens,5.0,,"I visited the National Orchid Gardens twice this month and boy, I was very much impressed. The orchids were placed under different categories with some bearing the names of several dignitaries. New species were also added and were housed under a shade. I must add that the different colours of the orchids appeal to one's sense of sight. It was a worthwhile visit."
,,Fantastic display of Orchids,5.0,,"This really is a must visit whilst in Singapore. Its inside the Botanic Gardens which is free. The Orchid Gardens are $5, and its the best $5 you can spend."
,,Amazing is not strong enough a word,5.0,,This is a sure must see in Singapore! Plan to spend at least three hours walking amongst the most delicate orchids! Take a camera and your hiking shoes because once ypu start walking you can not stop!
,,National Orchid Garden,5.0,,"Definitely enjoyed visitng this delightful part of Singapore. Also the weather was really humid, the beauty of the gardens made up for all that. Definitely a must-see when visiting Singapore. Very well maintained and very beautiful indeed."
,,Must see,4.0,,The Botanic Gardens in General are so well maintained and the orchids were in full bloom and just beautiful.

,,Hands down best garden we have been to!,5.0,,The orchid garden was like a dream! I’ve never seen so many orchids before in my life! Loved all of them. I definitely recommend coming here.
,,Amazing display,5.0,,National Orchid Garden is part of the bigger botanical gardens.It is the only part of the botanical gardens that is not free to visit but it is definitely worth to visit it. Make sure to visit it right after the opening because shortly after it opens it gets quite crowded already
,,Fabulous,5.0,,Worth paying to see these wonderful orchids that are awesome Entrance has Elderly pricing too . Well worth the walk and you must have a camera of course!
,,A remarkable display,5.0,,DIsplays are varied and splendid. Climate is superb for orchids but can quickly wilt people. Bring water and comfortable shoes.
,,"Walk,relax and enjoy",3.0,,A very nice place to visit where you can have a nice relaxing walk around the garden. Try your very best to be there early in the morning as the humidity hits it's hardest by midday. You don't have to book a tour to do it as you can just hire a taxi (around 10minuts ride from town) but entry can be tricky a bit if you enter through the park. The garden is surrounded by a beautiful park that may take you an hour or so to explore but kind of has five entries and only one of them has a taxi rank. Take your water with you . please don't hesitate to ask me a question or two....been twice and will visit again as it is a great spot for flower photography
,,Beautiful Orchids!,4.0,,"We are over 60 and got the ""Senior"" discount was really good (only about $1 SGD instead of $5), Impressed by this! The main hall had some beautiful specimens, and it was interesting to see who they'd been named after. The Orchid Garden was very good, and some good photo opportunities, but the signage needs to be improved (took us ages following the ""Exit"" signs - some pointing the wrong way to get out)! It's well worth a visit though!"
,,Relating with nature,4.0,,"It's weird to rate a place that's very nature-ish in nature, but hey, we're known for all sorts of weird. The point: I was happy to be here because I felt relaxed."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"A beautiful garden with lots of different orchids to see. It is recommended to wear comfortable shoes as the gardens are very large and there are lots of hidden areas - make use you see the celebrity garden which shows all the orchids named after the likes of Hollywood, Bollywood and royalty

There are several different routes that you can take through the gardens with lots of different installations to explore. There are fountains, aviaries with roses and orchids as well as some more stunning displays that have to be seen

,,Beautiful tranquil place,5.0,,Absolutely a must for any gardeners to visit. Beautifully set out with vast number and variety of orchids Glad we visited
,,Spectacular Displsy of Orchids,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens has the most impressive orchid garden I have ever seen. This National Orchid Garden has beautifully displayed over 2,000 orchids in such a way you feel you are alone in this small public place. Make sure you include this area of the garden in your visit!"
,,"You must see this, if you’re visiting the Gardens anyway",5.0,,"The Orchid Garden is just magical. The colour and beauty of the orchids is breathtaking. Little enclaves are set here and there for great photo opportunities. Arches with yellow orchids growing up and over like we’d have wisteria in the UK. Truly a feast for any flower lover, gardener or simply a lover of colour and beauty."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Really nice gardens, was pretty and well kept. Entry fee wasn't much, and I guess goes towards maintenance"
,,Remarkably pretty and well maintained,5.0,,"These orchid gardens, within the large Botanical garden park, are not large, but are amazing. They are well worth the extra price to see them. Everything is arranged and kept so beautifully."

,,beautiful orchids; every photographer's dream!!,5.0,,"so many orchid to see and photograph! so clean, colourful, well-maintained garden and it is worth the visit if you have time."
,,Singaporean Wonder,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, you can miss Sentosa ( you will find such amusement parks in USA too) but not Orchid Garden.

This is a wonderful creation and effort by the Singapore Government. Don't miss the National Flower of Singapore - Vanda 'Miss Joaquim' and the different variations of orchids. If you love gardening, you may pick up an orchid from the retail shop there but keep in mind...Orchids are high maintenance delicates and doesn't survive in all weather conditions.

The sheer colours, hybrids, shapes, sizes will leave you love this beautiful world a little more.

There is a VIP garden too with each orchids being named after a famed persona on a diplomatic visit. Visit it, you will love it.

Orchid Garden is located inside Botanical Gardens...while Botanical Gardens is free for all, entry to Orchid Garden is chargable but highly worth.

For tourists, only interested in Instragram photos, this is the place.

The retail shop stores products on a slightly high price though for a tourist memorablia, it's okay.

The Orchid Garden is highly recommended for anybody visiting our Red Dot.

TIP - You may finish up your visit with an open air free orchestra at Botanical Gardens on weekends (checkout the schedules). You will cherish nature & music and wanna back for more."
,,Such a beautiful place,5.0,,"Make sure you go on a sunny day as it makes the gardens all so more stunning!! Plenty to do and very interesting place to visit, really wish i took a picnic for myself."
,,Amazing Orchid garden,5.0,,I visited the Orchid garden in July 2018 and wandered all through the beautiful orchids for 2 hours or more. You never get tired of looking at each and every one. So many colours etc.
,,True highlight,5.0,,"This is my second trip to the gardens. My first last year was a bit rushed and I promised myself I would go back if I was back in Singapore. For people such as me who have an interest in plants this is a must see. Admittedly the variety of plant material in flower on my first visit was more extensive but I doubt you will be disappointed whenever you go. There is some major reconstruction work taking place which will limit you somewhat from seeing the diversity of plant specimens within their collection. Regardless, it is well worth visiting."
,,The most beautiful I've seen,5.0,,I love gardens and orchids in particular but this place is the best and the largest I've seen so far. It is peaceful and tranquil in here. A bit pricey but itnis worth it. The bookstore is awesome and the restaurant cafe is just on point. Will definitely go back again.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,In the middle of the Botanical Gardens. Pay the $5 to walk around and see the gorgeous display of flowers. My new goal in life is to have an orchid named after me in the celebrity garden.

,,Simply Magnificent,5.0,,My wife and I visited the National Orchid Garden as part of a bus tour and it was simply magnificent. A great place for a family to visit. Highly recommended.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is set inside the Singapore Botanic Gardens. While the overall gardens are free, this smaller area is ticketed. It's absolutely worth it for anyone who loves orchid, or appreciates flowers in general."
,,I really think you should visit in peak season,3.0,,"We went here on the 1st of September, but already a lot of the flowers were gone. It didn’t make it that special, however I think it can be really special in the season."
,,Excellent place to visit,5.0,,"One of the finest garden I've visited in Singapore, a great location and good collection of things. Amazing"

,,Breathtaking orchid garden and amazing local nature,4.0,,"this is the most fascinating orchid gearden I ever have seen. It is within the local nature and within the botanic garden. Also the botanic garden ist aready an experience. The botanic garden is huge, free of charge. For the Orchid garden you pay a Little fee. But this absolutely worth doing. There is also abuilding that houses famous orchids names after prominent prople and royals. Even Lady Di has one there.
The arrangements within this garden are also outstanding and as everything in Singapore, everything is super clean."
,,very colourfull interesting display,5.0,,"Traveled by bus to the venue. Lot of interesting flowers, mini water features. Can take some great photos."
,,National Orchid Garden,5.0,,"A good place to experience hundreds of flora at one place, well maintained just like the entire city is"
,,In a rainy day,5.0,,How many fantastic orchid flowers exist in nature??? The answer is here. In the botanic garden in Singapore.... a little bit away from the city centre but easily reachable by busses (174 for ex).... and in Singapore bus service is working very very well !
,,Stunningly beautiful,5.0,,I first visited the Orchid Garden 50 years ago and have wonderful memories of it. I'm thrilled to say that it is even more amazing than I remember. A must for all visitors to Singapore.
,,Only if you love orchids...,5.0,,"As the name suggests, it's an orchid garden. IMHO, it's the best one yet. Nothing much else to say; all shapes, sizes and colours."
,,A place of calm and a riot of colour,5.0,,Flowers! And trees! And greenery! And water! and nature! All in one place providing a haven of calm in a busy city. And the little cafe is excellent when refreshments are in order. Especially the laksa.

,,2018 trip,5.0,,"If you made the effort to get to the Botanic Gardens, you might as well pay a few bucks to visit the Orchid Garden as well."
,,Stunning orchid displays,5.0,,"My family and I really enjoyed the orchid garden even though it was a hot and sticky day! The garden had a huge variety of orchids, even some that are very rare.

,,All shades and sizes of beautifully coloured Orchids,4.0,,Lovely day at the National Orchid Gardens. Large variety of orchids. Gift shop with an array of orchid themed gifts.
,,Orchids and Ginger,5.0,,To see a named Orchid for President Obama outside and within a few inches of my hand was refreshing. Most orchid gardens are in a glass house and so distant that I don't get a sense of the wonder that this garden allows. The layout was walkable and welcomed setting and meditating. The pools and the ginger gardens were this information junkies delight. If you can go alone do so so you don't have to rush for others less interested.
,,Stunning,5.0,,The most amazing collection of orchids with so many different colours and varieties. Definitely worth a visit!
,,Beautiful garden,4.0,,"If you are someone who love flowers,trees and nature, this is a place not to be missed. It has beautiful scenery and walk way for you to enjoy."
,,Always a delight,4.0,,"It is always a delight to bring my gal and my family to see different species of beautiful orchids. The place is safe and conducive to walk around leisurely while admiring the colours and variety of the flower. The ambiance will amaze you and will make your visit worthwhile. If you have amole time in Singapore, head over to this paradise and be entertained by nature."
,,Nice place to refresh your mind,5.0,,"I've been to the orchid garden several times. This is a nice, well arranged, and well maintained garden."

,,Botanical Gardens,5.0,,The orchid garden is beautiful. There is regular music on Sunday evenings where you can sit and have a picnic. The gardens are serene and beautiful.
,,Enchanted garden,5.0,,"For those who loves orchids, visiting the Singapore Botanical Garden is a must. There are thousands of different varieties of orchids and some are named based on the royalties and famous people who visited the garden. It is an enchanted place to be."
,,"Stunning, a must do!",5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden which is part of the Singapore Botanic Gardens is a little way out of the Singapore city centre but is accessible by public transport. The best time to visit is on a weekday in the morning before it becomes too humid, to avoid the weekend crowds. The paths meander through the extensive Orchid garden with beautiful displays of orchids on both sides of the path and overhead. Throughout the garden you will come across beautiful garden features displaying orchids at their best and adorned with orchids, so many varieties, so many colours. There is also a pavilion displaying orchids bred and named after world dignitaries eg. Princess Diana, Nelson Mandela, Barack Obama, Margaret Thatcher to name a few. You come out through a gift shop that sells individual orchids that have been gold plated and made into jewellery - a beautiful gift for orchid enthusiasts. Most gift lines are orchid themed. Taking a leisurely pace and taking plenty of photographs I think it took me approx. 1 hour to 1 1/2hours, to really take it all in and enjoy the moment."
,,Incredible variety and density of orchids,4.0,,"Beautiful flowers and many variety of orchids, far beyond the classical dendrobium and phalaenopsis orchid. One caveat: can be very crowded on Saturdays, incl. with newly weds taking many pictures. It is worth spending more time in the rest of the botanical garden!"
,,Ideal for an evening stroll,4.0,,"Located in the middle of the Botanical Gardens and with just a $5 entrance fee (free for kids), the Orchid Garden is a pleasant place to visit for an evening stroll. A good collection of orchids and plenty of photo opportunities. Some areas were under renovation and cordoned off but there was still plenty of places to visit. Value for money!"
,,Small and perfectly formed,5.0,,"Compared to the botanical gardens this is a small section. However, there are so many bright and beautiful plants packed into a small area.
It is especially interesting to see the orchids named after celebrities and world leaders. There are tons of photo opportunities.
At the moment the gardens are undergoing some redevelopment so the back area of the gardens is closed.
There is a small fee to visit."
,,Simply Stunning,5.0,,"Photos don't do justice to the orchid displays, they are just stunning. So many different colour displays & varieties. A lovely walk through"
,,Nice Place to hangout in Singapore,5.0,,"We don’t need to pay entrance fee. You will feel like you’re in countryside with greenish scenery and forest scents. You can do exercises there with fresh air. If you want to explore Orchids, you need to pay SGD5. Only SGD1 if you’re student, so bring along your student card.
You should go there if you want to escape from city life on your OFF DAY or HOLIDAYS."
,,Orchids,5.0,,Must visit if u r in Singapore Colours u see in orchids have never seen before ....for kids n adults n elderly All can enjoy
,,An Orchid Lovers Paradise,5.0,,"My sister-in-law who lived in Singapore many years with the maids, marble floors and many kids once said ""orchids are awful, they're weeds!'. I'm not sure if she was trying to be a flower snob or genuinely held that opinion but I certainly don't agree with her. Singapore is blessed with a climate that orchid's love and so welcome to orchid paradise. You will see all manner of varieties and colours, some big like elephant ears and some, that I like, small and delicate, but all fascinatingly perfect. Unfortunately there is a cost for entry but you could just consider it a donation to the arts! Besides, the rest of the gardens are free so if you actually do like weeds...you might be lucky enough to find some OUTSIDE the orchid garden in the greater botanic gardens area."
,,nice 1/2 day trip,4.0,,"While this is not a bucket list item, the National Orchid Garden is a pleasant way to spend a 1/2 day away from the shopping, eating, and other sightseeing that otherwise occupies our time in this great city. Easy enough to get there by bus, but there is some walking from the nearest bus or MRT station to the Garden through the rest of the botannical garden-which itself has some attraction. The walk to the Garden is however, not all level, but nothing close to hiking. There is also a small admission fee to the Orchid Garden itself. Inside the Garden are probably a million orchids or more of all varieties, sizes, and colors. If you love orchids, you will be in heaven. I merely appreciate them, hence maybe my score of 4 stars. The Gardens are well maintained and well worth a 1/2 day trip. ."
,,Singapore National Orchid Garden,5.0,,Simply beautiful. Bloom year round. Fantastic place for photos. There are so many species of orchids. A visit will make you return for more. Never seen another like this in any part of the world.
,,Enjoy with your family. Wheel chair friendly.,5.0,,Lovely trail of flowers. It actually looks beautiful and you can take a leisurely stroll across the gardens also.
,,IN THE ORCHID-LAND,4.0,,"Orchid Garden is part of Botanic Garden. We could find a wide range of Orchids and the rare ones which we do not remember having seen anywhere else.

The system of growing & nurturing the Orchids, as evident from the exhibits, are very good.

Plan to visit this place again during our next visit to Singapore.

,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Hosted within the Botanical Gardens, the National Orchid collection is a joy to behold. Beautifully cultivated blooms of many varieties and species."
,,Excellent garden in the middle of Singapore,4.0,,"The variety of flora available is impressive and there are rest possibilities available in every few hundred meters. Unfortunately we visited on Monday, when children's area is closed, so can't comment on this part of the park.
The only downside is, that MRT is close by only on one side of the park, so either ~5km roundwalk or find out the route with bus'es on the other side of the garden."
,,Beautiful every time,5.0,,"I've been twice, once in 2013 and once this year and it is beautiful every time - and I'm not a huge flower fan! You can't ignore the beauty and the variety and how well everything is laid out. Love going and hope to go again some day."

,,Amazing Hybrid Orchids!,5.0,,"Having received so many members of royal families & foreign dignitaries; and naming orchid hybrids after them, the NOG is certainly a place worth visiting.

,,Superior to Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"Loved the Botanical Gardens and the National Orchid Garden. I arrived at the Botanical Garden before sunrise and it was so quiet I was able to hear the birds and the crickets. As the sun rose the runners and the walkers started to arrive and an hour later the tai chi groups and the maintenance workers were busy in the park. I spent 3 hours walking through the park and didn't see every part of the park. Part of the Bontanical Gardens are manicured and part are rainforest in their natural state, both were absolutely beautiful. So well planned and organized. I had to wait until 8:30 or 9 am for the Orchid Garden to open but it was worth waiting for. Absolutely stunning."

The garden is very tidy and beautifully designed and there are benches everywhere for visitors to rest. There are also numerous sculptures in the gardens which mix well with the garden scenery.
The key garden landmarks such as the golden shower arches, mist garden, enchanted garden and VIP Orchid garden are simply mesmerizing!
I definitely recommend visiting this garden!"

But, admittedly, our true destination is always the National Orchid Gardens where we spend hours. We hope the extensive 'enhancement' work will be completed soon as we miss the Mist House ...

Though there was quite a big section that was cordon off for renovation/upgrades, I still think that it is a good walk and many different types of Orchid to see.

Otherwise, it is still a great place to visit!"

The garden has a map which you really need, otherwise you would miss beautiful parts of the park. The lanes are meandering and criss crossing - easy to loose your bearings! In saying that, most areas have good access for prams, wheelchairs and elderly.

,,Gorgeous beyond all description,5.0,,"For less than the price of a Starbucks coffee, you can see a dreamscape of orchids in every hue. A few parts of the garden are under renovation, but that doesn't detract from the amazing experience of seeing the abundance of color. You'll marvel at the gold arches, overflowing fountains and orchids displayed in giant birdcages. There are also sculptures and orchids arranged in theme gardens. Allot about 90 minutes to take it all in. The only annoyance: Selfie-obsessed teenagers."

I’ve been numerous times while visiting Singapore and this summer, I’m missing visiting SE Asia. What a beautiful part of the world. Don’t miss seeing the orchids. It’ll inspire you to add to tour collection or begin one."
,,"Beautiful Orchid Garden, but the Cloud Forest is better",4.0,,"We visited the Orchid Garden the day after visiting the Cloud Forest at Gardens of the Bay.

At $5 it is an incredible place to visit and explore and houses some of the most beautiful orchids which I have to say the gardeners seem to keep in the best state with abundant flowers to see all year around. The varieties are amazing as are the arrangements. There are spider orchids on arches, others trained to grow tall, ( this is the first time I have seen this way of growing orchids) and others which spill over pots in abundance. The colours range from the dark pinks and oranges to the yellows and creams. Just beautiful. This is a park within a park but is definitely worth the special trip to enjoy it fully.

,,Orchid heaven,5.0,,I have been to many Orchid gardens in the world from America to Costa Rica and this is my favorite as it is a Orchid lovers paradise with so many beautiful species and colors. I would highly recommend it but it is quite a walk from the MRT but I did see some parking close by where u can park or take a taxi. The setting is beautiful and so much to see I just wish there was a place that you can sit down and relax and take in the atmosphere and enjoy nature’s beauty but I know that they are putting in a new building hopefully there will be somewhere to take it in.

,,"Great for Orchid lovers, pleasent but quite complex layout",4.0,,"I like orchids because flowers last a long time but still figuring out how to look after them, this place has hundreds, perhaps thousands of species so for flower lovers its probably brilliant. I quite enjoyed it but easy to get a bit lost due to maze of pathways and might suggest a map be put together with more detail but at $5 per person its good value."

My last visit shocked me and I was so disappointed. All I saw were common orchids and it was nothing like how I would imagine it to be in this day and age. We have progressed so much but our national pride and joy has become just another simple garden.

Unfortunately we weren’t able to go into the Jacob ballas garden.. because my kids were over 14 year old... that was disappointing!☹️.The management should look into this... why kids above 14 aren’t allowed in!And some entrance to the garden was close .. so we enquire with the service centre... so we had to walk to and fro twice before they told us of another entrance to JB garden!Dont the service ppl know that the entrance was closed in the first place... Most parents are w young kids... at least give proper direction b4 sending ppl on a wild goose chase !
,,Beautiful and worth a visit.,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is part of the large Singapore Botanic Gardens. It costs $5 to get in but is well worth it to see the gorgeous orchids named for Queen Elizabeth, Princess Diana and Nelson Mandela (amongst others.)"
,,Different Than the Cloud Garden,5.0,,"While the National Orchard Garden is a part of the National Botanical Gardens too, it is different than the Cloud Gardens. Since Singapore is one degree from the equator and very humid, these orchards are able to be maintained outside. I recommend a visit!"
,,VISUAL DELIGHT,5.0,,The most amazing and wonderful flowers that you can look at. The orchids have the most beautiful colours and come on different sizes and shapes. Truly a visual delight. nature is so bountiful and varied. This is a Must visit place.

I love the well thought display of colour zones, symbolising the four seasons, with yellow, gold red, pink and then whites and blues. Provide a haven for tired souls and a relief for city folks. Peaceful and artistically intermingle with matching plants and foliage to provide a truly garden experience set amongst the colourful orchids. A colourful and exhilirating experience"
,,"Orchids, Orchids, Everywhere",5.0,,The layout and colous of the Orchid gardnes is something you must see. The settings and the ways the orchids and the gardens generally are displayed would make any gardner envious. A must to see on you stay in Singapore.

,,"Orchids, Orchids, Orchids!",5.0,,"Sitting like a jewel box in the Botanical Gardens here in Singapore, for a small admission fee to the National Orchid Gardens (unless you were as lucky as I was during this school vacation period--free for us locals), your eyes get to drink in the colours and quirky good looks of orchids. Smaller ones make you wonder if they are orchids at all as you peer closely at them, and the bigger ones grab you around your ears so to speak, shouting in your face. There are those resembling dainty fairies while others are like heavily bedecked grand dames out to dazzle you. Nestled amongst trees, shrubs and in smart rows all by themselves, these orchids fascinate with their longish creeper like roots anchored on other tree barks, bricks and charcoal in pots, belying their more fastidious natures. Then there are the ""VIP ones"" named specially after visiting celebrities--more often politicians. They are housed in this charming colonial style bungalow harking to a time long gone. Mostly I marvel at how these living plants have appeared to stop time, not unlike the faded sepia photographs of past generations, while their famous, still living, namesake humans have all gone forward to mark the many years that have elapsed. I strongly recommend you walk among these botanic beauties, resetting your links to nature and reviving your spirit. Go with a loved one, friend, relative, children, visitors...everyone will feel the enchantment."
,,Great time!,5.0,,"I have lived here for 5 years and finally got the chance to visit! There’s a bit of construction going on, but it’s beautiful! The orchids are very well maintained and it’s a peaceful, serene place to walk. Definitely worth a visit!"

It is a really large undulating area of parkland with good paths and lovely planting. It also has regular free entertainment on the slope by the lake(think Crystal Palace openair concerts, but much more varied content).
For wet weather, use a brolly not a mac in that humidity. Even in the rain it gave us a wind down morning before our dreaded onward flight and felt healing after the massed tower blocks elsewhere. You need to stroll, so give it plenty of time."

,,Must see! Beautiful!,5.0,,"Lovely garden within the Singapore botanical garden. There is a small entrance fee to the Orchid area. Wheelchair friendly path covers a majority of the orchid garden, but a portion does have a few stairs. Nice shop with orchid and garden themed items as well as drinks for purchase and a restroom (though I’d walk to the next set that aren’t as crowded).
Of course with the local weather you will be hot—so you enjoy some of the shady areas and benches. Great photo spots with big and small orchids, fountains, and arches. Make sure to walk to the ‘safari’ area towards the back to see a stunning display of ‘elephant’ (large bloom) orchids."

,,Not surprisingly lots of orchids,4.0,,"There are a lot of orchids in Singapore, they are everywhere - in shops, restaurants, the airport, Gardens by the Bay, ... and even in the Botanical Gardens. But they go into overdrive in the National Orchid Garden.

We guess, from the fact that most of the orchid plants are in pots, that they swap them about to keep the garden looking good at all times, and look good it does.

The ones named after famous people were also very interesting. Definitely worth the small extra fee."
,,A lesser-known treat,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is a small enclosure within Singapore Botanic Gardens. Both are great attractions, and frankly we enjoyed them more than the over-hyped ""Gardens by the Bay"" that gets 10 times as many tourists.

,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"We visited the garden in the afternoon and although it was really hot, we enjoyed it a lot as it was so beautiful.

The garden blew us away with its breathtaking beauty and the sheer number of amazing flowers that are on show. It rained really hard whilst we were here, therefore take a mac and/or an umbrella just in case. We had about 40 minutes to take in the garden but, if you stay longer you can take in the rest of the botanical gardens - you could probably spend a good 3-4 hours here. All in all, if you like flowers and plants, then this place is magnificent."

It’s really hot so try to go at dawn and avoid going at midday as I did..."
,,Visit full of flowers,5.0,,"It's interesting to see the National Orchid Garden, for a flower enthusiast there are a plethora of species to photograph and identify. The maintenance staff is really nice and helpful however it is very important that you bring enough water and sunblock because it can get really hot (especially because you will be walking a lot). The garden where celebrities have their own flowers made for them is slightly overhyped because there are simply celebrity names next to flowers which appear to be the same as the previous 40 you've seen."

,,Stunning Orchids!!,4.0,,"I would have given an Excellent were it not for the layout of the Garden that produced some challenges in walking. To ""see it all"" requires a good deal of hiking with not a lot of places to rest. Given Singapore's constant heat and humidity (great for orchids, maybe not so great for septagenarians), more opportunities to rest and photograph the orchids would have been welcome. But it's still stunning and not to be missed."
,,Always worth a visit,5.0,,"If you're visiting Singapore, even for a stopover, take the time for this place. It's not huge so won't take long to walk around, but is beautifully arranged and once you get past the entrance surprisingly quiet."

It will be nice if they have short conducted tour too, which it did the last time I visited the garden.
Overall is beautiful and well decorated nice display."
,,Jewel of the World- Not just Singapore,5.0,,"For any nature lover, a visit to the National Orchid Garden, inside the Botanic Gardens in Singapore is a must. It is a true national treasure with the UNESCO destination, which is a high honor. It is a spectacular place for a walk, stroll, or picnic. It is the dog friendly and has food outlets and rest rooms. My friend and I walked 7 miles within the gardens and then enjoyed brunch at Bees Knees. It was outstanding and we will be back!"
,,Stunning,5.0,,The orchid is the national flower of Singapore and they celebrate it in a big way in this beautiful garden. Give yourself several hours to do justice to this garden and to explore it properly.It is a little way out of the city centre but easily accessed by public transport. Well worth making the effort to go and see it.
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"Very well organised garden with plenty of blooming orchids, very beautiful, refreshing and good photo photo. Must visit , best to visit on a sunny day."

,,Wonderful place,4.0,,"Spent an afternoon at the botanic gardens while on business in Singapore. I would highly recommend taking the time and visiting the Orchid Garden. The number and variety of orchids is amazing. It costs $S5 to get in (rest of botanic garden is free), but well worth the cost and time (~1 hour should be enough for the Orchid garden)."
,,Interesting place to spend an hour,4.0,,The National Orchid Garden is a nice place to wander around. It’s interesting to see just how many orchids there are. Certainly not the sort of place you visit for the day - unless you are an orchid enthusiast- but worth seeing if you are in the Botanic Gardens.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Take your sun glasses, water bottle and enjoy. Just beautiful! Can also do pick nick. Wear confortable and mosquito repellent!"

,,Beautiful Gardens & Park area in the City Center,5.0,,"IT was a great escape from the city center. Once you enter, it was a different world from Singapore. Large open areas of grass, plants and trees, as well as water features. Plan 4-5 hours if you really want to enjoy the gardens, as the center is about 1K from any of the entrances. The Orchid Garden has an extra charge ($5) but well worth it. Main garden was in transition so not much in bloom, but the Orchid gardens were outstanding. Cafes located through out the gardens so you can take a break. it was a great day."
,,Superb orchids,5.0,,"Sadly we had limted time here as we were on a coach tour (we could have stayed much longer). The gardens are fantastic, but be prepared for the heat and humidity if visiting in the afternoon sun. This is well worth a visit if you are at all interested in gardens and plants."
,,Natural Wonder,4.0,,"Such a beautiful and idyllic attraction, a must visit if you're visiting Singapore on a city break. A great way to spend an afternoon in one of Singapore's most 'natural attractions'

Recommend using the City hop on/off bus tour, that stops off at the Botanic Gardens, then enjoy free entry to the Gardens. For $5 you can enter the National Orchid Garden, where you can enjoy the beautiful Orchid that are grown in this garden.

,,A dream in the botanic world,5.0,,A dream visit for me and especially the Rain forest and the Orchard park. Fantastic to walk and look and all the trees and flowers and read about the different species. Everyone must see it.
,,Stunning collection,5.0,,Especially enjoyed the celebrity (world leaders collection that often reflected what type of leader / person they were. Barack and Michelle Obama’s orchid was dignified and understated with what appeared in some photos to be an American bald eagle head in the centre. David Cameron’s was washed up (how appropriated) and Maggie Thatcher’s withered and a waste of space (spot on really).
,,Orchid Mania!,5.0,,"I visited late afternoon having had lunch in the Halia restaurant nearby. I think that this was the best time of day to go, the setting sun provides a fantastic sheen to the flowers, even if you're not an orchid fan, you'll love it here. Admission was S$1 for seniors, children free, nd S$5 for adults. Good value, highly recommended."
,,The name says it all,4.0,,"A very wide selection of orchids to view, but after a short time it is rather difficult to tell the difference between one and its neighbour.

,,Beautiful,4.0,,"A bit crowded on a Sunday and I'd suggest a weekday might be better, though there were several large groups from a cruise ship so I suppose that could happen any day. It was very beautiful and highly recommended for plant lovers."
,,Worth to see but not on the top of the priorities’ list,4.0,,"Well, in Asian terms the Botanic Gardens and the National Orchid Garden are something unique. In European Terms, the Botanic Garden is a nice municipal park to spend some free time there. The National Orchid Garden - the pearl in the crown of the Botanic Garden is nice to see and experience. However, for shorter stays it could be skipped in exchange of other, more spectacular attractions of Singapore."

,,Absolutely worth a visit,5.0,,"Several areas within the National Orchid Garden are currently under construction, but this is still a can't miss attraction. The entrance fee is well worth the price as this garden is extensive and features more varieties of orchids than I have ever seen in any single location.

If you enjoy walking outdoors surrounded by beautiful scenery, The Singapore Botanic Garden and the orchid garden in particular should be at or near the top of your list of things to do in this great city. It is easy to spend 90-120 minutes walking around the orchid garden right now, and I'm sure that a visit of more than two hours will seem too short after the renovations are complete."

,,Serenity in the City,5.0,,"One of my favorite spots to chill out in whilst in Singapore, you can easily spend an entire day here. Bring a picnic lunch or eat in one of the onsite restaurants. Don't try to see the entire gardens in one go, you will miss the serenity and beauty of the place, and the heat will tire you quickly, so make sure you bring water. You can spot wildlife, weddings and people napping...maybe you will find a shady spot and join them! Oh, the Orchid house is pretty awesome too."
,,Absolutely stunning!,5.0,,We came here as part of an afternoon tour group so we only had a very limited time to spend. The flowers are gorgeous there are really no words to describe them.

,,Good for those who understand orchids.,4.0,,It was a nice garden in national botanical gardens.

The way that they decorate the garden is nice and the variety of orchids.

,,Truly for Orchid lovers,5.0,,"If you love Orchids, you should not miss this place. To reach here is a bit tough, the nearest MRT being 1.1km away. so if you can't walk through the botanical gardens, suggest taking a taxi to the main gate from the MRT."

,,Large in scale but if you were visiting Gardens by the Bay I would skip,3.0,,This garden is very large and there are a good range of orchids but I would recommend choosing either Gardens by the Bay or the Orchid Garden. No need to do both - entry is only $5 though so more cost effective perhaps that GBTB. The rest of the Botanic Gardens are incredible and well worth a visit.
,,Singapore Orchids,5.0,,"Well worth a visit. $5 entry. Can stay for hours it is so beautiful. Be aware that if traveling there via MRT (rail), the station is at the other end of the botanical gardens. If your not up to a long walk in hot muggy conditions.....catch a taxi."

,,The gem within the Botanical Garden!!,5.0,,"Yes, you can get to this from one of the auto accessible gates, but I arrived here after walking a few miles of trails in the Singapore Botanical Garden. Either way, this is an exhibit that should not be missed...gorgeous orchids in picture perfect displays and in the way they would grow naturally in the environment. Wonderful even if you don’t love gardens or flowers; but I love both and had the best time here. Many families were there and having their picture taken in the places designed for the purpose and just about anywhere: everyone was having a great time. Don’t miss this beautiful garden...totally clean and you finish with a gift shop (not that much different than the one at Gardens by the Bay) that will allow you to buy classy souvenirs of your trip to Singapore. Don’t miss out!"
,,Nice afternoon,5.0,,"I really enjoyed my time looking the many different colours of orchids. I liked the layout, even having a lot of people it didn't feel crowded."
,,Well Maintained and beautiful,4.0,,This garden was well maintained and is really beautiful. During our visit it was raining a bit so couldn't view the whole garden. But the orchids are mesmerizing.
,,April not best time,4.0,,"We visited entrance is $5S and half of the park was under renovation but it was still worthwhile to see it is out of the city on the redline hopon off bus.
Have good walking shoes and it was super hot and humid when we visited."
,,Hidden gem..,4.0,,A great place to stroll around and forget you are in one of the busiest cities in the world. Some lovely displays of beautiful flowers - who knew there were so many varieties of Orchid.
,,vague signage undermines the enjoyment,3.0,,"We liked the Botanic Garden in general. Admission to the general facility is free, but they charge $5 SGD extra to enter the orchid part. Once inside, we found the signage was pretty limited, so we didn't really know what we were looking at. We never found arrows directing us to the ""cool house"" that is supposed to replicate a mountain environment. I would return to the botanic garden, but would not again pay the orchid surcharge, if they can't make it any easier to find your way around. You are trudging around in very high heat and humidity, sweating, because that's the way Singapore is, but under those circumstances, I think most people have limited patience for wandering in circles, not being directed toward what you're there for."
,,Stunning visit...worth going,5.0,,"Stunning gardens, beautiful orchids. Recommend a visit early in the morning to avoid the heat of the day. Reserve 2 hours and just saunter through the gardens."
,,Bluerod17,5.0,,Wished here when at the botanical gardens Well worth 5$ or 1$ if you are over 60 A very interesting attraction

,,Worth a visit,3.0,,Nice to wander round but to be honest I was expecting much more we did as part of a city tour and the visit did feel rushed which I guess is no reflection on the garden but we would not make a special trip to it again
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Orchid Garden is part of larger Botanic Gardens. The Orchid Garden does charge visitors but the Botanic garden is free. Great if you love orchids but not everyone may appreciate the beauty (like young kids). Does get a little crowded.
,,Fabulous Display,5.0,,Well worth a visit to the garden. Beautiful gardens. The orchids are magnificent. Loved the ones named after famous people. The varieties are spectacular. We visited on a hot day and there were still many people around admiring their beauty. A must do when in Singapore. The entrance fee of $1 so affordable to all.

Our guide only allowed us forty-five minutes to walk the trails, hit the western style restrooms and the very nice gift shop.

The gift shop does not accept foreign curerency, but credit cards work. Prices were on the high side, but many items were exclusive to the store. You won’t find these items in China Town.

Try to plan on at least 1.5 hours for a thorough visit."
,,Just beautiful!,5.0,,"This is a must see for anyone who loves flowers! Equally, at just $5 entry it is also nice to walk around as it is quite relaxing and the colours and flowers are a nice change of the cityscape pace. Don’t forget to charge your camera battery as it is a photographer’s paradise!
My friend and I caught a taxi here (from Orchard Rd) which was around $6 due to earlier signs of rain. The information desk were also very helpful and arranged a return taxi for us.
Such a wonderful day!"
,,Amazing - worth the entry fee!,5.0,,"It's not very big - you can easily get round in an hour or so, but the orchids are amazing - so you may wish to stay longer."
,,Beautiful Greenery and Amazing Flowers,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens are made better by this amazing space. It is laid out well and it is so well kept.

Didn’t have time to do any of the other sections, although I imagine that they are beautiful as well. The grounds are impeccably Maintained. The emphasis is on the beauty of the orchids, gathered in clusters, rather then the science."
,,"stunning, stunning, stunning",5.0,,"Caught Taxi from City hotel to here, about $10.00 SD$.....amazing beautiful orchid gardens, cost $5.00 to enter or $1.00 seniors (over 60 and $1.00 children.) well worth this small amount as you get to see the orchids in their natural growth state, and the gardens are so well kept and visually enchanting. Quite a long way to walk around and some stairs and small hills within the gardens.......with the Singapore heat, you may be challenged to keep going.......Singapore is not wheelchair friendly at many places, and this garden does not have any electric buggy for tours, we found it a lot of walking and after 3 hours we couldn't do anymore. Has good toilet amenities and several cafes throughout gardens. Highly recommended as you see more here than the Bay of Gardens, which tends to be a tourist trap."
,,Beautiful and not too crowded,5.0,,It is quite a walk from the MRT to the Orchid Garden but just walking through the grounds was very pleasant. The Orchid Garden was larger than I had expected and really lived up to expectations. It was beautifully maintained and quite spectacular with a huge range of flourishing orchids.

I'm sure it's the best display of orchids in the world; Singapore has the climate, and the staff at the botanical gardens have the expertise to produce such wonderful displays.

Entry fee is minimal ($1 for seniors, $5 normally, 60p and £3 in Sterling), just compare that to attractions in say London! The orchid garden covers a reasonably large area, and you need to allow a sensible amount of time to fully explore the gardens, you'll not regret it.

I'm lost for words really, they are just amazing. A must visit while in Singapore even if you don't really like garden visits."
,,Must to visit!,5.0,,"If there could be just one place you could visit, there must be the Botanic Gardens and the Orchid Garden in Singapore."

Highly popular including with school tours so would recommend going early in the morning when it is quieter and you can more easily appreciate all of the flowers and tranquility. Also it is cooler in the morning so much more pleasant. Outstanding landscaping and maintenance of gardens. One of the best kept gardens I've ever seen.

,,Orchid extravaganza,5.0,,There is just about every type of Orchid here. Walk slow and take water as can be hot and there are some gradients to cope with. The photo shots with your partners can be spectacular though. Make sure you get the taxi to right drop off point as other wise the walk accross the park can be very long.

Try to get there early in order to beat the crowds and group visits so that you can take pictures without people getting in the way.
,,Beautiful plants but,3.0,,"So many orchids in one place should be stunning and there is no denying the beauty of those on display.
My 'but' is that it all seemed a bit contrived and stage managed which perhaps should not come as a surprise if they are to maintain the number of flowers in bloom.
I suspect that I suffered a severe dose of orchid overload which may have coloured my judgement.
The above said I did enjoy my visit and would encourage other to go as well."

We walked through the Botanic Garden to the Orchid garden from the MRT Botanic Garden station and the gardens themselves are interesting. A quiet haven within urban Singapore.

If you walk through the Botanic gardens wear sun cream/hats and take water although there are places to eat and drink."
,,The Jewel in the Crown,5.0,,"Without doubt the finest display of Orchids we have ever seen.

Large clumps of the same variety and colour of Orchid is something to see.

There are toilets in the centre of the park and cold water station. Entrance for OAPs was S$1.

This is a part of the main botanical gardens and (if not with small children) you can spend most of a day looking through this wonderful garden. The main gardens are free and the $8 Singapore for the National Orchid gardens are well worth the extra. Take your time in the main gardens rain-forest section and see birds squirrels etc all moving freely around.

,,Stunning,5.0,,"We visited the orchid garden on a city tour and were overwhelmed by the beauty of it. We only spent less than an hour there but much longer would be advised.The gardens are so tranquil and time to see and relax in them would be lovely.

,,February was the wrong time to go,3.0,,"Having been there about 10 years ago in October, I was impressed at the beauty of the flowers displayed.
This time I wanted to show was I though amazing 10 years ago to my wife, and decide to take the MRT (Metro) to go see The National Orchid Garden. 1st disappointment: it took us a long walk from the MRT station (over a kilometer) to get there trough the botanic garden, and finally arrived at the Orchid Garden. 2nd disappointment: there is no entry fee for the Botanic Garden, but you have to pay to see the Orchids. 3rd disappointment: only about 10% of the orchids had blossoms, it must have been the wrong season, or it was too hot. We didn't like it at all, and after an hour decided to leave the place, it had been a waste of time. Walking back to the MRT took a while, the return way is sparely indicated and although we had a map, got lost more then once in the Botanic Gardens. Conclusion: avoid going there by MRT, it will take two hours of your time to walk trough the Botanic Gardens to finally see a deceiving Orchid Garden in February. Go there at another season and take a cab so that you don't waste half a day."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,awesome place it is . we really enjoy that place very much. Next year we will go there again. ......
,,Visited with a tour guide,5.0,,Beautiful orchid display here. Would highly recommend a visit when in Singapore 🇸🇬. We were visiting with a guide which was interesting.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"What a lovely place to be, the gardens are quite extensive and filled with the most exquisite blooms from all over SE Asia. As the orchid is Singapore’s flower the orchid garden does make it very special. Well worth a visit"
,,Lovely flowers,4.0,,Really pleasant area of the Botanic gardens to walk round. There was a charge but not too expensive.
,,Love this gardens,5.0,,"Wish i can have these orchids in my garden. Very attractive collection. Lovely walk around the area, probably can spend most of day there. I bet its a great place for weddings."
,,Amazing range of plants,5.0,,This was on our list of 'must do' things for Singapore. The orchid displays lived up to our expectations. It is best if you can arrive early here as the gardens become busy later on.
,,Beautiful flowers,5.0,,The flowers were in full bloom when we visited. The place was well-maintained. Gardeners where very helpful to point us in the right direction when we got lost.
,,Beautiful oasis,5.0,,"We took this in as part of our visit to the botanical gardens, small admission charge but well worth it. Seeing is believing and a must see when visiting Singapore"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Amazingly well done, no picture can really capture the beauty of that place. Go see it if in Singapore."
,,A Feast for the Eyes,5.0,,"Whilst the main Botanic gardens are free,an admission charge does apply here.It is well worth paying. The orchid selection is simply stunning. So much colour and variety. The national flower of Singapore. A real feast for the eyes."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Situated in the Botanic Gardens in Singapore this is a most wonderful display of orchids in their natural habitat and with an entry fee of merely 1 SGD for over 60's visitors this visit is incredible value and a must. Although there were plenty of visitors there was ample opportunity to view and photographic the many beautiful orchids.
,,An oasis of calm and beauty (and the cheapest thing in Singapore),5.0,,Truly delightful - wish we had allowed more time - a pleasure for all the senses this really is somewhere very special
,,Excellent,5.0,,"I love this garden. there are so many types of orchids, from small pedals to big pedals. The garden may seem small, but once you are inside, it is BIG. You will not regret visiting this."
,,Beautiful collection of orchids in a magical layout - well worth the visit!!,4.0,,We enjoyed the National Orchid Garden as a family for about 45 minutes. it is well-worth the entry fee and very enjoyable addition to the park around it.
,,Beautiful Oasis of Colour,5.0,,"This garden is situated in the middle of Singapore's Botanical Gardens and requires a 1.4 km walk from the entrance at the MRT stop or of about 1.1 km from the gate at the other end (which has a bus route to the city centre). If you have a car there are closer car parks that can be used.
There is a small entrance fee (to the Orchid Gardens) - only S$1 for senior citizens! There are toilets, water fountain and gift shop (air-conditioned) and a restaurant(?).
There are hundreds of different varieties of orchid laid out in a formal manner along paths that wind up to a house at the top of a hill.
If you are ok with the walk - it is well worth a visit."
,,it has really alot of species!,4.0,,"U get to see rare species and those named after royalties and famous people who have contributed to the society e.g Wife of Dr. Daisaku Ikeda (Mrs Kaneko Ikeda) of Soka Gakkai

while the Garden tried to simulate the actual habitat of orchids, they are mostly tied to a tree rather than naturally
Nevertheless still a must visit - be prepared for 2 hours in the gardens but u need to give at least 30min to 1hr to slowly stroll from the botanic gardens' entrance
Currently part of the garden is still undergoin renovation....however, it is still worth your time! esp if you are a gardening enthusiast or Orchids lover

The only flaw is u cannot make purchases of the orchids"
,,Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,We visited the National Orchid Gardens which are situated within the main Botanical Gardens in Singapore. There was a separate $5 charge to go into the Orchid Gardens but this was well worth it. The displays were fantastic and the descriptions of the various types of flowers were very informative. The gardens also have a small shop for gifts and presents.
,,Blooming awesome,5.0,,"This Orchid Garden is payable part of Botanic Garden. The fee, though, in my opinion, is symbolic. Beauty and variety of orchids are mind blowing. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Busy but so pretty,4.0,,"The busiest part of the botanical gardens and the only part you need to pay for.
Beautiful flowers but crowded in places, liked the celebrity gRden part where you can see the new orchards named after famous people who have visited. I wonder if they match the orchid to the person? David Cameron’s was dull and complacent looking!"
,,Beautiful Garden,4.0,,Easy access through MRT. Very organized garden with uncountable orchid species in there...very beautiful!
,,If you are into flowers don't miss this,4.0,,Part of a whole bunch of themed gardens - this is the only aspect that you need to pay for - $10 entrance so not so bad. Impressive collection of flowers - well tended by the gardeners - all looking very healthy - you'll need a good hour in here
,,Fabulous,5.0,,Fabulous displays and beautiful setting. So many different types of orchid to see. Make sure you have plenty of time for your visit.
,,One of the best Gardens in the World - if not the best..,5.0,,"Situated within the free Botanical Gardens where you could easily spend a week anyway - this is an absolute must see... You will never see so many Orchids of all colours and types, anywhere else in the World."
,,Don't miss this world class display,5.0,,We absolutely loved this place - the many orchids of which some don't even look like orchids were really beautiful. It isn't easy to grow orchids but this garden beats the overpriced Gardens by the Bay.
,,nice visit,4.0,,"I am not a big fan of orchids, but I really enjoyed the visit to the Singapore National Orchid Garden. There are lots of different species and colours and on a hot day, a walk in the shadow is the best treat."
,,Don't rush this visit,5.0,,Partly closed at mom for refurbishment/improvement but still well worth viisiting. The celebrity orchid area is fascinating
,,Biggest collection ever,5.0,,"20.000 families of orchids and quite some to see here, including a lovely collection hybrids, such as the obama orchid."
,,Beautiful and good price,4.0,,"This place is so much more beautiful than the inside gardens in marina bay and the the price is reasonable (5 dollars). There is a lot of staff working and you can see it from all the colorful flowers.

Only bad thing isn’t that you need to walk pretty much to get to the garden. Shuttle service would been amazing"
,,Slightly disappointing for the price,3.0,,"While I rate the Botanic Garden very highly, Im not sure I would recommend the rather highly priced Orchid Garden quite so highly. Worth visiting but not great value for money, but older (65+) visitors can qualify for a significant discount."
,,Stunning and unmissable,5.0,,"Whether you know botany or not , whether you know anything at all about flowers or not , just go there and be stunned at the sheer variety of orchids that are grown there. Set inside the Botanical Gardens which is adjacent to the Metro station of the same name, the Orchid garden requires a good 2 to 3 hours . To go there you have to walk about 1.5 km from the entrance . Inside its all colors and sheer beauty.

Unmissable"
,,Average gardens after a long walk,3.0,,"After a long walk you get to see this garden and its okay if you have never seen orchids. But for someone who has seen flower shows or gardens elsewhere, this was an okay place."
,,So many orchids!,5.0,,"It’s amazing. For anyone who loves orchids it’s a must. The amount of species is incredible and at least when I’ve been there, most of them were blooming."
,,Orchid Mania!,4.0,,"There are a lot of different breeds of orchids in this garden, i like the vip and celebrity garden the most. A bit boring for me but those who like botany would love this"
,,Peaceful retreat,4.0,,"Located in the Botanic Gardens, the Orchid Garden not surprisingly has a lot of orchids. There is plenty of information about orchids in general, and specific species. Go in the early evening for a cooler experience, but allow time to see it all before closing time at 7pm."
,,OMG,5.0,,"A nice cup of coffee and slow meandering walk will allow you to leave all concerns at the gate. Every Orchid in the world is there,"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Excellent place to spend time looking at the beautiful orchids and at only 5$ admission great value for money. The rest of the botanical gardens are also beautiful and free admission
,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,You may spend many hours in this beautiful part of the botanical garden. It does not matter what time of the year you visit it always has an abundance of beautifiul orchids on display.
,,Quite amazing,5.0,,"Visited the gardens as part of a tour and it was the highlight. The range of orchids on show is amazing the gardens beautiful and immaculately kept, well signposted, and although the path can get a little steep at times it's not too much of an effort. There is a nice little cafe and places to sit throughout. An oasis of peace in a busy city."
,,So beautiful,5.0,,Well worth a visit with stunning displays in the most beautifully kept gardens I have ever seen. Would have loved to have seen the rest of the botanical gardens but we didn’t have enough time.
,,Beautiful orchids,5.0,,A very well maintained garden with orchids of all sorts. We went in the morning to avoid crowds. Wort a visit!
,,a must see,5.0,,"was here a long time ago, took my mom when she was over visiting , people are so nice, want you to enjoy their country, we did."
,,A must see!,5.0,,Simply stunning - don't miss it. Even if your not a orchid lover this place is worth a visit the colours and varieties are amazing.
,,Take the time,5.0,,Incredible display of orchids in a natural setting. S$5 entrance and S$1 for seniors. Located in the Singapore Botanical Gardens. Easy access by Metro. If you have the time don’t miss it.
,,Absolutely stunning!,5.0,,"So relaxing and beautiful. It is definitely worth the few extra dollars to get in. Be sure to check out the area of the orchid garden with orchids named for famous people who have visited, including Nelson Mandela. It is near the colonial building. Great photo opportunities here."
,,orchids,5.0,,The whole area of the botanical gardens was gorgeous but the orchid gardens were truly magnificent. certain times the entrance is free so should be checked out
,,Perfect,5.0,,Incredible garden . Full of beautifull flowers and col ors. Ideal place to take pictures in family. A MUST to see.
,,Orchid,5.0,,The entrance fee is cheap The orchid are beautiful The place is spacious and we can enjoy a slow stroll in the morning and evening not advisable if the weather is hot
,,Worth the price,5.0,,"So amazing! All the orchids are incredible! I guess it is the largest collection in the world! There are also orchids that are only bread here, a ""VIP"" collection. Very cool."
,,Cool greenhouse closed until 2019 :(,3.0,,"The best part of the orchid garden is apparently closed for upgrading until 2019.

It is still a nice garden with many breeds of orchids, but I think it's is more for flower lovers or photographers. If you are into neither of those, maybe that $5 is not worth it.

Oh yeah, do not forget to visit the VIP garden in that white building (forgot name) it features flowers named for special VIPs like Obama and other ministers that visited Singapore."
,,"If you like flowers and beautiful gardens, this is a must see",5.0,,"No much to say other than the Orchid displays are second to none, fantastic when we visited in February. The Botanic gardens are also very pleasant to walk through. Easy to get to on the MTR."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"What a wonderful way for anyone with even a slight interest in gardens and flowers to spend an hour or more.

An abundance of beautiful and unusual orchids I have never seen before. There was surprise as you turned every corner.

All the orchids and the garden was lovingly tended, but don’t just look at the orchids the other trees and plants were also amazing.

Remember to take your camera or a smart phone as you will be disappointed if you miss such beauty.

Worth 5 dollars of anyone’s money, 1 dollar for seniors."
,,Amazing selection of Orchids,4.0,,"The Orchid Garden is located at the far end of the Singapore Botanical Gardens. It is about a mile walk with beautiful gardens, trees, along the way. The Orchid Garden has a $5 fee. Well worth it!!"
,,Fully in Bloom,5.0,,I was at the garden in October 2017 and returned in February 2018 and I was in awe of the abundance of colour and size of flowers. Do not miss this attraction
,,Beautiful garden,4.0,,Not much in bloom but the grounds are amazing will definitely come back in the spring to see the orchids in bloom well worth the time and very reasonably priced
,,MISS IT AT YOUR PERIL!!!,4.0,,"If you miss a visit to this place you will deny yourself an experiance that you will regret for the rest of your life. Take your camera and prepare to be ""gob-smacked""."
,,The best S$1 of the entire trip,5.0,,"The orchid garden is situated within the much larger Botanic Gardens near the Orchard Road entrance, about a one mile walk through Botanic Gardens from Botanic Gardens MRT station.

Regular admission charges are S$5 (great value) but as seniors this was reduced to S$1.

The gardens are immaculately maintained with wonderful orchids everywhere growing out in the open air. I am sure that visitors with a knowledge of these flowers would find much of interest, but to us they were simply beautiful.

In the heat of the afternoon we strolled slowly, taking many photos. There were plenty of places to sit down and take a breather.

Had we time we would have returned first thing in the morning when, I am told, the orchids are more fragrant."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Sure worth the few bucks! Small garden with all colours & types of orchids. Also make sure to walk by the Swan lake in the Botanical garden.
,,Love Orchids,4.0,,Just amazed of how many different orchids there are. The color and display were wonderful. Very well kept and always attended to.
,,Stunning,5.0,,So much beauty is hard to convey.Top garden design and such a large variety of orchids.

,,A Place to be for Orchid Lobers,4.0,,For orchid lovers this is the place to be. Botanical Garden and National Orchid is just on this premise. You can find here 1000 orchid species in its full bloom.
,,Beautiful Orchids,5.0,,It is inside the Botanical Garden. This part of garden has entry charges. Luckily we entered inside free of cost. You can spend several hours wandering about a gorgeous collection of all kinds of orchids.
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Worth the entry fee (as a student it was only about 50p!) and so so beautiful. It's very peaceful in there too and the displays of orchids are amazing. I'm not at all a flower or garden admirer usually but this place really is special.
Much more impressive than the gardens by the bay/ flower dome areas which get so much more attention and a lot cheaper too!"
,,So beautiful!,5.0,,We took MRT Botanic Garden stop and walked to the orchid garden. You can't say you didn't see enough orchids after a visit here. Beautifully displayed. $5 entrance fee.
,,Pretty,4.0,,A lot of orchards to see. Nice area of botanical garden but quite busy. Easy paths to walk or wheel. $8 adult when I visited Catch MRT direct to botanic gardens. 1.3km walk to the orchid garden
,,Fabulous,5.0,,Don’t miss this. Absolutely gorgeous and worth the small admission price within the free main garden.
,,Tourist spot,5.0,,"This is a big tourist stop so is inevitably busy but it's quite large so you can escape the crowds. The orchids are the stars, so many beautiful flowers, and every area is immaculate of course. Some areas are currently closed for redevelopment."
,,ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING,4.0,,Really it’s absolutely fascinating. A vast number of wonderful orchids to marvel over. The overall layout is brilliant and the VIP section is particularly interesting. Costs to get in but well worth the expense.
,,Fantastic Orchids,5.0,,"Really Enjoyed visiting the Orchid Gardens, some spectacular orchids, never knew there were so many."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"who knew there were so many different types and colours of orchid? We only had time for a short visit , but it was fab, and a pleasant walk."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"We visited these gardens on a last day tour before flying home they were absolutely beautiful the orchids were out of this world, we had an 1 hour to walk around this was no way long enough if you visit these gardens I suggest that you do it on your own to allow for extra time YOU WON'T BE DISSAPPOINTED"
,,Strangely interesting,5.0,,"I didn't have high hopes for this one however it truly surprised me. For obvious reasons, plenty of flowers but also a butterfly garden and interesting bird. We also enjoyed a truly cool peecock who didn't consider himself a peecock at all, more like a human. Very amusing"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Fantastic orchids. Lovely walk around. Some displays closed but still worth it. Definitely recommend
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"This was well worth the visit. Lovely grounds and beautiful orchids. It’s easy to get to via MRT and if you want to spoil yourself , book lunch at The Corner House. Reservations a must!! Highly recommended."
,,Wonderful Orchid Garden,5.0,,Is incredibly beautiful and worth the $6 entry in my opinion. There are orchids that have been cross bred and named after visiting dignitaries and politicians that can only be seen there. There is also a series of beautiful paths to be followed.
,,Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful!,5.0,,"After a taxi ride from the hotel we arrived here. If you are interested in Orchids DO NOT MISS the National Orchid Garden!!
It is a sprawling park like environment with almost every variety of orchids displayed in their nature habitat. Beautiful at every turn! The casual visitor can walk the Garden in two hours. The Orchid aficionados could take a whole day or more.
We ate lunch at the basic restaurant at the entrance of the Gardens. The food was quite good and reasonable value. Very helpful friendly staff. Take the taxi ride!"
,,National Orchid Garden,5.0,,A long walk in at the Singapore Botanic Garden but worth it. Beautiful orchid displays artfully arranged. Includes a variety of orchids named after famous visitors to the garden.
,,just beautiful.,5.0,,"one of our highlights of Singapore. We would not have missed this for the world. Easy to get to , need to be fit as there is a steep climb to the Orchid House"
,,A beautiful place,4.0,,Although it was pouring with rain when we went the beauty of the plants was wonderful to see. It did not take very long to walk around.
,,A must for anyone keen on gardens or gardening,4.0,,Wonderful selection of orchid varieties from around the world - all contained within an ultra-modern space and well maintained.
,,A Must See If You Love Orchids,5.0,,"If you love orchids, this garden is a must. For a modest 5 SGDs, you can spend several hours wandering about a gorgeous collection of all kinds of orchids. It is inside the free Botanical Garden, and from any entrance you have to walk about 10-15 minutes to get to the entrance. It was also a little tricky to find. When you see the National Orchid Garden sign that many people will be taking pictures in front of, look to the RIGHT and enter the little building. You then pay a fee and go through some turnstiles to enter the garden. I went on a Sunday and it was pretty empty, even though tons of people were taking pictures out front. It seems that many are turned off by the modest fee the park charges. It is well worth it!!

Don't go to the left of the National Orchid Garden sign. The walkway to the left has some orchids so it's deceiving, but you're just walking in the free Botanical Garden section."
,,Singapore delightful Gardens,5.0,,"Fantastic gardens and plant collections, well cared for with a great restaurant and facilities. A really good day out take a brolly just in case"
,,A feast of flowers,5.0,,"I know that it is a gaggle of geese, a herd of cattle and a flock of birds, but I am not sure of the collective description for many orchids together. Wording aside, the walk (and it was very hot on the day we went) is worthwhile, just taking in all the colours of the beautifully presented and beautifully maintained orchids."
,,Orchid Lovers... this is your Jam!!,5.0,,Lovely place to be in. Big and has probably a thousand variety of orchids. Thanks for maintaining it so nicely. I wish I could have some orchids taken back to india and have them planted in my garden. Thanks team.
,,Simply Stunning,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden was simply stunning. The grounds are impeccable, and the orchids are beautiful. This was my favorite attraction on my trip!"
,,Most Impressive,5.0,,A favorite spot to visit when in Singapore. The orchid garden so beautiful and well maintained with an amazing number of varieties. There is a nominal (1 SGD) entrance fee for the Orchid Gardens.
,,Wonderful!,5.0,,To my eyes at least this was an exceptional experience. The orchids were absolutely fantastic and the gardens are beautifully laid out.
,,Wow,5.0,,You could not be more amazed at all the orchids What a wonderful garden If you don’t visit this garden it will be your loss
,,Beautiful and tranquil.,5.0,,"Really enjoyed the National Orchard Garden. You can take your time, it appears relatively easy walking. I used my mobility scoooter comfortably. There was signage to assist me in taking the right paths. Refreshments are avaliable, which is a must with the hot humid weather. We were with a bus group so entrance fees were included. If you have time, you could comfortably speed at least a couple of hours there."
,,Orchids in rows,3.0,,"Having worked in the horticultural industry, I felt that there was something missing here in originality. Well maintained, but plants just don't grow in rows."
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"Its a must see when you visit Singapore the orchids are amazing and the gardens are very easy to walk around, the surroundings very tranquil with little areas to sit and just relax."
,,A must see venue.,5.0,,"Outstanding! This was the highlight of our 5 days in Singapore, the best collection of orchids in the world we have seen. If you have the time it is a must see place."
,,Absolutely amazing orchid garden!,5.0,,"A must visit place for all the orchid fans! The orchid garden is inside of the botanical gardens, and the only place where you need to buy an entrance ticket amazing arrangements of all the different kind of orchids in the world! reserve lots of time to walk here and get to see all the different areas of this garden. Take a map with you as well, and sit down every once in a while to rest your feet from all the walking ‍♀️. I recommend this garden though straight in the morning as a first place to visit so it’s not too crowded! ☝️"
,,Very colourful,4.0,,"This is in the botanical gardens and lovely to visit with variety of orchids plus has a shop there as well. Reasonable with their pricing. The botanical gardens are well set out and magnificant. The botanical gardens can be reached by bus or walking i.e. from Orchard Road about 25 minutes bit warm walking but by looking at some fantastic houses, a couple of consulates on the way you dont really notice it. There are plenty of seats around and you can feed fish in some areas and cost $1 capsule to feed them"
,,Stunningly beautiful and affordable,5.0,,"As a person allergic to many plants I loved this place as it seems I'm not allergic to anything there.
You can reach it by going by metro to the Botanic Garden stop, entering the garden and then following the signs to find the orchids. It is definitely worth the walk - the garden is stunning, great place for photography and a great blend of colors and shapes. The garden also has restrooms, as well as a nice shop with non-kitschy souvenirs, even if the prices are a bit spicy. Overall, a truly great place for 5 5 dollars!"
,,A place of equistive beauty,5.0,,We knew nothing about orchids when we started but were in love with them . The displays are spectacular!
,,Delightful show of orchids,5.0,,An excellent hour spent wandering around the gardens with so many different orchids on show. Well worth the visit and the cost.
,,"""Just Amazing""",5.0,,Do not miss this amazing orchid garden an extraordinary collection in the most beautiful surroudings. So many photographic opportunity's and the colors were just stunning. The garden sits in the grounds of the Botanic gardens and costs 5 Singapore dollars for an adult or just one dollar for a senior over sixty.
,,The Jewel in the crown...,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is truly an amazing part of the incredible Singapore Botanic Gardens. If you haven't much time, then head straight for this area. There is a small admission charge of 5SGD (concessions 1SGD) but this garden is worth far more than that! The colour, form, numbers and varieties of orchids are simply breathtaking and the manner they are displayed enhances the obvious beauty of these magnificent plants. Every time we visit Singapore, the botanic gardens and the orchid garden are usually the first place we visit. There is a specified opening time ( 8-30am I think) and in our experience, the earlier you can visit, the better. We have found that most organized tours seem to arrive from 10am onwards and the orchid garden can get very busy.
There's a celebrity section where orchids named after prominent visitors are displayed.
On this occasion we visited, some sections were closed off for renovation and development work but there is still so much to admire.
Fully charged camera/mobile phone batteries are essential!
At the exit there is a small but well stocked gift shop and nearby are toilets and refreshments.
Of all the ""must see"" attractions in Singapore, the orchid garden must be top of the list!"
,,Orchid Garden inside Botanic Garden,5.0,,"The botanic Garden of Singapore is just a magic park with beautiful trees, and statues! The orchid garden is awesome ! If you like flowers and especially Orchids don’t miss it. If you go early morning before 8:30 you will see lots of people doing Tai-chi, and other arts!
I live near by and love walking my dog and taking photos! Sorry not with my phone!"
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,"Even though some areas of the orchid garden were closed, there was still plenty to see. The variety of plants, the colour, the perfume, the landscaping were all a delight."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The sights, the smell, the tranquility. This was a lovely experience, meandering through beautiful flowers that are clearly well looked after and Someone’s pride and joy. The VIP section was interesting and the information was adequate without being overbearing."
,,ALONE OR WITH THE BOTANIC GARDENS - A TREAT,4.0,,"My wife loves Orchids so I knew we were going and it did not disappoint.

The area is fairly large and I read they have over 1000 different orchids. I did not count but maybe there are more. The range is amazing. Sizes, shapes, colors abound. You will not think of orchids quite the same way again.

We found it easier and lesser crowds if we went right after in the gate and all the way to the top of the hill then slowly feast your eyes as you easily come down"
,,"Any Flower-Lover's Dream and Simply, Orchid Heaven",5.0,,"At SGD $5, this attraction offers visitors unbelievable value. I love orchids! One orchid plant, beautiful. Visiting a nursery and seeing a bunch of orchids, way beautiful. Visiting an orchid garden? Way too beautiful! If you are thinking of visiting the SBG, the National Orchid Garden is an absolute must. Surely you will not be disappointed."
,,Heaven for orchid lover,5.0,,"This located inside Singapore Botanical garden. We can go there by mrt, then walking inside the garden to reach this one. Don't worry, you will see beautiful scenery during walking here.
My mom is orchid lover, so i took her to this place. She love it so much. There are many varieties of orchid here. I can't stop take picture of them. Lovely.
You can buy souvenirs too before out from this garden. Please wear comfortable shoes and hat/umbrella (if needed), and bring mineral waters. Actually you can get free water near the gate, but explore this garden will need some time so it is better to bring your own bottle."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Attached to the Botanical gardens. Small entry fee but well worth a visit. If you visit the Botanical gardens it would be a shame to miss this attraction.
,,Good place for Orchid lovers,4.0,,Went there with friend. Friend was not very interested in flowers. But after visiting the garden he was also fascinated by the different types of colorful Orchids.
,,Nice walk,5.0,,"Love this place. Beauty of orchids, some freezy zones which is always a good idea in tropics, cheap ticket... been there many times, always enjoyed it!"
,,Beautiful orchids,4.0,,We went there after visiting the Botanic garden! We went there in January and there wasn't too many orchids blooming! So I would recommend going there in March!
,,Outstanding beauty & well laid out,5.0,,"Even though it’s not the best time to visit the orchid garden, it was a fabulous one; I am still stunned by the beauty. Well laid out & easily accessible for those with pushchairs or wheelchairs. Every corner presented a new vista - a revelation. There is some construction going on for newly upgraded areas to be open in 2019 which I think will add a new dimension to this stunning garden!"
,,"Beautiful, just wander (with your umbrella)",5.0,,"Bring your umbrella, it rained for the whole of our visit but it didn't spoil anything the orchids are beautiful whether it's wet or dry (it's cooler in the rain). Pick your route carefully as there are places with some steep paths & steps.

I liked the garden where famous people have plants named after them, but I actually liked the whole place just wished we had longer here as we were on a tour."
,,Stunning setting!,5.0,,"If you have the time dont miss this, the suggested walk bring you close up to endless lines of orchids - very very cool"

,,Beautiful.,5.0,,"Leisure walk around the orchid garden. Fascinating to see the varieties and impressive to think how well the gardeners take care of these. One must pay 5$ to enter. For the chance to stop and admire the orchids, it’s worth it!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Must go! I love Orchids and have seen them all over the world and by far this was the best exhibition I have seen. Check out my photos. It is part of the Singapore Botanical gardens, but it cost $5 to get it. Trust me when I say well worth it!"

There is much to see, so one could spend from 1 to 3 hours strolling and admiring orchids of practically every imaginable size, shape and color. As one might expect, not everything is blooming all the time, which is fine. There are always enough orchids in bloom in every section of the garden. Sometimes, it is just nice to sit and take in the beauty that surrounds you."

,,Dazzling. A credit to Singapore.,5.0,,"The Orchid collection is around 1200m walk from the Botanic Gardens MRT station with the last part slightly uphill. There's plenty to see on the way, including the palm collection and the rain forest loop that adds around 15 mins to the journey. There is a lot of bird song in the trees and, if you're lucky, you may see oriental pied hornbill as well as minah birds. On the ground we came across a monitor lizard and several very tame birds that we later identified as red legged crake.
Entry to the orchid garden is a modest $5 per person which comes down to just €1 for seniors on production of documentation. The display in the building at the top of the hill gives the story of orchid breeding and has pictures of famous people after whom orchids have been named. There are orchids of all sizes and hues, all beds are immaculately maintained and paths are constantly swept. Even a non-gardener can appreciate this jewel of Singapore."

It is quite a walk from the station but there are lots to see along the way. We saw several tai chi groups performing, many exercise groups, a monitor and a squirrel as well as lush tropical vegetation. The souvenir shops also provide welcome relief from the heat and have some lovely reasonably priced gifts. There are so many beautiful orchids to be amazed by, my camera was clicking all the time."

,,Down Under tour,5.0,,As part of our hotel city tour we had 1 hour to visit the site. Clearly this was not long enough but the whole tour was only 3hours so we expected a short time. We went into stealth mode to quickly cover all the site. The smells and sights were simply amazing. We stopped at certain points to appreciate the views. The site is on a bank so expect to climb steps and ramps. If we had time we would have either stayed or returned. Well worth a full half day.

,,Amazing ....just amazing!,5.0,,"We loved this place other than a tour group was there right ahead of us so....we went the opposite way. I live in Hawaii and have lots of orchids and other plants on my 1.5 acres and I took note of how they planted the thousands of orchids, ti, bushes etc. The Orchid Garden has been working with orchids since 1938 and have so much to show for their efforts with many developed and one of a kind. Part of how great the whole garden is is how they have designed the garden. There are many orchids there that I've seen but, never in the way they displayed them so well. I've never seen 8' tall orchids like they have...unbelievable. Well worth going!"

There are various collections of orchid in a variety of colours.
It is a modest price toview these lovely flowers."

,,Brilliant and magnificent garden,5.0,,We have been to Singapore a number of times but never quite made it to the botanic gardens and more specifically the orchid gardens.

The orchids are incredible and while it costs $5 to enter it is most assuredly worth it.
,,Absolutely Stunning!,5.0,,The National Orchid Garden was one of the highlights of our trip to Singapore. It was amazing for us to see such a wide variety orchids - all kinds of colors and sizes- growing outdoors. The arrangements were stunning and everything was immaculately maintained. Highly recommended.
,,This place is absolutely gorgeous!,5.0,,"This garden is one of the gardens at the Singapore Botanic Gardens.
There is a minimal entrance fee to see this place. 5SGD for adults & 1SGD for senior citizens. Not sure about the kids. So make sure you bring your passport if you want to avail of the senior citizen discount. It is also a bit humid inside,so make sure you hydrate yourself. :)

This place is just absolutely an eye candy! You can't visit SG and not see this place.
There is plenty of benches around the garden, so you can rest and sit and literally smell the flowers.

They must have thought of elderly people when they built it since there is a ramp. It is very helpful especially for older people (and for those who are not elderly but have knee problems).

I love this place!"
,,Beautiful and peaceful place,5.0,,"We really liked the Botanical park and the National Orchid garden - a lot of different kinds of orchids are there, everything is very well groomed, fresh and beautiful.

,,A must visit,4.0,,"These gardens are a delight to anyone who has any interest in gardening or nature. They are well laid out, easy to navigate and contains so many beautiful orchids. The only downside is the staff in the gift shop who have little interest in customer service. This is a shame as it detracts from the place and is the last impression when people leave. In my experience this is unusual in Singapore where everyone is so polite, pleasant and helpful."

Visit this place in the morning. Do not keep this for evening."
,,Lovely experience,5.0,,"It would have been 15 years since a last visit here and this time a visit to the Gardens also included the orchids. They are well worth the cost of the entry (make sure to take your Seniors Card or pension card if possible and it will only cost you $1). The displays are gorgeous, especially those set up especially for photographs but make sure you look up and wander the smaller paths for some hidden treasures. This has been upgraded considerably and with the addition of a MRT station at the front gate of the gardens, no excuse for a visit!"

While here, we focused on getting to the National Orchid Garden (separate entry fee S$5).

,,"It was alright, but I'm not really into orchids.",3.0,,"If you're into orchids, I'd say definitely check this place out. If not, I'd say you can just check out pictures. I visited when it was insanely hot and humid, so walking around in an non-airconditioned garden was very uncomfortable. Especially when I'm not that into orchids. I did enjoy seeing the orchids that were bred?? and named after world leaders."
,,Must visit place,5.0,,"Highly recommended place for visit. Beautiful sceneries , niceley arranged and well mainataibed. And don't forget to shop for unique jewelery with real orchid flowers"
,,National Orchid Garden,5.0,,An amazing place with amazing orchids. It also caters to the disabled visitor---good to see. It has a small but nice gift shop. Go first thing in the morning before it is crowded.
,,A must see - the most beautiful orchid garden in the world!,5.0,,The Orchid Garden showcases all the various orchids including special VIP orchids in their natural outdoor setting. Magnificent landscaping providing the most colorful and picturesque photo opportunities!!! Exceeded my expectations. Don't miss it!
,,Orchid lovers delight,5.0,,"This is by far the most stunning orchid garden I've ever visited, with some 5,000 species on display. Only planned to visit for an hour or so, ended up spending 4 hrs there. Very peaceful and with plenty of seats available throughout to sit and admire. Excellently maintained and a must se and do if you love orchids."
,,OMG! Orchid overload!,5.0,,What a place! $5SD to get in from the Botanic garden and well worth ever cent. Well laid out not too big to navigate around in the heat. Spent a good hour or so here and took some amazing photos. If you like orchids or just want see some amazing displays of plants pay the place a visit. Gift shop on site.
,,Good place to daydream and stroll.,4.0,,"I visited the National Orchid Garden as part of spending a ""girl's day out"" with a good friend. It has wonderful photo opportunities for all levels of photographers. I found I had some really lovely photographs from the visit as I did take time to focus on the orchids and it was relaxing on this point as well.

I did find it difficult at some spots - the most photographed ones it was easy to see to actually take a picture without someone stepping into the camera range. However it is a national (international as well I suspect) to gain these photos and I did give up on some. However as the time we travelled on in the park people were not as close in walking together. My friend and I had a wonderful time having some time to chat and walk around the park. It is humid here, the orchids grow so wonderfully so you will see why. Take plenty of water and don't race around the park.

The orchids and gardens are beautiful. It is a tranquil and enjoyable place to take a stroll with a friend or partner as something relaxing to do together outside of the hustle and bustle of the city.

I bought a cushion cover with an image of an orchid on the front of the cover. It seemed quite well made. Not cheap but it looks as though it is good quality for a gift. Assortment of colours. Other items to purchase as well in the shop.

The park is never boring if you visit different parts each time which I have had the lucky opportunity to do so."
,,Simply Stunning,5.0,,What a magnificent example of orchids at their very best. The garden is a tribute to the many that care for its beauty. There is a small entrance fee of S$5.00 or S$1.00 for concession holders. More than worth the visit.
,,Lots of orchids,4.0,,"If you like flowers you will love this place. Was a bit over it by the end but well worth seeing and only $5 sg each. Girl on reception looked totally uninterested and I'm pretty sure would not have even noticed if we had walked past without a ticket. Quite a few displays were not flowering but the staff were busy putting new flowers out. One of the few gift shops that I bought something, not only touristy gimmicks."
,,Always spectacular,5.0,,"Visited to admire and photograph the orchards. Always something new and they keep the area very clean and tidy.

Worth a visit when in Singapore.

It appears that and an extension to the underground train will have a stop near the botanic gardens so you will soon be able to sue that to get there."
,,Lovely place,5.0,,Very serene place! A good way to relax and enjoy nature and flowers. Entrance was free for residents and that was a plus! Prepare for walking because the place is big.
,,A must see,5.0,,We spent more than two hours in the National Orchid Garden. Countless wounderful colours and forms of orchids.
,,Fantastic and Unique,5.0,,"This is truly a special attraction in Singapore, if not in the world. In all my travels all over I have not experienced such a wide array of perfectly colorful orchids in all colors, sizes, shapes and presentations. Gosh, everyone was taking photos every two or three feet there is so much to take in and capture on your camera.

The National Orchid Garden is part of the Singapore Botanic Gardens and charges a very reasonable admission fee. it was well worth the nearly 1.5 hours that I spent there. There are maps of the Orchid Garden too which are well displayed throughout. You can see the VIP section of famously named Orchid hybrids, some other well known orchids, several special places designated, to take photos, special arched walkways and some water features too.

Lots of varied species, brilliant colors too. For me, I had never seen this many orchids in one place, growing wild in a garden so to speak instead of some small special greenhouse somewhere. That made this even more special.

The sights, sounds, orchids smells and whole experience start to finish is what I will remember. Well worth the visit - don't miss it."

,,A Highlight of my StopOver,5.0,,"Don't be put off by the small entry fee (entry to the Botanic Gardens is free) Although we are getting used to orchids as house plants/gifts and they may not feel as exotic as they once were, seeing the variety and the masses of different orchids was spectacular."

The Garden has beautifully decorated sites with Orchid for photo ops. A must visit. You need a good half day to enjoy it all."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Part of the botanic gardens. I just happened upon it while walking through the gardens. I am not an orchid enthusiast but I could appreciate the effort that has been put in to grow and maintain these beatiful flowers.

Very peaceful. You don't even realize you are in a huge city. Quiet."
,,A magnificent wonderland of Nature's finest orchids.,5.0,,Well worth the trouble of finding the Orchid Plaza in the centre of a maze of paths in the Botanical gardens (I got lost).

,,An obsidium paradise,5.0,,Fantastic place even if you're not a fan of orchids. All the plants are in a totally natural environment and well wort the admission fee. You need to allow a couple of hours for the gardens and a reasonable level of fitness is required as there is some climbing up and down a sealed road.

,,Awesome,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is within the confines of the Botanic Gardens and easily accessible by MRT. I don't think I can convey in words how beautiful this orchid garden is. Mind you orchids are one of my favourite flowers so I guess that I am somewhat biased. Never before have I seen so many different colours, sizes and shapes of orchids all together in one area. But it is not just the orchids, but also the supporting greenery, statues, pathways, seats, walls, arches, water features, etc that bring the whole thing together to form a cohesive whole that is so very pleasing to the eye.
They have a gift shop, which also sells some snack type things, and toilets are right next door. All this for just $1 for Seniors and I think $5 for others; worth every cent."

,,Beautiful Flowers,5.0,,The colours in the National Orchid Garden are so beautiful. There are so many different types of orchid and the meandering pathways seem to absorb the crowds so it doesn't feel crowded.

There are lovely shaded areas though and some cooled glasshouses with tropical flower displays. Don't miss the unique orchids bred and named for an eclectic mix of politicians and royalty, who have happened to visit Singapore over the years.

,,Singapore National Botanical and Orchid Gardens - Lovely and Relaxing Visual Splendor,5.0,,"I visited the Botanic Gardens on 30 July 2017 with business colleagues, as one of the stops on our hop-on, hop-off 1-day tour of the city. The Singapore Botanic Gardens and the National Orchid Garden are lovely to view. The caretakers of the grounds do a wonderful job of keeping the gardens looking pristine. After the hustle and bustle of the city and its sites a visit to the gardens was relaxing and energizing. Just being surrounded by this much beautiful nature is soothing to the mind and soul. So switch off your smartphone for a bit and step back and enjoy nature. You will be glad you did."

We decided to go on in, seeing as the entry fee is very low and that it was an iconic spot in Singapore. Our taxi driver was even raving about it the next day, so you know it's legit.

The orchids are truly dazzling, and we forgot our irritation from the heat for a good hour or so. They have many orchids that you will not see elsewhere, as they were created in the gardens themselves. I would definitely recommend this garden, which seems so delicate and intricately curated compared to the jungle-like Botanical Gardens surrounding. Both are a must-see in Singapore."

If you are going to the Botanical Gardens, don't miss the National Orchid Garden."

Went with kids and they weren't massively bored, although there is nothing child-related in the garden. Afterwards we went to the large grassy area to the right of the entrance to let them run around and also to the learning forest at the other side of the botanical gardens entrance. At the learning forest they provide a card of 'things to spot' which the kids failed to spot any of leading to some frustration but they did over all like the forest and the big bridge across the lake."
,,Beautiful orchids & annoying selfie sticks,5.0,,"The NOG is part of the lovely Botanical Gardens. The entry cost of $S5 is very, very reasonable. Inside is a section for orchids named after famous people. This can cause some hilarity when the blooms of certain well-known leaders are withering or non-existent. There are paths down to different sections including a 'cold' house. What was most annoying were the number of selfie sticks whose owners believe make a pleasing addition to your photo. My advice? Be brutal. They can wait and have some manners. The parts nearest the entrance are worst. Maybe they can't be bothered with the rest."
,,A must,5.0,,The orchid garden is so impressive. It is huge and so much to see. Admission is $5 and $1 for pensioners. The orchids are beautiful and there are hundreds of varieties. Definitely worth a visit.

WE GOT LOCKED INSIDE beware!,5.0,,"loved the way they had the Orchids as if in a natural setting and not a greenhouse. they had amazing colors and shapes, for sure one of the best collections in the world, as Singapore's climate is perfect for this and doesn't need a greenhouse. BEWARE THEY CLOSE AT 6 pm (?) WE GOT LOCKED INSIDE and had to SCREAM FOR HELP!! A funny ordeal, however we missed the restaurant reservation because it took them some 50 minutes to get a guard that had a key to open the chains on the door. THERE WAS NO WARNING THAT THEY CLOSE DOWN and website stated closing hour 24:00! Crazy!"

,,Stunning!,5.0,,"We used to live right down the street and never really stopped into the Orchid Garden on our daily walks in the Botanic Gardens. Back on a visit and decided to stop in. Boy, did we miss out! Make sure you stop in and take a look. It won't take more than an hour of your time."
,,A joy for the senses,5.0,,A must for any visit to Singapore. I have been coming here since my first visit and witnessed the addition of the Cool and Mist Rooms. Unfortunately on this my latest visit these were closed for renovation and will not open till 2019.

This is a beautifully laid out garden with a diversity of orchid that is unimaginable. Every colour, combination, size etc is represented in beautifully presented gardens. From the outside of the display, you can't realise how big this actually is so make sure you allow enough time.

Taking the mrt to the gardens is simple and a 1km walk to the orchid garden takes you through the many different themed gardens. Only 1 small hill otherwise a flat walk.

The cool house is filled with many different varieties and a soothing waterfall.

,,Gleeful visit for Orchid lovers,5.0,,"This garden is not as big as the botanic garden. It is appreciated that they managed the garden well by subdividing the places to place different kinds of orchids, such as cool zone and a zone with many special kinds of orchids.

I thought the garden would take 10 minutes to walk around, but in true Singapore fashion they don't do things by half, and I spent over an hour here. Make sure you visit the VIP garden where there are strains of orchid which have been named after visiting heads of states and politicians (Merkel, David Cameron amongst others)."

,,How do they keep them flowering?,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is housed in the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The gardens are huge and we had neither the time nor energy to cover everything but aimed directly for the orchid garden.
We were met at the entrance to the Botanic Gardens by a helpful staff member who gave us a quick description of the area and armed us with a site map. Entry to the Botanic Gardens is free but there is a small charge for the Orchid House.
The Orchid House is, according to the signs, a 450 metre walk from the front gate. I strongly suggest you wear a hat or carry an umbrella because there is little shade along the way. We also visited in May when it is not only hot but also very humid. We were dripping by the time we arrived at the Orchid House.
Once inside the plants and flowers were magnificent. How they managed to have so many of their orchids flowering at one time is difficult to understand, but it does make a magnificent display. This place is strongly recommended if you are interested in orchids.
After this we had another searing 450 metre walk back to the front gate. Thankfully there is a cafe style restaurant at the gate that sold cold drinks. We had several before moving on."
,,Worthy of money you spent!,5.0,,All kinds of Orchid flowers could be found. Many nice places to shoot photos. The Orchid named after celebrities are interesting. Cool house a little bit boring. Worth a visit!

When we entered the orchid area we were not disappointed with the display and found it to be tranquil and we'll sign posted."
,,Lovely Gardens,5.0,,"Get the underground and its only a 2 minute walk. The gardens are free to enter, you just have to pay $5sd to enter the Orchid garden, fully recommend you do this. You can spend a good half day walking around the gardens, nice and peaceful away from the busy town life."
,,Stunning haven in midst of city,4.0,,Beautiful space where you can discover exotic flowers and trees. Very special and well worth the visit. Entrance fee was $5. Can't imagine how much it takes to keep that place going so the entrance fee seemed reasonable!
,,Prepare to be awed,5.0,,"$5 for the adult entrance fee. No words could describe it, photos might do, but I lost all my photos due to missing memory card, such a shame.

,,Every Orchid lovers dream attraction,4.0,,"The Singapore Botanical gardens (free admission) are beautiful and I recommend a visit if you have time. Within the gardens is the National Orchid Garden which requires a small entrance fee, $5 SD and its well worth it. I have been there at least 5 times and it still amazes me.

,,One of the best orchid collections,5.0,,"This deserves a separate review fom the Botanical Gardens, and worth the few bucks paid to enter it. OK, so most of the orchids are not enormous and in-your-face. But many are really interesting -- unusual colours like almost-black purple, twisted petals.

,,Incredibly breathtaking orchids.,5.0,,"Within the Botanic Gardens is the National Orchid Garden. Obviously the steamy climate is perfect for orchids and they grow happily in the flowerbeds of the garden. Some grow naturally in the ground whilst others are grafted or attached to other structures to exhibit them in all their magnificence. The variety and beauty of these impressive flowers was simply staggering, there are literally tens of thousands of orchid plants on display and the sheer number of them blew us away. Pristine is a word I appear to repeatedly use whilst describing Singapore and it's one I'd certainly use for the Orchid Garden. If flowers do it for you, then you'll be delighted here, around every corner is a floral tableau that would not look out of place at the Chelsea Flower Show. Take cold wet hand towels and fluids to combat the tropical heat, and a parasol/umbrella to shield you from the sun, and you'll have a wonderful time."

,,"Located inside Singapore Botanical Gardens - calm, beautiful, well cared for plants (MRT Botanic Gardens)",4.0,,"These gardens are 1 Singapore Dollar for students with ID and 5 S Dollars for adults.

,,As beautiful as always.,5.0,,"I have visited these gorgeous Orchid Gardens on many occasions. A visit to Singapore wouldn't be the same for me without looking at these beautiful flowers.The temperature is so necessary to have the many Orchids staying at this calibre.

,,Nice but not really worth to go if you are travelling in SG for only a few days,4.0,,The orchids were all amazing. You have to pay around 10SGD just to get inside but I don't really see this as a very special place to go as a tourist who is travelling in Singapore for only 3-4 days. I would probably enjoy this if I am staying in Singapore for months and I just want a nice day at the park.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Must visit . Located at Botanica Gdn and is good deal. Cant remember the tix price. ( Is great value )
,,Gorgeous place to visit,5.0,,The National Orchid Garden is part of the Botanical Gardens. It was beautiful to walk through the public part of the Botanical Gardens to get to the Orchid Garden. There is no fee to enter the Botanical Gardens but there is a small fee to enter the Orchid Garden. The Orchid Garden is every bit as beautiful as you would imagine and provides a wonderful tranquil experience in an otherwise very busy city. I have been to Singapore many times and I cannot explain why this is the first time I have visited the Botanical Gardens and the Orchid Garden. Don't make the same mistake. This is a must see when you are in Singapore.
,,Great value for money - something you should definitely see in Singapore,4.0,,"The attraction is regularly 5 SGD for adults, children are free and students/the elderly are 1 SGD.

The National Orchard is located in the middle of the Botanic gardens and I would highly recommend going if you are interested in seeing the different species of plants and flowers or if you just want some nice pictures of your holiday with a colourful,scenic background.

As someone who does not generally enjoy going on scenic walks, it was very interesting and provided great value for money for entertainment."
,,Incredible selection of orchids,5.0,,"This is the best orchid selection we have ever seen. The garden is immaculately kept and and a ""have to visit"" if you are an orchid lover."
,,Purely Beautifull,5.0,,"Since 1859, orchids have been closely associated with the Gardens. The products of the Gardens' orchid breeding programme, which began in 1928, deserve a place where they can be displayed in their full splendour. The very design of these orchids is, one could say, 'hand-crafted' by the Gardens' horticultural staff, dedicated to bringing out the finest in any hybrid cross.
With over 1000 species and 2000 hybrids on display, the splendour of these gorgeous blooms is absolutely a sight to behold at the National Orchid Garden."
,,For 5 dollars it's amazing,5.0,,It really is an amazing variety of orchids. I couldn't stop taking pictures because every time I went round a corner there was an even more beautiful flower. It could easily take a couple of hours to explore properly- I just did a very quick run round as it was really hot...
,,Very pretty,5.0,,Do not miss this only $5 entry and well worth every cent. So many different flowering orchards. A must see.
,,A must for orchid lovers.,4.0,,"Just one affordable ticket and you enter the realm of hundreds species of orchids in and out of the country. All displayed with a concept which leads you along the way to the highest point of the hill where you could find yourself next to an orchid named Lee Kwan Yew, the pride of the garden."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"I was determined not to miss the Botanic Gardens yet again on this, my fourth trip to Singapore. Not having much time before my flight home, I gave myself a couple of hours to take the MRT to the Botanic Gardens station, wander down to the National Orchid Garden, then continue to the Tanglin Gate and pick up bus 174 back to my hostel in Chinatown.

This plan worked, but I could easily have spent far longer in both the orchid garden and the main gardens. The mist garden was my favourite, followed by the VIP and heritage orchid areas. I found the cool house a little disappointing - one orchid, some buds, no carnivorous plants as far as I could see. Maybe they were small or it was the wrong time of year. Not expensive to enter and you can easily spend a couple of hours wandering around the blooms, so definitely worth visiting if you're coming to the Botanic Gardens."
,,A must see attraction,5.0,,Well worth the $1 (seniors) /$5 entry fee - whether you are a plant tragic or not - this is fantastic!
,,Incredibly beautiful,5.0,,"Located within the Singapore Botanic Garden, the National Orchid Garden was stupendously beautiful. It has oodles of orchids, and they are well-identified and labeled. My spouse and I could have spent even more time there if it had not been such a hot and humid day."
,,If you like gardens this is a must,5.0,,"The gardens are set in acres of natural land, although they are set out for the public you get the feel of natural landscapes that have eve olive drab over the the years, this is a must and such good value for money ant only a few pound each entrance"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The Orchid Garden is within the Botanical Gardens. It is a very peaceful and beautiful part of the gardens with a huge number of different types of orchids. It is well sign-posted with interesting information.
,,I loved this place,5.0,,Its a very nice place to go. Full of orchards of diferent places of the world. There are even a group with names of famous people. Also you have places to eat and a souvenir store.
,,Very beautiful,4.0,,This is a very beautiful place to visit very cheap at that. Visited this during our half day city tour. A great place to think and unwind. Kinda hope I went there with my mom because she loved orchids.
,,Floral eye candy,5.0,,"As a mobility challenged visitor, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the National Orchid Garden was easily accessible for my scooter and I to experience and enjoy the orchid displays."
,,Wow!,5.0,,This is an amazing collection of orchids. It made us want to rush home and not grow orchids since we could not compete. It is worth an hour or more and lots of pictures. Normally it is 5 Sin $ but we are seniors so it was only 1 Sin $. Amazing bargain.
,,Wonderful place to wander around.,5.0,,"We took the hop on hop off bus to this venue. Lovely place to wander around, take a picnic although a very nice café at the entrance. Definitely pay to go into the Orchid garden but check as some areas not open all the time. Gorgeous place but you need a good few hours or walking"
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"When it comes to chilling out in steamy Singapore, the Orchid House in the Botanic Gardens has to be near the bottom of the thermometer. And near the top of the list of places to see in Singapore.
Which is another way of saying that looking at flowers, and orchids in particular, can be cool. The walk across to the Orchid House sets the mood. Display after display of varieties that can inspire admiration from even we of the brown thumb gardening talents. Those with green thumbs will be absolutely delighted. Then you walk on elevated pathway through the double doors of the Orchid House and the coolness strikes you. Although still relatively humid, the artificial climate of the Orchid House is many degrees lower than the natural climate outside. Appreciably so. Even those men who have forgotten to provide flowers for their spouses on every wedding anniversary and birthday will want to linger.
The orchids aren't half bad either."
,,Orchid Delights,5.0,,"Never seen so many orchids in one place, coming from a cold climate like Canada our orchids can only be grown in a heated green house."
,,A must see..,5.0,,"This is set in the wonderful Botanic Gardens, and is the only area that a small charge is made - S$5 per person.
The variety of shapes, sizes and colours is astonishing - see the garden with those names after VIP visitors and then see the cool house where the varietals are brought to life.
I have been 8 or 9 times and never tire of the variety or the peacefulness of the garden."
,,take your time to view this wonderland,5.0,,"just an amazing oasis to allow your yourself time to linger within the beauty of this place, take lunch as you'll not want to rush away"
,,Beautiful experience,4.0,,Needed more time here to appreciate the beautiful gardens - could easily spend a couple of hours rather than the quick visit provided with the tour.
,,Orchids,4.0,,Would have loved to spend more time here but a localised storm put an end to our visit. Like that the orchid names are there to see.
,,National Flower for Singapore,5.0,,"The Trip had been arranged through our Travel Agents. Good Representative through Tour East Singapore/ Half a day. Taken by Coach to Gardens. Quite beautiful and a must for anyone who enjoys, art, colour, flowers and learning about local culture."
,,Always impressive.,4.0,,"A second visit to the Orchid gardens. Some say it is expensive but we were still delighted with our second visit after 8 years.

On a par with the rose gardens in Buenos Aires.. Argentina."

,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Visited here for the 2nd time & was not disappointed, there are 25,000 different species of orchids & every one is beautiful, they just seem to grow in abundance in the Singapore climate"
,,Brilliant,4.0,,"The Singapore National Orchid Garden, which is set within the magnificent Singapore Botanic Gardens is well worth a visit for anyone who appreciates natural beauty.

Entrance to the Botanic Gardens is free of charge, but it costs around 5 Singapore Dollars to enter the National Orchid Garden.

The orchids are arrayed in a beautifully designed setting with collections of orchids arranged by type, etc.

In typical Singaporean style, there is not a leaf out of place or anything that has been omitted.

Don't rush your visit, but take advantage of the numerous places to sit and admire the orchids and the peaceful views."
,,In Awe....,5.0,,The garden is a beautiful place to visit to admire the beauty and variety of orchids available. It is set in the serene environs of the Singapore Botanic Gardens and cost $S5 for entry and was well worth it.

,,Beautiful,5.0,,"SD$5 entrance fee was absolutely worth it.

My husband and I spent a few hours on a weekday afternoon here. It wasn't overly crowded but I imagine it would be on a weekend.

Beautiful flowers everywhere you look. The hybrids were gorgeous.

A beautiful place to spend an afternoon. Lots of walking in the sun so worth taking a bottle of water."
,,Singapore for Orchids,5.0,,"Of course if in Singapore you must visit the National Orchid Garden as you will never
again see such a display of stunning orchids. This massive garden is glorious to walk around to see the vivid colourful shows from such a large selection of orchids. There are rare orchids that you would never otherwise see. It really is a lovely place to get some fresh air, exercise and it provides are contemplation right in the hub of this big city. A definite for gardeners."
,,Fantastic orchids on show - every colour you can imagine,5.0,,"What an absolutely beautiful garden! There are thousands of orchids in all colours for visitors to enjoy. We have never seen so many orchids in one location before - the gardeners should be very proud of themselves.

Our visit was part of a cruise ship shore excursion, so we only had about an hour and half to enjoy the brilliant displays."

,,"Ok, nothing really special",4.0,,"The Orchid Garden is beautiful, and has a very nice variety of flowers, but it wasn't something that ""WOW'ed"" me"
,,Why?,2.0,,"I am a local Singaporean who obtained a few free passes to the National Orchid Garden. Entry is SGD$5 each for adults.

My conclusion is one of confusion. Whilst the National Orchid Garden is well curated, I am not sure it justifies paying the additional entry fee when the Botanic Gardens - a UNESCO World Heritage site has so much to offer. Yes, you get to see some orchids named after celebrities such as Paloma Picasso and Amitabh Bachan, but an Orchid is an Orchid?

That said, the garden was full of tourists who seem to enjoy it more than I did. Maybe this place is more suitable for Orchid lovers."
,,Well designed garden,4.0,,"This garden costs $5 to enter but goes towards the gardens so it's well-spent.
It has a nice and easy to navigate set up. I don't think a visit to the Botanic Gardens would be complete without coming in here and taking a look.

,,No tourist pass discount,4.0,,It's a beautiful garden but they did not accept our 'Your Singapore' cards which were supposed to give us a discount. So not cool...

,,My new favourite place,5.0,,"As an Orchid lover (they are my favourite flower), this was like Disneyland! The entry fee is 5 singapore dollars for adults or 1 dollar for students/ concessions so an absolute bargain!

I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Singapore. It was a real treat and I hope to return one day."

,,Wonderful highlight,5.0,,"Beautifully arranged flowers with many rare species and combinations that you will not be able to see anywhere else in the world.

Definitely a highlight of Singapore with many photo opportunities and a very enjoyable walk.

It can get very busy with people wanting to all take the same pictures, as such, the garden is not as relaxing as it could be and for that experience I would strongly advise going during the week or perhaps close to the opening and or closing times.

If you are lucky and patient you will also catch some wildlife!"

,,For Orchid and Photography Fans,4.0,,"National Orchid Garden is a part of Singapore Botanical Garden. This place is beautiful and it is only SGD5 for adult entrance. It opens early as well.

Inside, a lot of orchids are blooming beautifully. We got to learn differet type of orchids there. There are a lot of places for beautiful pictures as well. However, for better viewing, it is better to come during weekday morning to avoid the crowd and the heat. There is surprisingly no bugs inside. The garden itself is not that big so take your time to enjoy the view.

In the gift shop, you can buy small genetically modified orchid that will grow later on. We didn't but it so we cannot testify the result here.

Now, if you want to go here by public transport. We took MRT from Somerset to Bukit Timah station (about 1 hour). But, from the station, it is about 2.5km walking to the garden (no shuttle). If you take taxi, it is about 1km walk from nassim gate drop off point."

It's well kept, beautifully displayed, and even has a celebrity orchid garden, although you will be hard pushed to find any celebs...
My favourite was the mist garden, which was really tropical and well decorated.

For 5RM, it's worth it to wander round and explore for the afternoon!"
,,A Good Picnic Spot at Best (Not a Tourist Attraction),3.0,,"As the title says, its a good picnic spot for groups to spend 3-4 hours or for somebody who is a botany student. The only thing worth visiting was the Orchid Garden, else I would have skipped this place.

Very good for photo shoots, lots of colors, impressive displays and places to sit for taking pictures. The place can get very busy so I recommend to go early. It is a long walk from the MRT station almost 1 km and more walks inside the orchid garden. If you are not fit for 1 km walk it is best to get a taxi to the entrance at Nassim Gate. If taking the MRT and walking, walk on Cluny Rd and enter via the Lower Palm Valley Rd gate. This way is more direct if you do not mind not seeing the plants and displays in the Botanic Garden as the walking paths are very windy and will take you longer. Tip: bring a hat, face towel (unless you are used to humid condition), water bottle and snacks."

,,Get your walking shoes on,4.0,,"We both enjoyed the walk to and around the botanic gardens, my wife loves orchids more than me but I even found it very pretty especially looking at the orchids which were created for the Queen of England, William and Kate etc the only drawback it was a long walk from the Botanic gardens MRT to the entrance to the Orchid Garden and back again so if you can't walk too far maybe it is not for you"

,,The highlight of our trip,5.0,,The Orchid Garden was well worth a visit and actually a much more enjoyable experience than Gardens by the Bay which we visited also. A big part of that was because it was much quieter - we went on a Monday afternoon- so you could enjoy a leisurely stroll around and appreciate the beautiful gardens without the hordes.

,,Beautiful,5.0,,This is the place to visit. It is breathtaking and very spectacular. We visited it on a rainy day and it still was amazing.
,,A lovely place to visit for a few hours,4.0,,We had a lovely few hours walking around the National Orchid Garden. We took the MRT from our hotel to the garden. We were not aware that it is at least a mile walk from the MRT to the garden. I'm not sure about the bus but this may be closer and more convenient. The price was very reasonable for Singapore as well. Worth a visit if you have the time.
,,"Nice flowers, but small area",4.0,,"This is a garden in the center of the larger Botanical Gardens. It is a 5-10 min walk from the central visitor center, or a much longer walk from the northern MRT station.

The garden is nice, with many beautiful flowering plants arranged with care.

Overall, my only complaint is that the space of the garden is rather small - you can walk through in just a few minutes. It would be nice to expand it."
,,Colourful and amazing display,5.0,,As pensioners we only paid SD1 to enter this garden but would have paid more as it was beautiful. So many different shapes and sizes of orchids.
,,Just stunning!,5.0,,"Finally got to see this priceless garden and it was worth the wait! So many types all blooming in exotic colours and forms. I imagine all orchid fanatics would make this pilgrimage at some stage at least once ( or more) The botanical gardens itself is teeming with some gorgeous tropical plants, all look well cared for and some displayed brilliantly with the orchids. Its a credit to Singapore despite their small land size, theyve dedicated this land space for these magnificent gardens.
Had a few rain showers so go prepared with umbrellas or raincoats. Light snacks and water is good idea, theres eating places but there was a huge crowd the day we went.Good walking footwear is essential, pleasantly surprised there were no or hardly any mossies!"
,,Must visit!,5.0,,Hundreds of orchids. There are so many colors and different shapes of orchids. Really great place to visit - it smells wonderful!
,,Just breathtaking array of fabulous orchids,5.0,,"When we visit Singapore we always come to the gardens and in particular, the orchid garden. Don't visit one without the other. The hiuge collection of orchids, in every colour, takes your breath away. From the MRT exit adjacent to a park gate it's 1.3k walk through the gardens to the Orchid House entrance (payment to enter Orchid House currently is S$5 or 1dollar if over 60.) Once in pathways criss cross up a gentle slope with orchid plants planted all over. Don't miss the Mist House (masses of rare orchids), the Cool House, or the VIP orchid section. Apart from the Mist House access is wheelchair friendly.

The Botanical Gardens ope very early (06:00 hrs I think) and unless you cope with humidity and heat it's best to go early in the morning and reach the Orchid House section when it opens at 08:30hrs. We virtually had the place to ourselves for the first half hour."
,,Nice flowers,4.0,,Visited as part of an organised tour. Was very clean and impressive array of orchids. Some great sculptures too. Worth visiting.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"I am not really interested in gardens or plants but my wife is. However, we both thought that this garden, which forms part of the botanic gardens was absolutely excellent. The orchid displays are stunning and the number of different species and types of orchid completely mind boggling. The place is exceptionally well maintained and cared for by friendly staff.

We, sadly, had only about an hour here, but we could easily have spent a couple more.

You have to pay to enter the orchid garden (but not the surrounding botanic gardens) but the entrance cost is very reasonable (sorry can't remember the exact figure).

Definitely worth a visit if you are in Singapore. The excellent mass transit system stops right outside the botanic gardens."
,,This country is amazing,5.0,,Singaporeans certainly knows how to create display after display of gardens that never disappoint. Love all the work that they put into their gardens.
,,Amazing orchids,5.0,,"We took a Taxi which was cheap only use the government Taxis blue and yellow cabs as the others are private. I believe it was only £5 to get in and you saw the botanical gardens as well. There is also a large lake with terrapins in. The Flowers and foliage were awesome. At the end of the Botanical gardens you can get on the Metro which was also cheap, we went onto the Shopping centre.I did not realise how many different Orchids there were ."
,,orchid extravaganza,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens, meticulously maintained. Very hot and a 2 km walk from one end to the other. Orchids are well worth it though. Train access at one end only. Bus access at the other. MRT card works for both though."

,,Blooming fantastic,5.0,,"So glad we made the effort to find the gardens - they are located within the larger Singapore Botanic Gardens - themselves a UNESCO World Heritage rated site.

The Orchard gardens are thoughtfully presented with tags identifying plants and dedicated seating, or standing places, for visitors taking photos. The orchids are spread over several locations including a ""cold house"" and a ""mist garden"".

The flowers are beautiful and brilliantly maintained. We did not see a weed, a flower, or a leaf out of place.

The site is a credit to the gardeners.

It is a must visit for anyone interested in flowers.

Entry is a modest $1 for seniors (some form of ID required) and $5 for adults.

Taxis take you to the gardens entrance and the site is also accessible via public transport."
,,Worth the price of admission!,5.0,,"Admission to the Botanic Garden is free, but they do charge (I believe) $5 Singapore for admission to the National Orchid Garden. It is worth every penny! The day we visited, it was very quiet and peaceful. You could easily spend a couple of hours walking the grounds - maybe more if you like taking pictures. I would love to go back!"

,,A beautiful oasis in the center of Singapore,5.0,,We spent a lovely morning in the botantical gardens but the highlight was the National Orchid gardens. The variety and beauty of the plants is astounding and the layout of the gardens and care taken to keep it in good order make a visit very rewarding. There is a small charge but it is well worth it. It was fine when we were there but a sign suggests going after - I can imagine that further enhances the beauty of this place.

The further you go into the gardens, the more awe inspiring it becomes with the different displays. One you enter into a ""greenhouse"" and the colour and stunning varieties of orchids feel like you are in some sort of beautiful wonderland. The gardens were immaculately tended and thoughtfully laid out. Comfy shoes and a bottle of water are recommended, as there are a lot of paths to follow and it can be quite steamy. We stopped at the restaurant on the way out to get a drink and it looks as though it is very popular with the locals coming in for dinner."

It is organized as you would expect in one of the most organized Countries and Cities in the world.
,,Orchids in open air - where else do you have such a choice?,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden is a great site - the only disadvantage is the connection to the public transport. The Botanic Gardens can be reached by SMRT - but it is quite a distance to walk to the Orchid Garden. The next exit is not far away from a bus stop - but there are for the moment construction works. In order to really enjoy the flowers, take at least 2-3 hours just for orchids!"

,,Great even if you are not into flowers,5.0,,The Orchid Garden is a lovely retreat that is suitable for everyone with excepeptional flower displays.
,,I love these gardens.,5.0,,I have visited the gardens on two separate trips to Singapore. These are a definite must visit. There is a small nominal charge which is well worth it. These gardens are part of the Botanical Gardens. Don't be tempted to take an organised trip - use the MRT as it will be much cheaper.
,,Great experience !,4.0,,National Orchid Garden is a must visit in Singapore. Great display of orchids to see & appreciate. A fine collection of tropical & rain forest horticultural varieties.
,,Stupendous and breathtaking,5.0,,This is a not to miss sight. The amazing variety of orchids and other exotic blooms and foliage is quite unique. Plan to spend at least three hours if you like flowers and do not forget a camera. As an over 60 the entry fee was only a dollar but even you young ones will not pay much more! A real bargain
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden is inside the Botanical Gardens. It has a modest entry fee and is well worth every cent paid! There is a good discount for seniors.

The floral displays are absolutely spectacular. An eye-opener for anyone who wants to discover this amazing group of plants. The garden is very well laid out, with paths that meander through beautiful displays. The staff are helpful and polite.

The only down side is the obscenely expensive shop at the exit, a veritable tourist trap. Just walk right through it."
,,Stop and smell these flowers,4.0,,"If you like a lush setting with the an amazing array of very colorful flowers, be sure to visit the Singapore National Orchid Garden.

,,lovely,5.0,,a must see in singapore go early a long walk from mtr station but nice walk in the park many orchid variety
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This is a garden you pay to visit within the free Botanical Gardens. It is well worth the small entrance fee. It's an excellent place to escape the city and relax. If you aren't that keen on paying to see this garden I would suggest it's still worth the price to see all the colours of the orchids and you can take nicer photos in there than in rest of the gardens. The garden is very well kept and clean as you would expect. It was pretty quiet in terms of visitors when I was there so it felt peaceful (I went on a weekday afternoon on a sunny day). I would recommend it as a relaxed activity. There is a gift shop there and in the main gardens too, with high end prices and some cheaper items too. Stock looked quite nice to give as presents. Also the cafes in the main gardens are about average prices for Singapore/tourist places. I had a laksa curry in one place near the entrance purely chosen because cheapest dish and later I had a brownie and lattr elsewhere in Bee's Knees cafe. Both options were very very tasty so unless you are on a strict budget I would suggest eating there too as part of your visit. Otherwise main gardens would be good for a picnic eg if you are a backpacker. They have water fountains near toilets too and also vending machines for drinks."
,,Nice.,4.0,,"A very large collection of orchids, very pretty. I think if you are a big flower lover this would be a must see. Located inside the botanical gardens with a SPD 5 entrance fee. If you are going around the botanical gardens it is worth going in."

The walkways, waters, halls, ...they made are one with nature and it feels so peaceful there. Big surprise to find this in the centre of a crowded city."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"We went to the botanical gardens on the yellow line of the hop on hop off bus. The park itself is fabulous with tropical trees and plants. This is a unesco heritage site and rightly so. The gardens are perfectly kept and if you're lucky, you'll see large wild lizards. The jewel in the crown of the gardens is the orchid garden which has a huge number of different orchids growing outside in lovely settings. There is a charge for the orchids but 60+ only pay $1. Definitely worth a visit."

,,Stunning!,5.0,,"Whilst visiting the Botanical Gardens last Sunday, we could not miss the opportunity to visit the National Orchid Garden.

,,SPECTACULAR,5.0,,"This display is right in the middle of the Botanic Gardens. So it is 1.3km, nearly a mile, through the park to the nearest public transport. It is quite amazing. A place where several hours would just slip away. Breathtaking. Fee applies."

There are more than 25000 accepted species and the garden is home to a few thousand species and hybrids of orchids.

Nested within the Singapore Botanical Gardens (1 of 3 gardens to be bestowed the UNESCO World HeritageSite), the National Orchid Garden is opened daily from 8.30am to 7.00pm. Take a leisurely walk and feast your eyes on the varieties on display. Visit the gift shop and bring home the flowers in unique gift offerings.

,,Jsharp,3.0,,"It cost $20.00 to ride the elevator up, then you can use the ticket for drinks or food, good luck fin find something for $20.00 up there. Then you find out you are restricted to little places, not close to the side or rails, the two bars is all you can get to, yes you have a view looking out, but to me it was a place if I had known I would not have spent the time or,money,going to , take the Farris wheel across the lake , a better bang for,your dollar and great views as well"

So many varieties and colors, different sizes... all are so carefully and expertly tended to. This is a very special part of the entire Botanic Gardens in Singapore. Best time to come here is in the morning. Then again early evenings.

There's a very lovely restaurant in the vicinity and I personally attended a gorgeous wedding dinner at the restaurant. Fine dining in a colonial ""black and white"" bungalow. What more can you ask for? Surrounded by glorious beautiful orchids in the ground floor as we all dined upstairs.

Definitely one of the best stops in Singapore if you love flora and fauna."
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,"Been here a few times, worth it if you are already at Botanic Gardens. There are gorgeous orchids you just don't see elsewhere."
,,beautiful,5.0,,"The wife and I caught the MRT to the botanic gardens, the orchid gardens is approximately 2 kmS walk from station. Beautiful gardens on the way and beautiful display of orchids.

,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"I have never seen so many beautiful Orchids in one place. I didn't think I would be so impressed but I loved it. The plants are just neverending. The entry fee is worth it, you get to see so many different shapes, colors, and sizes of orchids flowers.
Make sure you wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of walking. Have plenty of water if you need to refill there is a water fountain next to the gift shop. If you are hungry there is a small shop selling snacks and drinks a few ft away from the Orchid Garden entry gate. Just next to it there is a place to sit and enjoy the view while you relax and eat."
,,Great Outdoor Collection of Orchids,5.0,,"Singapore's collection of orchids is outstanding. The Orchid Garden is contained within a section of the Botanical Garden and can be accessed by the MRT (Metro Rapid Transit). It's a bit of a walk from the MRT station to the Orchid Garden however be prepared to walk through various sections of the Botanical Garden which are quite beautiful & enjoyable. The Botanical Gardens are free but there's a nominal (reasonable) entrance fee for the Botanical Gardens. There are a wide & diversified selection and species of orchids grown in a natural environment. Some of the orchid gardens I've visited have orchids grown in pots & placed in a garden setting. This is not the case here, the orchids are grown in flower beds and beautifully arranged. It's a wonderful place to visit for orchid lovers and photographers! I definitely recommend a trip out to the Botanical Gardens where you can visit the Orchid section."
,,An amazing garden with extensive paths and flowers,5.0,,Highly recommended for the small entrance fee from the gift shop. Don't miss it. You can take pictures of orchids until your memory card is full.

As we had only couple of hours to spare before our flight back home we decided to do only orchid garden tour. The collection they have is mind-boggling. All possible colours in large quantities......great for photo sessions. A leisurely stroll through the garden will take about half a day. Truly memorable visit.
,,After 2 visits and not a keen gardener we will go again,5.0,,You do not have to be a fanatical orchid grower the variety of colours and their beautiful surroundings is well worth the experience. We have visited the gardens twice in 2 years and will go again.
,,nice place,4.0,,It is a beautiful place. Price was great only 1 dollar for student. This garden is worth of visiting.
,,Orchid Heaven,5.0,,"This is probably the most amazing orchid garden I have ever seen. Despite being there in January there were many orchids still in bloom and the way in which the whole garden is designed leads you from one amazing vision to another. The history of these gardens is also fascinating - particularly how the Singaporean people helped save the gardens following the exit of the Japanese troops in WW2.
The skills of the garden staff is terrific and leaves me in awe. A must see experience if you are visiting Singapore. A word of warning however is always take a bottle of clean water with you as there are not too many places to have a drink and with the walking and the heat you will need fluid."

Also, Burkill Hall was beautiful to walk around. Love the architecture."

,,Beautiful,5.0,,Just amazing and you get to see all the orchids that are made and named after celebrities and politicians.
,,The highlight of the Botanic Gardens,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are a beautiful place to pass an afternoon. Covering a large area the National Orchid Garden houses a vast array of all types of orchid, including a cool house and a mist house. This was our second visit and we felt that some of the orchid displays were not as spectacular as they had been during our first visit which was in July. However it still is a fantastic collection which is still worthwhile visiting at any time of the year.
Over 60s entrance only costs 1SGD. The Botanic Gardens are easily reached by by MRT which takes you to the main gate."

,,Visit If and only if you are Related to science!,4.0,,"We visited this destination,at the mid-part of our trip.I found it bit larger than expected and there was some repetition in the Garden-As I think.But one can visit it if he interested botany or biology.There are also some discounted rate for students if ID Card is produced!"

,,Surprised & Delighted,5.0,,"To be honest, visiting a flower garden wasn't very high on my list of ""fun things to do in Singapore"". And my floral expertise is pretty limited to being able to distinguish a rose from a dandelion. Therefore, I was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed the morning at the National Orchid Garden.

The array of different orchids is stunning. Who knew there were so many types! Beyond the beauty there are many interesting stories surrounding the unique flowers dedicated to honorable people. Singapore's love for orchids is much more appreciated, and admired, after spending a lovely time at the Garden.

Highly recommended."

The flowers are stunning and the whole place manicured. Make sure you bring your camera ! I recommend wearing proper shoes and not flip flops for walking around as there are a few hilly bits. Also once inside there is no where to buy a drink so bring one with you. This costs around $12 to enter but is very much worth it.

,,Sensational displays,5.0,,Let me be honest I am no particular lover of Orchids but even I can see the attraction of this place.

,,"Bring your hat, water bottle and camera!",5.0,,"This beautiful garden is worth a visit when you're at the Botanic Gardens. You do have to pay a modest fee to get in but then again, it's a particularly pretty part of the park. Depending on the timing that you're there, the number of blooms can fluctuate, but there will always be plenty of wonderful flowers to enjoy. If you're not used to Singapore's hot, humid weather, I recommend dressing in light clothing and taking along a hat and plenty of water. Also make sure you have a camera / phone to capture you and your loved ones with the gorgeous backdrop!"
,,Garden in the Dark,4.0,,"The best time to visit this lovely park is 5 a.m. Seriously. Qigong and other esoteric practitioners will take advantage of the cool air amidst the dew-dropped foliage to exercise and soak up the sun and earth's energies as the sun rises. The super rich whose bungalows encircle this garden will take advantage of the darkness (and safety, this being Singapore after all) to jog and walk about in anonymity. To them this is like their own backyard garden minus the maintenance cost. That could be the reason why properties around the Botanic Garden are the most expensive here and globally. So come during dawn or daybreak. Singaporeans live like vampires and fear the sun."

,,Amazing display of orchids,5.0,,"Located in Botanical Gardens at the entrance fee of only £3. For what it is I would pay much more to see it.
I never seen so many orchids in my life, looking very healthy and presented so well. Great opportunity to take some lovely pictures of orchids and tropical gardens.

,,Must See,5.0,,This has to be No 1 thing you must see in SG. The flowers are absolutely stunning. The variety of orchids is incredible. Well worth the time
,,Superb,5.0,,"Very well maintained, and a botanist's paradise. It rekindles the ancient debate about whether the orchid or the rose is the most diverse and beautiful flower in nature. (I remain undecided). The garden features a comprehensive and diverse collection of orchids, and is an easy 1-hour walking tour. Senior citizen discounts. Go early morning, as it gets hot and muggy fast."
,,One of the Most Beautiful Places on Earth,5.0,,"I wasn't especially excited about going here at first, but after arriving, I was very happy that we went. These gardens are immaculate! They the most varieties of orchids I have ever seen and they even arrange the plants where they look like they are in bouquets. Every inch of this park is beautiful."

,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"I visited the gardens as part of a city tour.

,,Just beautiful,5.0,,"The national orchid garden is within the Singapore Botanical garden and costs just 5S$ to get in. The variety and colours on display are just beautiful.

Well worth a visit I would recommend putting aside a couple of hours to visit the botanical and Orchard gardens. One of our best days in Siingapore."
,,"Lovely venue, would have liked longer",5.0,,"Visited the park as part of a free tour, organised through ASIA, giving an overview of the city. Without transport, it would be difficult to get too, but if mobile, one could spend a full day exploring the Orchid Gardens and the surrounding area.

,,A must for orchid lovers and for anyone else,5.0,,"I love orchids and this visit was a must for me but even my husband who does not share my passion, enjoyed the visit. The displays are magnificent and so colorful, I ended taking so many photographs. Even on a hot day the garden remains cool and a pleasure to wander about. If you can make a special visit and do not be tempted to visit it on the same day as the Botanical Gardens as it would be too tiring. The entrance fee is so reasonable that I shall be tempted to return when I stay in Singapore again, perhaps at a different season."

,,Neat display,5.0,,"I visited with my daughter.

This is one of the most impressive displays of orchids outside I have ever seen. While they are in planters, they are most notable for how well they are displayed. They have every type of orchid I've ever seen - and neat displays. It's a nice walk and visit. Children are free and only $5 for adults. What a bargain for a good 90 minutes. Bring your camera.

The orchids were abundant throughout the garden and were a delight. The maintenance staff deserve a big pat on the back for their efforts in steamy weather conditions. A real treasure.
,,"It depends, doesn't it?",3.0,,If you love orchids....maybe this is a must. If you're a person who feels they all look a bit plastic( SHOCK! HORROR!) then the gardens are full of much nicer things. The cool room is lovely in that area!

,,Stunning orchid displays in this beautiful location,5.0,,We loved the orchids and couldn't get enough of the wonderful displays. Although it was very hot on humid it didn't deter us from having a great time wandering between the various displays.
,,Photographers Delight,4.0,,"A beautiful place to stroll and really look at all the various varieties of orchids. Perfect locale for photographers and although a bit hilly, wheelchair and pushchair friendly. Shaded areas to rest in but definitely bring a bottle of water; the humidity is always 'up there' in Singapore. Nice gift shop at the exit with some tasteful (and some not so tasteful) souvenirs."
,,Beautiful garden with hundreds of orchids,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden, which is in the Singapore Botanical Garden, is well worth a visit even if orchids are not your favorite flower. There are orchids of every size and color. One orchid even smelled like chocolate! The huge variety is almost overwhelming. Wide pathways allow for easy access and strategically located gazebos provide shelter if you get caught in a sudden downpour (as we did). Take your camera and plan for at least an hour or two."
,,blooming flowers everywhere,5.0,,"This is a fantastic creation within the area od Singapore. Orchids, orchids everywhere. Different flowers every foot of every trail. Easy layout for walking but take your time. The varieties are fascinating for the non orchid lover. Time is necessary for enjoyment. We went by subway which requires a little planning. Bring a bottle of water since it will be warm."

There are open tops ""Hop On & Hop Off"" shuttle bus that brings visitors right at its doorstep at a reasonable fare. Between S$20 - S$25 per person.

,,. Be,4.0,,"As part of trip (halfway our Asian cruise) we visited this garden. We arrived early in the morning on a beautiful sunny day (it had been raining a lot in the previous days). And because it was early in the morning, we had plenty of space to walk around. When we returned to our coach we noticed that a lot of buses were arriving at the entrance.
There are two ways one can visit this garden, a short easy walk and a longer walk, which is a bit “hilly”. The garden has a beautiful layout and a large varity off orchids. There is also a giftshop."

,,Lovely Orchids!,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens committee was kind enough to have free-entries for everyone for a month. Too bad we missed it, but students get to enter for only a dollar. I personally feel that the inside the Orchid Garden was more exciting and dense compared to whats outside. There were many designated photo spots and pavilions for viewing. I enjoyed the ""Cool House"" exhibit the most. Unfortunately, the area itself is pretty small. We only spent about an hour inside."
,,Added beauty to botanic gardens.,5.0,,Orchid garden attached to botanic gardens is very lovely and makes you aware of all kind of natural as well as hybrid orchids. Well maintained and nice place for those flicks you will adore.

,,One Of The Best Walks In Singapore,5.0,,I go to gardens all over the World and I just love this orchid garden in fact I always stop in the gift shop and buy books to take back to friends as gifts. I spend at least a couple of hours every trip to Singapore in this precious spot. Be sure to bring a bottle of water or stop along the way and stay hydrated it is alway so hot but it will be worth any sacrifice to walk among these incredible plants. Besides the Bird Park and The Zoo this is in the Top Five Must Do's for a trip here to Singapore. Walking in this heat sounds absurd but I assure you this place is worth the sacrifice.
,,Orchid lover's paradise.,5.0,,"Situated inside the Singapore Botanic Gardens, this is a must if you're an orchid fan. Be prepared for a long walk as the gardens are situated 1.9km from the SMRT entrance."

,,Absolutely blown away,5.0,,$5 SGD? Are you kidding me? I was absolutely blown away by this place. It is the most beautiful and fantastically cared for piece of the Singapore Botanical Gardens. Heavenly sights at every turn. There really are no superlatives big enough to describe this place. Speechless at the beauty of all the different areas from Burkill Hall to the arches and Cool house. Really annoying thing? Groups of Chinese and Japanese tourists not here to look at Orchids but to carry around full make up bags and pout and pose for selfies. Pathetic. But don't let this put you off. I just did my best to avoid.
,,Best personification of Singapore,5.0,,Very short visit. mostly an hour or two while visiting the Botanic garden. This is rally the place to visit the 1001 flowers and plants. Very very ver unique.
,,Beautiful Orchids in Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"A pleasant and attractive few hours can be spent viewing the selection of orchids, some which are unique and very colourful. Good for adults and children with plenty of exercise on well planned paths. Can be busy and hot"

,,Must see when in Singapore,5.0,,This garden was my favorite sight in Singapore. It showcases the largest hybrid orchid collection that is not available to visit elsewhere in the world to my knowledge. Highly recommended!
,,Princess Cruise Shore Excursion,5.0,,This place is absolutely beautiful. It puts my hometown botanical garden to shame. I really like the way they have cross bred some of the orchids and if you are a celebrity or hold a really high political office you can get one of the cross bred orchids named after you. I don't know the price of the individual ticket because we bought it as a shore excursion. The really cool part was the mist house. It is worth to take your time out and see this part of Singapore.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit. Gorgeous pathways wind through tropical plants with, of course, orchids as the stars. I had no idea there were so very many."
,,Stunning display of Orchids,5.0,,"If you love orchids then this will be your paradise. Actually even if you don't it's still worth a visit. The NOG is within the Botanical Gardens which are worth a visit in their own rite. The NOG has a small entry free for adults but worth the few dollars. Such an extensive range of flowers and a lovely walk around the garden will keep you enthralled for an hour or so. There are a number of lovely spots where you can stop and sit for a while, which you will want to do if it's a hot steamy day. You also get to go through a green house which will provide cool relief while you look at some carnivorous pitcher plants. All in all a great outing."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Such a beautiful place and for only $5 for an Adult (free for students), well worth the money. You can tell the gardens are taken care of and are well looked after. A lot of walking ( easy walking) but be sure to take some water. There is a disabled route inside the gardens which is great to see to."
,,A delightful haven,4.0,,"Singapore is hot and steamy so a walk through the orchid gardens, delightful experience that it is is best attempted by the elderly in early morning. The beauty and variety of the blooms on display is simply stunning, though the area is hilly and takes a bit of negotiating. Don't forget to take cold water along.
These beautiful, extensive gardens represent a delightful respite from the bustle of this cosmopolitan city state."
,,Must Visit,5.0,,If enjoy plants or beautiful flowers then you must visit this place. The numerous varieties of Orchids will take your breath away. The arrangements and information relating to each plant is really good. There is an entrance charge but its well worth the money.

,,Beautiful Flowers But I Preferred The Whole Singapore,4.0,,I went to Singapore on business in June 2016 for a week and stayed an extra week as a vacation so my wife and two children could come and enjoy Singapore. I went twice to the Singapore Botanical Gardens by myself as my wife and children were not interested. The National Orchid Garden is part of the Botanical Gardens. The orchids were certainly beautiful and you can pass by here as part of your walk. But I think I preferred walking the entire Singapore Botanical Gardens for a couple of hours which was the primary reason I came here. One thing to note is that Singapore is very hot and humid so you should take periodic rests or go in the shade and also drink plenty of water.
,,One of the reasons to come to botanic gardens,5.0,,This place show the beauty of orchids in full colour spectrum. The atmosphere is relaxed. Better come to have slow walk here.

,,Very nice way to spend a couple of hours,5.0,,Tremendous collection of orchids. Its all outside (with the exception of the cool house) so it makes for a very pleasant walk if the weather isn't too warm. If you're an orchid lover you can spend all day here.

The areas of planting are quite extensive and the variety of colour and planting combinations is impressive. There is also a small Bromelliad house, and a cool house within the gardens. This is an incredibly well maintained section of the botanic garden, with new plantings being undertaken all the time and new designs introduced. There is one section that has hybrid orchids, each named after someone famous. Look out for Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair!"

,,beautiful,5.0,,"This is in a corner of Botanic Garden and it's paid access so it was a little quiet when I visited. I was completely amazed by the collection; set in a beautifully manicured garden, and for me at least I thought it was well worth the price of admission. Plan on an hour + visit"
,,Like Wonderland,5.0,,Did you ever get the feeling that you walked into a Disney cartoon where all the flowers were fairies? This is the place. Impressive gardens and the high point was the Cool House with budding bananas. Was offered free entry as a student and was very impressed by the gift shop. If only there was room in the bags!!!
,,Absolutely breathtaking,5.0,,"What an amazing retreat in the Botanic Gardens .

The Orchid garden is so big that it would be easy to think that it is a garden in itself and you forget you are actually within the Botanic Gardens.

Orchids are my favorite flower, so seeing all the different types in various shapes, colors, and patterns all in one place is just fabulous. Plus, the garden has designated “photo spots” for you to take the best pictures with the most beautiful backgrounds. It took us maybe 1-2 hours to walk through the Orchid Garden alone. Quite spacious and beautifully laid out.

Word of advice: Make sure to bring an umbrella just in case. We were there at the end of monsoon season in November and we were caught in a torrential downpour! If it weren’t for our umbrellas, we would’ve soaked through.

Must visit if you’re in Singapore!"

,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"Surely the National Orchid Garden, found within the Singapore Botanic Garnes,is the jewel in the Crown. If you've only a short time available then head straight for the Orchids...opening times are different from the garden times so check first. It's the only part of the Botanic Gardens where there is an admission charge but it's not excessive - SGD 5 with concessions at one dollar. It boasts the largest display of orchids in the world with over 1000 species and 2000 hybrids. Believe me it is mind blowing in its beauty and the orchids are brilliantly displayed.
There's the VIP Orchid Garden and a celebrity orchid garden for starters. In the Tan Hoon Siang Mist House are newer orchids along with other tropical plants such as pitcher plants. Wander into the Yuen-Peng McNeice bromeliad collection for yet more exotica and don't forget the cool house which contains plants from high elevation tropical sites.
Everywhere you go there are orchids some of which are quite highly scented and make sure your camera/mobile phone battery is fully charged!
On exiting the orchid garden there is a well stocked gift shop if your looking for souvenirs of your visit.

There are rare varieties here along with varieties that are named after celebrities. There is a cool house with ac that is nice to escape the heat and humidity in and it has carniverous plants. The main botanical garden is free to the public, however, you need to pay admission to the orchid garden. We were allowed 30 minutes inside, so I felt a bit rushed.

Don't forget your passport if you want to claim the senior discount rate into the Orchid Garden The gardens are extensive and one corner houses the Orchid Garden. Seeing so many different orchids in one place must be unique. The open garden area is just packed with them and then there are a couple of special areas for those requiring a slightly different climate. The cool of the mountain house can be welcome!

Choose the correct entrance to botanical garden as some entrances are far away from the orchid garden."
,,An absolute MUST,5.0,,"$5 to see the orchids and the rest of the botanical gardens are free. Worth ever cent or penny!! Truly beautiful, beautiful flowers so many colours and shapes - largest collection in the world I believe. As for the gardens they are laid out beautifully- a real pleasure to walk around.

Although the Botanic Gardens were established in 1859, the Orchid Gardens are less than 20 years old.

Don’t let this stop you visiting though, as there is are hundreds of species and hybrids of orchids on exhibition.

It was interesting to see who had visited the gardens and some celebs even had orchids named after them. Very well kept, although we found route finding a buit difficult - managed to double back and made sure we saw everything in the end. The rest of the Botanical Gardens were also well kept with unusual flowers and trees - Singapore was very humid when we visited so walking to see everything in one day would have been difficult. We ate in the restaurant - it was very nice, as was the gift shop.
l"
,,"Live, in a natural hothouse",5.0,,"Well designed gardens with the greatest variety of orchards I've ever seen; one more lovely than the next. Of course the climate was 85 degrees with 80-90 percent humidity, and if your clothes are not soaked by the time you are finished, you didn't do it right. The gift shop at the end of the rainbow, even though the prices are in Singapore dollars is WAY overpriced, but no one forces you to buy. Enjoy."

However, the National Orchid Gardens holds a wide collection of magnificent orchids of different colors. Very peaceful and quite place to visit.

,,"Beautiful arrangements of orchids, perfect for flower enthusiasts.",4.0,,"I went to the Botanic Garden before but the National Orchid Garden was already closed in the late afternoon, so I had to come back again. For students, the entrance fee is only 1SGD and for regular adults it's 5SGD, I would say it's still worth the 5SGD.
The National Orchid Garden is perfect for flower or orchid enthusiasts, there are a lot of different colored orchids displayes. Special walks dedicated to orchid hybrids named after celebrities or other respectable people offer a view to beautiful flowers.
A visit to the Botanic Garden should definitely be complemented by a visit to the National Orchid Garden!"

We were frequently asked if we wanted our photos taken and joined in helping others capture the whole moment whether travelling solo or in a large family group. With mobility issues my wife was using a walker and we were pleased to find wheelchair signs painted on pathways indicating the gentle route free from steps. It rained several times during our visit and we had no problems keeping dry in one of the many gazebos or covered archways located along the pathways.

While I am not an expert on orchids (or plants in general, for that matter), I was still astonished at the variety and profusion of colors in this garden. The cool house was a welcome respite from the heat and humidity that make orchids grow so well in the outdoors here and the garden was not so big that you could't see the whole thing in an afternoon. While not normally a fan of exiting through the gist shop I did look at the wide variety of young orchids for sale and determined that when I could I would build a greenhouse and order some online."

,,Outstanding,5.0,,Orchids are the national flower of Singapore and you can see them all blooming here in their natural habitat.
,,Amazing variety of flowers,5.0,,"Based in the Botanical gardens, this is very popular and gets a lot of day trippers on bus tours. Get here early, $5 entry and avoid the crowds. There are so many varieties and it leaves you speechless as to how they can get them to flower so beautifully. It is hard being out in the sun and it is quite a way out from the bay area but if you have time then it is worth a visit."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"This must be the best experience in Singapore for the money. S$20.00 will let you into a paradise of some 3000 different types of Orchids. There are orchids by rivers, orchids in garden settings, orchids in specially prepared green houses.

,,"Ok, but not outstanding",3.0,,"I have seen several orchid exhibits, and expected that Singapore's would wow me. Unfortunately, the display is large, but primarily repeats displays of a few orchids over and over again. There was a rather limited selection of varieties to view, and the overrun of large tour groups made it unpleasant. It's better to stick to the free areas of the gardens, where there is more space to move about."
,,Nice but not for a hot day,4.0,,"Quite a spectacular place to those who love the nature and love to see different and special gardens, we visited on a hot day which ruined the experience a bit"
,,Orchid garden,5.0,,"This wonderful garden is part of the botanical garden. Amazingly beautiful. Well worth the trip out there, orchids that memorialize various motanled are interesting but the orchids themselves and the way they are displayed are incredible."
,,Nothing to compare !!!,5.0,,I have been to a few Orchid Gardens but this is as good as it gets. It is conveniently in the Botanical Garden and a marvelous addition. A must see and only $1 or $2 if not free depending on age and transportation card purchased in the transit system. Typical Singapore style where nothing is out of place. I cannot find a fault except the country is usually so hot and humid and you cannot blame the government for that. One perfect day in the park.
,,Excellent place to visit for nature lovers,5.0,,National Orchid Garden is Inside Singapore botanic gardens with nominal entry fees of S$ 5 PAX which is very reasonable in comparison to other tourist attractions in Singapore. This garden is very well maintained and has amazing varieties of orchids. If you are nature lover you will love this place.

You can buy in the store the orchids in a little tube to grow them at home."
,,Wow! A must visit destination in Singapore,5.0,,We were blown away by the garden in general then we came to the Orchid Garden. It was fantastic! My partner is disabled and immediately we were offered a wheel chair at no cost so that he could enjoy his time as well.

Sugg: I found it difficult to navigate through the park without proper sign boards ."
,,Walk amongst the flowers,5.0,,"Took a quick evening visit to the orchid gardens as we were running out of time on our honeymoon and everyone has said it was worth a visit.

Loved every second of wondering around these beautiful, well maintained gardens.

It's worth also seeing the custom created hybrids made for different famous and influential people.

Would visit again 100%"

,,An afternoon visit,5.0,,Beautiful flowers. I wish I could grow orchids like this in the UK!! So many varieties in lovely settings. A must if you are visiting Singapore and like plants!
,,Mindblowing,5.0,,World of Orchids :). One of the finest place. truly amazing. You will feel so relaxed once you enter this place.. With over 1k species I feel this place would be world's largest orchid display. With beautiful flowers everywhere I literally fell in love with this place and I am sure other visitors would had the same experience. Its within Singapore Botanic Gardens and fee is S$5 adult.
,,Delightful saunter through the orchids,5.0,,"Nestling within the equally impressive Botanic Gardens, the National Orchid Garden is well worth the very reasonable five dollar entry fee. Beautifully laid out paths meander through gardens, and although it's on a hill, there is a well-marked wheelchair accessible route as well. There are a few extra special sections - entertain yourself by seeing whose special orchids make it into the celebrity gardens (""David Cameron"" was not in bloom, and looks like it's on the way out. ""Margaret Thatcher"" still rampant.) In Singapore's intense heat, a walk through the Cool House is worth it for the temperature alone! The display of new varieties of orchid is especially stunning."
,,Princess Diana Orchid,5.0,,"I wanted to visit this place to catch a view of the orchid, named after the death of Princess Diana. It's a stunning place, with a wide variety of different displays.

It's a nice leisurely walk through the gardens and appears popular with tourists and locals alike. Tai Chi lessons take place in the gardens, probably due to the peacefulness they offer"
,,Really beautiful flowers,5.0,,"Well worth seeking out and paying the small entrance fee for.

Lovely variety of orchids, and a place to relax.

The gift shop sells a variety of orchid jewelry, including real orchids dipped in gold or with a lacquer finish, Not all are real though, so check with staff if you want the real thing."
,,Beautiful Orchids,5.0,,We highly recommend a visit in Orchid Garden. A large variety of different colurfull Orchids and variants not seen before
,,Worth every cent of the S$5,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens is free entry but the Orchid Garden section is S$5 per person 13 years and over. Is it worth it? YES !! Flowers everywhere. Such fantastic & amazing blooms.

There are several marked photo spots along the paths that are specifically made so you can get a photo with lots of orchids around you. They can be popular so you may have a short queue.

If you adore the shape and colour if the flowers themselves then make sure you take a camera.

The Mist Garden is truly anazing, and was the standout 'must do"" of the gardens.

The Cool Room is a refreshing break from the heat, and has orchids to see too, but you will have to leave eventually.

Wow!!! Just do it.

If walking long distances is an issue, Burkill Gate is the closest access. There are no public buses or taxis waiting here to return though so you need to ring or book one, or hope another person happens to get dropped off there.

Allow minimum 30 minutes if you do it quickly."
,,Take your camera,5.0,,The best part of the gardens. Never seen such colours and variety. Very educational on the breeding program and shows how orchards can be grown snd displayed in a natural setting. Very artistic clustering of various types and colours.
,,Leisure walk,5.0,,"Went there by myself on a weekday afternoon, you should expect quote a lot of aunties / uncles tour since its a slow-pace activity no matter which day you go. Very relaxed and get to see different varieties of orchid. Definitely worth going if Botanic Gardens is on your agenda."

,,Beautiful,5.0,,A must see! Very easy to get to the Botanical Gardens. We did the Hop on- Hop off Bus. There are so many orchids on display
,,So glad I took this tour,5.0,,"On a recommendation I made my way to the Nationla Orchid Garden.

For what seemed a relatively small entry fee of $5 I was ushered into this 3 hectares of beautiful garden. The whole experience was amazing with beautiful flowers at every turn in a variety of colors and sizes.

It's hard to do justice to the experience but for someone not overly into 'Gardens' I was thrilled to have gone. There are many sites in the garden which appear made to be the dream photo opportunity for a wedding snap.

And then the mist garden and the cold house are added to,the experience. The mist garden brings together a variety of orchids in a small space - it's a bit like a fireworks of flowers.

Do not miss the National Orchid Garden. It is beautiful, every detail has been attended to meticulously and you will be impressed."
,,Orchids at its best,5.0,,Mind blowing display of flowers and orchids.a delight for the eyes tired of seeing skyscrapers and malls.

,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Great experience in Botanic Garden in Singapore. Loads varieties of Orchids, well equipped gift shop as well."
,,Nice day out.,5.0,,Hot and sticky but well worth the effort. Easy to catch a taxi to and from the hotel. Signs a bit misleading especially the exit signs.
,,Gardener's heaven,5.0,,"If you're a gardener, and especially if you like orchids, this place is amazing. I thought the orchids in Changi Airport were superb but this place is unbelievable. The collection is enormous and well labeled, for those who might want to hunt up a variety back home. Set in the botanical gardens, it's an easy metro or taxi trip and well worth it. If you want to get away from shopping, this is the place. It's quiet, in a beautiful setting and you can appreciate the flowers at your own pace in tgecSingapore heat and humidity."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Very nice, it is little far from the main enterence , the place is air conditioned so it's comfortable very pretty lot of different color of orchid good place to take the pictures, it is inside the botanical garden"

Prefer to go in the morning or early afternoon. Avoid late afternoon, unless one has prepared mosquito repellent."
,,A jewel within beautiful gardens,5.0,,We wanted to visit the Orchid Garden and first spent an hour walking in the beautiful Botanical Gardens. The Botanical Gardens are great but the National Orchid Garden is the jewel in the crown. So many beautiful Orchids!
,,Our Asian Adventure,5.0,,Well worth a visit. The view from the walkway is great. The place is air conditioned so you can visit anytime of the year and is also enclosed.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,It's a beautiful garden ! If you like Orchides you will love it. The unique problem is gat it's quite a long walk from the Botanic Garden MRT.
,,Loved it,5.0,,"We went to this park and really enjoyed ourselves. The Orchid garden had a small fee to get into but the rest of the park was free and we wondered around it for hours. If I lived in Singapore I would be in this park all the time. The variety of orchids was overwhelming, they were so beautiful and I took way to many photo's. The park had plenty of restrooms and water fountains as well as a shop and refreshment stand."
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,Lived in Singapore for many years before visiting for the first time. It was well worth the effort. The orchids were beautiful and we spent about 90 minutes visiting before taking a walk in the botanical gardens adjacent.
,,National Orchid Garden,5.0,,"A absolute must do, have been twice with my Thai lady partner, we both love it ,

,,Brilliant - and I don't even like flowers,5.0,,"Not being funny, but after visiting the Orchid Garden I told my girlfriend I was going to take up a new hobby - flower photography. She's still laughing 3 days later, but I'm serious - the fancy features on my S7 can't do justice to the beautiful blooms.

The Orchid Garden is the bees knees (sorry) when it comes to natural beauty. It's an easy stroll around the paths, fantastic flowers wherever you look and they've even got one called Margaret Thatcher. Which is obviously a plus or a minus depending on your point of view.

Oh and it only costs $5 to get in. The best $5 you'll spend in Singapore."
,,Stunning and worth the $5 entry fee,5.0,,"This place is magical and even if you aren't an avid plant lover I don't think you could not enjoy the composition of this garden. The flowers are amazing, and there is just something so peaceful about this place. There are plenty of photo ops along the way, guides too and I notices plenty of wheelchair and pram friendly paths. Take the time, slack it up and make sure you have battery life in your camera, as you will need it. Good walking shoes will help your tired legs, getting to the garden is a bit of a walk from the MRT station (1.2km) but it is a beautiful walk and worth every step."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Lovely orchid garden with vibrant colors. It was amazing to see how they cross breed different colors. If you like nature and greenery, you will love it. The walk through the garden was lovely as you see all different colors of orchids. Thoroughly enjoyed it."

,,Stunning orchid gardens,5.0,,"If you are visiting the Botanic gardens in Singapore, make sure you pay the extra for the orchid garden. It's an absolute highlight of visiting the gardens. The orchid gardens are actually quite large and spread out over many terraces. You could easily spend a fair amount of time just wandering.about. The orchids on display are just stunning and there are lots of photo opportunities."
,,Glorious Colour,5.0,,"We really enjoyed our wander through the Orchid Garden. It was very beautiful and exceptionally well looked after. Although it wasn't the best time of year for orchid displays, there was still plenty to look at and enjoy. Allow plenty of time to visit, as it takes a while to walk to the Orchid Garden area, and there is plenty to enjoy along the way."
,,A wounder of flowers,4.0,,"Even if you are not interested in botanics, a visit to the botanic garden is very well spent time. It is an experiance of Beauty in many ways. If you have the time. Go there."

,,Orchid Garden- a paradise,5.0,,We had a 20 mins walk from the botanical gardens MRT station to the orchid garden and were tired by the time we reached there. But what we saw inside was total bliss. It is an unbelievable place to say in short.I am sure very few places on earth can match this place.
,,colourful park enclosure,4.0,,"This is the ticketed enclosure part of the Singapore Botanic Garden,(UNESCO Heritage Park) Adults tickets at S$5 each.
I love this enclosure, because I love Orchids. My advice is allow yourself time to admire all the different orchids grown here, and those of the VIPs. Don't rush yourself through as you will hate yourself when you just breeze through all the lovely orchids and landscaping. Though Singapore is a tropical country with sunny weather, it's ok to visit on a sunny day, but a cloudy day will enhance the experience of your visit more."
,,Beautiful respite from city life,4.0,,"This place is perfect for a break from the hustle and bustle of Singapore. The flowers are beautiful and arranged in many different environments and ways to keep the attraction interesting. It is not as small as you would expect, so there is lots to see.

,,A beautiful place,5.0,,We greatly enjoyed visiting the National Orchid Garden. It is set in a beautifully landscaped setting. It has an amazing number of orchids from all over the world in one place. It is easy to get around and has good facilities. Any visit to Singapore should include this on your program. It is within easy distance from the City Centre and of course spotlessly clean.
,,Blooming fantastic,5.0,,"An amazing flower show even when it wasn't the right season. As part of the Botanic Gardens it is a must see. For S$5 to get in, even for a no garden type like me the colours are absolutey amazing."
,,A riot of colour,5.0,,"I'm a massive fan of Botanic Gardens and the orchid garden in Singapore is one of the best. Not only does it have a lot of varieties and species but has a wonderful layout and beautiful displays. Make sure you have plenty of room on your camera memory card.
On a hot day the Botanical Gardens can be quite arduous to walk around, so go straight to the Orchid Garden and spend your time there before collapsing in a shady spot."
,,With my wife,5.0,,If you like Orchid then this is a must and certainly the only place in the world you could see so many different types. A real nice and large outdoor visit to be done maybe in the morning prior to visit the zoo I recommend

Here adults'ticket is $5 but for students and senior citizens it's $1. Here one VIP orchids' garden is also there. One can't imagine the color, shape and beauty without seeing it."
,,Well worth a vist,5.0,,"Unsure the best time to see orchids - we visited in October and there were still a few hundred to see. Felt like there would be even more if you went during the right season.

The VIP orchid area was interesting - where orchids had been created and named after famous visitors such as Margaret Thatcher and William & Catherine.

Lots of places to take photos surround by the orchids. Very well taken care of - with winding paths and different areas to see. Seemed good value at $8 entrance fee."

Easy to find these gardens using public transport.
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,"An absolute must see when in Singapore!! Beautiful gardens with easy walking paths and if you are looking for unique gifts, the gift shops have items I did not see elsewhere.

A note if you are arriving by MRT. The station is at the northern end of the gardens - the orchid gardens themselves are in the middle of the botanic gardens precinct. There's about a 1km walk from the station to the orchid gardens. There is a car/taxi drop off point at the orchid gardens entry point (off Tyersall road) so arriving by taxi and departing by by MRT saves extra walking and allows you to see the best of both!!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"This is an amazing array of Orchids. Orchids of all types shapes and sizes. The plants are well marked to identify the various names and types.

The only down side is that the exhibit takes quite a bit of walking which can be quite tiring in the heat and humidity."
,,Orchid lover destination,5.0,,"Loved the orchids view, but the shops are pricey . But for ppl who love and understand orchid will love this place. And it's always a treat for the eye. I wish they would conduct or share pamphlets on how to grow orchids."

,,Wow!,5.0,,"Located in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the Orchard gardens are a visual feast. It can be pretty hot work wandering around but it really is worth the effort. As well as orchards, there are also bromiliads and other tropical plants all arranged in stunning displays amidst the tropical jungle gardens."
,,Paradise for Orchid lovers,5.0,,"We visited these gardens as part of a City Tour and enjoyed seeing different orchids, some of which are named after famous people, including David Cameron.

Each orchid is named either for the grower whose green fingers created the hybrid such as the national flower the Vanda Miss Joachim: named for the Armenian lady gardener who need the first bloom. Others are named after celebrities and very important people who have visited Singapore. There's an elegant white orchid for Princess Diana, named posthumously although had history been different she would have visited later in 1997. On a happier note Prince William and his wife did visit and chose the hybrids that bear their names. A stroll around the garden is a pleasant hour or so to enjoy tropical flowers.

Lucky we have digital cameras in this day and age as you would have run out of film before you had seen 1 percent of the different variations of orchids growing here.

It's pretty hot here as you walk around so you will glad to get some relief as you go through the Cool House which is sort of the reverse of a green house in that it's air-conditioned ... why? ... because the plants in this place can't stand the heat.

There are so many beautiful orchids here that after a while you become de-sensitized to the beauty of the individual species so take your time and take them all in.

We whet there with RMG tours ... it's the easiest way to see the sights of Singapore ... they come and pick you up at your hotel, take you around and drop you off ... but they always threaten to leave you behind if you are not at the meeting point at the appropriate time when it's time to go home .. but they never did.

So for a break from the shopping and eating, come and see some beautiful orchids."

It is a nice cool corner of the gardens to get some relief from the unrelenting Singapore heat as well."

Be warned though - it can be quite hot there, but to offset this the paths are generally well shaded by the trees.

Must see in Singapore."

,,ORCHIDS GALORE,5.0,,"NATIONAL ORCHID GARDEN, SINGAPORE
VISITED AUGUST 2016

This memorable visit was one of the highlights of my Singapore City Sights tour, so I decided to make this a separate review.

Entry to the orchid garden was to the left, through a gift shop and a set of turnstiles. It wasn’t long before one could hear gasps, as visitors saw the beauty that lay before them. As a keen photographer, I was eager to ‘capture’ as many orchid images as I could. Attached are but a few.

Upon entering the gardens, we were instructed by the tour guide to be back at the coach in one hour. As the orchid garden is part of the botanical gardens, this time period wasn’t nearly long enough. Should I visit Singapore again, I will travel to the gardens independently, so I could stroll freely to enjoy this wonderful landmark.

For photographers and orchid lovers alike, a visit is a must."

However, the amount of orchids and other fixtures such as trellises, statues, etc really make this a nice place to visit for a couple of hours and it's worth the price.

,,Great value,5.0,,"This is a must see for any garden lover. The orchid gardens are amazing and have thousands of varieties of orchids, gingers, bromeliads and other beautiful plants. Entrance fee is $5 per person and it is very relaxing taking a wander through these beautiful gardens.
Don't miss this one."
,,Pleasantly surprised!!!,5.0,,"Went to the Botanic Gardens for a walk. Daughter's school had just brought her for a learning journey there and she was so excited to show us all she had learnt. So we went.

And boy did we not regret it. Especially the National Orchid Garden! It was such a beautifully kept gardens with a wide variety of orchids to view. Very well spaced out with nice walking paths and well placed signs to guide us along. Totally didn't expect to be so bowled over by this garden. Well done National Parks Board!"
,,My favourite haunt for photographing orchid flowers!,5.0,,"Within the grounds of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, a UNESCO Heritage site, is the National Orchid Garden, opened on 20 October 1995 by Singapore's late Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.
It’s one of my favorite haunts for photographing orchids, especially when there are so many varieties on display at any one time. I visit the place several times a month and was there this morning. There are admission fees (see below) but this week being a school break week, admission was waived for senior citizens and school children.

It’s good to go early in the morning when the tour buses have not arrived. Otherwise the National Orchid Gardens can be pretty crowded. Around 9 am in the morning is about right. It’s still cool and fairly quiet, almost like having the place entirely to oneself. It’s wheel chair friendly. No free WiFi. There a lot’s of places to sit within the grounds and shaded areas to cool off. Unfortunately, the public toilets are where the exits of the Orchid Garden are, next to the Gardens shop. Bring a hat, drinking water, unless you want to pay tourist’s prices at the kiosk! For the sensitive, a mosquito repellant may be desirable. Watch out for ‘photo spots’, areas prepared for you to take a selfie or a picture with a picturesque background. You cannot get lost as there are adequate signs around to point you in the direction you want to go.

My favorite is the Tan Hoon Siang Misthouse where there’s a concentration and display of orchid flowers. It’s here I shoot many of the orchid flowers in my photographic collection. I usually spend just over a hour in this section of the Botanic Gardens.

,,Fantastic Orchard Displays,5.0,,I stop at the Orchard Gardens and enjoyed a leisurely walk throughout the Gardens looking at gorgeous orchards. Definitely worth the trip.

,,Orchids galore,5.0,,Amazing selection of orchids in all colours and a really good display of them all. Amazing experience.
,,Interesting Visit,4.0,,Brought the kids and my parents for a visit. I guess it was more interesting for the adults than for the children though. There were a number of varieties and the orchids and plants were beautiful. They are very well maintained. Some were so beautiful that they were surreal. Do remember your insect repellent. I wished the gift shop sold varieties of orchids at more reasonable prices. It would probably encourage more interest in cultivating orchids especially to local residents. Maybe every Singapore home could proudly display the national flower one day.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"This orchid garden is beautiful. Filled with numerous varieties of orchids, it truly is a lovely place to visit for flower lovers. Peaceful and plenty of photo opportunities."

It made me wish I had a better understanding of horticulture, botany and orchids. A hint - there is a hawker stand at the Raffles building where the staff eats - it is easy to find and has the best (and cheapest) food. Enjoy your visit and take your time - orchids require time."

A tree top walk to another area. Just lovely"
,,Must see.,5.0,,"It's like walking into a candy store but for Orchid enthusiasts . You learn the different varieties and lovely ways to grow them. Their displays were beautiful and fun. I learned a lot about their nomenclature and they stay with you. There are some local tropical plants as well which look amazing in their own habitat. The shop has some lovely preserved orchids for keepsakes. Take your time don't rush this visit. It doesn't really take that long if you are on a schedule. It's a great way to wind down and have a stroll in the midst of a flurry of sightseeing. Just watch out for the temperature though , you don't want it unbearably hot."
,,Somewhere over the Rainbow,5.0,,My second visit to the Orchid Garden and more amazing than I remembered. So many awesome colors and magnificent flowers. A lovely afternoon spent wandering around the gardens and taking in the beauty.
,,"Very pretty, well displayed",4.0,,"Not many tourists would think that taking a couple of hours off a trip to visit an orchid display would be worthwhile.

,,Simply stunning,5.0,,"Definitely worth the $5 entrance fee - especially as the rest of the gardens are free. We took some fantastic photos but also simply enjoyed the beauty and tranquility of the place. Some of the ""domes"" were a little busy but overall there was a sense of space. Although it was the choice of the adults in our group the teenagers really enjoyed it too.
We did this on a rainy day - still beautiful!"
,,Awesome isplay,5.0,,"Great varieties of plants on display, not just orchid. It is air conditioned,which is more enjoyable to stay as long as you like. For me it gives ideas to do planting in my garden. Colours, foliage, in pots. Fantastic."
,,Wide variety but not worth the $5 fee.,3.0,,1.3km hike from the Botanic Gardens gate but the hike gives you good exercise plus a good view. I just did not think the $5 entrance fee to the orchid garden is worth it though that might be because I'm not an orchid expert.

,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,"Set within the Botanic Gardens and costing $5 to get in, this is worth every cent. I could have spent all day here, and I'm not even that interested in plants. Well thought out and designed this garden really can't be faulted"
,,Fantastic..,5.0,,"We have been to Botanic Gardens and then to National Orchid Garden. Both are lovely. I have not seen this many orchids all together in my life. It is quite big, so plan 2 hrs. at least. There is a nice cafe outside, you can enjoy some drinks there."

,,Great place to see the variety of orchids,4.0,,Nice place to stroll through in an afternoon to enjoy the sights of the many orchid variety. Some are quite rare too. Do give yourself ample time to stroll rather than just rush by. It's a beautiful garden!
,,"Great, But Expect to Walk",5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is inside of the Singapore Botanical Gardens. You can get there via MRT, which stops immediately adjacent the entry gate. However, the National Orchid Garden is quite a hike from the entrance of the Botanical Gardens. And once one gets to the National Orchid Garden, there is quite a bit of walking to see it all. Allow about an hour to 90 minutes just for the National Orchid Garden. $5 admission for adults. Good to visit in the morning to avoid the heat. Nice restaurant, Halia, is adjacent entrance to the National Orchid Garden."
,,Stunning and very enjoyable public garden located in a larger garden,5.0,,"Plan to spend 1/2 day here, morning is best due to the temperatures. Walking paths are wheel chair accessible. Several shops and restaurants available."
,,Beautiful and Peaceful,5.0,,"I visited this site during a bus tour and we were given perhaps 25 mins to explore the orchid gardens. It's was simply beautiful, and I wish I could've stayed longer. It was raining lightly, and that made everything look clean and fresh. It was very peaceful and quite a colorful feast for the eyes! I highly recommend visiting the National Orchid Garden!"
,,Orchid selection is great. Very hot.,4.0,,"Singapore being a botanist's heaven, this orchid garden is quite a nice place. Quite a. lot of varities or orchids.
A greenhouse dedicates to the orchids adds to the bliss. Although the orchid garden is named to possess just orchids, one can spot a lot of other plants & flowers too. (For e.g. Utricularia)
The collection of orchids will definitely exceed 100 varieties though the count from the garden authorities quote a much higher figure.
It is a macro photographer's paradise. Tripods are allowed. Not so crowded given the blistering heat of Singapore. The entry fee of just 5$ is quite cheap though its a small garden.
Singapore has no natural spots or attractions. Therefore such places are worth a visit.
Skip visiting on a Sunday because the maids occupy the botanic gardens and one might feel crowded or inconvenient just to visit the garden for a strol."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Just an amazing display of plant life. Totally enjoyed just spending my time checking out the beautiful displays. Just amazing.
,,Nice park for a hot walk,4.0,,Large garden and beautiful flowers I would say. We were thete with a toddler for an afternoon walk and it was quite ok. For kids there are swans and ducks at the lakes to look at. For adults just the beauty of the orchids is stunning. There are endless different varieties and you will be bored before you see everything so keep in mind to taka a break. There is a nice cafe at the park and we managed to see an ape climing in the threes. So lots of water and shadow are necessary.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"I have never seen so many orchids in my whole life; so many different colours and sizes. Go as early in the morning as possible, before it gets too hot, and enjoy the view and lovely walk in the garden."

,,Not your usual garden.,4.0,,"From what I've seen during the time we went here, a lot of couple were coming in to take their wedding shoots. I remember seeing at least 3 couples having their photo shoot in various areas of the garden. The foliage is beautiful. Nature photographers will love coming here."
,,Tropical Spleandour,5.0,,I have visited this attraction many times and it never fails to disappoint. Different times of the year and different weather affects the plants and the colours so it is always worth a repeat visit. It is especially fine after a rain shower when glistening drops on the colourful orchids make for good photographs. It can get a bit hot but there is a cool house where some temperate varieties of plants can be examined whilst you cool off and get some respite from the humidity. Don't forget your camera.
,,Fantastic Experience,5.0,,This is a must do experience if you can fit it in to your Singapore visit - overwhelming beauty. 5 Singapore dollars to access the garden is well worth it - absolutely fantastic.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Worth a visit. The different varieties of Orchid they grow is amazing. It is really beautiful, colourful and very relaxing."
,,"Another must see in Singapore, small and beautiful!",5.0,,"The orchid garden located within the botanical garden, is another must see. It does not take much time, and very close to Orchard Road, so you can plan a quick morning or afternoon trip, perhaps plan a brunch in the nice restaurant inside the Botanical Garden and make a half day trip. Huge collection of orchids and very well maintained indeed. The main enclosure is air-conditioned."
,,Lovely afternoon walk,4.0,,I have visited the orchid garden on numerous occasions and I always enjoy it. It is beautifully laid with so many different types of orchids to see. It's a great place for a relaxing afternoon walk away from the madness of the city.

,,Most awesome Orchids,5.0,,"Never seen so many beautiful orchids in one place. The variety of colours are a treat to the visual senses. The VIP orchids, named after some very important people in the world, were very intersting."
,,Gorgeous orchids and $1 entry fee for seniors!,5.0,,"The orchids were fabulous. The pavilion housed orchids of brilliant colors in many different shapes and sizes, and the varieties numerous. Photos definitely do not do these gorgeous plants justice. They must be seen to be believed. There was also a Princess Diana orchid and other famous orchids with descriptions and commentaries.

,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Wonderful Gardens 1000's of orchids so much to see, the cool houses are a relief from the heat there re plenty of toilets and small shops selling snacks near by also water fountains to refill bottle of drinking water"
,,National Orchid Garden a must-see,5.0,,Unbelievable array of orchids. Nicely laid out. Useful commentaries posted throughout. One of the high points of Singapore.
,,Orchid Garden,5.0,,"If your limited for time on your trip to Singapore,leave out the Chinese and Japanese Gardens, but DON'T miss the Orchid Garden. It is one of the ""must see"" places. Allow 3 hours, there is so many beautiful plants to see. We took a taxi out there to save some time, but there is a bus service available, with a short walk."
,,Precious!,5.0,,Recommended in the early morning. Amazing for those who love orquids. Haven't seen the variety they have of them in elsewhere. Once is not enough.

,,Nice place but not a must see,4.0,,"The flower exhibit is better in Gardens by the Bay. So if you came for orchids, you better go there. Though the garden is worth visiting if you are in the Botanic gardens."
,,Loved the visit - would have liked longer,4.0,,Three days in Singapore on the way to Australia simply was not long enough. For such a modernised city it really is green and very pretty - had a combined ticket to the Orchid and Botanic Gardens = stunning

The highlight is the Orchids and many are on display. It is very relaxing to wander the paths and look at all the beautiful flowers. Visiting in July does mean hot & humid temperatures, so come prepared with plenty of water."
,,Stunning Orchids,5.0,,This place is well worth the visit - I have never seen so many varied types of orchids and the gardens are absolutely stunning.
,,Hot and tiring,5.0,,"Worth visiting but only if you have an interest in flowers, so many orchids and was hot walking around, not helped by my husband using a stick but you can make the visit as short or as long as you wish."
,,An afternoon excursion,4.0,,"My three-year old daughter and I visited this garden yesterday.
I read on the website that people normally spend thirty minutes there.
We spent more than two hours for watching the flowers and taking the photos.
It would be better to bring stroller for the kids and also some snacks and juice for them.
Although it is not too many mosquitos there, it`s safer to use the mosquito ripplent.
If you are a professional photographer, it will be pleasant for you finding beautiful view there.
In my idea, Orchid garden isn`t a unique place for tourists. It is just a clean and green place for an evening walk with the family.
If you are going to visit there lonely, don't forget your monopod!
The humidity in this garden is more than open areas then don't forget tissues"
,,Wonderful display,5.0,,"Part of the Botanical gardens you have pay $5 to access but definitely worth it. A huge, breathtsking display of orchids- didn't know there were so many. It also includes a cool house with a wide variety of other other plants and it's a great place to cool off."
,,Beautiful but busy on Saturday,3.0,,"The garden is within the Botanic Gardens. It cost S$5 to enter. It was a beautiful, meandering garden of orchid displays. Not all were flowering but many were. Go during the week when it's less busy. Also, there are toilets at places other than the gift shop near where you buy tickets. There was a huge queue for the ladies' toilets, but we started our walk through the Orchid Garden and found others along the way with no queues at all."
,,Must visit,5.0,,Had such an enjoyable day here worth the time to visit there is so much to see but be prepared for the walk take water with you and good walking shoes you wont regret going
,,Beautiful,4.0,,A wonderful experience for orchid lovers and macro photographers alike. Not the most dynamic layout but an incredible variety of flowers on display.
,,Singapore orchids at their best,5.0,,This place is easy to get to using the MRT. It has an entry fee (but has a seniors discount for other countries as well). The paths are easily accessible and there are seats strategically placed if you need to stop and enjoy the beauty. Would highly recommend to spend a couple of hours.
,,Just..wonderful,5.0,,Orchids of any kind everywhere ..ones more beautiful than others..such a great choice( small or huge ones) but it's areal pleasure to visit the orchid garden...
,,Fantastic orchid displays,4.0,,This is a great way to spend a few hours wandering the park and gardens to see the orchid displays and spot the odd exotic bird and lizard. The display of orchids in the orchid house is stunning. Well worth the trip out by MRT and so easily accessible
,,Beautiful experience,5.0,,The variety of orchids and their display were amazing. Especially enjoyed seeing the celebrity and VIP orchid areas and finding the orchids named for Prince William and Jackie Chan.
,,Eye Candy,5.0,,"This Orchid Garden requires a paid-admission, unlike the rest of the Botanic Gardens but it does have a Senior Discount.

There are many paved ""trails"" that branch off in different directions, so it takes time to backtrack to other paths unseen. Each orchid variety is appropriately labeled and the variations in color are astounding.

We took countless photos of course... but it was warm & humid so our endurance was limited."
,,A beautiful day,5.0,,There is veraity of orchid which all are beautiful .i recommend you to see one of the best garden .reaching the garden is easy thanks to good transportation of the city.its good especially for farmer or scientist or anyone that are interested in agreeculture.i had good time with my wife there and i never forget it.they named some orchid as respect to famous people like England's queen or other famous people around the world to their name i mean they put the famous people's name on the orchid as a simbol.
,,A must to visit,5.0,,"The orchids are fantastic such a verity of colour's, size, type etc. You pay a small fee to enter the Orchid gardens which are in the middle of the Botanic Gardens (which are free) Even though the weather was not the best on the day we went we spent ages wandering around taking lots of photos."
,,A treat,5.0,,"I'm not usually going into Botanic Gardens but felt I will give it a go and I was not disappointed. This attraction is a must see even if you are not usually visit such places but its been stunning. The variety and the way the garden is organised just makes it a real worthwhile trip and I do not regret to go there. It is just a stunning setting and very well thought out.

,,What's in there,3.0,,Lots of varieties of orchids and a mini cool dome. There is also a section with orchid hybrids named after political figures for political goodwill. Entrance fee is quite affordable. The orchid garden is neither near the tanglin gate nor the Caldecott mrt gate. But I would say it is nearer to the tanglin gate (exits to the hospital and tanglin area). Tanglin area extends to Orchard road shopping district.

Most part of the gardens is free, you only have to pay for the orchid garden (5sd) but it's totally worth it! I've never seen so many orchids in my life. The park itself is full of history and there are small museums for free, like the unesco museum or the hetitage museum. For food we went to the raffles building. There is a small food court.

,,The highlight of our trip,5.0,,"As keen orchid growers seeing so many beautiful orchids in one place was astounding BUT beware, if you have difficulty walking then be prepared for a very long frustrating walk from the SMRT station to the Orchid House. The shop had many beautiful items to buy. The photographs I took are fabulous and it lived up to all my expectations. Seniors are charged $1 entry fee, I can't think of anywhere in the world offering better value for money."

,,Enchanting garden with beauty of orchid,5.0,,"During my family trip, I couldn't skip this place since my mom loves orchid. It is the only place that charges (S $5 for adults, S $1 for children above 6) in botanic gardens and I strongly believe it is due to the nature of orchid (being very delicate). Even with admission fee, it was definitely worth going in there, since it offers so many different kinds of orchid, wonderfully maintained."
,,Beautiful and fantastic student price,5.0,,"Only £1 entry for a student and it's well worth it! The flowers are beautiful and never ending! There are so many to see!

Great perks about the botanical gardens are lots of free drinking water stations by every toilet which is essential for a hot day and could get price you otherwise. Reasonable price to get a snack but I wouldn't want to pay for a whole meal for my family there so advise taking some food with you!

Lots of walking from th MRT station over 1km so make sure you have comfy shoes on and plan your route round he gardens well so you don't have to go back on yourself"

The blooms are great but also the landscaping. The VIP garden at the top (plants named after dignitaries), has some very special blooms.
When done have a walk thru the ginger garden at bottom and lunch at Halia. Three seating options: outside, outside under shade and very effective fans or inside (refrigerated). Range of very good and well priced food and beverage.
A great half day (and can be done in an hour or two if you have limited time)."

,,Well worth visiting,5.0,,"This is part of the Botanical Gardens which are only one of 3 heritage listed gardens worldwide. While the main gardens are free entry, there is a small fee to enter the Orchid Gardens, and it is well worth it. Largest display of tropical orchids in the world.
We made one mistake and went about mid day; too hot. Suggest to go very early to avoid the heat as there is a bit of walking."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"I love orchids! So for me it was super nice! I would have lived to spend more time just enjoying the beauty of the plants and flowers, but I had my younger sister with me, so it wasn't possible. It's quite humid, but that didn't really bother me too much...

,,Lovely place to spend the day,4.0,,"My fiancée and I visited the National Orchid Garden on a Saturday afternoon mid July. During our visit there wasn't too many other tourists around (possibly due to it being a warm and sunny afternoon), hence we had the chance to enjoy the scenery and the flowers.

Lots of orchids and other flowers / plants.

Entrance for adults is only 5 SGD, which is quite a bargain taking into account how much there is to see.

Make sure you bring some water with you, as it can get quite warm in Singapore and the garden area is no exception.

Taxi from the downtown area to the National Orchid Garden should set you back approx. 20-25 SGD. One of the bus routes for the hop on hop off buses (Duck & Hippo CitySightseeing) also takes you to and from the garden."
,,Very relaxing,4.0,,"I love orchids, they're my favorite, so it was a must for me to go here when I was visiting Singapore.

,,Lively,5.0,,"An absolute must in Singapore. Good walk out, amazing plants and flowers. Knowledgeable staff. Truly lovely way to spend a couple of hours."
,,As Good As The Gardens By The Bay,5.0,,This place is a must whilst in Singapore. There is so many orchids and plants to look at and a lovely place to take a walk. The gift shop was also very good. Lovely orchids you can buy in glass containers. (The also let you bring them in to Australia. The ladies said they wouldn't but the do.)
,,Just Wow!,5.0,,Do not miss this if you're In Singapore. It is contained within the greater park and so there is still a lot to see beyond the Orchids. It can in fact be a whole day outing if you please.
,,Great Display,4.0,,A fine hot day. A very reasonably priced attraction. Very informative and display set out beautifully.
,,A vibrant explosion of colour!,5.0,,Plan to spend some time here so you have a chance to take in the beauty of this Garden. The plaques are very informative and worth reading if you have a green thumb. Also ensure the camera is on board and charged. The VIP section is mandatory:)

,,Glorious,5.0,,"We took the undergound to the Gardens. Lots of interesting areas to see, the Ginger garden, cactus area, orchids. Had a nice lunch there too. Lovely to see lots of locals with their children and dogs enjoying the gardens. Took a small travel blanket and had a nice hour just sitting on a grassy area relaxing."
,,A beautiful place,5.0,,I've always loved orchids and the wide variety on display is truly breathtaking. I would recommend anyone to see and experience for themselves
,,Stunning Variety In a Tropical Paradise,4.0,,"Best time to visit are early morning or later afternoon ( close at 5pm). Bring an umbrella in case it rains or to shield from the afternoon sun. You might know much about Orchids but you can certainly appreciate the colors, the varietals and how they grow on almost everything...on dead log, trunk, lava rock or by itself on-air! There are other orchid gardens in the world ( Kandy in Sri Lanka has a section of it ) but nothing compares to the spectacular display and arrangements here. Good way to spend a couple of hours just be close to the wonders of nature. The gift shops at end of tour offer many options for a few things to take home for your love ones."
,,Nice and Peaceful,3.0,,"A pleasant way to spend a quiet afternoon. The garden is well maintained and houses a great variety of orchids. It is an educational experience as you can learn about the various types of orchids and how they are grown. The highlight for me was Burkill Hall, one of the last Anglo-Malayan plantation houses in the world. It was where the directors of the gardens used to stay. Next to the house is where they have all the orchids named after the famous people who visited Singapore. The garden will be upgraded in due time so might be good to catch it before it is revamped into something much flashier."
,,Superbly maintained...,5.0,,It's awesome with a huge variety of orchids n flowers... It is a part of Botanic Gardens.. Be ready to walk a lot as its a huge area.. Go early in the morning to avoid crowd for taking pictures and also to escape d hot weather.
,,So many Orchids!,5.0,,Orchids are some of my favourite flowers! The variety in the National Orchid Garden was the best I've ever seen!
,,A feast of my soul,4.0,,Flowers are beautiful and if you're a photographer or like to take the pictures you should choose this place. You can stay inside and spend your lovely afternoon without sweating .
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The botanical gardens are free and to enter the orchid garden which really takes up about 25% of the whole gardens is well worth it. I think as a senior it cost maybe $1 and $5 if you weren't. Magnificent display. Could only grow like this in Singapore. Take a bottle of water.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This area of the botanic gardens requires a small entrance fee . It's a beautiful area with a cool house ( a respite from the heat!) and many different kinds of orchid. Many fascinating species , wonderful to see."
,,"Beautiful Gardens, Well Maintained",5.0,,"An amazing set of gardens, lush with tropical plants that one doesn't always see. Spotlessly clean. Easy to navigate"
,,Beautiful flowers,5.0,,Situated inside the botanical gardens and the one place you have to pay an admission price for. Costs 5 Singapore dollars but if you are over 60 and have ID (we had copies of our passports) then it is 1 dollar. Large collection of the most beautiful orchids. There iare celebrity and VIP sections where some orchids have been dedicated to famous people in politics and the arts. Well worth a visit.
,,Best orchid farm,5.0,,It is located inside the botanical garden. It has a entrance fee but still very reasonable and cheap. Senior citizens have discounts. Be ready to walk. It has indoor gardens also. Bets for parents especially the moms.
,,Joegrog,5.0,,"Mind blowing a reminder what paradise might be like colourful,rich,magical and engages all the senses Not to be missed at any cost"
,,A feast for the eyes.,5.0,,"What a beautiful garden. As a bonus, it is full of photo opportunities because the flowers are so beautiful. Whether you are a professional photographer or not, I am sure all the photo's you take there cannot help but look good.
There is an enormous variety of Orchids and such vivid colours.
You do have to pay a fee to get in but it is worth it and I am sure they need the funds to keep the garden in such good condition."
,,Wow - amazing,5.0,,"I admit I love flowers and orchids, but I think anyone would enjoy the Orchids here. The garden opens at 8:30am and admission fee is 5SGD. I came here early to beat the forecast of thunderstorms and may have been the first one in. The variety of orchids is amazing and the grounds are peaceful (much like the rest of the surrounding free admission Botanic Garden). In total, I spent about an hour taking lots of photos and enjoying the beautiful orchids.

Given the early opening hours, I suggest coming here early in the morning to beat the heat (and give you something to do those early mornings you may be awake due to jet lag). The Mist Garden is not to be missed and save the Cool House for when you're hot from the humidity."
,,Must see if you love orchids,5.0,,"If you love orchids then you can't miss a visit to Singapore's Orchid Garden. My mother loves to grow orchids and makes a point to visit this garden whenever she visits Singapore ... She says she's never seen a larger variety of the flowering plants anywhere. The Orchid Garden is actually located within the Singapore Botanic Gardens at 1 Cluny Road.
Basic info - Opening hours: 8.30am to 7pm daily (last ticket sales and entry at 6pm); Admission fee: $5.00 for adults $1.00 for students $1.00 for senior citizens (60 years and above) Free for children below 12 years

,,"it was a beautiful, beautiful place.",5.0,,Even though the skies opened up and pored on us it was magical! So many types of orchids and greenery. I think everyone would enjoy it.
,,A visit here is a MUST to add to your itinerary,5.0,,"These gardens are breathtaking even if you are not a gardener they are worth the visit.Gardeners can be inspired with many new ideas to rake home and enhance your home garden.
We planned to see al, the gardens but only had time to visit this section."
,,Beautiful experience,5.0,,Lots of people meandering through the garden. Ranged in age and nationality. All found something of interest.
,,Incredible colorful orchids,5.0,,Highly recommend to visit and feel how amazing and colorful the nature is. Very romantic place. The best in the world
,,Massive beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"This place is huge and very beautiful! There is also loads going on throughout the Gardens so you may want to put aside a few hours to explore. It was a very hot steamy day when we visited which took away the enjoyment a little bit – I would have definitely stayed longer if the weather was cooler.
We started off with the kid’s section which was a bit of a dud even if you were a kid. Well I am being a bit unfair – I think it is more suited to kids under 5. Once we were done with that I headed for the National Orchid Garden. It was a lovely walk with everything from bonsai trees to gazebos in-between. Near the entrance to the Orchid Garden is Halia. I stopped in here for a coffee and it has a lovely atmosphere – again would be a great place for a proper lunch.
Post caffeine it was into the Orchid Garden. This is a big place!!! It is very beautiful – they have made the most of every step with lots of benches surrounded by gorgeous orchids all designed as Photo stops! It is selfie stick central in here especially as I went on a Sunday – helper’s day off.
There is every type of orchid experience you could imagine – orchid strands developed for VIPs from Margaret Thatcher to Kate and Wills. There is a mist room as well as a cool room for the rarer strands. It is almost easy to get lost in here!
Last up was a stroll down to Swan Lake. I had read there were mute swans on the lake and for some reason this intrigued me. Alas by the time I got there I was rather exhausted from heat and walking and only took a cursory look around – no swans! It was rather steamy and overcast by this time so dreadful light thus no photos. It would be worth coming back here in different weather conditions."
,,The Orchid Garden is superb.,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are definitely worth a visit if you're into parks and gardens to any degree. The Orchid Garden is well worth the separate entrance fee. Beautiful flowers presently in an elegant garden. Just remember Singapore is steamy! Shorts, T-Shirts and sandals for any westerner!"
,,Nice garden,3.0,,Good choice for a morning walk. Quiet and calm. But not a must see. It is located next to a MRT. Have a look if looking for a free attraction.
,,Most exciting range of orchids,4.0,,"Recommend going on a cloudy day, on a sunny day avoiding going between 12-4pm because the heat can become unbearable. There are drinking water fountains and washroom in the Orchid Garden. A highlight of this garden is the cool room - a special AC area with rare orchids and plants - a good cool off if you take a whole round of the garden.

It is around Singapore $5, and it is worth seeing the garden once. Plenty of pretty photos opps and perfect for selfies."
,,Overflow of wonderful orchids,5.0,,Everybody who loves orchids and to see so many different species should visit the orchid garden inside the Botanic Gardens. You will be not disappointed and you have to take some time to see all this varius colours of the orchids.
,,Stunning. And not redundant with Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,Stunning. And certainly not redundant to Gardens by the Bay. Classic and beautiful...even my teens enjoyed.
,,So lovely,5.0,,We took the hop on off bus to the a Orchid Garden which is in the Botanic Gardens. There are so many Orchids it's mind blowing... Who knew. The Orchid Garden is just a part of the Gardens with the Ginger Garden and The Healing Garden. We stopped first at the cafe for some refreshing juices and a nibble. Everything is so neat and tidy. Give it a go.
,,Simply breathtaking!,5.0,,"A first time visit to the Singapore Botanic Gardens. No admission to the gardens, but there is a nominal fee for the Orchid Garden. It is worth every cent!

We parked at the Nassim Gate and walked through the Visitors Center area, then followed the Rain Forest trail to reach the Orchid Garden.

All I can say is Wow! I have never seen so many orchids in bloom. The colors, the varieties, the landscape full of colorful orchids. Just so beautiful.

Well worth a visit."
,,Botanic smile,5.0,,Very nice walk and very interesting how many orchids there are. Lovely smells from beautiful flowers and plants. Take a deep breath !
,,Beautiful orchids,4.0,,"The orchid garden is quite lovely. There is a $5 admission fee, but I got in for $1 as a senior citizen. The only disadvantage to the visit is the very long walk to it from the metro station. If I had known how far I would have to walk there (and back), I probably wouldn't have gone."
,,A must see when you are in the Botanic Gardens of Singapore,4.0,,"The only country I know that crowned a hybrid Orchid (The famed Vanda Miss Joaquim) as a national flower, Singapore, my lovely country is the proud host of hundreds of beautiful and special orchids in the National Orchid Garden.

Located within the UNESCO certified Botanic Gardens, this exhibit has some of the most exotic species of orchids for the discerning visitor.

Put on a hat, hold on to your camera/camere phone and enjoy a lovely stroll admiring and capturing memories within this beautiful floral garden.

Cheers!"
,,Beautiful Displays,5.0,,"My brother and husband enjoyed this part of the tour. That should speak for itself. They don't particularly care about flowers, but enjoyed seeing the beautiful variety here.

,,one more,4.0,,People amased for flowers. maybe the best in the world for orchid collection. Wow such an idea naming new breeds to celeblities. one more thing do't miss. Cafe Halia just outside if Orchid garden. Pay a visit then you will see.
,,Wonderful display of orchids,5.0,,Great place if you are an orchid lover or even a lover of gardens or just love nature. Well laid out and well cared for it is magic when all of the orchids are in bloom. Make sure that you visit all of the displays when you go.

,,Lovely!,5.0,,"We visited here while on a day tour of the city. Certainly a ""must do"" while in this city of orchids!"
,,Outstanding!,5.0,,"Truly beautiful and worth a trip to the Botanical Gardens. World class collection, beautifully arranged. A nice walk within the Gardens, which are otherwise free and worth a visit in and of themselves. Easily reached on the MRT. Just be prepared to take it slow and drink a lot of water, given the weather."
,,take some time to walk to there,4.0,,"is a good place to visit, but it seem located centrally in the garden, dont go on day time, ""hot die us"""
,,Spectacular Garden of Orchids,5.0,,"Good value entry fee that goes to support the maintenance of the garden and well worth the comfortable stroll the see the magnificence of these tropical plants in their natural environment. The garden is beautifully maintained and the variety of orchids was amazing. There were samples of all of the orchids that have been cultivated and named in honour of visiting dignitaries who came to the gardens including Queen Elizabeth, Princess Diana, the King and queen of Egypt.
Sheltered seating shaded by the plants along the pathways allows for regular resting bays to manage the heat though we went on an overcast day after the rain had stopped so the garden was cool and refreshed. Well worth a visit."
,,Beautiful location,5.0,,"Went here as part of a half day Singapore tour and consequently had only a limited time to explore and enjoy the gardens. Could have spent much more time as the gardens are beautifully kept, clean and well set out. There are many types of orchid on display and they look wonderful. A very relaxing and quiet setting. Clean rest rooms and a gift shop complete the attraction. Very easy to stroll around with maps strategically located to help you find your way. A must visit on any trip to Singapore. Highly recommended"
,,Massive and amazing,4.0,,"By English garden standard, this garden inside the garden is very big, with many different type of Orchid flowers.
It needs S$ 5, but really worth the money.
My only reservation, as always, is that there's a bit too much in the garden which actually compromises its natural beauty."
,,Take your camera .... be amazed,5.0,,The gardens are a haven from the crowds and the bustle of Singapore. Just wandering around the beautifully manicured gardens makes your blood pressure drop! Yet the orchids are so exciting. The camera was working overtime with all the stunning orchids. The orchids themselves are eyedroppingly gorgeous but the was they are organized and presented is a compliment to the staff and management. Must visit.
,,Orchids Galore,5.0,,We really enjoyed our short visit to this amazing facility. There were so many varieties and colors/shapes/sizes to see. It was very well kept and was a treasure.
,,Extraordinary collection in the nicest setting,5.0,,"A must see for everyone, the National Orchid Garden is a great introduction to the world of orchids. easy to spend at least an hour, but bring a book and spend a late afternoon on a bench if you have time for it. Closes at dusk."
,,"Orchids, Orchids & Orchids!",4.0,,"worth visiting especially in June, July and again Jan, Feb, March as these are the hot months and the orchids bloom very well. avoid public holidays or weekends as it gets too crowded and the walking trail upon entrance (chargeable) is small and the noise from the crowd can be quite overwhelming. visit any weekdays, you get the garden all to yourself and don't forget to walk the entire trail as there are hidden treasures (wild n rare orchids) in the confined air condition areas inside this garden."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Is a place you can not missed, bring your camera and make a calendar with these amazing orquids ! It also brings history memories, all the diplomats and royalty that have orquids planted after them...... Very beautiful !"
,,nice garden,4.0,,"you need to buy ticket to visit this place. you can see various orchid, which is singapore national flower. This place is good for people who love photography or flower, but for common people like me, it is just a nice to visit. The ticket is only sgd 5 anyway."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Small manicured garden inside the Botanical Gardens, charges a small fee and dogs are not admitted. Totally worth a visit, 1 hour is enough to cover it. The orchids displayed are amazing. There is a mist house, bromelia garden, cool house and VIP garden with hybrids created by their lab."
,,Lovely way to spend a few hours...worth the trip,5.0,,"It was blazing hot and very humid but we decided to visit the Orchid Garden anyway. Easy access via the train. A bit of a walk through the Botanic Garden to find the Orchid Garden. Beautifully done, easy walking paths and lots of fantastic photo opportunities. Make sure to visit the ""cool house"" for a bit of a break from the heat!"
,,Probably my favorite activity in Singapore,5.0,,"This is an great garden. It opens at 8:30am. I went on a Sunday morning and it was not crowded at that time. When I departed it was getting busy. It is full of manicured garden areas and rooms with may varieties or orchids. There is also a ""Cold House"" with higher altitude plants. It is a nice treat since it has AC and is a change from the humid and hot outside garden. I thoroughly enjoyed my approximately one hour visiting this garden. Great photo opportunities as well!"

,,Lovely highlight to a great botanic gardens,5.0,,Went to the orchid garden after seeing some of the botanic gardens and it was worth the 5 dollars entrance fee.

,,At least the plants are polite.,4.0,,"Great for an amateur photographer like myself but with the sun beating down it soon got a bit too much to bear. It is quite a far walk to the orchid garden, about 20 minutes in the heat was quite hard going so be prepared with water. There is so much to see and handy hints telling you where the best photo points are, some of them not so good hints but most of them are fab. The lake at side of the orchid garden is amazing with the amphitheatre just giving it something extra special. It is a shame that the staff in the gift shop at the end are so rude and spoil your experience a little."
,,Beautiful varieties of orchids,5.0,,The national orchid garden is a definite must visit when you are in Botanic Gardens (UNESCO heritage). With so many varieties of orchids you are spoilt for choice. Orchids that are named after VIPs & celebrities as well as the local orchids are all featured within the grounds.

The atmosphere also remains very cool out here. Check out my photos."

,,Top of the line orchids,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden will provide a wonderful and pleasant education about orchids, how they can be hybridised, how they have become such a commercial success for Singapore, and the role they have played in history and diplomacy (for example, one of the hybrids is named after Nelson Mandela, who visited the Garden as President of South Africa and was honoured by a very attractive orchid that now carried his name). The variety is impressive and the visitor can see orchids growing in many different kinds of settings. The National Orchid Garden is a good example of a combination of visitor attraction and research."
,,Orchids and squirrels,5.0,,"The orchid garden is a great place to get your plant fix in. While not exactly ""natural"" the many hybrid orchids are beautiful. The mist house and cool house are the most interesting."

They do have wonderful collection of orchids from different parts of the world. They do have a cool chamber to house orchids from colder regions. They develop lot of hybrids and are named after VIPs & Celebrities.
,,Wow!,5.0,,Right this is the deal! I went to the Singapore Botanic Garden but made a beeline to the Orchids! I quite simply love orchids! I only had three hours or so because I had to meet the grandchildren off the school bus! Honestly not even three hours in the Orchid Garden was enough for me! It was an exceptionally hot day so had to pace myself! To put things in perspective my taxi driver told me that one needs five days at the Botanical Garden. On reflection he is probably correct if you have a great interest in plants! I
,,Beautiful flowers in an amazing setting,5.0,,"You don't have to be a dedicated gardener to enjoy the flawless beauty of the many orchids on show in This wonderful garden. Many of the exhibited flowers are beautifully fragrant all of them are a beauty to behold.

,,"If you like orchids, this is heaven.",5.0,,"Having spent the entire previous day in the Gardens by the Bay (which also has amazing orchids), we wondered if this might be overdoing it, but no! Absolutely amazing display of stunning flowers.
Note: If it is a very hot day, try and get dropped off at an entrance near the Orchid Garden itself, as the Botanic Gardens (where they are located) are huge. If it is raining, maybe choose another day if that is possible!"
,,Beautiful flowers everywhere you look!,5.0,,Gorgeous orchids everywhere! This is worth the small admission price within the larger botanical gardens.

Don't miss the Swan Lake, it's gorgeous, though we only were graced with the presence of a solitary swan-but what a beauty she was! There's a nice little play area for kids with a tree house. Check their website for any concerts being held in the park on the days of your visit. And of course, the National Orchid Garden. Who knew there were so many different kinds of orchids, Absolutely beautiful!

Plan on going later in the day to escape the heat coz it becomes really sweltering if the sun is out. Take loads of water. And not to forget, it is the cheapest ticketed place in this city, where cheap things are hard to come by :-)"
,,Oasis in paradise,5.0,,"I first visited these gardens close on fourty years ago and over the years have seen them develop into a most spectacular display that they are today. So many beautiful orchids, of every colour and hybrid displayed in the most majestic way. You need to spend some time here don't try and rush through as there are just so many beautiful areas to visit and of course take your camera, phone, iPad because trust me you won't be happy with just the one photo"
,,Vast collection!,5.0,,"We paid the small entrance fee to the orchid garden whilst visiting the botanic garden. What an impressive collection!

This is a well thought out and well maintained specialist garden, very glad we chose to have a look round here."
,,GO when it is cool and cloudy day. Dont go if raining,5.0,,Challenging if you need to push a wheelchair up and down slope/stairs. It is about an hour walk ( slow and easy ) from Botanic garden MRT.

,,"For Family, Dates or even Social Outing for Elderly",5.0,,"Been to the Orchid Garden many times in the last few years. There were times when I visited with relatives from overseas. There were times when I visited with my husband and young children. Then there were times when I bring elderlies from a day care for a day out. Even Biden came to visit Orchid Garden during his last trip to Singapore in 2013. Orchid Garden is perfect for every occasion. Beautiful blooms, an explosion of colours and easy paths to saunter on, Orchid Garden caters to all interests and age groups. My only gripes are the tropical weather and insufficient shelters. You need to come prepared with a sun hat or umbrella, plenty of water (preferably ice cold) and maybe even a portable fan to cool yourself that. Had this garden been located in a cooler climate, I would come here every week!"
,,It only costs $5 to enter and lots to see,4.0,,"It's inside the botanical gardens nod very well laid out and maintained. There are orchids of all varieties, shapes and colours.

My husband wasn't too keen on visiting here but I persuaded him and wow was he blown away by the beauty and now says it was one of the best things we did while in Singapore!! I look at orchids in a whole different way now!!! A must do while in Singapore!
,,Mouthwatering experience,5.0,,As garden lovers my husband and I were absolutely enchanted by the National Orchid Garden. We saw the growing of orchids in those conditions just a lovely experience. The flowers and colours were magnificient. We came away thinking how we could improve the growing conditions for our orchids in Brisbane.....the gardens could keep someone (who has time) occupied for a good day..this would be our intention next time we visit Singapore.
,,Orchid Gardens at the Botanical Gardens,5.0,,Fantastic experience. Absolutely amazing colours and layout. You'll never put your camera down. Don't miss out Birkhill Hall and gardens at the very top of the hill which was built in 1868. Entrance to the Orchid Gardens costs just $5 but only $1 if you're over 60 !

Interestingly, i held my wedding here!"
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,Beautiful landscape and orchids in a serene and relaxing atmosphere. Be prepared to walk. There is a tasty restaurant where you can stop to have a meal or a light snack.
,,Very few orchids in bloom June 2016,2.0,,I'm not sure if it was off-season or just a bad year but there was just not that much to see here. A lot of green orchid plants and most with none or less than a half-dozen blooms on them. Rows and rows of green plants with no blooms at all. Was very underwhelming and I would have skipped this attraction and saved the S$5 if I knew in advance they were not in bloom.
,,Beautifully peaceful,5.0,,These Orchid Gardens are some of the best I've seen in my travels! I utterly loved it. It's very cheap to get in and the range of Orchids is incredible. Very beautiful and very peaceful place to visit
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"This is definitely value for $. The Botanical Gardens themselves are worth the visit & they are free, but the National Orchid Garden is the cherry on top. I've never been so snap happy with my camera but there were so many in flower. Truely a spectacular sight to see.
Make sure you visit the Mist Room & the Cool Room whilst there."
,,Orchids that never end,5.0,,The National Orchid Garden is within the Singapore Botanic Gardens and I have never seen so many glorious orchids. Be sure to allow ample time to experience the beauty of it all.

,,Colorful surprise,4.0,,All of us were excited to see the place as the photos we had seen were stunning. We happy to see the gardens were even better than the photos. So many colors ! Bright and beautiful orchids all around you.
,,Pretty,3.0,,I am not a massive lover of looking at flowers but if you need to kill an hour or so its worth a visit. It is in the botanical gardens but costs extra to get into.
,,Beyond expectations!,5.0,,Absolutely stunning. Make sure you go on a Saturday when they have free guided tours! And make sure you wear walking shoes. ... Cant wait to go back
,,Lovely show,4.0,,Its worth paying the few extra dollars to take the time to see the orchids. They are stunning and so many different types. Its bigger than people think as well.
,,Orchids to amaze,5.0,,"If you enjoy the looks of an orchid and want to see them in abundance and in their ""natural"" environment, then this is a must. As a person over 60 years old, I was given a senior citizen discount, so that it cost me 1 Singapore dollar (50p). For that I had unlimited time to wander round the paved areas between lush green vegetation that was liberally interspersed with orchids of various shapes and colours.
The layout was cleverly done so that either as ""clumps"", or individual settings, they made a visual impact. One major problem is the plethora of people with cameras who continually got in the way when you wanted to spend time viewing the magnificent blooms.
The location is well sign posted and there are various paths that can be navigated so as to ensure that all of the blooms can be viewed. If nothing else, the maintenance of the area is well worth seeing and reminding oneself what can be achieved with the energy and time to spare."
,,"what a great, refreshing surprise",5.0,,"it is beautiful, colorful and refreshing to visit. there are some many orchids and other beautiful plants,"
,,Pleasurable Experience with Lovely Orchids and Mother Nature,5.0,,"If you love orchids and nature, this is one of those ultimate places you have to include in your bucket list.

,,Blooming beautiful.,5.0,,"Had limited time so restricted our visit to the National Orchid Garden in the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Wonderful display. Go visit,"
,,SPECTACULAR,5.0,,"The only thing wrong with the Orchid Garden is that I couldn't bring them home with me and no matter how hard I try I can't grow orchids at home.
The flowers are so beautiful-if you don't get whats worth the fuss about orchids, come here and you will understand!!"
,,Green but hot and humid.,4.0,,"If you're into orchids then you'll like this. Has a good variety of different orchids of different colors. Good path and good scenery throughout. However it's hot and humid. The idea of walking around in a tropical garden in hot and humid weather was a good thing for me, but to some it can be quite enjoyable. Nevertheless, the garden is great and well taken of."
,,One of the best in the world,5.0,,"I have visited this garden many times, and it never ceases to amaze. There is such a large and varied selection of spectacular orchids, in an unbelievable range of colors and sizes. It is one of the most beautiful places to visit in Singapore. The Botanic Gardens in which the orchid garden is is also very enjoyable, but the highlight on the garden is the orchid collection. A must do!"

,,Amazing horticulture.,4.0,,"If orchids are your buzz, this will blow your mind. The effort to keep this place pristine is amazing. Worth a visit for sure."
,,Nice but not spectacular,3.0,,I was slightly disappointed at this exhibit. It was not very flowery and colorful as one would expect from a flower garden. There are more cactus then any other plant in my opinion. It may have been the time of the year that we went but next time in Singapore I plan on skipping this all together.
,,Beautiful orchids,3.0,,We had a good time walking and looking at all the different colorful orchids. The only problem was the exit signs were very vague.
,,Glorious colour and form,5.0,,"Even though you have to walk all around the orchid section of the Botanical gardens, it's well worth it. They are a riot of colour, set amongst tropical foliage. There are photo opportunities everywhere. We spent two hours taking photos and marvelling at the displays."
,,Orchard garden,5.0,,"Inside the botanical gardens such a beautiful clean place, walked through the grounds arrived at the orchard gardens with the Oyster card it was $3 or free if your over 60, a good day out"
,,Well Worth It,5.0,,It was a very hot & sultry day when I visited the Orchid Garden but I was amazed at the huge variety of orchids on display. Extremely colourful each array was labelled well for botanist and ordinary tourist alike to be well informed. Unfortunately there is nowhere to sit on one's perambulation around the Garden and so it can be very tiring in the heat. Nevertheless such an arrangement of so many orchids is important for any visitor.
,,Orchid Orchid Orchids only,4.0,,Nice and Huge collection of Orchids. Covered as part of City tour. Would have liked to cover as independent visit
,,Stunning flowers,5.0,,The price of admission is surprisingly cheap for Singapore and well worth it. The variety and quality of the orchids on display is mind blowing and you wonder how they keep them all in such prime condition.
,,Beautiful Orchids,5.0,,"We visited the botanical gardens and I love looking at flowers and colour so we paid the extra to visit the orchid garden.
It was really inexpensive and was not a disappointment. Beautiful displays, all clearly labelled, we enjoyed strolling around the gardens passing a happy hour or so taking in the beauty of nature."
,,Zillions of orchids,4.0,,The National Orchid Garden is a paid attraction within the Botanical Gardens. On display are TOO MANY varieties of orchids! Good for clicking pics. Worth the small entrance fee.The plants are so well maintained and healthy that they almost look artificial :P

,,Lovely Orchids & Flower Garden,5.0,,"I was with a group tour to visit the National orchid garden. The orchids with purple flowers were tall & lovely & healthy . They were planted along the sidewalks at an elevated location at about waistline height mixed with other green shrubs at the background. There was a round area full of water with a fountain & some black colored tall bird statues and some flowers & plants around the fountain. There were other orchid flowers in white & light lavender colors scattered along the sidewalks at an elevated location about 3 feet high. As I walked deeper inside the garden I saw long arches over the path with plants & shrubs growing on top of the arches that lined the sidewalks over the pathway. There were also more gardens with orchid flowers in lavender color, that lined the pathway. Having seen the lovely orchid flowers was worth the visit,& it was an enjoyable day.."
,,Excellent Orchids,5.0,,The sheer volume of orchids and people/countries they have been presented to is astonishing. A lovely afternoon walk around the gardens.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,This is easy a full day tour just walking around admiring the beauty that is everywhere. There is alot of walking but there also alot of places to rest. Its in my top 5 things to do in Singapore.
,,lovely - just thousands of orchids,5.0,,Beautiful orchid garden we wandered around for a while but then sadly deluge of rain! Not really somewhere to visit in the rain as only one or two shelters and need to be outside to see the plants. Eventually we gave up and headed back to the city. TIP : worth organising your travel arrangements. There is a taxi rank outside the botanic gardens but we had a long wait despite the light system which is supposed to call the taxis in from the road. Taxi pulls up and driver speaks to first person in queue but if they say too expensive drives off unless you are very quick to say you will have it - we joined forces with another couple in the queue to go back to the city and so were quite happy to pay for a 'luxury' taxi for the 4 of us whereas students at the front of the queue looking for budget fare.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Very pretty flowers. All kinds or orchids and other flowers. I would go back time and time again. It is a bit of a walk to get there but worth each step. Go there I am not a flower guy but it was with it.

Its part of a Botanical garden ,but you have to get ticket separately. Variety of orchids u will see and way they have been placed is really different from other botanical gardens I have visited."
,,Dont miss it!,5.0,,"Bring a camera and take 1 zillion photos! This place is magical whether u are a flower lover or not!

,,Lovely Orchids... You will appreciate flowers,5.0,,With a S$5 ticket you can enter the national Orchid Garden which is about 20 minutes walk through the Botanical Gardens. As you enter you will see a variety of Orchids across the trail to a misthouse which will lead you to a greenhouse of rain forest and then to the exit. Take a couple of hours in hand when you go to walk the entire place and take some lovely pictures. Avoid the rainy forecast.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Whilst this was absolutely beautiful it was a very hot humid day so take lots of water if you are going. There wasn't as many Orchids as we were hoping for but it was still beautiful and worth it.
,,I want more,4.0,,The orchids is lovely. Just want more specie on phalanossis. If added a lab for public to learnt seeding cultivate with a small sum will generally increase people interest. Good for photo taking. Good for orchids lover like me.
,,Hot walk in Singapore,4.0,,The orchid garden is situated on the far side of the botanical garden in reference to the SMRT station. It was 1.4 km away but the sign post so it was quite a walk. We were there 9am in the morning but we still worked up a good sweat!
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Set in a still traditional park, no hitech gizmos, just beautiful gardens, rolling lawns. The orchid garden displays plants in a very natural setting. Small entrance fee, but worth it."
,,Great display of Orchards,5.0,,"Impressive display of Orchids and well worth a visit suggest taking some protection against wet weather as it is easy to get caught between shelter if a downpour happens, Specialty Orchards particularly Kate & William Orchard very impressive."
,,"Great for photographers, but worth it for others, too",5.0,,"The orchid is Singapore's national flower, and you'll be hard pressed to find more of them in one place than here. The garden is very well kept-up, with constant attention by what appears to be a large staff. This garden is best seen on off-hours when hordes of tourists might be eating or elsewhere. Even so, it's large enough to accommodate many people. They also have a climate-controlled zone with special orchids and other unusual plants. It's about a 15-min walk from the main botanic-garden entrance to this garden, but the path is interesting in itself. The orchid garden is yet another nicely done attraction in Singapore."

You can get bus(or taxi) there."
,,A meaningful visit,5.0,,"We went there because of the Heritage Event and admission was free for Singaporean. This was the 4th visit by me and preciously I've brought overseas friends to this beautiful garden.

This garden is located in the midst of Singapore Botanic Garden which is free for visitors. It's a pity that many visitors decide to give it a miss visiting the National Orchid Garden because of the entrance fee.

My latest visit to the National Orchid Garden was very meaningful as we saw the two orchids that were named after our late Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his beloved wife Mdm Kwa Geok Choo.

I highly recommend those who loves nature to visit this place. The many varieties of orchid make the garden a worthwhile place to visit."

Here one will find a wide variety of beautiful Orchids from single flowers to enormous sprays which in full bloom are stunning. Take a camera with a good close-up setting and follow the recommended path for the disabled told to ensure you see everything. I'm not up on orchid cultivation, but if there is a time of year when orchids are not in flower, then these gardens would be quite bare.
A generous Seniors Discount is provided for those over 60."

,,Orchids Galore,4.0,,"If you're already planning to visit the Botanic Gardens, don't forget to include the National Orchid Garden too! You'll see orchids of all kinds, named after influential people around the world, award winning breeds, etc. Simply amazing! Entry fee of just $5 for hours worth of beautiful and unique orchids is totally worth it. The place can get kind of confusing to get around even with the map though. But if you just stick to a path all the way without detouring, shouldn't be a problem."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"We spent a half day here. It was pleasant walking between the various areas and displays.

If you go to the Botanical Gardens, it is well worth the price.

,,Beautiful - maybe seasonal,5.0,,"The botanic gardens in which the orchid garden resides are lovely. The orchid garden was beautiful but only about 15-20% of the plants were blooming. The mist-house / hut was full of gorgeous flowers. Not sure if the rest of the exposed grounds have a ""high season"" for blooms or it it's more of a rotating garden where only a small portion blooms at any one time. Well worth visiting in any case. Nice gift shop too."
,,Beautiful display of orchids,5.0,,This is well worth a visit. There are a huge range of orchids to be seen. Some growing outdoors others in glasshouses. This one on the the stops on the hop on hop off bus and by taxi so easily accessible. The garden is within the botanic gardens.

It rained while we were there this time, but there are a number of shelters you can jump in to and stay dry. Highly recommended!"
,,Amazing! and worth the $5,5.0,,"This was a highlight of our 3 day trip to Singapore. The flowers and grounds are beautiful and there is a variety of flowers and environments for enjoyment. It took us about 45 minutes, but, you could see the place in as little as 30 minutes or linger for a couple of hours. Take some water with you as it is hot and humid. Worth seeing."
,,Lots of orchids. Lots of them.,4.0,,"So many orchids! If you have the time, come to the garden and take a look at all the pretty flowers. You can see how some were created and were named after various influential/famous people in the world. It is a pretty big place, so budget a few hours to get to every section."
,,Absolutely delightful,5.0,,This was a return visit to Singapore and to the National Orchid Garden . The whole garden is beautiful . I'm amazed at the different types and colours .

Breathtaking view and the colors bring life into a boring day, it was drizzling when I visited but it was worth it. I bought my mom a pendant with a real orchid in it and she never takes it off :D Who doesn't want something real,,,well other than gold. Absolutely amazing flowers planted strategically from their history, discovery and type. Loved it."
,,Great park and small fee for Orchid Garden,5.0,,It really was a huge park with lots to see in terms of gardens. The orchid section had a small fee but was well worth it. If you are up for a lot of walking this is a great choice.

,,Beautiful but with biting insects!,5.0,,The orchid garden is fantastic and I loved every moment... I think that I took a picture of every flower in the park. The cool house is a good place go if you're getting overheated; it is full of Alpine plants. The orchid garden was a bargain at $5 a person.
,,Beautiful Garden,4.0,,"The garden divided to 2, free and buy a ticket. For free entrance, we can gather with family, just sitting or enjoy the beautiful scenery surrounding us.

,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Amazing orchids in the botanical gardens. Never seen anything like it ANYWHERE ... BeUtiful colours so vibrant beautiful atoms
,,Beautiful world away from the city,5.0,,"National Orchid garden is located inside the huge Botanical Gardens of Singapore. After getting down at the Botanic Gardens MRT station, you can enter through the adjacent gate. Botanic Gardens are huge and every path looks utterly beautiful and adventurous. But if you don't want to get lost and miss the famed orchid garden, follow the signs and walk through the dense green landscape enjoying every plant and tree. There is a marginal fee of 1 dollar at the orchid garden gate but it is free to enter after 5-6 pm. However, I would highly recommend to visit while there is still daylight since you cannot find many people inside the garden and it is easy to get lost when it gets dark with almost no artificial lighting. Apart from a variety of orchids, there is VIP garden with hybrid varieties, a small water fountain and a lovely tree on which you can etch. Moving forward there are wooden bridge walkways with dense greenhouses full of mist. As you explore further, the place gives you a hint of being in an orchid forest. It is commendable how everything is maintained in its natural form. It is metaphorically a place to lose your way and absorb the nature at its very raw. It is an experience as well as an adventure when you surround yourself with one of the most beautiful flowers in the world in a complete natural setting. However, make sure you make your way out before it gets too dark. Amazing place for nature-lovers and photography enthusiasts."
,,very nice - a must see,5.0,,"The Botanic Garden is free but this Orchid Garden costs a fee to enter ($5). Please bring your IDs - with a student ID or your passport showing you over 60, you pay only $1 to enter. This attraction is the only place I see in Singapore that extends the senior discount to non-resident. (Most senior discount is only for the locals.) You can walk around for hours and enjoy the garden."
,,Green World,5.0,,"If you want to see Mediterranean plants and flowers as well as those from the Americas and Austral-Asia and Africa, you can find them all in one place. This is it!! Really beautiful... Don't go on a weekend though!!"
,,Beautiful Garden with a big array of Orchids,5.0,,"It is my feeling that this is one attraction of singzpore which usually is not a part of the program of people visiting Singapore, which actually gives them a big miss. National Orchid garden is a part of Botanical Gardens and absolutely beautiful. The Botanical gardens are beautifully landscaped filled with lush greenery. In the short time that we had , we were able to visit the swan lake, foliage garden, rain forest symphony theater and lake alongwith the Orchid Gardens. Another plus wiht it is that the Botanical gardens are absolutely free of cost and for Orchid Gardens you have to pay a small amount of SGD 5, but trust me it is worth much much more than that.
There are hundreds of varieties of orchids which in itself is mind boggeling. The mist house is very beautiful. There are phot points from where you can take stunning photos with beautiful orchids in background.
The best time to visit is early morning or atleast the earlier part of the afternoon. Carry enough water as it gets humid. Wear light wear as walking is required. Carry umbrella as it may rain.
Botanical Garden is exactly in front of the Botanical Garden MRT station so locating it will not be a problem."
,,Spectacular & Accessible,5.0,,"Brought my in-laws here on their recent visit to Singapore. We drove up to the new Tyrersall Road entrance and dropped them off and then parked right nearby in a new small lot, but you could easily cab. The Orchid Garden is very close to that entrance. There is a small nominal fee for non-residents to enter the Orchid Garden. Covered benches are available to get out of the sun and/or rain, and there are multiple paths and short-cuts if one person wants to sit and enjoy while others continue to explore. The path is smooth and wide for the less sure-footed. Flowers are stunning. Highly recommend for everyone, but especially if you have mobility or heat concerns but want to see a bit of the garden."
,,fabulous orchids,5.0,,"Singapore is famous for orchids, and this is the place to see them. Mostly hybrids arranged in designed masses, although there is a nice cool house that is a bit more natural."
,,Don't miss it!,5.0,,"I hesitated to buy tickets to the garden, but am thankful that we went. The surrounding park is quite beautiful and worth a stroll through, but the orchid gardens were extraordinary. The pathways through the garden were lined with countless varieties of orchids, which are beautifully displayed and cultivated. Well worth the visit (and the entrance fee)."
,,Best place for flower lovers,4.0,,Best place for flower lovers . Best time to go at 4pm +. Worth a visit if you have lot of time in the trip. Lot of flowers type.
,,Just Beautiful,5.0,,"Located within the Botanical gardens the orchid garden is a must, there is a charge I Paid just 1 sgd. as a senior which must be the best value on the island. The variety and beauty of the orchids plus the many photo opportunities is a must for all. Ensure you take a hat and water it can be quite tiring."
,,"Worth a visit, but one has to like flowers to enjoy it",4.0,,"Firstly the entrance fee, $5 per adult and $1 for concessions. This is not bad value for money. Many places in UK have outrageous prices. It was a hot and sunny day as usual. Flowers were plentiful. Did not explore every corner but saw enough orchids in various settings. Europhiles probably would need 2 days as it was too hot to stay around and do the place in one hit."

There's eating places and great areas to take photos. This place is clean and well maintain and should be visited you won't be disappointed
,,Beautifully maintained,4.0,,"Located within the botanical gardens but has its own $5 entry fee.

If you like orchids then the entry fee is very reasonable.

Lots of amazing specimens and beautiful photo opportunities.

Not just limited to orchids.

It was noticeable that the most impressive orchids were in pots (albeit well hidden) with many of the large specimens in the beds not in flower, but that may reflects the time of year or the natural tendancy of mature orchid plants not to constantly flower...

Well worth a visit alongside a stroll in the botanical gardens (and the rainforest walk just next to the orchid garden entrance)."

They are truly beautiful."
,,Perfect for a Stroll,4.0,,The National Orchid Garden is part of the National Botanic Gardens. The Orchid Garden is closer to the Hop On Hop Off Bus Stop than it is to the MRT station. However it is a pleasant walk from either entrance to the Orchid Garden. There is a small entrance fee to enter the Orchid Garden. We have visited this garden at different times of the year and so have seen a variety of orchids in bloom. Some orchids are displayed in a glasshouse.

,,The Best Orchids I Have Seen In My Life.....!,5.0,,"Do visit it, a fantastic place for a walk, I would recommend it to anyone who is passionate about orchids. A place you can't afford to miss."
,,A real delight and must see!,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden situated in the Botanical Gardens was not only beautiful but also surprising and very interesting. From the moment you walk through the doors (S$5 entry charge) you see the most fabulous water fountain surrounded by orchids as far as the eye can see. Of course there are the usual Vanda orchids however I was blown away with not only the amount of orchids on display...all flowering, but also the number of exotic species.
I went on a Tuesday and there were a few people there, including what appeared to be a tour group, but they did not impede on my experience at all. Most of my photos had no people in them so that gives you a bit of an idea of the capacity of the gardens. The area is so large that you can find a shaded corner somewhere and just relax...keeping in mind you are in Singapore and it's always hot outdoors. I was very surprised to get to the Cold House and it was empty for at least 10 minutes!
A must see is The Mist House (which is not far from the Cold House) which is literally filled with award winning orchid specimens from around the globe - honestly it was so beautiful and I could have spent more time in there. Also nice to see is the VIP collection located near Burkill Hall.
At the end of the garden is a gift store (of course!) but I must say it was a very well appointed with good quality souvenirs including the lovely brand Risis which takes real orchids (various different specimens) and plates them in 24 carat gold or in silver if you prefer. Every piece is individual and for S$70, I had to have one. They also sell them at the larger gift store near the Botanic Gardens entrance/exit. All in all I spent approx 2 1/2 hours in the National Orchid Garden. I love photography and I took over 500 photos. Of course you could spend a lot less time in there, but don't underestimate the time it will take to see what appears to be a very small part if the Botanic Gardens map. Enjoy!"
,,Beautiful orchids,5.0,,"Admission is free but you have to pay to enter the Orchid gardens. Well worth it. Pleasant gardens, an hour will suffice but you could spend much longer there."
,,Very exotic,5.0,,"Great place to explore and unwind,check out all the trees and species while having little picnic in the park.Might have company of mid size lizard while eating your food but this new and fun experience.Go check it out,it's worth it!!!!!"

,,Lovely Botanic Gardens,4.0,,"The Botanic Gardens and the National Orchid Garden inside are both lovely (the gardens are free to enter, but a small charge for the Orchid Garden). I spent about 5 hours in the Gardens, just wandering around, about an hour in the Orchid Garden. A friend recently asked me if I had limited time would I go to the Orchid Garden or Gardens by the Bay, my choice would be Gardens by the Bay, but the Orchid Gardens were still lovely, especially if you are a keen Orchid grower."

It is not expensive to enter and while i am not a huge fan of flower gazing i did appreciate the work and the effort to represent so many varieties of orchids and is well worth the visit. Just a heads up it is a lot bigger than our family expected and you will spend more time inside than you may have expected. It can be a walk that takes more out of you than a casual stroll.
enjoy"
,,Great experience,5.0,,The botanic gardens and the orchid enclosure are very special . I live nearby and never tire of walking there. One thing to remember when visiting us to check the closing times of the orchid garden and children's garden.

,,For the love of Orchids,4.0,,"This lovely garden lies within the Singapore Botanical Gardens. The species on display offer are carefully sorted into four different colour zones.

,,Spectacular. Better maps and signs would have helped.,5.0,,"Even flower-lovers may get exhausted by the incredible display of orchids - easily the most we have ever seen in one place. Maps did not help us get around this labyrinth, so don't miss the mist dome. The garden full of orchids named for famous visitors are a gimmick you can skip. The nearby ginger garden is also worth a visit. Gift shop was not particularly exciting and staff there were mostly unhelpful and bored."

We saw lots of people walking their dogs or jogging/exercising outside the Orchid Garden.

Make sure to bring something to drink and a snack for the visit. There was a lot of walking, and with the heat even in the morning, it can be quite exhausting. No concessions inside the Orchid Garden, and we spent about 2 hours seeing the various plants. We were there from 10am to around 12.30pm, and then took the MRT to Orchard Road Station to have lunch.

There is a restroom with limited stalls at the entrance/exit by the Gift Shop, and we did not see any other restroom facility inside the Orchid Garden. We visited during one of the Singapore school holidays and there was a long line at the end of our tour, waiting to use the restroom. We had to walk further, about 15-20 minutes that is still within the Singapore Botanical Gardens to find another restroom which was by a food court that was not as crowded."

The mist garden has a great collection and I took some wonderful close up photos of the orchids. The cool garden has orchids that grow in mountainous regions but not as colourful.

The signs have a lot of interesting information about the flowers and garden and the paths are lovely to walk. Bring good walking shoes, water and sunscreen. And of course, your camera.

Recommend taking the bus to the garden (or at least back). Taxis were hard to get. Orchid Road is not far so you can walk to a taxi stand by the shopping or hotels."
,,Absolutely incredible garden!,4.0,,"For sure, one of the best orchid gardens in the world. Even when visiting in low season it's full of beautiful blossoms and outgoing works to keep it as bautiful as it should be. Also very nice is the colder mountain glashouse with a bit lower temperature and probably even higher humidity.
Only small negative point for the door-rim of the gazebo that is not painted / provided with (yellow) stripes as it should be so that many higher people get hurt by hitting the rim with their head - so be careful ;-)"

Within this is the National orchid garden. Sure you see countless varieties of orchid species, all beautifully flowering, colorful and long lasting. I found it a bit cramped with tourists/visitors at your elbow taking photos photos photos. Their noisiness mars the experience of quietly admiring the blooms and blossoms that I find especially in Japan.
The gardens are big so could It be better to spread this garden of orchids over a much bigger space, more along a nature walking trail than a crushing outdoor exhibit space?
The facts presented are interesting, the blooms are beautiful no doubt but it may be the least pleasant part of the park?"
,,An amazing variety of orchids,5.0,,"Located inside the Botanic Gardens, the Orchid Garden is a leisurely walk from the front entrance. Although the Botanic Gardens are free, there is an entrance fee for the Orchid Garden. Most definitely worth the price of admission. Many varities on display, most in a natural setting.

,,"The best description is ""Breathtaking""",5.0,,"We saved this tour for the last of three days we had in Singapore and it was the perfect encore to our visit.

It was very easy to reach from the recently completed Blue Line of the SMRT subway system but from the station to the Orchid Gardens required a 1.4 km walk through the Singapore Botanical Gardens, oh darn!

We enjoyed our traverse through the main gardens but the Orchid section was our target for the day. The presentation, variety, and maintenance of the Orchid Gardens were all superb. While we are not experts in orchids, we still felt the varieties in bloom were amazing and our viewing rapidly approached sensory overload, not to mention taking up quite a few MB on our camera SD cards!

There were several teams of workers seen throughout cleaning and manicuring the gardens which were impeccably maintained. The use of water features and mixed hardscape were most attractive.

These were among the most enjoyable flower gardens we have seen anywhere in the world made even better by the fact that the $8.00 admission charge was reduce to $1.00 for seniors!"

,,Must visit - beauty of Orchids thru the year,5.0,,"One of my favorite places in Singapore - the Orchid Garden. A place which has been visited by many world leaders and we even have some hybrids named after these leaders.

It is difficult to remember which colour you have already taken. There is no time limit to your visit, so you can snap away and relax on the many seats that are there for the public."
,,A Beautiful Garden,5.0,,"We have visited the Botanic Gardens in Singapore a number of times but never been into the National Orchid Garden. A couple of Saturday's ago we enjoyed breakfast in one of the restaurants and then ventured up to the Orchid Garden for a look. The $5 entry fee seemed incidental and we were happy to help fund what we were about to see. Our walk through this magnificent place was something to remember. The variety of species is amazing and the various attractions including the list of luminaries and national heads of government in Burkill Hall gives one an insight into what a famous place we were in. The Mist House and the Cool House provide examples of the variety of places orchids grow and prosper.

This place should be on your list of places to see if you are visiting Singapore and if you live in Singapore and haven't been, do yourself a favour and visit."
,,Definitely worth a visit as part of Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden costs SG$5 per adult to enter and I'd highly recommend a visit if you go to the Singapore Botanic Gardens. There are orchids galore! I had no idea there were so many different types and the colours are beautiful.

We also enjoyed looking at the VIP and Celebrity parts where orchids that have been named after foreign dignitaries or celebrities are planted."
,,Amazing orchids!,5.0,,The orchid garden is such a beautiful place to visit if you love orchids. MRT quite a walk to the garden (about 2kms) so you are better off getting a taxi to the closest gate which is about 400m away. Everybody should put it on their must visit list in Singapore.
,,Something to be proud of,5.0,,"Singapore can be very proud of their Orchid Garden which is really very beautiful and artistically laid out. In fact the entire Botanic Garden is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is so lush and tropical; a true delight to wander through. Yes, it is hot, so I would advise going early in the morning and wear a hat. I went on a Saturday morning when they have guided tours. Our guide was very knowledgeable and I learned a lot! I think the weekends are probably a lot busier as there were quite a few people there. If you love plants and orchids this is a must see. The gift shop is very nice. There are restaurants and places to buy a drinks."

,,Highest concentration of orchids in one spot!,4.0,,"Wonderful area if you are in the least interested in orchids. They grow there in the wild (well sort of - they are of course carefully cultivated, but no fancy hothouse or roofing!) in a way that any orchid lover will firstly drool over and lament as to why he cannot achieve the same at home!"
,,Hot and busy but worth it.,5.0,,"Walk to the far end where there is a greenhouse and some special 'rare type' enclosures away from the crowds. The gift shop is not bad, but there's a bigger better one a little way back into the gardens."

,,The No1 Attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"We could have spent a full day in here just wandering around, its so lush, lovely and colourful. The Orchid garden has a small entry fee, while the surrounding Botanic.al Gardens are free. Plan to spend at least a day in the gardens overall"

We strolle from the MRT end to the Orchard Road end in about 3 hours with breaks to cool down. The National Orchid Garden is really the cream - and so cheap for both local and foreign pensioners ($1). Even at $5 for everyone else it is worth it if you like flowers and orchids in particular.
,,So Much Variety!,5.0,,We stopped off the Hop On/Hop Off bus to see the Orchids. There are a great variety of orchids -amazing colors as well as all sizes. Does not take long to take a look or you can spend several hours. The Orchid Garden is within a beautiful park which is also worth a short walk through.

The different areas of planting are fully labelled and grouped into types. You could spend hours here and not cover it all. Food near the Orchid a Garden is expensive and crowded so go to the other food court. There are sign posts and paths everywhere to help you get about. The Orchid garden itself is enormous and stocked with a hinge variety of plants. If your a fan, allow plenty of time to take photos. Advice, walk to the Orchid garden first and then see how much energy to have for the rest."

There is an MRT station at one of the gates so a walk through the garden to the Orchid Garden is very pleasant. There is a $5 charge ($1 for over 60's) and then you can wander the orchid displays. It will take between 30 and 60 minutes depending on how long you want to study the plants. Not all plants will be in flower but there is sufficient here to interest most people.

The shop was well filled with orchid-related souvenirs and some really beautiful post-cards which we ended up buying.

So although the Botanic Gardens are free, there is a small charge for entry to the Orchid Garden (I think it was probaby S$5 or something like that). Well worth it, don't forget your camera."

,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"Great garden within the botanical garden. Within easy reach. There is an small entrance fee for the National Orchid Garden, no fee for the botanical garden. The grounds are perfectly maintained and each time I come back to Singapore I come here for a visit."
,,Just beautiful and calm,5.0,,"If you like gardening or just looking at gorgeous flowers, then the National Orchid Garden in Singapore is well worth a visit.

We didn't know we were going as we had booked a city tour through our hotel and it was included. Only $5 to go in though but a nice extra to the tour. The orchid garden is within the botanical gardens. Very well set out with clear paths to follow so you cannot damage any of the beautiful, delicate flowers. And they are glorious :) Such varieties of a plant that I can never keep alive at home!

Lovely little shop at the exit (when is there not a little shop?!) with some nice flower themed gifts. Well worth a visit."
,,The most colourful garden,5.0,,I recomended this garden with all my heart. I have never seen before so many orchids at the same place so different And so beautiful. U can also visit a rain forest And feel in a middle of a jungle
,,MUST SEE,5.0,,loved this garden the most!!! it was amazing and worth 5$ there are water faountains inside to drink from and a cool room with lots of shade
,,Lovely orchids,5.0,,This is a nice garden with a good collection of Orchids. It is also maintained very well and is a good place to spend time as tourist.
,,A Great Garden!,5.0,,This is one of Singapore's premier experiences...a must see. Easily reached by MRT or taxi. I suppose bus service is also available.
,,Awesome place not to be missed !!!,5.0,,It is a must go place in singapore. You cannot see all varieties of orchids anywhere else. The garden is well maintained and entry fee is very less compared to other attractions.
,,"Average, do visit only when there for the sake of being there",3.0,,"Frankly, I'd say, the orchids are far and few. Its more like a walk in the garden. While the S$5 entrance fee is affordable to many, I feel its not worth it.

I have no idea why this garden is selected and awarded as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There ain't anything historical about it (for Christ sake, anything around can be 150 years old). I am rather disappointed at this ranking/award by UNESCO as it is very misleading.

As compared to Phuket Orchid Farm, National Orchid Garden is just 1/4 of what the former have to offer.

My take, visit only when you have the time. Its not exactly conveniently located (yes, there is a train but its 1.5km to the nearest entrance)."
,,I live in Singapore .....,5.0,,"I live in Singapore and this is my favourite, favourite place. We have many visitors (spare room occupancy rate is circa 60%) and first time visitors always have this put high on their itinerary.

Regardless of age, professed interests or gender people love this place. And what is not to love? Walking among fabulously well tended gardens with spectacular flower displays year round, an appreciation of Singapore's orchid led diplomacy, up close to an historical building are all experiences to be had.

Even on crowded days (lose the bus tour crowd asap by slipping off the main path) there is so much to be appreciated and to be soothed by. Then outside, the gardens - just wonderful to walk through.

Couple of practical tips:
- if you are short of time, have the taxi driver drop you at the nearest gate (he will know it!) see the Orchid Gardens and save the rest for another time
- a cool drink can be had in lovely tropical surrounds as well as a good meal at The Halia just by the Orchid Gardens
- The Orchid Gardens close earlier but the the Botanic Gardens in which they are located are open until (I think) midnight. Safe as houses to walk and achingly romantic
- if you are 60 or over, confess and they let you in for less!

Gardens by the Bay is the flashy new kid on the block - the real thing is here!"

,,Great garden! Great price!,5.0,,Awesome place to take an hour of in this always active city! Awesome especially for photographers. Though you shouldn't forget to bring a plastic bag in case it rains.
,,Fabulous for the orchid enthusiast.,5.0,,"Stunning orchids everywhere! Jealousy rapidly set in as I walked through the front door and it only intensified as I walked, very slowly, amidst all these beauties.

I would recommend that you get a taxi there rather than as part of a tour - simply because tours don't stop there for long enough. Tour East stopped there for half an hour, not nearly long enough to see other areas of these gardens"
,,My Wifes favourite,5.0,,"These gardens are part of a much bigger area of tropical gardens, the orchids were varied and well looked after my only criticism is that there were too many garden staff pruning and clearing up, almost as soon as a leaf became discoloured it was removed."
,,A must see attraction in Singapore,5.0,,This was one place in Singapore that will bring you peace and serenity from the city life. Breathtaking landscapes and greenery that will amaze you. The orchid gardens are very beautiful too. Great place to visit for the day! Highly recommend to all you nature lovers.
,,An Oasis in a Busy City,5.0,,"Really enjoyed our walk around the National Orchid Gardens, at every turn there are photo opportunities and some splendid souvenirs in the shop at the exit. We took a taxis there as we weren’t sure as to how far the nearest MRT was, well worth it."
,,Do Not Miss,5.0,,"The National Orchard gardens is located within the Singapore Botanic gardens - and are a must for any visit to Singapore. There is a $SG 5 entry fee to the Orchid gardens.

The Orchid gardens are located within the Singapore Botanic Gardens - but beware they a located in the middle of the gardens. The closest metro station is Botanic gardens on the Circle/Downtown lines. From here it is 1.7 km walk to the Orchid Gardens.

From the main entrance (Newton rd entrance) it is a 1.3km walk to the the Orchid Gardens - so in all expect a minimum 3 km walk as well the walk around the Orchid gardens

The vast array of orchids are truly amazing and spectacular - don' forget to visit the COOL ROOM for cool climate plants, the orchids named after dignitaries, the golden showers arches.

You will not be disappointed in a visit to the Orchid gardens - just be aware that there is a long walk to get there"
,,Worth paying the extra,5.0,,"The botanic gardens are free apart from this small area, but it's definitely worth paying to go in. Every conceivable type of orchid is on display, and they are immaculately looked after so you can really see them at there best (unless we were just lucky). Some are stunning in their beauty. The VIP section has specially bred hybrids named in honour of world leaders. A great morning out."
,,Amazingly Beautiful,5.0,,"We had visited the Botanic a number of times, but we were never on time to visit the NOG. this time we were lucky and got in there!
very well laid out, clean and breath takingly beautiful, with extremely nice arrangements and beautifully flowing pathways that take you to the different sections.
we bought some nice souvenirs from the shop at the entrance.

I highly recommend this place for relaxation and for plant lovers.

I had visited the Gardens By The Bay, but this place has more charm. I could visit this place over and over!"
,,Fantastic flowers,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens, wonderful in themselves, are free, so pay a small sum to visit the Orchid gardens. You will be impressed!"
,,Garden is Ok to visit,3.0,,It's located inside the Botanical Garden. National Orchid garden is simple with beautiful orchid flowers. I didn't enjoy this place much as I wasn't interested to see species of flowers. I recommend this place who loves plants and flowers. To enter this garden you need to pay but entry in Botanic garden is free.
,,So pretty,5.0,,"Such a beautiful garden to visit. The colours are gorgeous and fantastic photo opportunities if you are into photography and flowers. The variety of orchids here are phenomenal, never seen anything like it. Even if you are not into flowers, this garden is definitely worth a visit if you have the time in Singapore."
,,Excellent! Can't miss,5.0,,"A trip to Singapore would not be complete without a trip to the Orchid Garden. I think they must have every orchid species represented. The paths are well paved and there are signs all through the garden pointing you to your next stop. There are also maps available to guide you through. There are signs for areas that would make for good photo-ops.
The attached gift show is well stocked with orchid souvenirs. One way to make it better would be to provide a little more information about orchids themselves and maybe the history about the orchid garden itself."
,,Good spot,4.0,,What a lovely spot to enjoy beautiful nature here. Although in the rain but we still love this. Highly recommend you!
,,Garden for Plant Lovers,4.0,,The National Orchid Garden has a wide variety of orchids on display. Many of which were named after famous politicians and celebrities. Worth a visit for plant lovers who enjoy looking at flowers. There are also pitcher plants available within the garden.
,,Must go in and enjoy the beautiful of Orchid.,5.0,,"So beautiful Orchird. Entrance must pay about some S$. Here have plenty of Orchird. And all the Orchird are export , make the Income for Singapore more than 60m/ per years. If you are the one love flowers don't miss it."
,,Truly amazing orchids.,5.0,,Worth the visit and humidity to see the amazing displays and read about the history of the species. Although popular with tour groups it is easy to find space e to view the plants. Well located within the botanic gardens.
,,Lovely!,5.0,,"Inexpensive and worth every cent!

I had planned to spend an afternoon here but my errands took longer than expected. I only had an hour but could've spent much longer exploring the trails. Everything is well laid out with signs detailing the various orchids and other plants, trees, etc. They also have spots specifically marked as photo opportunities (Beware the selfie sticks!)

The staff I encountered were very friendly and helpful. The entire area is handicap-accessible and there are a few hills but nothing too steep.

I hope to return to Singapore one day and, if so, I will visit again!"
,,Excellent and fantastic value,5.0,,"Best Orchid Garden I've ever been to and for $1 all over 60s and students, adults $5. Spent several hours in the Orchid garden alone as there was just do much to see and beautifully laid out. Good labelling and lots of gardeners about keeping the place pristine. There was so much colour everywhere so don't think you need to be an Orchid buff. The size and design of this garden alone makes it well worth visiting. Being set in the Botanical Garden it took me the rest of the day to see most of it. You can walk for miles, a tour bus/ noddy train would have been good for my aching feet. My number one in Singapore."
,,Cool place to visit -- if you are into flowers,4.0,,Really easy to get there -- just go with the metro to the National Orchid station. The place is big and you could easily wonder off for an hour without noticing. And the name of the place isn't misleading -- you will see a lot of orchids... The price of admission of $5SG is very reasonable especially for Singapore.
,,Amazing collection of Orchids,5.0,,"It's the world's most extensive collection of Orchids I believe. Like most attractions in Singapore it's well organised, clean and detailed. I don't know much about Orchids but this was an interesting and enjoyable experience regardless. It's obvious that a huge amount of work goes into making this such an attractive exhibit and the Garden is rightfully famous. The kids will probably get bored but there's enough room for them to run around."
,,A lovely afternoon spent with my Mum,5.0,,"On my Mum's last days here in Singapore I decided that the botanics, and more importantly the National Orchid Garden would be some of the places we would visit. And we weren't disappointed. How beautiful is this place? Then for S$5 you can go and see some of the most beautiful orchids ever.
I grow orchids, and have given some to my Mum in the past, so this was a special treat for both of us...go, you will not be disappointed. You can also buy some to take home. The UK should let them in as they were grown in sterilised flasks and as such are allowed in."
,,Natural beauty at it's best!,5.0,,"a wonderful place to visit whether you have a whole day to spare or a few free hours. The Orchid Gardens are located inside the Botanical Gardens. There is a couple of eateries near the Orchid Garden, or you can take a picnic lunch, and a couple of lovely gift shops with a range of gifts you won't find elsewhere. The Botanic Gardens are easy to get on public transport with its very on MRT stop.

There is an amazing array of orchids, beautiful colours, you can't help but take what feels like a thousand photographs in a bid to capture their exotic beauty."
,,Beautiful orchards,5.0,,These gardens are amongst the best gardens I have ever visited. The beautiful orchards are set in a lovely garden in the centre of the botanic gardens and are a must to visit....spectacular
,,there is very beautiful,5.0,,i recomment to see there and you can go there with metro.this garden is very beautiful.you can go with your family for relaxing .
,,All natural,5.0,,"The gardens are a must visit site. They are filled with flowers and you can go at your own pace taking different routs. You can visit the route you are most interested in, or you can do them all. There is also the souvenir shop which we absolutely loved, they have all kinds of tea that you can buy. If you visit I encourage you to try and buy tea, they are too good!!!"
,,Beautiful Orchids,5.0,,Orchid gardens are beautiful and exquisite collection of orchid from all over the world. It surprising to see hybrid orchids named after famous celebrities of the world. Cold house was also exciting attraction and was amazed at maintainance of the park. they charge SGD 5 for visit but its all worth it.
,,Avoid going on sunny days,3.0,,We went there at around 10.30 Am and it was humid and hot. We just clicked few pictures and came back. Best time to visit is in the evening. Nothing much to do if you are not interested in Botany.
,,Definitely worth a visit!,4.0,,So many beautiful orchids it's definitely worth the small entry fee! Many beautiful photo opportunities! Took us maybe an hour to get through but could take longer depending on how many photo's you take etc.
,,Nice but there are so many other parks.,4.0,,The experience was nice but there are so many park. The amazing thing about this was that they had replanted Orchids lost to the world because of development. And they have some amazing hybrids to try... Lady Diana! and more.
,,Fascinating,5.0,,Just impossible to describe in terms that give enough praise. Fascinating! A most beautiful collection and showcase of orchids.
,,Amazing Orchids,5.0,,"Botanical Gardens can be a full day out. So much to see, and great walking to be had in such peace and quiet after the busy Orchard Road area. Orchids are Truly Amazing in there,"
,,Green and beautiful!!,5.0,,Visiting the Singapore Botanic Gardens and National Orchid Garden is a wonderful (but hot) way to spend a day. Just hydrate and make sure you bring a camera.
,,"""Wonderful""",5.0,,This is a nice garden within Singapore Botanical Garden. Entry fee of S$5 (S$1 for students and Seniors) is not a big deal to see beautiful orchids. Cool atmosphere will make you stay there for quite some time.Very well maintained.We love Orchid Garden.
,,Lovely Flowers & Landscaping,5.0,,"One of the most beautiful garden I visited .
Our Family enjoyed each and every place inside the Garden. Every turn has a more beautiful view than the previous one and one cannot stop from capturing those moments with camera. Rare species of flowers, trees and plants. Must Visit place in Singapore."
,,Lovely walk,5.0,,"Within the Botanic Gardens, this was the only part with an entry fee (just $5). Worth having a look. The VIP and celebrity gardens are interesting ideas too!"
,,Best band for a buck in Singapore,5.0,,"When you find an activity that will keep you fascinated for several hours and only costs $1 for seniors and $5 for visitors you have discovered a gem. Easily accessible by the hop on hop off buses or the MRT, Orchardor Botanic Gardens stop. it is easy to get there. Open from 8:30 to 7 pm daily. The orchid gardens cover a vast area with over 1000 species and 2000 hybrids.
Camera enthusiasts will be in heaven and beginners will get a chance to try some macro photography (close ups)."
,,No visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to the Bottanical Gardens and the National Orchid Garden inside it...,5.0,,You have to visit and see it for yourself to appreciate the beauty and the wealth of this horticultural paradise. I don't think anybody can truly appreciate what an Orchid is until they have been to the Orchid Garden in Singapore...
,,Best orchids we have every seen anywhere,5.0,,"We spent over 3 hours just in this small part of the Botanic Gardens. Be prepared to be amazed by the diversity and color of the flowers. Also be prepared to sweat a lot. Orchids don't grow outside in cold places. Every other orchid garden fades into insignificance compared to this one. If you are age 60 or over admission is SG$1, otherwise SG$5."
,,A must visit when in Singapore,4.0,,They went to great lengths to build something amazing to see. It's free to enter although there are some paid areas.
,,Wonderful for Orchid Lovers,5.0,,The orchid garden displays orchids in their natural habitat. It also has a VIP garden with orchids named for visiting dignitaries--quite interesting. The initial building has a fascinating display of how the gardens propagate orchids. Do buy one of the gold-plated real orchids--beautiful.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,It's amazing and very beautiful sights All over. The richness in colors makes you happy and I would to import seertal plants to my garden ☺
,,Beautiful flowers,4.0,,Lots of orchids in picturesque setting. Very hot to walk around though. Costs 5 st for entry but concessions are available. Take an umbrella!!
,,Beautiful orchid ambiance amid the larger Botanical Gardens,4.0,,"Loved the orchid gardens - all the flowers, walkways, etc. where extremely well kept and photo worthy. The cool house was a little disappointing in terms of variety or a ""wow"" factor. Has a great restaurant for a quick bite as well."
,,The Place to go for Orchid Fans,5.0,,"Second time we have visited, last time was 5 years ago. Still as good as we remembered it. The place to go if you love Orchids."
,,Good for running or loving,4.0,,A haven of peace and tranquillity. Very well maintained. Had a mix of tall trees shrubs and different palms. Very nice photo stops. Be prepared to spend the whole day.
,,If you like orchids don't miss,5.0,,"We caught the train to the Singapore Botanic Gardens MRT station which is right next to the Bukit Timah entrance to the gardens (free entry). We walked through the gardens, very pretty with lots of displays. Then into to the Orchid Gardens $5 entry and $1 for seniors. If you like flowers don't miss this - fantastic display. You could easily spend a couple of hours alone in the Orchid Gardens. All the gardens are well kept, lovely gift shops, places to stop and rests - would highly recommend. We left via the Clooney Road exit so virtually walked the full length of the gardens, turn left and cross the road and there is a bus that takes you to the MRT at Orchard Road."
,,Brillient!,5.0,,"Highlight of our visit to Singapore, only $1 Singapore for over 60s. Fabulous seeing orchid in their native environment and seeing the specialy named varieties."

,,Orchids Everywhere,5.0,,"Definitely pay the small fee and visit the National Orchid Garden inside the Singapore Botanical Gardens. Orchids of all forms, colours and size and a flower photographer's delight. Don't miss the specially-bred orchids named for special visitors to the Garden - it's through and behind the lovely old house that used to house the director of the garden. What a place to live. The displays are meticulously maintained, as you'd expect in Singapore and well-designed and presented. And you can start or finish with an excellent lunch at the Halia Ginger restaurant, in the Gardens, very close to the Orchid Garden entrance."
,,Gardens within a garden,4.0,,"Was a bit disappointed with this as tere were not as many flowers as expected - possibly because of the season - January, I don't know. I found it to be interesting but not spectacular."
,,lovely day in fab gardens,5.0,,Had been told to visit this place if possible. Did a tour and got off here and spent a few hours walking round these idyllic gardens. I love orchids and were not disappointed. Took so many photos. I would recommend this to flower lovers.
,,Did not visit this time .went in 2012 and is is lovely.,5.0,,If you love orchids this is a must orchids of all varities lovely colours and lots Of information about them
,,Just amazing,5.0,,"A stunning orchid garden based in an amazing park. If you like plants you will be in heaven. An amazing collection based in the heart of the city, well set out and easy to reach. Please don't leave Singapore without a visit."
,,Beautiful and Clean,4.0,,"The view in this park is really nice,especially in a rainy day,but it's easy to get lost in it.Anyway,it's worth to visit."
,,It's good,5.0,,Well if someone has a passion for orchids this is the place . I did visit since its inside the campus to the botanical garden . It's good . By for me I am Not the best fan for orchids
,,Awesome place,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden was the highlight of our trip to Singapore. I must have taken a photo of every orchid there as they were all so beautiful. We could have stayed there for days. So many varieties and colours of orchids. Beautiful archways, fountains and pathways. And the VIP garden was especially beautifully set out with plaques explaining the history of the flower and who it was named after. A must-see for every visitor to Singapore."
,,Soothing,5.0,,I heard about this when I went to the Botanic Garden. Decided to check it out with the normal walk through the garden. It was a relaxing time and for the 5$ it is worth it.
,,Fantasy Orchid Garden,5.0,,Breathtaking orchids of many varieties are nestled in creative gardens. The delicate white orchid variety dedicated to Princess Diana as well as the lovely multi-colored orchids dedicated to Prince William and Katherine do not disappoint.
,,"This and the house is really beautifull, well worth the extra",5.0,,"Nice place to wander around lots of photo opportunities, and you can see how much hard work goes into keeping it that way"
,,Another must do,5.0,,"A plant lovers heaven. No, a heaven even for those who are not gardeners. A riot of colour which tittilates the senses."
,,Still Fantastic,5.0,,This was my second visit. Six years on these gardens are still impressive. Such wonderful displays. Excellent value in fact I believe it is too cheap for what you get. Excellent and unique visitor centre. Loved it to bits.
,,National Orchid Garden,5.0,,I never knew there were that many different kinds of orchid before this visit. It was a wonderful experience. Will definitely visit again next time at Singapore.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"I love orchids, so for me this was amazing to see. There are endless species to see. I didnt know that there where so many! There is also a glass dome that has orchids that like the cold... You need to pay to get it, but it is very much worth it."
,,"beautiful, quiet",5.0,,solace in a bustling city--worth walking around. You are in a virual paradise! You forget that you are in the middle of a metropolis!
,,Flower Power,5.0,,"There's no doubt that Singapore's gardens are delicious, famously so, and I have enjoyed my many trips there, and the great news now is that the train station has been completed! The walk is delightful to the Orchid Garden, but give yourself some time. The signs within the park are almost randomly placed and are strangely inaccurate.
No, its not just you, I'm good with signs. Also if you are not fit and not good with heat do not do it on foot. It is a long way, and while I'm a fit 50+ year old I struggled with the heat. I think it a great opportunity to bring back the rickshaw (gasps from the audience) as it would be the coolest and grooviest thing. Oh, and NO not the Raffles rip-off rickshaws, go easy on the tourists for heaven's sake we are all a bit tired of being exploited. A fair price and we will come again and again. We probably would tip well too.
The gardens are inaccessible to a lot of people who are obese or frail or just plain tired. If you put us in a wheelchair or a motorised cart you only advertise our infirmity to the general populace, which marginalises us.
The park should be filled with water stations-filtered and refrigerated water stations. Its a kindness that we shall not forget. Again no, no overpriced bottled water, we have enough of that from our hotel, thank you very much. The entrance fee is a bit hurtful-do you think you could give a small bottle of chilled water as a gratuity as we go in? It would cost...what...20 cents? Thirty ?
Sorry, where was I...in the park, yes. Orchids...ooohhh love 'em. More!"
,,Just Beautiful,4.0,,"This is a wonderful experience, something everyone should do once in their lives if you visit or live in Singapore. It is really beautiful."
,,Fascinating!,5.0,,"Orchids are Singapore's national flower, but it is only in here that you get to see such a wide selection of orchids. I previously didn't know of so many orchid species, but my trip here really opened my eyes. Very informative, and very fascinating flowers."
,,Orchids orchids n more orchids!!,5.0,,Check with the Orchid Garden Office before buying your tickets. Usually the orchids bloom all year round yet there will be times when the orchids are not really flowering and u see only the leaves. Orchids are usually at full display in June n again in Feb when the season is at its hottest!
,,Lovely - lovely - lovely!!,4.0,,"Originally, this wasn't on my list to see. I had some extra time and read that this is within the Botanic Gardens for a nominal (5 SGD) fee. I'm SO glad I did. I spent almost 4 hours just wandering around. The orchids were, by far, the main attraction. If you plan to eat there, don't go to the Raffles Building. Poor variety and poor service. If you walk to towards the orchid gardens first, you'll find a lovely plaza to get food or coffee along the way."
,,Orchids and Orchids,5.0,,"A lovely garden, planned so beautifully and very colourful. Walking through the garden one can see so many varieties of orchids starting with Vanda which has been first created here. The dendrobium varieties are numerous and of so many varied colors, as also the other varieties that can be seen there."
,,Exquisite!,5.0,,"Absolutely incredibly beautiful! Really worth a visit. There is a huge variety of orchids, each prettier than the previous ones."
,,Amazing collection of exotic Orchids,5.0,,Truly one of this island nation's unique tourist attractions. Especially for lovers of flora and avid macro photographers. Singapore's National Orchid Garden with it's rare selection of natural and cloned orchid varieties displayed in a natural setting never fails to impress.
,,Lot of orchids,4.0,,Very pretty garden and well maintained. Orchid is the national flower of Singapore and hence it has quite impressive collection of orchids. I love the garden but seldom been there. It took around 2-3 hours to walk around and of course photo shooting. I met the Singapore PM once at the garden. How lucky!!
,,Best display of orchids in the world,5.0,,I grow orchids as a hobby and I never get tired of visiting the Orchid garden. Just stunning colors and variety of species.
,,When nature makes it wonderfull,5.0,,"When it comes to Orchids feminity, beauty and colours are involved

The National Botanic Gardens truely have the nicest orchids collection I have ever seen.

It is indicated that they present more dans 3000 species of it.

The sinuous path leads you isles of larges bouquets. It makes these areas look really like ""Tableaux"" ....even under a rain shower.

One among then concentrates the most beautifull flowers they have at a precise moment

Please take a minute at the work done by the keepers. You will definetely understand why this term is appropriate.

Don't forget to drink water as the atmosphere is rather warm and humid, the landscape counts many ups and downs and allthemore the sun can be very hot"
,,One if the MUST SEE tourist attractions while in Singapore,4.0,,I have been in Singapore several times and during every other visit I go there and have never been disappointed. It is so special and interesting for people coming from Europe and not just them!

,,Wonderful,5.0,,This is without doubt the best value $5 I have ever spent. A truly national collection that stuns with its beauty.
,,A handcrafted garden.,5.0,,"Located within the grounds of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the Orchid Garden is carefully curated in four zones according to the seasons.

,,Beautiful,5.0,,"If you walk round the botanical gardens which are free to enter you must stop in at the orchid house. Superb orchids, all different colours. Really stunning displays. Chap entrance fee."
,,Extraordinary Display,5.0,,"This is the most dramatic, artistically presented orchid garden I have every had the pleasure to view. There are so many different kinds of orchids of highly unusual varieties, as well as mass groupings that are utterly compelling. One area of the garden has orchids named for various heads of state that have visited Singapore, and another area has a walkway with a bower of orchids. Anyone who loves beautiful and unusual plants must come here. It is a haven in a busy city."
,,Hot Humid and searching for orchids !,3.0,,"a descent place , but not worth if you looking for blooming orchids ! % of orchids vs the area is very low. if you looking for Europe type tulip garden , then you in for a disappointment like us."

,,Cool Place to walk,4.0,,Nice and cool place to visit. The beauty of flowers are really heart touching . We spent good time after a walk
,,Fitting Garden for the National Flower,5.0,,Within the Singapore Botanic Gardens is the National Orchid Garden built along a large hillside. Owing to the tropical weather of Singapore it is all outside save some shade structures with misters for the most delicate. If you are an orchid lover you will not find a larger variety or more beautiful presentation than here. Even for the average traveler the thousands and thousands of colorful blooms are a sight to see.
,,Stunning gardens,5.0,,Walked around the Botanical Gardens this morning and enjoyed the spectacular setting and flowers in this beautiful city. It was not no 1 on my list of visits but it is definitely worthwhile even on this humid morning.
,,Pure colorful afternoon,5.0,,"So many beautiful color and amazing decoration. I would recommend nature lovers to visit this garden, is just magestic. You can notice this place is so well taken care of, however you don't really see anyone taking care of the plants or the flowers."
,,Worth a Visit,5.0,,"We fought the local underground train here and walked through the botanical gardens to the Orchid Garden, it is beautful, you should try it"
,,Very beautiful,5.0,,"This is a lovely place to walk even in the hottest day. For the northern visitor it is bizarre to have a ""cool"" house."
,,Highlight of the Botonic Garden,5.0,,"If you visit the Singapore Bontonic Garden it is worth the additional admission to see the Orchid Garden. It's amazing to see so many types of orchids outside, when compared to other places we have visited. The variety and extensiveness of the number of orchids makes this remarkable."
,,Just fantastic orchid gardens,5.0,,A very interesting way to see many different kinds of orchids in many different colors growing in the gardens.
,,Just Amazing!,5.0,,Wish I could stay more! Wanna go again n again. Such a peaceful & cool place for the nature lovers like me :-)
,,Really impressive array of Orchids,4.0,,"We could have spent a whole day in this garden, I think, or at least several hours. We were in a rush as we had to catch our plane that evening, but the Orchid garden alone is a beautiful, well designed place that can keep you busy and interested for hours. There are a lot of cool things to see if you go slow and read about what makes each orchid special."
,,More than just orchids.,4.0,,"The Orchid Garden is inside Singapore Botanical Garden. As the name states, it is a garden full of orchid. From the moment you step through the turnstiles, there are orchid at every corner. There are many Photo Stops well designed for visitors to have nice photo with the orchids. There are many varieties of orchids. I personally like the one that looked like a flamenco dancer.

The garden can be a little confusing at first because there are many ""cross-roads"" and you may not decide which to go. However, if you have 1hr to spare, you can venture the entire orchid garden. And if you have more than 1hr, you can slowly admire all the orchirds that are on main display and also flowers that are hidden along the walkway, largely ignored by rushing visitors.

If you are feeling warm, there's a Cool House of about 15m long where you can cool off.

I would recommend to visit in the morning as the weather is cooler and the sun is bright. Or after a rain, the water droplets add more life to the flowers and a cooler surrounding (A cooler outdoor in Singapore may be as low as 28 Deg C).

Bring a macro lens or a camera with macro functions (I believe the new smartphones are good enough too), it's fun taking picture with the lovely orchids.

There is a wide variety of plants, especially orchids - hence the name - and they are well presented and there are ample photo opportunities. They also switch around the plants quite often so each visit feels like a new experience. I was surprised to see an orchid dedicated to Annika Sorestam, the former Swedish world champion golfer, for instance.

If you are a Singaporean or PR, entry is free as well.

Do also visit the Mist garden, where rare orchids are featured, as well as the Cool House, where I especially like the pitcher plants.

There is a gift shop at the exit."
,,One for the orchid fans really...,3.0,,"As a none lover of orchids (or flowers), it was an OK experience. Some of the orchids were nice to view with interesting flowers.
It was novel to see orchids named after celebrities on their visits to the garden however I know only 2 of the many celebrities.

Beautifully laid out over a large area - you could spend hours wondering around enjoying the various layouts and learning from the detailed signs in some of the gardens. Lovely way to spend some peaceful time. The gardens are free but the orchid garden is S$5 each.

,,This is a Gem!!!,5.0,,"Indeed a pleasant surprise! Been to the Botanical gardens for so many times and decided to visit the National Orchid Garden since for Singaporeans, it is currently free admission! You just need to bring and show your NRIC at the entrance, else normal entrance fees are $5 for adults. Hold and behold, surprised at the amount of flora and orchids here and surprised at how big the grounds of this Orchid garden is!!!! This is indeed one of the hidden attractions in Singapore! Totally underrated and not well advertised! The small entrance to this garden is very misleading as the grounds behind covering also the VIP Orchid garden, the Cool garden, etc are indeed very well kept and large. You will need at least 1 hour or more for a decent visit. There is also a nice souvenir shop near the entrance and exit to the garden. Totally a Gem and a must visit for anyone going to Botanical gardens or orchid lover!"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Manicured, carefully planted, well worth a visit if you love flowers. Great to see orchids in their outdoor growing surrounds, rather than in pots on the table!"

Singapore's national flower, the orchid, is lucidly explained in various charts and reports displayed on the walls. The different orchids named for visiting dignitaries are tastefully displayed in the small garden outside. Spend at-least half an hour, more if possible; gift shop at the exit has nice souvenirs,"
,,Must visit!,5.0,,"If you want to see orchids and more orchids in the most serene setting you must visit the Orchid Garden! Plus after you visit this place, you can also take a stroll in the vast botanic garden which has just been honored as a UNESCO World Heritage Site!"
,,Inexpensive way to explore Singapore,5.0,,I'm a long time resident of Singapore and ironically this is my first visit to the Orchid Garden. I was surprised at how well manicured the garden is and the variety of orchids. It was much larger than I expected - but not too big that you can't manage in about 45 minutes to an hour.
,,Bloomin' brilliant,5.0,,"Stunning display of the orchids that Singapore is so renowned for.

The orchid garden is a bit of a walk (1.4kms) from the MET stop if you're coming by train.

The Botanic Gardens are also lovely so it's definitely worth investing some time there (perhaps not with a teenager in tow)."
,,Leisurely stroll,4.0,,We took a leisurely stroll thru gardens (getting off the Hop On Hop Off bus) and then paid the additional $5 for the orchids. They ARE beautiful. Delicate and it's really peaceful. Good in the morning
,,Should be No 1 thing to do in Singapore,5.0,,"Cost is $5 Singapore dollars ($4 US), for the seniors it is only $1!!! You won't find more orchids in one spot than this. The setting is spectacular, don't miss the VIP orchid garden (no extra charge) and the ""cool house"". Also the ""misting"" hut is NOT to be missed! Take water, it can get hot. Be prpared to spend at least 2 hours there so hat and sunglasses advised. Too many photo opportunities to count, and spectacular orchid displays should make this a tourist ""NOT TO MISS"" event when in Singapore. No food/drinks are served in the Orchid gardens themselves, so be sure to bring your own bottle to fill at convenient water fountains."

,,Lovely little fellas - the orchids that is,5.0,,"The $5 SNG to enter really is very cheap for the myriad of colours and shapes that make up this quite exceptional Orchid Garden. I am guessing - I know little - that this is the best garden of its type anywhere in the World - making Wisley look like something out of the Vauxhall Conference (footie reference for all UK viewers).

It takes about 45 minutes to walk around depending on how many Chinese selfie takers you trip over. Wine over.

Yes, if you go to the Botanical Gardens, then make sure you to to the NOG as well. NOG, like that - you will to."
,,Very nice collection of Orchids,5.0,,"I am not a big fan of Orchids but my mother is an Orchid Nut. She insisted me to go with her on a tour there.
The place is nice, the flowers are absolutely magnificent.
They control the temperature+ Humidity of different chambers in the garden for specific types of Orchids, which was great to experience.
If you love Orchids and gardens in general, give it a try and you won't be disappointed."

,,Foreign visitors' fave,5.0,,"My french friend REALLY wanted to come here and he was WOW-ed by the beauty of the gardens and flowers. Me being the Singaporean took the tropical flora for granted but my friend reminded me that this was a very visual and sensual (heat included from a frigid winter) experience for him.

The orchids were gorgeous - hard to beat when they were bred that way - and the VIP Orchid Garden was our favorite highlight. Mist house was a relief from the heat and a great selfie spot when the mist sprays turn on."

,,Flowerama!,5.0,,"Although the MRT station is on the other side of the National Botanic Garden, the 1.3 km walk that you take to get here is very scenic and worth taking. Admission is a mere $5 for adults ($1 for children and seniors, free for students). I went on a Sunday, and it wasn't crowded at all. It certainly feels more secluded than Gardens by the Bay.

As for the garden itself, it's bursting with colorful orchids. The first half has fountains, a large cage, and golden arches, while the last half has a few greenhouse structures. Don't forget to bring your camera to this magnificent garden!"
,,A day to relax,5.0,,"the orchid garden is wonderful just to walk round and look and see how orchids you know on show there is 20,000 plus plants from the small flower to the large flowers but the colours are fab, just take your time looking around and lots of photos."

,,A great chance for some photography!,5.0,,"As a guy I can’t say that I easily get excited over Orchid Gardens but this place was actually really worth the entry fee (I think it was about 10-12SGD). Theres a huge variety of Orchids that provided great opportunities for me to practice my photography skills.

Its all outside and was pretty warm and humid when I was going around but there is an enclosed area which is really cool and refreshing that holds Orchids that need that sort of temperature to survive - definitely helped.

There was a decent selection in the souvenir shop and it was all reasonably priced if you’re into that sort of thing."
,,Nice place,3.0,,It's a botanical garden albeit man-made but a nice respite nonetheless from the heat of Singapore. Good for a nice stroll to get in some exercise while on travel. Nothing overly spectacular but it's just a few dollars for entry to the orchid garden and the swans are pretty cool.

,,Beautiful Natural Habitat for Orchids,5.0,,"This is THE most extensive collection of orchids ...I believe....in the World. Breathtakingly beautiful...delicate....exotic.

Just watch out for everyone taking photos & ( unfortunately) selfies....Such a nuisance!

Wish the Gardens Gift Shop actually sold a photo book highlighting their orchids...Just offer a book of all orchids in Singapore....which is probably same as what they have.

People seem to enjoy the "" Celebrity Orchids,"" named in honor of various famous figures.

Well worth the journey to see this part of the Botanical Gardens."
,,Orchids rare and unique!,4.0,,"It's worth a visit definitely! You get to see the variety of orchid hybrids named after famous international diplomats, royal family and superstars in Celebrity Orchid Garden and VIP Orchid Garden !! Read in papers that there is always a ready supply of orchid hybrids which are ready to be named, and one special hybrid with appropriate colour, and characteristics most apt to describe the celebrity and VIP will be specially selected and named after the person. Note that depending on period of visit different orchids will blossom.
Mist House with exotic colours of orchids and Cool Garden which showcases a montane tropical forest in cooling greenhouse is a must! Love too the pictures taken with friends under the canopy of yellow blooms, a rarity in many gardens as the gardeners take effort to prune the blooms ever ready for a memorable photo spot!
If visiting the Singapore Botanical Gardens, newly named as UNESCO World Heritage site, do not forego the National Orchid Gardens! !
Personally found it easier to enter through Tanglin Gate alighting outside Gleneagles Hospital (compared to taking train circle line to Botanical Gardens) as I love looking at the swans in the lake and also the famous tree which is epitomised on the back of the Singapore 5 dollar note. Enjoy the gardens!"
,,Amazing Orchids,5.0,,"Well worth the visit if you are into Orchids, so many varied types, colours and varieties. My husband not really into flowers in general was very impressed and thoroughly enjoyed our visit."

The skies opened up just before we got to the National Orchid Garden, so we retreated to a gift shop and café. After an hour's wait, we thought about looking for a taxi to take us to a museum. The long wait for taxis convinced us to have lunch back at the café instead. By the time we finished, the rain had finally ended. When we saw the orchids, we were delighted that we'd waited.

Our hotel was 2.3 miles from the botanical Gardens, The best way to get to it was by the subway from Chinatown, an easy and cool ride on a hot and humid tropical afternoon. We didn't have a lot of time so we headed straight to the orchid garden but since it is in the middle of the botanical garden we got to see many other beautiful parts of the garden on our way. I am an orchid grower, my husband is not so we approach things differently. Besides viewing large and colorful displays throughout the extensive gardens I also enjoyed many plants in bloom or not, to be found all over such as those found growing on plumerias. It was incredible. I especially enjoyed the cool house with a huge collection of species, many from the cloud forests of Ecuador. Sometimes you have to look in the nooks and crannies to find that special orchid that will knock your socks off. A bit boring for my husband while while I visually went through with a fine tooth comb, either way we both left feeling wowed. See this wonderful garden and all it has to offer. Being an orchid grower, I really appreciate that no matter what the season there is always something in bloom. This garden is not only about the orchids of SE Asia, but is about the global world of tropical orchids."

It wasn't that busy and for an Orchid enthusiast or simply one who delights in the beauty of nature, go and take some close up photos, they are distractingly beautiful.

,,Amazing orchid collection!,5.0,,Never have seen such a big and diverse collection. Staged and maintained in excellent condition with easy walking access.

This is a garden within the Botanic Gardens and you have to pay to enter it, although the Botanic Gardens themselves are free. I think it was S$5 for non residents but only S$1 for seniors and worth every cent. The time of the year may have been just right because everything was in bloom, I don't know what there will be in other seasons. It was a mass of different colours and flower forms and there was, in the main, very good labelling."

,,Exceptional,5.0,,Even if you are not a gardening or flower fan this section of the free Botanic gardens (Orchids-S$5/person) is truly spectacular with all types of varieties and non stop colour no matter what time of year. Check out the VIP area where famous people have an orchid named after them. It is a photographers delight in a very pleasant area including mist parts. A must see.
,,More Orchids that in the actul jungle,4.0,,I think most of like Orchids however after visiting the national orchid garden you'll be blown away what beautiful orchids really stands for. I remember looking at the darkest red-almost black orchid play with those colors I though how do they arrive to these levels? Being in Singapore and not stopping by the gardens would be a lost opportunity to see one of the most incredible displays of orchids in the world.

It is truly brilliant, extensive displays including the cold house, brr, it feels like the Antartic after the warm humid outside. Information in laymans terms is also provided and a adds to the pleasure of visiting. Get your camera ready too. This place would warrant a visit if it was in any city in the world.

They had Espresso dark chocolate flavour last week, sit on the nearby benches and enjoy"
,,Amazingly beautiful,5.0,,If you get a chance whilst in Singapore you should visit the Botanical Gardens and more specifically the National Orchid Garden. I don't know much about orchids but it doesn't take a professional to see how much care and work has gone into making this garden so beautiful. The landscaping and layout is amazing. Just when you think you have seen the best bits there is something else around the corner. Spend an hour or so enjoying the garden and a few minutes respite in the orchid cool room to escape the heat and humidity. Fabulous.
,,A Must-See within a Must-See Botanic Garden,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is the only pay portion of the National Botanic Garden, but definitely a must.

The Botanical Garden is free but if you want to access the orchid section there is a small fee of S$5/-. The orchid display is spectacular and some are named after world leaders and dignitaries..
You never know when it might rain, so always handy to carry an umbrella because the shelters are not always close at hand - and don't be surprised to see the odd monitor lizard sharing the scenery with you"
,,So Amazingly Beautiful,5.0,,"We took the metro and got off at the Botanical Gardens exit which is still a 1.4K walk to the Orchid Gardens. That day it was record humidity so my husband whined a little but the walk was spectacular only topped by the incredible Orchid Gardens at the end of the walk. Most say just take a taxi or bus to the gardens but even with humidity the walk was worth it. Inside the Orchid Gardens, the beauty was unbelievable. Outside the Gardens is a great restaurant, forgot the name, but awesome place to rest from the experience. They will call you a cab if you are not up to the walk back. One of my favorite days in Singapore."

,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,"This is part of the Botanic Gardens. The gardens are free but there is a $5 charge to get in to the Orchid gardens. It is worth every penny as there are so many different orchids and they are all stunning. We wanted to take pictures of them all as they were so varied and all looked absolutely beautiful.

This renowned orchid garden was shifted slightly off the original Orchid Enclosure site and expanded in the 90's with a larger collection of both species and hybrids collection of the region and beyond.

A cool house is part of this expanded site and host to exotic temperate orchids throughout the World. There is also an interesting showcase of hybrid orchids created and named after visiting luminaries and World leaders; Baroness Margaret Thatcher, Crowned Prince Akihito, Premier Zhu Rongji, and Jackie Chan, Bae Yong Joon, Bindi Irwin and Shah Rukh Khan to name a few.

There's also a fragrant orchid section and if you are lucky you would be amazed with the sweet smelling Papilionanda Mimi Palmer to that of foul smelling Bulbophyllum beccarri and perhaps picture the flower or seed pod of most commercial of all orchids, Vanilla planifolia.

To calm your nerves after all these excitement, you could adjourned to the tea garden at the original ""orchid enclosure site"" for light refreshments and snacks. Orchids plantlets and cut-flower are also available to complete your visit. A must visit for both orchid enthusiast and novice.

PS: For bromeliads lovers, there's the one section within the NOG, possibly the largest public collection in this part of the world."

,,Enchanting,5.0,,"Perhaps this is the centerpiece for Singapore, but it was activity for my first and only day in Singapore. After a stroll through colorful Chinatown we took the tour bus for the Botanical Gardens and headed for the National Orchid Garden. The landscape architecture is congenial and the subtlety of the hand of Nature is beautiful and heart-warming. Strolling through Garden recalled images of Sunday afternoon walks in graceful Impressionist paintings. For the most part, people were quiet and respectful allowing you to contemplate Nature's bounty. There was an interesting exhibit of mountain plants and even carnivorous plants (how cool is that to see such intelligence), but the curved paths up and down the hillside match and exceed orchid gardens anywhere."

,,Fabulous design and range of orchids,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden is part of Singapore Botanic Gardens, and although the rest is free, orchid part requires a fee of $5SGD for an adult to enter.

I thought this was a million times better then the gardens by the bay."
,,Orchid o Orchid!,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, no doubt, you will visit the Botanical garden. Keep one full day for this tourist attraction. Probably, you will have to reserve, one third of your time for the national Orchid Garden. We visited this place the last in the day.

You will enjoy it!"

(The Flower Exhibit). I think after 4 exhibits or Orchids I was kinda done with the place. It's pretty don't get me wrong, but if given the option to do this or Gardens by the Bay - do Gardens By the Bay. Also if you go during the Mid Autumn to Gardens By the Bay - it is well decorated.

BTW, If you take the MRT to see this, wear sneakers and plan for a decent size walk. You might even pack for a run and jog from the MRT to the entrance. Lots of locals run this park. Also, don't go on Tuesday - many ancillary gardens are closed."

,,Don't miss this,5.0,,"Absolutely wonderful. Great chance for beautiful photographs. It is truly a not to be missed site. Also as a senior, it only cost 1S$ to get in."
,,A visit definitely not to be missed.,5.0,,"A true Singapore gem. The gardens could be explored for days. If you are a tree hugger, this is a must. Where tall ships (tea clippers) would put in to have the masts replaced as the trees grew so amazingly tall and straight. Herbal medicines from shrubs, trees and plants with the remedies for illness explained. All the ancient chinese herbal medicines used by the whole population to cure seemingly all ailments. But the orchid gardens just take your breath away. Astonishing colours, varieties, shapes and sizes drape themselves from all available surfaces in a garden wonderland. Natural beauty in vivid forms."

,,Mesmerising!,5.0,,"Thumbs up: Variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, well maintained, carnivorous plant and tiger orchid"
,,A beautiful oasis,5.0,,My husband and I visited the orchid garden as part of a group tour. In hindsight we would have gone on our own and spent longer as there is a lot to see. It really is very beautiful and a wonderful place to visit. I just wish we'd been able to stay longer.
,,Nice one to visit,5.0,,"Recently this site has been awarded as unesco heritage site (for the overall botanical garden, of course).. the first and only one in singapore to be awarded as of now..orchid garden is part of the larger botanical garden. ..

The souvenirs shop at the exit is n8ce and cheap.. I took the risk and bought few ""orchid in acrylic"" for us and friends. I tell you i reviewed these items everywhere else and was way cheaper than any other outside shops including the airport duty free shops. At least by 20%. We bought 5 small pcs for SGD 25 to our surprise we found airport duty free to be like SGD30+... and Additionally when you pay for purchase at the ""orchids garden shop"" ask them for tax reduction.. they will give a GST certificate certified under your passport spevs which you can claim at airport GST counters... which is another 7% lower.. so DON'T BUY from airport duty free at all.."

,,Very pretty,4.0,,"Simple advice- spend the extra 5 dollars and visit this garden, it is very pretty. We are not 'garden loving' people but enjoyed the surrounds. There are some lovely photo spots inside too.

,,Beautiful Orchid,5.0,,"It's in the Botanic Garden. So when you talk to the taxi driver, you need to say Botanic Garden instead of Orchid Garden. It charge $5 while the Botanic Garden is free. It might be the best collection of orchids in the world."

,,"Beautiful Flowers, Great To See",5.0,,"We visited the National Orchid Garden for FREE as they had a special offer for children and accompanying adults who attended during the local school holiday period could enter for free. At worst the entry fee was low and would have been acceptable anyways.

The gardens are extensive, well planned with easy to walk paths. The flowers are beautiful, and we had fun navigating our way around the site. Our kids loved the many different flower types and water features within the site.

Contained weighing the Singapore Botanical Gardens, the Orchid Centre is well worth a visit. The surrounding botanic gardens are also a must see.

Allow at least 45mins to an hour to take in all that the Orchid Centre has to offer."
,,Orchids are lovely.,5.0,,"Amazing place. Surroundings are beautiful, staff are nice. Easy to get to. Spend a lovely hour and relax..."
,,Amazing plant gardens,5.0,,We took a bus tour which had a stop at the National Orchid Garden and I am very glad we did.

,,Over the Rainbow,5.0,,"Well what can you say? Like everything Singapore does, it's amazing. The colours always make me think of 'Somewhere over the Rainbow' and Judy Garland. Strange thought: I'm not a religious person, yet you just have to wonder how these miracles happened."

,,Orchids - fascinating,5.0,,"The #1 rating is well desrved and that's from someone who isn't really into flowers. I learned that Orchids are amazing and the VIP part where different types of Orchids are named after renowned people is wonderful.
Not only Orchids but vegitation that grows alongside them in different climates. A truely great experience."

,,Good if you love nature,5.0,,Place is very good but only if you have curiosity to see nature from close range. We loved spending good few hours around here.
,,Some Special Species worth seeing,3.0,,"It is within the Singapore botanical Garden, but it is a long walk from the MRT station. The botanical garden is good for a leisurely walk but not so comfortable when the weather is hot.

I was surprised that the Orchid Garden offered an admission discount to seniors who are not Singaporean Citizens.

The garden itself it not very large with winding alleys along the groups of orchids. The best part is the exhibition of special breeds for the various visiting VIPs to the country. In there I could spot some really nice species. While the rest of the garden shows only ordinary once that one can seen anywhere."
,,Natural beauty,5.0,,If you want to see Singapore at its traditional best this is a must visit. Stroll through these magnificent gardens and enjoy the beautiful atmosphere created.

,,Pure beauty,5.0,,Definitely something worth visiting. Unfortunately I discovered I had allergy on - guess what - orchid so couldn't really enjoy it. However my husband and my brother were astonished.
,,Simply the best!,5.0,,"Whether you are an orchid lover or just enjoy seeing beauty , this garden will take you're breath away! It is the only section of the wonderful, historic Botanic Gardens , you have to pay to enter ! A modest $5 and $1 for seniors, it is the best tourist dollar you could spend. Clever landscaping, allows you to see so many specie and hybrid orchids, many of which were developed in this garden. There is a great shade house and a magical cool house as well as a VIP orchid collection all accessed by well maintained paths wending through open air orchid displays.allow a couple of hours and make sure you have plenty of charge in you camera or phone as it is impossible not to take photos !"
,,Don't Miss out the Beautiful Orchids!,5.0,,It has a wide range of orchids - absolutely beautiful! Highly recommended if you have time or spare some time there! You have to see them yourselves to fully appreciate them. Reading it on the book is not justifiable....
,,perfect scenery and sooooo picture perfect.,5.0,,"Lucky to have a cool day lovely gardens and clean as you expect in Singapore, the jewellery in store very reasonable, just a really nice place to visit."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"The orchid gardens are located in the centre of the botanical garden in Singapore. The botanical garden itself is free to visit and you should, especially in the morning when there are not that many people.

The Orchid Garden (as the name suggest) is full of Orchids. We were not prepared for what we saw. The number and variety of orchids was astonishing. With every step you encounter a new colour and shape.
Truly amazing!"
,,There is always something out and exciting,4.0,,"One of the pleasures of the many and varied species of orchids is the variety and nature. Initially, I was led to believe that they are merely tropical plants, but my own experience in growing them in Melbourne suggests that, depending on the species, they are rather hardy.

As you walk through this garden (which is a paid entry, unlike the rest of the Botanic Gardens), the seeming fragility of the plants belie the actual robust and exciting nature of what is on display.

Depending on what gate you arrive at the Gardens, it is a bit of a hike if you are not inclined to walking, and incline is an important word to keep in mind as the journey through the gardens takes you up several generously raised paths.

In addition to the variety of tropical cultivars and hybrids, the Cool Room in the centre of the Garden serves as a well earned oasis. The several degrees lower and misting cooling as the mountainous species are encouraged to grow provides a well earned rest.

I would advise packing a water bottle with you-good advice in the tropics at any time.

Photography is delightful in this environment-a tripod may be of advantage if you wish to spend the time taking detailed exposures (with or without a ND filter) but on the whole, I found my DSLR to be more than adequate handheld. Do be aware, as is the local situation, many tourists are armed with selfie poles and have concern or courtesy to anyone who might actually be more concerned with the plants than recording themselves as being somewhere!

The Gardens on the whole is a day well spent; the Orchid Garden, on UNESCOs World Heritage Register is a must see in this otherwise built up and overly controlled city."
,,Just amazing,4.0,,"One of the most beautiful places, so much colour, variety. Even if you are not a garden lover you will be blown away."
,,Rich in Beauty,5.0,,One of the finest scenic beauty in Singapore.. We visited Singapore during October 2014 and thoroughly enjoyed every moment of our vacation and sightseeing and this is one of them.. A must see for all the tourists visiting Singapore...

,,KUDOS SINGAPORE,5.0,,What a way to arrive!!! singapore you have arrived. most beautiful and clean city of the world. the orchid garden is AWESOME!!!
,,Not that great,3.0,,"Is was extremely crowded when we visited the place due to being free for locals. I didn't think it was that great. Maybe if you love orchids. And I mean really love!! Because they can be rare, but I didn't think they were that beautiful"
,,Widest Range of Orchid you can find,5.0,,"I am a singaporean and visiting the Bontanic Garden and National Orchid Garden is free (during Aug our SG50 Celebration). The wide range in the Orchid Garden is amazing as we have cultivated many hybrid Orchids i would say in our region.
There are many Political visitors to our country and some of the Hybrid Orchids are named after them. I would recommend family to visit as you can take many beautiful pictures. Bring back the pretty Orchids in photos but not the real flower."
,,So beautiful,5.0,,"This is worth the entrance fee, it was so beautiful, and well maintained, the different varieties of orchids was out of this world and the colours were superb.
The Gardens are so easily accessed and have plenty of seating areas and shaded areas.
Just a delight to walk around and would highly recommend a visit."
,,Amazing garden,5.0,,"This is an absolute ""must visit"" when you are at the Botanical Gardens. It is worth every penny of the small entrance fee. I have never seen such a huge display of magnificent blooms in a multitude of colours and sizes. We visited in the morning arriving at about 10am and it was not busy at that time. We used the hop on hop off bus to get there which was very easy. Give yourself plenty of time here as you won't find anything like it anywhere else!!"
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,"This garden is actually within the much larger botanic park of Singapore. It's definitely worth a visit! A really nice break from the city, you can also walk around the rest of the park and visit a rainforest section and many other garden exhibitions."
,,So many colors. Just beautiful!,4.0,,"One of the first things our friends told us to do while here was visit the Botanical Gardens to see the National Orchid Garden. I'm so glad we did.

I'm still wondering why there were no bugs in Singapore; not even in a lush botanical (and very tropical rain forest) garden."
,,Blooming Marvelous,5.0,,"We spent the morning at the National Orchid Garden, situated within the Botanical Garden, on 7 Sep 15. Would liked to have spent all day. The Orchid Garden is the solitaire diamond in a polished gold setting. Simply beautiful."

,,Orchid fiesta,5.0,,For only $5 this is a must see if you are visiting Singapore and enjoy gardens and the outdoors. It is easy to see why it got on the UNESCO listing earlier this year.
,,A visit to remember,5.0,,"After staying at Marina Bay Sands, my partner and I were already having a great holiday / honeymoon. We were told to visit the orchid gardens as they are absolutely amazing. Not being one that loves gardens, I had so much fun. Orchid Gardens is amazing.

It's fantastic, classy (unlike the flower dome, which is blingy), beautifully designed and full of the most wonderful rare and pretty orchids we'd ever seen in our lives. If only we could take them home with us! We then ate a lovely meal next door in the restaurant overlooking the ginger garden."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,The Orchid garden is located within the grounds of the Botanic Gardens. The array of orchids is very impressive. Anyone who loves orchids should not miss this garden as it would be one of the best selection of orchids you will see anywhere.
,,Holiday,5.0,,Beautifull take your walking shoes the orchids are exquisite the location is easy to get to the information is easy to follow

,,Fantastic orchids!,5.0,,"Fantastic Garden! really worth it to see, amazing orchids, especially if you love orchids like a do! Amazing experience! You can stop there when you buy your sightseeing tour ticket, you must dedicate one morning, becuase it is big!"
,,Great if flowers are your thing,3.0,,Great if flowers are your thing. I think I was expecting a bit more colour or a more impressive display. Not to say it isn't beautiful. If you are a student you get in for free so make sure you take your card
,,Beyond gorgeous!,5.0,,"Even if you think you are not an orchid person or garden love, definitely spend a couple of hours strolling the incredible National Orchid Garden. If there is one lovelier ,then this, I have no idea where it might be. The tropical garden which provides the backdrop is lovely, but the thousands of orchids hanging out of trees, planted en masse at ground level, provide design and color that are a sensory extravaganza. This is a do not miss during your stay in Singapore."
,,Not to be missed if u r an orchid lover !,5.0,,"There is no need to take a paid tour! Just go to the botanic gardens (free admission), find your way to the orchid garden and pay $5 (the last we checked; children / students $1) to get in. The place is small but packed with lovely orchids which make fantastic pictures. Don't forget to explore the collection of orchids named after famous people."
,,Truly magic!!!,5.0,,"I confess that I am not a passionate of orchids. My wife is. So I came here for her. Slowly but surely I was caught in the spell of dream images that were running in front of my eyes. The variety of species, how they are presented, they all make you fall in love with orchids. And if Singapore has succeeded, through this garden, to wake a insensitive like me, means that those who thought all this deserves praise, appreciation and respect.Bravo Singapore! Though so small, I have to admit that you are one of the most beautiful countries in the world !!!"
,,Good Feel,4.0,,The National Orchid Garden was a beautiful place for you if you love the natural feeling. It is not far from my hotel. We love orchid.
,,Lose yourself,4.0,,Start your trip early before the heat of the day. The actual Orchid Gardens are amazing. Escape the humidity in the pleasure of the cool room. We enjoyed sitting in the shelter overlooking the Swan Lake during a thunderstorm. Well worth a visit to escape the city.
,,A wonderful display of superb colourful orchids,5.0,,"We spent a couple of hours wandering through the extensive orchid gardens and took so many photos. We especially loved the celebrity orchid garden where new orchid varieties had been bred and named in honour of the celebrity. There were orchids for Princess Diana and for Prince William and Kate as well as many other famous people to include royalty, diplomats or famous people. It must be the year round stable climate that permits them to have so many orchids in bloom simultaneously. The entrance fee is nominal and is well worth the visit. It is large enough to support lots of visitors without feeling crowded."
,,Nice place.,4.0,,"Nice place to see if you visit it before Gardens by the Bay, otherwise it is not much impressive compare to The Gardens by the Bay. If you are wearing short, be aware of mosquitoes."
,,Must see if you like orchids,5.0,,Always try to fit a quick visit here. An oasis in a very busy city. Stunning orchids - Nice restaurant on the site as well. Will see rare orchid specimens. Worth a visit!
,,Breathtaking displays of orchids,5.0,,"Impressive orchid display over quite a large area. The landscaping in general is delightful, and you won't be able to stop yourself from taking masses of photos. Who knew that orchids came in so many different varieties and colours. Give yourself at least an hour to walk around and enjoy the gardens."
,,Huge variety of orchids,5.0,,"Must see if you decided to visit Singapore botanic gardens, because there is no other place on earth where you could find such a huge variety of orchids in one place. Beautiful, amazing and some never seen orchids."
,,"Always Green, always something new",5.0,,I have been visiting regularly for a few years now & I find the place has something new each time. The surroundings are green with lots of varieties of the Orchids. You could spend the whole day there and still feel like coming back. I did.
,,Really nice garden,4.0,,"Really enjoyed the layout and content of the orchid garden. Was interesting seeing the VIP section. The whole garden is well maintained and the floral scent was beautiful as you walk around, a bargain at 5 dollars"
,,A must for a visit to Singapore,5.0,,"Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant, what a beautiful place and only $5 entrance fee. You can spend hours in the Botanical Gardens"
,,Colours,3.0,,"If you like vivid colours, orchids and other flowers this is the place to be. This place is good for a family visit. It forms part of the Botanic Gardens. If you are in the area it is worth a visit.

The entrance to the botanic gardens is free of charge, however there is a small fee to enter the national orchid garden."
,,So much to see in this natural garden scape,5.0,,"This garden is huge. It has many sections and is a real garden, shaped by, but not man made. So much to see."
,,Green crested lizard,5.0,,"I like to visit gardens and I loved this one. You don't see much wildlife in Singapore (outside the zoo) so a close encounter with a green crested lizard was a highlight.
The orchid garden is a thing to behold and good value for money, especially if you are a senior (ie over 60). The gardens are large and take a lot of walking, make sure you take lots of water, accessible by bus or MRT."
,,Variety,5.0,,"The variety of orchids was beyond our expectations, all growing very happily in their beautiful landscaped gardens. A must see if you like orchids."
,,A must for orchid lovers,5.0,,"At weekend, best to go early as most people with family visits around 3 to 4pm. Plants are swapped regularly. Hence worth a visit every now and again. A must go for orchid lovers."
,,Absolutely beautiful!,5.0,,"I'm in heaven! Since i was a lover of flowers,no regrets when my cousin ask me to visit this place. How beautiful those orchids are. Absolutely beautiful. Don't miss to visit this place if you're in Singapore."
,,A nice relaxing walk,5.0,,"The gardens are a great place to relax and walk around. The variety and colours of the orchids are a sight to behold - I wasn't aware of the large number and types of orchids that are available.

Take your time and take in the quiet and peaceful surroundings as you pass by the myriad of colours that abound."
,,Takes ur breath away,4.0,,Although there is an entry charge it's worth it. Some of the most amazing orchids U can imagine & a few U couldn't imagine. Mother took dozens & dozens of photos & loves reliving the experience....
,,Orchids everywhere,5.0,,The Orchid garden is a wonderful place to spend time just wandering around. There are orchids to see at every turn.
,,Why do I have to pay?,4.0,,"You can read my review on Botanical Gardens for more information.

As I stated before, I really don't see why you have to pay to get in. If you are interested in Flora, a much better place would be the Gardens by the Bay at $20 for adults. What is nice about this place though is the intensity of colours around you however keep I mind that this place is small. Otherwise good to visit even if you have to pay to get in."
,,"Beautiful, colourful flora, all at one place",5.0,,"Beauty of flora- all at one place. National Orchid gardens offer a wide range of flora, ideal for the nature lovers. Its good for long early morning walks, in the peace of the vast land area that the gardens cover. The orchid garden displays a wide variety of rare orchids, all creatively displayed and planted."
,,Orchids non-stop,5.0,,"The orchids on display here are highly varied and unrivalled. The presentation far exceeds that of the Gardens by the Bay, whose displays tend to be garish and of the municipal style."
,,Beauty at its best,5.0,,The Orchid Garden is breathtaking - I could have stayed all day looking at the selection and array of orchids on display. Certainly a spot for the avid gardener.
,,Singapore National Orchid Garden,5.0,,As a lover of flowers the National Orchid Garden was one of the highlights of my visit to Singapore. You could spend a whole day there.
,,Tropical Paradise of Orchids!!,5.0,,"One of the three gardens and the only tropical garden of its kind to have been honoured with UNESCO World Heritage site. It is home to the worlds' largest collection of orchids. With over 1000 species and 2000 hybrids it boasts of incredible credentials only a few other orchidariums can claim.

The National Orchid Garden is one of the many gardens inside the Singapore Botanical Gardens. While the entry to SBG is free there is a small entry fee of 5 SGD to the National Orchid garden but Oh! it is so worth it. Whether you are a plant lover or not, this place is a must visit for everyone. Only so much beauty that your eyes can behold. The Garden has been very well conceived and designed with flowers classified according to the four seasons. The types of orchids vary dramatically in shape, size and colour and flowering times. I so wanted to see the elusive tiger orchids in bloom but owing to their unpredictable blooming times which can be in 3-4 years or sometimes even more; I could not. Unlucky day. Still, not complaining..since my eyes feasted on so many other kinds of beautiful orchids.

There were many groups of school kids who were there for educational purposes - how the breeding of hybrids was done and learn more about the various types. Don't forget your camera as there are many photo-ops for the lovers of nature. I myself got some really nice close up shots of the vivid colours of orchids juxtaposed against the green foliage as well.

Facilities at this place are also good. There is a restaurant and wash rooms right outside the garden.

Highly recommended!!"
,,Don't miss it!,5.0,,"Every time we are in Singapore we visit the NOG. We love the way there right through the Botanic Gardens which are very relaxing and unique!
You see so many different Orchids in every color you can imagine surrounded by georgeous rain forest. Everything is very well maintained and really beautiful.
In my opinion it is a must-see during a stay in Singapore!"

,,Boolaroo bunch,5.0,,Beautiful gardens...Orchids are spectacular...jus go early as it can get quite humid. Didn't get all the way round the day we went as it was too hot
,,Take your time and merge with the beauties on display,5.0,,What a refreshing place even when it is so hot and damp outside. Do not rush through if you like orchids - plan for at least 2 and half hours.
,,Flora Flora Flora,5.0,,I was there for my mum who passionate about Orchid very much and she love it so much.Variety of orchid in spectacular garden and she enjoy it.
,,Soo beautiful,5.0,,"Fabulous must not miss and give yourself plenty of time. We took a hop on hop off bus service called City Tours, they were fantastic."

,,Do not miss it,5.0,,"Wonderful experience in Singapore, absolutely not to miss. This orchid garden is within the spectacular botanical garden protected by UNESCO. It can brings you to a fable atmosphere, where you forget being in the middle of the Singapore urban area"
,,Orchids Everywhere,4.0,,If you are in Singapore you must visit the National Orchid Garden! Even If you are not a Flowers Lover you will appreciate it!
,,A pleasant garden stroll,3.0,,"It is a very pleasant area for a nice stroll around. The kids will be bored, but lovers of all things plant like will love it. I would't go out of my way to do it, but it is nice none the less."
,,A Lovely Garden,5.0,,"Go early when not so hot. But, they do have cooling stations along the way. As a New Yorker and member of the NY Botanical Gardens my expectations were high. The Orchid Garden was stunning... A must see for anyone who enjoys natures beauty...."
,,well worth a visit,5.0,,These days you rarely get what you do not pay for but at S$5 for an adult the garden is fantastic value. Lovely flowers and a peaceful environment.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Lovely gardens, spent about 2 hours there and i am not really a plant person. All flowers were well looked after."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"We could have spent a couple of days walking through this wonderful place. Took lots and lots of photo's, although there were lots of people we never felt crowded, at least not until we got to the shop."
,,Enjoy magnificent view while doing exercise,4.0,,"Got down at botanic gardens mrt station, you'll directly see the welcome gate of botanical garden.. from there, the orchid garden will take ~1.5km walk, but it was worth it. You're gonna enjoy the view inside the garden.. there are many lakes and thematic gardens which you will pass by before arriving at the national orchid garden.. there's no joke, they call it orchid garden for a reason, orchid everywhere!!

And the cool house?? Just like the name, it was totally cool!!! Really enjoy the visit, though I was as tourist.. but for residence, it is good for going out doing some sports or just having a gathering with family and friends :)"
,,If You See One Thing in Singapore...,5.0,,A must see in Singapore. A corner of the Botanical Gardens (for which admission must be paid) it is well worth the trip. An enormous selection well displayed and great for photo enthusiasts.
,,Amazing Orchids,5.0,,Singapore's Orchid Garden in the botanical gardens has more species of orchids than I knew existed. The only issue is that there are so many that you really need more than one visit to appreciate them all.
,,Beautiful display; 'childish' approach.,3.0,,"Our family of three enjoyed the great variety of orchids in multiple colours. We visited on a cool morning, so the walk was very pleasant.

The garden was well maintained.

However, the garden was also 'childish' in a way that it told you exactly where you should take photos. We saw some rather 'childish' display of a sign amongst the flowers saying ""Photo Shot"". This 'help' was unnecessarily patronising, and the sign also impacted on the natural beauty of the flowers.

We were disappointed by the Celebrity Garden. Needless to say, most of the celebrities were unheard of. The orchids were charming, but linking them to insignificant characters was a rather childish approach.

Our visit to the Botanic Gardens and Orchid Garden was pleasant. The National Orchid Garden had pretty displays, and the displays were mostly orderly, with some artificial elements."
,,Worth the walk!,5.0,,"I'm not a flower person by any stretch of the imagination, but this was very nice and educational. Many varieties of plants and laid out nicely."
,,Lovely Garden.,5.0,,I visited National Orchid Garden with my wife. We really like it. It's so beautiful. We saw different types of Orchid flowers there. Had a very good time and enjoyed a lot.
,,Nature at its VERY best!!,5.0,,"Located within the National Botanical Gardens, the National Orchid Garden is DEFINITELY worth a visit.
A very reasonable entrance fee ($5 adults, $1 seniors) and very well laid out with easy to follow maps. I was highly impressed and would suggest if possible everyone should set out 2-4 hours and visit both, the botanical and the orchid gardens."
,,a must do if you like gardens,5.0,,This is simply an experience not to be missed if you like gardens at all. The wow factor is high and this is one of the more pleasant strolls one could think of.
,,Beautiful - not for kids though,5.0,,Definitely a stop worth making if you appreciate flowers. Very tranquil setting with lots of photo ops. Nothing here for children unless they love flowers. Very nice gift shop in the gardens.
,,Hot and colourful,5.0,,"Gardens are really beautiful with orchids growing in groups, all sizes and shapes. I can imagine how much it time and effort it takes to keep the place like this in this amazing shape. There are a few stations on the patch to take pictures and admire most unique and hybrid specie. And a cool house which you would appreciate if your not fully used to Singaporean climate."
,,Best Orchid Gardens in the world!,5.0,,"We were simply blown away by these magnificent gardens! Must see attraction for everyone loving flowers, orchids plus nature."
,,Lovely surprise,5.0,,Singapore is famous for it's orchids so go see this. I never knew there were so many species of orchids.
,,a must visit,5.0,,"Worth The price. Allow a full half day, at least and consider being there at the end of the day when the lights from the ""super trees"" come on. Enjoy pleasant and refreshing strolls through the domes - the giant terrariums are not just homes to plants, the layout is unique and artistic and the mechanics of its self sufficiency are fascinating."
,,Worth a visit!,5.0,,"Beautiful, tranquil and many, many photo opportunities if you are into that. I visited on my own and enjoyed wandering the area and taking pictures for a relaxing half day experience."
,,Kiwi's,5.0,,"This is a beautiful attraction in the centre of Singapore- reasonably priced, easy to access. The orchids are a spectacle.
there are lots of shady areas to rest and get a cool drink or ice cream. I highly recommend this for travellers to Singapore- its wonderful to see so much green space in the centre of the city"
,,Very nice exerience,5.0,,"if you are interested in horticulture and love flowers this is the place for you, ideal to visit with family as you have abundant space for leisure!"
,,A place for orchid lovers,5.0,,"The orchid garden is well maintained, attractive and a must for orchid lovers. It isn't far from the top of Orchard Road so if you are in that area it is worth popping in for a look see."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,So many beautiful and different types and so little time. Thank goodness for digital cameras I wouldn't be able to afford to print all the spectacular blooms
,,"Orchids, lots of orchids!",3.0,,"We paid the extra money to look around these gardens, I'm in two minds as to whether or not I actually thought it was with it. But not because it wasn't incredible but because im not much of a gardener! They were beautiful and there were lots of them to see. It's amazing that they keep them so well maintained (I can't keep my grass alive)."
,,A stunning haven of tranquility.,5.0,,"A haven to visit, this was a highlight of my stay in Singapore. Wonderful surroundings and well worth visiting."
,,Nice but crowded garden,3.0,,"We visited the garden on a Saturday. There were a lot of guests and everyone was taking pictures so we couldn't really enjoy every corner of this beautiful garden. In the garden's defense, this year all Singapore residents have free entrance so this might have an impact on the number of visitors.
Also, on the Saturday that we visited, a wedding was taking place in a part of the garden so the access was restricted in that area. We should have been informed about this prior to the ticket purchase or at least have someone direct the visitors so that we could continue our visit without wondering on some dead end alleys."
,,Must visit new Heritage sight in Singapore,5.0,,great for a sunday picnic or a walk among the trees. This is as beautiful as this garden city can get. Lovely variety of orchids along with a swanky restaurant makes this a must visit in Singapore
,,A must seen in Singaphore,5.0,,this is by far the most beautiful orchid garden I have ever seen. It has great variety of orchids and it is breathtaking.
,,One of the best orchid gardens in the world.,5.0,,"When visiting the Botanic Gardens, you will not regret paying the fee to enter the Orchid Garden. It is imaginatively landscaped, colourful, very interesting and of course colourful. Well worth seeing."
,,Floral delights,5.0,,we spent a delightful afternoon wandering through the splendid floral display and meticulously cared for landscaping
,,Beautiful orchids for orchid and flower lovers.,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens and many species of orchids. Leisurely stroll through the gardens and enjoy the flowers. It wasn't too crowded when we went. The restaurant was reasonable and the food was tasty. Easy to get to from the hop on hop off bus. Hot weather as Singapore is near the equator, wear a hat or visor."
,,Magicle,5.0,,Located inside the Singapore Botanic Gardens and can take nice long walk on the greenery to get to the Orchid Garden. Has a good variety of different kinds of Orchids. Walks in the garden feels like living in a magical fairy tale. Really worth the visit.
,,NOG,5.0,,"Visited The Garden, Marvelous Experience Informative but Need 5-6 Hour for satisfactory study. and lots of walking capabilities."
,,Something for everyone,5.0,,"Well worth a look, great collection of plants and very beautifully curated / presented. The garden is part of The Botanic Gardens. Serviced by the great Hop on Hop Off Hippo buses."
,,Included in hop on hop off bus,5.0,,The national orchid garden ticket was included in the sightseeing bus ticket so we decided to to there. Beautiful flowers and different to other places at singapore
,,A delightful walk enhanced by magnificent blooms,5.0,,"Located within the grounds of the Singapore Botanical Gardens, the National Orchid Garden is a delightful horticultural attraction well deserving its #1 rating. As with such displays, meandering
pathways flow through luxuriant beds of stunningly glorious orchids - by the 1000s! Should not be missed if you have any appreciation for nature's beauty.
Accessing the Orchid Gardens requires a walk of a few hundred metres from the nearest bus/taxi drop off point. But the walk is a pleasant one through the grounds of the Botanical Gardens."
,,Beautiful Paradise in the City,4.0,,"There were so many orchids on display. The bird cage and mist house were my personal faves - It's like stepping into a magical realm. I especially liked the red sprigs and white blooms - they were respectively breathtaking in their red-hot passion and serene purity. I did not see many celebrity-linked orchids, not sure if it's because I did not venture far enough or if it's because they rotate the orchids on display. Nevertheless, I did not expect it to be such fun spotting orchids named after celebrities and important personages instead of the human versions. The signs were a bit confusing though."
,,Worth a Visit!,5.0,,Amazing! My husband is not into gardening but really enjoyed this...Unsurpassed selection beautifully laid out and lots to see
,,More than just Orchids,4.0,,"There's more than just orchids to see, the displays have been designed to look as natural as possible as you walk around and appreciate their uniqueness. If your at the botanical gardens already then pay the $5 and check it out."
,,Super beautiful,5.0,,"Hundred of different families of orchids and thousand of orchids We can buy micro cuttings orchids in a transparent and closed pot, super for travelling"
,,beautiful orchids,5.0,,Very nice garden with a lots of beautiful orchids. Next time I go to Singapore I would visit it again.
,,Spectacular display of Orchids,5.0,,The National Orchid Garden is a spectacular display of orchids and fountains. Don't miss the tiger orchid fountain and the cool house.
,,Great place for orchid lovers,3.0,,"We're not huge fans of orchids - still spent a nice 1,5 hours there. We were furious to see that Singaporeans go in free while everyone else has to pay for the ticket. That is hugely discriminating."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is my favourite garden worldwide, I've seen quite a few over the years, well worth a visit, well laid out, good signage to tell you what the different orchids are, good value for money, if you are a Senior it cost $1SG, even better."

,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, you must visit the National Orchid Garden. You have to pay, but it's not much and it's well worth it."
,,Never miss it.,5.0,,"We never miss the visit to the Orchid Garden in the Botanic Gardens. Every orchid you could wish to see is there. Always hot of course, so bring water and hats etc, but then just relax and admire the very well kept specimens"
,,orchid paradise,4.0,,"i'm not particular fan of flowers but was still impressed by the gorgeous orchids in numerous variety in this garden.

the garden is very well organized so that you can actually take the trail to cover almost whole garden without return route. except for one garden with air con, the whole garden is in open air but with some shadow by trees. So it's better to visit in early morning or later evening (I visited it around 5pm when it's not that hot with some breeze).

It charges SGD5 for foreigners and free for local residents, which is reasonable.

There is a bit walk from either door for botanic garden but orchid garden till open 7pm.

BTW, the souvenior shop is overpriced."
,,A pleasant surprise,4.0,,"To be honest - we're not that into horticulture, but after so many recommendations to visit the National Orchid Garden we did end up going and both of us were pleasantly surprised. The different colours and settings alone meant we were a little excessive in taking pictures with the SLR. An easy walk from the MRT station."
,,Lots of Orchids,4.0,,"We went here as part of our visit to the Botanic Gardens. There is a small entrance fee but that's worthwhile due to the number of species they have. The exact number number is unclear as some guidebooks say 6000 and some say 3000. I thought I would try and photograph each one for posterity. My conclusion is that it doesn't really matter how many there are - you just need to know it's more than you will ever see anywhere else. In the end I found a more feasible challenge to be photographing other people taking photos of the orchids.
Due to the humidity we really enjoyed being in the cool house which was a bit like being back in the UK."
,,amazing potpourri of colours,4.0,,"So I am not really a flower person but even I was impressed:
1) Since botanic gardens got the UNESCO award, the gardens have really improved and its so pretty and even the walk there is beautiful
2 Orchids are not my favourite colours but I have to admit that it is so beautiful and there are so many kinds. to make it more interesting, they have (i) an area for ""celebrity"" orchids - so hybrids names after famous people (ii) a mist garden which is beautiful (iii) a cool house which is where you go when you need an air con break.
There is also a bridge where you can get a nice view of botanic gardens

all in all - great visit"
,,A must do when visiting Singapore,5.0,,When visiting Singapore you must pay a visit to the botanical & orchid gardens which in my opinion is one of the best in the world. The orchid gardens are beautiful with a wonderful display of stunning display of orchids in every colour imaginable.
,,A must in Singapore,5.0,,Absolutely beautiful. Superb layout with excellent information regarding the orchids. A great place to relax for a few hours away from the hustle and bustle of the city
,,Orchid Orchid Orchid,4.0,,"Visited on 20thAug15 with family. It opens daily at 8:30am-7pm (last ticket sales at 6pm). Admission ticket: Adult $5 / Senior citizens(60 n above) & Students $1. Child-12years n below is free). Is free for locals till 31st August 2015.

It is a hot day and very fortunately, there were water dispensers along the garden.

7 things to do n see:
1. Burkill Hall - historical landmark, built in 1868, colonial plantation style house. Host to VIP events n private functions.

2. VIP Orchid Garden- featuring orchid hybrids named after visiting state dignitaries. Hybrid named after late Mr Lee Kuan Yew is displaying in the Burkill
Hall.

3. Celebrity Orchid Garden- Hybrids r named after celebrities to commemorate their visit,like Jackie Chan n Andrea Bocelli.

4. Vanda Miss Joaquim-our national flower

5. Tan Hoon Siang Mist house
6. Yuen Peng McNeice Bromeliad Collection- featuring unusual exotic plants from Central n South America
7. Cool House- my personal thinking,this is just a place for you to cool down during hot weather.

Overall,have agreat experience here as there r many unique hybrids to be seen here. Find the 'peach orchid' very unique n beautiful as it is pinkish among the whites."

,,This flower hating curmudgeon loved it,5.0,,I am not normally a fan of Orchids and I loathe heat and humidity yet I would go back here in a heart beat. So many lovely flowers with great signs.

,,National Orchid Garden,5.0,,"A beautiful garden with various areas of floral, tree and shrub specialties plus an excellent are for a wide variety of orchids"
,,Beautiful but overestimated..,3.0,,"We went there, as it was rated no1 on tripadvisor. It was very beautiful but I think it was not worth it, as we just stayed only 3 days in Singapore, there were much better things to do. It was too tiring also, because we riched there through the wrong gate, so we had to cross all the botanical gardens. Nevertheless, you should go if you are super fan of flowers."
,,Just stunning,5.0,,These gardens were a highlight of my visit. Stunning orchids arranged in a beautiful way and the amount of different species and colours was outstanding. Great for an afternoon relax and unwind if you enjoy flowers

,,"Orchids were numerous, beautiful and interesting. Complemented Rain Forest Garden",5.0,,Took the Saturday tour and would highly recommend anyone to choose the tour if available (only $5.00 and admission is free). Plan to bring visitors here and discover other gardens
,,A flower lover's heaven,5.0,,"Well, this is the number one place to visit in Singapore, and I am not surprised one little bit. If you love flowers then all I can say is that this place will absolutely blow your mind. In fact I never realised that you could actually do so much with one species of plant than they did here, and to be honest with you they managed to do it and do it really, really well. Okay, I really can't say anything more than what many, many others have already said, and my review of this place is going to be lost amongst the 5000 odd reviews of this place, but I simply cannot go past and not put my own thoughts down, especially since I am a writer and I am compelled to write about as much as possible. So, if you are in Singapore, then take the time to come and visit this place because you will not be disappointed."
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,"This is my 3rd visit to the National Orchid Garden, I get completely mesmerised by the different colours, shapes and patterns of the orchids.

,,Amazing,5.0,,"Part of the Singapore Botanic Gardens you pay $5 to enter the Orchid Garden.It is great value for money and the orchids are truly stunning.It's all set out in a beautiful setting and is well worth paying a visit.We spent a total of 4hrs wondering around the Botanic Gardens in all as the orchid garden is just a small part of this magnificent place.
It is amazing go and see it."
,,A piece of heaven,5.0,,"an amazingly well made, very organized, a piece of heaven place if you like plants and flowers. They have many kinds or orchid roses that you never knew existed. The major garden area is free admission but the orchid garden is with a very minimum feee. a lot of walking to enjoy nature and a lot of photo taking spots.
get your camera ready as you will enjoy photo shooting with vibrant colours of nature
There is also a nice restaurant i am not sure by which entrance as i got lost a bit trying to find my way out.
make sure you read the pamphlet, you are not supposed to touch any plants because they might be poisonous or harmful to you.
There is accessible walkways for handicapped people or children strollers all the way throughout the garden.
not many beverage or icecream shops around so make sure you carry your water or buy it whenever you get the chance as Singapore is very humid and you can get dehydrated easily.
a great experience for the family to enjoy flowers, trees, nature, pounds and the whole garden.
As usual in Singapore, no smoking areas at the garden, and it was also very tricky finding any place to smoke at all even outside!!"

,,Orchids a plenty,4.0,,"I didn't realise this was located within the Botanical Gardens but we decided to pay $5.00 entry to go for a wander and view that different varieties of orchids. It was great to see. I feel it's one of those things that once, it's done, it's done and you don't really need to go out. All orchid'd out! :)"
,,Beautiful Flowers,5.0,,"With the orchid being the National flower of Singpore, this is a great place to come see them. Quite cheap and easy to walk around with lots to see. Well worth the visit, as it's only S$5."

,,Lots of Common Orchids,5.0,,"Senior Citizen entry ticket (older than 60 yrs old) is only SG$1.00 so it was great for us. Most of the orchids are very common varieties, although there are some rare hybrids also. There are masses and masses of orchids, so even though they are common orchids, the presentation is beautiful and well worth the price of entry."
,,Oasis of Orchids,5.0,,"This garden within the botanical garden was a rare treat. I confess that orchids are one of my most favourite plants so to see so many varieties in one place was fab. The garden seems quite small on entrance but was actually big and we were there for some time. There is a small entrance fee.

However be warned there are no refreshments sold in the garden so on a hot day take water in. There are toilets though.

This is a must do for plant lovers or just anyone who loves nature in all it's pretty forms."
,,Wonderful place by the Botanic Garden,5.0,,"Beautiful garden, excellent explanations. I would recommend spending at least a couple of hours. The nearby Botanic Gardens are also worth a visit."

,,"A verdant oasis, worth revisits to rest and relax.",4.0,,"The normal entrance fee is S$5 to visit the garden. As its free entry for the National Jubilee month, throngs of visitors, locals and tourists swamped the garden during the long Jubilee weekend. If not for the teeming crowds, the garden should be a tranquil setting for a relaxing stroll among the varied and colorful hybrids of orchids. There are plentiful photo-taking opportunities amidst the blooming plants and flowers. You will be amazed by the varied breeds of orchids on display in their full glory in the sun. Fascinating nature at its best. If you care to explore, you may find tiny pineapples being grown as well among the shrubs! In the verdant oasis, you will find airplants streaming down wistfully in the carefully manicured garden. Of particular interest is a Cool Walk corridor, glass-cased, misty, moist and cool for particular breeds of the orchids. Lovely experience in the short walk through the corridor. The orchid garden is worth revisits to discover any new hybrids of orchids and to unwind. I guess an entry fee will deter the crowds and make your visits more enjoyable!"

Another visit, I found that i can appreciate more. there are lot of orchids species in the garden and it definitely a great walk in the garden.

,,Worth a visit,5.0,,The entrance fee $5 per person is so reasonable. The orchid garden is a lot bigger now and you should allow more time to go around looking at each orchid spieces.

We took our time wondering through the garden, which meant that the temperature got hotter and hotter. Try to go in the morning!"

It is a very beautiful garden inside the Botanic Garden, itself very nicely set up as well. When we first visited Botanic Garden, we went strait to the Orchid Garden first as we knew it was rather big. After the orchids, you still can rest in other areas of the Botanic Garden, on the lawn, under shades...

The variety of orchids is large if you have seldom seen orchids, and the display is beautiful and well thought, We visited the Orchid Garden when my son was only 4 years old. Some fountains and few statues of animals kept him from getting bored too soon, hopefully... Wear hat and bring water, the garden is of decent size and there is not much shade. I strongly recommand a visit to this beautiful place."

,,Really fascinating and beautiful place to visit. Highly recommended.,5.0,,"This was a whistle stop tour as I had only a couple of hours in the morning before my flight, so I got there as soon as it opened. Quite a long walk back to the underground (I got a taxi there) but it's through the botanic gardens so pretty.

Some really fascinating and beautiful orchids here (no kidding - there were orchids?!) and as it was quite early it wasn't too hot and it was pretty quiet. Lots of orchids have been grown especially for famous people/royalty etc and it was interesting to see how many I recognised such as Princess Diana and Margaret Thatcher. If you like orchids or even just pretty flowers, this is a really nice place to walk round and relax in. Not very expensive either! Nice gift shop at the tend too!"

Well, I am not a Botanist nor do I have extensive, indepth knowledge about orchidaceae at all, but I know a beauty when I spot one - and they were all worthy beauties coming in different forms and colours. These lovely hues and nature's gifts made us forget about the hot sweltering sun totally.

There were the arches, the VIP sections, a bridge, cool house etc to heighten the flowers viewing process.

,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I'm not really a ""flower person"" but I thought the orchids were beautiful. If you're in Singapore you have to visit this garden."
,,Stunning,5.0,,it was superb but the distance for my mother in law to walk was too far in the humidity/heat. the floral displays were definitely worth the effort to walk to but a travel cart for my mother in law would have assisted or more park benches in shade for her to wait on
,,gorgeous place,5.0,,"Stunning attention to detail, special, well set out, absolutely breath taking to see, great day out ,"
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,The most beautiful part of the botanic gardens and for people who enjoy the beauty of nature I think the National Orchid Garden is the best spot to visit in Singapore. An extremely wide variety of orchids all in their different sizes/shapes and colors.

,,Flowers everywhere,5.0,,"There is a small fee to visit this attraction but it is a bargain when you see what you get. So many wonderful orchids to look at and in such good condition.
Be prepared to spend time as it would be a crime to rush around and not take in the wonderful plants which are displayed so well.
All members of the same plant family, but so very different in shape and colour. Definitely not to be missed during your Singapore visit."

I am not a big fan of flowers but I like it because of thr variety and the colours of the orchids."
,,"Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful.",5.0,,There is a small fee to enter the orchid garden. I never knew there were so many types of orchids. They range in size and color and the way they're displayed within the large garden area is amazing. Don't forget your camera because you will be snapping lots of photographs.
,,Beautiful Orchids,5.0,,"We took the metro to the Botanical Gardens, the stop is adjacent to the entrance. It's free to enter the Botanical Gardens and there is a small admission cost to the orchids but this is well worthwhile as there are so many different varieties all beautifully planted in the large gardens."
,,Best orchid garden ever,5.0,,"Easily accessible within the botanic gardens. It host an abundance of species, arranged in a very spectacular way. It has various sections, cold house, steam house. The best orchid garden I visited ever. Requires an 1 hr to walk around, easily accessible from the city centre with underground train."
,,Quite a lot of diffferent Orchids,4.0,,Wonderful place for family with kids. The garden is quite big and has a lot of varieties of orchids. It is inside the Botanic Garden and can easily spend a few hours with the Botanic Garden.
,,Flowers all in a row,5.0,,It was amazing to see so many kinds of orchids growing together. If you like flowers and gardens this is a great place to visit. Its a good 5 mins walk from the entrance to the orchid gardens but its worth it. Very good place for pictures as well
,,Fabulous,4.0,,The Orchid Gardens are just amazing. You can see all different types of orchids and wander around at your leisure.
,,Beautiful orchids,5.0,,Even if you are not a botanist you will enjoy the orchid gardens. They even a coolhouse where mountain orchids grow. For students it is only 1dollar.

few minutes spent relaxing in this garden I had an orchid garden in my back yard in Kaneohe, HI, as I was growing up so I did not expect to be taken so dramatically by the beauty of this garden. You will thoroughly love the time spent here."

,,Absolutely a must see,5.0,,"Amazing to see the number and variety of orchids here. They are beautiful and an absolute ""must see"" for any visitor to Singapore. This is a garden within the Botanic Garden which is free to visitors, but there is a very nominal fee to enter the Orchid Garden. I typically don't go gaga over flowers but this was an exception."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"It costs 5 sing dollars to visit the orchid garden and it's well worth the money. Plan on spending at least one hour if you want to enjoy the whole area but can easily spend more time. Morning ours are recommended as it will not be too hot and the light is ""softer"" for photos."
,,Wondeful orchid overload for the orchid lover,5.0,,"I thoroughly enjoyed this visit to the Botanical garden. The orchid section is a 'must see' as orchids and Singapore are so closely associated. An interesting VIP section of the orchid garden describes the use of orchid diplomacy as a Singaporean tactic for welcoming international political figures and celebrities and the orchids named in their honor are truly spectacular. The orchids that are most plentiful are in the vanda family. In addition, there are dendrobiums and oncydia. On the other hand, the most common variety in N. America, the phaelanopsis are not commmon here, understandable given the climate differences.
The best time to go is in the AM, the garden opens at 0830, since the heat will be challenging to most visitors later in the day. The orchid garden is the must see, I believe. The cost is $5 and very reasonable for what you see. It is only $1 if you are a senior (>60 years). In addition, because this is Singapore's 50th year as an independent country, there is a wonderful free display of orchids which provides a great representation of what is seen in the garden."
,,Feast for the senses,5.0,,"2nd visit her in past few years. LOVE it (and I'm not even a flower power person). My Mum, 70's, who adores gardens was amazed by the botanical gardens and thoroughly enjoyed our 9am to 1:30pm romp through most of the botanical gardens including majority of time at the National Orchid Garden. This really is something to see - a feast for the senses."
,,Dont miss the Orchids,5.0,,A must see.......if you like orchids you will love the national orchid gardens which is in the singapore botanical gardens....makes my orchids look pretty poor.
,,Botanic beauty,5.0,,"Beside lots of orchids, there are different kinds of plants that you will see the first time. Their design, the lakes and waterfalls are beautiful too.

There are special orchids that smell good. They send those orchids to Queen Elizabeth sometimes.

Because of hot and lots of water, the garden has lots of humid but there is a ""cold room"" which they contain different kinds of plants. It is not so big but it is a life saver in hot weather."
,,Great Place for Learning Journeys,5.0,,"My students had a good time walking around the garden. They were enthralled by the beautiful flowers and greatly surprised by the large varieties of orchids found there. They also learnt some information about the flowers.

However, the place is not actually meant for a large group of students to walk together. If I had more students, there might be a problem.

There wasn't that many spots for photo-taking as well"

,,"Orchid heaven for orchid lovers, maybe",3.0,,"Unless you are a fan of orchids or have never seen an orchid flower in your life, you will very likely marvel at this attraction. I am not a big fan orchids, this seems just like a larger (by a great magnitude) orchid garden than my mother's. It houses many exotic, both breathtaking and peculiar looking orchids , and pitcher plants too! Enjoy your visit"
,,Nice but few blooms,3.0,,"The orchid garden was nice worth visit, but was it amazing No! We went as part of tour very busy difficult to get a turn for pics also although told over thousand species only 3 or 4 varieties in bloom, again there was just few plants in one place so did not get that WOW factor, just "" yeah its nice"" .Would I be sorry if I had not seen it NO."

,,Natures beauty shines thru,5.0,,"Although there is a minimal fee - S$5 or S$1 for over 60's = it is worth the price to see the beautiful and multi coloured display of orchids - This is one of those must sees in Singapore although some younger ones may find it tiring but they can have a great time lakeside feeding fish .
This Orchid Garden takes up to 2- 3 hours to get around properly - thats without the rest of the botanical gardens.
Bring your camera as the photo opps are numerous."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"This is a wonderful flower area in Singapore Botanic Garden! So beautiful and arise great feelings! This area contains different orchids of various kinds, shapes and colours."

,,A break for the fast paced city.,4.0,,"Very beautiful, but kids found it hard going in the heat. There were lots of spots for taking photos and lots to appreciate."
,,Worth every dollar,5.0,,Entry is just 5SGD and is very good value at the price. The Orchid Gardens are located within the free to enter Singapore Botanical Gardens and add massively to the overall experience of the visit. You can get the visit done in about an hour but you can easily stay in for a few hours to sit and take it all in. Not to be missed.
,,Beautiful mix of natural beauty and history,5.0,,"Located in the Botanical Gardens (accessible by SMRT, taxi, and bus), the National Orchird Gardens is a paid exhibit that is beautiful and well worth a visit.

If you arrive by SMRT, you will have to cross the length of the gardens to visit the National Orchid Garden. It is pleasant walk and not very steep.

You can get a map and have a meal at the various eateries located next to the several visitor centres around the Botanical Gardens.

Bathrooms are EVERYWHERE, and water fountains too (something you don't come by everywhere in Singapore). They are clean and dry.

It is reasonably priced and if you are a student (high school, college, university), do bring your student card as the fare for students is only $1. Even though we didn't think to bring our student IDs to Singapore, we got the student fare as well, thanks to the very friendly receptionists.

There are many people painting and sketching all around (inside and outside) of the orchid garden. If you're a nature art enthusiast, this place is a splendid muse.

It's lovely for photographers as well, because the beautifully and meticulously tended paradise does the work for you. Blindfold yourself and aim your camera anywhere and you'll still get gorgeous photographs (in a way ;).

Even at midday, the weather is bearable. Do drinks loads of water as you WILL sweat. Singapore's climate is equatorial and humid, after all.

There are many benches and shades around the orchid garden.

There will be some ""uphill and downhill"" walking, so take it slowly if you must. The garden is located on sloped ground.

The garden is mostly wheelchair accessible and the paths are broad and well built.

Everything is beautiful and immersive. You are constantly surrounded by vines, trees, and shrubs.

There are many, many colourful varieties of orchids and various interesting attractions (fountains, celebrity orchirds, sundials) besides the largest attractions (the misty section, cool room and ancient Burkhill house in particular).

Burkhill house is black and white. There is some historical information printed inside and outside, and you can peruse the main room on the ground floor. I thought it very well preserved for such an old building (1860s!), the oldest building in the UNESCO World Heritage-recognized park. The upstairs is off-limits but you really get to walk about and appreciate the well-sized and airy colonial bungalow and how it sits so congruously and pleasantly in its (literally) blossoming surroundings.

The cool room with its miniature waterfall is a very relaxing stop, reminiscent of the misty and high-altitude tropical forests, covered with moss and ferns, that I have visited in actual tropical highlands. There are unique carnivorous pitcher-like plants as well, so if you want a taste of jungle exploration, it's very authentic!

All around the orchid garden there are plaques, description, and tags on plants. SO many varieties of orchids of all shapes and sizes.

On your way in or out, you can stop to buy a canned drink (coke, pepsi, etc.) at the vending machines for $1, which is a good price. Do note that the vending machine buttons are in Mandarin, but are easy to follow nonetheless.

Finally, there is an interesting gift-shop with many pretty souvenirs (gold, batik, orchid seedlings, key chains, instant (freeze-dried?) Singaporean dishes) to take home.

Of course all tourists will rave about this first-class, lovingly tended garden imbued in every corner with Singaporean national pride."
,,beautiful,4.0,,Very nice outdoor garden. It is beautiful and easy to get to. Plan to spend at least an hour so you can have a tranquil easy walk through the garden.
,,Stunning collection,5.0,,Beautiful collection of orchids beautifully presented. Go early or late to avoid the heat and take a camera to snap pictures - the orchids are very photogenic.

When special dignitaries visit the Gardens an orchid is named after them and a plaque inserted at the orchid. This made it even more interesting seeing who had visited and had orchids named after them. If you don't tolerate the heat well, then the orchid garden would be a top priority. To see all the gardens, it is preferable to spend at least half a day there and start early in the day before it gets hot."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden is part of the Singapore Botanical Garden. It is located towards the southwest of the Botanical Gardens. MRT Station at north end of Botanical Gardens, about a 20 min walk to Orchid garden. Rembember, the walk is in the Botanical Garden so very pleasant.
It can be very hot as most of it is in the sun. Bring hat.
I very much loved the experience and will do it again if I go to Singapore again.

,,Pleasant way to see the many varieties of orchids in Botanic Gardens,3.0,,"The entry to the National Orchid Garden is free for Singaporeans and Singapore PRs for a limited period of time, I believe so we went straight in as otherwise we normally bypass this attraction (not being willing to pay the entry fee).

The smaller blooms were actually more interesting than the big ""showy"" orchids that one normally sees in the office foyers in Singapore. Well worth a visit if you love orchids.

Take the time to slowly wander around and appreciate the delicate blooms. Worth visiting."

I live less than 1km from this truly delightful blaze of colour and will visit at least six times a year when we have visitors to stay.

Take the time to see yourself, you wont by dissapointed."

,,Worth the effort to get there,5.0,,"We have visited before but there are always new species to see. Orchids absolutely beautiful and the setting relaxing after the hectic downtown area. A welcome oasis in the concrete jungle and congested traffic of nearby Orchard Road. The Botanic a Gardens not easy to reach by public transport as still a lot of walking in the Singapore heat to get there. Suggest a taxi instead, $7.50 from Chinatown as an example. However, to leave you may need to join a queue and wait, about half an hour on a weekday for us."

Once again a great and more enjoyable experience."

I exercise at Botanical Garden often and whenever there is free entry to the National Orchid Garden, I will include it in my walk as it is so refreshing to admire the beautiful orchids."

Saw a few people pulling roots, leaves, stalks of flowers just for a nicer picture or just because. It's upsetting to see this kind of behavior yet most of the plants were still very beautiful and we could take many wonderful pictures. Good job and well done to the folks maintaining the Gardens. This place is generally pram friendly with seating available for older folks to take it easy."

,,Stunning garden,5.0,,A beautifully maintained garden not just for the horticulturists! I visited as part of a bus tour but it would have been good to spend a bit more time here. Lots of photo opportunities.
,,Great place for Orchid lover,5.0,,"If travel by own cars or taxi, please park near the drop off point for Ginger garden, else parking at main entrance will need you to walk ~10-15 mins to the Orchid Garden entrance."

,,Wonderful.,5.0,,Spent a day here. There are signs everywhere to guide people to the right places. The Orchid Gardens are a highlight. Just make sure to carry a bottle of water as a lot of walking in humid temperatures is involved.
,,Spectacular arrays of colours,5.0,,"A large garden within the Botanic Gardens, with so many orchid varieties of all sizes and colours. The garden is a maze of paths leading to beautiful displays of flowers, including a clever recreation of a cool mountain environment. Very beautiful."

,,"A serene, beautiful place",5.0,,"Part of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the National Orchid Garden is a place of unparalleled beauty with a spectacular range of orchids. Photographers will be tantalized every step of the way around the gardens. The size of the gardens mitigates the number of visitors and only occasionally is a visitor even aware of other guests."
,,Beautiful display,5.0,,"Every time I visit Singapore I must revisit this attraction because the display of orchids is so beautiful.

As I'm over 60 years of age I just produce a photo copy of my passport and am charged only S$1.00 to enter, however I feel that even at the normal fee of S$5.00, it is extremely good value.

You must have patience though as the footpaths get somewhat clogged up with people hoping to get that perfect photo."
,,Beautiful informative and hot!,5.0,,"Cant 4 star them for being hot, but prepare for the heat. They do have lots of air conditioned spaces and shaded areas. Great for couples or families, can easily spend a few hrs there and grab a bite before, or after hitting the botanic gardens."

The experience was however marred by the throng of tourists posing left, right and centre to take selfies, group portraits, etc. I thoroughly recommed coming early in the morning so you don't have to continually weave through sightlines."
,,Tropical paradise,5.0,,"Singapore is so built-up and busy, it's really refreshing to escape from the hustle and bustle for a couple of hours, and the National Orchid Garden provides the perfect sanctuary! The botanic gardens are a lovely, relaxing escape in themselves but the orchid gardens are definitely the highlight. There is a charge to enter, but it's reasonable (SGD5) and definitely worthwhile.

There are an abundance of tropical, colourful orchids amongst water features, arbours and meandering pathways - it's an absolute oasis away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore.

You can have a lovely wander around (allow 30 mins if you're a normal tourist or more if you're an orchid afficionado) then pop over to Halia for a relaxing (although not particularly cheap) lunch on the alfresco terrace overlooking the botanic gardens' ginger garden."
,,Nice Way to Spend an Hour or Two,5.0,,For $5 you can see thousands of orchids and varieties. I've been in there twice and it's just something I haven't ever experienced before. I probably wouldn't go back again on my own but when I have visitors this will be a place we visit for sure. It's not huge but large enough that I feel like you get your money's worth.
,,Beautiful Orchid Garden,5.0,,"Went with my 90+ grandparents with wheelchairs. Easy access for them but the garden is not flat, so it can get pretty tiring trying to push them around.
There were many varieties on display with their names clearly marked.
Very well-maintained also.
We got in for free as the admission fee for the Garden is waived for Singaporeans till the end of August 2015. But still worth the trip if an admission fee was charged!"

,,Beautiful orchids and great variety,4.0,,The Orchid Garden is located within the free Botanical Garden. You have to pay a small admission fee but it's worth it to see the huge numbers of orchids on display. I went in December so there was a holiday motif on display as well. It's a beautiful place to see the different varieties of orchids including some attributed to famous celebrities and to take pictures.
,,Beautiful place to visit,5.0,,The gardens were absolutely stunning to view. There was a vast display of orchids in full bloom which were truly magnificent to see. We took many wonderful pictures on the day we visited. Only five Singaporean dollars to visit also.

,,Feel Fresh,4.0,,Very nice place for the tourists who tired from the crowed and busy environment. Beautiful garden and feel fresh. Very good.
,,Worth the Entrance Fee!,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is located inside the Singapore Botanical Gardens. Unlike the Botanical Gardens which is free for visitors, the Orchid garden has a S$ 5 fee ($1 for Singapore students and senior citizens). And it's the best 5 dollars we spent on our trip!

We were planning to visit the place for about an hour, and ended up spending over 3 hours in the Orchid Garden alone. With over a thousand species and 60,000 orchid plants, the place is a veritable explosion of colors. The orchids were segregated into four separate zones based on the four seasons. The splendor of these lovely flowers was worth every minute of our stay, and filled us up with wonder and awe at the sheer diversity of the flora and fauna on display.

The weather was great, neither too hot nor too sunny, and boy! did we do some serious walking! If you love flowers and like walking, don't even think of giving this one a miss!"

Even our national flower is a rare species locally called ""Monja Blanca"". Nonetheless, the National Orchid Garden in Singapore was the best I've ever seen! Thousands of orchid species are displayed in impeccably manicured gardens. Even if you're not particularly knowledgeable about plants or flowers you are bound to be impressed by the size and beauty of the place."
,,Blooming Garden,4.0,,Our visit opened up our eyes to many varieties of orchids that we had never known existed. Just a pleasurable visit as we were surrounded by flowers at every angle we turned. Great therapeutic walk for people who need to de-stress.

,,More than Orchids,5.0,,"If the beauties of nature fulfill you more than shopping, than The Orchid Garden is a must. It is absolutely amazing - so many extraordinary flowers, smells, plants and trees, and so well groomed!
Its a great place to spend a few hours away from the Singapore frensy. Even our children (6 and 9) were extatic... After a 2 hours visit, we first had a delicious bite at the great restaurant and then strolled through the East part of the Botanical Garden, went alongside the beautiful lake (were one can buy food for feeding turtles&fishes) and even met two of those hudge asian lizards.
If you have only one day in Singapore and love nature, go there in the morning and than to the refreshing Gardens by the bay (the Cloud Forest). Then don't forget to go have a look at the view of the city from the 57th floor of the Marina BaySands Hotel!"

The Cool House, located within the Orchid Garden, is a welcome respite after the Singapore heat.
There is a charge for the garden ($5 for adults, children under 12 free), but I thought is was well worth it."
,,"If you love Orchid's, you'll love this place",5.0,,Located in the Botanic Gardens but requires paid entry to this specialised display. It's well worth the fee and even better if your over 60! Superb displays of well tended plants. Lots of information. Plants clearly labelled. Take a plentiful supply of water with you as you will need several hours to do the plants and garden justice in this corner of the Botanic gardens. Also have a tube of anthisan bite & sting cream handy for the odd insect sting.
,,Mesmerized by the beauty of orchids,5.0,,"Few months back we went to the Singapore Botanic Gardens and had a chance to the view the National Orchid garden. I was really fascinated by the blooming of orchids with different flora and colours. The landscaping in the Orchid garden will drive you to look for more species of orchids. Me, biologist by profession truly admired the number of species maintained here. Hats off to the people who did this. If your camera is ready for beautiful shots with loved ones , this is one of the finest places."
,,awesome,4.0,,"The Garden is located on the highest hill in the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Providing a place for 60,000 orchid plants - consisting of 1000 species and more than 2,000 hybrids - is the three hectares of carefully landscaped slopes.

The design concept presenting the display of plants in four separate color zones: the spring zone with its prevailing colours of bright and lively shades of gold, yellow and creams; the summer zone with its major tones of strong reds and pinks; the autumn zone of matured shades; and the winter zone of whites and cool blues. A careful combination of selected trees, shrubs, herbs and orchids (mostly hybrids) with matching foliage and floral colours depicts the colour combination."
,,"very warm, less orchids than I expected!",3.0,,"I have got to say, back in my home country far away from singapore our green houses in the botanical garden held far more orchids. Is it the time of year? A wrong turn? Or the fact I was exhausted from the long walk from the SMRT station (no taxis available) and what seemed like an underwhelming orchid display that turned me off. Still a lovely place and I really enjoyed the orchids present. Why not go once? The guy at the entrance was really fabulous. University students can enter for $1, the whole botanical garden is free!"

,,A must for Orchid lovers,5.0,,"Clearly the conditions are right for orchids in Singapore, and the garden is located within the Botanical Gardens - a new UNESCO site - which just means there is so much more to see than just the orchids. If you get frustrated - like me - with a personal collection of orchids that have become a collection of sticks, you need to see this place."
,,As an orchid lover I fgound this most comprehensive and beautiful collection of orchards that I've ever seen..,5.0,,Huge displays of each species and arranged by type and location. Very good signage with lots of information on each species
,,Not rated the best attraction for nothing!,5.0,,"This is beautifully planned, maintained garden. It is also one of the few places in Singapore you can enjoy for free! The ginger garden and the rainforest areas are well worth the walk. Make sure to be armed with a bottle of water, of even better get there in the early hours of the morning!"
,,Go there even if you're not into Orchids,5.0,,It's a really nice garden with gorgeous orchids. I liked the garden with the orchids that are named after famous people.
,,must see in Singapore,5.0,,"just an awesome park. try to avoid Sundays - most probably will be overcrowded, but even then - still worth a visit"
,,Beauty first hand,5.0,,What an exotic place to stroll around. Take water as humid of course. Also take your camera as very colourful pix to take of orchids and scenery and make sure you get yourself in some of the pix too!! Nice café to relax in for a coffee or cool drink. Well worth going there.

,,National Orchid Garden,4.0,,We only had a very short visit to the National Orchid Garden. More time should be spent here to appreciate the beautiful flowers.
,,Its hot,4.0,,The gardens are fabulous but keep drinking water. There are many garden walks and I just kept clicking my camera.
,,Colorful,4.0,,"This is the only garden in the park that has an entrance fee, but for a few dollars, it is worth it. Orchids come in so many shapes and colors, so many more than I imagined. It's a lovely way to spend a few hours wandering around the lovely layout and finding the species with the most creative names."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I consider myself a grade C horticulturist so this blew me away. I reside in humid Florida and I can't make an orchid live past one bloom.
A volunteer tour guide walked us through the park and explained each of the plantings and gave us a background on their natural habitat. She refused to take money - rare event in tourist areas.

,,A Nice Quiet Oasis in the Heart of Singapore,4.0,,"We chose to go with a tour group to this attraction. It was clean, quiet and serene and it had a good variety of orchids and other flora that are quite colorful and exquisite. The fee was reasonable and is worth it.

,,Screen saver heaven,5.0,,"Loved it. My 11yr old daughter and Icaught the train to the Botanical Garden MRT stop arriving around 9.00am. So we had to meander through the park to the Orchid garden. Hot but great to stretch your legs.
Cooled down in the air conditioned shop for 5mins, bought water at the Info centre and paid $SD5 entry or Orchid Garden (kids under 12 free)... then went snappy happy. So many photo ops and beautiful flowers. Make a rest stop at excellent toilets at back of VIP Orchids building and refill your water bottle at the water cooler there.
More photos in Orchidarium then refreshed down in Cool house.
We headed through the rest of the park to Tanglin gate and lashed out on $7 taxi back to hotel. (After air conditioning cool down in shop :))
TIPS: Arrive early to miss tour bus grps. Miss the Bonsai garden (ordinary) & Franipani garden (not flowering in July).
I have a stunning choice of orchid screen savers on my phone now."

Please be aware the orchids are flowers and they do not blossom all year round all at once!!!"
,,Beautiul park.,5.0,,"Another great way to get into some shade and take some great pictures of orchids, Swan Lake and various plant life.

The Palm Valley is situated ""in the middle"" of the Botanic Gardens -you will need to take a walk into the Palm Valley - when you enter the Gardens via the Main Gate - along Napier/Holland Road.

For orchid lovers - the National Orchid Garden is a feast for the eyes - a kind of haven as you will see many different species of orchids - and enjoy the colour myriad of display of orchids as you enter this Garden (there is an entrance fee - do check it out the entrance fees at the Reception area),

Watch for humming birds and lizards too, we saw a few which I pictured.

It gets very hot and humid in Singapore (it's like a sauna that never ends) so try to get there early to be done before it gets really hot around 12-3. The botanical gardens open around 5:30am, so I would recommend taking a taxi there (they are cheap) early in the morning and waking around for a bit, then doing the orchid gardens.

Happy travels!"

Beautiful flowers (many different shapes and colors!), nice photo spots created throughout the garden (might feel a little touristy as well but you have nice pictures in the end), well maintained. We followed the route indicated on the Botanical garden website, it takes you through almost the entire garden without missing out on much or having to walk back. Although you can't do much wrong with just walking around yourself.
I liked the part with the flowers for famous people and the delicate orchid the best, so be sure to pass by.
Don't expect 100 flowers per square meter because then you'll be disappointed.
The entire garden takes about an hour."

,,"Beautiful, well organized and maintained gardens",5.0,,"I knew before coming to Singapore that I wanted to visit the Botanical Gardens and also the National Orchid Gardens within the Botanical Gardens. I was definitely not disappointed. I paid the SGD$5 entrance fee and off I went to wander around. The flowers are absolutely beautiful and every now and then a whiff of sweet fragrance floats past your nose. The entire gardens are beautiful and worth checking out, but my two favourites were the cool room and the mist house. I was lucky that I was able to go during the day, during the week, so it wasn't very busy and I had time to thoroughly admire the flowers. As others have mentioned though, it does get VERY hot and humid. I'm very glad I had the foresight to bring 2 L of water! They have fountains on site so you can refill your bottle if you need to.
Afterwards, I had a stroll through the Botanical Gardens. Also very well maintained and a lot of variety in the types of plants/trees/vines they had. My favourite parts were the marsh garden beside Swan Lake and the Ginger Garden. Don't be surprised if you see a few large lizards roaming around and a flock of dragonflies!
In conclusion, if you have a few hours of time, go check this out! It is well worth the time and money."

There is a wonderful large collection of orchids, some are hybrids, arranged in landscaped gardens, joined to the Botanic Gardens.

,,Beautiful orchids but take the bus,5.0,,We had a lovely visit to the National Orchid Garden. When we got there. Please note it's easiest to take a bus from Orchard MRT station exit B to the Tanglin agate entrance of the Botanical Gardens. This is close to the orchid garden and only takes about 15 minutes at the most. We mistakenly took the MRT to Botanic gardens station on the Circle line which is great if you want to walk through the beautiful gardens for 1.5km to the orchids. It was lovely but not what we had planned.
,,most beatiful spot in singapore,5.0,,"we got lucky becouse the wheater was perfect and most of the orchids were blooming,if you like flowers ,thi is your place."
,,Flowers,5.0,,Orchids growing in abundance. The only problem is the distance from the entrance to the orchid garden.

,,Stunning garden - well worth the visit,5.0,,"We arrived here by bus via the Tanglin gate, so had a walk through the gardens to get here. Paid our $5pp admission fee (worth the price) and started our walk around these gardens. I had downloaded the Singapore Botanic Gardens App for my phone which help guide us and give information on areas to visit and historical facts.

The orchids were beautiful (even for non-flower lovers like my hubbie) with stunning specimens. I especially loved the Tan Hoon Siang Mist house which contained some rare orchids and cool house with its little collection of carnivore plants.

A must visit when you are in the Botanic Gardens."
,,Interesting and varied collection and each with a story to tell,4.0,,"Great collection of genuine and hybrid orchids, many off them developed and named in honour of special visitors to Singapore: British and international royalty, foreign dignitaries and other famous people, arranged in landscaped gardens adjoining the Botanic gardens.

,,A day in the park,5.0,,When in Singapore it is worth a trip to the National Orchid Garden. There are some fantastic specimens with great photo opportunities
,,Always in flower,5.0,,"We always make sure we make time for a trip to the Botanic Gardens and the National Orchid Garden whenever we visit Singapore. The walk from Orchard Rd isn't too far, but you may want to use the MRT (get off at the Botanic Gardens stop). If choosing the latter you'll have to walk about 1.3 km through the Gardens to the Orchids. Arrive early to both avoid crowds and to catch the orchids at their best - particularly on hot days"

,,You will not find better,5.0,,This must be the best Orchid collection in the world. Nothing to dislike and a credit to all concerned.

,,Lovely,5.0,,A bit crowded because it is a hit with the locals and not too expensive. But the flowers are first rate. I'm not a huge flower guy (went for my wife) but they are stunning. I really found myself appreciating not just the beauty but the various climates and locations which they thrive. Pretty cool.
,,do not hesitate to visit if you love flowers,3.0,,"A special garden within the botanic gardens (with its own 5 SGD entry fee) with an overwhelming amount of orchids (60'000 plants, according to Wikipedia). Carefully maintained and well-kept, it doesn't offer too many hidden surprises... except that one of the orchids is named after Margaret Tthatcher!
You can walk around in less than an hour, or spend half a day sitting on a bench and enjoying the relaxing surroundings."
,,Wonderful!,5.0,,The National Orchid Garden covers quite a large area within the Singapore Botanic Gardens. It is the only bit of the gardens that changes an admission fee (a very modest fee). It is well worth it for the extensive collection which is beautifully laid-out and presented.

,,A-must-visit place in Singapore,4.0,,Low price ticket. Maybe it's only a common Orchid Garden in tropical countries (that you could see the same or less as in another tropical countries) but it's beautiful and worth visiting.
,,Much better than Marina Bay etc,5.0,,Put this collection right on the top of your list. For start it is in the National Botanic Garden which is worth a visit anyway for its variety of different garden areas. The various orchid displays are simply stunning including special mist and cool house ones. Allow at least a couple of hours for the Gardens plus the Orchid Collection.

,,Where can you go for 50p,5.0,,As seniors it cost us 50p each to get into the Orchid Garden which has moved to a more convenient place for visitors which is along side the Botanic Gardens. The Orchids are just amazing and the gardens are immaculately kept. There are lots of places to take a breather from the heat and humidity and to take some photo's. Walk back to the Tanglin Gate exit along the river path to see the Swans Koi Carp and various other fish.
,,Beautiful Varieties of Orchids,5.0,,"It's my first visit to National Orchid Garden in Singapore this morning. Always interested in the growth of orchids and its many varieties, plus my parents love for floral garden have brought us there.

After some walking along the Singapore Botanic Garden, we reach. It is rather cooling as we reach the Orchid Garden at 8.30am. Not much crowds which allows us to stroll through, enjoy the beautiful fountain, the flowers close up and taking photos without any human in it. There are much varieties with names written along side. Plus, there is always shelters along the way so we can take a break, fill our water bottles or relax among the Orchids.

Be prepare for: Only issue is that I was wearing dark pants and mosquitos just love me, while my family members are in good shape. So be prepared to bring along mosquito spray or patches or avoid dark clothes. As the National Orchid Garden is kind of at the centre of the Singapore Botanic Garden, do allow some time to walk around, approximately 2 hrs to walk the garden, 20mins to reach there if you are coming by the Napier road. Bring umbrella if you come after 10am as the sun is out."
,,Gorgeous floral environment,5.0,,It's likely to rain on you if you spend more than an hour here. It's just how it is. But the orchids are breathtaking.
,,A must see!,5.0,,What a wonderful collection of orchids within the Singapore Botanic Gardens! The area is quite large with meandering paths that take you through countless views of lovely flowers and exquisite plants. It is worth the extra fee.
,,Just lovely,5.0,,"We liked the variety and ease of seeing close-up offlowers and displays, the set-up,easy strolling - everything was lovely"
,,National Orchard Garden,4.0,,"A truly wonderful experience with a huge variety of orchards and a wonderful array of colour, all in a very peaceful atmosphere. A great place to visit. Highly recommended."
,,Magnificient,5.0,,One of our best experiences in Singapore with so much history - beautifully managed gardens & so peaceful. Best idea is to go early & have breakfast in the cafe - it really is worthwhile spending the whole day here.
,,Great as part of the city tour,5.0,,Even in the torrential rain we enjoyed walking around the gardens and seeing the different orchids and rainforest plants. A wonderful part of the city tour.
,,Beautiful Orchids,5.0,,"Great place to stop into to take photos. The orchids here are really well tended to and they have cultivated several hybrids. The Orchid Garden is actually much bigger than you would expect, so be sure to explore the area and walk through the greenhouse. Admission is SG1 for students and children under 12 as well as senior citizens. It's SG5 for adults. Be sure to bring an umbrella, especially during the rainy season, because storms can pass by out of nowhere. I was stuck once by the covering at the entrance for an hour and a half because of a storm. Umbrellas are also useful when it's sunny, so there's no reason to not bring a small one. This is an excellent garden, probably the nicest and best maintained one that I've visited."
,,Lovely part of our trip to Singapore,5.0,,Not to be missed! A beautiful visit as part of our trip to Singapore. The garden is so well kept and the orchids are stunning.
,,Stunning Orchid Garden,5.0,,"Loved all the beautiful trees, fountains and flowers. watched all the people exercising under the trees."
,,Pretty as always,5.0,,That was my second time visit there. All the flowers were so pretty as I remembered. The orchid garden is one of those places you must visit when you go to Singapore.
,,"Excellent, do not miss",5.0,,"Part of the Botanic Gardens, just superb, one of the best we have seen. Easy to get to and combined makes a good half day excursion. A lot of thought and planning here"
,,Part of heaven,5.0,,"whether you love the flowers and natural or not, it is a place you must visit. No way to be in Singapore without visiting the Orchid Garden and the Botanic Gardens. I can not describe the beauty and the variety of flowers there. It is an experience to be lived"
,,Stunning displays,5.0,,"Brilliant place , well worth a visit with great displays of flowers and orchids. We only spent a short time here but could have stayed much much longer."
,,Tranquility,5.0,,"Beautiful and peaceful with well laid out borders which were well maintained. Go uphill until you see the VIP section, named fter famous people. There is a small shop where you can buy stuff and have snacks. A lovely place."
,,One of the prettiest places I have ever visited,5.0,,"After being somewhat underwhelmed by the Gardens by the Bay in Singapore, we somewhat reluctantly agreed to visit Singapore's Botanic Gardens. Wow, what a beautiful place and experience, so peaceful, fresh and well presented. The highlight without doubt was the Orchid Garden. This is one of the prettiest garden displays that I have ever seen. The colours are rich & varied and the garden beautifully layed out & presented. Your camera will not stop clicking. Make sure you have plenty of capacity on your smartphone.Taxi fare from Raffles is under $12.00 & admission to Botanic Gardens is free. Just $5.00 per person will get you into the Orchid Gardens.... Well worth if, even if you are not a flower person."
,,A must see,5.0,,I'm not a gardener but as a keen photographer the orchids were absolutely beautiful and well worth a visit.
,,Orchid garden,5.0,,A symphony of colour and an interesting variety of different types of orchid. Celebrity orchid garden also very interesting
,,Fantastic,4.0,,"If you like orchids this is the place to head for, amazing, the colours and shapes of the different types of orchids wonderful"
,,Love Orchid,5.0,,"Like this place, you can see the origin orchid from singapore, and other orchid varieties .......good spot for photo also, please come and visit this amazing place"
,,Worth a visit!,3.0,,"This is definitely not at the top of the list of things to do in Singapore but if you are there for a week or so, you wouldn't mind spending a lazy evening there."
,,A great many varieties of stunningly beuatiful orchids.,4.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is located on a hill within the Singapore Botanic Garden. It has a separate entrance and you pay a modest fee to visit.
It starts with a very educational exhibition explaining about orchids - how you cultivate them and how you create interesting hybrids.
The orchid garden is really beautiful with impressive landscaping and divided into four colour zones. The walk ramp meanders all through the garden and even wheel-chair bound visitors have full access.
There is close to a 1000 different orchids or hybrids on display with varying shape, colour and so forth. Some stunningly beautiful."
,,Worth the Trip,5.0,,"Don't miss this. It costs $5.00 but you will get your money's worth. Beautiful, just beautiful. Be sure to take the map so you can be sure you don't miss anything."
,,Superb,5.0,,This is one of the loveliest gardens I've visited anywhere in the world. Amazing collection of orchids - really a world class garden.
,,Paradise on earth,5.0,,Our visit to the Orchid Garden was absolutely mesmerizing. It houses a huge variety of orchids and is landscaped beautifully. Thoroughly enjoyed!
,,A Lovely Place To Visit,4.0,,We visited the Orchard Gardens during our trip to the Botanical Gardens. Worth seeing if you love plants or not. Very beautiful gardens to walk through. I also enoyed reading about the famous people that some of the orchards were named after.
,,Orchids everywhere !!,4.0,,"Wow.. loved the collection of orchids.. Take your camera, and you can get some wonderful snaps. Carry lot of drinks as it usually gets hot, and you need to walk a lot to reach here within the gardens. Nearest MRT is botanoc Gardens."
,,A dreamy day,5.0,,"National Orchid garden is on one side of the Botanic Garden and a part of the Botanic Garden , but it has an identity of its own which is brighter than the Botanic Garden's identity. As you approach the garden from Cluny Road side , some semi-deserted roads leading to the garden may create the impression that you are perhaps not going to a very popular destination. But once you buy the entrance ticket and enter into orchid Garden , it is a different world there. Words fail to express the varieties of orchids available there. Landscaping is excellent. Arrangements are visitor friendly and there is a ramp snaking its way all through the place making it possible for a wheel-chair bound tourist also full access. The myriad shapes which the colourful orchids adopt is mind-boggling."
,,Very Nice,5.0,,"The garden was wonderful. We can go in the morning around 6 AM is better, the fresh air is comming and the green environment will appear, especially can enjoy with Orchid."
,,"BEAUTY OF RARE EXCEPTION, ORCHIDS, WOW",5.0,,This was an extra but well worth it. A well designed and well structured walk through many different types of beautiful orchids. Definitely worth the visit. Make sure you have a camera that can take superb photos of delicate flowers. You will remember the place forever.
,,A great way to a couple of hours away from the bustle of Orchard Road,4.0,,"Getting to the Botanic Gardens is very easy as it has its own MRT stop on the Circle Line (Yellow). Planning your visit the gardens is essential, especially because there is not much shelter within the grounds. Visiting on a particularly hot (42degree) and humid (94%) day meant using an umbrella for shelter and carrying a big bottle of water was helpful. There is alot of uphill walking which was not a problem for us, but it is worth noting."
,,I am not into gardens but this is beautiful,5.0,,"I am not into gardens at all, I don't like visiting them, but I have been to this attraction twice now and it is beautiful. There is something about the tranquility of the orchid garden that I enjoy. I have to say the first occasion was in August 2014 and the second March 2015, there were far more orchids in August than in March, so maybe if you want to see this attraction at its best somehow check before you arrive whether the orchids are in ""bloom"" (don't know if that is the correct term for orchids). But in any case it is a lovely stroll through the garden."
,,Beautiful but underwhelmed,4.0,,Beautiful garden but was not impressed with the orchids inside the garden did not see a wide enough variety and honestly I've seen much more beautiful orchids in Taiwan Taoyuan Airport.
,,Amazing Unexpected Garden,4.0,,"Though I had no interest (in orchids) or plans to make a stop here, I am glad I did. Knew nothing about orchids.. but was amazed the variety ad display in this park.. was awestruck"
,,Great garden,4.0,,"amazing place we ever had, i and my wife visiting this garden last week. I will recommend with my friends and family who come to Singapore."
,,Beautiful place!,5.0,,It's a beautiful and peaceful place to relax and enjoy thousands of orchids and landscapes. Worth the 5 singapore dollars per person.
,,"STUNNING, if you love flowers, this is the place to visit",5.0,,"Truly stunning displays of so many varieties of orchard, As OAP we were charged £1 admission ~ amazing value."
,,An amazing vista of lovely flowers,5.0,,"We thoroughly loved Singapore National Orchid Gardens. It is a complete treat to the eyes with an amazing vista of lovely flowers in all possible colours...truly a riot of colours. As you enter the garden, don't forget to collect the garden map and follow the route direction. We were super excited to see the Pitcher Plant - the carnivorous plant lethal to insects. The bloom of the variety of the orchids will simply amaze you. Also, once you have covered the park, you may take a peek inside the adjacent shop where you will get wonderful collection of hats, accessories and souvenirs."
,,"Brilliant, not to be missed",5.0,,This was the highlight of our visit to the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The range of orchids on display is amazing. Beautifully maintained. Plenty of photo-opportunities!
,,Range of Orchids will simply amaze you,5.0,,The variety of orchids are so many. They have a VIP Orchard Garden too wherein they have grafted and crossed to create new orchid variety for each celebrity that visited them. Its a must see not to be missed.
,,Amazing collection,5.0,,"Truly stunning collection of orchids. If you love colour and variety this is well worth an hour of your time. I would suggest visiting in the morning if you can as it will be slightly cooler, or a little later in the afternoon."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,What a beautiful place. Every type of orchid you could wish to see in a beautiful garden setting. Make sure you visit all the different parts of the garden and take time to just sit and take in everything.
,,Beautiful orchids,5.0,,"The garden is big. There are orchids named after Princess Diana, Margaret Tetcher. There are also plumerias in the garden. But it is hot there"
,,A beautiful place,5.0,,Visited the Orchid garden a spart of our visit to the Botanical Gardens. If you like orchids this is a beautiful place with a wide variety on show. The gardens are so beautifully cared for.
,,Underwhelming - Gardens by the Bay are better,3.0,,"The visit was pleasant enough but the displays were not as enticing and attractive as I had expected. The area seems a little bit overgrown and not as well maintained as I thought they would be.

I am very surprised that this is a No1 attraction in Singapore. Maybe I just don't get orchids?"
,,Pleasant Greenary Garden,4.0,,Located to Botanic Garden SIngapore. Can spend you evening time there. Very green eneivronment with lots of trees and flowers. Throuroughly enjoyed the experience.
,,Lovely Display,4.0,,Great that we got free entry for a family during a school holiday promotion! The Orchid Garden is well worth a visit for the beautiful display. Love the building and the cool house too. Gem of the gardens!
,,beautiful,5.0,,this cost to get into but well worth it. it has the most amazing amount of orchids that i have ever seen well tended
,,Flowers Enthusiast,5.0,,"Brilliant, show of all types of orchids, nothing to dislike amazed at all different types of flowers."
,,"Beautiful, Tranquil Place",5.0,,Definitely a must see place. It is absolutely stunning! Its a bit away from the main centre however we got there on the hop-on-hop-off tourist bus which made it easier. You have to pay to get into the Orchid Garden itself - S$5 approx. but its such a beautiful place and a nice contrast from the city life.
,,Great garden,5.0,,It was a wonderful garden that can makes us feel fresh. The beautiful and charming garden in the hub of Singapore.
,,Credit to Singapore,5.0,,"Firstly I should say I am biased, I'm a Singapore resident having moved from Ireland. The Singapore Botanic Gardens generally and the Orchid gardens within, really are a credit to Singapore. Immaculately clean and well groomed, meticulously maintained and just a wonderful public space for all to enjoy. A great natural retreat in the middle of a busy city. You will need to pay a small fee to visit the Orchid garden but it's well worth it. If you don't want to spend the money you can enjoy the rest of this wonderful public space for free. Several cafes also."
,,Wow,5.0,,This was a great experience. Really a must see in Singapore. The Garden has a few different areas and are well maintained. The Gardens are in the furthest corner of the Botanical Gardens but the walk to there makes it even better.
,,"A very lovely place to walk around, well set up displays",4.0,,Included on our half day city tour and we enjoyed the change of pace this brought to the tour. It was well maintained and there were plenty of walkways to see the features of the gardens.
,,Such a Massive Variety of Orchids,5.0,,"We loved the layout of the Orchid Garden and the Multitude of orchid varieties that are there! A beautiful, beautiful 'garden'. Plus..it was nice that a couple of non-Singaporean 'Seniors' qualified for the cut price Seniors Rate...smile..."
,,Wonderful garden set in the Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"I'm not a lover of orchids, somehow they look a little plastic to me, but we had friends staying who wanted to go so I tagged along. I was seriously impressed, the gardens are beautiful, with lovely walkways, calm sitting areas, and yes huge numbers of exotic looking orchids.

The gardens cost $5 but are worth every penny, do go and have a look. Combine it with a trip to the Ginger garden and the rainforest walk and then head for tea somewhere on Orhcard road which is relatively close by."
,,"Colours, sizes & shapes",5.0,,"What a variety of plant all called ""orchid"". It is a great display and quite a pleasant surprise (during the hot weather) to come across a separate feature called the Cool House that displays orchids, bromeliads and carnivorous plants from highland habitats. Wonderful to spend some refreshing time in the ""clouds"" before returning to the usual tropical weather of Singapore."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"It is hard to describe the beauty of this garden, with an exceptional selection of orchids. A must visit."
,,Love the flowers,4.0,,"First of all, this place require an entrance fee. The place was filled with orchid of many kinds. Although I am not a flower person, I still enjoy the vibrant colours of all the orchids there.

I have friends who are flower lover, and they love this place so much. They recommended this place as one of the must go place if you love flowers"
,,Really Beautiful! Never knew so many different species of orchids existing.,4.0,,"Finally went to the National Orchid Garden when they were offering free entry for Singaporeans earlier this month. So glad I went. Now that I have been inside, I think it is worth the $5 per adult they charge because there are so many species of orchid that I have never seen before and the garden is quite big and there's quite a lot to see.

The Mist House within the National Orchid Garden is a must visit as it contains the rarer species of orchid.

I also visiting the Burkill hill and VIP garden are nice too. The Cool House was quite sad without much orchids to see."
,,Just Beautiful!,5.0,,"The Orchidarium / national orchid garden is not to be missed. I'm more than a little bit of a plant nerd, and this place does not disappoint. The fragrant garden and the foliage garden were also special. It is HOT out there, so take care to pace yourself and drink water. I spent the morning here and then took the MRT (subway) to Harbourfront ($2.60 fare - worth it for the air conditioning alone) which is the total opposite of the botanic garden - a giant crazy mall. The combo of these two thing makes for a full day that will delight all of your senses...."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Visited as part of a half day city tour. Would have liked longer here. You could easily spend a day here if you like gardens. Facilities are good and the gardens very well maintained. Lots of lovely photo oprtunities here.
,,Great for a Solo Day of Relaxation,5.0,,"Spent a few hours at The Botanical Gardens as part of a get-away day while visiting Singapore on a family trip. There was a minimal fee to explore the Orchid gardens. Well worth it! So relaxing and inspiring to be surrounded by such natural beauty. The orchids here are beautiful and well tended. When I went mid-week there were no crowds to fight through, but I have a hunch that even at peak times you wouldn't encounter that issue as the garden was much larger than I had anticipated and spread out over a large area. No Smoking in the Entire gardens was such a welcome feature!"
,,"Stunning, so glad I visited",5.0,,"Orchids galore, but is so artistically and thoughtfully presented.

I do like orchids, but honestly you do not have to be an orchid lover to enjoy this place. At $5 it is a bargain and you can combine it with a larger trip to the Botanical Gardens which are free.

Peaceful surrounds, varied displays and even 'photo spots' which have little perches for you to sit on to get that ultimate photo with the orchids. Very clever to provide this so people don't clamour on the garden beds trying to get their ideal photo.

The gift shop has lovely quality items and I found the staff extremely friendly and helpful"
,,Absolutely breathtaking,5.0,,"The entire Botanic Gardens are very impressive, but the National Orchid Garden is particularly incredible. I went in the middle of the day when it's hot, humid and generally a bit miserable for someone coming from winter weather. But the garden took my mind off of all of that - plus, the old black and whites (the old colonial buildings) that are part of the offices, guest services and exhibit areas in the garden really give you a great feel for older times. I took the MRT to the Bukhit Timah gate and you'll have to walk most of the Botanic Garden to get to the National Orchid Garden from there. It's a pretty easy tour to start at the Bukhit Timah gate, visit the National Orchid Garden and then head on to Holland Village in a straight(ish) line."
,,unbelievably well maintained and structured garden,4.0,,"A minimal $5 fee to enter the Orchid garden portion of the botanical gardens is well worth it. Very well maintained with beautiful Asian art pieces intermingled throughout the garden. Extensive variety of foliage, orchids of course, and also gazebos and seating areas to relax and take it all in."
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden is a must for any who visits Singapore. The Orchid is the national flower of Singapore and the Singaporean genius scientists have developed the hybrid orchid of its own to show in the garden.
The most inspiring, tranquil and beautiful place.
Enjoy Orchid Garden."
,,Beaurtiful!,5.0,,"The Orchard garden sits in the botanical gardens. Closest gate is Burkill Gate. I walked from Nassim Visitor Centre and it took 10 minutes. There is a S$5 charge for adults, free for children under 12 and S$1 for senor citizens and students. This is a bargain! There are over 1,000 species and 2,000 hybrids. The smell on entry is outstanding and the colours are out of this world. There are some steep slopes and steps but a trail is marked out for those with mobility problems. All the signs are in English. The Cool House on the far side is a must visit especially if the heat is getting to you. The shop is well worth a visit too. I spent an hour wandering around and would not recommend spending less time there but you could easily spend longer! Enjoy!"
,,Lots of flowers,4.0,,Bring your camera as you won't be able to remember the varieties. Adequate for weelchairs. Very relaxing and comfortable even if it is a warm day.
,,Excellent addition to a trip around the Botanic Gardens,5.0,,It was an excellent addition to our trip around the Botanic Gardens and at only $5SD per person it is well worth it. The Orchid gardens are right next to the Botanic gardens so I would recommend doing both in the same day.
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,The gardens were well presented and worth every dollar. The orchids were beautiful. This is definitely not one to miss.
,,Breathtakingly stunning,5.0,,We visited these gardens this morning (£2.50 each - a bargain). Accessible via the botanical gardens (free and well worth a stroll!) we were delighted at what we saw. So worth a visit - paradise in the City.
,,"beautiful garden, you can take so awsome pic any corner with the view.",5.0,,"This is nice garden, you can spend your time with the camera, and after you watch again the pics you see it is realy beautiful."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"The orchid garden within the botanic gardens is beautiful. There is such an array of colour you could not fault it. There is a small fee to get in but it's well worth it, it has the wow factor"
,,Relax,5.0,,Just came here for relax after a full day trip to other tourism's sites. Very nice view and fresh air.
,,A must see. Beautiful,4.0,,"Very special and very beautiful place. Go there, even if you´re not into gardening. A lot of different Orchids."
,,Singapore fantastic live city,5.0,,Day in the sun nothing to dislike the people are amazing Clarks quay the zoo the shopping in orchard road. But remember SIngapore is very expensive 5 star all the way
,,A must if you are into flowers,4.0,,"This is part of the Botanical Gadens in Singapore. It is somewhat contrived but well done and a joy to any Orchid grower. They have done a great job and it is well worth a visit even if you are not a flower nut.
From what I can remember there was a small fee to this attraction but not to the Botanical Garden itself."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Great place to walk through. Enjoyed the various flowers, but I think one of my favorite places was near the top of the park where they have newly discovered varieties named after famous dignitaries. Fun to read the names."
,,"Overwhelming. Spectacular. Worth every minute, every penny",5.0,,"So beautiful. I have been to Singapore twice now, and this was my very first place I wanted to re-visit on the 2nd trip. Just amazing, so beautiful, tranquil, well planned, well maintained."
,,a must visit,5.0,,"the gardens were so well laid out and very pretty,could not believe how many orchids there are.We spent a morning wandering around the gardens very well laid out and beautifully kept."
,,Beautiful - Especially the Shop!,4.0,,"The orchids were wonderful - I especially like the section of orchids named after famous people.
But, I loved the orchid shop - if you want to get lost in the beauty of flowers, you can buy jewellery, paper weights, and all kinds of other things with orchids inside. I had an absolute ball buying orchid necklaces for all the ladies at home!"
,,Glorious,5.0,,"Lovely flowers in a lovely setting, within the botanical gardens, which are themselves very attractive. The fact that there are drinking fountains throughout the gardens is very wecome."
,,Chinese Lunar New Year at National Orchid Garden Simgapore,5.0,,"During the Chinese lunar new year 2015 the National Orchid Garden was beautifully decorated with traditional Chinese motif such as red lanterns, fire crackers, and the new year zodiac animal goat. The Tan Hoon Siang Misthouse is the most spectacle part of the garden where a wide range of exotic hybrid species of orchid plants are displayed nestled in tropical habitat."
,,almost too many to appreciate,5.0,,"Part of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the Orchid Garden has so many varieties of orchids that it is almost overwhelming. Some are exquisitely beautiful. Quite interesting are the large group of orchids that have been named for visiting dignitaries. One has to wonder how the designers chose what names to give to the different orchids."
,,Amazing value to see beautiful unique orchid displays!,5.0,,"Entry into Singapore Botanic gardens is free and still lovely, but the real gem of the area is the Natinal Orchid Garden. Entry is $5 and gets you entry into a beautiful walk around different kinds of orchids. So many beautiful displays! Spent around 1 hour walking around. Highly recommended as part of you Botanic Garden visit."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,this was the third time I have visited the Orchid garden and each time it appears more stunning than ever. The colours are incredible and this time I visited it was Chinese New Year with wonderful displays. I have mobility issues and this is one of the few places in Singapore where it is easy to get around. It was also nice to visit the cool houses on a very hot day. Not to be missed when in Singapore (and very cheap to get in!)
,,Different beautiful flowers,4.0,,"Interesting and lovely orchids with various colors and shapes ,several flower arches ,memorable flowers"
,,Peaceful and beautiful,4.0,,i am not a lover of Orchids but if anything will turn my thoughts around it is this place. So many wonderful colours and shapes. The gardens were a peaceful haven
,,The most beautiful flowers I have ever seen...,5.0,,"We visited the orchid garden on a Sunday morning, and even though it was busy, and pretty hot, it was well worth it. Particularly interesting is the VIP garden of hybrids creating for visiting dignitaries. Also the smell of the flowers was lovely! Definitely worth the small admission fee."
,,Great orchid collections!,4.0,,"National Orchid Garden is within the SG Botanical Garden. I highly suggest to visit this place in the morning, coz it's too hot..lol..The collection of orchids are really great..it's a heaven for people who love orchids/flower!! There is an admission fee which is very affordable, $5..:)"
,,Wonderful !,5.0,,The garden is quite stunning. At $1 for over 60s it is a bargain! Don't miss this from your Singapore visit.
,,I'm glad my Wife dragged me along,5.0,,"Not being a great lover of Gardens or Flowers, I was not really keen on visiting the Orchid Gardens, But I'm glad I did. It was fantastic I can see why this is rated a Singapores number 1 attraction."
,,Stunning Exotic beauty,5.0,,"I am not a ""garden person"" and went to the Botanic Gardens just as one item on Singapore's tourist activities but was blown away by the spectacle of masses of pastel and vivid colours of well-known or rare species in the orchid garden. Grown along pathways, grafted onto or nestled under trees, in hothouses, the garden is a must-see. The small entry fee of $5 is well worth it - the rest of the Botanic Gardens are free to enter."
,,Amazing orchids,4.0,,"This is the most spectacular display of orchids, a must see. There are more varieties than you can imagine, and like the rest of Singapore, the gardens are incredibly clean."
,,Great Botanical Garden,5.0,,Wonderful spot for a relaxing few hours. The walk through the park is enjoyable. Bring your camera.The variety is unique and well presented.
,,Photographers Dream!,5.0,,"I am a photographer. Visiting the the National Orchid Graden was a pleasure. If you like well manicured grounds, bueatiful and (extremely colorful) flowers the Garden is a place for you. I am not a flower and plant expert so I can't write the names of each that I have encountered. I do know that a large portion the plants and flowers are indigenous to the area which makes them very speical. As for making breathe taking photos, the Orchid Graden is a must!!!"
,,Wow!,4.0,,"Located in the centre of the Botanical Gardens. Gorgeous, tranquil garden. I had no idea there were so many orchid varieties. :-)"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Spend an hour or two and walk round it twice to enjoy the beautiful orchids and setting they are in. It's not expensive and easy to get to.
,,So beautiful,4.0,,"We went here for my mum as she absolutely loves orchids, but we all found something that was interesting to see here. Such a variety of orchids and if you are into photography, this is the place for you.
Does cost to enter, but on a hot day in Singapore, it was a lovely cool place to visit."
,,Nice,4.0,,Nice to walk around leisurely and see so many varieties of orchards. I wouldn't go again but enjoyed seeing it once. At their shop I bought some amazing herbal teas to take home.
,,You thought there were this many varieties?,5.0,,Cost a small amount to enter from the free botanic gardens but mind blowing variety of wonderful orchards
,,lovely,4.0,,go see it if you have the time in singapore - beautiful peaceful place! they even had several school parties but you wouldnt really notice very well behaved and kept away from main areas!! VERY GOOD!
,,A Must See,5.0,,Breathtaking! Just beautiful! Couldn't take enough photos! We know we saw colors we had never seen before.
,,Orchid garden,4.0,,"Beautiful gardens, it covers a very large area sadly we only saw a fraction of it. We visited the Orchid section, although sign posted we fonund it confusing to fine our way back to were we stared"
,,NIce calm experience,4.0,,Was there with family and it was really good. Not a must visit but liked it for the calm out there. although given the size of singapore most places are crowded.
,,Both cultivated and 'natural' orchids to view,5.0,,"Quite extensive but easily walkable, wide range of orchids in woodland setting within the Botanic garden. Small admission charge."
,,Beautiful and stunning,5.0,,A must see for all in Singapore. So pretty and such an array of specimens and colour. Very pretty and set up is amazing. You also get to see the Botanic Gardens.
,,Most beautiful Orchids,5.0,,A large area where some of the most beautiful Orchids can be seen. A lot time and wear good shoes as the Botanical Garden and the Orchid Garden is large in area. If you are a student show your ID and you get free entrance and parents you get free entrance with them. Have your camera ready to take pictures of some beautiful orchids.
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,Mind-blowing array of color and variety. Well-done Singapore! I couldn't stop taking pictures and wandering to be sure I missed nothing.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,So lovely garden in the modern city in Asia. We love orchid. It looks like the green paradise for us.
,,Worth visiting...a heaven on earth,5.0,,On 5th March I Have the oppertunity to visit this beutiful place..a real heaven on earth..Orchids were blooming every where.All photo spots are real spots for photography.If you come to Botanical gardens dont miss this fantastic orchid garden
,,Fabulous,5.0,,This was our second visit to the garden and this time it was even better thanks to Chinese New Years. The displays were absolutely breath taking. It would be nice if tourists could put down their selfie sticks and admire the garden rather than themselves. It was difficult to get a picture of the orchids...which was why we were there!!
,,Orchid Heaven,4.0,,"The garden is an absolute must for anyone with a love of Orchids. so many varieties, the half hour allotted time to view was not long enough"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"In a city with limited attractions (except excessive shopping), these gardens, and the botanical gardens that surround them, are not to be missed. There are restaurants and bathroom facilities in the gardens and you can spend a couple of hours wandering around the lush vegetation."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,The Orchid Garden is within the Botanic Gardens. Fantastic display of various orchid types. Also the cool house is a welcome relief from the heat and humidity. The café at the near the Orchard Road end of the Botanic Gardens is worth a visit. There seems to be a menu for garden staff and one for visitors.

,,The best attraction of Singapore,5.0,,"In a country so small, its quite amazing to find such a paradise. And in a country with mostly man-made attractions, this is a welcome break.
The garden has numerous exotic and rare species with superb landscaping. One really can't describe how enchanting it is to see so many exquisite flowers in full bloom. Photo opportunities are everywhere, but the best way is to stand among the fully bloomed flowers and imagine yourself in a tropical garden - some of the birds there (don't know whether they are pets) will add to that effect.
A must visit."

,,actually March 2013,3.0,,"I went there two years ago so didn't return on this trip. It is worth seeing once but not worth going back again. If you have limited time in Singapore, this is one attractions I would skip. Gardens by the Bay are 10 times better."

The pathways are laid out beautifully, and there are so many photo opportunities. I'm so glad we went to see this. There are orchids named after famous personalities too. Don't miss those! Take plenty of water with you as it takes a couple of hours to see just this section. There are shops and washroom facilities there as well.

This Orchid Garden kept me fascinated for over an hour and I could have easily spent more time here if I had the opportunity. The variety of orchids is impressive, and there is a true beauty to these different flowers when you look at them closely.

When I came upon it in the botanical garden--and they wanted a fee for it? I wondered if it was worth it.
I got WAY more than my money's worth out of this exquisite place!
The quality of the orchid exhibits was outstanding--and the maintenance of the whole place was perfect!
I've never seen so many groups of single orchids--groups after groups after groups--and when a flower or group began to fade, it was taken away and replaced with a whole group of 30 or more identical plants.
I was stunned with this whole place---and so much more to this garden
I recommend it without reservation"
,,Amazing - even in the rain and heat,5.0,,"I have never seen so many orchids in a ""natural"" setting. They have carefully planted a variety of orchids, with labels, to show off the features of each and there are many photo stops. The Orchid Garden, which has a nominal entry fee, is set within the Singapore Botanical Garden which is free and is easily reached by subway.

,,Second time in 20 years and still wonderful,5.0,,"In spite of Singapore being so much more now our highlight again was the Orchid Garden. No architectural feat (and there are many of them here) can compare with the variety and natural beauty of flowers. Of course it takes love, dedication and effort to maintain the grounds and it clearly shows.

The best time to visit is first thing in the morning - it's cooler and less crowded."

,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden is in the Botanic Gardens and the only place where you need to pay to get into, but well worth the money. It's beautiful and peaceful. There are literally hundreds of different orchids here, and a cool house with many more, that's a relief to visit during the hot weather. The fragrance here is gorgeous."

,,Botanical Gardens,5.0,,"Went about noon on a pleasant day, stayed about 3 hours. Got to see the Orchid House and Garden. For Orchid lovers, this is outstanding. More varieties than one can imagine; plus, dozens and dozens of most varieties. The VIP area was equally interesting.
Walked along the lake and the rainforest trails. Both are excellent places to stroll, stop and enjoy. Worth the fee."
,,Oasis in busy city,5.0,,Amazing display of orchids. Some good photo opportunities but just as good to watch others posing in front of the orchids - have they practised at home in front of the mirror?
,,"So many varieties of Orchids, all blooming happily",5.0,,Very beautiful - I didn't even know that there are so many varieties in Orchids! It is beautifully landscaped and the flowers are just so beautiful!

,,"Flowers, flowers, flowers",5.0,,"Walking through these gardens was a treat - the variety of orchids was unbelievable, especially in the VIP section"
,,As close to Edens orchid garden as possible,5.0,,"Fantastic!!! Do not miss it if you visit Singapore.
The National Orchid Garden opens at 8:30, Botanic garden at 07:00 in the morning. Start early and enjoy!
The garden is cooler in the morning, I would recommend you to take advantage of that, an early start and get max out of the day.
Brilliant for picnic with kids, a lot of families with kids wisited the Botanic Garden you have to walk through to get to the orchid garden, but the area (Botanic Garden) is so large, there is plenty room for everybody, also those who would like a quiet time for themselves accompanied by a book etc.
The orchid garden has an area with rear orchids, beautiful!!!! so as the rest of the garden.
Toilet facilities are acceptable and next to the orchid garden there is a place where you can get something to eat/drink. Souvenir shop by the entrance/exit.
The walkways are suited for wheelchaire, but there are some stairs in the orchid garden, but then you could choose another path to get to the different places.
Fee to enter is 5 dollars."
,,Must visit for nature and flower lovers,5.0,,"Excellent place where you get to see different varieties of Orchids. You can get to this place vIa MRT as they have a MRT Stn for Botanical gardens. The entire garden is very nice and huge. Once you enter the Botanical garden, it will take you around 15-20 mins walk inside the nature park before you reach the National Orchid Garden. You won't feel the heat while walking inside as it's lush green and also has a few lakes. National Orchid garden has a minimal entry fee of SGD5 pp which is worth the experience."
,,Really worth a visit :-),5.0,,It's definitely worth popping your head in here for the low $5 charge. There were many beautiful orchids to look at and the garden was really well kept. We weren't flower enthusiasts but spent one - two hours soaking up the smells and clicking away with our cameras at the pretty orchids.
,,Peaceful stroll,4.0,,"We spent a morning here strolling through the well kept plants and greenery. It was a nice break from the city. The area before the Orchard Garden is free and it's huge! The Orchard garden itself was really nice and well maintained (a bit artificial, but still beautiful). If you want to exit the garden after the Orchard section to get to the subway, you have to walk all the way back from the beginning. A helpful tip when walking back is to exit at one of the parking lots and walk back to the subway using the main road. It's a quiet street and a more direct route. It runs parallel to the garden path and its a lot faster!"
,,Worth the Walk,5.0,,"My family & I had a great time here. We went here during the Lunar New Year season and the theme flower decor was awesome!! Although it is quite a walk from the MRT station, but its worth it! Those visiting Singapore should come here!"
,,"If you’re going to Botanical Garden’s, this is a must see",4.0,,"There is a lot to do and see at the Botanical Gardens. If you’re only visiting Singapore and you want to check out the Botanical Garden’s, this is a must see."
,,Really beautiful,4.0,,"We had a lovely time, the flowers are beautiful and the gardens are really nice. The only issue we had was that some of the staff felt it necessary to cat call my sister and I, and we didn't really feel like that was appropriate."
,,Worth the trip.,5.0,,"Paid the additional price to visit this area within the Botanical Gardens, we went early and it was very peaceful, immaculate and fantastic displays. They have an area for colder climate plants, a great place to cool down on a hot day. As we were leaving, loads of coach parties and school groups turned up so it was getting busy about 11am."
,,World of Orchids,4.0,,"The National Orchid Gardens are in the Singapore Botanics. There is a small admission charge, which is well worth it. There are several paths around the garden, which covers a reasonable area, and a huge variety of orchids are on display. We spent almost an...More"

,,Vast amount of species,5.0,,Nice and varied setting for a huge amout of different types of orchids. Well maintained and planned.
,,Bring your camera,4.0,,It is always hot viewing this garden but so worth it. There are a couple of spots that showcase more orchids and those are where people congregate . Plan out the walk so you don't have to double back. Bring water and a hat. Found some lovely per akin earrings in the gift shop amongst the other not so great souvenirs.
,,Beutifully presented orchids in compact site,4.0,,"Within the botanic gardens, and well worth paying the small entrance fee. Very tranquil and peaceful, and excellently maintained"
,,Best $5 in Singapore,5.0,,Glorious colour shape and diversity. Even some have scents. Not many phalenopsis but dendrobium and cattelya galore. Cold room is a welcome relief from the heat.

,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,A beautiful array of all types of orchids and very natural settings and easy to get around although smaller in area than thought it would be and possibly more exhibits.
,,Gorgeous View,5.0,,"This national gem is literally blooming with beautiful flowers. Set up as a huge park split into several different sub-sections, the landmark has to be the National Orchid Garden. It will cost about 5USD per person, but the grounds take quite a while to walk through. Within that sub-section, you will find even more to look at, including a beautiful miniature cooling house full of colorful finds. The landscaping throughout the park is so diverse and intricate. It also helps that the staff labels every ""photo moment"" imaginable with brightly colored signs. (A downside to this decision are the hoards of other tourists waiting to take their glorified selfies during holiday season).

We went on a cloudy day and still had a fabulous time, so don't let the rain scare you away from the expansive grounds. During our visit, we even ducked into two free museums in the garden. Our trip their was absolutely perfect."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is found within the grounds of the botanical gardens. Cost is only $5 SGD, and it 100% worth it.

,,"Detailed review under heading ""Singapore Botanic Gardens""",4.0,,"A highlight of any visit to Singapore, and the ultimate feature of the Botanic Gardens. An oasis of calm - look out for the pure white Diana orchid."
,,Very Special,5.0,,There are not many places where you can see this many orchids in one place. Most gardens have one small hot house while there are so many more here at the Botanical Gardens. Certainly worth the extra fee. Truly the very special gem of the gardens.
,,You might burn up your camera card!,5.0,,"Beautiful variety. Nowhere else will you find this kind of garden for next to nothing. The walk takes you through different kinds of environments, from a cool room to a misty enclosure. The VIP area, where flowers are named after famous visitors, is historically fascinating."
,,Post cruise airport transfer tour,5.0,,As part of an airport transfer we visited the gardens. We only spent 45 minutes there but you could have spent hours. The orchids are spectacular and the garden beautifully maintained. Well worth the visit..
,,"Probably the best in the world, but see the Botanical Gardens too.",5.0,,"No question, this is definitely world class. My wife raises orchids and she was still amazed and both the quantity and quality. The Botanical Gardens are right next door and they are very nice also so you should enjoy them also. Besides, if you take the metro your going to have to walk through part of the Botanical Gardens anyway. Be sure not to miss the Mist House and the Cool House. It's well worth the five Singapore dollars admission fee."
,,A place to be for nature lovers,5.0,,Visit this place for nice pics. I loved the pics i have taken here. Probably go for a city tour they will include this place for sure
,,Beautiful Place To Visit..,4.0,,"This is a well ventilated beautiful, place.

,,Beautiful oasis in the heart of Singapore,5.0,,"Well worth a visit to see this huge garden and the orchid greenhouse. If you have time, have lunch in the park's restaurant. Although the prices were quite steep, the portions were HUGE - too big for one person, in fact, so I recommend splitting your entree. Delicious food."
,,Worth the stroll from the station,4.0,,"Although it's about 1.5km walk from the botanic garden station it's well worth the walk. Both the stroll through the botanic gardens & the orchid garden are beautiful. Skip any of the expensive cafes & just buy some drinks/snacks then sit under a tree overlooking the music stage, it's much nicer & the views beautiful"
,,Glorious gardens,5.0,,It was very hot so walking through the Botanical gardens to get to the orchid garden was tiring but worth the experience.

,,A wonderful world of orchids,4.0,,"The National Orchid Garden was one of my chosen destinations during my 3 day trip to Singapore. I adore orchids, and I was spoilt for choice at this garden. All the orchids were well labelled and there were some amazing specimens. A few orchids weren't at their best but there was still plenty to see. There are several paths you can follow to see the various orchids so some walking is involved. I seem to remember it being wheelchair friendly but check that online. There is a good gift shop there also. Allow a good couple of hours to see the orchids. There is a cafe nearby, and also the Ginger Garden."
,,Simply breathtaking,5.0,,"Unleash your inner flora photographer. (I did!) Everywhere you turn and pause, there's another gorgeous specimen of orchid. The grounds are laid out perfectly for a casual stroll, and the scenery is beautiful. Plenty of shady nooks to escape the opressive heat and humidity.

,,Great for orchid lovers,5.0,,"The gardens are part of the Botanical gardens with a large collection of orchids hence if you are into flowers, it is worth seeing. There is a section with orchids named after various celebrities (mainly politicians or their wives) who visited the garden.

The only thing that makes this visit more challenging is the access if you wish to take MRT to reach it."

,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,There is nothing to dislike about a visit to the National Orchid Garden unless it is Singapore's heat and humidity which is quite energy sapping. The gardens are outstanding with hundreds of specimens to see all beautifully laid out in what appears to be a natural habitat. I did not realise just how many different species there are.

The walk in the Botanic Gardens to get to the orchid garden is very pleasant too.
,,Symphony of Colour... and Quiet!,5.0,,"If your not an orchid fan (and I've never been excited by them before!), it's still worth going. The surroundings, fountains, waterfalls, colours and easy access make it very accessible, even on a hot day. So many different colours, sizes and shapes of orchids... and oooohed and aaaahed with my family. It's a compact area, packed with floral delights.
If you're at the Botanical Gardens, then the nominal charge for the Orchid Garden is worth it."

Well worth a visit."
,,Worthwhile visit,4.0,,"I can recommend the orchid garden to all those who like nature and especially flowers. The surrounding Botanic Gardens offer sufficient space for everyone to relax from the noisy and busy city.

Getting to the orchid garden can be tricky, visitors may naturally end up at the Botanic Garden MRT which is more than 1.4km walk away from the orchid garden entrance.

,,orchid lover,5.0,,"If you love orchids you must visit... go early before it gets too hot.... so so so many beautiful orchids.We came to Singapore mainly to visit these gardens and weren't dissappointed. We caught a taxi and asked to be dropped of at the point closest to the orchid gardens (have a look on a map for the name of the road) then once we left we strolled thru the botanic gardens to the main entrance of the botanic gardens. Just be aware if you want a taxi to return to your hotel it can be a long wait. You are better of seeing the service desk, just inside, before exiting and asking them to book a taxi for you... the young man there was such a great help...you will be given a number and the taxi picked us up within 5 minutes."
,,Must do for orchid lovers,5.0,,Loved this beautiful garden with many gorgeous varieties displayed Several different climate types grown Hubby enjoyed the many photographic opportunities too

,,Singapore Botanical garden,5.0,,Revisiting after many many years this garden has been developed into a stunning display of Trees and plants. The orchid garden inside this for which there is an entrance fee of $5 is definitely worth paying as the Orchids in bloom are beautiful and i can't even remember the names of them all. But yes a must visit place.
,,So many varieties,5.0,,"We paid the extra money to go into the national orchid garden and so glad we did. It was so vast and so many varieties.

The way they have set this place out is lovely too, different layouts and settings.

There is also an area where you walk through and its like a refrigerator, it was so interesting to see the different types of plants growing, and to be honest to have some nice cool weather!

I look at my photos from my holiday 3 months later, and cant believe how beautiful some of them were."

Easily accessible by MRT, there is a Botanic gardens stop.Be prepared to walk though, you have to walk nearly 1.5 kms inside the botanic gardens from the MRT stop to reach the Orchid garden. But once you reach there, you will fell the walk was worth it. You have to pay a fee to get inside, but it is much much cheaper compared to what you have to pay at the Gardens by the bay. Once you get inside, you are greeted with the sight of orchid flowers everywhere !! It is absolutely amazing. So many varieties, colors. And all set out in a very attractive manner. You won't get enough of this place. And you will be able to take so many beautiful photographs"

Even if you are not a fan of phytology it is absolutely great."

,,Fantastic display,5.0,,"We enjoyed visiting the Orchid Garden and some of the displays were magnificent . The area of the Botanical Gardens is very large and the Orchid Garden within the Botanical Gardens was probably more than a mile walk from the entrance we used, after getting off the underground.

Besides common species, lots of scare hybrids are displayed before your eyes in their natural environment. If you watch out carefully, you could also see tiny wonderful birds among the orchids."
,,Good indeed,5.0,,"A must visit, cheap. And don't take the entrance in botanic garden mrt unless you have time(orchid garden is inside botanic garden). Because it's a long way walking in the botanic garden. Take the other entrance in the botanic garden. which is closer."

Orchids are epiphytes and beef to grow on other hosts . You will be stunned by the effort it quirks take to build such a garden let alone maintain it . My favorite flower was golden shower . You have to visit this place as its part of the botanical gardens which is awesome and free to enter . Enjoy guys"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Beautiful orchids in a corner of the wonderful botanical gardens. Oldies like us only have to pay 1 Singapore dollar to get in instead of 5, which was also very pleasing!"
,,Magic!,5.0,,"Just a magical place. There are so many gorgeous and genuinely beautiful orchids here. There are massed displays and individual gems.

At $5 it is the best value day out!

My only tip is go early as it can get very hot. Maybe take a fan and umbrella to keep you cool."
,,Great day out,5.0,,Very much liked the National Orchid Garden during a visit to the Botanic Gardens. Very much worth the small entrance fee. Make sure you take cash as minimum Eftpost is $30.

,,Singapure Copy nature,5.0,,Incredible and very nice. I liked and recomended to visit the whole area. It is nice and interesting
,,Best 5 SGD ever spent,5.0,,"Comparing to other attractions in Singapore, this is the best for those who love to walk and enjoy the flowers, with a very good price. Although it's a bit far from the center of the city (took me 45 mins and 3 MRT switch), it's worth the money and the long trip. Btw, the other gardens are also very beautiful. I feel really jealous with Singaporeans as they have this great place for weekend picnic"

,,splendid orchids,5.0,,"Enjoy the shade and the beautiful setting of this enormous garden. Do not miss the orchids, they are worth the trip to Singapore.
However, its success makes this place a very busy one,any day of the week. Many tourists, local families, weddings to take their pictures. But even though, it's worth it."
,,Nice garden,3.0,,"Nice garden, and come on its jus a garden which u can find in ur own city.. When ur on tour u don expect a visit to garden which u can find back home.. It needs to be something special to visit which we don find bck home.."

,,Refreshing,4.0,,A beautiful and colorful way to begin my trip in Singapore. I went here on my first day in town. It is somewhat connected with the Botanical Garden so you can see both in the same trip. Very convenient.
,,worth it,4.0,,"was really worth visiting the orchid garden as well as the botanical garden inside which it is situated .
i have never before seen so many varieties of Orchid and was very much impressed with the way they have made the garden so many places where you can take photos was really good

,,Fantastic garden,5.0,,"It's an amazing arrangement of numerous flowers perfectly integrated into the natural surroundings
The maintenance is great as usual in Singapore
Even in twilight a good place due to the colorful orchids

... I could stay there for days...!"

,,Take a packed lunch to get from the station to the Orchid Garden.,4.0,,"It was a very long but well sign posted walk from the MRT to the Ordhid Gardens but well worth the effort. The flowers were spectacular and just beautiful.
The food at the eatery was reasonably priced and auite eatable. We were pleased with the location of the cafe.
Prices of souvenirs were ridiculous and were not purchased by us."
,,Lovely!,5.0,,"I'm not an orchid buff but I really enjoyed our visit. The garden is very well maintained and laid out, and the orchids are absolutely stunning."
,,Great quiet retreat in Singapore,5.0,,Im not a flower expert but this was a welcome retreat in the middle of Singapore Great for some greenery and time out.
,,So beautiful!,5.0,,"Absolutely stunningly beautiful comes to mind when I have to describe it, but it still does not describe the beauty. Entry is minimal so there is no excuse not to experience such an amazing place.There are plenty of photo opportunities when you wander in and around the gardens. There were flowers in every corner and in every colour imaginable. Make sure you have plenty of memory space on your camera because you will need it. The gardens have between 25,000 - 30,000 different varieties, I am a keen gardener but I didn't realise that there were so many varieties, some that stand metres tall and the fragrance in the gardens is amazing. Don't rush through, take a slow wander and make the most of the opportunities for a peaceful sit in the many shaded areas provided. Wear a hat and have water with you because it gets hot in the Singapore climate. It took us a full morning so be prepared but we didn't rush."
,,Great!,5.0,,Beautiful flowers. Well worth seeing. There is also a Cool House of orchids to give you a reprieve from the heat.
,,Beautiful landscaped garden,4.0,,"In the middle of the Botanical gardens, a lovely walk which is sign posted through the gardens. Lots of pretty photo opportunities. $5 entry fee. last entry is 6 pm and it closes at 7pm."

Tips - Make sure you have a good camera spare battery and Sd card. I would also recommend comfortable walking shoes ."
,,STUNNING,5.0,,"If you think you have seen orchids think again (I am saying this as a person who had several orchid plants in my UK home)
The specimens here are amazing, dozens of blooms on one plant, so many colours.
So nice to see these plants looking so healthy and happy."
,,Nice Morning Out,5.0,,"Well worth the time. Even if you don't like flowers. Can get hot so take some water, and good walking shoes."

,,"Great, if you like orchards!",4.0,,"Located within botanic gardens, main gardens are free to access add $5 to get in here.

Not an unpleasant experience but not very compelling either. It's hot and sticky to get around and call me cynical, but the only air conditioned area is the tourist retail shop at the end,"
,,Beautiful - wear comfy shoes!,5.0,,"We briefly explored the Orchid garden within the Botanical Gardens. We entered from the other end so it was over a 2km walk to get there. In the heat everything was becoming less exciting as you can imagine. There's a small fee to enter but worth it. It's very pretty with lots of photo opportunities and amazing species of orchids to look at. It is well maintained just like the rest of the gardens and Singapore in general. If your wanting to see some beautiful flowers and take your time, this is for you."
,,Loved the orchids.,5.0,,This place is a must visit in Singapore. I have never seen so many types and such lovely orchids anywhere. This place is just full of amazing orchids. Makes sense since a huge chunk of Singapore's national income comes from exporting orchids. One can get on the HOHO bus and spend 1-2 hours easily in this place.
,,Very impressive garden,5.0,,"For every friend of orchids a must, but also for other nature lovers it is a very interesting place to go."
,,Picturesque from every point of view,5.0,,"One of the things you should definitely see while in Singapore, confirming the hallmark name of The Garden City. The National Orchid Garden is a part of the large Botanic Gardens complex, with its own separate entrance inside, refreshment stall and gift shop. It may take some walk to find it in the middle of huge complex, but once you're there, you'll be amazed at the wonderful collection of many beautiful orchids and orchid hybrids. Loads of picturesque corners, nice cool climate and don't forget to look out for VIP and Celebrity orchids, crossed and named by famous persons who visited the garden."
,,Extraordinary Orchid Garden,5.0,,This would have to be one of the most extraordinary gardens I have ever been to in the world. Absolutely first rate condition and a wonderfully designed and artistic landscape. We also loved the beautifully restored black and white colonial house - Burkill Hall. One of the highlights of our visit to Singapore - truly sublime. Highly recommended
,,Beautiful place to wander through,5.0,,We visited the National Orchid Garden as part of a tour so unfortunately only had 40 minutes to view it. The orchids are quite spectacular and there were many more varieties that I had imagined. Beautiful smells and colours; delightful. Only wished we had longer to spend there.
,,Amazing place to spend the day,5.0,,The National Orchid Gardens is part of a larger garden and is a place to just wander and see the fantastic orchids that grow in this tropical paradise.
,,ORCHID-O-NATION,5.0,,"Whatever be the species & whatever be the color - It's here!!!NOG-SINGAPORE anyone who loves orchid- It's a must see,beautiflly maintained. Easily accessible by train & bus. Go there Now........"
,,Endless number of amazing orchids,4.0,,"This garden, advertised as the largest one in the world, is really amazing. There is a huge number of different orchid varieties and all the plants are continuously taken care of. Definitely worth the entry fee (5 SGD). I give 4 star rather than 5 only because there is a 30 SGD minimum amount to spend for paying with credit card so the entry has to be paid in cash. Aside from this, the garden is awesome."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,This offers orchid enthusiasts and photographers untold opportunities with superb specimens of almost every species imaginable in great settings
,,WORLD CLASS,5.0,,"We have never seen another open natural orchid garden anywhere else in the world of this high standard, it is simple amazing and you can spend several hours, or all day, just looking, smelling and photographing this amazing garden. The best, by far."
,,Take some time - well worth seeing,5.0,,Even if you don't have alot of time for sightseeing in Singapore it is well worth seeing. Located in the botanic gardens

,,Must see if you are going to Botanical Garden,4.0,,"If you love nature and flowers then please visit this.
Its not very large in size and within the premises of Botanical Gardens, the blooming orchids and the pleasant natural beauty is what we went for ......
What we found little awkward was that entry to Singapore Botanical Garden is free but to visit Orchid Garden one has to pay...only when we saw the orchid garden and compared it with the rest of Botanical Garden we realised the difference ( Orchid Garden is much better than the rest of the Garden)"
,,Amazing walk through orchid gardens,5.0,,I love the place ( middle of Botanical gardens) and enjoy walking through the beautiful Orchids outside.
,,Beautiful orchard garden,5.0,,"if you like orchids and greenery, this is the place to go. Over 10,000 species over a large park. This will take a few hours to walk all of the pathways. I did it in about two hours because it was raining. Entry is free and it is right outside the train station."
,,Definitly worth a Visit,4.0,,If you are a Gardner you could spend at least a day here and if you are not you must like to a stroll to enjoy the gardens. For a small fee you can admire the orchids closely in the Pay section. Well worth the small fee. Kids have to pay again for entering the children' s area. Well worth a visit.
,,Just many variations of the Orchid Order,3.0,,"Singapore is the World's Orchid Capital. You will see them everywhere. Unless you have a special interest in seeing every hybrid, this is not a worthy trip in the hot and humid weather. But if you enjoy parks, this one is part of the Botanical Garden Park."
,,Don't Miss this Place,5.0,,"An amazing, colorful garden full of Orchids in bloom. We went around the holidays and were blown away with the variety and colors.

,,Nature lovers paradise,4.0,,It was a worthwhile visit for a small entrance fee! I wasn't expecting the garden to be quite a big one. There's plenty to see and just take your time to take pictures and enjoy the flowers. We went a day after it rained so there were less crowds. We walked down the road to get to Orchard Road and it you could have dinner or a snack there after the garden visit. Only 15 minutes or less walking distance.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Loved every bit of it. absolutely beautiful. This is an attraction worth seeing. And bring money for the gift shop!

,,Just Lovely!,5.0,,"The entire botanical gardens is spectacular in Singapore. However, if you're limited on time, I suggest heading straight to the orchid garden.

,,A joyous garden,5.0,,"Look and wonder at this precious jewel in Singapore. It is unique in the world and a joy to visit. Do yourself a big favour, on Orchard Road, one mall is pretty much like the next. Next time you're in the ""Lion City' go visit the Orchid Garden."

,,An amazing piece of heaven.,5.0,,The Singapore Botanical Gardens are definitely a place not to miss when visiting this vibrant city.

,,Too perfect,3.0,,"My impression of the Orchid Garden and the Botanical Gardens in general is that they do not represent nature but man's dominance over nature. It was all too perfect, too tidy, too well managed, too ordered. But I suppose that is what Singapore is."
,,The orchid garden is excellent. The Botanic Gardens are must dos when in singapore,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens is one of the must dos in Singapore as reinforced by trip adviser albeit it features in several listings eg Botanic Gardens, Orchid Gardens.

The botanic gardens are well spaced out so decide in advance what you want to do and access the appropriate gate for the north, Central or South (Nr Orchard Rd). There is a good website on the gardens plus a free app you can download which are helpful.

We were keen to see the orchid garden so chose to enter at the Nessim gate via taxi (the central gate and closest to the orchid garden) and then exit at Tanglin / Orchard Road (very good public transport options).

The orchid gardens are spectacular and it is well worth spending time doing the circular walk (we took about an hour leisurely) enjoying the diplomats garden, cool house etc

On a nice day a general walk around the gardens would be hard to beat. There are plenty of rest and restaurant options to enjoy so don't feel rushed to leave. Entry to the gardens is free but individual attractions such as the orchid garden have their own fee ($5)."
,,The Most georgeos Orchids in the World,5.0,,Go early in the morning to miss the crowds and the heat and take water and an umbrella. Plan on staying for at least an hour and a half to enjoy a stroll.

,,Fully worth the 5 SGD,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore and have some time, there is only one reason not to go there: You do not like orchids at all.

If you do like them this is the place for you to go to. Hundreds of species in the most beautiful arrangements, and evevn if the area does not look too big it will easily take you two hours to explore it all. Watch out for birds and butterflies as an added plus."

,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Absolutely brilliant with so many orchids, most of them I really did not know. The gardens were kept in a lovely condition and it was easy to walk around even when it was very hot as there was plenty of shade."
,,Absolutely breathtaking display,5.0,,"This is a treat for orchid lovers, but also for anyone who appreciates natural beauty. In the UK we only see these indoors in pots and usually single specimens so it was overwhelming to see such displays of these exotic flowers. We went early and were glad we did as the coaches started to arrive as we were about ready to leave. The large groups tend to walk through fairly quickly so rest on one of the many seats, let them go through and then continue to enjoy your visit.."
,,Orchid Crazy,4.0,,"If you love Orchids then this is the place to be ! It's gorgeous, a great place to walk about and for people interested in botany or nature it's perfect. Unless you like the greenery and flowers and enjoy walking about it will get boring so if its not your cup of tea avoid.

,,Incredible display of orchids,5.0,,"I was surprised that an orchid garden was the number 1 rated attraction on TripAdvisor but having visited I can now see why. The Botanical Gardens in Singapore are beautifully laid out and great for a wander but the orchid garden is quite spectacular. There is an overwhelming variety and number of orchids that really are stunning. I have taken hundreds of photos and will certainly have to edit some before showing friends when I return home, but it was difficult not to want to capture all the colours and displays."
,,Great afternoon outside,5.0,,"Great afternoon in the botanic garden, even it it was raining in between.

This is the highlight of your visit inside the Singapore Botanic Garden. The entrance fee is so worth it. You won't regret coming here and spending several hours because you'll be delighted to the max! Make sure you have visited all sections of the Garden. I particularly like the last section which is the coolest and the most impressive area inside the garden.

Don't forget to bring your camera! Every section, corner and spot is absolutely picture perfect!"

,,"Stop-Off on the Hop-On, Hop-Off Service",5.0,,"What a brilliant place. This garden is well worth the small entrance fee to get in. Unfortunately I was constrained by time but would suggest that you could easily spend one or two days in this garden and be lost within yourself. Beautiful orchids and again, lovely people."
,,Worth the effort,5.0,,"Tranquil .. pleasant and calm area in a bustling Singapore
Well worth the small entrance fee
I was pushing a wheelchair during this visit and can assure you a few hills and a couple drains
The walk way to the coolhouse is certainly not wheelchair person friendly and needs to be looked at by the garden staff and a few drains get lodged in wheels.
Otherwise good day out"

We saw groups of people practicing Tai Chi. The V.I.P. Garden has many interesting plant species planted by prominent world wide figures. Very much recommended. Take cool water with you. Souvenir shop very expensive."
,,must go,5.0,,"beautiful flower.
must go for the 1st time traveller
The National Orchid Garden is the only part of the Singapore Botanic Gardens to have an admission fee, but it is well worth the $5 charge. There are over 1,000 species and 2,000 hybrids, all beautifully displayed."
,,Lovely flowers,4.0,,"I've been 3 times now with various guests (my parents, in-laws and plant lovers) and it's always popular. If you enjoy flowers, the orchids and displays are lovely, and we are always entertained by the 'photo spots'. There is also a cool house which is interesting. Worth the entrance for the right sort of guest (my Dad was delighted by his OAP discount too!)"
,,Worth the Trip,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden is located within the Botanic Gardens and although the Botanic Garden offers free entrance and Orchid Garden has a S$5 (5 Singapore dollar) entrance fee and it is well spent.

I must admit that I was a bit disappointed upon entering the Orchid Garden in December due to the lack of blooming flowers but my disappointment quickly diminished as we continued to walk through garden and more and more flowers appeared.

If you love orchids and/or photography spend some time here. The tours seem to be a bit rushed if you like to linger. It is beautiful, serene and worth your time.

The National Orchid Garden is about a 25-30 minute walk through the Botanic Garden, (which is really a large city park) from the Botanic Garden MRT station or you can go to the Orchid MRT station, then take a taxi (then walk 5-10 minutes). Either way you will have to walk through the Botanic Gardens to the entrance of the Orchid Garden."

The drawback was the day we chose to go, it was extremely hot and muggy, making it less enjoyable. Bring a hat because the gardens have few arbors for shade as many other botanical gardens do. You can see many of the same beautiful orchids (and more) at the Cloud Forest at the Gardens by the Bay...in cool comfort."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Beautifully kept gardens, worth a visit. The entry fee is affordable and a few quiet hours in the gardens are relaxing."

,,Most Beautiful,5.0,,"Avisit to the Orchid Gardens situated inside the Botanical Gardens is a must if you love gardening/flowers and especially orchids. The gardens are beautifully maintained and have a large variety of trees, flowers etc.

The Orchid Gardens are exceptionally beautiful. We have never seen so many variety and many we did not even know existed. The colours and the way they are grouped together make it a fantastic way to sopend a couple of hours. Make sure you have enough time to walk the entire garden."
,,Probably the best in this region if you are into orchids,5.0,,A beautiful garden. A huge international variety. Some parts of the area is air conditioned to feature world varieties of orchids
,,Serenity in the heart of the city,5.0,,A delightful haven from the bustle and traffic of Singapore Always inspires and great place for selfies !
,,An Ingenious Marketing Strategy,4.0,,"Orchids are lovely, and native to more countries than Singapore. There are orchid gardens in many countries. However, Singapore has an ingenious marketing strategy. Whilst new breeds of orchids have been named after people who pay for the privilege of having beautiful and new flowers named after them, Singapore does a little more - it offers visiting dignitaries the same privilege. The resultant publicity is well worth the efforts. Queen Elizabeth is said to like the idea, and to have been telling the British Royals about it. In the National Orchid Garden, you could see orchids named after, for example, the Queen, Princess Diana, Mandela, and a whole host of other well known personalities. Well worth a visit!"
,,Not enough time,5.0,,"Fantastic place, just allow plenty of time as there is too much to see.
This was included as part of our day tour and we were allowed 40 minutes, and hence we missed the bus.
Unfortunately we could not go back in, so very disappointed as we could have spent the whole day in this place."

,,Beatifull,5.0,,"A beatifull and well maintenande Orchid Garden inside the Bothanic Gardens. There is no fee to access the Bothanic Garden park, but there is a fee for th Orchid Garden. tottaly worth it (about $G5)."
,,brilliant displays,5.0,,"The huge range of orchids were amazing. The tour we were on gave us only a short time to see the gardens, but we would have loved to have stayed longer as it was so beautiful!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"A great place for 100's of photos that I have no idea what I will do with them.
Whilst there we visited the kids garden and had a great lunch at Food for Thought.
It's a must do, even if you only see a small area of the massive garden."
,,A great visit,5.0,,"The botanical gardens are a great way to escape the city for a few hours, truly a tropical paradise, even in a dramatic thunderstorm. November& December are the wet months, so its a good idea to have an umbrella!"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,We enjoy our visit at the Orchid Garden. Was really nice and not expensive compare to Cloud Forest and Flower dome. A bit far from the center but nice ride in a taxi and not expensive. Would go back.
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,Don't miss the Mist House for exquisite orchids. You will keep taking photos as there are so many beautiful flowers. Don't take the MRT as the walk from the station to the orchid house is 1.2km and it is a long way in the heat.
,,You could explore for hours,5.0,,Worth every dollar paid and more! $5 entry fee. Really take your time and examine the flowers. You'll find hidden gems if you look. I found a garden growing inside of an orchid plant. The cool house was my favorite with carnivorous plants! Use the map to hit all the highlights. It's the largest orchid collection I've ever seen. Very diverse. Enjoy the peace.

,,great place for a leisurely visit,5.0,,"Plenty of space also lots of rain so take your own umbrellas if you intend to visit, although there are always plenty to buy & cheaply."
,,Orchid extravaganza!,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden, within the Botanic gardens, must be one of the best, if not the best, in the world. If you don't have time to walk around the botanic gardens then at least come here. To see something as beautiful and stunning as this for only $5 ( or $1 for seniors) has got to be an absolute bargain. I don't know how many varieties of orchid there are here but I've never seen such a display. All are labelled so you can note down names and varieties. They are displayed around fountains, on walls and pergolas.
Essential equipment: fully charged battery in your camera, notebook and pen and be prepared to be amazed! There are refreshments and toilets nearby and a gift shop near the exit.
One of the the top attractions in Singapore.....don't miss it!"

,,Beautiful a must see,5.0,,"In a word, this place is special and showcases orchids at their best! It enhances the experience when visiting the botanical gardens"
,,Beauty and wonder,4.0,,"The orchid garden presentation, itself only part of the Botanical Gardens, is splendid. There are more varieties of orchid than any of us might imagine (including now lots of hybrids). At all times of the year you will see a superb display. It is also so neat and the information is discreet but helpful
One interesting part is the display of orchids names for various famous world leaders of the past (some now infamous).
This is a place for quiet wonder. I would try to avoid it on very busy local holidays, as it is a great favourite of the local community as well as visitors."
,,Beautiful gardens for an afternoon stroll,4.0,,"A huge array of some of the best orchids in the world, expertly arranged amongst other flowers and shrubs.

Those with an artistic leaning will get some great closeup pictures of the flowers. Others can just wonder slowly taking in the sights, sounds and aromas.

The garden is split up into several zones where you can see orchids named after various heads of state and movie stars.

A relaxing way to spend an afternoon and well worth the admission price."

,,A must do if you have the full afternoon,5.0,,"As many people wrote, the National Orchid Garden located in the Botanical Garden is really something to visit if you have an afternoon free and if you like nature and flowers.
We had amazing time discovering the different species and admire the perfection of those flowers.
A little gift shop propose many different souvenirs linked to Orchid, which can be interesting if you want to bring some little present to your girlfriend/wife or mom.
We went there with the Hop On Hop Off bus.. it is a good solution to stop anywhere you want , but do not forget to check the time of the last bus departure from botanical garden in the evening... (we had to run after the bus...)"
,,Wonderful garden,5.0,,It is definitely worth it! You see there many different orchids and they all are beautiful. On top you can go in a cold conservatory and seamer exotic flowers.

The garden is very well laid down and maintained. You have a pleasant treat of colorful orchids. Do not leave Singapore without visiting Orchid Garden.
,,Good value,4.0,,A nice place to visit and very reasonable considering the main gardens are free. The orchids were of a very good standard.
,,Great attraction,4.0,,"Sorry, I love orchids, but I don't love them THAT much. What you need to know - it costs 5 SGD to get in, and it's about a 1 mile walk off the MTR. There were some great parts (cold room and mist room,) but I don't think I'd ever go again. If you love orchids and don't mind the 1 mile walk, go for it."
,,Don't miss it.,5.0,,Fantastic - unbelievable how many varieties of orchids there are and layout of the gardens is stunning.
,,Best free activity in Singapore,5.0,,"It is simply stunning, you don't have to be a plant person to appreciate beautiful things, Go there but beware getting a taxi back from there can be a very long wait, use public transport"
,,What a beautiful place to visit .,5.0,,They were doing a special Christmas display in the Orchid garden when we were there.The colours of the flowers were amazing!! The only thing that troubled me was the heat [ even in November] have to remember to carry heaps of drinking water.

,,a must see,5.0,,"if you are in Singapore, you must see this . Well laid out with excellent directions. You won't believe the number of orchids. There are other gardens as well. Go in the morning as it is very humid. There is a taxi stand to get back to your hotel."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"We took a cab from our hotel to the Botanical Gardens as from the stop that we were closes to [Bras Basah] it would have take 40 min to get there [according to our concierge]. I didn't realise this was inside the actual Botanical Gardens, but was glad it was as it was an amazing stroll through the gardens to the actual Orchid Gardens. We arrived at the Gardens at 8:30am and it was so amazing to see so many Singaporeans performing their morning rituals of running, tai-chi, and similar practices.

We paid to go into the Gardens and were so enthralled with the beauty of all the different types of orchids - I really recommend it to people who enjoy this. I am not an avid gardener of any type and I still enjoyed this.

I do suggest to go early in the morning as we left around 9:45 and it was already heating up. The walk through the gardens while not difficult does have a few hilly parts thus with the heat it would be quite a challenge."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Well worth the $5 admission fee, the orchids were absolutely stunning. The garden was well laid out and displays were beautifully done."
,,For garden lovers,5.0,,"The orchid garden unlike 'cloud forest' is more for garden/orchid lovers than casual tourists.I'm one and I loved it. However I'm sure party going types or even beach goers won't find it as appealing.there are tonnes of orchids and beautifully landscaped gardens and walkways.it does get humid here so wear only light clothing and caps/hats are necessary.

Orchid lovers:just gorge on the variety.but a little bit of luck and you might get to have a sort of floral carpet effect.some hadn't bloomed when I visited but the gardeners make sure 80-90% are In bloom.but seriously u wish the garden at home was like this."
,,For Orchid lovers,5.0,,"I have never seen a botanical garden with so many beautiful orchids, The park is quiet and clean, a fantastic place to relax and to admire nature. It's worth a visit."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,The variety here of orchids is fabulous . Its beauifull & well maintained. Each type has a description next to it.Never knew that orchids had so many variety.

,,most versatile collection of orchids,4.0,,it is a must see if you like these charming flowers. Nowhere I have seen such an impressive number of species.
,,THE SCOTTISH GLOBETROTTERS,5.0,,"Very seasonal displays for Christmas incorporating orchids. Very well laid out and signposted. Orchids of every shape and colour.

,,Lovely - even I'm not a flower fan,5.0,,"We went to the Botanic Garden and bought the tickets for the Orchid Garden (SIN $ 5 p.p.) and it was well worth it. Even I'm not a flower fan I really enjoyed it. The proposed walk way is really good and the Cool-House, especially on such a hot day, a retreat."
,,"Fascinating, especially for anyone who has grown orchids",5.0,,"Beautifully tended outdoor display garden with many specimens growing naturally on tree branches. There is a cool house with many non-tropical varieties, as well as a display of famous hybrids, many of which were made at the Singapore Botanical Garden.

The orchid garden in the only part of the SBG with a modest charge--almost nothing if you are a senior--and there are eating establishments at various places in the SBC.

I recommend arriving by taxi, which will place you at an entrance roughly in the middle of the garden and close to the Orchid Garden. The MTR (subway) entrance is at a far corner and requires a slightly uphill walk of more than a kilometer to the Orchid Garden. Come by taxi, leave by MTR.

The entire place is a WOW, and you'll probably never visit a more beautifully cared for large garden."
,,"Glorious garden, fabulous colours",5.0,,"Even if you're not a trained botanist, you will be blown away by the variety and colours of this garden. It's beautifully laid out in the mutli-level rockery, giving each species its own ""exclusive space"" to show off its forms and colours. You walk through the Botanical Gardens to get here, which is another wonderful stroll."
,,"You need to like Orchids, but they have a lot",4.0,,"You can actually visit the Botanic Gardens for free. Only the Orchid Garden cost $S5, but it's a small price. They are beautifuly kept, and it's interesting to see the huge variety! There's even cool areas for people needing to escape the heat temporarily."

,,We never visit Singapore without visiting the National Orchid Garden.,5.0,,You will never experience such a magnificent display of orchids anywhere else in the world. The rest of the park is also of interest with an abundance of wildlife. The café is excellent.
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,"We really enjoyed our time here, the plants and flowers were lovely, if we had been better organized we would have taken a picnic"
,,Surprising and beautiful,5.0,,"I thought this would be a ridiculous tiny garden full of flowers I've never really understood. Was I wrong! It was magnificent, and a major highlight of my trip. The locals are proud of the garden, and it worked as a great conversation point, wherever I went. The variety of colors, sizes, and types of orchids was astonishing, and the care given to these plants was easy to see. Whether or not you are interested in gardens, this is a truly unique and peaceful sight. It gets you out of the busy noisy streets too!"
,,Awesome! Great for nature lover.,4.0,,"This place is really awesome all people who like nature will love this place. Different varieties of flowers are available, very beautiful place, open space, rain forest and much more and lot of photo-shot spots as well for memories. Nominal entry fees. Can be done along with the city tour."
,,Every Colour Imaginable,5.0,,"If your an orchid lover and grower this is a must. Every colour, size and variety imaginable featured here. Set at the back of the Botanical Gardens - many photo opportunity spots. Great to see even if you don't have a green thumb as Singapore has the perfect climate to grow them and they flourish."
,,Most Beautiful Garden!,5.0,,"This is by far the most beautiful garden I have ever seen. There were a wide collection of orchids, all of which were stunning. It also offered a refuge from the heat whilst inside the scenic botanical gardens. It was the most well spent $5."
,,Awesome place,4.0,,"This is another awesome place in Singapore. If you're with your child, it's a free entry for parents, else you need to pay 10 SGD/person. Here are some pics http://www.thomasabeesh.com/2839/national-orchid-garden/"
,,Orchids for the Connoisseur,5.0,,"Set at the end of the wonder Botanical Gardens, the classic Victorian era building houses an amzing garden display composed of a fantastic array of named orchids. There are also windonw onto the propogation laboratories at the rear. Not to be missed on one of your visits."
,,It's a Garden,4.0,,"I'm not much of a garden person, but thought it was nice and scenic here and there were ""photo op"" pointers around the garden. Unless you absolutely like plants, I wouldn't have came here if it weren't for my friends."
,,Worth the visit in the heat,5.0,,"Loved the Orchids, shame I had left camera in the hotel and camera on my phone had a mind of its own that day. It has a lovely cafe near the Orchid section where we enjoyed a cooling mint tea"
,,Orchids,5.0,,Beautiful veriety of orchids in bloom in a great park that is easy to walk or to take a tram for a complete overview
,,Just make sure you keep a day free for this.,5.0,,"We travelled to the Botanic gardens and went into the Orchid gardens it was not expensive to go in. But the orchids were amazing, beautiful and some were so unusual. We did not leave enough time, a day would have been better!"
,,Very pretty,5.0,,Some great examples of orchids. Beautiful colours and very peaceful and when we visited it wasn't too busy so you could spend your time looking and enjoying the surroundings.
,,To visit absolutely !,4.0,,"The Orchid Garden is for Orchid Lovers, a place to visit absolutely !
The entry fee is quiet cheap (5$ or so), even less if you are senior. Full range of orchids are displayed. The only thing I was disappointed with it that they are not grown in the garden but this is just for display. It would be interesting to be able to visit the other side of the production...

The garden is not big but it is good. You can combine with a visit in the Botanic Gardens!

Also it is quiet far from the MRT station (with the heat !) so if you can I would adivce to go by bus and arrive at the other entrance."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Orchids grow wild in Singapore. They are everywhere! You see every variety imaginable. The National Orchid Garden was unbelievable in its beauty.
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"If you like plants, you'll like this. The orchids are particularly worth a visit, with a huge variety"
,,Great place for kids,5.0,,I take my kids to the garden and they enjoy it very much. The garden is not only a good scenery but also many games. They have a place where kids can play together with water. Bring the swimsuit.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"We didn't have enough time to visit all the park but what we saw was very well layed out and there were signs stating what the plants were, also signs helping to direct people to certain areas."
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,Wow those orchids are fantastic.... so many varieties and a good way to loose hours exploring place... it is so peaceful and very neatly kept....
,,"wonderful selection of orchids, relaxing",5.0,,"It's a decent area, and not too many people, just go in the late afternoon to avoid the heat! very nice stroll, don't miss the little enclosed space too where it's a cool air-conditioned break :)"
,,Worth the Entrance Fee,5.0,,"Even if you are not a flower person (or more specifically an Orchid person) a visit to the Orchid Garden is well worth it, especially if you are already visiting the Botanical Gardens. The entrance fee of SGD$5.00 is well worth it. The collection is quite large and well orchestrated.

- Keep in mind it does get very hot in the garden: cool clothes, water, and sunblock are recommended as there is little shade to hide under.
- There is a stand located outside the entrance to purchase water, but once inside you're out of luck."
,,A must for vistors to Singapore,5.0,,Just wonderful. We used the City Sightseeing tour bus to get to and from the gardens. Good café and gift shop.
,,Interesting way to spend a couple of hours,4.0,,"Great place to while away a couple of hours wandering around, I wasn't particularly looking forward to this, but I came away impressed by the exhibits."
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,"Loved it! Orchids are my favorite, and this place is absolutely beautiful. I recommend a visit! Be camera ready."
,,Great gardens,5.0,,The gardens are magnificent. Lots to see. The restaurant has great food. Getting there by train was easy.
,,A Wonderful Gem,5.0,,"We were wandering through the Botanic Gardens when we came upon this little gem. Yes you have to pay an entrance fee but it is very reasonable and well worth the price. The bulk planting allows you to really appreciate the colours and shapes of the flowers and can be quite dramatic. As an avid green thumb I could have spent hours here but the wife was seen one seen a dozen and kept me moving. Even at her fast clip we still spent a couple of hours here. I found it very relaxing and an oasis amidst the hustle and bustle that is Singapore. There is some elevation change in the garden but the paths were easy walking and it was not overly strenuous, plus there were plenty of places to rest along the way. Take the time to stop and smell the flowers, it is well worth it."
,,Not only for flowers lovers,4.0,,"Amazing. I am not a flower lover, but I appreciate beauty. The organisation in Singapore is one of the main characteristics. Need to spend there at least 3/4 hours"
,,A Nice Walk in the Garden,3.0,,"The tour guide told us to take a 20 minutes walk at the National Gardens. We confined ourselves to the scenic Orchid Gardens which offers tourists a nice restful walk among the blooming orchids of different breeds and in all colors of the rainbow.........pink, violet, fuschsia, and even the white dendrobium in honor of Princess DI. You can even have your own personalized orchid if you want all for Singapore $5,000,
We all had our pictures taken and the garden had other exotic plants....the ginger plant, the wings of the eagle, money trees. There were places one can rest on wooden benches if you get tired. Restrooms are available should you need to pee and the steps up are quite minimal that you won't run out of breath."
,,The scent wafts over you,5.0,,The orchid garden is in the Botanic Garden but you pay for entry. A visit is a truly beautiful experience and the scent wafts over you. Any visit to Singapore should include a visit.
,,Can't miss,5.0,,"If you like flowers, parks or nature this is a can't miss attraction. Be prepared to do a little walking, the Orchid Garden is within the Botanical garden which is a very large park."
,,good place to visit.,4.0,,nice place to visit a best place for tree lovers almost one should give 5-6 hours of time to enjoy the place
,,Definitely worth it,5.0,,"I had a glimpse on other reviews and I agree completely: the entrance fee is well worth the display. The orchids are stunning, their variety incredible, the walks through the garden are pleasant. It is just amazing. We were in the Botanic Gardens the afternoon before, but came too late to enter the Orchid garden. We were wondering wether to spend another half day there, decided to return anyway and didn't regret it."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"At S$5 entry we figured it was worth a look around. The whole place is stunning, everywhere you look was a different color or variety of orchid. Spent over an hour walking around, plenty of photo spots and walking tracks to get around. Took so many photos, couldn't recommend it enough!!!"
,,Orchids Orchids and more Orchids,5.0,,"It is well worth paying the entrance fee into the Orchid Gardens
Stunning displays of Orchids so beautifully layed out and a very easy walk through thr gardens.
We spent several hours in the Orchid Garden, unfortunatly we did not have enough time to explore the botanical gardens."
,,An orchid paradise,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is within The Singapore Botanic Gardens. We took the Hop on Hop off bus to get there.

While there is no admittance fee for the Botanic Gardens, there is a small fee for entrance into the Orchard Gardens. The grounds are beautifully laid out and the display of the numerous varieties of Orchids is stunning. Many of the displays/plantings have name tags, which is very informative when trying to identify an orchid species.

For we Westerners, the heat and humidity can be daunting, so wear light clothing and bring a hat. (I brought a fan too). There are benches to rest on, and small stores near the entrance where one may purchase cold water and soft drinks.

Plan on spending at least two hours here. If you enjoy parks and natural beauty, and especially orchids, then this is a ""must see"" while visiting Singapore."
,,Just beautiful,4.0,,"This is the only bit of the Botanic Gardens which has an entry fee, but definitely worth it. So many lovely flowers. There are also helpful designated photo spots for the snap happy! Try to go on a cool day as it is a tiring walk through the gardens to get there and there a limited resting areas."
,,"Singapore ""must do""",5.0,,The botanic gardens are nice but when you have finished the free experience pay the entrance fee for the National Orchid Garden for an absolutely stunning display of flowers. If you have been to Gardens in the Bay first and are wondering if the trip here is worth it ... then be assured this is MUCH better than the Flower Dome. I think it was five Singapore dollars each to get in each. Well worth the money.
,,You Could Spend Days Here,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden is amazing. It is within the Singapore Botanic Garden. You could spend a couple hours just in the Orchid Garden, and a day or two exploring the many acres of the Botanic Garden.
There also are restaurants, so this is a place to plan a few days of visit."
,,A riot of colour,5.0,,If you love orchids or just admire beautifully clipped and sculptured gardens then this is a must. Beautifully laid out and labelled we were astounded at the variety and colour of the orchids on display. It was fascinating to view the VIP orchid display as well especially the orchid created as a memorial to the late Princess Diana. Nice clean toilets and icy cold water to quench your thirst on a warm Singapore day as well. For $5 per adult it is a lovely low cost activity.
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,A lot of beautiful and colorful orchid. All of them are keep in great condition and arrange in amazing way.
,,So pretty!,5.0,,A must! so much to see! worth the $5! There are many great Orchids to see! The Cool room has a waterfall!
,,glorious orchids!,5.0,,"the botanical gardens are free, but, you must pay to enter the ""orchid"" garden. the senior fare was about $1.00sd. The orchids are glorious! I rate this as a ""must do"" in Singapore. I used the ""on-off"" sightseeing bus to get there and back."
,,Garden Like No Other,5.0,,"The garden is a huge display of the wonderful variety of world orchids. It has several smaller tropical areas (and a cool house!) with all kinds of orchids: common, rare, special breeds named after presidents and celebrities, and what not. Singapore has many attractions but I think this one tops them all. Entrance fee is only 5 SGD but note its opening hours as they are not the same as of the surrounding Botanic Gardens."
,,Beautiful but unfortunately rained all day,4.0,,Very beautiful even though it did rain for most of our visit Still worth a trip Do it as part of the city hop on off bus
,,Tour,2.0,,"We like the service and its very convinient,store nearby,restaurants,taxi stand but one thing we dont its the noise came out from the other room,its annoying"
,,very beautiful and relaxing,5.0,,there is an incredible number and variety of flowers. It is a nice place to spend 2 hours and relax. Also the shop is good.
,,Best collection,5.0,,The Botanical gardens alone is a great destination for a whole day but take time to see the Orchid Garden which is inside. The small entrance fee is worth the stunning collection of orchids. Some highlights include the species named after visiting dignitaries and the cool house for mountain-top orchids where you can escape the Singapore heat.
,,"Not huge, but very pleasant place to pass an hour",5.0,,"Very clean, well laid-out. Don't miss the cool house. Interesting to see the cross-breed named after VIP visitors. Worth spending several hours in the Botanic gardens, of which 1 should be in the Orchid Garden part."
,,National Orchid Garden is well worth the visit.,5.0,,The beautifully maintained Botanical Gardens are a great way to spend a few hours when in Singapore. There is a MRT station (Botanic Gardens - Orange Circle line) located at one of the entrance/exit points. It is well worth the $5 entrance fee to view...More
,,A must see if you have time in Singapore,5.0,,THis is a very special place in Singapore and if you don't have time to go and see all of the botanic garden make sure you at least see the Orchid. The different varieties are quite outstanding and the selection of colours and shapes of...More
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"We went this morning, beautiful gardens. $5 entrance fee for each adult was waived as we had a 'student' with us (my ten year old son!), so not only did we see many, any beautiful orchids, but it was free! On a hot day like...More"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"If you like Orchids, and even if you don't, this is the most amazing garden you will see, just go and see for yourself, you won't be disappointed."
,,One of the best sights in Singapore,5.0,,"Beautiful! Worth your while. After visiting Singapore a few times,this is one of the places I wouldn't miss."
,,Really pretty,4.0,,It was so lovely to stroll through the gardens (bring a bottle of water though - the heat and humidity are a lot more draining than expected) and seeing all the different orchids was a great way to spend a few hours.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Absolutely worth a visit. You can easily spend a whole day in the Botanic Gardens itself and at least a couple of hours or more in the Orchid Garden. The orchids are plentiful and stunning, so many different species and in a such a beautiful,...More"
,,A lovely peaceful garden,4.0,,"Did these gardens as part of a day trip in Singapore, and they were the best part of the day. Beautiful gardens, well laid out and easy to walk around. Takes about an hour or so to slowly walk round. A good shop with food...More"
,,Beautiful tranquility!,5.0,,Nothing to say that hasn't been said before. Well worth a visit a stunning collection in beautiful surroundings.
,,Peaceful garden with wonderful species,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is a must-see if you are on a quick trip in Singapore. Located in the center of the Botanical garden, it's a genuine peace haven where you can discover more orchid species than you thought could exist."
,,Vibrant Colours,5.0,,"If you have an eye for flowers and particularly tropical plants such as Orchids and Bromeliads then I completely recommend a few hours in the National Orchid Garden. The Orchid Garden is a part of the Botanic Gardens; but in itself takes you a good 3 hours to tour stopping for drinks and other rests.

I recommend you to take a stop at the VIP garden area where hybrids are grown to honour personalities and also the mist gardens.

There is a small fee; only for the Orchid Garden; and of course the obligatory ""shop"" which features a lot of pressed orchids.

There is a restaurant and small food/drink shop just outside the entry area; and there is seating around several shady trees to rest before going into the Orchid Garden."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Entry is only $5 and is worth every cent.

The Orchids are just stunning. Even if you are not a flower person you will enjoy a walk around the beautifully kept gardens. The Orchids are stunning, if you like photography take your camera. I used my macro a lot in the gardens and I captured some truly stunning photos."
,,Beautiful Flowers,5.0,,The orchid gardens are a must for people who enjoy seeing these gorgeous plants in wild abundance . I liked the facilities and the signage that explains the types that you are looking at . The entrance fee is minimal and goes to a good cause up keeping the gardens .
,,Highlight in Singapore,5.0,,"Had to visit the gardens again on my own as I missed the orchard garden. Well I absolutely loved the orchids, dazzling plants & layout I would go again & again, Luved the heads of state & celebrity orchards. Excellent idea I had to walk thru again & again & took a bunch of photos. Do not miss for the small $5.00 fee!!! Well worth the money."
,,BEAUTIFUL,5.0,,"A must visit in Singapore. Located within Botanical garden. Very good layout Although we know nothing about flowers, but we do enjoy the beautiful scene in Orchid Garden. PHOTOGRAPHIC TIME !!! Worth the entrance fee (SG 5)"
,,Natural beauties,5.0,,"Wonderful to see so many stunning orchids in one place. I never realized they came in so many varieties and colors. This is a worthwhile addition to a visit to the botanical gardens and I felt it was good value at S$5. There is a small shop selling sandwiches, drinks and snacks outside, plus a water fountain for free water top ups (essential in Singapore). More choice of meals at the cafe in the botanic gardens."
,,beautiful specimens!,4.0,,Well laid out and easy to negotiate. My only disappointment was there were to few. They are well known to be difficult to grow and this was obvious as there were many plants with no blooms.
,,beautiful flowers and well worth a visit,4.0,,"If you make the trip to the Botanic Garden then you need to make this one of the places to visit, especially if you are pressed for time! The layout of the garden is very well done, its so easy just to amble around looking at all of the different orchids at your own pace. I really enjoyed learning about the national flower and looking at the orchids named after celebrities. There are plenty of benches and gazebo style areas to sit down, rest or cool down if you need to.

Lots of opportunities for photographs so make sure you have space on your camera. Good gift shop as well with lots of little trinkets in such as paperweights with orchids in and similar items.

Definitely worth a visit!"
,,Worth A Stop,5.0,,"This section of the larger Singapore Botanic Garden is worth the time. Be sure your camera is charged and ready. It is colorful, beautiful and memorable."
,,Pretty place to go,4.0,,A great escape from the normal hassle and bussle. would suggest going during the week to avoid the idiots who want to mount every statue and those obsessed with selfies.
,,Best place,5.0,,"This is fantastic garden, never to be missed. Keep half of the day in your pocket to enjoy fully the orchard garden plus the rest of the park..."
,,Don't miss this!,5.0,,So many different colours... Worth seeing even if you're not a fan of orchids because there are a few other things too. Saw a mini pineapple too in mid-October!
,,Beautiful and so well done,5.0,,I love orchids and this is paradise every turn of your head you see natures glory in the most natural and well kept way DONT MISS THIS SITE it is wonderful .great shop as well I loved the gold dipped orchid jewelry it is such a clever idea and well made.good restaurant as well ENJOY
,,National Orchid Garden,5.0,,"A must visit when in Singapore, brilliant displays, this is our second visit and we will visit again if passing through Singapore."
,,For Orchard lovers,4.0,,If you have an interest in Orchards this garden is a must to visit. I have never seen so many different orchards in one location.
,,lovely,4.0,,"the flowers were lovely, well worth paying the entry if youre in the botanic garden! i really loved all of the orchids that were named after celebrities!"
,,Orchid Garden,5.0,,THe array and dispolay of flowers is stunning. Arranged in an artful and tasteful manner. it can be hot but it is worthit.
,,Jaw dropping,5.0,,"This has to be one the unique experiences of life. Whatever you do, if in Singapore, do this but make sure you have a large card in you camera."
,,A must!,5.0,,what a fantastic place to visit - the variety and colour of orchids are spectacular. It's easy to get to and we visit it every time we come to Singapore
,,Spectacular Orchids,5.0,,The displays and specimens were beautifully arranged. There was one cooled greenhouse area which was especially delightful in the Singapore heat. Some of the species seen here are quite rare.
,,like a paradise,4.0,,very nice place especially for take a photo different kind of flowers & plants named with famous people
,,Visual symphony,5.0,,"Having lived in Medellin, Colombia, I hvae seen many wonderful orchids in the garden as well as in flower arrangements. This place is at top of my list, except for the very humid weather of Singapore. Highlight of the trip."
,,finally I got my pendant!,5.0,,"even I'm not big fan of flowers, still could enjoy. My hubby bought pendant 8yr ago and I was looking for same/similar one. not china town, not in the city, finally I found it was gift shop in garden! hot but enjoyable."
,,Orchid Garden 2014,4.0,,If you want to see loads of colour this is the place to go. You could spend a nice half a day here just looking at the Orchids .Its a very relaxing place to go to.
,,a Singapore must see,5.0,,"This is the most amazing display of orchids, every turn reveals a new vista of amazing plants. Well worth a couple of hours with your camera. Tickets are only a couple of S$ so great value. The Orchid garden is within the botanical gardens which are free entry."

,,Good if you like gardens,3.0,,"Gardens and plants are not my choice but its a beautiful place, if you like gardens then visit, you will love it"
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,"As an -I can kill any plant gardener- this is truly not to be missed experience. Yes it's a bit hot and humid and it is a bit one pretty flower after another but if you got to Singapore you should see it. We ""passed"" on the rest of the gardens, but I expect they are probably just as spectacular. It is a superb display of colour and beauty and it will soften even the most weary and cynical old souls. Photo opportunities abound and there are a few interesting sculptures along with the orchids. An iced tea in one of the nearby cafe's/restaurants also hits the spot well! So drag them ho-hum blokes along girls and have a beautiful time- don't miss the little treasures in the souvenir shop on the way out."

,,Relaxing to walk among the orchids,4.0,,"Though not very big, but a very well lay-out garden with many varieties of orchids. I enjoyed walking, enjoying the garden. On the day I visited with a friend, there were so many tourists from China who were kind of loud, but we tried to avoid the crowns. The Orchid garden is located in the lovely Botanic Garden and costs $5 to enter. You can spend about 1/2 hour to 1 1/2 hours here, depending on your mood!"
,,Lovely garden,5.0,,"The most beautiful flowers i have ever seen. The breeze was relaxing and even though it was hot, it was nice to feel the sunshine"
,,Flowers and collors,5.0,,Wonderful place to visit. Quiet and beuatiful with a number of different collors of flwers. A peaceful garden nice for children and adults
,,A mini paradise in Singapore,4.0,,"We visited the Botanical Garden last weekend and decided to spend the SGD 5 per person to go into the Orchid Garden. I'm glad we did, because the grounds of the garden were well manicured and the variety of beautiful flowers was interesting.

Now, I'm not really that into flowers, but I have to say that the gardeners have created a little oasis in the middle of a big city. The smells and sights were very nice to take in and my daughter loved running around from flower to flower.

We'll definitely return."
,,Nature at its best!,5.0,,"This garden is situated inside National Botanical gardens. Although its a sight to behold be prepared to walk a lot to reach here. Walking shoes are highly recommended . Try and reach here early evening to make the walk a pleasant one. Be warned there are no trams here unlike other attractions in Singapore , so be prepared to walk !!"
,,Simply beautiful,5.0,,If you love flowers you will love this. The Botanical Gardens are wonderful and the Orchid Garden within is outstanding with many rare and hybrid specimens. A must do if you go to Singapore.
,,Lovely display,5.0,,"Brilliant and cheap entrance fee. Spend about 3 hours in garden, so many verity of flowers to see. Well worth the visit."
,,Peaceful Retreat,4.0,,"A great contrast from the buildings and the crowds in the city. Wonderful walkways around the park with a huge array of forna and flora. The lakes are filled with fish & terrapins and trails exhibit plants and trees of the tropical region. The Orchid Garden is well worth a visit, the park if FREE with a token charge of $1 for Seniors. Make sure you have a good supply of drinking water, a stroll in 30 degrees and 90% humidity is still a challenge but well worth it. Enjoy"
,,beautiful orchid garden,5.0,,if you love nature you would love this garden. we really enjoyed our visit to the garden....love the beautiful orchid ....and the swan lake...if you don't love the beauty of nature than this place is not for you....my son love walking around in this beautiful place
,,Blossoms galore,5.0,,A must for anybody visiting Singpore. Large variety of Orchids. Admission fee minimal. One ca spend a whole day in the Orchid garden and adjacent Botanic Gardens.
,,nice garden,4.0,,flowers are very amazing.... really worthtfull to visit . orchinds are very nice. if some is planning to singapore they should visit nationla orchid garden...
,,Agree with all the other reviews. This is worth a visit,5.0,,Botanical gardens inc. the Orchid garden is well worth a visit even if you are not an avid gardener. You could spend a full day wandering about but 2hrs or so would suffice if you were trying to fill a lot of the attractions into a few days
,,Nice if you love nature,4.0,,"My wife loves nature so she enjoyed the Orchid Garden a lot. Its located inside the botanical garden and ticket is 5$, if you have a couple of hours and you like flowers and plants then its a must go."
,,Orchids! A great new feeling for Orchids !,5.0,,Amazing layout and care taken to ensure the visitors go back with the best of flowery memories ...Am back here again definitely!
,,Where to go to see some of the best exhibits of Orchids in the world.,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is located inside the Botanical Gardens. It's worth the work to it.

There is a fee for going in. It made our visit to the Botanical Gardens complete as there are not many other flower exhibits in the Botanical Gardens.

The paths meander around the gardens and I was so surprised to see how big this garden actually was.

It has several zones some being in greenhouses others being set in stunning gardens.

It was lovely walking around the memory garden with lots of orchids dedicated to influential people from across all walks of life.
I enjoy the raised walk ways which too you up in the tree canopy.

These gardens are a photographers dream with different types of orchids popping up in every corner.

The garden does have some slopes so because not to slip as the air is quite humid as water is sprayed into the air.

You can easily spend a couple of hours in here if you are a photographer or plant lover. But a lot less if you are not.

It rained near to the end of our visit and there was not many places to shelter although the trees did offer some protection from both the rain and the sun on a hot day.

I'm really glad we visited as I always associate Singapore with Orchids and they didn't let us down.

It's definitely worth the entrance shop. There is also a gift shop there and just outside the entrance to the National Orchid Garden there are several cafés but non inside."

,,Unique in the world,5.0,,"Located in the reknown botanical gardens. Where in the world can one see so many different beautiful orchids without getting tired of them? This undoubtly is because of the well thought-through presentation including many orchids found very high up in the mountains that need a cool house.
If you have a student pass don't forget to take it with you as the price drops from 5S$ p.p. to 1S$ p.p.."
,,Definitely worth a visit,4.0,,The garden had so many varieties of orchids and were well maintained. It was easily accessible from mass transit on the Circle Line.

,,So beautiful!,5.0,,"We visited only the Orchid Garden section of the vast botanical gardens because of lack of time. It was just amazing - the sheer variety of the orchids on display, the beautiful meticulously planned layouts. Too bad we did not have the time or the energy to explore other sections of the botanical gardens. But I doubt if one can anyway do justice to the place in just a single visit."
,,A must to visit!,5.0,,What an amazing walk and display. More varieties of orchids than you ever knew existed. Allow plenty of time for the walks and to visit the different displays.
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,Been here for quite a number of times because I brought visitors. They landscape is very good so as the architectural design.
,,Interesting tour of the Orchid Garden,4.0,,Took the 4pm tour of the orchid garden with a really knowledgeable volunteer guide who seemed to know everything there is to know about orchids. Fascinating. Beautiful garden and much bigger than expected. Liked the mist garden and the diplomatic garden too. Definitely worth a visit and if you get the chance of a guide definitely take it.
,,Very pretty,5.0,,Loved the orchid garden and was happy to pay a small fee to visit. Hopped off the red bus to visit which was very handy
,,Go straight to the Mist House and Cool House - best spots in the garden!,4.0,,"After seeing all this pictured here on TripAdvisor I was expecting to see colourful flowers all over the park. Turned out that there is a small covered greenhouse in the middle on the park that has over 100 gorgeous species together on a block of few meters wide. Most of my photos from this one location within the park. It's called the Mist House and it showcases an extensive collection of rare, unique and award-winning orchid cultivars from the Gardens.

There's another cool place here - a rainforest simulated mountain -- Cool House - you gotta check it out! It is full of tropical plants, water and very cool breeze throughout. It really feels like some futuristic movie set.

The rest of the park is just a beautiful maze of various tropical plants, other orchid species with blossoms that don't really look like flowers and also squirrels. If you wonder into the actual Botanical Gerden, there's a lake with swans, turtles and giant real life dragons. Overall nice experience, but you have to go find the Mist House first - it's breathtaking!"
,,Just Lovely,5.0,,"I have written a more extensive review about the botanical gardens, but just to quickly add that that National Orchid Gardens are well worth the entrance fee. The garden is beautifully maintained and the orchids are so unusual and exotic. There are some very picturesque areas for taking photographs and it so relaxing walking around and looking at all the natural beauty."
,,Worth a Visit,5.0,,"Set in a lovely park, the orchid garden was a lovely relaxing area to stroll around. The plants on display were simply magnificent. The small entry cost to the orchids (the park was free to enter) was well worth the cost."
,,Orchids are awesome,5.0,,Outstanding displays in an incredible setting. Could have spent hours there. Hundreds of photos later and still can't choose the best.
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"A must go again place, if you are a garden lover. Beautiful setting for such beautiful flowers. You need at least half a day."

,,Wonderful Wonderful,5.0,,The botanical garden was something I would tell everyone to go and see. The Orchards were everywhere and stunning wonderful experience
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,"Set aside an entire day to visit the National Orchid Garden, which is embedded in the 74 hectares of the Botanic Garden. Wear comfortable shoes – there is a lot of walking! You can have lunch at the restaurant, or bring your own and have a picnic in one of the many scenic spots. Many different gardens within the Botanic Garden enchant, but none more than the Orchid Garden. The BG is slated to become a UNESCO World Heritage site and visited by many Singaporeans."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Getting to this location from the main shopping district is a bit of a walk. Take a Taxi or Bus. If you like beautiful flowers this is an amazing garden to go see.
,,Sensational Orchids!,4.0,,The Orchid Garden was value for money to see some of the best orchids I've ever seen! A lovely walk amongst the divine and diverse flowers! A must see if you love orchids!

,,Wonderful Orchids!!!,5.0,,"Beautiful garden with a very large variety of orchids secies. It is an explosion of colours, shapes, perfumes."
,,Beautiful way to spend a day,4.0,,Done this as part of a city tour. Gorgeous gardens which are very well laid out. So many flowers to see.
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,"This is the bargain of Singapore and even for people who don't care about touring gardens, this is awesome. It was a wonderful way to spend a few hours."
,,Perfect morning,5.0,,"Excellent ! Exactly as described , very informative , take a bottle of water to drink as Singapore very humid"
,,"Orchids, orchids, orchids.....",5.0,,We also visited these gardens in 2013 - can't stay away! Love the multitude of all sorts of varieties of orchids - almost every colour is included - even black orchids. Used the hop on - hop off bus to get there and spent around 4 hours wandering and photographing the flowers. A good respite from the traffic and shopping. Casa Verde at the entrance to the Botanical gardens is good value for meals as well.
,,Lots And Lots Of Beautiful Orchids,4.0,,"What more can I say? Didn't give it 5 stars because it's pretty hot - even near closing time (the Orchid Garden closes a lot earlier than the Botanic Gardens in general) - and there were biting insects (mosquitoes?). Not a ton of the latter - at least not by Florida standards. But enough to be annoying. Note that the admission fee for seniors (over 60 IIRC) - is 1 SGD (""senior rates"" in Singapore are usually limited to residents of Singapore - but this is an exception to that general rule) . So bring your camera and your bug spray - and you'll have a great time.

Another thing I'd note is that although our cab dropped us off very close to a park entrance (on a side road that wound through the Botanic Gardens) - the walk back to the Tanglin Road entrance area to catch transportation back to our hotel was considerably longer (probably 20 minutes for faster walkers - close to 30 for us older folk at the end of a long day). And catching a cab there from ""off the street"" took an additional 15 minutes or so (we didn't have our cell phones in Singapore - so we couldn't call a cab to pick us up).

Finally - the day we were there - there was an excellent show with a very competent band on the ""green"" adjacent to the garden. A little extra plus in terms of good listening while we were walking around. I don't know how one would look up similar shows there. But - if you figure out how to do it - plan your visit during a show like that!"
,,Visit from Australia once again.,5.0,,"Always a lovely place for a visit. Nice walk around the beautiful gardens. A great little café for a light meal. Easy to get to, hop on the Singapore stop over bus, if you are on a stop over."
,,This is a must see,5.0,,"Stunning or subtle, patterned or unadorned, intricate or simple, for those who love orchids, this is the place to visit."
,,Beautifulness,5.0,,"I like nature, and I saw a lot of different beautiful gardens. But orchids in the Nationsl Garden was really exciting and extremly beatiful. Must see, I think."
,,Beautiful Garden within the City,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden has an admission fee of SGD 5 and is totally worth it. It is located within the Singapore Botanical Garden which is accessible by MRT/bus. The Orchid garden has lots of beautiful flowering plants and a walk through it is definitely recommended. However, be prepared for a lot of walking in this area."
,,"Easy walk from Tanglin Road, a must for orchid fans",5.0,,"We made the easy 20 minute walk to the NOG from Tanglin Road. the grounds are immaculate in the garden which is adjacent to a large city park and botanical area. The orchid displays are very good, with other interesting types of plants, too. The place is spotless, as is most of Singapore. Definitely worth a couple hours of walking. We saw it in August and it was, however, extremely warm and humid. There is a good gift shop with great AC and a refreshment center."
,,Very good,4.0,,The variety is excellent and occasional specatular. It was nice strolling around and I liked the misty coolness.
,,Great collection of Orchids !,5.0,,Try to visit in the morning so can walk around enjoy nice weather and beautiful sense with Orchid ! Dont forget your Camera !
,,Beautiful place to visit,5.0,,"The gardens are well laid out with access for disabled and able bodied, the colours are amazing and the garden is clean and well maintained. There are shady huts dotted around so that you can rest which was very nice considering the heat. We visited as part of our day in the Botanic garden and thoroughly enjoyed it."
,,Beautiful Flowers,5.0,,These gardens are quite extensive for a single family of flowers. The blooms were amazing. Well worth the $5 entry.
,,nice grounds very relaxing,4.0,,"Recommended need half day to see it take a lunch sit in the grounds beauftiful flowers,enjoyed ourselves with our friends nice day out $1 for pensioners!!!"
,,Takes your breath away.,4.0,,"The garden is just full of wonderful blooms.
Stroll round at your leisure and enjoy the different orchids - the walks are signposted so there is no fear of getting lost. All the orchids are named and the landscape and paths are well maintained.
You need to spend at least 2 hours to enjoy the orchids."
,,Gorgeous.,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are free but for $5 you can enter the National Orchid Garden. I will admit that I am not a nature enthusiast and generally prefer to be sitting by a pool with cocktail in hand, but this is well worth it. I have heard it can get quite busy - go during the week if you can. Even if you are budgeting for an hour or so you will probably end up spending an entire morning or an afternoon in the Botanic Gardens. A taxi will likely drop you off at one of the main entrances of the Botanic Gardens, and then it is a (very pleasant) 20 - 30 min stroll through to the Orchid Gardens."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"An oasis of flowers in the middle of the city, nice and cool. Well worth looking at as it has many other plants and flowers from around the world. A beautiful place to take photos, a nice view of the city."
,,it's pretty self explanatory,3.0,,Garden full of beautiful floral species. It was pretty hot out though. So advice is to drink lots and lots of fluids. And dress appropriate to the weather!
,,Paradise for Nature Lovers!,5.0,,"The moment you enter the garden you feel like as though you have entered heaven especially for a botanist like me, it was a great sight to see orchids in different hues and colours, hybrids as well as natural species. The entry ticket is bit expensive but it more than compensates for the joy you get by looking at nature's craftsmanship. You can't help just admire nature and its gift to mankind!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Amazing displays of orchids from all around the world in a very natural environment. Like a large scale botanical garden, but full of Orchids."
,,A must see for the gardener,5.0,,while I have already reviewed this area in an earlier review I feel it justifies a mention on its own. In truth there are very few of what I would describe as 'must sees' in Singapore but this would have to be one of them. I seriously doubt if there is a finer display of Orchids any where else in the world. There is a small entrance fee of sgd$5.00 but it is well worth the cost.
,,Breath Taking,5.0,,Creativity at its best. The garden is a perfect layout of creativity. The plants blend in with the artificial giant plants. The light effects at night are breath taking.
,,Well worth the $5,5.0,,This place should be on everyone's list of places to visit. The selection of orchids is amazing. You can't help but take wonderful pictures. Try the nearby hawker centre 'Food Canopy' for great fresh food after your visit!
,,Stunning orchids but very crowded,4.0,,Orchids were great but I didn't like the volume of people. Don't visit on a bank holiday if you want any peace.
,,Colourful wonderland,5.0,,This National Orchid Garden is definitely worth the entrance fee if you enjoy natural beauty. There is a huge range of orchids all of brilliant colour and beautiful design. I really enjoyed walking around through all the beautiful gardens.
,,Definitely worth the entry fee,5.0,,A stunning collection of beautiful orchids from around the world. The garden is huge and it is definitely worth the relatively small entry fee.
,,Must see,5.0,,"This is a beautiful place and a must to see if you are in Singapore. The only thing the gardens lack is transport for the less able/immobile. It would be hard going, given the heat etc to push a wheelchair around and the provision of small trolley buses to take immobile people around would I am sure be very welcome. They have this facility at the Gardens by the Bay."
,,Spectacular [and I'm not even a gardener!],5.0,,We stopped in while on a morning walk in the botanical gardens. What a treat! The orchid gardens were very beautiful with a nice layout and some lovely picture spots. Highly recommended!
,,A real must,5.0,,The Botanic Gardens are free of charge but for just 5SGD you can access the Singapore Orchard Garden which is a real delight. A sweeping walk around the gardens with a couple of indoor temperature controlled gardens was a real highlight for us.
,,Best garden in singapore,4.0,,Easy access as the mrt station exits right at the garden entrance. The station is called botanic garden and is on the yellow line. Free entrance to the botanic garden and a nominal 5 singapore dollars for entrance to the orchid garden. Great collection and display of orchids and other plants.
,,Tropical Horticultural Paradise,5.0,,"The Singapore National Orchid Garden is a quick car or cab ride from the downtown area, We spent a very pleasant couple of hours there in July, 2014, while in Singapore basically on business. The Garden is very large in area and beautifully maintained, with paved pathways circling throughout. At the Welcome Center, a foldout map is available to help you find your way through. The vast assortment of hybrid orchid varieties--literally thousands--has to be seen to be believed! Each variety is clearly labeled. Midway through the Garden, what is called a Cool House is conveniently accessible for visitors to pause and refresh. Inside, the temperature is maintained at refrigerator levels, but as you are only within the building for a few minutes, you need not worry about a jacket or sweater! The plants and flowers inside thrive in the ""high mountain rainforest"" mini-ecosystem. I cannot recall now the cost of a ticket to the Orchid Garden, but the price is reasonable. You will enjoy your visit there, and be sure to bring your camera!"
,,Orchid extravaganza,4.0,,"This gem of an orchid collection is well worth a visit when you check out the Botanic Gardens in Singapore. For a small price you can fill your senses with orchid splendour, in a wide range of settings. Brides makes the most of the beauty of the garden for their wedding photos. I ever saw people dressed in yellow having special photos taken with the multiple arches of yellow orchids for a dazzling and fun effect."
,,Excellent place to admire orchids,5.0,,"Greatest variety of orchids, well showed and excellent facility to walk and admire. I liked all. Is the best orchids gardens I have visited"
,,A lovely open space in a busy city,5.0,,"There is a ahuge area to walk around but I find the heat soon drains the energy, need to go early before it is too hot."
,,Too far and no Orchids,3.0,,"Good variety of plants, well planned, But our luck did not favor us. Flowers were very few, the garden itself is big and too far away. Go only when the flowers are in bloom otherwise avoid. One thing worth seeing is the Coolhouse inside Orchid Garden"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"A beautiful landscape containing a huge collection of orchid plants. If you visit the botanic garden, don't miss the national orchid garden (admission fee 5 S$)."
,,Fantastic garden!,5.0,,I had a few hours free on one business trip to Singapore and decided to visit the botanical gardens. Once there I saw the orchid garden and decided to try it. I am not a flower fan in general but like to discover local natural gardens or parks. I was blown away by this orchid garden. The flowers were incredible and the walk was quite enjoyable. Since I had only a few hours I had to rush but rally enjoyed this garden and break from my business trip. If you have a few hours go visit!
,,Beautiful Orchids,4.0,,Nice place to view beautiful orchids. Has a fair bit of stairs and slopes that can be challenging for the elderly. We went with some seniors from Lion Befrienders and we took awhile to cover the area primarily because some of them found the terrain challenging & needed to rest a fair bit.
,,"A beautiful, worthy trip",5.0,,"Visited Orchid Garden after a search for worthy attractions in Singapore. The orchids and hybrids on display are superb and worth photo-snapping. Very vibrant colors and collections. Plus its very cool inside the park.

Just $5 as entry charge. An hour or so to spend. Totally worth it."
,,Pretty,4.0,,The National Orchid Garden was interesting and pretty. I loved the cool house and the array of flowers.
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,We only had a very short time ....unfortunately. What we saw was wonderful...we'll come back another time for a proper look around.
,,Unreal,5.0,,"Orchids orchids everywhere in profusion. Don't miss the VIP section featuring orchids named after world leaders and prominent personalities. A little walk from the nearest gate, you need to be mobile."
,,Colorful walk in the park,4.0,,"Going to the Orchid garden is somewhat like a walk in the park, but with colorful photos to take back home. It is a pleasent way to spend 1-2 hours, especially if you like exotic flowers."
,,Huge and very relaxed area of the city,4.0,,Maps are not very accurated but getting lost in this amazing gardens is not a problem ;) You need to pay for the Orchids part of the gardens but thee rest are free. There are restaurants and shops inside.
,,Lovely way to spend an hour,5.0,,Went for a wander to botanics yesterday and really glad I went into the orchid garden. Im not a massive gardener or botanist but I really enjoyed looking at the flowers and walking round the garden its 5sgd to get in and I thought it was worth it.
,,National Orchid Garden,5.0,,A beautiful variety of orchids set in a lovely scenic park. It doesn't matter what time of year you go there is always a show of orchids. The section representing mountain plants is refreshingly cool to see as a break from the heat of outside.

,,Spectacular Orchids,4.0,,"Stunning show of flowers in a lovely garden setting. A little disappointed with the amount of flowers on display as it was a somewhat bare in places and I have seen it better on other visits. But to the first timer, I'm sure they would be impressed. The most unusual are found in the greenhouse so don't miss these!"
,,An Orchid lover's garden.,4.0,,An excellent selection of Orchids very well presented in a realistic environment. A must visit attraction for Orchid lovers.

,,Great display,5.0,,"At only $5 entry fee, I doubt that any where else in the world you would see such a wonderful display of such rare beauty. Given that you them have the rest of the gardens to explore for free, best value around. Note that if you don't to visit the National Orchard Garden then there us no entry fee, but if you are visiting Singapore for $5 why would you miss out. Also the have cold climate house which us great to get 10 minute break from the heat and humidity, that alone I'd worth $5.

Tip, bottles of water were $2.50 at the cafe opposite the entrance to NOG, when you go in, to the right is a vending machine with same water for $1,30, just by exit."
,,Magnificient!,5.0,,Whoever visits Singapore nad has some time for sightseeing should visit the Botanic Garden and the the Orchid Garden located within. The amount and the varieties of orchids are unbelieveable.

I am a stessed Medical Doctor.I have nothing against plants.like them.try not to be roped in to dig holes etc. in our garden at home , except to please the missus.every now and again.

The Orchid sanctuary is astounding.It us going to change your life.. forever.

It is so unique, you will start talking to plants and play them nice baroque music.

A pre arrabged City Tour to the Gardens, was OK. Time was curtailed, to go on with the tour.

Go via Hopp on Hopp off red Bus.

Spend lots of unrushed time. Check out the gold plated Orchid flowers..unique to Singapore..Great gifts.
Best to Hopp off and Hopp on again, when done.plan for several hours.Good shop and place to refresh.

The 'mother in laws' all received 'Singapore gilded Orchid ' gifts. Bith of us are in their 'good report book ' now!

If we only do one thing in Singapore..we will take the Red bus..and go to the Orchid Sanctuary.

Do so before you die.. A must share with your loved ones... Take lots of photos with her and the orchids..Wow..quite amazing..She being more beautiful than all the orchids.

Your after life should then be filled with great memories.

Go visit, before you pass on.. or forever hold your peace."

,,Beautiful but wish the workers got recognition and better pay,4.0,,If you're in Singapore you know you'll be hot and sweaty.. So apart from that it was beautiful and inspire of that my elderly parents still thoroughly enjoyed their walk through! We met a lot of dedicated workers whom we thought were happy but on speaking with them we were sad to find out they are well underpaid and not really given any recognition for the amazing jobs they do.. They are very friendly and informative but after hearing how they struggle it coloured our otherwise awesome visit. Please do go and maybe take a little time to have a chat with them ... Or more..

,,Orchid Heaven,5.0,,"When we were leaving the orchid garden, I had the strong feeling that I'd seen every orchid there is. It is amazing how many perfect specimens of so many orchids there are at the garden. On the day we visited it was hot and humid (typical for Singapore) and we definitely took it slow and stayed in the shade as much as possible. Don't forget to go into the cooling house, an air conditioned room with cold-loving orchids.

I have never seen so many orchids in my life and they really go all out to make sure that you can get your fill.

Notes on getting there and getting back. I would take a taxi there but make sure to have a plan for the return because not all gates have taxis waiting. The app grabtaxi makes this really easy so that you can have your cab waiting for you when you come out of the Botanic Gardens. Hassim gate gets you closest to the orchid garden."

Take an umbrella anyway, shield yourself from the sun on the open pathways."
,,Great for name spotting,5.0,,"Whilst I am not necessarily a huge one for botany - the botanical gardens in Singapore (in general) are a great place to visit. Whilst you are there (and at no additional charge, as far as I remember) go to the Orchid House. One of the chief pleasures, here, is spotting all the famous people who have visited and had orchids named after them.

,,Paradise in Colour,5.0,,"I am an orchid lover but I don’t think you have to be into orchids or plants to enjoy this beautiful display of orchids and other tropical delights. It is just magic and is a natural transition after walking around the botanic gardens to then wander into the orchid garden, although there is a small entry fee. There are so many lovely orchids to view and it is certainly a photographer’s paradise.

It’s a must see while in Singapore."
,,Short visit,5.0,,The National Orchid garden would have been amazing if it hadn't been for the heavy storm that we endured. We still decided to grab the umbrella and have a quick walk through the garden. If I return to Singapore it will be something that will be on my to do list.

,,fantastic way to spend an hour,5.0,,"A wonderful display of many types of orchids and bromeliads in beautifully cared for surroundings in a section of the Botanical Gardens, this is really worth a visit.

,,Beauty at every corner!,5.0,,"The colours and variety of orchids were amazing, purples, pinks, yellows, creams and white. It is impossible to see them all as there are 60,000 plants so good walking shoes are an absolute must! (Plus an umbrella or poncho for the sudden downpours that do happen in Singapore).
I even saw the Tiger orchid thanks to our guide on a city tour which lasted for 4 hours. One negative was that as it was a guided tour, I couldn't linger over taking photos because of the limited time of 30 mins, so for serious photographers I would suggest you make it a separate trip and not have it included as one of the items on a tour. It is only $5 to visit the garden.
Late August, early September is a good flowering time."

,,Here a second time and still as good as the first,4.0,,"Botanic Gardens is one of my favourite places in Singapore- it's not crowded, it's spacious, it's beautiful.

No matter which part of the Orchid Garden you are in, there is an opportunity for good photographs and the explosion of colours will be a feast for your eyes.

The VIP Orchid Garden was styled as an English Backyard. Here, you will get to see the orchid hybrids of the Gardens' orchid programme. Many state visitors and VIPs have orchids named after them.

Besides this, there are also attractions such as the Tan Hoon Siang Mist House, the Cool House etc. The Cool House is meant to look like a tropical forest where there is cool air and mist. To imagine what the Cool House is like, it is something like the Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay, but many times smaller.

One of my favourite orchids is the Golden Shower or the Dancing Lady Orchid. If you look closely at the orchid, it looks like a lady in a ballroom dress dancing.

Japan has beautiful lavender farms, the Netherlands has beautiful tulip farms. and Singapore has a beautiful orchid garden! At an inexpensive price of $5, you could probably spend 2 hours in there just enjoying the wonder of nature.

Word of caution though- sunblock, cap and water are essential!"
,,One of the best places to walk in the world,5.0,,The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a great place to walk followed by a walking tour of the National Orchid Garden. The Orchid Garden is simply a beautiful place to enjoy. There is a nominal entry fee for Orchid Garden but well worth the price. But take the time and enjoy the walk in the Botanic Gardens.
,,Very nice,5.0,,"Great location, right in the middle of the Botanic Garden, very colorful, beautiful garden! It is however a few degrees hotter and more humid than outside of the garden so make sure to have a bottle of water with you if you decide to visit!"

,,Wonderful Garden,5.0,,"Loved this garden. The greenery and orchids are spectacular. If you love gardens you must pay this place a visit -you won't be disappointed. We used the Singapore Airlines Hop On Bus to get to the Gardens, the bus stops right at the gardens."
,,Go there and smell the flowers.,5.0,,"Went to the Botanic Gardens and the Orchard Garden was part of this. The layout was lovely, with the added bonus of the Orchids, well worth the visit to this, the only sub-tropical Botanical Gardens in the world."

,,Amazing,5.0,,A brilliant way to spend at least an afternoon. Spectacular gardens and completely amazing when they are all lit up in the evening. Well worth a visit.
,,Wonderful garden,5.0,,"I have never seen so many blooming orchids as I saw today in the National Orchid Garden, which is part of the Botanic Gardens of Singapore. It is an absolute must to visit. The garden layout is beautiful. It takes you at least one and an half hour to do this, entrance fee Sing $ 5.00."
,,A feast for your eyes,5.0,,Loved seeing such a variety of orchids and we enjoyed the Botanic Garden with its lovely trees. For those who enjoy the outdoors. Beautiful sculptures too.
,,a cut above,4.0,,This is so much more than we expected - the Botanical Gardens you walk through to get to the Orchid Garden are gorgeous. I had thought that there might only be a smattering of orchids in bloom at any particular time but there was so much beauty it was almost overwhelming.
,,Best orchid gardens...,5.0,,"even if you aren't a huge orchid fan there's plenty to see, and at only 5 bucks to get in it is a bargain. There are two enclosed areas, the so called cool house is not especially cold but it is a bit cooler than outside."
,,park review,4.0,,"Very big park,nice but very big.we got there via met and its a long walk to get to the opposite end.lovely park but a real pain to get a taxi back home though"
,,So-so,3.0,,"Went into the Orchid Garden for free once (yes, usually you have to pay) due to a student promotion. It was very crowded, and not much to see. Only saw a few different types of orchids and that was it. The rest of Botanic Gardens (free to everyone) is really much more interesting. Tourists, of course, won't want to miss it, but personally, I feel that it does not add much to the Botanic Gardens experience."
,,So much colour and variety...,5.0,,Charge up your camera battery and enjoy all that's on offer - an orchid lovers delight. The gift shop is a little overpriced but worth a visit none the less.
,,The visit was well worth the entrance fee,4.0,,"Set within the large botanic gardens, these gardens are separate & specifically dedicated to all things orchid. The map shows you where to walk and includes areas dedicated to the propagation of the flowers and a cloud mist greenhouse to show plants grown at high levels. If you go by taxi make sure you exit through the main Botanical garden gates. Very few taxis pass by the exit closest to the Orchid gardens - we had quite a wait."
,,tranquility in the middle of busy,5.0,,We went here as part of a guided coach tour. Very pretty and tranquil. Lovely setting and beautifully manicured.
,,Gorgeous,4.0,,"I like this place, loads of beautiful flowers and many beautiful photo opportunities. Very easy to walk around with a stroller and surprisingly larger than I initially thought it would be. Had to pay $5 to get in for an adult, but if you have not been there before, it is worth going in if you are looking for something to do with the kids or wanting beautiful photos."
,,out of this world,5.0,,It was mind boggling so many different varieties yet in the most relaxed gardens in the centre of the city You need a whole day and more to do them justice After seeing these amazing displays others throughout the world will disappoint you
,,Orchid Heaven,4.0,,If you love orchids this garden is a must. Beautiful flowers in their natural habitat and of course the most beautiful orchid I found was the Prince Diana White Orchid.
,,Simply Beautiful,5.0,,"Natural, vast, endless beauty... just when you think you've found your favourite bloom... there's another waiting alongside it! There are outdoor and some indoor spaces (very humid.. ) All well kept and pristeen.. It's so lovely to escape the mannic indoot malls and see the true beauty of Singapore here.."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"This is a beautiful, fragrant and peaceful part of the botanic gardens. I am very far from being an expert on gardens and plantlife, but this was a really lovely way to spend a couple of hours in Singapore."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"I LOVED the National Orchid Garden and felt it was totally worth the $5 entrance fee. I especially enjoyed the Mist House and the Cold House, which had orchids of very different climates, including carnivorous plants from around the world."
,,Simply beautiful!,5.0,,"The garden is filled with colourful and bizarre orcgids no matter where you look. I could have apent a whole say in this garden. The gift shop also has many beautiful souvenirs, one of which made a perfect gift for my love"
,,One of the best in the world,5.0,,I never visit Singapore without paying my traditional visit to the Orchid gardens as it s one of the largest species of orchids in the world. Every time seems better than the time before. Allow at least two hours to delight yourself
,,Espectacular orchids!,5.0,,"Don't miss this wonderful spot with different type of orchids. As all Singapore, it's a place with very high humidity."
,,Nice orchid display,4.0,,"A very well kept, interesting garden. I did not see extremely spectacular orchids, but definitely it is a good display. Some of the plants had no flowers, I guess it depends on the time of the year. While I would not say it is a must, it definitely deserves a visit."
,,Wow!,5.0,,A huge array of exotic orchids in an immaculately maintained garden within the Botanic Gardens. Well worth the very modest entry price.
,,A pleasant stroll,4.0,,If you like Orchids this bastion of tranquillity is absolutely marvellous. Even thought it's not far from Orchard Road you cannot hear the hustle and bustle of the city.
,,Expansive grounds and great selection,4.0,,"So many varieties of beautiful orchids, large grounds, you can lose yourself for a day or longer in the peaceful surroundings"
,,Simply Beautiful,5.0,,"This is a beautiful garden full of hundreds of varieties of Orchids and it is amazing to see so many in one place. You will see all different colours of Orchids and the layouts are cleverly done to blend the colours.

It is pleasing to walk through the garden admiring the flowers and I saw some kinds which I have never seen before and never knew they existed. So it is an experience itself and you will be amazed by what you see, specially if you are have a love for flowers.

Will be a good place to go with the kids too."
,,Do not miss this,5.0,,"Even is you are not a fan of horticulture, do go and visit the orchid garden - the infinite variety and the stunning colours of the flowers of the orchid family are just amazing."
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden is a national treasure in Singapore and not to be missed, even if you are not a plant lover. The variety of orchids is stunning and well worth a couple of hours. After the visit, see the rest of the Botanical Gardens and Gardens by the Bay. All worthy of a visit!"
,,"Well maintained, beautiful gardens",5.0,,Loved walking through the orchid garden - very beautiful. Only thing I would say is that you have to walk to the back to see some of the more unusual orchids that I thought would've been more of a draw at the front of the gardens? Also would be nice to see more strange orchids like monkey-face or white flying bird orchids. But overall a really good experience for only $5 (or $1 each if seniors or students)
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Despite the humid weather, walking around and seeing the beautiful display of orchids was worth it and more, definitely worth a visit"
,,beautiful,5.0,,"There is entrance fee im a student so i just paid 1$, the orchids are various and beautiful, some parts of the garden were being built and upgraded when i was traveling there"
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,"Colourful and well maintained. Close to the city via a city day tour and easy to get around. I love orchids, so I found this a highlight. Very well planned out garden."
,,Good Experience,4.0,,"it wonderful experience and worth of money to visit this garden , proper arrangement and wide space usage."
,,Great one,5.0,,"just great! If you like photography be ready for 2-3 hours of fantastic shoots. The location is quite convenient, taking a walk and relaxing in the park was great."
,,National orchid garden /Botanical Gardens,5.0,,Enjoyed this more than expected. Visited orchid garden as part of an overall walk through the botanical gardens. Wonderful photo opportunities. Go at the right time so that the heat doesn't spoil the experience.
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"Beautifully set-out, most incredible displays of over 1000 orchid types - the biggest collection in the world. Botanic Gardens are free, Orchid Gardens cost $5 each, so worth the extra cost. Lunch downstairs was cheap and cheerful, a great way to spend the last afternoon before an evening flight. Catch a taxi or bus home from the nearby hospital."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,The collection of Orchids and also the arrangement of the plants drove us crazy. Must do in Singapore.
,,Orchid paradise,5.0,,"This is a small garden packed with orchids of every color and size . There are lots and lots of places to take pictures but if you have the misfortune to arrive at the same time as a tour group , then patience is the key."
,,Worth a walk in the heat,5.0,,Beautiful garden well worth a visit. It's very affordable. I walked thru the Botanic Gardens several times on my visit stopping in the Orchid Garden once.
,,Nice Garden!,5.0,,"I love orchid and the flowers there. Amazing! If you are a flower fan, this is the place to go! We spent the afternoon there and enjoyed it very much. Took alot of photos as well."

,,Stunning,5.0,,Very beautiful and various species of orchids. Arrangement is very lovely. I took as many photos as I can.

,,Good if you like flowers,4.0,,"I'm not one for flowers and gardens, but this was a very pleasant outing all the same. If you like flowers, this is a great place to visit, $5 entry is very reasonable."

So many beautiful orchards, bromeliads and other plants all landscaped into a beautiful garden with walkways and great viewing areas. Great value for money. Don't forget to take the camera!"
,,spectaculor,5.0,,A must see when in Singapore. Try to go early or later in the day so you can give the orchids gardens the time they deserve. An absolutely beautiful place that I will return to. The botanical gardens are beautiful also and need time to absorb.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Go early in the morning,its just lovely. Must visit. Its spread over large grounds. There are orchid gardens in different zones, an extensive collection. A little garden of Eden. Come prepared for walking."
,,great,5.0,,the best thing you can do in singapore is go here i am not a flower or garden person but i loved this garden
,,A Must See,5.0,,"Even if you're only spending 1 day in Singapore, then this is a MUST see. There is a small entrance fee, but once inside the Orchid Garden, you will see the most amazing array of Orchids and colours anywhere. Take a stroll up to the Director's old house and read about the various orchids that have been developed for dignitaries around the world.The garden is easy to access, but be aware that there are some steep steps to climb in parts - so wear comfortable shoes. The first time we caught the bus and walked from the front gates, while the second time we caught a taxi there and back. We were staying in the Orchard Rd. area and the taxi fare was something like $S10, so it didn't dent our budget"
,,the orchidgarden and the gempictures,4.0,,"It was only a short tour from the hotel to visite the orchid garden and a gem factory. Very nice gardens, but the most interesting place was where beautiful 3 dimensional pictures are created just with small pieces of different gem stones and shells."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Located within the botanical gardens, this place is well worth a visit. The gardens are well planned and the orchids spectacular. Not the place to come if you are looking for peace and quiet - the gardens are better for that."
,,Just beautiful - a must to visit,5.0,,"I visited the National Orchid Garden in the Singapore Botanic Gardens recently. It is about a 1 km walk from the main gate and costs $5 to enter. It is just heaven on earth, beautifully maintained with an amazing array of beautiful orchids, massed and single, and lovely fountains. I especially loved the arches of dancing lady orchids, my favourite flower!"
,,Nice place.,4.0,,"It is a nice place with heaps plants and beautiful & colorful scenes. Orchid garden, will visit again.amazing!"
,,Don't forget this visit,5.0,,The orchid garden is one of the opportunities Singapore offers to appreciate nature. The place is amazing and the variety of orchids unbelievable. After you take the photographs you can visit the shop at the exit with some interesting things to keep as souvenir.
,,Just beautiful,4.0,,"The orchid garden was just beautiful, such a huge variety of sizes colours and varieties it was amazing ."
,,beauty to behold,4.0,,Loved the various colours of so many plants. Plenty of places to sit and rest and nice restaurants. Good signs and nice helpful staff around.

,,Orchid Lover's Paradise,5.0,,"WOW!!! Ang ganda!!! (Beautiful Place). For an orchid lover like me, this place is a must! You will love everyting in this place."
,,"Orchids, not awkward!",5.0,,This was an amazing display of most of the native orchid species in Singapore/ So many different colours and varieties. A joy to see.
,,Interesting and pretty,4.0,,"Be prepared for a long walk if you take the local bus - worth it and probably easier if you know where you are going. Amazing fish, turtles and swans in the lake in the park surrounds. Make a day of it."
,,A nice way to spend an afternoon,4.0,,"I'm not a fan of flowers, In fact I'm not sure if I even knew what an orchid was (I still don't). What's amazing though is the thought and planning that has gone into this entire park.

Even if you are not a fan of flowers you'll love this place just got the sheer magnitude of this exhibit. Like everything in Singapore, it was either go big or go home."
,,Orchids grown how they should be!,5.0,,"This is great value formoney at $5, check out the princess dianna orchid and many other hybrids named after famous people. This is a not to be missed day out in singapore. Take water!"
,,Very cool,3.0,,"It's a great place and onderful flowers to see , I went rice on days when it was not too busy. ,,good time. Late pm ,,,weekdays"
,,$5 to enter,4.0,,"not too bad, many varieties of orchids and a good chance to see the country's national flower. But wish we didn't have to pay though."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Amazing range of orchids. July was probably not the best time of year to see them in full show. Well worth a visist and one only really needs a couple of hours.
,,Saw many species of unseen orchids,5.0,,"I'm not an orchid lover but I always liked seeing flowers of different species that I haven't seen before. Here in the gardens I saw many new species of orchids, my favourites being the golden shower and the sakura-pink orchids. I also saw the longed-for Vanda Miss Joaquim, the national flower, although July when I visited seems not to be the blooming season for this hybrid orchid.

Personally I did not find strong interest during my visit but on an objective basis the garden provided plenty of services and sights for the common tourist and there is nothing to pick on!"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"What a beautiful spot. Stunningly kept gardens, great staff and the colour of the orchids were amazing"
,,Beautiful displays of orchids throughout the grounds,5.0,,It is not surprising the Singapore should have an outstanding National Orchid Garden as its national flower is an orchid. I'm glad that I do not use film anymore as I would have spent a fortune taking photos. Thanks for digital cameras. This is a must see along with Gardens By The Bay for gardeners and flower lovers.
,,"Orchids, orchids, orchids....",5.0,,"National Orchid Garden is a separate garden inside Singapore Botanic Gardens. You have to pay an entrance fee of S$ 5 but what you see is worth the money.
National Orchid Garden is rather big and there are orchids wherever you go. Mostly they are arranged in colourful orchid beds but sometimes they are also planted on trees which is their normal living environment. This orchid garden is including two enclosures. One is for orchids which need more shadow and humidity, the other one is a cool house. Here you can see mountain orchids which need a much cooler climate than Singapore can offer.
A souvenir shop at the entrance/exit. Rain shelters all over the garden.
Best way to go there is by taxi until Botanic Gardens. Then you have to walk. For the way back you can take a taxi or a bus which will bring you right down to Orchard Road."
,,Breathtaking.,5.0,,It was a bit crowded but the flowers were amazing. The gift shop had reasonably priced orchid souvenirs.
,,Beautiful place to relax,5.0,,"FREE to enter gardens it's well worth the $5 to enter the orchid gardens, you will not be disappointed."

,,orchids,4.0,,"Orchids, orchids and more orchids. Great show of colour and variety. Wish I could grow orchids like these"
,,A must visit,5.0,,I put this down as a must visit if visiting Singapore even if you are not interested in flowers and plants. The garden is sprayed with a fine watery mist that is a welcome escape from the heat. Part of the Botanical Gardens.
,,Paradise,5.0,,"If you go to Singapore you can not miss the Orchid Garden, is one of the most beautiful gardens I've seen in my life. Breath taking"

,,Spectacular!!,4.0,,"A spectacular display of a myriad of Orchids, a beautifully landscaped garden but I thought the entrance fee at $5 a head was a tad steep...."
,,"Orchards are pretty, hard to keep kids entertained",4.0,,The orchards really are pretty here but it was hard to keep my 4 yr old entertained for too long so you should plan a short tour. It's also very humid so wear cool clothing as you're outside most of the time.
,,Great place to see a wide range of Orchids,5.0,,"Great to be able to see all the different types of orchids, and the chance to buy mini plants, not sure if you can bring them to the UK though! They do sell them soil less though! And really cheap too"
,,Beautyfull,5.0,,The orchid garden is very beautiful with a wide range of orchid. The Botanical Garden is free of charge but for the orchid garden is an 5 SGD fee to pay. Make sure you visit the rest of the Botanical Garden as well it is very calm and peaceful. Go there early in the morning hours the MRT station is next to the entrance.

,,Nature Lover,5.0,,Very nice place for Nature lovers. Clean and the flowers are very healthy and well protected. Keep it clean and nice.
,,It is a must for lovers of Orchids.,4.0,,"You have to be a lover of orchids to appreciate this garden. I have been to many orchid festivals around the World including the one at the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew, London, however, I found this to be more of an orchid farm rather than a garden. It is spectacular to see so many orchids and such varieties but I did not think it was a site of great beauty. I could not understand why people would wish to have their wedding there ! It would look nice on the invitation, however, a bit of a let down when you actually get there. It is still worth a visit to see the individual orchids !"
,,Really beautiful,5.0,,"After a long flight, this is the perfect anecdote to jet lag and help you acclimatise to the hot environment and new time zone. The Singapore botanic gardens are beautiful and the Orchid Garden is just stunning. A lovely walk in the afternoon."
,,Must visit!,5.0,,Fantastic display garden and very good value for money. Take time to wander all the paths. Lovely shop with great gifts to bring home.
,,Lovely garden - must visit,5.0,,"The lovely orchid catches your attention the moment you step in. For $5 - it is totally worth it. The variety of orchids & vines are mesmerizing. We had the most romantic walk around this place. Since it is within the botanical garden, you can have a relaxed evening."
,,Just stunning,5.0,,The grounds were set out beautifully and the varieties of orchids will leave you gobsmacked. Highly recommend.
,,Well worth a Visit,4.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is a small part of the extremely large Botanical Gardens. It is the only place within the Botanical Gardens that charges an entry fee of S$8 for adults and S$1 for the over 60's.

It has a lovely collection of orchids and a cool house with cool climate plants. We would recommend seeing the Orchid Garden as part of a visit to the Botanical Gardens. Make sure you enter Botanical Gardens by the correct entrance or you will have a long walk to get to the Orchid Garden."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Spend time to browse through here, the Orchids are stunning! We were taken on this tour the first day we arrived and thoroughly enjoyed seeing all the beautifully looked after Orchids"
,,Beautiful blooms,4.0,,The national orchid garden is well worth a look if you are in the Botanic Gardens in the first place. There are some rare and beautiful specimens and the gardens have some scenic places for photographs.
,,Awesome place,5.0,,It was one of the stops on our city tour and it was the best so far! I could have stayed in the place whole day if we were not given limited time to view around. I was with my family and took charge in pushing my mothers wheelchair and we were all amazed with the beauty of the different kinds of flowers. I definitely need to go back there someday.
,,I am a flower lover. It felt as if I was in heaven.,5.0,,"This was a wonderful experience. Do go and see it. If you use the Hop on Hop off bus service, it is easy to get to the botanical gardens and within the botanical gardens you find this absolute wonderland of Orchids. One of my best experiences in this wonderful city."
,,An interlude with nature,5.0,,Fascinating tour through the orchid breeding programme. And I showed my Seniors card and paid a mere $1.00 entrance instead of the usual $5.00. Beautiful!
,,Such an amazing place,5.0,,"Had a little doubt about this, but it was amazing and never wanted to leave. The man made waterfall is something to check out for sure."
,,Wonderful colours,5.0,,"A lovely garden full of wonderful colours! Well worth the SP$5 to get in. Wheelchair and stroller friendly, though a map with arrows showing their recommended route to cover all the pathways would be welcome. To access the toilets, you have to go through the rather expensive gift shop.The cool conservatory was uninspiring apart from the welcome drop in temperature! A definite 'must-see', though if you are a flower lover."
,,"""Dreamy""",5.0,,National Orchid Garden of Singapore is really a Dreamy place. Those who really Loves Orchid will be amazed. Its a huge Area. You will feel escape there from the rush of the City.

,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"This was one of the 'must see' places on our list and even though it started pouring with rain, I was thrilled. The orchids are simply stunning."
,,FLORAL FANTACY,5.0,,"National Orchid Garden located inside Singapore Botanic Garden is undoubtedly the best attraction in the garden I went back to Botanic Garden a second time only to see the orchid garden again leisurely.An entry fee of S$5 is charged but I being a senior citizen (60 years) had to pay only S$1! The garden is full of exotic orchids arranged,displayed and maintained painstakingly in an immaculate manner which is highly praiseworthy and absolutely breathtaking!
It is therefore no wonder that this exquisitely beautiful garden is showcased to visiting dignitaries. It is centrally located near orchard road and botanic garden MRT station is right at the entry gate of botanic garden So, whenever you are in Singapore, either on vacation or business, find some time and visit this beautiful piece of natural beauty and you will thank me for suggesting this visit"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,What a place this is!! $5 Singapore to enter. But so so worth it. If you love orchids this is the place for you. There is a cool room as well to cool of in.
,,Floral heaven,4.0,,This was a glorious display and showcase. Even if you do not grow them it is totally fascinating. Wonderful colours
,,very beautiful,4.0,,I really wanted to see the Princess Diana orchid. I got to see it! I also wanted to see the WIlliam&Cathrine orchid. I couldn't find it at all! Nowhere! I was dissapointed by that. But i still loved the garden. The whole place is quite beautiful. But its outdoors and HOT!
,,Orchid Paradise,5.0,,National Orchid Garden is located inside the Botanical Gardens and a fee is charged to enter the Orchid Gardens. Wide variety of Orchids and many colours on display. Used the MRT from Singapore to get to the National Orchid Gardens which is very convenient and easy to use.
,,Fantastic well worth a visit,5.0,,"We went on a visit to this garden, a small entrance fee to the orchid garden, certainly did not disappoint. Very well worth a visit."
,,Orchid orchid orchid!!!,5.0,,The botanical garden is very nice. The vegetation is trimmed to the maximum. Cleaning is an order! The variety of plants is abundant! The botanical GIARDNO is beautiful! Although a fee! The number and variety of orchids is awesome!
,,Blooming Marvellous.,5.0,,This was more for the wife. She was taken aback by the colours and variety of plant life on display. She took it upon herself the track down the Prices Diana Orchid.
,,Don't miss these wonderful displays,5.0,,The orchid collection is located within the Singapore Botanical Gardens and a modest supplementary charge is made to access it. But it really was worth every cent if you love beautiful flowers and floral displays. The colours were quite breath-taking and the professionalism of the displays was a joy to behold. It wasn't surprising that foreign leaders and global celebs were regularly shown around the collection. It really was something quite special - don't miss them!
,,Beautiful & peaceful experience,5.0,,If you love nature it is for sure must do experience. It is beautiful and so peaceful there. So many different types of orchids. It doesn't take long to see everything. Just make sure that you wear comfortable shoes and have plenty of water with you. Entire area outside the Orchids gardens is beautiful and lovely green. If you plan your visit in the afternoon don't forget the mosquito spray!
,,Best place in the Botanical Gardens,5.0,,"I loved this place!!! It has awesome plants and it's huge (the biggest orchid garden in the world, I think). As a student I had to pay only 1 dollar, and I'd say it was the best dollar of my trip =D"
,,A piece of paradise,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden within the confines of the vast and wonderful Singapore Botanic Gardens is quite simply, the most tasteful, exquisite, tranquil, stunning, and lovely garden that you will visit anywhere. I have visited many flower gardens, but this exhibit, which showcases a vast and stunning array of orchid species interspersed between foliage, trees, manicured beds and colonial-era buildings (equally as impressive as the orchids) is the finest flower garden that I have ever visited.

The loving care and aesthetic detail devoted to this garden is without rival. I suppose that the gardens of the Taj Mahal in its full glory may have been a historical rival, but in our modern world, nothing comes close as a flower garden. This is the best 5 dollars that you can spend in Singapore. If there is a paradise, it may well look like the National Orchid Garden (sans 94% humidity).

Take the time to visit the larger Singapore Botanic Gardens as well. This splendid institution is the result of almost 200 years of loving care and development from generations of botanists and plant lovers. Explore all the marvelous corners of this outstanding public garden. I am lucky enough to live in Sydney - with its historic botanic garden on the harbor foreshore surrounding the opera house. But the National Orchid Garden makes this look like the weed pit in my backyard."
,,Stunning Natural Beauty,5.0,,"Loved everything about this place - so peaceful and beautiful, a great place to visit when in Singapore."
,,"A peaceful walk, amazing orchids",4.0,,"The grounds are very pleasant. It is worth paying to see the orchid garden within the botanical garden. It is very hot, but you get a reprieve in the Cool Room where the cool-climate orchids live. I have a greater understanding of orchids now"
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"A wonderful sea of tranquility in this bustling city; the Orchid Garden is located in the National Botanical Garden. The entire area is lovely, great for a relaxing walk. The Orchid garden is a bit of a walk from the MRT-but it's a lovely walk, so that's really the point. If you like public parks, this is a definite visit."
,,A good day out,5.0,,"Great value and enjoyment for all the family. Beautiful flowers and well kept gardens, nicely laid out."
,,Stunning,5.0,,There is a small fee to enter from the Botanic gardens and its worth every penny. I'm no flower enthusiast but this was a wonderful visit.
,,A true one off,5.0,,"Within the botanical gardens, which are free, but a very reasonable fee is paid to enter the national orchid centre. You will be amazed at the varieties of orchids and the clever layout. The orchid is the national flower of Singapore, the variety that is the national flower is not the most exotic of varieties, but it grows in profusion, and is presented brilliantly. There a section with varieties of orchid named for famous visitors to Singapore which is interesting. There are also many clever and beautiful sculptures blended into the arrangements. A truly wonderful experience."
,,Fantastic flowers,4.0,,Well worth a visit beautiful flowers and scenery . It is abit out of the city we got a taxi as we were short on time but hot a bus back .we had a Volcher so did not have to pay but it was not expensive. Take your camera it was just fantastic
,,Stunning,5.0,,Loved it all. Hard to describe but a must do in Singapore. Easy walking and wheelchair friendly. The orchids are varied and the way they are staged is superb.
,,Average Flower Display Poor Transport Connection,3.0,,"At S$5 entrance fee the Garden is worth a visit, although the orchid display, IMO, was rather average with limited quantity. Do not expect seas of flowers like flower bed or flower clock. What deters me most is the transport - if you come by yourselves, i.e. not on a group tour, you will have to walk at least 15 miuntes from the nearest taxi stop to the entrance of the Garden. That is to be honest a leisure walk along a plain path but if you have old folks with you this is not sth leisurely, esp on the return route. Expect at least 30 mins on foot from the Botanic Garden MRT."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"The Botanic Gardens are so beautiful and the Orchid Gardens are a must-see. It is so peaceful any serene, which is strange when you think how close you are to the noise and traffic outside. The Botanic Gardens would take half a day to cover, but the orchids are in a corner near the Orchard Rd gates so you can easily confine your visit if you want."
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"I've always been a fan of Singapore's orchids, and this is really an orchid-lover's dream come true. Went in the morning, not too many people. The Garden is divided into a few areas, with different classes of orchids in each one. The variety, in addition to the beautiful arrangement, is simply breathtaking.

The entrance fee is 5 dollars per person, and is definitely worth it. Absolutely gorgeous place. Definitely a highlight every time I visit Singapore."
,,good collection of orchids,5.0,,"The drizzles during our visit added more charm to the beautiful orchids. The entire botanical garden takes more than 3 hrs to cover, however, for the orchids section alone, 1 hr is sufficient to browse."
,,Nature's beauty on full display,5.0,,"Located within the Singapore Botanical Gardens, the National Orchid Garden requires a small separate entry fee but is well worth a visit. The Botanical Gardens are easily accessible via the MTR, with a stop right outside the front entrance.

So many varieties of this wonderful genus on display, infinite in their varieties of colour and form. There is also a sealed cool-climate orchid display, which is a lovely oasis on a steamy day.

If you enjoy beautiful gardens and in particular, orchids, this attraction is a must."
,,perfect stroll,4.0,,a very pleasant walk among a very tidy and beautiful garden. Well done. Take your infants in a buggy and enjoy the views. Mind the sun when it shows...
,,Charming flowers,3.0,,"The variety of orchids are good and beautiful. However, there's only that much one can do besides appreciating the view and flowers. It doesn't help that it started pouring."
,,Orchids and more orchid,5.0,,"Loved the variety of orchids, especially the slipper orchids. I also enjoyed the bromeliad display. Good value for money"
,,Number one sight in Singapore,5.0,,"This is my favourite sight in Singapore, located in the botanical gardens. If you only have time for one, this is so much more nicer than any of the new sights. It's like an oasis in the heat and away from the crowds of the city. And of course the orchids are so beautiful! For a tourist the easiest way to arrive is by taxi or the hop on- hop off bus."
,,Orchids Galore,5.0,,Our hotel has an exceptional display of these flowers but this garden is just magic. The species are amazing and just when you thought you had seen it all there was more!

,,Something a bit different,4.0,,The orchid garden was nice for something different to do and I got some great photos. The cafe in the botenical gardens was nice for lunch as well.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"I could come back time and again to photograph, admire and just be amazed by the beautiful display of orchids. I never seem to tire of them, they are truly beautiful. Even if you've been here before it's always worth another visit and at $5 entry fee it's possibly the cheapest thing you'll pay for in Singapore."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Scenery is beautiful and a goldmine for photos. All the flowers were lovely as well as the water features, however it is very humid and it started to get quite uncomfortably hot, so I would definitely recommend wearing light layers. The greenhouse is a nice escape from the heat and we stayed there for quite a while. Everything is very well-kept and all the plants looked very fresh."
,,Beautiful and worth the visit,5.0,,The orchid garden is an extra ticket inside the botanic garden but so worth it. Make sure you include it on your trip to the gardens
,,Gorgeous,4.0,,"I recommend to those people who loves flowers like me. If only I have more time, I will spend more time to look at every single of the orchids they have. So beautiful"
,,Nice Garden but is a bigger place to walk,5.0,,"Singapore Botanic Garden are beautiful place to go and walk fresh area during morning. Nice view when you having walking around to see different types of plants. Would recommend to go for CDL green gallery because is a good place to see how green and special building by using zero energy building without using main source. They are using solar panel for electricity as supply.

Can take photo with family and friends. This place have change alots since i was childhood time."

,,I Can Live Here!,5.0,,"These are some of the most beautiful orchids I have ever seen in my entire life! Orchids are my favorite plant, but I can never keep them for more than a couple of months. I literally stood there looking at the orchids for over an hour. This is definitely my favorite place in Singapore, I love beautiful flowers."
,,A Big Wow,5.0,,Orchid Garden truly fantastic. So many different varieties and the colours!! Great for photos too. Nice souvenir shop which sells unusual gifts with prices to suit everyone. The heat though nearly killed us !!
,,Orchid Gardens,5.0,,"My sister, niece and I just drooled with envy, wishing our orchids would grow like that. Around each corner there was yet another surprise. I took many photos."
,,Worth the hassle,5.0,,"Loved the Orchid Garden but beware the humidity. Travelling with my elderly mother, we found the walk to the garden too much for her. Next time I would take a taxi as they are cheap and it would be much easier leaving energy to walk around these magnificent gardens. Wonderful photo ops."
,,Garden City's Most Beautiful Garden,5.0,,"A great place to be! Forget about the hustle and bustle of the city, stress and everything else in this beautiful world of flowers. There are so many different kinds, colors and breeds of orchids that it almost feels like your dream come true of ""The tropical paradise""!"
,,Great experience!,5.0,,"Good place to hang out with the family for half a day if you are interested in these type of things. The orchid gardens is just right inside the botanical gardens and we spent the best part of a day exploring both. While entrance to the botanical gardens is free, the Orchid gardens are not. However it was well worth the money paid."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The gardens are beautiful. The range of different types and colours of orchids was amazing and well worth making the time to visit. The walk through the adjacent botanic gardens from the subway was also very nice.
,,The Largest Display of Tropical Orchids,5.0,,"A myriad of orchid blooms meets the eye here: stunning or subtle, patterned or unadorned, intricate or simple. For those who love orchids, this is the place to visit. I was also able to see The National Flower of Singapore since 1981 which was discovered by miss Agnes Joaquim in her garden in 1893 a very beautiful orchid. This is a must see for those who love tropical orchids."
,,One of the highlights in a somewhat sterile city state,5.0,,"This was a very beautiful garden and most enjoyable even for someone like me who is not much of a flower expert. It was an icredible display of how many shapes, sizes and colors this flower can take and all the arrangements were very tastefully made. It certainly was one of the highlights of our Singapore visit. In addition the park offers open air concerts in the evenings."
,,Amazing Orchids,5.0,,"This garden is a definite visit on any trip to Singapore. Beautiful orchids in a tropical setting. The entrance fee is very low, but be sure to have enough space on your camera storage card!"

,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"I am not usually a fan of gardens but loved walking around the Orchid garden. A great escape from the rush of the city,
It does get very hot and humid so remember your bug repellant and sunscreen. While there I watch several tours being rushed through so if you can do this separate from a tour so you can take your time."
,,Making wives happy,5.0,,"We were in Singapore to make a childhood dream of mine come true on my 60th birthday and it was great. My wife is an avid gardener as as part of my thank you to her the trip to the gardens was planned, not for the faint hearted I might add Bo wanted to see it all and we did. Great day out so much to see we live in Thailand and our garden is full of Orchids my wife's favourite flower so she was excited to see so many different varieties, one memorable moment though away from the flowers was in the restaurant when not to enamoured with her soup she asked the waiter is this out of a tin? That apart great day out not to be missed if you are a gardener or just love plants

I guess I have been spoilt for choose in Gardens, as I found it to be lovely but on par with others."

,,Don't Miss It,5.0,,"What a treat. One of the most beautiful gardens I have ever seen. Serene, stunning at each turn and worth every moment. To pass this up would be a shame.

Then you go to the Orchid Garden and can't believe the sizes, colors and types."
,,Excotic,5.0,,"Beautiful, exotic, interesting you won't like to come out spending your all day. One of the must see in Singapore."

,,Away from it all,5.0,,"Lovely tranquil few hours spent here, beautifully maintained and well worth a visit. There are various pathways leading to different themed sections of the gardens so depending on your time you decide which areas to view.

The only cost we had was viewing the orchids at 5SD per adult and was money well spent."

Under the old system of photography I would have run out of film

I would definitely recommend a visit

Visited December 2010"
,,Definitely cannot be missed !,5.0,,"I visited the Orchid garden and it was much more pictureque, scenic and lovely than expected. It is so well maintained and has a riot of flowers. Pick up a map and you can cover everything in an orderly manner. The flower and plant species are labelled with their scientific names and some information about its origin etc. Its a paradise for flower lovers. Total time of visit - 2 hours. Highly recommended"
,,So many orchids!,5.0,,"I'm terrible at looking after plants, specifically orchids, so my visit to the National Orchid Garden in Singapore left me in awe. There are so many beautiful orchids and other plants here, obviously well maintained and treated with love. If you're in the Botanic Gardens I recommend visiting the orchid garden. There is a small entry fee but it's well worth it. It took us about an hour in total to walk round and take lots of photos."
,,extremely beautiful,5.0,,"Even if you are not into flowers you should go here, perhaps it will change your mind. Singapore has an ideal climate and they have taken a lot of care to make this place something special. The orchid garden itself is located in a huge and very attractive park (which even includes some original rainforrest) and while the park is free, the orchid garden requires an entrance fee of 5 SD."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"What a beautiful serene place, well worth a look if you have time as are many of the gardens in singapore"
,,Beautiful Orchids at a cheap price,5.0,,"They have loads of beautiful and colourful Orchids at this National Orchid Garden. If you find yourself in the Botanic Gardens, where the National Orchid Garden is located, it is definitely worth it to visit this place. With so many different types of Orchids and related plants there is more to see than you would expect at first. If you take a slow stroll through the Garden and take the time to view most of the flowers you can easily spend 2 hours here. Definitely worth the 5SGD per adult."
,,Stunning,5.0,,The whole botanical gardens are gorgeous and wonderful to stroll through. You do have to pay admission to the orchid garden but it's worth it. The orchids are just amazing. Many different varieties and beautifully displayed
,,A futuristic place I ever visited -must see at night,5.0,,"If you want to see something great with young kids, please take them here, but be sure to do it at night..the flowers are different with the lights
We took a bike-car (two people per bike and had great music) from Marina Bay Sands and you can see all around.
We were a bit late, be sure to arrive around 8pm and we couln't go up the bridge.
There is MRTstop that will take you here if you do not want to go to Marina Bay"
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Loved the array of different orchids, it was like another world in the Gardens, really serene. The different sections of that along with the Botanic Gardens were beautiful. Well worth the visit."

,,Dont miss,5.0,,"We took the metro on the Circle line to the Botanic Gardens station - couldn't be easier!

The gardens are great, very pleasurable to walk round at leisure - though obviously hot at peak time during the day.

The Thai orchid garden was within these gardens and fantastic - don't miss it. If your backpacking the Thai orchid garden is very cheap and the Botanic Garden is free.

We expected to spend a couple of hours here, but stayed for the afternoon - headed to Little India on the metro for dinner after.

We had lunch in the botanical garden also, which was reasonable to above averagely priced, but if you're on a budget you could bring food / picnic."
,,great flower park,3.0,,If you like flowers and plants this is a good park. Many different and nice looking flowers so see. I would say that one hour is enough to see it all.
,,great,5.0,,"beautiful flowersl the and were lovely well worth the journey , if you are in Singapore do not miss this"
,,I expected more,3.0,,I am hardly a 'botanist' but I do love flowers and I had expected more of the orchard garden in the way of more flowers and interesting displays. The botanic gardens were nice to walk around but I would put it in the category of 'do it if you have time'.
,,For Flower Lovers One and All,4.0,,"A beautiful place. The flowers are lovely and the displays are magnificient. Our guide told us to give a lady friend, going out on a date, an orchid in Singapore would be like giving a lady friend a dandelion in the USA."
,,""" Just fabulous""",5.0,,"If you love orchids you must visit the orchid garden when in Singapore, very well displayed just beautiful."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"A calm, fresh spot amidst the bustle of the city. The flowers were just stunning. Lovely to see the staff preening the flowers with such pride to keep them in tip top condition."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"This is my 2nd visit to the Orchid gardens and its always amazing. The variety and displays of Orchids here are stunning. You don't need to be a garden lover to be able to appreciate the beauty on display here. There are also some stunning trees in the Orchid gardens. The Botanic gardens themselves are also worth a visit, but try and come early in the morning, or in the evening - midday can be incredibly hot and steamy. We saw a massive goanna or lizard of some sort in the gardens as well."
,,Orchids,4.0,,Some beautiful orchids and very well presented gardens. The gardens are worth a visit even if you are not particularly a flower/garden person.
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"It is in The Botanical Gardens and part if the on/off bus routes. You have to pay an additional fee to enter the orchid garden, but worth every cent."

,,Photoworthy!,5.0,,"Such a variety of orchids beautifully displayed. Well worth a visit.
The coolhouse was a good tip from a fellow tripper- the montane orchids have a nice cooled area with a stream trickle through. After the uphill push and the wanderings in Singapore heat it was a lovely break! The gardens are lovely not only for orchids but the varieties of ginger and bromeliads were excellent. The staff are obviously working constantly to maintain quality displays. Well done gardeners!"
,,Orchid Garden,5.0,,"This garden is located in the Botanic Gardens and was full of beautiful flowering orchids of many different colours. There is a fee, but being a senior it only cost S$1 which was well worth it"
,,"Top attraction, wonderful to do in the morning before the heat hits",5.0,,The Singapore Botanic Gardens are a special and must do visit. The National Orchid Gardens is something to do with a special person or the family. Recommend a visit early in the morning to beat the heat. Breakfast and lunch at the cafe is pretty good. You can get some very good local fare plus the usual western bacon and eggs. A very pleasant way to spend a morning.
,,Great for the spirit!,5.0,,Outstanding botanical beauty. An oasis of peace and tranquillity in the busy city-state of Singapore. An amazing range of orchid varieties.
,,Incredible..as expected,5.0,,Friends had raved about The National Orchid Garden..I can totally understand why.Make sure you have plants of time..and lots of camera battery.

,,A must for a chilled out afternoon,5.0,,"The botanic gardens have a lot to offer especially as they are free, but the orchid garden really steps it up a notch. You pay a little to get into this part but well worth it, especially with visiting parents, families etc for a gentle amble around."
,,very nice,4.0,,"Being a big fan of orchid myself, it was amazing to see all the different varieties and colors that exist in that garden! I was maybe missing some descriptions here and there on the orchid varieties..."
,,Flowers everywhere,5.0,,"I went to KL in September and I had low hope of seeing a lot of flowers in bloom. I decided to walk around the botanical gardens, and definitely got lost there. After coming out of the Bird Santuary, I found the Orchid Gardens directly across. I decided that since I was there I would give it a shot. Definitely worth it. There were flowers everywhere. So beautiful. It isn't a huge area, but definitely filled with tons of beauty. Well worth a stop. Plus, it is free!"
,,SINGAPORE BOTANIC GARDENS,5.0,,"Think this is part of the Botanic Gardens.. I wasnt too fussed about going but so glad I did. A huge but interesting garden and the Orchid Garden is part of it.. superb array of flowers, you cant fail to be impressed."
,,An orchid extravaganza!,5.0,,"I used to like orchids. Now I love them! The National Orchid Garden, inside the Singapore Botanic Gardens, has an abundance of orchid species of every colour and size imaginable - each one is more breathtaking than the last. I never dreamed there could be so many gorgeous orchids.

Getting to the Botanic Gardens is easy by MRT (train). Get off at Botanic Gardens Station. But it's a bit of a walk to get to the Orchid Garden itself, so take a hat, sunscreen and water to have an enjoyable trip."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,The orchid garden is well worth a visit but with this and the rest of the botanical gardens it can get very hot so bring plenty of drink with you as there are not many places you can get drinks from. The gardens are very well laid out and beautifully maintained.

,,Great place to visit early morning or in the evening,5.0,,it is a lovely park with lots to see. visit the orchids which are in a cool place. Too hot to visit in the afternoons so go early morning or late afternoon.
,,Best orchid garden ever!,5.0,,Well worth the trip. take the hop on hop off. Take your camera as there are too many beautiful pictures to miss.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"OMG. I never knew there were so many orchid varieties in the world. Spectacular. I also recommend the prix fixe lunch menu at Halia restaurant, just next door in the Ginger Garden. Food was excellent and prix fixe keeps the cost down."
,,Immaculate,5.0,,"There is no entry fee for the Botanical Gardens themselves but there is a reasonable fee for the orchid garden. We'll worth it in my view. The gardens are well set out and maintained and of course the orchid is such an attractive plant that seems to have been invented for photographers. Our second visit, last time six years ago, and still very enjoyable."
,,Beauty of Orchids..,4.0,,The garden is very well maintained for all the possible varieties of Orchids & other flower plants..
,,National Orchid Garden,4.0,,"Nice orchids and a lot of them plus a lot of different beautiful flowers. A bit too hot to spend too much time there,but nice experience."
,,Didn't know there were so many types!,5.0,,"This is the place to come if you're an orchid fan, or even if you appreciate beauty in simple things! You'll walk away with the awareness that there are so many types of orchids, with so many different colours!

One highlight is the ""Cool House"", which is an air-conditioned enclosure designed to simulate the cool highlands - orchids from these highlands are kept here."
,,An orchid extravaganza!,5.0,,"I used to like orchids. Now I love them! The National Orchid Garden, inside the Singapore Botanic Gardens, has an abundance of orchid species of every colour and size imaginable - each one is more breathtaking than the last. I never dreamed there could be so many gorgeous orchids.

Getting to the Botanic Gardens is easy by MRT (train). Get off at Botanic Gardens Station. But it's a bit of a walk to get to the Orchid Garden itself, so take a hat, sunscreen and water to have an enjoyable trip."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,The orchid garden is well worth a visit but with this and the rest of the botanical gardens it can get very hot so bring plenty of drink with you as there are not many places you can get drinks from. The gardens are very well laid out and beautifully maintained.
,,Lovely place!,5.0,,"Well worth the entrance fee, super gorgeous orchids and flowers. Huge place and plenty of photo opportunities. Will definitely return!"

,,Best orchid garden ever!,5.0,,Well worth the trip. take the hop on hop off. Take your camera as there are too many beautiful pictures to miss.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"OMG. I never knew there were so many orchid varieties in the world. Spectacular. I also recommend the prix fixe lunch menu at Halia restaurant, just next door in the Ginger Garden. Food was excellent and prix fixe keeps the cost down."
,,Immaculate,5.0,,"There is no entry fee for the Botanical Gardens themselves but there is a reasonable fee for the orchid garden. We'll worth it in my view. The gardens are well set out and maintained and of course the orchid is such an attractive plant that seems to have been invented for photographers. Our second visit, last time six years ago, and still very enjoyable."
,,Beauty of Orchids..,4.0,,The garden is very well maintained for all the possible varieties of Orchids & other flower plants..
,,National Orchid Garden,4.0,,"Nice orchids and a lot of them plus a lot of different beautiful flowers. A bit too hot to spend too much time there,but nice experience."

One highlight is the ""Cool House"", which is an air-conditioned enclosure designed to simulate the cool highlands - orchids from these highlands are kept here."
,,So many varieties,4.0,,But go early in the morning - we left it until late morning and it was very hot and humid - we wished we had got up sooner!
,,"Colorful display of orchid varieties, recommended for a morning leisure walk",4.0,,"It’s a long walk from the Botanic Gardens MRT Station to reach the National Orchid Garden, which took us around 20-30 mins (of leisure walk), so best be in your comfortable walking/running shoes. The whole experience of walking to reach the orchid garden though was very enjoyable, refreshing and relaxing especially in the early morning. Entrance to the Orchid Garden will cost you SGD5.00

Orchids are such distinct beauties. Here, they come in so many different colors and species, surely your eyes are in for a treat. There is a main area where you will see the collective display of orchid varieties, which was amazing. The landscaping around the garden has been carefully designed for any visitors to enjoy a peaceful and leisure walk while marveling at the natural beauty of the surroundings, and there are a lot of opportunities for picture taking. Apart from this, there are other lovely facilities inside, such as a small cooled and isolated garden house, where you can have brief break from the heat. We also enjoyed the VIP orchid garden area where you see a huge old-looking house and other exotic collections of orchids and flowers. Around this area, there are drinking fountains (with cold water) and toilets and is also good spot for resting after much walking inside.

On our way back, we had our lunch at the food court located next to the Raffles Building, at the foot of Healing Garden, which is still inside the vicinity of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The food there was great, lots of choices and budget friendly."
,,Mesmerizingly Beautiful,5.0,,"I visited the Botanical Gardens early one morning to beat the heat. The Orchid Garden opens at 8:30 a.m. and is quite inexpensive, so I ventured inside. Loved it! They had orchids in every color and in varied gardens. Fabulous."

,,Wow upon Wow!,5.0,,"Being orchid growers in Australia, we were keen to see the National Orchid Garden in Singapore and weren't disapointed. It was really well set out, lots of 'wow look at this one' moments. There was also a cool climate orchid house (not a lot in flower when we were there) plus a bromiliad house which was interesting. Definately worth a visit if you love your orchid flowers!"

,,Great Value for Orchid Lovers,5.0,,"This is an immaculately presented attraction with excellent signposting and the world's largest collection of orchids. The entry fee of S$5 is great value for this world class attraction. We ended up spending over an hour there before moving on to the Botanic Garden which adjoins the Orchid Garden. It's a good idea to take some water with you and maybe a snack as it is not easy to buy snacks once you get there. However, there are plenty of toilet facilities which are very well maintained."
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,"Very extensive orchid garden well established in various levels. Peaceful and spacious. Cost app 2SGD to enter but is worth it. Go in the morning before it gets too hot and too crowded, you can easily spend few hours here - bring a book and enjoy the quietness. Dont forget the indoor area. Located inside the botanic garden close to orchard road."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Well, it is the national flower of Singapore, so you'd expect such a proud citizenry to have such a breathtaking display, won't you? Still, it's more than worth the trouble, and revisiting."

,,A colourful sight,5.0,,Woth making the trip and its different every visit. The Botanic Gardens Singapore is very well kept and worth paying the entrance fee. A nice place to spend the evening.
,,High on our list of Singapore treasures,5.0,,"A visit to the National Orchid Gardens was one of the highlights of our stay in Singapore. Although the garden only covered a small portion of the Botanic Gardens area, it took us a considerable time to fully explore and appreciate the outstanding plants on display. The vast array of orchids and their many differing colours encouraged us to linger and enjoy these beautiful blooms, and it was disappointing to reach the exit after spending an extended period in this lovely garden."

,,Beautiful.,5.0,,Easy to get to on hop on bus. Botanical gardens in general are beautiful and very peaceful and relaxing to walk around and picnic in if you have enough leisure time.
,,Just okay,3.0,,"The orchids were lovely, yes, but the orchid garden was waaay too far from the MRT. The garden was okay for a picnic and enjoying the scenery, but I think that if you're traveling with kids, the Gardens By the Bay might be a better option because of the air conditioning and informative interactive displays."
,,A piece of paradise on earth,5.0,,"Well worth the heat. A magic and colorful place, rare gem in the world's panorama today. Make it there early morning...great fun for all, relaxing and extremely well maintained. Two thumbs up!"

,,Beautiful Place,5.0,,"The National Orchid Gardens are a part of the huge Botanical Gardens, situated towards the Orchard Road end of the Botanical gardens. There is an entry fee of SGD 5.0 per person for the gardens.

Its a great place with a huge variety of beautiful and colorful orchids and greenery all around. One can easily spend a couple of hours just gazing at the variety of flowers. There is a cool house as well, housing some of the flowers, and gives some respite from the heat of Singapore.

The gardens also have basic options to eat, and a good souvenir shop at the exit as well, although the gifts can be a little pricey.

A must visit, especially with family."

The small fee of $5.00 ( senior and child discount also available) is well worth entry to see the spectacular Orchids Gardens.. Lunch was lovely in the grounds and there is also a coffee shop, restaurant and two gift shops, go early to avoid the heat."
,,So many,5.0,,This is a great garden for the Orchid lover. I have never seen so many in one place. The gardens are tranquil and lovely to wonder in

,,Averagely pretty,3.0,,"This was a nice garden full of orchids, but I think I have been to much better gardens in North America, where we do not get the weather so easily. A good family outing if you want to stop and have a picnic."
,,Very pretty,5.0,,OMG I haven't seen so many beautiful orchids in my life spent hours here and didn't get to see it all will be back for another visit omg my camera was going and have used so much memory make sure you allow lots of time to just walk and look at the flowers they really keep this clean and lots of seats to stop and look
,,BREATH - TAKING,5.0,,you cannot visit SG without visiting the orchid garden. it's simply breath-taking! even my kids (9 and 6 yr olds) couldn't believe how gorgeous and huge the orchids were!
,,beautiful,5.0,,well worth the nominal ($5) entrance - hundreds of beautiful orchids that made my camera work overtime
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Part of the botanical gardens this is well worth the small amount of money to pay for entry. The guided tour is interesting but not necessary. The beauty of the plants speak for themselves. All in the whole place is well worth a visit.
,,Paradise of colour,5.0,,A wonderful spot in the beautiful botanic gardens. An amazing variety of orchids (at least to me) and it seemed that about half them were in flower creating a breathtaking display of colour. Easy to stroll through the displays which include fountains and trees to create beautiful scenes. There is a cool house which can be a great relief from the heat as well as including some insect-eating plants which the kids might enjoy.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,You need to walk a longgg way before you can get to the orchid gardens. But it's worth it. There's a large variety of orchids. Especially the VIP orchids are a must see!
,,Orchard Garden Singapore,3.0,,"Did this during a half day city tour, it was pretty cool but I'm not really a flower kinda guy and I was with two buddies..."
,,Very well maintained,5.0,,A location where you can find vast verity of orchid flowers. I swa first time such vast verity of orchids
,,Colourful place,4.0,,It's a great place for ppl having interest in flowers and plants !! Must visit with family and young kids
,,Vast Collection of Orchids,4.0,,"We visited the National Orchid Garden on May Day. For a small entrance fee, the Orchid Gardens are a must to any visit to Singapore. We spent approximately an hour at the Orchid Gardens wandering around the paths and greenhouses, combined with a good half day visit to the Botanic Gardens.

There was a comprehensive gift shop at the entrance to the Orchid Gardens too, with an Orchid theme naturally."
,,Beautiful Orchids,4.0,,We had a very limited time here as rain was pending but well worth a visit. Neat tidy and very colourful.
,,Stunning orchids,5.0,,What an amazing collection of orchids really colourful and beautiful and well worth the small entry fee.An attraction that one definitely should not miss.
,,Where are the orchids?,2.0,,"Living in Singapore, the botanical gardens is the first place I take out of town guests. For the first time ever, I paid the fees to bring guests into the National Orchid Garden. We were all disappointed with what we saw … or didn't see. Most of the orchids were not blooming. In fact, the most we saw were outside the gates of the National Orchid Garden entrance, where everyone takes photos.

I do have to say that Singapore had a very dry spell, and perhaps that was why there were so few blooming orchids, however, I know that they water the plants, so this isn't really a good reason. There were hoses laying out on the sidewalks all over the place, so if you are bringing elderly guests with you, as I did, be sure that they don't trip over a hose!!"
,,beauty,5.0,,what a sensational section of the gardens and so imaculatey presented the Taj Mahal experience of Singapore plant after plant of near perfection WOW
,,Well worth the visit. It is special.,5.0,,"In addition to a wide variety of orchids there are many of other flowers on display in a beautiful setting. The ""cool"" greenhouse is cool."
,,Beautiful but limited quantity of Orchids,3.0,,The orchid garden of the botanical garden is the only part you have to pay for and at $5 it is well worth it. The hilly garden makes for an easy and fun walk with various orchids along the way. Each orchid is beautiful on its own but the garden would have been more
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Amazing variety of orchids with detailed information about the cultivation and development of various types. Interesting to see the orchids named after celebrities and famous people. The gardens themselves were wonderful
,,Surprisingly good,5.0,,I'm not a flower person as a rule but a walk around the Orchid garden was well worth it ! Very nicely set out.
,,Lush time-out,5.0,,"Beautiful range of orchids, no traffic noise! We had a great time wandering around in an environment that isn't too ""built""."
,,Definitely one of the best botanical experiences in the world!,5.0,,Absolutely one of the 'must see' attractions in Singapore. The orchid and bromeliad collections are just superb!
,,A must go place for Orchid Lovers,5.0,,"I was in Singapore for four days in April and visited the National Orchid Garden. I have been to Singapore many times before but mainly on business and I can only find time for this tour because I have recently retired. I was lucky the weather was sunny and bright on the day of the visit and the Garden was accessible by MRT, the local subway system as well as bus services. The Orchid Garden is part of the Singapore Botanic Gardens which houses hundreds of species of orchids and one can easily spend over two hours to appreciate the vast variety of colorful orchids in the complex which is mainly open air. I would strongly recommend that you do not miss the VIP Orchid Garden which features orchid hybrids named after world dignitaries who have visited the place - you may be surprised to find one named after your countryman. The air conditioned Cool House near the end of the orchid garden tour was a welcomed retreat from the warm weather. Beware however that it may not be a good idea to go on a rainy day and the MRT exit while close to the Botanic Gardens entrance is quite far from the Orchid Garden which is on another end of the compound albeit a walk through the garden may be welcomed by outdoor lovers."
,,Nice Place,3.0,,Nice place and pleasant afternoon as part of a half day tour. Best suited to those with a passion for orchids and gardens.
,,Family Outing,5.0,,"The Singapore National Orchids Gardens has many varities of Orchids. They are very Beatuiful, different shapes and many colours. It is an eye opening for young children which they cannot see at the Florist gardens. It is worth to visit the Singapore National Orchid Gardens."
,,Cool orchid garden,5.0,,"Within the Botanic garden, it has a variety of orchids that we can see in Southeast Asian. It's so nice and beautiful garden. I really enjoy it."
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"Very nice garden,a must-see while in Singapore. The cool house was the highlight for obvious reasons"

,,Beautiful place,4.0,,"This is a beautiful place, I can see a lot of orchids, colorful. If you like photography, this is one place that you should visit in Singapore"
,,Orchids galore,5.0,,"Allow lots of time here, at least a couple of hours are needed but longer if you can. You will not be disappointed."
,,Beautiful Oasis,5.0,,What a beautiful oasis. I loved walking around seeing all the different orchids. I never knew all those different kinds of varieties existed. I could have spent hours looking at all the different orchids.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Located within the Botanic Gardens the Orchid Garden is the star of the show. A wide variety of interesting looking plants, not just Orchids. Various sections, including a cooled section (when it's 34°C outside we were rather grateful) Well worth the money paid to enter."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,Had a quick tour of the National Orchid Garden as part of a Singapore city tour. Really liked the garden and the variety of orchids there. It was really beautiful. I would recommend Singapore travelers to find at least a couple of hours to spend at this place
,,Astonishing,5.0,,"We are always quite attracted by this kind of parks and I have to admit that in this particular case we were not at all disappointed. We arrived just after a rainy couple of hours, so the weather was fresh and the flowers clean and shining. Magnificent variety of orchids. Highly recommended."
,,Nice Decorated Garden,3.0,,"Many photo spot, but I think they can build more.
If the admission is not as big as SIN$ 5, this location may be more attractive. Another option is to add the existing facilities, such as the description of the development of Singapore orchids in a more interactive display or larger garden spot for each type of orchid."
,,Orchid garden,4.0,,Beautiful - go there. Costs $5 entry but the orchids are impressive. Liked everything about it. Didn't like - nothing
,,amazing,5.0,,its amazing . the whole atmosphere was totally different to anything that I had ever seen before . would highly recommend to anyone there is nothing there which I didn't like
,,If you've seen orchid gardens in US u won't be impressed,3.0,,"This is a lovely place to visit, the setting is completely different from amazing gardens in US and Canada, but orchids are usually smaller in size and not as many. Different taste I guess..."
,,Nice place,3.0,,"There are many kinds of Orchid here. However, this place is so so for me but it might be interesting for ones who loves and do search of orchid."
,,"Great place, must visit!",5.0,,"Lovely and beautiful garden, that is certainly worth visiting when you are in Singapore.

It is huge and divided into multiple segments, and the orchids section is so wonderful. You also get the opportunity to develop an orchid after your name if you are willing to pay the price for it.

Ideal way to visit is by taking a separate trip to the Garden (and not as part of a standard tour) if you are a nature enthusiast. If you are a typical tourist type and not so enthused about nature and gardening, it is still worthwhile to visit this garden as part of a standard tour. Never miss it."
,,So many blooms,5.0,,"This was my second visit to the Gardens and the orchid garden has been exemplary both times.

Always great to see so much so close to the middle of town - easy to get to and a pleasant break from the hustle and bustle of Orchard Rd.

Well worth an hour or two of your time."

,,What a cool place...,5.0,,"I have never seen so many spectacular orchids in one place before. Wow. A vast variety of breath taking flowers, well arranged and displayed. They even have one named after prime minister Margaret Thatcher! Staff are very helpful but a bit reserved. An excellent visit - you won't find anything quite like it elsewhere."
,,Very warm but worth the effort,4.0,,"A really interesting place. The orchids named after famous people who had visited - including Mrs Thatcher - were particularly worth viewing. Unfortunately, it was very humid and I had to head back to the bus. A number of the group found the signposts confusing."
,,If you adore orchids its a must see!,5.0,,"Have a stroll through the botanical gardens to arrive at the Orchid gardens. Pay 5S$pp and enter orchid paradise! Beautiful outdoor park screen with countless types, sizes, colors!"

,,Well worth the visit,4.0,,"A must see whilst in Singapore. Great opportunity for photo shoot, it is well set out and has great ambience. Utilized Hop On Hop Off bus to get there, word of warning, don't rely on timely pickup, waited over 1.5 hours for bus that is scheduled every 30 - 40 mins. Spoilt what would have been great visit to such a beautiful location."
,,Orchids,4.0,,"Well worth a visit if you are into flowers, there are some fantastic colours and there is a part where certain orchids are named after some wold leaders"
,,Bloomin' Beautiful!,5.0,,We used the hop on hop off bus to go to the orchid garden and could have stayed there all day - allow at least a couple of hours and if you are an orchid lover or grower you'll need much longer. We took dozens of beautiful photographs and had a really lovely time there.
,,Early morning breakfast and then a stroll,5.0,,"We took a taxi to the Adam Rd Food Center for a Nasi Lemak breakfast and then strolled leisurely south through the Botanic Gardens, hitting the orchid garden mid-morning - a wonderful itinerary. The garden is well worth the 5 dollars admission fee."
,,The best part of the Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"We spent a total of 5 hours in the Botanic Gardens and at least 3 more specifically in the Orchid Garden . This is the gem of the Gardens and the area that it covers is surprisingly large . The layout is very well designed and the sinuous path reserves surprises after surprises .
There are sitting areas where people can cool down under the shadow and still continue to admire the scenery . A must in Singapore !"
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,Thoroughly enjoyed this visit beautiful and informative. It was lovely to see so many varieties of orchid in one place. The shop is a little on the tacky side.
,,Excellent Gardens,5.0,,"The National Orchid Gardens are one of the most beautiful gardens we have been in, with excellent displays and a wide variety of orchids. We spent two hours in this part of the Botanic Garden. The gardens are well set out and the range of orchids is amazing. It should be on top of the ""to do"" list when visiting Singapore"
,,Must See,5.0,,"The most beautiful gardens and the orchids are amazing. Take water, it's hot under the canopy of so many trees. Allow half a day at minimum."
,,Brilliant attraction,4.0,,"Inside the Singapore Botanic Garden, is another attraction called the National Orchid Garden. Entry to the Orchid Garden requires a small admission (entry to the Botanic Garden itself is obviously free) but it is worth the cost, and it is consistently rated on TripAdvisor as one of the top attractions in all of Singapore. I would agree with this, and not only if you like orchids!

I didn't spend too long here, maybe only half an hour, but it was a nice change of scenery from the dense green of the Botanic Gardens outside. The orchids themselves, along with all other foliage were amazingly and intricately kept by the dedicated team of gardeners.

There are not food and beverage outlets in the National Orchid Garden, and remember that there is surprisingly not too much shade here either, as there are no big trees. So maybe plan your trip for when the infamous Singapore sun is not at its strongest!"
,,Garden of beauty,4.0,,"We were amazed by beauty of the orchids in the Orchid Gardens in Singapore National Botanical Gardens. Everywhere you put your wondering eyes - the strikes of tender beauty were around. We took quite a few pictures too, and I am proudly sharing some here."
,,Beautiful displays!,5.0,,"The National Orchid Gardens are just beautiful, with gorgeous displays and a wide variety of orchids. I spent well over an hour in this part of the Botanic Garden and could have spent longer. The gardens are beautifully laid out and the range of orchids is amazing. Well worth a visit."
,,Beautiful flowers in a serene setting,4.0,,"My husband and I visited the National Orchid Garden as part of our visit to the Singapore Botanical Gardens. As we entered the Singapore Botanical Gardens the sign suggested it is a 10 minute walk to the National Orchid Garden. Keep in mind that this must be power walking as it took at least 15 - 20 minutes at average pace to reach the Orchid Garden.

The National Orchid Garden is an impressive display of orchids and other plants, including bromeliads, carnivorous plants and others. There is also a 'VIP Orchid Garden', allowing you to explore the hybrid species created for honourable guests to the National Orchid Garden. Some of these include the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Quentin Bryce.

The $5 admission charge is a small price to pay, particularly considering it gives you access to the 'Cool House' that gives you a lovely break from the heat and humidity!"
,,Wasn't expecting such beauty.,5.0,,"I don't know why I was so surprised at the beauty of this gorgeous garden. It was the last place we visited on our tour and it ended the day with a conviction that Singapore must be the cleanest place on earth. Admittingly, I don't know a lot about orchids, but I do know tranquil, beautiful and scenic - all of which this amazing garden offers."

,,An outstanding garden,5.0,,"There garden is not to be missed. The flowers and displays were beautiful. I think they say 60,000 orchids. The cleanliness and perfection of the beds was amazing. Since it was the new year, there were special displays for the year of the horse. The botanical garden is free, and the orchid garden is only a few dollars to enter, which is very reasonable.

,,"go there during rainy season, just after the rain",4.0,,"There is plenty of photos abt this place.

,,Very good but we were expecting more,4.0,,"This is hands down the best garden I've been to, but I wanted to see more than this since it's said to be the best Singaporean attraction (as of April 20, 2014). SGD$5 is not pricey at all for something like this, but we enjoyed the rest of Singapore Botanic Gardens as well."
,,Superb,5.0,,"Extensive, beautiful and only a small fee worth paying (the gardens are free to enter).

The cool house is a welcome retreat but the whole experience of seeing orchids growing in the wild is one not to be missed.

,,A Crown Jewel of Singapore,5.0,,"The Orchid garden is fabulous in its variety of orchids, the thought in their presentation, and the landscaping in general.

We asked them to order taxi for us and it was very good idea."

,,Always worth the price of admission,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden is the only part of the Botanic Garden with a fee, and it's only 5 SGD. The variety and colors of the orchids almost make you think it's not real but it is, pretty much regardless of season.

If you love plants, make sure you have a lot space on your camera's memory card, 'cause you'll be taking a lot of pictures."

Both the orchid gardens and Botanic gardens are worth a visit, there are many themed areas and they provide a nice introduction to forest endemic in SE Asia. The Botanic Gardens are free but there is a charge to enter the orchid gardens. These feature hundreds of different orchids, many the result of the gardens breeding program. The best time to visit the Botanic gardens is early morning before the heat becomes intense. There are a few restaurants in the middle of the gardens."
,,Never seen so many orchids,5.0,,"...and all of them are gorgeous. Vibrant colours, reds, yellows, whites and creams, deep, rich purples and light mauves - little, large, whether in bowers or in clumps, everywhere you look is a glorious display of colour.

,,Stunning!,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is actually located inside the Singapore Botanic Gardens, and costs a separate ticket price of S$5 (the main gardens are free).

They are simply beautiful & looking at them makes one forget about one's worries. The garden is spacious & yet not really too big for those who do not like to/cannot walk about too much. It is cool & one can smell the fragrance of plants /flowers everywhere. There are also seats /benches for tiring feet & senior folks to rest. One can be there for the whole day if the weather permits. Just remember to bring along some sandwiches, snacks & drinks. One mustn't miss the National Orchid Garden if he/she has the time. This place has the rejuvenating element in it."

,,Good for Nature Lovers,4.0,,"National Orchid Garden is located inside National Botanical Gardens, which itself is spread over a very vast area. For the nature lovers and fans of flowers, it is really a worth visiting site. Though I am not a very fan but I had accompanied my wife who is a teacher of environment and botany. Well, I also enjoyed the walk along the beautiful botanical gardens and specially the walk in the orchids garden. A fee of 5 SGD was worth it."
,,Pretty,5.0,,"Genuinely beautiful garden. The range of flowers was special, some natural, some cultivars. I would have liked more information about them."
,,If you like Orchids you will love this,5.0,,This is the biggest orchid garden I have seen. A short taxi ride from the centre of the city there are lots of Orchids including an area for rare orchids. Sinagapore's climate is ideal for orchids and they really thrive. Best Place to alight is the Burkhill gate on Tyersall road although we found it hard to get a taxi back. We may have walked in the wrong direction but we walked down to the main road Napier Road and struggled to get a cab for some time so when your cab driver lets you off ask best place to get a cab on the way back. Entry for Seniors is $1 and Adults $5
,,a must not only for plants' fans,5.0,,"well, I am a huge fan of flora and I'm myself cultivating orchids, so I just could not miss this place. and I was absolutely not disappointed.

,,Lost in vegetation,5.0,,"I am not a botanist but I love to stroll in gardens with my camera. The National Orchid Garden is a real “smorgåsbord” of flowers and you can easily forget yourself taking pictures among the gorgeous plantings. The admission was SGD 5.00, senior citizens (60 and over) SGD 1.00."
,,"Take water though, it gets hot",5.0,,The plantings are fantastic and the variety of flowers seen was incredible. There is a small entrance fee. We particularly enjoyed the CoolHouse and thought it was a great precurser to our visit to the Gardens by the Bay.

,,Too many orchids,5.0,,It is my first time to see too many species of orchids. The landscape is great The staffs are courteous and helpful.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"If you're in to plants, this is a must do, wonderful orchids at every turn. Lots of quiet walks and statues among the lush avenues. This is a lovely spot used by the locals at the weekends to lunch/jog/dog walk etc so it's quieter on a week day but it had a lovely feel about it on the Sunday when we visited as it was buzzing."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Not into flowers but really enjoyed the orchid garden, especially the opportunity to photograph so many different blooms."
,,Botanical gardens,4.0,,Very good but not as colourful as two years ago. Preferred the Gardens by the Bay. The display was work in progress I think.
,,The selection of orchids was both vast and extremely beautiful. The grounds are impecable & extremely well maintained.,5.0,,"I loved the beauty, the atmosphere, and helpful staff. I wish I could have afforded myself more time there. I was on a tour, pushing my father in a wheel chair, we only had approx. 45 minutes."
,,Nice place to see orchid,3.0,,"This place is maybe a great place to see many varieties of orchid, but it is actually very small place, I feel like this place is just a permanent flower show, most of orchid are not so special and can be found in market in mainland Southeast Asia."
,,very lovely orchid garden with many species,5.0,,"See that it was ranked near the top from the tripadvisor and that's why I paid a visit here. It need a SGD5 for the entrance which is reasonable price. The orchid garden actually a small part of the botanic garden.

After enter the garden you can see a variety of the orchid. I especially like the cool room (because it's pretty hot in singapore). there are so many types of the orchids and i really can't remember what i see. but took a lot of pretty pictures. I even spot a squirrel too!

could be a good try when you go to botanic garden"
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"I'm a big orchid fan, so it was wonderful to see orchids growing in the out-of-doors. Very colorful and we took great pictures. The highlight of our trip to the Botanic Gardens and an overall high point of our visit to Singapore."
,,Serves the purpose it proposes.,5.0,,Prepare to spend an entire day outdoors. After spending a few hours in the Botany Garden you reach this new refuge inside there and you will not regret it.
,,"Very nice, but can be skipped",4.0,,"The problem with the National Orchid Garden is that it's right in the middle of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, which are free and really great on their own. I doubt many people would visit the whole of the Botanic Gardens and be left wanting for more plants. But if you like orchids, it is a very nice display, not huge but not very expensive either."
,,A treat for the eyes,5.0,,"Overwhelmed by the beauty and variety of the orchids, and the trees. An oasis in a crowded city. We did not have enough time to see everything on our tour and would have preferred to stay longer."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Really beautiful garden, many types of beautiful orchids in any color that you can imagine. The price will be $5 for adult."
,,Make sure you have enough time!,5.0,,"Made a brief visit here on a city tour package. We wish we had more time to see everything, not just in the Orchid Garden but in the whole Botanical Garden. Next time we are in Singapore we will make sure we have more time. Probably not the best place for small children, as I would think they would soon be bored."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Located in the Botanical Gardens the Orchid Garden is beautifully designed & houses 1,000's of different orchids. A good tip is to go early in the morning when there are less people & the weather is cooler"
,,Spectacular,4.0,,I have never seen so many different kinds of orchids before. They are all so beautiful and have a story to tell. So many different types of colours and sizes. It is a definite must see. I almost chose not to see it but glad I changed mind. This is in amongst the Bot gardens. So much to take from coming here.
,,A really beautiful spot in the botanical gardens. Well worth a visit. Entry fee is S$5.00 but seniors get in for S$1.00,5.0,,"On a very hot day, the orchid garden was cool and shady. A wide variety of orchids of many different colours."

I was amazed at the huge variety of colours and shapes etc. A camera is a must here. It takes some time to walk around so be prepared to spend at least an hour if you are interested.
,,Beautiful Garden,5.0,,"Situated in the Botanical Gardens which is easily arrived at by tour buses, we used the SIA hopper which was excellent and was included in our package with Singapore Airlines."
,,Visit to the Orchid Garden,5.0,,"This was a beautiful display of so many different orchids. It was so good to see them growing in natural environments rather than in pots. There is a suggested route to follow through the Gardens, it doesn't matter! However, its easy to find yourself going around in circles - as we found out at one point! It is a must see on your visit if you are at all interested in gardens!"
,,Gift Shop - ROC,5.0,,"Firstly, the gardens are beautifully kept, and a tranquil environment away from the and hustle and bustle of the City. The Gift shop has some wonderful items and of very good quality. I was particularly impressed after a piece of jewellery I bought was found to have a fault and the gift shop people arranged for its replacement the next day via an exchange back at our hotel (leaving us to get on with our holiday and site seeing, and dissolving the stress of getting back to the location to replace the item) - now that's what I call customer service and I shall certainly return to this shop on my next trip to Singapore ( take note UK companies!)"
,,A well done garden of its type,4.0,,"This is a specialized garden and well known among subject matter experts around the world. Even if you're not into botany, take a walking tour of the place. That said, more visitor education on the subject would be helpful and the celebrity plot needs some maintenance."
,,Interesting visit but weather was hot/humid,4.0,,A must see if you have time. Enjoyed the visit especially in the Cool Room :) Suggest getting to the park early in the morning to avoid the hot and humid midday sun in Singapore.
,,Remarkable,5.0,,A visit to the Orchid Gardens was part of the bus tour of the city. It is a truly remarkable place with blooms of all colours of the rainbow throughout the whole area. We loved it and could well have stayed there longer.
,,Gorgeous,4.0,,"We had a fabulous (and cheap) morning at the gardens. Definitely worth a visit. Make sure you go early in the morning, the kids were happy for the walk - but by lunchtime it was too hot to keep walking."
,,Lovely collection of interesting Orchids,4.0,,"Even as the dragged around 'usband I enjoyed about an hour wandering through the collected flowers. Avoid the middle of the day for the heat and weekends if you can for the volume of people - but it wasn't too bad on a Sunday afternoon.

Look out for concerts in the Botanical Gardens."
,,Beautiful garden,3.0,,"An amazing selection of orchids, set simply, in beautiful grounds. So many that unless you are a real expert, you can get orchid fatigue."

,,More Orchids than you can imagine,5.0,,"Perfect collection in one of the world's finest gardens... the temperate house is fascinating, as are a number of the other small collections... The VIP collection is a roll call of the great, the good and the consummately evil, but fun... tranquil and beautiful"
,,Great,4.0,,"It's a great place to hang out. If you like flowers, admire and know everything about them, this is the place for you. But if you just like flowers, and know nothing about them (like me), it's a great place for photos.
It was a nice experience!"
,,Good variety of orchids,4.0,,Singapore had not had rain for a month therefore it was very dry especially walking through the Botanic Gardens to get to the National Orchid Garden.

,,Orchid heaven,5.0,,"If you enjoy orchids, this is a must see. The park is located inside the Botanical Gardens and have a small fee to enter, but it is worth the price. The variety of orchids is impressive and the size of some of the plants was amazing."
,,Overwhelming Orchid Overload,5.0,,"I can't name a single orchid species or plant that I saw inside the National Orchid Garden but one does not need to know how rare or expensive the orchid you're looking at for you to appreciate how precious and exquisite they are. You'll have to pay SGD 8.00 for admission to the garden but it's worth it. The celebrity garden has orchids named after famous personalities. I didn't know when I visited that they had an orchid named after Prince William or I would have searched for it. It reassuring to know that there is a place such as this where precious and rare plant species are looked after and preserved.,"
,,very good experience,4.0,,best place for nature lovers especially flowers. Best to take MRT or Bus. Have at least one day for this place. Eatables available inside. Many antics shops can be also found inside.

,,A Beautiful relaxing walk,5.0,,"I know nothing about flowers, or orchids specifically, but this is a beautiful garden in the midst of a large botanical garden.

Orchids are one of my favourite flowers and needless to say, I enjoyed my visit here very much! The flowers were beautiful and there are tons of different orchids species that you will see! The park is huge, so be prepared to walk a lot. This place is definitely worth the visit if you're into nature and a fan of orchids!"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Beautifully presented and such a wonderful display. A quiet and shady oasis. If you like gardens, allow more time than you expect to stroll and sit and enjoy this exotic place."

,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"Hundreds of beautiful orchids, perfectly presented in a haven of peace away from the bustle of the city."

,,a rip off,1.0,,just a store front to buy Orchids. Orchids grow like weeds in Singapore . Best just to look at the ones in your friends garden
,,Rascist in the restaurant,3.0,,The gardens were good but the restaurant is openly rascist and serverd all singaporeans before foreigners - I waited 45 minutes for the food I ordered but the Singaporeans were served immediately they entered - I would not go there again
,,Beware of mosquitoes,3.0,,"Not recommend for non flower and non photography lovers. This place is too similar with Gardens by the Bay and restaurant Halia is under-revamp or gone, a little bit disappointed."

,,Too many errr...Orchids,3.0,,It`s great...if you like Orchids. Otherwise its just a million different (but all essentially exactly the same) flower. I know its the whole point and they were cool but I got bored
,,Lots of orchids (a bit pricey),4.0,,"If you love orchids, you must go there. Lots of orchids are presented in a beautiful way. I have only 2 drawbacks: the entrance fee is a bit pricey and it lacks more information on the flowers themselves."
,,exotic place,4.0,,"we had only 30 to 25 min to spend there , so i begin by recommending more time for it. it was great place to visit i really love it and get to know many new spices of plants, that i wish i could take home some. it large garden be careful that you might get lost ( coz i did) toke some time to find the exit. it nice to spend time there where u can just kick it and relax in the nature. the arrangement of plants was beautiful to be real , well my entire trip to Singapore seem like dream. visit it if u like nature , u will not regret it."
,,Like orchids - don't miss,5.0,,This is in the Botanical gardens. The main gardens are free to enter; the orchids area costs $5 per person (or $1 if 60+). It is a delight to visit and see how many different types there are all well laid out with photo points also.
,,Gorgeous flowers,4.0,,"Gosh there are some lovely flowers here. Even those not normally disposed towards horticultural attractions will find it hard to stay aloof from the explosion of colour.

Basically the National Orchid Garden is a separate entity within the famous Singapore Botanic Gardens. There is an entry fee but it is well worth it as the displays are so lush, so unsullied. There are great swathes of greenery here and also an interesting display which tells of the process of creating orchids and their development. It is all quite comprehensible to the non-green thumb in the family as well.

While some may find the Singapore heat an issue and there are a few mild gradients to overcome most visitors should be able to get the most out of this garden."
,,Great place for flower lovers.,5.0,,"My wife loves orchids, so when I told her about my plans, she was thrilled. The cost is extremely reasonable - only 5 Sing dollars per person. The orchid garden is extensive, vibrantly coloured, beautifully designed and varied. Even for non-flower lovers like myself, it was an interesting and fun experience. We spent about an hour, just in the orchid garden and could have spent the whole day in the rest of the botanical garden. My only complaint is that it is sort of far from the Botanical Garden MRT station. Other than than small issue, a recommended visit."
,,What the Vatican is to Rome...,4.0,,"... the National Orchid Garden is to Botanic Gardens. The National Orchid Garden is an enclosed area within the botanic gardens, and they do charge a nominal entrance fee. But it is easily worth it. The beauty and variety of arrangements are worth seeing (and ideal for photography). A walk through the entire garden takes about an hour, a little bit more or less depending on how closely you read all the information about each type of orchid. After a visit to the gardens, depending on your level of interest, there is a nice gift shop (although many of the same items can be found at other souvenir stores through Singapore).

If you are planning a visit to the botanic gardens, then make time for the National Orchid Garden, effectively the crown jewel of the gardens."
,,A Most Wonderful Experience,5.0,,"I was more than happy to pay the SG$5 entrance fee to the NOG. This is a wonderful Garden, which immediately makes you feel totally relaxed and almost intone with Mother Nature.

Having visited the equivalent in Kuala Lumpur, I was not expecting much, but how wrong I was. You could easily spend an hour + just meandering around these Gardens, taking wonderful images and taking in all that these gardens have to offer.

I suspect that I will be back as I always feel 1 visit to a wonderful place like this is never enough to truly appreciate all it has to offer."
,,A lovely way to spend a few hours,4.0,,We spent a about 1hr here we were on a city tour it was so peaceful and was nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore
,,Heaven!,5.0,,"We actually spent 2 hours in the Orchid Garden and could have spent many more. It is heaven on earth for flower lovers, but to be honest I don't believe there will be anyone who would not like to be in this place. The shear size of the garden, the number of flowers and colors is simply amazing. Yes, the heat and humidity is troublesome but eventually you forget about it. Don't miss this place!"
,,Who knew orchids were so interesting!,5.0,,I went here because my friend I was traveling with is really into Botanic Gardens. I was really surprised at how great this was. Not only are the flowers incredible (and they breed new varieties there) but the layout is great and it's very peaceful to walk through.
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,This part of the Singapore Botanical Gardens is well worth the additional charge. There are so many varieties of orchids here to look at your head will just swim! The VIP Garden is an interesting mix of orchids bred for visiting VIPs. Just amazing!
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"This is one of the best botanical gardens I have ever seen. The orchids are just amazing. If you love plants, this is a must see. If you are a senior, only $1.00, what a bargain."
,,Must See,5.0,,"National Orchid Garden inside the Singapore Botanical Gardens, only a small fee to enter. Absolutely beautiful. A couple of hours is fine, all day if you want to leisurely look at everything. Great photo opportunities."
,,Must see for any plant lover,5.0,,"The national orchid garden is located inside the Singapore botanical gardens. You pay a small fee ($5sgd) entrance. We spent about 3 hours in here looking at all the flowers, but most people would only spend about 1 hour. Lots of photo opportunities."

,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Immaculate and beautiful area of the botanic gardens and well worth paying the small charge to get in. Lots of varieties and displays of orchids to see.

It is a must for you only if you are an ardent nature lover!!"

There is a modest admission fee for the Orchid Garden, but the Botanic Gardens are free to all visitors. There is a metro station at the entrance--stop is called ""Botanic Gardens."" The Orchid display is about a mile from the entrance, but there are paved paths for wheelchair access and motor transport available. European and North American visitors will find an abundance of unfamiliar flowers and trees, in addition to the orchids."
,,Surrounded by Beauty,5.0,,"This could easily be an all day visit if you wanted. The flowers, especially the orchids, were beautiful. I took well over 100 photos and could have taken lots more. There is also a very nice gift shop and and rest area in the middle of the park. I highly recommend this attraction."
,,Wonderful for flower lovers,5.0,,"We went to the National Orchid Garden by train - the train station is outside so it's very easy to get there. Be warned that there is a lot of walking involved in visiting the National Botanic Garden, and the Orchid Garden is towards the centre - on a very hot day it could be hard work. Maybe going there as part of a coach tour would be better for people who struggle with walking in the heat, as tour coaches probably stop nearer to the Orchid Garden than the train.

The orchids are spectacular, so many different colours and I didn't know where to look first. It's a dream for photographers and flower-lovers, but I'm not sure that children would put it top of their list. For me, a wonderful day out."
,,Absolute must if you love nature,5.0,,Amazing assortment of orchids presented in the most beautifully designed garden. Wander the paths at your leisure. Be sure and bring your camera. One of the highlights of Singapore.

We managed to walk around most of the gardens and through the rainforest and then into the Orchid garden which was amazing, I am not really a flower person but even I appreciated it, there are even some great spots to sit and relax as well."
,,Absolutely beautiful orchids - amazing experience,5.0,,"Highlight of my short trip to Singapore. When visiting the botanical gardens, don't shy away from the few dollars entrance fee to visit the orchid gardens - worth every cent! Beautiful and stunning blooms - enjoy and take loads of photos!"
,,A must!,5.0,,One of the highlights of my visit to Singapore! But don't just go to the Botanic gardens for the Orchid Garden (even though it really is the highlight) the whole garden is superb.
,,We were forced to visit but then we felt Lucky to be there,5.0,,"We had got free city tour with hotel booking. Guide forced us to buy entrance ticket from this place. We said no but she forced again and again. So we bought the tickets.

On every step you get something new from taking pictures. On every step you get to see fresh and new spices of flowers. On every step you get excited about next attraction. On every step you fall in love with the space. On every step you stated feeling romantic. LOVE gets wings and you start getting emotional with the space."

,,Amazing display of stunning orchids!,5.0,,"For only $5, this is one the most amazing and cheapest attractions in Singapore. I thought I was in love with the Botanic Gardens, and then I got to this place. Wow! Wow! Wow! If you love orchids, color, or photography, this place is amazing.
I went with my two boys and even they were interested enough to keep going. And, just when they started to fizzle, there were carnivorous plants in the Cool Building (like a Greenhouse but was actually cooler.) They thought those were pretty fun."
,,Georgeous,5.0,,"In the middle of the botanical gardens you will find this separate enclave dedicated to the Orchid.

Even if you're not a green thumb, I feel pretty safe in saying you will be deeply impressed with this garden."

What I especially objected to was the notion of a set menu, where many/most items had a surplus...

Staff very courteous and trying hard.

It was probably too early in the year though as lots of displays were only just being planted out and there were photos of previous displays that clearly showed the garden in fuller bloom. Good though & a very pleasant stroll.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Lovely walk filled with so many different varieties of Orchid. Ate in the Halia restaurant, which was pricy but the food was excellent."
,,superb display,4.0,,"wonderful variety of plants, well displayed and described. Excellent layout for those with disabilities, well signposted"
,,Breathtakingly beautiful,5.0,,"I loved the orchids! There are so many and they are so colorful. The cool house was interesting with its pitcher plants and carnivorous plants. We went in the morning so it wasn't so uncomfortably hot and humid. There is a lot of walking, and the heat/humidity can be very unpleasant."
,,Is this Paradise??,5.0,,"This place is simply breathtaking! The Singaporeans really know how to do everything so well.
I was blown away by the beauty of the display of the most beautiful orchids I have ever seen.
I know the climate is perfect for growing these exotic plants but the way they are displayed is just beautiful. I was so inspired, I came home to AU and tried to start my own orchid garden...with disappointing results I might add. I love everything about Singapore but this place was a real highlight for me."
,,Beautiful orchids everywhere,5.0,,Awesome to be in a garden full of orchids of different colors and variety . Nice backdrop for picture taking . There are also good restaurants around the garden
,,Beautiful,4.0,,A truely beautiful place for only 5 dollars. A goid 15 minutr walk from the mrt station but that's worth it.
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,A must place to visit if you are in Singapore. Stunning displays both outside and in greenhouses. Immaculately presented and excellent value for money. Could not fault the experience.

The cost of entry in the Orchid Garden which is part of the Botanic Gardens was a massive S$2 each!!"
,,I could die here,5.0,,"Even if you're not a plant fanatic, this place is spectacular. I could go back 10 times. The gardens are very big, very well kept with beautiful walkways - there are also a few restaurants and shops inside. Whatever you do, don't miss the Orchard garden. This part is not free. It is the most amazing garden I've ever visited. I usually take some photos, but took more than 150 here. It is like breathing Prozac. The attention to detail and combination of plants are simply breathtaking"
,,Something not to be missed while visiting Singapore,5.0,,"You got to love this beautiful garden which is within the bigger botanic gardens. the orchards are magnificent, the whole area is spectacular!"
,,Orchids at their best,4.0,,"Set within the large botanic gardens, these gardens are separate & specifically dedicated to all things orchid. The visit was well worth the S$5 entrance fee. The map shows you where to walk and includes areas dedicated to the propagation of the flowers and a cloud mist greenhouse to show plants grown at high levels. A bit of fun was the Celebrity area where plants have been named and grown after famous people. If you go by taxi make sure you exit through the main Botanical garden gates. Very few taxis pass by the exit closest to the Orchid gardens - we had quite a wait."
,,Wonderful visit,5.0,,Absolutely wonderful display - so much to see including a lovely cool area as a respite from the outdoor heat
,,The best deal in town!,5.0,,"As a senior, I only paid S$1 to enter the Orchid Garden, undoubtedly the best deal in town.

After getting off the MRT, a friend and I walked through the beautifully maintained Singapore Botanic Gardens, itself a treat, before coming to the Orchid Garden. Many orchids were in bloom and the walk was shady and relaxing. The VIP garden, which consists of hybrids especially developed for dignitaries who have visited the garden, was well planned. We then came to the Mist House. Just as we were beginning to feel the humidity, we entered the air conditioned Cool House, which contains orchids which grow at higher altitudes.

Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, a visit to the Orchid Garden is a good way to spend a morning. Singapore can be proud of its creation."
,,Wish I had more time to enjoy,5.0,,This is a must do for anyone who loves Orchids. The colours and types are magnificent and the undulating walks leave a surprise around every corner.

,,Beautiful as ever.,5.0,,What a lovely location in the heart of such a bustling thriving city. So much can be learned from Singapore.

The Cool House was a nice stop, as it was cooler inside. It costs about S$5.00 to get in...less if you are a Sr. Citizen. The map shows where a lot of the sections are. If you do not want to walk from the SMRT station, catch a cab to the Visitor Center. The National Orchid Garden is located in the National Botanical Garden. Very enjoyable...you easily spend 1-3 hours there."
,,A lovely place to spend my S$5,4.0,,"I think it's pleasant and interesting enough for about two hour visit. Many species of orchid to see and take pictures, colorful and well-cared.

,,Great varities of Orchids,5.0,,"We went to this place as a part of the standard package. While initially we fell in love with the place, but humidity took a toll on us.

The orchids were really beautiful though they all did not seem in full swing. My kids liked the close up view of the Pitcher plant which otherwise they only read in their books"
,,Worth its money and time,4.0,,Definitely worth a trip even if you are not a big botany fan like us. When we visited not that many flowers were blossoming but still quite a few. And since admission is only 5 SGD you should drop by if you have the time.
,,A brief but beautiful visit,4.0,,"An oasis, even in the garden city. the gardens are beautiful and peaceful. Even when crowded there are ample paths to find some less populated areas. If you like orchids, you won't really go wrong here!

The cold room is also well worth a visit to see what plant species thrive in a cooler mountainous type of environment and there are plenty of suggested photo stops for the prefect picture.

A lovely way to spend an afternoon."

,,"""Worth a few hours for a unique world class experience""",4.0,,"I hail from a ""garden isle"", but even this Orchid garden topped anything I've seen internationally. Its worth an hour to stroll through this mini-garden within the larger Botanical garden. Even the non-orchid enthusiast will appreciate the size and sheer volume of blossoms. The remainder of the Botanical garden is a good place to explore for a couple hours. Sunset and evening lights and dinner on the garden property is a nice quiet and safe way for a business travelller to spend an evening. The bus is regular and very easy to catch into and out of downtown Singpore."

We are not really overly interested in flowers however these were something to behold. An amazing array of orchids were present and the perfectly designed and maintained gardens were beautiful.

,,Fantastic Selection of Orchids,5.0,,"We went to the orchid gardens as part of our visit to the Singapore Botanical Gardens.

There is a small $5 charge per person but definitely well worth the charge.

There seems to be thousands of different varieties of orchids on display with a multitude of colours. The Mist House is a must as there are some amazing large orchids on display. The Cool House itself brings it own varieties of orchids and other carnivorous plants.

Our random group formed as we waited for the tour to begin, and there was a sincere and gracious apology that the English-speaking guide had fallen ill, nevertheless we would still be shown around the garden. The friendly guide who took us did a fine job with the English at her command, and we had a very enjoyable tour, just over an hour. The orchid garden is superb, not only for the sensational orchids, but also for the many, many other tropical and sub-tropical plants that surround them. It was especially interesting for the North American and northern European members of our group. Afterwards it was lovely to stroll back through the main garden to the facilities (restaurant, shops) and the transport points."

The number of species of orchids on display is enormous and the landscaping to showcase them is amazing - incredibly well planned and maintained.

If you go to,Singapore you must visit this garden."
,,Wow! Wow! and Wow!,5.0,,"Living in Thailand, I am used to seeing impressive displays of orchids but the National Orchid Garden within the Botanic Gardens in Singapore is something else. Believe me it is absolutely breathtaking. Although admission to the Botanic gardens is free, there is a small charge to enter the Orchid garden - SGD 5 or SGD 1 if over 60 years. Take your time and make sure any camera battery is fully charged!
The variety of orchids is truly amazing and each one is clearly labeled so a pen and notebook could come in useful. Everywhere you look there are orchids all within beautiful habitats and just when you think there can't be anymore, you walk round a corner and there are more displays.
Don't rush....take your time and be prepared to be overwhelmed by the sheer profusion and beauty of these magnificent plants. Within the garden you will find a VIP orchid garden, a heritage orchid display, a celebrity orchid garden, a mist house and a bromeliad collection
There is a small gift shop near the exit which is worth looking in. Opening hours are 8-30am to 7pm.
Of all the wonderful attractions in Singapore, if I had to choose one, it would be the National Orchid garden."

,,Cannot Wait to go back!,5.0,,"We were on a Tour East tour that had a stop here. It was not long enough. I had been before on my own and still want and need more time to explore on my next, third visit. Lots of flowers - you do not need to be an expert to understand the beauty. The Singaporean climate makes everything so lush and green. I love the unique orchids named after famous persons located at the top of the hill. But my favourite part was the Cool House, if only because it cooled me down as I am not used to the heat/humidity. There was so much to see and lots of areas for great photos. The walkways are large enough so you are not tripping over people. There are also lots of little fountains/sundials/etc. so it is not just flowers. There are lots of employees keeping the area maintained. There is a souvenir store at the end with reasonable prices."

,,"Unique, special, beautiful",5.0,,"The Orchid Garden is one of my favourite places, not only for its lovely layout and the subtle appeal of the floral displays, but also in that it highlights a flower art that is pretty unique to Singapore and Southeast Asia. I particularly like the section where hybrids are displayed that were specially created for visiting heads of state, some of these flowers are simply gorgeous. It can get pretty hot outdoors, so the best time to visit is first thing in the morning when it opens. There is a great cafe in the Botanic Gardens where you can also have a pleasant breakfast."
,,An oasis of pure orchid bliss,5.0,,"Easy to get to via the MRT (Botanic Garden station on the Circle Line). The garden is just outside the station.

The Orchid Garden is beautifully landscaped and some of the varieties of orchid are really quite stunning. I seem to come here every time I am in Singapore. Really worth the trip and now there is an MRT stop at the Botanical Gardens (albeit on the other side of the park from the O.G.)."

,,"Amazing flowers, history.",5.0,,"Even as someone who is an orchid layperson, I enjoyed the garden. It was neat to read about the history and science behind orchid breeding. Celebrity garden is very neat. This is a must see at the botanical gardens. Kids may feel a bit bored and restrained, as the flowers are, of course, off limits. The only thing I find so difficult about the gardens is the heat and humidity, which cannot be helped."
,,Beautiful orchids,5.0,,"This place is orchid paradise. There are various kinds of orchids, which are all charming and colorful. I can not take my eye off the flowers. Bring the camera along with you and capture all the beauty of orchids. The price is only 5$ but it is worth more than that. Really love it!
High recommended for those love flowers."
,,Stunning!!!,5.0,,Was looking for time to kill so we decided to go to the orchid garden. The only downside to going to the orchid gardens is the long walk through the botanic gardens first. Although the gardens were nice it was quite warm and as we took a taxi you can not get dropped any closer to the orchid gardens. The orchid were beautiful but started to look the same after a bit so we didn't go all the way around. We especially loved the orchids named after famous people.
,,a must see,4.0,,"a nice way to kill time if you have extra time to spare. There is a fee to enter the orchid garden, there is also a store at the exit.
Self guided tour at your own pace although a fair warning that it can be very hot and humid. Bring lots of water to cool you down.
The blooms are fantastic!"
,,Blooming Orchids,5.0,,The orchids that are on exihibit are hybrids and normally named after a dignatory who visited Singapore. There are so many different types of orchids with vibrant bright colors. So lovely just to walk through.
,,Best in the world for viewing orchids,5.0,,"If you like orchids, best in the world. Attached to the Botanical Garden which we enjoy about once a month when they have free concerts."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,I love orchids so this is close to paradise for me! The National Orchid Garden is part of the Botanic Gardens and is well worth a visit to see the amazing variety of orchids there are. The garden is beautifully laid out. I'd go earlier in the morning or later in the evening when it is not too warm and avoid weekends when there are a lot of visitors.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Very nice stroll along paths lined with thousands of orchids, probably more species than anywhere else in the world. Make sure to visit the VIP orchids section where they have orchids dedicated to famous people such as Margaret Tatcher and Diana."
,,Most beautiful orchids I've ever seen,5.0,,"Absolutely stunning display of every imaginable orchid. Beautifully tended and manicured gardens. The array of different Orchids are outstanding and the grounds are immaculate.
You can find there so many different species of orchids that I didn't even imagine.
The entrance price is $5, which I think is fair. There are also plenty of places to shelter from the torrential downpours, which is useful for when you forget your umbrella.
Affordable entry, plenty of places to pose for a photo. A must see for any orchid fan."
,,A MUST,5.0,,So easy to tour. The orchids are incredible. So many different kinds and the paths twist and turn with gorgeous foliage. Don't miss this. I have been here several times and never tire of seeing this and I'm not even a garden or plant person!!
,,Most Beautiful Botanical Garden,5.0,,"The Botanical Garden along with the National Orchid Garden was the most enjoyable part of our Singapore trip. It is an extremely peaceful reprise from the sometimes chaotic Orchard Road area. This is not a place to be missed while visiting Singapore. If you are staying at any of the hotels along the Orchard Road corridor, it is an easy walk to the gardens.

BTW, there is no fee for the Botanical Garden but there is a small fee for the National Orchid Garden. If you are a senior citizen, it is only $1S to get in."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,Worth the S$5. We enjoyed reading about the orchids named for important dignatories and the display. Can not believe the number of orchids and the variations. Shame we brought the camera but were missing the memory card and left the phones at home. Would make the effort to return just to get some pictures.
,,Bee happy! Be like the bees!!,5.0,,"It was a wonderful experience surrounded by a vast ocean of orchids of different variety. definitely worth paying for! An orchid named after Nelson Mandela, you can find it there, and many more."

,,lovely,4.0,,"This not free attraction is located within the botanical garden. There are many orchid displays, most of which are of a few species. if you are going to the botanical garden, then by all means see the orchid garden as well. Otherwise, probably not worth the time."
,,Beautiful garden I've ever visit!,4.0,,"This is a place you can not miss if you visit Singapore. The National Orchid Garden is within the compounds of the Botanic Garden. The most interesting feature of this garden is the design of its orchid display. The orchids are organised and displayed based on a colour scheme that reflects the seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter. The spring display is represented by yellow, cream and golden orchid flowers, the summer display by pink and red orchids, the autumn display by rich reds and purples, and the winter display by represented by white flowers. This design made the garden have an art and fresh atmosphere. It costs just $5 for such amazing experience. I love this garden very much. I'm sure I will be back if I have a chance to visit Singapore again."
,,Best of the world,4.0,,"My friend Danny introduced me to come here and I've never regret about this.
It is the best display of Orchids in the world. Really beautiful and amazing variety of orchids, set in a large spacious park with paths meandering through different 'rooms' of various botanical themes.The garden is really well looked after & definitely worth paying $5 for an entry. Nice to get away from a busy Orchard Road, and sink into a nature.
Take your camera as every corner you turn is a photographic moment. Excellent value for money as it only cost $5 entry and is located at Botanical Gardens which makes it a wonderful day out.
Recommend this to anyone who loves flowers."
,,beautiful garden,4.0,,"beautiful garden, about 15 minute walk from the MRT entrance to garden. cost $5 the rest of the botanic garden is free and also beautiful to admire"
,,Pleasant walk through the orchid gardens,4.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is in the large Botanical Gardens, we spent half a day walking around the whole gardens. Affordable entry, plenty of places to pose for a photo. They do have large groups coming through at times so it can get busy. Stroller-friendly, well maintained paths. The usual souvenir shop, and there are drinking water fountains. Nice visit as part of the Botanical Gardens."
,,beautiful walk in the garden and park,4.0,,Would recommend it for an mid day walk in the parc and orchid garden. You can arrive by metro and if you are too tired leave by taxi.
,,Good birding too!,5.0,,Wandering around the National Orchid Garden and the Botanical Garden in general is a great respite from the heat and concrete of the city. We were impressed by the quality and maintenance of the park and did some nice birding too.
,,Simply gorgeous. Don't miss it!,5.0,,"I can spend hours watching and taking photos of these gorgeous orchids. There are so many of them, and all are simply gorgeous.

The Singapore Botanic Gardens which houses this National Orchid Garden is a short taxi ride from anywhere in Singapore, so if you can spare even 1 hour, you should visit the Orchid Garden."
,,Heaven of orchid,5.0,,"National Orchid Garden is a destination not to be missed here. They have thousands of species of orchids and orchid natural hybridization. Moreover, each year many hybrids have vibrant colors and durability are constantly added to the impressive collection. We can learn and admire the richness, diversity and beauty of orchids. Step inside, I feel lost in a different world."
,,Relaxing and magic,5.0,,Its a pretty nice place to take a walk and dream a bit about huge plants and trees. About one hour to do it should be enough
,,Lots of orchids in bloom,4.0,,"Well worth the entrance fee. Very well kept gardens, lots of different orchids. Luckily many in bloom."
,,Exquisite flowers in a beautiful setting,5.0,,"The whole Botanical Garden is such a lovely place, and the National Orchid Garden is gorgeous. The colours and form of the orchids are stunning, and the Centre's design is really effective. It's accessible for people with mobility problems, and well worth the small charge made."
,,Beautiful orchids!,5.0,,Wow is this place ever amazing. The orchid display is amazing with tons of different hybrids/species! This is a must see for anyone interested in plants!
,,Lovely way to spend a morning or afternoon,5.0,,"I have been to Singapore several times, but had not yet made it here until my most recent visit. I visited on a cloudy Sunday morning, hoping the rain would hold off, and was very happy that it did! The botanic gardens themselves are much bigger than I expected - you can easily spend 2 -3 hours looking around.

Although I am no botanist, the plants are interspersed with a variety of sculpture and other interesting things along the way - you find something new around every corner!

The highlight was definitely the orchid garden - so many beautiful flowers, and the peace and tranquility of the place really was special. It really is worth the $5 fee to get in."
,,Delightful part of Singapore,5.0,,"For me, the Botanical Garden is one of the pleasantest parts of Singapore and its highlight, despite the modest admission charge, is the splendid orchid garden. It's so wonderfully colourful, even on the most overcast day."
,,A Nice Place to Visit,4.0,,"Pros: -variety of orchids/flowers all over -family friendly -proper signs were placed (bathrooms, exit, other groups of floras) Cons: -None *A must see in Singapore! It's worth a visit!"
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,"We had a great afternoon i Botanic Garden, and Orchid Garden was fantastic! Even our kids (3 and 5) had a good time here"
,,Great afternoon,5.0,,Fantastic gardens. Free entrance but small fee for entrance to orchid garden which is a must. The orchids are amazing.
,,Lovely place to visit in Singapore for a couple of hours,5.0,,"The orchids were beautiful and as Senior Citizens it only cost us $1 Singapore dollar each for entry. There are orchids in a huge variety of colours and the gardens are well set out for easy strolling. I suggest that you take an umbrella to protect you from the sun and with the tropical weather it could rain anyway.
We walked back down through the Singapore Botanical Gardens which is connected to the Orchid Garden which was also delightful."
,,A beautiful area in the beautiful botanical gardens,5.0,,We were already mesmerised by the botanical gardens which have a magical feel about them so when we came in the Orchid Garden we weren't expecting it to be much better but it was!! The flowers were amazing both in colour and shape. Beautifully presented with lots of photo spots kindly laid on for you. Highly recommended and with a very low ticket price an absolute bargain!
,,It's a paradise to get a morning walk,5.0,,I do live in Singapore and often I have been asked if the National Orchid Gardeen was just a touristic attraction. Even if sometimes it can get packed with tourists groups if you love nature and its wonders it's a place not to be missed. Everytime I feel sad I come here early mornings to get some positive energy. I love also to think that with that cheap ticket I'm contributing to the research and protection of rare species. The colors are so beautiful and this special plant flowers look often as butterflies in the moment of taking off. Afterwards I also feel as taking off: it's my secret paradise.
,,amazing garden!,5.0,,"You need few hours to visit this amazing garden! There are so many and varieties of orchids and so nice landscapes! It costs just SG$5 to enter and it is a must see place in Singapore! If it's raining, no problem, still nice!"
,,many types of orchid,4.0,,"The cheepest entrance in singapore, 5 for adult and free for children. Very beautiful places and can see so many beautiful orchids... we took photo for every types of orchids....but we need to walk back to botanic garden again for mrt..... tired walking back.."

,,Beautiful,5.0,,This National Orchid garden located really near center. I take my kids there and of course my daughter love it. Nice place for relax and walk around. Design of the garden are gorgeous.
,,Enchanted wonderland,5.0,,I visited the Orchid Garden with my digital SLR and had an amazing few hours. There are so many colours and varieties of orchids to be amazed by. It costs SGD$5 to enter and is well worth it if you are remotely interested in plants and flowers.
,,Beautiful garden,4.0,,Good place for the garden and especially orchid lover. Avoid visiting on a sunny afternoon if you don't want to get dehydrated
,,Lovely,4.0,,"The gardens are a must see when you are at the Botanical Gardens. S$5 entry fee is nothing when you see the amount of work they do to maintain and research the orchids. Love the celebrity garden, Princess Diana's orchids is beautiful"
,,"beautiful, beautiful, beautiful",5.0,,"A beautiful garden. A multitude of tropical and equatorial plants. Impressive way of arranging them. As for orchids, the multitude and variety is impressive."
,,Photo opportunities,5.0,,"We visited the Gardens & had time to walk quietly thru this beautiful area - only a small cost as we qualified as seniors :-) There was a storm brewing with plenty of thunder but we only had a few drops of rain. What beauty surrounded us & I did enjoy seeing the orchids named for famous people & wondering about some of the choices!
There was an interesting gift shop with some very beautiful articles & I was sorry not to have space in our luggage to buy some gifts for grandchildren :-)"
,,Great morning out!,5.0,,"As a family, we caught the train to the Singapore Botanical Gardens.
Be mindful, that the Orchid Garden is somewhat in the middle of the gardens.
Fair but nice walk from the train station to the National Orchid Garden, so arrive early (9:00am) to beat the midday heat.

There is a small entrance fee.
Can get busy with group tours, again, best to arrive early.
Orchids were beautiful! Be sure to take your camera.
Orchids are well maintained & includes many colourful varieties.

There are a few small eateries outside the National Orchid Garden, but we opted to eat at the bustling ""Food For Thought"" cafe as this was somewhat air conditioned.
""Food for Thought"" is located at the main entrance of the Singapore Botanic Gardens.

Worth a morning visit. My Mama & Aunt loved the orchids!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I wasn't too excited to enter initially but it was really very peaceful and beautiful. Well worth the cost, I'd say."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"What an absolutely amazing collection of orchids. Beautifully presented, this was a joy to walk through with gorgeous orchids at every turn."
,,Meeting in the garden,4.0,,"We had a surprise encounter when we visited the Orchid gardens with a large lizard that just walked out from under a shrub strolled across our path posed long enough for us to snap it's progress then wondered off. This was after walking through the main section where there are just so many orchids most of which are labeled with their name and some information some are not labeled. You do not need to be a gardener to appreciate the setting which is a calm a peaceful retreat from the busy hustle and bustle of the Island.
There gift shop was very well stocked although a little on the expensive side now ever staff are keen to help and of course all speak perfect English along with a number of other languages, we never saw/heard any one have a problem in being understood. An early morning or later in the day may be a cooler time to visit as there is no opportunity for air conditioning outside although of course the gift shop and restaurant are, we went in the morning and enjoyed sitting outside with an ice cream before continuing our exploration in the gardens. The water fall is an idea setting for photographs but there are lots of sign posted 'photo spots'.
Children may not find it so interesting but there is a large open green area on the edge of the gardens which would be ideal for children to run around or for family picnics."
,,Lovely!,5.0,,This is the place where i can see and smell the blooming orchid! I love this place..there were some orchids named after famous people. The entrance fee was SGD 5 and this place is worth to visit.
,,fantastic,5.0,,what was there not to like its set out superbly the flowers are brilliant and its kept clean and tidy
,,"""Beautiful Orchids""",5.0,,"If you are a lover of Orchids, you will love the Gardens. Such variety of colours and types. We found it best to start at the bottom and weave your way up the hill. Plenty of photo opportunities . I especially liked the pergola with the mirrors that reflect the orchid and the person you are photographing. After viewing the Orchids, I would highly recommend that you try a delicious Singapore Sling (made by hand) at Halia a restaurant that is in the Botanical Gardens. It was so refreshing on a hot day. Don't forget to wear a hat. Hope you have the opportunity to see and enjoy the gardens."
,,Pretty Orchids,4.0,,"The orchid garden is pretty and relaxing place inside the botanical gardens. It doesn't take very long to get through. A lot of the orchids start to look a lot alike, but the special ones are in the VIP orchids section. Take some time to read about the different types of hybrids."
,,Nice garden,5.0,,"This is the second time I visit this garden. First time it was more than 5 years ago. Still the same nice garden. Frankly the flowers here are nicer than in the garden of the Bay, but the architecture is not so great. However if you like flowers this is a perfect place."
,,A Place Of Must Visit,5.0,,"Every tourist to Singapore should visit this. For a small fee of S$5.00, you enjoy all of the orchid species. It is a small park, packed with hundreds of different orchid species. Open to the public 8.30am to 7pm daily. Highlights include:
1) Burkhill Hall - which is the colonial directors' residence of Singapore Botanical Gardens, currently used for wedding and special functions for a fee.
2) VIP Orchid Gardens - A place where hybrids are on display, at least 30 different types here.
3) Orchidarium - Showcasing Orchidaceae species.
4) Cool House - High altitude flowering on display here - such as pitcher plants, moss and ferns.
5) Tan Hoon Siang Misthouse - Another house of common orchids on display.
6) Yuen-Peng McNelce Bromeliad Collection - A form of flowers and fruit known as Bromeliads on display. One well-known example is the pineapple.
You will be amazed by the different colors of orchids, red, purple, pink, yellow, orange and blue, and hybrid species - with multiple colors. The place is not only about orchids, shrubs of many forms and trees, some ancient, are found to compliment the orchid plants very well. Every thing is like art, good horticulture display indeed."
,,Orchid Spectacular!,4.0,,"I could only drool! The orchids are so beautiful! Just went there to fill in time, but what a lovely way to spend an afternoon! Cool in the shade, but make sure you take plenty of water with you!"
,,part of a packaged tour,3.0,,"only did this as it was part of a tour, tend to do the organized ones for first visits to new cities. great place if you really like orchards. after about 10 mins it's much the same. well set out and maintained"
,,beautiful gardens,5.0,,"We visited the gardens twice, its free but you have to pay a small fee to go into see the orchids, but well worth it. We were amazed, its beauty, so peaceful and tranquil, you must visit to see for yourself, and so many hidden secret areas"
,,A Must See.,5.0,,"A lovely place to visit, lots of Orchids named after famous people who have all visited to see there Orchid named after them the only exception being Princess Di who didn't get there for obvious reasons. Immaculately clean (as is all of Singapore) there was a band playing round the lake and people were all sat out on the banked surround, very peaceful experience."
,,Fantastic Plant Collection,3.0,,"We visited the garden in September and were disappointed with the number and range of orchids in bloom. The gardeners told us that this is the off-season, and we should come again later. However, the bromeliad collection more than made up for the orchids. You will need to allow at least 3/4 hour for a visit, and more if you wish to look carefully at the blooms. And while visiting the orchid garden, why not also see the collection of gingers and take the forest walkway?"
,,Too little time,4.0,,We did this on a tour and what we saw was very nice and would of liked more time has a disabled path suitable for a wheelchair the orchids are beautiful and the garden has some rare ones
,,brilliant,5.0,,"I am not much of a flower person but I enjoyed looking at all the variations of orchids. I was impressed, I guess that I have now destroyed my macho image I will have visit some more gardens in other countries"
,,Tranquil,5.0,,"Beautiful gardens. Stunning orchards arranged in various 'outdoor' rooms. The gardens are beautifully kept and the whole site is spotlessly clean. Great place for photographers.

There are plenty of shady spots which can be a blessing in the heat. The shop offers a nice selection of gifts and a welcome air conditioning at the end of your visit."
,,Superb - best of the best,5.0,,"Highlight of the trip - orchid after orchid, superbly placed and lots of room to roam. $5 SG is worthy. Don't need the map/plan but it helps. The mist garden, VIP garden, cool garden...so unique - colorful, little plants, large magnificent plants. Visit the gift shop and consider the real orchids dipped in 24 kt gold on double chain"
,,Orchid Heaven,5.0,,It is the best display of Orchids in the world. It has been visited by countless world leaders and Celebrities.
,,Exquisite and beautiful,5.0,,"Really beautiful and amazing variety of orchids, set in a large spacious park with paths meandering through different 'rooms' of various botanical themes. Clean, spacious with exquisite orchids everywhere. Gift shop and amenities round out a great place to visit."

,,Must see if visiting Singapore,5.0,,I am not the big flower fan but this is definetly a must. Lovely orchids everywhere. Very impressive.
,,Stunning!,5.0,,Not being gardeners we were not sure we would enjoy this. It had been part of an organised trip to show those with limited time the highlights of Singapore. The range of orchid colours and the beautiful layout of the garden enchanted us. We really wished we could have had much longer there.
,,A real treasure tucked away in the botanic gardens.,5.0,,At S$5 for an adult S$1 concessions and free if you're under 12 this place is a steal. A huge area within the Botanic Gardens taking full advantage of Singapore's climate to present a huge array of orchids even to the extent that they have prepared small seating areas with the plants arranged at the back to make excellent photo opportunities. In Scotland we have hot houses for the exotic plants but in the Singapore Orchid Garden they have to provide cool houses for some of the plants from mountainous terrains - a welcome relief from the heat. This is one of Singapore's 'must see' attractions.
,,Absolutely beautiful!,5.0,,"The garden is really well looked after & definitely worth paying $5 for an entry. Nice to get away from a busy Orchard Road, and sink into a nature. Try to go in the morning as it can get quite hot!"
,,Gorgeous Walk in the Park,5.0,,The Orchid Garden in Singapore is truly breathtaking. We visited there on a Sunday after noon and families were picnicking and strolling around (with their dogs). The flowers were so beautiful - area well kept and just a nice place to relax. Wear comfortable walking shoes as there are miles of walking paths.
,,Amazing scenery and shelter from the sun,4.0,,Amazing gardens and great photo opportunities. It gets pretty busy at the weekends and there is enough cover from the Singapore heat (well as much as you can get!)
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Worth strolling through the botanical gardens, to the ginger garden and on to the orchid garden. Everything is free but the orchid garden is 5 sing dollars- well worth it. Go in the morning as too hot in the afternoon. The visitor center for free maps. Get some fish food there too to feed the fish. The orchids are breath taking."
,,A must visit,5.0,,"Even if you don't like flowers, put this on your list when visiting Singapore. It has left me speechless and snapping pics like crazy on my camera. The flowers make awesome screen savers"
,,Orchids,5.0,,Never seen so many beautiful flowers. So well laid out and so serene. Would have liked to have spent a little longer here

Take your camera as every corner you turn is a photographic moment. Excellent value for money as it only cost $5 entry and is located at Botanical Gardens which makes it a wonderful day out.
,,Well maintained,3.0,,Good place. But to much of walk to reach there..Botanical garden in which it is situated is a big let down.. But the distance of travel within the gardens is huge.. No internal communication. Not recommended for elderly people and parents with small kids
,,Best garden ever!,5.0,,"Mandatory visit for orchid, flowers, and garden lovers. The best place I've ever been for different and beautiful orchids."
,,A Must See If You Love Orchids!,5.0,,"Probably the greatest concentration of orchids you will find anywhere! As a bonus, admission is free! I forgot the subway stop for the garden but it's right down the stairs from the stop and you can't miss it. If you get hungry/thirsty, there are a few small cafes/stands that sell food in the park."
,,National Treasure,5.0,,"A beautiful collection of various breeds of orchids. The highlight is the garden where they bred orchids to represent specific political, or famous figures: Princess Diana, President Obama, etc. Really elegant and a lovely way to spend an afternoon."
,,Really worthwhile,5.0,,"Just get here and see it.Its not universal studio type excitement but its very very enjoyable.Did you know there are over 30,000 types of orchids? Not all of them are here of course, but it does have the Maggie Thatcher orchid and the Joe Biden orchid."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Allow at least 4 hours to have a quick look at the displays, but a whole day to take it all in. It rained quite heavy for 45 mins when we were there, of which I really enjoyed. A must see if you like flowers parks or serenity"
,,Singapore Orchids,5.0,,"Beautiful area, with many paths past every kind of orchid known to man. Because the garden is misted frequently, it is humid but not hot. At the end of the tour, there is a fantastic gift shop with reasonable prices on many, many items."

Really beautiful and pleased that I have seen it."
,,Lovely spot in a wonderful botanic garden,5.0,,The Orchid Garden in the Singapore Botanic Garden is a delightful place to spend and hour or so seeing an amazing variety of specialized orchids. Entry fees are quite reasonable and they have a special rate for senior citizens.
,,very beautiful,4.0,,visted these gardens on a bus tour and would have loved to spend more time there. Well laid out and very tidy.
,,Beautiful flowers,4.0,,A great place to enjoy the beauty of orchids in all shapes and sizes. The Orchid Garden is situated in a beautiful park. Absolutely worth the visit.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Do not miss it when visiting Singapore! The Botanical Garden is free, quiet and relaxing, and for a small charge you can visit the Orchid area."
,,A Little Bit Special,5.0,,"This is a Singapore National Treasure - or certainly should be! A photographers dream. I have been to visit a couple of times and I am never disappointed - even in the rain. Inside The Botanical Gardens, The National Orchid Garden is a feast for your eyes. The scope and scale of varieties is bewildering - or would be if there wasn't such great signage. One area is filled with all the hybrids that have been developed and named to honour celebrities and VIPs, right next to the gorgeous Burkhill Hall, a beautiful Black and White colonial house, just fabulous! There are some great indoor atriums too that have the rarer and even more beautifully displayed Orchids, and a mist room (Singapore not humid enough?) for Bromeliads. If you have the time - you will need a minimum of 60 minutes, but could spend hours - then get yourself into the Orchid Gardens for a real treat.
PS Wheelchair friendly route available."
,,A must with a camera,5.0,,We took all afternoon to walk to it from the train station and just about photograph every plant in the gardens on the way to it and at it :)

,,worth the visit,5.0,,Very nice place to visit and have a morning strolling around. Really need to allow a day to see the garden completely
,,Orchids Gone Wild!,5.0,,"This garden has an incredible collection of orchids. It's located inside the Singapore Botanic Garden which has other specialty gardens (e.g., ginger garden) inside. It takes about 20 minutes of walking from the MRT exit. If you can stand the heat, prepare to spend about half a day to fully enjoy the awesome displays. I was sweating like hell, but still managed to spend a couple of hours inside. Hint: you can go to the gift shop to enjoy some air condition. There is also a green house with AC for cool climate orchids."
,,Pretty,5.0,,There is an entry fee for this garden located within the botanical gardens. I'm not sure if I would have paid if I didn't already have a free ticket in as there's plenty to see for free within the gardens already. But it is beautiful with many different orchids and lots of photo moments.
,,Very beautiful,4.0,,We liked the rain forest and VIP gardens exhibit the best. You could probably see the entire thing in about 1.5 hours. We skipped half of the garden as it was really hot out that day. Worth a visit while in Singapore I think
,,beautiful and expansive,5.0,,"the variety of flowers and how well laid out the garden was were immediate highlights. the nursery, vip area and the sprawling gardens were so peaceful"
,,and they have a monkey,5.0,,"Beautiful flowers everywhere.

Oh, and an Iguana, nonchalantly crossing the path in front of you - a really fantastic place of wonder."
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"Gorgeous orchids in a lovely garden. You could spend all day here, don't forget your camera and be prepared for a lot of walking."
,,Enjoying the beautiful Singapore Botanical Garden,5.0,,"Every time I go to Singapore I visit the delightful Botanical Garden and of course the National Orchid Garden.

I liked this place very much. So did my mom."

,,A good place within Botanical Garden,5.0,,"Part of the Singapore Botanical Garden, Orchid Garden is a must visit place for all plant lovers and also otherwise. An excellent collection of orchid and a small souvenir shop. Entry to the botanical garden is free, though there is an entry ticket to enter the National Orchid Garden."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"This was part of a half day city tour of Singapore - we were given 45 minutes to look around which was just not long enough. The orchids are beautiful and there are so many different varieties.
There is a short walk from the drop-off point from the coach to the entrance to the gardens which reduces the time allowed to look round while on a 'timed' tour."

,,So pretty,5.0,,"Definitely put this on your to do list. I like orchid's but I can live without them !!! But after visiting the ""National Orchard Garden"" I have a better appreciation for them. The colours, the different sizes, I couldn't get enough :) This is such a pretty place, great for a picnic or to take the kids so they can have a run around safely in the park area. I recommend going there very highly. You won't be disappointed especially if your after a day of tranquility after all the shopping and tour buses !"

I recommend wearing a sunhat or maybe taking an umbrella as a gardens are pretty warm and there can be some places with no shade however there are drinking fountains around which is great. The cool house is great to go into! All the signs around the garden are informative, I really like the hybrid orchards one of my favourites was the Margaret Thatcher Orchid."

,,Beautiful and Worth The Effort!,5.0,,"It may be located a bit out of the CBD (lucky cabs are cheap!) and a long walk in the heat, but it is definitely worth it to see those beautiful flowers in bloom and enjoy the tropical weather.

The Orchid in Singapore's National Flower and here you can understand their love and fascination of this exotic treat.

Dress in light layers as shade is rare and it will take 1-2 hours to truly explore and appreciate."
,,A Great Place for Regular Visits,4.0,,"I've been to the National Orchid Garden in Singapore quite a few times over the last 13 years and have enjoyed every visit, though some more than others. The Garden is always interesting, relaxing and a great opportunity for photography or for simply strolling around and having a leisurely chat with a friend, but sometimes more of the orchids are in spectacular flower than other times. I guess it depends on the time of year.

The National Orchid Garden is certainly a very inexpensive way to spend an hour, as the admission charge is quite low. The souveneir shop immediately outside the Garden (but still within the Singapore Botanic Gardens) is one of the best places to buy relatively classy and interesting gifts in Singapore to take home to family and friends."
,,The National Orchid Garden is beautiful,5.0,,I did this because it was included as a feature on the City Tour that I took. I am very happy that I have done it and I saw everything I desired to see in about 45 minutes.

,,Must see,5.0,,"On our 30 hours stopover in Singapore we visited the National Orchid Garden which is located in the Botanic Gardens. A small entry fee is charged but visiting definitively is worth the money.

useful tip: - very very long walk if you get down at botanical garden mrt as you need to walk a long way as its very hot and humid. try taking a bus to the orchard road entrance of botanical garden, that's easier to access (orchard mrt is 25min walk to the other gate)
Get hydrated - carry lots and lots of liquid, preferable some glucose or energy drink!"
,,Paradise of flowers!,5.0,,"We visited Singapore and were very impressive by the beauty of the Orchid garden! It is really worth being called a paradise of flowers in the world.

You remain amazed of the huge variety of shapes, dimensions and colours of the orchids, while having a nice walk in the gardens and glass houses."

We would come here again - just not in the middle of the day!"

,,Out of this World,5.0,,"Not to be missed this garden lies within Singapore Botanical gardens and although there is a small charge (5sgd and 1sgd for seniors) it is well worth the money.

We were just bowled over but unfortunately the scorching sun coupled with the high humidity meant we could not linger. This must be one of the world's best collections but I will let my photographs do the talking. Please take a look."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,I loved this garden. My husband wouldn't come with me so I could see it at my leisure. I was there 26 years ago on our honeymoon so was keen to go back. If you love flowers you will love this garden.

Stunning array of orchids and other tropical plants - we walked around for about four hours and thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely worthwhile.

,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"For orchids lovers and others, a must do in Singapore. I knew Singapore was known for this garden, and we did not regret going there during our holidays in Singapore.

Just imagine the most beautiful collection of orchids, in an amazing landscape. Even my wife who loves orchids had no clue that there existed so many variations in colours, shapes, etc.

So a must visit. One little thing, the garden is beautiful in all season, but probably best to visit in spring as in September there were a lot of orchids that had finished blossoming (still that leaves so many still in full blossom ;-) )"
,,Perfection. Totally beautiful,5.0,,A walk around the orchid garden is one of the most beautiful strolls you can have in Singapore. The profusion of orchids is unbelieveable and photo opportunities great

but worth the visit
have to
very rich collection and good landscaping and there is a good brochure that you can get on the entrance

,,Simply beautiful,4.0,,Wonderful place to come and relax-orchids are absolutely stunning. Great place for photography. Would highly recommend. Nice little gift shop too-not tacky!
,,So...many...orchids,5.0,,Stunning collection that goes on and on. Well worth the price. It even has a hybrid made for Margaret Thatcher.
,,must see in Singas,5.0,,"The botanical gardens are a haven in this city and the orchid gardens spectacular. Set aside a morning to walk around this spectacular space, only a $10 cab ride from the swissotel sir stamford or raffles."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is stunning. The layout is excellent and the orchids beautiful. It is an oasis of calm only a $10 taxi ride from the vibrant city centre. It is wonderful to see so many orchids in a natural setting and I now know that 10% (25-30,000) of the world's flowering plants are orchids! The Singapore Botanic Gardens, of which this is a part is free and there is a nominal( $5 per adult $1 for seniors)charge for the orchid garden, which is well worth it."
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit; good for romantic, and also for families. Beautiful gardens with various tropical, colorful flowers"

,,Nice Garden for a half day visit,4.0,,It is a different experience to visit this garden away from hustle and bustle of Singapore. Orchids are great and lot of photo opportunities.
,,Bring your walking shoes!,4.0,,"The cheapest way to get here is via the MRT - the station is very close to the garden entrance. However, as others have said, the walk from the entrance closest to the MRT station is a long walk from the Orchid Garden (probably a 30+ minute walk). It was so far that on the way back, we decided to catch a taxi home instead of walking back to the MRT station!

The Botanic Gardens is beautiful and well maintained. There is a fee to get into the orchid garden - the orchids there are pretty, but they were all quite common species and colours and there is no orchid there that I would describe as amazing. I would really like to see some of the more rarer or unusual species displayed. The fact that they present them as flowering on mass is nice. We were hoping to buy some flasks of orchids, but the shop only sold single baby orchid plants which cost much more than they did at the orchid farms."
,,Didnt know there were so many species...,5.0,,Great garden with lots to see. Beautiful flowers and amazing scenery. Gift shop has nice souvenirs made of orchids!
,,Simply stunning,5.0,,"Glorious. A huge variety of beautiful orchids in a lovingly designed garden. A real gem of a place, which is ""gilding the lily"" (!) of the wonderful Botanic Gardens. At $5 entry, a real bargain."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Beautiful display and setting inside the botanic gardens. There is an entrance fee although botanic gardens are free. Take mrt to botanic gardens. If you walk right through then there is a bus on the far side back to orchard road. But it is a long walk from one to the other
,,Blooming Marvellous,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is within the Botanic Garden, but there is a small entry charge. The orchids are stunning. Well worth visiting. The gift shop has some good items on sake - many orchid related."
,,Breakfast in the gardens!,5.0,,"I got lucky and went on an overcast day. Yes, I got a couple of light sprinkles, but I kept cool throughout my entire morning at the garden. The breakfast place is delightful and has an interesting serving system. Search for Food For Thought Cafe to get an idea before heading out there. The food is phenom!

Don't forget our umbrella, rain or shine :)"
,,Fantastic photo opportunity,5.0,,Whats not to like if you love tranquility & beautiful orchids in every colour & variety. One the day we visited an outdoor concert was in rehearsal & we enjoyed classical music with our experience
,,Absolute HEAVEN! Words cannot describe the beautiful Orchids!,5.0,,"Words cannot describe the beauty of this place! I was told that this was spectacular but it really exceeded my expectations. Even my grumpy teenage children thought it was great! Even if you don't like gardens or flowers this is a sight to behold, the layout is beautiful and the vast variety of Orchids will not disappoint! The entry to the botanic gardens is free & there is a $5 fee for the Orchid garden - which I felt was excellent value. Just remember to take plenty of water to drink & comfy shoes! Easy to get to by public transport, taxis or the 'Hop on / Hop off Buses' This was one of the highlights of our trip!"
,,Oh so many vaiety of orchids- wonderful to see,5.0,,I like the garden so much. DO NOT FORGET TO BUY ANY SOUVENIER THERE. I bought one. I wanted to buy a souvenier of orchid to my wife hair pin- somehow i did not do it. Now i repent for the same. The hairpin with orchid stucked is excellent !

,,Orchid Garden,4.0,,"Beautifully laid out, S$5 entrance, but worth it. Lovely displays of a large range of Orchids. quite exquisite in places. A ""must visit"" if you like gardening or orchids or flowers. The Botanic Gardens themselves were OK, but nothing exciting to talk about. Bus stop right outside, easy travel to city via Orchard Rd."
,,Stunning collection,5.0,,Excellent place to wander round during your stay in Singapore! Worth the entry price and students get a discount.
,,xu,4.0,,"after the botanic gardens this was a special place to see some exotic orchards , perfect for orchard lovers , a huge variety , so well done"

,,Super Pretty!,4.0,,"I was blown away by how lush Singapore was. I pictured it more as an industrial city, but it reminded me more of Hawaii than anything.

The Gardens in the middle of the city are a welcomed oasis within an oasis, and the National Orchid Garden was stunning.

Definitely worth the $5-10 ticket"
,,Nice Break from the City,4.0,,This is a surprise attraction to take a break in. The whole area was clean and the collection of orchids was impressive
,,a must if you ever buy orchids!,5.0,,Always a great place to visit. Make sure you include the rest of the Botanic Gardens though. The orchid garden is quite small and can get very busy with Japanese and Korean tourists who tend to visit when the garden first opens in the mornings.
,,Nice place with lots of orchids,4.0,,"This place is actually inside the Botanic garden of Singapore. While it is free to enter the botanic garden, it costs S$5 to enter the orchid garden. The place is full of orchids with so many different species: beautiful, colorful and even fragrant!
It is not very big, so you can leisurely walk around at your own pace. There are restaurants and food court inside too."
,,Impressive collection of Orchids,5.0,,"The Orchid garden is really worth a visit if you can spare a few hours ( go in the one morning as the heat can be tough in the afternoon)
The collection is huge, the biggest we have seen so far. So many varieties & colours.
Location :
Located inside the Singapore Botanic Gardens
For those photographs apprentice, it goes without saying that you need to bring extra memory cards."
,,Shame that it cost money,4.0,,Very beautiful and well kept Orchid Garden. It was a bit underwhelming after seeing the rest of the Botanical Gardens which were also very beautiful.
,,Truly spectacular,5.0,,The botanical gardens give you a great break from the concrete city but the Orchid garden is truly special- one of the world's great geardens. It is very large so allow plenty of time and try to go early or latte to avoid the hottest part of the day. The variety will astound you. A must in Singapore.
,,So beautiful,5.0,,"The collection of Orchid was so extensive. I love flowers, specially Orchid. There are number of Singapore hybrid verities."
,,Awesome,4.0,,It was well maintained. Orchids were really beautiful. Natural beauty! The area is very wide and spread across good length. Nice to see preserved flowers in air conditioned environment.

,,Don't miss the Orchid Gardens,4.0,,The gardens were fabulous and the price to the orchid gardens is well worth it. You'll not be disappointed
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The orchids are gorgeous. So many different varieties and colors- this part of the Botanical Gardens has a fee associated with it- but the small fee is worth it to be able to see the flowers.
,,most beautiful garden ever,5.0,,"just purely amazing, words cant do it justice, you just have to see it for your self. well worth the 5$ entry fee. it is just a small section of a much larger garden."
,,Colorful Flowers,4.0,,"There are lots of different variety of orchids. They group them together in a really picturesque way. This is the highlight of the Botanical Gardens for me. Don't be in a rush, take your time and appreciate the flowers."
,,orchid,5.0,,Beautiful place for tourist to see. I guarantee people come will fall in love with it. Nothing I dislike because everything is so beautiful and romantic
,,Overall a nice place..,4.0,,"There were many rare orchids, it takes time to a get a picture of all of them. With a small entrance fee, it was really worth especially if you're into orchids or macro photography.."
,,A Must-See While at the Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"Expensive Singapore can take a toll on you, but my husband and I decided it was well worth spending S$5 / $4 per person for us to see this 18 year old fantastic garden. Located inside of the Singapore Botanic Gardens (which has no admission), the 3 hectares / 7 acres of landscaped slopes provide a setting of abundant colors. The garden claims there are about 600 species and hybrids of orchids on display. So much is on display in a compact, but beautiful area!
What is really neat is that the plantings are in four separate “color zones”. The spring zone has lively shades of gold, yellow and creams. Since we visited this great place in August, the summer zone was vivid with bright reds and pinks. In the autumn zone, there are mature shade plants, and the winter zone logically has whites and cool blues.
Despite numerous days of 32° C / 90° F with 90% humidity in Singapore, we were pleasantly surprised to go through a part of this garden that is dedicated to the orchids of the mountains of Malaysia and of South America. The environment was a lot cooler than outside, and a very fine mist was being sprayed on to the orchids. One did feel like they were in the clouds of the Crocker Range, in Sabah.
It goes without saying that a photographer will go crazy here. Orchids in this garden are like nothing one usually sees. Most people see orchids with a few blooms. All over this garden, there are orchids with dozens of blooms! The colors can just saturate the camera lens.
Make a special trip to the south side of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Go early in the morning to beat the heat of the day and to take time getting those great photographs."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"If you like flowers, you have to see it. I've never seen such gorgeous orchids before.Sometimes,in botanic gardens they have a few orchids, but here there are a lot of(about 50 types) orchids. The Orchid Garden is a part of Botanic Garden. It's worth to see it."

,,Stunningly beautiful,5.0,,"Well worth a visit no matter how short your time in Singapore. So many species of orchids, the gardens are imaginatively laid out, we could have spent hours there. Refreshments rather disappointing, icecreams sold out, & iced coffee was good ($8). Unfortunately we did not have time to go to the ginger garden. It was very busy but there were no queues. The souvenir shop was high quality, but expensive, like everything else in Singapore!"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Visited as part of the Tour East City Tour. This is not somewhere I would have visited on my own but im glad I did. The range of orchards are simply beautiful
,,Beautiful Retreat near Orchard Rd shopping area,5.0,,"What a beautiful retreat in the middle of Singapore. I walked over from the Shangri-la hotel (although there was a free shuttle bus from the hotel that gets you pretty close). It was a lovely walk with few tourists on an August day.

,,An average experience..,3.0,,I had heard a lot about these garden (No.1 on Trip Advisor) but I was a bit disappointed by the experience. This place is quite far from the main city and reaching it using public transport is not that easy (around 1.5 hrs easily with multiple change points). Agree that the garden is maintained well but frankly for someone who is not a botanist multiple varieties of orchids doesn't really generate that enthusiasm after you have seen one or two varieties. I was staying in Singapore for long time hence I went on one weekend; however I would not suggest a tourist to spend half a day on this garden. There are better things to do !!

The colours and varieties vary from very small and delicate to large and showy. You can stroll quietly around and follow the curve of the land to see all manor of different plants as well as the glorious orchids. The shady trees and enclosures make it a cool oasis. You can find a secluded spot to sit and just enjoy life and natures beauty. Well worth a visit to see a little more of what this great city has to offer."
,,worth the visit,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Orchid Garden. As an avid gardener and orchid grower, I truly appreciated the beauty of the gardens.

,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Absolutely beautiful from start to finish. The skywalk is actually scarier than it looks (somehow!) although it was rather windy when we went, but I did make it to the other side without adopting the foetal position. I left my camera at the hotel the day I went to the garden, which I was bitterly disappointed about, as there were some stunning pictures to be taken. The flowers on show were simply beautiful and well worth the admission price, which I think totalled around S$30 each (about £17)"
,,"Pretty, but hot!",4.0,,"It can be quite uncomfortable outside for so long at that heat, however I would recommend these gardens. You see a wide range of plants in pretty scenery, and even as a teen, I enjoyed seeing it. Conveniently located with the Botanic Gardens MRT station near."
,,A pleasant few hours,4.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is a separate part of the botanic gardens and is the only part that you must pay to enter. Recently they must have changed their pricing schedule because up until now we had no inclination to pay that sort of money to visit.
It is a pleasant and simple walk amongst the fine orchid they are able to grow here in Singapore. A leisurely stroll with plenty to see, and finishing off with the cool house makes for a welcome end to a day in the sun.
I recommend people do it as something to see that is interesting, but if you miss it no big deal either. A good way to spend a few hours in an afternoon."

So many exquisite orchids in full bloom - all well labelled - plus the beautiful black and white director's house were wonderful. I could have spent hours scrutinising every orchid. An unforgettable garden - all helped by a very reasonable entry fee for 'seniors' and a great gift shop which provided all the wet weather gear when our party was caught out in the rain. Unmissable."

,,One of the best Singapore sites,5.0,,"I live in Singapore, and this is probably a favorite of all my visitors. It is the largest orchid garden in the world and even if you are not into plants, it is hard not to be impressed (especially when you go into the Mist house with the rare orchids).

Not just you'll see more varieties than the hair on your head, but their colours and scent will drive you bananas, in a good way. The garden is very well kept, like the rest of the botanic garden; just outside the orchids garden there's a tree planted by and dedicated to Nelson Mandela.

,,Beautiful flowers,4.0,,"The garden was very nicely laid out in terms of the display of the orchids, but I would have liked more information on each orchid, like where it has come from, it's name both common and horticultural, the environment it likes to grow etc. It seems a common theme in most ""displays/tours"" I have been on so far, they are slightly bemused that you want knowledge rather than just to look at a lovely display. Also no books in the shop about orchids, just orchid themed giftshop items. Don't get me wrong I loved the garden, and highly recommend a visit even if orchid's aren't your thing, I just left slightly frustrated at the lack of knowledge gained."

To do a proper visit would take at least two hours. I suppose they can add many more exotic tropical orchids and make it even more wonderful. During my visit there last month, I found it rather difficult to get to the Garden, because the directions through the GPS system led to a deadend at a one way street! Finally another tourist lent me a hard copy map with which we found our way to the garden's entrance. There is not enough parking space for cars and what is available is not close enough for old and disadvantaged persons."
,,Orchid Garden,4.0,,The exhibit was beautiful. I was able to take fantastic pictures of the large variety of orchids. It was well worth the small fee.
,,Singapore orchid garden,5.0,,The different orchids and bromiliads that were there. Not all in flower but that was to be expected. The mists dome and the cold pavillion were excellent.
,,Serenity,5.0,,Amazing place to visit in what can be at times a hectic city. I went early in the morning after it had been raining and everything looked so fresh!
,,Orchids galore,5.0,,"Set in the heart of the SIngapore Botanical gardens this is an orchid lovers delight. Even to a neophyte like me I was amazed at the variety of types and colours of the orchids. The walk around the garden is quite a sloping path and hot work in the Singapore climate, so reccommend you take cool drinks with you.
The required retail opportunity at the exit has plenty of orchid related souvenirs and gifts, who could leave Singapore without a gold-plated orchid!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Many varieties of orchids, some named after VIP, celebrities, etc. Admission fee S$5 for adults. Not only orchids, there are other varieties of flowers."
,,Far from the maddening crowd,4.0,,"So Singapore from my family is 'shop 'till you drop' territory. Ther might be six shops of the same brand in Singapore and boy you just have to check out each one!
So, I managed to tear them away from Orchard Rd just long enough to take a glimpse of the Orchid Gardens. The botanical barns are a wonderful respite. Tranquil, green and cool. The ginger garden and the orchid gardens are free shingle beautiful and not very crowded. The numerous varieties or orchids are amazing."
,,Orchid heaven,4.0,,"The orchids were awesome. The settings were sometimes a little too formalised for my personal tastes, but the orchids themselves shone like the little stars that they are. I especially loved the cool, natural enclosure where a 'wilder' look was successfully cultivated (now that's an art). I also enjoyed seeing people get their photos taken next to the orchids, the flowers really bring out the best in us!"
,,Loved the orchids,5.0,,"I always want to come to the orchid gardens when I visit Singapore. The flowers were exquisite and the tourist shop of souvenirs was very good too. Nice staff. Very clean toilets too.
The photo stops on the way around the gardens were well placed too."
,,Definitely worth a visit,4.0,,"There is a large selection of orchids. Housing over 1000 species and 2000 hybrids, largest display of tropical orchids in the world. This is next to the Botanical Gardens which is walking distance from the Traders hotel"

,,Wonderful,5.0,,This is a must visit for anyone interested in plants and the Orchid Gardens are superb. Well laid out with an enormous number of species and hybrids. The Botanic Gradens are a terrific achievemnt that just gets better each year. Very impressed
,,Orchid extravaganza,4.0,,The cool house alone is worth the SG$5.00 entry fee. Allow 45 minutes to an hour to take it slow and admire the displays.
,,I simply love the Orchids,5.0,,I simply love the Orchids ... it's so refreshing and relaxing to stay inside the garden...time allocated to visit the place is too short..wish we could stay longer!
,,The best.......,5.0,,".......display of orchids imaginable. Even on a cloudy, humid and rainy day this wasn't one to miss and we weren't disappointed. The dearly beloved thoroughly enjoyed herself."
,,"If you like orchids, you'll love this place!",5.0,,The botanical gardens surrounding the orchid gardens are immense and immaculately prunned. Lovely place to escape for a day.... They have weddings onsite in the Orchid Garden and the traditional dress is worth the journey alone.
,,A must-watch attraction at Singapore,5.0,,"Situated in the Botanic Gardens of Singapore is the beautiful Orchid garden that houses 1000s of orchid species. Check out the site (mentioned below) for details on time and how to get there. If you take the Metro (Circle Line), you can alight at the Botanic Gardens station and step into the garden as you step out of the station. If you have plenty of time take a stroll around the botanic garden (follow the map) to view the tall trees that might just touch the sky. Walk through the rain forests to reach the Orchid & Ginger gardens, or alternatively take the quick route to the Orchid gardens. At a ticket of 5 SGD (for adults), you get to witness the largest display of tropical orchids in the world. The coolhouse and misthouse are just awesome. Don't forget to carry your cameras, you can pictures for a lifetime."
,,beautiful orchids,5.0,,Would have liked more time to check out the gardens. Our tour only gave us 20 minute which was too rushed. The array of orchids was beautiful and very unusual
,,"""A place for Nature Lovers",5.0,,"A place for 60k orchids with 400 species. If you are looking for shades of Trees, Looking for Serenity, River, Park, want to see kids playing...Do visit this place. This place has all these in it. Do visit with MRT & drop at Botanical Garden station. Entry start with the Botanical Garden & is free. Once you entered it look around so many trees & look for way to National Orchid Garden as they way to it starts within the Botanical Garden.

,,Do not miss,5.0,,In the heart of the Botanic Gardens is an eye-popping exhibit of the most stunning orchids. You will be unable to take a bad picture because the orchids are simply stunning.
,,Not just orchids,5.0,,"Being in Singapore, you'd expect the National Orchid Garden, within the Botanical Gardens, would have a spectacular display of a huge range of orchids - and it doesn't disappoint. However its highlights are the display of hybrids, grown within the Gardens and named for, and presented to visiting dignitaries from around the world, an old Colonial house, formerly the home of the Director of the Gardens and a number of other specialised plant displays such as Bromeliads. The gardens, with the Botanical Gardens, are located in a beautiful part of Singapore, close to but a million miles away from the crowds and concrete and glass of Singapore City. It will soon be connected to a brand new metro line currently being built."
,,Orchid Garden: Heard a lot about it!,4.0,,"When you are in Singapore, you should spend an idle afternoon there, obviously with your loved ones...! The staff at the entry point were nice and generous!!.. Loved it all the ways!!"
,,Garden walk,5.0,,Very refreshing walk in the garden in natural surroundings . Can have more outlet for beverages as it is generally hot and humid

,,Amazing and spectacular!!,5.0,,"A must in Singapore for every nature lover!!! Also don't miss the rest of the Botanical Gardens, in my opinion one of the best in the world."
,,One of the few must-sees,5.0,,Go early - it opens at 8:30 - to avoid crowds. The orchids are amazing. What you see indoors at other botanical gardens you here see outdoors in great plenitude.
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"Certainly provided some inspiration for the garden and our orchid plants! Wonderfully laid out with lots of photo opportunities and what is even better is for novices, they have a sign which says ""photo shot."""
,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,"The Orchid garden is within the Botanical Gardens which on their own are absolutely amazing.
We were on one of the tour buses that stop here, driver recommended we visited really glad we did. There is a rain forest a large lake with a concert platform in it, there was a pianist playing during our visit and this gave it a magical atmosphere. Entrance to the gardens is free and if you didn't go into the Orchid garden you would still have a great experience. Can't remember what charge was for Orchid garden but it wasn't expensive, we got in for next to nothing on a seniors concession. I would say this is a must if you like gardens. The new Marina Bay gardens are also amazing but this is really beautiful."
,,Lots of pretty flowers....,4.0,,"The highlight of my day at the Botanical Gardens had to be the Orchid Garden (which cost $5 Singapore Dollars to get in). I was skeptical given the sad state of affairs for the orchid garden back in KL. The flowers in Singapore, though, were quite lovely and there were several different displays. The money was definitely worth the price. My favorite was the Cool House (for obvious reasons - it is air conditioned) that housed Orchids from icier mountain climes. There was a nifty waterfall in it too. A very worthwhile visit."
,,Orchids...,4.0,,"well what to say, nice garden full of orchids... so if that is your thing you will love it here. go early to avoid the heat and there is a little lack taxis so be prepared for a wait."
,,Garden with many Photo Stops,4.0,,"There are great varieties of Orchids in this garden. It is part of National Botanical garden which is really huge place. There are many spots where you can click photos for great family album.

It takes around 2 hours to see the entire garden in leisure and one can spend quality time taking amazing photos."
,,Good Hike from the MRT,4.0,,Great place to visit with many varieties of orchids. The cost was $5 per adult and $1 per student. It takes about an hour to walk around the Orchid Garden but takes a good 20-30 minutes to hike to/from the MRT.
,,Great jogging trail,5.0,,Sceneray is beautiful throughout the jogging trail. Trails are well laid out and nice art pieces to keep you interested along the way.
,,Plants in Singapore,4.0,,"The 6 foot tall orchids are amazing, there are also a lot of other plants to see. I would recommend it to anyone"
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,"My nana wanted to visit the orchid garden, so we mainly did this to please her, and i am gald we did! I am amazed at some of the orchids on show, they were beautiful! The garden itself was easy to navigate, clean and had plenty of things to look at. Would definitely go back."
,,Stunning Orchids,5.0,,"Was privileged to have the orchids of the National Orchid Garden shown to us on a recent visit. I'm not a garden but really enjoyed our time with these diverse and stunning plants,"
,,A botanical garden within a botanical garden,5.0,,This garden provides a vast amount of space to showcase orchids of all types. Be sure to visit the mist house as well as the cool house. The mist house showcases some especially striking and attractive arrangements. Coming from a non-tropical part of the world it's amusing to find that the greenhouse preserves a cool atmosphere for those exotic plants from other parts of the world that aren't hot all the time.
,,Stunning,4.0,,If you can take the heat/humidity it is worth the trek about the gardens. Beautiful displays of many kinds or orchids-impressive. Not much for children to see or do here better for adults.

,,This place is Beautiful,4.0,,I had no idea how many orchids there are in the world.. this place must have them all.. walked for hours and seen so many i could not believe all in a well manicured environment.. very nice
,,Do it!,4.0,,"If you like orchids (or bromeliads--there is a small section devoted to them in the Orchid Garden), I think it's worthwhile. I was disappointed that the national flower wasn't in bloom, but we did manage to find a few that were still alive. Not the garden's fault, though! It's amazing that do many can grow outdoors. Lucky Singaporeans :)."
,,Wow,4.0,,"I wasn't excpecting this to be so good, but I saw so beautiful enviroment. Especially plants, flowers and trees. If you want to study more about enviroment come here!"

,,The orchid garden is a must do if visiting Singapore.,5.0,,"You must take a beautiful stroll through a garden topped off with the most gorgeous orchids you will ever see. We enter the Botanical Gardens near the Tanglin Rd. entrance and make our way to the orchid garden via Swan Lake and the Ginger Garden. This length of trip is just about right if you are visiting on a hot day. The park is full of happy people enjoying themselves - picnics, runners, families everywhere. Don't miss the Princess Diana orchid!!"
,,"Simply amazing orchids""",5.0,,If you want to relax in Singapore this is the perfect place. The botanical gardens are beautifully maintained and the orchid garden is just spectacular. I visited this garden several years ago and was happy to return. There are so many different types of orchids and they are planted with great care. I am not a gardening fanatic but loved this place. We walked to Orchard Road afterwards which was easy because most of the walk was in the shade. I would advise going early in the day to avoid the heat.
,,Allow Plenty Of Time,5.0,,If you enjoy gardens and Orchids this would have to be the best in the world it will keep you and your camera busy for many memorable hours seniors discounts available.
,,National Orchid Garden Preview,5.0,,"Preview the National Orchid Garden at http://www.facebook.com/nationalorchidgardensingapore . If you like gardens, this is a must-see destination in Singapore.

,,Lovely,4.0,,"everything is all pretty,if u love flowers,so many type of orchids and u can take loads of pictures,but if you dont love flowers... pretty boring....."
,,Beautiful but HOT,4.0,,The botanical garden in general was spectacular but the orchid garden a special treat. the flowers are so beautiful and the whole experience is incredible - except for he heat and humidity which sent us back to our hotel in only 3 hours instead of the all day stay we had planned
,,Good spot,4.0,,This place has the largest display of tropical orchids in the world.The distinctive feature of the National Orchid Garden is its design concept. you must visit here to know it.
,,Stunning,5.0,,I'm not a big botanist or anything but I have to say that I thought the orchids were beautiful and I never knew that there were so many different kinds.
,,What a joy!,5.0,,"No trip to Singapore would be complete without a trip to the orchid gardens. With such a cheap entrance fee, it's go to in included in your itinerary! The open top bus stops here, so is within easy reach"
,,Beautiful place to visit!,5.0,,"When you need a break from the city, visit here or the Chinese gardens. Both are very beautiful and relaxing places to visit."
,,Nice to visit if you like flowers,3.0,,"A nice display of orchids, but quite small and a bit of a hike away. But if you like flowers I recommend visiting it."
,,Orchid Trip,3.0,,"Look, the Orchid Garden is a nice place to visit - my only gripe is that it takes a long time to walk from the entrance to the point where the garden starts. Once you're in the garden, it's quite beautiful and a calm and peaceful few hours. We visited the day before Prince William and Kate were arriving so the place was quite a hive of activity. It was a nice outing, but it's not necessarily something you do twice."
,,beautiful,5.0,,"nice garden with beautiful layout! though we went there in hot/dry season, it was worth the trip. for people who like to see unusual orchids a must see!"

,,"Beautiful stunning,colourful,peaceful place and the flowers are good as well.",5.0,,"We visited this place as part of a city tour and this gave us a brief taster of what will be a great day out. The cover of the tree canopy gave shade from the sun which was good, but it did raised the humidity even more so only wear very light clothes. The flowers are just beautiful and the whole setting is a joy to walk around. There are a few hills so this may not be so easy for people who cannot walk far . The selection of orchids is just stunning and to an English person the concept of a cool house was interesting as in the uk it would be a tropical house. Everywhere was very clean and the flowers very well tendered even in their natural surrounding. Drink and food was available on site and all the facilities were of a good standard. I could have spent at least a half day there given time."
,,One of the gems of Singapore,5.0,,"Really worth the extra five dollars to visit. Orchids are hard to grow to begin with. The place smells incredible and because of the fee, the crowds are smaller than in the rest of the park. Really beautiful, gem of a place..."
,,Wonderful place to walk around,4.0,,"Very positive experience here, it was a great place to go. We went smack in the middle of the day around lunch time so it was pretty hot, but overall it was very pleasant. It was a great place to wander around and just take in the beauty of the gardens. They are well maintained, clean, and the facilities (bathrooms) are good."
,,STUNNING,5.0,,"This is a must visit place when in Singapore! The orchids are amazing both in size and colour. Despite its popularity, we did not experience crowds and were able to see the orchids easily. We visited by bus and this is an easy place to visit."

,,Stunning,5.0,,"The most amazing collection of orchids. And the general Botanic Gardens, where the Orchid Garden is located, is also phenomenal."
,,Peaceful and really nice,4.0,,"Worth taking ti;e to walk through the alleys and appreciate the quiet beauty of hundreds or orchids very different from one another and mixed with other trees and plants. Plus it's really cheap and they have great discounts for students, senior, etc..."
,,Take insect repellant,5.0,,"Lovely place to visit a little out of the way but worth it if you have the time, some amazing plants."
,,must see,4.0,,"brilliant. So nice to see all the different orchid which was actually in the Botanic gardens, so just make sure you go to the Botanic gardens and you will see both"
,,"Beautifully kept, an oasis away from the city",4.0,,"We visited the Orchid Garden during our trip to Singapore in May as part of a two day stopover. It was a beautiful excursion that we really enjoyed, a nice break from the bustle of Orchard road and other city highlights.

Very tranquil and well kept, there are many beautiful orchids to be seen. It would be a lovely place to bring a picnic!

Definitely worth a visit if you have the time!"
,,Go and See this Treasure!,5.0,,"Easy to get to off the SMRT (subway system). Lots of walking, lots to see. The orchids are wonderful and I'm not really an orchid fanatic. Go and see!"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,We really enjoyed what was our second trip to the orchid garden. Very interesting and an amazing variety of orchids v
,,So many fantastic orchids,5.0,,"Wow, I thought this would be a single greenhouse or something similar, not a large area within the Botanic Gardens with a cool house, a mist house and two VIP gardens.

The stars of the show are the orchids which are absolutely stunning, so many colours and shapes, ranging from tiny to huge flowers - I have a huge case of orchid envy."
,,Simply sublime!,5.0,,"Singapore's National Orchid Garden is beyond the simple term ""beautiful"". Even people who are not the outdoors type wouldn't be able resist the tranquility, abundance of colours and variety of orchids. When in Singapore, I would definitely recommend visiting the Garden if you have time to spare, as you could easily spend an hour+ here....... but bring lots of water, because it can get very humid and warm in Singapore, you will perspire profusely with all the walking."
,,Nice stop on the tourist bus,4.0,,"The surroundings are very beautiful and serene, but quite large, and walking around mid day is a very hot and humid affair. Beautiful meadows, and a large pond with a staggering amount of fish and turtles, if I lived nearby I could see myself spending a lot of time here in the weekends. Seemed to be a popular spot for jogging.

All in all, a relaxing and beautiful place."
,,What a wonderful garden,5.0,,Fantastic could have spent hours walking around. Worth the 5 dollars to visit. Over sixty you can get in for 1 dollar
,,very nice,5.0,,the botanic gardens are beautiful and free. but you have to pay for the orchid garden. there is a metro station at the entrance of the botanic gardens.
,,A variety of beautiful orchids,4.0,,Anyone who is a lover of orchids will be delighted to come to this garden. I suggest to go there early in the morning because it was quite a walk going to the garden. We went there before noon and we were perspiring profusely due to the sunlight and humidity. The good thing about this place is that the MRT station is right inside the botanical garden.
,,a delight,4.0,,"This was a delightful display. .. You must take your time... and make allowances knowing full well that orchids thrive on humidity. I was a little disappointed in that there was no coverage of miniature orchids in the exhibit. The cool house was empty of any flowering orchids during my visit. But altogether, this is great visit in one's stay in Singapore."
,,For Orchard Lovers,3.0,,"This was a nice walk with some good colour. Rather then doing the full Botanical Gardens, which is a lot of walking for little to see,I would just do this. In saying that, if you only have a limited time in Singapore I would only recommend this to lovers of orchards"
,,"Virtually all orchids known to man, presented with love and care.",5.0,,"If you're into orchids, this is the place to be. Never have I seen a place that presented this lovely kind of flower in a more delicate and loving way. The garden is in mint condition and a pure pleasure to stroll through."
,,Really beautiful,4.0,,"The orchid garden was really beautiful, I don't know a lot about plants but I really enjoyed it.
I had less than an hour in there, which was a bit of a rush and didn't get to see the orchids named after celebrities! But everything I did see was lovely."
,,Tropical Orchids,5.0,,"The largest display of tropical orchids we have every seen and our cameras were kept busy trying to capture the varieties to share with friends upon our return. A well laid out garden which you can do at a leisurely pace remembering it is a hot, humid climate in Singapore. As we were o/seas visitors they gave us a special entrance fee.... have to be a senior :)"
,,Good collection- Do not forget to view Carnivorous,4.0,,Liked carnivorous plants.. Tropical Rainforest was interesting to see. Good collection of orchids. Bit tiring to reach using public transport here but it was worth.
,,OMG,5.0,,The worlds most divine orchid collection. Its soo amazingly well done. very well worth 5 bucks. don't skip to cool house.
,,National Orchid Garden,5.0,,"I enjoyed the orchid garden a great deal, took heaps of lovely photos and saw a great variety that I had not seen before. Went in May and was lucky that the weather was not terribly humid and hot since the walk around the botanical gardens would get stifling I think. The gardens are not hard to find & taxis are not very expensive to reach the gardens."
,,Amazing flowers,5.0,,Both the quantity and quality are amazing. I managed to take hundreds of photos of orchid flowers; the place didn't seem crowded and the entrance fees were reasonable.

,,Great variety,5.0,,What a really great garden this is if you visit the Botanical gardens which is free then this is well worth paying to enter the Orchid Garden
,,Awesome,5.0,,Was totally lost from the present world and been in a great place I thought paradise. Weather was the only issue to see the beautiful place as it was raining.
,,Do not miss it!,5.0,,"Based on the reviews of Tripadvisor, I selected this garden to visit. And indeed, an excellent choice. The entry fee of 5 SD is value for money. The garden is lovely and well maintained. Make sure not to miss the Cool House and the Mist House. The walk for wheel chairs gives you a nice overview of the entire garden and takes approximately two hours. Make sure you take sufficient water with you, as you can only buy it when enteting the garden. If you like buying the orchids, you can buy them in the souvenirshop at the exit. And at last, I did not mention the flowers yet, but they are just awesome! I made almost 100 pictures....Enjoy!"
,,"A ""must"" go",5.0,,So beautifully kept.Stunning displays of Orchids.We would liked to have had longer here but we were on an organised trip.The gift shop is also worth looking around.
,,Loved this Garden,5.0,,"I admittedly love flowers...and a visit to a garden in Singapore was a nice refresher from all of the retail. This garden is fabulous.

,,Simply Wow !!,5.0,,"Although our visit was during mid May, with the weather being extremely humid & quite hot, the visit to this lovely place was worth every minute spend & yard walked.

The garden is really vast but extremely well maintained & you can spend hours & hours here. Both the Orchid garden as well as the Botanical park are lovely & beautiful, i feel a must for any nature lover, who visits Singapore.

The best part was the mist garden, it gave you a feel of being in some hilly area with the mist all around.

My special praise to the team in-charge of this lovely place. The care they have given to each minutest detail."
,,Orchids galore!,4.0,,"The orchids were really pretty and you will be surprised of the wide variety of orchids they have in Singapore. I discovered species that I never knew existed before.

,,Awesome exhibit inside the botanical gardens,5.0,,This was a surprise for us as we just went to visit the botanical gardens. The displays inside here are something you have to see $5.00 for adults but if you are like my wife and I 60+ it is only $1:00. There were many displays and we spent about an hour inside this part of the Botanical gardens. I would suggest you allow plenty of time too as there is so much to see.

,,One of the best Orchid gardens,5.0,,This is one of the best orchid gardens I have ever visited. I go there every time I go to Singapore. It has a wide variety of orchids.
,,Stunning display,5.0,,"Orchids are Singapore's national flower and nowhere are they better displayed than in this extensive garden. Orchids of all colours and sizes, sometimes set out like bedding plants! Watch out for the one named after Margaret Thatcher - it really is twisted and spiky!
It's just $5 entry ($1 for us old folk) and well worth it, especially as the surrounding Botanic Gardens are free."
,,So good it was almost overwhelming,5.0,,This is a pay extra option within the Singapore botanic gardens but well worth the money. It was a bit busy when we visited but I think that was because of Chinese New Year. The variety and sheer beauty of the orchids on show was breathtaking but there are a lot and you can become almost blase to them eventually! What's particularly nice is that they grow them in such a natural way - in other words much as you would see them 'in the wild'.
,,A must for gardeners,5.0,,"Stunning variety of orchids, beautifully presented. So glad we went. There is also a VIP orchid section with orchids named after famous people."
,,Breathtakingly beautiful,4.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is set within Singapore's Botanic Gardens which provide an excellent family day out. The varieties of orchid set along the winding paths were stunning, and taking along your camera is a must. Various eateries were dotted about the Botanic Gardens, including Halia restaurant which offers a Sunday brunch and afternoon tea which looked fantastic. Try the sangria, but don't drive anywhere afterwards! All in all, the National Orchid Garden was definitely worth the $5.00 to get in and is not to be missed!"
,,Nice but not extremely Impressive,3.0,,Perhaps it wasn't the season for the orchids to be in full bloom but there wasn't as many as we thought there would be. The ones that were in bloom were beautiful but it felt a little scarce. We will have to check it out at some other time of the year but it is a nice and peaceful stroll. May favourite area was the orchids that were planted and named after famous visitors.
,,A Must See!!,5.0,,"As avid gardeners my wife and I were anticipating our visit and were not disappointed. We took the MRT from the cruise port (Harbour Front Stn) to the Botanic Gardens Station and walked about 20 minutes through those wonderful gardens to the Orchid Garden ($5 admission). The orchids are the product of the Botanic Garden's Orchid breeding programme which began in 1928. There are over 1,000 species and 2,000 hybrids in the collection. This is the largest display of orchids in the world and is a must see if you are in Singapore. Look for the Celebrity Orchid Garden display where new hybrids are named to commemorate the visit of celebrities. See the orchid's named after Princess Diane, Andria Bocelli, Jackie Chan, etc. We left the Botanic Gardens by bus from Napier Road (Tanglin Gate)."
,,Superb - must do in Singapore,5.0,,"Unless you are blind, go here. Amazing flowers, beautiful setting and one of the best things in Singapore. I go every time I am in town (partly because I love orchids). DONT MISS THIS."
,,A great way to spend a half day or more,5.0,,"Thoroughly enjoyed wandering around the gardens and the orchid garden in particular.
Beautifully laid out and maintained, the gardens were an absolute delight. I can only imagine how brilliant it must be at the height of flowering.

We could have easily spent more time I the gardens proper but managed to see enough in the three hours we spent here. A great place to visit."
,,Barren by the rains,3.0,,"It is most unfortunate that the time of my visit coincided with heavy rainfall which left the Orchid Garden barren. As an orchid lover, this proved rather dissapointing. However the ambience itself of the garden is tranquil and provided a pleasant break from the abundance of shopping malls. The little gift shop does sell quaint pieces worth buying as souveniers to take back home. You can walk through to the Botanic Garden where you can have a relaxing break on the green lawns. The taxi facility is amazing...there is a phone connected to the taxi stand and you can call a taxi to pick you up literally at the press of a single button. I am eager to return for a visit when there are no rains."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,The orchid garden is inside the botanical garden. It was fantastic! I could have spent a week here! The wide array of orchids was mind boggling. My camera actually overheated!
,,ORCHIDS,5.0,,"Wonderful! The National Orchid Garden is not crowded, and easy to navigate. There were many people having picnics and walking their dogs. It had a very local feel. The orchids are breathtaking. I enjoyed immensely."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is a must when you are in Singapore. You don't even have to be a gardener or particularly fond of orchids. The colors and varieties are simply stunning. Located within the Botanic Gardens it is easy to reach and well worth the $5 entry. It is very big and does have some slopes to negotiate, but there are shady gazebos where you can take a rest. The Orchid Garden gift shop is very pricy. We found similar silk items at a fraction of the cost in Chinatown."
,,well laid out & maintained,5.0,,The layout of the garden was perfect. Many benches to sit down on and reflect or just take in all the beauty. The cool house was heavenly. I'm from the northern USA & not accustomed to the high heat temperature.
,,Must see,4.0,,I am not into museum/garden attraction but did enjoy this place much. Took a lot of pictures which i would share soon. Must see attraction in Singapore.
,,Orchid heaven,4.0,,Beautiful and extensive display of orchids of all sizes shapes and colours; fabulous for the enthusiasts. Not for everybody though...!
,,A riot of colour,4.0,,In the Botanical Gardens and a large choice of orchids to savour. So many colours and patterns to assault the eye.
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,The orchids are beautiful and more varieties than you can shake a stick at! Well worth the $5 entry fee.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"We love gardening and in perticular Orchids, to use it is a must, if a little hard on the feet. Could do with someting like gollf buggies to transport people around, its a lot bigger than we thought."
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,"I really enjoyed wandering around the Orchid Gardens. They were beautiful! However, remember to bring sunscreen!"
,,Orchid heaven,5.0,,A must visit and don't forget your camera. Mostly outside but good shade and some air conditioned areas
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Picture perfect photo spots. Really beautiful garden. Be sure to wear a hat and apply lots of sunscreen
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Very pretty, lots to see but we didn't have long there so didn't see all! Water features were lovely. Must allow plenty of time for gardens."
,,Fantastic example of modern garden display,5.0,,"The Garden is located within the Botanical Gardens which are currently being nominated for World Heritage Listing.

There is a small entry for the Orchid garden which accepts overseas seniors cards to reduce the cost or even your passport with birthday date. Access is OK but the paths are steep so if you have mobility issues you should plan a little extra time. There are plenty of places to stop and rest under shelter.

I would suggest planning to spend 30 minutes to 1 hour to see the Gardens properly as they cover a large area with an immense display of orchids of many different varieties as well as interesting information on growing and development.

There are many photo opportunites for the serious orchid lover as well as the person merely interested in a beautiful garden."
,,Just awesome....,4.0,,"I was there last weekend with my girlfriend, Really an amazing experience, colors, scents emotion ... simply indescribable. You will not regret"
,,If you have a free hour....,5.0,,"Well worth the 5 dollar entry. Beautiful manicured lawns, amazing orchids, peaceful and tranquil. Our time in Singapore was limited, so this was a great combination with the botanical gardens (seperate review)."

,,Tranquility,4.0,,Beautiful area to wander at your leisure with areas to sit in the shade and cool down. Opens up into a large park to walk through. Worth a visit away from the hustle and bustle of the city
,,Lovely garden with full of flower,5.0,,"It is one of the best place to enjoy the nature. Only with $5, you are exposed to the kingdom of orchids and other plants. Orchids have many colors and many species as you know, but only one of them is the national flower of Singapore - a very long scientific name, purple and white flower. There are many photograph spots full of flowers. This place is even recommended for wedding photos, we saw a few couples there. It is great to spend half a day there to get close to the nature and discover the beauty of orchids.
I suggest you should go there by taxi. If you try MRT train and stop at Botanic Garden Station, you have to walk very far to get to the orchid garden, and strongly not recommend for old people."
,,Absolute beauty,5.0,,"This is a real treat. Orchids abound in a beautifully maintained garden including a (very welcome) cool house for carnivorous plants. A part of the larger Botanic Gardens, easy to get to and well laid out, this should be a must do on a Singapore visit."
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"Lovely place. The flowers are beautiful and the whole garden is a great place to spend your morning. There are people jogging, walking about and sitting in the sunshine. The orchids are beautiful and you should make time to go see them."
,,An Orchid lovers delight,5.0,,"Absolutely beautiful if you like Orchids, which I do, but the gardens are well planted with other interesting plants and features"
,,Beautiful Orchids,5.0,,"Lovely flowers, lovely grounds and an excellent gift shop. Singapore is off course hot and steamy, take drinking water with you and possibly some form of shade. I also loved the words of remembrance for Mrs Thatcher alongside an orchid that carries her name"
,,Truly Amazing!,5.0,,"The most stunning gardens I have ever been to ! Not to be missed truly amazing!!! The clours were breathtaking, it was so peacful, not a thing out of place - I loved it
It was very easy to get to by public transport and the walk through the botanical gardens was really nice, all the different varieties of trees , the water features and the most mazing Koi carp that i have ever seen - it has to be right at the top of your things to do list for Singapore!!! Enjoy!!!"
,,Impressive,5.0,,"What a day, it is a lovely experience to enjoy a day with flowers and nature. the garden is designed for different photo location so make sure you capture them"
,,Simply amazing display of orchids,5.0,,"Wow. This is part of the Botanic Gardens and there is a small $5 fee to enter this exhibit, but so worth it. I have never seen so many different types of orchids. All beautiful and very well taken care of. Do not skip this if you have a chance to get to the Botanic Gardens."
,,Orchid garden.,5.0,,Well worth a visit even if you do not have green fingers. There are drinking water fountains which in the Singapore heat/humidity are welcome.
,,National Orchid Garden,5.0,,Our visit to the National Orchid Garden was part of a half day city tour. It was the highlight of the tour. The gardens and the landscaping were breathtaking. The birds were the best we saw in Southeast Asia. The only problem was we didn't have the time to do it justice. Come in the morning and stay for the day!
,,Totally worth the visit,5.0,,Love the range of orchids. We spent two hours only seeing the orchids. You could spend a lot more time visiting the garden. Suggest you go early in the day or outside of the bus tours.
,,Colour everywhere,4.0,,Lots of spots to stop to cool down and relax and take in the true beauty of these colourful well set out gardens.
,,Stunning,5.0,,This is the most beautiful and well kept garden I have seen with a small fee of $5 entry. It is part of the botanical gardens which has many themes and a few restaurants. It is a stop on the hop on off bus.
,,Stunning,5.0,,Well worth a vist. I doubt that you would ever see a better display of orchids of all types anywhere else.
,,Happy,5.0,,The colorful and amazing variaty of orchis blow my expectations the well manicure garden and peculiar flora make feel worth it to be there eventhought the extreme heat in that day.
,,Best orchids I've ever seen,5.0,,My wife is nuts about orchids and so she took me along to the orchid garden to show me. I was blown away at the huge selection and varieties on display. If you like flowers you simply must make time to visit!
,,world orchid,5.0,,"I like being in the orchid world, yeah that's what I feel, a garden that represents almost all species of orchids. A beauty! I will never be tired of seeing it! Always marvelous flowers. The place has a very good maintenance and the price is ok, only 5 dollars. The merchandising at the shop is not the best, but the important are the orchids"
,,Amazing,4.0,,Stunning range of species a delightful venue.quite small compared to the whole gardens. Guy from londons kew gardens now in charge and is loving it
,,Sensational gardens,5.0,,"Orchids were lovely and worth admission - rest of gardens also high quality. painfully hot outdoors, but thats Singapore"
,,Great day out,5.0,,"Great day out and some beautiful flowers, gardens and orchids. It's a great place to spend a lazy day in the sun walking around. Cafe on site and it's nice a quiet if you need a quiet day. Collection of orchids is also great and there are some beautiful flower arrangements."
,,Beautiful Displays,5.0,,"The layout and ease of access to this beautiful Orchid Garden made the whole experience one of delight. Attached to the Botanical Gardens, there is an entrance fee but it is well worth the price."
,,Great orchid garden,5.0,,A fantastic collection of orchids. Not only that but the rest of the gardens are great too. A wonderful place to spend a lazy afternoon.
,,For Orchid lovers,5.0,,"A short bus trip from Marina bay will take you to the National Orchid Gardens and it's a trip worth taking.
I have never seen so many plants growing in their own natural enviroment, it is a must for Orchid lovers and they even have a brown one!
It's a place to spend a day in. A note to mention is that it is on a hill and this means that you are up and down a lot.
As Singapore is a tropical location, you would be advised also to take a light mac or coat, when it rains it rains!"
,,A highlight of Singapore,5.0,,The Orchid Garden is an oasis of peace and quiet in the center of Singapore. The best thing is to get there at 08:30 as it opens. Alos note seniors ge a discount on production of your passport!
,,Colour and Character,5.0,,"A must do in Singapore. The gardens are beautifully laid out, easy to access and a wonder to behold. If time had permitted we could have spent another few hours marvelling at the myriad of orchids on display. A must do in Singapore"
,,"In one word - ""WOW""",5.0,,"I absolutely love orchids and this garden showcased them by theme and was huge. The grounds are gorgeous with lovely fountains and statues everywhere. It is a bit of a hike through the Botanical Gardens and then around the orchid gardens. Bring water and an umbrella, as it is hot. Seniors (60+) were only $1. Bargain of Singapore!!!"
,,orchids everywhere..,4.0,,"very much amaze of the orchids of different colors, variety& sizes. there's a minimal entrance. one should not miss the green house."
,,Great for flora lovers,5.0,,"This garden is well situated as you can easily get an mrt which drops you around 750m away from it. Then enjoying the scenic beauties, flanked with magnificient pathways and wonderful lakes, full of swans, you can easily reach the garden in around 12-13 mins. The garden is the ultimate paradise for orchid lovers but the worst place for non lovers, as you'd totally get bored. So, if you love orchids and waterfalls and lily pads..... it is a must see for you"
,,Always amazing,4.0,,"A beauty! I will never be tired of seeing it! Always marvelous flowers. The place has a very good maintenance and the price is ok, only 5 dollars. The merchandising at the shop is not the best, but the important are the orchids"

,,Jaw dropping beauty,5.0,,This garden is well worth the entrance fee. It holds some of the most beautiful orchid specimens in the world and should not be missed.
,,Do not expect much and you'll be fine,4.0,,There are only 2 places in this huge garden that worth praise: the coolhouse with mountain rainforest and a place with giant orchids nearby. The rest of the garden is filled with 2-3 species of orchids mostly planted in pots!
,,Beautiful.,5.0,,"The size, the beautiful Orchids everywhere.how they have been grown, even my husband not a flower person enjoyed it. great gift shop. Took loads of pictures."
,,A feast of colour,5.0,,"So much colour on display in this garden which is part of the larger botanical garden. It's not just a case of a few blooms, there are just huge clouds of colour everywhere. Makes a visit to the Eden Project abit dreary."
,,One of the highlights of our trip,5.0,,These gardens are beautiful. It is part of the Botanic Gardens of Singapore. All types of tropical plants but the orchids where unforgettable.
,,Stunning Orchid Garden,5.0,,"I spent the most wonderful hour strolling around the National Orchid Garden at the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The orchids where stunning and the air was filled with their perfume.
One little criticism is the lack of signposting to find the entrance to the Botanic Gardens if you are walking along Tanglin Road, I missed what later I found to be the road that would lead me to the entrance. It is also quite a walk uphill from the Tanglin gate, be prepared."
,,"If you like orchids, this place is a must",5.0,,A great place to see an incredible variety of orchids in a beautiful setting. I visit every time I come to Singapore. Entry fee is only 5 Singapore Dollars! What a deal!
,,Impressive collection of plants and flowers,5.0,,WOW! What a collection of beautiful flowers and plants! Very impressive and a wonderful way to spend the day for a nice walk in the park!
,,A gem,5.0,,"Simply stunning display, beautifully presented and explained. Also, a welcome relief from the heat when you're walking around the botanic gardens. If you're 60 and over, make sure you have your seniors' card. We paid only $1. It's hard to imagine such a display anywhere else."
,,great variety of orchids,5.0,,"This garden is well laid out, with various houses/areas to visit. Small entrance fee, closes at 7pm, earlier than main garden. Some amazing varieties of plants and fabulous photo opportunities."
,,Very pretty and well-organised,5.0,,You will love this garden no matter whether you are into nature or gardening or flowers. It is one of the best kept gardens I have been to and I have been to a few including Australia and the US. A refreshing afternoon walk at this place is highly recommended.
,,Nice.,5.0,,"I'm no gardener, but this was beautiful and elegant, and only an extra $5, after free entry to the overall Botanical Garden in which they're set. A quiet, if hot, calm place to stroll after the bustle of the city."
,,National Orchid Garden,4.0,,If you are at Singapore Botanic Garden you definitly must have a look to the National Orchid Garden. It-s an 1 hour visit with an incredible variety of flowers and its a great experience. For photographers you can envoy the colorful flowers for great pictures
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"Superb colours in an endless variety of flowers. Flowers well laid out with explanatory notes and descriptions. Even if flowers are not your thing, this is a superb experience. Take your camera!"
,,Absolutly fantastic,5.0,,"Actually, I haven't been to many Orchid gardens in my life.
But this one was incredible. So many different orchids, it was very impressive.
It is quite a walk from the Metro station to the Orchid garden, going through the botanical garden, but it's worth the walk.
The botanic garden itself is free and it resembles more a park in other big cities than an actual botanical garden.
Nevertheless, the Orchids made up for everything.

There is a small entrance fee to enter this part, but for us, it was worth the money.
Make sure you bring enough water, we had a very hot day and there are not too many places you can cool down."
,,Greatest collection of orchids ever seen.,5.0,,A must see if you're into flowers and gardens and we bought a really inexpensive chime from the shop which would have cost us 4 times the price in Australia.
,,Heaven for anyone who loves gardens,5.0,,"Beautiful winding pathways crammed with fabulous flowers of every colour imaginable! Misting gardens, waterfalls fantastic rockeries. Many orchids have been named for famous people. It is a ""must see"" destination for anyone going to Singapore."
,,One of my favourite places in the world,5.0,,This is my second visit to the National Orchid Gardens. It is simply one of the most beautiful places in the world. The orchids named after famous people is quite fascinating. This is really a must see when you visit Singapore
,,National Orchid Garden - World Class!,5.0,,"If you have interest in orchids, you should plan a visit to the National Orchid Garden (SG$5 per adults) when visiting Singapore. Here you can see the largest display of tropical orchids in the world. This is a wonderful opportunity to see a wide variety of orchids, seems they have over 1000 species being grown here.

We very much enjoy visits to the National Orchid Garden, appreciating the well-maintained grounds and sheer number of orchids available to seen here. You can easily spend a hour or two here before or after visiting the rest of the very good Singapore Botanic Gardens, where you find the National Orchid Garden. There is a gift shop here as well as clean toilet facilities and restaurants as well.

Overall, this is just an excellent attraction, a place we always have quite high on our list of things to do when we visit Singapore. Its easy to understand why the National Orchid Garden is one of the most popular individual attractions in the city.

Tip: The Singapore Botanic Garden grounds open at 5am but the Orchid Garden does not open until 8.30am so plan accordingly if you are intending a morning visit, which is recommendable if you wish to avoid the relentless heat that you can encounter during the midday time periods in Singapore.

Tip: If you like flora and botanic attractions, make time for the recently opened Gardens by the Bay attraction at Marina Bay as well. More orchids and a varied collection of other flora are on display in the large conservatory domes there."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"This is a great place to visit if you are interested in flowers at all. There is a small entrance charge, but it is worth it. In one part of the garden, it has orchids named for famous visitors to the garden which gave it an interesting aspect."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Hadn't realised there were so many different kinds of orchids! Enjoyed looking at the celebrity garden - interesting names to flowers!
,,Beautiful flowers,4.0,,You would expect nothing less seeing as the Orchid holds a special place for Singaporeans. Who knew that orchids came in so many shapes and colours?
,,Botanical Gardens,4.0,,Well worth the walk. Very well named orchids and planting schemes especially the arches of orchids are very good. Well organised taxis at exit.
,,Good value for money,4.0,,Allow plenty of time to really appreciate this beautiful garden. 30 mins on a tour is insufficient time
,,Massive park.,5.0,,Massive park. Lovely flowers and a welcome break from the city. It is one of the drop-off stations on the tourist bus. Well worth a visit.
,,"Hot and steamy, but some fabulous Orchids",4.0,,Well tended plants which looked healthy and well cared for. Great sculpture and beautiful examples of orchids. Clean restaurant and good gift shop.
,,Orchids!,5.0,,"Visited this garden on an organised city tour.....we did not rejoin the bus but stayed for three hours and got a r
taxi back to our hotel (time alloted by bus was 25 minutes!!)
This is a fabulous place. The gardens are well laid out with lots of varieties of orchids and many other plants. Heaven!
There is a restaurant where we had a lovley lunch at a reasonable cost and staff were kind, efficient and very helpful.
Visiting here is a must when in Singapore but make sure you give yourselves plenty of time to wander around and take in the beauty of it all."
,,Visually spectacular but dull after a while,3.0,,"Compared to Eden project in the UK it was weak. Yes, it was stunning to look at but lacked the variety of plants, the themed areas and the information to captivate the attention fully."
,,Absolutely beautiful!,5.0,,"This was our first stop in Singapore and it got the trip kicked off on the right foot. The orchid garden is wonderful. It had some rare orchids that I had never seen. I am not a super flower person, but I loved this. Definitely a must in Singapore"
,,The orchids are wonderful.,5.0,,"The range of flowers on display is awesome. The colours and range of plants on display are postcarderfect. I suggest that you take insect repellent, as there are lots of mosquitoes."

,,Fantastic,5.0,,"This is the only part of the botanic gardens to make a charge, $5 or $1 for concessions, well worth the fee, the collection is amazing allow a good 90mins to get around and to tke the many photos you will no doubt want to take, top tip, the cool house can be a welcome break from the heat and humidity."
,,Delightful!,5.0,,I had so wanted to visit the Orchid Gardens and I was not disappointed. The gardens was accessible for wheelchairs with a special designated route. The paths were even but a bit steep in parts but my companion agreed that it was well worth the effort. I was not aware that so many orchids existed in so many colours and here they were in a beautiful setting. Well worth a visit when attending the Botanical Gardens. Much needed shelter also available from the sun.
,,Possibly...,5.0,,"...the most beautiful place in the world! We only had an hour or so here, as part of our city tour, but I'm so glad we visited. Having spent 3wks in Australia and visited several botanical gardens there, I was a bit ""garden-ed out"" but this was unlike any of the others...a sumptuous jungle of colour and texture, words can't do it justice. Just go and see for yourself!"
,,For the flower lovers,5.0,,Better than I remenber from 20 plus years ago. Never knew so many colours existed and so well laid out all for the cost of 1 dollar for a senior
,,Orchids were magnificent,5.0,,I would have loved to spend more time there amongst the beautiful flowers. The gardens were so well maintained and there were so many colours & varyities of orchids.
,,Beautiful Garden,5.0,,"This Garden is more than just flowers it is full of colour and love, one of the most beautiful Gardens i have ever seen."
,,A great walk for your visitors: beautiful and tranquil,5.0,,"Even if flowers aren't their thing, this is a must-see for visitors. Myriad orchid varieties (with many other plants and flowers) along the way to the summit, occupied by a museum-like building and formal gardens containing orchid species named after visiting dignitaries, and on a hot day, the Cool House is a welcome respite from our climate. They'll never forget it!"
,,Lovely,5.0,,"It's been a few years since I've been here, but it was lovely. Truly one of the highlights of Singapore.
The paths are filled with greenery, and of course orchids or an unimaginable variety.
And the cafe in the garden is a great place to stop for a coffee, or ice cream."
,,Must see for first timers in Singapore,4.0,,"Beautiful collection of Orchids. Mesmerising experience especially the first time of being there. Walk around the garden can be a bit uphill and tiring for elders, but if that's not a problem I recommend this for everyone visiting Singapore"
,,Makes you want to be a gardener,5.0,,The National orchid garden was gorgeous - There was however a lot of walking and since Singapore is in the tropics -it was very HOT in March. There was a restaurant that was actually in the gardens that was a beautiful sit down restaurant. I have forgotten the name but it was like eating in a tropical paradise. Both the service and food were wonderful. I would have liked to stay there all day.
,,State National Flower,4.0,,A small area but jammed with different types of orchids and butterflies. Reminded me of my own garden when I lived in Hawaii.
,,Fantastic orchids,5.0,,The botanical gardens are wonderful but the highlight had to be orchid garden--definitely worth the small admission fee to see so many different kinds of orchids.
,,"Absolute beauty, best orchids in the world",5.0,,"This is a beautiful tropical Orchid garden among the pristine surroundings of the Singapore Botanic gardens. No wonder this is the top most attraction in Singapore. A must visit place for any flower lover.

There is a small fee of $5 to enter and it's totally worth it. I have lost count of the types of orchids I've seen. It's unbelievable! The garden is well maintained, but that is an understatement. It is simply superb!!!"
,,Good but not must see,3.0,,"We visited the National Orchid Garden as it was rated No. 1 attraction in Singapore on Trip Advisor. I'm not quite sure how it achieved this ranking but never mind. If you want awesome, visit Gardens by the Bay instead.We went on a very humid day and it wasn't the nicest place to choose to be but the Cool House was a great temperature! The Orchid Garden is in the Botanical Gardens which I found very disappointing - they are so plain, green and manicured, you could be anywhere in the world. I'd advise a visit to both gardens if you have time to kill, otherwise flag it and go see other places instead. Approx $4 cab ride from Orchard Road."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Wonderful tropical plants set within the Botanical Gardens. Be prepared to walk a good distance if you go on the Metro as it is around a mile to walk. It is a must if you visit Singapore.
,,For flower lovers,5.0,,"If you are an oversea travels and love flowers a lot, you should visit this garden with lots of special species which you did not see before. However, you may get bore when you realize the whole garden only with Orchids."
,,Good but not great,3.0,,"My girlfriend is really interested in orchids and she couldnt wait to visit here. It was well worth the $5 entrance fee and there were lots and lots of orchids but not much information. The cool house is pretty amazing, although nothing was flowering inside when we visited"
,,Do not miss this place of absolute beauty ...,5.0,,"This is a place to go crazy with the camera. We were dazzled with the vibrancy, and every colour of orchid. A little walk into the Orchid's through the equally stunning botanic gardens, and you will arrive at the doorstep. You will need your walking shoes, camera, hat and water, but you wont be disappointed."
,,must see if got time,4.0,,"variety of flowers , specially orchids , spread over few acres of land this give piece and tranquility just next to busy orchid road"
,,T1/2 Day tour,5.0,,It was very beautiful except it was extremely humid the day I went. Make sure you carry water and have plenty of time and film in your camera

,,Overwhelmning,5.0,,"We visited the garden first thing in the morning to avoid the afternoon heat and rain as well as tour crowds. Although we spent a few hours, we did not complete the entire garden. The items in the gift shop were of the finest quality and some are available at the airport as well. Should have scheduled an entire day!! Highly recommend this attraction."
,,Wow!,5.0,,I grow orchids as a hobby in Florida. I was blown away by the number and variety of orchids on display.
,,Peaceful escape from the busy city,5.0,,"The botanical gardens as a whole are massive, a very nice place to escape the hussle and bussle of the busy city. Its worth paying the small entrance fee for the Orchid gardens, there are even a couple of cool houses to chill out on a hot day.

The food in the main botanic gardens cafe was quite expensive so if you are on a budget eat before or after visiting."
,,A nice place to visit if you like Orchids,4.0,,"This place is inside the Botanical Gardens. We caught a taxi to the Botanical Gardens as the MTR (underground) station is quite a walk from the Orchid Gardens and my Mum needs a stick to help her walk.

The Botanical Gardens are free to go around. You have to pay for entry to the Orchid Gardens. There are many, many, many orchids. Probably a little too many. After an hour I had seen too many!!

I would have preferred a little more information about each, in writing, next to them, so I understood a little more about them i.e. what part of the world are they native too? How high do they grow? What other variants are there? Etc

Overall though a nice place to visit"
,,Incredible collection,5.0,,You will be amazed by the diversity and number of different orchids on display. Make sure you allow at least an hour to view the collection at leisure
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"We went to the garden on our last day of stay in Singapore. Beautiful flowers. If you are coming from Rendezvous Grand Hotel, take the no 7, 77 or 107 bus just outside YMCA building and this will take you directly to the garden. A must see!!"
,,Must see,5.0,,"I loved this park!, entrance fee is only 5 s$ ! I liked it more than gardens by the bay! You can find numerous beatiful orchids in the park! Beware that this is a open area, so check the whether before you go!"
,,Best few dollars spent,5.0,,"The Botanical Gardens are free and to see the Orchid collection was just a few dollars,wonderfull gardens,everywhere immaculate we spent 5hours walking round and enjoyed every minute,if you have a spare 2 hours go see!"
,,must do,5.0,,"If you love orchids you must go, I can't begin to describe the beauty, the colours, the peacefulness, it is set just off the madness that is Orchard Road but you could be a million miles away"
,,A must see for Orchid Lovers,4.0,,"I recently took my mother to the Orchid Gardens as she is an avid Orchid lover, and she was impressed. There is a small entry fee, which I didn't expect, but it was worth it to see my mum enjoy the varieties and beautiful colours of these flowers. I am not a green thumb at all, but I was also impressed by the range and amazing colours of these flowers. It does get hot here so go early in the day or when it is overcast."
,,Beautiful!!,5.0,,"This was an amazing place, absolutely gorgeous orchids. Take your time meandering around all the different varieties, we loved it. A place not to be missed."
,,Definitely a highlite of the visit,5.0,,"The Orchid garden is amusing and fresh, with history of the plants and connection to Singapore well described. Make the time for it, even on a short visit."
,,Nothing special really,2.0,,"It is not a must see, I don't know why it's first of to do list in TA. Nothing special really, it's like Singapore streets with more flowers. Maybe interesting for scientists but going there in a hot day in March is not recommended as it's not something spectacular."
,,Flower Power,5.0,,I do not consider myself a flower person but this was a excellent value for the money! Very well done as is the botanic garden surrounding the Orchid garden. Well worth the time and one of the bargains of Singapore.
,,"Beautiful, def worth the visit!",5.0,,"This is indeed a must-visit for anyone making a trip to Singapore, whether a short stay or a stretched one.

Since this is within the Singapore Botanic Garden, suggest you do both together. Recommend that you do this early morning to avoid any the heat which can starts off post-noon and can be disturbing if it the sky is too clear.

90 minutes would do justice, and if you have kids, it would be infotainment for them. Also a delight for photographers.

Suggest to carry water and wear comfortable clothing and shoes as it involves walk-arounds.

Avoid if you lack interest in flower / plantations, as it might not interest you much.

Transportation is through MRT, which is a bit far off, but you may use the public buses, which drop you off about 50 meters from the Botanic Garden Entrance. Also, most routes of the hop-on-hop-off buses have this on their schedule, but I wouldn't recommend you combine it with this, as there are other places to see on the bus tour, and you can surely do this separately."
,,See Princess Diana's Orchid,5.0,,A fabulous venue for horticulturalists. There is a fee but concessions get in for $1. The display shows all the VIP orchids
,,Nice place,4.0,,"Lovely flowers. Nice botanic garden setting, good way to while away an hour as part of visit to botanic gardens"
,,Delightful,5.0,,"Visit early or late to avoid the worst of the heat. A truly amazing number of orchids in a natural setting, a stroll through the gardens can take as little as one hour but take your time if you can. Good cafe and tasty food."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"We were on a city tour, stopping for a short time at the Botanic Gardens. We left the tour and stayed in the gardens for 3 hours, spending most of our time in the Orchid Garden which was just beautiful. So worth taking time to wander amongst so many different varieties of orchid with amazing colours. There are plenty of places to sit and just admire these beautiful flowers."
,,Unbelievably beautiful,5.0,,Get your camera ready. Take more pictures then you can believe of the most exquisite flowers. Close your jaw so the flies don't get in.
,,Beautiful garden - worth the visit,5.0,,"We went to the Orchid Garden on the 15th of March - got there via the MRT system. Of course, it is a good distance to walk from the MRT station to the Orchid Garden especially in the summer heat but one look at the orchids and we were taken in by their beauty. There are a huge number of orchids, very well maintained and the landscaping done is excellent. Well worth the visit and definitely one of the places to visit when in Singapore!"
,,A beautiful experience,5.0,,We managed to find our way here on the bus - an experience in itself. Well worth the effort!!! Gorgeous and surprising number of different varieties - plenty of places to sit and take in the views and delight in our surroundings.
,,A beautiful place to visit,5.0,,"If you like flowers, vibrant colour and tropical gardens this is the place to visit. Amazing! It is only a short taxi ride on the outskirts of the city. (taxis are very reasonable in Singapore) Well worth a visit."
,,Not to be missed.,5.0,,A riot of color and shapes.Take a taxi which are plentiful cheap and honest and don't bother with organised tours. Allow at least an hour for the orchids and a half a day for the whole botanic gardens.Take plenty of water and drink lots!!
,,beautiful orchids,3.0,,"good place to take a walk and see various ,beautiful orchids.This is good to see if you are boring with shopping area.....:)"
,,Nice garden in the city,4.0,,"Located within the Singapore Botanical Garden which is easily accessible by bus. Quite many colourful orchids. Not as pretty as those in Gardens by the Bay but still worth the money. Beware of the heat, most of the plants are not inside the cool-house. There is a souvenir shop so you may do some shopping."
,,Beautiful Orchids,4.0,,Small entry fee well worth a visit. It is in the middle of the Botanic gardens which are free. Beautiful orchids and so many varieties. Go early in the morning when it's cooler. Very peaceful place in the middle of Singapore.
,,Beautiful Flowers,5.0,,Great place to go witness the Singapore people and see beautiful flowers. Most is free but costs to go see the flower gardens.
,,"Beautiful Gardens, not to be missed",5.0,,"Also had lunch there at the restaurant. Enjoying the healing garden but not so easy to find even with a map! We also met another lost person there, they need better signage."
,,National Orchid Garden in Botanic Gardens of Singapore,5.0,,National Orchid Gardens is located in and is part of Singapore Botanic Gardens. The entry to the Botanic garden is free but there is a fee of Sing 5 Dollars for National Orchid Garden. Its worth paying variety of Flowers with one fully covered AC area giving a feel of real jungle walk
,,Orchids galore in March,5.0,,What's not to like. You need the best part of a day starting as early as you can due to heat etc. $5 entrance per adult - great value for sure.
,,Fabulous Orchid Collection,5.0,,"Multi levels include a cool house for tropical mountain orchids, a mist house for wet-loving varieties, a bromeliad collection. The whole thing is magnificent. I've been twice; can't miss it."
,,Worth the entry fee,5.0,,"A beautiful must see. We adored the botanical garden, but loved the orchid garden. There were fantastic displays of every variety of orchid imaginable. We particularly enjoyed the cool house, with misters and air conditioning."
,,So So,3.0,,I was a little disappointed with the garden there was to wow factor. There were beautiful blooms where ever you looked but it didn't catch my imagination.
,,A must do!,5.0,,If you enter the Singapore Botanic Gardens then you must visit the National Orchid Garden. The flowers are well marked and beautifully laid out. There is even a cold house for a short break from the heat.
,,Well...,3.0,,"I wouldn't say it's not a great place to be, but the Botanic Garden is just as good - why would I pay 5$ for an extended area of the Botanic Garden with a lot of Orchids?
Maybe I just don't love/know flowers enough, I don't know.
It's beautiful there, that's out of the question - but it didn't really strike me as special.

Just try to be there around 4pm, if you want to go, as most of the touristy-crowd will be gone by then :)"
,,Pinch yourself! You ARE on earth!,5.0,,"The numerous species of orchids, the natural settings, the archways of tiny yellow orchids, the splendid sensations of seeing such incredible beauty in one space is unbelievable. Bring a macro lens or camera suitable to take detailed photos of flowers. Oh, and don't touch!"
,,Orchid with no/little Orchid,2.0,,Nothing special in the whole garden. We paid for entering this garden to enjoy the orchids but very little orchids we've seen. It is like a fake and nothing there to waste your time.
,,Wonderful Oasis,5.0,,"We loved the National Orchid garden. It was just the place to relax on our last day in Singapore. Wonderful for photography, but just for experiencing as well. I would say it's a must see in Singapore."
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,The Orchid garden is breathtaking. I love Orchids and could not believe the number of varieties - all of them stunning. The battery in my camera ran out as I took so many pictures ! small entry fee of $5 but well worth it :)
,,If you love flowers this is a must!,5.0,,This garden is well worth the visit and the small entry fee. I particularly love flower photography and so I was in heaven. The cool-room was a nice change from the extreme heat but was not big enough! Was so great to see so many perfect orchids in one place and the information of how they are created etc was great too. Would happily visit again.
,,amazing,5.0,,"I have never seen so many varieties of Orchids in my life especially not in one place. The gardens are amazing, beautifully kept and displayed each area shines with the pride of the people who care for these stunning flowers."
,,So many Orchids !,4.0,,"While this was no surprise, there was far more varieties of orchids than I expected. If you've been to Singapore before and seen the major attractions, this is a great one to see as a secondary attraction, or if you particularly like flowers"
,,A Must See in the Botanical Garden,5.0,,The entire botanical garden as well as the National Orchid Garden were absolutely beautiful. This is a great place to exercise and see amazing flowers and plant life.
,,The largest collection of orchids I've seen in one place,5.0,,"Beautiful... a must see if you love orchids or flowers in general. Try and give yourself some time here, there's so much to look at that you'll upset yourself if you don't give yourself enough time. That is if you're like me and love flowers."
,,"quiet, peaceful....just lovely!",5.0,,"I loved the National Orchid Garden! I wasn't sure what to expect, but I only have good things to say about this haven in the city. I went early in the morning, and I am glad that I did! I think it would have been very hot later in the day. The orchids were just breathtaking! I did not mind the entry fee, in fact I would have paid more! I will definitely go back on my next visit to Singapore! Bring water with you!! And your camera!!"
,,Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,"Walked to the gardens from our hotel on Scotts Road before 8:30 am. Nice walk, orchid gardens are well planned with some lovely flowers. Worth the $5 admission."
,,Worth taking time,5.0,,"Encouraged by positive reviews I stopped off her for a couple of hours, with a stroll through the adjacent Botanical Gardens. Beautiful and calm place - but keep an eye on the weather forecast. Not a place to be in a thunder storm."
,,What a place,5.0,,"The only problem here was that there are so many varieties and such a high quality that one visit creates a bit of a 'another orchid' towards the end. This is not meant as a criticism, merely to advocate an extended visit."
,,Lovely as ever,4.0,,One of our favourite places in Singapore for garden lovers. There is always a varied selection of orchids and plenty of information on conservation and new species.
,,very nice,4.0,,good place to visit and see - beautiful orchid gardens and entry is free which is very surprising! Lots of amazing things to see and very relaxing
,,Lush,4.0,,Inspite of the humidity this was another green haven in the city ~well maintained and warrants a visit....am I am not even into orchids !
,,exquisite flowers,4.0,,"The orchid gardens are part of the botanical gardens for which you pay an entry fee of Sin$5 but they are well worth it as they are so beautifully laid out. The flowers are incredible in their variety and beauty and the garden design is excellent. It can be a bit confusing finding your way round and there could be a bit more information in places, but it is well worth a visit and there is a shop and kiosk near the entrance."
,,Bring your hat & sunscreen,4.0,,"The garden is lovely and has a wide variety of Orchids and Bromeliads as well as a 'cold house' for cooler climate orchids and plants.

There is hot and there is not much shade as you walk around so bring a hat or umbrella and bottled water.

Well worth the $5 SGD admission fee.

It is a long walk from the Botanic Gardens MRT station to the Orchid Garden, so you may be better off to get a taxi to one of the closer gates."
,,Beautiful Orchids,5.0,,Anyone visiting the botanic gardens should try to make time to visit the National Orchid Garden. The variety of orchids and the settings are stunning. It is also novel to be able to walk round and look at so many orchids all growing outside as the climate in Singapore is ideal for them. Apparently Singapore supplies orchids around the world and it is a significant part of their export trade. They also give orchids as symbols of peace to different nations.
,,Well taken care off,5.0,,"Nice place, looking at the gardeners one can tell they admire their job, unfortunately during our visit only about half of the flowers were out. We liked the shelter huts, because we were hit by a severe thunderstorm,"
,,Paradise in a garden,5.0,,"Nothing to dislike but make sure you take a bottle of water, you can top it up for free in the gardens.
I loved the variety and the quality of the orchids, the gardens are just so relaxing. waste 4 hours in the blinking of an eye"
,,nature within airport,5.0,,"all inside is excellent, beautiful orchids with flowers, unbelievably beautiful, enchanting to the mind and can spend good amount of time seeing and photographing them"
,,A must for all lovers of flowers,5.0,,Very colourful collection of a large variery of orchids beautifully displayed visit the mist house and the cold house to see the varitey of orchids together.Try and spend at least 3 hours to enjoy the peaceful and tranquil surroundings.
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,very well presented an looked after. wheelchair/pram access. Lots of good photo spots. seniors admission is only $1
,,Paradise of Orchids,5.0,,"The garden contained the most beautiful orchids I have ever seen. It takes at least an hour to get round, but is manageable, mostly flat walking, and well worth the time"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,I enjoyed the different variety of orchids and the bright colors surrounding the whole park. It is very near the National Mosque but it's quite a walk from there. This is best done with the Hop-on-hop-off bus tours.
,,Nice oasis in the city!,5.0,,"Really a peaceful place if you like flowers and espescially orchids, you find every sort you can think of here. Queen Sonja of Norway has an orchid named after her here."
,,Gorgeous,4.0,,"We arrived via the MRT, it was beautiful, stunning, and breath taking, well worth the visit. High tea was also yummy and leisurely the service was great, pleasant and welcoming."
,,Very pleasant and a wide variety of orchids,4.0,,Amazing display of orchids and other plants from Asia. Very well kept gardens a breath of fresh (well hot) air.
,,LOVELY!,5.0,,I love orchids so this is 1 of the 1st places I visited when I arrived. So many different varieties & all the beds were really well maintained & laid out. The sheer volume of flowers will blow your mind.
,,Pretty garden for a tranquil afternoon,3.0,,"The Orchid Garden is small and well maintained with a wide variety of natural and hybrid orchids. March was not the best month to go visit as many were not in bloom, and we were caught in the biggest thunderstorm we have ever experienced so bring your umbrellas.

The garden is somewhere you could defiantly have a pleasant day with parents and grandparents. Although the uphill walk may be a challenge for some. It was a peaceful and relaxed place to spend a few hours."
,,Beautifull flowers,4.0,,"Nice place to see different kinds of flowers, birds, butterflies and some other nature. A must see for nature lovers!"
,,I can't tell an orchid from a water lilly - had a great time.,5.0,,"Even for neanderthal's like me, this was a great time. Hey, they had a venus flytrap!! How cool is that?

Overall, the garden is extremely well laid out with walkways and photo spots and there is lots of information to educate the plant-illiterate. Also, there are open houses providing cool rooms (which you will need, trust me), and the cool plant house that has the above mentioned carnivores.

We spent 2 1/2 hours just in the Orchid garden, and (unfortunately) we didn't get to the poisonous plant area as the day was just too hot. If you really like plants and want to spend some time, go early as it is HOT in the middle of the day. Even then, you might want to plan for 2 trips depending on your predilections."
,,"A long walk, but worth it",5.0,,"I took the subway. It is a long way, over a 40 minute ride after transfer from my downtown hotel. The subway is at a very end of the very large Botanic Gardens. The Orchid Garden is quite a walk from the subway, but the buses may be more convenient. The neighborhood outside the park is very beautiful and it is does not seem to be in such huge city. The heat, even in the dry season, was oppressive so take an umbrella and be prepared to walk. The gardens are interesting and lovely with very good facilities. The Orchid Gardens quite large also. The Botanic Garden is free, but there a small ticket charge for the Orchids, but it is even less if you are a student or a senior. There are many little areas and tableaus with a great variety of plantings. It took me an hour or so rushing through the exhibits. It was shady and cooler than the rest of the garden. Leave yourself enough time. This is not something you can rush in and see and rush out and dress appropriately."
,,Pretty,4.0,,"Pretty, though very hot on the day we visited. I highly recommend a hat and lots of water. Easy to get to via the MRT, but be prepared to walk."
,,Man made wonder,4.0,,"The small well maintained Orchid Garden has got a large variety of Orchids - natural as well as hybrids. The layout and landscaping is done with an intent to give shade to the delicate flowers. Peaceful environment, a paradise for photography. I missed a high end camera for the close ups."
,,Orchid Garden,5.0,,Magnificent place. Take the bus tour of Singapore and get off at the gardens for an hour or two. Do not miss out. Bus drops you outside the gate.
,,Pleasure for eyes and mind,5.0,,Meticulously planned and amazingly well maintained! Such a pleasure to walk along this blooming vivid orchids! It is not a small garden as I expected. The diversity of the flowers is astonishing. The VIP garden is nice place as well. I would recommend to include the orchid garen and botanic gardens to the list of sites to see in Singapore to realise that Singapore is not only about skyscrappers an dynamics but also about natural beauty and relaxation. Location: its is inside the Botanic Gardens and a fee of 5 dollars is applicable.
,,Choice spot for bridal photos!,5.0,,"Yes the orchids are beautiful and you may even spot a local couple in bridal attire setting up for wedding photos. Wear light, breathable clothing and expect hot, humid conditions in the garden. The garden is in pristine condition as fresh orchids are brought in every two days!

Be sure and spend time at the gift shop for some unique and memorable souvenirs for friends back home.

Great place for a rest room break as facilities are Western are very clean."
,,Lovely.,5.0,,"We arrived when it opened. Beautiful and inspiring. It is great to the rest of the Botanical Garden early, too, to see the locals exercising and enjoying the park."
,,Absolutely Stunning!!,5.0,,"What a lovely way to spend a morning! I am not an avid gardener by any stretch of the imagination, but I was truly amazed at just how many different varieties of orchid there are, as well as the vast array of colours and I took lots of photos. Everything is so well laid out and meticulously maintained. It can get quite busy with tourist groups dashing about and walking into your shot just as you're about to take a photo and as frustrating as that can be, once they've done their thing, they soon move on to the next spot. Well worth the SD$5 entrance fee.

If you take the MRT, just be aware that you have approximately a 20min walk through the Botanic Gardens to get there."
,,lovely orchids,5.0,,beautiful orchids great setting in the gardens. worth the trip. adjacent gardens are nice to walk through as well
,,so colorful!,5.0,,a great short walk through the colorful garden! i enjoyed it very much and its nice that they give a discount for students. the VIP orchids are interesting :)
,,Great place to enjoy the blooms,3.0,,Good place for enthusiasts or just browsers. Be astounded by the multitude of blooms. Simply astonishing.
,,Sensational,5.0,,Beautifully laid out and picturesque. Even as a non-gardener I couldn't help but be impressed. The blooms were stunning.
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,"The orchid garden was just beautiful, There was so much variety of orchids we could easily have spent a few hours here. One of the highlight of the botanic gardens"
,,Stunning!,5.0,,This is a fantastic place to visit within the botanical gardens itself. It costs $5 to go in and is well worth it. There are so many beautiful colours and types of orchids which we had never seen before. We took so many photos and were walking around for a couple of hours. Take water as it is hot and also an umbrella just incase!
,,Serene and beautiful,5.0,,"What a lovely way to spend a morning. A bargain at 5 SGD. Beautifully maintained, magnificent specimens to admire and they even point out where to sit to have the best photos taken. Although didactic, they are right!!"
,,Orchid lovers heaven,5.0,,It was a pure delight to stroll around the garden. The place was immaculately tended. Indeed it was very hot as I foolishly arrived around 11.30am. Probably a bit more comfortable if you go earlier. That said the were many shaded areas to rest and have a sip of water. Ironically there is a Cool House for those plants that prefer higher climes. It was like stepping out of a fridge and back into a sauna upon exiting that little greenhouse. I would recommend a good hour in here maybe longer if you have time to spare. Photos taken are like picture postcards. Enjoy !
,,Hot but unbelievably gorgeous,5.0,,Take water. Go early. Take a good camera Not to be missed walking tour go more orchids than I ever knew existed
,,Singapore is one big green house,5.0,,Wonderful selection and the Tiger orchids were blooming! Beautiful displays and groupings to enhance the show
,,Stunning,5.0,,"I visited one rainy afternoon and was not disappointed. It's well-tended and organized, each flower having a description. Was a bit surprised by the $5 fee, though. But it's worth every penny."
,,A nice path to walk and watch beautiful orchids,4.0,,"The Garden is nice and big. Very well conserved. Even if you are not a flower lover(like me), it is worth to take an early morning walk thru the park. Do not come late otherwise you will sweat like in a sauna."
,,Riotous colour,4.0,,"If you come from a cool climate you'lll be agog at the colour here from the orchids. Nature puts on her very best display in a spectrum of riotous colour. A nice natural setting. We visited on a Wednesday morning and, even then it was busy!"
,,A Must-See in Singapore,5.0,,One of the most beautiful gardens in the world. The masses of orchid displays were simply stunning set in a tropical paradise.
,,Celebrity Cruise Tour,5.0,,"I love orchids! You can't ask for anywhere else to visit. It is located in the center of the city and the park itself has a tremendous collections of trees, shrubs and of course, thousands of orchid varieties."
,,Orchid Gardens,5.0,,"Catch the Metro, and you have a 2minute walk to the Gardens, lovely well set out, space, seats and storm places, places to eat and shop, spend 4-5 hours easy."
,,Beautiful place for a wander,5.0,,"For someone who isn’t an avid gardener or anything, this place is amazing. the Orchids are beautiful, & it is set out wonderfully. you can stroll along the paths to see stunning orchids& even prize/award winning orchids. $5 entry fee, there is a few extra 'photo opportunity' labelled areas around so you can grab a snap with friend or family. also has a little gift shop at the end of it with nice gifts. to get there go on the MRT, Circle (yellow) line, to Botanic Gardens."
,,Wonderful Garden,5.0,,The Orchid Garden is certainly worth a visit. The fountains and presentation are outstanding. We were blown away by the colours and varieties on show.
,,Lovely place for a stroll,4.0,,"Lovely place for a stroll. Loads of different orchids, for the novice like us it was a surprise to see that many. 5$ per adult for entrance fees."
,,A must for orchid lovers,4.0,,"This is a lovely garden to stroll through as everwhere you turn you'll find something captivating. For us, it looks at it's best in November, but it still has plenty to offer in February. The only real disappointment was the 'Diana' orchid which did not match its photograph, but perhaps we were out of season for it."
,,Absolutely Stunning!,5.0,,"A must see if you visit Singapore, absolutely beautiful and good value for money. A great day out for all ages."
,,surprise,5.0,,"did not expect much of the park as I am not a flower person. But is a really nice park worth a visit. We did it in october, which should be after the season, but still many nice flowers to see."
,,Been many times and love it,5.0,,"its lovely to have a wonder around the lovely flowers, so many always in bloom, good one to take guests!"
,,Well worth paying modest entry fee,4.0,,Well worth paying modest entry fee but quite a long walk through the lovely Botanic Gardens. Recommend sun screen and hats!
,,Walk through Botanic gardens as well,5.0,,Got the MRT to Botanic so had a long enjoyable walk through the gardens to reach the Orchid Garden. We really enjoyed the beautiful orchid garden and it was a lovely walk. As it was a very hot day and we had walked a long way the Cool House in the Orchid Garden was a lovely place to spend several minutes.
,,Very well set up and managed,5.0,,"Lots to do in the area. The mall across the highway will entice you to spend a few thousand. As for the gardens, it was just after Tet or the Asian New Year so the displays were incredible. Hugh snakes made out of flowers. Incredible."
,,A feast for the eyes,5.0,,"The day we were leaving we decided to pop over to see the Orchid gardens. I'm so glad we did, it is a delight on the eyes to see so many varieties and colors of orchids. It's an absolutely wonderful experience and they do such a great job at maintaining the gardens in perfect condition. I'm only sorry we couldn't spend more time but had to catch our plane home. Don't wait like we did to see this attraction."
,,Shouldn't be missed,5.0,,"This is well worth the nominal entry fee. A very pleasant stroll, with orchids almost every step of the way, not to mention the other plants. The section with orchids named after the great and good (politicians, celebrities etc) is a wonderful collection.

Overall and extremely attractive, well kept and colourful botanical speciality garden and as I guess that such an attraction is not that common due to the climatic conditions required, it really should not be missed."
,,spectacular; not to be missed,5.0,,"There aren't words. This is a beautiful place, with unbelievable flowers in a lovely setting, everything presented, tended, curated. Overall botanical garden very special place; orchid garden breath-taking. Very hot when we were there and if we'd been smart, we would have found the entrance closer to the orchid garden, as it was a pretty long walk in a lot of heat to get there. Well worth it!"
,,orchids orchids everywhere,4.0,,This is the place to come if you want to see orchids. Free entry into the Botanic Gardens and just $SGD5 for the orchids. This is a traditional garden that can take hours to wander through with so many colours and shapes. I expect every month will show off different varieties so there is plenty of reason to return
,,A good way to spend a quiet couple of hours,5.0,,Beautiful orchid section. The colours were incredible. It's on the double deck bus route so it's very easy to get to.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Gorgeous display of orchids in a lovely setting. Small entry fee worth paying, although the rest of the Botanic Gardens are free."
,,Lovely evening,5.0,,Good evening's walk. About S$9 by taxi from the city. Had a very nice meal there in the restaurant afterwards.
,,Beautiful gardens & on the hop on hop off bus line.,5.0,,One of the most beautiful botanical gardens we've been to. Easy to access with public transport or on the hop on hop off bus. Well worth the trip! The botanical garden is free but the orchid garden has an entrance fee.
,,Beauty,5.0,,"To fully appreciate this don't go on a city tour you really need much more time. The orchids are truly amazing, what colours and what varieties."
,,Looking for princess Diana's orchid,5.0,,"Beautiful location, very serene, orchid located in VIP,orchid area , five dollars to enter !plenty to see , flowers were amazing, not too crowded!"
,,Beautiful and inexpensive side trip,5.0,,We live in walking distance to the Botanic Gardens (the only thing free in Singapore besides air!). The National Orchid Garden with worth the small admission fee and you will be amazed by the thousands of beautiful orchids.
,,Stynning array of orchids,5.0,,Great garden to wander around but pick your time carefully ... it gets very hot after about 11am. The gardens were quite busy but did not feel crowded ... plenty of space.
,,A must see when in Singapore,5.0,,An amazing array of orchids and well worth the small entrance fee. Be sure to bring your camera as you will want to capture memories of these beautiful flowers.
,,Beautiful Orchids!,5.0,,The flowers were so beautiful and bountiful! It was well worth a visit! The crowds and the heat did not deter and we got so many pictures worth framing!
,,"Beautiful orchid gardens, even for non-gardening types like us!!",4.0,,"everyone talks about these beautiful gardens so we thought we should see them...we were not disappointed, despite the huge downpour halfway through our visit! Orchids of every shape, size, colour..."
,,So beautiful!,5.0,,"I visited the Orchid Garden 3 times in 2009, 2010 and 2013 and I am still so enthusiastic! A must see in Singapore"
,,exotic,5.0,,"beautiful flowers, lovely perfume, great location within the Botanic Gardens, nothing to dislike. A great photo opportunity but it is very humid in the orchid house so you might not want to stay long in there. Luckily there are more outside."
,,Beautiful place,4.0,,"Should it have 4 or 5 starts, as first time we visit the park was the best as all the orchid was blooming. Second time we were not so happy, but still a beautiful place"
,,Probably the best place for Orchids,4.0,,"I am not a big botany fan but I should suppose that this is probably the best place you can go to for Orchids.

Located within the Singapore Botanic Gardens, it is home to many types of Orchids and there is also an area where they showcase Orchids named after famous people like the late Diana, Princess of Wales. It is definitely a good place for a leisurely stroll.

Just one thing to note, it is probably a good idea not to be strolling here around noon as that is the hottest time of day all year round."
,,Nice but not the best in this city,3.0,,Is a nice place to visit but for sure not the number one attraction in Singapore. In some gardens (healing garden specially) it is difficult to find the way out.
,,Lots of orchids,4.0,,"This is a nice trip if you like your orchids. When we went, some of the bed were bare, so it will be interesting to see what they are like a few months on. There are seniors and child discounts."
,,Lovely Flowers!,5.0,,Nice place to enjoy your afternoon and relax. Lots of amazing and colorful flowers. The garden is also well maintained and clean.
,,Gorgeous orchids!,5.0,,"The variety of orchids here is amazing, and if you love plants just for the colours, you will be taking photos one after the other. If you are an orchid fan, the way they have designed the gardens around these beautiful plants, is very pleasing."
,,Must visit,4.0,,Vast range of colors within a small area. Amazing Orchids. Best for photography. and must for a normal visit. :)
,,Worth a trip,4.0,,"This garden is with the Singapore Botanical Garden' so if you make a trip there you definitely have to go to the national orchid garden. There is a small minimal fee but, it is completely worth it. The gift shop that you exit at is also quite nice, the last trip i made i brought back a bunch of orchids in a box. ( the sales assistances are very friendly make sure you ask them if the orchids are allowed into your country as they are fresh flowers and some countries don't allow it)
Oh btw you can also find a orchid store at the airport if you intend to take some home. Hope you enjoy the garden as much as i did."
,,Very nice establishment.,5.0,,A great number of rare orchids presented its natural environment. Probably one outstanding collection of beauty and charm.
,,Go to the botanical gardens -fantastic,5.0,,"An oasis of calm, great restaurant in the middle lots of people having brunch on sunday morning! A lovely walk around the gardens and its free entry."
,,Great place to stroll around,4.0,,"Very peaceful place to roam around with your partner. Also, very interesting looking at the different types of orchids and the history behind their chosen names...worth the small entrance fee, although the gift shop is a little pricey"
,,I loved the Orchids,5.0,,"Best Orchid garden I have been to. There were so many varieties of orchids in all different shapes and colors. I absolutely loved it there. It was a pretty big garden, I did get lost a few times, I do wish they had maps and signs but I loved the VIP garden and the many different varieties of orchids. Any time I go to Singapore I will visit this place again."
,,Highlight of the short visit to Singapore,5.0,,"Forget the shops, get to the gardens when they open at 8:30am (cooler and no crowds). Excellent value as just SIN$5 (Kew Gardens, eat your heart out). Take your time walking round. The only down side is that few orchids are labelled with their names but there is a lot of information on orchid types at Burkill Hall, half way round. If you're getting hot and sweaty as you walk round, don't worry, the Cool House awaits you near the end. When you've finished, Orchard Rd (shops, shops, shops) is not far away. Walk there via the pleasant Botanical Gardens."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"We visited just after Prince William and Kate's visit. The Orchid Garden is worth the small fee to get in, it is much larger than we expected and truly beautiful."
,,Left wanting to come back,5.0,,Came on a city tour so wasn't here long enough but didn't have time to do more. Flowers are gorgeous but leave time to spend wandering as grounds huge
,,orchid garden,2.0,,"Of course it was nice, but for the 'Oldest Orchid Garden' on planet Earth - a bit dull. Over rate. Try Darwin. Not as famous, but things are really happening there = more variety, more color. More insects. Still, very pleasant, but not mind blowing."
,,Beautiful and peaceful,5.0,,"Take the time to wander. If you are over 60 years old show proof of age and you qualify for the seniors discount.. the orchids are beautiful, well set out. Don't miss it."
,,Fantastic Display,5.0,,Even on a hot & humid day this is a trip you must take. Its an easy walk or short taxi ride Fantastic display of unusual Orchids
,,What a wonderful place,5.0,,Fantastic collection of beautiful orchids. A guide is really essential to point out the features. Garden of Hybrids dedicated to visitors is interesting. You will find Mrs Thatcher and Diana but the new Kate variety had been temporarily removed duong our visit.
,,Serenity now!,5.0,,"The humidity, the scent, the colours - an amazing experience from someone who isn't into flowers, but would definitely go here again"
,,A must if you visit Singapore,5.0,,This a must if you visit Singapore. They are situated in the Botanical Gardens. You pay a small fee to enter ut worth every cent.
,,Very beautiful place,5.0,,"I am not a huge fun of orchids. Actually, I did not know if I like the place when I went there out of curiosity. And I was stunned by the variety and beauty of orchards so different in colors and sizes."
,,Beautiful Setting with a large variety of orchids,5.0,,"Definitely worth it. It is a large, peacefull and beautiful park. try to avoid Sundays, as it gets very crowded"
,,Most beautiful,5.0,,Well worth the visit. Princess Diana's orchid most beautiful. Best to visit early before crowds and when it is cooler.
,,nice reprieve from shopping malls!,5.0,,"beautiful, abundance of several varieties of orchids. Very pleasant grounds to walk around and take in some nature."
,,one of the best things to do in singapore,3.0,,also because it is free! you can learn from the complete description of the flowers in this park near Promenade. Inside also some bush-sculptures representing animals
,,A Treasure,5.0,,"Beautiful setting for unimaginable variety of orchids. Definitely go as early in the morning as is reasonable - later in the day it is a sauna, at least when we went."
,,Mesmerising,5.0,,Awesome place with great collection of Orchids. You have to walk a lot if you are planning to go by the MRT. The queue for taxi back from the garden could be long and will take a lot of time as there will be no taxis waiting for you there.
,,A must see,5.0,,Even if you know nothing about orchids you can't fail to be impressed by a leisurely walk through this magnificent garden.
,,Take a brolley,4.0,,"Loved the grounds, hated the rain and had difficulty with getting transport as it was chinese new years eve"
,,Unique,4.0,,"I'm not fan of flowers, but I was still left impressed with the Orchid Gardens. It has many orchids which were grafted there itself. The presentation is beautiful too."
,,Brilliant. Don't miss it and allow enough time,5.0,,The national Orchid Garden is a brilliant large area of Botanical Gardens . For the enthusiast it is well labelled and has extensive variety but for the general visitor it is a place of great beauty and variety and wonderful photographic opportunities Good gift shop too .And only $5 entry!
,,Stunning gardens,5.0,,You can spend the whole day walking around the gardens which are lovely. There's a good choice for eating.
,,Fantastic Garden,5.0,,This has to be one of the most pleasant ways to spend a couple of hours. This is really well done and gives a wide range of environments and gardens to explore. They are well laid out in varying landscapes and buildings and you will not be disappointed. I urge you to visit.
,,Oasis from the city,5.0,,Fantastic park even with crowds of visitors lots of little nooks and crannies to escape. Plants are amazing except for ones vandalised by cretins carving their names into them.
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,"We really enjoyed the Orchid Garden. I have never seen so many types and colors of orchids! The gardens has a number of beautiful photo opportunities set up for you, so take your camera and plan to take a few family photos while you're in there.

The only drawback was the heat. We were so hot and tired by the time we left - I recommend taking lots of water, wearing a hat and light clothing, and going at a cool time of day if possible."
,,A must-visit-place in Singapore,5.0,,"Go there early in the morning - opening at 0830am - where it is not so crowded...

Wonderful to discover all the different Orchids and the garden - prepare to spend 1-2 hours inside the Orchid Garden - entrance fee is only 5SGD, but absolutely worth to spend.

A lot of interesting photo spots (also displayed) and a VIP Orchid Garden - with Orchids named after celebrities and VIPs... very interesting place"
,,Beautiful Orchid Garden,4.0,,There is a wide variety of orchids and it is naturally grown in the soil and not in pots. Nice! There is a cool place and a small man-make waterfall and a big lake with goose. Nice place to stroll your lesiure time.
,,garden,5.0,,great are in Botanic gardens. you have to pay 7S$. It will take minimum 45 minutes to see. there are lots of different types of Orchid there. there are also some Orchid which are created in the name of some famous people.
,,"Name the colors, you'll see them!",5.0,,I simply love the Orchids ... it's so refreshing and relaxing to stay inside the garden...time allocated to visit the place is too short..wish we could stay longer!
,,"Beautiful Orchids, Tranquil Atmoshere!",4.0,,"Likes: I absolutely loved the array of colourful orchids in the gardens. They were all placed around the garden accoriding to their specific genus/species.

Burkhill hall is now a sort of ""museum"" that tells the story of the Orchids, with Orchids surrounding the hall the ones named after visiting dignitories.

Cool House was AMAZING! It was so awesome, with the manmade waterfall..

Dislikes: We could not go up into the Burkhill Hall to see where Burkhill and Son took residence, without prior notice to NParks... so if you are also a history fan, you will be saddened. :("
,,A paradise of colour and tranquility. Worth visiting!,4.0,,"My husband and I spent a relaxing afternoon visiting the National Orchid Garden. Adults entrance fee is 5 Sgd. and students enter for only 1 SGD.

Established in 1859, this centre has been attracting visitors from all over the world to a paradise of colour and tranquility. They say that over 1000 species and 2,000 hybrids are now found in the Gardens' collection, with about 600 species and hybrids on display. Unfortunately I think we had come at the wrong time of year because many of them had not yet bloomed. They also say that each year more vibrant and enduring hybrids are added on. It is certainly a place to capture a romantic photograph of husband and wife relaxing in the colorful surrounds or for a memorable photo of a family at one of the my photo stops set within the orchids. you will not regret this time spent on your visit to admire and enjoy their diversity, richness and beauty. The National Orchid Garden is touted as the largest display of tropical orchids in the world."
,,Orchids galoe,4.0,,"Beatiful tranquil place, so many beautiful flowers. Lots to see, very enjoyable but I went on City tour and was a bit rushed"
,,Great morning in Singapore,5.0,,"A really relaxing free morning,great walk beautiful scenery,a real exotic place,we wandered around the gardens and then the orchid houses,it was tranquil,quiet,and peacefully to thin Orchard Road is only a short stroke away is amazing"
,,Beautiful Flowers..,5.0,,Gr8 haven for photographers...You get to see so many varied colors and designs..In addition to this the souveniers store in the Orchid garden have come up with an ingenius way for people who want to take home orchid plants back home.They have kept some tissue cultures of many orchids in small bottles and you have to keep the plant in that bottle till the plant outgrows it.All in all a very nice place to visit..
,,Exceeded expectations,5.0,,"The vast orchid collection was a feast for the eyes. It was indeed worth the trip, especially for our 84 year old mother, who is a gardener and orchid lover. You can't help but be amazed by so many blooms of different varieties, colors and shapes. Just when I thought things became ""quiet"" as we walked on a winding trail underneath tall trees, a visual surprise awaited us in a corner. Even nooks and crannies of the garden offers surprises, a plant, flower or art. There were shaded seating areas where we sat to rest and simply admire the flowers. A vendo machine by the exit provided cold refreshments after spending an afternoon walking among the orchids.

Tour groups can spoil the tranquility as they can become noisy, hog the photo spots and breeze through the garden in a hurry. It's best to let them go ahead so that you can savor your experience with the flowers.

Entrance to the garden costs S$5 but senior citizens like our mom paid only S$1.

Bring water, a hat or umbrella and don't forget your camera."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Amazing the colours, shape and texture of the well cared for orchids, cool house was a relief in the heat, also Seniors discount"
,,Amazing! Must-Visit for Plant Lovers and Photographers!,5.0,,"Went here with my mom and enjoyed, she did. I wonder how they manage such beautiful flowers and make them produce that much flower. Just wow! Amazing!

When you go here, prepare your cameras coz for sure, you would want to take pictures of all the beautiful orchid breed."
,,Pure beauty,5.0,,"Beautiful, stunning orchid collection in a beautiful park. On the weekend, live music playing in the park creating a super chilled atmosphere. a must in Singapore"
,,Must be ready for photography.,5.0,,"Have your camera fully charged and memory card with enough space. I did over 200 pictures in this place. Incomparable diversity of orchids. Place is very clean, roomy and well maintained. The only thing may spoil your visit is rain. Check weather forecast before going there."
,,Just beautiful,5.0,,"Many years ago I was bought a gold covered orchid from the National Orchid Garden, and consequently have always wanted to visit these gardens. They did not disappoint. There is a small, but more than reasonable, entrance fee, but then you enter a world of real beauty and colour. The Garden is beautifully arranged and everywhere you look is stunning. We just didn't have long enough! Grace & beauty in these Gardens."
,,Glorious gardens,5.0,,"A must see on your Singapore trip. The beautiful gardens are well maintained and full of colourful orchids arranged in shade houses, in garden beds and along archways.A photographers dream...we would go back."
,,Must See in Singapore,5.0,,The variety of orchids is amazing. Worth the entrance fee. It took about 1 hour to see all of the flowers that were very beautiful and well displayed.
,,Lovelier the 2nd time around.,5.0,,"I visited the National Orchid Garden, 10 years after my first visit in 2003. It is so much more beautiful than I remember. The orchids were in full bloom this time and the garden was alive with orchids of different sizes, shapes and color. I am still amazed at how well the garden is maintained. On this visit, my 83-year old mother was with us and she enjoyed the blooms and the garden's ambiance. Pushing her around on a wheelchair was not difficult and the smile on her face was worth the effort."
,,Orchid heaven,5.0,,Basically the world's premier orchid collection. Stunning! Includes specialty houses for orchids from special environments. Quite over the top (like a lot of things in Singapore).
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Amazing variety of orchids - for anyone visiting Singapore, a visit to the National Orchid Garden is a must!"
,,I'm not green fingered and really enjoyed it.,5.0,,"Entry cost was SGD $5 (£2.50) which is very reasonable. If you are from a country with a climate where you don't often get to see Orchids I think you will enjoy it regardless of your age or interests.

I am not much of a gardener, in fact my garden is looking such a shambles I might have to look to employ one. Whenever we have had an orchid in the house we have killed it! So if I enjoyed it's worth a visit if you have time.

Their is a cafe restaraunt that serves itallian (pasta and pizza) and Chinese noddle dishes etc that is nearby and very reasonable. Good place to avoid the afternoon rain showers!"
,,Fabulous flowers,5.0,,Loved to see groups of orchids as they would grow In nature. The park they are in was lovely to walk around. Also there were good places to eat.
,,Breathtakingly beautiful,5.0,,Well worth a visit and so reasonably priced at only $10SD per person. We loved this part of Singapore and could have spent all day in the botanic gardens and orchid garden. Loads of ideas for home now!
,,Really worth seeing,5.0,,"I recommend the visitors to schedule several hours for walking in this marvelous garden. I wish we had spent there longer than 1,5 hours."
,,Beautiful Orchids,5.0,,"If you are a fan of orchids (and who isn't) this is the place to go if you are in Singapore. The Orchid garden is located within the Singapore Botanic Garden and has an admission charge which the rest of the botanic garden is free. However, the charge is minimal- S$5 ($4 US) and for seniors it was only S$1(81 cents US). A small price to pay to see an outstanding collection of flowers. My favorite spot was the air-conditioned orchid house where cooler climate flowers were contained. Believe me, on a hot humid Singapore day outside, it felt great. You should also allow some time to spend in the very nice gift shop there which has a very different selection of items than the gift shop at the Botanical garden entrance.

One final item on logistics. Cabs might be the easiest way to get here, but the Singapore Airlines hop-on bus takes you right to the gate."
,,Wow truly wonderful,5.0,,"We had three nights in Singapore before heading to Thailand. We had a list of sights to see and very little time. We went on a city tour which visited the National Orchid Gardens. Unfortunately it wasn't a long enough visit - but at least we visited this wonderful oasis of calm and magnificent plants. It is beautifully laid out with space to see each specimen.
There is information given to explain how the orchids are developed and it is easy to follow.
We saw many of the famouse orchids.
It is truly magnificent and thoroughly enjoyable- not to be missed on a visit to Singapore!"
,,Enjoy beauty,5.0,,What amazing and romantic place .Lots of varieties of flowers ..Tip for photo savy ..one spot where orchids are in two rows and sitting place in between so in photo you appears emerging from orchids.
,,Fantastic garden,5.0,,"So green and quiet. And so different from Denmark, of course. We could have spent more time here, but were only here for a stopover."
,,Really lovely,5.0,,"Went as part of a city discovery tour, wish we'd had more time and I had worn more comfortable shoes."
,,Loved it here,5.0,,"Although we got caught in a huge rain storm, this place was gorgeous. My husband and I had so much fun walking around the grounds and just enjoying being together in all of the beauty. So inexpensive to go, there would be no reason not to!"
,,"Lovely Orchids, Highly Recommended",5.0,,"As far as gardens go for flowers, and for those that like flowers, this garden is very beautiful. The garden is segmented into several different areas with different types of orchids. Various arches, fountains, statues etc. make the place well decorated. There are also photo spots designed for people to take photos both sitting and standing. Our favourite area was the mist house, that we felt had the nicest orchids we had seen anywhere in the world before, with almost every colour imaginable available. The attraction has a small, but negligible entrance fee ($5 adult, $1 student). We would recommend to spend an hour or so there. Highly worth a visit and one of the key attractions in the Singapore Botanical Gardens."
,,very good but hot,4.0,,"Really lovely setting, easy to get there but hot. Go early in morning before too hot. Whole gardens area spectacular."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Many kinds of orchird. I love flower, so it was definately a nice choice for me. Just 5S$ to enter! I like the cool house."
,,Finest Orchid Display Ever,5.0,,My wife and I visited the National Orchid Garden and were blown away. We love flowers and especially orchids so we were very excited to see all the orchids in the park. Yes it is hot and humid but that is the price you must pay for such beauty! We spent about two hours walking thru the gardens. We would definitely do this again!
,,excellent,5.0,,I have never seen so many beautiful flowers in one place. It was worth every penny of the $5 entry fee.
,,Orchids everywhere,5.0,,"Tons of orchids, lovely place to take pictures, bring lots of water to drink or be prepared to pay for water. It's the tropics, so it's hot!"
,,The best orchid collection in the world,5.0,,"Breathtaking collection that will make you marvel at the colors and varieties available. Best of all, the orchids are displayed in a natural setting (and not like those on display in a nursery). Do not miss the section where there are numerous orchids named after famous people like Princess Diana, Elton John, amongst others."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Great design of garden, wonderfully maintained...perfect quite a large space and the orchids were tastefully displayed with many other plants. worth the entrance fee."
,,Absolutely Excellent,5.0,,"Brilliant display of orchids, set-out in a glorious garden setting. Just wonderful to see all these vivid colours and displays. Don't miss it!"
,,Must visit!,5.0,,"Singapore is known for its orchid, it is the most beautiful garden i have ever visited! It is inside the botanic garden and I would highly recommend it."
,,A Very Enjoyable Visit,5.0,,Well worth a half day visit. The mistake we made was visiting in the middle of the day as it was very humid.
,,a must-see,5.0,,incredibly rich and elegantly done. This garden is not free (unlike the rest of the botanic garden) but the experience is great. Don't miss it.
,,Mind blowing,5.0,,Brilliant collection of orchids in a lovely garden setting. How to spend a few hours away from the hurlyburly of Singapore. See orchids you won't have seen elsewhere! Definitely worth a visit.

,,Wow,5.0,,"I usually don't like gardens but this garden of unusual orchids was very interesting. Other gardens focused on ginger, and on tropical rainforest. Nice gift-shop. The whole park is a great place for people-watching, lots of joggers, exotic dogs, kids on skates, families picnicking. A lot of expatriates seem to hand out here."
,,"Go, go, go!",5.0,,You won't be disappointed. Make sure to bring your camera since there's a photo op every where you turn!
,,"Great variety, pleasant experience, lots of walking",4.0,,"The garden is impressive and unique, unfortunately we had very compressed schedule and had to squeeze our visit to Botanical and Orchid garden to just few hours. It's quite a walk to reach the Orchid garden, but settings are really nice. Mosquito spay is recommended. The variety of orchids is impressive, but I believe ""average"" visitor won't be able to appreciate the variety at grand scale, but that place definitely worth to visit and it's very enjoyable experience, quiet and peaceful - lots of picture taking opportunities, just prepare for a long walk and dedicate more than 3 hours."
,,"Nice, but hellishly humid",3.0,,"A beautiful visit whilst in Singapore, but set the chill room in your sights if the humidity is high. I found the historic orchids section very interesting."
,,stunning!,5.0,,"The orchid garden is just a beautiful haven to wander around in and see the myriad of orchid varieties there are, spent a peaceful afternoon just strolling through it."
,,Well care place,5.0,,"Singapore may not have their own orchid but I don't think I ever visit Orchid Garden better than National Orchid Garden. You can spend hours enjoying the beauty and made a lot of excellent photo because they really care about the place. I have here several times from 5 years ago, its always getting better !"
,,Well worth the small fee,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is the highlight of the Botanic Gardens in exhibiting tons of orchids in a great setting. Easy to get around and see lots of blooms that are set up close to pathways and easy to photograph. Well maintained and taken care of, it was a joy to spend an hour or so walking around and enjoying the flowers."
,,very beautiful,5.0,,Enjoyed walking around at our own pace. The staff at the gift shop were very helpful. We had lunch there but there wasn't very much choice of where to eat
,,Really stunning orchids,5.0,,Informative gardens as well as beautiful. Well worth visting. Could easily spend the day there with a book and picnic.

,,Great spot for family hang out,5.0,,My family and I had a great hang out day at National Orchid Garden. It was not very big but many beautiful orchids. We all loved it
,,Beautiful,5.0,,These gardens are spectacular and the orchids are perfect. Try and visit in bright sunshine rather than cloud as the sun brings out the colours. Wonderful place for close up photos of flowers. There is also a cool house which is welcome. Not expensive entrance fee of $S5 and for seniors $S1.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Lovely location to spend a few hours. Only $5 to get In to the orchid section of the gardens. Can't wait to visit again

,,Colour runs riot,5.0,,"This is a must for anyone who loves colours and flowers. The walk up from the entrance is a leisurely stroll with interesting trees. The paths wind round the Orchid Garden giving a range of attractive views.

There is a cheap and cheerful refreshment stall or a restaurant which has a good range of food, many local dishes are on the menu."
,,Been going here for years and will continue to do so!,5.0,,It's just the best part of the whole Botanical Gardens. Can't say much more than that. Have been visiting it since I was a little girl and it's still part of my visits whenever I go back to Singapore. Well worth a few hours of your time.

,,Beauty in excess,5.0,,"This is a must for all orchid lovers. The gardens are beautifully laid out and there are always orchids in bloom whatever time of the year you visit. The range of blooms is outstanding including outdoor ones, 'hot house' and 'cool house' varieties.
There is a small admission charge but it is well worth it - seniors (like me now!) get in for a dollar (c60p GBP) - what a bargain!"
,,Must see,5.0,,"It was great , so pretty.Its not only the Orchid Garden but overall a great park. It is a very pleasent walk and there was even an open air concert going on. Everyone was just enjoying it."

,,Absolutely fantastic !!!!!!!!!!!!,5.0,,"I liked the fact that there were so many different types of orchards that were so many different species and colours.

A lot of effort has been put into this garden, and it is amazing that there is such natural beauty hidden away in a busy city"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Went just before they did a refurb five years ago and it was a little sad. Now it was amazing. Worth a taxi ride out - and on a sticky day the cool room is a welcome break
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Singapore is known for its orchids and this will not dissapoint. Set in a lovely area within the Botanic Gardens for a small fee. Lots of orchids named after famous visitors to Singapore.
,,"wonderful. A ""must"" in Singapore",5.0,,"That is really a great attraction. The variety of orchids you can see there is just huge. I don't think there is any other place in the world with the same variety. Many of them are grown outside green houses, thanking the ideal temperature and humidity of Singapore. The Garden is inside the Botanic garden that is also highly recommended to be seen"
,,Blooming lovely,5.0,,An excellent and relaxing way to while away an hour or two . The plants are extraordinary in variety and colour and there is useful information on display . Well worth a visit
,,Great place to relax from the city,5.0,,Great presentation of orchids. The cool house is great to relax from Singapore-Heat. A downturn was the broken water vending machine on the inside...
,,Exquisite,5.0,,"After four visits, and despite my admiration for much of what the Singaporeans have achieved in their extraordinary city-state, I am no longer lured to shopping or tourist venues. There are three places I have so far discovered in Singapore that are simply beautiful and that refresh the spirit: the national orchid garden is one of them. The other two are the botanical gardens within which the orchid garden is located, and the Singapore Zoo. I am sure there are other places too; which, I guess, means I have to return. Not that the thought of Singaporean culinary delites wouldn't have drawn me back in any case."
,,what a little gem in botanic garden,5.0,,"it's so well maintained, based my personal experience, it's better than a lot of garden i have been to around the world and it costs S$5 = 3 euros, USD$4. i find it's really peaceful in there, went back again. highly recommended."
,,"Worth a visit, even if you are not an avid gardener",4.0,,"Do yourself a favour and take an early morning walk through the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Inside the sprawling green lungs of Singapore you will find the treasure that is the National Orchid Garden. I'm no garden or orchid enthusiast, and there are orchids everywhere in Singapore, but I thoroughly enjoyed wandering through the orchid lined paths and the ""cold house""..."
,,For the exotic flower lover,5.0,,"My wife loved it. The place is nicely manicured, well kept and enoyable, but go in the early morning while the heat is not as bad."
,,orchid garden,4.0,,"picturesque and serene,lovely in mornings.entry fees is there if you want to see orchid garden,otherwise no fees if you just visit botanical garden"
,,"Beautiful orchid collection, even for the enthusiast",5.0,,"I've seen a lot of orchids over the years, being an avid orchid enthusiast. This is a very well presented collection of warm orchids - vandas, dendrobiums, and others. There's also a cool house (which is refreshing to the visitor too). The surprise highlights of the garden though were the fauna - beautiful birds, and lizards. Go if you have any interest in orchids or flowers."
,,Big park with a lot of flowers ;-),5.0,,"Liked: a lot of interesting orchids, nicely arranged park, not too crowded. Disliked: a lot of plants were not blooming at the time of visit, I think it mainly depends on the time of year you come there."
,,"Beautiful and colorful place, very nice!",5.0,,"I went there with my mom and yes of course we really like it. They have so many orchids and mostly good :) Located inside Botanical Garden and we had to pay for the entrance..but it's not much compare with the beauty that you will enjoy!
I think it is like one of the most beautiful garden I have ever visited..and very recommended place in Singapore. At least it is an option rather than shooping in Orchard :)"

,,Beautiful and well arranged,4.0,,"$5 admission well worth this nice route in northern part of botanical garden. Was happy to see a wide variety of blooming plants in various sections.

,,A nice day out for the whole family.,5.0,,"We got a taxi from Bugis that cost $16. Its free entry into the gardens but you can pay $5pp to go into the Orchard Gardens which is well worth it!
There are numerous places to eat, even more places you can sit and have a picnic. We failed to bring an umbrella and got caught in the rain thus had to cut our exploration of the gardens short.

Actually just after few steps I felt it was true & the place was something not to be missed in a Vacation to Singapore. It is a rare & colourful collection of Orchids & the journey around gives a wonderful experience of nature. My favourite is The ""VIP Orchid Garden"" which is inside the gardens where you could see the rare & exquisite Orchids. If you are a photography lover then this could be the place for you.

,,Off the beaten track but worth the effort,5.0,,"My favourite visit during a week long visit. The gardens are immaculate well laid out and informative. You coukd easily spemd a day here or rush round in an hour. My first experience of coll houses showing ferns from home, Where all the spectacular plants and plowers are in the open. Surprised at one reviewer not seeing orchids must have had their eyes closed the are thousands! For a reasonable price you can take home a gold plated orchid. Not easily accessable by public transport you have to take a taxi, but considering how reasonable taxi travel is in Singapore not that expensive. Also I suppose for this reason not that crowded compared to Marina Sands viewing platform at sunset!"

Entry to the garden is very reasonably priced, and on the day we were there in November 2012 it was not busy, adding to our enjoyment. Highly recommended and very relaxing. The only drawback we could see was the lack of a coffee shop or equivalent but there are others in the Botanical Gardens themselves."

As soon as you enter you will experience a fragrance of orchids that makes you feel like you must be in heaven. This is a total must in Singapore!"

,,Beautiful,5.0,,"We visited the National Orchid Garden at the end of November on a short stopover stay. This Garden is in a larger Park and is well worth a visit. There are just so many beautiful different species of orchid to see and you definitely need a camera just to capture the moment.

There is a VIP area which has different orchids to mark visits from Dignatories and Royalty over the years and also a 'cool' area to walk through. I would recommend this is put on everyones to do list for Signapore"

,,Not Great !!,3.0,,"I would say these flowers are not great for a person who have come from a country side. But for Singapore, its good. I have seen more wild flowers which are so erotic than these naturally. it can be better for the price. The mist inside the garden was good. Better to go to Botanical garden for a walk and retun. You can watch these flowers at the airport only!!"
,,National Orchid Garfen,5.0,,I wish I had more time but because I was with a tour group we only had just over an hour to spend there.

,,Orchids and more orchids,5.0,,"I love flowers and orchids are one of my favourites. I loved our visit to the National Orchid Garden. The Botanical Garden was quite big and the Orchid one was much smaller but was still huge considering there were only orchids here. Some orchids had names of famous people, heads of states. If it's hot bring your umbrella to get some shade...and lots of water. The entry to Botanical Garden is free but you have to pay to get into the Orchid Garden, but it's worth it."
,,Beauty to feast your eyes on,5.0,,"This has a great collection of orchids, just when you think the last one was the most beautiful when you round the corner and see another orchid even more lovely with amazing colours.

,,What a gem,5.0,,There is an entrance fee but do not let this put you off the whole is a little treasure. There are single blooms and displays. Everything is immaculately tended. A fun part is the famous persons section.
,,Photographers heaven,5.0,,"If you like taking photos of flowers like me, then this is an absolute must! Absolutely stunning collection of orchids in a garden like environment. If you're visiting and using the 'hop on hop off bus' then the yellow route (think it was the cityline) takes you to the entrance of the botanic gardens and it's signposted from there, otherwise try the 174 bus. The cafe at the visitor centre is good - cappucino and pancakes with maple syrup were delicious!"
,,lovely walk,5.0,,nice calm area in a bustling city a lovely way to spend a few hours in beautiful scenery the range of flowers was amazing and the tropical glass houses a relief from the heat

,,Simply pretty to look at,5.0,,"The gardens are just so pretty and there are little alcoves dotted along the tracks for picture opportunities. The orchids are beautiful and the gardens magnificent. The paths are easy to follow and even though it is a little hilly, you don't notice it because of the way they have planned the garden. It rained on us while we were there but this just added to the fairytale environment. Loved it, I think it is a must see."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The National Orchid Gardens were beautiful, so many out in flower. the staff were extremely helpful and answered any questions with a great deal of knowledge"

,,Fantastic,5.0,,"We spent 2 hours here and I wish we had more time. It's a bit of a 20 minute hike (at a fast clip) from the MRT station but well worth it. In Singapore, they name new varieties of orchids in honor of famous visitors so it was kinda nifty to see some of the names. The orchids are beautiful and there are so many of them. Wish we had time to stop by the neighboring Healing Garden and Ginger Garden. Loved the Trellis Garden."
,,absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"stopped off here as part of our half day city tour and really enjoyed it, entry was covered in our tour price and was highlight of the tour, the orchids were absolutely stunning, if you are not into brilliant gentle plants such as orchids you may find it a bit boring, will probably visit again next year."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,"About 15-20 mins walking from MRT, definitely worth the price and effort. Cool house was great, however if you're not into macro photography or not a flower lover, you'll be bored. After short while most of the orchids will look the same to you. Approx. visit time 45 minutes."
,,Orchid Garden,5.0,,"Orchid Garden is wonderful, the flowers are amazing. For an orchid lover, you are able to see orchids from everywhere, loved the Princess Diana orchid."
,,Beautiful landscaping and experience,4.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is beautiful, but unless you are a flower or orchid fanatic you may not enjoy.

They do have nice restrooms and snack bar which are both very clean."

,,National Orchid Garden Singapore,5.0,,"Oh what a beautiful place. We visited the gardens on October 26th, a lovely warm and sunny day. I have never seen so many beautiful flowers in one place. Very friendly layout especially for the disabled and the VIP garden was fabulous. The Princess Diana orchid ( recently visited by William and Kate) was still in flower and so pretty. The facillities were very good and the gift shop is well worth a visit. A lovely day and we enjoyed the rest of the Botanical gardens as well"

,,Beautiful and a must see!,5.0,,"Cheap entry, catch a bus from the city. Get there early (it opens at 8.30am) and avoid the heat. Give yourself at least 1 hour to see the whole garden. Don't miss the VIP garden at the back with orchards that have been bred specifically for foreign celebrities, politicians and public figures."
,,possibly the nicest Orchid Garden Ive seen,5.0,,"Truly amazing! Prepare for staying a bit longer than intended. Bring a good umbrella, as rains in Singapore can be long and intensive!"
,,Over rated destination,3.0,,"Just FYI - The orchid gardens are a small part of a huge (and lovely) garden. Would take atleast half a day to see it all. An MRT station is located right in the garden.

It was a looong walk to the Orchid gardens.We reached there in the nick of time .The orchid garden ticket window is suppossed to close by 6.00 pm but was open till around 6.30 pm.Liked the landscaping of the whole garden and the relaxed air of families visiting it .The Orchid Gardens were rich in varieties of Orchids.(We arent ardent orchid fans as such) There were specific spots developed for photography in midst of the flowers.

But the weather was too hot to be comfortable.Also as vegetarians, we couldn't get any food except fruit slices at the food court.The only Indian food place , which served a few veg items was closed by 8.00 pm.

Overall a nice place if you have ample time. But not a can't miss it attraction."
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"Inside the Singapore Botanic Gardens, this is a magnificent collection of over 1000 species and 2000 hybrids. Take a nice slow stroll in the heat and humidity and let your eyes feast on the variety before you. So many differing orchid types, so many beautiful colours. It is obvious why this is such an attraction in a city of so many attractions. Easy to reach using the super transportation system that Singapore enjoys. Great for the serious gardener, the novice and those who just like flowers."
,,Beautiful Garden,5.0,,If Orchids are your thing this is your Valhalla. Even if they are not you cannot help but getting caught up in the beauty of the place.
,,VIP orchids are fun,4.0,,special hybrids for VIPs; check out Margaret Thatcher and Princess Diana. You can lose yourself in the beautiful environment of these gardens.
,,Orchid Gardens,5.0,,Wonderful display. Value for money - a must visit. I would come again when in Singapore. Nothing to complain about.
,,"beautiful garden, full of sunshine and clean air",5.0,,was very nice walk among the beautiful interesting flowers. Has some places to relax and enjoy the gardens
,,Lovely Gardens & Shop,5.0,,The gardens were well spread out but well labelled. Unfortunately the rain marred a bit more exploring but in the end I was happy to browse in the well stocked shop. Lovely orchids.
,,Beautiful but hot,4.0,,The orchid garden is located within the Botanical garden and well worth the $5 admission fees. The varieties of orchids are stupendous. The highlight for children is the cool house which features some extrardinary tropical plants especially the flesh eating varieties such as the pitcher plants. Beware though of the heat in the afternoons as there is a long walk to get to the garden. Best time to visit - Early Mornings.
,,Oasis,4.0,,Well worth the visit but go after all the coach parties have been as it gets very busy and noisy in the mornings. Take a bottle of water which you can refill on site. Didn't realise that there were so many different types of orchids that flower at different times
,,Great (if you like flowers),5.0,,"I've never seen so many beautiful orchids before, it was such a pleasure! Really nice (but hot) to walk around the gardens and just enjoy."
,,Very pleasant,5.0,,"Although not a ""garden person"" this was very well laid out in very pleasant surroundings. There is also a food court in the park"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"If you are into flowers especially Orchids do not miss the National Orchid Garden located in the Botanic Gardens.

Our visit was just after a rain storm which made the flowers shine and look magnificent. There is a charge to visit the Orchid gardens but for only 1 Singapore dollar for over 60's this is very good value. They took my word that I was over 60 and did not even have to produce my UK concessionary bus pass to prove this! If I can remember rightly the normal adult fee is 5 Singapore dollars.

The Orchid centre is well documented with pick up routes to follow and well laid out for wheel chair access. Various areas are sign posted with direction markers along the routes."
,,Simply wonderful :),5.0,,"Even if you are not into flowers, this place will surely captivate you. There is a huge selection of orchids, well-maintained to perfection.
Took the bus number 7 from Dhoby Ghaut area and was dropped near the Botanic gardens. Much better than doing it via the Metro as by bus you are dropped close to the Garden gates. Rained a little bit but still enjoyable in the rains :) A Must-see"
,,Blooming marvelouse,5.0,,We spent a good few hours wandering round these agradens and they were well worth the visit. They were well laid out and well kept
,,A must see for orchid lovers,5.0,,"Situated within the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the national orchid garden is spectacular. There is a $5 entry fee but well worth it. Walkways are easy to navigate and accessible to all. The individual attractions within the garden are well signposted. If you enjoy orchids or gardens, this is a lovely way to spend a few hours. We acessed the gardens via the hop on hop off tourist bus which calls past every 20 minutes."
,,Stunning - even in the rain,5.0,,"Caught taxi from Orchard Rd to the Orchid Garden, it was very inexpensive (less than $8 SGD), unfortunately not as easy to get taxi back, there is a taxi rank at the visitor centre of the national botanic gardens (an easy walk from the Orchid Garden) but few taxis turned up in peak hour. The Orchid Garden entry fee is very reasonable, the garden is extensive with lots of different attractions (a Cold House with cooler climate species and carnivorous plants, VIP orchid area, heritage species, misted area etc). The design of the gardens, and the paths around the various areas are all immaculate and there are beautiful flowers everywhere. Our visit unfortunately coincided with late Spring rain and although we got fairly we a couple of times, there were regular shelters and it didn't take long for us to dry off (we weren't prepared and hadn't brought an umbrella).

There were seats or benches positioned throughout the gardens enabling you to soak up the peacefullness & beauty.

,,Gorgeous but hot!,5.0,,"Definitely my favorite place at the botanical gardens. Absolutely beautiful! and an excellent place for photos! with lots of ""photo op"" areas with benches and such.

It was hot when we were there. I have two recommendations. Bring water, and bring a small towel to wipe away sweat. The bathrooms do not offer towels, and we had nothing with us, so our only option was toilet paper, which doesn't work extremely well."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Excellent surroundings and an escape from the modern image of Singapore. Well worth a look as the majority is free. Be careful of the weather although there is plenty of shelter, but will disrupt your visit as it did mine."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The MRT dropped us right outside so there was no struggle to find the place. Just follow the sign for it.

Don't forget your sunglasses, hats and umbrellas as it is quite open for some of the walk.

There are multiple park maps as you walk around which make the trip very easy-going and simple to navigate.

There are birds and turtles and other interesting wildlife scattered around the gardens. My bf and i were keeping our eyes peeled for the giant monitor lizards the gardens claim to be home to but, alas, we did not see one!

The park is enormous with different areas of interest such as the ginger garden, the orchid garden, the remedy garden etc. The tracks lead from little winding trails through dense shrubbery to wide plazas around big lakes and fields for children to play.

It was a lovely, peaceful place with a variety of different plants and animals and it just looked fabulous."

,,Paradise on earth,5.0,,Sublimely beautiful. The flowers are out of this world and the garden so well tended and imaginatively planted.

,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"We visited the Orchid Gardens at the start of this month, just 1 week after Will & Kate were there.

,,Superb,5.0,,My wife thought she was in heaven !! This was part of an included tour in our package. A bit hilly in places but fully disabled access well signposted
,,Just beautiful!,5.0,,"There is a small entry fee of 5 Singapore dollars (approx £2.50) and worth every penny! Felt like you were wondering around an enchanted garden with winding paths and waterfalls. There is a small cold house and another building which we didn't have time to explore. Lots of fantastic settings for photos and lots to look at. Some plants were in bud and about to flower and some were just past but there was still plenty to look at and I think that would be the case at any time of year.

If I ever return to Singapore again, I will be revisiting these beautiful gardens."
,,For Orchid Lovers,5.0,,All the different types of orchids in 1 place. Also uncommon hybrids. A must visit for orchid lovers. Friendly staff around if you need directions to get around the big place. Nice getaway from the busy Orchard Road nearby.
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"The beauty of the different orchids took your breath away! I never realised there were so many! It is quite a walk from the main entrance to the Botanical Gardens and most of the paths are in direct sun, so it was very hot when we were there, so take an umbrella if you don't like the sun :) Oh and lots of water!"
,,For Orchid Lover,4.0,,"Located inside of Botanic garden, you can see many orchid beautifully maintained. There are a Mist house and a cool house. Its better to visit in the morning or in the afternoon since its quite hot in singapore."

,,Well worth the entrance price,5.0,,"After a walk around the botanical gardens I wasn't sure if I wanted to pay the $5 entry fee but I'm certainly glad I did!!

The orchid garden has some of the most beautiful orchids I have ever seen. I could have spent all day there and only wish I had more time.

The variety of species is impressive. I particularly enjoyed the mist house. I highly recommend a visit. It's a nice break from the hustle of the city and may be one of the most beautiful sights to see in Singapore."
,,lovely flowers,4.0,,I really enjoy the atmosphere of this orchid garden: small paths and great diversity. It's a perfect addition to the botanic garden to make your special one feel happy. Worth a visit!!! (maybe not a trip though)
,,Serene with lots of variety. A calm place in the bustling city.,4.0,,"At only a $5 entry fee, this is a great place to take a serenity break.

,,"Nicely arranged for sure, but too crowded",3.0,,"Obviously here is a garden which has required a lot of efforts to be designed and realised. Great to visit if you like to be guided around crowded tracks which leave little space tothe relaxed discovery of various types of gardens, tropical, mediterranean, elevated, etc. Avoid if, like me, you prefer gardens to be natural, large, and allowing solitary and quiet walks around..."
,,You have never seen so many orchid at the same day and soo beautiful!,5.0,,You can walk in the garden for a hole day and have still not seen everything so take another day and dont forgett the camera!
,,"Stunning place, well worth the price of admission",5.0,,"I'm not a flowers person but I LOVE this garden. There are so many gorgeous varieties of orchids. We spent a couple of hours wandering around this garden, but you can easily spend a few more hours.

The SG$5/person entry fee was very reasonable."
,,Surround yourself with beautiful and exotic Orchids,4.0,,"I went to the Orchid Garden with a group tour and was surprised by the many variety of orchids in the garden!

,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,I have visited many gardens and this one is just beautiful. It is very well landscaped and easy to walk around. It is attached to the Botanical Gardens so you could easily spend half a day or longer here. We travelled here on the MRT and then spent a couple of hours in the Orchid Garden. Our children (10 and13) also enjoyed it as there are just so many different orchids- wonderful photo opportunities and many shaded areas.
,,A must see,5.0,,"It's big, beautiful, and easily accessible from downtown Singapore. My wife and I found countless photo ops while walking the grounds which are landscaped to perfection."

,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,This garden is LOADED with beautiful blooming orchids of every color and size. To see them growing attached to tree trunks was amazing.

,,"Beautiful, peaceful and stunning",5.0,,"We caught a cab from our hotel which cost around $20 and spent a lovely 3 hours strolling through the beautiful gardens. The orchids are set amongst other tropical plants, fountains and along pathways which makes every turn a new surprise.

We stopped at the cafe for a snack and picked up souvenirs at the gift shop.
Well worth the visit even for those with a mild interest in orchids."
,,Nice garden!,4.0,,Very good place to view various plants and flowers. I've been there with my friend and she was totally astonished by the scenery. A lot of photo spots and beautiful flowers to take pictures with. Make sure you wear enough sun cream and a big hat to avoid the blistering sunlight.

,,A VERY HOT DAY,4.0,,We arrived on the MRT and didn't realise there was such a long walk through the botanical gardens before we got to the orchid garden. It was a very hot day and a taxi to the entrance closer by would have been better. With 2 young children it was a bit of a struggle. The orchid garden was nice and wish we could have seen more in cooler weather. There was a nice building in the centre and a small cool house which offered a bit of a relief but no seats anywhere. We had some drinks at the cafe outside by the entrance which was nice.
,,Not just for flower people!,5.0,,"Yes, there's an abundance of orchids in all shapes/sizes/colors (many with information next to them with the history of how they were created), but there are also other plants/flowers there as well as a ""cool house"" with interesting species like pitcher plants and venus flytraps.

,,Take time to smell the...orchids...,5.0,,"The garden is very easy to get to and has a beautiful display of orchids. The grounds are very well maintained. It's a real oasis close to the centre of the city. The onsite shop has a great selection of worthwhile jewelry, including jewelry made from orchids, to bring back home as a reminder of a special place."
,,I like flowers,5.0,,"Singapore National Orchid Garden boasts the largest display of tropical orchids in the world. I was most impressived with four separate colour zones over most of its areas :the ""spring"" zone with its prevailing colours of bright and lively shades of gold, yellow and creams; the ""summer"" zone with its major tones of strong reds and pinks; the ""autumn"" zone of matured shades; and the ""winter"" zone of whites and cool blues. The colour zonation is achieved by a careful blend of selected trees, shrubs, herbs and orchids (mostly hybrids) with matching foliage and floral colours."
,,Orchids ARE Singapore,5.0,,"Because of Singapore's weather, orchids grow like weeds. So you can imagine just how lovely an orchid garden here will be. If you love orchids, you will not be disappointed. Truly splendid."

,,'Real-ly' beautiful,5.0,,There is something unbelievable about real orchids because the fake ones are so darn good. The National Orchid Garden gets it right because the orchids are growing in totally natural environments - not stuck in a cheesy vase. It's worth seeing orchids where they are growing so naturally.

,,"Excellent value, great displays and well labelled plants",5.0,,"Easy to get to (adjacent to Botanic Garden), excellent value and plants are very well labelled. There were so many in flower and so well displayed. If you like orchids you must visit this garden."

,,Average Value,3.0,,"It is beautiful to see all kinds of orchids and other flowers but I expected something more. I didn't visit the Botanic Gardens but i think that you can see the orchids from the National Orchid Garden also at The Botanic Gardens, so i don't think it worths the money."
,,An oasis of calm,5.0,,"It would appear that September is not the best month as they await the monsoons, I believe, but there is still plenty to see."
,,Must visited one,5.0,,"My Mom & I visited this garden 2 weeks ago. And it is awesome!!! My mom felt like she was lost in wonderland already. Well, rain shower quite disturb us at that time but it's nature :)"

,,Gorgeous Garden,5.0,,"I had never seen orchids growing in a garden before. They are so beautiful ""in the wild"". There are so many varities in this garden. You try to pick a favourite - but it is impossible. It was super hot when I went there - I was dying to accidently walk in front of the gardener as he misted the plants! haha
There is a charge to enter - but it's totally worth it."
,,Not in season,4.0,,Good break from the busy city life. Although it seems that the orchids are not in season in September.
,,A parallel universe!,5.0,,Very nicely maintained a total oasis in the middle of a very busy city! Not to be missed and it's free!!!!!!
,,A highlight of Singapore,5.0,,"I last visited eight years ago and it was still as fabulous as I remembered it. The maintenance of the grounds is impeccable and the displays are dazzling. Everything is well-labeled with more information than I could possibly absorb in a day. I made it my first stop during my stay in Singapore and it put me in a good mood for the entire visit. It's next to the Botanic Garden, so plan on spending the good part of a leisurely day there. It can be reached by bus."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"If you love flowers, and especially orchids, this place is a must to visit. I never knew there were so many types of orchids, and each more lovely than the last.

Highly recommended to make a day of it and visit both the Botanic Gardens and the Orchid Garden, and don't forget to take a camera!!"
,,Singapore Trip is incomplete without Orchid Garden,5.0,,"When we strolled through royal botanical park & we were almost lost in Orchid garden in it. First we decided to spend around ½ hrs in botanical garden but tempting orchids extended our stay there almost by 2 hrs. The orchid garden is one of the biggest & best on earth. This was first times we watched felt & smelled these many different kinds of orchids with different colors, shapes, sizes & smells! This visit is must not only for ladies or flower/nature lovers but for everybody who would like to get amazed on colors, smell & feast to all senses."
,,The most amazing garden!,5.0,,I definitely recommend to visit the orchid garden. Beautiful flowers and wonderful scents! we spent a lot of hours admiring the unique flowers
,,Very Beautiful,5.0,,it has amazing plants and flowers. The Orchids are very fresh and smelly. The garden has a very beautiful views for taking photo.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,We used a volunteer guide and he (Edward) had so much more to offer than just looking at flowers. He had a great sense of humor and quite a bit of practical experience to share wit hour group. (about 7 of us).
,,kiwi experience,5.0,,I found these gardens to be well laid out with good labeling & direction indicators. It was exceptionally tidy & Well worth the entrance fee. The thousands of plants were all at their peak & there were plenty of seats & shade cover. I loved the mist & cool houses. As a visitor from New Zealand I found the whole experience unforgettable.
,,Great place to see some amazing flowers,5.0,,Always worth the visit! The great variety of orchids are stunning to see and the overall layout of the park area is pleasing. Because it is a short walk from the MRT to the park it is helpful to bring some fluids with you.
,,Orchid Garden visit,4.0,,"Although it looks to be quite small from outside, don't be fooled! There are literally hundreds of species of orchid in this garden & they are beautiful. The garden itself if very well maintained & they have done a really amazing job of laying out the grounds & creating specific areas. For the bargain price of S$5 (about £2.50 at the minute) it's well worth a visit."
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,Botanical Gardens is easily to get to. Just board the hop on hop off tourist bus and it drops you off at the gardens and will pick up up again. The Orchid Garden was in full bloom and very beautiful
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"A great day out, especially the ginger plants, make sure that the camera battery is fully charged because you will be taking plenty of shots."
,,Beautiful gardens and position,4.0,,Mostly orchids which were beautiful. Well kept and could spend a day there relaxing. Not sure about entry fee as we went on an organised trip but must be quite mobile as hilly to see everything.
,,beautiful orchids,5.0,,orchids are breath taking. lovely walk around this garden.we go every time we visit singapore never get fed up looking at beautiful blooms a lot named after famous people such as the late princess of wales
,,"Dozens of Orchids, easy to see, nice to smell, hard to leave...",5.0,,"I had only about 2 hours for the National Orchid Garden visit. I spent there 3 hours and I wish to be there at least 4 of 5 hours. It is great place to admire the beauty of nature. I saw some orchids in the wild nature, some in other botanical gardens but this is absolutely fantastic and ""must see"" in Singapur. There are so many types of plants, many colors, many shapes.. Take your camera, go there during the sunny day and make many pictures. Those fragile plants are worth to be photographed. Ask for student discount with you ISIC card. And don't forget to smile :-)."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,My parents raised orchids so I was especially charmed by this garden. Amazing orchids. There's a section of orchids named for celebrities who have visited the garden...it was nicely done..
,,Fantastic,5.0,,If you like flowers and gardens this is a must. The cafe by the main gardens entrance is excellent too for breakfast and other meals. Go early in the day as it gets hot.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This was part of our city tour. I loved it, it's vast and absolutely beautiful. We were on a limited time schedule but you could easily spend the day there with children and a picnic. It's only $5 for admission which is an absolute bargain. Please do try to fit it into your itinery."
,,fantastic,5.0,,"We loved it here. The gardens are beautiful, relaxing and well-maintained. Amazing variety of orchids."
,,Fantastic!!!!!!!!,5.0,,What an experience - not to be missed - stunning - so beautiful - - great place to spend a morning or an afternoon. Didn't realise there so many orchids
,,Very nice place,4.0,,"Great variety of interesting orchids, a must see when in Botanic Gardens. However not much time needed, just walk about it once"
,,Excellent,5.0,,This is an excellent garden with every possible type of orchid. We spent several hours here and loved all that we saw. The garden was beautifully presented with excellent descriptions of all the different orchids.
,,Be ready to compete with the tour groups,4.0,,"Lots of nice orchids. Lots of tour groups arriving on buses, need to find chances to take photos without others competing!"
,,Still find it stunning even after a dozen visits,5.0,,"One of my favourite places in Singapore, the sheer volume and vibrancy of the colours smacks you in the face the moment you walk in and barely lets up until you depart. There are hundreds or thousands of different varieties of orchids (and gingers and other tropical plants), each one appearing brighter than the one before, truly a great showcase.

Highlights include the VIP orchids (where William and Kate visited), the cycads, the mist house (the most intense colour festival of all) and the cool room. See them all!

The only slight issue, as with all outdoor attractions in Singapore, is how to deal with the heat. It's best to take a cab to/from the main entrance and visitor centre at the junction of Cluny and Nassim Roads, as this gives the shortest and shadiest walk to the gardens (go through the rainforest walk for choice) and there's a cafe at the visitor centre. I'd also recommend going early morning or late afternoon when it's cooler and more shaded: the only problem with the Orchid Garden is that it is very open to the sun and unbearably hot in the middle of the day if you give it as much time as it deserves."
,,A visit to be remembered,5.0,,A beautifull garden with outstanding plants in a superb setting. The cost is minimal and the whole experiance is uplifting.
,,Worth a look,5.0,,"I visited the Orchid Garden as part of a tour, so I only had limited time there. It's very well layed out and has a great variety of orchids - as one would expect. The cool room was a very welcome surprise, it's for the orchids that need a cooler temperature, but it was also very nice for the hot tourists"
,,This place was amazing!,5.0,,Just the most varied and beautiful gardens ever! Don't miss this attraction...you will be glad that you saw it. The colors and varieties are exquisite!
,,"Gorgeous, hundreds of different orchids.",5.0,,We did this with the Botanical garden trip. This orchid garden is very well laid out. Seating avaliable to enjoy the views. Many different kinds and sizes of orchids was as eye opener. Very pleasnt experience.
,,Orchid Garden,5.0,,I didnt know there are so many different types of Orchids. Beautiful lovely garden to walk around. so glad we went.
,,Tranquility,4.0,,Very peaceful and calming place to spend some time. Amused me to compare the VIP orchids appearance to the style of the VIP honoured
,,Outstanding,5.0,,At $1 (for over 60s) this is fantastic value. Don't miss the cool house that recreates the environment of the cloud zone on mountains.
,,"If you are not a massive fan, do not waste your time!",3.0,,"I went to Botanical gardens and the Orchid garden (5$ extra for that part) on a saturday midday. It was a total waste of time and it is such a long walk from the train station, I literally sweat 5 litres when I get there.
If you are not a massive fan do not waste your day to go here. I am sure its nice for a picnic or something but not for everyone (definitely it wasn't for me)"
,,Magical,5.0,,"Its hard to describe this experience as the Botanical Gardens and in particular the Orchid Garden have such a magical feel to them. It's a place that instantly makes you feel relaxed and happy. The flowers are wonderful and there are so many different interesting elements to the garden. The gardeners working away look so content in their work. If you are an avid photographer with a macro lense there are lots of opportunities for you here. The gardens overall cover a substantial area so if you are pushed for time it's well worth paying the $5 entry fee for the Orchid Garden. Symphony Lake is next to it and in my view those are the best areas of the Botanic Gardens. I would also recommend lunch at Villa Halia in the Ginger garden next to the Orchids on week days. Not cheap but absolutely wonderful - we ate there outside, the service and food were wonderful and there were squirrels playing in the trees behind us. Whole experience was magical"
,,Orchid garden,5.0,,Spent a great few houris . Rained for twenty minutes but met so many. People in a little shelter it added to te holiday .did not visit new gardens by the bay but was delighted with this place
,,A must,5.0,,"If your time is limited for visiting the Botanical Garden, then just go for the National Orchid Garden inside the Botanical Garden. Entrance is 5.00 Sin$"
,,A beautiful place for a morning outing,5.0,,The plantings are fantastic and the variety of flowers seen was incredible. Take water though. It gets hot. There is a small entrance fee. We particularly enjoyed the CoolHouse and thought it was a great precurser to our visit to the Gardens by the Bay.
,,Stunning,5.0,,We grow orchids ourselves and were excited to see the many beautiful variations. An extra cost but we felt it was worth it.
,,Orchids...orchids and more orchids.,4.0,,A fascinating collection of orchids. The whole place is well set ot and the collection of orchilds is truly breath taking.
,,Don't miss it!,5.0,,"You don't have to be a flower-lover or keen gardener to appreciate this place. The colours and beauty of the orchids will blow you away! Even tho the entrance fee is only $5, our senior status got us in for $1 each and it was easily the best dollar ever spent! If you get too hot wandering around, head to the ""Cool Room"" for a brief respite, some interesting plants in here too."
,,You must visit if you have the time,5.0,,"The garden is part of the Botanic Gardens which is also world class. the Orchid gardens are laid out over a reasonable area but it does have areas only really accessible by steps (or extremely long detours in the Singapore heat).

The variety of plants and the stunning flowers that are on show through out the year are amazing and the sent from many are a smell to experience.

These gardens do have a small fee, I can't remember now ~ maybe $5, but if you like plants (you went to the Botanics to get here) it is well worth the small price.

Enjoy and tell your friends."
,,For the Flower Lover!,5.0,,"I never fully appreciated the beauty and color of the Orchid until I visited the National Orchid Garden. The many colors and varieties were amazing and there is a good mix of cultivated showy displays and naturalized displays to enjoy. A little hot in Singapore, but well worth the effort."
,,Simply beautiful,5.0,,So many picture taking opportunities and worth the small entrance fee. We easily spent a couple of hours viewing the various types of orchids on display.
,,Beautiful species,5.0,,"Orchids, the national flower are just beautiful and there are so many different varieties to see in the gardens. Entry is S$5. It was lovely to learn about how the different varieties are blended"
,,National Orchid Garden,4.0,,"The flowers were beautiful. I was on a city tour, so did not have as much time to spend as I had hoped. Also it was raining pretty heavily -- still it was a very pretty place"
,,again and again a must see,5.0,,"we've been here plenty of times, its the best orchid garden in the world with 100s of different orchids in a gorgeous setting"
,,Orchid Garden not to be missed,5.0,,definitely highlight of visit to Singapore - $1 entry for seniors! amazing variety of orchids with great photo opportunities in the mass of colour.
,,Just got in before Kate and William entourage,5.0,,"Spectacular! Saw some beautiful orchards and ginger. Spend 2 hours here and leave the world behind. Beauty every where,"
,,Beautiful tranquil area of Singapore,5.0,,Love it here a photographers and horticulturalists paradise and the rest of the botanical gardens are lovely and tranquil as well again get there by taxi or MRT.
,,Wonderland,4.0,,"I visited this site with no great expectation as I thought it could be a tourist trap, with a couple of plants and a lot of souvenir shops.
Instead these gardens dispay an immense variety of Orchids, the landscape is amazing and relaxing and you would like to remain there forever. Even if you can see the immense work of the lansdcape architects, there is nothing fake in it. And considering the number of lizards that crossed my way, I guess that Mother Nature agrees."
,,Excellent but tiring,5.0,,"Liked how well the garden was set up and maintained. I only went as courtesy to one other in our party and while I was glad I went, I wouldn't rush back. It is an orchid garden. I spent a bit of time in the cool garden room, it was very humid outside."
,,"Go, it's one of the Singapore's most beautiful places",5.0,,I was in this lovely place and if you are visiting this beautiful city don't miss the occasion and go to visit this very touristic attractions.
,,Very good value for money for those appreciating plants,5.0,,"The entrance fee is quite cheap at 5 dollars for adults.
The first part of the Orchid garden is indeed an area where orchids created for personnalities are exposed. It is amazing to see the diversity of flowers and blooms and how they can reflect the character of the person the orchids should impersonate.
The second part include a few very large hothouses with local lush vegetation, some of them with mist and rain, some drier.
I've been there 3 to 4 times already and would recommand all visitors to go there."
,,Many Beautiful Orchids,4.0,,As Orchid growers we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The colours and plant types were overwhelming. We recommend a visit to all that have an interest in orchids.
,,A must for orchid lovers,5.0,,Beautiful orchid gardens impeccably maintained. I found the historic section very interesting as well as the display on hybrids named after visiting dignitaries. I only stayed an hour but could have easily spent two or more wandering about.
,,Not to be missed if you like flowers,5.0,,This is a must if you have any interest at all in plants and gardens. The VIP orchids amused me - Margaret Thatcher's orchid was far too quirky and frivolous looking to suit her. Nelson Mandela's didn't match the greatness of the man.
,,orchids a must see at BOTANICAL GARDENS,5.0,,colours of all shades also look in unexpected areas ie up trees they were a delight to see an walk among
,,Incredible !,5.0,,"Two hours visit plus over three hundred photographs of Orchids, we also purchased some Orchid Plants but at the main entrance since they are much cheaper than in the Orchid Garden shop."
,,relaxing!,4.0,,"evrythng abt it is divine! could not get over the fact that it""s in the middle of cosmopolitan singapore :) cool house is indeed cool! many photo opportunities even if not flower enthusiast dislike: no cafe within the compound :)"
,,Peaceful and relaxing,5.0,,"I recently made my second trip to the National Orchid Garden. The first trip, four years ago, was washed out by torrential rain, but this time the weather was much more favourable and I enjoyed it more.

The variety of orchids here is amazing, and it is such a tranquil setting in an otherwise somewhat relentless city. A visit to the Cool House (greenhouse) is well worth it to escape the heat for a few minutes.

The Singapore Airlines Hopper bus brought me directly to the entrance gate and back to the city. I'm sure that other hop-on hop-off style buses do the same. The entrance fee is really cheap.

Well worth the visit!"
,,Do you love orchids,3.0,,"If you love orchids, it's worth it. To an uncultured slob like me it is simply another flower. However, it is well laid out and the signage is good."
,,tranquility and beuatiful,5.0,,These garden full with all kind of orchids is really beautifull. Just wander around between the orchids and check out the misty greenhouse where you cool down with the orchids.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Make sure you visit this place, its a very nice place to see as most of singapore is very smoggy. We caught a cab from our hotel direct"
,,must like orchids,5.0,,"There were over 150 different types of orchids at this garden, some of the best sequestered in the special national orchid area. Though gardeners will delight at the opportunity to view orchids named after the wives of ex-ambassadors, other, non-gardeners will be busily looking for the nearest exit or stiff drink. Great gift shop has some really nice silk prints and preserved orchids."
,,Miraculous!,5.0,,"I've never seen so many orchids in my life. If you are interested in flowers at all, this is a must."
,,plain green and color-FULL,5.0,,"I stop and breath.
Botanic gardens mrt station. Look to the left and to my right. oh i see there it is. ""National Botanical Garden"" -- but i wont be talkin about this beautiful place instead I`m going to get you a glimpse of what a paradise might look like..

I love walking so from the mrt station I took the energy draining, sweat pumping road to the orchid garden and in which by the way would be totally worth it.

I was welcomed by the beautiful mix of colors of the orchids on the sign board against the evergreen background.

You cant smell the flower really coz, sometimes they dont have the smell or sometimes its very faint, but still when you see them you get the feeling that the air smells sweet and every thing around you is sweet.

i cant name all the flowers that my eyes marveled upon because it would be up to you to see them yourselves, you can make up names for them if you want to. It would be unfair for the orchids and that garden to be described in worlds we humans use, its just they are so natural so fresh, a wonderful sight. The numerous array of colors are so pleasing to the eyes. That you need to be aware of your time coz you might stay half an hour gazing at a little orchid (which nearly happened to me).

lastly, please if you are going to visit the orchids, don`t forget to charge the cameras battery you might end up crying because your not even halfway and the cam is dead.
Enjoy.

by the way if you are a couple this is a romantic place.
if your a family this is wonderfully, educational, stress free environment.
but for me who went SOLO its so beautiful that sometimes it becomes sad. but still i recommend goin there solo, a place to unwind and clear our heads up.

ohh yeah dont forget to bring water and money, theres a nice little souvenir shop at the exit.. and you would love the real flowers on glass cases."
,,Worthy of a vist,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanical Garden grounds are very nice and you can do a lot of walking in the shade. The Orchid Garden is a sep exhibit within the Botanical Gardens. It is lovely and I always make sure to take any visiting family and friends to have a look. As others have said, it is well maintained. The Bot Gardens is open till late at night and that is also a nice time to walk through escaping the sun. You can purchase drinks inside so need to bring if you prefer not to carry. The grounds are quite large. The Orchid exh has a small fee, but the Bot Gardens are free. Nice sidewalks; easy to push a stroller."
,,Lovely gardens,5.0,,The National Orchid Garden has many beautiful flowers on display. The garden is impeccably maintained and the flowers look too good to be real but also too good to be fake. Really beautiful.
,,Just Beautiful!,5.0,,Amazing massive variety of orchids beyond imagination. Plenty of photographic opportunities. One of the highlights of our trip. Dont miss it.
,,Brilliant way to spend a few hours,5.0,,"My wife and I visited here whilst in the Botanical Gardens and it was, spectacular and extremely colourful. Very good value too."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,Wonderful displays of colour. Ticket price concessions for seniors. A long walk from the MRT station.
,,"Amazing, so many different kinds",5.0,,"There was an enterance fee to the orchid garden, but the botanical gardens are free and worth a visit"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,We were only in Singapore for an overnight stay but wanted to see as much of the city as we could in one day. We took a city tour which included a visit to the National Orchid Garden. It was one of the best parts of the tour-even for one not so interested in flowers. Beautiful.
,,flower lovers are wellcome,5.0,,please my advice is visit in the morning session as the days pass by it is extremely hot and humid Singapore National Orchid Garden is a paradise in its own bright. Lots of beautiful orchids and an amazing landscape makes this site a good escape from the hustle and bustle of city living. Do visit and take in some of its magnificent scenic views. Definitely recommend
,,very emotional,5.0,,"Its relativly small, but the museum is informative and very graffic in what happened here. its housed in an old colonial building which is still attached to an opperating prison. The chaple is reverent and solom and merly sitting in it makes you well with sorrow. Its quite an effort to get there but easy with train and bus. a real worth while trip,"
,,One of the Must Sees when in Singapore,5.0,,Absolutely lovely even for a non-gardener like me! Take your camera as you will want to photograph nearly every variety of orchid you come across during your visit.
,,Most beautiful garden I have ever been to....,5.0,,Terrifically maintained and it's like walking through a rainforest of all these beautiful and exotic flowers.
,,"Beautiful orchids, well maintained. Affordable ticket price.",4.0,,Always love visiting Orchid Garden. This garden is well maintained. A great place to spend the weekends with family.
,,Stunning garden,5.0,,If you like plants and flowers you will love this. Stunning collection of orchids and other plants set in a beautifully landscaped garden. Well worth a visit.
,,Surprising!,5.0,,My parents came to visit us in Singapore and really wanted to visit and I was thoroughly impressed with the design and variety of the gardens. It's a truly beautiful space. We were in awe of the diversity of the orchids and their characteristics. Must see!
,,Lovely visit,5.0,,"Visited Orchid Garden during a recent short stay, this would be the highlight of our sightseeing - a fabulous array of flora and fauna superbly maintained. Well worth a visit"
,,Getting to understand the National Flower of Singapore,4.0,,"The national orchid garden of Singapore is located in the Singapore Botanical Gardens. It is closer to the symphony orchestra stage carpark and by there the walk is shorter than if you parked at the main gate carpark. The garden is not very big, you can complete the walk within an hour.

Entry tickets for adults cost $5, for PR and Singaporeans there is a promotional discount of 15%. For local students and senior citizens there is a concession rate of $1. That price will only be given by flashing a valid card or pass.

Inside the orchid garden, there is quite a few photo spots designed for visitors to take a few photos. You can find a cooling room mimicking the environment of the mountainous areas of southeast asia.

Mosquitoes are not a huge problem, but for tourist who are not used to the humidity be prepared to bring a towel or two and don't forget to drink up!"
,,Sensational,5.0,,"Worth every cent of the admission price.

There are so many different areas of the garden to visit, each area has its own 'theme'. I suggets you go early, partly to get out of the humidity (we went in August and not too bad) but the crowds increase around late morning, making getting that special photo harder - and there are plenty of opportunties.

When we got back to the hotel I downloaded the photos we took onto the laptop - 394 !!!"
,,great relaxing place,5.0,,"lovely place, amazing grounds, free entry i think, stopped off unintentionally as the hop on bus stopped here for a change over, well worth a visit,"
,,Beautiful Orchids,5.0,,"The Orchid Gardens are in the Botanic Gardens and are quite stunning in range and variety, there are new/special varieties name after visiting dignitaries such as Margaret Thatcher."
,,A gem within the Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"The Orchid Garden is within the Botanic Garden grounds. Individually both are worth the trip. I spent about 2 hours walking through the Botanic Gardens and 2 hours within the Orchid Garden which is stunning. One fantastic setting after another. My only disappointment was the tablet I was using for pictures did not have a zoom. By far, my favorite attraction in Singapore.

I took the MRT and a bus from the Marina Bay area. Took about 40 minutes. A cab is probably worth the cost."
,,Beautifull,5.0,,Last day of our trip was in Orchid Garden. I love flowers and i think i had a good change to see all the different orchids in one place. Weather was hot but some sitting place they made is quite and very comforting.
,,Lovely Orchids everywhere,4.0,,"Heaven for orchid lovers I imagine. Not for everyone. If you're not into orchids, don't come here, you might get bored."
,,Understandable Why It's Still #1 Singapore Attraction,5.0,,"Spent several hours with a good camera and macro taking some very stunning shots of all the various flowers and yes, Orchids. There is a nominal $5SD fee to enter from the Botanical Gardens but its the best $5SD and 2-hours you can spend in Singapore.

Tip: I would recommend a monopod or tripod though tripods are tough to travel with. The three main areas are dim but not dark BUT many shots are below 1/30th second. A cheap monopod and a camera with stablization makes some very good pictures to bring home vs. a lot of blurry ones."
,,Some beautiful flowers but preferred the botanic gardens.,3.0,,"I dont think it's worth paying in to see the orchids. Maybe it was just the time of year we were there but there were lots of orchids which hadn't yet bloomed. Got bored after 10mins of looking at orchids. Stay in the botanic gardens instead, much more to see and do."
,,Stunning displays,5.0,,The displays of orchids at the National Orchid garden really are stunning. Fantastic arrangement and well worth the visit.
,,Out of this world,5.0,,Being a city child I am always amazed by nature. Well here it is at its best. You'll need a full day to see it all but it is well worth it. The variety of Orchids is unbeliavable and the whole set up of the surroundings is impressive.
,,Fantastic layout,5.0,,"Loved all the orchids cultivated and named for visitors and guests of honor, and the cool greenhouse."
,,Blooms,4.0,,"Meandering through the Orchid Gardens I mentally applauded the Singapore government for this immaculate gem. The gardens are clean,very well maintained & are a shutterbugs' delight.

Patient, painstaking cross breeding has resulted in breathtaking colors & hues. Information about these elegant blooms is plentyful & interesting.
The Mist House has a fascinating array of blooms while the Cool House recreates a tropical forest environment & houses some carnivorous plants .
.
One can reach the gardens by bus, taxi & metro.An MRT interchange under construction will ensure better connectivity. The venue is wheelchair friendly.

On my last visit I discovered August is not the best time to visit as there are very few flowers."
,,Who knew there were that many orchids,4.0,,We had a free day and decided to head to the botanic gardens and the orchid garden. We had a lovely afternoon and were pleasantly surprised. Plenty of good walking trails. You may want to take your own food as there aren't too many options there. Pack a picnic and enjoy the sunshine!
,,For all who love orchids and flowers.,5.0,,"Very beautiful garden. Fantastic sorts of orchids. We did a lot of photos there, most of them use like a wallpapers."
,,Good place to visit,4.0,,"We visited Orchid gardern as part of our trip to Botanical gardern , we visitied the place early in the morning hence we thought we could get the bst out of the place.
The Orchid gardern charges $5 as entry fee and in the 3rd Saturdays they provide free guided tour, be early to book them, so can learn more about the orchids.
The whole gardern is full of orchids at the end of the tour you will start appreciating that some of the flowers we manage to see in the road side are infact orchids.
I had visited this place last week as part of our company visit so planned to take my family around this week, was a great place to visit. Green, clean and worth the time and money spent.
There are quite a few photo graphic spots which can be captured and Mostly will end up in face book pages.
Children will love this place as there is lots of flowers around , but beware not to let them pluck them as there is a fine if flowers are plucked and cameras are kept in lots of places which are out of view.
one thing which needs commendation is the time , effort the people have taken to form this kind of a gardern , singapore is a place where space is a very big constraint , still the work is simply superb. surely worth a visit when you visit to singapore .
The only draw back I feel is that if by chance you feel thirsty and you have forgotten your water then you need to go till the enterence to get water, so beware keep your stock of water ready before entering."
,,Orchid Land,4.0,,"I just loved all the colors of orchids there, and the way they have maintained the garden. It was a nice time, I wish I could have picked few of my choice."
,,Good visit,5.0,,"Floers, flowers, and more flowers, obiously all orchid, 1hour to take the tour, and are all clean and espectacular views. A extraordianry viarety of orchhid"
,,Beautiful open space,5.0,,In such a crowded island this is a restful and tranquil place to relax.Periodic concerts are presented.
,,Absolutely Breathtaking.,5.0,,Singapore National Orchid Garden is a paradise in its own bright. Lots of beautiful orchids and an amazing landscape makes this site a good escape from the hustle and bustle of city living. Do visit and take in some of its magnificent scenic views. Definitely recommend it for people for wanting to spend some peace and quiet in a 'heaven-like' environment.
,,Amazing.,5.0,,If you like Orchids: a must see. Worth the small charge of $5SGD An astonishing variety. Some of the hybrid Dendrobiums looked almost artificial.
,,natural heaven !,5.0,,"we found many amazing things from this garden those we never saw before, we stayed at a hotel nearby just 10mins for walking, many people came inside to see. the most amazing things that we saw the fishes and fed them, also all of place inside here with pretty decoration, definitely recommend and must-see place 4 any one"
,,"Worth a visit, good for a break away from the madness",3.0,,"We did this as part of one of the city tours that also went to the Merlion and probably wouldn't have visited otherwise but it was a good way to see some more of Singapore as we were out of the main city.
Saying that however, if you enjoy gardens and landscaping etc, then this is worth a visit. The range of flowers is huge and the gardens acleverly designed, they even have cooler greenhouse displays which can provide a welcome break from the Singapore heat!
If we had had more time (we were limited to an hour by the tour bus) then I think we would have got more from this trip and I'm sure that they have some good facilities. We probably wouldn't visit again on a short trip to Singapore now that we've been but would recommend a visit if you're looking for a change of pace."
,,Botanic Gardens nature trip,5.0,,"Considering that this place is very near to my relatives, it was a like an oasis because the city is just located near the location and there are no trace of abuse and pollution! the swan lake is very entertaining because the big koi fishes are looking at you and waiting for food! a very nice place to jog also!"
,,World's largest orchid display,5.0,,"Well worth a visit. Gorgeous display, lovely grounds. We took a city bus to get there. It was easy to find"
,,Spectacular collection of orchid varieties,5.0,,"If you like gardens and flowers this is a must place to visit.

,,"Wow, if you you into gardens",5.0,,"The most spectacular Orchids I have every seen, plus thousands of tropical plants. An enjoyable day out, while in Singapore."
,,Orchids galore,5.0,,The best flower show I have ever seen. The displays are fantastic with orchids that I never even knew existed.

If you're an orchid lover, then I guess this will thrill you to pieces if not... then I guess it's just a bit ho-hum. The flowers are pretty, but once you've seen the first 458, they just seem a bit samey. I wouldn't go completely out of your way for this, but if you combine it with a lazy afternoon in the Botanic Gardens, then it's hardly breaking the bank to see some pretty flowers (or 48237927)."

The garden is large, and contains a number of pavillions for rare orchids, colder weather orchids, s special garden with orchids named after VIPs. There are orchids everywhere, and I think that the collection is one of the largest in the world.

There is a $S5 fee to enter the Orchid Garden; the Botanical Garden is free.The orchids are so vibrant, full of color and well maintained. Even a novice photographer can get great photos.

We especially love the orchids inside the Mist House and VIP Orchids and we had a refreshing break inside the Cool House. The trees provided ample shade and so we didn't really mind the hot and humid weather in Singapore even it was at high noon (1:30-4pm) when we were at the Botanic Gardens.

One slight inconvenience that we experienced is that it was a bit difficult to get a taxi out of the Botanic Gardens. First we waited at the exit gate nearest to the Ginger Garden but there were no taxis there. We decided to walk back to the main gate located at Tanglin road. Again, there were no taxis there after waiting for 10 minutes. We walked further to the main road and that's where we finally able to get a taxi.

,,Lovely Oasis!,5.0,,"Located within the beautiful grounds of the Botanic Gardens, the Orchid Garden is a nice place to take the time to see. Gorgeous orchids everywhere and at only $5 SGD to get in, well worth it....Very hot and humid in there but there is a nice cool house to get some reprieve! Keep an eye out for some little squirrel or lizard friends around the gardens!!"
,,Awesome,5.0,,Well worth a visit - gardeners especially this is a gem.
,,Fabulous Orchids,5.0,,The whole Botanic Gardens were beautiful but the Orchid Garden was particularly beautiful. I grow orchids at home in a minor way and was particularly keen to visit this garden and was not disappointed. Orchids of all types and colours are here and for anyone who loves flowers it is unmissable. Very hot and humid though.
,,Orchid Heaven,5.0,,"If you like orchids & would like some pretty pics, it's an awesome place to go. Warning though for sensitive cameras, it is humid!"
,,Amazing displays of picture perfect orchids,5.0,,"Although the Botanic Gardens were not high on my must do list while in Singapore I am so glad that I took the opportunity to go there. The orchids defy description! The gardens are superb and an absolute visual delight! The humidity is also incredibly high and the cool room was a close second to the best part of my visit there. I am a keen gardener, but even nongardeners will be dazzled by the beauty of this garden. I spent two hours there and felt it could easily have been a half day or more at a more casual pace. If you are using public transport try catching one of the buses that go up Orchard Road (there are quite a few, so check first) as it is only a short trip. Do not take the MRT as it isba very long and circuitous route to get there!"
,,Magic,5.0,,Amazing display of variety with wonderfull shapes and collurs
,,OUTSTANDING!!,5.0,,"It was amazing! It is as simple as that! You must go. I am not a flower person, but I still loved it!!
There are only two bad things. 1) it cost $5 to get in, but I justified it by thinking of all the workers that were around (I saw probably 20 people in just one area of the park to pick up leaves and other things).
2) the gift shop was extremely over priced.

The flowers were amazing!!"
,,Lovely nature break,4.0,,"It was a steamy 35 degrees when I went in and it's a good walk from the entrance of the Botanical Gardens, but it was well worth it for the variety of flowers on offer.

They've really thought about placement and colour combinations. I guarantee you'll fill your camera's memory card with too many pictures of beautiful and sometimes strange orchids."
,,This is simply devine. Take your time.,5.0,,"If you are like me, and simply love gardens and flowers, this is the place to visit. It is so serene
and even my husband who claims he is alergic to gardening love the place. My husband is the type of person who likes to be entertained but spent more than an hour and a half in the National Orchid Garden alone. The displays are outstanding. It really is a photographers delight.
We visited the gardens on a Saturday and on our way found out a very big cruise ship was in town and everyone was out there. At first we thought about just turning around but had a morning to kill so continued on. The Botanical Gardens and the National Orchid Garden are so large that you can find your own space to enjoy the beauty. Also the tours tend to wizz through. Yes they get some explanation but from what I saw they don't get the time to take it all in and enjoy the beauty of the place.
It really is not to be missed."
,,Beautiful garden,4.0,,"Amazing range of orchids in a beautiful setting. The day was extremely hot and humid, so I would not pick the middle of the day to visit"
,,The cool house was the hot spot!,5.0,,"If you love flowers then this is the place for you - every colour shape and form. The paths meander around a hill with plenty of opportunities to explore - I loved the giraffes and the stone blocks covered in moss!

I, like many other visitors, especially enjoyed the cool house - a welcome respite from the topical heat.

The shop has some amazing souvenirs, and like everywhere else in Singapore, the service is exceptional.

Don't forget to visit the rest of the botanic gardens. For a busy bustling city like Singapore, the place is a true oasis."
,,Where Nature and Urban Architecture meets and work stunningly well,4.0,,"I arrived quite early than the check in time and had two hours to kill before a room could be allocated. I chose venturing out over sitting in café , consulted my friend “Tripadvisor” and National Orchid Garden came as the most popular attraction in Singapore. With 15 mins of bus ride, I reached Singapore Botanic Garden. The gate is really beautiful and you will see tourists spending much time at this spot clicking snaps , oblivious of the fact that the garden inside is much more beautiful and worth spending much more time .
You enter in the Botanic Garden and then walk towards the National Orchid Garden . They have done beautiful job in guiding the first timers like me with maps and signage at every junction and corner. There is a lake where you can spot fish, ducks, tortoise and people feeding them . Its really funny to see the tortoise not able to bite the food and big fishes pushing them down in competition.
It takes 10 mins to reach Orchid Garden . You pay SGD 5 per person and you are in. The Garden has many and different variety of Orchids I never had imagined would exist in this world. Its quite incredible to know how garden has provided the natural climate for the orchids which are from different parts of the world.
It’s a sensual treat and heaven for people mad with Photography . It’s a perfect place for a morning jog and can be an instant gratification for the urban people who want to have a quick introduction with nature and its colors .
This is the place where Nature and Urban Architecture meets and works stunningly well !!!
I just loved it."
,,Orchids Galore,5.0,,"Part of the Singappore Botanical Gardens, this is a must visit. Go see for yourself>"
,,"If you like gardens, you really must visit this",4.0,,I loved the well cared for gardens and the brilliant display of orchids in flower. The garden is very well planned with something in flower everywhere you turn. Delightful spots to rest and regain your cool and plenty of photo opportunities.
,,Worth a visit for the 'cool house',4.0,,"We visited this last month during a 3 night stay in Singapore. Entry to The National Orchid Garden costs 5 Singapore dollars each. When we visited the Orchid Garden was quiet and it was nice to wander around and look at the beautiful flowers. We especially enjoyed the cool house, not for the flowers but for the cool temperature! Worth a visit if you are at The Botanic Gardens."
,,Beautiful Peaceful Garden,4.0,,"We visited end of May and most of the blooms are wilting, it was not the peak of orchid blooming season. But the garden is very clean, and layout of different varieties were good. Nice photo shoot opportunities with beautiful blooms"
,,Wonderful escape in the middle of the city,5.0,,Beautiful place to stroll and relax for an hour or two. The orchids are stunningly beautiful and it is quite. One does not feel like being in the middle of a large city.
,,Lovely!,5.0,,"Well worth the visit, go very early in the morning or early evening to avoid the heat."
,,Fantastic variety of Orchids,5.0,,"There is nothing like this orchid garden anywhere we have ever been. Yes, garden is large so bring your water or beverage of choice. We will go back to Singapore"
,,Nothing apart from flowers to see,3.0,,"There is nothing much in this place to see and do apart from flowers. being from India, we were not at all impressed by the flower varieties seen here. It is can be a total 'AVOID' for Indian tourists"
,,Lovely Flowers that Even Non-Gardeners Can Enjoy,4.0,,"I make no secret of the fact that I am not a green thumb. Normally I love flowers best when presented with some chocolates and champagne, however even I enjoyed wandering around the National Orchid Garden for an hour or so. That said, on my next trip to Singapore I probably won't bother visiting again as I personally enjoyed other attractions more.

The entry fee is $5.00 Singaporean which is reasonable given the amount of work which obviously goes into the gardens. There is a cool house which Mr PugHugger enjoyed as it was cooler than the rest of the gardens. There are also a number of gazebos, photo locations and of course hundreds of orchids.

Downfalls for us were large tour groups of people yelling at one another with children running wild - but I guess that is a risk you take anywhere, although I was particularly unimpressed with the said children throwing merchandise around in the store.

There is a gift store which has somewhat inflated prices but some nice things - we probably would have picked something up apart from it was flu to bursting of the tour group and their out of control children! We visited on a Friday in the Singaporean school holidays. There was free entry for students that day so for a quieter experience maybe try to avoid school holidays!

I would recommend that people arrive at the bus stops, not the MRT, it was a very long walk from the MRT and we personally did not really enjoy the rest of the gardens for the simple fact we are not green thumbs. If you want a quick visit to the gardens come here, have a quick look in the immediate vicinity and then head off again. Recommend if you have more than a few days in Singapore and some free time, otherwise you can miss this if gardens are not your thing."
,,paradise,5.0,,so much to see and enjoy the garden. would like to see a proper restaurant for hungry walkers like us next time we visit please
,,Worth the sweat...,5.0,,Flower lovers and photographers alike will hardly complain about the sweat running down their back as they wander through the magnificent orchid gardens. The $SIN 5 entrance fee is definitely worth it. A further 10 minute walk along a sealed road and through the botanical gardens site and you'll find a decent meal and refreshing drink. Just get someone to point you in the direction of the taxi rank and tourist information area...
,,"Orchids, orchids everywhere!",5.0,,"If you love Orchids, you must visit the National Orchid Garden; if you love flowers, you must visit the National Orchid Garden; if you love colours, you must visit the National Orchid Garden; if you love strange shapes, you must visit the National Orchid Garden; If you love... You get the point.

The National Orchid Garden not only houses an extensive collection of Orchids, it is also a center that cultivates Orchid hybrids. China offers Pandas and Indonesia, Komodo Dragons to other nations as part of their diplomacy efforts; Singapore, on the other hand, cultivates Orchid hybrids and names them after visiting dignitaries. There is a section within the Garden where visitors can see the various hybrids named after visiting dignitaries.

Set aside at least 3 hours to enjoy the Garden."
,,Absolutely Worth A Visit,5.0,,"If you're headed to the Singapore Botanical Gardens, do pay the small entrance fee to check out the Orchid Garden. The landscaping is magnificent and the orchids are such a treat especially for folks from the American southwest.

Do it early in the morning and you may miss tour groups and rowdy tourist families!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Absolutely stunning gardens - just don't go there on a hot day, as it's sweltering and you'll feel like you need to rush through it to get back to some air conditioning. Well worth spending some hours here. For the best value, purchase a Singapore Pass from Hippo / Duck Tours, which gives you inclusive access to the Garden with your Duck-Boat Tour & Flyer (big wheel) ride."
,,flower heaven,5.0,,A dazzling display of Orchids in the most attractive surroundings.Worth the effort
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"If you like flowers, you'll love this. It's fairly cheap to enter and if you are already planning a visit to the Botanic Gardens, you might as well go in. There are so many varieties of orchid here, and they are so beautiful and usual."
,,Overwhelming amount of Orchids,4.0,,I never knew that so many species of Orchids existed. The grounds are meticulous.
,,orchid heaven,5.0,,stunning landscaping with waterfalls and fountains as a backdrop to the stunning collection of orchids
,,Lovely,4.0,,You can find the orchid garden in the Botanical Garden and a visit to both makes a very pleasant way to spend a few hours.Nicely laid out.
,,Magnificent!,5.0,,Great variety and so well-laid out.Huge variety of plants and ginger gardens are aplus.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Avely way to spend an hour. The cool house part way round gave a fantastiv break from the Singapore heat, but the orchids are definitly the stars."
,,Nice,4.0,,"A nice botanical escape in Singapore where you see only streets, big buildings and people obsessed with shopping :)"
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,Igvyou like plants this is a lovely way to spend a few hours. The orchids are stunning.
,,EARLY MORNING OPEN IN SUMMERS,4.0,,"Not an expert on plants and flowers, still loved the variety ,the color,the arrangements of orchids . Timing should be changed ,opening at early hours of the morning will make it a heaven for visitors"
,,Singapore botanical garden,5.0,,.Entrance is 1 SGD for senior to enter the orchid garden and it's beautiful.It's a collection of thousands of orchids.Nice to walk around the botanical garden.
,,Better than many orchid gardens,4.0,,"In South East Asia there are numerous orchid gardens. This being Singapore it is more organised and displays are ""better"" than many other places"
,,"""January, 2010""",3.0,,"It was sometime in January, 2010 when I joined the tour group and one of the places of interests we visited is the famous Nat'l Orchid Garden..It is quite big and didn't have much time to look around. Nonetheless, I bought some pendants and souvenir items with orchid inside."
,,Orchid Orgasm,5.0,,"Even though it was raining when we arrived this was a photographer and plant lover's dream come true. From the landscape to the cool house, fabulous plants and colors around every corner. For only $5 SD this is a high value and historical place for all who want something fun to do in Singapore. Take bus 77 from Orchard Road."
,,Heavenly experience,4.0,,The garden is a must visit in Singapore. One can explore the rich variety of flora and fauna here. Please check out the air-conditioned glass house where one can experience the feel of a tropical forest. It would easily take half a day to explore the Garden..
,,Pleasantly suprised,5.0,,Although I love flowers and gardens I have to say I have never been a fan of orchids. however when I arrived at the Orchid Garden I discovered a new love for this flower. I can not describe just how beautiful and well kept these gardens are. I would definitely recommend a visit next time you are in singapore!
,,Feast for the eyes,5.0,,The array of orchids was mindblowing. The Cool House provided a much appreciated respite from the heat outside. Remember upon entry to go to the left and you will have fewer hills to climb.
,,Orchid wonderland,5.0,,Beautiful displays of orchids. Senior discounts. It is always warm and sticky in Singapore.
,,absolutely worth going,5.0,,most beautiful orchids in the best setting possible.
,,Orchids of every color! Beautiful!,5.0,,We spent several hours here taking pictures of more orchids than I have ever seen. The gardens are well manicured. I blew up several of the pictures to decorate my walls. Very serene place!
,,Nice place to visit later in the day or early morning,4.0,,Nice to visit as part of visit to the Botanical gardens.
,,"Excellent value, with plenty of variety",5.0,,"Good variety of flowers, although direction signs could be clearer."
,,Absolutely pristine Gardens with a Massive array of Orchids,5.0,,"Love the education centers, the food center was better before they modernized it . There are lots of walks and places to relax and its now joined up with the new MRT (train) Circle line, It is HOT HOT HOT though go early in the Morning or late in the afternoon"
,,Make sure you visit this,5.0,,"This is an oasis within the perfect oasis of the Botanical Gardens. The orchids are gorgeous, the cold room and its cool mists a reprieve from the heat, and you can walk up to Birkhill house on the hill. Don't miss this experience"
,,An attraction not to be missed attraction,5.0,,If you love plants the Singapore Botanic Garden is not to be missed. Within the garden is the most extensive collection of orchids that you are likely to encounter anywhere in the world. Housed in the National Orchid Garden are the most beautiful orchids of multiple varieties. Your camera will get a good workout. Thoroughly recommend it.
,,Unique experience,5.0,,It would be a pity to miss it. The National Orchid Garden is a unique experience. I doubt that there is another such collection of orchids in one place on this planet. It simply beautiful. Highly recommended.
,,Good- if you are into Orchids,4.0,,"Okay, I was impressed with this garden, but after about 20 minutes I got really bored. I'm a guy and I can only get so excited over flowers. My one recommendation is to visit the ""cool room"". I liked that the most. It is climate controlled and you'll get out of the heat and humidity for 5 minutes. I still give this a 4 out of 5 stars, but like I said, 20 minutes and I was planning the quickest route to the exit."
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,"You may think this is an oversold tourist attraction, but it would be a shame to miss it. It's a fantastic walk (albeit a rather hot one) which you can have at your own pace. Don't miss the 'VIP orchids' created to celebrate important visitors, or the 'cool house' with carnivorous plants."
,,"If you are into Gardening and Flowers, just do it. If you are not, just do it.",5.0,,"This is by far the world's best orchid gardens and is so spectacular, I couldn't imagine how good it could be. Most orchid gardens takes 10 minutes, but here, even a casual walk would take 60 minutes. Amazing in its breath and depth."
,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,All of the flowers were just gorgeous and it made for such a wonderful Sunday afternoon outing.
,,Natural Beauty,5.0,,"I think I reviewed this under Botanical Gardens, but this is a separate part of the gardens and very appropriate for Singapore, orchids were beautiful, the varities amazing. The paths were slightly sloped but I do feel it could be a problem for anyone with difficulity walking."
,,A breath of fresh air in a very moder city,3.0,,"Very realxing, clean and well maintained. bike rentals would be great if they have one."
,,Wow,4.0,,So many different varieties of orchids we never imagined.This is a nice place to visit.
,,Just incredible!,5.0,,"We think this is a top1 in Singapur. We really weren't expecting to see so many types of orchids and a so well care garden. Explanations and a great ornamentation in all the garden. The place is really full of details with even photo spots indicated. Really one of our most memorables experiences in the city. Is really amazing to find places like this, with so much nature in the heart of a city. We loved it!"
,,STUNNING!,5.0,,if you love flowers this place is perfect. I took so many photos my camera went flat and I still didn't have a photo of all of them. Worth the small entrance fee you have to pay
,,Beautiful display,5.0,,Fabulous orchids in georgeous gardens. The cool house is a welcome relief from the heat but the orchids are beautifully displayed & looked after
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"The fantastic orchid display is not to be missed, particularly the Singapore orchids"
,,Excellent day but be prepared for the heat!!,5.0,,"Visited Sentosa Island, really worthwhile and also did the ""Hop-on Hop-off"" bus. Only had 3 days but they were very full on."
,,What a well managed garden!,4.0,,"Beautiful n impressive orchid collections in this well managed, huge garden. Really enjoyed my first visit. Thumbs up!"
,,Best outdoor display of tropical orchids in the world,5.0,,"I am prompted to write this review after reading ileaf's review of a couple of days ago who wrote ""Nothing much . . . just flowers, lots of orchid"". 'ileaf' is obviously not a gardener or an orchid lover! The Singapore National Orchid Garden is probably the best outdoor display of tropical orchids in the world. In 2010/11, I traveled to 15 countries in the tropics to photograph orchids for a book. and nowhere did I see an outdoor orchid garden more impressive than the Singapore National Orchid Garden. There are some nice orchid gardens in Costa Rica, but they are only a fraction the size of Singapore's orchid garden, and their entrance fees are much higher than the SGD5.00 that Singapore charges (SGD1.00 for over-60s). The garden is well maintained and there are always hundreds of orchids in flower. No visit to the SIngapore Botanic Gardens would be complete without including the National Orchid Garden. It is definitely NOT the same as the rest of the botanic gardens as 'ileaf' claims. I guess ileaf's review would be a bit like me going to the Tokyo Motor Show and reviewing it as ""Nothing much, just lots of cars""."
,,A small 'garden' of Orchids,2.0,,"Maybe I just do not know how to appreciate orchids, but I do not understand the attraction of this. The word ""Garden"" is deceptive - it is actually a small place. But I guess if you like orchids, then this is worth checking out cos of its vast varities."
,,The peaceful side of Singapore,5.0,,"Best to go early to avoid the heat. Such a peaceful place to visit in hustle of Singapore. A surprise around every corner, orchids galore from all differing climates, a photographers delight . Worth the small entrance fee (5sing dollars) to meander among the orchids. Cool house is great to cool you down and present orchids from cooler climes"
,,Well..,3.0,,"Nothing much, and pretty similar compared to Botanic Gardens, just flowers, lots of orchid"
,,breathtaking,5.0,,an amazing array of orchids in beautiful natural seeings. A joy for flower photographers. over 60's get in for 1SD (50p) what value!!!
,,Plenty of Colorful Orchids,5.0,,"Its worth to pay the entrance fee if you love these tropical flowers-a sizeable garden within the Singapore Botanic Garden.

There are even ""picture spots"" just for those perfect cheesy shots. You'll get to see so many kinds of orchids in many different shapes, sizes and colours."
,,A must see,5.0,,If you do not come from a tropical climate this is a must see. The flowers are spectacular.
,,A great garden away from the rush,5.0,,The garden set in the Botanical Gardens with extra admission charge is a gem. Its well laid out to surprise as you walk around the paths. The displays are some of the beat we have seen. The gardens are easily visited in a one hour visit. hard to believe this delight is hidden amongst the bustle of Singapore.
,,don't let the entrance fee turn you off,5.0,,"May is probably not the best month for orchids to bloom but i still enjoyed the walk through this enchanted forest of orchids. i particularly enjoyed the coolhouse with the mini waterfall. never seen orchids in this setting before. of course, its also a welcome escape from the heat for abit.. ;)"
,,Get lost in the world of orchids,5.0,,A fantastic collection of orchids. A must visit for orchid lovers. A camera is a must have or you might have to make another trip there.
,,Lovely gardens,4.0,,The botanic gardens are huge and worth a visit. The Orchid garden is inside the gardens and there is a $5 charge. There is lots of colour around.

,,Beautiful orchids,4.0,,"If you like flowers (specifically orchids), this is a must see. Quite a large garden, plan on about 1-2 hours to explore. Very warm and humid."
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,Take your camera....so many varieties of orchids in stunning setting.
,,Feast for the eyes (and camera),5.0,,Bring your best camera and extra memory to the Orchid garden as you will find yourself wanting to photograph everything here. The blooms are exquisite and abundant and the atmosphere is generally tranquil. One of the most lovely places anywhere in the world.
,,Good Attraction,5.0,,"Lovely gardens worth a visit.very relaxing, worth taking the rainforst path"
,,Stunning!,5.0,,The best display of Orchids I have ever seen. Well worth the walk.
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"I am not a flower person, its a girly thing as far as i'm concerned, but i could not believe some of the flowers on display here, they will take your breath away and well worth £2-50 entrance fee."
,,Not the season for us to see orchid blooming,3.0,,"Well maintained. Varieties of flowers. There is a shopping center if u are interested in buying plants. Also have a hibiscus garden, hibiscus being their national flower. You better visit this garden either early morning or evening to avoid scorching sun in may"
,,Good place to vistit,5.0,,Really nice place to visit! Just paid 5 SGD to get in! I like this place!
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,Worth a visit (if you like Orchids!) only S$5 to get in! We had lunch at a cafe there and the burger was huge!
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Beautiful place to visit, worth a trip if your in the area! well kept oasis in the city."
,,Beautifull,4.0,,Really nice place for visiting and learning different kinds of orchids. It cost only 5 $SGD.

,,Peaceful and Gorgeous!,5.0,,"Take a bottle of wine, a crusty french baguette and some lovely cheese and park yourself in one of the shelter pavilions. Such a lovely way to spend an afternoon in Singapore!"
,,must see in Singapore,5.0,,The orchid garden is the most beautiful corner of the national botanic garden. Many of the orchid varieties displayed were bred in Singapore. The flower display is visually stunning and not to be missed.
,,"Very beautiful Orchids, well worth seeing",5.0,,"Guaranteed -you will definitely enjoy the beautiful Orchids, the numerous colors, and many different varities along with the setting of the gardens. It is well worth the long walk through the Botanic Gardens to see these National Orchids of Singapore."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Worth the trip look for the black orchid, its easily mised."
,,Go there. Just do it.,5.0,,"A bonus for nature lovers, and a calming balm for everyone else -- that's how I would describe the Botanic Garden and the Orchid Garden within it. Amaxing greenery and several photo-opp spots aside, it is the overall experience of being so close to nature and its wonders that made me like this place so much. The Botanic Garden has no entry fee, and that for the Orchid Garden is minimal."
,,UNREAL!!!,5.0,,dont even think about not going here!! one of the most beautiful places on earth
,,The best part of the Singapore Botanic Gardens,5.0,,"If you visit the Singapore Botanic Gardens, you need to make the National Orchid Garden one of your stops. If you can only see one part of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, make it the National Orchid Garden.

Why?

Because the National Orchid Garden is the largest display of tropical orchids in the world. There are orchids of all colors, shapes and sizes from all over the world on display here. You do not have to be a flower lover (or orchid lover) to be wowed by this garden.

Have plenty of memory on your camera card, you will be taking a lot of pics (I took over 200)."
,,Well worth the trip,5.0,,"The hotel arranged this visit for us as a private tour, it was really relaxing and worth taking a look around."

,,Delightful,5.0,,"This is a MUST for everyone visiting Singapore! Colourful and tastefully arranged orchid plants, overflowing with flooms of every hue and colour. Delightful is the term I'd use."
,,Very nicely maintained,5.0,,The orchid garden is beautiful with many nice photo ops. Good value.
,,Great if you like Orchids,4.0,,"A great bonus within the Boatnnical gradens that we chanced upon. Realised though once inside that orchids aren't really my fave plant as a species. Still, all things flora are amazing and it was nice to wander round as a family"
,,Botanic Garden,5.0,,It was too hot at midday to walk with kids. Original and wonderful garden
,,Beautiful Place,5.0,,"Well worth the walk up to these gardens thru the botanic garden. worth the money to get in. Gift shop is worth missing. plenty of sales people in there trying to sell you stuff you dont need.

remember which way you came to work out which way to catch your return trip."
,,lots and lots of flowers!!!,4.0,,"went here a few days back, the place is awesome, really maintained and clean. the staff were courteous and helpful. plus its really cheap. its basically a place for photogs since there are lots and lots of stuff to picture :P really enjoyed the place"
,,A real beauty spot - well worth an hour,5.0,,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens are world class but the Orchid Garden is is a class by itself: truly beautiful. The displays are well signed and just beg to be photographed - it is easily accessible by MTR or taxi and it is a ""must see"" in Singapore. While there be sure to see the Ginger Garden, too."
,,Orchid and orchids!,4.0,,Beautiful orchid's garden. Colorful and a lot of orchid's species. Not a big fan of orchids but it's a well-organized garden and enjoyed the walk there. Located inside of Botanic Garden.

,,I love Orchids!!!!!!,5.0,,"Wow...a very well-organized orchid garden..It has a lot of species of orchids, If i'm not mistaken, more than 3000 kinds...
All the orchids looked so beautiful...so colourful..
Some of the orchids named with Then VIP' names, like; Princess Diana, Andrea Bocelli,etc....
These special orchids awarded the names of the vip, as been chosen by the vip themselves...when they came to Singapore...
Defenitely a Must See attraction...
In the mid of the hustle bustle...this garden is like a water source in the mid of desert...
See you again;)
."
,,Sights to see,3.0,,"We visited the Botanical Garden and Orchid Garden in April and it was really hot. You have to walk a bit in the garden to see it and you end up sweating.
I was disappointed with the Orchid Garden on one respect. There was too much greenery (other plants) in the orchid garden and only a smattering few clumps of orchids. I would have expected with all the hype that it would be filled with orchids. A few photo spots are created with concentration of orchids, but otherwise the walk in the sun was really too tiring and you feel cheated.
If the whole area was covered with orchids, it would have been nice."
,,Lovely gardens,4.0,,"So peaceful, away from the hustle and bustle! Beautiful flowers and plants."
,,Excellent place and a must visit.,5.0,,"Its a beautiful place. Many people get tired due the humid climate and skip seeing the entire place. DO not miss the cool/mist house. Its a recreation of the amazon forest made by them and is seemingly very cool! Another not to miss is the orchid shop by the exit. Its for real and the jewelry that you get there is not available anywhere else in singapore, not even on the airport. Check out the bangle collection. Its also the best. They are all real orchid flowers dipped in 24k gold. Go for it Ladies !"
,,Orchid lovers delight,4.0,,The array of orchids named after famous people is very interesting.
,,Go!,5.0,,You will love it! This has developed more at every visit. It is one of our 'regulars'.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,Me and a few friends spent an afternoon strolling through the gardens. If you have the time and love nature this is a stop that you dont want to miss. It is easy to book a city tour that includes the National Orchid Gardens.
,,Orchid Garden,5.0,,What a place. I did not realise that there were so many varieties. I was overwhelmed. But really enjoyed this beautifully maintained garden.
,,"Wonderful, relaxing space with some very interesting flora",5.0,,"It is worth the $5 dollar admission charge as you get a dazzling array of breathtaking orchid beauty...the gardens are wonderfully landscaped and if you get too hot, you can always go cool off in the cool house, where they house some hardier types of orchids...go on and give the orchids a smell...some of them are surprisingly fragrant!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Just go there the beauty of flowers will blow your mind!
,,Orchids,5.0,,"Great set out, easy to get round. From an orchid growers perspective one of the best orchid gardens I have been in."
,,For Plant Lovers,4.0,,"If you like plants/flowers you will love it, don't visit just because its recommended. There were large crowds there, and many looked bored!"
,,A superb garden,4.0,,"The garden is very nice, brilliantly colourful and orchid-lover paradise. But it is also a long walk from the MRT entrance as it is located at the other end of the botanical gardens. Phewws..."
,,A truly relaxing sight...,5.0,,We visited the National Orchid Garden last September 2011 as part of our tour and I'm glad that the travel agency included it on the tour. The sight and different kinds of Orchids are just really amazing and soothing to the eyes. Glad to see a sight like this one in a major industrialized country liked Singapore. There are also several photo stations that makes the sight worth visiting.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We actually went twice during our four day stay as it was a great walk.
First time was on a Sunday, the gardens were very busy with families having picnics etc. This made it a little difficult to actually see everything.
The second was on a Tuesday and what a relaxing place, there were plenty of fitness groups etc all enjoying the outdoor sessions. This time we spent about 4 hours going around all the various sections and being able to appreciate the sanctuary.
The fauna is amazing, we have a great variety in Australia, but this was breathtaking. The information plaques were very much appreciated, letting you know what you were looking at and also how old some of these trees were.
My favourite flowers are Orchids - but boy I did not know just how many varietys and colours you could get.
I could visit these gardens everyday should I live in Singapore."
,,Great Time at National Orchid Garden,5.0,,"The national orchid garden was too good. Being senior sitizen paid only 1 Dollar entrance ticket. lush green with beautiful flowers, well maintained neat and clean. Seen good variety of orchids including in the cool home. Very tyring to walk thru it was that big. Took about three hrs. On return garden cab dropped us to taxi stand at botanical garden."
,,Well Worth It - A Must See,5.0,,"The Orchid gardens really are stunning and certainly well worth a visit even if you aren't into flowers and gardens. I found myself really enjoying this experience,despite the humidity.
A couple of tips you might find helpful: Firstly, we got a taxi to the gardens entrance, then had quite a walk in the humidity. I would ask the taxi driver to take you to the Orchid gardens entrance and if your driver isn't sure, make sure you have a map to show him/where you want to go. (Unless of course you want to walk through the gardens which are, stunning.) Secondly take a couple of bottles of water with you as you will find the humidity will make you perspire heavily. We went on an overcast afternoon after some rain and found the humidity to be very trying so it was important to rehydrate.
I thoroughly recommend the Orchid Gardens."

,,A very green and very warm place,3.0,,"For real (European) garden enthusiasts this is not a great deal at all. One mostly struggles with the moisture and the heat. The Orchid garden (against a fee) is basically just a large version of an average (European) orchid shop. There is an adjacent souvenir shop with VERY nice air-conditioning, but also quite obtrusive sales staff.
The Halia restaurant (and refreshment) has a much longed for air-conditioned space in addition to fanned outside tables, and is quite good. Good food and Singapore style (good) service."

Worth the visit if going to the gardens."
,,have a good breakfast as it's very extensive,5.0,,"the orchids are wonderful and worth the several hours we spent there and still did not see all of the orchids, not to mention the rest of the Gardens"

,,Such colour and beauty,4.0,,"The orchid garden is beautiful, the array of colours you wouldnt think possible. The range offered, from the magnificent to the minor, from large to small, is amazing. Its well worth the visit to see the orchid garden, as well as the Botanical Gardens themselves, which offer a little bit of cool on a hot Singapore day."
,,Singapore's top attraction,5.0,,"Brilliant collection, beautifully terraced along a hillside. The mist- and cool-houses are especially interesting, as is the exhibit in the former director's lodge (a great example of the Singapore's distinctive ""black-and-white"" colonial residence type). We spent about an hour in one of the shelters, caught out by a thunderstorm -- hard to imagine a nicer place to wait out the rain."
,,Truly beautiful,5.0,,"This orchid garden is located inside the botanic garden which already a pleasure to walk in. Entrance is $5 and $1 for students, children up to 12 are free. It is very well laid out with nice pavilions, cool houses and numerous great places for making photographs. If you like nature then this is a must do when coming to Singapore. I felt a bit pitied though for all these tourist that are brought here by touring card and why have just recently arrived in Singapore. The place is very warm and humid so dress lightly and use good sun protection."
,,Orchids,4.0,,Loved the various colours and descriptions of how they propogate new varieties for visiting heads of state. Thought the one for Quinton Bryce (Aust GG) was very insipite and boring.

,,beautiful orchids every where,5.0,,"it cost S$5/person to enter this garden. and from the singapore botanic garden entrance @napier road (near Gleneagles hospital) was quite far. use sport shoes or any comfortable shoes/sandals. inside the garden it has many great photo spots where we can take picture. if you want to visit this garden do it really early in the morning or evening so it is not too hot.

i use mrt (NS line/ red line) and alight at Orchard Rd mrt station then took exit B to Orchard Boulevard. after that i took the bus no 7 (but no 105 and 132 also go to napier road). 5 minutes later i alighted right in front of gleneagles hospital (ride beside the singapore botanical garden)"

,,A Garden in the Island of Gardens,4.0,,"The orchid garden was a relaxing and beautiful location. I wish i had more time, as it is a serene place to lay down and have a nap, away from the build up areas of Orchard Rd.

The only draw back was access to food and drink, as there was 1 main cafeteria which was absolutely packed full, with only one other shop i saw doing hot dogs, water and diet coke. If attending i would take water in advance. otherwise beautiful, fresh, the oxygen is heavier and very serene."
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,"I must confess that I am an orchid fanatic, but I got so many comments from so many people on the pictures that I posted on facebook from this lovely place.

It comprises a large collection of orchids of many different varieties, including some in buildings as well as outdoors. A photographer's paradise! [But you will need to have your wits about you to photograph flowers: manual focus is probably going to be more successful than auto focus or even macro focus, because camera may get confused ...].

Entry is inexpensive (especially if you are 55 or over: only $1, instead of $5!). To get to the Botanic Garden, take the new MRT CIrcle Line, which has a stop there. Many paths wind around the large garden, but maps allow you to find the orchids easily.

There are literally thousands of orchids to see in various habitats. Make sure you have plent of room on your photo card!
,,The variety of orchids is amazing...,5.0,,"As advertised: Three hectares of carefully landscaped slopes provide a setting for over 1,000 species and 2,000 hybrids, with about 600 species and hybrids on display."
,,Flowers Flowers everywhere!,5.0,,"Well the colors and varieties of just one flower orchid, will leave you enchanted! No kidding there are thousands and thousands of those and you can never have seen each one of them enough! They come in all shapes and sizes and almost all designs. Do keep a look out for the pitcher plant in the mountain orchid zone. Its really nice :)
They have actually build spots where people can take quiet lovely pictures of themselves with the surroundings, keep a look out for that.
Overall, the garden is a good design and but you might be tired of the thousands of varieties of orchids by the end, thats how the law of diminishing marginal returns works I guess!"
,,Amazing place to see rare Orchids,5.0,,Great place see a variety of rare Orchids. A very beautiful and rare collection of Orchids and plants. Also a good place to relax and take a walk.

,,Must See,5.0,,This is such a lovely place. We have been each time we have visited Singapore and it never fails to please.
,,Take your camera !,5.0,,"Beautiful exhibits, really enjoyed our stroll around."
,,"Lovely place, dont leave Singapore without visiting Orchid Gardens!",5.0,,"What a lovely place... to get there, the best way is going by Metro. there is a new station right at the entrance of Botanical Gardens. With only 15- 20 mins pleasant walk inside the beautiful and wonderful gardens, you reach the orchid garden.
There is also a nice crowded shop in the entrance selling small items as souvenirs. We skip that as we wanted to have more time for the orchids. I had my macro lenses with myself and had got very beautiful shots. But pay attention the time, as we reached there at 12 oclock and I couldn’t get nice shots on that time under heavy sun light. I think best time especially for photography would be early mornings (8-10) or late afternoons (4-6).
We also have a Hawaiian pizza in the Italian restaurant which was so delicious."
,,Little is in flower in late November,3.0,,Disappointed as so little was in flower in late November and you have to pay to get in.
,,my favourite spot in singapore,5.0,,"i wish i had had a full day to spend admiring the stunning orchids and beautiful flowers of the garden
i've been to many orchid museums over the years
mostly in asia
but this was by far the most impressive one
i'll certainly be going back some day"
,,A must,5.0,,Go early and head straight to the orchid gardens as busloads of tourists are disgorged and before you know it you will be surrounded and won't be able to get good photographs.
,,Flowers in live,5.0,,"What a pleasure to see so many varieties of orchids, far away from potted plants we see in Europe !"

,,You would need a guide,3.0,,"I don't know if there was the possibility of a guide (we did not look for one, as we had our 2 young ones with us), but it would definitely help. There are tons of orchids in this garden, but without explanations, they are just nice flowers.
Now, they were nice, though"
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,so many different shape and color of orchid. Take time and have sit enjoy orchid if you are flower lover.
,,Well worth the entrance fee,5.0,,"Although enclosed within the botanical gardens it is worth paying the modest entrance fee to have a look around the Orchid garden, which are perhaps even more beautiful and with many award winning and rare orchids (as you may expect). there are also several beautiful photo spots to take advantage of."
,,A place of true beauty,5.0,,I simply lack words to express how impressed I am with this place! Absolutely MUST SEE if you`re in Singapore.

,,Beautiful and peaceful,5.0,,"Just a great stop. Be prepared for the humidity, but take water and take your time to enjoy the beauty."
,,Beautiful gardens,4.0,,"Even for non-orchid fans this is a lovely place to visit - fantastic colours in lovely settings. In fact the whole botanic park is beautiful (& you only pay for the orchid garden). Interesting exhibits about the history of orchid cultivation. Only complaint - the ""photo opportunity"" signs are a bit trite! And do try the ginger beer from the stall outside the garden - yummy"
,,peaceful and relax,5.0,,beautiful clean garden with orchids all around. a place to visit
,,Worth a Visit,4.0,,A must for the Orchid Lover! Even if your not a huge lover its worth a visit!
,,Greenery amidst concrete,5.0,,"This is one of the most relaxing places to be in. Beautifully topiaried shrubs, a multitude of Orchids and overall serenity of this place is overwhelming. Most tourist buses stop here only for 1 hours that that is not sufficient for explore this place."
,,Highlight of the gardens,5.0,,"Amazing to see the plants in their best conditions, well designed, good value, well maintained."
,,The Reason to Visit Singapore,5.0,,Exotic tropical Singapore gardens. Worth the trip on its own

,,Amazing well worth a visit,5.0,,This is a place which is great to visit. Well worth a trip and different amazing species to see. Was not at all crowded and was great and easy to navigate.
,,No place like it in the world,5.0,,My idea of heaven is the National Orchid Garden. They keep the gardens so clean and in tip top shape. You'll see orchids you will never see anywhere else.
,,So beautiful!,5.0,,It's vibrant with colour and is a wonderful place to relax and enjoy.
,,always amazing,5.0,,it´s worth to go. Also for photographer a wonderful place for amazing photos. Go there... a must do
,,Great place to see,4.0,,"Beautiful gardens to walk around, nice gift shop and coffee shop"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Worth the effort to trek out here to see the amazing collection of orchids.
,,"If you love gardening, and ORCHIDS, this is a MUST see",5.0,,"As I had only a few short days in Singapore, I relied on ""four hour tours"" to get me to see as much as possible. This was a mistake, as the gardens needed far more time than the hour allotted there, as part of a ""Sights of Singapore"" tour
The presentation of the various orchids and associated plants was exquisite, but there was insufficient time to savour the gardens,except now that I'm home again and viewing my many photos.Wear comfortable walking shoes and take a large hat or sun umbrella and water, and take your time and sit in the many nooks and crannies provided for your viewing enjoyment.
The gardens are truly a joy and staff are busy keeping it that way"
,,Beautiful! And bring your camera!,5.0,,"I visited here for too short a time, less than an hour as part of a City Tour. But it was absolutely gorgeous! There were so many varieties of orchids, bromeliads, and other types of plants here. You must definitely bring your camera!"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,A trip to the botanic gardens would not be complete without visiting the orchid gardens. Great value for money at only $5 each adult.
,,I'm not into flowers but this place is beautiful!,5.0,,Really enjoyed this very well kept part of the Botanical Gardens. It is a beautiful walk through the various pathways of the Orchid Garden. Stroller friendly.
,,Not just for lovers of flora and fauna,4.0,,"This is an oasis in Singapore's concrete jungle. The entrance fee of SGD5.00 deters tour groups and families with children so you can truly relax and enjoy a moment of tranquility in this section of the Botanic Gardens. My favourite spot is the area displaying orchid blooms named after visiting dignitaries, Nobel laureates and famous people such as the late Princess Diana."
,,Wonderful experience ....spend all day there,5.0,,"This was a wonderful place, not expensive, but breathtaking and great photo opportunities ...not to be missed if you visit Singapore"
,,Stunning beauty in the park!,4.0,,"During some free time on a business trip to Singapore I ventured to the Orchid Garden located in the Singapore Botanical Gardens. While access to the grounds is free, there was a *minimal* charge for the Orchid Garden...WORTH THE MONEY!

Some of the areas were under 'refurbishment' so there may not have been as many orchids to view as at other times, but there were gorgeous displays of various colored orchids! I snapped so many fantastic pictures."
,,Orchids paradise,4.0,,"This is a garden oasis in the city centre. Situated in the Singapore Botanical Gardens, the National Orchid Garden attracts both orchid lovers and people just looking for a place to chill.

Orchirds holds a very special position in the nation's heart. The Vanda Miss Joquim is the national flower of Singapore. (No, the picture below is not the Vanda Miss Joquim- I just found the closest looking).

I went on a weekday afternoon, the weather was scorching hot (but you wouldn't really expect anything else in Singapore- except maybe if it's raining). But I spent an entire afternoon there, very amazed and impressed by the beauty of the orchids. Just in case you thought it was a small collection that you could just scoot through in two hours, you better think twice. For photography lovers or flower lovers, this is the place for you.

Although I didn't manage to take any pictures of it (i think it was either too dark or I was too lazy), one particular attraction that you might be interested in, within the orchid garden, is the VIP Orchid Gardens, where you could see the orchids named after famous people, such as Princess Diana, Margaret Thatcher etc.

While entrance to the Botanical Gardens is free, entry to the Orchid Gardens is $5. However, the $5 is totally worth it, when you feel the joy surrounded by the beautiful orchids! Plus if you are a student or 60 years and above, you just need to pay $1. It is free for children below 12 years!

,,so calm… so relaxing,5.0,,"Saying just beautiful will not do justice to my experience at National Orchid garden. It was amazing, simply out of this world. Lovely flowers were a feast to eyes. Omg, so calm… so relaxing. Just spend some time lying on the grass, you would feel being in paradise. A must see place for everyone. I could have missed inexpressible happiness. Do go to the garden even to experience what real happiness is. It was amazing."
,,must see,5.0,,good walks around the garden great restaurent as well and a must to visit in singapore
,,"If you're in the gardens, you cannot miss this!",5.0,,"Nestled in the botanic gardens the Orchid Garden came highly recommended, and rightly so. The $5 entry fee is well worth it. The garden is beautifully tended and contains the most incredible and stunning displays of orchids. The gardens are immaculately maintained and the whole experience was just gorgeous."
,,a Real Beauty,5.0,,instead of seeing the whole Botanic Garden I would suggest that Orchid Garden be visited while it is a real well-designed area and Orchids are totally unique.
,,Is it Heaven?,5.0,,This place is for the person who loves flowers. They charges S$ 5 as entrance fee.. but worth to pay. I guess this is the only place in Singapore I enjoyed without smokers around. Maintenance of this garden is simply spot on.
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"Beautiful part of the Botanical Gardens and well worth the SGD5 price (SGD1 for seniors!). It can be a bit crowded and hot, as many places in Singapore, but with a bottle of water and a relaxed pace you'll be fine. Look up, down and around, the flowers are breathtaking."
,,A MUST FOR A FLOWER ADDICT! ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS MORNING,5.0,,"Our family has two flower addicts who visited the national orchid garden and absolutely enjoyed their time there. It is best to do in morning and is very hot and humid so be sure to bring a bottle of water with you, although there are plenty of amenities to purchase refreshments. A good camera is a must as you will be snap happy!. It is quite a bit to walk around but worth every effort. A gorgeous leisurely morning out. There is even a quality restaurant for fine dining located inside, along with a cafe, snackbar and souvenir shop."
,,Heaven on Earth,5.0,,"This is the place to feed your soul;orchids,fountains and an atmosphere of tranquility.Go early in the day before the tourist groups arrive and take a camera."
,,Wow,5.0,,"I have visited the Botanical garden in Singapore several times, and the Orchid garden within it is truly amazing.

The Gardens are free for visitors, however for the Orchid Garden a small fee is charged. Early morning is the best time to visit as Singapore is hot and humid.

The garden never ceases to impress as they keep changing and adding things. A quiet stroll through it is best. So many Orchids and so many nooks and vistas its truly a plant lovers Utopia............."
,,Amazing..... take a good camera!,5.0,,"I had limited time in Singapore, so I wasn't able to take a whole day to visit the entire botanic garden, so I opted to view just the National Orchid Garden. I wish I would have had more time, it was incredible! I just wish I would have had a better camera with a macro lens. The VIP garden was especially interesting, with orchids named after prominent visitors. I don't think this would be very interesting for kids."
,,A must see,5.0,,"We visited in early January 2010, taking the SIA Hop On Hop Off bus to the Singapore Botanic Gardens. We had a free voucher with our stopover package, but entry otherwise would have been only 5 SGD I think. Even as a male accompanying my flower mad wife, I found the orchid gardens amazingly beautiful. Fantastic displays, variety of flowers and great photo opportunities.

Unfortunately we did not have enough time to explore the rest of the botanic gardens (which looked just beautiful), but had a great time wandering through the orchids. We ended up spending about 1 hour which was a good time to see the orchids, but could easily have stayed longer."
,,Nice Orchids.,5.0,,We visited the Botanic gardens and the Orchid garden this summer. The orchid garden is beautiful. Amazing variety of Orchids on display. Well worth a visit.
,,Fun to explore - flower lover or not!,5.0,,"Our next day was a little more relaxing. We spent the morning exploring the Botanical Gardens and the National Orchid Gardens. It was hard to believe this oasis of park and colorful flowers was still in the middle of the city. Rather than find another alternative, we caught the Singapore Airlines Hop On / Hop Off bus again. At S$12 each it was cheaper than a roundtrip cab and dropped us off right at the entrance! The Botanical Gardens are free, and the Orchid Gardens is S$5. The orchids are amazing – lots of colors and variety. Don’t miss the cool house and section of exotics (I know some orchids are more rare, but they are all exotics to me!). The ginger gardens are also worth some time. The gardens themselves are huge, so it’s a good day to wear your walking shoes! Restrooms are split between the squat and western types. They were clean and Balinese in design --- 1 of the walls was open and looked out into a little garden area."
,,Excellent stop even if you're not a flower lover.,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is in the Western section of the Botanic Gardens, requiring a small entrance fee (5 SGD at the time of this writing). It is worth the price of admission and then some.

The NOG is quite large, probably 7-8 acres, with beautiful landscaping. I believe there are over 2,000 hybrids and hundreds of species contained here. The highlight for me was the ""VIP Orchid Garden"" which contained dozens of hybrids named after visiting heads of state such as Margaret Thatcher and Benazir Bhutto. There is also a collection of Bromelaids (Asian flower.... don't worry I didn't know what they were either) that are spectacular. The landscaping and sculptures found here are a step above the Botanic Gardens in my opinion.

Highly recommended."
,,Best orchid display,5.0,,"I love Orchids and this garden was amazing. Lot and lots of Orchids. There are very beautiful displays and arrangements and its all very well maintained. The only downside was the humidity was very high, much higher than in the city."
,,"Fovourite place for ""Getting back to Nature'",5.0,,I was in Singapore April 2007. Will be visiting again for a few days end of June 2008. One place I will revisit is the National Orchid Garden! Must be one of the best collection of Orchids in the world! Worth the visit. The Cactus Garden is also worth the visit to the Botanical Gardens.
,,Great getaway in the heart of the city,5.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is within the Botanical Gardens and is definitely worth a small detour. It is well laid-out, and a quiet, pleasant and peaceful stop. Take your time since it can be steamy, especially at midday. Perfect side trip after shopping on Orchard Road since it is close by."
,,Orchids Galore!,4.0,,"The National Orchid Garden is contained within Singapore's Botanic Gardens. There is a small entrance charge to the Orchid Garden, unlike the main body of the Botanic Gardens. I have always thought it well worth it.

The Garden consists of a primary area of landscaped planting with good paths weaving through the displays. There is an information building describing Orchids and with a collection of the 'named' Orchids by the side of the building. These are hybrids that have been named for visiting VIPs.

Also in the Garden is a large collection of Bromeliads in their own separate display area, and a cool house for more temperate species and a collection of carnivorous plants.

The Orchid Garden makes an excellent sidestop when visiting the Botanic Gardens and, even from my perspective as a non-gardener, is impressive."
,,A must see for all flower lovers,5.0,,"If you have even the faintest interest for gardening, flowers, orchids - you have to go to the National Orchid Garden whilst in Singapore. I have been there on three different visits, everytime enjoying it equally much.

A magnificent selection of orchids of several hundred different species, hybrids and varieties."
,,An oasis in the city,5.0,,"This find is an amazing escape from the hustle and bustle of urban Singapore. Located just minutes from Orchard Rd, these gardens offer a relaxing (if it's possible in 90/90 weather) tour through one of the world's largest orchid collections.

I'm not a gardening buff by any means, but I thoroughly enjoyed my hour walk through the different varieties of orchids. I never knew they were so diverse. I ended up taking 50+ photos.

I took a bus from the Orchard MRT station. These gardens are within the Botanical Gardens. It was so close that I overshot my stop by a few hundred yards and had to walk back. In hindsight, I could have walked, although it would have been a long one, especially in the hot weather.

Advise to get there early when the weather is cooler. Inside, there is one ""coolroom"" where cold weather orchids are housed."
