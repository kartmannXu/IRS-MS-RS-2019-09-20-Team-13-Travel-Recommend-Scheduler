,,Fascinating,5.0,,"A large, spacious area commemorating so many deceased from WW2. If you have a relative buried there, the directories are in a cupboard at the entrance. Brings home the tragedy of WW2 in SIngapore."
,,Landmark,4.0,,"Beautifully built & well maintained. Dedicated to people who died defending Singapore during 2nd World War. It includes war graves , memorial & military graves"
,,Best taken as a guided tour,4.0,,"We visited as part of a WW2 battlefield tour by Tours with Locals tour guide and the guide was able to point out things and people of interest, ie why where there 5 graves placed close together, and the significance of the shape of the war memorial."
,,They gave their todays,5.0,,"They gave their todays for our tomorrows. Thousands of sailors, soldiers and airmen from several Commonwealth Countries came to the aid of Singapore during WW2. We must never forget their ultimate sacrifice. The memorial is on an elevation, very tranquil, very quiet and very peaceful. There are catalogues available detailing the names, rank, units they belong to, country of origin and other details to assist visitors in locating the final resting place of their loved ones. An essential destination to visit to say a great Thank You."
,,A TIMELY REMINDER,5.0,,A most interesting and powerful look into the past to realise what actually happened in those times and the total sacrifice that occurred and how the Singaporians have presented their respect of this past event.
,,Remember our Past,5.0,,"A very solemn place. So many life’s cut short from so many countries, very sad. We took the MTR to Kranji station then it’s a 15 walk. This is a must see if you are an Australian. Very well maintained."
,,Very moving place,5.0,,"Our guide gave us a great and moving talk on this memorial, i am sure my Dad [ medical orderly 13th AGH ]has mates and patients here [ all he ever after he came back to Australia said about his captors was that they were ' mongrels ' may he and his mates RIP"
,,ANZAC Day 2019,5.0,,While we didn't attend the Dawn Service here we had a mid morning walk. A very sad place but given the competition for space in Singapore it is testament to the esteem these men and women are held in that this place has been quarantined from development. Access is not easy but we parked across the road in the turf club car park. Its about a 10 min walk from there.
,,A Piece of History,5.0,,"Brought a Malaysian Friend to this place and it wowed him. Solemn, quiet, and reflective. This is the resting place of many who sacrificed their lives during WWII. Not a big place but great if you take time to just sit and reflect. Probably about an hour or two will do to appreciate the place."
,,Beautifully and respectfully maintained.,5.0,,This memorial cemetery is beautifully kept and maintained and is cared for with respect by those who work there as are all Commonwealth War Cemeteries. There is a book containing names of those buried there in the niche at the entrance in alphabetical order.
,,Worth a Visit to Reflect,5.0,,"Visited the cemetery due to relatives that served in Singapore during WW2. The cemetery is located north of the island. Can get there by the MRT from Singapore city. Use the Red Line MRT and get off at Kranji Station. The cemetery is only a 5 - 10 minute walk from train station. If you walk when you turn left out of the train station and you will walk to the first intersection, make sure you go straight across the intersection as the entrance is only about 200 metres on the left of Woodlands Drive. Certainly worth a visit. There are food stalls at Kranji station, plus you can stock up on bottled water as well. On our return we had the $2.50 Chicken Rice in the very small Food stall. recommended. Opposite are other food stalls."
,,A Sober Moment,4.0,,This impressive Memorial is just across the road from the famous Singapore Cricket Club and commemorates the victims of the dark WW2 period of occupation. Worth a moments reflection when passing.
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,"A well kept area, used today to invest army reservists (possibly others, but not sure if that). A serene space with a great deal of information. A distance from the city."
,,Our tour was informative and well run. Our host wiu lovely.,5.0,,"Unfortunately the changi museum isnt opened to the public but is scheduled for next year with everything updated and more displays. The tour covered the history of this critical time for many australians /malay/chinese and others who suffered under the japanese. Kranji cemetery is kept well in respect of those known and unknown young men and women who's lives ended so quickly. My father was 3 years in changi pow camp, returned a skeleton, managed to pick up the threads of life and never spoke about the worst and best of human nature. A part of history that should be taught in schools."
,,A well worth visit,5.0,,For anyone interested in either British Colonial history or WW2 then this a a place to spend time. The area is divided up into two main areas Commonwealth War Graves and Civilians. While like all Commonwealth War Graves this area is spotlessly kept in immaculate condition the civilian area was also in good order.
,,Everyone should visit this place,5.0,,"Kranji War Memorial, is a 22 km drive north from Singapore city so a car is necessary. A visit there is an incredibly moving experience – so many dead due to senseless war. This Memorial opened in 1946 as a tribute to men and women from the Commonwealth who lost their lives during WWI. A wander through the 4,400 white gravestones is startling by the sheer number of so very young deaths, aged 17, 20, 22 – such a waste of life. On the hill top terrace there are four Memorials with more than 24,400 names of allied soldiers and airmen killed in SE Asia who have no grave. I came away with the view that everyone should visit this place, if not just to experience the quiet serenity of this place but to understand the horrible impact war has on our civilisation. The Memorial is open from 8am to 6:30pm and is free."
,,Peace come with a price,4.0,,Came here when we were returning from JB to home. A very peaceful place where you will reflect on how many people died for peace in Singapore. There are also President of Singapore buried here. Long before I was born. A good place to walk and enjoy Peace.
,,Beautifully maintained war memorial,4.0,,"Not normally a place one would visit on holiday, however those with relatives who lost their lives during this period will find this a place of peace, with the opportunity to examine a book of named individual graves, and to leave a comment in remember acne of those who lost their lives"
,,A moving experience.,5.0,,"If you need a reminder of the sacrifices made in a war,Kranji is the place which hits home its brutal reality .A peaceful place to reflect and think."
,,Very moving,5.0,,We took the bus here and were so pleased we made the effort. A wonderful atmosphere and beautifully maintained graves and memorial. Proud to be able to say 'we will remember them'.
,,Glad I visited,4.0,,We wanted to visit the war graves as both my husband and his family are ex servicemen. I was glad I went and paid our respects but it isn’t something that would last longer than 30 mins to see it all
,,Hillside war memorial and cemetery,5.0,,"As part of a WW2 bus tour we were taken to the Kranji War Memorial located twenty two kilometres north of Singapore city, the memorial is made up of three cemeteries: The Kranji War Cemetery, the Kranji Military Cemetery and the State Cemetery. The Kranji War Cemetery is the final resting place for over four thousand service man and women from Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Malaya, Sri Lanka, India and The Netherlands during WW2. Memorial services are held on Remembrance Day and ANZAC Day. The grounds are beautifully maintained, well kept gardens and so peaceful.
From the entrance there is a set of stairs taking you up to the gently sloping hillside memorial. The nearest MRT station is Kranji for those catching public transport."
,,The State Cemetery is in the War Memorial.,5.0,,"Kranji War Memorial of Singapore
Woodlands Road, Singapore.

I was waiting for the sun to go down to take sunset pictures with the backdrop of the Memorial Walls of the Kranji War Memorial when dark clouds were fast coming my direction. I had a choice to brave the rain and continue to wait for the sun to go down or make a break out of the War Memorial. I was lucky to head down the hill as the guard was about to close the gates. It was already 6.30 pm, the closing time. I cannot imagine how I were to keep the war casualties company, for the night, if the rain wasn’t on the way.
I managed to capture a few shots of my imaginary sunset at the Memorial.
Earlier, I have walked all the way from Senja Road, my abode, to the War Memorial at 9 Woodlands Road, which is a stone’s throw away from the Kranji MRT station. I started early (3.30 pm) as I wanted to reach Kranji to catch the sunset using the graves as a backdrop. Arriving early I had time to locate the State Cemetery which hangs on the left front and at the far north, and partially hidden, I found the burial place of the First President of Singapore, Inche Yusof bin Ishak. The second President, Benjamin Henry Sheares, sleeps in a simple grave nearer to the entrance and can be seen clearly from the road to the entrance of the Memorial.
Dedicated to the women and men form UK, Australia, Canada, India, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Holland (the Netherlands, New Zealand, Malaya (Malaysia) and Singapore, who died protecting Singapore and Malaya against invading forces during the Second World War, the Krangi War Memorial, comprises the War Graves, Memorial Walls, Military Graves, and the State Cemetery.
The Memorial is a picture of serenity and peace, set on a hilly terrain, with immaculately cropped grass while plants and flowers dotted around each of the 4,458 graves of the Allied servicemen, of which 850 bore no names. 12 columns were inscribed with names 24,000 personnel whose bodies were never found.
As a member of the Singapore Volunteer Corps (SVC) I gave a sincere salute before I departed from the Kranji War Memorial, and with strong thoughts and convictions of the War Memorials I have visited in Kachana Buri (Thailand), Kohima (India) and Arlington, Washington DC."
,,A reflective and sobering memorial,5.0,,I thought that the Singapore people have erected a beautiful memorial garden and cemetery to honor the lives lost in the war. Well done.
,,A somewhat sobering experience.,5.0,,There are no signs of the destruction which must have taken place during WWII. All that remains are some memorials and cemeteries. Kranji War Memorial is both. Brits and Aussies are buried here along with a memorial to many other soldiers from the British Empire. Many unknown soldiers are included among the dead..
,,Thought Provoking Memorial,5.0,,"Commonwealth War cemetery, excellently well kept and very moving to read the names and ages of some of those buried there. Interesting memorial showing the three services. Well worth a visit at anytime, but especially on Remembrance Sunday for the sunrise service."
,,peaceful and thought provoking,5.0,,This is the one place I wanted to visit on our trip to Singapore. It is a short walk from the metro station. it is humbling to read the name and ages of those buried here. It is a very quiet and serene place. It managed by the commonwealth war grave commission and just like the war cemeteries in Europe the area is beautifully manicured with lawns and plants. Be aware there are no toilet facilities here so make use of the facilities at the metro station. This place is a must do whilst in Singapore be sure to sign the visitors book
,,showing some respect,4.0,,Spent some time here in honour of people who lost their lives during the second World War. My father was in the liberation party that ousted the Japanese so we walked in his footsteps while here. So many people lost their lives through out the war here so it is important to remember them.
,,Time to reflect,5.0,,When you visit Singapore you really must get round to visiting Kranji it will take your breath away There is a sense of calm in this mad world of ours
,,War Memorial,5.0,,"This is the resting place for heroes who fought the war. A peaceful place for us to respect and salute the souls, and learn the importance of peace and harmony."
,,Very Good Historical Stops,5.0,,"A wonderful experience with a certified guide, which made the trip completely worthwhile. The guide was able to add details to put our stops into perspective."
,,Memorable,5.0,,"This, in line with all of the Commonwealth cemeteries, is beautifully laid out and a wonderful resting place for all of those that made the ultimate sacrifice. It is peaceful, respectful and a poignant reminder of the futility of war. All children should be taken to such places to learn especially in this anniversary year."
,,Very interesting historical tour,4.0,,"I did a 4 hr. Tour and found it very interesting. The guide makes this tour and she was extremely knowledgeable. Our guide, Wui Wui, was a certified guide."
,,Go and pay your respects - please,5.0,,"In this the centenary year of the armistice can I ask that as many of you visitors to Singapore go to Kranji?
It’s a lovely place, it isn’t sad. Many brave men and women reside their for their eternity. Take your children, let them understand what sacrifices have been made for their futures. I say again it isn’t sad - a young Indian couple were there with their children when my wife and I went and the children were playing with laughter and joy - truly I couldn’t think of a more fitting tribute to those lost, brave soles of all religions, races and nationalities
I salute you, and so does my wife"
,,A trip down memoruy lane,4.0,,Brought the kids here to appreciate the fallen war heroes that sacrificed themselves for the greater good. Inspirational
,,"A Serene Place to Pay Respects, Contemplate and Hope for Peaceful Future Worldwide.",5.0,,"The Kranji War Memorial is a hillside cemetery that is quite beautiful in its serenity once you find it, private transport or taxi /GRAB is the way to go. It is definitely worth the visit if you are into war time nostalgia.
Regardless, honouring the dead who fought for their country is a wonderful thing to do, when you look at the young ages of the soldiers, you have a sense of great loss for the communities they came from.
The memorial honours the men and women from Britain, Australia, Canada, Sri Lanka, India, Malaya, the Netherlands and New Zealand who died in the line of duty during World War II.
There are more than 4,400 white gravestones lined up in rows on the cemetery’s gentle slope. Significantly the Chinese Memorial in plot 44 marks a mass grave for 69 Chinese servicemen who fought for Singapore.
There is nothing Glamorous about this site, only human compassion and gratitude."
,,Incredibly important location and historical landmark,5.0,,"The importance and historical significance of this memorial can not be overstated. Located in a key location, one of the first landing sites of the Japanese invasion of Singapore during World World 2, it is a fitting reminder and appropriate location to pay respects to so many that have lost their lives in the defence and preservation of the freedoms we enjoy today. Regardless of whether or not you are a historian, military person or visitor, I highly recommend dropping by to wander and pay your respects."
,,RESPECT,5.0,,"Whilst holidaying in Singapore we decide to visit the memorial and pay respect to a friends father who was buried here.
This memorial is exceptional. The immaculately curated grounds are a credit to those who look after this very special site. The task of finding the person was made all that much easier as there are registers of name and locations kept on site for all to use.
A very moving and sad memorial and a great piece of our history of the war in Singapore.
Transport vis the MRT takes you well within walking distance to the site. Definite a must see when visiting Singapore for those who have connection with WW11"
,,"Sad, but inspirational",5.0,,Commonwealth war grave for Singapore going back well beyond WW2. Beautifully maintained and a fitting tribute.
,,A respectful monument,5.0,,Four nationalities gave their lives for each of us without prejudice. This iconic simple monument portrays our gratitude for their unselfish actions.
,,a very beautiful place,5.0,,a very beautiful place to visit - a fitting tribute to all those who lay beneath the wings of the memorial.
,,Very humbling,5.0,,This was part of an excellent tour and our guide gave is information concerning some of the soldiers. Like all CWG it was beautifully maintained. A must place to visit
,,Moving and thought-provoking,5.0,,"This thought-provoking slice of history reminds us how intimately the past in Singapore is connected with the British and former colonies/empire, and reminds us that there are personal histories behind each of the names on the gravestones and wall of remembrance. ""At the going down of the sun ... we will remember them"""
,,ANZAC Sunrise service,5.0,,Annual visit to Kranji to remember the war and pay respects. The memorial is very well kept and recommend a visit to.
,,My Godfather Lt Cmdr Donald Davidson is buried there. Good mate of my Father.,5.0,,"This year 2018, September 26th, was the 75th Anniversary of the attack on Singapore harbour, Operation Jaywick my Father Leading Telegraphist Horrie Young was a member of this elite crew. I have been to Kranji a number of times but this year and the 50th Anniversary are very special for me, I am fortunate enough to have attended both events. A beautiful, well kept War Memorial Cemetery, a number of my Fathers good mates are buried there, they were all members of Operation Rimau, all 23 were killed. A special place for me."
,,Beautiful memorial,5.0,,These grounds are beautiful and the stories of the brave young men who rest here are awe inspiring. Placed near where Singapore was invaded it is a historical tour very worth taking
,,LEST WE FORGET,5.0,,"Kranji War Memorial is a massive military cemetery near Woodlands station, north Singapore. It is the dignified, beautifully manicured resting place for thousands of British, Australian, Indian and other Allied soldiers caught up in the defence of Singapore and consequent POWs when Japan invaded during World War II. A ""must see"" if you have an interest in military history."
,,A solum reminder of what war means,3.0,,"Commonwealth war cemetery beautifully maintained in Singapore.The site is a little hard to find with minimal signage until you manage to find the actual entrance road.....Whilst clean & manicurred, it appears to be a little more ""camouflaged"" from public view than the equivalent cemeteries in Europe, almost looked like they dont want too many people to go there. Does provide a reasonable amount of history of the area & why the cemetery is there."
,,part of the Changi tour,5.0,,"A real tribute to the fallen. lest we forget. the fallen buried here were 'bought"" to life with stories told by Carol Dragon on our tour."
,,"ANZAC day, a blessing",5.0,,The war memorial offers a wonderful opportunity to commemorate ANZAC day whilst overseas. Attended for the first time this year and was impressed by how many people made the effort for the dawn service and the integrity offered by the Australian and NZ commissions. Great to see the local AIS school being involved to pass on the importance to the next generations.
,,Stunning place,5.0,,Really quiet place just off the main road. Beautifully maintained and not too many tourists around. I visited in the morning and was all by myself. The place is quite big as it should be as a reminder of the battle of Singapore. I would suggest a visit in the mornings.
,,A fitting memorial,5.0,,"Beautiful grounds, servicemen and women are duly honoured and a fitting memorial for those who gave their lives for peace."
,,Very Overwhelming,5.0,,"We caught the MRT from where we were staying and got off at Kranji station. There are lilte to no sign posts to direct you on where to go once you get out of the train station, but we asked the local police who pointed us in the right direction. You really don't know you are there until you are right at the driveway.. It is a little walk (about half an hour) from the MRT station so make sure you take plenty of water. From the minute you see the place you know exactly what it is. Absolutely overwhelming. The grounds are immaculate. The signs and plaques are so easy to read. There is a memorial book that you can sign.. even some of those messages were sad.
The only reason we went was my dad was there in WW2 and thought it would be nice to get some photos to take back and show him.Such a huge story there. There are rows and rows of graves (some named some still unknown). and walls or names etched in the marble of those who died,
Certainly not on everyone list of things to do whilst on holidays but glad we took the kids and the time to visit."
,,Remembering those who died in the war,5.0,,"We took a 40 minute Metro journey from Fiwntiwn to Kraig station, but other than one very small sign at the station, the War Cemetary at Kranji is almost hidden away.
We followed our noses and in hot/humid conditions walked about 1km and found Kranji War Cemetary,
With a motorway thundering past it's not the entirely peaceful place we had hoped.
Yet, there is something tranquil and awe-inspiring about the grassy slopes of Kranji. The Cemetary like must I've is beutifult maintained. The ages of the young soldiers, flyers and seamen who lost their lives in the Second World War are a stark reminder of the futility of war and its toll. The part of the Cemetary dedicated to Ghurkas and their children is particularly poignant."
,,A different Singapore- A blast from the past,4.0,,"War memorial is basically a vast cemetery of WW2 heroes mostly from Australia, Newzealand & India who lost their lives by fighting for Britain. 8-10 mins walk from Kranji MRT and bring water bottles as it will be damn hot during sunny days.
Inside you will get a chance to go through the register and the names etched on the memorial wall.
a piece of advice for selfie fans: A place to pay your tribute or respect, not for photos"
,,A solemn day,5.0,,"This is a solemn and hallowed ground. Walking the grounds and seeing the numerous individuals from near and far who laid down their lives in the defense of Singapore was a truly humbling experience. The grounds itself is very well done and well maintained. The main structure was carefully designed to represent the three armed services - the columns the army, the 'roof' airplane wings and the central portion the conning tower of a submarine. A place that truly honors are fallen heroes."
,,Tragic History..,4.0,,"Worth a vist, will break your heart when you know the history of the loss of this lovely island in 1942...A bit out of the way but quite accessible by MRT....and bus ride...."
,,Sombre visit,5.0,,"Visited the cemetery as currently doing my wife’s family tree, and came across a family member whose name is etched on the memorial as he has no grave. Like most cemeteries of these sort they are very poignant and silent as well as beautifully well-maintained. Think most people should visit something like this to remind ourselves how fortunate we really are"
,,Incredible experience,5.0,,"As soon as I started walking up the stairs, I was already crying. Very emotional experience. The cemetery itself is incredibly well kept and there is a real beauty about the memorial. Definitely worth checking"
,,A meaningful destination,4.0,,"Kranji War Memorial isn't the typical weekend family/date destination - it's a place for pondering, reflection and for respecting those who have sacrificed their lives for the country, back in the world war. It's a beautifully kept place, very quiet and serene, with a sombre atmosphere. The architecture of the structures are meaningful and represent the trinity of the land, navy and airforce."
,,Beautifully Kept!,5.0,,I couldn't believe two idiots on here gave this a terrible review saying there was nothing to see or do!!!! Its a cemetery!!! An amazing war memorial beautifully kept a fitting tribute to the many who gave their lives so idiots could leave stupid reviews. Take a drink as its a long walk in the heat from the nearest mrt station and maybe an idea to avail yourself of the toilets at mrt too.
,,Makes you think!,5.0,,A very well maintained cemetery as they always are Reading the various inscriptions is very moving - especially those around the Fall of Singapore
,,Mesmerizing..,5.0,,Every year Japanese visit this memorial and give their condolences..It's been so many years that war happened or invasion..It's a very peaceful place and also makes you think about the war heroes..
,,"Solemn, moving",5.0,,"Easy access; just exit Kranji MRT and walk toward the Racetrack. The War Memorial is just a bit further along. Not farther than a 10 minute walk. There's a wide footpath, so you'll be safe in terms of traffic. There's a brown & white sign with an arrow pointing left, and there you are.
It's very well done, and it's easy to find the graves of various countries, branches of service, etc. There are some very nice, moving tributes carved in stone walls in the various languages of the servicemen and women. And there's a handy directory if you're looking for a specific grave.
Everything's beautifully maintained and cared for. A very peaceful setting for the repose of the servicemen and women.
They have some pamphlets available. I took one to bring along to the next meeting at my RSL sub-branch."
,,Peaceful but sombre,5.0,,"I took the mrt from Orchard Rd to Kranji and it's about a 10min walk from the station.
The memorial is very peaceful and what strikes you is how well maintained it is.
An area of historical importance in WW2, reading some of the headstones also made you think about the sacrifices these mainly very young men made."
,,"At the going down of the sun, and in the morning, we will remember them..",5.0,,"I go to Kranji every time I visit Spore, and I never cease to be amazed; amazed at the superb job done by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission; amazed by the peace and tranquillity - and amazed at mans inhumanity to man, causing so many headstones to be marked “Known only unto God.”

Maybe I’m biased - I’m an ex soldier - but surely there is nobody who cannot remember or hasn’t read somewhere about the enormity of the fall of Singapore in those dark days of 1942.

Whether you have, or whether you haven’t - go to Kranji, and you’ll soon learn..."
,,War and Eternal Peace,5.0,,If you have any feeling at all for the sacrifices made by the young men in the Second World War then this is the place to visit and contemplate on the alternative we don't have to live with.
,,Tour,5.0,,"We had an awesome day on this tour. Carol, the guide was very informative and extremely helpful. The tour itinerary was swapped around and substituted with other locations due to the museum closing, however you wouldn’t know( even though we were informed) so glad we did this. It’s a touching and beautiful place. The minutes silence we did was a true mark of respect. Thank you for making our day memorable."
,,A salute to the Fallen,5.0,,"Kranji War Memorial, is a great place to honour our dead who fell during WW11, it is easy to get to by either Train (light rail), car or bus.
A very somber place to stand to view the row upon row of headstones of the fallen.
My wife and I went to see the New Zealanders buried there as I am Ex NZ Army.
The entrance way is via twin gates which lead into the War Graves area.

There is plenty of signage and information there to read and guide one around the site.
We spent about three hours there moving around the different parts of the cemetery
at the top part of the area, all names of those buried there are engraved on the walls.

This was a very moving part as my wife found several of her family there which she did not know about. There is one section for family members as well

The whole area is very well laid out and kept very clean and tidy by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

A very quiet place as well even though two motorways are very close by.
A great place too take children to show them the effects of a war and how many can die from it, A game old men play with the younger generation partaking in."
,,A moving memorial to the fallen allied servicemen of WWII,5.0,,"The memorial and cemetary are walkable from the Kranji MRT station. Ask at the ticket office for directions.
Although the memorial is close to major roads, trees around the edge effectively mask the sound, making it a quiet and tranquil place.The 4000 graves and names of 20000+ service personnel make it a thought provoking place for contemplation.
The memorial is about a 1 hour MRT ride / walk from the centre of the city. There are no toilet facilities or refreshments in teh local area. If you come by MRT, make use of the station facilities, and bring water to drink."
,,a Common Wealth War Graves Commission site,3.0,,"We visited this war cemetery as part of a private guided tour. It is similar to all other cemeteries managed by the Common Wealth War Graves Commission. If you have never visited one of these cemeteries, it is worth the visit. The monuments are not extraordinary."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Go to the Kranji MRT station, its about 1 km walk from the exit. I walked, maybe 15 minutes, if its hot, take a bus or taxi over. Bring water with you as there is obviously nothing at the cemetery. The Memorial is in the middle of nowhere.
I've been to CWGC all over the world, they are always well laid and and respectful, this one is the same.
My fathers cousin is listed on one of the walls, so i had to go while i was in Singapore.
Sadly I didn't see anyone else while i was there....but we should all pay our respects if we can.
Go for a visit."
,,Quiet and serene.,5.0,,"War memorials and war cemeteries are always 'moving' places to visit and Kranji was no exception.
The place is well maintained and as with most [all] war memorials, one cannot help but be struck by the ages recorded on the graves.
As an Australian the fall of Singapore was an historical reality very close to home so a very reflective place indeed. What might have been!"
,,Very moving,5.0,,Part of a day trip I did of the WW2 Invasion of Singapore. I found it very moving and so many Australians buried there.
,,The monument is nothing special,3.0,,"This tall white monument is near the cricket ground, but I felt it was nothing to write home about. Just a white needle-like structure"
,,Serene environment,4.0,,I feel the best time to come is before the sunrise or during sunset. This will avoid the hot weather of Singapore to make the walk more pleasant and soak in the serenity of the place.
,,Remember those who gave their lives,5.0,,"Remember those who are before us. I went there on a business trip. As a Singaporean, this gave me a chance to know my country better. Definitely worth the time."
,,"Impressive well maintained historical landmark, beautiful & peaceful",5.0,,"We drove there as we listed that location as one of our “Explore SG North/West” staycation. We are Singaporeans but we didn’t really hang around this part of Singapore that much so we started off with this location as the start of our countryside trail..... a place packed with gratitude to those who have lost their lives while defending our county. Beautifully maintained place, filled with dignity & respect. Go around late afternoon to witness the view from the highest point of the memorial & you will be able to see Malaysia and the surrounding lower ground.. you will be able to capture some beautiful sunset landscape pictures as well."
,,Sombre point for reflection,3.0,,"As you might expect, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission keep the cemetery in pristine condition. The rather brutalist 60's architecture doesn't quite have the serenity evoked by Lutyen's works in Flanders."
,,Solemn,5.0,,The grounds are beautifully maintained. The plaque at the entrance to the Memorial shows how the Japanese managed to defeat a superior force.
,,A place to ponder. & remember,5.0,,"Singapore suffered much during the War years of the early 1940's
following the fall of Singapore to the Japan Army in respect its of Invasion. From Japan, The British were unable to defend properly due the battles in Europe with Germany, it was a terrible situation for every one, especially for the Fallen Of Singapore. War offers very little, only unwelcome death of many people young and old alike"
,,Very moving,4.0,,So sad walking through here seeing the age of so many young soldiers. Even sadder seeing many without a name. There is a wall that shows all names at the top.
,,Their name liveth for evermore,5.0,,"I came here to pay my respects to those who made the ultimate sacrifice, paid the ultimate price for my freedoms today.
A very well maintained Commonwealth War Graves memorial cemetery, solemn & moving.
When I visited there were a bunch of school kids there, keenly learning about it which was very uplifting to see.
I caught the MRT to Kranji station and walked 5-10min to reach the memorial and spent about an hour there."
,,A Place for History,4.0,,"located in the Cemetry , this place is for the history lovers ... again not a a history fan but well maintained is this place .. must visit"
,,Sobering place to visit,4.0,,"went there with my two children to see where their Grandfathers brother is buried, he was one of the 10 Z force men that were beheaded by the Japanese at the end of WW2, my grown children stood next to his grave with tears in their eyes, we do not know how lucky we are to live in peace. Kranji is a beautiful place that holds such horrible secrets."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,All I can say is when in Singapore visit here. The train station is about a 15 minute walk from here. Easy access and a stunning place. A walk through here is very quiet and moving remembering the fallen and the sacrifice they made. Definitely will be back for a visit.
,,Sad,4.0,,"Inside the Kranji cemetery is the Singapore memorial which bears the names of 24,000 of the commonwealth land and air forces who have no known grave. Many have no known date of death and are listed by the date or area from when they were known to be missing or captured."
,,A place to remeber,3.0,,This four cornered war memorial is a tribute to the men and women who gave their lives to ensure world freedom. A quite place for peace and to remember.
,,Memorial,4.0,,"Being from London,I really wanted to see this memorial.Short drive from city and there you are.So many forces and people with cultural differences fighting together !"
,,Well kept and quiet,5.0,,"I am happy I got to see it. It is quite far - a lot to go by metro, but it is quite accessible - just a short walk from the metro station. When I went there was no one else around and I could take some moments away from the noise of the city to think about those who died there (some younger than me). You can also leave a message in the guest book; the place is also great for photography. But bring an umbrella. I was caught in a sudden rain and the place is a bit away from other buildings."
,,So many young lives lost.,4.0,,"This is well maintained war memorial and cemetery. Looking at the names on the headstones, it is amazing to find the diversity of people who died defending this part of the British Empire."
,,lest we forget,5.0,,Being half british and half aussie I like to seek out and visit such sites to honor the brave men of my homes. This is an amazingly beautiful tribute. Well maintained
,,Somber remembrance of the sacrifice,4.0,,"The sacrifice of so many for the defense of Singapore. The Kranji War Memorial is dedicated to the men and women from the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Sri Lanka, India, Malaya, the Netherlands and New Zealand who died defending Singapore and Malaya against the invading Japanese forces during World War II, it comprises the War Graves, the Memorial Walls, the State Cemetery, and the Military Graves.

Very laid out and easy to navigate. Well worth the time to pay respect for those who gave the ultimate sacrifice for you to enjoy the freedom visit Singapore today."
,,Respectful,5.0,,Well kept cemetery as is always the case with CWGC. Well laid out and it was nice to pay respects to those who will NEVER be forgotten.
,,Beautifully kept memorial,5.0,,"One of the most striking and well maintained memorials of its kind. Fitting tribute to all who paid the ultimate price. The names on the wall are a sobering and sad reminder of the sacrifices made by so many.
Singapore can be proud of this memorial."
,,A beautiful place.,5.0,,"The Kranji MRT is about 1100 meters from the cemetery, however, it is very well signposted. It will take about 15 minutes to walk. Take something to drink as there are no amenities there or nearby.
A very well maintained cemetery and memorial. The CWGC can be proud of what they do here in the remembrance of the fallen.
There is more than one memorial to the missing in this cemetery, just wander through the panels. There are also thousands of headstones in the surrounding plots.
A peaceful final resting place for our fallen. When our service members fall on the field of battle, they earn the right to live forever."
,,Well thought out,5.0,,"Easy to get to location and worth a look up at from the 'inside'. In the 4 languages of Singapore, very tastefully built - and very, very high!"
,,Beautiful Yet Sad,4.0,,beautiful yet sad homage to those that died in WW2. Very serene and peaceful. Its a must see for anyone in Singapore for the first time.
,,Some history.,4.0,,"While walking around Singapore (our favourite way of visiting cities) we just ""walked into"" the place. Stopping for a while we read about the place in our Polish guide."
,,Impressive Memorial,4.0,,Happened upon this Memorial as we walked back to our hotel after our Singapore Slings in Raffles. Very impressive structure in well kept grounds.
,,Great Memorial,4.0,,"Fascinating, informative and very interesting, hard to believe that a place on this busy, highly populated island can bee so serene and calming."
,,Interesting trip,4.0,,It's a story of WW2 in Singapore. Spend some time reading up on the history of Singapore and visit Kranji War Memorial to have a better understanding. This trips makes me more patriotic and definitely learnt a lot of Singapore past.
,,Unique Place in the north of Singapore,4.0,,"This place is actually not easy to get to and if you must, take a bus from the Kranji Mrt station. If I am not wrong it is TIBS 961. There is not entrance fee etc required just a memorial area with structures. It is peaceful and tranquil, but the area around it is always under construction so gets a be messy."
,,Pristine Condition,4.0,,"Amazingly kept war cremitorium . We owe a big debt to all the dead honoured here ,so spending some time here is showing the fallen the respect they are due ."
,,Peaceful remembrance,4.0,,I am filled with deep reverence as I walk among the tombstones. To think that each name was once a young recruit or an older officer who walked this earth. We owe so much to those who gave their lives.
,,War Memorial Kranji,5.0,,"Kranji Memorial was the main reason I decided to visit Singapore.My uncle was killed during the Japanese invasion in 1942 and though his body was never found his name along with those of 24000 others is engraved on the beautiful Wall Memorial.The Commonwealth War Graves Commission has done a beautiful job , the Cemetery and the areas surrounding the Wall Memorial are pristine and there is a respectful peaceful feeling to the place.There is a Visitors Book where you can record your thoughts."
,,Beautifully kept,5.0,,If you have the time take the train out to Kranji (there is a SMRT station there). You can walk to the memorial/cemetery which is beautifully maintained by the Commonwealth Graves Commission. A walk between the graves and around the memorial in these peaceful grounds gives you time to reflect on the waste of war.
,,Commonwealth War Cemetery so beautifully kept,5.0,,We visited on Remberence Day but there was only a dress rehearsal for the British 11th November timing. The cemetery is beautifully kept and very respectful. There is an MRT station within walking distance just past the Singapore Racing Club. Take plenty of water and a hat as it is very hot.
,,A place to honor war veterans,4.0,,This is a monument in a park near raffles hotel and st Anthony church. A place to honor war vets....
,,"Perfectly maintained, perfectly peaceful",5.0,,"Visited 1 Nov 2017.
Take the MRT red North South line out of central Singerpore to station NS7, then bus 178, 960 or 961, only one stop to Kranji CWGC site. Walk back down the road 150M, turn right at big brown sign. Walk a further 500M up this narrow, but clean and open road to the entrance.
It's absolutely perfectly maintained. So moving. Hundreds upon hundreds of headstones and a further 24,000 names on the wall of those lost in action."
,,Probably a must see in Singapore,5.0,,"This was our first visit to any war memorial outside of Europe. In scale the losses are comparable to many of the large Flanders or Somme Cemeteries, and equal in the waste of human life, but these sacrifices make possible the peace that we hope for.
The care and attention to all the landscaping and grave markers is remarkable, creating a calm and peace that we have come to expect of the CWGC."
,,Lest we forget,5.0,,"A moving and sobre area of Singapore that pays tribute to those who gave their lives for our tomorrow's.

Thank you to everyone that keeps the area so well kept.

The only disappointing thing was a number of maids were having a picnic, laughing, joking and taking selfies around the memorial and the grave stones. I had to tell them off and tell them to be more respectful of the surroundings."
,,hauntingly quiet beautifully kept,5.0,,"This a very moving place, impeccably maintained by the Commonwealth Graves Commission. It is sobering to wander through the rows and rows of headstones and the walls which record the sacrifice of many nationalities and faiths who fought and died against a common enemy.
Strangely, when we visited there was construction in a field near the entrance road, which has turned the runoff water in the storm drain blood red, a reminder of the reason this place exists...
Getting here fairly easy, MRT to Kranji station, then a fifteen minute walk from the left of the exit. Two stops on a bus, not far but in the heat welcome. The walk from the entrance adds about five minutes,
My one suggestion to improve things would be some form of toilet, port-a - loos if not permanent ones. Many of the visitors will be older and there are no facilities. Tip, use the public loos at Kranji station!"
,,Another Must Visit in Singapore to Respect Those Who Died and Suffered,5.0,,A pleasant and well laid out location to sit and reflect on those awful days and what this part of Singapore looked like during wartime.
,,Pay your respects,5.0,,"We visit my husband's grandfather every time we visit Singapore. It is easy to get to. Just take the MRT to the Kranji station and either walk, taxi or bus it. It is about 600 metres down the road."
,,Quiet and Peaceful,3.0,,It is a lesser known and frequented place. A good place to step away from the city noises and just enjoy the quietness.
,,Kranji war memorial.. they died for all free men..,5.0,,"Kranji war memorial is located in the woodlands road in northern singapore. It's the war memorial of those who have died during the world war II. It represents the three branches of the military services. The memorial comprises the war graves, memorial walls and cemetery. It's worth visiting this place during the trip to singapore and we can have a view of this during the sight seeing trips. Never miss it"
,,"Serene, Poignant and with a Lovely View",5.0,,"Singapore soldiers who died in WW II defending their country are buried here. The site is serene, somber and poignant. Once you walk to the top of the landscaped hill, past many graves, a beautiful view to the sea is on display. Recommended."
,,Very moving.,5.0,,A long train ride to Kranji and then a fair walk in high humidity to the cemetery but I told myself that was nothing compared to what our soldiers had to endure. The war memorial is beautifully maintained. Lots of tasteful flowers and plants which are carefully tended. Simple and respectful. Information is there to be read also. There should be more information on how to get there and the isolation of the site for those who are travelling on their own.
,,A good reminder to be thankful,5.0,,This memorial is in a beautiful setting which perhaps makes it all the more sobering. It is such a good reminder to current generations to be thankful for the freedom we have.
,,Beautifully maintained CWG Kranji War Cemetery,5.0,,"Our tour visted our War Dead from NZ, every NZ grave was visited, we remembered those who paid the ultimate sacrifice. Our group of 37 NZ Veterans held a Service In the grounds, a very moving & spiritual experience."
,,Well maintained memorial,4.0,,"A moving tirbute to those who have their lives, with those laid to rest not separated by rank, race or religion, rather all side by side.

Beautiful floral arrangements well kept by the many gardeners I saw. It's also not very hard to run into a few cheeky lizards.

Out of the main buzz of Singapore buy only a 10 minute walk from kranji station."
,,Memories,4.0,,"The war memorial remembers those who sacrificed, served and died in the war in Singapore. They are part of the country's history and are forever remembered and immortalised."
,,Tranquil and Dignified,5.0,,"This is one of my go-to places when I need to reflect with some peace and quiet. The gardeners do an amazing job of keeping the grounds pristine looking at all times and giving the men and women who gave their lives to defend Singapore the dignity they well deserve. Every tombstone is adorned with a different flower and each tells a story of a life sacrificed for a greater cause. One of the best things you can do for your soul is to stroll amongst the tombstones reflecting on each of the lives taken away at a young age, especially the nameless ones carved simply with ""Known Unto God"". One of the most beautiful and best-kept secrets in Singapore."
,,For those who want to remember,5.0,,So beautifully done. Such a serene place to remember the sacrifices of those who have given us our current lifestyle.
,,Beautiful peaceful place,5.0,,"We visited the War Memorial today. It was a beautiful but sad place where so many young men are laid to rest. The memorial is very well maintained. We were lucky that a man named Bruce who is ex naval personnel was showing some other Australians around and explaining some of the history.They also gave us a lift back into the city. Beware that are no Toilets or other facilities here or nearby. The MRT would be quite a walk in the heat.We took a taxi to the Memorial for about $18. The taxi may wait for you. It was very quiet when we went there. It is a pity that more Australians, British and Indians don't visit."
,,not huge,3.0,,went as a learnign journey nice place but no a lot there just teh graves which if u have tiem to go thru slowly and teh names carved all is very touchign buut nota s a rush but nota lot there and hard toget to
,,Very sombre and reflective place,5.0,,We went on a tour and our guide gave us some background into the Japanese invasion of Singapore in WW1. The background included how the Japanese mistreated and in many cases murdered locals as well as allied troops. With this background fresh in ours minds we strolled through the Memorial grounds. I have been to the Bomana Cemetery in Port Moresby and they both have a similar feel. A sombre place to reflect on those who sacrificed their lives so we might live better lives. Well worth a visit.
,,A place to visit,5.0,,"One has to go if you are Australian, English , Indian etc etc to pay respect to these fallen men. When you see the age of some of these men it breaks your heart to see such waste. A MUST."
,,Beautifully Maintained,5.0,,"The war memorial is located just over half a mile away from Kranji MRT station. I came unstuck using the Map application on my iPhone as it erroneously sent me up the Turf Club Flyover and pretty much doubled my journey in the heat. When you get to the junction with the flyover, go straight across rather than left then take the signposted road (Woodlands Avenue) which is about 50 yards further on.

I was the only person visiting at the time and there was a sea of headstones in a much cared for park. The memorial is uphill behind the graves, although I did not walk up to it.

Over 4,000 allied troops died in the conflict in Singapore with the invading Japanese. Many of these were from Australia and India, and it was near Kranji that the crucial invasion was made thus leading to the fall of Singapore.

A moving experience along with the other WWII related sites on the island."
,,"Peaceful, quiet reflection amidst an important piece of history",4.0,,"The Kranji War Memorial is the final resting place for thousands who gave their lives defending Malaya/Singapore. Most were young men from India, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.

Some have gravestones but many do not. Their names are inscribed here to honor them and remind us that we are the beneficiaries of the peace and prosperity that is Singapore today.

Come visit and take the time to read the names and identify with those who had so little time to enjoy what we have today."
,,An emotional experience,5.0,,We had a guide take us through this Memorial. The guide explained some of the writings on the head stones & showed us meaningful areas. A very moving & emotional experience. The grounds are kept immaculate & the views towards the city are beautiful.
,,Moving,5.0,,"This is a eye opening memorial. Not just the sheer number of grave stones but the number of different crests highlighting who they fought for.
The memorial is very clean and maintained. There is some information at the front gates but we did this in conjunction with a round Island tour which provided us with more information."
,,Confronting,5.0,,"This is a ""must do"" when in Singapore🇸🇬. The realisation of how many lives were lost, the stupidity of those in leadership and a so much better understanding of what actually happened. Very sobering indeed. Lest We Forget is so apt."
,,Awesome tribute to the fallen soldiers,4.0,,A must see tribute to the fallen soldiers from the Japanese invasion of Singapore. Head stones from the soldiers from many different countries are together in an amazing location.
,,Beautiful Memorial.,5.0,,"This was on our to do list as we wanted to see the memorial where my husband's great uncle's name is engraved on the wall. A beautiful memorial in memory of so many brave people. The grounds, like all Commonwealth War Cemeteries, is wonderfully maintained.

There is an MRT nearby and we opted for a taxi (we paid around 20 SGDs which included the driver waiting for us and taking us back to the station)."
,,Slice of history,4.0,,"It's a beautiful spot with a sombre message. We were able to look up our relative and find their spot without difficulty, and the spend 30 minutes walking through the manicured grounds. Not for everyone, but for us, time well spent."
,,How to get to Singapore war cemetery Kranji,4.0,,"Closest subway is Kranji on red North/South line, and from there it is about an 800m walk, alternatively it is about a ~S$30 taxi ride from down town. Definitely worth going to pay your respects at this moving place. It is very noticeable the large number of ""unknown soldiers"" or ""buried near here"", much higher compared to other war grave sites. The grounds are peaceful and impeccably maintained.
Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
,,A beautifully kept memorial,5.0,,"Kranji is a little out of the way, but not actually difficult to get to - catch the MRT from the centre, and a bus from Kranji station, then it's a short walk up the road to the Memorial. As with all Commonwealth War Graves sites, it is impeccably kept and is a serene memorial to many people who lost their lives during the Second World War, including many of the local peoples. On the day we visited, we were the only two in the memorial for the whole time we were there, but we would recommend it to anyone for a visit - it's worth the trek!"
,,Give your respects,5.0,,A silence hangs over the area and you think of what all these people went through in the war. Most of us have no idea and no only what we have been told and seen in films. They need to be remembered
,,Nicely maintained cemetery with war heros,4.0,,Walk into the site and one could sense the great acts of the heros involved in the fight against Singapore enemies way back in history.
,,The number of headstones makes you take in the reality of war...,5.0,,"Used to enjoy going to the Kranji War Memorial for Anzac Day Services.
Spend some time viewing the headstones and you really come away with the reality of how young some of the fallen were - it's an interesting place to spend some time and contemplate.

Not on the tourist track but well worth the visit - plus as you drive out to Kranji you an really see how the locals live."
,,A cemetery where peace usurps war,5.0,,"Although Singapore has a tropical climate, it seems like the breezes at Kranji keep this hallowed ground blessed by cooling breezes. It is located just high enough to catch the cooling ocean breezes as visitors can see Indonesia from it's vistas. What's most impressive about Kranji is how much history is observable by walking it's headstones and monuments. This is a ceretery dedicated to World War I and World War II plus respects the graves of Chinese victms of World War II and Mala Muslims. It's where all who defended the freedom during the Battle for Singapore are now resting in peace and with full dignity. ."
,,Well Maintained..!,4.0,,"Well Maintained memorial, the place is calm and history of the memorial is all we need to go through before going inside.. Can spend around an hour at leisure .. But i will not recommend this as a must watch in Singapore.."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,This amazing place of solemn respect to those who are at rest here is quite beautiful. So carefully looked after. Very emotional to the visitor. Please go.
,,Remembering,5.0,,"Came to remember my Uncle who died in the war, and who I had never met. Very emotional experience. Wouldn't have missed it for the world."
,,Very respectful,5.0,,"I have visited many overseas War Cemetaries and they are all immaculate and very respectful places . This is no different . Obviously a place of sadness when you look at the ages but such a mixture of nationalities & regiments . Hundreds of headstones , plus the unknown , if only the world could learn from the past ."
,,Remembering the past,5.0,,Singapore has progressed to this level all because they had gone through this terrible disaster. When a country remembers its history and work with pride to not let this happen again they will always prosperr. The sad part is that not many tourists visit this museum. It is so well maintained and holds so much of its history. A lesson to be learnt.
,,Difficult to get to,4.0,,If you are using public transport it will be pretty difficult to get to. Well maintained memorial to all those who laid down their lives 75 years ago. To me this was a personal pilgrimage. My great uncles name is also on the wall.
,,Sombre but respectful,4.0,,This is very well maintained and is s fitting tribute to the British and Commonwealth soldiers who lost their lives trying to defend Singapore during the war.
,,Lest We Forget,4.0,,The Kranji War Cemetery as well as the Changi Museum was part of our Anzac Day tour after Hellfire Pass and Kanchnaburi War Cemetery. It reflects those who gave up their lives for our freedom. Glad to be able to pay my respects to the fallen and as usual the site is kept is an immaculate condition.
,,A very moving visit,5.0,,"We visited Kranji as a natural step having been to the Battlebox in Fort Canning and wished to pay our respects to all those who died far from home in the name of freedom.
As with all Commonwealth War Cemetries and war memorials the grounds are immaculate and well tended by the staff. The graves and memorials tell their own story and it is very moving to read the young ages of those who gave their lives and the names of those who have no known resting place. There are also a number of civilian graves.We arrived in a thunderstorm which added to the atmosphere. Well worth a visit.
It is easy to get to Kranji on the MRT and then a short bus ride. Be warned there are no toilets so use those at the MRT station."
,,A war memorial,3.0,,"Don't expect too much even if you are a history buff. This is, as you would have expected it to be, a war memorial"
,,Was priviledged to be able to attend the Anzac dawn service 2017,5.0,,"The Kranji War Memorial Anzac Dawn Service is a perfect time to visit this Cemetery which commemorates those that lost their lives in war. However you can visit this memorial at another time. It is about 1/2 hour out of town, depending on traffic, but well worth it."
,,Small well planned cemetry,5.0,,Memorial is nicely designed out/. paying tribute to the soldiers who died during the war. There is a tour that includes this visit to learn more.
,,ANZAC Dawn Service,5.0,,"Very moving and special experience at the ANZAC Day Dawn Service. This War Memorial is very well looked after and all the headstones and monuments are surrounded by flowers and shrubs. My uncle was killed during the Fall of Singapore in Feb 1942, so this was an emotional visit for me and a wonderful way to remember him and all those who fought in the many wars over the last century. Definitely a must visit, even for the young, at any time of the year but if you do happen to be there on the 25th April, very special."
,,Awesome tribute to those who gave their lives.,5.0,,Very moving experience! Very pleased to see the Australian Government through the Commonwealth War Graves Commission have assisted our Singaporean friends to produce and maintain this tribute to all who gave their lives for freedom.
,,A wonderful moving place,5.0,,"I have visited twice and found it a most moving and peaceful place , humbling and
Very frightening to see the ages of these boys and to think what they went through
I suggest a visit to the Battle box first, a not to miss place, then changi jail museum
Finishing with Kranji, a most humbling day out if you have time."
,,Small but beautifully maintained,4.0,,"A fitting memorial to the fallen of Singapore Military activity which is lovingly and carefully maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Anyone with a relative interred here but unable to visit, should be take great comfort from the conscientious nature of the ground staff"
,,Kranji War Memorial,5.0,,When In Singapore try to go an visit the Kranji War Memorial. This is the location where Australians/ British / New Zealanders / Indian / Singaporeans tried to hold off the huge Japanese hoard charging down the Malay Peninsula. When you look at the magnificently maintained grounds you cant help but get a huge lump in your throat and feel saddened at the loss of young life trying to save Singapore. A sad but moving visit is a must.
,,Well kept,4.0,,A lovely quiet memorial to the fallen of WW2. Beautifully kept and gardener's there are very helpful if younger support to find certain memorials.
,,A Tribute to the War Dead,5.0,,"Reaching this cemetery is not easy from the MRT and it's probably best to take t taxi from Kranji to the cemetery itself .

There are two cemeteries here: the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery and the State Cemetery.

The State Cemetery on the right after the main gate is the final resting place of Singapores first and second Presidents. The first, Yusof Ishak who tomb is in the far corner, surrounded by a hedge is the same President who's head appears on the banknotes. Benjamin Shears is the other President here.

We then enter the main gate - so many war dead. Singapore fell in February 1942 and many of the graves stem from this time. There are British, Australian, New Zealand, Indian and others. How sad is war - look no further. The cemetery is immaculately kept and is serene and embraces solitude. It abounds in wildlife also - birds, butterflies and reptiles. Take a while and walk around. If you took a taxi there, you could walk back to the station as it's all downhill from the cemetery. It will also afford opportunities to spot birds and butterflies.

Enjoy, understand the history and significance of this monument, and above all, respect those who have given their lives for their country. Those who rest under a foreign soil, may they rest in peace."
,,Well preserved and respectful.,4.0,,"This place is a little out the way but don,t let that stop you going for a look and remember our Australian and allied forces fallen .the grounds are immaculate and well taken care of ,very respectful to those that gave their lives for our freedoms"
,,Solemn and Moving,5.0,,"Visiting Singapore? interested in wartime historical places? then visit the Kranji war cemetery, very moving and a must for your to do list."
,,A place of rest,5.0,,We went to this place of rest for over 24000 soldiers. Thank you Singapore people for looking after this war memorial.
,,Remembering the sacrifices.,5.0,,"A truly awe inspiring memorial to the horrors of the occupation. The grounds are kept immaculate and are outstanding. This is a place of remembrance and as such does not have any facilities. it is accessible to the less active but there are steps up to the memorial and a fairly long walk up from the road although taxis can take you right in.
To get there take the MRT to Kranji station and NOT Woodlands as stated by some travel guide books, from Kranji Station the 172 bus will take you to the Memorial entrance."
,,To give a little bit of respect for there sacrifice,4.0,,It's a beautiful memorial to the memory of the Singapore nation. The wars make you ask Why Why Why...will we ever learn the lessons.
,,Amazing historical sight,4.0,,It was a very historical sight for Singapore and I have learnt so much here by talking to the locals and also reading up on the internet before coming as I love Singapore's rich history.
,,Remembering their sacrifice,5.0,,"I am always rendered speechless by Commonwealth War Graves Cemetaries and this one is no different. It is quite a hike to get to (the North South MRT to Kranji, then any bus 2 stops to the left, then turn left then up the road on the right) but it is worth the effort to see the final resting place of those who died during WWII and remember the immense hardships they suffered for King, Country and Empire."
,,Best route from Singapore city centre,5.0,,Hi just came back from very very worthwhile visit to cemetery. I was a little concerned at trying to get to it by public transport as it is 22km from city center. .. but it really was so simple . Simply find a bus stop that services bus number 961 tell the driver your going to bus stop oppsite kranji war memorial it cost about $4 for 2 people make sure you have the right change as they don't give change from bigger notes .simply stay on this bus (appox an hour) there's loads of stops but there is a sign in the bus which shows the next stop just keep your eye on it when you get off the bus at kranji war memorial look across the road for the brown tourist sign there is a small road / avenue just walk up it for about 400m it has black and white painted kerbs after your visit come back down the avenue and the bus stop is 20m on the left again bus number 961 when you see the bus coming put your arm out to flag it down it is this easy hope you enjoy your vist
,,Must for people into military history,5.0,,Visited twice. Basically a cemetry converted into a war memorial. Gives details of all who laid down their lives and could be identified while defending Singapore in WW II . Special interest for Indians since Indian contingent was the biggest.
,,"Respect, love and peace for all",4.0,,"This is a well known historic site in Singapore. Historic as it has the plaque reminding all tourists of the young brave soldiers from the west and in Asia who fought and laid their lives during the WWII. Many dided and remain unknown. There is a large monument remembering the dead along with the star of the common wealth and pillar, several walls with names of all those who fought in the battle. Take time and pay your respects to our history. There is no shade, free entrance bur carry water."
,,Lest we Forget,5.0,,"A sobering reminder of how more than just soldiers get caught up in war. The diversity of ethnic groups finding this as their last resting place is a story in itself.A beautifully kept CWGC resting place for those who fought for what we enjoy today,We will remember them."
,,Nostalgia,5.0,,My parents visited this site many years ago as my mothers brothers name is on the memorial. Went on a tour of the Battkefields that stopped here and I found the name. An amazing cemetery and memorial and very sad
,,Poignant and thought provoking,4.0,,"Though a little out of the city it is well worth the visit. WW2 in Asia is often overlooked in history so I'm pleased I went to learn more about it and to pay my respects. The memorial is about a 10-15min walk from the Kanji MRT station, it is well sign posted and Google maps works in the area. No need to spend more than an hour here and bring water as it isn't in the shade. Memorial offers good views of the city too. Isn't a must see but well worth the visit if you want to go."
,,Tour,5.0,,A stunning and very moving memorial to those who fell in the war so that we all could have our freedom. You can trace any fallen relatives here. Mainly a sac troops who fell but British troops as well
,,Very Poingnant,4.0,,"Worth visiting, given the history of Singapore. Be prepared to feel totally blown away when you see to total loss and it brings a sadness just seeing the total loss of lives"
,,Paying our respects,4.0,,"Set on a hill overlooking Singapore from the north of the island is this well tended war graves cemetery. As well as remembering those who fell in the battle trying to save Singapore, various memorials remember those who died afterwards in the former on site hospital and who were buried in a communal grave, as well as those who were killed elsewhere in SE Asia. As always, it's heart rending.

We were surprised to find gravestones of soldiers who died as late as 1945, but presumably they died of their injuries or, like a relative of mine, of their maltreatment and subsequent declining health.

From Kranji MRT stop head north and cross over the large junction taking the first left access road to the cemetery. There is also a bus (160?) from the MRT. We caught a bus to the city centre after the visit, which gave us a tour of the well planned suburbs and of the jungle/ countryside of Singapore away from the tourist and commercial centres."
,,Have visited this Commonwealth Cemetery many times.,5.0,,The War graves commission keep Kranji in pristine condition. The many young men & women who are commemorated there paid the ultimate price for our freedom. May they rest in peace.
,,Beautifully kept cemetery,4.0,,"This is a large memorial, brings home the sadness of the wars. It is well maintained & peaceful. We went by taxi, asked for Kranji War Memorial & had no issues getting there."
,,sad,5.0,,always a sad place to visit. Hard to get too and from but it is kept spotless by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission
,,A fitting memorial,5.0,,Being ex military my wife and I decided to visit here whilst stopping over in Singapore. The cemetery is extremely well maintained and made for a very pleasant hours visit.
,,Beautiful Hommage To The Fallen,4.0,,"I moving experience to walk amongst the fallen. The Memorial is beauitfully maintained with lovely flowers surrounding the grave markers.

It sits on a hill with a view of the city in the distance. A place of peace and reflection for those who have given so much."
,,A moving and long overdue visit KRANJI WAR MEMORIAL,5.0,,A tremendously emotional visit.... I was heartened by many school parties.... I left my own Memorial my RAF CHANGI Tie... and a memory from England.... I wept at the tragic loss of human life.. I was 23 when I was RAF Hospital Changi... a lot of these lads were younger than me
,,Easily reached by MRT station and then a short walk - beautifully kept cemetary,5.0,,"Somewhere I always visit as my grandfather was killed in 1942 (World War 2) and his name is on the walls of the cemetery.

A special place for me but well worth a visit and a reminder of the dark times of Singapore and the world 75 years ago, so many young men buried here and who died of all forces in the conflict. Beautifully kept.

It takes about 15 minutes to walk here from Kranji MRT station, best to take water with you and a hat as very hot walking here, there is however a path all the way and you just need to cross one road.

There are no toilet facilities so best to visit the ones at the MRT station first."
,,Lest we forget,5.0,,"40,000 graves of soldiers who died in Singapore. Some headstones have the poignant heading ""buried somewhere near"" Beautifully kept"
,,Solemn and thought provoking,5.0,,"The first time, I walked straight past the Kranji War Memorial without digesting what it was that I was passing. But my second walk-by was different. I stopped to take in how significant it truly is.

I had mixed feelings about this memorial: respect for the brutality that befell the armed services of so many nations that fought to protect Singapore; a moment of reflection for the fallen in the line of duty; the horrors that the local Singaporeans endured at the hands of the brutal Japanese invaders. And then the thoughts of young people who never knew any of this. Even Japanese tourists.

There is no question that the Kranji Memorial is poignant and thought-provoking.

It is a small monument surrounded by huge office buildings, yet carrying a bigger message than anything looking down upon it. A reminder to people of all ages that nothing is forgotten."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Easy to get to by public transport (MRT to Kranji, then two bus stop ride and 5 minute walk), the cemetery is beautifully maintained with lovely flowers and shrubs.

The ranks of tombstones, some with notations from parents or wives and kids, some of soldiers unknown are very moving. There is information at the gate on tomb location so it is easy to locate ones relative. Seeing the lists of names inscribed on the various memorials reinforces the awfulness of war, and especially the war in Singapore.

So peaceful today."
,,Beautifully kept,5.0,,"Visited the commonwealth graves site at kranji on a short holiday in Singapore. This is a very peaceful site on the former pow site at kranji on the north of the island. As you would expect, the grounds are immaculate with gardeners working there when we visited. For those who have visited the Somme and Ypres areas, apart from the heat, the only difference is that some of the flowers and the trees are more exotic. The memorial has names of allied servicemen killed on Singapore.

Easy 10 minute walk from the kranji north-south underground station but not well signed, so ask for directions at the station. Also, we used an uber taxi to get there from the former ford factory museum (well worth a visit) and the driver hadn't heard of the cemetery - also not signed from main road."
,,A moving experience,5.0,,This well kept memorial stands on a hill overlooking Singapore. It is a very moving place. It is peaceful and thought provoking and is well worth the trip out of the city. It is hard to appreciate the number of lives lost during the war.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Stunning memorial and war graves. Beautifully maintained. Very interesting place well worth a.visit.
,,Lest we forget,5.0,,"It has long been a wish of mine to visit this memorial. My uncle died in Singapore 13th February 1942
A stop over on Route to Sydney gave me just that opportunity.
I was struck by the peacefulness and beauty of this monument The grounds look as if they are combed each day
The graves have flowers well tended.
Just immaculate.
It is a somber place but we'll worth a visit to pay your respects"
,,Peaceful and Humbling,5.0,,"A well kept memorial, lovingly maintained by a wonderful team of groundskeepers - thank you.
My trip to the war memorial was peaceful and humbling. I spent a couple of hours paying my respects to the brave people who defended Singapore to their last breath. It was a great experience and of utmost importance to me as a Singaporean who has lived internationally for a decade.
Easily walkable from Kranji MRT, the memorial is a crucial stop for anyone interested in the history of Singapore, South East Asia and the fall of the British Empire."
,,Lucky day to visit,5.0,,"My wife has an uncle whose name is recorded as one of the 24000 + service personnel who died but have no grave marker. On the day of our visit some 100 local school children were there as part of their history project and were holding a service of remembrance including the playing of the last post and flag raising ceremony. At This time we were the only members of the public to witness this event. The kids were around 13/14 yes of age and took this very seriously as a mark of respect. As others have already said the memorial is outstanding, difficult maybe to visit, but must be worth it. A very moving tribute."
,,A very important of Singapore's history,5.0,,"Poignant - That's how we feel every time we visit. We make it a point to attend the annual ceremony on Remembrance day (2nd Sunday in Nov). It's beautifully maintained and as we read the numerous names of soldiers who gave their lives on our island, we feel sorry and subsequently grateful that they are part of who we are today. A must visit for every and anyone who is interested in the history of Singapore."
,,Beatiful and poignant.,5.0,,"This war memorial is so beautifully tended, it is so well looked after and set out, very sobering and a beautiful meemorial to all those who gave their lives."
,,Moving and peaceful,5.0,,"Only a 10 minute walk from Kranji MRT. We had a personal reason for visiting but it would be a moving experience for anyone. Beautifully tended grounds away from the bustle of the city. Easy to reflect on the sacrifice of so many Allied troops.
We followed this up with a visit to the Changi Museum which helps put Singapore during WW2 into context"
,,Kranji War Memorial,5.0,,"Like all British War Graves cemeteries, this is impressive, relaxing, sad and beautiful all at the same time.
I could spend hours there it is so peaceful and, to bring you back to reality, read some of the gravestones and realise how many young people gave up their lives so that we can live in peace today. We should thank them. It does not glorify war, it brings no blame, it simply brings reality to the consequences and horrors of war. Yet still we fight.
It also houses the grave of Singapore's first president.
I got there by public transport, but it is much easier by car or taxi.
Go on Remembrance Sunday, where Singapore pays its respects to those that gave up their loves. Very moving."
,,A humbling experience,5.0,,After visiting the Battlebox and getting the background of the fall of Singapore this is a place you have to come to in order to get an understanding of the monumental sacrifice paid by the allies and commonwealth forces during the Second World War. As with all the Commonwealth War Grave Cemeteries throughout the world this one is kept to the same high standard. If you are travelling to Singapore it is worth your while to take some time out and pay your respects to the fallen of this campaign.
,,Somber,5.0,,This cemetery is well maintained and absolutely spotless...we learn about the attacks on Singapore and the many casualties from the war heaps of names and some so young
,,Moving,4.0,,Visiting the war memorial was part of our tour & certainly the highlight. A peaceful memorial created to pay tribute to the many fallen heroes. A moving story from our guide.
,,Beautiful Location,5.0,,"We paid our respects to the memory of those who lost their lives in WWII at the hands of the Japanese. It is a beautiful location, nestling on the side of a hill, wonderfully maintained and the 4,500 who lay here can rest in peace. There is a memorial to the 24,000 missing who have no known grave. It is not an easy place to get to, I would advise you to get a taxi, from the centre of Singapore and for two hours only, it would set you back only $100. You need the taxi to wait for you, because you most certainly will not find one there!"
,,Very moving,5.0,,If you want to pay your respects to those who died in the war this is one of the places to go. I found it really sad that there were over 800 headstones for unknown soldiers. It would take a very long time to walk round all the headstones. It's a beautiful memorial though.
,,"A beautiful, serene, Commonwealth Cemetery",5.0,,"Well laid out, signed, and numbered...as all CWGC. cemeteries. Called to find a friend's father, no grave, just a name engraved on a tablet...found it easily. A beautiful place, in perfect condition, and a sobering experience, as are the other CWGC cemeteries we've visited."
,,Remember the sacrifice,4.0,,A solemn place to remember the lives that were sacrificed in defending Singapore. The monument is dedicated to soldiers who lost their lives in the 2 world wars in and near Singapore. Interesting to find a huge number of Indian soldiers buried there. The involvement of the Indian Army in the world war is usually forgotten by most people. Place is fairly difficult to find. Enter the narrow road right next to the signboard. It's a long road but eventually leads to the memorial. Do remember to check out the info plaques on the sides. Very easy to miss but has interesting info on the Japanese attack.
,,Staff know their history. A sobering account of the War in Singapore and Asia.,5.0,,"I have been here many times for work and holiday and I must say it is a place to reflect and think about what happened on the battlefront here in Singapore.

Its nice to see a memorial to those who lost their lives in a country far from home. Brits , Aussies , Indians ,Singaporeans ,all lost their lives here."
,,Very Poignant,5.0,,We travelled by MRT out to Kranji station and this was followed by a 20 minute walk to the Memorial itself. It was very easy to find our way there and back to the station and we had a walk round the immaculately kept Memorials. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission do a brilliant job in keeping this area pristine.
,,Another must for history students,4.0,,This is well worth a visit if your interested in the history of Singapore and the decline of the British Empire. Those that survived and are not buried here suffered the long march and eventually the torturous work on the Burma railway. I found it deeply moving
,,With Military Connections Felt Compelled to see this,4.0,,It was a very impressive sight so well kept and very serene. It was amzing how many graves that were there. I felt sad when you read the gravestones and saw how many gave their lives at such a young age. Thank you for that!!!
,,War historians' 'must',5.0,,"Not sure this is so easy to get to by public transportation but definitely worth the effort to borrow or hire a car and visit, and just pay for the taxi to wait for you a half hour while you're there. Very beautiful and thoughtfully laid out historical site with signages so you are get a good introduction to the invasion of Singapore at the site. We've been four times with guests and each time have really felt it was worth the effort."
,,Poignant Experience. Must visit for history/war buffs,5.0,,"This place offers a poignant yet beautiful commemoration to the war dead. Very serene and contemplative atmosphere. To better experience the nature of the memorial, my advice is to read a little on some of the heroes of the war here in Singapore and the stories connected with them. Please note that is NOT a good place during wet weather. Distance is also a consideration if you do not drive or are not on a tour coach. But as I said, it is a good stop for education and reflection. You may want to have a mosquito patch on you just in case."
,,Immaculate,5.0,,"I went to find my grandad's grave and didn't expect what I found when I got there. You wouldn't have any idea it was so old, it is so well kept, it could have been built last year. Fantastic tribute to the sad losses in the war, but I wouldn't say it was a tourist destination unless a relative was there."
,,Very moving,5.0,,"We went here as part of a tour group. I was particularly interested to visit here to view my uncle's tombstone. And it was well worth the visit. The memorial is really well laid out and beautifully maintained. It's quiet and respectful.
They provide a book where I could look up my uncle's tombstone and could find it easily.
Well worth a visit."
,,A Place to reflect,5.0,,This Trip to Singapore I made the effort to visit the Memorial My first impression was the number of graves there were there and how well cared for the plots and gardens to me it was a emotional visit as a Aussie
,,Incredible.,5.0,,We went on a half day tour which included other places so only had about 45 minutes here. They have so much interesting stuff you could spend a day there. We would love to go back with more time to go through slowly.
,,Paying Respect,5.0,,This was a beautifully kept war cemetery - we did not realise how big it was and there were a lot of graves from India and Australia as well as British.
,,Take the time to thank those who went before us,5.0,,So proud at how well they keep this memorial. It was a wonderful place to say thank you and think how lucky we are
,,A Good place to visit,4.0,,I've been to Singapore many times but I never visited this place. So this time I take a tour to visit this place. It's quite a good place to visit as well as see a good view of Johor Bahru from this place. The only thing I don't like is I have to walk on Singapore heat while sightseeing in this place.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Immaculately kept, which is fitting for such a memorial. Stunning hill top views back to the city. $20 in a taxi back and forth to the city far easier than navigating the m r t system unless you have plenty of time on your hands. We were lucky and picked up a taxi on the way back that was dropping someone else off. If your unlucky it's a 1km walk back to the m r t station where there is a taxi rank."
,,Beautiful Memorial,5.0,,"Visited on 12th November (unfortunately couldn't make it on the 11th or the Sunday). As luck would have it, a band was playing in preparation for the Sunday memorial service which added to the atmosphere.

The cemetery itself is beautifully maintained as is the case with every CWGC location that I have visited. It is always moving to see the people from all over the world who lost their lives in any location, many of them far, far from home.

It's 1.1km from the MRT, so I headed out fairly early to avoid the midday sun. You can take a bus two stops from the Kranji MRT, but you'd still have to walk about half the distance up the driveway, so if that's an issue, a taxi may be a better option."
,,A visit to Kranji War Memorial,5.0,,"Spent a most moving, if very hot afternoon, visiting this very peaceful war graves cemetery for the allied soldiers killed during the Japanese occupation of Singapore. It is quite a distance from the centre of the city but worth the time it takes to get there. The easiest way is by taxi which is not too expensive. A tip however, if you go ask the taxi to wait for you or make sure you have numbers to ring for a taxi to get you back to your hotel. Otherwise you might have a long wait ! As with all cemeteries maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commmission, the grounds and graves themselves were immaculately kept and it was a very peaceful place"
,,A fitting resting place to many Heroes,5.0,,"Whilst not the biggest Memorial Kranji is beautifully maintained and is a peaceful resting place for over 4,000 soldiers from WW, sadly many unmarked graves for the 800 or so unidentified men. A Singapore Memorial tributes the 24,000 Asians who lost their lives. As we visited on Remembrance Day it was touching to see the wreaths laid from many Dignitaries around the world.
The MRT ride to Kranji passes through much of the suburban areas of Singapore and takes about 45min, it is a busy line but still worth it. Turn left from the MRT heading to the Race/karting track, cross the main intersection and turn left up what looks like a laneway, there is no signage from the MRT, the 67 bus goes past too but is only 2 stops."
,,Moving experience - a must to see,5.0,,I think we all need to be reminded of what humans are capable of and this is a visual showing this. The site is extremely well kept and looked after.
,,Moving and respectful.,5.0,,I found this museum to be deeply moving and above all it was a respectful memorial to the previous occupants of Changi Prison. Full of history and the experiences of those who lived through this period in the history of Singapore.
,,A moving tribute to all those how gave up their lives,4.0,,"We took the MRT to Kranji then about a 20 minute walk to the memorial. Like other WW2 memorials and cemeteries (we have visited many in Belgium and France) the cemetery is immaculately maintained. It is an excellent tribute to all those who gave up their lives. To give more meaning to our visit, we took a name at random out of the headstone register then looked for the name on the memorial and his headstone. This gave more meaning to our visit and personalised it a little. It helps you realise just how many people gave up their lives. We feel a place of the internet gives wider and deserved recognition to our chosen (unknown to us) person who sacrificed his life. Hence our photo of the headstone of Lieutenant P. S. Turner of the Malaya Police below. He died age 24. May he Rest In Peace"
,,Must see if you are into WW2 history,5.0,,"I went to the Kranji War Cemetery a few years ago. Its way off the beaten tourist track and took 1.5 hours by train & bus. Once there, I did not regret my commute. The place is very peaceful, as cemeteries typically are. There are broadly 2 sections. In the foreground are graves of British, Australian & New Zealand soldiers. Around the memorial itself these tall walls inscribed with hundreds of names of Indian soldiers who died during the Battle of Singapore and during the Japanese occupation. As an India (& a supposedly well read one), I had no idea of the extent of sacrifice by Indian soldiers - fighting under British officers in a foreign land.
Needless to say, the experience is sobering.
Certainly not recommended for anyone who does not have a working knowledge of WW2 in Asia or for a casual visitor"
,,A Moving and Emotional Place!,5.0,,"Beautifully kept grounds, gravestones and memorial wall to mark the fallen. Easily accessible by bus or train - although the train is a longer walk up the hill. Visiting here is very moving but is even more moving and emotional if you've toured the Changi Museum and Fort Canning Battlebox beforehand.

You can visit independently or take a guided tour - the Original Singapore Walks company do a guided tour of Fort Canning and the War Memorial together which gives you the historical and personal insight to make your visit unforgettable."
,,Lovely memorial and cemetery,5.0,,"Very beautiful and tidy site, best to get there by bus for the shortest walk. Bring lots of water and a parasol if the sun is out. ANZAC poppies available by donation box if you are visiting for a specific ANZAC name/grave and want to pay a small tribute. Overall a very peaceful and sobering way to spend a morning in Singapore."
,,A Time to reflect and honour the fallen.,5.0,,"I visited Kanji with my son who has been studying WWII and the fall of Singapore at School, it is a very moving experience and well worth a visit to reflect and remember all those young men and women who died defending our way of life. What is so fascinating about Kanji is the truly multicultural element of the cemetery, death knows no race or religion and war truly is a horrible thing. My son and I read many of the poems written by family members of soldiers buried, which moved us both and is an experience I will never forget. The memorial itself if beautiful and is a real testament to the fallen, reflecting both the 5000 graves at the site and the 24000 missing in a respectful and honourable way."
,,Historical memorial,3.0,,"Slightly out of the way, next to the kranji turf club. Extremely well manicured lawn and dignified setting for the war dead. Some read up on the history of this memorial will make visit more interesting. Would advise either early morning or evening for a visit."
,,A Fitting Tribute to the Fallen Soldiers,3.0,,This review is quite late. The Kranji War Memorial is a fitting tribute to the fallen soldiers of World War II. We passed by this site on the way to Johor Bahru in Malaysia.
,,Very moving,5.0,,Very moving. A humbling experience. So many lives lost in war. Beautifully kept. Worth visiting to reflect.
,,reality hits,4.0,,"As the daughter of a POW interned in Changi Prison I found this a very moving place, it brought tears to my eyes."
,,Amazing view of 3 countries in one landscape!,5.0,,"A place where WWII soldiers were buried, some had no names. They died with pride and dignity. Each tombstones have a story to tell. Would be best if there's a record of all the stories."
,,Sacrifice,5.0,,"A visit Kranji is at once uplifting and shocking at the level of sacrifice, not just during the War but also the aftermath of the Malay Emergency.
Strikingly beautiful this cemetery is a credit to the people of Singapore and those whose memories are enshrined there."
,,Moving experience!,4.0,,"We took the MRT to Kranji then walked up the hill to the Cemetery approx 15 mins walk. Everything was immaculate and we paid our respects to our fellow countrymen.
We then tried calling a taxi to no avail as the heat and humidity was immense. We waited for over half an hour when more tourists turned up and a kind Singaporean man also tried calling a taxi to no avail. After over and hour of waiting, he gave us a lift back to Kranji station for which we were grateful.
We are mid sixties so just keep this in mind if you decide to cab it back!
Kranji War Cemetery was well worth visiting."
,,Very moving.,5.0,,"A lovely cemetary kept in excellant condition,there is also a annex area for non war deaths very moving."
,,If you like war memorials,4.0,,"Beautifully kept grounds in a beautiful setting.
Worth it if you are interested in war history.
Take the MRT to Kranji stn. Come out and turn left. Go past the turf club on your left.
For a quick route turn left at turf club ave, and walk up until you get to a ticket office, and cross the road here and you will see a grassy area go thro and you will be at the entrance."
,,Kranji War Memorial,5.0,,"I went on a full day tour with City Discovery.com called the Singapore Round Island Tour with Changi Museum and Haw Par Villa yesterday.
The highlights of this tour, for me were the Kranji war memorial; the Buddhist Temples and Changi museum and chapel. The bus trip itself was very informative thanks to the wonderful and knowledgable guide Foo. I learned a lot about the Japanese invasion of Singapore and aftermath. At Kranji it was confronting to see the rows of headstones and long lists of names of the men and "" boys"" , mainly 19 to 25 years old , from many nations ( Malay/ Indian / Australian/ British and New Zealanders amongst them) who died in defence of Singapore. It is a beautiful and pristinely kept memorial and rightly so."
,,scary,3.0,,very dirty . it is quite spooky and scare us away. we would not like to come here because it reminds us of our world war 2
,,Peaceful,5.0,,Got the mtr to kranji it's just a 10 min walk up road or two bus stops up . What a erie place never felt like this before seeing the graves of young men and woman . Well worth the visit . One tip go early in morning not so hot
,,A historical monument on the way,4.0,,This monument is about the struggle of Singaporeans in 1965. You can get to see this during the city orientation tour.
,,"memorial to 240,000 who were lost",5.0,,"so well kept, and so sad to see the numbers that died. Worth visiting - there is a memorial book listing all the names and where they can be found on the memorial columns. Many don't have graves, and the names are engraved in columns, with more detail in the book."
,,Amoving reminder of the futility of war,5.0,,"We had to visit this memorial as our cousins death was the only place his death was recorded. He died whilst a prisoner of the Japs and no one knows where and how he died, one of the millions of victims of WW11."
,,Remembrance,5.0,,"Remember the soldiers, or even the heroes who fought for our freedom and independence. You will not be forgotten."
,,Great experience,5.0,,Tells you a lot about what happens. Great experience. Free to go. Recommend to everyone. We left something there for a loved one who died. Very moving.
,,Sombre sobre reminder,5.0,,"Never again! Never again! Someone famous once said. This will be a visit that wrings the heart as paintings, photographs and artefacts from WW2 POWs bring to life their trials and tribulations in Japanese internment camps displayed on the very site where they were imprisoned and tortured. Team this visit by going to the Changi War Memorial as well as Bukit Chandu, Fort Siloso in Sentosa and The Battlebox at Fort Canning together with the Ford Factory for a complete immersion into Singapore 's wartime history."
,,A Magnificent Memorial,5.0,,"This incredibly peaceful and beautiful spot is a must see for anyone who knows there history, or wishes to pay respects. Easy to get to. MRT to Kranji, 10 min walk. No facilities so bring water."
,,Wonderful Memorial,5.0,,"This is a wonderful memorial honouring the sacrifices made by these men and women. The grounds create a great environment for reflection. The war Memorial is easily accessed by MRT, it is a short walk from the nearest station. It can also be easily reached by bus. There is a large car park if you wish to drive. A must visit location if you are in Singapore."
,,Lest we forget,5.0,,"Kranji War memorial is a poignant reminder of the members of the Armed Forces of many different nationalities,who gave up their lives,so that we can enjoy the freedom we have today.As a redident of Singapore,I make a point of attending Remembrance Sunday and the Anzac Day memorials at Kranji. It is wonderful to see all the different religious leaders, Catholic,Protestant,Muslim,Jew,Hindu,Bhuddist etc etc,all gathered together and offering their various prayers for the repose of the souls of the War Dead.Why can't we all get on like that and appreciate each others religions without creating conflict? A lot of local schools are also encouraged to turn up,in order to make them aware of the sacrifices that others,not much older than them,only 2/3 ago,gave up! Kranji is beautifully laid out and maintained. I have been there by myself and if yiou wander amongst the graves,you can see boys of 18 years of age,who made the ultimate sacrifice and the odd note from a relative or friend,who may have visited from overseas,which will surely bring a tear to your eye!"
,,Well maintained.,4.0,,"Wandered around as apart of our round island tour, well maintained grave site. Also has views of Singapore that you might not get anywhere else. Our kids (and us) were most affected by the unknown graves."
,,respect to the freedom,3.0,,"It is a green and neat cemetery at the top of a medium hill. It would be a good place for visitors interested in history and also for everyone who needs silence and quietness!
When I was there, I felt depressed because of many persons who lost their life for standing in front of atrocities and imperialism!
It is a good place for thinking and being far from the world and its fanfare.
This cemetery has simple architecture but very effective! In my opinion, the graves` design were very meaningful. All of the graves were in a same shape and there was no difference between the nationality, religion and military rank!
It is notable you can find this site clean, modern and under attention after almost 70 years.
In my idea, we should visit such this place for honor and respect to dedication and sacrificing."
,,Simply beautiful,5.0,,It's a bit of a hike to get to from the station but is well worth the visit so beautiful.. Beautifully maintained gardens in front of their graves. They over look a stunning view..
,,More for foreign visitors than locals but still part of the local history,4.0,,We visited the war memorial a few times. Well kept and quiet. Great for photography. We rarely run into any visitors. The War Memorial is mainly for the allies soldiers died during the WWII in Singapore. That part of the history is not often on the mind of the modern day people as peace has been in place for 70+ years. Maybe it is time for us to revisit this holy ground and be more alert about the potential conflicts around us ...
,,Return visit,5.0,,"Was last here as a 5 year old so it was a return visit, during a memories tour with our fabulous guide Anna Ong. Could't replicate a childhood photo due to renovations but still a peaceful place, worth visiting to appreciate the amount of graves and names. An important part of the history lesson. a beautiful memorial"
,,Moving WW2 Memorial,4.0,,"This memorial is in the middle of a large park that is difficult to get to. However, the design of the memorial is good and allows for contemplation. The 4 structures symbolize the 4 ethnic groups in Singapore who were occupied by the Japanese. It will take 10-15 minutes to see it."
,,Incredible Human Sacrifice,4.0,,"Found it difficult to get there but eventually resorted to a taxi but S $20 for a 30 min drive is very cheap. Unbelievable the number of lives lost and even more incredible was the number of unknown soldiers which I guess the families would have been informed their fate was ""MIA believed killed"""
,,day time activity,4.0,,"good as a day time activity for an hour or two, a few interesting things and is just like any other war memorial"
,,KRANJI WAR CEMETERY A PART OF THE HISTORY OF SINGAPORE,5.0,,The Kranji War Cemetery is north of Singapore City and can reached by MRT and bus or by a 45 min taxi ride. It is a strangely quite place that sits on a hill over looking the straits of Johore. This is an immaculate and prefect monument to all those brave women and men who fought on our behalf in two world wars and post war conflicts. A must see.
,,Slice of history...,5.0,,Good place to visit... very well maintained... good to photograph the place... not d usual crowded place.. calm n serene.. but it's quite far.. MRT easy n cheap way to go.
,,We will remember them,5.0,,"Went on a Tour East Tour but you could get there by train, bus etc. Beautifully kept cemetery and very peaceful location. There is a book in a small alcove to find the location of someone's grave. Reminded me of my grandad's wargrave in France. Particularly moved by the many graves devoted to those who were unknown but ""KNOWN TO GOD""."
,,"""POP"" there",4.0,,"Will not have the chance to visit this place if not for the fact that we ended out 24km road ""run"" here."
,,Very serene place,4.0,,"Commonwealth War Grave Cemeteries are always well kept memorials, good places for reflection on the madness of war, the atrocities committed by the aggressors and the loss of so many mostly young lives. This cemetery lies a bit outside, but is still worthwhile a visit, traversing an outlying part of the city."
,,A peaceful sanctuary to ponder about life and to learn Singapore's history,4.0,,"The grounds of the cemetery is well-maintained and neat. Few visitors but that is what makes this place so peaceful to hang around, away from the crowds found on the rest of the island. It is both sad and encouraging to learn about the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for freedom."
,,Memorable,5.0,,"Beautifully maintained. Don't ask locals where to go because they get confused between war memorial and Changi museum. Kilometres apart, wrong direction but worth a visit."
,,Historic,5.0,,Learn the history of the war and it's affects even for today. Be reminded of where Singapore was and is today
,,Peaceful and sad,4.0,,"It sits atop a hill overlooking Kranji and is maintained by the commonwealth war commission. It's peaceful on a weekday, and allows you to contemplate the war and all the young lives it took - all marked on the graves, or the walls."
,,Visiting Someone Special,5.0,,I was aksed by my aunt to find out where her boyfriend was buried - he was killed by the Japanese at the Alexandria Hospital. With a lot of help from the caretaker this was done ans respects paid. A very peaceful day spent in the pouring rain but also very sobering.
,,Sobering,5.0,,So many Australians buried in this well set out cemetery. Well worth the visit to cement the ultimate sacrifice that these men made for our country.
,,"Beautiful, yet sobering.",5.0,,"In the heart of modern, buzzing Singapore lies a sobering memorial to the darkest days in Singapore's history. Beautifully presented and preserved by the Commonwealth WarGraves Commission, Kanji War Memorial contains row after row of the graves of those British, Australian, NZ, Indian, Malay and Singaporeans who fell in her defence during the Second World War. With informative plaques, this is a beautiful spot for remembrance and reflection. The wWall of the Missing is especially moving. Can be visited by yourself, or with a guide."
,,Beautiful memorial,5.0,,A beautiful memorial to Commonwealth War dead. An appropriate place to remember the sobering history of Singapore.
,,A highlight of our visit.,4.0,,Immaculately kept and well worth the journey out to Kranji if you are keen to show your respect for the fallen. There was no one in attendance when we were there so do yourself a favour by investigating the history before arrival so that you can fully appreciate this serene location. Fortunately we had.
,,Beautiful - amazing views,5.0,,"beautiful monuments and views into the city. You could do this in ten minutes buts nice to spend some time here and pay your respects. There is a large enough car park and it’s easy enough to find, we were there by ourselves at midday on a weekday."
,,A place to remember the brave warriors,4.0,,"A quiet peaceful and solemn place. A place to understand/ reflect and remembered the brave warriors who sacrificed their lives, so peace and freedom can prevail. A place to understand Singapore history better. Note: No toilet facilities or air con available. Time needed is about 60mins. Advisable to travel via Taxi as place can be quite remote to some, it is walkable from nearest MRT station “Kranji Station” about 20mins walk."
,,wow,5.0,,"What a beautiful memorial to those who fought. Impressive and moving, emotional experience, didn't have much time but it was worth it."
,,Moving visit,5.0,,An excellent trip to the war memorial. The grounds are well maintained - a great resting place for so many brave souls.
,,Memorial to death,3.0,,"This was part of the well organised Viator ""Round the Island"" tour, who unfortunately could not also control the weather. To say it was raining cats and dogs halfway through the visit is an understatement of the greatest magnitude.
The steps leading up to the memorial is through a well tended cemetery that makes very sober reading of the gravestone memorials. The range of military units and more importantly the ages of the fallen make one realise the enormity of the sacrifices made by our ancestors.
The memorial is as many throughout the world similar, however the effort in in its making and the recording of the names brings home the futility of war. Reading the names and seeing your own makes one question, was that a relation. or just a coincidence? Perhaps it would be better to visit this area independently. There were some on the tour who had specifically come to pay their respects and this was very touching.
If this historical episode interests you, you would be better getting public transport/taxi so that the time spent would be at your desire and not artificially controlled. Remember that the cost varies according to taxi colour and in ascending order the cheapest is blue/yellow, then maroon and lastly grey, with limos the highest. The underground is very clean, signs in English and very cheap."
,,A sober reminder of the sad futility of war,5.0,,"We went to fill in an afternoon. The drive out was, for Singapore quite long, but well worth it. The memorial was most impressive, and to be able to access the register of graves at the entrance was an unexpected priviledge.

Walking through the manicured grounds and realising that each headstone represented a person whose life had been cut short was saddening.

I believe that all people should walk through this cemetery to face the the dead and acknowledge their loss."
,,A lovely remembrance ceremony,5.0,,"We went up to the Kranji War memorial at 6am for the WW2 remembrance service. it was a beautiful place to watch the sun rise, and it was amazing to see veterans from so many different nations gathering to honour their soldiers."
,,Honour them,5.0,,Final resting place of many fallen Commonwealth soldiers who gave their lives in the Second World War. Beautifully maintained and peaceful and so very quiet. A short walk from the Kranji MRT. Look for my great uncle Frank Curnow in the first row as you walk in and pass on my regards as I did myself yesterday.
,,Historical site in Singapore,5.0,,Here lies the unsung hero of Singapore the brave souls who stood for their country with determination to overcome their own fears for the benefit of all! We salute you !
,,Thought provoKing,4.0,,Big monument in the centre of town which shows the big sacrifice given by the people of Singapore. Very humbling.
,,A place to remember.,5.0,,The Kranji War Memorial is a place that once visited will never be forgotten. I visited the Memorial during my National Service. Least we forget those that made the ultimate sacrifice.
,,Emotional,5.0,,It's the peace and serenity that first hits you. There is an explained sense of sadness here but the light that shines through is the beauty and well maintained gardens and lawns. All of the soldiers are shown so much respect and for them to be remembered in such a caring way says so much for Singapore. Well worth the visit to pay your respect for those who died so we could have our freedom....Lest We Forget....
,,World war two history buffs,5.0,,"Singapore is always hot, so dress accordingly as its all outside in the sun. If you expect to take a taxi, you may find if very difficult to get another taxi back, so I would recommend organising transport there and back. For those with an interest in world war two, its a sobering walk back in time as you really that the solders are buried in units and on the days that they were killed. As a consequence you can easily get a feeling for the battles that were fought on a daily basis. It also hits home that many young men and women gave their lives defending Singapore against an invader and that taking time to walk around is the least that we all can do given the sacrifice they made.

Its a reality check as for me, any worries or stress that I had walking into the place was instantly forgotten and afterwards seemed to be rather petty given the history of what this place represents.

I highly recommend it, I found it a humbling place and moving reading the headstones of many who had fallen all those years ago."
,,A respectable sanctuary for those who fought in the World War 2,4.0,,A quiet place to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. It is a very well-mantained and dignified resting place for those who fought in the war. It was a humbling experience.
,,Historical place,3.0,,This is the resting place of the British soldiers whom fought for Singapore during the World War. Nothing much to do other than to pay your respects and to take in the scenery.
,,Very well kept and a good way to pay your respect,4.0,,It is gut wrenching to see the amount of graves that came from the war but important to see exactly what occurred back then and how other sacrificed everything to give us today the way it is. Beautiful maintained.
,,Part of Changi Tour,4.0,,"The history here is amazing, Worth a visit as part of overall tour on World War II history of Singapore fall etc."
,,A monument to honour the fallen,5.0,,"We caught the train to Kranji from the city, and walked to the Cemetery. It is well kept and always being maintained to perfection. We found records of a family member and where he lays. The records are clear and easily available, it is a peaceful setting and worth the visit."
,,Attended Dawn service at Kranji War Memorial on ANZAC day 2016,4.0,,"Excellent Service with great speeches from the dignitaries especially the Turkish Ambassador
to Singapore.Only negative side was that there was a group of New Zealanders who failed to
observe protocol by singing during parts of the ceremony and especially during the wreath laying
where they were louder than the pipers where we were standing.
Overall thanks to the Australian High Commission for a job well done ."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,A beautiful well cared for cemetary and place of reflection and rememberance. Another graphic reminder of the history of Singapore.
,,Relive the Horror of World War 2,5.0,,Kranji War Memorial gives both locals and tourists a detailed insight on how many have died because of the brainless and ruthless actions of the Japanese...71 years have passed but the pain still remains.
,,A tranquil oasis in a sea of humanity,5.0,,"I have visited Kranji many times, usually when I need a little peace and time to reflect. Of course, as a large cemetery it is intrinsically sombre and reading through the 25000 names of those who are buried and remembered there is always thought provoking. The site is beautifully maintained by the Commonwealth Grave Commission and you can easily spend a couple of hours taking in the sense of history. Kranji as an area has a lot of references to the Japanese occupation including one of the key landing points up on the coast and is worth the effort of getting there. The MRT North South Line has a station within half a mile and its easily walked although a bus does pass closer. Its a bit of a trek by Singapore standards but worth it and you can add in the Sungei Buloh wetlands which are 4 miles away to make a day of your visit to the North of the island where few tourists venture."
,,Touching,4.0,,"War memorials are never ""nice"" places to visit however it is good to see how people honour the dead that fought for our freedom."
,,A place for quiet reflection.,5.0,,"A quick train ride, then a short bus ride and a walk around the bend and up a small hill to Kranji. This is such a well kept and informative memorial cemetery in respect of those who dies as a result of the war in Singapore. Quietly efficient and friendly gardeners work tirelessly while visitors are free to walk around. The view from the top is quite spectacular. What a wonderful memorial."
,,Peaceful,5.0,,"I've visited many Commonwealth War Grave Cemeteries and Kranji is as beautifully kept and peaceful as the best of them. There's always a certain sense of calmnness as you step into the cemetery where the noise of the rest of the world falls away and it is always incredibly moving to see that many graves and remember a history that seems so long ago but actually isn't.
I traveled to the site via MRT and then walked, it was a good 15/20 minute walk from the station but definitely worth it.
A highly recommended visit for anyone with any interest in history."
,,Reflection,4.0,,"We visited Kranji as part of the Singapore Original Walks tour, although we had been there before. As usual the Commonwealth War Graves Commission do a wonderful job of maintaining cemetries around the world. We visited by bus, but you can get there by train although it is a fair walk from the station. You could get there by taxi."
,,Fitting tribute to the missing beautifully kept and peaceful,5.0,,As you would expect from a common wealth war cemetery Kranji is well kept and peaceful and is a fitting tribute to the thousands of missing servicemen who died as PoWs.
,,Heros and traitors,5.0,,"Many many brave men buried or commemorated here including seventeen of the Rimau commandos (see wiki). Also the alleged Japanese spy Patrick Stanley Vaughan Hernan.

You can get here on the transit which is short walk up the road. If you go you may want to have a look at the causeway which played such an important part in the battle for Singapore."
,,ANZAC dawn service In Singapore,4.0,,"I have been to Kranji ANZAC dawn service for the last few years, and it has always been a special place for remembrance and reflection, The crowd was down this year but the organises supplied food for the first time. Unfortunately they always run the service too late and as such the sun is always up before the end of the service. But the children from the schools are always there to support the server and the services are along as well, To all that were lost, Lest We Forget."
,,ANZAC Day service,5.0,,"A stunning location, watching the sunrise over Malaysia is welll worth the early morning start. Hard to believe the British army were so poor"
,,Hommage to the fallen ones,5.0,,"There is a bit of walk from the SMR station to the memorial but well worth it. Quiet, moving, this place is a must see. RIP fallen ones, may you find peace in heaven!"
,,A lovely war cemetry,4.0,,"This trip was unique. We visited several WW11 sites during this trip. The memorial is beautiful and the cemetery so nicely cared for. We found it relatively easy to find a relatives name on the memorial with record books available on site. This was a moving experience as we are the only family members to find this record of our missing cousin.
It was very sad to note the number of young Australian soldiers buried there."
,,"""Solemnity""",4.0,,Not all people would share the same sentiments as I have for this place. History is worth remembering. Place is so solemn and you can feel the worthiness and respect for the place.
,,Amazing and sombering experience,5.0,,We were in Singapore for ANZAC Day and as a ex serving member it was fantastic to be able to experience the service at Kranji. It is a remarkable place and the service was excellent. Be prepared for a bit of a walk up to the memorial on special occasions and the MRT line is another hike back down. We took a cab to the service and trained back. For anyone interested in military history this is a must visit place in Singapore - meticulously maintained and cared for.
,,Very Moving,5.0,,I did not visit Kranji on my last trip but I did the trip before and I was absolutely moved. I was on the tour which also incorporated Changi War Memorial and both were most moving. What these poor prisoners went through would be had to imagine.
,,A truly moving experience,5.0,,"I visited this cemetery / memorial in order to honour my Uncle who fell during the battle of Singapore in 1942. Seeing his name on a wall with 24000 others made a deep impression. I was unaccountably distressed. The cemetery is beautifully kept and a suitable tribute to so much loss of life. But it made me very sad; as Wilfred Owen remarked, it brought home 'the pity of war, the pity of war distilled'."
,,quiet area - time to reflect,5.0,,Out of the way but accessable by taxi You need time to wander around the well kept grounds and read the diverse names / origins and ages of the soldiers interred here
,,Interesting and informative,5.0,,"I recently met an ex FEPOW,who had been stationed on Singapore when the Japanese invaded during WW2. We have visited most of the other WW2 memorials and yet never found the time to visit Kranji.
The most difficult for us was finding a taxi driver who would take us, it takes approximately 20 minutes from Orchard Road.Luckily we came across Ken, he had never been before.
It was well worth the effort, beautifully maintained as most war graves are. Accompanied with maps and brief history of the events."
,,Remembrance Day ceremony,5.0,,"This was a very moving experience. The War Memorial is in a beautiful place, remote from the city but with beautiful views. We arrived at about 6am and saw the sun rise over the memorial. The service was lovely, and a reminder of how many different people were directly involved in the war. It's a bit out of the way, but worth a visit to see another side of Singapore."
,,Educational trip!,5.0,,"Been here couple of times with families and overseas friend, a serene place where you can learn about history of Singapore and see war heros honoured. There are description and dates of Japanese invasion into Singapore in WWII when you enter the gates on the left tablet before staircase up the memorial and on the right are the resting places of Yusuf Ishak & Benjamin Sheares, 1st & 2nd Presidents of Singapore. You can see the inscription of the war memorial as the centre after the tall unmissable column and names of war dead. Recommend to visit !"
,,"It brings it home, so many lost thier lives.",5.0,,"It brings it home to you seeing all the graves of the fallen.
They died for their countries and some died helping others.
We owe some much to these fallen and it brings a tear to your eyes seeing them, some are very young when they lost their lives fighting. Take a hat as if it is sunny it can be very hot on your head.

They are well kept and it is a really nice place to visit, not at all morbid."
,,Kranji Cemetery,5.0,,Beautifully maintained and very peaceful. Worth visiting to just stop and reflect. Humbled by the fact that I was the first from my family who had the opportunity to pay respects to a great-uncle.
,,School Trip,4.0,,Came here during my primary school. I remembered that it was quiet and clean but not many people around. I guess the purpose of it was to remind us of our history and the sacrifices made that lead to the success of Singapore today. A little creepy for my taste. Overall a cool visit.
,,Lovely and sober,5.0,,This monument to war dead is located not far from Raffles and other spots that are easy to walk to. It's a lovely monument and important reminder of losses Singapore has experienced over a long period.
,,Lest We Forget,5.0,,"What can one say...these places are all testament to the futility of war.

A wonderful site, very well maintained, that undoubtedly elicits strong emotions in all who visit...including us.

Somewhat off the beaten track but well worth the visit. It is a cemetery so dont expect amenities or tourist stalls!

At the going down of the sun, and in the morning, we will remember them.

Lest We Forget."
,,Very moving,5.0,,"A beautifully kept Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery and a 'must visit' for Australian's visiting Singapore.

Wear comfortable shoes and take a bottle of water as it takes a couple of hours to get right around the cemetery and read many of the headstones. It's a place where one can't help but try to digest the futility of war and the price so many paid for the freedom we so often take for granted.

I did a fair bit of research before going and made the effort to locate over 18 graves of Aussie diggers and 1 nurse and place poppies brought with me from Australia on them.

Lest we Forget"
,,Well maintained memorial,4.0,,Well maintained memorial and peaceful visit. We went on a sticky hot day and managed to find my husband's great uncle who fought in WW11. We had a bit of trouble locating it but the staff found it immediately. Pity there's no toilets there for the public as it is a long walk and out of the way so beware.
,,Contemplation and recollection in memory of WWII,5.0,,"this place gives us an insight of WWII in the pacific area... which we are not much taught about in Europe ! so this comes as a necessary collective memory exercise
the place is very well maintained, quiet and peaceful
you learn about all these young men from all over the region (some from other regions of the world!), and from all religions, who fought and died for their/our freedom
really worth the visit"
,,Beautiful memorial,5.0,,I took the day trip around the island that includes this memorial as part of the history of Singapore and the WWII experience. It was a sobering sight but the memorial is also beautifully and lovingly maintained
,,On tour,4.0,,"excellent memorial, well maintained and presented. off the beaten track a bit but work a visit if you have an interest in this kind of history."
,,Reflection,5.0,,"IF you are from a commonwealth nation , then this is a must to visit. Take a day trip around the island that includes this memorial as it helps to understand the magnitude of the war effort,"
,,A tranquil space that is worth the visit...,4.0,,"Nestled within the suburbs of the north western part of Singapore, the Kranji War Memorial is not only dedicated to the allied forces who have fought so ever bravely for the freedom of all men. It is also the final resting place for the former presidents of Singapore namely Yusof bin Ishak and Benjamin Henry Sheares.

Take a stroll through the tablets of remembrance and appreciate the acts of bravery of all fine men who have perished in the unfortunate event of war."
,,Well Maintained,5.0,,The memorial is built in memory of those soldiers who lost their lives in World War. It is very well maintained. Not much visitors visit here though. Worth a visit as it is within a km from the nearest metro station.
,,Very sombre place to visit but well worth the trip,5.0,,"I found this memorial very sad to visit, mainly because of the number of lives lost at Singapore both military and civilian. Can not help to wonder if the world has learnt anything but past mistakes. Lovely peaceful place to visit."
,,Peaceful and beautifully maintained for our heroes,5.0,,"Very moving, the memorial park is a part of our history, and showed how much the Aussies did their share to keep the world at peace. The monuments of the unknown fallen have all special messages on their tomb stones. A wonderful place to go about quietly and show your respect."
,,A fitting Memorial,5.0,,"We went to Kranji to find the headstone of my Uncle. We could not find his name in the main books so we looked for help. A worker showed us where there was another book near the front gate. We found his name but still could not find him. A man working came to us and asked if he could help. He did, he went to a lot of trouble rechecking the book and finding the headstone. The Singapore people keep Kranji so beautifully, its very well keep, and respectful. When we were there it was very hot, but there was a team cleaning the headstones and gardening. Its a very fitting Memorial. It was very easy to get too by MRT and short walk. Very worth going to."
,,A serene place where the dead rested,4.0,,"This cemetery is for all religion. There's a cross of sacrifice, a cemetery run by the commonwealth. A very peaceful and quiet place where you can hear the birds sing. If you observe the tombstones (4000+ tombstones) closely, it gives you a lot of information, for eg, which unit the soldiers were from, birthday, age, religions. 24,000 bodies were not found and their names were inscribed onto the wall. This is a place where we are being reminded of the war and the soldiers from the commonwealth countries to restore peace to the country."
,,Peaceful memorial,5.0,,Beautifully maintained memorial to people who died in both World Wars. Very well donne information boards. Lovely flowers between each headstone. Easy to reach by SMRT.
,,Peaceful place for the heroes,3.0,,Well organized and in good care memorial for the heroes. The memorial park is small compare to other countries but worth to visit to pay respect if you have extra time.
,,Sobering Sight,5.0,,"Located in Kranji far from the touristy areas, this is a sobering site. A worthy memorial, especially to those who fought during WWII. There is no fee for entry and parking is free. This site can also be reached via metro (Kranji metro station). Not the best sight for small kids. Best to visit in the morning or early evening as it can get hot if there's no cloud cover.

It's a peaceful spot where many fallen soldiers have been laid to rest, yet face the north as if still guarding the approaches to Singapore. There are listing books kept in a small open vault in the center of the memorial if wanting to check for a name.

The site is well-kept and an important reminder of what took place here. Came here on the Singapore Walks Battle of Singapore tour. This was the final stop and the right way to end the tour.

Note; There are no facilities on site (e.g. bathrooms, vendors, etc.), so come prepared."
,,Solemn and noble memorial,5.0,,"I visited the memorial on 29 March 2015 to lay a wreath to my cousin, John Sachs, who was beheaded by the Japanese precisely 70 years earlier. I was deeply moved, but most impressed by the elegance and serenity of the site"
,,A must see for ex-pats and very moving memorial.,5.0,,"Only a short walk from the Kranji MRT station, this war memorial is a must see for all interested in the 2nd World War and Singapore's history. The memorial itself is well kept and the manicured lawns give a solemness and tranquility to the area. The cemetery can't help but give a shiver to the spine walking amongst the grave stones seeing the names and ages of the young men and women who died for their native country's."
,,Peace and remembrance.,5.0,,Anyone with a sense of British 20th Century history will probably want to visit here. Beautifully kept by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission this a place for quiet contemplation. So many of the graves are those of young men in their early twenties. Not easy to access by public transport so we took a taxi from our hotel and arranged for the driver to wait for us. The meter was running of course but the round trip from down town Singapore was $35.
,,What an amazing place,5.0,,"I came here as I dont think I could visit Singapore and not come here! I was at the cemetary for 2 hours and was the only person there the whole time. The place is imaculate and well looked after, the sheer scale of the place is daunting and the amount of graves sad to see, as Singapore was a base post WW2, there are the graves of the families of servicemen as well. Very sad place to visit but everyone ex military of mot should try to visit. Easy to get too as well, Metro and then a 10 minute walk."
,,A suitable spot for our fallen heroes,4.0,,"With a vantage point looking towards the Singapore that they were here to protect they lie in peace. Whether you're visiting a relative or just want to pay your respects the memorial to the 24,000 names who have no known grave is particularly poignant. As always the CWGC keep the site in wonderful condition."
,,a personal visit for my uncle,5.0,,"in 1944 my u8nbcle was shot down in his wellington bomber and is, together with others from his crew commemorated at the cemetery. I wanted to go an lay a wreath out of respect and see the cemetery.

The war graves commission, Royal British Legion and Kranji were amazing and I was able to spend as much time to peacefully reflect. The grounds are quiet and clean and this is surprising as the race course is close by and separated by a dual carriage way.

The memorial with all the names on, saddens one at the futility but sometime necessity of war.

I was able to lay a wreath in memory and respect to and of my uncle, take tasteful pictures of the memorial and grounds and felt I had finally paid my and my families respects to my uncle.

This is a place of peace and reflection together with sadness at the loss of life with the memorial celebrating the many countries and the lives of those who gave and made the ultimate sacrifice so I am free to write this review."
,,Kranji War Memorial,5.0,,"A visit to this memorable monument has been a ""bucket list"" item to me. This is a memorial dedicated to those brave souls who gave their lives to provide us with the lifestyle we now enjoy. May you Rest in Peace"
,,kranji war memorial,5.0,,"Another site of symbolising rich history is Kranji war memorial located right across the MRT station... This represents the three branches of the military - the Air Force, Army and Navy. This is dedicated to the people who have sacrificed their selves while defending Singapore and Malaysia against the invading Japanese forces during World War II."
,,Beautiful and peaceful place,5.0,,War cemetery's always seem to have an atmosphere and this one is no different. It is always a privilege to visit and pay your respects to the people who gave their lives for our freedom and this cemetery is well worth a visit. The memorial is impressive and informative.
,,A beautifully maintained memorial to all those lives lost in WWII,4.0,,"This place was beautifully maintained by local workers and the CWGC. It was so peaceful to walk around, but so sad to see the ages of some of these heroes and heroines, but sad that anyone had to endure such a terrible time in WWII. I visited the memorial of an ancestor who was an RAF pilot and was shot down at the age of 19 in 1941. It's hard to think about all the lives that were lost and the horrors they went through when Kranji was a prison camp after the invasion of Japan in 1942. ""Lest We Forget"""
,,A touching visit,5.0,,"We visited Kranji to honour my uncle, Lt Henry Frederick Green, aged 22, who died on active service in Malaya on 11th February, 1942, 3 days after Singapore was invaded.
Some tours include Kranji, but, if you have the time, more than a fleeting visit is required to really appreciate the significance of the site, which is accessible by a combination of MRT to Kranji station, then a bus for two stops or a walk of about 800 metres.
The cemetery, beautifully maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, is simple in design but each element is meaningful. Registers for both the headstones and the names on the walls at the top of the steps make it easy to locate specific people you may be seeking.
Sitting on the benches at the top, looking over the surrounding countryside, gives one a chance to reflect on the many young lives lost and the futility of war.
This often overlooked memorial is a must for anyone with a personal connection or an interest in military history."
,,Very peaceful,5.0,,A peaceful & fitting tribute to those who defended & fought during the fall of Singapore. Sadly no tribute to those who were lost at sea in Force Z on ships; The Prince of Wales & The Repulse.
,,Wonderful resting place,5.0,,"Worth the visit to see how the Country of Singapore have provided a resting place for the many Army, Navy and Air Force Personnel and Civilian's who died trying to protect Singapore during WW2. I arrived with my Guide just as a large group of Young Service Men finished a Parade in front of the memorial, It was, I was told, a regular thing for the Recruits to come to the memorial to remember, and to have lessons on why these people were involved. AMAZING! It should be done in the UK!"
,,Remembering those who have fallen,5.0,,This was my 2nd visit to pay respects to my Grandfather who was lost on the Suez Maru. The grounds are immaculate and are in keeping with other war grave commission cemeteries. Its a place that everyone should visit to remind us of what has been lost due to war. Read: Suez Maru Atrocity Denied - it has lots of relevance to this Memorial.
,,A somber and sobering reminder of Singapore's war,5.0,,"It's easy to forget that behind Singapore's modern facade there lays a grim history fromWorld War II. About 25 minutes outside the city is Kranji war cemetery where over 4000 allied service men and women are buried.
Many are from the terrible days leading to the fall of Singapore in 1942 but there are many hundreds from throughout the war.
As usual the commonwealth war graves commission keeps Kranji immaculate. It's hard to imagine those terrible times when you wander the manicured lawns and read the gravestones - and see the ages - some as young as 17 years.
I took my wife here to visit her cousin Raymond Hembrow killed 14 Feb 1942 aged 21 - she was the first family member to visit and it was a deeply moving experience .
It's easy to get to via the local rail (MRT) - tAke the redline to Kranji, come out of the station and turn left (about $5 return). The cemetery is about 800 metres up the road - an easy walk but taxis are also available. Take a hat and sun block and some water - there is nothing there but the cemetery and it can get hot.
If your visiting Singapore - take a couple of hours out of your day and visit Ray and his mates - you won't forget the experience."
,,Solemn Respect Dignified,3.0,,"As part of Singapore Total Defence campaign, I brought two young kids to Kranji War Memorial. It is hard for the kids to comprehend :

- War Memorial contains 4000 plus graves, but whole venue is so pristine and green
- Look closely at the inscriptions and you noticed many of the fallen are not Chinese, Malay, or Indian. Most are young, British, Australians or New Zealands. They have sacrificed themselves fighting for Singapore.
- I took the opportunity to introduce Singapore's 1st two presidents (Encik Yusof Ishak and Dr Benjamin Sheares)

I hope the trip will let kids appreciate pioneers' sacrifices, and not take Singapore's Peace and Prosperity for granted."
,,History Tour,4.0,,"An essential part of your WWII must see areas of Singapore, and those who sacrificed their life for our freedom today"
,,An eye opener to our past and fallen heroes,5.0,,WE went on an around the island tour which took in the War memorial and museum. Very humbling when you look at our fallen soilders and the age of them. some were the same age as my sons and as a mother it is disturbing. The view was amazing. The museum while you could not take photos told its own stories from the photo displays and items from the past. Very humbling.. lest we forget
,,"A fitting tribute, and solemn reminder.",5.0,,"This is a beautifully peaceful memorial for those from many nations who fought in the cause of liberty. It is set on a hillside, with uniform white headstones reminding one of Arlington National Cemetery. However, carefully tended plantings between graves enhance the beauty of this place, and large stone memorials help provide tribute to those here honored."
,,A must visit place,5.0,,"If you are military or not this is place of beauty, serenity and reflection. Take time read some of the names of the young men whose lives were taken from them."
,,Beautiful memorial,4.0,,A little out of the way but well worth the visit. Beautifully maintained memorial to the fallen of ww2.
,,Learn about the history of Singapore,5.0,,"War is a very real thing and the tombstones of our dearly departed soldiers who gave their lives for the free land that we enjoy today, is a stark reminder that freedom comes at a cost. A humbling visit as your hear the stories of courage and dedication these soldiers had towards the Nation"
,,Beautiful resting place,5.0,,It was a beautiful memorial ground. It is well worth a visit to pay your respects to our fallen soldiers.
,,Very unpleasant experience,2.0,,"The man working at the entrance was so angry and unpleasant that it made the experience very unpleasant. He barked at us to move, and was doing so to everyone in line to get in. I consider War Memorials to be sacred sites, and having an employee treat visitors in this manner is unacceptable. I hope this situation was just a one-off, and he was having a bad day. It took us a while to shake off the entrance, and come back to a serene place that would allow us to appreciate the site.
Having large crowds of people with cameras is a little disconcerting, but you can manage to get away to allow yourself some quiet reflection."
,,Great for history buffs,4.0,,"Changi was infamous with the Japanese treatment of POW's but this site is the cemetery and is more interesting for sure. Have an uncle there, died in Malaysia so assume it's headstone only? Look at how many Indians/Muslims died fighting for the British tells a tale."
,,"calm, clean place",5.0,,That its a very clean and well-maintained place is what strikes you first. truly befitting the soldiers who gave their lives protecting their land.
,,Total respect - Amazingly well maintained,5.0,,"Took the train from the city to Kranji. Left out of the station, across a big junction, then next left and you are there (a circa 1200m walk). A bus could take you to within 200m.
The grounds are immaculate, they could not be maintained better and the whole place is thought provoking and demands respect. We are very glad to have made this visit.
It was nice to see the new recruits/servicemen (only saw men) completing their initiation ceremony in the grounds."
,,"All Pervasive Soul of Sacrifice, Finality of Death, Tragedy of War",5.0,,"Kranji War Cemetry & Singapore Memorial is well connected by Bus from City Centre - the Bus Stop is barely 10mts walk from the Memorial Entrance. Exquisitely Maintained, the Green Expanse of Kranji War Memorial is home to 4500 Neatly laid out Graves. The Very Air we breathe at Kranji War Cemetry exudes Deep Respect for the Dead - General or Soldier lie next to each other, some as young as 20 yrs, some Nameless. The Singapore Memorial Honours 24000 Soldiers who Have No Final Resting Place.
Their Names are Inscribed on a series of parallel walls with Regiment & Rank. The Memorial Inspires admiration for the Brave Hearts of the Fallen Heroes. The Kranji War
Cemetry & Singapore Memorial is Ideally Located at Kranji with Serene Nature Surroundings as far as the Eye can see. This is a Lifetime Experience."
,,"Nice place to visit, but not easily accessible.",3.0,,"Great place for photography, history buffs and tourist who wish to learn a piece of Singapore. A very quiet place indeed."
,,A Slice Of History Nobody Visits,5.0,,"I had earlier visited the Singapore National Museum near the Orchard Road and thus got interested in Singapore's history and the contributions by the Indian soldiers in the battle for Singapore during the World War 2. My interest took me to the Kranji War Memorial. Surprisingly when I asked the taxi driver to take me there, he was quite surprised and told me that "" this slice of Singapore's history is not visited even by the Singaporeans."" However I was surprised to see the graves, tomb stones with the names of the killed and the beautiful memorial as also the landscaping undertaken by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, UK. I have seen the similar memorial in Kohima,India but this is much bigger, better maintained and landscaped. It has the names of over 4000 Indian soldiers among others who lost their lives during the invasion of Singapore by the Japanese. It is worth visiting if you are interested in history. The metro station is closeby. The memorial is situated close to the Malaysian border,"
,,Very respectful,5.0,,Not enough publicised about this memorial (taxi driver had not heard of it at the nearest station!) Well worth the hot walk from the station. Memorial excellently maintained and presented. Groundsman very kindly gave us a lift back to the city in is own car as not another person there
,,Historic military memorial,5.0,,"We stopped here on a tour, and it was a sobering thought to realize from the graves and etched names, how many lives were lost for freedom for this area. Quiet reflection and appreciation of young soldiers sacrifice. A beautiful well maintained memorial."
,,Paying Respect,5.0,,"It is a little out of the way but it can be reached by MRT or taxi which is not too expensive, our driver waited whilst we had a walk around. This is a place that all visitors to Singapore should visit at some time."
,,Military Memorial,5.0,,"You see and appreciate the work of the War Graves Commission for this memorial to those fell during WW2. It is peaceful to sit and reflect on all those who died and the many countries, races and religions who took part in the conflict. A must see for any ex military."
,,Round Island Tour,5.0,,Beautifully maintained. Very sobering. So many young lives lost forever. All politicians should visit prior to committing troops to any conflict. It might make them think twice.
,,Thought provoking,5.0,,Beautiful location and very well maintained. Stark reminder of the reality and waste of war. Fascinating insight into the melting pot of cultures and religions that fought on behalf of the Allies
,,Salute the Warriors,5.0,,A peaceful place. A place to reflect on life. A place to think about how brave these soldiers were. A place to think bout war and peace. A place on the west side where u can admire the clear sky.
,,WW2 Memorial,4.0,,Easy to reach via the MRT and a short walk from the station by the same name. It stands as a reminder of the loss of life and the contributiion by Singaporeans and Malays during WW2.
,,A time of rememberance,4.0,,This memorial is set in a beautiful location and is very well maintained. A very sobering reminder of the loss of many young and old men and women.
,,Very stark graveyard,2.0,,Visited here with an organised tour group and was not the only one who was rather astonished to discover that there is not even a tap available let alone any toilets or information booth. It was an extremely humid day which is nothing unusual in Singapore so did expect some basic facilities. The graves themselves are quite sad and several look neglected as clearly seen by the lack of plants nearby.
,,Quiet and historical,4.0,,The Kranji memorial is a 5-7 minutes walks from Kranji Mrt station in the north of the Island. Itvis beside the race course. Its a beautifull memorial to those that fought for singapore. It is a very quiet and well maintained place. Its worth a visit as well as to pay respect for those that have done the ultimate sacrifice for freedom.
,,Worth seeing,5.0,,Easy to get to - an hours quiet reflection - worth seeing - take the MTR and then it's a 500m walk by turning left out of the station
,,Kranji war memorial,5.0,,This is located on the northern part of singapore .it is in the memory of all the men and women who gave their life during the Second World War .
,,Pay your respect,4.0,,Beautiful place to visit and to pay respect to the heroes of the past. This place has nice scene for photo too.
,,Piece of history in stone,5.0,,"War memorials around the world tends to look the same, after all, they have same purpose, to honour the sacrifice and record history. Kranji War Memorial provides a very good historical record of the WWII in Singapore and Malaya. Walk around to read the names and ages of fallen."
,,Great for learning some history.,5.0,,"Book a tour. It is maybe $15 pp but so worth it. You need to contact them beforehand to arrange it. I learnt so much about what Singapore went through, who knew the link with Pearl Harbor?
It's not an uplifting place to visit but it is a great place to learn some of the history of Singapore"
,,A place to remember those who fought in WW2,5.0,,A place to think about and pay your respects to the thousands that died in the last great war. The cemetery is well kept
,,See the price they paid,5.0,,"We did the memorial as part of a much larger and wider history tour, which was superb. This is a place to stroll and pay respect to those that made the ultimate sacrifice. Lest we forget."
,,Memories of heroes,3.0,,The MRT takes you close to the memorial. The graves are well kept. It makes you think about the senselessness of war. So many brave men.
,,A Connection to a Tragic Past.,4.0,,"As with all Commonwealth War Memorials, Kranji is well-kept, serene, quiet and moving. It provides an insight into the sheer pointlessness of war and the brutal way many young people die. Kranji also contains many remains of civilians, some very young, caught up in an advancing war front. It's more interesting, of course, if you have a knowledge of any individuals or units caught up in this field of battle."
,,Moving and Beautiful,5.0,,"If you stay in the city of Singapore, you are missing out on some wonderful sites. This memorial, dedicated to those who died during WWII, is beautifully maintained and a tribute to all who served."
,,Very Moving.,5.0,,"This visit was part of a day tour but we always wanted to go there to pay our respects. It is beautifully kept with lovely gardens which are well tended. The fallen are buried together no matter what their rank, colour or creed and the memorial is wonderful the way the three forces are represented. Definitely recommend it. I think it may be difficult to get there by public transport but not impossible."
,,Moving experience,4.0,,"Set in a beautiful position overlooking the skyscrapers of the city.
So quiet where we were able to reflect and pay our respects to the many people who lost their lives during the Second World War. We travelled on the MRT to Kranji turning left from the station and walking about 15 minutes to a very busy junction just cross straight over and it's clearly signposted from there. Much cheaper than a taxi."
,,If you pick one day to go make it the closest Sunday to Nov. 11. 7:30 service,5.0,,"This quiet spot was well maintained. We went and saw the preparation for the Sunday service. At this time of day, there was a good rain shower. It was not well directed from the MRT station. Go past the horse racing and cart racing to the main road. Cross the road and make a left turn. Go up this sidewalk 200 meters to save many steps. Look for the top of the monument to tell you where to cut cross country. Great view of the city. I call it a must see. There are no guides and few markers .. Read up on it before you go."
,,Place where you see how much we gone through for the peace now,4.0,,A place where you see birds and different types of flowers. The peace here is good for you to reflect on how much these people had to fight and go through for what they believe in.
,,Remembrance service held here,5.0,,"Our WW2 veterans group (37), visited here in Oct 2015 with the National Far East POW Chaplain from the uk. We had a remembrance service and were joined by pupils from The Dulwich College in Singapore and staff from The Foreign and commonwealth office"
,,Kranji War Memorial and Cemetery,4.0,,"The Kranji War Memorial and cemetery is located near Kranji MRT at 9 Woodlands Road.

The cemetery contains the graves of men and women from Britain, Australia, Canada, Sri Lanka, India, Malaya, the Netherlands, Nepal and New Zealand who died in the line of duty during World War II.

The cemetery has more than 4,400 white gravestones lined up in rows. Some of these graves are of unknown soldiers. Most of the dead buried here died very young, mainly in their early twenties.

There is also a Chinese Memorial which marks a mass grave of sixty-nine Chinese servicemen killed by the Japanese when Singapore fell in February 1942.

At the top of the hill stands the Kranji War Memorial. The War Memorial symbolizes the three branches of the military - the Air Force, Army and Navy. The columns represent the Army, which marches in columns, the cover over the columns is shaped like the wings of a plane, representing the Air Force, and the upright pillar at the top looks like the sail of a submarine and represents the Navy.

The Memorial's walls are covered with the names of over 24,000 allied servicemen whose bodies were never found,

The cemetery is well-kept and peaceful, but is a testimony to the horrific and pointless loss of life during times of war."
,,A part of Singapore's war heritage.,3.0,,"It's hard to rate a war cemetary as an attraction, but if you share an interest in WW2 history, it may well be worth a visit. It's a bit of a trip out towards Woodlands to see it, and it isn't really clearly posted how to get there. Google maps can help. It was interesting, and well maintained, but is best as part of a larger itinerary."
,,So we Never Forget,4.0,,This is an exceptional well kept Memorial cemetery. It is easy to get to by public transport although it does involve train and bus from Center of Singapore. This a short walk up a slight rise from main road to entrance. Take an umbrella on a hot day as there is very little shade.
,,very hot,4.0,,Beautiful and quiet. but very hot. Take a drink as there is no rest room. A bit of a walk from the MRT and not very well signposted but worth the visit
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"This War Memorial, the lawns, gardens, and the Headstones of the Allies buried here are kept in pristine condition by the staff of this Commonwealth War Graves Commission. So sad there are so many headstones, many belonging to soldiers under the age of 20.
Pity that I was the only visitor for the morning!"
,,An interesting sculpture,3.0,,This is a moving reminder to the horrors of the past. The magic ends there as it's in the middle of a notorious traffic intersection and congested. The monument is however clean and well maintained.
,,"Easily reached on train, & very interesting",5.0,,"Good explanations are provided. Note there are no facilities (including toilets), so use toilets at station and bring your own water. We recommend a book we bought at the Battlebox, 'War Memory and the Making of Modern Singapore and Malaysia' - well worth reading to gain good understanding of local as well as Western perspective of WW2 and aftermath."
,,Sobering!!!,5.0,,"This is one of those places that you cant help but feel for those who fell during the war. The graves are laid out in neat well cared for rows. Each headstone gives a name, rank, regiment date of death and age. It is truly sobering walking round and reading the headstone's of those who gave their lives and some at a very young age. It makes you think!"
,,Very nicely kept a beautiful place,5.0,,No services at this memorial. Its near the Singapore Turf Club. Make sure you organize your travel to and from carefully as there is no public transport.
,,Look for your relatives,4.0,,"The memorial is set with beautiful gardens, all hand tended and graves are arranged in rows that are listed on the big honour boards in the pavillion half way up the slope. There is a book where you are able to look for relatives or people you may know of who served at this time."
,,Beautiful and Humbling,4.0,,A little way out of town sits this beautifully maintained cemetery and memorial which is the final resting place of many WWII combatants. A fitting and humbling tribute.
,,st get the MRT to Kranji and walk 10 minutes,5.0,,EASY to find go to KRANJI MRT station walk along woodlands road 10 mintues just past first traffic lights very easy to find ask locals if your not sure they are very helpful ..Heaps of very nice cake shopps nextdoor /in the MRT station 1/2 price from main city heaps of otehr food stalls have lunch here its well worth it very nice local food at the MRT station stalls .. The manger of the WAR Memorial is helpful and friendly was nice to meet him
,,Paying Homeage at the kranji war cemetery,5.0,,While visiting Singapore we took the opportunity to visit the cemetery to pay Homeage to mums dad who was a pow during the ww 11 and never returned home he was only 30 years of age When he died We were very impressed with how well the grounds are maintained We travelled by taxi which took 20 minutes from our hotel in the city You can go by train which is a 15 min walk from the station there are tours you can take which cover the museum and much more .
,,Beautifully kept memorial,5.0,,Very moving and humbling to see how many servicemen lost their lives here during the Pacific War. Beautifully maintained a real credit to Singapore. Do visit and remember them.
,,Very moving,5.0,,This cemetery where all the casualties of WWII are buried is extremely well maintained. If you are searching for a relative there is a register available providing the location of each grave. It is quite a long way from the city so best to take a round the island tour which also includes Changi museum.
,,Serene attraction,5.0,,"The only less positive comment I can make about this spot is that its about 30-40mins walk from the closest subway station. And the walk is a little tricky if using a map. If you have a good sense of direction, you should be good and a TIP... when on the subway heading towards the Kranji subway station, you can see the tall monument from a distance, which helped me in directing me to the right direction when walking. You can catch a bus there, which I would recommend looking into to avoid the long walk. Not sure of the details on that as I was on foot. POSITIVES: Beautiful landscape. Great to learn about the history of Singapore in such a peaceful place. You can leave a message in their visitors book. Stunning place for photos. If you are the type of traveler that enjoys such tourist attractions, I would put my thumbs up to make the trip here. Its a bit far off from everything else in Singapore, but worth it."
,,Never forget those who sacrificed everything for our freedom!,5.0,,"It's a very peaceful and orderly cemetery and memorial park. Walking past the gravestones and reading the names and ages of the soldiers, I am filled with awe and respect for these soldiers who fought bravely for a place that did not belong to. Tucked away off Woodlands Road, it serves as a true memory to the many who gave their lives for our freedom today - soldiers, civilians and the many unknown souls. May they rest in peace and may Singapore never have to suffer war on her shores for a long long time to come. Nobody wins."
,,war memorial,5.0,,"A must see, guide tours available, very informative. wander briefly on your own to really take in this place."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,If you have a spare afternoon and want to have a peaceful walk then this is a nice place to visit to collect your thoughts and pay some respect.
,,Peaceful historic site,3.0,,Peaceful and historic site. Well-maintained and clean. Good learning experience... Worth to drop by for a visit...
,,To Pay Respect & to Reflect,5.0,,"There is an MRT stop called Kranji. Although not far in distance, it is worth taking a bus outside the 2 stops to get to the site with the heat.I got there about 9am, and suggest either an early morning or late afternoon visit, as it is on a very exposed site.When you get off the bus, there is no signage, & the site is hidden by foliage, so just walk back the way the bus came for a few meters, and you will see the entrance. Before you even walk the steps to the graves, don't forget to check out the structures to your left, one a map for the strategic places, and the other,, one of the reasons I had made the pilgrimage after watching an episode of Australian Story, about the Rimau incident. The grassed area is well maintained and is easy to walk around (but it does get very hot). No toilet facilities, no water. A place you should visit and pay your respects to the young men and women of the Commonwealth who helped make SIngapore what it is today.If you are searching for a gravestone in particular you are able to open the ""cabinets"" that have books of registers inside."
,,Remember,3.0,,Can't miss this memorial & it gave us a moment to pause & remember. It can be seen from quite a distance but we walked round the whole area which put things in perspective rather than on the bus tour.
,,Moving beyond mere words,5.0,,From humble Indian Hospital Service water carrier - as portrayed by Rudyard Kipling - to high ranking officers and the young children of long gone service families this final resting place is moving beyond words.
,,Peaceful place to reflect,4.0,,Memorial place for the fallen heroes of world war 2. Young men and women who's sacrifice will never be forgotten. The lawn is beautifully kept. The nearest public transport is Kranji MRT station. About 10 to 15 minutes walk away.
,,Very moving experience,5.0,,"We visited this Memorial to honour the sacrifice made by the brave men. Who gave their lives so me, and future generations could live in relative freedom. The ages and the number of young men from all parts of the commonwealth. Reduced me to tears."
,,Peaceful and respectful memorial.,5.0,,A beautifully maintained memorial to fallen soldiers of many countries. The gardens are very well kept and neat and it was a lovely peaceful walk through the graves and reading the inscriptions.
,,A place to reflect,5.0,,A bit of a way out from singapore. No public transport i understand. Lovely grounds. Actually has a book that you can look through to see someone in particular etc. did as part of a tour that included the changi prison.
,,Historic WWII site worthy of a visit,4.0,,Worthy of a visit but a knowledge of WWII history beforehand would be useful as there is only one plaque tucked away next to the car park that explains the significance of the Japanese landing only 2 miles from here in 1942 and fighting Commonwealth troops including many from Australia in the swamps along the shoreline almost visible from the memorial on the hill. The setting on the side and top of a small hill is fitting for such an important war memorial. Easily accessible by train on the MRT line stopping at the Kranji station and walking westward for 10 minutes or so.
,,emotional solemn experience,5.0,,"Kranji War Memorial is located approx... 20 kilometres from the city centre, a hillside cemetery that is quite beautiful in its serenity once you get there. The memorial honours the men and women from Britain, Australia, Canada, Sri Lanka, India, Malaya, the Netherlands and New Zealand who died in the line of duty during World War II. There are more than 4,400 white gravestones lined up in rows on the cemetery’s gentle slope. At the hilltop terrace, there are four memorials, the largest is the Singapore Memorial, and this memorial bears the names of more than 24,346 Allied soldiers and airmen killed in Southeast Asia who have no known grave. Next to the Kranji War Memorial are the Kranji Military Cemetery, a non-world war site of more than 1,400 burials, as well as the Singapore State Cemetery, where the country’s first and second presidents, Encik Yusof Ishak and Dr Benjamin Henry Sheares, are buried. The Memorial is so well kept, and maintained, the grounds are lovely and it is so serene to walk around, its best to visit in the early morning, or late in the afternoon, it does get very hot during the day, the tranquillity of the ground is a good break of the traffic noise. It opens at 07:00am. Easy to reach if you wish to use public transport take the MRT (yellow line) and disembark at Kranji. Take Bus 160 2 Stops later alight at Woodlands Road, Kranji War Memorial. Or take taxi which is less than 5 minute ride. Well worth the visit."
,,Make peace with the fallen,4.0,,"See it in the early when the sun is about to rise, the tranquility of the ground is a good break of the traffic noise. It opens at 07:00am"
,,Tour,5.0,,Did this one on a tour it is very emotional even if you don't know anyone that was in that war Seeing all the cross and names on the wall of people that lost there life is hard to believe but well worth it
,,A must See,5.0,,"We visited for personal reasons, we got the MRT to Kranji and then got a taxi from the bus station, this was only a 5 minute drive, but the heat made us lazy, as normally we would of walked.
The Memorial is so well kept, and maintained, the grounds are lovely and it is so serene to walk around, as you walk through the entrance the graves memorial book is located in the left, and then you can walk up to the cenotaph and wander around the rest of the grounds, it was a sombre experience, and was very moving for us.
There is not much shade, and as we visited at the height of the midday sun, I would recommend to go either late or early on in the day.
The ground is not very accessible for wheelchair users, but I would recommend any body to visit as it it very moving.
We did not have a taxi back, and we walked back to the main road, where there is a bus stop just opposite on the other side of the road fro the entrance which will take you back to the MRT, in about 3 stop."
,,A very moving heartfelt place to visit.,5.0,,This a very moving place where many of the soldiers who fought in Singapore during the Japanese occupation. are laid to rest. A very sad and moving place.
,,Experience the Ambience of an Overseas War Memorial,5.0,,"This experience is well worth the effort to experience an overseas War Memorial that includes many Aussie Diggers. The setting is beautiful and it is interesting how each Nationality has its own area. There appeared to be little Public transport to this spot, but unlike Australia Taxi fares from Singapore CBD are quite reasonable."
,,Good History Exhibits,4.0,,Emotional. Interesting exhibits about prisoners and how they were treated by the Japanese during the war. I liked the artifacts and presentation.
,,"Must visit place to to feel , how Singapore relevant to WW II",5.0,,"Do you know about how Singapore relevant to WW II, some history I feel you should know about Asia , come here spend some time as it required some attention"
,,Just OK,3.0,,Just OK Place. not must visit. just go take a pic n leave. worth only 2-3 min stay. but skyline view is awesome from here
,,Very Moving Experience,5.0,,"Try to go in the morning while you are fresh so that you can fully appreciate the memorial surroundings. Read the names on the pillars, find the graves of the unknown soldiers, the Australian section and the tributes to British, New Zealand, Indian, Canadian and local soldiers. ""Their name liveth for evermore"". Very moving. Very moving."
,,very informative guide.,4.0,,I didn't realize our tour was taking us there. It was very sad to see that so many lives had been lost.
,,A Moving Experiance,4.0,,"Visited here as part of the Tour East ""Round Island Tour"". If you do not do the tour it is well worth making the effort to visit this site. It is so moving to walk among the headstones of many gallant soldiers from England, Australia, Singapore, India and other Nations. Very well maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Authority, however there are no toilet facilities at the site."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Very interesting and quite heart-breaking. Well worth the visit. We spent a couple of hours here (that's really all you need) and found it informative and well set out. If you are interested in some of the history of Singapore, this is a must-do on your itinerary."
,,Moving,5.0,,"Not the easiest place to find, I went past it in the bus 3 times before I finally found it. No one seemed to know where it was, even the locals.

It was worth the trouble finding the memorial. I have never been to a War Memorial Cemetery before and found it very moving.

Well worth the trouble to find."
,,A fitting memorial to the sacrifice of many,5.0,,We visited to pay our respects to a former member of my old Squadron. A very well tended Cemetery in a peaceful spot for quiet contemplation. Lovely views of the surrounding area.
,,Grave search,5.0,,"Visited the memorial to locate a Aussie serviceman grave site, unfortunately there was no grave but we did find him on the walls of names for those never found. Sad but rewarding, excellent site and well maintained, shows great respect for the fallen."
,,"A very peaceful, beautifully kept area for rememberance",5.0,,"My fiance and I visited Kranji war memorial on a Monday in January and we were the only visitors at the time. The war graves are beautifully simple and well kept by the gardeners who were present. The lawns are immaculate, you can hear traffic noise in the distance but it is so peaceful."
,,Take a moment to remember those who sacraficed,5.0,,"Very moving. A 10 to 15 min walk from Kranji MRT station, go left as you leave the station, at major intersection cross directly over remaining on the same side as the MRT station and you will then see large brown sign directing the way."
,,SOMBRE AND UNDERRATED,5.0,,Kranji War Memorial perhaps is not on everyone's list of places to visit when it comes to Singapore. It's a very poignant place to remind us of the Second World War. Very peaceful yet sombre. A place like this is very crucial to remind forward thinking Singaporeans of its past!
,,A truly worthy memorial to the war dead.,3.0,,"As a general attraction I am giving it only 3 stars, but for anyone interested in visiting a beautifully maintained and manicured memorial to the war dead, Kranji certainly merits 5 gold stars!"
,,Beautifully kept memorial to fallen heroes,4.0,,"This memorial is off the beaten track - as far as the typical tourist sights go. Unlike another reviewer, I don't believe you would stumble across it. We caught the MRT out and then a bus to the memorial but walked back to the station once we had our bearings. The memorial is beautifully maintained. There is a little bit of the history ... But it really only serves to supplement what is assumed people know about the Second World War experienced in Singapore.

The dedication of the gardeners and maintenance staff is to be commended. The memorial is a significant reminder about how many countries across the commonwealth were impacted by events in Singapore."
,,Well done Singapore on maintaining this Memorial!,5.0,,We visited the Kanji War Memorial as part of a day tour. My only regret we only had 30 minutes there. A very solemn place to reflect on the loss of so many lives. The detail of their bravery and sacrifice is itched in stone forever.
,,"Don't plan a visit, I'm sure you'll pass by inadvertently",3.0,,"I live in Singapore and I pass by this memorial almost daily. If you're a tourist, I'm sure you'll pass by it inadvertently while visiting some of the other landmarks around the area. I wouldn't suggest making this a destination. It's a very important memorial, but I think you'd be better serve visiting a history museum where you can learn in detail the bravery and sacrifice Singaporeans made during the WWII"
,,A sobering reminder of the great tragedy of war,5.0,,". Whilst a little out of town catch the SMRT and take in a bit of everyday suburban life...about 20 mins from Orchard.
The monument and grounds are impeccably kept and a moving reminder of the great sacrifices and tragedy of war. I always walk from the station and it takes about 15 mins. I do this to remember the soldiers who found themselves all of a sudden in a tropical climate so unfamiliar to home. Its a hot walk and wouldn't recommend it to one who is unfit but if you want to let your imagination run riot try marching then imagine what the conditions must have been like....pretty sobering and well worth the visit."
,,peaceful,5.0,,well worth the effort to pay your respects to the men and women who gave their lives in this theatre of war -and learn from singaporeans what they feel about it...
,,Well maintained,5.0,,"I'm always very impressed when I visit Commonwealth War Cemeteries around the world. Whether it is in India, France or Singapore they are always maintained to a very high standard. Today was just my second visit to Kranji Cemetery, the last visit having been about 10 years ago. Beautiful location and well designed, provides a respectful last working place for those who sacrificed their lives in the war against the Japanese."
,,Well Maintained WWII Cemetery/Memorial and Tribute to Heroes!,5.0,,"I was happy I took the long subway ride to see the beautifully kept historical site! Kudos to the groundskeepers for their work in maintaining the site! Even though I was only there for about 45 minutes, it was well worth the trip to include walking 1 km in the wrong direction. I learned a lot about the involvement of Singapore and the military heroes, men and women, who lost their lives during WWII. Being I'm a USA military veteran, I was honored to see the memorial to fallen comrades.

The site is not easy to find and one can either walk the wrong way or miss the sign for the memorial. When exiting the Kranji station turn left and walk to the intersection with lights. Stay on the sidewalk on the same side as the station. When you get to the intersection walk straight ahead until you see a brown sign that reads cemetery. I don't believe it's states Kranji War Memorial on the sign?? Turn left down the narrow road until you reach the cemetery. You should be able to see the memorial monument with a star like top at the main road.

May you continue to Rest in Peace heroes!"
,,Respectful final resting place,5.0,,"Whilst war is never good, it's great to see a war graves site kept in such fine condition. The monuments and the grounds honour those who have made the ultimate sacrifice."
,,The great museum of historical warfare in Singapore,5.0,,This is highly recommended place if you love history . The beautifully kept museum holds the pieces on the war times - picture which are historical - to take you back to the era . Very impressive. The outside the museum too the whole area is enthalling . Do not miss it if you are in Singapore . Must visit in mornings - it gets too hot during day time . .
,,Brave Men and Women,5.0,,My family and I enjoyed our visit to the Kranji War Memorial during our Battlefields tour. The area is amazing and I felt very privileged to see this Memorial to all the brave soles who lost their lives. Well worth a visit.
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"Attended a dawn service here. Was lovely to see the countries' representative armed forces there, very, very moving."
,,A stunning tribute,5.0,,"A very humbling experience. Lovely, well tended environment, a credit to the CWGC and a wonderful tribute to the 'fallen'. The price of war is described in graphic detail. Travelling from the railway station can be a little difficult."
,,Great Memorial but Not a Must Do for Visitors,5.0,,"So if you're into war memorials, then you might want to make your way out to this memorial from WWII. It's well kept up and just so cool how ranking soldiers are buried next to any other soldier. We spent about an hour here. It's really well kept up and a pretty area. It's a bit off the beaten path. I'm not familiar if there is a good bus stop or MRT nearby so you might want to consider taking a taxi or driving there. If you're not that excited about war memorials, then this is something you can exclude from your trip for sure."
,,Solemn and peaceful,5.0,,"Such a solemn place so many wasted lives, these are only the servicemen the civilian population was equally if not more tragic."
,,Very worth a visit,5.0,,Visit the war Memorial and remember the horrible experiences of those held captive by the Japanese Imperial forces during WWII. Lest we forget.
,,Surperb,5.0,,"This is probably the best museum regarding WWII in this area. It tells in great detail about the Japanese invasion and how the POW's were treated. It is very hard to look at some of the exhibits, but it really tells you what it was all about. Allow a day."
,,Worth a visit....,3.0,,"It was a bit of effort to get there distance wise and we walked with young kids in the heat from MRT station, but I'm glad we made the effort. The memorial is beautifully kept and a lovely tribute to those who lost in their lives in WWII."
,,Humbling,5.0,,The cemetery wasn't very easy to find from Kranji MRT but once there it was worth the effort. It is beautifully maintained and the information available makes it easy to engage with the whole experience. A worthwhile trip to pay respects to the thousands who gave their lives and their futures for our modern day world.
,,Moving Experience,5.0,,The war memorial is a very moving experience.It is very well maintained and they honor our Australian soliders like their own. Well worth the visit.
,,Humbling,5.0,,"If you are an Australian, this is a must do to pay your respects when in Singspore. Incredibly humbling knowing that these people gave their lives for you. Very well maintained and easy to get to. We caught a cab for less than $10 after the Zoo. Then caught the MRT from Kranjj station back into town with the station being a very easy walk next to the Singapore Turf Club."
,,Amazing Tour,5.0,,"Amazing insight into Singapore's history, wonderful tour of the Kranji War Memorial, which is beautifully maintained. Very much recommend this tour."
,,A Place for Remembrance,5.0,,"A very lovely but also sad place to go.
Kranji War Memorial is worth a visit. Do not expect any tourist attraction. It is a calm and peaceful place a bit off the tourist trail.
As there are no facilities to buy something to drink, please, make sure you buy some water or so at the MRT KRANJI.
You can either walk to the memorial (1km or so) or take a taxi.
The memorial is the burial site of thousands of service staff who died during the actions of WWII.
The site itself is tranquil and after a stroll along the many graveyards you can sit there, relax, read or simply enjoy the freedom these people fought for. As it is on hill there is a nice breeze, too.
When I was there in June 2015 they had two toilet facilities at the entrance (those blue plastic toilet houses).
The memorial is going to be closed at 7pm."
,,Remembrance to those who fight valiantly against aggression and wars,4.0,,"This war memorial was just 5 minutes drive from my house. Each time I drive past this place, it reminds me of the wartime horror stories that my parents told me.

When the Japanese Imperial Army invaded Singapore, my father was just 14 years old.His third uncle was arrested and persecuted by the Japanese when they came to know that he was a member of the underground anti-Japanese guerilla.

My late grandmother was warded at the then Woodbridge Hospital when the Japanese came. The Japanese tied her up into gunny sack and dumped her into the sea to be drowned to death. Some of the violent mental patients in the hospital also suffered the same fate.

My mother was only 5 years old then when the Japanese Imperial Army marched into Singapore. She cried in horror and had haunting dreams every night for every day she would pass the road in front of her house and witnessed decapitated human bodies or bodiless heads dripping with blood hung on wooden poles. She had to use charcoal to blacken her face so as to look ugly and unappetitizing to the Japanese soldiers who were hungrily preying for rape victims.

My auntie's baby was thrown into the air and stabbed to death by the samurai swords.

My father related an occasion when he was helping and attending to a grocery store of a relative when a fierce Japanese soldier came and took a packet of cigarette from the store without paying. Being young and naive, my dad struggled with him trying to grab the packet of cigarette back from him. The aggressive Japanese soldier shouted at my father and forcefully strangled my father at his neck, almost choking him to death. At that crucial juncture between life and death, a Japanese military police officer (the dreaded Kempeitai) suddenly intervened and gave that soldier who was still strangling my father, a hard two tight slaps on the cheeks. That soldier immediately released his hold and left abruptly returning the packet of cigarette to my father. When my father woke up from consciousness, the said military police officer was nowhere to be found.

Till to date, my father was still grateful to this officer who saved his life. Probably, he thinks, not all the invading Japanese soldiers were inhumane and cruel, this officer was probably a victim of circumstances forced to serve the fascist army.

That 3 yrs and 8 months of Japanese rule brought extensive devastating misery to many of our ancestors. Each time those horror stories were told, my hair would stand.

For those who had not experienced the brutal war or witnessed the holocaust, we should consider ourselves fortunate and should treasure this peaceful moments to be in a safe and prosperous country. We should contribute our energy towards the building of a strong nation awe by those who attempt to invade us.

The Kranji Memorial is a great monumental hall dedicated to all our great Second World War unsung heros who perished in their valiant fight against aggression and war brutality. They deserved all our due respect and salute."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"A very sad, but picturesque place. The grounds are beautifully manicured and contain the graves of over 4000 service personnel. It is easy to get to via the MRT and is a relatively short walk from the station (just over a kilometre). I would recommend either go early in the morning or late in the afternoon as it is very hot during the middle of the day and make sure you take water with you."
,,Tasteful memorial,4.0,,"This is a bit off the tourist trail but for those with an interest in history this is worth a visit. There is no glam with this memorial. It is a simple, highly respectful place, and very well looked after."
,,Wonderful Memorial,5.0,,Wonderful Memorial the sun was shining and this was full of tourists from all over the world all come together to see this place. Wonderful figures and the water and fountains just magic what a stunning place.
,,A moving memorial to the horrors and heroes of a brutal war,5.0,,"The war memorial at Kranji is a lesser known gem in the northern side of Singapore, near the causeway. Reaching the place after alighting from Kranji MRT Station was a bit tricky, but I was able to ask my way to the place. However, once there, the memorial cum cemetery took my breath away.

The memorial houses graves of Allied soldiers who died in the Battle of Singapore during the Second World War, while striving to defend the 'indomitable fortress' of Singapore from the rampant Japanese. The graves include soldiers of Chinese, Indian, Malay, British and Australian origin along with local volunteers who enlisted in the war effort and lost their lives. The graves are well laid out and a memorial stone honors the memories of all these martyrs.

Also, there is a separate garden near the entrance which is being developed as teh State Cemetery. This holds graves of Singapore's 1st two Presidents: Yusof Ishak and Benjamin Sheares.

The Kranji War Cemetery is a place for quiet reflection on the horrors of war and highlights the importance of maintaining the peace for our own and future generations."
,,Very Moving,4.0,,"Like most war memorials this is a very well kept and moving memorial to Allied Servicemen / women from WWII. Situated north of the Island, not far from the Malay bridge, it is well worth the train ride and short walk.

If you time it well you can be there at sunset and catch the night safari on your way back into town."
,,Sad memories beautifully presented,5.0,,"There are a lot of sad memories when you visit places like this. However you need to visit Kranji War Memorial just to see the love that has been put into the up keep and maintenance. Read the head stones, the stores, they gave their all for our freedom. RIP"
,,Beautifully kept,5.0,,"As usual, the commonwealth war graves commission have done an awesome job keeping the graves of these fine service men/women in tip top condition. they should be very proud of what they do!!"
,,"Solemn, peaceful and honourable.",4.0,,It was a peaceful place for the departed souls of the heroes who fought bravely against the brutal invaders. Very well decorated and kept in pristine condition. The park is best visited with an experienced guide who will be there to explain the significance of the monuments and the heroes buried there.
,,"Very moving,,",5.0,,"Catch train to Kranji station, as you exit station turn left, don't bother catching a bus (unless you aren't very mobile) and walk about 10 minutes to the Kranji private road. You will need to cross major intersection with lights. Big signs directing you to Kranji memorial. Kranji is kept in pristine condition and worth spending a little while there just looking around at interesting headstones,"
,,Memorable Place,5.0,,"We went to visit the wall as there was a family member remembered there.
The place is so clean and very well looked after. The gardeners were there when we arrived but they moved away when we arrived so as not to encroach on our time. So respectful."
,,A memorable place,4.0,,It was interesting seeing this remarkable War Cemetery and acknowledge the sacrifice of so many from so many different countries. Gorgeous location
,,Remembrance for the fallens.,5.0,,"A war memorial containing graves of thousands of allied troops - the men and women from Britain, Australia, Canada, Sri Lanka, India, Malaya, the Netherlands and New Zealand who died in the line of duty during World War II.

Located far out from the main city.

Take the MRT Nourth-south line (red line) and alight at Kranji. It's about 1km walk from the train station.

Open from 8-6.30pm. Bring along an umbrella to shade yourselves from the mid-day sun."
,,Remember,5.0,,"Sometimes we (Europeans) only remember ""our"" parts of the war. It is good to see things like this to remind ourselves that this affected everyone, and that people all across the world gave their lives for their countries. Thank you for your sacrifice."
,,very sad,5.0,,My wife and i had heard about the war memorial and decided to go and visit it.It was very emotional not just for the young Australians laying there but all nationalities that died in the war. We got the train then a small walk to the entrance it's such a lovely setting with the walls and the headstones all in pristine condition and the gardeners working away with the respect i believed they knew that a special place like this has.
,,just Amazing,5.0,,"Kranji Comonwealth War Graves it an amazing construction, exceptionally well designed and extremely well maintained. It is a place of sincere respect and I think they have done an extraordinary job of honouring those that gave there lives so that we can live in free world. It is well worth a visit."
,,war memorial,3.0,,"took the mrt train to kranji very clean but crowded. 3 train changes and 45 minutes ,may be quicker by taxi because once off the train hailed taxi to cemetry $4 dollars and 5 minutes later we were there. very solomn ,but you can see all the graves in less than 30 minutes and then we walked back to the train station .took 30 minutes and did the return trip should have taken a taxi for a few extra dollars ,but held him at the memorial for the return trip because you are in the middle of a park with no transport .please take time to reflect on the young soldiers that gave their lives to keep us free .very humbling"
,,Round Island Tour,5.0,,"The tour guide was able to provide very detailed information on the war, how the Japanese conquered Singapore and the battle sites. It was very moving to see the numbers of people who fought and died for freedom."
,,our trip to the War Memorial,5.0,,actually we passed it by chance and had a look. Very well maintained and clean. It is worth the trip there. We stopped on our way back from the Changi Prison.
,,Kranji war graves,5.0,,"The commonwealth war graves at Kranji are well worth a visit,they are the last resting place of 100,s of commomnwealth soldiers,a very heart renching and touching place perfectly maintained,go by mrt and walk ,can get very hot"
,,Anzac Service,5.0,,Have been to the last couple of Dawn Services at the Kranji War Memorial and they do the full Anzac service hosted on alternating years by either the Australian or New Zealand High Commisions. The place is in fabulous condition and meticulously maintained. Recommend a visit. And note that the Boomerang bar on Robertson Quay does a free bus service to and from the dawn service for patrons that book for breakfast after the service.
,,Awe-Inspiring,5.0,,The Commonwealth War Graves Commission have done an amazing job in setting up and maintaining this solemn place of respect and dignity. Definitely worth a visit
,,There is nothing to see.,1.0,,"this is just a place where people remember those that died in world war 2. The main feature is a monument that was built to remember them. Other than that there is nothing much to see.

It is very far from the city. I feel that time can be spend more wisely at other attractions."
,,Had the honor and absolute priviledge to become a soldier here,5.0,,"Being the founding batch member of Singapore Armed Force Volunteer Corp, our weapon handover ceremony took place in Kranji War Memorial.

Being the largest World War II's cemeteries in Asia, the place is solemn yet tranquil. For those who are interested to visit the grave, or pay tribute to World War II Heroes, this is a must visit. This place also is a strong wake up call that so many of our predecessors and ancestors died for us only less than 70 years back, just to ensure that you and I can have the peaceful and prosperous life we have today.

I would highly recommend visiting the Museum at Bukit Chandu and the Old Ford factory, before coming to the Kranji War memorial. This way , the people who died for the freedom of you and I will very much be imprinted in your memory for the rest of the life, and we will never take our life for granted."
,,Kranji War Memorial,5.0,,"This place was very peaceful and the grounds were beautiful. There were registers for people to see where their loved ones are, the register will tell you which wall your loved ones name is on.

A lovely place to visit.

There are no toilets and will be difficult for those with mobility issues."
,,Pride and honor,4.0,,In god we puts our hopes and we puts our trusts They die for free in our lands and free for our future generations. The blood of soldier never waste in time.
,,Worth the trip,4.0,,Kranji is a long way from central Singapore but if you have an interest and respect for war history it is worth a visit. There's not a great deal to see other than the well maintained graves and the memorial with names of all the soldiers who died here during WWII. If you're up this way though it's definitely worth dropping in. Or come for the Anzac Day service that's on every year at 6.15am on 25 April.
,,A special place,5.0,,"It is about a 45 minute MRT ride to Kranji Station and then a 15 minute walk to the Memorial but for me it was worth it.
I've never been to a war memorial like Kranji and, although I have no family ties to the WWII battle, I found it quite moving.
I visited on my 42nd birthday and found a soldier who was 42 when he was killed and died in 1942. I also found a soldier that had been killed 70 years prior on the date of my birthday. It gave me chills.
The Memorial is very well maintained and as an Australian I was thankful for those who served our country overseas but failed to come home."
,,Thought provoking,5.0,,such a sad experience when seeing the ages of the young men who died during the invasion and occupation. The memorial is well maintained and the groundsmen do the memorial proud. Well worth a visit
,,Very Well Maintained !!!!!,4.0,,One of the best places to visit if you are in Singapore. Good for children as well as Adults. Good for knowledge purpose.
,,A Tranquil Place To Appreciate The Peace We Live In Current Times,4.0,,"I had wanted to visit this memorial for some time and I finally did.

This is a tranquil place to be in. Walking around the vast neatly manicured and well-kept memorial gave me a chance to reflect and appreciate the peaceful times that we currently live in.

I looked at some of the grave markers and I felt grateful for many soldiers who were not local who gave up their lives defending Singapore during the World War.

Visiting this memorial should be for National Education, so people can appreciate the tough period that our forefathers went through and be grateful for what we have right now."
,,Blissful,4.0,,This is a world war 2 memorial. The place is peaceful and has a calm atmosphere. One could easily say that its very well looked after. One probably even feels sad as you know how many people lost their lives in the war. For history lovers like me its a great place to visit and spend some time.
,,Moving experience,5.0,,"Visited just after Anzac Day, beautifully maintained and interesting reading the names of all the heroes that gave their lives"
,,A must for any keen world war II historian,5.0,,"A quiet gem in Singapore north. Easy to get their via Kranji MRT plus a 10 minute walk. Google Maps will get you there. Amazing to see so many imperial forces represented at the cemetery, from Australian, NZ, Indian and UK. A real credit to the Commonwealth War Grave Commission."
,,"Take a guide,",5.0,,"We were there for the Gallipoli 100yr celebrations, This Memorial will reveal so much more than you can imagine if you have a historian or knowledgeable guide."
,,ANZAC Dawn service,5.0,,"We were in Singapore for the ANZAC day and wanted to attend the dawn service. Very different from attending in Australia it was warm and humid. We were staying only about 5km away and chose to go by taxi which we were easily able to hail on the morning. Taxis are very cheap in Singapore in comparison to Australia.

The Memorial and Cemetery was an amazing peaceful well kept place. The dawn service was very well attended by a huge cross section of people. People attended in attire ranging from their gym gear, to shorts and t-shirts, to formal suits and dresses.

It was a moving service and I'm glad we attended.

The memorial is also a short distance from the MTR station which we walked to at the conclusion."
,,Peaceful and presented well.,5.0,,"Something about this place. Peaceful. Well looked after. Sit and take it all in under the tree. Time for reflection when visiting.

Make sure you stop for loo stop before visiting. If hot day have water with you to make sure you are comfortable so you can not miss out on seeing this memorial.

When we were there we had two military helicopters fly over plus an F18. Certainly made it a place where you were proud to be an Australian. Also was very moving. So many young men and women gave there lives."
,,Thought provoking -,5.0,,"Cant help leaving there with a lump in your throat,for all those brave men and women who died in the War. Well maintained Memorial, with beautiful gardens."
,,Moving in the Extreme,5.0,,"I am of an age that while I didn't go to war had close relatives who did and some who perished. That was in the European Theatre but this Memorial was almost as moving as the visit I paid to the Vimy Ridge where my grandfather was and the churchyard in France where my uncle is buried.
If you are interested in the history of the occupation time here is not to be missed."
,,A Moving Visit,5.0,,Once again I found the visit to the Kranji Cemetry and War Memorial to be a very moving experience. The area is in pristine condition and well deserving for such an icon.
,,Calm down and remember,4.0,,History is always give you lessons and you will feel the same on your visit here. You feel honored and same time sad to have these wars when there is so much love to express and share......... nice place to visit with your family and friends.....
,,A serene place and a moving experience,5.0,,"A beautiful, serene and moving place to visit. My wife's late grandfather is buried here having died between the end of the war and repatriation to the UK. A nicer resting place is hard to imagine with immaculately tended lawns and a wonderful view of downtown Singapore.
The rows upon rows of graves and headstones bring home the senselessness of war and the sacrifice that so many young soldiers made."
,,Very moving,5.0,,Go early to avoid the heat - but worth the visit as it's a very moving place to visit Easy to get to using the metro and a 2 stop bus ride (or a 10 minute walk)
,,A Quiet Resting Place,5.0,,"There are 4,461 allied soldiers buried here who died in the defence of Singapore , the cemetery is meticulously cared for , as are all Commonwealth War graves. If you have the time well worth a visit."
,,What an emotional service,5.0,,"On a peaceful hill in Northern Singapore, we joined the thousands of Aussies and Kiwis at the Anzac Dawn Service for the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landing.
It was an honour to be part of this very moving tribute to commemorate their sacrifice, and to witness the loving way that this cemetery is being cared for.
After the service, we spent some quiet reflective time walking down the lines of graves, reading the headstones.
You can take the MRT to Kranji station, and then there is a 170 bus to take you to the Kranji memorial stop near the entrance road, and it is about 500 meters walk, slightly uphill to the cemetery ."
,,A must see on you stay in Singapore Kranji Memorial,5.0,,"Such a beautiful quite place given the pain and suffering that went on during the War, Lest We Forget."
,,Beautifully maintained and peaceful memorial - worth the visit!,5.0,,"We took the train from the city to Kranji station - (we purchased a 3 day tourist metro pass at the train station which has served us very well so far!)

The train took about 40-45 mins on the excellent train system. At Kranji you can take the bus out the front, it's only two stops (we asked the driver and he stopped the bus right out front of the road leading to the memorial). To walk from the station, turn left out of the station and follow the footpath that runs parallel to the road and train. You will have to cross one main road (location of the turf club). About 10 mins walk out of the station and you will see the signs directing you left up a narrow road, follow the road up and around the corner and your there.

The memorial itself is beautifully maintained and set of a grassy hill. The memorial books located at the site contain information on those buried at the site. We spent about 45 mins at the memorial grounds and could have spent longer. At the time (4pm) it was not too busy and a thunderstorm overhead created a solemn yet amazing atmosphere, hard to describe but will be impossible to forget.

This place should be a must to those visiting, particularly those of the commonwealth nations who gave so many young lives for the peace we enjoy to this day.

Lest we forget."
,,Reverence,4.0,,"The Kranji War Memorial is a somber grassland surrounded by Singapore. Whilst this may seem a play on words the reality is that Singapores current position as a first world country with a modern technologically advanced finance and industrial sector is in no small way a result of the history that can be found at Kranji. Situated near the new Turf Club, the memorial is a tribute to all nationalities that fought and died in the protection and defence of Singapore, specifically over represented are diggers from Australia and New Zealand, as well as Brits, Chinese and all those that paid the ultimate sacrifice.
Kranji War Memorial is maintained by local staff funded by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and is a living tribute to those men and women that lay to rest. The site itself is important and there are bronze plaques that act as story boards to share the key points of the island conflict during the Second World War, visible from the high ground Kranji is situated on.
MRT access is remote so if not driving consider a taxi. There are no toilets or wTer fountains and it does get hot, so take some water.
ANZAC Day (25 April) is celebrated at the memorial every year with a dawn service. If you intend a visit, ANZAC Day is the day to visit if you can, if not any day that you can dedicate a couple of hours is rewarded paying homage to those that lay here.
Please take notice of the actual memorial wall as you walk from the car park, it signifies a submarine conning tower and aircraft wings!"
,,Peaceful,5.0,,So very well kept not a weed in sight. And such a peaceful place well worth a visit even if you have no one there
,,Another beautiful commonwealth war cemetary,5.0,,"Beautifully kept - set upon a hill with almost panoramic views. We took a taxi to get here as it is quite far out from the city centre (about a 20 minute drive) but the taxi was very cheap - costing us about $17 (Singapore dollars)
Lots of places to sit and rest in the shade and take in the serenity of the place. It was a very moving visit - made more moving by discovering my great uncles name is on the huge memorial here having been shot down over Singapore in 1945."
,,Well kept memorial to the fallen,5.0,,"Set on a hill side, the cemetery is immaculately kept and a fitting memorial to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice so that we can live in a predominantly free world."
,,The price of freedom and peace,5.0,,I learnt a lot on my visit to kanji war memorial through the mobile application by twapps. they spoke about some of the notable soldiers and their stories.
,,A beautiful setting for the fallen.,5.0,,Whoever chose the setting for the war cemetry clearly had the spirits of the fallen close at heart. It is an elevated cemetry with beautiful views. Such well tended gardens and headstones. It was also nice to see Singaporean children having a lesson there to learn from the lessons of the past.
,,A Place everyone should visit,4.0,,This cemetery is amazing so well cared for & so many graves it is very moving walking through the headstones & reading some of the stories. It is truly a beautiful resting place for those who gave their lives
,,"Moving place to visit, so well kept",5.0,,I visited here on an island trip and was pleasantly surprised to see how beautifully everything was presented. There are many gravestones here of Australians as well as British. Take time to walk over the whole site as it is qite large. Would recommend visiting this place.
,,Reality check,5.0,,The Kranji War Memorial is an amazing experience that makes one realise the horrific results of the fall of this beautiful nation. It is immaculate and peaceful and does bring a few tears to your eyes. Trip advisor has comments that the cab drivers do not know where it is and they would be correct!! You could catch the MRT to Kranji station and walk about 1klm. It is up near the Malay border and cost us approx 25.00SGD in a cab from Havelock Rd even with the getting lost bit. We did have the exact address but that was not a great help. The war memorial is on the opposite side of the road to the Singapore Turf Club. Well recommended and it was heartwarming to see a group of young men paying their respects also.
,,A beautiful memorial to the fallen soldiers.,5.0,,"Firstly, how to get there, take the MRT to Kranji Mrt station which is about 50 mins out of the city. As you leave the station turn Left and walk along the road for 1
km or 10 mins, if you are lucky, as we were, there was a bus at the station going that way and the driver kindly dropped us off and pointed up the road where we were to go. It is a bit of a walk up a side road to the memorial which is not very visible from the main road.
It is a very well presented place located on a slope with the names of the fallen chiselled into vertical columns. We found a few relatives, write down the numbers of the columns so that others can quickly find relevant names if visiting in the future.
Please note that is was very very hot there in Feb so go prepared, there are no shops or toilets at the cemetery.
At Kranji MRT station there are toilets but the paper is on the outside so get some before you go in. There is a basic café at the station to get cold drinks etc,"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Hired a car with driver for 4hrs. $75 well worth it. We had tried to find Kranji War Memorial on a previous visit to Singapore, using MRT, but got lost.
Last visited Kranji in 1968 while at school in Singapore, it is timeless! Beautiful tribute to all buried there. Very moving as you wander around, for all those brave servicemen and women who gave their lives so that we could be free!"
,,A fitting tribute to the fallen in WW2,5.0,,"I was expecting to have to visit several cemetries in Singapore to pay my respects to the allies killed in action in Singapore in WW2. What a fitting tribute that all allies killed or who were executed or died in Japanese POW Camps are all buried here / or have memorial headstones here. The extent of allied losses in Singapore in WW2 hits home here, with over 24,000 war graves. Its fitting that Captains / Squadron Leaders / Majors lie side by side with Privates, Able Seamen & Pilots.....no allocations based on rank. The grounds are magnificently maintained & presented by The Commonwealth War Graves. Indeed, a fitting & moving tribute to the 24,000 fallen heroes."
,,A peaceful beautiful resting place,5.0,,This is a magnificent war graves cemetery. It is beautifully kept and worth a visit. if like me you are a bit of an emotional softy be prepared it will tug at your heart strings when you read some of the messages on the headstones
,,It's a War memorial,5.0,,It's a War Memorial. Not sure how it can be rated. In any case- as most places in Singapore take water.
,,Very well designed aesthetic,5.0,,"I do not think you can spend much time here, but the memorial is beautifully put together and definitely worth a visit."
,,A fine setting for a sad and beautiful place,5.0,,"We have visited many of the war graves in Europe, and the continuity of presentation with this one in deepest Asia was striking. However the setting on a rise overlooking the norther straits and adjacent city of Johore Bahru was striking and nostalgic."
,,Hilltop memorial,5.0,,"This is worth the long walk up to the top. Lovely views across the bay. Not for the disabled but if you can do it,then do. Tells a lot of Singapore history."
,,"Peaceful, Moving , Well Maintained Memorial",5.0,,"A ""must visit"".

A very moving cemetery / memorial to the sacrifice made by a number of predominantly very young people. 24000 servicemen (lot of nationalities) buried / listed here. Exceptionally well maintained and very peaceful with views over Singapore. I was on my own (except for 3 gardeners) for an hour long visit.

Best to come by car if possible , easy parking. If you come by MRT it is about a 15 minute walk. Turn left out of the MRT and stick to the main road (crossing another en route) , then its down a lane on your left. Well signed at that point. No facilities so take water."
,,Beaufully looked after memorial,5.0,,"The War Memorial is in the northern part of the island. We went by car but I can imagine it might be tricky to get there by public transport.
It is a memorial not only to those who died in conflict but also the last resting place for wives and children of British serving soldiers who presumably died of disease or natural caused.

We were amazed at the great number of Indian solders ( pre-partition) and Australian soldiers who are buried here. A fitting last resting place to remember all these people."
,,So peacefull.,5.0,,I had been here 50years ago when living in Singapore as a child and it is just how I remember it.So perfectly cared for in a beautifull setting and so very peacefull.It was my husbands 1st visit and he was very moved by it.A lovely place to remember those who lost their lives.
,,Quiet Memorial,3.0,,A quiet war memorial. Would appreciate some interactive display recounting the war and the sacrifice that these brave men offered to keep others safe. Maybe the authorities could study how other memorials are run so that we could honor these brave souls in better ways.
,,Ok,3.0,,It was a typical war memorial depicting all the things singapore went through during the World Wars. Decent.
,,Pretty good,4.0,,A bit of a trek to get out there and you only need about 1-1.25 hours max but worthwhile and an interesting bit of history to be learned about Singapore and the occupation by the Japanese. It is a simple exhibit - not really a full blown museum but a simple and well planned series of rooms with artifacts and stories depicting the war time era in Singapore.
,,Peace,5.0,,"The plants are healthy and grass are green. Well done for those who keep up the maintenance there. If you are driving there, there is a open carpark directly in front of the entrance. No parking fee or entrance fee."
,,Respect shown,4.0,,I was delighted to find how well the Kranji War Memorial was kept. It made me feel so grateful that so much respect was shown to the young men and women who gave their lives in such terrible circumstances. Thank you to all Departments responsible.
,,road trip,4.0,,"a serene and extremely well maintained place. rather hard to get to without a car. If you're interested in doing something a little less touristy, consider going on a road trip on this tiny island. it might be fun to check these out: https://downloadadate.wordpress.com/2015/02/01/road-trip-top-6-things-to-do/"
,,Very moving,4.0,,"An amazing tribute to the fallen heros of WWII...as like everything in Singapore, the grounds were immaculate & was not crowded, so a lovely experience."
,,A beautifully kept and presented memorial.,5.0,,This beautiful memorial and gardens was a most fitting tribute to those who lost their lives. A large group of young soldiers on national service were visiting at the time we arrived - a poignant reminder.
,,Lest We Forget,5.0,,"Take a deep breath and hang on to your emotions because you are going to need a hankie or two. I lived in Singapore 72-73 and for me it became a place of peace and gratefulness. And all these years later, my feelings have not changed. With much emotion I re-walked every row and thought of families missing these soldiers. I come from an army family and the feelings it stirred in me I cannot put into words. I stood for so long after my walk almost feeling as if I did not want to leave these soldiers. If you really think about the Battle to save Singapore and the lives lost to do so, you too will find it hard to leave Kranji. Do yourself a favour - read the story before you leave on your holiday, (Google it if you have to), and you will have an even better understanding. I can't leave here without a tear. By the way, it is immaculately maintained."
,,A place everyone must visit with the mobile application or tour guide!,4.0,,"Even though im a Singaporean, the last time i went there was during a school trip back in the early 2000s. I decided to visit it again after looking through some photos during Total Defence Day.

The cemetery was beautiful and very well-maintained. I would go to the extent of saying that it was comparable to the Soviet Union Memorial, which i had visited in mid 2013.

Before i went to the cemetery, I managed to find a mobile application on appstore (because i didnt want to spend money on a tour) before i went, and it really helped to make my journey a really good one.

There were videos which recounted the stories of different soldiers and explained what the monuments at the cemetery represented. It's so good that i would highly recommend it to my friends visiting Singapore. There were also useful tips on the amenities at the war memorial and directions to get there.

However, the cemetery is mainly open air, so it would be good to put more sunblock and wear sunglasses. Toilets are also not available there so it would be good to not drink too much water. Also, bring an umbrella just in case if it rains. There is no shelter on the way out to the train station."
,,A truly memorable visit with a personal drive,5.0,,"My wife's uncle was killed in the second world war whilst serving in India. Sadly, his body was never recovered and hence there was no formal funeral as such. A few years ago we learned, however, that his name was included in the memorial walls at Kanji War Memorial. The grounds are beautifully maintained and we were touched on finding his name on one of the plaques. We now feel some form of closure."
,,The Reason For My Visit,5.0,,"I said I would go and see where my late fathers ,father died in ww2 ,I found it very sad ,and found my grandfathers name ,I cried as his name is my grandsons name ,it makes you very little when you see so many names /it is so spotless no rubbish or litter ,shared a taxi with an elderly new Zealand couple who were staying in the same hotel ,and where also making a visit"
,,A Must see,5.0,,"A tribute to all who fell in the war, the grounds are well maintained and the Register both at the entry and up the top are well documented, Make sure you can get a Taxi before heading out there as there few and far between out that way."
,,Very moving and interesting visit,5.0,,The graves and grounds are kept exceptionally tidy and is a very moving place especially for people who have known people lost in the battle and Changai jail
,,We will remember them,5.0,,"As you would expect both of Singapore and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the grounds are spotless and well manicured. This is a thought provoking remembrance of the sad loss of life that took place in Singapore, mostly but not exclusively during WWII and is well worth a visit. Following a 15 minute walk from the Kranji MRT along the pavement(sidewalk) of a busy highway, the peace and calm of the cemetery is even more striking. The beautiful grounds are an oasis overlooking the rapidly spreading concrete jungle of Singapore. Note that are no facilities or refreshments available here and that there is little shade; bring water with you."
,,Beautifully maintained peaceful spot,4.0,,Always good to take time to reflect on the past - helped here by the stunning setting and beautifully maintained gardens. Signage from the MRT station is very poor indeed.
,,Take time to visit,5.0,,Took detour after sungei buloh wetlands. Exit bus 925 opposite the turf club (horse racing track) and walk back to main junction where there is safe pedestrian crossing. The entrnce is about 100 metres from junction. As we walked up the country road - singaporean army cadets were coming out. The war graves commission does a superb job - and there were plenty of workers keeping the gardens beautiful and the graves well cared for. It was peaceful and in plaques around the site there were lots of info on history. To the left side of the main memorial there are two cabinets which contain details of those who were not repatriated - and where their names are on the memorial.
,,Solemn and thought provoking,3.0,,"Any war memorial is going to be a sad place but Kranji has the additional factor of being so strangely quiet in a country that is normally seething with activity.
I visited on a weekday with my father - a veteran of the Royal Navy in 1945 - who was based in Singapore. I now live here and have seen a huge degree of change over thirty years.
Kranji has a lovely sense of serenity but as you walk past the expertly tendered graves you cannot but marvel at the age of many of those whose remains lie there. It is common to find clusters of young men from the same regiment or ship all 'taken' on the same day. As a History buff, a quick calculation tells you this man died in action but this one died as a prisoner of war. The stories behind each grave are obscure but one thing is for sure, as you walk through and across the neat lines of crosses and headstones the magnitude of the loss is amplified.

The expression from another famous memorial ""Lest we forget"" comes to mind. It is impossible not to be affected by the site.

Not a pleasant journey but for many people a necessary one."
,,lest we forget,5.0,,"with more and more people who served dying, it is easy for the younger generation to forget the atrocities of the world wars. I went here on part of a tour and it was very emotional. As I'm from Europe most of my knowledge has been from the European part of the war. I was humbled by this place, but found it a calm and peaceful place and hope that we never forget."
,,kranji war memorial,3.0,,"Kranji War Cemetery is open every day 07:00-18:30. The cemetery is constructed on a hill with the means of access being via three flights of steps, rising over four metres from the road level, which makes wheelchair access to this site impossible this must be thinked and prepare something for weelchair"
,,A very peaceful and well maintained cemetery,5.0,,"It's a very peaceful and well maintained cemetery with 24,000 + servicemen from WW1, WW2 and a number of other service since either buried here or listed on the memorial walls.

A lot of Australians, but a huge amount of Brits too.

The only downside was the decidedly ratty cemetery manager."
,,THOUGHT PROVOKING,4.0,,"A quiet, sad place which ensures that the sacrifice made by people to keep their freedom is never forgotten."
,,Serenity...,4.0,,"A Place to learn the history, from one point of the Memorial one can see Johor and at the same time the tomb of the first two presidents of Singapore are located with the lawns of the memorial."
,,Impressive and cause for reflection.,3.0,,It is a beautiful simple memorial to those in singapore who died during WW2 . Quiet and peaceful to see and walk around .
,,Time for Reflection,4.0,,We went with a tour group to visit the Memorial. The first impression is inspiring but in a sad way. So very many young people died for our democracy. It always brings tears to my eyes. This is a sight everybody including children should see. Highly recommended.
,,Serenity at its Best,4.0,,"Located North of Singapore, Kranji War Memorial is certain a peaceful place compared to the bustling Singapore. Take a Mrt to Kranji and take a cab (advisable for those with children),Lawns are clean and manicured carpet grass well maintained. As like many war memorials, this is a place to reflect and not to be entertained. Do respect the fallen hero's and learn about how horrible war is. bring along water as it can get quite hot during the afternoon"
,,Moving,5.0,,"The CWGC as ever do an excellent job in maintaining the resting place of those who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving with the ""Forgotten Army"""
,,So sad.,5.0,,"A must to visit,you get this eerie feeling but so sad to see so many graves of such young people from around the world."
,,SOLEMN RECOGNITION OF A SAD PAST,5.0,,"To those of us who had connections with the WW2 past it is good to see that the high standards of the British War Graves Commission have been maintained in Singapore. It was well presented and a fitting memorial to those who lost their lives. As Australians, we were particularly moved by the visit.
Sad but nice to see and acknowledge. Lest we forget."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,The memorial is a quiet and solemn place. It is immaculate and a very moving experience. Well worth a visit to reflect on the past.
,,Neat and well maintained..,5.0,,Reached this memorial on the way to get to the HOHO office. It's a neat and well maintained memorial. Its almost in the heart of the city but maintains its stillness and magnitude.
,,A must see,5.0,,"The people of Singapore have done an amazing job with this war memorial. It is beautiful and serene but at the same time, realising the horrors of war. There are 24000 people buried there from many different countries. I took the train from the CBD and it took about 50 mins. There are signs up in the train station but none outside to give directions. When you walk outside the station, turn left for about one kilometre. It is difficult to see at first as it is behind a bunch of trees."
,,A Peaceful Visit,5.0,,"A well maintained Memorial to all the Men & Women who gave their lives. Take the MRT to Kranji, follow the signs and on exiting the station TURN LEFT and walk for 10 mins. Stay on the main road then you will see a BIG SIGN."
,,Very well maintained,5.0,,"This is an extremely well maintained place setback from the main road, about a ten min. walk from the metro station.

We found it a bit tricky to get directions once we got off the metro but if you leave the main exit and turn leave and walk along the main road (go kart track on your left), then cross the other main road and carry on straight, and take the first left. It's a 100 metres or so up that lane.

We spent about 2hrs here in November on a beautiful sunny day, and i'd definitely suggest visiting. Of everywhere in Singapore, this was definitely the place that sticks in my mind."
,,Time to reflect,5.0,,"I decided that I had to visit this sad place and was extremely pleased on finding it is being kept so pristine, with beautiful cut lawns. Left a message in the visitors book which has messages written in by people from around the world. Sit and spare a minute to reflect the savagery of war and the brave soles who died there."
,,Very moving.,5.0,,Lest we forget. This is a place everyone should visit. It is not large but very moving. I loved the shape of the monument and the significance. The grounds were beautifully maintained.
,,Serene,5.0,,"A Very well kept memorial, peaceful and serene. I really enjoyed walking around reflecting upon the young men from all over the commonwealth that lost their lives in and around Singapore. Be aware that there are no facilities available - bring some water."
,,Must visit for WW2 history buffs,5.0,,"Either take a guided tour (call Changi Museum) for SGD55 (no tips necessary) or do your homework ahead, prior to the visit.

If you are looking for a specific person buried there, staff can assist you.

Take a moment to appreciate the detail of the various units' seals/symbols and the different quotations, some personalized.

See the other smaller memorials nearby, one for the commandos that attempted a second raid on Japanese shipping in SG, another for the Chinese victims of the Sook Ching massacre/purge, and so on.

The war memorial itself is a beautiful work - the columns for the army, the wings for the air, and the conning tower for sea."
,,humbling experience,5.0,,"so well maintained by the gardeners.a short walk from the metro station kranji.the views overlooking Johor bahru,malaysia.truly humbling to see the thousands of graves of such brave men and women."
,,Kranji War Memorial,5.0,,Don't miss this is you are interested in Australian and Allied involvement in WW 11. It's a beautiful place that we visited while on a round island tour. The tour was a fantastic introduction to the cemetery with stories from the tour leader that brought to life what happened during the Japanese invasion and occupation.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Not easy to get to but out of respect we should always remember those who fought on our behalves to make the world a better place.
,,A place for reflection,4.0,,"We visited the war memorial with Singaporean friends on our way to a nearby restaurant. I am a post war baby boomers and grew up under the shadow of the Second World War. The visit was poignant, the neatly manicured grounds with row upon row of beautifully carved headstones seemed a fitting tribute to the many thousands of allied soldiers, sailors, airmen and non-combatants that lost their lives in South East Asia. As an Architect I appreciate the simple forms of the structure which hearken back to the Art Deco style of the 20's & 30's. In reading the inscriptions, what struck me most was that the memorial was also dedicated to the tens of thousands who had died at sea, in the air or on the land, who's remains were never found and therefore did not receive a burial. It is a sobering reminder of how much so many men and women gave to fight against tyranny and the brutality that washed over Asia in WW II. May they rest in peace. It is definitely worth a visit."
,,very moving place,5.0,,"Great to visit if you are into WWII and it's history. It's a cemetery so there is not much else there. Hard to get to as it is not near an MRT, we went on a guided bus tour."
,,Not a place to visit specially but its on the way to merlion,3.0,,If you have lot of time spending and you are walking everywhere then you may come across kranji war memorial. Its on the way while passing from esplanade to merlion . Quite place.
,,a place where you can seek peace.,4.0,,"in a busy city like Singapore. take a break, visit the history and get some peace from this venue. idea for a short break and read a book there. no fees required."
,,Understated Monument,4.0,,This is an understated memorial to those lost battling the Japanese in WWII. This is well cared for and valuable as one of the few historical sites in very modern Singapore.One can view across the straits of Johore where the Japanese invaded Singapore in 1942.
,,Beautifully maintained,5.0,,Located to the north of the island next to the racecourse. Easy to reach on the MRT. Very emotional experience. Recommended for those who can skip the shops and want to see what little history remains in Singapore.
,,Remembrance Day,5.0,,"This was my third visit to the memorial. The grounds are beautifully cared for and are a credit to Singapore. Very impressed with the service at 7:30am on Remembrance Day. The opportunity to visit the graves of the two former Singaporean presidents was a great privilege.
Met some very friendly and helpful members of the Singapore Armed Forces League who kindly took me under their wings after the service.
Thank you to all involved in Kranji War Memorial, you are a credit to Singapore."
,,Not forgotten,5.0,,"It is a shame this is off the beaten track and not really advertised as a tourist site unless you have special interest...probably because it could upset some nationalities. You can get the MRT close by but even then in the humidity, the ""10 minute"" walk is a killer. We took a cab because I wanted to show my wife what I have talked about since my last visit in 1985. It is a peaceful, well manicured landscape with the Commonwealth War Memorial and hundreds of graves of those who died in 1942 in Singapore, Malaya, Burma and at sea. There must have been 20 men working on the lawns when we went....the only visitors that day. It is a grim reminder, but a beautiful resting place. Next time I will spend more time there. Singapore's Lee Kwan Yew is also buried there."
,,Damned Shame,2.0,,"This historical artifact deserves preserving.
It is run down, poorly managed and needs urgent attention.
Steeped in historical significance it is ironic that it is being ignored by the very people it was designed to help.
Singaporeans are quick to forget their history.
Damned shame. You don't see any young people visiting this place and the reasons are obvious - they know nothing of it or its history."
,,A Peaceful Place to Visit,5.0,,Didn't know this memorial was here but a peaceful place to visit. With a beautiful view of the city in the distance.
,,Immaculately kept,5.0,,"This is not easy to get to, as it's on the northwest corner of the island and a significant walk from the MRT. As always with war graves, it's a sad but beautiful place. Note - no toilet facilities."
,,A place for thought.,5.0,,"If your soul is not touched whilst visiting the Kranji War Memorial you are probably devoid of all humanity. It is a beautifully kept garden which give sharp relief to the row upon row of memorials to fallen combatants and leaves the observer with both a feeling of futility at the senseless loss of life but a possible sense of hope that while memorials like this one exist perhaps we can remember and try to prevent it happening again.. Spending time reading the headstones and the lists of those who gave their lives drives home what was for me a very moving experience. I would not recommend spending more than an hour here as that is about as much sorrow as one should be exposed to whilst on holiday, but I would advise packing a clean handkerchief for this emotional journey."
,,well worth a visit,5.0,,very well maintained and quite moving. It is located way out of the city. My friend and I made the mistake of taking a taxi there but someone there told us about the MRT station near by- about a 20 minutes so we took that back. Very nice and clean like Singapore.The people are very nice and helpful. I would go with someone as it is very lonely there.
,,Worth a Stop,4.0,,I went on a tour that included the war memorial. It is very well kept reminder of the allied forces who lost their lives in World War II. It sits on the top of a hill and is an easy walk.
,,touching memorial,5.0,,This is a very touching memorial to those who lost their lives at war. The grounds are kept immaculate and the upmost respect is given by those who conduct tours and the workers who tend to the gardens a must for everyone
,,Disappointing groundsmen,4.0,,"The memorial is fantastic and a great way to remember the fallen. I was very very surprised the groundsmen thought they could rest their water bottles on top of the headstones. The entire time we were there, they had their drink bottle sitting on top of the tombstones. How disrespectful!!"
,,FINDING AN UNCLE,5.0,,"This was nostalgic for my family as my father lost his brother in WW2 in Singapore. I must commend the research and work carried out by the war graves commission in locating graves etc. of deceased servicemen and women and then provide co-ordinates of their resting place. We were on a tour and were able to go straight to the area without delaying our party. The Memorial is immaculately kept. Thankyou Singaporeans. Paul and Lorraine, Milperra nsw Australia."
,,Very fitting memorial to some very brave men and women,4.0,,"We made our way from Chinatown to Kranji via the MRT and this was a good experience in itself, we then caught a taxi from outside the station to the memorial. I was very impressed at the number of workmen who were maintaining the grounds to the excellent standard that they are. We took our time and wandered amongst the gravestones, feeling sorrowful at the ages of the men and women. I highly recommend this site."
,,Resting place,4.0,,A place to honor soldiers who died in the war. Majority were in their late teens/ early twenties. Enjoy the tranquility and peace.
,,We will remember them.,5.0,,"Another immaculate Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery, carefully tended by, for the most part, local employees. Relatively easy to get to from downtown Singapore though it does take over an hour and includes a bus ride as well as the MRT, followed by a 4-500m walk from the bus stop. To get a real idea of what happened in Singapore during World War 2, you should couple this with a visit to the Changi Musuem but doing both will take most of the day as they are at opposite ends of Sinagpore so expect to spend 3 hours travelling to, between and from them."
,,A beautifully maintained memorial to the fallen,5.0,,"I visited on the 11th November this year - seemed an appropriate day. The main remembrance ceremony had taken place on the preceding Sunday, so the place was all but deserted. It is about a 15 minute walk from Kranji MRT, and although it is surrounded by roads and the view from the hill is filled with the industrial parts of Singapore and Johor, the cemetery itself is a little oasis of calm.

Beautifully maintained, it is a very moving tribute to the fallen, and a place I would recommend for quiet contemplation."
,,Poignant,5.0,,"It was a memorably poignant visit to the Kranji War Memorial at the time of the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I, and in the week following Remembrance Sunday. The cemetery itself is managed impeccably by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Even if some of the original tranquillity has been lost there is a stillness and sense of peace. Red poppy wreathes has been placed on the memorial from as a diverse an array of countries as conceivable – British and Australian lay with German and Japanese, Irish with Indian.

Use the Kranji Countryside Assoc. bus from Kranji MRT, and combine with a visit to one of the off the beaten track farms beyond the Kranji Reservoir such as Bollywood Veggies with its fascinating range of fruits, trees and of course veggies and herbs. Great for lunch or afternoon refreshments."
,,A Moving & Emotional Place,5.0,,"I traveled to Singapore with family members with the sole reason of coming here to Kranji as we have a family member buried here at the cemetery. I was completely blown away with how neat & tidy the gardens are kept & how friendly & helpful staff here are. We managed to make it to the Remembrance Sunday service & it was quite an honor to be a part of that. Overall an extremely moving & emotional experience. I'm so glad I came. A few things to mention to any fellow traveller is there are no toilets at Kranji & the MRT station is a good 10minute walk away. If you catch a taxi here, which is quite cost effective, ask them to wait & pay them for their time. Unless you have the Taxi App on your smart phone getting a taxi out of here is impossible. There is practically no shade from the weather here so pre-plan your trip well before heading here.
I left here feeling a lot of different things proud & sad but grateful that such a monument exists & that the fallen are so well looked after. A must do."
,,"Sacrifices Honoured, Remembered",4.0,,"A couple of years ago, a friend from the UK made a request to me that we visit the Kranji War Memorial when she visited me. She explained that she wanted to locate the name of her grandfather who died during the final days of World War 2.

Although at the time I was living not too far from the Memorial, it did not occur to me that it was a place of significance at a personal level. My family like others had suffered tremendous hardships when Malaya and Singapore fell under Japanese occupation when the British & Empire forces capitulated in 1942. Few today understand that the British and Empire forces' surrender did spare the local population further aerial bombing & artillery barrages, and thus avoided a heavier toll on the local population then would have been.

Located near the Northern tip of the Singapore, the War Memorial Sits atop a small hill, where on the summit, one can see the Sultan Ibrahim Building, and imposing Mogul style structure from across the Causeway in Malaysia. The park is peaceful, exuding an air of dignity and quiet splendor befitting the resting place of so many men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice.

From the entrance gate, there is a small car park that leads up the gentle hill and the memorial itself. At the base of the Memorial structure, one can access the registry of names of those laid to rest here at the memorial. Its amazing to see not only the many different branches of service and vocational units that participated in the short but brutal campaign here, but also the many nationalities who were actually involved. I for one did not realize until my visit that so many people from around the world actually took part in the defense of this Island and the Malay Peninsula.

Every year, commemoration ceremonies are held in honor the memories of the dead, by the ANZAC forces, as well as the Singapore Armed Forces. I once drove by, just as the then newly weds Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were reaching this memorial to pay their respects.

Tips:
Come early and before 8am. As the humidity is ferocious when the sun rises, aside from the personal discomfort, the humidity can also affect your camera lenses if you exit from a well air conditioned transport.

I am sure that most coming to visit will be dressed appropriately for the site, its important to wear light and comfortable clothes to avoid heat and humidity.

Accessibility to the site is relatively easy, as there is an MRT (Kranji Station) near by; however, if you take a cab to the memorial, you will have to walk out to the main road past the car park to hail down a cab or bus (at the bus stop) for your return journey. Kranji Station and the War Memorial is about 45mins to 1hour by MRT into town (Orchard Station and other points south) on the North-South Line, so it is quite a trek out- the good thing is that you don't need to change lines to get there.

You may wish to combine an outing here with a visit to the Singapore Zoo. For a more interesting experience, visit the War Memorial at 5pm, plan for 45mins to take in the sights, and photos, then take a taxi or bus to the Singapore Zoo to enjoy the world renown Night Safari. The advantage of this combination is that humidity in the late afternoon is lower, and you can experience a unique attraction in relative proximity to each other. Another combination would be the War Memorial and the Singapore Turf Club (visitors need to be 18 years old and above)

Bring your own food and water. There is no food & beverage outlet at the war Memorial, and no vending machines. I would strongly recommend that you bring your own bottled water.

This attraction is a worthwhile visiting if you have time and an interest in the past, for related sites, you may also wish to visit the Changi Prison Chapel or the Fort Canning Park Battle Box."
,,Very Moving,4.0,,The simplicity and the care to maintain this facility makes all of the difference when visiting something of this nature. It is a powerful look at such a wide variety of names and nationalities as you walk past the headstones. Very beautifully maintained with flowers or small bushes in front of each headstone.
,,Public transport is fine,5.0,,"I've just finished reading about Fabian Ware who was largely responsible for setting up the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, so felt Kranji was worth a visit

It's a lovely, peaceful place, immaculately maintained (as it should be). I don't have a personal connection, but it's interesting to see the sheer number of different services and regiments with men who fell in this region - Singaporeans and Malay, of course, as well as Aussies and Kiwis, Indians and Gurkhas, but also Gordon Highlanders, Argyles - the long and sad list goes on. Not to mention those with no name

But, you know all that - the real reason for the review was to explain how to get there. It's easy by MRT - take the red (North South) line to Kranji. It's a fair way out - it takes nearly an hour from Dhoby Ghaut. Then it's about a 15 minute walk. Out of the station turn left onto the main Woodlands Road - it's a dual carriageway but there's a footpath all the way. Keep going (the huge Singapore Turf Club is on your left) to the big, scary looking junction. You need to go straight across here - using a combination of zebra crossings and red-man traffic lights (in the UK we call them pelican crossings) then carry on walking a short distance (under the flyover). There's then a small road on your left (can't miss it, there's a brown road sign) - go up there and you've arrived

It's a peaceful place, views of Malaysia, and worth a visit"
,,Wow who knew,5.0,,I never had any idea about how Singapore played a part in such a sad situation .excellent museum it educates you on history you may not know about prior to our next stop JAPAN it made us think
,,A beautiful memorial to those that died,5.0,,"This is a peaceful place and everything is well kept. It is a memorial to all those that died regardless of religion. You can walk up to the top and there are also great views from here. That said, it's a place where you can spend time:it's a very calm and moving place. Rest in Peace for all those that gave up their lives."
,,Worth the effort,5.0,,My grandfather is buried here so I have a personal reason to visit. Like the hundreds of war cemetries around the world this is well managed and a credit to those involved. Thank you RIP
,,Moving,5.0,,"I visited this Memorial during part of a tour called The Original Singapore Walks. This tour was called Through Fog & Fire - The Battle for Singapore, 1942. This Memorial was absolutely wonderful and kept in pristine condition. Set up on a slight hill, once at the top of War Memorial you had some nice views as well. I would recommend going with a tour to this Memorial as there are so many stories explanations that would be lost if you were on your own."
,,Make an the effort,5.0,,Easy and interesting to get to via public transport with a bit of effort. It was great to have an opportunity to honour and reflect on those those who lost their lives. Beautifully maintained.
,,An emotional experience,5.0,,"The care and attention that is given to this, and other, Commonwealth cemetries is incredible. Just stand up the hill by the memorial wall and look over the beautifully laid out graves just makes you appreciate the sacrifice that was made by so many people in the last War, Very thought provoking......."
,,Somber Memorial,5.0,,"This memorial to all those who gave their lives in the defence of Singapore is inspiring. Superbly kept it is a tribute to both those for whom it is their last resting place and the staff who tend it so efficiently. Well laid out and easy to navigate around,"
,,Humbling experience,5.0,,"I found this a very humbling and moving experience, it is well worth a couple of hours of any Briton's time to come and pay your respects. Tip if, travelling by taxi tell the driver you want ""the World War 11 memorial"" they know it better that way"
,,All should go and pay their respects,5.0,,Having read a book on the war at sea it was moving to see some of the vessels crew mentioned. Quite and tranquil place which is well maintained with a lovely monument to all the forces and people who saved Singapore.
,,A Must Visit for History Buffs,5.0,,"This is a really stunning location and superb memorial very well maintained by the War Graves Commission. I found it especially important because those buried here represent such diverse origins--Malay, Indian, Muslim, Christian, Jewish, British, Australian, Dutch, Kiwi, etc. It is really the British equivalent of the US Cemetery in Manila that I recently visited, but smaller. The Sanskrit and Arabic texts on the headstones, the many unknowns buried there, and the headstones that read ""Buried near this location"" add to the solemnity. It's a short walk from the Kranji MRT station and a very peaceful, quiet place in Singapore. If you're up north or taking the Red Line in a loop around the island, then it's definitely worth the two hours to walk there, tour, and return."
,,Beautiful and Moving,5.0,,"My grandfather, who was part of the AIF 2/19 is buried here, so we wanted to bring my 9 year old daughter to visit on this trip to give her some perspective of the horrors of war - & to 'meet' her great grandfather.

The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, & all the volunteers who maintain this sacred place are to be congratulated. It is a beautiful & poignant memorial & a wonderful place for reflection. It was even more poignant for us this time as my 101 year old grandmother recently passed, & she had always wanted some of her ashes to be brought to Kranji to be scattered on his grave. That's for another trip - but at least this time we let him know that she on her way.

It's easy to get there. We travelled from Clarke Quay on the MRT, one stop to Dhoby Ghaut & then 40 minutes on the NE line to Kranji MRT. From the Kranji MRT exit out gate C, turn left and walk to the traffic lights (about 500m). Then go through the lights (staying on the left hand side of the road) & you should see a big brown sign pointing you up the hill. It's only about 5 minutes walk from there. Take water, so you can rehydrate & soak up the solitude & environment."
,,Sombre and peaceful place...,4.0,,"Maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the cemetery ground is very well kept (waved at the gardener a bit). We spent time walking through rows of grave-stones, many un-named. :( Felt for them…

Despite being right next to the final resting place of Singapore's first two presidents, I am not sure if many young Singaporeans even know about this place. I didn't see any Asians but me and the gardener. In fact, I probably wouldn't visit if not for my man. His father fought for Britain during WWII, and thankfully survived. He wanted to pay a little respect so I went along. We packed a small flask of tea, sat down on one of the shaded benches and looked over the grounds as a cool breeze swept through in the sun. Sombre, but peaceful…

I think if you have more time (than those SQ stopovers) to spend in Singapore, do have a look at this place. I would say it is worth a visit. However be prepared that:-

(1) It gets scorching HOT. Pack a brolly, sunglasses, drinking water and a flannel for mopping sweat.
(2) It involves long and tedious journey of switching buses from downtown. The war memorial is also way off any touristy spots and there's close to no chance getting a taxi BACK. You'll need to first learn how ""bus your way"" there and back."
,,A truly beautiful and inspirational place.,5.0,,"l love Singapore having first visited in 1961, subsequently the RAF were kind enough to station me there for 2 years in the late 1960's.
My first visit to Kranji War Memorial was in 1968 and on this occasion I was impressed by the air of serene tranquility as much as the beauty of the garden.
In those days there was often a troupe of monkeys sharing the grounds with you but there were no birds. Local myth said that birds avoided the gardens out of respect for the fallen so that they might truly rest in peace.

Over the past ten years I have visited Singapore and Kranji on three further occasions and am always struck by the stark beauty of the white headstones lined up across the rising ground with military precision. At the top of the rise is the main memorial carved with the names of thousands of people, many of whom were local volunteers hastily formed in to small defense units. Many races and religions lie together here and whilst it is, just another cemetary, it does illustrate very poignantly the futility of war.

On one of my visits I saw two buses parked at the gates, it turned out to be young students from a Singaporean school participating in a visit organised by their History teacher and it was touching to read some of the handwritten messages left with a simple wreath by them.

I would urge anyone visiting Singapore to visit, just take the MRT to Kranji and then a five minute walk will bring you to the gates. It is a beautiful place which will remain in your memory for ever."
,,"A ""must visit""",5.0,,This memorial garden is a credit to those who care for it. Only thing missing was toilet facilities. We spoke with the manager of staff on our visit and we were very impressed with all information provided.
,,time to reflect,5.0,,nice to spend an hour or so to reflect on once what was a different world we lived in Thank you to the fallen Beautifully kept
,,A must-visit - with a good local guide.,5.0,,"One of the famous memorial of those who passed away during World War 2. If you're interested in history and World War 2 like me, it's a must-visit spot; but a good local guide is highly recommended as it wouldn't be meaningful at all without the stories behind."
,,A pice of history,5.0,,"A visit here can be combined with your visit to the zoo. For those who respect history, it should be included in your tour of Singapore. Not a lot to see but the experience is special."
,,Excellent place to visit,5.0,,The Kranji war memorial is a good place to visit to get a sense of the history and the importance of remembering those who gave their lives to fight for us in WW2. Best to visit with a guide as they will give you lots of stories and information. We went with the original singapore walks and they were great.
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,"This would have to be the 5 th visit I have made to Singapore for holidays but the first time we have visited this memorial. I took my son as he is learning a lot about the ANZAC this year at school and both of us were very moved by this memorial. It is an easy trip on the MRT to Kranji station and then a 5 min walk.
It really makes you think about the sacrifice that so many countries including Australia , made in the 2nd world war."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Easy to get to by MRT and then a 10 minute walk. Very peaceful and well maintained. Was only visitor at time. Talk the time to walk around the gravestones and reflect. If you are doing a bit of a ""war tour"" this place is a definite."
,,Time to reflect....,5.0,,"We visited the Kranji War Memorial as part of the 'End of the Empire' tour conducted by a local tour company. The tour also took in Labrador Park and Fort Canning. We were pleased we did the formal tour as the guide was able to point out significant items of interest which we may have otherwise missed even though our knowledge of the war in Singapore was fairly extensive.
The grounds are well maintained and the atmosphere is one of quiet reflection and appreciation of those who fought and died in battle."
,,VERY IMPRESSIVE,5.0,,"A bit difficult to get to and back from City Center, but I relied on my GPS for directions. there are very many on/off ramps to navigate, so sticking to the centre lane would be a good idea, as traffic is heavy in certain sections, and the locals move FAST. The route took us through Woodlands and back via Changi Airport, so a good part of the Island was visited at the same time. I found the whole area kept in immaculate condition, and several gardeners were tending to the lawns during our visit. I would suggest you keep at least an hour for an unhurried walkabout, and read the history behind it all. We were most depressed at reading the ages of those who gave their lives in this battle, all young men in their prime of life. Very sad indeed, but they are well remembered judging by the number of near-fresh flowers and poppies left there by recent visitors."
,,Beautifully maintained and so serene and peaceful.,5.0,,"The last time I visited was over 15 years ago. I didn't have a deep impression of it then.

This time we were showing friends from overseas around and they enquired about this memorial.

We arrived at around 430pm on a weekday so we were the only visitors around.

Immaculately maintained and informative, this memorial evokes a feeling of poignant and lingering respect tinged with grief at the lives lost in defence of our country."
,,A place to reflect,3.0,,This war memorial gives all Australians a sense of pride and understanding of our involvement in the war. I would suggest that you go there either at dawn or sunset to get the best atmosphere of this memorial. Young people should consider a trip here to get a sense that Gallipoli and other well known battles are not all our own men and women were involvred in
,,Kranji War memories,4.0,,North part of the Singapore Island. 35 minutes drive and closer to border of Malaysia. Old Singapore memories at Japanese war time. 1943.
,,Confronting,4.0,,"Beautifully maintained,quite a journey to get there but we'll worth a visit to pay respects about one hour from orchard rd by MRT"
,,"Thought provoking, beautifully peaceful corner of a very busy island",5.0,,"Like the review by ""Streaky2"" I too was a forces child in Singapore during the early sixties and remembered Kranji from those days, revisiting with my husband brought back many special memories of those days. Perhaps as ""Army Brats"" this place means so much more to us than the usual run of the mill tourist, this probably explains why some people have posted negative reviews............this is a War Memorial, not a theme park or a ""tourist attraction"" it doesn't sell itself as either of those it is what it says on the label a WAR MEMORIAL so please don't expect toilets, fast food outlets, gift shops and tour guides, expect to find a very well kept, serene, thought provoking and dignified place to remember what the few did for so many of us!"
,,Pay your Respects,5.0,,"As a forces child I spent over 2 years in Singapore in the early 1960's. I visited the War Memorial as part of a Sunday school trip and since then I have been determined to return. My husband and I have been back to Singapore a number of times without managing to visit, but on the last occasion we did visit Kranji and I must say, I was not disappointed. It is still a wonderful place. Those childhood memories came flooding back. Inside the War Memorial they have books , so you can look for relatives, they give you the row and grave number, which is helpful if you are on a tight schedule. We travelled by mrt and bus, but there was a bit of a walk from the bus-stop.The graves were clean, tidy and really well maintained. We spent well over three hours taking photographs and sitting for a while enjoying the ambience of the place. I think everyone should try to include this in their itinerary as it allows us time to reflect on how destructive war can be. All those lives lost, not just the fighting forces, but all the civilians, no matter what their occupation. It was sad to see all the graves and the ages of the men and women that were killed, some only just in their teens God Bless them all. Would we go back again yes, if only to remember what they sacrificed their lives for. As mentioned in other reviews you do need to take drinks, hats and suntan lotion, as it is hot, and not a lot of shelter."
,,"round island trip, Kranji",3.0,,"Kranji is a very beautifully maintained war memorial and gives an insight in to the terrible losses suffered by the Commonwealth soldiers. So many people who died in what must have been a military debacle. There are mixed reports, but none of them good and obviously many of the survivors ended up in terrible pow camps. chilling"
,,"Peaceful, solemn,",5.0,,"A visit to the Kranji War Memorial isn't in the must-do list of attractions in Singapore for a first-timer; but I would strongly recommend a visit here for a repeat visitor.
The site seems removed from the fast-moving pace of life that Singapore is associated with; time stands still and one cannot help but introspect on the savageries of war.
It is a bit difficult to find as it is off the main road, and it is very easy to miss the stop if you aren't careful. You can also walk from the MRT (10-15 mins)
The Commonwealth War Graves Commission has done an admirable job maintaining the sanctity of the site. I've spent nearly 4 years in Singapore, and this would definitely rank foremost among the places I would want to visit again"
,,Kranji war memorial,4.0,,In memory of the soldiers died in world war II and remind everyone lest we forget. The memorial is laid with flowers and wreaths for memorable sake
,,Very Sobering,5.0,,Beautifully kept & tranquil. A testament to the sheer waste of lives caused by war. It's a pity we can't learn from the past.
,,Serenity and Peace.,4.0,,"This year had my 18th visit to Kranji War Cemetery, [ have relations interned there] and often sit by myself and pay my own tribute to all the young lives lost in war. I would like to advise visitors to Kranji to make sure they use the toilets in Kranji MRT station before you go there and make sure you have toilet paper/tissues as there is only 1 toilet roll there and located outside the toilet and nearly always empty but there a tissue machine next to it for your convenience. [20 cents] Make sure you have a bottle of water, gets hot there and is all up hill walk from the main road. Don't try and short cut from the Station through the race track, all gates locked and a long walk back to the Station to start again.[ done it ]"
,,Moved,5.0,,"Visited the Kranji War Memorial (Singapore War Memorial) in such of my partner's great uncle who died whilst working on the Death Railway in Thailand. The cemetery here is the burial place for many of the soldiers who lost their lives during the Japanese invasion or subsequent captivity. We did arrive expecting to find a grave but only found his name inscribe on the memorial at the top of the site.

The site itself is beautiful and well maintained, from its position on the hill you can see the sea and I believe over into Malaysia. It really is a special place and great for contemplation of times gone past.

If you are getting the MRT here it takes around 30-40 from the city centre. From the station turn left and follow the road up to the traffic lights. Here you head straight over and after about 30 meters is a road on the left - you should see a large brown sign that will inform you. It is a long way to go if you are not on a tour but it is worth it if you have a connection."
,,Lovely,5.0,,"We visited the Memorial as part of a guided tour, and our host was fantastic, she was really swept up on her History and it is such a well kept place the Commonwealth War Graves Commission are really doing such an amazing job at looking after this place. Lots of History to be looked into."
,,Moving,5.0,,A moving place that is serene and the perfect setting for commemorating all those that fell defending us from the Japanese in World War 2 and later conflicts.
,,Very moving,5.0,,This war memorial is an amazing tribute to the men and woman who gave their lives during world war 2. The grounds are beautifully kept and the whole experience was very moving.
,,Quite a walk but a great adventure,3.0,,"There are several routes to take, each one offers a little different experience. To experience the rainforest you should walk all of them. It will take you about a day if you do it slowely but the HSBC skywalk, the monkeys and snakes, the colours of the flowers and trees are worth it."
,,If you're interested in WW2 sites,4.0,,"Kranji War Memorial is an interesting site if you are interested in WW2 sites. A quiet and peaceful park with city views worth a half hour of pondering. Rows and rows of the fallen make you think of the great sacrifice they made. A sobering moment is reading the rows and rows of names of those that did not return and have not been found.

A 10 minute walk from Kranji MRT. You might find it difficult to get back to the main tourist areas by taxi. I think they might not get a fare back to the outer areas."
,,respect for the fallen,3.0,,"just a burial ground that is a place for respecting the fallen, the brave soldiers that defended SG during ww2."
,,overpowering,5.0,,Well worth the visit gardens are tended by graves commission and are in a superb spot for a tranquil half hour if you are searching for a particular grave
,,Must see for ex-pats,5.0,,"I'd suggest walking from Kranji MRT. It is only a 10 minute stroll. The cemetery is very serene. It is the quietest place I has experienced in Singapore. It is very moving and very well maintained. The view from the top of the hill of JB is also interesting. I'm not sure I'd venture out here as a tourist during a short trip. However, Commonwealth citizens will both enjoy and be moved by a visit."
,,Good historical site,5.0,,"God, what a huge waste of lives. If only we could learn from the past and create a safe and happy world. So many young men and women who sacrificed their lives for us."
,,"Hot hot hot, weather",2.0,,"Nothing much to see other than the quietness and some photo taking. Bring your brollies, in case it rains or if it's too not..."
,,wjd,5.0,,a very move ing time a must to see all the material and pictures made me very sad but I am so glad I went there
,,Sobering,5.0,,"Give yourself time to reflect with these heroes. This memorial sits on top of a hill overlooking Singapore which is very befitting, it's only a short walk from the MRT, no signage though, just keep walking and asking and you'll find it. It's a must see if your interest in military history."
,,Beautifully maintained,4.0,,A dignified and beautiful memorial which includes a wall for men whose bodies were never found. Lovely plantings complement the well laid out graves. The climb to the top though not very long can be demanding in hot weather.
,,A poignant memorial,5.0,,"This is a wonderfully cared for gardens, cemetery and memorial to the fallen in Singapore and the region; those who gave their lives in service of their country. And the walls carved with the names of over 20,000 whose bodies were never found is a chilling reminder of the cost of war."
,,Sobering but so beautiful and poignant,5.0,,This is a quiet gem in Singapore. Need a car to get there and there is parking right in front. Parking area is much smaller than I expected but the beauty of this place too is that it's away from the hustle and bustle of the city. It's on a hillside and on beautifully kept grounds. Every one should visit once to remember that the war was not that long ago and how many people from different countries came and gave their life here. A trip in the morning or early evening may be better as afternoon sun can be very hot and limit your time or enjoyment there.
,,We must never forget,5.0,,This war memorial is set on a hillside and is just beautiful. It is so well maintained and is quite a reverent place. All those young men of all nationalities are at peace in this setting. Awesome!!!
,,A quiet place for reflection,4.0,,"This is, as expected at all CWGC sites, well maintained and dignified. Most of those remembered here died far from their familiar homelands and the poignancy is enhanced by its semi-rural setting and distance from the city - we visited as part of a Round Island Tour, though there is a nearby train station. [Note: there are no onsite toilet facilities.]"
,,"tranquil, somber, peaceful",5.0,,Kranji War Memorial is best accessed by car and there's adequate free parking at the entrance. I brought my young children there to show them the consequences of wall and the silent heroes who fell to protect Singapore. The memorial covers a large expense of land and allows for quiet contemplation as you stroll along the well maintained lawn and grounds
,,God for saken place!,1.0,,A walk from MRT. No toilet and no amenities. Better buy some refreshments from kranji mrt (nearest mrt).
,,Touching,5.0,,Took a group of kids to show them what the War was about. Very moving experience and we were all touched by the moment
,,A moving experiance,5.0,,"I visited this beautiful place as part of the round island tour and it was the best part of the tour, a lasting memorial to the valor of so many young men and a testament to the cruelty of mankind."
,,A must do,5.0,,So sad to see row after row of names and so many young ages from many nations. Very well maintained a must do if you are in Singapore.
,,Peace,5.0,,"I went the Kranji War Memorial after I visited the Memories at the Old Ford Factory so the hardships suffered by Singaporeans and the Allied Forces during the occupation were fresh in my mind. It's easy to be appalled and angry at man's cruelty to man, but the war memorial inspires peace. As another reviewer wrote, just stand quietly and take it in.

Although a ways out of town, the war memorial is easy to get to. Take a train to Kranji station and take a bus going towards the City (I caught the 170) and get off at the second stop. It's a 10-15 minute walk (I'm slow) up the drive to grounds of the memorial."
,,Memory of the World War 2,5.0,,Is a memory of history that World War 2 was created and people of hero who protect people. Quite sad but i salute them for been hero of this country. Thank you
,,Sad yet inspiring,5.0,,This beautiful cemetery is quite a long way out of town so I expect that most people like us visit here as part of an organised tour group. We were on the Original Singapore Walks 1942 Battlefields Tour and one of the advantages of being on such a tour is that the tour leader will provide specific information about some of the grave sites. We visited the graves of the 12 Australian and British servicemen who were on the second Z Force mission sent to sink Japanese shipping in Singapore harbour in late 1944. Unfortunately the mission was not a success and these men were killed in action or captured and executed by the Japanese and are buried here. Interestingly the last two were only buried here a few short years back when after a long search their remains were found on a nearby island and brought to Kranji to lay at rest with their mates. Its quite a story.
,,Just stand quietly and take it in.,5.0,,"You can feel it as you walk up the drive. We all remember our history lessons, movies etc. but to visit this War Memorial brings a sense of enormity to the conflict for Singapore."
,,Remembrance,5.0,,A must see for service related people who respect the sacrifice made by the thousands of deceased Allied service personnel interred in the beautifully kept grounds - a sombre place of peace
,,Another must see!,5.0,,"It is quite a walk from the MRT station but worth it when you get there. There is no admission charge and please note that there are no toilets or anywhere to get a drink or refreshments at all.
There is a good cafe and facilities at the MRT station.
The grounds of the War Memorial are beautifully kept, row after row of pure white headstones. It is very sad to see but very interesting also."
,,We shall remember them,5.0,,"My partner Sarah and I are both former British military (Parachute Regiment & QARANC). We went to Kranji especially to pay our respects to the fallen and lay rememberance crosses. I was very surprised to find eleven Para Regt graves and two SAS. I have taken photo's of the graves to pass onto my Regt museum and Regt Journal, also to pass onto any of their living relatives. I would highly recommend a visit. These men & women gave up so much, that to go there and spend an hour or two out of our lives just walking around is the least we can do."
,,Worth the look,5.0,,I went here for stroll after going to high tea at Raffles. At first glance it can be very overwhelming. If you are into the history of the war. However if you sit on the benches around the memorial it becomes nice and peaceful.
,,Remembering,5.0,,This is a place that all people should visit and show their respects. It is a well cared for place and very peaceful but at the same time very sad.
,,Moving experience.,4.0,,A little out of the way but we managed to get there using the MRT. After a short walk from the station we made our way into the memorial. It was quite a moving experience walking around the headstones of those who had lost there lives during the war.
,,ANZAC Day Memorial,5.0,,"A few years ago, we visited the War Memorial as part of a Singapore Original Walking Tour bus trip. This time, we wanted to share the experience of ANZAC Day Dawn Service with others who were there to remember the fallen.

The Memorial was exceptionally beautiful and a dignified reminder of those who died in battle. The sadness of the ""Unknown Soldier"" headstones, the horror of the numbers who lay there, and their ages.

The Commonwealth War Commission is to be congratulated for this truly touching memorial."
,,Honouring,5.0,,Worth a visiting especially as an Asutralian and having a grandfather spend many months in Singapore as a POW.
,,A revisit after 36 years.,5.0,,An off the trail War Cemetery and Memorial for Singapore's war dead. The facility is immaculately cared for and a special place given the World's renewed interest in the commemoration of war deceased. We visited for the sake of Australians who laid down their lives and were invited to join a large group of school children who were learning about recognising war sacrifices. The short presentation which featured a bugler playing the last post and reveille was moving and heart felt. We were pleased to be involved and made our visit even more meaningful. Can highly recommend this as a must do.
,,A place for thought,5.0,,So many innocent young men died in this war. This serves as a reminder of the futility of war. So many die irrespective on which side they were. The memorial is well kept and a very interesting place to visit.
,,Great place to learn about the Japanese Occupation,4.0,,"If you are a history buff, I would highly recommend you visit the Kranji War Memorial to learn more about the Japanese Occupation and how Singapore suffered under their rule."
,,moving experience,5.0,,Visited here after the Old Ford Factory. Simple bus journey from there (170). A place of simple peace & a time for reflection. Situated on a hill with views to Johor Bahru over the strait. Worth the effort. Those who died defending the peninsula deserve our thoughts & thanks.
,,Reflect in pristine surrounds,5.0,,"Another excellently maintained Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery that combines the horror of permanancy of war with the beauty of perfectly maintained gardens, with a city view backdrop.
Easy to get to after exiting the Kranji station, head toward where the busses are, turn left and walk along that road, you will see signs to a racetrack. Cross the very busy main road and continue and the narrow road to the Cemetery is well signed. The walk takes about 10 minutes, I had an umbrella for sun protection as sunscreen could not compete with the rays.
Make sure you sign the visitors book, kept in the compartment at the entrance with a cross and twist handle on it. It is visitors that will keep these important places going.
I placed poppies on the graves and memorial wall of my father's Unit (2/10 Ordnance Workshop - Australian Army) members, let me know if there are any still there. Thanks."
,,Anzac Day 2014,5.0,,Attended the dawn service here 2014. If you are in Singapore on this day you would be wasted if you didn't see this service. Very well presented by the military services involved here in WW11 and a great reminder of what happened to so many. Also did a tour of the cemetery conducted by the Changi museum people and it was brilliant as well. A must for all ages...
,,Reunited,5.0,,My wives father is buried in Kranji. Her mother died a couple of years ago and we took her ashes to be interned with her husband. The staff at Kranji could not do enough. We were treated with absolute respect. The cemetery itself is an area of tranquillity. It is maintained to the highest standard and is credit to the staff and the CWGC IN GENERAL
,,A time to reflect and pay homage to those who gave their life.,4.0,,"Having visited a number of CWGC cemeteries in different parts of the world this particular one was
in the top category being very well kept. This being difficult as the graves are on an incline.

Noted a number of Gordon Highlander Graves and took photographs with the intention of passing the details onto he Museum in Aberdeen.

Well done the Gardeners in keeping the graves so immaculate in such a climate."
,,Worth a look and reminder of the past,4.0,,"So many graves mark this hill, including unnamed ones.. It has a very nice feel to the place with a book at the front so you can find who is buried there.. This is very close to the zoo.. If going to the zoo by taxi I would drop in here on the way to the zoo.. You only need 15-20mins there.. About a $20 taxi fare from city.. Though ask your taxi to wait as no taxis enter the grounds..."
,,A slice of history,4.0,,"Its a great place to go to enlighten yourself with the history of Singapore and the sacrifices made by people of many nations.
signage getting there is a little poor and the buses are usually fairly full (domestic lines going past), but on a good day its a 10min walk from the railway station."
,,Geo caching here,3.0,,An interesting place especially if you are interested in geo caching this is listed as an earth cache.
,,Sombre experience,5.0,,"I was stationed here as a member of the NZDF and have returned after nearly 30 odd years, Kranji War Memorial and the WWII tour was a great reminder of what our forefathers faced and the challenges of war, I really do encourage others and the young to visit these places to see the true cost of War "" the true cost of freedom is with those who chose to defend it"" ""we will remember them""!"
,,An essential stop for anyone with a military history.,5.0,,An exceedingly well kept cemetery that is well laid out and does justice as a memorial to the Commonwealth and Allied war dead. A brilliant dawn service is conducted every ANZAC Day.
,,A somber place to see,5.0,,It reminds us of what happened here and the valiant fight of the residents. A good place to go to complete a trip to Singapore.
,,Transquilt place for the dead,3.0,,"It is located at the far part of N W Island, facing the Johor Strait and overlook the Johor Bahru waterfront. The rest place for dead mostly dead from the WWII. The cemetery is keeling nice and arranged in order and tidy. It is a good for clearing your mind."
,,Touching,4.0,,Everything is well maintained and the history behind the place is really cool. It is humbling to see all the fallen and a great place to pay your respects.
,,well tended,5.0,,A well tended and laid out memorial.day we visited staff were cleaning and tidying.has a memorial book for relatives of the deceased Well worth a visit
,,A stark reminder,4.0,,"My visit to Kranji War Memorial was a stark reminder of horrors of a bygone age. I had always wanted to visit the memorial, as in all my previous visits to Singapore I had not gotten around to it. This time, however, I made it my first stop.

The admission is completely free, but be warned, there are no toilets or food outlets anywhere near the cemetery, should you be needing them. In fact, even to catch a taxi from Kranji War Memorial is difficult, you should be advised to walk back to Kranji MRT station (5 minutes walk but across a busy road with pedestrian crossing) and hail one from there.

The cemetery itself is immaculately preserved, as you would expect. I saw groups of Indian gardeners attending to the foliage as I was walking around. It is not possible to look at every gravestone, but a nice, slow, sombre walk around is all that is needed to remind yourself of the horrors that have occurred in previous generations, and could still be occurring had these brave men and women not given up their lives for us.

The rear of the cemetery is an undercover memorial, which can give you a little respite from the sun or rain, but mainly the cemetery is all about walking around the grass and having a little look the various names and messages on some of the gravestones. Photos are permitted, but it shouldn't be your main priority."
,,Honour the fallen,5.0,,"I visit kanji whenever I can when I'm in Singapore to pay my respects to a great uncle who is named on the wall of remembrance.

I would never call this an attraction, more a serious place for reflection.

It is solemn, it is peaceful and if you are from Australia... It is a must."
,,Nostalgic Perspective,4.0,,"I visited the memorial prior to a visit to Changi Museum, but after visiting the old Ford Works. The memorial is a solemn place that is beautifully maintained and provides an atmosphere that permits a reflection on what happened to the many foreign servicemen buried there."
,,A very moving experience,5.0,,"While this is not what can be called a tourist attraction, it is a must do when visiting Singapore. So many young men and women are buried here and the cemetery is well cared for and well respected by the people of Singapore. When we were there about 100 national servicemen attended a brief rememberance ceremony. I was later told that this is something all Singapore's national service personnel do during their training. It was very moving."
,,Very moving,5.0,,"The memorial is immaculate - as we have come to expect from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

It was very moving to walk around the well kept lawn and listen to the hum of the traffic in the distance... but still feel the quiet of the graveyard.

A must do for anyone interested in the history of Singapore.

RIP"
,,Beautifully maintained memorial & cemetery,5.0,,"My Uncle is commemorated here ...hence our visit It is a beautiful serene place, well kept with accurate helpful records. lest we forget"
,,Pulls on your heartstrings,5.0,,We chose a quiet time to visit this rather sad but gorgeous setting to quietly salute all those who lost their lives defending the area....During a week day seems to be the best time. Easy to get there via public transport or private car. Do take water with you tho.....Take your time and absorb the atmosphere.Very definately a good place for a respectful history lesson.
,,Lest we forget...,5.0,,"This is a solemn and fitting memorial to those who died whilst defending Singapore from the impending Japanese invasion. It is high on the hill overlooking the surrounding landscape, dotted with grave stones and memorial walls. Interesting information provided throughout."
,,Lesson for children,4.0,,Visited after reading all the comments here. Guided the children to google the history of the war. A learning & sobering experience.
,,One of the worlds 'must see' military cemeteries for anyone with an interest in WW2,5.0,,"Beautiful location, very well organised, good facilities. Very busy at peak times, and during public holidays."
,,Moving experience,4.0,,"A large and well kept site. It can be a moving experience, especially is you have relatives who were involved"
,,Peaceful,5.0,,"Always a great ANZAC Day dawn service, have been coming for years and will keep coming back as long as we are in Singapore"
,,Just Remember,3.0,,"I really do not think it is appropriate to ""rate"" military cemeteries so, just to complete the entry, I have given average.

The Kranji military cemetery is quiet, well-tended and, as it should be, conducive to reflection. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission does a magnificent job.

So many lives needlessly wasted, so many unlived futures. We will not forget them......

Also remember the many thousands of civilians in Singapore and throughout the Far East also murdered by the Japanese."
,,Worth the trip.,4.0,,Well kept memorial. Worth visiting particularly if you have any connection. Not well signposted from the MRT so take a map or get directions before you set off.
,,a must if in the area,5.0,,"Kranji should be on any person's list of things to see, especially if there is any historical connection at all. The service held each April 25th, marking ANZAC day, is a truly moving experience."
,,A dignified and peaceful place,5.0,,"A dignified and peaceful place, well worthy of those whose memory it honours. It is good to see that as with all such cemeteries the maintenance is first class. You will be moved by your visit."
,,A very moving experience,5.0,,"Set quietly on a hill overlooking the constantly bustling city of Singapore , this striking memorial commemorates the lives lost by members across all the armed forces and reminds us all of the terrible privations they suffered at the hands of their fellow men. The gardens are carefully tended and each grave has a flowering shrub at its head , a detail that typifies the care and respect accorded to each of the fallen. The memorial itself is designed to represent the army, navy and air forces and the columns list all the names of those whose mortal remains lie here. It was emotional and humbling to identify the name of a close friend's uncle, who is far away from his native Devon, but not forgotten. It was heartening to see coaches of schoolchildren arriving as we left. They will be the future guardians of this special place and it needs to inspire them to take care of the memories - we hope that it does."
,,Stand Still The Front Rank,5.0,,"As usual the Cemetry was immaculate. It was great to see two groups of school kids doing projects and getting a tour and lecture. I've not seen this before and it's encouraging to see the Singapore Government doing this.
Very unusual headstones and also a small section of dependents graves.
This Cemetry is also quite unique in that there are graves as new as the 70's.
Easy to find and an ho our to pay our respects.
CWGC keep up the good work."
,,A place of rememberance,4.0,,"Part of a day tour this was certainly a place to remember those that fought for us. Beautifully kept grounds and very tranquil. For anyone wanting to look up names of those they knew fought and died there, you will find books with those names from the various forces up at the monument."
,,To remember the dead,3.0,,A site to remember the dead during the Japanese Occupation. The place is kept quite clean and beautiful and kinda sad when you visit but apart from the tombs there's nothing much to see and do
,,Thought Provoking,5.0,,The visit was part of a Singapore City tour (well worth taking). The war memorial is a replica of the memorial in Washington DC and is surrounded by a large water feature. On the ceiling of the walkway are the badges of battalions that fought in the war. It was interesting to see them all and the memorial is actually quite breath taking.
,,We Will Not Forget Them,5.0,,"Like all ""Commonwealth War Graves Commission"" cemeteries, the Kranji War Memorial is no exception in being incredibly well maintained. It is beautifully tranquil and a wonderfully peaceful last resting place for those, mostly very young men who died horribly in the most un peaceful of circumstances. I strongly recommend a visit here to pay respects to those gallant souls who tragically died in the service of their country, in a struggle to try and make a better world and a struggle that sadly unbeknownst to them, did eventually overturn an evil tyranny. Andrew Bruce, Dumfries, Scotland, U.K."
,,A hidden memorial,4.0,,This is a wonderful memorial to the armed service personal who lost their lives in trying to protect Singapore. We used public transport (train) which is quite accessible once you know where to go. Directions need improvement from the station. Definitely worth the effort.
,,Kranji,5.0,,An ethereal reminder of what must never happen again. Well kept. thanks to those who keep this place for us.
,,24000 souls named and laid to rest,5.0,,"Wow I am never surprised when I have been able to visit a war graves / memorial at the work that goes into maintaining it to the highest of standards. The local people in conjunction with the War Greaves Commission i thank you for making the place where people can pay their respects to those who fell.
Theirs so many different countries respected in this cemetery the memorial for the Singapore people and those who served and died is moving. I have been able to visit Flanders Field in Belgium and now Sandakan and Kranji memorials and have found them to the highest of standards.
Anyone who has a relative their will find when you walk up and past he first large table stone two alcoves on the left is a small chamber holding all the names of the soldiers and a book to write your name and comment if any.

Getting their, take the green line (airport) to Kranji maybe 30+ minutes from town. Go outside and DONT TAKE THE BUS. It's about 500m to the entrance point past the race track and over the road. Large sign and walk up a long drive, you will than see the gates. From the station you can see the tallest spire."
,,A time to reflect,4.0,,The Kranji War Memorial is a very moving site. So many names. So many lives. Every Australian should visit this place.
,,Moving Experience,5.0,,"Kranji War Memorial is about a 20 min walk from the Kranji MRT Station. You can not help being moved by this place. It is very well looked after, and is a credit to the Commonwealth War Graves people. Many of the headstones are marked with the fallen soilders names, many are not. We bought poppies with us from Aust and my daughters layed these on some of the headstones. It is such a peaceful place and well worth the trip out to see. Don't forget to take plenty of water with you, can be very hot and there is not place to purchase it once you're there."
,,Kranji war memorial,5.0,,"We went to Kranji war memorial by MRT, it was a 45minute journey. We walked for @15 mins. The cemetery is very well kept. It's a very emotional place, we walked round the gravestones for about 2hours reading the epitaphs, noticing a lone poppy on some headstones. We signed the visitors book at the end of our visit, it's located in the archways at the entrance in a little cupboard. Well worth a visit."
,,Moving experience,5.0,,"You cannot help but be moved by this place. You can read about it, but nothing will prepare you for the feeling of being there among the headstones. People of all ages are moved to tears and the Commonwealth War Graves people keep it very well. I have visited it twice now and learn more each time.
Just be aware, as mentioned by other reviewers, there is no water available (thankfully no kitsch/kiosks) but also no toilets or other facilities that I saw. To prepare to spend any time there - and you should - ensure you have sufficient water, sunscreen, hat and have visited other facilities beforehand. We were also caught in a tropical downpour, so a brolly is useful too!"
,,Kranji War Memorial,5.0,,"I did not think I would be move emotionally when they mentioned that they were taking me to the Kranji War Memorial. My initial thought was OK. When I was walking around the location - it almost brought a tear to my eyes. This is where hundreds of British, Australian, New Zealanders, Indians etc fought and died in a last ditch effort to save Singapore from the Japanese. The whole cemetery is immaculately kept very neat and very clean. A must see when travelling to Singapore. They need to be remembered for theit valient effort"
,,A Peaceful Place,5.0,,"Really well kept grounds and a truly peaceful place to reflect and remember fallen soldiers.

The memorial is very short walk from the train station. Just remember to bring water because it can be very hot and there is no where to buy water once you leave the station (the station doesn't have much either)."
,,A sombre yet moving experience,5.0,,"The War Memorial is located at the Kranji Countryside, which you can easily reach by taking the North-South MRT Line (the red-coloured one), and stopping at Kranji Station. Just locate Exit C of Kranji Station where the bus-stop is. To help with the navigation, you should pass a Kopitiam food-court and a money-changer/currency-converter along the way to the exit. For those who wish to take a bus to the War Memorial, the bus services to look out for are 160, 178, 960 or 961. I know that service 170 takes you to there as well, but do note that there is actually another service called 170X that travels on an entirely different route. As such, I strongly advise tourists to stick to the 4 bus services mentioned above to avoid confusion or worse, getting lost. You should alight at the second stop from the MRT Station, or the stop after passing a sign that reads “Kranji Commonwealth War Cemetery” (I’m essentially referring to the same place, just that I’m giving readers various ways of locating the stop, whichever suits your preference). Follow the sign which will lead you along a narrow lane and straight to the War Memorial.

For those who prefer to walk to the Memorial instead, likewise, start-off from Exit C of Kranji MRT Station. Simply walk in the direction of the main traffic flow, passing the overhead bridge just outside the station; you should also pass the Singapore Turf Club before coming to a cross junction. At the cross junction, just head straight and follow along Woodlands Road as it curves slightly to the left. Continue on the path and you should see the same sign that reads “Kranji Commonwealth War Cemetery”. Enter that narrow lane and it will take you straight to Kranji War Memorial.

As you enter the grounds, you’ll find yourself transported to a very different part of Singapore. There are no skyscrapers, no shopping malls, no hawker centres; just rows and rows of grave stones and a towering war memorial. I used to learn in school that the War Memorial was designed to collectively represent the three branches of the military – the columns represent the columns in an Army contingent; the ceilings over the columns represent the wings of a plane and thus the Air Force; which the towering pillar-like structure in the middle represents the sail of the submarine and hence the Navy. The siting of the War Memorial was also significant because it was in the same area where the Japanese first invaded Singapore. In addition, you can also find the graves of individuals like Yusof Bin Ishak and Dr Benjamin Henry Sheares nearby – they were the first and second Presidents of Singapore.

Overall, I found my visit to the War Memorial a sombre yet moving one because it really puts into perspective how much we cannot take the peace we enjoy today for granted. I know it sounds corny and all, but I think you’ll understand when you visit a landscape such as this."
,,A Moment to Reflect,5.0,,"Accessible by MRT (Racecourse) and by bus.
The War Graves and the Memorial
are a reminder of decades of sacrifice during and after the Pacific War.
It is poignant that there are also graves here for servicemen and woman who died during the Emergency, Confrontation and some early deaths in Vietnam.
The setting is both sombre and beautiful.
Kranji presents a moment to reflect on a time when Singapore was not as peaceful as it is now and that some generations of Australians came to Malaya and stayed."
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"Well kept tranquil gardens, great place to pay respects and remember our fallen soldiers. So many ""unknown"" grave sites which is very sad. Short walk from MRT."
,,moving experience,5.0,,A nice tribute to the people who gave there lives and those that survived the camp. Had pictures made by the prisoners. Had small displays of things that were shared by people who spent time in the camps. They were very interesting.
,,Very moving,5.0,,Me and my partner came here and it's such an eye opener. So many rows of head stones and lots with unknown names. Very moving and worth seeing. Easy train ride then a 10min walk.
,,A Sobering Sight.,5.0,,"We made the trip to Kranji by train. It was our first visit to a war cemetery and it was a sobering experience. But the wall with 20,000 plus names of people that weren't found was equally overwhelming. It was a long trip but one that should be on the list."
,,Brave men who paid the ultimate price.,5.0,,We took the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit to Kranji station and then walked to the Kranji War memorial. It was a very hot day but I was proud to honor the soldiers who fought for Singapore from England and Australia and paid the ultimate price.I was born in England and have lived in Australia.Their sacrifices must never be forgotten.God bless them all.
,,Taking pictures for a friend,4.0,,Lovely setting and made you think about all those who lost their lives during the wars. Easy train ride from central Singapore then approx 10min walk from station.
,,well kept,5.0,,"Off the beaten track but only a short walk from Kranji station. Well worth a visit, extremely well maintained with computer on site for information"
,,A must see,4.0,,"The moment we arrived here to learn about the past history of Singapore on how this fallen soldiers sacrificed themselves make our heart move and think how lucky we all are today.
This is a beautiful and peaceful cemetery for the soldiers who died defending Singapore against the Japanese in WWII. The graves are very well maintained, the grounds are beautiful and peaceful.
It's always at places like this where you have to say a silent thank you to those that sacrificed for us to walk free.
The cemetery is very well kept so if you have time to spare or need a breather from the hustle of the city, it's definitely worth a visit."
,,Very Touching,5.0,,"As part of an organised tour we visited this memorial. There are row upon row of headstones honoring the fallen, it was very peaceful and tends to be a very moving experience. Well worth avisit."
,,Very moving,5.0,,"We came here with a tour group. The memorial is beautiful, the gardens are well maintained and it is all in very good condition. There is a book of names there so people can find relatives and friends. Each gravestone has there own flowers and shrubs growing, its nice because even if people cant visit their loved ones there are still flowers there. There are no toilet facilities there to use."
,,Well worth a look,5.0,,"We recently visited the war memorial and were really taken by it. It is maintained perfectly, and is very peaceful and inspiring. An easy train and bus trip from the cbd."
,,worth a look,4.0,,"my husband and i visited this memorial on the 21st november. we decided to catch a taxi from our clarke quay hotel. Kranji is situated approx 22kilometeres from the city. The round trip only costed about $50 and that was with the taxi driver waiting for us, approx half an hour. The memorial was very mooving especially when you see some of the ages on the grave stones, it was lovely to come and pay our respects. The memorial is beautifully kept, the gardens are manicured, we counted at least 6 gardeners working on the grounds, the views are lovely from there, worth a look if you have time"
,,Moving,4.0,,"Interesting area, the serenity of a memorial to the people hurt during the Japanese occupation. Simple and moving."
,,A silent and respected area,5.0,,It is a beautiful silent place that should be respected.There is not a single piece of trash and there should not be as we should not pollute such a lovely area.Do go there and write something in the visitors logbook on the left shelter. A must go for Singapore!
,,A Poignant Visit,5.0,,My Wife's Uncle was a PoW and in all possibility spent some time at Kranji. We visited the site on our recent visit to Singapore and tried to envisage what it must have been like for those young men during the war. A fitting memorial.
,,A memorable piece of history,5.0,,A must see at least once for Australian visitors to Singapore. Eye opening and poignant account of the plight of those in Singapore in WW2.
,,Very serene,4.0,,Visited war memorial and found great sadness for all those who were lost during WW2. Held a majestic impression as so high above city of Singapore.
,,Memorable,4.0,,"It was my 3rd travel to singapore and I decided to go uncommon place like Kranjk War memorial. I went there using the directions I got from internet.

I really love this place. Many graves of the soldiers who died in II world war and the youngest one was 18. I walled around the graves and saw beautiful view from top of it. The view was so beautiful. You can see the view of sea and I'm pretty sure its beautiful at night.

Would love to go back again when I visit singapore again. :)"
,,A place to reflect amid the bustle,5.0,,"This place, though off the normal tourist routes is a calm oasis amid the hurly-burly that is Singapore. An immaculately well kept memorial - a stark reminder of the sacrifice paid by many thousands of mainly young men.
As for non existent directions - exit the Kranji MTR, turn left and follow he road for 2-300 yards, under the MTR flyover, a 100 yards more then the entrance is there on your left.
A definite must see when ever you are in Singapore"
,,Memorable visit,4.0,,"The memorial is beautiful and thoughtfully designed. It was quite overwhelming seeing all the headstones and names on the memorial walls. A peaceful place, but an emotional experience."
,,Contemplation,5.0,,"If you have the time this is a special place to visit and say Thankyou to all the fallen heroes who fought for the way of life we have today. It is also where the former Presidents of Singapore are buried.
Commonwealth cemeteries are beautifully maintained and Kranji is another excellent example.
There is not usually anyone on site to help with explanations etc."
,,Memorable visit.,5.0,,"About a 15 minute walk from the Kranji MRT, but worth the time. Very sobering experience, the grounds are well kept as you would expect and everything is presented in a tasteful and respectful manner. It won't be everyone's idea of a place to visit on holiday but the people who gave there lives deserve at least an hour or so of our time, those are our thoughts anyway. We can recommend a visit.
Karen and Peter. Halifax UK."
,,Serene,5.0,,"Beautifully maintained, this memorial is well worth a visit if you are in the area. Very symmetrical in layout, it is a moving reminder of the sheer numbers of young men who gave their lives in World War Two."
,,Lovely visit,5.0,,"A very well maintained place, beautifully preserved and designed. A little far from main tourist places but use the public buses to get there. Bus drivers very friendly and happy to help."
,,Bravery Beyond Belief,5.0,,"The War Memorial and Cemetery is yet another poignant reminder of those who gave their often very short lives for our freedom. Everyone should visit war graves somewhere in the world at some time in their life, just so these brave people are never ever forgotten"
,,Solemn visit!,5.0,,"Well worth a visit to this historic memorial, very moving and full of history. Note the location is the highest natural point in Singapore!"
,,Visit to Kranji War Memorial,5.0,,"We caught to train to Kranji and walked to the Memorial. It is possible to catch a cab from the station and ask him to wait.
We enjoyed the walk which took us about 20 minutes from thaw station.
The location is so neat and tidy and we found it very moving as we walked along the rows of crosses."
,,Good but so sad,5.0,,"We went out to Kranji on the MTR, we found our way easily from the station, the memorial is so well looked after and maintained. It was very poignant to look around and so sad to see how many graves were simply marked A Soldier Of The War. Lest we forget."
,,Very moving,5.0,,A must see in Singapore. Honors those who were killed by Japanese forces in 1942 during invasion of Singapore. Very moving as every name is recorded.
,,A moving experience,5.0,,"A memorial to the many thousands that had lost their lives in Singapore and the region in World War II and subsequent conflicts. The gravestones often provide a short few words regarding the fallen service person. The great majority of those that died were very young and from the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and India. The immense scale of their sacrifice is seen upon entry into the Cemetery. On my visit we came across the Head Stone of an unknown sailor, aboard HMS Repulse when sunk by the Japanese. A relative of ours was one of the missing on that ship which made the visit all the more moving."
,,"Freedom costs so much, but a price paid dearly with the lives of many.",5.0,,"This is a solem reminder that freedom cost lives. This is the revered site of many soldiers and civilian soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the freedom of Singapore against the WW11 invaders.
Every single man and woman has a story, and this where we dont forget who they are.
You can search on Billiongraves.com, for the photos and search on Commonwealth War Graves Commission , to find out who they are.
As l wandered around the graves looking at all the names and places where these men and women came from, and wondered of their lives cut short and their heart broken families left behind.
The tour, and stories are exceptional. Well worth the visit."
,,Fitting memorial,5.0,,"This beautifully maintained memorial and cemetery is a fitting resting place for those that made the ultimate sacrifice. Our visit was particularly meaningful as my grandmother's brother is buried there, but I believe it is a place that many would find worth a visit."
,,Beautifully maintained war cemetery and memorial,5.0,,"The cemetery, although some way out of the middle of the city is really easy to get to - take the MRT to Kranji and it's a 10 to 15 min walk (The MRT staff will give directions from the station - they were really helpful).

The memorial sits amid a huge cemetery of Commonwealth Servicemen. No matter the nationality, rank, religion or service each grave has a similar headstone. The only difference is that Moslem or Hindu Graves (For example the Gurkha graves) face away from the cross of remembrance.

There are graves of those who fell during the battle for Singapore, of those lost on HMS Prince of Wales and Repulse, of those who died as Prisoners of war and of those who died in the border conflict with Indonesia and those who dies in the fight with Communist Insurgents. Also laid to rest are family members of servicemen stationed in Singapore since the war and of civil servants. Of note are the graves of the Commandos of force Z who lost their lives in an failed attack on the harbor in 1945. One can spend hours wandering through the rows and rows of headstones - each one holding a tragic tale. The regiments squadrons and ships represented tell the tale of the Second World War in the East.

The large memorial has the names of those who have no known grave and who were lost in the far East in WW2 - its humbling to read even a small part of the memorials roll call of names.

In all this is a place of quiet reflection and of contemplation. It is kept in pristine condition by very dedicated grounds staff and it is a credit to them.

It's a site visitors to Singapore should make time to visit and pay respects."
,,Remember them all,5.0,,Beautiful War Memorial to all the fallen who paid the ultimate price for freedom. Very moving and worth a visit. The gardens and memorial beautifully kept.
,,Our hero,4.0,,Never knew this place till I went on a national education tour. I felt shameful. A place to remember our glorious death. Place is well maintain as it should be. R.I.P WWII hero
,,second world war memorial,3.0,,"located at 9 Woodlands Road, in Kranji in northern Singapore. Dedicated to the men and women from United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Sri Lanka, India, Malaya, the Netherlands and New Zealand who died defending Singapore and Malaya against the invading Japanese forces during World War II, it comprises the War Graves, the Memorial Walls, the State Cemetery, and the Military Graves."
,,we should never forget,5.0,,"Row after row of brave military who sacrificed their lives for us. A very moving and upsetting experience. We should never forget.
Kanji is on the north part of Singapore and quite difficult to get to on public transport, but its a peaceful spot and well worth a visit, if only to show your gratitude and respect."
,,Remembrance,5.0,,"We visited Kranji in the 1950's just after it opened when I was serving in the RAF at Changi and we wanted to revisit it to see whether it had changed. It hadn't, unlike the rest of Singapore during that time."
,,A little sterile,5.0,,Although by my title name you may wonder why I have rated the attraction so highly. I visited some years ago and I have heard that the displays and information were so accurate and real it was upsetting to a nation so they respected their feelings and removed some of the data. The history shown here from Singapores birth to the modern day is definitely worth a visit. A wonderful display and its a credit to the organisers.
,,Incredibly Sad,5.0,,"Walking past row after row of graves with so many of them marked as Unknown is a very moving experience. What these people did, and gave up for future generations was an amazing sacrifice."
,,Kranji War cemetry,5.0,,"Very moving experience, very sad and very well kept cemetery and Memorial gardens.Went there on a bus tour from central Singapore."
,,Even more moving than most war cemeteries.,5.0,,The Commonwealth War Graves Commission achieves dignity and solemnity in all its cemeteries. This one is particularly moving: because of the tragedy involved in the fall of Singapore and the subsequent ordeal of the PoWs; the number of races fighting for the British Empire who are treated with great respect; and the fact that the skyscrapers of the modern Singapore can now be seen from Kranji (which was not possible even 30 years ago).
,,Peaceful place,5.0,,Great place to make a short visit to in order to understand Singapore's turbulent war history and pay respects to the fallen.
,,good,4.0,,"not as good as some of the other sites but a very moving place , especially for me as my uncle was lost in the war , touches the heart ."
,,So very lovely,5.0,,This was the reason for our visit to Singapore. The gardens are immaculate and it was nice to see my grandfather's headstone so well cared for.
,,Memorable,4.0,,Even though it was just set back from a main road the cemetery was so serene. Seeing the rows of headstones bought a tear to my eyes.
,,Sobering Place,5.0,,"This was my first time there it is quite big 4500 graves plus 25000 inscriptions. It was immaculate as one would hope. It is always sad when you read the ages of the young men just starting out only to be cut down and some in shocking circumstances. I think people should continue to visit these places more often it makes War so stupid when will human beings learn.

I was very lucky to find a taxi driver who volunteered to take me there wait for and hour no charge and return me back to the city it is quite remote no taxis at all the station is to far to walk in very hot conditions he only charged me S$60 return. In Australia I wouldn't have got out of it under A$250."
,,Moving place to visit,5.0,,"This is yet another perfectly maintained Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery and memorial.

There is an impressive building atop the hill that houses the names of the war dead. The graves themselves are all very well maintained.

It was fascinating to read the unit names and nations of origin of all the fallen men and women, it really does represent the wideness Commowealth.

The Singapore government and the CWGC should be congratulated for their fine work at this memorial.

It can be a little hard to find walking from the MRT station as there are no signs directing you to the war cemetery , I recommend a tourist sign at the MRT to help visitors, there were a few groups trying to find the place on foot the day we visited,"
,,Once you find it.,3.0,,"When in Singapore I always visit Kranji as my uncle is named on the memorial, as he has no grave. It must be said that Singapore is happy to 'move on' from WW11 and who can blame them? but you'd have thought they would at least have a sign post when you get out of the train, telling you where to go, maybe some general direction even? The site is only 900m from the station, but the 3 people I asked at the station had no idea, and they were locals. In the end a couple from Queensland and I found it together because she had the foresight to have the actual address. Once there, it is very well maintained, gardeners everywhere and a beautiful, restful place to be. TIP: get off at Kranji, then leave the station NOT TO THE RACEWAY, but to the road. Then continue up the road, turning left when you leave the station. Take the street name and when you get to the crossroads at the end (it's busy) so you'll know what street to stay on. The train is only SNG$2.30, a taxi will cost you about 20 each way. But it is about 2-3 Km walk round trip, so if you are elderly and not able to walk in the sun etc, hire a taxi for the round trip. There are NO facilities when you get there."
,,Emotional visit,5.0,,"Words cannot express the emotion felt by myself and my husband on seeing his great uncle's name on the memorial here and in the book ! He is on the separate memorial commemorating those buried at Singapore general hospital as he is buried in the water tank in the grounds that we also visited and left a wreath. Although there is a very busy road very close to the cemetery once you are there you just don't notice it , it is a very peaceful place and we spent the afternoon sitting in the peace . Warning -it is a long walk from the MRT , take good walking shoes and plenty of water ! We didn't realise and we were extremely footsore and thirsty by the time we returned !"
,,AROUND THE ISLAND – TOUR EAST SINGAPORE – VERY IMPRESSED.,5.0,,"Picked up at 8.30am and transferred to a very busy Singapore Flyer transfer. With everything running smoothly we were lucky to have a very informative tour guide (Philip). The tour to the Kranji War Memorial was very moving. On the bus on time and on to the next stop at the Bright Hill Temple. Philip again was very informative and took extra time to explain paintings on the walls. Lunch on the tip of Singapore overlooking Malaysia – the restaurant staff were extremely kind and the food was the best we’ve had on a tour in a long time. Next stop was the Changi Chapel and Museum. This was the highlight of the tour for us. The only negative I have here is that we wished we could have had a little extra time. (40 minutes was not enough). Next stop was Gardens by the Bay – we did most of this the day before (which we thoroughly recommend), but because of the short time once again, we opted for the $5 per person audio mini bus ride. This was an excellent way to get around the garden, if you didn’t have enough time (approx. 1day) to appreciate the gardens. If you are lucky enough to get Philip (who you can tell loves his job and history) we would thoroughly recommend this tour."
,,Moving,5.0,,Most people go to the Changi Chapel - which is also moving - but go to Kranji Ware Memorial and leave your thanks and blessing to the number of men and women who sacrificed their lives for us.
,,Very touching and raw. You will shed a tear when you see gravestones of 16 year old Australia boys who fought and died.,5.0,,Spend a few hours walking around the gardens and gravestones. It will make you truly appreciate how lucky we are to be free from war. And the sacrifices these guys make to make it so.
,,Out of the way but poignantly beautiful,4.0,,"This is certainly off-the-beaten track, however I think a trip to the memorial and cemetery would be a moving experience for military servicemen, war vets, people who've lived through World War II, and anybody from the Allied countries especially the UK, Australia, NZ, the Netherlands, and even India (since close to 50% of the names on the memorial were Indian soldiers). Anyone interested in history and WWII would also find this an interesting side trip out to the ""countryside"".

The memorial and cemetery is situated on an area about 4 acres, and the grounds are very well-maintained. It is very peaceful especially early in the morning.

It was a memorable trip for me, and you can read my blog post here:

,,Very Moving,5.0,,"Kranji War Cemetery is maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. On a family holiday, I felt it was important to visit to pay my respects. I have visited many CWGC Cemeteries in France and Belgium, but Kranji has a special feel about it. The cemetery is visible from the train as it enters Kranji MRT Station and is a 10-15 minute walk. Leaving the station turn left and walk past the Turf Club to the Traffic lights, cross the road and turn left. Ensure you purchase water in the Station as it can be very humid/hot. There is, like all CWGC Cemeteries, a register in the Shelter building at the entrance with the names of those buried there. You will also find a visitor's book for comments. I spent some time talking to the gardeners who do a fantastic job in maintaining the cemetery. Very moving experience, but felt so humble visiting this special place."
,,Remembrance,4.0,,"Kranji War Memorial is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore in a quiet part of the island, overlooking Malaysia. Maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission it is a tranquil memorial to those who lost their life in the battle for Singapore including those who died in the last days of the battle at the Singapore Hospital.
I think its worth a visit to reflect on why the memorial is there in the first place.
Lest we forget.
Please note: There are stairs at this site."
,,Pensive,5.0,,Lest we forget. A place to reflect and remind ourselves that the peace we enjoy today was paid by many who bravely stood on an invisible line.
,,Remembering,5.0,,The cemetery and memorial will tug at your heart the place is kept so beautiful and clean to their memories just remember to go to a toilet before you go out there as there does not appear to be any around there other than one in the managers office.
,,Kranji War Memorial- Befitting Rememembrance,5.0,,"Kranji War Memorial is a befiitting remembrance and a tribute to large number of Servicemen from the Commonwealth who fell during the Second World War . The Memorial is well laid , well maintained and a must visit while in Singapore . It pays great tribute to the soldiers who laid down their lives in the defence of Singapore and other areas close by.

As an ex serviceman , I felt proud to see the long list of martyrs from my country and particularly from my Regiment . It was personally a matter of honour for me to visit this site and notice excellent upkeep. Generally , we remember the soldiers in times of war but this memorial reminds us of those who never returned home.

The memorial is easily approachable from Kranji MRT . Maps and directions are provided at the MRT by some guides."
,,"Kranji War Memorial, take time to remember them...",5.0,,"I am a military historian, so am biased when it comes to Commonwealth war graves, but even bearing in mind the impeccable standards maintained by CWGC Kranji is a credit to them and those local people who tend the graves and the grounds.

My son and I broke away from yet another day on Orchard road shopping to visit Kranji and were so impressed with the tranquility of the cemetery and the standard of the grounds.

There is a bronze map close to the entrance which shows how the battle for Singapore developed and was lost which is interesting and useful in understanding the context of the many Commonwealth graves within the cemetery. We paid our respects to the variety of Commonwealth troops buried there and were saddened to see how many nurses were included in their number, bringing back the brutality of that battle...

Whilst cemeteries’ are far from everyone's holiday choice of venues, Kranji is a tranquil break from the bustle of Singapore and I think it is always nice to walk amongst the graves and pay our respects to these brave young men and women who gave their lives for our liberty..."
,,Lest We Forget!,4.0,,"It was a bit of a hike from Kranji MRT station on an extremely hot day however a very interesting, quiet and peaceful resting place for allied and local servicemen & women who fought during the ""Fall of Singapore"" and other conflicts. Well-maintained with ONE downfall - there was no toilet for visitors! I would have liked to stay longer but ended up catching the bus back to the MRT & a loo!"
,,Peaceful,5.0,,"I last visited here over 40 years ago (way back in my Navy days) … and it's a credit to the people who look after it.

From memory, the gardens appear as well groomed today as they were then, and are a fitting memorial to those who paid the supreme sacrifice.

Well worth a visit … if only to spend a minute or two in reflecting upon our lives today.

If you live in a ""free"" country, then you owe this place a few minutes of your time!

We took a cab there (about $25) but took MRT back to central Singapore (about $2.50 each). Turn right as you leave the cemetery, go straight across at the traffic lights, and the station is about 7 or 8 minutes walk on the right (adjacent to the over-road walkway)."
,,A beautiful memorial,5.0,,"It is set in a quiet lovely huge immaculate rememberance garden, so perfectly kept. 4,000 marked graves of service men/woman, and 24,000 names of unmarked graves. worth a visit to pay your respects to the fallen."
,,Wish we had done a tour,4.0,,This a very special place and beautifully kept. Just walkIng past the many headstones bought tears to my eyes the thought of these brave men and women who lost their lives fighting. When we were there a small group arrived with a tour leader who was telling them about some of the men and women and how they lost their lives in the line of duty which would of been far more meaningful. It was about an hour by train from Sentosa Island so money spent on a tour would of been money well spent.
,,Very moving and educational.,5.0,,"We have a family member who was a POW at Changi, so wanted to find out more. Had a very informative and interesting visit with our 10 year old daughter who was very engaged in the exhibits and the information presented, so we would recommend to families despite some of the content being confronting."
,,Kranji,5.0,,"As an ex serviceman, who also served in Singapore, Kranji is a place of pilgrimage.
It is beautifully kept, from the entrance to the graves and the Memorial wall. It is quiet, solemn place, very peaceful and in places very restful. To walk among the immaculate graves and read their stories is to go back in time and remember and appreciate."
,,Truely Inspiring,5.0,,"This is a long way from the centre of town, but worth the effort. Catch the MRT to the station and a 5 minute walk up the road.
Beautifully maintained and well worth remembering the sacrifice made by so many.
A real must while in Singapore."
,,Just awesome!,5.0,,"How can such a beautiful place bring tears to the eyes? The gardens and graves are kept in pristine condition and as a 'park' it is beautiful - but- then you start to read the headstones - so sad - so young, men and women (young nurses killed whilst trying to protect the wounded in hospital etc). My Dad was in the force that relieved Singapore - I felt so proud of him and his commrades and so sad for the terrible loss of life. Thank you to Singapore for preserving this wonderful place."
,,Reflective...,4.0,,"I hadn't planned this trip... I went for a hike along the old railway in Singapore for a few hours, came off to find the mrt and found Kranji cemetery

I have an interest in WW2, In a sense I want to understand more, what happened over here and how. This cemetery gave me a real insight into how many fought and died for freedom just in singapore.. Seeing a figure in a book is not like seeing the names engraved on those walls... And what countries they were from... I know these are not all the names either...It is a pristine place...and a reflective place. On a hill, but it does have cover but do take water to drink as it gets hot out here! Worth a visit."
,,A wonderful Memorial,5.0,,"I am not a great lover of Cementries. But I found this one in Singapore very well kept and beutifully laid out. We went to pay our respects to our fathers mate who died at the fall of Singapore durinf WWII, I didnt want to go, but my brother insisted. Im glad I went, for the best part I sat and just reflected, peaceful and so sad. The lads were so young (20 year olds!!)

Its worth the trip out and can be gotten to by the MRT. Get off at Krani station. Taking public transport alos allows you to see some of the country side of SIngapore. It then is a matter of making sure you take the right turn out of the station. We became lost because we took the racecourse exit and stayed inside the fence of the turf club."
,,World Class Military Cemetery,5.0,,The 1st place I visited after I landed in Singapore. The highlight of my trip. Catch the MRT to Kranji Station walk past the racecourse and it takes about a 10 to 15 minute walk - be aware that the hoeat and humidity of Singapore can be sapping. Beautifuly laid out and very well maintained. Mainly dedicated to UK and Australian service personnel. Also does feature some Dutch and Gurkha grave stones as well. Very moving (I broke down several times) and highly recommended.
,,Very Interesting Memorial,5.0,,"Plan your trip well if you are going to Kranji. It is not a place for elderly people as there is quite a lot of walking and all up hill.
Amazing place to visit though. Well worth the effort of going. Getting a taxi can be a bit of a wait but well worth it."
,,War Cemetery,5.0,,If you you are an Aussie / New Zealander / British or Indian a visit to this hidden part of Singapore is a must. It is near the Woodlands causeway. A must see
,,Sad but proud,5.0,,"Overlooking the causeway between Singapore and Malaysia, Kranji is a testament to those from many Nations who died for us. As usual, the CWGC keeps these military cemeteries in beautiful condition and while it's the least that can be done, I'm grateful that it is done. RIP"
,,Solemn Place,4.0,,"Came here once for photography, the place feel solemn, the graves are neatly and respectfully arranged. From the hill top, one can see Johor Bahru (Malaysian City) across the Johor Straits separating Singapore and Malaysia. Do come here early morning, it feel peaceful and calming."
,,Worth a visit if you have an interest in WWII,4.0,,This memorial is extremely well maintained and is full of headstones of many who died in WWII. It also lists thousands of names of Allied Soldiers who perished. It is a reminder of the ultimate sacrifice made by so many. The Memorial slopes up from the road and so those who have trouble with stairs or slopes may face a challenge reaching the very top.
,,A visit to the Kranji War Memorial,3.0,,"On the walls of this memorial are written the names of 24 000 Commonwealth soldiers and airmen who lost their lives fighting the Japanese during WWII. The cemetery has immaculate lawns and it is next to the state cemetery. In the state cemetery are buried two former presidents of Singapore, Yusof Ishak and Dr Benjamin Henry Sheares. Other presidents have chosen not to be buried here. The Kranji War Memorial is about 1 km from the Kranji MRT station."
,,A place to remember the mistakes from the wars....,5.0,,"This was a very emotional place, even that I do not have relatives who participated in that war, we all should remember the heroes who sacrificed their life in the name of the freedom......The best way to go is with City-Discovery on the Round Island Tour with lunch included; it is US$55 per person while our Cruise Line charged US$260 pp."
,,Kranji,5.0,,An emotive place to visit. Again emphasises mans inhumanity to man. The waste of life makes one angry. It is kept beautifully and is a great memorial.
,,A poignant visit for us,5.0,,"Like all war graves this is immaculately kept. As you enter the gateway there is a bronze ""safe"" set into the wall of the left hand gateway which houses an index to the gravestones so that you can easily find a specific grave. If you continue up to the top of the cemetery, there is a remembrance wall for those with no known resting place. There is also another couple of ""safes"" with indexes to the names on the wall.
We wanted to go there as we wanted to find our grandfathers name on the memorial which we found quite easily using the index books in the ""safe"". It was a very moving moment for my sister and I."
,,Very interesting and moving.,5.0,,We have visited Kranji War Memorial twice now and found both visits very interesting and moving. It is worth the ride out on the MRT to visit this site. Immaculately kept with beautiful respect. No visit to Singapore is complete without visiting here. A great reminder of how people gave their lives from across the world.
,,Beautifully kept in honour of of those who gave their lives for this lovely Island.,5.0,,"I have visited Kranji many time and never fail to be amazed by the place. It overlooks the area where many of the man fell. As you walk around the place you become aware they were not all British or Australians, there are Indians and several other national resting there. When I took my father there many years ago he was very moved by it. He was an 8th Army man and had never been east of Suez.
The WGC do an outstanding job in keeping it well groomed and tidy. Well done all."
,,Haunting and evocative,4.0,,A reminder to us all that many have given their lives up to provide us with the world that we live in. A chance to reflect and ponder on what man is capable of doing to his own kind and an opportunity to remind ourselves never to get into that position again.
,,A WELL MAINTAINED PLACE,3.0,,"This war memorial is a well maintained place to be visit, not a big place, but must watch if you are in sorrounding area"
,,A must visit,5.0,,If you have served in the far east and lost Friends in conflict then this is a must visit. I found the men that we left behind and it felt good to see that they are cared for in this well looked after cemetery
,,A moving experience,5.0,,"I went to the Kranji War Memorial when I was a small child living in Singapore in the 50s. My father's cousin had his name on one of the tablets. Even then it was a haven of peace and tranquility, and immense sadness. I saw grown men crying as they walked around looking for the names of loved ones lost. Definitely a must visit!!"
,,A tear jerker - but please go there.,5.0,,As an ex serviceman who setrved here in Malaysia and Singapore in the 1960's I am well aware of the history. The cemetery is a beautiful place and is tremendously well looked after by a dedicated team. I cannot say I enjoyed my visit but it is one of the things you have to do to understand other people's sacrifice.
,,Incredibly moving,5.0,,"This was an important stop on our Singapore visit this time. Two of my great uncles had been Changi POW's and one had died on a Japanese Hell Ship so his name is on the great wall of this memorial.

We took a taxi from Changi Village to the Memorial -$24 one way and were the first there so the site was so peaceful and very moving for us all (my parents were with us). It's beautifully kept and maintained and the records are easy to understand in locating a grave or name on the wall. At the front gates is a remembrance/guest book to write in.

From here to Changi War Museum was a $23cab ride or you can take a MRT back to the city. The MRT / Cab rank is a less than 10minute walk (next to the Turf Club)."
,,A very moving place,5.0,,Visited for the Dawn Service on ANZAC Day. Rivals the war memorials in France where so many thousands gave their lives for our freedom. I never knew there were so many killed in Singapore during the war. All parents should not only take their children to these places but should explain as much as they can about why they are so important in teaching us about humanity. Lest we forget.
,,A moving experience,5.0,,"It was an interesting experience to wander quietly around the cemetary & memorial.

Everything is well presented and is quite fitting.
If you take the train to Kranji Station, it is just a short walk (5-10) along the road until you get to the memorial. Not hard to find, but I'd recommend printing a map of the area just in case as there's not much in between and there may not be an opportunity to ask anybody there."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,Worth every minute.Very informative and interesting. Staff very helpfull too. Recommended. Take public transfer to get to it and walk up from main road then you see what the soldiers were fighting in
,,Moving but fascinating,5.0,,"This large ansd beautiful CWG cemetery is way up north near the race course on a slight rise overlooking the straits and over to Malaysia. Unlike many of the main Singapore nostalgia sites it is usually deserted and that's a pity because apart from the obvious sad message of the graves, it conceals a number of interesting SIngapore stories including the World War One graves, some German burials, a section dating from the Malayan campaign and another of the wives and children. Also buried here are some of the WW2 notables including Ivan Lyon and some of his Rimau team. At the top of the cemetery is a strangely mataphorical monument inscribed with the names of the countless others who died; you can't help but be struck by the relatively limitless roll-call of Indian nationals who fought and died for the concrete city in the distance. A much needed counterweight to Clark Quay."
,,super,5.0,,"I had a day before meetings in Singapore and took a couple of hours out. It was jolly hot.

I was staggered by the 24 thousand dead claim on the main tribute. It is a slightly noisy place now, but the cemetery is unique. The gardeners show true deference to their envionment.

It is beautiful. I teared at many names, not because I have lost a relative, but because I recognised a common surname and region (personally, East Surrey) and also acknowledge the sacrifice.

It is a moving location. So very glad I visited.

But for the grace of God.."
,,"For serious war history buffs, or relatives of the fallen.",3.0,,"This site is a personal journey for some, a historical exploration for others. Row after row of well-tended graves, most of them very clearly marked, await your respectful gaze."
,,Moving,5.0,,"A bit of the beaten track for the average vistor to Singapore, that said only a short bus ride from the MRT, I think it was one stop and a short walk.
Kranji is excellent not for any sort of tourist experience, but for what it represents, it is a very well kept memorial, and a reminder to us all of the sacrifice made by those who lost thier lives during WW2.
It was good to see a steady stream of visitors, never busy just couples and family groups callign to pay tier respects, of the tourist track but a memoerable visit."
,,Another solemn yet beautiful place for the kids to visit,5.0,,The fallen have to be remembered; especially in the vain attempt of keeping the sovereignty of this country. Children of the next generation should visit and acqaint themselves on the history and highest price paid by these fallen men and women to defend our nation. The serenity of this place epitomizes the peace in this country. A must see for all .... visitors and locals alike.
,,War memorial,5.0,,"I found this site awe inspiring, you just must make the effort to visit and pay your respects to the Soldiers who gave their life defending Singapore during the invasion."
,,A great tribute to those who defended Singapore during WWII,5.0,,"This is beautiful and sacred ground and is a wonderful monument to those who gave their lives in WWII. It is a bit far from the central city but worth a trip if you have an extra day and enjoy war memorials. Like everything else in Singapore, it is accessible by public transit."
,,Beautiful memorial/cemetery. Worth a visit.,4.0,,We visited the memorial as part of our Kranji staycation. A peaceful and beautiful place. Perfectly maintained lawns that my boy had a blast exploring. Found easily via car. Would visit again.
,,A place for peaceful contemplation,5.0,,The war memorial is a little out of the centre but easily reachable on the MRT to Kranji and then a bus from alongside the station for just two stops (quarter of a mile). For those wishing to pay their respects it gives a better idea of the nations involved in the fall of Singapore. A really well maintained war memorial.
,,A fitting and solemn tribute to the brave men of WW II,5.0,,I visited Kranji Cemetry today to pay my respects to a fellow Artilleryman from Bolton on behalf of his son with whom I attend the same RAA Branch. The Cemetry is so well kept and is a shining example of the respect due to our brave fallen heroes. The staff do such an excellent job and do so with respect and solemnity. Keep up the great work on keeping Kranji pristine. Ubique!
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,The memorial is really poignant and informative of the dreadful events in the area in WWII. The cemetery is like all Commonwealth Graves beautifully kept. Like similar places it reminds you of just howe many and how varied were the Commonwealth citizens who died in the struggles against therinvaders
,,"peaceful, with beautiful gardens",5.0,,"Having been to various war cemetries, I would say this is one of the most beautiful. The monument itself is unusual, but the way in which the grass is kept, the beautiful trees and the gentle slope up, is gracious and a fitting place for our heros to be laid to rest."
,,Very moving experience,5.0,,"This is such a moving memorial to the soldiers of WWII from all the diffferent continents. It is beautifully kept on a hill away from the hustle of the city but easily reached on the MRT, and a poignant reminder of the traumas suffered by the people of the island"
,,Humbling,5.0,,"I have never visited this memorial site before, despite carrying out National Service in Singapore in 1960/1 and returning a number of times since. The siting is inspiring, with spectacular views of the Malayan coast. The memorial is so pristine, it is a credit to those who maintain it, both at management and ground level. The quietness is serene. A visit is a humbling experience."
,,Beautiful and poignant,5.0,,"A lovely, peaceful memorial park, with a poignant purpose. Just a few mins walk away from the nearest subway station, and the next moment, you step back into time, learning about how the soldiers of WW2 risked their life for mankind and for peace."
,,Nice Memorial,4.0,,Kraji war memorial is a nice place to visit. It was built to commemorate the death of soldiers and in hope that no war will come upon us again
,,An oasis of peace and calm,5.0,,"I went to pay my respects to those, including my uncle, who never returned. The graves and lawns are beautifully maintained and after the bustle of Singapore City it was so peaceful. I easily found his name engraved on the memorial and sat for a long time in the calm. Never thought I would get to Singapore but so glad that finally at 65 I did."
,,Very peaceful,4.0,,After eventually getting here it was worth it? We went on the mrt to kranji which was no problem but when you get there be careful as no signs to follow! Come out of station and turn LEFT ( we thought it was right and walked 2 miles in wrong direction- not good in that heat) keep straight on to traffic lights-- over those and take turning on right to cemetery. Only takes 10 mins max if you do it properly!!! Worh the walk as I have 2 ancestors buried here and it is very humbling to remember what they all sacrificed. Beautifully kept by the war graves commission.just a little tip! All the lists of graves are kept behind a copper door in the entrance but you can read to find what you are looking for.
,,A humbling experience,5.0,,"I have an uncle named on one of the panels, so it was a ""family"" visit. Typical Commonwealth War Grave - impeccably maintained and well laid out. A credit to the staff there. You walk ""up"" to it, which adds to the sense of occasion. Much bigger than expected and includes graves of those killed during Malay problems. The sheer number of graves and names on the panels starts to get to you. It's a sweaty 15 min walk from Kranji Station and there are no toilets at the cemetery when you get there. Use those at the station before you set off on foot. You'll need at least an hour there, maybe 2. Don't forget to visit the civilian war memorial near Esplanade Station in the city - lots of civilians died too."
,,The green green grass of home.,5.0,,"The pristine lawn and flower borders, the grave stones all clean and in straight lines. Grave inscriptions still clear and easily legible, the average age of the soldiers brings a lump to the throught."
,,It is good to pay your respects.,5.0,,"To put this war memorial into context we visited as part of a Wednesday, Original Singapore Walks tour. Our guides pointed out significant graves and how they are regarded by young Singaporeans. It was very moving."
,,A worthwhile visit,5.0,,"To get to the memorial you take the MRT to Kranji. The memorial is reached by turning left on leaving the station and following the main road, crossing another road at some traffic lights and passing under the MRT. The turning off to the memorial is well signposted. The walk takes about 15 minutes. Avoid visiting the memorial on race days.

The memorial itself is a reminder of just how many service personnel died in Singapore. The range of nationalities is sobering; This visit is completely different from the Changi Chapel; When I was there there was peace and quiet and just a few other visitors."
,,We owe so much,5.0,,"To see row upon row of head stones, and most of them so young, but the most touching are those that just read ""A Soldier known unto God"" Lest We Forget"
,,Humbling,4.0,,"It's always at places like this where you have to say a silent thank you to those that sacrificed for us to walk free. This is a place where you have to stop and think ""rather them than me"""
,,memorial,5.0,,"this is a wonderfully kept cemetery of fallen soldiers from world war one and two they are Australian soldiers, sailors, and airmen and a lot of british and other nationalities as well its a beautiful sight to be behold and should be visited if you go to Singapore."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Being Australian it was well worth a visit. A reminder of the brave men and women who sacrificed their lives. Well worth the visit in our view.
,,A Fitting Tribute,5.0,,"Went to the Remembrance Day Service which starts at 7.30 am and lasts approximately 45 minutes. What a fitting tribute to the so many who gave their lives. The location is a lovely peaceful green hillside and as the bagpipes played followed by the buglers Last Post you can not help but feel the emotion.

It was encouraging to see a large turn out of people paying their respects, both young and old alike, particularly a large number of young Singaporeans. It is nice to know that this next generation will ensure that those who gave so much are never forgotten.

As to the cemetry itself, it is spotlessly clean and impeccably maintained and is well worth a visit. T
Just be prepared for a more emotional time than you may otherwise expect."
,,A memorable experience,4.0,,"a 10 minute ""jalan"" from Kranji MRT station (or a 2 minute bus ride if you want to queue - but you still have to walk a bit!) this serene & sobering place commemorates the 24000 allied servicemen of all nations who gave their lives in the defence of Singapore & Malaya during the WWII.
We, who enjoy the freedom of international travel, owe it to their memory and a few moments of quiet reflection in this beautifully kept location are truly worthwhile."
,,Very moving,5.0,,"We used the MRT to get to Kranji station and then a bus, but you could have walked from the station - it is not far. As you enter there are big gateways - one of which has a bronze door which contains a reference book to the graves so you can locate a specific grave. We were able to find my second-cousin's grave easily with this book. Everything in the cemetery is beautifully maintained and you get a sense of the dreadful loss of so many men and women, mostly so young. There are nice views from the big memorial at the top which also lists thousands of other names of the dead. Outside the entrance gates is a detailed placque with map of Singapore detailing the days of the fall to the surrender. After our visit we tried to walk to the zoo - big mistake - its too far to walk - go back to the station and catch a bus further on to Mandai (I think) road, and then wait for another bus that goes along Mandai to the zoo."
,,Emotional,5.0,,As part of a tour this visit was exceptional. Very emotional to see the graves of our fallen. The cemetery is impeccably maintained by the Singaporeans.
,,Respect...,5.0,,"Awesome , emotional , saddening.. to see what our forefathers fought for, now it one big shopping centre.. i dont think that would have been what they had in mind.. thank you to the groundskeepers for keeping it so fresh .. well worth it!!!"
,,Worth a Visit,5.0,,Great spot especially if you have a relative buried there. Catch a cab though train is about 10 minute’s walk away and in the heat is a bit of a challenge.
,,Lest We Forget,5.0,,"We are currently residents of Singapore on a two-year working stint. We visited Kranji for the dawn service on Anzac Day 2012. I would thoroughly recommend any expat Aussie or Kiwi go next year. It was beautiful. Order a cab as getting there by public transport is difficult and leave some time at the end to enjoy the breakfast that is provided - anzac biscuits for example. Go, you will not regret it....They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old.
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.
At the going down of the sun and in the morning
We will remember them"". Lest we forget"
,,"""Quiet, solemn, a good walk into the history books"".",5.0,,PRO: ~An experience that combines historical and educational. ~Still visited by the relatives. ~A nice place take the stillness. CON: ~Far away from the city. ~Difficult for the elderly to move around.
,,Makes you realize how many people died for our freedom,5.0,,"This is a beautiful and peaceful cemetery for the soldiers who died defending Singapore against the Japanese in WWII. The graves are very well maintained, the grounds are beautiful and peaceful. We took the MRT to Kranji and then walked the rest. There are 850 unidentified graves which makes you realize the sacrifice these men and women made during the WWII. ""THEY DIED FOR ALL FREE MEN"""
,,A minute to remember,5.0,,"I visited Kranji so I could pay my respects to those who'd made the ultimate sacrifice. I travelled out by MRT, and then walked from the station to the cemetary. The one thing that always impresses me is the way the sites are looked after and everyone involved deserves credit for this. Some may think it's morbid but I try to spend time at sites in cities I visit, it makes me appreciate how fortunate I've been."
,,Kranji RIP,5.0,,"One of the most peaceful and respectful memorials i have ever seen! evokes deep emotions, reminds you how many young lives were gievn for our freedom."
,,History,5.0,,"Think this place will be suitable for those who involve in war world, or are the family member/relatives of those who had station in Singapore before in much early year.

From the MRT, it take about 15mins walk there, good place for history education and to pay respect to those had risk their life to protect the nation"
,,Lest we forget,5.0,,"I planned to visit Kranji while on a buisness trip to Singapore. I would recommend doing the Changi musuem first and Kranji second. I done Changi on the morning and Kranji on the afternoon. The easiest way to get around is by buying the tourist MRT card as the two places are oppersit ends of the Island. You can get all the directions of the two websites but they really are easy to get to, the only thing I would say is Kranji is not signposted from the station. Just ask the taxi for the war memorial as they dont call it a cemetery. The taxi rank is next to the bus stops to the left as you come out of the station it is only five minutes from the station but to far to walk. When I came out of the cemetery I just crossed the main road and flagged a taxi down. Take some water with you as the sun is pretty relentless.

I would like to thank the commenwealth war graves commision for the amazing work they do . This place is immaculate like all the other locations they look after."
,,A minute of silence please?,4.0,,"Visiting a war memorial is not exactly the first thing people would think of doing in Singapore, in fact it probably didn't occur to too many that there are memorials outside of Europe and the Middle East! Here is a slice of Singapore’s history. Take some time out of your day in Singapore and wander through the memorial, there you find peace from the traffic and skyscrapers. It is a bit out of the main area and there’s not much around, so I’d recommend you head out there if you’re keen on spending 2-3 hours travelling and visiting the site."
,,"Solemn, sacred, serene place to remember those who died for us...",5.0,,"Being a fan and student of history, I got the chance to go here during a group cohesion where we laid a wreath and had a minute of silence to pay respect to those who died in the defence of Singapore.

You should take at least an hour to look at the various graves of the fallen from many countries. Of particular interest to me was the graves of LTC Ivan Lyon and the other members of Z Special Unit who took part during Operation Rimau in September 1943 and were subsequently killed or excuted during Operation Rimau in October 1944.

The cemetery is very well kept and maintained so if you have time to spare or need a breather from the hustle of the city, it's definitely worth a visit."
,,Didn't plan on visiting this memorial - but so pleased we did,5.0,,"We didn't plan on visiting this memorial but so pleased we did.
It was such an emotional and moving experience - I do not have relations/ friends remembered at this memorial but my grandfather did visit Singapore during the war and I am sure he had fallen comrades there. He often told us stories of Singapore and then Celon (Sri lanka) when we were children - it was nice to visit on his behalf as he is no longer alive, and pay respects for him.
The grounds are so well looked after it is a credit to Singapore."
,,Take the time to visit,5.0,,"Kranji is a fair distance from the hustle of the city. As young Australian's we were determined to visit this important memorial. The North South MRT line takes you straight to the area. Then, if your up for it, it's a 20/30min walk along Woodlands Ave. There is a local bus running also and taxis will take you right there to the memorial. We just chose the cheapest option.
We were pleased with the upkeep, although not sure if the extra attention to detail was just for the Royal visit the next day. The site has been treated with respect, which was comforting after the Bidadari etc incidents.
The number of headstones and names was overwhelming. The layout is well thought out. The placement of the differing countries and ranks is touching, especially to see malay volunteers and the unnamed. If your not familar with Singapore's war history, read up at the entrance so you can appreciate the bravery and sacrifice. I personally went to pay my respect to the people who kept my own famiy safe during this time. A must visit for members of the Commonwealth."
,,Beautifully kept memorial,4.0,,Another reminder along with Changi of the desparate nature of war but a fitting excellently maintained memorial to those who gave the ultimate sacrifice. Very moving site.
,,Take time out from your busy tourist schedule to visit,4.0,,"The trip to Kranji war memorial was not something we had on our list of things to do but it happened to be on the itinerary of a round island tour we wanted to do...and we're pleased it was. It was a moving experience, so sad to see the 1000's of memorial headstones and shocked that so many of them were Australians but most humbling of all were the unamed headstones that simply say 'A soldier of the 1939-1945 war'...take time out to ackowledge those that gave their lives for our freedom throughout the world.
Previous reviews are correct it is a beautifully maintained memorial that deserves our respect and ackowledgement, it may not be a 'tourist attraction' as such but we're happy for it to be listed as one if it brings it to the attention of travellers."
,,A must do for Aussies on ANZAC Day,5.0,,"All Aussies passing through Singapore on this special day should experience the ANZAC Dawn service at Kranji. It starts with an early morning taxi ride (be aware of surcharge) to a large gathering of expats and visiting servicemen at the top memorial. After an emotional service there is a very large and free catered breakfast including Anzac biscuits and even a dash of Bundy for your coffee.
Also on offer are free guided tours of the various graves of prominent diggers who gave their lives for us.
Truly something to experience! Thank you to whoever sponsors this event."
,,Serene and contemplative haven,4.0,,"A wide, windy expanse that is worth an hour at least. Wandering around the graves of the fallen brings to mind vividly the struggle between the local forces and the Japanese during the second world war. Two presidential graves are also points of interest."
,,Sacred Place Of Remembrance,4.0,,"Personally, I don't think Kranji War Memorial should be a tourist attraction, so I disagree with the Singapore Tourism Board on this one. Dedicated to those who gave their life in service during the war, as well as those innocents who lost theirs, Kranji War Memorial is a sacred and peaceful place.

Beautifully preseved and maintained, the Kranji War Memorial is filled with various tributes to those lives. Each item has its significance, its layout has meaning. The centerpiece is the War Memorial Building, with its design a tribute to the Army, Navy and Air Force, and filled with Memorial Walls.

Despite the religious Christian imagery present at the Kranji War Memorial, it is actually a multi-religious place. Here are the resting places of men and women of different faiths, be it Christian, Hindu, or Buddhist.

The Kranji War Memorial is in a rather remote location, so taking a cab, or driving, is advised. Public transport to Kranji War Memorial is troublesome and time consuming.

If you're planning a visit, do note that while admission is free, you really only need less than 1 hour here. Also, there are no bathroom facilities or restaurants at the Kranji War Memorial, so plan ahead. It's open daily from 7am to 6pm, but visiting earlier in the day is recommended. And be respectful!"
,,Visit,4.0,,Very informative. i got to learn that young men from quite a few different nations laid down their life in that war. Sad too that so many died.
,,Anzac Day Service,5.0,,Extremely moving. Guided tour afterwards was excellent giving us personal accounts of a few who didn't make it.
,,We shall not forget them who died for us,4.0,,"Great garden, peaceful environment, deep history. Worth a half day visit before the horse race. For detail of how to get there, you may view our blog at http://Mugiwaradzenture.WordPress.com/"
,,Solemn destination,4.0,,An extremely interesting place which higlights the tragedy of war. As is usual with Commonwealth War Graves sites this beautifully maintained
,,Beautifully kept cemetery,4.0,,"As with all CWGC cemeteries its immaculately kept, and as moving an experience to walk around the grounds as they all are. Well worth the trip (its about 30mins out of the city center), certainly if you have any interest in this sort of thing (and you should!)"
,,Kranji War Cemetry,4.0,,"Glad I made the effort.It is a well maintained Cemetry. It was interesting to read the ages of the soldiers and to see the many different countries that citzens made the ultimate sacrifice. You catch the MRT to kranji, the ticket office has a little map that shows how to get there either by walking or catching the bus from Kranji. The Cemetry is not suitable for wheelchairs you have to go up steps and then the site is on an incline."
,,Research first to get the most out of your visit,5.0,,"A visiting relative wanted to go and ""look for her uncle"" after failing to find him at Changi on her last visit to Singapore. When I googled to get basic visitor information, I found the excellent search facilities of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission:
http://www.cwgc.org/
Using this we were able to discover that her long lost uncle was indeed listed on the memorial at Kranji, and which column he was on. Her family had never known what became of him, and so it was wonderful to discover, via this website (and further internet research), where and when he had died.

The memorial is well described by other reviewers, and I agree is a beautiful spot to visit, even if you have no family connection to WW2 Singapore and Malaya. We went by taxi, and were able to phone book a taxi to pick us up again. We went before 9.00am when it was still fairly cool, which I recommend. There are no toilets on site, and not necessarily any staff available to answer your questions.

We combined with a visit to the nearby Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve."
,,Include this as part of your visit to Sungei Buloh wetlands,3.0,,This is a war memorial & as such is definitely worth a visit. Naturally it may not be on every tourist's agenda. Add it to your visit to Sungei Buloh wetlands and the farms around northern Singapore. It will add another perspective to your trip.
,,"Not really a tourist detination, more a drive past",3.0,,"Its in central Singapore, you drive past it regularly, I like its simple form and poignant message, but its not really a destination in itself."
,,Not At The Top Of Attraction But Worth The Visit ...,4.0,,if you want to know more about Singapore's history.
,,Unmissable,5.0,,Lived in Singapore off and on since 2003. Visited for the first time yesterday with my mother. This place is very moving and real. Should be a must visit for all of us. The Japs were barbarous.
,,Peaceful Place and Well Kept,4.0,,"This is a war memorial and not a Disneyland attraction. There is no McDonald's and no t-shirts to be bought.

However, if you are interested in learning about a part of WWII and honor the people who died for Singapore and/or their mother country, then this is an interesting place.

The memorial is near the Kranji line on the MRT. It is about 50 minutes out from Orchard Station. After exiting the station turn left for about 300 meters to the entrance of the memorial. The MRT fare is generally about 2 Sing. A taxi will cost about 50 Sing from the same location.

The memorial is an open space on an incline hill that is well groomed. It is very peaceful and this is a great place to watch a sunrise or sunset. The main tomb has a register to find any soldier's placement by their name. There is also a printed history of most of the engagements of Singapore's conflicts in WWII."
,,"Inf you want to see a real oasis , that' place for it.",4.0,,"For travelers how like to see real desert far form city's and almost at the middle of desert life this is the best option . Also you can enjoy fantastic star glazing , and enjoy traditional music"
,,Remember,5.0,,"Can't understand the comment that Kranji War Memorial ""doesn't have a lot to offer"" - what are they looking for for goodness sake? Anyway, Kranji is easy to reach from Kranji Station on the MRT - costs less than £2 from the centre of Singapore. Less than a 10 minute walk and you are surrounded by the reverence and dignity of a typical immaculate Commonweatlh War Graves Commission maintained memorial to those who gave their lives in various conflicts during the first half of the last century in this part of SE Asia. It is a magnificent place; sad, humbling and thought-provoking. Recommended for those who have an interest in modern history and who think about life."
,,One of the Best War Memorials in the World,5.0,,"Located in the Northern part of Singapore, its one of the best and well maintained War Memorials I have seen, the way memorial has been laid out makes it easy to look for a group and the soldier who contributed his life to WW11. Some of war stories from the Japanese occupation were very interesting. To me the fall of Malaya and Singapore was the British worse Military disastor ever made."
,,Very moving,5.0,,"I don't ever understand reviewers who go to war cemeteries and then give them low marks. They are war cemeteries, they are what they say on the tin and are not supposed to be tourist attractions with rides and places to buy ice creams and anyone who expects otherwise is a few sandwiches short of a picnic.

Kranji is incredibly moving like all war cemetaries. It is certainly a long way out of town but completely worth the trip for all people to see the toll of WW2 rather than just read the numbers in books. It is immaculate and while not as peaceful as other cemetaries I've visited in Europe (due to it being flanked by busy roads) it is a wonderful place for our war dead to rest. Any Commonwealth citizen should go and see it and appreciate it for what it is."
,,Fitting Memorial,5.0,,The grounds are immaculate and well tended. Staff are on hand to answer any questions you might have. Easiest way is Bus/train to Kranji MRT then a short walk.
,,Personal interest,4.0,,Took dad who was a Japanese POW in Singapore. Unfortunately nothing was accessible for him as he is in a wheelchair and couldn't manage the steps. Well kept memory to those who fell.
,,kranji war memorial,2.0,,"it was quite and enriching experience seeing all the names of the soldeirs who fought for singapore during the battle against Japan but its a really long way to go, about an hours drive from the city, for something that doesn't really have much to offer."
,,"Very peaceful, clean, and nice place - Great for people who loves to be quiet",4.0,,"However you need to check it out how to go first..Not really for tourists who are in rush for time on visiting..

This is not a cemetery but a war memorial and good place for rest/think after a busy week. Windy and quiet..

Morning to day time is the only best time to go.

It is a free (no entrance fees) and good place to rest and reflect feelings. Not for noisy children or to bring them along."
,,A MEMORIAL WORTH VISITING,5.0,,"During our city tour of Singapore in August'2011, our cab stopped by this famous memorial in Singapore.It was built to pay glowing tributes to the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country.The place is almost centrally located.We took couple of photos with the memorial in the backdrop.The frontage of the place is excellent and the upkeep is superb.

I recommend this place to all those who visit the island nation of Singapore."
,,War Graves,5.0,,"I have now been to Kranji twice. Each time it has been a moving experience. This second time, as I was about to leave two coaches of Singaporean schoolchildren drew up. After seeing gravestones of young men and women, it hit me hard that were a war to happen the future for such persons would be grim, if there were any future at all. I find war cemeteries very emotional. I thank my lucky stars I have never had to fight in a war or undergo occupation. The relatively peaceful world we have today was won through the loss of so many lives.

As ever in such places, the grounds are maintained to a high standard. Somehow this makes everything more poignant.

To get there is easy on the MRT. Turn left and walk up past the race course. At the crossroads (there are traffic lights for pedestrians) keep on straight ahead and you go under the elevated MRT. A sign just before the first turning on your left and you walk up to the cemetery. The walk there and back gave me ample time for reflection."
,,A place for reflection,4.0,,"I visited the Kranji memorial at the insistance of my mother. Her grandfather, my great grandfather, fought in Singapore and his name is on the memorial.

My partner and I caught the MRT to Kranji station. There aren't any signs for the memorial in or around the sation, so we asked at the ticket desk and the lady kindly have us a small map with the general direction. Not realising we could catch the bus, we walked the 1 to 2 kms to the memorial. Take lots of water with you if you do! It was very humid and hot that day, and we sillily only took one bottle of water between us!

The memorial is immaculately maintained. It was very quiet on the day we visited, with only a couple of other people around. It is a place for quiet reflection. Very still and tranquil.

It made a nice change to the hustle and bustle of the busy shopping districts in the city."
,,Kranji War Memorial - A Place for Peaceful Reflection,5.0,,"Kranji War Memorial is a place to behold. It is immaculately looked after by the Singaporeans and is testament to the high regard that they hold for those brave men and women who died defending their little island.

The lawns are very well maintained and the view from the top of the hill is absolutely beautiful.

As a Vietnam Veteran I am aware of the sacrifices made by many in defence of freedom and liberty and whilst war is horrible Kranji stands as a monument to those that made the supreme sacrifice and should not be missed particularly if you are British, Australian or New Zealander.

Getting there can be a bit daunting if you want to go on your own but there is a MRT Station at Kranji and then it is only a short bus ride to the front of the Memorial. If you are unsure then just ask anyone at the station and they will be more than willing to help. Make sure you take an umbrella as it can get quite warm out there and when it rains there is not much cover. Also make sure yopu have good shoes and plenty of water and battery power for your camera as there is ample opportunity for good photos."
,,"January 31st, 2009",5.0,,"I made two trips to the Kranji War Memorial and Cemetery during my week in the country. The first was with an organized tour group through Singapore Walks. The second was a trip by myself on my last day in Singapore to place flowers on the graves of the Unknown Soldiers.

The Kranji War Memorial and Cemetery is immaculately kept and appropriately serene. The monuments speak for themselves and need no explanation. Although I assumed that this was only an “Allied” War Memorial (i.e. British, Indian, and Australian) I was pleased to find that fallen soldiers of all nationalities and religions are honored here, including Muslim Malays (with their graves facing towards Mecca), the local resistance, civilians, etc.

Of note, Ivan Lyon of Operation Rimau is memorialized here (27.A.14) as are a few soldiers from the Prince of Wales and Repulse (to the left of the Memorial in the semi-circular graves) and numerous Unknown Soldiers.

It was a privilege to walk these grounds in private reflection and I consider this visit the highlight of my trip to the country."
,,A time to reflect.,5.0,,"As an Australian whose Grandfather is buried at Kranji, this incredible site and monument to fallen Allied soldiers was a must see on my trip to Singapore. Beautifully maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the gently sloping hill displays the graves of nearly 4,500 souls, and the memorial walls some 25,000 plus names of allied servicemen and women whose bodies were never recovered. These are staggering numbers, and it is an intense reminder of the needless waste of human life that wars can cause. This is a very emotional experience for anyone who has relatives buried or memorialised here, however, I would encourage anyone with a fleeting interest in history or those from allied countries to visit and pay respect to the men and women who fought to maintain the freedom we enjoy today."
