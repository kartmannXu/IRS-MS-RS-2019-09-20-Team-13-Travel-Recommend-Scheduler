,,To become amazing,3.0,,These will be amazing when they are fully covered by plants. At this stage they are only around a third covered. The light show each night is nice to see but not really worth going out of your way to catch them.
,,Fabulous super trees,5.0,,"It was amazing to be moving along the walkway up near the top of the Supertrees and what a great view of the Gardens by the Bay, The Marina Sands Skypark ""ship"" and the cityscape of Singapore."
,,Supertree Grove,5.0,,Went to the Supertree Grove during the day and the super trees were incredible. I later went back in the evening to see the light show and was more than impressed. A great show of technology and plants. There isn't a bad seat in the house!
,,Beautiful,5.0,,We visited around 7 and saw the light show. It was breathtaking. The music and light were perfectly choreographed. To go and walk the boardwalk between trees at night was stunning. A must see.
,,Toy Story 4 Night Show,5.0,,"The Grove was transformed into a miniature theme park dedicated to the new Toy Story 4 movie. They did a major investment in designing the rides (including a roller coaster) and detailing all the booths. Buzz, Woody and most of the characters were scattered throughout so lots of photo ops.

I came at night so I missed the Toy Story 4 rides and character visits. However I did get to enjoy the Toy Story 4 sound and light show. It was well done and entertaining, nicely integrated with the super trees.

Beyond the main group was a smaller Silver Grove which was quite educational with a good explanation of how the various sites interact together to form a sustainable ecosystem.

Exploring the area was easy with lots of walking pathways in and around the trees and along the water. Much less people were by the water front.

Next time I hope to get here earlier so I can take in the views from the elevated walkway."
,,Unique,5.0,,"Its an unique place, trees are unique, the light show is unique, the whole atmosphere is really nice. Visit after sunset to enjoy to the fullest."
,,Stunning light and sound show,5.0,,We were so impressed with the light and sound show and even with a big crowd we were still able to find a good place to view the specatacle. I can't recommend it enough but be early if you want to be able to sit down!
,,Impressive light show with music,5.0,,"This show was quiet impressive. Get there early to get a good viewing angle and seat on the steps.

If you are going to do the skywalk it might be a good idea to plan to walk when the light show is going on as the view from up top is quite magnificent."
,,Gardens by Night,5.0,,The Supertree Grove is the free highlight of the Gardens by Bay and the night show is the best experience. It is usually busy so don't be late and allow plenty of time for leaving as the paths are narrow and there are a lot of people.
,,Avatar Trees,5.0,,These trees were symbol of modern architectures. Fantastic to see how much effort the creators has put. Nigh time light show is a spectacular event to watch.
,,Night show,5.0,,"Come in early to reserve a good spot for the night show at 7:45, good music with light shows all round. Best part of it it’s free!"
,,Impressive,5.0,,The bridge between the trees is located at a height of ´only’ 22 meters but nevertheless it is impressive. In the evening the light effects are very nice.
,,Excellent,5.0,,It was great to be able to go up on the board walk and it is wheel chair accessible. One of the few times a wheel chair user can get up so high. Don't miss the light display at night
,,Magical - A Real Highlight During our Stay,5.0,,"The trees are impressive in the day and we enjoyed the skywalk, however it’s at night that they are truly magical. Standing amongst the trees seeing the lights, and listening to the music is enough to give you goosebumps. Definitely not to be missed.

We also watched from the top of MBS - the lights could be clearly seen but you are unable to hear the music so nowhere near as impressive."
,,Colossal Supertrees glowed & glimmered at night,5.0,,"Gardens by the Bay Supertrees: gigantic, colossal towering steel trees. Ascend some trees, view panoramic 360-degree expanse picking out the various attactions. OCBC aerial skyway is a steel-mesh, elevated walkway from tree to tree, very cool, suspended 22 metres up, high above the crowds. I have gait/walking challenges (stroke), all sightseeing has to be well-researched and not overly taxing; I wear a legbrace. It was hot when we were there, bring hats, water, wear comfy shoes. Views: are the impressive Marina Bay Sands hotel, Singapore Flyer, many different domes of the Gardens. Music (Garden Rhapsody) and Light show at dusk each night, check the show times. Too many sights to do in GBTB; we picked 2 or 3, as we only had a short stopover. Train, bus, taxi, various ways to get there. Well worth it."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,I love the whole Gardens by the Bay but especially the Supertree Grove. They are just so pretty. At night they light them with beautiful colours.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Truly a wonderful experience and not one to be missed. Best viewed from level one. Take the stairs behind the information box and it’s just a short walk.
,,Go only in the night,5.0,,I was told that when this was being built everyone thought it was pillars for a elevated road. But it turned into something spectacular. It's a great sight to be seen and is well worth it in the evening and night. The sound and light show is just mesmerizing and shouldn't be missed for anything.
,,Such a beautiful place.,5.0,,"The Supertrees are a manmade marvel. Whoever came up with this concept is amazing. I have visited both during the day time and also at night. I must say that the sound and light show, Garden Rhapsody, each evening is stunning. I just wish the 15-minute show went for longer! If you have time spend a few extra dollars and walk across the Skyway, the walkway that is between two of the trees. It's well worth it.
Because the light show is free and easily accessible you can't control the crowds that are going to be there so try to get there a little early, take a seat and enjoy!
The Supertrees are surrounded by vast gardens that are also very beautiful. Don't forget to take some water with you for the walk as the humidity can be very exhausting."
,,Lights Music Relax,5.0,,This is quite a show piece for Singapore and whilst bordering on the overtly designed for tourist attractions it is just one that is worth experiencing if you are in Singapore. The super grove trees are just a great design.
,,Amazing Structures,5.0,,"The large metal structures, looking something like triffids are used to house a whole growing structure that ends up looking rather like trees, made up of various plants & creepers to make a living structure. The also collect water within them to help water their living structure, some are also linked by an aerial walkway – at the base there is also an educational story to help inform the public of the whole cycle of plant life & how it serves the planet. Part of the whole gardens that make this such a special & worthwhile place to visit."
,,Absolutely blissful - perfect way to wind down after a day in the heat.,5.0,,"After a disappointing visit 6 weeks earlier, on our way home from Europe we tried again & saw the Garden Rhapsody show this time. It was just as wonderful as we'd hoped - & just what we needed after a busy day (& busy holiday)! We found a spot on the grassy patch as the sun went down, lay down & thoroughly enjoyed the music & lights. Even walking through the Gardens by the Bay afterwards was beautiful. The grassy patch gave us a perfect view of the entire Supertree Grove & was very comfortable. Fantastic that it's free. Totally unmissable."
,,Twinkle,5.0,,"Located in the garden by the bay, you will take a walk and watch these giant trees from above, they are really sparkling."
,,Amazing Night at Super Tree grove,4.0,,"Visited with my friends i met in the hostel, during the night and the lights and music is so cool.. Its so fun to watch the light changes so as the music.. I have so much here and great experience.."
,,gorgeous,4.0,,It is a neat grove separated into areas. Each area has a description and things are labeled. It is beautiful.
,,Very good,5.0,,You get nice views from the supertree grove and they are amazing structures but you ahve to pay and I think it was 19 singapore dollars each the walk is actually quite short but you do get good veiws of the park below
,,HUGE QUES to enter,2.0,,"Lovely display of flowers, but very crowded inside. I don't really get the fake trees ...nothing beats nature"
,,Went to watch the lightshow at night,5.0,,"Definitely more beautiful at night with all the lights. at 7.45pm and 8.45pm there are light shows with musical themes that change from time to time, completely free so highly recommended to go."
,,try to go there,5.0,,i still have so many pictures of this place. because i have never seen a place like this i my life . very recommended
,,Don't miss the evening night show,5.0,,"The evening sound & light show in the Supertree Grove is amazing. The lighting effects, accompanied by beautiful music bring the supertree's to life."
,,Night is best!!,3.0,,"My partner and I love visiting the gardens and thoroughly enjoyed gardens by the bay as a whole, however we feel the supergrove trees and over head walk is best done in the evening.

My partner and I arrived 5:30 here to enjoy walking around the supergrove trees during the day light and doing the sky walk before staying for the light show.

We could not fault the show at all and found it spectacular. A short 15min show was worth making the trip, but the super grove trees aren't much to rave about in daylight compared to the rest of the gardens!

We highly recommend thinking about whether you wanna see the view from the sky walk here as if not then book in for the night walk and watch the light show from above, Or do the walk at sunset then lay down on the ground after to watch the art of light and sound."
,,Day n Night Visit.,5.0,,"If visiting the Marina Bay Gardens, you can experience the 'high walk' during the day, but this area comes alive at night!
A spectacular laser light show accompanied by classical music, well, on the night we were there, but it does change. Maybe no rap though!"
,,Mesmerizing,5.0,,This place is located near the Marina sand area. It has different looks in day and in night.Lighting is very charming.
,,Gotta Go,5.0,,"If you are in the area, make sure you go at night to see the lights. The light show is very well done and currently consists of classical music. It is a visual and auditory delight."
,,Supertrees,5.0,,A great area and the view from the tree walk is very interesting. we walk all around the garden and took the lift to go to the information area where the gift shop is.
,,Fabulous,5.0,,Go in the late afternoon to experience it in day light but make sure you hang around for the light show at 7.45pm everynight. You will not be disappointed. Relax afterwards and have a drink at the hospitality outlets as you won't like the crouds trying toget the MRT or Taxis.
,,Amazing Sight,5.0,,Its one of the Must place to visit when you are in Singapore. A great place to relax. Worth seeing the light show at night.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,We were so lucky to be on the balcony after visiting the gardens all day and saw the most beautiful light show.
,,A must see if music and lights are your thing,5.0,,"I'm a big fan of lights. The beauty of lights lit up against the night sky is awesome. This light display will not disappoint. Get swept away with the music and the dazzling light display. It is a free attraction, so why not. If you have time, I would recommend visiting the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome before. The show is set at certain times. I can't remember from the top of my head, but google will be your friend ;)

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

p.s. can get crowded so get there a little early and find a nice spot to sit."
,,Architectural and horticultural wonder,4.0,,"These super trees are definitely spectacular, and you can view them for free as a part of gardens by the bay. At night there is a fun light and music show which you can also watch for free. If you want to go on the skywalk, it is about eight dollars, and many people say they love it, especially if you can time it to be at night during the show, though it can get rather crowded then."
,,Beautiful by night,4.0,,"Because it was inside Garden by the Bay so the same thing for me, but the light show was worth seeing and you could climb and enjoy the view on the balcony there."
,,amazing,5.0,,Wonderfull construction that will be fully covered within a couple of years with a wide variety of flowers.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"A fantastic and amazing sight in the middle of Singapore. And it’s free! The combination of amazing structures, lights and music was incredible. If in Singapore this is a real must do, especially at night."
,,Stunning Views of Marina Bay,5.0,,"Part of Marina Bay Gardens Complex, is a suspended walk way above the ornamental trees. Can be done during the day or evening. I was a little disappointed that we had to use the lift to the top, I would have preferred to walk up the steps.At the top well worth it for the stunning views."
,,stunning,5.0,,the light show is amazing. 15 mins of non stop great light show twice a night. show runs to the music. just amazing. worth the watch. had dinner at satay by the bay before.
,,A must see,5.0,,"If you come to the Gardens by the Bay, you MUST see the super tree bloom and all the lights at night. Spectacular!"
,,The light show was amazing.,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our day at the Gardens by the Bay. We wandered through the domes and the grounds, we enjoyed a very reasonable meal at their cafe and I must say the light show is one of the best I have ever seen. With the Marina Bay Sands in the background the lighting show on the trees was so good! We didnt get to walk on the walkway this time as the line was too long, but we were there at the busy time, from 4pm onwards."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Great area to explore. The Sky Walk is a must between the supertrees. Easy access by lift with outstanding views of Marina Bay
,,Really Super,5.0,,The tree grove creates miracle with the sun set and start of light and sound show. Excellent place to spend time in the evening.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"A must do. Get there a little early for the light show and bring a small pillow. To get the most out of the experience, you do lie down."
,,Pretty Amazing,5.0,,"The entire set up of these super trees is pretty amazing and very impressive. One can see it from far but only when you get close you realize the size, structure and design. Going by elevator to the top and then going along the hanging bridge is great. At nightfall there is an amazing light and sound show, all worth waiting for so plan your visit accordingly."
,,This is a must do while in Singapore!,5.0,,"While you can visit the ""Grove"" during the day, the BEST time to visit is during the 7:45 or 8:45 shows at night. Basically it's a 15 minute light show with music like you have never seen before.For those of you that saw the movie Crazy Rich Asians, the wedding reception scene took place in the Supertree Grove. To really understand what the Grove is I suggest that you YouTube ""Gardens by the Bay Supertree light show"" and you will better understand what the Grove is all about.
NOTE: this light show should not be confused with the Bay Light Show that is located on the other side of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in the Marina Bay. That too is great to see."
,,Chutney Mary - Great for Indian Food,5.0,,"This restaurant serves some real authentic Indian snacks. We tried pav bhaji, dosa, masala tea all are highly recommended. The Supertree food court is quite crowded on weekends, so getting a table would be a challenge. But is the only dining area with diverse eating options inside gardens by the bay."
,,Fantastic Vantage Point for the main landmarks of the Garden City!,4.0,,"The OCBC Skyway (bridge) offers a breathtaking view of the Marina Bay area, and its surrounding landmarks. Balmy, and comfortable stroll to enjoy the 360 deg views of the picturesque park, and the vicinity. Great visit!"
,,Spectacular at night,5.0,,"The supertrees are metall trees (19 pieces) with different ecological tasks: collecting rain water, turning sunlight into illumination at night by solar panels and some are exhausters. At night (7,45 and 8:45 p.m. the is a light and music show ith illumination of the trees and a ballet of sparkling lights. There is a treetop walkthat connect 3 trees in middle heights for 8 sgd."
,,Little disappointed but still good,4.0,,"We had seen the lights last year and through they were amazing, this year unfortunately even though we stood in the same place the sound was not as good. Because of this flashing lights without sound just doesn't have the same feel to it. Still a nice evening and a beautiful place. I would suggest to find a spot fairly close to the lights and look up."
,,Best to see by night!,5.0,,This attraction if for free unless you wanted to walk at the OCBC Skyway. I suggest visiting this during the night to see the lights show. Check their website to see the schedule. Go ahead of time to have your best spot as this can get very crowded during the show. Highly recommended!
,,"Awesome super trees, but very busy.",3.0,,"No surprises, it is one of the most popular tourist spots, so very busy and touristy, but the supertrees are pretty awesome to see, especially at night."
,,Light show and walk,5.0,,"We did the tree walk during the day so you can see the city. It is worth the entry fee for sure and I’d recommend it so long as you are not scared of heights!

In the evening we returned and found our place on the floor for the best light show on the planet. I’ve been here twice now and it is fabulous. Best light show I’ve ever seen - if you do one thing in Singapore, see the light show."
,,Astounding,5.0,,How do mere words do justice to the cleverest and most astounding sound and light show on planet earth outside of Disney? Twice each evening you are treated to a fantasia of creativity that adorn these (technically speaking) air-con chimneys. Covered in plants and lights you would never know. The programme is continuously changing round the year - and you can imagine how superb it is once they've added even more at Christmas ! All free.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,We went to see it both in the day time and at night. It is well worth seeing it especially when there is a light show of them. A must see.
,,Supertree Grove,5.0,,"See the most exciting high light show up in the trees to music, you could see in the eyes of children of all ages the magic of the event, don't miss this one ot you will be kicking your self for a long time after."
,,Jaw dropping vision,5.0,,"This place is like something out of science fiction film, well designed and arranged to keep visitors marvelling at visionary beauty."
,,Light show way better than what I expected,5.0,,"We did the platform walk, whilst busy at dusk it was well organised & the que moved although I think we waited about a half hour ... Great views.

Wasn’t intending to stay for the light show but we caught the beginning of it & stayed a bit longer. It was lovey."
,,Must see light show,5.0,,The light show in the evening is a must see. My fiancé and I laid under the super trees and watched the light show. It was a lovely atmosphere.
,,Good but can be great,3.0,,"These trees are such a nice structure created but the evening lighting program is not that structured and not so interesting. It can have a theme, a story or anything else to make it really interesting."
,,Stunning,5.0,,The evening light show here is well worth the visit. It gets very crowded and people do gather early to get the best view. I was not enamoured with the theme for the night we were there but the lights were spectacular
,,EXCELLENT,5.0,,Excellent not to be missed. Awe inspiring from start to finish. Amazing presentation. Don't miss this.
,,An elvating experience,5.0,,"This was a must do for one of my kids and we re-lived some of the Crazy Rich Asians movie set...the gardens are refreshing with a cool breeze, and very well manicured."
,,What a sight!,5.0,,"I could have just sat under these ""trees"" all day - I think I nearly did. Took so many photos, just a beautiful thing to see. Gardens By The Bay is a must visit on your trip to Singapore. We walked across from Marina Bay and waited under these spectacular trees for the bus line to leave. So easy to get around, the bus goes into the gardens and picks you back up from this beautiful spot. Really hard to leave!"
,,Insanely crowded futuristic trees,5.0,,Irony how we hoard around artificial trees when we can care for real ones hmm. Be sure to catch the sound & light show and be prepared for the insane crowd. The skywalk has a fee but it is worth the price and best to catch the last group as it is less crowded and you can spend a longer while up there.
,,Lovely Park!,4.0,,"This is a lovely park to walk around in with plenty of nature to enjoy. The super trees are very futuristic - reminding me of Avatar and the foliage climbing up the structures strikes a nice balance. It's also FREE to walk around unless you go into the OCBC walkway or the into the domes. Missed the light show since I came during the day.

Tip: You can also buy a shuttle ticket at the ticket booth if you just don't want to walk."
,,Light show extravaganza!,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is absolutely breathtaking. The light show is perfectly fitted to the music that is played.
Recently I visited the symphony of lights in Hong Kong and was left disappointed. However this light show ticked all the boxes.
Amazing work! Haven’t stopped talking about it and recommending to people!
10/10"
,,Beautiful !!!,5.0,,A mesmerizing place to vertical gardens. Light & Sonnd Show (2 shows) every evening free of cost. Must Watch !!!
,,Super Tree Lighting Show,4.0,,The Super Tree Lighting Show is suitable for both Adults and Children. It provided a carnival atmosphere ideal for a family outing.
,,Man made wonder,5.0,,"The super tree grove is another man made wonder within Gardens by the bay.
Tall metal trees with a lot of flora around look really pretty.
You must watch the light and sound show here.
The trees look magical.
Do climb up and walk across the skywalk. It's a wonderful experience.
Must visit here!"
,,Magical and Beautiful!,5.0,,"Magical and beautiful! The walking trails leading to it are well lit, and the pathways are wide and easy to walk on. We think it’s the best part of Gardens by the Bay … and it’s free!"
,,Lightening fast,5.0,,It was an amazing feeling to watch the light and sound show through the OCBC Skyway that gives you a closer look of the Supertrees from top and the hanging skyway puts more adventure to that
,,Awesome!,5.0,,The Supertree Grove was my favorite part of Gardens by the Bay! We saw the evening light show first from Marina Bay and then sitting in the middle of the grove and it was fabulous!
,,Lovely gardens day and night,5.0,,still not sure why these were built but they are amazing - we were lucky enough to stay at Marina Bay Sands and saw these from on the gound and also from the 66th floor. The different gardens are so lovely. people also selling icecreams and drinks along with 'hot dog buns' - with hot dog sausage in them!
,,A.M.A.Z.I.N.G,5.0,,What a fantastic and almost surreal place to visit. Go during the day to see just how beautiful these trees are and then visit again at night to see the light show - it's like being in Avatar!
,,Crazy Art!,4.0,,"Like everything else here, this was first-rate. Gigantic dynamic art, be sure to do the elevated walkway."
,,Stunning - colours are so vibrant.,4.0,,I walked through here in the early morning and was constantly astounded by the colours and size of the supertree's - I would definitely want to visit here as part of the Gardens by the Bay.
,,Famous!,5.0,,Not as busy as we expected which was quite nice and the evening light show is entertaining! Relaxing after a long flight from the UK! You have to go as it is the famous view of Singapore!
,,Very nice,5.0,,"Great for a night walk, feel yourself like in Avatar movie Walk around the trees, absorb the vibes, listen to the music....very nice experience"
,,Night time light and music show is a Singapore must-do,5.0,,We timed our visit to Gardens By the Bay to ensure we finished up in time to experience the 7.45pm lights and music show. The theme was '70s Retro and was a blast! We really enjoyed every moment of the display. If you are visiting Singapore please ensure you make time to see the Supertree Grove at night.
,,Cant say enough about this place,5.0,,We saw this on every botanical garden literature and best in places in world to visit. It met the expectations. The laser show at night is truly amazing.
,,Biggest Tree on Garden City,5.0,,"It is so easy to reach, just follow the map when you arrive in front of garden by the bay area. If you wanna take MRT, just stop on Bayfront st, then see on the left side there is a sign to garden by the bay area. After that just follow the map. Thanks"
,,Must come for the evening light show!,5.0,,"The evening light show was one of the highlights of our Southeast Asia visit! There's plenty of room to lay down or sit up and take in one of the best light shows you'll ever see. Comes with the ticket for the equally impressive Gardens complex, this outing is the perfect way to finish a day and take in some wonder just as the sun goes down and the heat starts to break."
,,Great views,4.0,,"Personally I didn't go along the walkway because I have a fear of heights and the walkway, although perfectly safe, was a little too bouncy for me. It is only a short walk though."
,,Lovely to Visit,4.0,,"These are well worth a walk round - they are amazing to look at from a distance perhaps rather than close up but the whole Marina Bay area is huge park so it is easy just to walk round and enjoy close up or from a distance. My hot tip is to go late afternoon and see the light show in the evening, i think its around 7.30 - check this though. The show is spectacular and great fun as these super trees are lit up to the beat of the music - it was a retro theme when we went, and altogether brilliant - no pun intended. Completely free to enjoy and in the heat of the evening perfect."
,,Stunning day or night!,5.0,,"If you have the time to visit this attraction while
in Singapore both day and night time , it is well worth doing so. You can walk around these techno trees at ground level or can pay to access the walk way up in the sky. These impressive structures dominate the skyline in the gardens and the twice nightly light show is great."
,,Must see,5.0,,"Both during the day and especially at night, these trees are unbelievably magical! Definitely watch the night musical show"
,,Photos better then being there,3.0,,"Feels a little like ""Avatar"" to see the photos. the light show with music is a free show and pales by comparison to the light and water show on the other side of the casino. OK to do, and free but not worth walking across town to see. Music was a little cheesy"
,,Great sound and light show,5.0,,"We arrived about half an hour before the start of the night show, but the little available seating was already taken. When the sun went down, the show began, with lovely lighting and an assortment of music. The show was quite short, but it was certainly worth the trip (especially as it wasn't raining!). Nice ambience amongst the crowd. It seemed that some people were still inside the Gardens by the Bay area, and were walking way above us on the skyway, but the views from below were terrific too."
,,Spectacular light show,5.0,,2nd visit & thought the Retro Rhapsody theme to the light show was excellent. Would highly recommend a visit as a ‘must do” either during the day or night. Lovely to eat at Satay on the Bay first & then wander along to the Super Trees & enjoy spectacular & free entertainment suitable for anyone
,,Night light show,3.0,,"This was a nice night activity, It was really busy and I struggled with the crowds and humidity but the choreographed music was awesome and worth a visit. The queue for the skyway was HUGE and I would not even bother buying a ticket during the night show. Do the skywalk during the day."
,,Lovely during early evening,4.0,,"There isn't a whole lot to the skywalk and light-show at supertree grove but the atmosphere and ambiance is worth experiencing. The queues and ticket process to get up to the short skywalk is rather inefficient and could really be improved but if you're only in Singapore for a short time, it is probably worth doing it anyway! Just manage you're expectations!"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Worth going up these elevated structures and their suspended bridges that offer a stunning view of the gardens and of Marina Bay.
,,Walk among the trees a uniqye experience,4.0,,Giant weird artificial trees. Fun to walk amongst them. Fun photo ops in this surreal little parkscape.
,,High and mighty,5.0,,Just like the other features in the Gardens by the Bay park the Supertree Grove is sight to behold. Be sure not to miss the evening light shows. If possible arrange a visit to the Skywalk for this show.
,,Entertainment,5.0,,The right spot to finish an amazing day with watching the sound and lightshow. The park and the surroundings (Marina Bay Sands and Singapure flyer) a place to relax.
,,The light show is spectacular!,5.0,,We paid to walk around the Supertree Grove in the daylight and that alone was magnificent. Then at night we sat below and watched the light show ~ so much better than fireworks and the music was coordinated with the light show.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"The super trees are fantastic to see in the day and stay on for the light show set to music it is stunning. We paid to go on the walkway, wonderful views and well worth doing."
,,Good for a visit,3.0,,"We walked from our hotel nearby in the afternoon, not much crowded. Good to see their ability to create impressive places in Singapore."
,,Must see the evening show,5.0,,Get yourself down here for one of the 2 evening shows and you will not be dissapointed. Its a fantastic light show with a terrific music track to match
,,Great Night Show,5.0,,Well worth attending the night light show. It was a colourful magical place. The light and sound show as amazing.
,,Worth a visit day and night,5.0,,We came to see the evening light and sound show and enjoyed this very much. We also came during the day and had a very pleasant visit.
,,Brilliant evening experience,5.0,,"Our visit to Gardens by the Bay was one of the highlights of our visit to Singapore. The best time to visit the Supertree Grove is in the evening as it starts to get dark, around blue hour time. So a good itinerary would be to visit the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest beforehand (and possibly the ArtScience Museum if you have the energy) and then arrive a the Supertree Grove just before it lights up.

When we visited we arrived just before the 70's Disco Music light show started and geez it was pretty amazing. People were sitting down or lying down all over the place looking up at the trees as the light show progressed. I don't know exactly how long the show lasted but it must have been at least twenty minutes long or maybe half an hour. Tripods, selfie sticks and monopods are allowed here but after carrying a tripod around for a couple of hours we finally didn't use it, plus at the Supertree Grove it does get fairly crowded.

Gardens by the Bay is truly a wonderful place for everyone to visit. There is just so much to see and do and nobody should miss it. The light show at the Supertree Grove was the grand finale and was amazing. Furthermore, the taxi stand is really close and it was easy to get one."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Lovely viewing by day in a lush, green landscape, but really comes to life at night - views from the Skyway at dusk are just beautiful, and the free Garden Rhapsody light & music show is brilliant! Boogie Wonderland the evening we visited, had everyone rocking along - I was just disappointed nobody was dancing because I wanted to
Was absolutely the highlight of our holiday, don’t miss it."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"By day they do look like normal trrees, but at night they light up and dance to music. A must see when in Singapore"
,,"Wow, Wow, Wow, Did I say Wow!!??",5.0,,"A simply spectacular light show to see, with perfectly choreographed music. The whole audience sat in silence and took in this mesmerizing experience with awe.
This is something special to see, and you could enjoy it for hours, if it only lasted that long!

Do not miss when going to Singapore as it is one of the Signature events for everyone, of every age, to enjoy."
,,In the promises of Garden by the Bay,4.0,,"These man made trees are quite imposing and well constructed.To make them more interesting, some construction should be added stop accommodate some wild life live exhibit in them."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,I think this was one of the highlights of my trip. I agree with some of the other reviews that they are maybe a bit bland during the day so you really really must go at night too. It’s great to be there as the sun is going down and the lights start to come on. Then stay for the light show! Really worthwhile.
,,Wow!,5.0,,This place is spectacular! It's free to visit and to watch the trees come alive to music is nothing short of amazing! I would highly recommend visiting here to see the light show.
,,Breath taking,5.0,,"Visited both during the day and back for light display the next night, both free, the trees provide a flue for the power plant , water collection and solar panels for powering the light show and more i would think"
,,Make sure you go to the light show,5.0,,"By day the Supertree Grove is a bit disappointing and unspectacular. The experience is improved by going up to the walkway to get a closer view of the 'trees' and see the gardens from a different point of view.
At night, the Garden Rhapsody light show is spectacular and really worth going to. The music and lights were perfectly coordinated and provide an exciting experience in a great setting. Make sure you go to the llight show."
,,Night time light show,5.0,,"Amazing experience lying down under the trees relaxing listening to the music and watching the fabulous light, only 15 minutes which was perfect, well worth a visit"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Well worth a visit - day or night - free entry - plenty of food outlets prices reasonable. Does get very busy - to comfortable in the Singapore heat. Would recommend and visit again
,,Glorious. Must must do,5.0,,"Visited during the day when the trees were impressive and you could see how nature was growing round the man made structures. The walkway for $8 was well worth it to see closer up and from a different angle.

We then visited at night for the light show. TA forums said find somewhere to lie down and look up at the light show and we joined the masses to do just that. Absolutely fabulous. The show might have been over quite quickly, but it was certainly time well spent. Really glad that we made sure we saw this display."
,,Most Fantastic,5.0,,"These man made trees are spectacular especially during the evening presentation coupled with music. Star Wars was the theme when we were there. All the millions of lights danced to the music. we were in Awe. It's only 15 minutes long, but well worth the wait. They have a food court and is pretty new. Has all kinds of foods, but beware of the Vietnamese restaurant.
Hard to find any meat in the Pho and what little was there was all fat and grissle...stick to chicken"
,,Mind blowing,5.0,,"Amazing concept, incredible structures. Visit at dusk, watch the structures light up, finalising with light and music show"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I’ve already included this in a review of gardens by the bay but then saw this separate review. We absolutely loved doing the skywalk the views are amazing, as others might have already said the walk ways do move slightly and we did see a few people not enjoying it as much as us because of how high up you are , we loved the experience and would definitely recommend."
,,As good in reality as on photos,5.0,,"Well, it's one of the most iconic places in Singapore and everyone seen possibly hundreds of pictures of the grove. It looks just as impressive in reality and IMO is absolutely a ""must visit"" attraction. Walking around is free, walkways on top will cost you just $8, which, again, in my opinion, is totally worth the price, as you'll enjoy some alternative views of the gardens and the Skypark building.

Worth visiting both during the day when you can see well all the green flowery structure of the ""trees"", and after dark when the lights come on. The place is really crowded for the light show well in advance, so pick your timing wisely. During the day when we visited the queue was about 10 minutes or so, not a big deal."
,,"We came both in the day and night, it was worth it.",4.0,,"We saw Supertree Grove in the daytime when we went to see the rest of Gardens by the Bay and it was stunning, but we think it was even better when you go at around 8pm at night time for the lights and music show that goes on on the trees, very impressive and fun to see."
,,Fab!,5.0,,Great music and light show. Highly recommenced! Relaxing evening entertainment and free! an get a little crowded but great visibility from most places inside the grove x
,,Supertree Grove,3.0,,"We went to the gardens to see the supertree grove and found it a little disappointing. There is a ""showtime"" I think twice a night where the canopy is lit up - outside these times it is not lit (but the trunk is).
They play random snatches of very old music with the show that feels a bit ad hoc.
Many people queue up, claiming spaces on the steps and other prime spots well before the show - and once it starts it is a bit of a jostle to get a good view.
I was struck by how many people watch the show through their phone - they aren't there experiencing it in person! It is much better in real life, your phone is a poor substitute for the lights.
I couldn't help but think they could leverage the structures in place by having them lit up throughout the night."
,,Nighttime destination,5.0,,"The trees looked green & great that afternoon we were there, too bad we were so tired that we missed the opportunity to see the them lighted by dusk. Plan on visiting the Marina area by late afternoon till nighttime."
,,excellent,5.0,,"night show must see take the grass if not your neck hurts, you can not stop watching it is not long, but fun and nice"
,,Night performance,5.0,,Don’t miss the night performance with the light and sound show - make sure you get there early to get a great view - it’s also free
,,Amazing structures that light up at night,5.0,,A mass of artificial trees with vegetation and a skywalk above connecting the domes and offering stunning view of Singapore. The sound and light display begins in the evening.. A joy to watch and be prepared to be awestruck by the spectacular before you.
,,A Visual Delight,5.0,,"What an amazing experience. The music accompanied light show was phenomenal. The 80-160 ft tall vertically planted ""trees"" were covered in lights that changed color throughout the show. Worth every minute. Great for kids."
,,Visually interesting,4.0,,"Visually interesting during the day, but a real treat in the evening during the light show. For that you need to get there early to find a good place to lay down under the trees so you can look up."
,,Simply Amazing,5.0,,What an amazing place both at day and at night time as well. It is great to see a government actually putting some plans into action and benefiting from the number of tourists this area attracts. It is very beautiful and worth the admission fee.
,,Beautiful tree at night,5.0,,This place is part of Garden by The Bay. It's beautiful when it's dark because the LED light would come on and it changes colour.
,,What a Fantastic Light Show to Music,5.0,,"I was 5 mins late for the 745pm show. There was already tons of people sitting on the steps leading to the Super Trees. The selection of music is so party mode, quite a few people were dancing and swaying to the beat. It was simply amazing play of colors and hues, very creative totally spectacular. I will be back again."
,,beautiful lights,4.0,,The light show at night with music is really beautiful. During the day it's not much to see but I would recommend it at night.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"There are 2 shows each night and it is very spectacular so a must-see if you are in Singapore. The show is free but you can also take a lift up to the walkway between a the trees which costs about $8. This can be quite crowded and when I was there, there was a lot of pushing in by an Indian family who obviously thought they were too important to queue up and wait like everyone else. The light show is done to music and is brilliant. When it's over, it becomes very crowded trying to exit so wait awhile for the crowd to disperse and if you are going back to the Marina Bay Sands hotel, take the turn off to the Bayfront MRT because it's less crowded than the walk way directly to the hotel."
,,Definite MUST,5.0,,"A definite must-see during your stay in Singapore, this night show will not disappoint. Great for all the family to enjoy, this free show operates 2 times a night, once at 7:45 and the other at 8:45pm. Simply alight at the Bayfront MRT and follow the directions to Gardens By The Bay. Once there, Follow the signs to the Supertree Grove. Be advised that this can get a little busy, so it’s best to arrive with plenty of time to find a spot to sit. The show itself is very well designed and extremely colourful. Once finished, it’s best to let the crowds disperse before exiting, as this can be a little chaotic."
,,Real Life Avatar!,5.0,,The Supertree Grove is one of our favourite places in Singapore! Amazing structures! Amazing views! It’s like a real life set from Avatar! The £4.50 each to walk the skywalk is well worth every penny!
,,Amazing,3.0,,These big artificial trees with lush greenery growing up the outside and hanging from the ‘trees’ certainly add to the park
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"strong recommend the light show. we got there around 7pm. the show starts at 745 and the place was already pretty packed. though you can always find the spot if you don't mind standing or sitting on the ground. the show was amazing. with the back drop of sands hotel and other singapore skyline, we were very impressed."
,,Must see,5.0,,Be sure to go at night & see this coordinated musical light show - It is outstanding! The show changes regularly.
,,A fabulous nightly free sound and light show,5.0,,"We visted Gardens on the Bay several times. We especially liked the 7.45 pm nightly free sound and lights show. This gets quite busy as lots of coaches arrive with tourists to see this spectacle. We had the benefit of watching it from our room on the 27th floor of The Marina Bay Sands hotel, from where we had an absolutely superb view. We also went into the gardens one evening to watch it as the atmosphere is magic and you can hear the music much better than from the hotel. Supertree grove is also great to walk around in the day when there are no crowds if you don't have time to visit in the evening."
,,Techno Park,5.0,,"Informative and educational ! At the par you will different species of exotic flower , tree , ornamental plants and metallic sculptures."
,,Awesome 👏,5.0,,"Spent a couple of hours wandering around the gardens then did the Skywalk, big of a wait but worth it, we’d heard about the light show but had no details so hung around until the first one started at 7.45, not sure what it was but it totally got to me, probably due to the 80s music that was playing which was my era, the whole show from start to finish was breathtaking & so cleverly constructed, never seen anything like it, totally unique & free to watch, 2nd show an hour later at 8.45.

If you want a good spot sit in front of the largest of the trees which is directly in front of the skywalk, oh & buy your return train ticket before coming in to save standing in silly queues, you’ll thank me for it as it’ll save you over an hour!

If there’s one thing you need to do in Singapore, it’s watch this show!"
,,"There is engineering and engineering, this is a work of art.",5.0,,"Do you look on this as a clever bit of engineering, a garden to equal the Chelsea flower show or a thrilling walk through the sky? All three! Ok you pay for the experience but dont let that put you off.The sky walk is brilliant, lift to the top and turn left.. Only 70 people officially allowed on at a time, although it looked more when we were on it. Warning, it sways slightly. You are asked to limit your visit time when it's busy but we were lucky and had plenty of time. The planting on the sides of the ""trees"" is so clever it's a gardeners dream. Would I reccomend? Definitely! Then when you come down go to the air conditioned food area and have a cooling drink."
,,Lights,5.0,,"I thought I'd give the light show a go as I wasn't sure, but it was totally worth it. They run at 7:45pm and 8:45pm and I think and extra one on weekends. The light show is impressive and is defninitly worth seeing."
,,Fantastic light show,5.0,,Very busy at night getting a taxi out can take a while but the taxis keep coming so the queue moves relatively quickly. Get there early enough to get a seat .Well worth going.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Incredibly large tree-like structures with lighting and shows to steal your breath away! I love this part of Singapore
,,A must see - esp at night,5.0,,Night time is the time to visit the Supertree grove as they have a fabulous light show combined with music - in our case it was Opera and it was magnificent to watch the show which lasted about 15 mins. It is worth getting a spot early as it is really popular with the locals and tourists alike.
,,Fantasy Land ... Crazy Rich Asians,5.0,,"I had heard about the trees and seen them in the fun movie Crazy Rich Asians. They are majestuous during day time and magical at night. Make sure you chose a place out of the way and early since many late people continue walking all over you past the start of the show, which is quite annoying. The show is free - you only need to pay to visit the domes. The music is fun, 80's like."
,,Nice. Day or night.,5.0,,"A unique attraction. Fun to walk around. The evening show draws a crowd, and it starts to gather more than a hour prior."
,,Unique,5.0,,Truly original and a great place to scoot about on a hired electric scooter. Great lightshow every evening. Nice open spaces. The design is fun and there are many attractions nearby. It gets hot so water with you wherever you go.
,,Very cool!,5.0,,"Lights, sounds and the surrounding made this a wonderful experience for both old and young. The trees were great to walk around and if you get tix to the OSBC walkway, it is worth the visit. Keep in mind, they do limit how many people can go up (most likely limited to the one tiny elevator), but grab your number early from the tix box and line up.
We managed to go up around 6.15 pm and as the sun was going down the shadows cast were simply stunning. We then went to sit in the open park space (tip bring something to put down on the grass) and just lay down and watch the show. There was a decent food court where you could grab some food and bring it to sit at the park.

Overall excellent show and place to visit. After the show, just hang back and let all the crowds thin out. It will make your exit all the more easier."
,,Worth the SGD 8 entry fee,4.0,,"If you are visiting the Gardens by the Bay it is well worth visiting the supertrees and walking up on the path, in the 'air'! They are doing an amazing job with these gardens. The supertrees will look even better when the plants are fully grown and filling all spaces on those trees. Worth a visit if you have half a day to spare."
,,Wow,5.0,,A unique and imaginative work of art. Set in the Garden by the Bay and is free to visit. There is a charge for going up on the tree top walk. Make sure to go back in the evening for the light show for some amazing entertainment.
,,Nightime Magic,5.0,,"We enjoyed walking around the area known as ""Gardens by the Bay"" in which the Super Tree Grove is located, but the nighttime show with the tree lights set to music is a must see while in Singapore."
,,Simple but beautiful,4.0,,The lights show was amazing. Be early to 'chope' your seats at the bottom of the supertree before it's too late.
,,Evening Light Show was Fun (and free),4.0,,"Cool place. Great potential. Some of the ""trees"" in the grove need more cultivation of the vegetation. The light show we saw had great sound and visuals - but could have been even more spectacularly timed with the beats and rhythm. Still, would probably see again with friends if back in Singapore."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Amazing beautiful super trees. During the day there are excellent views of the garden and surrounding areas. The sky walk is pretty is pretty cool.
,,Fantastic and great evening,4.0,,"We went to see the light show at the Gardens by the Bay but arrived too late to go on the walking tours .The light show was at 8.45 pm and we just sat back and looked at the most amazing light show.
Really liked the theme which was back into the disco era.

Was starving and went to the food court which was spotless and had some chicken which put KFC to shame.
Great evening and then walked to the Marina Bay Sands for drinks."
,,Must stay for the lights,5.0,,"In the daylight the Supertree Grove is pretty cool. If you get a chance walk around the Skyway too, you get excellent views of the marina area and the surrounding gardens.
However its at night this place comes alive. There are two shows (7:45 and 8:45) and the one we saw had 70's music to accompany. It was just stunning.
No need to worry about a good vantage point, everywhere is a good vantage point.
One tip. When it finishes take a breath and look at your phone for 5 minutes, maybe delete some of those rubbish photos you took or choose your favourites for Instagram etc. This will give the crowds a chance to disperse across the bridge or up the stairs where there are inevitable bottle necks. Singapore being Singapore there is no rush to get to the MRT, there are loads of trains and its not going to get busy."
,,Amazing Architectural Triumph,4.0,,"The Supertree Grove is finally coming into is own as climbers and other plants are gradually lover the structure. Several of the Supertrees are actually part of the sophisticated environmental control (some of the towers are part of the cooling, humidification system) for the amazing enclosed gardens at Marina Bay. Never have seen any structures like them....really iconic."
,,Amazing,5.0,,No admission fee for this cool garden with impressively large tree-like structures. Go around sunset to appreciate the detail and the light show. Definitely worth a visit! We combined this with the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest.
,,Fantastic Supertree Grove,5.0,,"The Supertrees and is amazing Because they grow into flowers around, will be more beautiful It's worth making a Sky Walk for a view over the garden and above."
,,Night Viewing,5.0,,"Must view the night show and then walk along the 22-metre-high OCBC Skyway, see Singapore at night very beautiful."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Light show in evening was good Singapore Flyer was another great light show and ride..Raffles bar for Singapore sling very nice ..all got access
,,Amazing,5.0,,It's like being in AVATAR! What an amazing place. We didn't bother going up into the walkway as we had been in the Cloud Forest which gave similar views. Looking up into the trees was just as impressive.
,,Beautiful Light Show,5.0,,The light and sound show at 8PM was fantastic. You should go to the centre of the Supertree Grove and lie down and watch the glowing trees for the best experience.
,,Make sure you see the light show,5.0,,The Supertree Grove is spectacular in itself but can I suggest if you can stay later to ensure you see the light show. This is really wonderful with the music and lights putting on a great show.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Futuristically beautiful. Like an alien landscape, incredible achievement.looks amazing at night and good places to eat nearby."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Self sustaining, amazing and beautiful, that's what you will see at the Super Tree Grove. You can walk around the garden and enjoy the greenery. Also don't miss the light show. Will be back soon."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Worth walking through and above on the walkway. Interesting architecture in the presentation of these Supertrees.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,These look great night or day you can go up them and see it from above a must see don’t miss these if going to Singapore.
,,amazing to see,4.0,,"the trees can be looked at just by walking , to goo on te skywalk between them is at a cost but just to get photos and see what has been achieved was enoough"
,,Great experience - day and night,5.0,,"We spent a couple of hours during the day to see all different areas within the Supertree Grove. The gardens are amazing, there is a gorgeous fish pond and lots of unique spots that most tourists normally don’t go because they stay around the night event. The smell of the garden is incredibly sweet - definitely worthy arriving at 5pm and enjoying it until 8pm ish.

The night show starts at 7:45pm and is best to purchase your ticket ahead of time. It lasts 15 minutes and you can enjoy it from above of you buy the sky walk, and the last 5 minutes go down and watch from below so you can enjoy the best of both.

We took the 7:20pm time slot to do this.

Best night out & great vibe."
,,Waste of Money,1.0,,"Disappointing and objectionable to even have a show in the evening, concept is great of the Grove but thats about all. Mis informed by the ticketing kiosk to the wrong location of the show after waiting in another area for over an hour. Bad experience."
,,Amazing experience to walk from tree to tree,5.0,,"The tree walk, albeit a bit expensive was such a joy. The authorities have done a wonderful job creating and maintaining this green space right in the center of the city. Do not miss the laser show that happens each night at the Supertree Grove. Watch the trees come to life !"
,,Stay for the light show,5.0,,These are amazing structures and to see them lit up was gorgeous. The light and music show at night time is out of this world.
,,Free and beautiful,5.0,,Extremely well maintained in-spite of being free. A lot of photo opportunities. Do not miss the light shows.
,,Great photo spot,4.0,,"This place is purely for great photos. It represents Singapore as well as the Merlion and the Marina Bay Sands. Honestly, the super trees are much better from afar. You can save your money if you plan to do the walk among the Supertrees. The walk isn't very long and it doesn't make for good pictures if that's what you're after."
,,"Probably best viewed at night, but beware ... they are popular",4.0,,"Best advice would be to visit at night and go go of a weekend. If you wish to pay to walk along the high level walkways, be prepared to queue for the experience. Viewing from the ground is free !!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,This light & sound show goes for approx 15 minuites. There is a huge grassy area where you can sit down & enjoy the show. It is a must see if visiting Singapore. We actually came back the next night as well to see it again.
,,Great!!,5.0,,Of course when you go to Singapore one of the top spots to see is the Supertree Grove. To experience the sound and light show is not to be missed. Just find a place to sit or lay back on the pavement like I did and take it all in. It’s wonderful. Best of all it’s free!! Skywalk is a charge if you choose to do that. For me I didn’t feel it necessary though.
,,See this at night,5.0,,This is a great place to visit in the evening to see and hear the light show after dark. the music with the lights is a great way to spend and evening there.
,,Magical! A must-see in Singapore.,5.0,,"Standing between 25 and 50 metres tall, Gardens by the Bay's Supertrees are designed with large canopies that provide shade in the day. You can also (for an additional fee) walk along the 22-metre-high OCBC Skyway and enjoy fantastic views of the Gardens and the Marina Bay skyline. It gets very narrow and sways a bit in the middle, so if you're not very comfortable with heights you might want to avoid it!

The Supertrees come alive with an amazing display of lights and sounds at 7.45pm and 8.45pm every night. Simply sit or lay down on the paths around the Supertrees and be amazed .... and then be prepared for the astonishing crush of people trying to all get out at the same time! Forget trying to get onto the MRT; it'll take forever. Please don't let that put you off, though, the show is absolutely amazing and awe-inspiring and not to be missed."
,,Fab Tree,4.0,,"These Trees are fabulous, at Night they light up truly amazing . One of the reasons I went to Singapore and they did not disappoint"
,,No words other than MUST GO!,5.0,,Super tree grove is out of this world. Try going for the light show they have every night to see the tree's light up following carefully thought out orchestration with a view to kill. If you could only do one thing in Singapore this should be it!
,,"must see, magnificent, wait till the dark and tree show",5.0,,"Yes, everyone will be urging you to visit these trees once you go to Singapore and they would be right! they are amazing! beautiful! when sky turns dark they give an excellent light show with loud inspiring music playing along. Pick a nice spot, because it gets tough to find a spot to put your back because of every other tourists who wish to see, or more like record the show."
,,Free show,5.0,,It's a great show very Disneyesqe. The show is free. Its in with the gardens by the bay. If your pushed for time i would make time for this and miss the other attractions which you pay for and are not as good!
,,Light show at night,5.0,,"This was truly something to see. It’s one thing to see during the day, but in order to get the full affect you need to see at night. Unbelievable."
,,Truly amazing,5.0,,"These metal trees are unreal, but magical. You can get a lift up to the walkway through the trees, and can then experience the most wonderful views above Singapore. At night there is a wonderful light show to music, followed by fireworks. Magnificent!"
,,"A sceptic converted. Great attraction, day and night.",5.0,,"Why would anyone want to look at a grove of huge, skeletal, metal trees? Is Singapore living out Joni Mitchell's prediction? 'They took all the trees and put 'em in a tree museum'.

What's it all about? They are a huge work of...what? Engineering? Horticulture? Vision? Imagination? Art?

All of them. I was sceptical. I'm now a convert.

The scale is far beyond what you are prepared for. They....are....huge. As is the amount of greenery growing up inside the massive steel frames. It's almost a shame that in years to come the natural growth will mask the engineering marvel of the skeleton, but that's the magic.

This group of artificial, static monoliths has been given life. They must be very different now to what they were when they were presented to what must have been a doubting public. Unlike other wonders of the world, both ancient and modern, these trees will be constantly changing and something to be revisited again and again. They are standing still and also moving forward.

Visit them now, then come back every few years; they'll be different each time.

Tip: Do research to find the best location to see the evening light show - which is one of the best I've seen. The music and lights are perfectly synchronised; it's better than the nearby Spectra waterside light show and is almost a match for the Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas.

But don't get too close (like we did) or while you're looking over here you're missing what's happening over there. (I reckon it's best to go further into the park on the 'non-hotel' side.)"
,,High In the Trees,5.0,,"This is so cool, it's just $8 SDG and we bought tickets late afternoon, we went up around 7:00 p.m. They only allow you 15 minutes b/c so many people want to go up and they only allow a certain amount of people at a time.

The light show started at 8 p.m. and we watched that from below, you have to check it out and try a cup of corn while you're waiting."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Spectacular place, views were amazing of Singapore from the tree canopy. Great to see the various plant growing throughout the structure."
,,Brilliant Lightshow,5.0,,"Went there without expectations to See the night Lightshow, and were amazed. Synchronised with the music and tone, it has to be one of the best free things to do in Singapore. Highly recommend."
,,The Light Show is a must watch,5.0,,Go to Supertree Grove during the light show at 7:45. It's free to watch. Walk along the OCBC Skyway if you can. It will cost around SGD $8 but its def worth it.
,,Amazing architecture and scenery,4.0,,"The architecture and build of the supertrees are amazing, you will be amazed by the technique and ideas they used to create this wonderful scenery within the city. It's a good place to hang around but try to avoid weekends as it will be crowded."
,,INSPIRATIONAL,5.0,,We were lucky enough to be there in the Festival of Lights. It was truely amazing and so very pretty! An absolute MUST to see when in Singapore!!!
,,Light show is a must see!,5.0,,Supertree Grove is a spectacular sight even in daylight but the ‚Garden Rhapsody‘ light show is the highlight for sure. We made sure to get to the Grove early (30 mins. before) so we could pick decent seats. This definitely paid off as by the time the show started all seats at the base of the trees were taken and many viewers were left standing or even sitting on the floor. The show was incredible and had the entire crowd captivated and I wish I could have watched more than one!
,,Free light display is amazing,5.0,,Wander down to the Supertrees in the evening and there is a free light and music display twice. People just lay down on the pavement under the trees and watch in awe!
,,Great views,5.0,,"When you go to the Gardens by the Bay you must see this tree and also go up inside it to the Sky Walk. A man made structure simulating a real tree it is a fantastic site with the plants growing up it. From the Sky Walk you can see a lot of Singapore and the gardens below, well worth the time."
,,Great Night Time Viewing,4.0,,Certainly worth a visit at night time for the light show. Go early gets busy for the light show. Gardens are nice to walk around. When finish light show walk across to the shopping centre via the Helix Bridge.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Gardens by the bay, Supertree Grove, Cloud Forest, Flower Done, Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands, the light shows at 8 and 9 pm on the bay and not to mention the great restaurants...... Absolutely loved downtown Singapore. Get the package deal for a cheaper price and spend the day there, you will not regret it."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Excellent day and night. Get there early ,try laying on floor whilst light show in progress, can get busy, it is an amazing experience. Highly recommend"
,,Amazing super structures,5.0,,Must visit at night when the light show and music are on. Amazing experience and to learn about it was fascinating! Would visit again.
,,"Super trees, super experience",5.0,,Visited in early April both during the day and returned at night for the spectacular sound and light show. Simply amazing. Do yourself a favour and spend some memorable time in this beautiful tranquil garden area down by the bay
,,supertree light show,5.0,,"we enjoyed this immensely great experience worth the effort , every visitor to Singapore must go The only downside was waiting for the show to commence"
,,"Gorgeous City views, Such a unique attraction",5.0,,"Really unique experience! I loved walking on the suspended trail above the gardens. The supertrees are so huge and impressive. We only went during the day, but it was still a great long layover activity. I don't recommend walking from Chinatown, even though it seems short--the heat of the day comes on fast!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Excellent area to visit, the light show each evening is brilliant. One of the best things we did in Singapore. The skywalk is also very good if you are ok with heights."
,,A must see while in Singapore,5.0,,"Everyone should pay a visit to Supertree Grove while in Singapore, you won’t be disappointed and you’ll come away amazed at what you’ve just seen and talk about it for days."
,,wow,5.0,,we went to see the lightshow and it was not a disappointment eventhoug we already saw spectra a marina bay. this show is different and magical too. i recommand to visit during day and nighttime it's two magical experiences
,,The one main thing to see,5.0,,"yes there are a lot of things to do in Singapore, but if you only have a limited time and are trying to choose, this is the one thing you should do. It won't disappoint and the light show at night is truly a sight to see."
,,Light show,5.0,,"Went to the light show here it was fantastic, stunning show lots of people were there and I think everyone felt the same absolutely stunning."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,Beautiful. The trees are actually full of secrets - they collect rain water to irrigate the gardens in the center and there are solar panels at the top that power the garden's lights.
,,My personal favorite must do,5.0,,"Magical and mesmerizing-colorful tree-like structures that are synchronized to music each night in this spectacular show.
Runs twice per evening, and it’s free. Great for all ages; there really isn’t a ‘bad spot’ to sit or stand and enjoy the show. It has the beautiful and iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel in the background which makes it even more special.
Enjoy!"
,,Must see at night,5.0,,Either walk the skyway or have an expensive drink at the top tree to enjoy the views. I had the $20 glass of wine and a starter while I watched the action below.
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Really epic sight to see i recommend coming at night time coz of all the kool lights that glow the supertrees it really stops ya in ya tracks and you can take photos, entry is free too, its so big and you just walk around taking it all in its peacefull"
,,Amazing light show,5.0,,"The SuperTrees are amazing. They are beautiful to look at and they have a light and music show every night. You can get tickets to go up the Supertrees and walk around a connecting sky bridge. The only thing to be aware of is that they will close it if it's likely to rain, and it rains a lot. The central tree also has a restaurant at the top but we didn't get a chance to try it out."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,We walked trough the day here but the light show at night is unbelievable! We enjoyed every second. Show is at 7:45 and 8:45. A must go when you visit Singapore!
,,What a sight.,4.0,,"Well worth the visit. If you get the chance, go up to the top of the Maina Bay Sands Skypark at night and view the Supertree Grove light show - absolutely fantastic."
,,Magical,5.0,,"A truly magical show at SuperTree Grove. Beautiful light show set to music. Lie down, look up and be mesmerized. An absolute must when visiting Singapore."
,,"Amazing, very Sci-Fi scenery, reminiscent of the early 1970's SF book cover artwork.",5.0,,"The Supertrees are a major attraction in Gardens by the Bay - for good reason. Architecturally amazing, with a definite ""alien weirdness"" element to them, yet they do not seem out of place, and come the evening the colour-changing light show commences. Definitely worth a visit, and if you can time it for dusk, you will get the best photo and video opportunities!"
,,A must when visiting Singapore!,5.0,,"Wow! We visited the Gardens By The Bay in the afternoon and then stayed to watch the evening light show. What a spectacular sight, the music accompanying the light show in the Supertrees is breathtaking, and watching this event is free! Believe there are two shows each evening (best to check to avoid being disappointed). Have never seen anything quite like it and definitely a must-do when visiting Singapore."
,,Amazing & unique walk,4.0,,A superb night walk around the park n beautiful lightning around the trees though at day time it's very hot to stay but skywalk is worthy
,,"Free but still wonderful, rest/eat/enjoy here",5.0,,"Getting here:
Although there were already a couple of Supertrees right at the entrance of Gardens by the Bay, but they're not to be confused with this Supertree Groves area. From the ticketing entrance where the two domes are, you have to make a right turn and mild down slope to get to this place.

Rest:
They have numerous benches and a football size grass patch for you to do a little picnic.

Eat:
Granted, if picnic in the unbearably hot weather seems impossible, a stretch of afforbs eateries are along this grove. Think Peach Garden for Chinese, Hill Street cafe for some pretty decent local fare, and Texas Chicken if that's your kinda comfort food. There's Bakerzin on the other side, Satay by the Bay for hawker food, but we just find this stretch of air-conditioned eateries with many seats and good priced is probably better for families.

Enjoy:
Musical light show at 7.45pm or 8.45pm is really quite a sight. You can also be up on the OCBC Skywalk bridge (entrance fee applies) that faces MBS (Marina Bay Sands) when this light show is going on! Sometimes, they have free open air concerts on the garden greens or even the annual payable Christmas Wonderland where they set up wonderful lights, booths, games etc BUT they will close up the entire area to public since it's a payable event. Just got to check their calendar to know when."
,,"Excellent, awesome, unique.",5.0,,"Excellent, awesome, unique. The show at night in this place is something out of this planet, you most go."
,,"Great spectacle especially for the night show, music and lights",5.0,,Must do visit especially get there at dusk to take in the sights and atmosphere then make sure you are sitting comfortably to watch the light and sound show well worth the wait
,,Amazing sky walk,5.0,,A totally new perspective on trees and the garden below. Be brave - it only bounces a little and the views are spectacular!
,,beautiful view,5.0,,"We went when it just opened ,lines up were minimal and it was not scorching hot yet.There were 2 lines , one line for general public and one line for tours. Check to make sure you are in the right line."
,,Lovely,5.0,,Though the trees are man made but they are really beautiful. Better to visit around 6 PM so that you can see the trees in the day light and when the artificial light are on. One must see the light show at 7:45 PM. Its a great show.
,,Night fantasy,5.0,,Must visit this site from sunset through then night. The view on the top of the tree is superb. The light show at night time brings you to the Avatar movie Scene
,,Beautiful experience but HOT,4.0,,Lovely and such a wonderful place to explore. But just sooo sooooo warm. Make sure to bring a fan etc to keep cool.
,,"Futurist, creative and ecologically sound!",5.0,,"The supertrees, which have artificial scaffolding on which plants are growing, are amazing. And the sound and light show is a MUST SEE!"
,,Dazzling Trees at night!,4.0,,"Supertree Grove at Gardens by the Bay is simply beautiful. Singapore is generally hot and humid. But let the sun go down and you can start your visit to this tree grove around 6 pm. Without lights it may look a bit dull. But wait for the lights to come up! You might even wonder where you are! It is almost surreal.
There is a skywalk to add a new dimension to this experience. The trees are man-made ofcourse. But the natural plants and creeperrs that cover the tree trunks are amazing. Just a stone's throw away from Marina Bay Sands Hotels, you can see the trees and the light show. If you plan to get an up-close encounter, and if you like to see the plants etc in detail, you have to walk towards the grove. So wear some comfortable shoes. It is a lovely walk. You will not be disappointed!"
,,Free and simple,5.0,,The light show was worth the wait and walk in the hot sun and humid evening It’s a nice ambience and in the day the “trees” look scary and futuristic but the light show brings it altogether Nice visit for 3 hours
,,Very Nice Experience,4.0,,"It was a nice experience. there is a lights show here at around 7:00 PM. But, it gets a little boring after about 15 Mins so not giving 5 stars.But you should watch the show as it is beautiful"
,,Impressive,5.0,,"We had a good time visiting the Supertree Grove. Especially, the free show in the evening was great to watch."
,,A night time visit is a must !,5.0,,"Spectacular light show in the gardens at 7.45pm and 8.45pm. My husband and I love Dubai, however agreed that this show was better than the dancing fountains in terms of light display and choreography. The domes can be visited during the day for a bit of relief from the heat and humidity."
,,Great stroll but the bio-spheres are the main attraction,4.0,,"Great cultural displays and worth an hour of walk around time. Kids may get a bit bored but then take them to the bio spheres and orchid and plant displays. Awesome. Yes there is a price$ to pay but you will not regret it! Must visit. And yes, it is cooler inside the domes than out in the Supertree Grove which is nice but not the main attraction IMHO."
,,must see,5.0,,"Unique vertical gardens resembling towering trees, with large canopies & colorful lights at night.. It man-made mechanical forest consists of 18 supertrees that act as vertical gardens, generating solar power, acting as air venting ducts for nearby conservatories, and collecting rainwater.This place Well worth a visit espically at night to see colour trees and enjoyed the music ans take some Photos.This place is part of Marina bay garden and you must come early to book bench to sent because it will be full of people before the light show.I can describe how it was outstanding and my daughter dance alot in the cool music.
The Show start around 8 PM."
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,Get there early for a spot to see the light show. The night we were there it began at 7:45. A beautiful sight!
,,A must see,5.0,,"Went by train to see light show, easy to get to. Shows are free, at 7:45 and 8:45 lasting for 15 minutes. We just crossed the road at Marina Bay and decided to stay in front of the lake so we could view the show and not be underneath it. Amazing, something to behold."
,,Super tree.,4.0,,Well worth a visit. Can be crowded. A must see at night. It’s worth joining the line to go up on the walk way.
,,Orchestratrical!,5.0,,Outstandingly stunning! Didn’t expect something so cool. NOT TO BE MISSED! This could be Singapore’s most important attraction yet!!!
,,"great sculptural, ecological wonder!",4.0,,a little touristy $$ but worth seeing! Lines can be long also make time for the local indoor green/ botanical spaces.
,,"OMG beautiful in the daytime , Stunning at night.",5.0,,"A must thing to do while in Singapore. Was awesome to walk over here as we were staying at Marina Bay Sands , nice and close. Our room over looked this magnificent park. The light show was stunning at night. We walked around the top at night when the light show was on was very cool. We could also see the light show from our room. The gardens are beautifully maintained , the staff working here were lovely. Good price to go in . A MUST to do . Whoever designed this is very very clever. Truly a masterpiece.
We paid $20 each to go up top to the bar area in the supertree this Included a drink. Great view. The service was poor and the drink was 3/4 full and not friendly staff.
We asked the Main man in the restaurant below the bar if there was any tables free as we wanted to have dinner there as we didn't have a booking. He told us to come down in approx 1.5-2hrs hrs as they were full. Even though there were tables empty, we went and had a drink and approx 1 hr came down and tables still empty and i said are there any table free yet seeing for my self those tables were still free and empty. He sighed and said yes he will get one for us , he wasn't really interested at all. He finally got us the table that was empty all night.He poured peoples wine and walked around us and his waitress was just pottering around even though we were at a table waiting to order . Finally the young waitress approached us after approx 15 min. We were not impressed. We ordered a meal each. My husband asked asked about his dish to make sure it wasn't hot and spicy. She said no. When we finally got out meal it was average and not worth the price. His meal was so hot he struggled to eat it and left most of it on the plate. He didn't say anything to her at the time as we were tired and just wanted to get out of there. I said on the way out meal was very disappointing and too hot for my husband even though we asked you about it and i told her the service was poor and she just shrugged. Didn't give a damn. The boss man walked past us a few time while eating and never said a word to us. VERY DISAPPOINTING RESTAURANT AND TERRIBLE SERVICE. IT was a real shame as the Supertree and park was amazing and the bar on top and restaurant let it down."
,,Fantastic light & music shiw,5.0,,"There are two shows 7.45 and 8.45 every evening. The show is free to enter and watch. Get the early and get a seat on the walls at the base of each tree.

The park lights are dimmed and the show begins. Fantastic sound and lights. Show lasts about 15 minutes.

Make sure you have enough time before to explore the rest of Gardens by the bay, it’s all a beautiful attraction."
,,A worthy experience,5.0,,"Wonderful place, out of this world 🌎 Amazing music & lights performance “Garden Rhapsody”, every night. Take a ticket to the OSBC Skyway (8 SGD) for 20:40 and enjoy the music & lights performance from above. Unforgettable!"
,,Wonderful colours,5.0,,"Seeing the Supertrees by night with the light & music show (free) is a must-have experience. Come early, though and be prepared to sit on the ground together with hundreds of other spectators because it can get quite full."
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,Wonderful design! there should be more such places! much more ! the possibility of free entry to beautiful music projections and lights! very interesting place for a date!
,,GO up into the tree!,5.0,,"You can wander through the trees and at night there is a light show to music which is free and seating is benches or ground, first come first serve. There is also a walkway that you can go up into the trees and walk from tree to tree, the fee is $6 each. get there early - i think we got our tickets around 6:30 pm and got a time slot of 7:40. the light show started just before we went up and then we saw it from the bottom and from the top of the trees. They limit the amount of people on the walkway ~ so you are not too crowded, you have time to take pictures but after a few minutes you are asked to keep moving along. It is an elevator up, and an elevator down ~ the elevator down got backed up so we opted to take the stairs."
,,Late night stop over in Singapore,5.0,,"We had a 8 hour layover at Singapore airport and decided to do a midnight city tour. The cabs are more expensive at night but since there was no traffic at all, it only took 15min to get to downtown. After 2am the lights from the Supertree Grove are dimmed. We arrived at around 1am and had the park pretty much to ourselves. It was such a gorgeous setting."
,,Insane light show in evening,5.0,,"Supertree grove is probably for me the #1 attraction of Singapore. In the evening, there is an insane light show at the grove when the trees are all lit-up - that's the best time to go to this place. Cloud Forest etc are just too ordinary in front of this. You can even go up to the canopy (there is a bit of a queue always though) and enjoy the views from the top. But it was best enjoyed when it was all dancing to the lights."
,,Up in the trees,5.0,,"Excellent tour up in the colourful trees, If heights are a worry just look around at the gardens and your mind will be taken away. Well worth afternoon tour just before Trees light up. Small fee to entre and small groups only on tour.
Must do"
,,unbelievable light show!,5.0,,Don't miss this. The lights are coordinated to music at every night's show that lasts about twenty minutes. It's centrally located near the gardens.
,,MODERN GARDENS THAT WILL TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY,5.0,,"Amazing concept for a truly modern gardens. You can find everything that you dreamt off in this brilliant gardens. The richness and the variety of threes, shrubs, grasses, flowers etc.is endless. Everything is brilliantly explained and not overwhelming. We have visited many Botanical Gardens around the world but this is something else. You MUST see this. Supertree Grove is only a part of the Marina Bay Gardens. One day is not enough to see all."
,,Stunning - don't miss the light show,5.0,,Unmissable light show - free of charge at night all to music - worth a visit or stay over if you have visited in the day - the walkway is lovely too but there is a charge for this
,,You have to see this (day & night),5.0,,"You can see the Super trees from far and wide but the experience of walking in, beneath and among them is well worth it. Its free unless you walk along the skyway (which is well worth the cost). If you are able to visit during the evening i truly recommend it. The light show is awesome and helped by Michael Buble music. If you can visit day and night - its well worth it."
,,Unbelievable light show,5.0,,WOW!! The light show here is so amazing. This really is a must do. Unbelievably it is absolutely free. One of the wonders of the modern world. Just go - you won't regret it!!
,,Boring and crowded,2.0,,"Nothing extraordinary. Visit is free so go at least once but not worthy of a return visit. While there during the light show, stay in the elevated area surrounding the grove, not under the trees so you do not have to crank your head up all the time to watch the show."
,,super night,4.0,,We traveled to Singapore for a few days and it is amazing .The Supertree Grove is best visited at night to see the light show it is also cooler at night but super to see
,,Very hot during the day,5.0,,"The concrete floor reflects the sun's heat right back at you even if you're holding an umbrella. However, there is a great rooftop bar on the largest supertree where you can have a beer or cocktail."
,,Very attractive location,4.0,,"The cooling towers are encased with a steel frames, and plants is growing on the frames. This creates an impression of ""trees"". Come in the evening, and you can also enjoy a light show, synchronized with music. It is very enjoyable."
,,The best music & light show you will see anywhere in the world,5.0,,"During a recent holiday in Singapore a few days after visiting the dome gardens of Gardens by the Bay we returned at night to witness the Super Trees on the skyway at night. The admission was only $8.00 Singapore and they do two nightly music & light shows at 7.45pm & again at 8.45pm. I can only describe the experience as being truly magical, it literally takes your breath away with the feeling you are on another planet. If there is one attraction you do in Singapore I cannot recommend this more highly. If I could give it 10 stars I would!"
,,Out of this world!,5.0,,These trees are even more impressive in person!! they are huge and if you go to Singapore you just cannot miss walking around them
,,Wow,5.0,,"All the pictures you see of this cannot do it enough justice, it's amazing. Be prepared to be there a long time, it's worth it"
,,"Supertree Grove, both during the day and night",5.0,,"This is maybe one of the musts when you visit Singapore. It is a pleasant walk down to the Marina Bay and at the Supertree Grive you not only will experience the 'trees', you will have a new view of the Sandy Bay Skypark."
,,good views of surrounding area.,5.0,,"we had been told to buy tickets to go up to the Super tree Grove before we arrived. don't listen, buy the tickets when you get there. They charge only $8 Singapore each, not the inflated prices advised. Did not get to see a great deal more, but next time we will check out the main gardens in the morning and go to see the Super tree grove again at night. It's a beautiful place, do not miss seeing what there is to see."
,,Must see,5.0,,"Our 1st time in Singapore and was so happy we made it to the grove. We saw it during the day but sure it must be even prettier at night.

Recommend getting the tickets so you can be above with the branches. There’s also a little restaurant where you can go up and get a Birdseye view of the grove, the cost of the ticket also includes a beverage which was much needed in the Singapore heat.
Family had a great time."
,,Great views,5.0,,"Well worth going up to the walkway at Supertree Grove. The views are lovely. The ""trees"" are fascinating too."
,,Reminded me of Avatar,4.0,,We walked through the Supertree Grove whilst visiting the Gardens by the Bay. We had seen it at night but to walk through it during the day you get to see how large these tree-like structures are .. reminded me of the movie “Avatar”.
,,Wow,5.0,,"Absolutely fantastic!!

Great shows and a lovely atmosphere

Watched the shows a couple of times and loved every single second! Get there at least 10 mins early to get a seat around on the the tree bases (you can then just lie back and enjoy the show)

We went in the OCBC skyway which allowed us a different view of the area and those fantastic trees"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"The light show here is outstanding and well worth seeing. Get there at least 30 minutes before show as it gets very crowded. The trees are just beautiful all lit up. So clean and tidy. Has two light shows daily and both seem crowded. A must see if visiting Singapore. Can walk up in the trees on the OCBC skyway for $8 which is worth it, again go early if you not keen on queues and crowds. Get off at Bayfront MRT station and follow the signs."
,,Overpriced View,3.0,,"This is part of gardens by the bay, this is the sky walk that is about 130 meters in length and overpriced for a short elevator ride / walk."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Attended the 7.45pm show. Just sit wherever you can find a spot and enjoy the show. Really well done.
,,Amazing Art form !!!,5.0,,"These are tree like concrete super structures with heights that range between 80ft to 160 ft. They are vertical gardens that perform many functions like and act as environmental engines for the gardens. There several unique and exotic ferns, vines, orchids and also a vast collection of bromeliads amongst other plants. They are fitted with environmental technologies that mimic the ecological function of trees like photovoltaic cells that harness solar energy which is used for lighting. They also use rainwater collection for use in irrigation and fountains. The Supertrees also serve as air intake and exhaust structure for the conservatories' cooling systems.

There is an elevated walkway, known as the OCBC Skyway, between 2 of the biggest Supertrees for visitors to enjoy a panoramic aerial view of the Gardens. We really enjoyed the walk in the evening when the sun was just setting. The sky and Singapore city line was looking beautiful from up there. Every night, at 7:45pm and 8:45pm, the Supertree Grove comes alive with a coordinated light and music show known as the Garden Rhapsody. The accompanying music to the show is changed every month or so with different themes like A World of Wonder and A Night of Musical Theatre, which feature pieces from films like Jurassic Park and Pirates of the Caribbean.

All in all its an amazing place to be at. They also have several dining outlets at the base of these trees for tourists to enjoy meals.

Must Must Must visit place."
,,Absolutely amazing,5.0,,We went to see the sound and light show here at 7.45 pm. It was absolutely breathtaking. What is even more amazing is that it was free!! A MUST see while in Singapore
,,It’s Hard to Get Too Excited About Giant Fake Trees,4.0,,"The build is phenomenal, the fact that they are planted out and growing is amazing, the skywalk feels death defying but I was a little underwhelmed. This is not something for the bucket list."
,,Can walk around Without paying a fee,3.0,,This is part of the gardens by the bay park. You can walk around the super trees without buying a ticket. This area of the city is where a lot of people exercise. We did not stay to see the light show as we were there to see the domes.
,,Great show at sunset,5.0,,"Go in the late afternoon after a visit to the Cloud Forest ( must do experience!) to see the sound and light show at sunset. Just sit and relax. The light is great, the sound a little dramatic. It's only 15 mn but it's really nice. We enjoyed it as a family, just like hundreds of other people around us. No need to climb up the big tree, you'll actually have a better view fro the ground."
,,Beautiful light show!,5.0,,We enjoyed seeing the Supertree light show. It looked magical and the music was beautiful. It was one of the highlights of our trip.
,,Must visit place,5.0,,"“Oh my god “ this place is so extremely beautiful !!!!! Must visit at night , have free light show. Good for family and couple ~"
,,"Truly, A Garden Rhapsody",5.0,,"The supertrees are a unique experience to look forward for. Recommended to be on time to experience the OCBC Skywalk and experience the supertrees from a different view. The supertrees light up and a light and sound show is something which is not to be missed at any cost. The show happens twice everyday, one at 1945 hrs and one at 2045hrs."
,,Free light show in the super trees,5.0,,We managed to see the light and sound show in the super-trees at night while we were in Singapore and found the free show great.
,,In a land far far away,4.0,,"Super tree Grove is one of the most pleasant, calming attractions in Singapore. It's located in the Marina Bay Area which is very easy to get to. You can catch a train MTR or a taxi.

The artificial modern metallic tree structures are part of a huge cultivated tropical outdoor garden. They provide the necessary framework for plants to attach themselves to grow onto in any direction. At the moment these structures are not completely covered particularly towards the tree tops because it takes time for the different varieties of plant life to cover the entire area which is large as there are many trees.

The plants and flowers are of a tropical nature, large, lush, colourful and robust. They are used along side of other exhibitions. In February there were many paper mâché fish designed by various parts of the community which added to the beauty and originality of this attraction.

The gardens are well maintained. You can enjoy your own picnic here or snatch some fast food just to take time to sit and admire the garden. There are also the two massive domes the rainforest and flower dome close by there are plenty of things to do."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"If you only have time for one thing, then let this be it! The music and light show that the trees 'perform' to twice nightly is a spectacle not to be missed. Totally amazing. Ive seen it at least 20 times now over the years and the music score is regularly changed. Never gets boring....JUST GO . lol"
,,Breathtaking area,5.0,,I really was surprised how interesting this area was. Huge artificial trees are connected by a skywalk. It is a huge recreational area with a stunning architecture and a realistic look into the future. Unless you are just walking around it is free.
,,Awesome view,5.0,,"The place provides a great view of the surrounding Marina bay region. Besides, there is a light and sound show in the evening which is a treat."
,,Spectacular Supertrees!!!,5.0,,The spectacular Supertree grove is not to be missed! This is brilliant and beautiful and fun! And it is also FREE! Every night they have two light and sound exhibits that last for 15 minutes. This is a must see in Singapore. We went to the first showing and then stayed for the second. Brilliant!
,,Enjoyable time by the tree,4.0,,"*** Tips: you should come here at around 3 - 4pm to enjoy the atmosphere and scene until night time when you can enjoy the forest music. Lying down beneath the Supertree for relaxation, listening to music and watch the light. About 15 mins. Bring along coat/blanket to cover your body when lying, but it's clean anyway."
,,Great light show,5.0,,Visited during the day and at night for the light show. Well worth a visit and the light show is free. Twice every night.
,,WOW,5.0,,truly transforms into a outta world experience in the evening the light and sound show is really good remember to get in early and find a nice spot and just lay down and watch the show which lasts about 15 - 20 mins
,,"A ""MUST SEE"" When Visiting Singapore, Day of Night! 5-STARS",5.0,,"These ""tree"" are amazing to see. They are not really trees at all but are really large steel superstructures made with tons of draped greenery plants. At the top is a wide flower looking funnel, which in reality is a rain collection system that provides water for the structure greenery. Also at the top there are solar panels to collect energy for the nighttime light throughout the park. The center tallest ""tree"" also has a restaurant and bar on top!

BOTTOM LINE: You really need to see this park in the day and at night to fully appreciate this unique ""tree"" park. At night this is a wonderland of blue hue trees in LED light! Picture perfect! These trees are simply amazing to see. Beautiful! I rate it a MUST SEE for anyone visiting Singapore. RATING: 10/10"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"if you get the opportunity, this is a place you mus visit. there is a great opportunity to walk along the tree tops it is safe for all ages. the views from up in the trees is splendid and a great photo opportunity."
,,super super,5.0,,"what a grove of trees they are,still growing strong,what will they be liike in 10 yrs time. hope to come back and see"
,,Only in Singapore...,5.0,,Towering tree-like metal framed structures combined with colorful lights and sounds gave me goosebumps....amazing! It’s absolutely must see.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Great views, good experience and will need to repeat it at night. Entry is reasonably priced and worthwhile."
,,I thought the sculptures were amazing!,5.0,,Very cool to look at; you can pay extra to access the skywalk area (which may be beneficial if you stay for the night show)
,,A must to see,5.0,,"We visited the Supertree Grove both during the day and at Night. The walk in the trees is not for the faint hearted, and the night light show set to music was out of this world"
,,Singapore 2019,5.0,,A lovely way to spend the evening visiting the gardens and these trees. There is a symphony of lights on every night and you can go up on the walkway but the night we went it was closed for maintenance. Very disappointed as it was our last night.
,,This is a must see and must hear in Singapore,4.0,,"While in Singapore, we when to the Super Tree Grove which is in the Gardens By The Bay, just behind the Marina Bay Sands hotel.

Twice a night this place comes alive with light and music and is so packed we were sitting on the ground to watch his spectacle (if you come early, you can get a seat).

The is an elevated walkway suspended from the Supertrees that allows you to walk above the gardens and get a great view of this space .. .what blew me away was the view above the Bismarck palms .. it's is an unbelievable geometric view .. one you usually don't get to see.

The light show is synchronized to music and is just awesome .. .I am running out of superlatives.

Go there, get a cab, they are so cheap in Singapore ... there were thousands of people the night we were there and probably a hundred waiting for a cab .. we waited twenty minutes as it is all really well organised (there are over forty thousand cabs in Singapore ... no wonder we didn't wait long).

It's a great free night out."
,,Lovely place,4.0,,This grove is right behind the Sands hotel. A lovely place to stroll the grounds. The tres light up and have a light and music show every night.
,,Night sound and light show.,5.0,,"The super trees by day are spectacular, but by night when illuminated and accompanied by the sound show they are out of this world, not a long show, about 30 minutes but breathtaking. The walkway is best visited by day to appreciate the views, but can be congested at times"
,,5 stars is not enough!,5.0,,"The supertrees are magnificent in daylight and resplendent at night. The beauty of the music and light show was awe-inspiring andmoving. Do not do the walkway if heights are not your thing as it feels really exposed, but it is very worthwhile if you can conquer your fears. You get a marvellous view of the Sky Sands hotel. We were lucky enough to be up there when fireworks went off, so we had an even more special view. You may have to queue for your timed ticket to use the walkway. There were hundreds of people waiting round the trees to watch the show, so the suggestion would be to get there early, take a picnic and find somewhere comfortable to wait and watch."
,,Amazing Light Spectacle,5.0,,Gardens by the Bay – Supertree Grove Light Show. So crowded and uncomfortable but oh what an amazing spectacle. 18 monster structures of metal shaped like giant trees come alive in a blaze of changing vibrant color which is combined with really great music which goes for 15 minutes. Best position is lying on one’s back as the visual is up high above you – but finding a spot even to sit can be difficult and the cement is hard (grass is limited)! There are two sessions each evening 7:45pm and 8:45pm; it is free and no tickets required. Singapore built a MRT (Bayfront CEI on the Circle Line) station just for people travelling to the Gardens.
,,Wonderful Night show,5.0,,"We visted at 9 PM light show to see the Super trees lit up . Show lost 30 minutes with array of colorful LED lights. During the day the place is hot and humid, during the night cool breese from the ocean make this show most enjoyable."
,,Must see at Night,5.0,,This was so different from anything else I have ever seen. A must to see at night. They have a light show and that is spectacular.
,,A must see,5.0,,If you are visiting Singapore do not miss the night light show at Supertree Grove. Well worth seeing
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,Absolutely fantastic place with many locations. Suggest to visit the Tree Grove in the evening during the light show. Before that visit the flower dome nearby (100 meters)
,,Night show,4.0,,You shoul see here at night because of light and music show. You can go up with elevator and walk betwren these trees.
,,Night light show,5.0,,"This is a must see, you will be amazed. Easy to get to by train. Get there early to get a seat. Beautiful."
,,The laser show!,3.0,,"If not for the mesmeriing laser show, late in the evening, the Supertree grove has nothing to boast about on its own. But the laser show makes a visit to this part of the City a must and i shall not miss the show for anything else in Singapore."
,,imagine the future,4.0,,i wish metropolitan cities adopt this infrastructure. they are so amzing. watch them light up at night. you can skip the ocbc runways. too expensive. but the gardens are free
,,Feels like you're on another planet..,4.0,,A very different experience. Must go at night or towards dusk to really experience its difference - the changing light show.
,,Supertrees,5.0,,Must visit to find out how these supertrees are part of the recycling that uses the landscaping refuse to run the whole Garden by the Bay. They are fantastic!
,,Great show,5.0,,Do not miss it if you visit singapore 🇸🇬. Romantic place and relaxing if you want to open your mind to the natural air and when you open your heart to the love.
,,Good light show,5.0,,Best time to visit is in the evening when a free light show is on. Would not recommend the bridge walk as not worth the money.
,,Amazing Light and Sound show at night,5.0,,"Nice place, especially at night, when there is a light and sound show. An interesting walk between the trees, that we did not opt for.I counted 12 trees in total. The Supertree grove is free, but there is a tax to go to the Skyway."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,This was magical. We visited in the evening. That's the best time . the light show is wonderful .bring a blanket and sit on the grass and enjoy the show.
,,Spectacular night light show,5.0,,Don't miss the night show here. It was definitely the highlight of our trip to Singapore. It's completely free and I would highly recommend.
,,Magical!,5.0,,"Go after dark for a tranquil and magical experience. The whole gardens are well worth a visit, spend the whole evening it is open late."
,,Worth the extra bucks,5.0,,"If you are visiting and want full experience then she’ll out couple extra dollars and go up the skywalk in the grove,"
,,Must See!,5.0,,"To be truthful, the Supertrees are what attracted our attention to Singapore. We saw the pictures and were awestruck by the beauty.

In real life, they did not disappoint. We are amateur photographers, so visited them at different times of the day to capture different light settings. From early morning to the night light show, they Supertrees were amazing. And visiting them is free.

We also did the skywalk. I have a great fear of heights and intense vertigo, but honestly, neither were triggered on the skywalk. It really is not that high. Breeze was amazing and views incredible. We were in line for tickets at 8:50 and almost had the area to ourselves."
,,Ultra modern design and garden,5.0,,"Take a camera when visiting here to take some fantastic photos!
The Supertree Grove provides habitats for over 162,900 plants including epiphytes ferns and orchids.
The Supertrees are fitted with photovoltaic cells which harness solar energy, similar to how trees would photosynthesise. You can take in panoramic views of the gardens from the 22 metre high OBC Skyway (access via lift)
We visited during the day time spent about an hour here.
There is a light and sound show at 7:45 pm or 8.45 pm daily we didn’t see this but we were told that is really worth seeing!
Highly recommend a visit here."
,,Best bit of the gardens,4.0,,"The supertrees are the best bit of the Gardens by the Bay. We arrived early on a Sunday morning (9am), and it was brilliant. There was no queue for the lifts - and we were largely undisturbed as we walked along - and wobbled - at great height.

I say wobbled, and that’s not an unfair description. Because if you’re scared of heights (I am not), there’s some noticeable sideways movement. Had the wind whipped up some speed, I’m not sure I’d have got out the lift.

The views across to Marina Bay are fantastic. And for me, the supertrees were the best thing about the Gardens. The Gardens themselves were frankly a bit disappointing."
,,Lovely to see,4.0,,The way the vegetation grows up these man made trees is very pretty and they certainly look impressive when lit up at night.
,,"Green by the day, Twinkling by the night",5.0,,"What a great invention!! The supertree grove is not just a place you would want to visit to enjoy the gardens and fresh air, it is something you must visit to witness one of the great achievements of mankind as a small tribute to mother nature. The super trees seem something straight out of a sci-fi movie. Come here just before sunset to experience it both at daytime, when you can see the complete plant growth and garden greenery, and also at night, when the trees light up with millions of led lights, completed with a musical show."
,,Organised tour which included the Supertrees,5.0,,Stunning and inspiring. The light show provided us with an amazing visual experience and sense of wonder.
,,the lights are lit twice a night.,5.0,,"I stayed in Maria Bay area all day long. After walking around for a long time, the last vist was this place at night. I watched the light show with music starting at 7:45."
,,night time in the trees,5.0,,"Ohhh my what a magical night ,,a must see for every one the lights the music it was amazing ...get their early so you have the best veiw .dissapointed when it was over and we were too late to do the walk above the trees ,next time mybe."
,,Most amazing Supertree Grove,5.0,,"We enjoyed this very much. If you see Marina Bay Gardens, you have to visit the Supertree Grove. It is world class as well as the whole area. Don't miss this!"
,,Amazing garden,5.0,,These gardens are massive and out of this world. Really amazing structures. Such a clean city where these gardens fit right in.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"This is an amazing place to go and visit . Firstly the imagination to build it in the first place .
It’s easy to get to by walking , taxi or tube train and not expensive . It was 28 sing dollars for both houses and another 8 to go up and look down via the walkway .
The display of plants and flowers is amazing and put together very well .
It is all very well organised too."
,,GREAT TO TOUR BUT I THINK NIGHT WOULD BE THE BEST,4.0,,Can't say for sure but I think touring this at night would be better than in the afternoon. The structures were impressive although some of the growth/vegetation was a bit tired. I saw it from afar at night ad thought that is the time to go. Next time!
,,Beautiful scenery in the park,5.0,,"Me and my friend enjoyed the liggt show in the evening that happens every day next to the hoghest ""threes"" in the middle of the Gardens by the Bay. It worth it! Takes about 15 minutes and it a mixture of various songs combined to one show.
This is also very characteristic place for Singapore photos and memories from the city so definitely go for it when you have an opportunity!"
,,Awesome nighttime display,5.0,,"Returned to the Supertree grove for the evening music and light display, and am so pleased that I experienced it. it was an Opera selection on the evening I attended, and it was simply great."
,,A Nice Light Show,5.0,,We took a Viator tour from our hotel to the Gardens and really enjoyed it. The music and lights were very pleasant and having the city skyline as a backdrop was pretty special.
,,Don't miss it!,5.0,,"All Singapore's creativity in this magnificent garden. Incredible architecture, fantastic light shows every day, you feel in another dimension. Try it, you won't regret it."
,,Good dating spot,5.0,,"Went there on a date, while the Christmas Wonderland were ongoing, saw the fake snow, several display pieces, took photos there, and the food pop-ups were great too. On top of that, the standard musical performance by the Supertrees were gorgeous."
,,Just do it,5.0,,The views are amazing and appeals to all ages. It is disabled friendly. So many memorable photographs to be taken
,,Really cool,5.0,,"This place was fun to visit. It is easy to get to by MRT. Make sure you time your visit to see the light show, which occurs around the alkway."
,,"Beautiful by day, amazing by night",5.0,,An essential visit. Walk along the high rise walkway and take in the film at the end. Watch the illuminations in the evening.
,,Beautiful nighttime show,5.0,,I still can't believe they don't charge people to see the Supertree Grove at night - it's a beautiful show set to music and lights. Show up a bit early to find a seat on nearby steps or curb with a good view.
,,The highlight of our visit to Singapore,5.0,,"Of all the wonderful things we did and saw in Singapore, this was the very best!, It was enough to convince us we would return to Singapore we were enthralled by it. Supertree Grove is an amazing area of gardens that are set around these wonderful man made structures with plants growing up them of all colours and varieties. But to experience the wonder of this place, be there at 7.45 at night and watch the Light Show when these amazing ""Tree Structures"" deliver the best light show we had aver seen, combined with beautiful light opera music it brought tears to our eyes, it really was so beautiful"
,,Light show at gardens,5.0,,This is a must see when you visit Singapore beautiful light show at night and lovely gardens to walk around
,,just go,5.0,,"This place is brilliant, there is a show every evening set to music and all the tress light up. A real highlight of our trip."
,,Light show.,4.0,,This part of the garden is free entrance. There's a nice light show on the umbrella structures in the evening.
,,"Great view, beautiful light show!",5.0,,"A part of the free entry Gardens on the Bay, visit this area around sunset. Very worthwhile to pay the entry for the OCBC Skyway - great views and these are best just before sunset and just after. Try to be back down on the ground in time for the nightly Supertree Grove light show. Find a patch of grass, lie down on your back and just enjoy the music and light display. Magical!"
,,Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,A must visit for any visitor to Singapore. The two Domes offer an excellent array of flora and forna in an extraordinary environement. The high level walkway will take your breath away and is preferable to the ouside walkway if it is hot and muggy. Not so impressed with the catering facilities but there is always a MacDonalds!
,,Avatar,5.0,,One can check this place out for free. Best thing would be go for cloud forest and flower dome in noon and reach here by evening as they have got free light and sound show every evening twice or thrice perhaps. But this show is must visit as it is so nice and peaceful. We literally feel outside world.
,,A must do for sure,5.0,,Even if your time is limited Singapore this is worth the trip. Arriving just before dark is ideal and the lights show goes for about 15 minutes. Note: that you will be looking up for the entire show.
,,Must Do,5.0,,Loved this space and would recommend it to anyone that travels to Singapore. Make time in your trip and a few hours minimum.
,,Good lightshow!,4.0,,"Lightshow was good, but walk around the area was quite tiring. Fresh air and can take good pictures."
,,Stunning highlight,5.0,,These structural trees add another dimension to the Gardens by the Sea. The suspended walkway Isa great way to view the park and the evening light show was lovely - check the timing.esay to access from the Marina Bay Sands area and is a lovely area to stroll around and lots of photo opportunities.
,,Mesmerising,5.0,,The night show here was the highlight of my time in Singapore. It had me mesmerized and entranced! Absolutely loved it.
,,Interesting and great for snaps,5.0,,"The evening light show is a bit overrated, but the area is a fine space for strolling, eating, or attending one of many outdoor concerts or other events."
,,Another Unusual Tourist Attraction,5.0,,We were told to go in the evening and I'm glad we did as the lighting and changing patterns on the trees is quit amazing. Wonderful music accompanies your experience. Structurally the trees are dazzling. There are places to sit and just take it all in or you can wander around the trees as the program advances. It's magical.
,,Vacation,4.0,,"We went here later in the day, they are neat these trees. Went all around and stayed at night for the light show with music. So worth going later in the day and staying til night."
,,The light show was fantastic!,5.0,,A great sensory experience. The music and the light show were a wonderful event for everyone! There are many locations inside the park to take advantage of the show!
,,Awe inspiring!,5.0,,"I expected to be amazed but it was so much more than I had anticipated. The sheer scale of these structures is awe-inspiring and the planting is beautiful.the walkway is worth the entry fee too. At night there is a light show and I saw it from the viewing platform of the marina bay shopping mall, which was a perfect vantage point."
,,Worth the heat for a nice walk through the grove,5.0,,"An well constructed and aesthetically pleasing engineering marvel. Many descriptive signs explaining how the grove and adjacent biospheres function in concert. Beautiful views of the bay and the Marina Bay Sands through the grove. I went during the day, will be coming back at night to experience the lights at night. Very cool creation."
,,Underwhelming,3.0,,"Went to the Supertree Grove for the musical light show on a rainy September evening. The light show was quite average. Couldn't do the OCBS skyway coz it was closed due to the weather.

At closing time, we had to wait for almost 1 hour at the taxi rank to get a cab to our hotel. There were loads of people and most of the cabs were the big MPV types and the drivers were trying to convince people that their fare was the same as that of regular taxis. Most people did not want to to take the chance, but the drivers refused to move on so the queue just got longer and longer. Do bring along an umbrella when you visit"
,,Super Good,4.0,,Interesting and the experience of visiting at night differs from the experience during the day which is far more subdued. If you like you can take the lift to the top of the tallest tree for a drink or a bite to each along with the mandatory selfie or two (at a cost).
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,"this is a must visit when in singapore, I also highly recommend going up the supertree grove and walk the ocbs skyway. It will surely be a memorable experience for everyone"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"While visiting Darden Bay, we saw these magnificent structures and enjoyed a lot. Even the view around this place is awesome."
,,Remarkable from many perspectives!!,5.0,,"The ""Supertree Grove"" have ""TREES"" ranging in height from 82-160 feet. While man made, they are essential for the functioning of the nearby gardens... There is also a ""walkway"" between two of the taller ""Trees""-- which allow one the see the surrounding gardens from this ""panoramic perspective""! The Super Trees also provide fresh air for the air conditioning systems, solar electric collection is also used This very popular attraction has been awarded TripoAdvisors' ""Travellers Choice"" designation. It is indeed well worth a visit.

I hope that this Review has been helpful."
,,Simply amazing!,5.0,,"It was an amazing experiance to visit this place, the music, the lights and the colors were an amazing memory!"
,,Great views,4.0,,Visited both during the day and night. Went up the Trees during the day and you get great views of Singapore. Not expensive and we did not prebook. Trees look Spectacular at night and the last admission is around 8pm.
,,Best seen after dusk,4.0,,The light show is amazing but extremely busy! if you go on the sky walk be prepared to wait 40mins+. Check light show times before visiting.
,,Fantastic city feature,4.0,,"Even the shortest of Singapore trips has time to visit the Supertree Grove. Set in the heart of the city, the Supertree Grove provides a different aesthetic to the rest of the city whether you observe from the ground or take a walk across the bridge. Great exploring during the day, but the area comes alive at night with the different coloured lights and even open-air music that plays regularly. A very striking attraction and well worth a visit"
,,Nice view,3.0,,"As compared to marina bay sands view, this is ok. If you tried marina bay sands view from 56th floor. No need to go OCBC. If you have enough leisure time, just try or else we can skip this.

Even they won't allow us to stay longer time in the middle of skyway"
,,A must vidit,5.0,,No trip to Singapore would be complete without visiting one of its most famous sites. One of the best times to visit is in for evenings when the light shows make the sight even more spectacular.
,,SUN ROOM,4.0,,a big sunroom. 47 is filmed here. must walk on the bridge in the lushly landscaped enclosure! Those huge beautifully finished and smooth egg shapped boulders are just lovely!
,,Skyline experience!,5.0,,"There are long waiting líneas to get up there. Of course one can't be afraid of altitudes. Once at the top the views of the South Singapore skyline are impressive, specially at night. It's worth a visit and the place has a magic of its own."
,,Views from marina bay sands,5.0,,"we were lucky to have a view from our room at Marina Bay Sands. At night, it is all lit up with every color of the rainbow. Guarantee you haven't ever seen anything like this. The structures are actually vertical gardens; amazing!"
,,Captivating,5.0,,We were lucky enough to enjoy the weekend evening sound and light show which was truly wonderful. My wife would return to Singapore just to watch this show again. Pitty we were not allowed to walk the elevated walkway due to the risk of thunders.
,,"Average, nothing new",3.0,,Mediocre place. Neutral thoughts to this. It is very hot in the day though. Go at night. Food is overpriced
,,Great by day but spectacular by night,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove in the Gardens by the Bay complex is great by day, they are large and tower over you. However by night they come into their own. They are lit up and for half an hour there is a music and light show in the grove that is not to be missed. We were lucky enough to see the operatic show and it was amazing."
,,Super tree grive,5.0,,A very magical place a must see especially when they have a show of lights and music the over all experience is very breath taking. It doesn’t cost anything to enter but you can pay to go up in among the lovely trees if that what you call them.
,,Come at the Light Show,4.0,,It seems that half of Singapore is here on the Light Show timings from 7 onwards. Its packed with people! Note that Singapore bathrooms has no Bidet! bring wet tissues and napkins if you have bladder problems!
,,Lay back,5.0,,Find a spot with enough room so you can lay down and take in the lights and music of the Super trees. We took in the 8:45 pm show but there were still lots of people around so get there early to secure a good spot
,,Great concept,4.0,,An extremely clever idea and well put together. I saw during the day so perhaps not at it's best with the lights.
,,ORANGE GROVE,5.0,,"This place was so pretty to see in the day or at night. It lights up and makes you feel like you are at Disney World. Hey, where's Mickey and Minnie Mouse?"
,,Garden with great view,5.0,,"Having wandered through the gardens it was great to look down on where we had been, small que for tickets but soon served and on our way to the top. 15 minute limit as only 70 people at a time can be on the walkways but worth it for the expirience, some great photos."
,,Magical and unforgettable,5.0,,"This truly is a must see when in Singapore. After visiting the Gardens by the Bay and Cloud Forest, we arrived at the Supertree Grove around 1.5 hours before the night show. There were only a handful people around at this time.
And it was worth it!

Watching the day turn to night as the backdrop of the Supergrove Trees was beautiful, but the night show was something truly magical! If you only have one night in Singapore I recommend seeing this (I was next to a couple who were seeing it for a second night in a row).

There are plenty of spots to grab a seat, relax and enjoy the view."
,,Must see experience in Singapore,5.0,,The Supertree Grove at the Gardens by the Bay is a must see in Singapore. Nightly there are light and show performances in the garden with stunning productions al at no cost.
,,Must see,5.0,,"This was on my bucket list and I wasn't disappointed, visiting here in the daytime is nice but when it gets dark and the 'trees' light up is a whole new ball game, very sci fi feel to it all"
,,Stupendous and inspiring!,5.0,,"The super tree grove is an amazing addition to Singapore's attractions. The eco-friendly structures and skyway are incorporated in beautiful tropical gardens and some trees are open to the public. The night-time sound and light show is free and was absolutely beautiful, if crowded."
,,Nice feature set in the gardens,5.0,,Lovely feature set in the gardens acroos from Marina bay sands. great light and sound show in the evenings somwhat magical and fantasy.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,We took a tour which included coming to the Gardens to view the fantastic light show. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The light show is a definite MUST SEE!!!
,,One of a kind.,5.0,,A nightly light and audio show is hugely popular with tourists as well as native Singaporeans amidst this grove of super trees. People of all ages converge on this area to sit or lie down for the show.
,,Worth a visit for the light show,4.0,,"Visited the Supertree Grove in the evening to see the light show. Well worth the visit and there were many people there for the light show.

Due to its popularity I would recommend that you either leave the light show a bit early or wait until a majority of the crowd has left (I recommend the former) as it was bit of a wait to get out of the Grove and a que at the MRT."
,,another amazing sight..,5.0,,"Singapore - its an unbelievable place...they do everything to perfection - so clean and well organized, and beautifully designed and constructed..lovely to look at in the day time and even more beautiful at night"
,,Amazing Light Show,5.0,,"Come here just for thw light show. The combination of the light and the music is very wonderful. The show started at about 8 pm. Just come earlier so u can have a nice spot.

Nb: for the showlight u don't have to pay anything. If u using MRT just drop off at Marine Bay Station at The Shoppes Mall which u can also shopping many luxurious brands"
,,Must see,5.0,,Had a great time here this is a must see and do when in Singapore.Very easy to get to with public transport
,,Amazing day and night,5.0,,You need to visit during the day to see the structures up close and again at night to watch the lights and colours change.
,,Go See it!,5.0,,Go at night to see this fantastic exhibit and make sure you see the show. It is amazing!! Beautifully done and makes for great pictures and memories.
,,Supertree Grove - Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"Supertree Grove - Gardens by the Bay. Admission is free to this attraction. We used the Skyway to view the Supertree Grove. Built 22 metres above ground, the OCBC Skyway was constructed to give visitors the unique sensation of floating above the ground. A truely wonderful experience."
,,Highly Recommended,5.0,,"One of my highlights in this Vacation, it was more than i pictured it would be.
Everything is just gorgeous to look at, the architecture of the gardens is superb.

For those wanting to explore the OCBC Skyway (S$8 entrance fee for 15 min),i recommend that you go in the morning or in the afternoon
for pictures (if you want a good shot!) and exploration purposes, if you’re afraid of heights better just stay on the grounds, the pathway/bridge of the Skyway gets a little shaky while walking.
By 5pm onwards it gets too crowded,everyone (tourist groups as well) comes here to witness the beauty of the illumination
and the Skyway is overcrowded too,at night.

But that S$8 walk is worth every penny."
,,Both day or night visits were impressive,5.0,,"This is our second trip here in 3 years and we did both day and night strolls. We are most impressed by the size of the project and the imaginations that went into it. Giant manmade trees with orchids and plants climbing on the structure to form ""natural trees"" . The property is immaculately manicured and kept clean despite visitors running into the thousands daily. A light show was given twice nightly that approaches fantasy and real showing off the structures and plants. A walkway about 60 feet in the air connects the trees togeter and gave a stunning view to tree tops and plants below, as well as some city lights. Worth the trip."
,,Picturesque man made structures,5.0,,"The Gardens by the Bay is a beautiful picturesque view of man made structures, best enjoyed at night when all the lights are on."
,,Amazing manmade tree constructions,5.0,,"The Gardens by the Bay are full of amazing manmade structures and the Supertree Grove is one of them. There are eighteen tree-like structures in total in the gardens, twelve in the Grove, the 'trees' are stunning to see at no cost from a distance and from standing directly underneath. There is a fee though to take the Skyway aerial walk high up in the trees. The trees, standing twenty five to fifty metres tall, stretch above the canopies of the surrounding vegetation, they are a spectacle to view both day and night, they provide shade and the structure allows for vertical garden plantings."
,,This place is amazing,5.0,,Well worth visiting as these 'trees' are a technological and engineering marvel. The skywalk/bridge between the trees is also well worth doing as the views over Singapore are amazing.
,,Must Visit,5.0,,Wonderful place. The light show is amazing. The sky walk way is beautiful to enjoy some view of Singapore.
,,Night Tour,5.0,,"We were here as part of a tour. The Light show at night is stunning. Well recommended, Come early if your are not with a group as the Light show is very popular - with good reason."
,,Great place for Photography,5.0,,Night time Photography dream. If you’re into night time Photography then you will love this place when all the trees and gardens are lit up.
,,Best part of Garden by the Bay,5.0,,The beauty of Super tree Grove can be better appreciated post dusk when the lights come on. Light and sound program is held around the Super tree Grove. Its quite fascinating and shouldn't be missed.
,,Must see!,5.0,,"It’s a incredible human work from future! The garden is very amazing and it’s made with think for environment, recreation of equatorial forests, Japanise , Chinese, Indian and others gardens."
,,Amazing Amazing and again AMAZING,5.0,,We did the supertree grove in the evening when all the lights are on. Amazing experience. Also stay for the lightshow in the evening.
,,See both day and night,5.0,,Loved the whole Gardens by the Bay complex. By day view the trees and wonderful plants growing up the and walk the skywalk. Good view of Marina Bay Sands and the rest of Singapore from up there. At night the best thing to do is park yourself under a tree lie down relax and marvel at the music and light show. I enjoyed this more than the light and water show at the Burj Khalifa in Dubai as it has a very serene and relaxed feel and it was not over crowded plenty of room for all.
,,Amazong,5.0,,"This was one of my favourite experience in Singapore, and in all of SE Asia. We went at night for the light show and were blown away. It was simply amazing. We have never experienced anything like it. Cannot recommend highly enough."
,,One of the most amazing man made attraction,5.0,,"First off I’m usually not into these tourist traps BUT this is definitely worth the trip If you go to Singapore. And it’s FREE. In the day time the trees are impressive but truly come
To life at night. It is busy though expect crowds but so worth it. We paid to do the sky walk. Only $8 but
They try to push you through so you’re only on the walk for 20 min. I strongly suggest to plan a few hours there. Go early and walk or go inside the bio domes. Then wait for sunset and watch those trees in colour. Amaaazing. We watched the light show from a platform a little further and it was really good. When you’re close you hear the music but don’t have the full effect of the 14 plus trees in the show. Go go go. Thumbs up."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"An incredible site, photos don't do it justice.
We walked on the canopy about 6pm and waited until 7.45 for the light show. It was fantastic, not to be missed. What should be missed are the very long queues for a taxi. We could gave been there for hours, we decided to walk up the road and hailed one."
,,Spectacular day and night,5.0,,"This is a must see when in Singapore. Dramatic tree-like structures with an elevated walkway, (at a modest cost). Dramatic during the day they are spectacular at night, especially during the 15 minute music and light spectacular every evening at 19.45."
,,Artificial but worth seeing,5.0,,Super Trees are the place at Garden by the Bay. Trees are artificially designed but become major landmark of Singapore. It is one of its kind place in the world. There is sky Bridge between different trees where tourists enjoy sky walk after purchasing tickets. At night there is special light show arrangements which attracts tourists to visit at night.
,,You’ve got to go,5.0,,A really great place and especially at night when lit up. A must do together with the adjoining gardens.
,,Really come alive at night,4.0,,"Interesting during the day but it is night when these things really impress. The ‘sound and light’ show in the evening (7:45 and 8:45) was excellent. Don’t mind that it was opera, it was fantastic and unexpectedly moving."
,,Amazing - especially the free light and music show at night,5.0,,"We loved Supertree Grove and came back at night time to watch the free light and music show. Even though its was busy, there was still plenty of space to spread out. Our young kids absolutely loved it! It's easily accessibly by the MRT."
,,MESMERIZING EXPERIENCE!,5.0,,"One of the greatest place I have ever been! lush surrounding, clean venue and easy to access. Most of all, the spectacular light show was mind blowing!"
,,Visited during the Christmas celebration,5.0,,Well decorated for the Christmas holiday. Lots to see and do. Light shows etc... They also have lots of Christmas food and drink stalls.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Haven't seen anything like this, a must see you won't be disappointed, great pics calming and worth a visit"
,,Best time is at night!,5.0,,Best time to go is at night when the tress are lit up and changes colors. They also do a light show where the tress changes colors and go along with the music that's playing.
,,Great light & music show!,5.0,,We spent the day at Gardens By The Bay which was absolutely amazing & stood around for the 8pm light show @Supertree Grove which was even more amazing! You must see this if ever in Singapore! We purchased our tickets online thru expedia for $30pp which was worth it. The light show is included in the price of the admission. If you get there early enough you can see the show from the skywalk! Skywalk was $5pp more but they only allow a certain amount of people up there & close after the light show. This is a MUST SEE!
,,Very futuristic-looking & awesome light-show at night,5.0,,"Absolutely amazing. The grove is comprised of supertrees, which range in height from 25 to 50 metres. They are most amazing to view at night when they are colourfully lit up during the spectacular light show. Nicer views can be had by going on the OCBC Skyway, which is 22-metres above ground level."
,,Has to be seen to be believed,5.0,,"7.45pm each night this grove is lit up, the lights in the super trees pulsate to the music, creatiing a magical show that is emotional with its beauty. To be in Singapore and miss this show would be a tragedy ."
,,Night time highlights,5.0,,"My wife and I have visited the Gardens by the Bay many times, but always by day. This year we went at night. The free light show takes place every evening and is very well worth experiencing."
,,Enjoy!,5.0,,"What is there not to like? Sci-fi trees avatar like, changing colours, music, guaranteed to leave smiling. And it is FREE!"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,A must to-do in Singapore. Just stunning visuals and a wonderful evening out. Lots to experience in the area. Would be a shame not to include this in your Singapore experience
,,Good Great ... Take Your Time .. Only One Way,3.0,,"** It is one way only - so take your time. **
I have issues up high and about 1/3 of the way across my legs turned to jelly so we moved across here quite quickly - my fault trying to get to the other side. Got to other side and once I was okay, went to move back onto walkway to take pictures only to be told no. No signage saying one way only. Very disappointing!!!!!
Family missed out on some great photos due to me, so waste of money for us.
** Remember, once up on the walkway, it is one way only - don't go to other end until you are ready to leave as you won't be able to go back on the walkway, even to take pictures **"
,,Go at dusk!,5.0,,"We walked through here just as the sun was setting and the lights were turning on. It was cooler then. You can walk through the tree forest free on the ground but you’ll have to buy a ticket if you want to take the skywalk up in the air. We were there in a crowded Friday night and it was about an hour wait so unfortunately, we had to skip that part."
,,Supertree Grove,4.0,,"A beautiful quiet and relaxing walk in the ""Gardens by the bay"" of Singapore. The spot is really peaceful."
,,great for both day and night visits,5.0,,"We came here a few times and saw all the sites, the night show was sensational as we found a spot away from the crowd where we could see all the trees. We Also went up the supertree bar, this is a great place for a drink and look around but you cant see the light show that well. We also went to the restaurant on the next level down and again you cant get a good view of the light show plus the meal wasn’t that good, the staff were ok but didnt seem to give that little be extra to make it special"
,,Nightime Wonder,5.0,,"Be there by 7.30 pm, and find a good spot to sit and be mesmerised by the dazzling light show of these magnificent flower encrusted towers. There is an upper walkway for a small entry fee. Sadly the bad weather prevented our entry on the night. There is also a bar on top of one of the towers. It was 20 Singapore Dollars entry with a free drink thrown in. Probably good value for the experience."
,,Check the weather,4.0,,"We strolled through the grove (which is free entry and then paid to access the skywalk. The views from the skywalk were stunning, but it is a very short walk that can be covered in 15 minutes. A good tip is to check the weather forecast and the scan the skies before paying as the skywalk is closed down during rain storms (which are frequent and very sudden in Singapore). We were lucky enough to have finished our walk, but there were lots of people who hadn't who were ushered back down. The views were great though."
,,Very impressive trees,5.0,,"The grove is another must see in Singapore. Admission is free. The entrance is a little hard to find. You have to find your way through the Marina Bay Sands hotel. There is an elevator outside near the middle, that gets you to the sky bridge, which crossed through the hotel hall to the gardens.
The area is most beautiful during the holidays, but worth a visit anytime."
,,Super Cool,5.0,,"The trees are incredible and so futuristic ... a must see when in Singapore - especially at night. There are shuttles around the park, but you'll have to pay. We went around Christmas and there is a light show to music."
,,Nice for an hour (at most),3.0,,Nice park to have a walk in the afternoon. The Xmas Wonderland and light show was a disappointment. They charge you SDG10 for the privilege to be able to be inside a park that is supposed to be free access.
,,Awesome supertrees,5.0,,"Best to walk through them at twilight to really appreciate how lovely they are. If you don't like the music being played, wait a little and a different type will come on."
,,EXCELLENT MERGING OF NATURE WITH THE ARTIFICIAL,5.0,,The best time to visit this area is early morning or late afternoon when the humidity and sun heat are not so intense. No one who visit Singapore should leave without visiting this area along the river bank.
,,We walked here every night,5.0,,"There is the water show in front of the hotel; however, there is a light show here every half-hour as well. The night we went was Broadway songs. I actually enjoyed it more than the other one. But neither should be missed. These trees are beautiful at both day and night. It is well worth the time to come see them."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is a must see when in Singapore, it is truly wonderful and will become one of your highlights of the Lion City."
,,Day time,4.0,,"Part of gardens by the bay and enroute to marina bay sands. Quiter during the daytime and now the pictures are marred by the garish xmas stalls. As mentioned by other reviewers, the evening light and music show is special, but prepare for the crowds"
,,Great at night,5.0,,Really interesting part of of Singapore and we went during the day and at night with the light show which was really good
,,Don't miss it- a highlight of Singapore!,5.0,,"Even if you can't make the night-time light show, this fantastic garden is well worth the visit. Take the time to walk among the supertrees (there's a lift to get there), and to explore the Cloud Forest. We were there at Christmas time, so there were additional lovely decorations. There are benches for rest and snack shops to restore, so take your time. There's nothing else like it!"
,,Night = Magical,5.0,,"In the day, you might this it's breathtaking. After the sun dips, it will definitely be magical! Do stay for the Garden Rhapsody which happens daily at 745pm & 845pm. This is where the area will be filled with lights in perfect sync to the songs."
,,Mesmerizing experience,5.0,,"Truly amazing experience to visit skywalk. Charged additional to go on sky walk. Enjoy light shows at 7.45 and 8.45 for 15 minutes. U can see this for free of cost from open garden below supertree grove trees. U can see supertree grove from garden itself that too free of cost. Only cloud dome, flower dome and skywalk is chargeable.
After light show go and see the whole city view, singapore flyer view at night, its amazing."
,,Impressive Light Show In The Evening,5.0,,"Get along for this light show at night, as it is quite colourful and includes an integrated sound show. At this time of year, a Christmas theme."
,,Stay for the light show,5.0,,There are 2 light shows in the Supertree Grove daily. One starts at 7:45pm and the other one at 9:45pm. We watched part of the 7:45pm show when we visited there two weeks ago because of the heavy downpour.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,These trees are amazing during both the day and night! We had the pleasure of witnessing the Christmas light show which was playing each night. Great for those of all ages!
,,not good,1.0,,i did not go up for the simple reason and I think it is wrong that you are required to pay to enter some christmas display. also they wont sell you the ticket for the christmas display at main counter. seems a bit convoluted forcing people to pay for something they dont want. I chose not to go for that reason. they are neat to look at from below and at night they come alive with light which make them that more interesting. i suspect you would get good views of the area from them.
,,Nothing like it anywhere else.,5.0,,"The supertree grove is simply astounding, by day, and maybe even more so at night, with the added bonus of a light show at night within the trees as a companion to the light show at Marina Bay. Take the bridge that connects the supertrees and really immerse yourself."
,,Wow!,5.0,,Such a beautiful place! The skywalk is amazing and the trees themselves so beautiful. Such a brilliant idea and so unique. Love them at night time.
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"Absolutely fantastic, a MUST SEE, 8:30PM every night it transforms into a spectacular light and sound show"
,,Monster trees,4.0,,"Light show in evening with music realy super, gud creativity must see place during Singapore visit enjoy"
,,Amazing light and sound show on Sundays,5.0,,"Got treated to a lovely light and sound show, which was quite unexpected and unplanned. Even without that, it's a lovely place, built with care and love. Good for spending a evening or afternoon. And lovely place for a early morning jog."
,,Musical Lighting Show in Supertree Grove,3.0,,"Daily show of Musical Lighting are held two times in a day around evening time.

Yet you still can enjoy the garden in daylight. quite pretty.
If you have another 8 SGD, you can also buy a ticket and go up to OCBC Sky Way, which is connecting couple super trees."
,,"Iconic symbols of Singapore, it was fantastic to get up close",5.0,,"Even though they were closed due to weather cautions it was absolutely exciting to be close by the Supertrees. They are majestic and though so tall and seemingly far away they were easy to catch in photographs. Man made trees that light up at night but are a good example of how to create outstanding features that become ""must-see"" attractions."
,,True Singapore magic,5.0,,"You have to go on Orchard road then into orchard gardens at night. A free show for family's , romantic couples and pensioners like me and the wife.
Not only are you going to see a magical light show which Singapore is famous for but a music show as well. An hour of magic. Film it to show friends at home. Worth a trip at dusk."
,,Enjoy panoramic vistas & Iconic giants,5.0,,"Measuring between 25 and 50 metres tall, Gardens by the Bay's Super-trees are designed with large canopies that provide shade in the day and come alive with an exhilarating display of lights and sounds at night."
,,Amazing structures,5.0,,"The grove of trees is simply amazing. During the day they are spectacular but at night it just goes to another level. You just sit there in awe, as do hundreds of others, looking at the spectacle that is this grove of artificial trees as they are lit up. It is also best to see them at night because of the heat during the day. Entry is free but there is a small fee if you want to do the sky walk."
,,Excellant,5.0,,"I wasn't sure about the walk from one of the trees to another, as I'm not that keen on heights, however, it was fine - even if I did walk slowly to start with. Lovely views."
,,Speechless,5.0,,"No words to describe this part of our tour...A must see place.well illuminated and decorated with chrismas theme to put people in the festive mood.there were food stalls,game stalls...oopsss missed the snow part though...enjoyed much...Just one advice purchase the hippo card online very helpful to skip long queue."
,,Something to see,4.0,,avoid the weekend and try not to go during the afternoon heat as there is not much shade. the best times are early morning and in the evening for the light show
,,Must see,4.0,,This is just one of several lovely environmental areas of Singapore which all adjoin making it simple to spend a afternoon in such a peaceful atmosphere. Do it!
,,Always a sight u Enjoy,5.0,,Always a sight u enjoy especially at night. Do wait for the light show daily at 8pm to complete your visit here.
,,Be there for the light show.,5.0,,The light show at Supertree Grove in Gardens by the Bay is simply amazing. Be there early to get a decent seat on the rise above the plaza where the trees are. The young can lie on their backs to enjoy the show.
,,Very good,5.0,,Well put together. Ensure you pay to go up and take in the views. Do not forget to go bakc at night to see the light show.
,,Amazing,5.0,,We went to the evening light show and were so happy that we did. It was amazing with lots of colour and music. Well worth a visit.
,,Night visit,5.0,,We followed on our day after the botanical gardens and marine park. We had the chance to go and listen to Christmas songs with the lights off and on in unison. We also walked the skyline walk which gave the most beautiful night time views. It was a very warm night and sitting under the lights and listening to the Xmas songs was really very nice.
,,"Lovely at night, excellent idea",4.0,,"Lovely at night, excellent idea. loved every minute of it. very nice atmosphere, plenty of restaurant available and great choice"
,,wow at dat and wow at night,5.0,,on 19:45 there is a light show that you cannot pass. these trees worth the climb and try to take pictures in daytime and night time. very close to walk around and not far away from other attractions
,,a must to go there at night,5.0,,"a must to go there at night to see it all light up with music playing,we went back there lots of times"
,,Stunning Design,4.0,,"The Supertree Grove is beautiful to walk around and enjoy day or night. The main 'Supertree' costs $20 pp to enter, and comes with a complimentary drink. At night time these trees light up in an array of beautiful colours and patterns aligning to music, currently, Christmas Carols. We were not able to enter the DragonFly Walkway due to inclement weather. The rooftop bar is a beautiful perspective of the Marina Bay Sands and surrounds."
,,Awesome Views,5.0,,We left at 5 am to be able to view the Grove in dark as well as during the day. Were there till 9 am and had breakfast in the cafe nearby. Amazing place to visit
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Had a lovely evening here. Beautiful music and amazing light show. What a truely beautiful and amazing place.
,,A Place For People of all ages,5.0,,"This is a definite must for anyone wanting to see the sights of Singapore – the light show was the highlight, in my opinion and great for people of all ages to enjoy. The trees themselves were extremely impressive and unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. I would definitely recommend this."
,,Nice and Relaxing Place,5.0,,Amazing place and very relaxing to be after a meal at one of the restaurant. Sitting down watching the trees dances to the music is awesome.
,,Go at nigth,5.0,,The trees are such a big highlight of a trip to Singapore as they are so beautiful and breathtaking. You do not realise how tall the trees are until your next to one. I would recommend going at night so you can see the light show and the trees all lit up.
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,it opens at 9.00 am till 2.00 pmm and reopens at 4.00 pm till night. You can enjoy walking along the OCBC skywalk and have a good view of Marina Bay Sands Hotel
,,fantastic,5.0,,"an amazing place to visit, watch the super trees light up at night, looked fantastic, they have got their Christmas tickets entry for 6 dollars"
,,amazng light show,5.0,,"well worth the visit, the light show is amazing. The walk way is well worth a visit if you're ok with heights, go at dusk and make sure you're back on the ground before the light show starts its by far the best place to view the show."
,,Relaxing,4.0,,"I really liked this Grove. I went for a walk here at night, i found it peaceful and totally relaxing."
,,Really cool part of gardens by the bay,5.0,,This definitely must not be missed and is a really cool part of the gardens by the bay. Definitely show up for the light show at dark. We saw it from the Singapore flyer and it was a great show!
,,Science Fiction come to life,5.0,,There is something so magical about Supertree Grove - be sure to check it out in the evening when the light & music show are in full swing. You will feel like you are in a scene from Blade Runner!
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"It is so much fun to see by day but more impressive at night as the lights create a different experience. I loved it, could not stop taking photos from different angles."
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,"An amazing free night time performance of light and sound. Popular themed music, such as Harry Potter and Star Wars, play as the giant Supertrees light up in a magnificent display of colour. Lay down and watch in marvel at a spectacular show."
,,Only got to go at night :(,4.0,,"I didn't have enough time to get here during the day, so I'm very sad I missed out on the sky walk! It's closed at night, which sucks. But still lovely to see the lights in the night. I'll try to go back again so I can do the walk!"
,,fantastic city views from the skywalk,5.0,,Went on the skywalk when the light show was on. Views of the city skyline are worth the visit. Light show is very good but you can enjoy this easily from the ground. Well worth a visit. Avoid weekends if you are hoping to catch a taxi back. It gets very crowded.
,,Fanciful,5.0,,"Just go, its the place of dreams. Having seen it on David Attenboroughs tv programme we new it was going to be fantastic.Dont miss it."
,,Night time visit is a must,4.0,,Night time show is great and really pretty! Not too busy but arrive early to get a good spot. Would recommend a visit.. plus it is free :)
,,super trees singapore,5.0,,"if yoour going to singapore you have to go see the super trees,they are wonderful structures that light up on a night ,you can see them from the skywalk of marina bay towers or you can walk right up close near the gardens"
,,great view,4.0,,"stunning view around garden by the bay, supercool light show at night, great view of marina bay sands hotel like the flowers."
,,Man made wonder,5.0,,"A visit to Singapore and without seeing the Garden by the bays and Supertrees there and you surely have missed something wonderful. Take a walk in the Gardens especially in the evening time when the whole area is lit up and there is music playing and light show. Do not miss this opportunity, its free. What more can you ask for!"
,,Stay for the evening light show,5.0,,"These trees are so beautiful, during the day and evening.. The light show in the evening was specipular.. make sure you a spot to lay down and look up to the trees during the light show... pretty fun!"
,,"After sunset, stay for light/sound show!",5.0,,Reasonable fee to enjoy view of skyline; stay for the entertainment after dark! Christmas carols with pretty light display!
,,A fantastic concept,5.0,,"Who ever thought of the super grove is just a genius.

In the day these big trees are just so impressive making a statement within the gardens but also providing a sky walk 20m+ in the air as well as a sky bar for those who wish to rest.

At night the complex has a light show with music on weekends starting at 7.45pm every hour. There are Good view platforms at the MRT footbridge and the hotel nearby but being in the park to experience the atmosphere and music is special - all free.

If you also want to see the laser show in Marina Bay then they are on the hour from 8.0pm - allow 30 minutes between at least. Suggest you start with the Gardens since the crow leaving makes it difficult to cross from the bay since walkways are not wide enough."
,,AMAZING STRUCTURES,5.0,,"These are part of the Garden Bay complex and have been show cased very well in the film Crazy Rich Asians. Well worth timing your visit so that you are in place to see them light up. However, it does get really busy at this time as hordes of people visit at this time for the very same reason."
,,Incredable Structures,5.0,,"We have now visited Supertree Grove on two occasions , once during the day , the other at night.
Amazing structures looking like large trees covered in tropical plants and vines , great during the day , magnificient when the trees are all lit up with lights at night.
Stunning , a must see attraction"
,,huge metal trees,5.0,,plants growing up and the metal trees that are part of the Gardens by the bay daily shows with light and sound
,,Must see!!,5.0,,"This is by far one of the best tourist attractions that I have seen in a long time, was better than I had evert imagined. If you are lucky enough to get a table at the restaurant in the evening then you will have a fat better experience."
,,Beautiful place and well maintained,5.0,,Beautiful place and well maintained. Natural environment. Exceptional good. Must visit place in Singapore
,,Good from far at night,1.0,,"Quite boring during the day, and starting to look old. It looks pretty with the lights on at night from a distance. Paying to go on top of the tree (the restaurant and bar) is definitely not worth it, because the trees are built in a depression, it's not impressive. The bar at the top is derelict and not in use. Better spend money to good to the sands hotel..."
,,Fantastics came true,5.0,,You will feel yourself as fantastic film participants when walking through theese supertrees! I recommend to do it in evening time when you can take colorful photos!
,,Beautiful day or night,5.0,,These trees are amazing. There is a walkway between some of them. One has a restaurant on top with great food.
,,Great light show,4.0,,"The supertree grove is interesting in the day time, but comes alive at night especially during the 15 minute sound and light show. WOW! We really enjoyed it. There was plenty of seating and many people laid on their backs to watch the show. The supertree concept is interesting by itself - and combined with the elevated walkway (extra charge) you can have a lot of fun. It was great to view the supertrees from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel Skypark as well. With free admission, I would recommend this."
,,Beautifully stunning,5.0,,"What a beautiful place. Just wish I had enough time to come back of an evening when the lights get turned on. This attraction is absolutely stunning. Go to Bayfront on the circle line and it’s just a short walk. If your in Singapore this place is a must do, you won’t be let down."
,,Enchanting and inspiring,5.0,,"This place is perfect for sunset. If you go there some time around six thirty, you can be there for the setting sun, which is amazing. The supertrees are one thing during the day, but at night they transform and are breathtakingly beautiful."
,,Nice light show!,4.0,,The light show is really nice but I think the sound system is not loud enough. The best way to watch the light show is lying on the ground and it's not to dirty. This garden is interesting.
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"The supertree grove music show, daily at 7:45 and 8:45pm is the highlight of gardens by the bay. It is magical to sit under the trees and enjoy the lights."
,,All about the view,5.0,,"Quite a unique experience walking from man-made treetop to man-made treetop and taking in the views on the gardens in the Bay area and beyond.
For a nominal fee you can do the walk and see the sights, but may not recommend if you are not a fan of heights because you do feel quite exposed, but it is an experience not to forget.
Even if you stay at ground level the trees are quite a spectacle & super impressive to behold.
Lots of photo opportunities."
,,Don't miss the free light show!,5.0,,"This part of the gardens is great by day, but really comes to life at night. The structures themselves are awesome by day but the free light show is not to be missed!"
,,Supertree grove,5.0,,Marvellous modern architecture. Must visit when in Singapore. Ideal for photo shoot during evening / night period.
,,The Supertree Grove in the Gardens by the Bay Unique to Singapore,5.0,,"I visited these Supertrees in the daylight as well as at night. They are impressive by day but super-impressive by night. The 15 minute sound and light show is worth seeing and lots of fun. These Supertrees are unique and will not be found anywhere else, so definitely worth a visit."
,,Stunning show,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is truly a sight to behold. At night the view is simply outstanding, and the 15 minute light show, set to music is stunning. The park is few to enter so definitely worth a visit at night time."
,,nice view,4.0,,"once you have to experience it, view is very good from top. super tree looks very different from the top"
,,Don't miss these trees!,5.0,,"These are an absolute delight. Wandering around them in the daylight is great, but be sure to come back for the Rhapsody in the Gardens show at 7:45 pm or 8:45 pm each night - it's truly magical! The crowds show up in droves, but you should be able to see from just about anywhere in the garden, so get there a little early and take a seat. The show lasts 15 minutes, and you can follow it by walking across the bridge to Marina Bay Sands to see a second light show at 9:00 pm (this might only be on weekends, I'm not sure). To get there, follow signs for the Bayfront MRT station until you see signs for Shoppes - then, you'll see a big dock with seats, and the seats will be facing the light show!"
,,Awesome..stunning during day and night,5.0,,"n a recent family visit to Singapore this was definitely on our list of places to visit. The structure is massive and so iconic for Singapore it is hard to miss, dominating the Gardens By the Bay. It is worth visiting just to see the unreal architecture and the amazing views both day and night

Equally it plays a key in the Light show in the Bay so it is amazing to see at night as well. A must visit in Singapore to sample the atmosphere and architecture of the city and at night to see them light up to music..an unique experience"
,,Breath taking,5.0,,"Saw the light show as part of the tour. It was so beautiful, it made me cry. Make sure you find a space well before the light show starts so you can lie down to enjoy the show."
,,A unique concept and beautiful presentation,5.0,,Very interesting design and concept. Eeryone enjoys. Do not miss the light and sound show during evening. No additional ticket is required for the show.
,,Lovely walk in the trees and great light show at night,5.0,,"The Gardens by the Bay is a very relaxing place to walk around. This is right next door to the Marina Bay Sands hotel and there was a great view of the Supertree Grove from the rooftop of the hotel. The light show, done twice nightly, was dazzling. The show I saw was set to 70's disco music, and while I am not a big fan of the music, the show was awesome. And the backdrop of the MBS hotel was spectacular."
,,"Amazing show, extraordinary place",5.0,,Really a must do for anyone visiting Singapore. The show will take your breath away and the place is just so nice to have a walk in.
,,Light show is wonderfull,5.0,,The light show starts @7pm. It is in open air. You will experience the technology is being used so delicately to show firework and a combination music with light show.
,,Amazing sight at night!,5.0,,"Supertree Grove forms an integral part of Gardens by the Bay and has become a representative of Gardens by the Bay and in fact, Singapore itself.

It looks quite amazing at night than the day, and it is a sight to behold when the show takes place at 7:45 pm and 8:45 pm. People are allowed to lie down on bare ground to see the amazing light and music show that takes place. Supertree grove is a wonderful spot to take pics as well.

PS: the show is free and doesn't require even a stamp so chill, and enter without any pre-requisite procedures to enjoy the show."
,,Unusual but beautiful,5.0,,"Nice place to walk around and take a few pictures. There's a light show (free entry) which is absolutely amazing, with the lights so in sync with the music."
,,The show,3.0,,The lighting shownis in the evening at 7:30pm. Show was fairly nice. With music that will put you on groove. You can dance while admiring the lightings. No need an entry ticket to watch it. Been there before during the day. Nice to go for a stroll. If only there are giant mist fans around the area as it was a hot humid weather.
,,Very nice laser show,4.0,,The big structures have plants growing on them. Looks spectacular when the light show starts in the evening. Kids loved it and so did we.
,,Mind blowing!,5.0,,This has to be one of the best experiences in Singapore....we not only saw the fantastic light show but had the BEST music in sync with the trees flashing....highly recommend.
,,Magical fly flowers,3.0,,When you walk out from marina bay sands hotel around 10 mins . You will reach the amzing garden. They had a music show with light effects.
,,Brilliant Experience,5.0,,"Went for the light show at night, was brilliant experience - the light show was choreographed with a best of Broadway music through a tannoy system. Brilliant experience, everybody sat or lying down looking up at the light show. Recommended."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Spectacular especially at night when there is a huge light show. The whole ""stem"" is made of cascades of plants. Well worth seeing."
,,Magnificent and Devine!,5.0,,"By far the best place to visit in Singapore. The Gardens by the Bay is incomplete without the Super Tree walk. Yes, you have to pay a few dollars each but you get to admire the beauty, architect and hard work put into this piece of art. A sustainable tourist attraction and by night one of the most beautiful views.

Not a huge regret if you didn't get to talk across but you will feel as if you missed out on what everyone else was doing up there... just saying... go back home with a story to tell and how you could see some fantastic views."
,,Enjoyable,3.0,,You can walk up to and around the trees for free. Sg$8 to walk on the raised walkway. Free wifi around the trees. Light and music show twice a day in the evening. Around 7.45 and 8.45. Lots pretty at night when alluminated.
,,Spectacular nighttime display.,5.0,,"Do not miss this fantastic display at night. Beautiful lights, which change to the music. 2 shows per night. Loved it."
,,Beautiful night time event!,5.0,,Loved watching and listening during the night time extravaganza! What an amazing and entertaining show! Don’t miss this!
,,Amazing View,4.0,,First view of the Super tree is amazing. Watching the top from the bottom is great. Looks so beautiful. Specially the light show is so beautiful. its relaxing to watch lights on it in the specially in the night.
,,Awesome lighting,4.0,,"Do not thinking it will be a tree and plants. Yes there is a beautiful garden, but the aweomeness is come from the LED show. Better come in the dark time, on 7pm they have a special show."
,,Great at night!!,4.0,,Good at night and to combine with the light show at marina bay. Lay down under the trees and look up :).
,,Very cool place,5.0,,We absolutely loved Supertree Grove and it was the only part of the gardens we managed to visit. Highly recommended for the nightly show. Lay down in the middle of the them on the concrete and soak it all in. Only negative is it doesnt go for long enough!!
,,Awesome,5.0,,Wow what a beautiful night out . The super grove trees spectacular was brilliant the music and light show was awesome !
,,Worth the additional fee,5.0,,"Enter by lift and admire the view from the treetops, again i would advise that you visit early as queues will form in the afternoon."
,,Wow!!,5.0,,The night light and sound show is spectacular and a must see. If you can get into the VIP area the view of the show is great.
,,Absolutely a must,5.0,,Went to the Supertree son et lumiere (light show) last evening. It was incredible. The display is our of this world (both light and sound). Recommend you get there well ahead of the start time and find a good location and enjoy the experience
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"Very nice place to visit with either friends or family, especially at night. The music and light show is simply amazing. Not to be missed and it is free."
,,Must See,5.0,,The light show is free and is easy to access from Marina Bay Sands. For a place to sit come 30-40 minutes before the show as it gets pretty busy.
,,"Must visit in Singapore. Come here close to night time, you won't regret it",5.0,,"This place was one of my favorite places in all of Singapore. The entrance is free, I wasn't able to go up on the viewing bridge because it was closed for maintenance and still this place was worth the visit. I have to admit, for me the light show at night time was the wow factor. During the day it looks nice, but if you come to the gardens right at sunset, walk a bit, take some pictures even visit the other places within the gardens, you can catch the first night time show and it is a great time to have. It's nothing out of the ordinary, music with lights but I'm pretty sure you wont find musical trees anywhere else. Not like this anyways. I highly recommend it."
,,Amazing light show,5.0,,This is a highlight of any trip to Singapore and everyone should visit the grove for the evening light shows. These are absolutely amazing.
,,Night Lights,5.0,,"We were able to see the Supertree Grove from our hotel room. What a beautiful sight every night, with colours changing."
,,Most awe inspiring sound and light show,5.0,,The sound and light show was amazing. The choreography was incredible. It is hard to discribe but the music and the lighting were as one. It is a free show that is not to be missed.
,,The light show is lovely,5.0,,We extended our visit to Gardens by the Bay by staying for the light show at the Supertree Grove (7.45p.m. and 8:45p.m. every night and for free). We managed to visit twice during our visit to Singapore this time and there was a different sequence on both nights. The show is now very long - 10-15 minutes but well worth staying for. Our grandchildren loved it.
,,During the evening the trees are absolutly beautifull with all the coloured lights putting up a fantastic show .,5.0,,"Huge crowds , we had a very interesting time @ this venue ,we walked to all of the exhibitions , which were well managed & reasonably priced ."
,,Must see day and night!,5.0,,This place was lovely.......we caught a lift up to the top so we had really good views of Marina Bay Sands hotel so we could take some really good photos. We came back at night when they had a light show with music and it was really good to watch. Get there early if you want a good spot for the light show as it gets really busy.
,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,A must see sight when visit Singapore! Especially stunning during the night time with the lights lit up. Right outside of Gardens by the bay.
,,Majestic & Unique,5.0,,These structures are innovative and futuristic great free place to walk day and night. The show at night is great also.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We got just in time for the show during the night. Lots of people watching and so it was crowded; but, it was a beautiful experience nonetheless."
,,Damn good,5.0,,"I enjoyed bring my family, my uncle and aunties here for a refreshing jog. My pet dog thoroughly loved the scenery as well! We went up the supertree and it was indeed a view to behold."
,,Thats something.,5.0,,"We stay for few hours to see the trees and hear the music, that was magnificent. Its free and one can go there any time. Just don't forget camera, take you time and enjoy the beauty of it."
,,Very nice view,5.0,,Especially at night. This place is a nice place to visit with family and friends. Bring food and water so that you can eat while watching the live show at 7:45 pm. It's free.
,,great place to visit,5.0,,great place to visit specially during the light show. Music a bit outdated but the light show was very nice.
,,The night light show is spectacular!,5.0,,"Amazing constructions that transform to a spectacular light and sound show each evening, well worth the visit and changes regularly."
,,Wonderful night,5.0,,There is some light show at night it seems like I was in Avatar movie! lol I can't explain all of the feeling but if you guys like this movie so you should be there and don't miss the show it will be your another wonderful night for sure :)
,,Supergrove tree,5.0,,Truly an amazing birthday present. Amazing music and light show every evening at 7.15 and 8.15. FREE!
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Visit the Gardens By the Bay ending here. Make sure your seating has a view to most of the trees and watch and listen to the show as they light up and play along to known music pieces.
,,It is manmade but nice,5.0,,"supertree is quite a good thought ,many of those gardens are quite interesting as they are from all part of the world."
,,Relaxing place to walk around,5.0,,"Take time to walk around, enjoy the view,it’s worth it ,a diferent approach to nature ,very futuristic in a way"
,,Still Find it Amazing,5.0,,3 trip to this area. 1st night visit and would definitely recommend people to go and see (free entry). Be eary if you require a seat to see the lights
,,Light show,5.0,,"We caught the light show at the supertree grove from a distance near Bayfront MRT. Nevertheless, the light show was nicely done with accompanying music. The light show could be viewed well even from a distance."
,,Amazing Supertrees,5.0,,The super trees at the gardens by the bay are great but you can't go up without paying. Visit when they are doing the light and sound show as it is amazing
,,Our 4th Time,5.0,,"Every time we visit Singapore my partner insists we go to The Supertree Grove light show, I don't mind as its always great.
It goes for 10 mins twice a night.
We normally visit Singapore around April, but this year we went in October and noticed it was a lot more crowded.
The previous year we went to the top of one of the trees for a drink before the show started, there is also a restaurant on the next level down.
The Skywalk had a never ending line of people wanting to walk above the crowd.
When we go back next year it will be fair to say we will be back for another show."
,,Spectacular Light Show,5.0,,The nightly light shows at the Super Grove were magical...all set to music and the beautiful display of plants and lights were a great experience. There were families everywhere enjoying the parklands all adding to the happy buzz of the place. Very enjoyable!
,,Beautiful setting where Botanic Gardens meet Disney/Broadway,5.0,,"I admit I was a bit skeptical about my visit here - Was I wrong - As you walk to the grove you feel that you are in a beautiful tropical area - transported from the city - Only reminder are the tall iron structures that in the day are covered with tropical plants and flowers adding to the garden area. In the evening, the Super Trees come alive Disney/Broadway style with amazing lights. And twice a night, provide you an visible exploration of color and sound - We had Broadway hits complimented with a colorful display of lights. Go right before dusk and experience the transformation. Go to the Indochine bar to experience from the top and for the best view in Singapore - EVEN over marina bay sands."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Something a little different and well worth a visit. I only managed to visit during daylight hours, but think visiting at night with the illuminations would be even better"
,,Amazing during the night,4.0,,"One should visit the Supertree Grove first during the day, then after sunset and finally during the Garden Rhapsody and so is the show complete."
,,A must do in Singapore!,5.0,,A visit to the Supertree Grove is a must when in Singapore. Make sure to stay for the evening musical light show. They are often changing the musical theme so I make sure to go every time I visit the city. You can also time it so you can see the laser light show in the bay either before or after.
,,Amazing structures,4.0,,"visiting supertree grove and coming to watch the light show is actually free. but if you want to go up and take amazing pictures of the singapore city and skyline, you have to pay a fee. get a bundled one with the gardens, it's actually cheaper. if you can get the timing right, you can get to watch the light show when your up the ocbc skyway."
,,Magnificent!!!,5.0,,"This is a must see attraction in the Gardens by the Bay. During the day you can go up for a treetop walk between a few of the towers. The views are fabulous. You have to go back at night for the truly amazing free, light and sound show."
,,SuperGlow :),5.0,,Word are not enough to document experience. Just Awesome...Music and Light show in the evening is amazing.
,,Do not miss the Light Show!,5.0,,"There are several light shows at night (7:45 and 8:45) that last about 15 minutes but are spectacular. Set to music, the Supertrees pulsate in a fantastic show. It is well worth seeing."
,,Super grove tree gardens by the bay,5.0,,"Super grove tree garden at gardens by the bay is a free to enter garden. But the sky walk is not free, it is SG$8 for adult and SG$5 for children 3-12 years. Amazing to watch the light show."
,,A world of magic,5.0,,"This place has to be on your must-do list when you visit Singapore. An inspiring and engaging experience for children and adults alike. Opportunities for capturing some spectacular photographs, particularly at night."
,,Amazing Light and Sound show,5.0,,"We heard a lot about this attraction so decided to check it out. WOW We went 2 nights in a row. It is totally full on. Lie on your back under the trees and watch and listen to this wonder. Different music each night. This is a ""Must visit"" attraction. Well done Singapore!!!!"
,,Stunning view and friendly staff,5.0,,"Portions were great but a little on the pricier side. Had to order a few sides to share even after ordering a main each (and I’m a girl) but if you’re willing to spend should be fine. Menu choices were slightly limited but decent enough. Went there in the day and night before but this is definitely a place to dine after sundown as the light shows at Gardens By The Bay gave a very magical dining experience, especially when waiting for your food. Recommended to make reservations before going especially for bigger groups."
,,don't miss this at night,5.0,,At night when it cools down this place is a lovely charming place for a walk after eating lots of food at the restaurants in marina bay. Great for kids to walk off dessert and for couples to stroll and hold hands. Lights are lovely. Not great for selfies at night.
,,Stunning!!!,5.0,,This is an unusual attraction - never seen anywhere else. Beautiful and spectacular!!! Should watch both in day and night light.
,,Super light show,5.0,,Located within Gardens by the bay these man made trees are interesting. I think there are about 16 in total in three areas. The central area is where you will find the skywalk between the trees and indeed a restaurant located in one of the trees. Both require an entrance fee. However it is at night when these trees come to life with a free light and music show lasting about 20mins. (2 shows per night). This is a must see. Take your camera/phone and record the display. It does get busy but most people sit/lay on the floor and just look skywards so crowding does not seem an issue.
,,Unique and Awesome,5.0,,"I admire the vision and creative mind of the designer. Fabulous structures; man-made, sure; covered with a myriad of various plants and then night brings an additional dimension with the Rhapsody light and sound show. 18 of these marvels, 12 in the Grove and 3 in each of the Golden and Silver Gardens. Not to be missed on a visit to Singapore."
,,Extraordinary!,5.0,,"Best to go in the evening for the light show. It's free, you just rock up and lie on the floor with everyone else, gaze up at the trees and watch the great light and sound show.

Get there early, but great views from wherever you lie. A must to do.

Visited in the day as well, still great.

No trip to Singapore complete without doing this."
,,More impressive at night,4.0,,These huge metal trees create an imposing display. Photographically they are interesting during the day but at night the trees light up and are more impressive
,,Amazing trees,4.0,,There are the best trees in the world. An unbeliever experiencia. Very nice and very lighting. You will enjoy it a lot.
,,Beautiful show of lights,5.0,,The lightning show is the highlight of this place. The trees come alive in the evening as you witness one of the Marvel's of Singapore
,,Must see,5.0,,You can see the trees from all over the city but the grove itself is absolutely a must see on any visit. Walkway amid the canopy is a special treat and the evening light show looks grand as well.
,,"Artificial, but in nature",4.0,,"Super Tree Grove is a very strange area. It is artificial, but becomes a part of nature. I heard its illumination is beautiful, but I couldn’t wait until night because of my flight schedule. I would like to come back again."
,,The Cloud Forest,5.0,,This was an excellent way of educating the people of the world about how we should look after the environment. As an Australian citizen it made me feel disappointed about what was happening in our country. Australia as a nation has a lot of work to do as we pollute the atmosphere daily with burning fossil fuels and our attempts at recycling are only token.I think our politicians should visit and be informed.
,,Like landing on another planet,5.0,,We visited the super tree grove during the day and for the light show. It’s is spectacular and worth the traffic queue to get there. We also paid to get on the sky walk which gave a fantastic view and different perspective. This is a highlight of a visit to Singapore
,,Beautiful day or night,5.0,,"Very well worth a visit, easy walking, well sign posted, day or night features. Night time laser show from the Marine Bay Sands and the Gardens themselves adds to the experience."
,,fabulous night walk,5.0,,"It is just stunning. i suggest to do it night time, ideally at sunset or during the light show to get the best of the experience."
,,Want to know what the future looks like?,5.0,,This is a testament to creativity and the hope build sustainable inspiring cities. The daily light show is kind of cute but totally worth it.
,,What A Place!,5.0,,I find that this place put on a great show for all the children! Also the best part was in December (my experience) because they had a whole winter wonderland with snow and a carnival. The whole thing all together is a very nice show
,,Part of Gardens By The Bay,4.0,,The Supertree Grove is a part of Gardens by the Bay so you might actually want to check the reviews of The Gardens to get a better idea. We didn't actually go to the gardens. But the view of the Supertrees from our balcony at Marina Bay Sands were beautiful especially at night during the light show. Worth viewing them. It feels like Lord of the Rings turned into reality.
,,Supertree Grove Spectacular,5.0,,"We visited the Supertree Grove when we went to the Bay of Gardens. During the day they are very unique. Then we visited them again that evening, wow how beautiful when they are all lit up in different colours and dancing to the beat of music. Next visit to Singapore will be putting this back on my list they are stunning."
,,Awesome,5.0,,These are just the most amazing things to see. The light show which is done twice per night simply took my breath away as it was so very good. We did the sky walk which was well worth the long queue and the cost (cheap). It does wobble in the wind so if you're afraid of heights it may not be for you. My husband did it even though he's afraid of heights but he walked across very fast as he didn't like the movement. I wish we hadn't left this until the last day as I would have done it numerous times.
,,stunning light show with music at night !,5.0,,It is so beautiful to watch the light show and listen to the music.You also get great views of the marina bay sands hotel and its a good photo op. I walked along the bridge which was also interesting. but if you scared of heights .. think twice !
,,Man-made marvel,5.0,,"This is one of the major attractions of the gardens by the bay. These are man-made tree like structures that add variety to an already brilliant concept. They are supposed to look like trees(or so I suppose) but they actually look like overgrown mushrooms. The OCBC skyway gives a closer look at these ""trees"" and a good view of the gardens below. There is even a restaurant on top of the tallest tree.
This is best known for the light show or the garden rhapsody. It's a visual treat without doubt."
,,Just loved the trees,5.0,,wow these trees are amazing they come alive to the beautiful music & light show we even queued to go up well worth the wait excellent views
,,A visual spectacle,5.0,,"A marvel of modern architecture and now an icon associated with Singapore, it is a delight to see these giant structures especially when they are lit in the evening. Simply wow! Do remember that there will be a long queue if you want to walk up the skybridge."
,,Wow! That was fun...,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore only for a short few days and hide in either shopping centers or some other indoor activites to shield yourself from the heat... then this is one activity I highly recommend to do at night.

Big group of us; mixture of adults and young kids thoroughly enjoyed the night.

There are 2 shows a night.. 7.45pm and 8.45pm..duration of 15mins

If you choose the 7.45pm then a nice 15mins stroll along the bay you can also check out Spectra Light and Water Show at 9pm

It is quite a beautiful experience as you wait for the night to get dark, the lights are more visible with Marina Bay Sands in the background.

Tip: do go there at least 30mins early if you want to get a good spot in the middle for the best vantage point.

Personally I love the show perhaps is because I love the music they put on with the lights. They are my genre... my era...

I'm guessing on a clear night with stars in the sky it must be quite amazing too.

Another tip: don't forget to bring your insect/mosquito repellent. A friend of mine recommend the brand 'Off'. Small little spray bottle easily fit into your handbag, pocket and bag pack.

If you are more prepare than us.. bring a small blanket to sit on or lie on..the ground can be a bit warm from the sun during the day. My niece and nephew absolutely loved it."
,,Simply Stunning,5.0,,"This is the one place i was so looking forward to seeing and it didn't disappoint, be aware when it rains you can't walk in and around the super trees ,so i was disappointed that i couldn't do that but still worth seeing 😍😍"
,,Supertree Grove is free,4.0,,"While it does cost to go into the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, the Gardens by the Bay park with the Supertree Grove is free. You can enjoy a walk around the gardens, eat at the food vendors and watch the Supertree Grove musical display (evenings) without buying a ticket.

The tickets are for the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome."
,,The light show is like a dream.,5.0,,The light show was the most beautiful and magical part of the Gardens by the bay. I was so overwhelmed that I was in tears by the end. Tip: Find a place to lie down and watch the show. It's like watching stars dancing.
,,Surreal. Otherworldly beauty,5.0,,Visit both day and night if your time permits. Recommend ordering a ‘Grab’ (like uber but cheaper) in the evenings when leaving as the taxi queue gets quite long
,,Mesmerizing Garden Rhapsody,5.0,,"I enjoy the Garden Rhapsody, a breathtaking choreography of lights and music at Supertree Grove. Every time I watch it, I am mesmerized. It is so nice to watch this performance at no charge after dinner. I wish I have a glass of wine on hand to savor the moment as well :-)"
,,worth our visit,4.0,,Tried to come here when it wasn’t too hot. It was really nice. We missed the light show in the evening because we needed to head home early but saw some glimpse and it was actually worth watching.
,,One of a kind,5.0,,This is a place of imagination. How LKY translated Singapore from a swamp to this is truely remarkable. The light show at nights is very impressive also
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"We visited these amazing structures by day and were taken aback by the concept but they really came to life at night. The light and sound show happens every evening but get here early! We arrived 30 minutes before and there were already people in all the seats and even spaces on the ground were tricky to find. Bring a blanket for the ground and some snacks/drinks, especially if bringing children as there is a bit of a wait before showtime.

Totally worth waiting for. The light sequence and music were spectacular and were totally mesmerising. I would recommend going up to the bridge after the light show to get a bird's eye view of the city and trees at night. You do have to pay extra for this and a tip is to get your tickets before the light show so you can get straight in line for bridge view after the show.

A must when in Singapore :)"
,,Excellent place to relax,5.0,,"The tree's are amazing and look great, but really kicks in after sunset when the lights get turn on with music. They have 2 shows every evening so enjoy and relax, few shops around for food and drinks."
,,Fantastic !!!,5.0,,"Basically, several tree-like vertical gardens with large canopies. The tallest one is 16 storieys in height. There is also an OCBC skyway connecting two of the supertrees.

Admission to Supertree Grove is free but you need tickets for the OCBC Skyway

Thousands of plants including orchids, ferns and tropical flowering climbers are planted on the Supertrees. 11 of the Supertrees have solar cells.

Apparently, this is part of the strategy of turning Singapore from a ‘Garden city’ to the ‘City in a garden'
Lots of greenery like elsewhere in Singapore . There are many sculptures to complement the trees.

Taxis are readily available. There is a McDonalds outlet (which also sells Durian Shake)"
,,Spend your time here,5.0,,Good place in the Gardens by The Bay area. The trees makes you feel in avatar world. Spend your time here at night to see the light show for free. The show start at 7.45 so don't miss it.
,,So Unique,5.0,,"Take your time to wander around this iconic Singapore landmark! The trees are still ""growing"" but you can already imagine what they'll look like years down the road. Spend the money to walk along the suspended bridge to get a closer look and great views of the surrounding area"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,This is a place to go and take the time to visit and relax in this magnific environment. All the plants and flowers are beautiful and the place is just magic.
,,One of the Attractions in Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"This is an absolute must to visit when you are in the Marina Bay Area. Make sure to go early as the place really gets packed with people. The best place to stay is somewhere in between the big central super tree (with the restaurant on-top) and the other super trees beside it. The light show starts promptly at dusk and will run for a few more times before it is done. Bring something to sit on because chances are, you will be sitting on the floor. Bring water too as the place is quite humid at that particular time of day."
,,Always a pleasure,5.0,,A visit is a must when in Singapore. Especially the colorful night shows are highly recommendable. The Flower Dome changes some of its displays based on different themes (this time the theme was Sunflowers).
,,Amazing light show - but beware of the boardwalk if you are scared of heights,5.0,,The super tree grove is an amazing site - and as the plants continue to grow over the framework I think it will get better and better. To see the trees is free or you can pay $8 for a ticket to walk along the raised walkway between 3 of the super trees. The views are great and it is interesting to get up so close but the walkway is quite narrow in parts and I ended up having to turn back - so if you are nervous with heights then I would not recommend this - however you get a great view from below and the light and sound show is free and it is best to watch that from the ground so no need to go up.
,,Epitomises the beauty of Singapore,5.0,,"This is what makes Singapore and the highlight of a visit. The park is great to see at any time of the day but it is essential to visit at night during the music and light show. The trees are stunning, and the whole area is great to walk around."
,,Lunch in the SuperTree,5.0,,"Lovely experience, superb menu and bar and what sensational views with a pleasant ambiance. The rooftop bar is a breathtaking spot for a Singapore Sling."
,,Highly recommended,4.0,,"It is very nice for a stroll or even a jog - yes it’s warm and humid, but if you are prepared it’s just fine!"
,,love the musical show,5.0,,We attended the musical show during our singapore visit. Simply breathtaking ! loved the athmosphere
,,Spectaculiar.........,5.0,,This is a highlight. Great to visit by night or day. We visited on the full moon festival and the light show was amazing. Recommend to take an umbrella so you can still enjoy the attractions in inclement weather.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Amazing time around the Gardens, so much to see & do & the trees are amazing. A great day out, just lovely."
,,Beautiful garden,4.0,,beautiful place especially at nite. amazingly beautiful. You may need more than 1 hour to be here. a lot of good spots for pic .
,,Green ideas,5.0,,The world needs to come here to understand how Singaporeans have created a green tree out of cement n concrete. Amazing piece of work and evenings they become so colorful.
,,Some of the best views of Singapore,5.0,,"Admission free (other than OSBC Skyway, Flower Dome and Cloud Forest) and a must visit when in Singapore. One of the most beautiful places in the city. Reach it by alighting at the Bayfront MRT station, then follow the sings to Gardens by the Bay, which bring you outside the Sands hotel and to an elevator + footbridge."
,,This is mind-blowing!,5.0,,Each night at 7.45 and 8.45 there is a 15 minute sound and light show from the supertrees. I have yet to see photos or video that do it justice - the sound is incredible and the light show is utterly mind-blowing. I could watch it every day and never get bored. Do not miss this!
,,A must see light show,5.0,,"If you are in Sinagpore after dark you need to see the Supertree light show, it's spectacular, especially with Marina Bay Sands in the background."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Two shows in the evening 7.45 & 8.45 and it’s totally free. Well worth visiting, you can watch the light and music show from right under the “super trees”"
,,Free Show,5.0,,"Another must see, free light show twice a night, lots of places to eat and drink while you watch the show"
,,Super Pleased Grove,5.0,,Cheaper to buy tickets at the Travel Hub online.. because of the imposter Travel Hub that can't sell you the bundle. Night show was neat and free.
,,Pretty,5.0,,"We wandered around here after we’d visited the gardens by the bay, it was very pretty. You can go up high and walk on pathways between the trees for some great views"
,,Fantastic futuristic place,5.0,,Took the MTR to Bayfront and followed the signs to Supertree Grove to watch the light show at 7.45pm. It is free. It was amazing and the set up is beautiful. A must do in Singapore.
,,First Night in Singapore,5.0,,I miss the place I saw on the first night in Singapore. The tree tree that I see lying down is so pretty.
,,Amazing,5.0,,The best part of the gardens by the bay and it's free. These avatar style trees look amazing both in the day and at night when lit up. Dont miss the evening music and light show as it is pretty amazing
,,Such an amazing place to hangout,4.0,,"Best for couples and singles alike, it is a great meet up or hangout place. It makes you realise how the world is changing"
,,Must not miss the light show here!,5.0,,"Any visit to the Gardens by The Bay would be incomplete without checking out the Supertree Grove. You should also stay for the evening musical light show, I think at 7.45pm and 8.45pm. I arrived at the Grove around 6.50pm and already, there were crowds of people waiting at the foot of the supertrees. I would suggest however that the better vantage point is actually not at the foot of the trees but find a spot in the gardens overlooking the Grove. That way, you get to see the show without having to get a crick in your neck from looking upwards for the many minutes the show lasts for. If you are coming from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, there is also a platform there from which you can watch the whole Supertree Grove light show from afar. You need to stake out a good spot very early though - if you are late, there will be lots of people in front, making it nigh impossible to see anything much."
,,Fairyland,4.0,,"Arriving at this location is like stepping into a movie scene. The tree structures which are so awesome in the daylight, transform into something you dont want to take your eyes off when they are lit up after sunset.The elevated walkway has the most beautiful views. The light show in the evening is a must and just takes you off your feet."
,,Very cool experience,4.0,,Beautiful and unique elevated walk way. Great views of the surrounding area. Felt like a Dr. Seuss book.
,,Catch the light show at night!,5.0,,Magnificent. They're just as cool up close as they are from afar. Make sure to catch at least one light show at night - it's free and absolutely breathtaking!
,,A mix of nature and technology,4.0,,"The Supertree Grove is an amazing place to visit.

These trees are a mix of nature and technology. The technology copies the natural way that trees grow. The trees range in height from 25 to 50 metres tall.

The Supertree Grove is located within the Gardens by Bay complex.

You can go on to the OCBC skyway - which is an elevated walkway that gives you a great view of the gardens and the surrounding area.

At night there is a light and music show which is stunning to see and hear. The colours of the trees change with the music. It is a sight to behold - and definitely a spectacle to see. There are two shows - one at 7.45 pm and the next one at 8.45 pm."
,,Go for the nighttime show,5.0,,There will be so many people on the weekends but the nighttime show is so worth it. Makes sure that you are in the grove for the show.
,,Great light show,5.0,,Definitely go for the evening light show and lie on the ground under the trees to watch. You can't help but dance and clap along towards the end.
,,Amazing place,5.0,,These flower structures are amazing in daylight and completely different again when lit up at night. Definitely worth a visit at both ends of the day. Fab free light show in the evenings too.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,Stunning! The engineering is amazing! the plant life beautiful. Its even better in the dark when it all lights up! Loads of people wait there until the lights come on.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"This is certainly worth visiting. The views from the overhead walkways are great, don't go up if you are scared of heights :-("
,,"A public area, where the show is held",4.0,,"This is a public area outside the main gardens where you have to pay. It is also where the nightly show is held.

They're impressive to look at and definitely give a relaxed, pleasant feeling to watch, especially as they mix up the music at different times. Aside from the show, these are impressive to look at, but not incredible of their own.

For the show, get there early for a good spot, and then be aware there is a crowd crush leaving so either leave early or better, leave late.

You can pay to go up to a walk along a few of them, but it doesn't offer a greatly different perspective from the rest of the garden."
,,You must experience this to believe it. Just GO!,5.0,,You must experience this to believe it. We were there a few months ago and had to go again. Just Go and you will understand
,,WOW,5.0,,"We have been here before but never get tired of this most fantastic place. Words cannot describe this, it is something you must experience for yourself."
,,Uniquely Singaporean,5.0,,There is little I can say except that this location is a 'must-see'. One of the hidden gems of this city. Highly recommended.
,,well done,4.0,,The manufacturing was very well done indeed and the plants that were placed on them very well thought out and executed
,,Cool,5.0,,This is a really cool exhibit as an entry and exit it makes a statement and shows the depth of Singapore's art culture
,,A must do on your trip,5.0,,We went here at night for the nightly lights show. It was stunning and beautiful and peaceful and lovely. It was really busy. There are now quite a few places you can eat next to it which was an improvement on last time i went.
,,Great concept,5.0,,"Nice to learn how different types of plants can be blended to form a huge tree like shape, which can be the lungs of a large city."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Awesome surreal place to visit these trees seem very Jurassic but obviously man made with a fabulous restaurant at the top and very reasonable.
,,A Nice Walk,3.0,,"You access this via an elevator, and then walk across to the other side, it is good to note that in some areas the path is wide enough for several people to walk side by side, but in other areas it is single file only."
,,Long ques,4.0,,Very popular sight and the ques were long to get to the top when we went! It was worth the wait! Some breath taking views from up there!
,,Stunning,5.0,,It's hard to explain to folk back home how impressive these Supertrees are. All but one (which has a restaurant at the top of it) are vents of fresh recycled air from the subterranean power plant and are beautifully lit up at night plus are covered in plants. There is a walkway 22m high between two of them ($S 8 for to do it)
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,If you are in Singapore and have time then I think it’s worth coming down to see the place and make your way to the rooftop bar as well.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,What an innovative display - stunning in itself but at just $8 to go up to the skyway was well worth it. Fantastic views and great photo opportunities.
,,Light Show,5.0,,Another must see in Singapore. The light show after dark was terrific. The Super Trees lit up with a light show set to music. Very impressive. They were also very imposing during the day
,,"OK, worth a visit",3.0,,"Ok to visit, nice plants and a great view of the Sands hotel and garden, but avoid during 11am and 2pm to hot."
,,Really cool,5.0,,"Loved this garden. The super trees were very impressive, and the walk way gives a cool rainforest tree top view."
,,Great light show,5.0,,"The light and sound show real;ly is worth seeing, free attraction, lots of people but still plenty of room to enjoy the show!"
,,Magical,5.0,,the show at 7:45pm and 8:45pm is just magical. one of the highlights in my trip to Singapore. don't miss it at all.
,,Awesome!,5.0,,This is a MUST DO in Singapore. The huge trees are lit up to music and produce a wonderful light and sound show at 8pm each evening. Fabulous!

,,I just love this garden,5.0,,"I loved it all ,the garden ,the layout ,the tree walk even the bar on top a good place for a drink with a view . and being near Christmas the entertainment through the gardens was great. The popup food vans what could i say but yumm"
,,Stunning,5.0,,Stunning display of lights. It's lovely to just walk around at any time of day or night and enjoy the views. It's a very child friendly area.
,,You have to go!,5.0,,Make sure you give yourself enough time to explore this amazing place. The tree walk closes at 8pm so be sure to get there before that! The night light show is a must and try to visit when the street food market is open where you can sample a huge variety of well cooked delights from edible balloons to the traditional noodle dishes
,,Night is when these trees are magical!,5.0,,Night is when these trees are magical. Saw the trees by day and night. It's night when they become magical. The colours are beautiful with the stars and night sky. A must in Singapore. Huge! Get lost in a fantasy world.
,,Super!,4.0,,"濱海灣花園擁有將近 150 萬株植物。其中擎天樹測底貫徹了垂直綠化的概念，一共超過 15.8 萬棵植物生長在超過25-50公尺的18 棵鋼樹上。 One of my favorite places in SG, a absolutely must-go for everyone who is visiting the country.The trees can be seen great from a distance, but more amazing for walking underneath them at night."
,,Fabulous and free lightshow/music!,5.0,,"We'd enjoyed our time at the wonderful Gardens by The Bay, including satays and a beer before the lightshow. We went to the 7.45pm session and were amazed by the ""Garden Rhapsody"". The night we were there the music was waltz music and the lights were lovely. You really felt like waltzing! A fabulous free attraction in Singapore."
,,great how they set up,5.0,,This is a very nice place to visit for a walk and visit. How they set up and how clean it is. This is a example for many other cities.

,,great how they set up,5.0,,This is a very nice place to visit for a walk and visit. How they set up and how clean it is. This is a example for many other cities.
,,Solo visitor,5.0,,A must see by day and night. It’s free to enter the gardens but then you need to buy tickets to go into the different attractions.
,,Amazing at night,5.0,,I think this is a must see in Singapore. Man made huge trees in the middle of a garden that's amazing in itself to walk around. Just beautiful. Instagrammers will be drooling over all the like they'll get.
,,a great light show at night.,4.0,,"supertree is an apt name for these impressive looking giants.in the daylight they look spectacular but at night is when they are at there best.they are lit up at night and look awesome,changing colour as they stand there towering above you.every night they do a light show to music,which is very impressive."
,,WOW!!!!! - Cannot rate this highly enough,5.0,,"The most amazing man-made experience I have ever seen. The ""absolutely must do thing"" in Singapore. Looks fabulous on the internet, and is even more amazing when you see it with your own eyes."
,,Stunning,5.0,,For me this was the highlight of Singapore. It is truly an amazing beautiful majestic place to visit. The music and light show is breath taking.
,,Chal Chaiyya Chaiyya,5.0,,The music show is amazing. There is no ticket for this and anyone can view it for free. Enjoy this in the evenings!
,,Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"This is a must see attraction and the supertree grove is free unless you want to do the skywalk or visit the two domes which are situated very close by, this is also worth a visit at night as there are two light shows with music which lasts for about 15 mins and is well worth watching and is again a free show"
,,must see,4.0,,"An icon in Singapore, don't leave without a selfie. Try to avoid going in midday because it can get very warm."
,,Come at Night,5.0,,"We did not go into any other locations in the Gardens but made a trip to watch the light show. Go slightly early (shows are at 7:45 and 8:45PM) and park your self underneath one of the supertrees. When it's time, lie down and watch the light show timed to the music.

The best 15 minutes we spent in Singapore. And it's FREE. Nothing much is in Singapore."
,,Excellent light show (music not so good),4.0,,The trees are certainly unique. Must see at night where they are at their best! Light show is very good but I wont be downloading the musical soundtrack! Take an ipod and select your own music!
,,Supertree Grove,5.0,,"Go up in the elevator to the top of these stunning ""trees"" and walk around the paths suspended around and between these man made trees. The view is spectacular from this height. At night the trees are illuminated and give a magical air to them. Be early for the night time viewing as these are extremely popula"
,,Looks like a Sci-fi Movie,5.0,,"These ""Supertrees"" and the skywalk look amazing at nigh-time as they glow blue. They look so futuristic and other-worldy. It really is very beautiful."
,,Super Cool!,5.0,,"You should do this in both the day and night times! It's a beautiful area with interesting plants. Lines tend to form, so arrive early."
,,Fun,5.0,,"Enjoy the skyline especially with the yellow yolk (sunset) as the backdrop. To sweeten the deal, it is free!"
,,Just AMAZING!!,5.0,,"I absolutely loved this. The metal trees are truly amazing to see and experience. Very enjoyable, and for the cost of FREE, absolutely worth it all!"
,,Stunning park area,4.0,,This is a lovely area in Singapore - I could only visit during the day (it was very hot at midday) I can imagine it being lovely early in the morning but especially neat at night with the lights.
,,Amazing!!!!,5.0,,"This is a must do!!! Amazing light and sound show twice a night at 8pm and 9pm i think. Well worth it, a definite highlight of our trip."
,,skywalk and musical,5.0,,Well this was a delight and a must if you are in Singapore. All of Gardens by the bay was lovely but staying for the 9pm show of music and lights on the Supertrees was the highlight. Be prepared to be dazzled. We heard a classical music arrangement with the changing sequence of lights and colours. It takes about 15 minutes. We took the skywalk first and enjoyed the view of Singapore from the height. The elevator ride up was quick and the whole ambiance amazing.
,,Make sure to visit at after sunset,5.0,,There are maintenance days once a month. check the website and come on another day. Make sure to stay for the light show. The bar at the top of the tallest tree is a great place to watch the sunset but you can't see the light show from up there so make sure you're back on the ground in time.
,,2018 trip,5.0,,Be sure to visit during the evenings for the lights show at 8 and 9. The lights on the trees change colors in sync with the music.
,,What a amazing garden light show,5.0,,Definitely recommend if you go to Singapore to go watch the garden light show. One of the reasons I went to Singapore is to go watch the garden light show. And I can say it was amazing to see. The Garden light show does get very busy my recommendation is get their lease one hour before the garden light show starts. You can go up high up in the trees as well but there is a charge for that there is quite a few times a long queue to go up hire him to the trees. It is a great thing for families or couples or single people and everybody.
,,"Loved this, great experience",5.0,,Free Entry to Gardens by the Bay but purchased tickets to go up on the Supertree Grove. Amazing to be up so high and enjoy the views
,,loved it!,5.0,,second time in Singapore but first time to see the Supertree Grove and we loved it! we were amazed how Singapore was able to come up with this kind of idea :-)
,,fabulous,5.0,,"many wow's for this place. clean and enjoyable. The light show in the evening was great, music added is a nice touch"
,,Twice was not enough,5.0,,We visited the super trees twice in a 3 week period. Unfortunately we could not go on the skywalk. We enjoyed the trees and the ecology that they bring into the City. The first time we were not aware of the Light shows that were running so we missed the sight and sound celebration of the season. Having said that our tour guide made sure that we did get to the light show and it was astounding. See the Grove from the Singapore Flyer at night!
,,Beautiful show at night,4.0,,"Try to come to their night lightshow at around 7.45 pm and you won't be disappointed. It is beautiful. But be prepared to deal with loads people leaving the place at the same time. Even though traffic of people is properly organized by staff, but it could be a bit daunting."
,,Magical show & free!,5.0,,Come and sit under the Super trees at 7.45 or 8.45 pm every night for a truly magical experience of lights & music. Admission for the show is free. You only need to buy tickets if you want to walk across the link bridge between 2 super trees. The view of the night skyline from the bridge is quite lovely.
,,Unforgettable,5.0,,"Dropped by right around sunset; very long lines, but made it from the ticket booth to the top of the grove in less than an hour. While waiting we were able to enjoy one of the many light and music shows that takes place nightly. Truly the other-worldly experience that you can't miss if you're visiting Singapore for the first time."
,,Fabulous.,5.0,,Unique! Stunning! Great by day but the place really comes to life at night when the trees are lit with an amazing light show to music.
,,The marvels of human ingenuity,5.0,,"In a highly urbanized area like Singapore, finding trees and plants everywhere seems to be a rebellious streak---but they're there, and more. Supertree Grove combines both human ingenuity in the field of architecture and a sensitivity to the natural world. Truly wonderful."
,,SuperTree Love,5.0,,"I like going here aside from the fact that it is a very cool structure, it plays music and lights at night which it really turns magical. Really good place to hang out with friends and show tourist friends around."
,,awesome,5.0,,"good during day time, able to oversee the view of singapore. yet to try out night with the lightings."
,,Man-made forrest,5.0,,"As usual the attractions in Singapore are quite unique! I really wonder how they got the idea of having artificial 18 supertrees covered by more than 200 species of plants inside a garden area, yet they managed to make it in style and perfection. These trees are the place for a wonderful music and light show performed many times every night, and what's more, the show is for free! Really impressive place to visit."
,,Lovely!,5.0,,"This was my favorite attraction at Gardens by the Bay! I loved the Garden Rhapsody show at night, and it's amazing that you can watch it every night twice!"
,,Beautiful but not for me,5.0,,"It is a beautiful Man made Grove. It looks so beautiful at night and it so lovely. However, me being Acrophobic, could not enjoy it that much. It was a bit scary for me. However, I would definitely recommend it to all."
,,Better than expected- stay for the Sound and Light show..,4.0,,"Whilst the trees are quite good by day, it is in the evening that they come into their own. We took the walk up between two of the trees. We went about 6:30 and were there at the beginning of sunset; ideally we should have gone at 7:15. There was not too much of a queue and the view at night was lovely. We are not really city fans but enjoyed the nightscape. We hadn’t realised there was a Sound and Light show and were just about to head off when it started. It was amazing- probably the best thing we did in Singapore.
We hadn’t expected much from the trees but they ended up in our number one slot!!"
,,Don'd miss the light show in the evening!,5.0,,I almost missed this as I started heading back and then had to rush back to see the show! This is definitely worth seeing...everyone was lying on the ground and admiring the light and music show synchronised between the trees. Just checking timings as another came on around 9pm as I was leaving. The tress themselves are also lit up with coloured lights at night so it is a good idea to go around sunset so you can see them during daylight and when dark.
,,Impressive attraction,4.0,,The supertree grove near Gardens by the Bay is truly impressive and a sight to behold. The light and sound show is also very nice. A must visit attraction in Singapore.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The grove show at the night time is amazing. With the light, anthem and stars in the sky. It made me a wonderful night."
,,Must see - day or night,5.0,,"These man-made trees are an absolutely essential stop on any trip to Singapore. They tower over the Gardens By The Bay and afford great views over the gardens, towards central Singapore and up at the Marina Bay Sands from the OCBC Skyway (which is a walkway between the main trees in central Supertree Grove, accessible by lift). Entrance to the Skyway is reasonable at $8 SGD and, although you're ostensibly limited to 15 minutes at the top, I don't know how vigorously this in enforced and you only really need 10 minutes or so to get all the views and snaps you need. If you don't care for heights or are on a really strict budget, the trees themselves are still well worth a look up close from ground level - a wonderful combination of natural beauty and human innovation."
,,Like a fairy tale,4.0,,"The supertree grove look like in a fairy tale, it's impressive and looks lovely. Take your time to walk around (you won't need to pay an admission except when you can to walk on the canopy). It's easy to go there by bus."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"This was a truly amazing sight, the scale of these trees cannot be appreciated from the photos. What makes it even more amazing is being under a canopy of lights during the light and sound show. We were treated to a night of opera under a clear and peaceful night sky."
,,Light show,5.0,,"Supertree Grove is a must, just to see the light show that they have there each evening. The show starts at 7:45 pm and last only 15 minutes. The light show is accompanied by music. You can reach this by going through the Marina Bay Sands hotel which has a walkway to the Garden by the Bays and the Supertree Grove. They are beautiful to look at even in the day time."
,,Unique and beautiful.,4.0,,"Nice place. Unique build. Very nice evening. Each evening a nice experience of Visual vision. Nice walking area, very green and beautiful."
,,Singapore!!,5.0,,A must place to visit! If you can do it Singapore can do it better!! Everything in Singapore met our expectations and some. Queues were a bit of a bother but that is life.
,,Steel trees,4.0,,"I have seen these in brochures, but actually seeing up close is so much better your really appreciate design and structure."
,,Very grand trees,4.0,,"Very grand when you walk under these trees. There is crowded when I visit on a hot sunny day, and even more crowded at the free music light show at 7:45pm"
,,Gardens by the Bay at night.,5.0,,"Two light shows every night..absolutely magical.you become mesmerized by the coloured lights changing to the rhythm of the music....and it's free. After the light show go up the lift of the biggest tree, pay a cover charge of $20 which covers the cost of a free alcoholic drink. You now have one of the best views in Singapore!"
,,...and it's free!,5.0,,It is the closest experience to being in an alien forest. The 7:45 PM sound-and-light show is also not to be meissed.
,,Singapore's prime attraction,5.0,,These trees are absolutely incredible. They were amazing in the daytime and come alive with a light show at night. Definitely the top thing to see in all of Singapore.
,,It's worth paying extra for the view at the top of the Supertrees,5.0,,"There is a walkway at the top of the Supertrees and a view from the bar inside the top of one of them. There are extra charges to go up for the view, and queues to get through if you buy tickets in person on the day. However, in our view it was worth the wait and the price."
,,trip highlight-awesome evening,5.0,,The concert performed by the trees at night is amazing.A free classical music wonder but you lie amongst the trees and watch them light up spectacularly in a light show.
,,Go at sunset,4.0,,very unique man made garden. well lit at night. The sun shines at the orchard and made perfect macro on the flowers.
,,Awesome trip to Garden by Bay,5.0,,Really enjoyed the walking around SuperTree grove which is around garden by bay . Took lots of pictures .Its a must do in Singapore!!
,,best time to see : At night,5.0,,"At night the place is very well lit up and it is a lovely sight to see, must see if you are visiting singapore for a short time."
,,Good views,4.0,,The supertrees are a great design. We went mid afternoon on a weekday and there were no queues. You got good views across the garden and parts of Singapore. They are well prepared for the night time viewing with lines for all the people. At night you are limited to a 15minute slot to be up on the bridge.
,,Light show is amazing!,5.0,,"The light show is amazing! My 2 year old loved it as did my husband. It was our Singapore highlight.

Other reviews said to get there early but 15 mins before hand and there was still spots on the grass to sit.

All for free too!

We also went to the free water play area too!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,We see these in daylight but in the evening they are something else as there is two shows & they light up to the music. We have sat under them during the shows but found it is better to find a place further back as you see so much more to fully appreciate them - we have been on several occassions
,,Visit it during the evenings!,5.0,,"The best experience is garden rhapsody @19:45, but make sure to be there early to get possibility to view the event from skytrail (elevated walking between the trees). There's only 70 persons allowed at a (limited) time and it's not easy to get there during the event :)"
,,Amazing to watch,5.0,,Had a little wander around enjoying the Christmas lights everywhere and found a spot to sit with a beer under the trees. The Christmas music and light combination was perfect - you have to check this out!!
,,Perfectly combined line and waltz show,5.0,,"For a free attraction you don’t often expect much however this is honestly the best ever light and music show I’ve ever seen, it was truest remarkable.

From what I understand the music and theme changes periodically and when we went the lights were dancing to classic waltz music.

The trees without the lights are impressive but come to life at nighttime for the show.

The synergy was beautiful and breathtaking."
,,Spectacular architecture,5.0,,These Supertree structures are visible for miles around Singapore and are basically exhaust funnels for the area that are I suppose dual purpose - brilliant
,,Lovely Place to Visit in Night,4.0,,You will not regret visiting this place if you can spend some time during the Musical show at night. It will be really good if you can get the ticket to walk on that elevated path.
,,Best light and sound show ever !!!,5.0,,"A must see at the evening light and sound show, still worth a trip in the daytime but definitely a must at night."
,,Supertree Grove at Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"Gardens by the Bay has many attractions and one of my favorites is the Supertree Grove. The Grove is made up of strange looking structures that resemble trees, there are a number of these trees hence the name Grove. If one is not bothered by heights there is an elevated walk called the skyway which is 22 metres above the ground and gives a great view of the surrounding gardens. The Skywalk between the trees is 128 metres long and is a great place to take lots of photographs. While the Supertree Grove is very impressive during the day it is the night time that this place really becomes the centre piece of the gardens. At 8:45pm and again at 9:45pm each night there is a light show and it lasts for 15 minutes. This is something not to be missed it is a must see and hear as the light show has great musical accompaniment by the world's greatest opera singers."
,,Must see,5.0,,one of the expirences that you will take back for the trip and remember for ever it is that beautiful
,,Do not miss this either,5.0,,This is my third visit with three different people and all as well as me were amazed that this is all man made.
,,Must SEE,5.0,,This is a must see at dusk it is amazing wonderful a photographers dream a must see place. I did a week in Delhi and a week in Singapore.
,,Wow. Relaxing evening.,5.0,,"I visited the super grove in the afternoon after going to the dome etc. go to satay street and get some dinner and sit and watch the light shows after sunset. That’s the best time. It is a safe and clean place. There are some places to sit and see the show for free, you just have to walk around until you find a nice spot. This is a Singapore must see."
,,Best at night,5.0,,The super grove at night is spectacular. There are two lights to music shows and should not be missed where the super tress light up to music. each show lasts for about 15 minutes. Get there early for a good spot
,,Stunning,4.0,,We went here at night and so pleased we did. There is a lot to look at at night in ‘The Gardens by the Bay’ area. I would highly recommend it. We arrived just before dusk so got to have a look at the area before it got dark as well as after dark. There are a wide range of ages and groups of people there. Everyone just taking in the stunning lights and relaxing and enjoying. We felt very safe. It’s also free which is always an added bonus. Though if you are wanting to take the walk to the top of one and around the skyway that is an additional cost. Some wonderful photos to be taken here. If you are unsure about whether to go I would strongly suggest you make the time to do it.
,,Well worth the $8 charge for the views.,5.0,,Great views of the gardens from a different perspective. Spaces are limited per viewing so not overcrowed. May be a line if you go at night but worth the wait.
,,unique,5.0,,Uniquely beautiful almost alien looking fun for the entire family make sure your shoes are comfortable
,,Are friends electric?,5.0,,"An amazing sight by day, even better at night. The electric light show is truly awesome......and free!"
,,Nice place,4.0,,It's a great thing to watch..take tickets of night time so u ll fill like a Avatar movie..all purple n green colours are fabulous..loved it ..list thing to visit with nominal fees
,,Best garden is the world,5.0,,"Best garden in the world with nice city view of Singapore. There are also restaurants, cafes and bistros in the garden. You can spend hours here and feel great."
,,Stunning...and free,4.0,,"Bring a towel to sit on, very very few sitting places and so will need to sit on the concrete path. Perhaps look around the area during the day to orientate. And then just enjoy"
,,OMG OMG OMG,5.0,,"If heaven was an earthly place, this would be it. I will never forget my immense joy at having experienced the sheer beauty not only by myself but all those around me."
,,"A great free attraction, a must see",5.0,,"Situated in the centre of the Marina Bay Gardens, the Supertree Grove is free to walk around, and there is no entry free needed to get into the park. The trees are particularly beautiful and awe inspiring at night when they are all lit up, with ample amounts of seating beneath to sit and stare.

For around £8 more you can ascend into the tops of the trees and walk around the aerial walkway to get an inspiring view of the entire park and Marina Bay area.

Shops and eateries are all on site too, as is the plant dome, which is also for a fee.

A beautiful addition to any visit. A must see."
,,Wonderful fairylike experience,5.0,,I felt like a fairy in a giant tree. The skywalk was fantastic and the views are amazing. Viewed the trees at the same time as a family with 5 children and the children were awestruck. Loved this - one of my Singapore highlights.
,,Amazing Light Show.,5.0,,Go in the evening. The light show is super. (Bigger version than the Christmas tree in Prague display at Christmas). Best spot is not on the overhead walk ways but on the ground to the right of the large tree in the middle.
,,Excellent and free!,4.0,,"It's free to enter and walk around this area and they have a light and music show twice every evening. I preferred the fountains in the bay, but this was still worth a visit. It does get crowded though."
,,Fantastic lit up at night,5.0,,"A must see if you are in Singapore, go at night when the light show I see on and go up the skyway. You get a great view of Singapore."
,,Superb supertrees,5.0,,"Undoubtedly, one the highlights of my tree to Singapore was the supertrees. What I have told people, and I hope I manage to convey in this review is that Singapore has done something that no city in the world has. In addition to beautiful colonial architecture, Singapore has mixed funky, amazing and modern architecture with luscious, colourful and stunning nature, and the supertrees are a clear example of that.

If you see a structure of iron, you wouldn't be much surprised. Similarly, seeing some climbing plants and flowers would not impress you too much. Now, mix them both, add laser lights, amazing music and you view one of the most extraordinary attractions in the word. It is just so cool, unique that you will see kids, adults and elderly people alike, i.e., lost for words. Head to the trees early if you want to get tickets to Skyway and walk through the trees during the show in the evening. Also, make sure you see the show from different positions, from the top, then just underneath the trees and a little further down. You can then get amazing shots and as there is like a 30 minutes interval between the shows that allows you to walk around and get the different shots.

In the end, if visiting Singapore, make sure you see the light and music show. Just try to arrive on time to organise yourself and make the most of an hour of magic."
,,Super Dancing Light,4.0,,"AT 7:45pm every night, the musicial light up will be an attraction of the garden. It is a 15-minutes presentation. Some just lie on the ground to view the lightings, Some sitting at the boardwalk near the dragon-lake area."
,,Excellent views of the city the Singapore flyer,5.0,,Really good views of the city skyline marina sands hotel and the flyer. 8 dollars to get up. Just be careful sometimes closed when it rains or any adverse weather condition (well for Singapore.....)
,,Go an hour before sunset & stay til the lights come on!,5.0,,"These man made trees are pretty in sunlight but they're spectacular at night when they turn on the lights!
The talent & execution that went into making them almost makes you think they're ancient trees from a time long past!

I went here with my wife on our honeymoon in April 2017.
Make sure to check out the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome next door!"
,,wonderful,5.0,,A truly exhilarating experience The trees are beautiful in daylight but at night with the amazing sound and light show a visit is a magical experience
,,"Impressive by day, spectacular by night",5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is impressive during the daylight hours and the aerial walkway, OCBC Skyway, is worth the few dollars to get up among the towers to see the gardens from a different point of view. There was no line for tickets or the lift at 3pm on a Thursday. You can only spend about 15 minutes on the walkway and there are a couple of points where there is a large gap between the wires that are best for photos.

We were very tired and almost didn't go back for the music and light show, but are so very glad we made the effort because it was the highlight of our visit to Singapore and would recommend it over the Marina Bay light show. Two shows daily at 7.45pm and 8.45pm mean you can enjoy it more than once."
,,Lay in the ground and be mesmerised,5.0,,"The evening light show is a must, it's free and timed after the light show at Marina Bay so if you wish you can do both. Lay on the bench, or lay on the ground (ground sheet optional) and immerse yourself in classical music, or opera and the lights with the night sky above."
,,vertical wonder,5.0,,"structured and curated, these trees are mans tribute to nature! Make sure that you are spending time enough to take in the sound and light show after sundown."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Visited with my elderly Mother at dusk and we loved the light show. We hired a wheelchair from the information counter near McDonalds for $2.00. You need to leave your Passport as security. This was very convenient as we went up to the first level and were able to watch the show from a great spot.
,,A great attraction in Singapore,4.0,,"The view for the Supertree is different from day and night, it is located in the centre of Garden by the Bay. It is great to spend some time with your family outdoor. There are many cafe and restaurants in the area, you can spend a whole day there."
,,Lights and Music in trees.,5.0,,"Excellent show with superb music accompaniment. Only downside is the number of people; solution, arrive early to avoid disappointment!"
,,Awe Inspiring!,5.0,,This is an amazing experience that I would highly recommend. Absolutely stunning. Just go and chill out and make sure your phone is charged to record this light show. Never seen anything so beautiful in my life!
,,light and sound,5.0,,this was an awesome light and sound experivnce ....its different during the day and amazing at the night ..u can alos walk up the trip to visit the resturant on the top and enjpy the lights....or just lie down on the ground below and enjoy
,,Spectacular day and night at the Supertrees,5.0,,Great views from the top. Light show is worth experiencing. Just unusual and well worth a couple of visits.
,,My favourite place in Singapore,5.0,,"I loved Singapore. We loved Singapore and this place had tough competition but the ""tress"" are amazing and walking between them is simply stunning, Excellent views too."
,,Visit it during the night,5.0,,"I prefer it during the night. Colors are amazing, you have feeling like you are on the other planet (like Avatar movie)"
,,Amazing views of Singapore,5.0,,Make sure you include the Supertree Grove in your visit to Gardens by the Bay. The views are amazing.
,,Must see...,5.0,,"This was on our top of things to see when we were away and so glad we did. I have never seen anything like this. They are just as spectacular in the day as they are at night at the light show so it is well worth you going back at night. They have got great photo vantage points around the park and our photos turned out really nice.There is a skywalk that you can do that connects from one tree to another, It would be nice if that was free as it gets expensive when your in a family, but that is only a tiny tiny piece of the place. Can not recommend this place enough.. Certainly is a must see when you are visiting Singapore."
,,AN UNIQUE IDEA OF KEEPING THE ENVIRONMENT COOL,5.0,,"We were just amazed at the concept, construction, vertical garden and maintenance of the Supertrees. The trunk and branches of Supertrees are made of special material to absorb heat from the lower level of the garden and dissipate the same at a very high level."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Fantastic to walk around. Amazing evening show with music and lights. It's a ""must do"" in Singapore."
,,Catch the Light Show,4.0,,Fascinating attraction. Free to wander around. Best to go later in the day and then hang around for the light show at 7.45pm and again an hour later.
,,Very funky,5.0,,Went in the evening and saw the light show with music. It was very relaxing. The super trees are pretty cool! and it's free to wander through.Get there in advance to get a seat. They do 2 shows in the evening.
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"Fantastic lights and when we were there it was lit up really beautiful for nice photos. Last time I brought my friends to visit it was only white and red because of August and National Day, which was still nice. But it's nicer with all the colour! It's a really good experience to go on the OCBC skywalk :)"
,,recommended!,5.0,,a very cool man made architecture to blend in with nature. I have seen it in the action movie on the flight to Singapore but it is totally different atmosphere!
,,"Amazing, Absolutely gorgeous",5.0,,Part of the Gardens by the Bay. There is an amazing evening light show with music that is NOT to be missed. Spectacular. I loved it
,,Supertrees,5.0,,"Outstanding light show, seen by just lying on the lawned areas. For all ages, and costs nothing. A must do in Singapore"
,,Stunning sculptures,5.0,,These are super stunning gardens with access to the great glasshouses and the free night light show. These are super sized stunners
,,I loved this place.,5.0,,"I couldn't stop taking pictures. Absolutely magical. A Singapore ""must."" Time your visit to see one of the evening light shows!"
,,Very nice,4.0,,We saw the Rhapsody show at this place. It was a 15 minutes show which you watch best lying down on the ground face up. We enjoyed it but for young kids (6 and 8) it was somewhat boring. Still worth a visit.
,,wonderful,5.0,,the light display was fabulous get there early to sit - or lie on the ground for the best view be prepared for a slow exit after the display
,,Best done at night,4.0,,"These supertrees are best done at night. If you stay on the ground its free, otherwise you need to pay to go a skywalk. Well worth just sitting back and watching the light show and listening to the music"
,,Excellent concept,5.0,,"Don't miss the Gardens by the Bay. The Supertree Grove is free and you have to walk through it to get to the Cloud Dome or the Flower Dome. There's a skybridge that you can pay to see the park from above, weather permitting. Stay for the light show at 8 pm."
,,A must for the muscial and light show,4.0,,These artifical tress are breathtaking during their light show. You can just lie down here and look at these super grown trees as they dance with the light and music. If you are short on time you can skip it but definitely not a waste of time and effort.
,,Amazing...and free,5.0,,"Visited mid week and did the tree top walk, best time to visit as not to many people so we could take our time and enjoy the views. We revisited just before dark along with hundreds of others...spread your sweat shirt or jacket on the pavement and take a seat, allow enough room to lay on your back so you can look up and watch the light show that plays to music @7.30-8pm, very pretty, you have to be a little patient heading back to the MRT or you could do what we did and take an easy evening walk to the next station (Esplanade or Prominade)"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"I would recommend to go at night when the lights are on. We were so lucky because when we got to the top show started. It’s magical experience. We waited then to watch another show from the bottom, and I have to say I preferred to watch it this way. You can lay down on the ground, listen to music and watch the show. Must do!!!
Queues could be ridiculously long, it’s not really worth to wait an hour, since you have spectacular views from the bottom anyway."
,,STUNNING - DAY & NIGHT,5.0,,"This is just outstanding. Simply Breathtaking. During the day, do the Tree Walk & come back in the Night and watch the Light show! Fantastic"
,,supertree grove,4.0,,"Take the lift near Marina Bay Sands to the top floor,walk on the lion bridge . You will get a nice view of the Singaore Flyer, Flower Dome. and Cloud Forest. Cross the bridge and you can see the supertree grove, the iconic symbol of Garden by the Bay. It hosts light musical show 7.45 pm and 2nd one on 8.45pm. Go earlier to get a good view. , bring your camera. , mat if you wish to sit under the trees.The shows are free .You can reach here by the Bayfront Mrt station, walk to Exit B.If you are a visitor who only a few hours to wander in Garden by the Bay do not miss the spectacular musical light show 7.45 pm and 8.45 pm. If you have more time to spare, drop by the Flower Dome Cloud Flower and even the Satay by the Bay. You can also take the OCBC Skyway to pose pictures"
,,Super!!,5.0,,"The designs are very clever, futuristic and provide you with an opportunity to take some really nice pics. They are especially good at night."
,,Excellent Attraction... Must go at night..,5.0,,"CYC+CG ( 18.07.14 ) My family visited this place on our Singapore trip. There was good place enjoy with beautiful supertree with various light. We enjoyed this beautiful scene, and there was more beautiful at night, I think. If visit Singapore, must go.."
,,SUPER TREES,5.0,,"The Super Trees of Singapore were breathtaking. They are enormous structures covered in plants and greenery just as the rest of Singapore is. If you are brave enough I would recommend doing the bridge walk, fair warning it is not for the faint hearted. Also, make sure you stay and watch the super tree light show it may be short but it is well worth it!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"One of the main attraction, must visit specially the laser show at night. one of its kind and something not to be missed !"
,,Visit both day & night,5.0,,"I visited during the day to see the views of the city and returned again in the evening to watch the show. The show is only 15 mins long, you can lie down on one of the benches and watch the trees dance above you in time to the music"
,,Its free !,4.0,,"We came for the sound and light show like most people. Definitely worth doing, its another ""must do"" to tick off while visiting Singapore and doesn't disappoint.

Get there via Bayfront MRT and enjoy some great Singapore night time views as you walk to the trees. Afterwards, head back and finish the evening at Marina Bay Sands or the surrounding area."
,,Absolutely mesmerizing.,5.0,,I loved looking at the trees and learning more about them. And the evening sound and light show is a must-see for everyone.
,,Dont miss the show here,5.0,,Every evening they have a sound and light show here which is really nice to watch for adults as well as for kids.
,,Saw these at night - music and light show for free,5.0,,"Saw these at night during their twice nightly light and song show. Excellent fun, beautiful lights with classical music. No need to pay any admissions for these. You can stand under them for free and enjoy them. I believe there is some kind of sky walk you can pay to walk on under them. When you arrive in person you will see why that would be a waste of money. Just see them for free."
,,Lovely,5.0,,The trees light up at night and look really pretty. The sky walk is fun and is a great way to see some views across Singapore
,,Nice walk with great views,5.0,,"Like the other options in Manila Bay, I think that this is worth visiting as you get a great view of the Singapore, Bay area. Just take time walking through, a good opportunity for photos."
,,Group,4.0,,Tour group. Super trees outside gardens. Well worth the visit to appreciate the side. Sky walk looks good.
,,Review by Dr H C Matthew Sim - Tourists Should Visit When in Singapore.,5.0,,"Review by Dr H C Matthew Sim. Tourists Should Visit When in Singapore. Fake Trees but very impressive. It is Free to walk around. However, To get to the top of the tree you need to pay to take a lift up. I took a selfie from the ground. I think it is worth paying to go up to the skywalk. However, I have vertigo. Go in the evening or early morning. Afternoon is very hot. There is some fast food nearby. Regards Dr H C Matthew Sim."
,,"No need to take the Skyway, come back at night for the Garden Rhapsody!",4.0,,"The missing star in my review is the overpriced OCBC Skyway walk. I posted a couple of pictures, but really, you get the same from elsewhere in the park. The only difference is the more close up view of the supertrees.

However, coming back at night, the Garden Rhapsody was a delight! If you like movie soundtracks, challenge yourself to identify each song. Pretty easy and a wonderful show for your senses. Just a quick warning for those of you sensitive to mosquitoes: bring repellent for your walk back to the metro station! My friends said there were none, but I am a mosquito magnet and can attest that they are some and very bity! All ok during the day though. (partly repost from my review of Gardens by the Bay)

Note that the light show can also be enjoyed from at least two of the rooftop bars of the Marina Bay Sands towers (Spago & CÉ LA VI), without the music though."
,,Excellent Free Show at the Supertree Grove,5.0,,"The sound and light show at the Supertree Grove, and the trees themselves, are wonderful. And to think that it's free, is even more amazing. We went to the first evening show (each show is 15 minutes long), so that we could go to the later show from the Marina Bay Sands. The Supertree Grove show was way better. An absolute Must."
,,Superb Light Show,5.0,,"This was one of the best part of Gardens by the Bay, the light show. Especially the Bollywood songs were playing so it was more eventful. Free of charge and no tickets to watch the light show. Center of Singapore."
,,Light show,5.0,,Remember to set time aside to see the light show here in the evening. It starts at 19.45. And bring a camera - you will love it.
,,Lovely evening light show but plan ahead,5.0,,"The music and choreography for this short show is worth the effort.
Tips to make it nicer:
1) Take a picnic supper or at the very least take some water bottles.
2) Take a beach towel from your hotel so you can spread it out and watch from under the trees laying down. Your backpack makes a nice pillow. Much more enjoyable than straining your neck or pick a viewing spot from farther away.
3) Have your exit planned out. If you think you will get a taxi you must wait in a lengthy taxi line across the street (you can't get in the queue that is only for guests). If you plan to take the MRT (subway) it will be quicker but make sure you have a pass with at least $3 on it or you will be stuck in a long queue to purchase a card or top off your card. If you have a day pass then you are set. I found the regular pass more economical since we were there over several days and I planned to use the MRT on several days.
Have fun and check out some of the other sights around either before or after the show."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,It's really show the capabilities of Singaporean people. Very nice place to go. It's even better at night
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Unbelievable. For me, it had a sci-fi appeal. I belong to a 'Tripods' TV serial age and it reminded me of the same. At night, it presents a different angle, with two light shows done daily, to the sounds of an opera or a symphony. Beautiful."
,,Great show and afternoon by the trees,5.0,,"They are great to see during the day or Eve. We arrived here about 3pm to see the super trees. We then headed to the flower dome and cloud forest. Finally we went to have a bite to eat (better to eat before you go towards this area, as although the good court in Marina bay sands is ok it's not great).

630 climb the super tree to do walk way (queue goes quickly).

745 lovely free light show with music. Make sure to get a seat about 7/715 under the main parts of the tree. Is worth it as it gets crazy busy.

Another sitting at 845"
,,"If you are there, it is worth it",4.0,,"The walk way above the supertrees is cool and if you are visiting them, then it is worth paying extra money just for the experience of going up there - however it is a bit short and if you don't go up, it is not a big loss - the gardens by the bay structures themselves to walk around are free, and just to visit them is breathtaking, the design excellent, and at night they come to life with music and this is all free - you can just stick to that quite satisfactorily."
,,Free light show,5.0,,Head high on any evening for a fabulous complimentary free show. Can get very busy so arrive early to sercure a good spot
,,Superb,5.0,,"The night time show is like a New Year's Eve fireworks show....only better and it's on every night! How lucky is Singapore? It's an environmentally friendly, beautiful, creative and artistic show, we lay back on the seating in the gardens and listened to the beautiful selection of music with the Tree's lighting flashing along to the music. We loved it."
,,Interesting and Unusual,4.0,,Interesting and unusual attraction. Lovely surroundings. But I don't think it's worth paying to walk along the elevated walkway.
,,Fantastrees,4.0,,"Easy to get t on foot from Marina Bay Sands Hotel. And then you can stroll around at your leisure. Lovely gardens to view - all well laid out, And special little areas to charm and entertain the kids.
Night is the best time to go because the 'trees' are lit up and it has an element of fantasy. Good timing would let you have a late afternoon stroll in a lowish temperature and then be ready or the lights at twilight.
Super."
,,Beautiful at night,5.0,,"We strolled through at night and enjoyed the changing colors of the ""trees,"" which are large metal structures covered in plants that are filling in the structures. There is a walkway a few stories up that folks can pay to access, but we just walked around on the ground and enjoyed the gardens. I'd like to see it during the day and wonder if it's as impressive as at night."
,,Fabulous place,5.0,,"This place is mind blowingly beautiful, especially at night, it is a must see. The colours of the rainbow as well as every other colour."
,,Out of this world,5.0,,You must view this in the evening when the lights come on. Quite magical. Very impressive structures to wander around and admire and such a wonderful garden setting. If you are going to Marina Bay Sands Hotel or shopping center then it is easy to include the Supertree Grove and the Cloud Forest dome.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,One of the highlights of our trip to Singapore. Must visit for sure! It's amazing how they built such structure. So much thought went into it. There's a light show twice every night. It's worth waiting around for. It can get crowded but you can see the lights anywhere you sit or stand. The park itself is a wonderful place to walk around. You can spend hours strolling along and take photos
,,Night view is fantasty,4.0,,"Me and my teenage daughter went there at night, it's really beautiful, we all felt very excited about it."
,,from top looks like you are in some different world,5.0,,i stayed in marina bay sands and couldnt resist myself to go to this park as my room had a view of supertree grove initially i thought i would nt enjoy this park as whatever is there that i can see from my room but it was exactly not the same park worth a go it should b added in your tour of singapore
,,spectacular light show,5.0,,Don't miss the light/ music show at 8pm. Get there early to get a seat. It's free and quite spectacular!
,,Loved it,5.0,,Enjoyed the supertrees and the light show at night. Well worth watching although it was crowded. I would do it again if going to Singapore. Take plenty of videos.
,,Light Show at Dusk,5.0,,"We went there around 4:00 just to make sure we have time to walk around sit and wait for the light show at dusk. It drizzled a little bit, but our umbrellas were ready. Mind you folks, bring an umbrella to use while walking under the heat of the sun and a folding fan to cool off yourself a little bit. It was a 15 minute show with music and dancing lights. Just AWESOME! Of course there is an entrance fee."
,,Evening concert with colorful trees,4.0,,Evening concert with colorful trees Somewhere have a light fountain. In Singapore you have to see the illuminated giant metal structures - trees. Trees dance to classical opera arias. Pleasant spectacle in Singapore's summer breeze.
,,Visit the SkyWalk,5.0,,A great place to walk around. Excellent views from the SkyWalk. The night show is fantastic and not to be missed - especially so as it's free.
,,Fantastic Night Light & Music Show,5.0,,"The night light show was absolutely superb. As the darkness approached, the lights in the trees were fantastic on their own along with the Singapore Flyer and Marina Bay Sands Sky Park as backdrops.
Then, when the lights changed colour and lit up the night sky in tune with several pieces of beautiful music, everyone in attendance just stood in awe. No one moved until the show finished.
We would go again in a heartbeat, given the opportunity to go back to Singapore."
,,Must go place to visit,5.0,,"No matter how many times I have been in Singapore, this is THE attraction that acts as a magnet. Do not miss the 7:40 pm show."
,,Great at night,4.0,,"It was great object when you took a picture at night time. And should come earlier, if you want to enjoy the walk."
,,Love the Supertree Light show,4.0,,Supertrees are located inside Garden by the Bay. There are 4-5 supertrees and out of which there 3 big ones. There is light show at night time for 15-20mins. Dont miss that light show.
,,a must a night time..,5.0,,if you can potter along at 7.45pm theres a funky light show to music - free.. stangely a very calming place..
,,Worth the visit & stay for the nightly display,4.0,,"the nightly display, is worth a visit, we had a good time, the night we were there, they were telling a children story rhymes - the story was good & light display was brilliant"
,,A nice idea but not overly engaging,4.0,,We enjoyed the view from here but it was not something that could not be seen in other parts of the park. For the price it is good value and we ticked it off.
,,The icons of Singapore,5.0,,"The supertrees are one the most identifiable icons of Singapore. They are must visit tourist attractions in Singapore.

Each of the supertrees is decorated with different plants and vines. The structures are not just designed to look like a tree but made to mimic different functionalities of a tree. These trees look more spectacular when the lights come on."
,,What a spectacle!,5.0,,"We visited fairly early in the morning so that we could avoid the heat (and crowds!).
When we went on the Sky Walk, there were only a handful of other people on there. The views out over the city was incredible.
We went back in the evening for the free show where the trees light up to music, which was just magical.

Supertree Grove is such a unique and wonderful place, you have to go if you're in Singapore."
,,Brilliant design,5.0,,"The place is free to visit and is almost always crowded. Now, I know why! The design is brilliant, especially at night. Definitely the place to visit if you're in Singapore."
,,Great light and music show,4.0,,We were to the Gardens at the Bay area mainly for the light and music performance at the Supertree Grove. The show was undoubtedly worth the trip and waiting time.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"The skywalk along the supertrees at the Gardens at the Bay provides an entirely different view over the park, especially looking down at the palm trees and their amazing growth patterns. The walk is best done towards the end of the afternoon, when the heat is dropping and the light is great for photography."
,,Fantastic light show,5.0,,Really lovely to watch at dusk/night time and pleasant to view during the day. The park itself is free but the grove skywalk itself is an additional charge and does get very busy during the evening. Very much worth it though.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The super tree groves are located in the Gardens by the Bay area. The park is quite large and there's an option to take the electric car.
,,Nice,5.0,,Was really nice to walk through and see the iconic Gardens by the Bay Super Grove. You can pay to walk along the walkway of the Super Grove for $8.
,,We went to see the light show,5.0,,We were there early January and the the grove was teaming with people to see something quite different and spectacular. Great place to go with the kids as well.
,,In another world...,5.0,,"It was incredible to see the Supertree Grove against the skyline of the city. It definitely felt out of this world and like many have mentioned, very Avatar-like and futuristic. It is located close to the other sites like the Cloud Forest and Gardens by the Bay so it's a must visit if you're already going to those other spots. You can choose to pay or just walkway or just take a stroll below and look up at the beautifully designed ""trees"" - feeling like I've stepped into another dimension. Definitely check it out if you're in the area."
,,Super way to finish the tour of the Gardens.,5.0,,This grove of supertrees is an incredible way to finish your tour of the Gardens by the Bay. The classical music which compliments the amazing light show from the tree tops is spell binding. The operatic voices and orchestra fill the night and it is impossible not to be awed. Don't miss it.
,,The best show I've ever seen,5.0,,The best show I've ever seen. And it is for free! We want to go here and see it again and again. We are excited!
,,It's like stepping onto 'Pandora' in the film 'Avatar'!,5.0,,"This is amazing. The gardens, the Supertree Grove and the fact that you can enjoy a free light-show each night, or if you wish, pay to sit on top of one of the Supertree's in an alfresco bar for a drink, or take in the views from the elevated walkway."
,,fantastic place to visit while you are at the MBS area,5.0,,"im not a park guy, i prefer a more natural outdoor place but this is the place to bring visiting friends and family if you want to impress them at how amazing Singapore is."
,,enjoy the show,5.0,,Kids just love the show.. they enjoy the light and the song.. don't forget to take the picture before its really dark
,,Interesting,5.0,,Very impressive design. Set in a nice area which is kept clean and tidy. Not too many people around so a pleasant visit.
,,Quite spectacular at night,5.0,,Definitely more impressive at dusk than during the day. Time your visit for the light show and watch from the ground. Pick your vantage point early as it can get crowded.
,,My favourite thing to do in Singapore,5.0,,"Beautiful in both the day and night.
We took a blanket and some snacks and found a small but nice place to watch the light show at night. It gets very busy so dont expect to have the place to yourself but it is worth it. You can go up into one of the trees for the light show but the line is super long so I wouldnt bother with it."
,,Stunning show,5.0,,"Bring an umbrella as it is an outside display. Fabulous show. The show is on at 7;45 and 8;45 pm. There are very few seats so older people might consider bringing a folding chair. It is a 5 minute walk from the domes but only a 2 minute walk from the area to the taxis. It was a highlight of our trip after having seen Garden Dome at Gardens by the Bay which was also a wonderful experience. Smooth paths,great layout, family friendly."
,,just amazing,5.0,,the tree by themselves reminds me of avatar movie. they run two show at night with light and music. that was the best of Singapore for more. i like it so much i went there two times just to enjoy the show.
,,This was a real highlight of the trip,5.0,,The supertree grove is a must see at night when they are all lit up. The Garden Rhapsody was amazing! One of the best sound and light shows I have ever seen. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Wait till dark,4.0,,A free and fantastic light show to synced music for 15 enjoyable minutes. Dont miss this one when there.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We loved Garden by the Bay, we loved to take photo with this amazing garden. We are able to access in there with free entrance."
,,Spectacular show,5.0,,"Very impressive light show! Should he watched from a slight distance though, just to catch the whole synchronicity."
,,Stunning,4.0,,"Absolutely stunning looks so much bigger from the ground up close, be sure to take your super tree tour when you arrive if the weather is good as they close down when the weather turns. Unfortunately due to bad weather we didn't get up to the top and will be back next time to complete our gardens adventure.
Highly recommended for all ages."
,,Highlight of singapore and one of your lifetime memories.,5.0,,"Make sure you pay to go up the boardwalk and preferably for the free 20 minute night show, 745 every night."
,,Super nice,5.0,,"A must see in Gardens by the Bay, day and night. a landmark where nature meets human design. Free admission, including the wonderful light and sound show at night. Wander around these vertical gardens but also see the area from above a go on the OCBC Skyway (admission fee). This walkway connects two of the super trees. Nice views."
,,simply outstanding light show! one of the very best experiences for sure!!,5.0,,"The gardens are extensive, and free!!
worth an explore for a few hours, free kids water park as well, but the money is in the super trees
$8 adult gets you admission to the Supertree platform which is best timed for when the light shows happen at 7.45 and 8.45 pm daily
the trees look nice during the day, but are amazing! at night.
the show lasts around 15 mins and is a spectacular mix of light and opera and beautiful views of the gardens and city.
A must for sure, can't believe i missed it last time i was here

really nice walk to marina bay sands after to get a taxi... otherwise wait for hours in the crowded park drop off area..."
,,Go at sunset!,5.0,,"Every-night at 7:30 and 8:30 there is a light show that goes along with music. I enjoyed the Sky-Walk, but thought it was pretty cool to see the show from the ground."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"We visited in the evening for the sound and light show , it is breathtaking. This is a must see if you visit Singapore."
,,Great at night,5.0,,You should aim to go their for the night shows even if you have strolled around during the day. The walkway was worth doing ($8 2018). We had no queues and your allowed 15min on the walkway with your ticket.
,,Fabulous musical laser show,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is an impressive and great venue for chilling out, even for a Singaporean like me, despite being an obvious tourist spot. It is transformed every evening, and my favourite time to visit is after 6.30pm, just enough time for a quick stroll or short run around, before relaxing and enjoying the sunset. The highlight is definitely the laser musical show, which is exhilarating and soothing for me at the same time. The vivid colours and great tempo music is a feast for the visual and auditory senses, which helps me de-stress, and always leaves me soothed and energised. Love bringing overseas friends here, and the best part is, it's free."
,,Dont miss laser show!,4.0,,"Gardens by the Bay has these three attractions - Flower dome, Cloud Forest and Supertree Grove. There is entrance fee for Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Dont miss the laser show at 7 pm at Supertree Grove. Its of 15 minutes but worth every minute. We did Flower Dome and Cloud Forest first and did the laser show before heading out for Dinner. Kids will love this!"
,,Magical!,4.0,,I've had the light show on my Singapore bucket list for ages and was finally able to attend last night. It's great that it is on every night and free of charge as well as being easily accessible from the MRT - all good points for tourists! I thoroughly enjoyed watching the trees come alive and would return to see it again if I am ever back in Singapore. My only negative thought was that it could have been little bit longer than fifteen minutes. Definitely recommend!
,,Impressive but not after a day on your feet!,3.0,,"We hit this at the 1st 'show' & were not early to get a seat on a park bench or even a curb so had to stand for the whole show, which is only 15 minutes but after a long day of walking it was not worth the aching feet. We also did not have the best spot for standing & did not get the full effect of the lights. The music is a tad too loud for my ears as well."
,,Spectacular Show,5.0,,The show every night here is a must see. We went twice in our 5 days in Singapore. The price is right - FREE.
,,Stunning! Make time for this,5.0,,The super tree grove is amazing. Both night and day! The trees light up and are magnificent to see at night. You could easily spend a couple of hours here. There are also tours where you can walk along a platform on them.
,,Supertree Grove,5.0,,The artificical tree of Garden by the bay is super awesome. specially the light show in the evening.
,,Don’t miss this...,5.0,,"This is a super show, which happens in garden by the bay. The timing are 7:45 & 8:45pm. To have an amazing experience you should lie down on the Floor & watch it.... you should be at the venue 30 minutes before the show starts...More"
,,Super beautiful,5.0,,Trees provide shelter but Supertree provides a lot more than it :) Do visit around 6-7 pm to watch the LED light show with soothing music.
,,Ok,5.0,,Super tree grove are exhibits built to look like trees with orchids and foliage growing up them at the gardens of the bay complex which light up at night . We found them to be ok but a bit old fashioned and a bit Las...More
,,A living spectacle,5.0,,"This is living art as you would never see anywhere else (well I haven't). it is just as spectacular from the ground as it is from the walkway, try and get there later in the day for when it's illuminated, that really is something else."
,,Terrific trees,5.0,,Amazing technology with environmental emphasis. The gardens are easily accessed and free. Nighttime show - Rhapsody with lights and music was excellent. Should not be missed. Highlight of holiday.
,,spectacular at night,4.0,,"a fantastic tourist attractions in Singapore, which is best viewed at night when the supertrees are lit up and then also 'play' to music."
,,heaven make by simple LED.,5.0,,The “supertree” grove and elevated walkway light up synchronized to music.If you are in Singapore do not miss out on this unique venue
,,landmark,5.0,,"one of the landmarks of singapore. close to the merlion. you can come here in the afternoon because it has the most beautiful scenery, when the supertree glow. to come here for free."
,,"""Garden Rhapsody"" sound and light show",5.0,,"Every night at 7:45pm and 8:45pm, the “supertree” grove and elevated walkway light up synchronized to music. The choreography changes regularly; they’ve had a show set to tunes from rock to Broadway musicals; during the holiday season the lights dance to ten Christmas carols!"
,,"Beautiful at night, go and enjoy the show",5.0,,"If you are in Singapore do not miss out on this unique venue, it is truly beautiful. i like to have dinner at Satay by the Bay first then wander through the gardens at night, the light installations are beautiful"
,,Really justified Garden City,5.0,,"Singapore is generally devoid of any large grooves and they built their own groove farm to fill that void. The groove is really wounderful and even beautiful at night during the light show. You can also do a skywalk by paying 8 SGD. This is a very good picnic spot and many events happen at this place. Overall, this is a very good place to enjoy."
,,Astounding - do not miss the show,5.0,,This is incredible! You cannot miss the show in the evening; its absolutely astounding with the music and lights.
,,Simply brilliant,5.0,,The Supertree Grove is fascinating to see during the day. I didn't know technology and engineering could be camouflaged so beautifully. The light show at night was brilliant. Be prepared for a big crowd.
,,Love the Supertrees,5.0,,The Supertree Grove is incredibly unique and beautiful. What an amazing feat of design and engineering. The Supertrees are even more beautiful at night when they are lit up.
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,Don't miss it. It provides a great vantage point for some excellent photographs with the Marina Bay Sands in the background.
,,walk in the sky,5.0,,"cant imagine this tree grove , when tou alight the lift going up you feel the trill of like floating with so much joy of seeing those amazing view up and looking for sceneries around the palce, so beautiful and amazing experience we had."
,,Good,5.0,,These structures are well made for energy production yet important for tourists. They are good and well lighted at light and sound show. Must visit A sky walk is also available if you don't have fear of heights
,,Dazzling,5.0,,Be sure to take in the nightly shows at Supertree Grove...absolutely stunning. Get there early and grab a seat on the benches as the place fills up very quickly as you get closer to show time. An absolutely delightful experience definitely worth the trip...and it's free on top of it!!
,,Tall artificial 'trees',4.0,,The super tree grove is worth a visit. The skywalk between the 'trees' looked interesting although I did not try it as the queue for tickets was long and I didn't have the time. I am sure there would be a great view from there as they tower above the ground. Also worth visiting at night as they are lit up colourfully.
,,Beatiful place,5.0,,"We went there to see the supertree light show that happens at night and also went to the skywalk, both are worth doing."
,,Day time visit,5.0,,We visited the Supertree Grove in the Gardens by the Bay. The supertrees are covered in natural planting with lots of flowers. I would have loved to have seen them at night.
,,Particularly good at night,4.0,,The light and music show at 19h45 and 20h45 showcase these magnificent trees and structures well at night.
,,Prettier at a distance,3.0,,"Worth seeing, but, not essential to enter. Most of the appeal can be seen at a distance. That said, going up to the top is pleasant."
,,Very Beautiful at Night with Lighting,5.0,,"You should visit this attraction twice. Once in daytime and once at night. At daytime, you can have the sky walk, which is a walk on a bridge between some of those trees from above. But you have to buy a ticket for that walk. Watching the trees from ground and wander around those are free of charge. The place is very beautiful at night with lighting."
,,Marvellous,5.0,,"Walking through this grove is a great wonder and if you don’t go on the skywalk it’s absolutely free, the light show starts around 8 pm and it’s very popular, the way the trees and skywalk are illuminated is fantastic"
,,Supertree Grove,5.0,,"Please do not miss this spectacular site. The little lift to the top is cute, but the walk on the bridge to see the amazing view is worth every penny."
,,Evening show,4.0,,"Beautiful production at dusk. It definitely reminds you of Disney World and Epcot; having said that, it is still world visiting."
,,Visit in the evenings,5.0,,"Light shows are 7.45pm and 8.45pm each evening. If you time it right (we did by sheer luck), you can buy your ticket to go up to the elevated walkway between the super trees as the light show is happening. As you're only allowed 15 minutes up there (you are subtly moved along, but it doesn't feel rushed) you really have to get the timing right with the queues. If you can't do that, lie back on the tree surrounds on the ground level and watch the show for free!"
,,Beautiful and not to be missed,5.0,,"Enjoyed this very much and happened to be here just at the time the light show began. It started raining though so we had to watch it from afar, still this whole area is a fantastic place for tourists to visit. Enjoyable for all ages."
,,spectacular lighting!,4.0,,"love the light show and the ambience it creates for Garden Rhapsody shows. some people might not enjoy it, but I liked it so much!"
,,Fantasitc light show,5.0,,Witnessed one of the best light and sound show in the evening. Also experienced the enthusiasm around the different light schemes
,,Truly Stunning night show,5.0,,Our 1st trip to Singapore and so glad we night visited the Gardens by the bay. The LED display complete with music accompaniment was spectacular. It brought tears to the eyes of a lot of people thru shear joy and astonishment.
,,Superb,5.0,,marvelous and well maintained - we were so happy - all family enjoyed is- really educative also - will come again
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Do not miss this!!. It is a must visit place in Singapore. Even if you are going for a business visit, make tome for this. It is a magnificent structure and view from the top is incredible"
,,Wow wow wow!!!,5.0,,This is a must see attraction! But recommend go late afternoon as the light show starts at 7.45 pm. This is spectacular!!! Lots of lights to music - WOW. A photographer ‘s dream
,,A Beautiful View From The Walkway,5.0,,"We were taken here on a tour to see the night light show. The show itself is free and beautifully done to music. At that time we could not go up to the bridge due to time constraints. We did however go back the next day. Take a lift up to the walkway, walk across and then take a lift back down. The views from the top are wonderful."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"DO NOT MISS IT. Go at night & see the trees lit up & they have a light show to music. We were sooo lucky we had Waltz music & it was just so beautiful. Take a blanket and sit on the grass, its free. You can also go up in a lift & walk through the tops of the super trees, fantastic photo opportunity. Do It..it is wonderful"
,,The night show is fantastic!,5.0,,My daughter and son-in-law enjoyed the spectacular light show on a recent June night! Stirring music accompanies the dazzling lights. Kids and adults alike enjoy this.
,,Beautiful beyond words,5.0,,"We were lucky enough to be able to visit the Supertree Grove in the evening and watch the sound and light show. It was an unforgettable experience and our daughters loved it just as much as we did. All those flowers, lights and the music made for a surreal show that seemed to be out of this world. Will definitely return and try to catch it again!"
,,One of the Highlights.,5.0,,Our visit to the Supertree Grove at night was one of the highlights of our visit to a Gardens By The Bay. The light show was spectacular and not to be missed.
,,Fascinating Concept,4.0,,SuperTrees is an excllent innovation. It is actually chimneys for burnt natural leaves from the large garden. Converted into stunning visual super trees they are really stunning and is the place in the evenings where there is a fantastic light display with astounding first class music accompaniment. Unusal but excellent innovative ideas. A real achievement
,,Not to be missed!!!!,5.0,,"If you are doing a stop over in Singapore, don't miss out on seeing Gardens By The Bay, Absolutely well worth going to see"
,,Worth to visit during both day and night time,5.0,,Don't be afraid of the sun when visiting during daytime. The evening/sunset and night time provide different feeling when exploring the same place. Photogenic anywhere you turn.
,,One of the highlights of Singapore,3.0,,"Most of the things to see and do in Singapore is located around the Marina of Singapore. We took an uber from the Merlion to get to supertree grove so not sure how to get there with MRT or bus.

The admission to the supertrees are free. But you need a ticket to go to the walkway. We are allowed to in the walkway only for about 45 mins. There are 2 free laser shows every night at 7:45 and 8:45. We viewed the laser show from the ground.

Getting out after the laser show takes some time as every one is trying to get out at the same time. There are taxi stands outside as soon as you get out.

Please note that the walkway will close if there is bad weather. Even if it is not raining but overcast they will close. Not a bad idea to find out whether they are open before going if it is about to rain."
,,Awesome light/music show at night!,5.0,,"Make sure to go to the Supertree grove after sundown to sit & watch the amazing light & music show! There are a few times they do the show each night, with the last one being at 8:45pm. It is also free to watch. It would also be a great experience to watch the show from the sky view deck at the Marina Bay Sands if you want the higher view of the light show."
,,Rain,2.0,,"The place itself is worth visiting. I suggest taking a picture at the top. But I can not say anything good about organizational issues. Six times I took a taxi and went there, and it only succeeded on the sixth time. Due to rain, this object was closed all the time."
,,Super tree grove review,5.0,,Must see attraction for all. Entry free. Restaurants and toilets are nearby. Best time to visit is after sunset. Free laser show at 7.45pm and 8.45 pm.The place becomes very crowded during the laser show.
,,Wow,5.0,,"You should really take the time to get across and see the show. Spectacular trees, fun to watch both the lightship and the crowds."
,,Light show and evening visit,5.0,,"Tickets are purchased to go up the trees from a separate counter near the bottom of the trees.

There is a maximum stay of 15 minutes up the walkway however we found that due to the lightshow people were standing around the entrance waiting to be up there for the show.

This meant that when it came to the show there was a standstill across the middle of the bridge - and for someone that doesn’t like heights too much it wasn’t ideal being in such close proximity to other people!

But overall a good experience and I would return."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"As part of the Gardens by the Bay area, the Super Trees are impressive from a distance, but amazing up close. Try and be there for the light and sound show about 7:45 each night."
,,Light Show amazing,5.0,,Gardens by the Bay Light Shownot to be missed.First show takes place at 7.45 pm and the second show comes on at 8.45 pm. The light show is free – just show up at Gardens by the Bay's Supertree Grove and enjoy the lights and music. Spectacular!
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"What a beautiful show, the lights and music are perfectly timed, mesmerising, brings out the child in all of us"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Impressive architecture at any time of the day...but at night the light show is fantastic entertainment. Gets very busy so be early if you want a seat, otherwise take a blanket and lie on the floor."
,,Memorable walk with a Fantastic Light Show,4.0,,"The place is centrally located and very easy to find. Best time to visit is Evening or after sunset to see the amazing light show. Light effects were awesome, Indian Bollywood song were also played there. Walk around garden is free. But walking on the tree ramps is chargeable. Spend 2 hrs there to experience the show. Must visit place."
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,"If you enjoy a good light show then make the trip to the garedns at night to see the Super Tree Show. Saw the 15 minute show as part of the hop on, hop off night tour. There was really only enough time to come in find a seat (it is very popular and quite crowded), watch the show and get back on the bus. I would recommend doing this as a solo experience at night if you want to see more of the gardens."
,,"they are smaller, than it loks on pictures",3.0,,"Singapore is not offering too many attraction for visitors IMO. Supertrees are nice idea, but frankly, when seeing pics from time to time before visit I expected, that this structures are maybe twice higher, that they are in reality."
,,Just the most spectacular Light show - ever!,5.0,,Well it was for us! Having wandered and enjoyed the gardens in the gathering dusk we purchased our tickets to the 'sky walk' up in the trees - fabulous! And the light show dramatic! We then descended to the gardens and watched it again. The different ground level perspective was even more impressive! This is a must if you visit Singapore! '
,,An must visit when in Singapore,5.0,,"My wife and I have recently returned from 5 nights in Singapore. Being our first trip many of our friends said we had to visit Supertree Grove as part of a Gardens by the Bay visit.

Supertree Grove was everything we had expected. We visited this at night and enjoyed the music light show which is held twice nightly. We also walked along the skywalk which gave a spectacular view of Singapore city all lit up at night. Being located in the grounds of Gardens by the Bay, walking to each attraction is easy and close to each other.

This is a very popular attraction with crowds everywhere.

As my friends said and now we do, a must visit. Enjoy!"
,,Must do night walk,4.0,,Great park to walk through at night after dinner the light show from trees is amazing. Good exercise also and the walk can be done as fast as you like. Popular with joggers.
,,It’s a very nice place to visit with a nice view very high up,5.0,,"It’s a very nice place to visit. You can go up to top of the Supertree and walk across a platform to the other Supertrees that is connecting the platform. It provides a nice view that is high up. To go into the Supertree, you have to buy a ticket. They only sell a set number per day as it can attract a lot of people. So tickets are first come first serve. I usually buy my ticket early on and go on it later."
,,"AMAZING PLACE TO ENJOY A DRINK AND FOOD WITH VIEW ON MARINA BAY SANDS HOTEL, MAY 2018.",5.0,,"During a 8 nights stay in Singapore, sleeping 6 nights in Marina Bay Sands Hotel and 2 nights in Mandarin Oriental Hotel, I took the opportunity on a beautiful night, to go to SuperTree Groove, in order to have drink and food. Location is absolutely amazing and is a must be done once staying in Singapore. The view is just awesome by night and if you can come at sunset, it is even better ! I will soon post some photos to my review, as 1 photo speaks more than 1'000 words..."
,,Must see!,5.0,,"In all of my travels, this is one of my very favorites places. The light show is timed to music using themes. It is magical! get there at least 30 min. before the show to get a seat."
,,cool,4.0,,"This whole area is worthwhile to walk around, Near the bay garden, which is good to go to. Especially at nght place to be with a light show at 1915 (I think)"
,,"Supertree Grove, Gardens by the Bay",5.0,,Wow! Photo opportunities a-plenty daytime and evening. Light show with classical music a winner. Absolutely wonderful
,,Walk by day and watch at night,5.0,,"Walk among the grove, enjoy the grass in a city of skyscrapers and stay for the evening light show. Wonderful from beneath or viewed from the nearby hotel observation walkway."
,,"Relaxing afternoon, Wonderful evening",5.0,,"It's best to visit in the afternoon and roam around, observe the nature and science intermingling. Then grab some space and lie down, because in the evening they will present you a spectacular light-show along with amazing music; and this is the best part. As it's open to all, you will find yourself surrounded by a huge crowd during the show."
,,Go only during night,3.0,,Artificial Trees made of metal and other building materials Day visit could be humid and not enjoyable Go in the night to enjoy the lights and night show
,,Better at night.,3.0,,"During day time nothing really impressive; however, at night it is totally different. It is worth visiting at night during the light show. Beautiful!"
,,Over priced,4.0,,Nothing great about going up there. The light show was so much better. Remember to book via KLOOK as it's cheaper
,,Better at night than the day,5.0,,"We were here all day, so did the obligatory walk around them, was not very busy, so we were not moved on, as you are when it is busy.. was ok...But at night the music and light show is awesome. We were lucky to watch and listen to the star wars theme. Spectacular. You do have to get there early to get the best seats."
,,Go in the evening!,4.0,,The Supertrees are amazing and beautiful structures. We saw them at night and watched the free light show which was amazing! I personally found them a bit disappointing in the day but at night they are spectacular.
,,Amazing sight,4.0,,One of the best attractions in Singapore. These come to life during light and sound show. A treat to watch
,,Stunning,5.0,,"You can see the trees from the distance but nothing will prepare you for seeing them close up.
Wander around get a sense of their size and engineering marvel and then walk the tree top walk for spectacular views.
Go back at night for the light show !!"
,,Tourist walk in the park,5.0,,Top! Good stroll parkway. Good signboard for direction and beautiful scenery. Destination food court
,,Go for the free night show! Entrance to the Grove is free!,5.0,,I went to the light show at 8.45 a couple of days ago and I loved it. I lay down at the base of the large central tree and enjoyed the classical music and pretty light show. As it was free I would highly recommend!
,,A must do & see,5.0,,stunning - particularly the night time show. Coupled with the two gardens you just have to go. An good afternoon - allow a few hours
,,A must to do in Singapore,5.0,,"Be there at 7pm to enjoy an amazing light and sound show, grab some takeaway and a blanket an enjoy."
,,A garden with a difference,5.0,,"After watching the sunset from the observation deck at the Marina Sands Bay hotel we strolled onto the Supertree Grove. A great site and took lots of interesting pictures. I didn't realise that the trees change colour constantly, which gives the impression of being in a different garden. A must see if you visit Singapore."
,,Tourists can't appreciatec it,3.0,,The groove is an artificial big trees made out of metal and otherbuilding materials. Plants were let to grow around it. The structure performs basic tree function of solar energy production and oxygen production. Its a state of scientific art that can't be appreciated by tourists except maybe for the light works it has by night.
,,Unmissable experience,5.0,,"With only 2 days to explore Singapore, time was definitely at a premium. As my wife and I are not overly fond of shopping, we were very worried that there was little else to do, especially as we were located in the Orchard Hotel, surrounded by shopping mall after shopping mall.We decided on an afternoon and evening excursion to The Gardens by the Bay. We used public transport to get there, in our case The Metro. Very easy to use, and we got to our destination without any problems. The gardens are fantastic, complete mixture of meadow, tropical woodland, and semi formal, and its very large. Multiple sculptures and water features and lots of iconic views, especially of the Helix Bridge.The 2 biospheres are also worth a visit, we timed the visit to the cloud forest to coincide with night falling. Then came the highlight , the Supertree Grove light show. We pitched at the base of one of the Supertrees to watch the show, and it turned out to be a great location. Unfortunately, this is where my review is a little less helpful, the lightshow is just amazing, lots of sequences and lots of colour plus accompanying music, simply put you just have to see it."
,,Night show,5.0,,"I didn't see this at day time - only night time, and I also didn't explore much around the area, but I was taken to the night lightshow by a friend who had seen it twice before and it was incredible! I'd gear this visit at the end of seeing Gardens by the bay, botanical gardens and getting something to eat at Satay by the bay. Head here in time for the light show and it is the PERFECT way to end a day here. The show itself was relatively long and it felt really spectacular."
,,great view nothing more,2.0,,"Of course the view is incredible but service, cliningness and atmosphere should be reconsidered if they want to keep the prices the feature!"
,,The light show at night was amazing,5.0,,"I would recommend the light show in the evening, it was absolutely beautiful. It was nice to wander around and of cause it's free!"
,,Impressive,4.0,,"If you are traveling in Singapore for a couple of days, you need to visit the SuperTree Grove! Nice place, very nice view, cocktails are quite expensive."
,,Scene of the nightly Light Display - exquisite and unique,5.0,,"Wonderful - if you only have time to see one thing, make it this! The lights are co-ordinated and dance to music - when I visited the theme was Waltzes."
,,The light show at night was spectacular,5.0,,"I would definitely recommend the light show in the evening, it was absolutely beautiful. It was nice to wander around and you didn't have to pay to see them (although to go into the cloud or flower domes you did)."
,,Just Love Atmosphere,5.0,,Nice place to walk around.These trees reminded me of a scene from the movie Avatar.day time its looks so beautiful and night time the place is looks so magical because of the light show
,,Magical - even at my age,5.0,,"It has been 20+ years since I was in Singapore last and to start my current trip at this magical location, brought the child in me to the forefront. It is a spectacular piece of garden, reaching to the heavens and a must visit for the young and old.

The walk way 22 meters high can trigger your vertigo, but Heaven can too."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Visit around 6:30 PM to get the last bit of daylight and stay for the light show at 7:45. It gets very crowded, but it's beautiful."
,,Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,Another architectural wonder. Purple 'trees' covered with natural foliage making their stand like they're from another planet. Unfortunately we didnt have time to walk the high bridge that runs through the garden due to a thunderstorm that broke shortly after we arrived. Just beautiful.
,,Woow! Really go there sometime!,4.0,,Very nice to walk trough it! Impressive to see! In one of the tree's is a restaurant! Really cool though!
,,Singapore Vacation,5.0,,"We were many times in Singapore before, but never were in Groove. we were first time this may 2018 and we were excited and surprised how it cool and amazing! we felt our selves like we are on Pandora planet. especially when light and music started and evening!"
,,A magical place especially at night,5.0,,"A few visits are needed as the trees are amazing to see during the day, but more spectacular at night. The light and sound show a magical experience. It can get busy but everyone is polite. A must see when in Singapore"
,,a return visit,5.0,,"Loved the trees, learned so much about their construction. Next visit we have to see them at night. I went on the walkaway, very cool."
,,WOW Wonderfully done,5.0,,"These supretree groove is great creation, and amazingly decorated by lights , you should visit during the evening"
,,Gardens by the bay,5.0,,"This was a $10 taxi ride from the Orchard Hotel, The entrance tickets can be purchased in advance from the Hotel tourist desk. The tickets included all the various attractions at the Bay. It was well worth a visit by day and again in the evening when there are light shows and the skyline changes"
,,Light and Music on Giant Artificial Trees,4.0,,"Mesmerizing show in the night, go early and pick your spot, and lie down enjoy. it can get quite crowded without a space near the trees. But once it starts, it is absolute delight for 20 minutes or so. So crowded getting back to MRT from there could be difficult experience. Good experience for children and teens."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Absolutely amazing. Go in the evening for the light & music show. It is an incredible sight. It is free entry and well worth the visit.
,,Musical Trees,4.0,,These structures are just amazing. An absolute must is staying till after dark to see these superstructures lit up to music.
,,Gardens by the Bay - my favorite place for a stroll,5.0,,Wonderfully designed and with the Supertrees a stunning piece of garden architecture. Take a walk all the way to the Barrage. For a sundowner the roof top bar of the highest Superbere is superb with a nice breeze and stunning views. And for dinner just go one level down to the Indochina Restaurant with great local and international food (reservation is needed) - also outdoor seating is available. And definitely don't miss the music and light show after 8pm.
,,So Many Superlatives!,5.0,,"Incredible! Amazing! Astounding! Marvelous! I could go on and on with superlatives trying to describe these Supertrees, but it still wouldn't be enough!

We visited them first in the daytime and were awestruck. Then we went back for the evening show. Absolutely stupendemous! What an incredible creation! We also watched the light show from the top of the Marina Sands Hotel.

I would come back to Singapore just to see this again!"
,,So unique!,5.0,,Where else in the world do you get to walk amongst such imposing and beautiful structures? My tip is to go around 5.30pm so you get to see them in the daytime and then all lit up as the sun sets!
,,Amazing at nighttime,5.0,,"This is an experience not to miss. For 8 SGD per adult, the view throughout the Supertree Grove walkway is wonderful and amazing to behold.

The array of twinkling and colourful lights is mesmerising. The walkway itself is securely fixed and monitored by several members of staff. It is advisory to spend fifteen minutes up there, but the amount of photographic opportunities means you’ll be up there for longer!

The Light Show is also a great watch. Lying back on the grass and looking upward at the dancing lights is very reminiscent of the dancing fountains in front of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel."
,,An architectural marvel,5.0,,"The structures themselves are something to be wowed over. But there's also a walkway among these, which offers much more majestic views."
,,Cannot miss,5.0,,"Very impressive and night time is the time to see it at its best, the music and light show worth visiting, have good walking footwear it is warm and a lot of walking."
,,Even better at night,5.0,,"One of my favourite experiences to share when I have visitors (paired with a local hawker meal from Satay by the Bay). Get dinner and a beer or two then wander to Supertree Grove for the light show. Afterwards you can head up to the Indochine Supertree for a drink while the crowd dissipates, or head up to the top of Marina Bay Sands to see it from above."
,,Just beauitful,5.0,,"We loved the light up trees, a main highlight of out trip. Do come 15-20 prior to the light show to get a desired spot to sit."
,,INTERESTING AND FUNCTIONAL,4.0,,"Wandering here during a rain, it appeared that the trees could catch water if they were equipped with appropriate ""leaves"". So much to do here and within a short walking distance."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"We visited the Gardens by the Bay 3 times in the 7 days we were in Singapore. on one occasion we were able to be there at night for the dazzling light show that runs twice each evening and is free to all visitors. It was amazing. If you are able, take a blanket or towel and lay down to get the full perspective of what's going on above you. Absolutely loved it."
,,Supertree Grove: Man made wonder of the world.,5.0,,"Measuring between 25 and 50 metres tall, these are man-made tree-like structures. They are one of it's kind in the world and look magnificently beautiful.
Make a trip to the top of one of these iconic Supertrees and be awed by splendid views of the Gardens and the surrounding Marina Bay area. Or, stroll along OCBC Skyway, an aerial walkway that connects two of the Supertrees, and see the Gardens from a different point of view. Enjoy the light and music show to mesmerise yourself into a different world never seen and heard off.
Ideal time: Enter just before the sunset and experience the transition of day light to the beautiful night lit trees.
Tip: Buy the ticket for the OCBC Skyway before 8 P.M. (long queues)
Visit the Cloud forest first, followed by The Supertree Grove.
Be prepared to walk.
Water and food options available inside the premises.
The light show is interesting"
,,"""Avatar-esque"" supertrees",4.0,,There's a free light and sound performance at 7.45pm and 8.45pm daily. It is also a great way to pass time at night especially if you're in the marina bay area after an entire day of visiting the nearby attractions.
,,Awesome........,5.0,,A wonder... A real wonder.... Amazing experience to be there. Felt like I am in another planet out side our planet. Really gorgeous look during both day & night ....
,,"Beautiful giant trees and man made but with creepers, orchids and bromeliads",5.0,,"These huge man made artificial trees are now overgrown with air plants, bromeliads, creepers and orchids making them wonderful and beautiful.
Lights on the trees made beautiful sights as dusk sets. Music and a light show in the early evening made the scene a magical place"
,,Great evening event!,4.0,,"Loved seeing this light show - but it was very busy, we arrived by taxi from our hotel and the driver had a great deal of difficulty trying to park just to let us off! The light show itself was beautiful but we decided to leave before the end as we wanted to get back to the queue for taxis before all the crowds left the park at the same time! Well worth a visit."
,,Must see,5.0,,This is a must do in your time in Singapore! We got confused looking online for prices but it's free! It's free to walk around the garden and watch the evening light show. If you would like to go into the flower garden ect. this will cost. I really recommend the light show there is space for everyone to see and get good pictures.
,,Outdoor garden with excellent lighting,5.0,,I visited here at night. There are light show inside. Amazing. You can also ride the bridge. Excellent service
,,Mesmerising,5.0,,"When i visited Gardens By The Bay little did I know that the laser show at the SuperTree Grove would capture my imagination so much. A suggestion , do not take the aerial route and watch it from a higher level. Instead sleep on the floor and look at them as if a gazillion stars are shining. Go on a weekday to enjoy."
,,"Incredible light show, try and make it onto the walkway for the light show",5.0,,"Incredible light show, try and make it onto the walkway for the light show ! The light show took my breath away . One of the most amazing things I’ve ever seen. Remember Mossi spray I got bit a lot!"
,,Beautiful both day and night,5.0,,Buy a ticket for the Skywalk great views . At night there is a free light and sound show 7:15 and 8:45
,,lovely at evening,5.0,,be their at the show time in evening 6pm to 7.30 pm. its amazing . but walking is too much. best time is to go go by 6.30pm
,,Beautiful from a distance!,4.0,,"Supertree Grove is good to see from the long distance. After visiting Cloud Forest, we walked to Supertree. We spent about 30 minutes under Supertrees. The tree structures are unique. The structure bases are covered with plants. The good vista point is at the walkway to Marina Bay Sands."
,,Fantastic light show every evening,5.0,,"These artificial tree like things may look a bit odd, but are truly spectacular when you visit them. There is a walkway up high you can pay to walk on, but otherwise the gardens are free. We returned for the light show, it is twice every evening at 7.45 and 8.45. Again it is free. The light show and music apparently change every month. We saw Strauss waltzes in April In May it is Star Wars. I have rarely seen something so spectular. It lasts about 15 minutes. At the end there are cates and a Macdonalds near by, perfect for an ice cream in the tropical heat."
,,So cool!,4.0,,Such a unique thing to see. The super trees are such a cool idea and are surrounded by beautiful greenery. The view from the walkway is also wonderful. Not a ton to do though so you’ll only need an hour or so to wonder around.
,,A must-see & do in Singapore!,5.0,,"Ever since I first heard about the Supertree Grove I have wanted to pay it a visit and I'm sure glad I finally did on this occasion!

Although my partner was initially quite scared because of the height above the ground (and the walkway only consisting of transparent steel mesh), we felt safe at all times and were absolutely astounded by the view.

Although you have to pay, the Supertree Grove certainly something you must do when isiting Singapore."
,,A must see,5.0,,The sky walk is spectacular both at night and day. It give you a great aver all view of these amazing gardens
,,Chance discovert,5.0,,"We just happened to be walking through as dark fell and wondered why all these people were gathered, some lying on the ground to look up! Then the music started and a fabulous light show played amongst the ‘trees’. Was awesome"
,,Must Visit,5.0,,Its a must visit. Seeing the beautiful structures is just beautiful. The tickets are pretty cheap and its really a very good spot to view the Light show which happens around 8 pm
,,A fun activity,4.0,,"We enjoyed out visit to walk across the ""Supertrees"" in the Gardens by the Bay area. It was a pretty cheap activity - something different and a bit of fun. You get a great view of the surrounding gardens and also Marina Bay Sands Hotel nearby."
,,Amazing visit!,5.0,,I was amazed on the design and purpose of the these structures. I would recommend that all visitors make this place a top priority to visit.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Highly recommend doing this, it's not at all expensive and worth doing. The views are great, it's not the longest walkway I have been on but it's still worth it."
,,Awestruck,5.0,,These iconic tree like vertical gardens are designed with large canopies that provide shade in the day and a brilliant light and sound show in the night.
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,15 minutes of great show and an hour plus of wait for it. Words cant explain the spectacular show on display. And above all it comes free.
,,Sound and fury,3.0,,"Garden rhapsody is to be done as a part of cloud forest ,gardens by the bay ,marina shoppes, marina bay walk ,all of the above can be easily completed if one starts before 4 pm
Garden rhapsody light and music show as a part of the above is good but on its own is not exceptional
The lightning and music arrangement though good is not exactly spectacular
The display of lights after the 1st few minutes tends to get repetitive
Finish cloud forest and garden by the bay before the garden rhapsody and then follow it up by a visit to marina shoppes
Kids usually loose their patience after visiting gardens by the bay and cloud forest so moonlight show is the last nail in the coffin ,so shoppes is a a welcome break ..
Overall a pleasant though not a spectacular experience.."
,,Stunning surroundings,5.0,,Disabled friendly as wheel chairs can be hired for only a dollar and even the areal walkway is accessible
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Go at night but be aware ticket sales finish at 8pm. Lines can be quite long but you can be entertained by the light and music show while in line 7:45 and 8:45. you spend 15 mins on the skyway but if you don't like heights be aware that there can be some slight movement if windy. lovely way to finish your day.
,,Favorite thing in Singapore,5.0,,"If you're in Singapore, you can NOT miss this attraction. I suggest to go early to beat the heat, and make sure you visit the Cloud Forest. It truly is my favorite thing to do in Singapore."
,,Magic Place in Singapore,5.0,,"I enjoyed my stay in Garden by the Bay and climb to Supertree by stairs, was a good exercise. Walking in the platform it´s an amazing experience, taking pictures, the Lion dance during CNY. Don´t forget to walk in the gardens."
,,Part of gardens by the bay experience.,4.0,,So large when seen up close. Part of the gardens by the bay experience. Lit up at night. Walkway often closed due to adverse weather. Buy tickets in advance for huge savings.
,,Evening is the time,5.0,,Visit here in the evening. Free entry to gardens by the bay. All trees are lighted up and it looks amazing. Don't plan for the skyway as you may get an hour's queue. Truly looks like Pandora from avatar.
,,Enjoyable.,4.0,,"Beautiful sights - however after doing the flower dome and cloud garden I am not sure it was worth paying to walk across the ""bridge"" between the supertrees."
,,A Must at Night,4.0,,To really appreciate the beauty of this place you visit must be a night. Absolutely amazing and unique there is nothing like it anywhere else in the world
,,WoW,5.0,,"I thought the fountains at The Bellagio in Vegas were great, but this was amazing. Have to time it right to get the full experience on the treewalk and ground level"
,,Wheelchair access,5.0,,"I hurt fractured my ankle the week before our trip to Singapore. We hired a wheelchair privately but you can hire one in the sky garden. Access around the park was excellent, lifts and fast tracking in ques. We stayed for the light show, and there was a star wars themed light and music show on the night we were there, 4th May! Think it is on all month. Epic!"
,,You must visit twice,5.0,,"Yes, you need to see these during the day and also visit for at least one of the sound/light shows. These are on twice nightly at 7.45 and 8.45.

For our first of two evening visits we were there on the three day (night) run they had for Star Wars Day, May the fourth. .... so they were running the show with Star Wars movie music. The next night we caught the usual Waltzes show.

Both were magical.

Just laze back and enjoy the show"
,,My dream come true,5.0,,"This manmade spectacle, where nature and construction work hand in hand enchanted me even before I got a chance to see it. We were there for the evening light and music show, which was magical. I felt like I'm in Avatar movie set! During the day it got more realistic for me, but still pretty spectacular. I love how can humans work with nature and not just use it. I can't say that this was my favorite place, as Singapore has plenty of amazing places. But I would gladly go back here again and again. On the blog page, I wrote more detailed post about Gardens By the Bay and my reckless act in the excitement mode :) Feel free to check it out."
,,"Pretty unusual, and free!",5.0,,"Saw the super trees in the daytime first and then came back at night (glad we did). We paid for the walkway in the daytime which was great, quite scary if you're not good with heights though! Came back at night and it was even better, haven't seen anything like this before it was really impressive, and best of all, it's free! We missed the light show which sounds like a shame, will have to come back..."
,,Magical Star Wars light show,5.0,,Even if i have been to this place several times but this was my first time to watch the Light Show. It was 15 minutes of magic. They played a Star Wars special theme and I loved it so much. definitely will come back for this show.
,,WOW !! and just incredible VIEWS!!,5.0,,We absolutely loved the experience of the Supertree Grove and being able to walk high above during the light show. The views are incredible and so worth spending the extra money ... If you are scared of heights this is not for you!!
,,Facinating!,5.0,,These amazing structures need to be visiting both during the day and again at night for the light show!
,,Absolutely Majestic (+ Free Light Show),5.0,,"Singapore made trees more interesting. They're super trees. SUPER TREES. You really gonna just pass up on something called super trees?

Plus for expensive as Singapore can be, you can't pass up an opportunity for something free. Especially when it's one of the top attractions of the whole city-country. Even if you miss the show it's still trippy to see these electronic trees during the day time. On a less budget tip, the skywalk is $8. It was closed when I visited so I got to save myself the conflict of not wanting to spend $8 to walk among the heights with the supertrees. No worries, you can still get close enough at the base for good pictures. ;)"
,,Magic,5.0,,"Just has to be seen to be believed, the music is wonderful and light show entrancing. Not long enough though."
,,See the light show,4.0,,"The best (and free!) part is the evening light show, complete with musical soundtrack. That was well worth it."
,,GREAT VISIT. NEED A HEAD FOR HEIGHTS,5.0,,"The cost was about $Singapore8 per person for the skywalk which offers lovely views of the gardens, as well as the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. The walk is supposed to be one-way but we did a there and back."
,,Amazing free light and sound show - not to be missed,5.0,,Gardens by the Bay is a magical place that you must visit when you come to Singapore. In the night time the trees are lit up and a magnificent light and sound show is put on for free. There are different themes to the show - so check the Gardens by the Bay website before you visit to see what will be on. It's advisable to get there early to get a prime spot on the grass or one of the many benches under the trees. There are a number of restaurants close by too so you can squeeze in some supper beforehand too. Gardens by the Bay is close to the MBS hotel too - only a short walk away.
,,Go see at night,5.0,,The Supertree Grove is absolutely stunning during the day but especially at night. The light show is just amazing. Must see.
,,Never seen anything like it,5.0,,"This place is just magical. And the Disney-like lightshow every evening only helps the case! These trees are absolutely incredible. The design, architecture, construction, and visual appeal of them is amazing, and the sustainability and and energy they contribute to the city makes them even better. While it's touristy, I definitely recommend checking these out during dusk and then for the lightshow. I've honestly never seem anything like these trees."
,,"The garden it`s not just beautiful, it is useful.",5.0,,"The trees are beautiful colored in the night, you should pay to climb them, they are producing energy and they are keeping water for irrigating the garden. it`s the best one could do, being useful and amazing."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Stunning by day ,stunning by night,a mus,t visit by day wander around the gardens ,by night take in the wonderful display of lights and music"
,,Gorgeous construction,5.0,,"These trees are just incredible. Amazing design and construction, and the lighting show at night is not to be missed! Shows at 7.45 and 8.45pm."
,,Great,5.0,,"Quite a visual spectacular and free!!! Gardens surrounding are the river are lovely to walk around. The evening light show is fantastic, and again free. A must see place - daytime and nighttime."
,,nice big man made trees,4.0,,"nice big trees made by man
with plant on the trees look nice
at night still have the light and music show
must come and enjoy the night show here
also can pay to go up the tree and walk around in the sky
nice view from top of the trees also"
,,Light Show,5.0,,"These trees are unique and amazing to see up close. Part of the gardens by the bay, this Supertree grove is 1 of the highlights of my holiday. Besides the imposing giant Supertrees, there are 2 light shows (7:45 & 8:45) definitely worth experiencing. Probably nothing like this elsewhere in the world. 5/5"
,,"Amazing ""trees""",5.0,,Those spectacular Supertrees are amazing. The are covert with beautiful flowers from around the world. Great concept!!
,,Excellent sounds and light show,5.0,,Well worth an evening visit to experience the free sound and light show. Timings were absolutely perfect.
,,Visit at Night,5.0,,I saw the Supertree Grove at night and during the day. Definitely worth seeing at night during the light show when there is music and the lights are synched with the music. I like that the Supertree Grove are powered by solar which is in the canopy of these trees. Admission is free however it was quite crowded.
,,A Walk in the Trees,5.0,,"Although you can walk around the Supertree Grove for free, you have to pay an admission fee to walk on the Skyway. You enter via elevator and walk in one direction to the opposite end for the elevator down. It's an interesting thing to do for a few minutes while you meandering around the Gardens By The Bay.
The wow factor for the Supertree Grove happens at night! That is when you will be amazed at the light show. There are two shows. The best vantage point is from the elevated walkway that we accessed from the Marina Bay Sands."
,,AMAZING,5.0,,"Super feat of engineering set in immaculate gardens so many things to see you need at least a day with the skywalk the different gardens from all over the world and the flower domes.
If anything it was even better at night when the super trees were lit up with a great light and music show at 7.45 and 8.45 don't miss them they were something else"
,,Amazing light show,5.0,,"If you get the chance you must go to the light show, it's truly amazing. And more amazing we didn't have to pay, entry was free."
,,Modern but awesome,5.0,,"All free to view, including the nightly sound and light show, a brilliant structure supporting the wider gardens and Cloud Dome experiences"
,,BEAUTIFUL LIGHT DESPLAY,5.0,,Supertree Grove was beautiful to see during the day also at night when they have the light rhapsody show it takes your breath away. I wish I had a camera for night photography.
,,Very nice and high trees,5.0,,"After visiting Merlion park, we took taxi to visit Supertree Grove. You must buy entrance fee to go higher. There are some high trees and look amazing, staff was friend to show places to visit there and it is not quite far from MRT. Only some walks then you can take MRT back to central..."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"Theses trees are amazing and beautiful. I want to come back in a few years to see how the vegetation has grown in. Well worth a visit, especially at night."
,,Stunning and one of a kind,5.0,,These trees are unique and amazing to see up close. At night they have a light and sound show that shouldn't be missed. To see the trees is free but there is a charge to walk along an elevated path through the trees. In my opinion this is not worth the cost.
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,They have 2 light shows nightly. Each show last about 15- 20 minutes. very good sound system for a open space
,,Go after dark !!!!,5.0,,I can't believe the Singaporeans give the lightshow free every night. Try getting there about a half an hour early to get a better spot to watch. You can follow the crowd after towards the MRT.. about a 10 minute walk...
,,Super SuperTrees,5.0,,"These trees are amazing, definitely watch the light show (is on every evening) and do the tree top walk. Best thing in Singapore"
,,Very cool!,4.0,,A very cool and unique consept. The light show with the music was lovely and romantic! I would definitely visit again!
,,Futuristic... remarkable... beautiful,5.0,,"This is just amazing. Like the amazing Cloud Forest & Flower Dome, the audacity of even dreaming up the Supertree Grove, never mind securing the funding astounds me. As usual in Singapore, there's plenty to eat in the food centre, plenty of benches where you can rest & drink in the astounding Supertrees... and there's a plethora of sculptures worth seeking out & photographing. Giant dragonflies & humongous birds anyone? Free admission to wander around and gawk... or you can pay a reasonable sum ($15?) & walk along the elevated walkway."
,,Garden Rhapsody (Free light & sound show),5.0,,We entered Gardens by the bay by walking through Marina bay sands. We wanted to get to the Supertree grove for the 19.45 garden Rhapsody show. There were many people strolling around the park on a Saturday night. Terrific show.
,,Out of this world,5.0,,"When looking at these super trees from a distance they already look impressive, when you get closer they are even more impressive. The forest of super trees is mind blowing, everyone just stands there and says wow, feels a bit from Avatar. Great picture taking opportunity. No matter which direction you look, at night time it is simply spectacular. A must visit in Singapore after dark."
,,Enchanting!,5.0,,"This is just as beautiful up close as it looks in the pictures! We spent almost an entire day in and around this place, looks brilliant in the evenings after the trees lit up. Almost a postcard from another planet, these lit up trees... If you have the time, would advise just lying down to watch these trees up and changing colors in the evening lights. Fabulous and memorable experience"
,,Fantastic,4.0,,Super Grove needs to be visiting at night the get the full effect of the lighting it’s a marvel what they done with theses concrete structures as they serve an ecological purpose
,,Other planet!,5.0,,"Big beautifull tree like from other planet. Skywalk beetwen threesnis magnificient. By night, three change colour with music, this is awesome."
,,Light show at night,4.0,,I had no idea and was so pleasantly surprised to see the light show. It was fun and very beautiful. A must see in Singapore!
,,Absolute marvel,5.0,,These trees are amazing. I've seen them a number of times and the nightly light shows are a must see. Music and light show plus the tree top walk. There are plenty of eating places here. I recommend you sit on the lawn to watch the show. Goes for about 20 mins.
,,Lovely supertrees,4.0,,"The supertrees are free to public and even better at night,catch 7.45 or 8.45 light shows which are free to general public to watch"
,,"Book before you go, The queues are enormous. 50 mins wait on the day we were there.You really don't wait to be standing",4.0,,Its quite amazing to look at from the ground. the plants are just growing up the structures so the look will change over time. See them lit up at night too.
,,A dream at the night show,5.0,,"The music, the lights, the combination gives a dream show. fantastic to see and just relax and the benches. Fantastic."
,,Impressive,4.0,,Impressive is the word to describe most of the attractions in the Marine Bay in Singapore. The Supertree Grove might be one of the most famous. Great photo opportunity for your Instagram or if you are a DSLR/tripod kind of person.
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,I have a great fear of highest but some how was persuaded to go to the Supertree Grove and I have absolutely no regrets. Whilst it might seem extremely high up the views are absolutely breathe taking and I would recommend this to everyone.
,,Spectacular view,1.0,,This is a must for everyone who go yo singapore especially at night it's just spectacular. THE government doing so much for the development of the country .A big congratulation.
,,Make sure you see it both night and day!,5.0,,Always guaranteed great photos here. At 7:45pm every night they have a gorgeous light and music show in the grove. A must do when in Singapore. And enjoy the view of the Marina Sands as a backdrop.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"We visited during the day and in the evening. The daytime visit was great, but the evening visit was amazing. The light and music show was truly wonderful. We were going on the Skywalk but we were warned that a storm was expected, and that there would be no refund if we had to leave, so we didn't go."
,,Huge and beautiful,5.0,,These structures are huge and almost unbelievable. Great to see in the sun and then later once it gets dark when they are beautifully lit.
,,Day and Night Visit,4.0,,"Whilst I felt that this was very nice during the day I was a little disappointed at the night show of light and music.
This is a great place to go during the day even if you have children as there is a play area for kids where they can have a lovely time playing on the play equipment or in the water feature while mum and dad can watch and have a rest. The day we went it was very hot but it was still enjoyabe. If you go with children make sure you take their bathers so they can enjoy water feature, We also went back in the night to see light show this was ok but I would not say that you need to do it."
,,Night beauty,5.0,,"The supertree grove is nice for an evening walk, as night falls it comes alive with lights making it really spectacular to see, the tallest tree has a restaurant and bar located at the top."
,,Light Show,5.0,,"Light Show was great in the evening for 15 minutes, Show is at 7.45 & 8.45, It went very well. We didn't go to Sky walk and we sat below one of the tree, From there we had a great view"
,,Amazing.,5.0,,The nightly light show was really cool. We were hoping to be on the sky walk but the queue was massive. Still awesome views from the ground. 5 min walk from MRT station.
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"We visited during the day and also walked along the sky walk, the trees are incredible. The evening light and music show was great. It was fun wondering where to look next as the lights continually changed colour and flicked on and off. Loved it."
,,Supertree light show is outstanding,5.0,,"We saw the Supertrees during the day which is great to see in itself but at night, you’d be hard pressed to have seen anything like this before. There’s a light show to music at 7.45 and 8.45 pm. Get there in plenty of time to get a good seat/place to lay down to watch the show. Changing colours, fairy lights, scaffolding lights all synced with the music. Absolutely amazing. So well done. We will go back to watch it from the board walk $8 person in a night or so. Board walk open until 9.00 but last ticket sale at 8.00 so just missed it. Highly recommend the light show, beautiful sight."
,,nice,4.0,,"visited supertee at night to see the light show. it was beautiful, but i think it’s more suitable for children. overall nice experience."
,,Amazng,5.0,,Very beautiful at night with a sound and light show. The gardens surrounding are beautiful. Nice place for a stroll.
,,Ok but would be better,4.0,,"I paid $20 to go up to the top of the tree for a drink only (food not sampled) and found the wine was a little mediocre and a small size for what you pay for. Yes, I understand its the view you also pay for but I would of liked a larger glass of wine for my $20 (half full). I was advised that it was only an hour time limit but no one came to check and staff seemed happy for people to relax."
,,Supertree amazing...must see.,5.0,,"This was part of our Singapore Night Out tour with RMG....well worth it.
The nightly light and sound show at 7.45pm is quite spectacular and a sight to see. Can be very crowded but still plenty of room to see the amazing SuperTree Grove light up and come alive with the music."
,,"Magnum sizes, magical at night",5.0,,"Eighteen inverted umbrella like concrete structures with 25-50 meters height assembled in three clusters of 12, 3 and 3 in gardens by the bay are visible from distant points of the city. They are encased in steel frames and photovoltaic cells for harnessing solar energy which in turn are covered with green natural foliage and flowers. Few super trees are connected through a skywalk at a height of 25 meters. Visitors can enjoy the panoramic view of surrounding areas on reaching skywalk platform by elevator. The tallest tree has a restaurant on the top. Evening lights create magical moments which are equally enjoyable from close as well as distant points."
,,What you visit Singapore for,5.0,,Highlight of our trip just amazing and it’s all free unless you want to do the skywalk which I wo7ld recomend
,,manmade marvel in SG,5.0,,in a lot of tourist brochure. Nice to see at least once. Make sure go when weather is not too hot. nice view at evening time
,,FANTASTIC,5.0,,"Wow what can I say, the Supertree Grove light show is fantastic not to be missed. Probably go over to the trees about 1/2 hour before the light show, like everyone else lay on the warm concrete look up and enjoy the amazing light show."
,,Superb,4.0,,This is an amazing area and a superb spot for a some great photos. On this occasion we were there in the daylight hours but they are magnificent during the night when they are lit up. Lots to see and do. Worth a visit
,,Night Visit is Worthwhile,5.0,,"You need to go here in the evening, when they put on the light show. It is one of the experiences of Singapore and well worth the effort. You can always then fill your boots in the Marina Sands shopping centre, which makes the UK facilities look like entrance lobbies."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The grove looks fantastic by day, but when the night show is on it is unbelieveable. Do not miss the 2 evening shows at 7.45 and 8.45."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Such a wonderful experience, and for free! We called in here and the juxtaposition of natural and man made was simply wonderful. We headed up to the rooftop bar in the tallest of the supertrees and can heartily recommend both the beer and the view available from there. Definitely one not to miss if in Singapore."
,,Supertree skywalk was amazing,4.0,,go there with your walking shoes on....quite well maintained...can easily take 3-4 hours. the Skywalk had some great view.
,,something special indeed...,4.0,,"First of all take the stairs up! When up, you'll be rewarded with some breathtaking views of the Gardens and the Singapore Anchorage, were you'll see plenty of ships 'waiting'"
,,Stunning,5.0,,Don't miss this - get there before 7pm. Wander around for a while until the display and music starts. Make sure you have plenty of battery power in you phone or camera. Before nightfall photos are just as breathtaking as evening ones.
,,Come in the evening,5.0,,"You can't miss the supertree grove when you walk into Gardens by the Bay, and it's also a popular meeting spot for visitors. To really enjoy your supertree grove experience though, you need to visit around 7pm, as that's when the area lights up - literally!
The Garden Rhapsody is a daily show that runs at 7:45 and 8:45pm, and this sounds a little odd but it's best enjoyed by you laying down on the ground if the ground is dry. Don't fret too much about getting your clothes dirty on the ground, and I promise you the experience is so much better."
,,Fantastic trees,5.0,,Amazing trees with plants growing up them. Great views from the walkway between them. The centre tree which is the tallest has a bar and restaurant. You can buy a drink inclusive ticket for the bar which is worth it for the amazing view from the top deck. Also a must to visit at night for the light show.
,,Nice experience,5.0,,Loved this place. Would be better to visit in the second half of the day so that you get to see the lighted view little later.
,,Incredible,5.0,,This is one of the most incredible man-made places I have seen. Do not miss the sound and light show that takes place twice a night at 7.45pm and 8.45 pm. It is something to behold and if you don't time your visit with a show you have definitely missed out. There are good quality and not too expensive restaurants that wrap around one edge of the Supertree Grove and these are great for an easy dinner while waiting for the show time. Thoroughly recommended!
,,Not hugely impressive by day,3.0,,I expect the views at night as the park is lit up is more impressive than the view in daylight. I was expecting much more to be honest as the photos I have seen of the park are beautiful but most were taken at dusk or evening. Nice to see and walk through wonderful gardens however.
,,Amazing Sound and Light Show,5.0,,"The view in night is much better than the daytime. Be sure to check the schedule of the Light show at night. Don't miss the opportunity, this is free but if you want a better view buy ticket for the OCBC Skyway."
,,Great light show,5.0,,I was taken to the nightly light show by some locals when visiting Singapore. It was definitely worth it a unique experience.
,,One of the most amazing places you will ever see!,5.0,,"The supertrees are incredible!! They are like nothing i have ever seen before, and set in a picturesque location! The skyway between the trees is a must do- with one of the best views and best photo oppurtunities in the city! Also make sure you stick around in the evening for the light show- Just incredible!!"
,,Nice place to walk around!,5.0,,These supertrees are so cool! I walked around the gardens during the day. Then came back at night to watch the light show with music. Then walked through the gardens at 1 am all by myself (very safe too).
,,"Beautiful technology, day and night",5.0,,"Supertree Grove is found in the Gardens by the Bay area, near Marina Bay Sands. As with everything in Singapore the signposts are great and it’s easy to find your way around.
Entry to the Gardens is free and you can stand and wonder at these artificial trees for absolutely nothing. There is a wealth of information available on the boards around the trees and it’s then that you realise that this is not just a tourist attraction but that the technology and the creativity behind these wonders is staggering. The trees catch the sunlight and convert it to electricity, enabling the whole area to be powered as well as the watering system for all the plants. It is truly amazing.
Visitors can buy a ticket (SGD 8 per adult) to go up to the Skywalk - a walkway between the trees, 22m high. It’s a lovely thing to do and the views are great. If it’s busy then the guides do move you along up on the walkway but we were fortunate that it was relatively quiet when we went up.
If you can, do return in the evening for the free Supertree Grove lightshow (this is different to the Marina Bay lightshow). Check in advance for times but when we were there it was 7.45pm and 8.45pm. The current show is called A World of Fantasy and is truly amazing. We were mesmerised by the mix of inspiring music and fantastic lighting wizardry. I had tears rolling down my face - it was so moving.
Supertree Grove - another example of Singaporean creativity and awesomeness!"
,,Beautiful! Stay for the light show!,5.0,,"Clean, spotlessly clean, bright, and beautiful, but when the lights come on it’s magical. Rows of beautiful trees and glorious gardens, music, lights, dreams are made of this. Grab a cocktail and savor the unceasing beauty."
,,High tech light and sound,3.0,,"The Supertree Grove is a set of artificial ""trees"" located in (and included in the admission to) Singapore's Gardens by the Bay. Every evening there are two light and sound shows where the structures light up in colors changing to the music. It's a cool concept, but after a few minutes it was just more of the same. Fireworks are a lot more interesting."
,,A must see,5.0,,"Sorry we didn't have longer to spend at Supertree Grove and the surrounding gardens. Arrived in time for the evening light show which was wonderful.
Paid to go up to the bar for a small glass of beer. Overpriced, service poor but views are spectacular. Glad to have done it but wouldn't go up there again."
,,Be amazed,5.0,,"The architecture throughout Singapore is amazing and these ""supertrees"" are no exception. We didn't get back to see them at night but I would love to."
,,Night Visit,4.0,,We walked through this grove in the evening and it was a pleasant experience. you feel safe of a night here as the Singapore families visit of a night
,,All reviews say the same,5.0,,All reviews say the same and that is this place is truely magical. At 7:15 and 8:15pm the light and music show is a must see.
,,Must see at night,4.0,,a great music and late show that runs twice a night go the later and it's cooler at night. if you can take a blanket or you'll be laying on the grass or pavement
,,What a unique place in the heart of the gardens,5.0,,This area is very impressive and even more at night when lit up. There is a light show twice a night to music which is as good to see. The centre tree has a restaurant but best to book for access.
,,Probably the first thing you must see in Singapore,5.0,,"Seeing the Supertree Groves was one of the things I was most looking forward to during my visit in Singapore and it did not disappoint. I didn't get a chance to see them at night, but it's surely amazing also. Access to the park to see them is also free! How great is that!"
,,Relaxing Visit,5.0,,"After spending a fabulous evening at the Gardens by the Bay, to walk across the Supertrees was really special as by the evening the lights came on and the area looked beautiful. Kids had a wonderful experience and thought that the Super trees were from out of space."
,,AMAZING!!,5.0,,Absolutely beautiful! Fantastic light and sound show - worth waiting for definitely. Best of all - it was FREE!!! Great job Singapore gov!
,,Unusual,4.0,,A must see to walk along and look at the supertrees. We didn't get to actually walk on the skywalk due to bad weather but they are fascinating.
,,A must in SG,5.0,,Like being in Avatar and I've not even seen the film! A unique attraction that must be done including the skywalk.
,,Wonderful place at dusk a must see in Singapore,5.0,,"We were keen to go to the Supertree Grove and experience what was a beautiful light show, music and relaxation themed gardens. We went up the Supertree to the bar, paid entry £10 each. Was totally worth it, we sat and had drinks watching the sun go down having a few nibbles. Our child was with us. Just before 8pm, we went down to see the trees light up and music playing. People were lying on the grass, submerged in the atmosphere and ambience. I definitely would say go, stay a couple of hours and embrace what this place has to offer."
,,DO NOT MISS the Supertree Sound and Light Show!,5.0,,"Fantastic! Admission is free and it's open 5am-2am daily. These are spectacular vertical gardens designed to look like trees 25-50 meters tall, with a light and sound show at night. The light show is put on at 7:45 & 8:45pm daily, but check the website for Gardens by the Bay to make sure those hours don't change.
The night we were there the music had a Moon theme. Music from around the world, each song with something to do with the moon, was played and the light show on the supertrees was synced to it. It was absolutely spectacular."
,,Less about up close,3.0,,"These are certainly a unique feature, but possibly better experienced from a distance or at night during the light shows. Skywalk nice, but not really high enough to see particularly far and a bit uncomfortable given the skywalk moves. A nice food court with sit down dining nearby, however."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"A sight to behold during the day and the must see light show. It’s such a special place and one I’ve never seen before. Please visit if in Singapore, you won’t regret it."
,,do not miss the light show,5.0,,This unique project shows how the city of future should look like. Do not miss the light show which starts (probably everyday) at 8pm. Spectacular!
,,Highly recommend,4.0,,Fantastic experince and highly recommend getting there for the light show at night. Allow about 20 min to get a good spot. I think they have two shows nightly.
,,Area in Gardens by the bay,5.0,,This is one of the areas (gardens) in gardens by the bay. the light and sound show is conducted in these trees. Its a nice photo shoot place. We enjoyed watching these trees and they look huge when you look up at them.
,,"Nice, relaxing and beautiful.",4.0,,I went there on an afternoon and expected a lot of people but there was a little amount of people there and the view is very pretty. Recommend going at night when the lights are turned on and they're really pretty and worth it!
,,Great to spend afternoons...,4.0,,"Me and my husband had a marvelous afternoon at the Supertree Grove watching Garden Rhapsody, lying on our backs. Music was vivid, so as the lights. A must visit in Singapore. Make sure you catch the show. And whats great...its TOTALLY free.."
,,"Recommend day and night visits, completely different worlds",5.0,,"San Francisco has the Golden Gate Bridge, Seattle the Space Needle, Taipei the 101 and Singapore quite possibly the most spectacular backdrop in daytime and dark. If you find yourself visiting Singapore, my wife and I would highly recommend day and night visits to the Supertree Grove. (1) It's free, at ground level (2) Stunning backdrop to the Marina Bay Sands and (3) the night show is twice everyday, perfect for timing with the Sands light show.

We paid $6 USD for each adult to walk the OCBC skywalk, absolutely worth it. If you can, visit on a weekday between 11A-3P to see Gardens by the Bay and Supertree Grove with minimal crowds. Our visit coincided with the Chinese New Year, crowds at these times were never an issue. There is a time limit and you'll be kindly moved along if you linger, but we had plenty of time and space to stroll about. The light shows are 7:45P and 8:45P. Arrive at least 20 minutes early if you want a decent view. We went two nights in a row, the first arriving with 10 minutes to opening music and seating was limited to the entrance stairs. Still an amazing show...but on night two we arrived almost 30 minutes early and were perfectly situated under one of the trees. It was pure magic. If you attend the 7:45P, grab coffee and gelato before headed to the Sands light show. This was an excellent way to end our evening before walking back to Pan Pacific Singapore.

We have been fortunate to travel for 10 years. This was one of the best experiences we have ever seen on vacation. Amazing."
,,"Nice serene place to visit, and it's free",4.0,,These trees are nicely situated closed by the water and great to visit both during the day and at night time. Plenty of seating spaces and cool to just lay down on one of the benches encircling the trees and just look up into the greenery.
,,Very nice view,5.0,,"It’s definitely worth a trip. Nice view over the city, the Harbour and the trees. Also, 8 SGD is affordable."
,,Spectacular at night!,5.0,,Really nice area to walk around and enjoy the scenery but definitely be there by 7:30pm as the light show starts at 7:45. Truly spectacular to see them light these trees in so many ways.
,,Nice place,4.0,,This is a nice place with interesting twist on trees! Beautifully landscaped and some interesting plants. We thought the sky walk was a bit pricey for what it is and decided not to take it - you don't have to. You can still walk around there is no entry fee for the rest of whats there.
,,Giant tree,5.0,,"I came here around 6pm, because I intend to watch light show at 7pm. The show called Super tree Raphsody. Great show with light and music for 15 minutes. Take MRT Bayfront if yo wish to go here by train."
,,Unique Phenomenon,4.0,,"Although this project it human made it is a unique one.
The one hour show begins every night at 19:45. You lie on you back and watch audiovisual show. I am not femilliar with such show anywhere else.
Later go to the nearby Water-Light show -Spectra.
Free of charge."
,,One word to describe beautiful,5.0,,Beautiful and Modern and clean.A lot of plants and restaurants here. I like the sculpture and you are able to rent e-scooter and bicycle here.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"The structures are beautiful both day and night. So majestic and wonderfully designed. The lighting at night gives them an entirely different look, just as beautiful."
,,light show,5.0,,we went only to see the light show of it and it was nice and colorful and fantastic light show we couldn't visit the OCBT sky walk next time we will visit it
,,A light show to dazzle.,5.0,,"Be sure to be here in the evening, get there early and sample some of the offerings from numerous restaurants. The light show is well worth seeing and there are spectacular photographic opportunities. Enjoyable activity for the whole family."
,,Must see at night!!!,5.0,,"As recommended by our taxi driver, we went there at 5 PM and stayed till dark to experience the park during daylight and nightime. Great experience. The light show was amazing and a must see!!!"
,,Be sure to go there at night,3.0,,"This place is at its best in the evening. Ok light show, but what I liked most, was a great photo exhibition with pictures from the northern parts of europe, asia and canada."
,,Great Place to Visit,5.0,,Visit this place with the view of marina bay sand hotel. You can capture here evening light show. To visit ramp you need to pay S$8 for top view. It also have Bar and roof top restaurant.
,,It's nice to get above the gardens,4.0,,"You don't have to do this, but it was a nice walk above the gardens area. The walk was easy to do and we could take a pram up there as well, staff are great at getting up and down the lifts."
,,Night light show,5.0,,"Part of the gardens by the bay, this supertree grove is 1 of the highlights. Besides the imposing giant supertrees, there are 2 light shows (745 and 845) worth experiencing. Probably nothing like this elsewhere in the world

Try to catch the may 4-6 star wars theme if you can"
,,Visual Wonder,5.0,,Supertree Grove is a standout visual attraction which is no doubt the subject of 1000's of photos. The colour and architecture is very nice to look at both from close up and afar. Well worth a closer inspection.
,,"A must visit at night, Absolutely spectacular",5.0,,"This is well worth visiting during the day but at night, wow, it is something special and well worth the trip to the Marina.
However, if you want a drink at the restaurant at the top be prepared to pay S$20 per person to go up and then buy an expensive drink, we decided not to do it as it was too dear in our opinion. Other than that it is a very nice place to go."
,,Brilliant for all ages.,5.0,,After seeing so many pictures of these amazing trees it was fantastic to get up close. The walk between the trees is fairly short but well worth it. The best time to see the trees is a night though. There are two free light shows every night at 7.45pm and 8.45pm. Crowds can be big so make sure you get a good spot early.
,,Just excellent,5.0,,"What more can you say, this show at night is stunning and so well worked to the music. A definite must on your visit to Singapore"
,,Major attraction of Singapore,5.0,,"If you are coming to Singapore ,you should go to Supertree Grove. Near to Gardens by the bay,it is a major attraction of Singapore and I had a wonderful experience there"
,,do not miss it,5.0,,you need to go this free show every night at 7.45pm and 8.45pm it is a unique show that you cannot see or find anywhere else
,,Stunning,5.0,,"These trees are impressive during the day, but at night they are at their best. It's free to walk round. Stay for the light show. It's brilliant. My favourite place in Singapore."
,,Spectacular as expected!,4.0,,"The evening Garden Rhapsody was on my list of things to see during our short stay in Singapore and I was not disappointed.

Starting at 1945 and finishing some 15 mins later it was a spectacular sight (and sound).

The walk through the gardens to and from at night is very enjoyable too.

A must whilst in the city, a great atmosphere for adults, children and families."
,,I loved this,5.0,,"This is a place to go in the evening, walk click pictures and relax and feel happy that you are in Singapore."
,,Can't believe these are made of recycled materials,5.0,,"Wonderful structure, and free light and sound show every night, wear comfortable shoes and clothes as it will require lots of walking and its a bit humid, don't forget to take your camera"
,,Trees with vision,5.0,,Super tree Grove amidst the Gardens by the bay is a major attraction and has a free entry if one doesnt visit the domes.. the light and sound show is excellent and starts in the evening at 7.45.pm..There is a OCBC 128 metre sky walk that connects super trees and super grove dining option too all at a price . Trees are tall at 50 metres and around 200 species of plants or climbets or ferns are grown on it ..
,,Brilliant,5.0,,We went for a walk through the park at sunset and climbed the walkway as the sun was going down and the lights were going on. you get a fantastic view and some great photos. It can feed a bit crowded but take your time.
,,The tress of the Gardens by The Bay are a show apart,5.0,,"The artificial trees of the Gardens by The Bay are a show apart.Please note for an evening visit at the bar and restaurant of the largest tree complex in the area, which is approximately 15 stories high.When walking through these trees at night you feel inside the movie ""Avatar""."
,,Recommend,4.0,,"My partner and I visited Super Trees at night. I wasnt expecting much and had low expectations, but they are incredible. The trees are really something. They were all lit up and it was a pleasure to walk aound and take it all in.
A really nice, clean and safe environment. Would recommend... beautiful"
,,Impressive,4.0,,These super tress have super view especially in the night lights.We couldn't reach up due to rain but we see it from down.A must see attraction.
,,Great Light show!,5.0,,"If you get the chance, stick around in Supertree Grove after sunset to see the Light Show... AMAZING!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,The walk through this grove is a must when visiting Gardens by the Bay. Make your visit in the afternoon and stay on for the light show as it is really something.
,,Sound and light show,5.0,,After an afternoon at Gardens by the Bay we had an early dinner nearby and then attended the Sound and Light show at Supertree Grove. Popular and enjoyable.
,,Magical and emotional experience,5.0,,"Perhaps it's because I've always liked bright coloured lights but this took me to another world! The combination of giant, man-made structures, covered in natural plants and twinkling coloured lights is entrancing. The Supertrees are interesting and impressive in daylight but as day turns to dusk and to night they come alive and it seems that everyone in the area falls silent and under the spell of the light and music show. We actually went twice during our stay and would gladly go here again if visiting Singapore in the future...and it is free! I challenge any other attraction to cast such a child-like innocence over as many adults as the light show at The Supertree Grove. Loved it and highly recommend it."
,,Loved the light show,5.0,,"All of gardens by the bay was impressive, but our favourite was definitely the supertrees lit up at night - don't miss the light show, but be prepared for crowds!"
,,Will be even more spectacular when the vines reach the top,5.0,,It is quite something to see. The Vines are presently about halfway up but when they reach the top it'll even be more spectacular. We did the Skywalk and the views from up there are magnificent. They tried to limit you to 15 minutes on the Skywalk only because it can only hold 70 people. One of the super trees has a restaurant on the top but there is a $20 charge to go up which does include one beer.
,,Do not miss this!,5.0,,"Simply stunning - a must see if you are in Singapore. Go in time to catch the light & music show, twice a night. Highly recommended for all ages."
,,Interesting and innovative!,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is great to wander in. The trees are magnificent, particularly at night when they are lit up."
,,Fantastic!,4.0,,I was so excited to see the super trees at night. It's so beautiful & there's a light show at 7.45p.m & 8.30 or 8.45.
,,Loved it. Take the elevator up and walk the path,5.0,,We bought the extra ticket to go up and see the views from on top of the Supertree Grove. Excellent view of the park and surrounding sights.
,,"Absolutely a must visit, fantastic and so emotive.",5.0,,"Love it!! what can i say , the spectacle of lights ,music and being on the sky walkway around the trees as it was going on was amazing.also it`s free!!"
,,Go and see this place.,5.0,,"This a worth a visit at both day and night. We went in the day and also walked across the bridge between 2 of the trees. This was good fun and was good to get up high.
But at night is spectacular, they offer 2 light shows per night (same show all the time), which are very good. For me on par (although slightly different) to the Bellagio and Dubai fountains. I know you'll want photos to remember this but sit back and actually watch the lights with your eyes instead of through a phone screen, its great!! lights perfectly timed to music! It does get busy and we found it around a 1 minute walk from Bayfront MRT station but well worth it."
,,Green view towards urban monuments,4.0,,The courtyard is very nicely arranged with tree like structures and covered with greenery. Cultural events are held in the evening at the court yard and a tree top walking facilitates the tourists to walk through a pathway from one tree-like structures to another enjoying a marvelous feel of the city from top and closeness to the nature.
,,Superb,4.0,,"A part of the gardens by the bay,but a little seperate. Many tree groves there. An excellent light & sound show happens in d evening. There's a walkway at a height which had a ticket & a timing...there was a huge queue when we went."
,,Great to visit at night,5.0,,Go at night... see the lightshow - around 8pm ish. During the day little to see except the tree walk is very worthwhile
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Go see this at night, the light show is wonderful and there are a number of places to eat close by so you don't have to travel too far."
,,stay for the light show,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is impressive on its own, but at night the lights and music truly transform this space into something magical. Worth the wait."
,,Clever Idea,5.0,,We first saw the trees lit up at night on our way from the airport and determined to discover them by day. What an amazing idea! Plants climbed up the artificial trunks and flowers added colour and interest. The Skywalk is well worth the entrance fee for the views over the gardens and the city.
,,One of the highlights,5.0,,Definitely time your visit for when the light show is on. There are displays twice a night. Great photo opportunities.
,,"Large, huge, amazing trees",4.0,,Singapore is really creating something out of nothing. The trees are amazing and I recommend taking the skywalk between them. Good place for selfies.
,,Superb Supertree Grove,5.0,,"We visited the Supertree Grove, age of us ranging from just over 2 years old up to 55 years old.
Needless to say we all had a good time, beyond expectations for some of us.
Even in daylight the Supertrees are a sight to see. The design and making of each tree is remarkable and something we had never seen before.
In the night the gigantic metal trees come ""alive"" when different lights and shades illuminate and shade their flowers and greenery.
We recommend doing the OCBC walkway between the Supertrees, especially in the night during the lights-and-sound-show. Visitors are expected to take only 15 minutes doing the walk but it is hard not to dwell longer and admire the show.
Even those who do not, for any reason, do the walkway can really enjoy the show staying on the grounds below, like a lot of people did this night.
A place worth visiting with family and friends!"
,,If you only have time for one light show it should be this one,5.0,,"This light show was brilliant. Lights are perfectly synchronised to the music. Lasts about 15 mins and starts at 7.45 pm. We timed it perfectly that we caught the show after coming out of gardens by the bay. It's free but,you won't managed to catch the 8 pm light show at marina bay sands as you are on the wrong side. Well worth paying 20 dollars to get a drink in the bar before or after the show"
,,Highlight of our visit!,5.0,,"The supertrees are like something from a science fiction novel! Definitely do the walkway - it doesn't take long, but the views are amazing and you get to see the supertrees from a whole new angle."
,,Science and technology has matched and maybe improved the beauty of nature,5.0,,"I'm not sure if there are a more compelling and visually stunning 12 set of 'tree's' anywhere else in the world. Supertree Grove has 12 and although an impressive and iconic sight during the day, they come into their own at night. The lights start to flicker just before 8.45 and as the sun goes down an amazing sound and light show appears. There are many vantage points but I found positioning myself under the arc of the so called 'OCBC' walkway allowed me to get some outstanding pictures. Also provided some shade from a few showers that passed by. The visuals are awesome but lets not forget these are carefully managed vertical plant gardens with over a mind boggling 16000 plants from all over the world. What an architectural triumph and of course a night time must see."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,Gigantic metal trees with amazing greenery & flowers. This is a great site to see & can be done when visiting the Gardens by the Bay. The orchids were great but the pink hibiscus was most showy.
,,Highlight of our trip,5.0,,"This place is amazing a must for any trip to Singapore.You must see this by night and you will not believe what they have done,with lighting and sound a beautiful place."
,,Amazing,4.0,,The super trees are definitely a place to visit. Lovely by day and a fantastic light show in the evening. Loved our visit.
,,beautiful but hot,4.0,,nice grounds to walk around but after a little while the heat becomes just a bit to much. The night lights on the trees are beautiful
,,"Interesting, but too hot during the day",3.0,,"The Supergrove has a whimsical feel to it, fitting for Singapore. During the day, it's simply too hot though. Either go early in the morning or around dusk."
,,must go place,4.0,,"must go place. best time to go their at night for lighting. just beside, gardens by the bay and cloud forest situated. we gone their at day time but saw it from marina bay at night"
,,"A unique walk, if only for a few minutes",4.0,,"This is the kind of attraction you have to say you've done if you are in Singapore because it is so unique. The downside is that the line can be long so there is a wait, and only about 100 people can be on the walk at any time. Consequently, you are quietly but firmly encouraged to keep moving along the walkway and not allowed to dally until you get to the far end. It will take about 10 minutes from start to finish once you get to the top."
,,Interesting.,5.0,,These man made trees are awesome. They are eco friendly and when it rains the water is collected and recycled.
,,Magical Garden Light Show Not to Be Missed,5.0,,"I find the Supertree grove to be the one of the most amazing and beautiful places I've ever seen. They fascinate me---man-made trees with bougainvillea training up the sides 16 stories tall.

As unbelievable as the trees are in the daytime, they are even more spectacular at night. An absolute must-do in when visiting Singapore is to take in the light show every night at 7:45 or 8:45, when the twinkle-lights blink and change color to a tribute to the music of Asia. There are well-loved tunes from almost every country, and you can hear different visitors singing along, depending on where they're from. I'm from the US and of a certain age, and was stunned to hear a Japanese song that was all over the radio during my childhood.

It takes a minute to get to the grove, mostly because there's no path that goes straight there; it's easy to wind up going the exact opposite direction. Also, there aren't many ways over/under the expressway. You can take the skywalk through the Sands, but give yourself beaucoups of time, because the elevators and escalators really jam up. If you're okay with climbing up and down about 80 steps, you can get there pretty quick. Or, you can take the escalators through the mall to the top of the convention center, and get on the skywalk there."
,,Fantastic Light Show,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove has to be on your list of things to see in Singapore. At 7:45 and 8:45, the light show begins and you will really enjoy it. AND IT'S FREE!"
,,Garden Rhapsody Show was a delight to the senses!,5.0,,The enchanting fusion of music & lights dancing in the Supertree Grove was a sight to behold! I really enjoyed watching flickering lights and listening to the beautiful classical songs like Blue Moon and Moon River among others.
,,Super Trees,5.0,,"The High Light Of my Wife's Trip , and Free Too!! Get there early for a seat or , like most, lay on the ground to enjoy the show"
,,Artificial wonder,4.0,,"Very well made artificial gardens, good views and amazing place to spend time. You can easily spend half your day covering all the gardens.Connected by MRT"
,,An Evening Event,5.0,,Each evening these trees light up the area with a super light show. Some will tell you to see if from the top of the Marina Sands but it is much more spectacular from below the trees. The entire area and the show is solar powered. A must see.
,,Super Grove,5.0,,Great experience and light show magnificent. Great memory. Well worth the visit day and night. Great views from the high walk.
,,Great for instagram pictures.,4.0,,"This park is definitely worth a visit. You can take great pictures here- If you are a travelblogger like I am you can not miss this hotspot. It is super easy to reach by public transportation or take an Uber to the park. Most of the park is free however there is a paid part too. About 80% is free so if you are on a budget, no worries- you can enjoy the beauty of this park."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Supertree Grove located at garden by the bay ....there r 12 supetrees ...they r very giant...it is composed of actual living plant
Through a steel base....it has height in between 25 and 50 meters....there is skyway between the super trees...it is must visit...there is light and sound show on supertree at 7:45 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. every night....so visit it at night if possible...u can take great pics here..so don't even think to skip....enjoy"
,,Light show,5.0,,Definitely come for 7:45 and 8:45 pm light show. And come earlier if u want to get a good spot. I dont find it that impressive during the day
,,Night and vision,5.0,,"The trees look interesting during day, at night time there is a lightshow with acoustic which transforms it to a special event. Light and sound in harmony really make you tremble. There is a show in the evening, just after sunset. A must in Singapore!"
,,Beautiful at night,5.0,,When in Singapore you have to have a picture taken here especially at night when they lit up the trees.
,,Towering Architecture meets Nature,4.0,,"These unique sculptured trees soar 15-20 metres above you, creating a surreal landscape reminiscent of Avatar. The huge trunks are, in reality vertical gardens and the 'branches' hiding photovoltaic panels at the top of some of the trees. Stunning by day the Grove becomes magical at night with two amazing light displays set to loud yet undistorted music. Hundreds of people settle down on the ground to marvel at this free show."
,,Great walk,4.0,,"Wonde full time in Singapore and enjoyment in walking through this park with sculpture trees that also light up at night. If you have time, it is worth walking through it."
,,Amazing attraction. Liked the laser show.,5.0,,This is an amazing creation or architecture. Really liked the lased show offred in the evening. amazing sound system during the laser show.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,A 15 minute extravaganza of light and sound. Definitely a must do. The setting is stunning. Every night at 2045 and 2145. And it’s free. Get there early to find a seat or a piece of floor space.
,,A real surprise,5.0,,"Super Tree Grove, again a unique concept, the trees a part of a special tree light show each evening after dark, that can be viewed from differing levels around and between the trees, it attracts large crowds on evening especially after dark, Lights & Music to delight the senses . A wonderful experience"
,,better at night,5.0,,"your visit to singapore cannot end without a visit to the 'avatar' land. come in the evening when its not so hot and with the lights, u see the real beauty."
,,One of the unique mandmade strucuture witnessed,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove always fascinates me about Singapore. It's a must visit. I've been all 3 times in my 3 tours. Standing at the center of it makes you feel like in an alien saucer, well maintained out of the reclaimed land. They have night shows which gives you an insight into their culture, and yes entry free."
,,Fascinated,5.0,,I was fascinated by this place.It felt like I was in some other planet.Light show was just too good .I think it's better to enjoy the light show from bottom although one can go upstairs after paying entry ticket.You can't give this attraction a miss.
,,Lovely!!!,5.0,,Lovely adventure can be taken in this place. I liked it specially walking in the bridge! Very recommended specially for whom like to take photographs!
,,Recommended!,5.0,,"Great experience. Show at 7:45pm, but lights on from when it starts getting dark. No fee! Recommended for anyone!"
,,Just Beautiful,5.0,,"I went to watch the light show at Supertree Grove. It is absolutely breathtaking. Try to find a vantage point FROM THE GROUND from which you can see as many of the super trees as you can. They all light up and create a beautiful light show. The shows are free and 7:45 and 8:45 pm (as of March 2018)

As well as the trees there is a huge park in the surrounding area and you can spend hours here walking. Lots of people biking and jogging too."
,,Dazzling,5.0,,Fantastic structures swathed in foliage. The evening musical light show was stunning . An attraction like nothing else.
,,Amazing,4.0,,"I have never seen anything like this. I walked around the lower part of the gardens and enjoyed the massive trees surrounding me and you can also go up to get a sky view of the gardens as well.

There are several resting areas in the gardens as well as places to eat. You can spend quite a bit of time admiring and learning about the different plants and trees."
,,Garden rhapsody show - Just unbelievable!,5.0,,"After seeing all the photos, I was certain that I wanted to see these out of the planet structures at night. And vola! what a show put up by the Garden rhapsody. We went to the Cloud forest and flower dome by late afternoon so that we could see them both in the day light and at night. You could literally lie down on the floor and watch the super trees illuminate in sync with the music. One show not to be missed in Singapore!"
,,Fantastic Display,5.0,,Sitting at the entrance of the Gardens By the Bay is a set of Supertrees that appear to have the basis for the movie Avatar. Very surreal in appearance. On the main one there appears to be a complex on top that is available for special parties or events but it is not normally open to the public as far as I know.
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"As we only had limited time to spend at the Gardens by the Bay, we choose to visit the Supertree Grove as it is so different. We rode the elevator up to the elevated walkway and it's marvelous. Great views of city skyline, Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer. The Supertrees are very interesting in themselves - like enormous trees covered in many different plants. There is a cost to do the elevated walkway."
,,"Wow, just wow",5.0,,"I've often seen photographs of here and wished I could be there - and suddenly I was!
Free to get in and wander around - I took lots of photos and used my tripod all over the place with no objections.

Number of cafes here (including a McDonalds) and a brillian light show the evening I was there (not sure if it is on every night or just on weekend nights)

The trees are just stunning.

Probably best not to visit during the heat of the day - but do go!"
,,Out of this world !!!,5.0,,"We then went and visited the Super Trees and were amazed by the way it looked. I can only describe it as “out of this world” because it looked like a scene from a sci-fi movie. We were very impressed to say the least.

The trees are absolutely massive. There are a total of 18 Supertrees, all located within Bay South Garden at Gardens by the Bay. Among the 18, eleven of which are fitted with solar photolytic system to generate solar energy, providing lighting for the two conservatories located within the attraction. Apart from that, its exposed funnel-shaped top also helps to collect and store rainwater for use in irrigation and waterfall display within the conservatories.

We walked around and took a few pics of the various trees but as it was raining and a bit windy, the skybridge was closed unfortunately.

When we were there we found out that the Super Trees have a light show in the evening so we decided to come back again in the night.

Gardens by the Bay at night is super beautiful as the lights are everywhere. If you think the super trees are cool during the day then you’ll be blown away when you see them at night. The light show are at 7.45 and at 8.45 pm and it energises the trees with electric colours that makes them pulsate and looks amazing.

We just sat on the floor and enjoyed the light show and felt really luckily to have seen it. After the show there were fireworks in the Marina Bay which was superb too.

Overall we had a great time in the garden and I would highly recommend everyone to visit the garden. If you have time start early and stay till the night light and I assure you, you will love it."
,,good lightshow,5.0,,"Free to enter. A good place to visit by day, but at night at 6:45pm and 7:45pm they put on a music and light show which is excellent. these are the times that we went, it's worth checking if there are other show times as well."
,,Night visit - WOW,5.0,,"Have been to the supertree grove before but have missed the light display. The evening we went in January 2018 was to purposefully see the light show. We were not disappointed, we got there on time and got a good seat, i should say a place to lie back and enjoy.It was country themed and very well done, easy enough to distinguish different countries, well worth to see again and what they can dish up as a surprise. A must see on a visit, 2 shows a night."
,,Family friendly,4.0,,"Lovely idea and vast space to wonder around and let kids run free. We went late afternoon so were able to enjoy the trees in the daylight and again at 7.45pm for the light show which we all enjoyed. Plenty to do in the area; wander around, go up the walkway, visit the gardens, cloud forrest or have a drink with a view at indochine."
,,Supertrees!,5.0,,"Fabulous structure, a must see both during the day and at night. The sound and light show is a unique experience that will not fail to impress!"
,,DISNEY!!!!,5.0,,"Went there for their daily light show, and it was superb. Love it when they used a lot of Disney Theme song which bring back a lot of memory. Would suggest to go there at least once to have a look at it."
,,Not sure of the fuss,3.0,,Not sure of the fuss is about. Yes they light up to music twice a night to music and it is free. Apart from that I don’t get it
,,Amazing views.,5.0,,We wandered around the lower part of the gardens and enjoyed these massive structures above us and then we went up for the higher view. Excellent idea. The higher walkway is not open when it rains so make sure you go while it is still dry.
,,magical,5.0,,Go at night when the trees are lite up and check out the times of the sound to light performances before you go.
,,Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,The Super tree grove runs a light display at night (7.45 and 8.45) the lights change in time with music. Each tree is a different display and the plants appear luminescent.
,,Looks better on a sunny day.,4.0,,"We walked around the park on both a sunny and cloudy day. If you want good photos go when it's sunny and the sky is blue.

It's very hot and humid so hats and water are essential.

The sky walkway gives you some interesting photos and at S$8 is not expensive but it's a short walk and does get crowded, especially at weekends."
,,"Enough shade, open till late, FREE, great place to explore",4.0,,"Many plants to explore, easy to find shade, close to MRT, free entry, except up the metal tree thing (which is good fun) and tours and buggy around the place. it's very accessible for disabled, even the metal tree thing. Lovely walks, good views. Definitely worth a visit. Could cover in an hour or two, but also hang around for longer. Would visit again when back in Singapore."
,,Really good views of the city,5.0,,"It is a must do in Singapore. If you want you can pay 8 dollars to take a lift to go up in the threes. But even if you don´t want to pay, the view from the bottom is still worth it!"
,,Simply AWESOME at any time of the day,5.0,,"Day or night, there's something here for everyone. Catch the lights and sound show in the evenings and you will be in awe of how imaginative people can be if they have a limited resource. It's a MUST SEE for any trip to Singapore!"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,A great place to visit and walk around - will get even better when more of the plants grow to cover the frames. Unfortunately we couldn't go up to the higher walkways because of the weather but that looked like it would be good
,,Go in the evening,5.0,,"We visited in the evening and enjoyed the light and sound show which was well done and unlike anything else I have seen.
It wasn't too busy and we were able to find somewhere towards the edge of the grove so that all of the trees were visible.
If we had time we would also have liked to do the sky-walk but this had closed. It would have been possible to see the show from there which would have given a different dimension to the experience.
It's free as well...big smile."
,,Wow,4.0,,"man made trees with solar cells and one with a restaurant atop it make up the supertree grove. At night there is a light show that impresses, despite its music being liberally lifted from numerous disney movies"
,,"A sound and light must not miss experience and an interesting ""sky walking"" experience.",4.0,,You MUST experience the Sound and Light show every evening at 7.45 and 8.45 in the Supertree Grove - unbelievably it's free and I don't think there is anything like it anywhere else. We saw it 3 times! Twice on the first night and once on the night before we left Singapore. The Skyway walk on a bridge strung between 2 of the huge trees is interesting and didn't worry me even though I don't like heights.
,,Don't miss the light show!,5.0,,"Garden Rhapsody show was beautiful, this is a must see at day or nigth. There is nothing even close to this show in the world. Make sure to check the schedule before you visit, there are taxis available at the place if you need one to go back to your hotel."
,,From the future,5.0,,"Located in Gardens on the Bay, they are artificial structures covered with about 160,000 plants and resemble huge trees. Especially interesting are at night when there are light performances from 19:45 and 20:45."
,,Do NOT miss this at night,5.0,,Take an evening and ride the subway down here in the evening. It will be warm and beautifully lit. There is no cost to roam the neighborhood and its just blocks from Marina Bay.
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,"We went in the evening and it was incredible seeing the trees all lit up. Unfortunately we were too late to do the sky walk. At 8.45pm we had no idea about the light show, which was a really pleasant surprise to watch especially after watching the show at the Marina Bay"
,,At Night is best,5.0,,"This is a great place to visit & best to go at the end of the afternoon & stay for the night light show (about 15 minutes long)
There can be a long wait to go up to the high path around the trees at night time.
We had to wait 45 minutes but worth the wait.
If you have children remember to take something to does you do stand in line."
,,Superb views,5.0,,Had a long cold drink in the bar looking out over the views and then went on theSky walk which was amazing. The previous day I could not go on it as expecting lightning as a precaution. It was worth the wait and got the bus back to Orchard.
,,Spectacular View,4.0,,At night this supertree glow and shine. The sounds effects with matching lightning is great. Be sure to get there before the start of the show. Look for some place to stay around supretree and wait for the show to start at night. Don't forget to bring your cameras.
,,"Brilliant, you have to visit at night",5.0,,"far exceeded my expectations. but you have to be in the correct place to watch it.
stayed high the first time on a walkway that overlooks the park and it was ok, the speakers caused an echo, but the experience was fun.
walked around for a while and was going to leave by going thru the actual park when the second show was about to start so I laid down under the 'trees' and the experience was far better, it does get crowded but as the whole show is above you the crowd is not an issue so just pick a spot where you can see the three main 'trees' and you will have a good experience."
,,Beautiful display and free for all. The color show was fantastic!,4.0,,This is one of the must see deals in Singapore. I would suggest going to the Rain Forest enclosure first that is located close by. It is an amazing thing to see.
,,Really enjoyed the free light show,5.0,,"They do a free light show here which is very colorful, well synchronized to music and decently long. I believe about 10-15 minutes"
,,Great views,4.0,,"These tree structures have been very well done. They look amazing and the planting is great. Plenty to look at and wander around, for free, but if you want to ascend to the elevated walkway then there is a charge. We paid extra to go up there and it was well worth it. The views from up there are great."
,,Fantasy Garden,4.0,,"To walk around the Supertree Grove is actually free so if you just fancy a stroll around, come to the Gardens by the Bay and have a look. However, to get onto the walkway between the tress, you have to pay to get up (it's not too much though). Unfortunately on the day we went it was drizzling with rain so the walkway was shut all day so we did't get a chance to experience it and am unable to comment on it. The trees look like something out of a fantasy movie though, definitely worth visiting."
,,Superb light and sound show,4.0,,You have to come early to find a suitable perch to enjoy the laser show. Astounding light and sound effects to keep you mesmerised for the duration of the show.
,,Visit after Dark,4.0,,"Enjoy a stroll along the Marina Barrage for the refreshing evening sea breeze or else enjoy sunset drinks at Pollen. Head off after dark, to experience the Supertree Grove. The dramatic night lighting at makes the Avatar-like grove look otherworldly. On weekends, music plays over loudspeakers and during festivals, you may catch a free live performance. Head to Indochine for dinner and “treetop” views across to the iconic Marina Bay Sands. Reservations are essential for the weekend."
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"Amazing sight to see. They are huge and so beautiful as are the surrounding gardens and ponds. Great photos with Marina Sands in the back ground. Awesome at night, very busy. Early morning was quiet and we did Cloud and flower domes at the same time."
,,Astounding light show,5.0,,"Set inside Gardens by the Bay - a truly wondrous and futuristic place with man made trees that are lit up at night in a dazzling light show. The trees though are planted from base to the start of the branches with real plants and they look stunning. The park overall has some gardens which you pay to get into, a tram service to get you about, stunning gardens to wander around with gorgeous stainless steel sculptures in the fountain ponds. It is really calm and is behind the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The evening light show is amazing and takes place at 7.45 and 8.45 and it is advisable to get there a good 30 – 45 minutes early to get a good place to sit on the benches or stone troughs, especially if you want to take photos."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Visited today at everything. Another awesome place and one must visit this place. Don't miss the laser show and you can also go up but for that you need to come early and pay for the ticket and there are some roof top restaurant as well.
,,A must see at night,5.0,,The Supertree Grove is an experience like none other. The twice daily light and sound show is a must. Great to see such an imaginative and well executed public amenity. Singapore has a style like nowhere else.
,,Out of this world,5.0,,Feels like you popped into a scifi movie when you first see the trees standing tall and colorful. The entrance to the area is free and especially during Christmas time it's absolutely stunning with Christmas market and lights underneath.
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,Innovative and exciting. Whoever came up with the idea of building this was inspired. In the daytime it's wonderful walking up in the canopy of these man made structures. At night it's totally different with a wonderful light show....don't miss if your in Singapore ...
,,No.1 tourist attraction,5.0,,Just about the only tourist attraction here that I visit a few times a year. Well designed landscaping with incredible views of surrounding skyscrapers and sea. Bring a picnic basket during dawn to avoid the heat and restaurant prices.
,,Coolest thing about Singapore!,4.0,,These trees are super cool. I can’t wait until they are fully grown in with flowers and greenery. I could walk around them and look at them all day!
,,Breathe taking!,5.0,,The skywalk is a must thing to do when you are in Singapore. A mazing view from the top and the cost is affordable. A wonderful experience and very enjoyable.
,,Great place for lunch,5.0,,"There is a restaurant in the top of one of the super trees. View is great, and the food is very good,, well worth the time!"
,,Impressive but that's it,3.0,,"I was there during the day, it is quite impressive but nothing special. Singapore weather is hot and humid, and I did not enjoy it."
,,Beautiful at night,4.0,,Lovely garden and beautiful to walk around. The trees look so splendid and colorful at night. Also visited Supertree Indochine restaurant atop of 1 of the tallest trees in the grove. Lovely views from the restaurant although the deck outside had mesh at the bottom so not scary as it dsnt feel like standing on glass at all.
,,Very nice to sightseeing,4.0,,Very hot and sweating while walking around. I didn’t find the need to pay to go up but I was walking around the SuperTree. It looks better at night but during the daytime it still looks good as well.
,,WOW,4.0,,"A functional work of art. We did not go up, but just the view from below and from the Sands makes this work of art magnificent. It's like the Eiffel tower except botanical in looks. Not to be missed when in Singapore"
,,Truly exceptional!,5.0,,Reminiscent of the World’s Fair towers in Flushing Meadows this venue cold definitely serve as a backdrop to the next Men-in-Black sequel. Well worth the $8!
,,Fascinating attraction.,5.0,,This attraction is best viewed early evening to the nighttime. The colors of these tree-like structures are beautifully changing. the park is huge and you will be walking a lot. There are fireworks as scheduled each night. A great place to wind down after a hectic day. Lots of dining options around as well.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Went at night and the daytime to get different perspectives. Brilliant concept and not to be missed especially as there is no admission charge
,,Sight to See!,5.0,,Not only are the structures grand and the lights at night superb...but the hidden story of these trees shows the urban planning! They have solar panels and water collectors in the trees. They are more than just a pretty face!
,,Lived up to expectations!,5.0,,After seeing David Attenborough here at the end of Life on Earth I was determined to come here. Happily they lived up to expectations both in the light and especially at night. Come for the 7.45/8.45 light and music show but perhaps avoid weekends and public holidays as too many people can make it frustrating to move around. We visited during the lunar new year period and really enjoyed the Lion dance too. We visited several times and I would still come back! Easy to get to on MRT.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,We loved walking around Gardens By the Bay and this was definitely a highlight even in the rain! Take the time to visit if you can.
,,Absolutely Breathtaking,5.0,,"On our last evening in Singapore my girlfriend and I visited the Supertree Grove and were blown away. Following the gardens we expected a basic light show, but no pictures do this area justice.

Along with surveying from the ground, one of the trees also has an elevator which takes you to a restaurant/bar located at the top. It's great for a 360 view of Singapore, and a perfect way to cap off the visit!"
,,Trees of the future!,4.0,,"At the rate we are chopping trees down... these might be the only trees our kids will get to know. But leaving this sad statement aside, Singapore has made a great example of sustainable development here. They assessed their resources and noticed how much biomass they generated and how much energy that could provide, established a power plant with it and smoothly blend it with nature with these structures.

Every supertree has different functions, some have photovoltaics, some are cooling towers and some release moisture to the environment. Then cover it with plants which will continue the process of producing more biomass and carbon capture (although these little plants do not contribute that much).

The supertrees are also a visual spectacle, during the day the intricate construction and vegetation makes them interesting to watch... But the moment they shine is at night (pun intended).

If you feel a big hungry, do not worry the trees have you covered (pun intended ;) ). All around you will find restaurants, cafes and one Maccas (McDonalds) so you should be fine. There is a restaurant located at the top of one of the trees (or tower) from which you will have a magnificent view of the gardens.

Finally, if you are interested in walking high above the floor, you can buy a ticket to access the sky bridge (or sky something)... it should be from 8 to 12 dollars. I would love to give you feedback about it but we did not go up there.

Hope you enjoy your visit."
,,Unusual attraction,3.0,,"The supertrees are impressive looking, more so from a distance, I feel. I thought the sound and light show was a bit lame, but I may have been too close by being under the trees with the Christmas-style lights. Only three of the trees that I saw had these type of lights. The other trees seemed to be lit up with coloured flood lights."
,,From another world... futuristic and awe inspiring..,5.0,,Some of these can be climbed from within and one has a cafe at the top. At night these are all lit up - worth going to by day or night. Make this etrees part of a visit to the flower dome and the cloud forest - all doable in a day.
,,Super duper trees,5.0,,"We enjoyed seeing these creations when visiting the city and the gardens, amazing structures! Well worth a visit."
,,Light show at Nightime,5.0,,Great light show accompanied by music. Must see for tourists. Food around the trees is decent and it is an easy place to get too and from. Short walk over to MBS when finished.
,,a MUST see.,5.0,,Go early in the morning before it gets too crowded and too hot. The elevated walkway is quite an experience.
,,Loved this place,5.0,,"Spent a good half day here - dodging the rain.
The sky walk was great with some really good views of the city.
The care gone into the gardens is stunning. Would really recommend a visit here.
Also well worth a walk away from the busiest parts, we found a little outdoor food hall that served some very reasonably price but delicious food. We opted for the hut that sold the Dosa's."
,,Wheelie great night,5.0,,"This attraction is best visited after flower dome and the cloud forest as the light shows can be seen then, the attraction will take best part of day when all are included"
,,"Avatar like, but fantastic experience",5.0,,"I never thought that this garden would appeal, but it surpassed all expectations. The gardens were well laid out, beautifully maintained and had good sign posting. A walk on the gantry is wothwhile."
,,Night photoshoot is the best,5.0,,"This is incredible place, must see. We went to visit Garden at PM hours and it was amazing, the lights just makes everything look like from another world. Would come back to see it again in a day time. Incredible!"
,,"Phenomenal, a Must See",5.0,,"Really out of this world, so unusual and beautifully constructed. Light show was an incredible experience - if there's one thing you have to do in Singapore, this is it. Absolutely unmissable."
,,Sensational & Magical,5.0,,You must visit this magnificent & spectacular tourist site for which I am sure the people of Singapore should be extremely proud. Words cannot simply describe it's beauty which is electrified by the sensational light & music show. All for a very reasonable $25 pp.
,,Something different!,5.0,,Well worth a look! Beautiful garden area to walk around. Go for the 'walk in the sky' between the 'trees' if you are game! Can get very hot walking around so when you have had enough go into the 'glass houses' and see the beautiful botanic gardens there.
,,Light and sound show after dusk,4.0,,"I don't know if this is any good during the day, but the free sound and light shows at 19:45 and 20:45 are definitely worth a detour from the rest of the gardens if you are there in the evening.

The only annoyance is the number of people who feel they just have to record everything on camera, and may stand up and block your view sometimes."
,,Stunning,5.0,,A must see. Set in beautiful parkland close to Marina Bay this is one of the most unusual & spectacular attractions I have seen anywhere. Take time to walk around the surroundings which also contain some great sculptures and enjoy the different perspectives.
,,Go see!,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, this is a must! Stunning views and the best light show at night. Very popular so be on time to get the best seat."
,,Not too impressed,4.0,,"Yes, if you are in Singapore you should visit the supertree grove, especially if you are visiting the cloud garden. The night light show was okay, perhaps I was expecting more or a better show."
,,Can't Miss It!,5.0,,Latest tourist attractions on the list!! Singapore will never let you down..This takes you in Galaxies..You can enjoy this by lying down on floor and watch the magic of lights with music of different countries.. Indian song .. Chaiya Chaiya is there.. surprise for tourist :)
,,excellent view,5.0,,"We visited this place twice, the first day we visited here is almost around 5-6 PM. So what you can appreciate is the magnificent view of these supertree groves then we came back the next day to explore the marina bay where we can see and enjoy the view of the park on daytime."
,,Worth the trip to visit and wait for sunset,5.0,,This would have been a lot better if we had a room at the Marina hotel. Being on the grounds and listening to the music and the light show was awesome.
,,AMAZING!!! Go! Go! Go!,5.0,,"You are missing out on something very special and unique if you miss seeing the Supertree Grove, while in Singapore. Walk the suspended walkways between these astounding 'tree-like' structures. Each has eco-friendly plantlife growing up the structure."
,,Beautiful artificial trees,4.0,,Total marina bay area is full of most modern aristocratic creatures. Very prominent & landmark tourist attractions in Singapore are situated here. One single day isn't good enough to visit all the attractions. We started first from Marina bay area & afterwards found beautiful artificial tree structures. The super trees are a wonder. As we were there in the evening the trees seemed to be alive with breath taking light show. We enjoyed nice time there & took some photographs. Near the trees one Mcdonalds is available to have refreshments.
,,Beautiful and a must see in Singapore,5.0,,A real experience. Picture can not do it justice.I recommend the tree top walk and to see the spectacular light show.
,,Simply breath taking,5.0,,"Set in the gardens by the bay the super tree grove is wonderful, walking around at ground level is a real experience but pay the additional fee to go up to the high level pathway strung through the trees and it becomes breathtaking with wonderful views. This is a real experience but not for those who are worried by heights as the pathway is hung by cables from the trees and wobbles a bit. For everybody else it's a must do."
,,Cool lightshow,4.0,,Very cool in the evening with the lightshow. More seats would be good since people were sitting on the ground.
,,Don't miss it!,4.0,,Yet another example of Singapore's love for cutting edge engineering - even better during the light show held there each evening.
,,man made wonder,5.0,,"This is a sight to behold the technology, for powering and sustainable solar energy, the super trees are a wonder , they come alive every evening with a breath taking light show, do carry a sheet to enjoy the show lying underneath the trees"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Be sure to go when you can see the show in the evening. It's amazing. Don't go on a tour, just grab a taxi and go on your own. We had dinner there after wondering throuh and stayed for the show"
,,Must Visit,5.0,,We were in town for the Christmas light shows on the trees and it was a really neat experience. This place is so unique it's a must visit if in Singapore.
,,A must see at night and day,5.0,,"It is very beautiful to see at day and at night. Best part it is free. Very nice laser show in the evening, but you have see it from the ground close to the Supertrees, not from the Sands observation area."
,,One of the most beautiful things I've ever seen!,5.0,,It's a must do while in Singapore. Its so beautiful and it's worth staying for the show. I had big expectations and I found it to be even better that I could have imagined.
,,Singapore Air Show 2018,4.0,,Fantastic show...we go there for the 1st time...our group feel very happy with the show and also the environment.
,,OK - but not more to see than from the picture,4.0,,"We just walked around. Impressive, but not that fantastic. 19:45 is the light show. Do not set off too much time here."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,Looks like a scene out of Avatar. Beautifully constructed trees that take your breath away...simply stunning...
,,"Nice by day, outstanding at night",4.0,,"If you are heading for the Gardens in the Bay, then you will be able to see Supertree Grove. Once inside the Gardens there are a few attractions that you need to pay for and this is one of them. We had already done the Flower Dome and the Cloud Gardens and felt that we had paid sufficient for the sights available. In any case, you can get a good viewing of Supertree Grove from the grounds of the gardens but also from the nearby walkway between the gardens and the Marina Bay Sands Resort."
,,BEAUTIFUL & UNIQUE,5.0,,A beautiful experience with amazing views. Great photo opportunities all around. There is a small charge to walk across here but well worth it as the views over he marina and looking onto Marina Bay Sands is great
,,"Free, Excellent Show, If you have time, SEE",5.0,,"This is a free show, two times a night. Light and music and right in the city. The gardens are beautiful. Lots of places to eat. It is a little hard to find your way from the MRT to the Gardens at times. Just be aware of signs."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Just go. It's breathtaking - both during the daytime and at night when the trees are lit up. The walkway between the trees is also well worth it.
,,Awesome and unique,5.0,,"Definitely one of the most special sight in Singapore. Love the way it's designed. Reminds me a lot of the scenes from the movie Avatar. Great place to go for families, sending out great messages of the nature."
,,Trees that were made...,5.0,,"Its my most favorite place within the garden. Better visit during the evening. DOn't miss the light and music show. If you are hungry, there are few eateries just few meters away from the Supertree Grove"
,,Unique Experience,5.0,,I visited both during daylight and nighttime. I personally liked it at night. When the show starts it transports you to somewhere else. It is an architectural masterpiece.
,,Amazing site,5.0,,"The Super groove trees is a spectacular site in daylight a swell as in night.

Its work of art and sheer brilliance, so beautiful. Do not miss the light show. The music and light show is quite spectacular and everyone should definitely attend this.

There is a ticket to climb up to the trees and its worth the spend. I would really recommend everyone to definitely spend and go up and experience this magnificence site."
,,Very nice,4.0,,Prefer the evening / night view with the lights. A unique display of mother earth design. An experience for the children to enjoy nature.
,,Amazing.,5.0,,"Have visited the gardens on a previous visit which to me were mind blowing.This year we returned in the evening to see the light and music show which was Highlight for me. quality of the music was excellent and the atmosphere was electric,not to be missed"
,,Worth a Visit when going to Marina Bay Gardens,4.0,,This music and light show is quite spectacular and although the gardens are the main reason for visiting the super tree grove was an unusual end to a superb visit.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,These trees are what made me want to come here to see them for real and they didn't disappoint. Quite amazing and also functional.
,,Very impressive unique attraction,4.0,,"We chose not to pay to go up in the trees but admire them from the ground. They are such amazing things, impressive engineering and design.
The lights show is not to be missed, I think its on every night and they light up along with music its really an impressive thing to see at night.
Also amazing to see them from Marina Bay Sands, we stayed there and had a super view from the room - or you can go to their observation deck to see them too"
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is so good we went twice whilst on our trip! We went during the day and did the high walk and along with seeing the Gardens by the Bay, but went again at night. Would highly recommend visiting at night it is a whole different experience. The lights and musical accompaniment is amazing and can't be missed. Plenty to do and lots of places to eat to make a very worthwhile second visit."
,,well breathtaking creations,4.0,,"You know if you are in singapore then the first thing you want to see is this supertree grove in gardens by the way,
they are a stunning piece of art and there are often associated with the light show and they are especially amazing during the evening time like 6 pm, must see place i reckon"
,,Deservedly Iconic,5.0,,"A must see. Go twice, once during the day - early morning is good but the walkway doesn't open until 10am, and once to see the light show at 7.45pm or 8.45pm. Very different feel both times but you need to be under the trees."
,,WOW! these are amazing,4.0,,"Visit this Garden park early to ensure you see as much as possible, the overall park surrounds where the Super Tree Grove is situated are free entry however the two Other main attractions being the Flower dome and the Cloud Forest attract a fee. The evening light show at the Super Tree Grove is something not to be missed."
,,Light show galore !,5.0,,"I recommend doing this at night to see all the beautiful lights and the show with music. Walking the bridge at night was beautiful, but be prepared for a wait in line. Once you get up top it is just majestic !"
,,VERY IMPRESSIVE,4.0,,The grove of tree shaped structures provides a unique sight within the Gardens by the Bay. The entire framework of each is covered and the effect is stunning. Light show at 7.45 PM and 8.45 PM was fantastic.
,,Loved the Lights,5.0,,Really a great light show! Worth camping out for an hour to have a good seat to hear music and see the trees light up. Beautiful.
,,Night Adventure,4.0,,Walking through Marina Bay after Sunset will give much pleasure. The lights give you a feeling of serenity and will make you feel very relaxed. A must see attraction.
,,as in movie,5.0,,"In day these tree don't look so amazing, but evening.... there are two light and music shows in evening, so it is must see thing in Singapore. Just lie down under tree, enjoy music and lights. We felt as in avatar movie"
,,Fabulous,5.0,,Go at night and see the show which begins at 7.45 pm. It lasts for 15 minutes and is absolutely fabulous. There were hundreds of people there on a Friday night. Easy reach of the city by taxi and there is a taxi stand right outside the venue so easy to get back to your accommodation.
,,Amazing !,5.0,,"Spend a couple of hours in this magical place. The best time to visit is at sunset, it's incredible up there."
,,Super Supertrees,4.0,,"Went during the day, great experience, even though I'm petrified of heights. Felt very safe up there. Thick railings to hold on to all the way around. Was a shorter walk than expected. Reasonable prices. Would have liked to have been informed earlier that they have a restaurant /cafe at the top of one also. Would have been nice to do this too. Lovely gardens to walk though to get to the trees. Very good all round experience."
,,Lost for words,5.0,,"The first night I watched the trees change colour whilst seated below the Singapore flyer. The next night we went in the Gardens for the 745 light show, the music and the spectacle was just incredible. To lay back and watch these super trees glow and twinkle above is something else. As the plants on the structure grow it will become even more impressive if thats possible."
,,"Pretty Cool, but skip the Christmas show",4.0,,"We visited at Christmas - and so did everybody else. That means that the usual free show cost us about $8 each (I think) and was really super crowded. I am not much for crowds, so I think I would have preferred a non-holiday visit. However, the lights are beautiful and the music really adds to the experience."
,,Super interesting,5.0,,"Something unique and really interesting and beautiful, especially the light show they offer every night."
,,Really impressive!,5.0,,"The huge man made trees were really impressive. It will be wonderful to see what they are like when all the plant life has covered them. They are building even more trees. We visited during the day since that was the only time we had, but we are told that visiting at the end of the day when the sun is setting and the lights are going on is really the best time."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"we combined this with our visit to Garden on the bay, nice music and very colourful. afternoon in the Gardens then a good meal close by followed by the lightshow."
,,A delight at night!,5.0,,Was able to see this after dark in January with the lighting and music - it was an enchanting experience at the Gardens. Don't miss this one if you can stay late!
,,Show too late,4.0,,"We were so tired walking around. The show is a little too late for us. We did not see it completely. Tips, prepare yourself for a long walk to enjoy this place."
,,A wonderful sight to see!!!,4.0,,A must place to visit during night time when you are in Singapore. You will definitely not regret it. Don't forget to take some pictures.
,,Sci Fi Meets Nature,5.0,,"Another of my happy places in Singapore. It's free to wander the grounds as much as you want. You'll be surrounded by abundant botanical beauty for sure. However, if you're okay with heights, follow the signs and head over to the OSBC Skyway. This is where you pay a small fee ($8) and ride the elevator up to those looming vivid sculptures of life. You'll walk the wire-suspended, metal grate pathway in the air. Views include Marina Bay Sands, ships at sea, all the forested lower garden areas below, and the towering splinters in glass and steel of modern Singapore skylines. No photos because on my visit today (like other days) was windy and I was afraid to drop my phone if I took a picture. But that's just me. Others were cranking out the selfies as usual. Notes: be sure to secure hat, eyewear. Enjoy the height, don't fear it.
As for the rest of the grove when you're on the ground...get your camera. Lovely orchids, bromeliads and other plants await your discovery. And just the marvel of technology - truly stunning and futuristic, day or night!"
,,Great Night Show,5.0,,"Two evening light show performances accompanied by music. When we first attended, we sat in the grove amongst the trees. This time we stood at the top elevator platform for the show which gave us a better view of the entire show and we didn’t have to crane our necks to see."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"I wasn’t expecting to find metal imitations of trees beautiful - but they are. They’re actually frames with planting interweaved in them, and are very attractive to look at.

Of course, it’s night when they come into their own, and there’s an amazing light show nightly at 19:45 and 20:45. Impressive either around them, or from a vantage point such as the Flyer or Marina Bay Sands Skypark.

Free, but there’s a charge for the Skyway walk that runs through the treetops."
,,Superfantastic,5.0,,Really a must visit. This was a wow factor for us. There is a lot to see and enjoy. Beautifully constructed.
,,Nice walk up above artificial giant trees,4.0,,"Supertree Grove is part of Singapore's ""Gardens by the Bay."" It is the first area that you'll come across as you enter the gardens. At day time you can climb up the giant tree structures and walk along the so-called OCBC Skyway. It is 128 meters long and 22 meters high. The number of people allowed on the skyway at a time is regulated, so sometimes there's a long queue of people waiting for their turn. You can either take the stairs or the lift to reach the skyway. At night, the entire area is lit with different colors, seeming more like one of those gardens you see in the film Avatar (especially when the ""Garden Rhapsody"" begins -- a free light and sound show twice every evening). Access to the OCBC Skyway is from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM. Better arrive their early to avoid the crowd. Admission tickets costs SG$8 for adults."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Love it so much ... only pay for 8 sgd take the lift and walk through the long bridge then can enjoy amazing view on the top. PRICE worth for it !!!
,,"Must do, both day and night",5.0,,"The trees are very nicely done and maintained. The up access is not that expensive and the view is great for the pathview. During the day, it's perfect for a promenade, and at night, you have the show at 7h45 which will amazed you all the times you see it"
,,Nicer than the photos,5.0,,I was stunned by just how beautiful this place is at night. Also very quiet and surprisingly peaceful for a free tourist attraction. I could have just spend a few hours more just lying under one of the trees. Definitely recommend it.
,,SUPER TREES - SUPER SPECIAL,5.0,,"Glimpsed the Super Tree Grove during our day visit to the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome and could not wait to get back there for the night show. We missed walking the sky bridge as they close at 8pm. The light & music show in the tree grove is magical, free and a must do if in Singapore. Eat at Satay by the Bay then stroll to the super tree show and then walk over the Helix Bridge back to the Bay area. Safe easy walk that is just beautiful in the cool of the evening."
,,Very unusual place. :),4.0,,"Personally it would have been funny to be at the engineering-planning meeting for these structures. I imagine the mastermind behind this was showing some drawings telling the city councillors about their dream to build some.massive structures out of it on and have plants grow up the outsides of them to create a 'super forest that is so odd and curious in nature every visitor to Singapore would be drawn to take a look with their own eyes. Lol. I believe that is the case. But...it is quite a ""forest' of these mega structures. Free to check out.. there is a small charge to go up inside one and walk on a platform to 2 other 'trees'. You'll definitely leave there saying ""well, there's something you don't see every day"". ;)"
,,Amazing sight and sound,5.0,,We got to the site directlly underneath the trees half an hour before it was due to start so that we had a place to sit and enjoy the lights. So glad we did as not much seating is available. Worth the wait though as the lights were magnificent and well supported by the soundtrack. It cost nothing so a wonderful treat.
,,By night amazing..by day lovely,5.0,,The first day i saw this place almost at the closure so i saw the final show and it's woooow..amazing..then after days i went back by day and i really live it!!! I'll be back to Singapore and i wabt to go into the bar at the top of one of these trees.
,,Superb Architecture,5.0,,"This place is a must visit place. Stroller friendly, awesome light and sound show . OSBC skybridge is worth the time spend"
,,Worth doing,5.0,,"Well worth seeing this, the high walkway is great if you have a heads for heights. Fabulous views of the gardens."
,,Supertree Grove is Super!,5.0,,The grove is spectacular in every way. Situated in a serene environment the trees are glorious sculptures that rise towards the sky in majestic beauty. Take the elevator to the skywalk where you can walk and enjoy views of the Gardens by the Sea and the majestic Sands Hotel. The light show at night is awesome -- don't miss it!
,,A stunning work of art!,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is an amazing site to see. Huge metal trees are covered in plants and flowers. There is even a walkway between some of the ""trees"". Come here for the light show at 7.45 and 8.45 in the evening. The light show is free, although there is a charge if you want to go on the walkway."
,,It was FUN...just not great,3.0,,"We stopped by here after a meal and had a nice time watching the trees change colors etc with the music in the background. It was fun and entertaining but, just another tourist attraction. I do recommend it but, don't put your hopes up too high."
,,Nice place and enjoyable,5.0,,It is amazing giant tree. I like the show at night which is FREE!! it very close to Marina Bay and Marina Barrage.
,,"Stunning scenery, lovely night show",5.0,,"This really was one of the highlights of my visit to Singapore. The greenery was luscious and the night show was spectacular. So green and beautiful, with fantastic views of the city skyline."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"It is one of those ""you have to see to Believe"" places. The size and intricacy of the structure is outstanding and when they light up it's even more so."
,,Great,4.0,,"Very nice to look at in the dark. Unwortunatley the Sky Walk was closed due weather contitions. The liight show was amazing, even in the rain."
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,Amazing supertree is actually giants lamps in the Garden by the bay. You can spend hours there with lots of fun and great views. There are also various choice of foods in the Garden.
,,An amazing garden!,5.0,,"A visit to Gardens by the Bay isn't complete without a visit to the Supertree Grove. See the supertrees, and go up for a gorgeous view of the surrounding, especially with the setting Sun. Another definite must visit, regardless of whether you're a Singaporean or tourist."
,,Well-Worth Your Time,5.0,,One of the attractions at the Gardens by the Bay are the Super Trees. These tree-like structures are actually gardens. There are 18 of these trees located within the south garden of the Gardens by the Bay. The trees provide shade during the day and are a beautiful sight in the evening during the light and sound show.
,,Giant steel trees by the bay,5.0,,Huge man made steel structures that are covered with thousands of plants so they appear natural with a walkway at the top. $8 for this attraction well worth it for the views of the gardens bay and marina bay sands. you can queue for some time as they only allow a certain amount of people on the walkway I think its around 50. the walkway is not long but with so many photo shots along the way you can spend a little time up here before taking the lift back down or if you don't want to wait you can take the stairs.
,,Amazing night time attraction!!,5.0,,if you have time in a trip to singapore: it's a must have! get your camera and make yr most beautiful shots of singapore! one of the top 10 experiencs you will hav hope this is helpful!!!!!
,,great at night time,5.0,,"... and for free. amazing light show open air a few steps from centre with connect to blue metro line, best after sunset"
,,Just Do It,5.0,,Worth the experience. Has great views from the skywalk and looks sensational all lit up at night. Especially as it gets dark as they do a light show with all the trees going off in a Kaleidoscope of colours.
,,Gardens by the bay,5.0,,"A must visit place in Singapore. Awesome structure , man made trees gives the spirit of nature to the eyes of traveler."
,,We loved it!,5.0,,"We went thru the park at night and we enjoyed it! We loved the silence, we loved the nature, we loved all the lights and colours!! We will definitely come back!"
,,Signature structures of Singapore,5.0,,"Our second visit to Singapore, after thirty years , much has changed , especially the signature structures, the super tree grove , the two doors of an inside garden, the cloud garden ,and the three towers of the sand Hotel , amazing scenery so impressive, One can not forget ,"
,,Outing with grand-daughter and hubby,4.0,,"We wrapped up our day outing at Gardens by the Bay with a seafood dinner here. Ordered the seafood platter and a bottle of wine to pair with the food. Ambience is good; view is pretty and needless to say service was good too. If not for the price, I would have love to go there often"
,,Remarkable structures,4.0,,"This """"grove"" of tree shaped structures provides a unique sight in the Gardens by the Bay. The growth of plants up the structures has nearly covered all the framework and the effect is stunnig."
,,Show was Fantastic,5.0,,"Light show at 7.45 PM and 8.45 PM was fantastic Light kind of dance for Songs played from SG , CH and other Asian languages Enjoyed it"
,,Fun to do,4.0,,Super tree grove is a fun walk high above the ground. You get good views of the park and other landmark. Avoid it if you have fear of heights
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"I was here 2 years ago& I will admit I had expected the foliage to grow a little more than it seems to on the trees, although the surrounding gardens definitely have.
I love the ecological aspect of the Grove - do read up about it - very impressive & interesting.
There is an audio tour which is 25mins long & is very interesting if you find it too hot to walk.
The gardens are also worth visit, not just the trees, but be aware it gets very busy with locals at the weekends.
The Indochine Bar offers you the chance to go inside the tallest tree & have a drink at the bar - fab views."
,,Beautiful show of Singapore's Culture,5.0,,"We attended at sunset and came in time for the show which was well worth the visit. I am not usually a fan of light shows and the likes but with the super trees, the shrubbery, the lights all of it together was an amazing sight to see.

The crowd was captivated throughout and it is one of my most memorable experiences in Singapore"
,,The Future is What You Imagine It To Be,5.0,,These trees are stunning by night and day. Well worth the $8 for the Skywalk as too. Just incredible.
,,"I don't get it, but people say it's amazing",4.0,,"I don't really get this one, but people say it's amazing. I suppose the lights are pretty cool, especially when there are events (e.g. Christmas, Deepavali)."
,,A must do,5.0,,"You have to go up and do the walkway. The views are amazing and the photo opportunities are amazing. Although it cost a few dollars, don't hesitate to go up and do the walkway"
,,Nice lightshow in the evening,4.0,,"A nice place to spend a couple of hours, culminating with the light show in the evening. It does get pretty busy when the show starts."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Amazing amazing amazing place. Absolutely magical especially at night time with the light show and music. If you’re lucky enough to get up there when it’s dusk you’ll see the show from the trees. Unfortunately you can only be up there for about 15 mins but it’s worth it. Can be quite a wait too to go up to the top too.
,,We love coming here,5.0,,"We have been here before on trips to Singapore and love it - during the day as well as at night. The 15 minute evening light and music shows in the Supertree Grove are brilliant. This time they had changed the music to an Asian theme, different to when we were last here. We enjoyed it again, and will look forward to returning again next time we are in Singapore."
,,Unique,5.0,,This area is what you come to first when you are going to the pay counter for visiting the Domes at the Garden. I've never seen anything like it. Good to roam around and see how unique these structures are. So awesome and so pretty at night with the lights! gotta check it out!
,,Unique to Singapore,4.0,,"This feature is part of the Gardens by the Bay complex. Huge metal structures that have stairs or lifts in the centre & walkways around the outside of the hanging gardens. A few of them are connected by a mid air walkway linking them so you can walk amongst the tree tops. Its unique & a great tourist attraction while at the same time ""greening""Singapore in a positive way. Its lit up at night."
,,Great for night photos,4.0,,"Go there around dusk, so you get the benefit of seeing them both in the daylight and again in the dark. (don't forget to take a tripod or something to hold your camera steady. There is a light show at various times during the evening."
,,Better than expected,4.0,,There is music and a light show twice in the evening. Doesn't cost anything and rather better than expecred.
,,Zany,4.0,,"These interesting structures have an short elevated walkway where you walk ""in the tree tops"". Good views over Gardens by the Bay. Apparently can be closed if weather turns as open air"
,,This is a must see,5.0,,Spend a couple days seeing this amazing garden. You can purchase food their or take a picnic. Make sure you are in your walking shoes.
,,A must see,5.0,,These giant man made trees are stunning in the daytime and unbelievable at night during the sound and light show. No entrance fee except it you want to do the Skywalk. This would be one of the top destinations in Singapore. Not to be missed.
,,Worth a visit and a photo,4.0,,"Gardens by the Bay is a great, casual experience in SIngapore. The open gardens are free and the Supertree Grove is free to walk around.
Value: The Grove is open to the public for free but to walk on the ramps above incurs a cost (S$8).
Amenities: Toilets, cafes and gift shops near by.
Accessability: Ramps and clean paths make this an easy tourist attraction.Plenty of parking and easy to get to from Marina Bay Sands.
Tip: See the Supertree Grove light up at night."
,,Visually exciting and free,5.0,,"This is a great free attraction and I went twice - once in the day and then again at night. This garden has life and colour. While there were lots of people especially at night for the light show, because of the way it was set out there wasn't a crowd when you walked around. Loved the fact it was free and anyone could go. My only complaint was the music for the light show - a bit twee and Disney. With so many great composers out there why not choose something a little more interesting to play."
,,Amazing in the night,5.0,,Go in the evening and wait for the light show. Looks amazing in the night. There are 2 shows at the night. Must see place.
,,Superb experience at night,5.0,,Unbelievably beautiful “trees” I was expecting this to be a crass tourist trap and I’m not usually up for this sort of thing- but thoroughly enjoyed it. You must go in the evening for full effect of the lights.
,,Too artificial to impress me.,3.0,,"They have built huge concrete ""trees"" and hung them with living plants. The evening light show did not impress me either, but most people there seemed to enjoy it."
,,Free light and music show no entry,5.0,,Free light and music show every evening from 7.45 and 8.45. It's a nice attraction moreover you don't have to spend a penny or dine. Amazing light and music show for reference see the pics
,,Great!,4.0,,Spent the day in the 'clouds' and gardens and stayed for the light show in the evening. The trees are magnificent and we really enjoyed the light display. I found the trees fascinating and it wasn't til I got back to the hotel I realised how many pictures I had taken! A beautiful and unliquidated display. Well done Singapore!
,,Closed if raining!,4.0,,"This was on our To Do List since previous trips to Singapore, but this January 2018, we had tickets to go inside the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest and wanted to visit the Supertree Grove.

Like all things in Singapore, it never ceases to amaze the visitor. Unfortunately when we visited the Supertree Grove was closed due to wet conditions as it had been raining heavily.

Please keep this in mind to time your visit to a dry day or evening so you don't run the risk of it being closed for safety reasons."
,,Out of this world,5.0,,Get here just before sunset to watch the light show. It really is like nothing you have ever experienced in your life and the best part is that it's free.
,,Really Awe Inspiring,5.0,,"These structures are huge and almost unbelievable. What's lovely about them is that they are covered with dense tropical foliage, which provides a habitat for exotic birds, insects etc. Great to see in the sun and then later once it gets dark when they are beautifully lit."
,,Beautiful Views,5.0,,We went there both during day time and night time and the site was amazing. The night view was also spectacular with the lights atop the trees changing different colors. Walking on the sky bridge was also a must do in this beautiful park.
,,Must see,5.0,,Definitely a must see when in Singapore. The shows at the evening are free and you can lay down on stone tier and enjoy the music and lightning show. Go and visit Supertree Groves restaurant/bar. There are great views to see.
,,Very good views from here,5.0,,We have been twice last year on the first visit we concentrated on the glass domes. This time we arrived early and went on the aerial walk way and enjoyed the views.
,,A La Avatar,5.0,,Really cool place. Very nice for the day or night stroll. The evening performance is super colorful and so electric. You better go there from the MARINA Bay hotel. So you have a panorama for the video of the performance. Very lovely for kinds
,,The lights without the music was underwhelming.,4.0,,"Having seen the fountain and light show at the Bay we headed over to the super trees to see them illuminated. During the daytime the trees are impressive so we had high expectations of them being lit up. Thinking we'd get a good view from above we stood at the end of the flyover. However, from there you cannot hear the music and the lighting was mainly of bulbs going on and off at random. Maybe if it had been synchronised to music we'd have appreciated it more. Or, perhaps it was because we'd been wowed by the Spectra show immediately beforehand. 3 out of five for the evening, 4 out of 5 for the daytime."
,,Magical!!,5.0,,"We visited Supertree Grove twice on our visit with friends.

The first time was a Saturday night around 9:30, there weren’t many people there at all and so it was peaceful and truly magical!

The second night we went to the 7:45 light show & although it was rammed with people the show was incredible!! It soon quietens down once the crowd leaves.

We had bought a skywalk ticket before the light show (best option as the wait time was over 75mins before) and only had to wait 15mins to travel up there. Incredible to see it from this viewpoint.

If we go back to Singapore we wouldn’t hesitate to go back and explore the gardens more and of course see the light show again."
,,Great experience,4.0,,Loved the domes. The super tree was a good experience. Stay and catch the light show. The exotic plants are one of the kind!
,,Very Pretty,5.0,,Went as a solo traveler looking to kill time. Was captivated by the size and design of these trees. Free to walk about and admire their beauty so I definitely recommend this place to just about anyone.
,,Human build miracle,5.0,,"It is just marvelous what humans can do and how creative people can be. This place is amazing and you have to go there, but schedule your timing well. You should be coming around 5-6:30 pm to see the sunset from the trees. They return can be a bit tricky if it is very busy. There is the possibility to walk though, but wear comfy shoes for that."
,,The future is here!,4.0,,"There is something about these set against the backdrop of the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the two amazing floral and tree pavilions that creates a surreal futuristic vibe. The skywalk really didn't add that much to the experience, but is probably worth doing anyway. The night time light display is worth going back for."
,,Beautiful Gardens,5.0,,"Beautiful Gardens that you could send all day in. A quiet retreat from the hustle of the City. The skywalk gives a great biview over the whole gardens, and there are seats so you can stop and just sit quietly and enjoy the space."
,,Excellent visit in the evening,5.0,,Excellent visit in the evening to see the light / sound show it runs x2 per night. We were in the gardens a couple of days prior in the day time. The evening was different and worth the visit.
,,Unique!,5.0,,"Such fascinating and beautiful structures! I recommend a afternoon/evening visit to see the trees in daylight and then lit up at night, although it is busier at this time than earlier in the day. The light show is also a cool experience, I watched it from the overbridge to marina bay sands, but there are plenty of vantage points."
,,Wonderful View Point,5.0,,"What a beautiful place to go day or night. For $20 go to the top, get a free beer and watch the sun go down and take pictures of the area."
,,"Stunning, breath-taking.....but don;t put put off by a laser show without ..well...lasers",5.0,,"I guess you have to walk amongst the ""super trees"" to truly appreciate the scale and artistry, where nature over time will inter-weave and provide a natural canopy

Far exceeded my expectations and could have spent a half day/ evening here alone- as it takes on another dimension again in the dark

But don't hold your breath for the laser light show- 15 mins of music and bulbs preceded by a ""Disney-esque"" announcement which promised far more than it offered

Nevertheless a spectacular experience without the ""laser show"""
,,Fabulous,5.0,,The light show at night is spectacular. If you are in Singapore you must take the time to see the show set to music. it is breathtaking.
,,Impressive!,5.0,,What a imaginative way to collect water! The Concept. design and construction of these water collection towers and how they contribute to the ecological and environmental management of the Gardens by the Bay are a model that demands examination by other garden designers throughout the world.
,,Part of the Marina Bay Gardens,5.0,,"These are the centre point of the free area of the Marina Bay Gardens. They are wonderful and a sight to behold. However, do not miss out on the paid for Flower Dome and Cloud Forest which both need about 45-90 mins each.

Dedicate a whole day to this place."
,,Beautiful both day and night,5.0,,"These supertrees are a sight to see, both during the day and at night when they are all lit up. The surrounding gardens are beautiful. You can see these for free!"
,,THE NIGHT SHOW,4.0,,"went with the family to see the night light and music show, very nice, calming and very subtle, a nice change from in your face displays."
,,brilliant idea,5.0,,"It was super genius to make and create. Whether seen in the morning or at night, all day you get to see how amazing it is. Evening time you get to see it with the lightings on, pretty amazing and magical."
,,It makes sense visiting if you visit Gardens by the Bay,3.0,,"Definitely, the main attraction is going up on the suspended bridge which offers a great view over the Gardens by the Bay, Marina, and Financial District."
,,Nice lights show,5.0,,We watched the show form the roof of Marina Sands Mall. Impressive! Worths to see it! Seems close to Marina Bay but it takes like 20 minutes walk to get close to them :))))
,,Beautiful Evening,5.0,,"It is actually a light show around the trees , but very beautifully crafted .. a must visit for everyone"
,,Just a little bit different,4.0,,A wonderful place to visit and the super trees are quite stunning. It is free to walk around this area and the light show in the evening is also free. The trees really do look stunning lit up and it pays to walk a little further into the grounds so that you get a good view of the majority of the trees. Definitely worth the visit.
,,The light and sound show at night,5.0,,Come here at night for the show. At morning it's just another very good tourist attraction in Singapore but the full potential relishes on the night show. Capture some great views of Marina bay sands from here.
,,Iconic attraction to visit for free,4.0,,In the center of Gardens by the bay a great centre piece. light show where the trees flash in different colours in the evening which is free to watch. one show at 1945 and another 2045.
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"This is something really unique for Singapore, so anyone who comes to Singapore must visit Supertree grove."
,,"Like a mix of avatar, Alice in wonderland & star wars",4.0,,A beautiful place to walk around in. The night view is spectacular with the Avatar-like trees and the Marina Bay Sands boat scyscraper in the background. DON'T MISS the roof top bar in one of the trees!
,,A MUST Visit when in Singapore,5.0,,"The light and synced music show which occurs twice a night is a must see. Extremely impressive, and free to watch from ground level."
,,A must do,5.0,,"This was the highlight of our experience at Gardens By the Bay. Something very clever about the structures, the up high walkway, the views (especially of the hotel and the ferris wheel). We spent the full time we could up there and didn't get bored."
,,Evening show is a MUST see.,5.0,,The evening show is great. Lay down on one of the super trees and enjoy the light and music show. Changing theme and topics.
,,Definitely worth walking around,5.0,,"It's nice to see in the day and see it light up at night. The nightly show was just ok, but doesn't take long to go check it out."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Just amazing and beautiful twice a night and worth a look. there is no cost for this and the lighting synced to music was beautiful.
,,Simply Amusing,5.0,,If you wish to amuse yourself by the way Singapore takes care of its flora and fauna then you must sit under this supertree grove
,,Christmas a hit!,5.0,,We visited the Supertrees a few weeks before Christmas and got to enjoy this spectacular site with Christmas decorations and music enhancing its year-round beauty. Very cool!
,,"to be seen at night, a must",4.0,,"if your going to see nature this century, see it here, its a fantastic blend of every sense rolled into one experience."
,,Was a bit disappointed,3.0,,"Went there while they had like a Christmas special and there was a ticket required to visit the place. My friends who live in SG said there's usually no tickets in going there. My friends paid for my ticket and when we went to watch the light show it was underwhelming for us. Even my friends said that it wasn't as spectacular compared to their usual light show considering that we paid tickets for this one. However there we're other sights to see in the area, they had like a winter wonderland theme so it was cute. But the light show itself which can be considered as the highlight of the place wasn't really that great at that time."
,,Great Scenery,4.0,,"If you visiting the Gardens, be sure to go up to the SuperTree Grove! The ticket price to go up is $5 per person, you can stay up there for as long as you like. The bridge oversees the entire Marina Bay and it's pretty windy on a normal day.

One suggestions would be to go during weekdays if you don't like crowds and you definitely can more at ease to appreciate the plants and flowers!"
,,Excellent evening show,4.0,,"The show in the evening is great fun. Music and lights choreographed to the super trees. No tickets required, all free, just find a spot with a clear view."
,,Fabulous and well worth the visit,5.0,,The Singaporians are a very cleaver culture. The work that has gone into these trees and the display at night is outstanding. A well worth a visit and take the time to look around at the plants covering all the structures.
,,Supertree grove,5.0,,"This ust be see when you visit Singapore . it’s amazing beauty garden you can’t missed it when you visit Singapore . Supertree Grove is good for family relaxing for everyone,especially at night time.The lighting is incredible."
,,Satisfy your curiosity,4.0,,As you travel around Singapore you are bound to catch a glimpse of these structures. It's worth the visit as it's surrounded by gardens and a relaxing way to spend a few hours. They are spectacular to look at and light up at night.
,,engineering marvel,5.0,,one of the most modern and architecturally brilliant piece in singapore..must see place when you are in town
,,Super!,5.0,,"This was surprisingly fun, especially walking the elevated path through the trees. The engineering was so well done I almost didn't pay attention to all the amazing flora."
,,Unique experience,5.0,,We timed the end of our evening to catch one of the light shows. There are two per evening I believe but well worth hanging around for if you are in the area. Finding the best place to watch from takes a little skill. Try the the balcony that overlooks the grove for a clearer view of the whole thing.
,,the great combine of ECO & turism,4.0,,"was there during the Christmas Holiday, a bit sad that the center was blocked for celebrating the Christmas (which didnt mentioned on the website.. and no other way to buy the tickets with all the locals bought them much more earlier ...."
,,a must see.... at night,5.0,,"Still have not had the patience to wait in the queue for tickets, but just walking through here at night with them all lit up is pretty majestic!"
,,A bit of pointless good fun.,3.0,,"OK, so its a good idea to create interest in climbing plants and rainforest trees, with the added opportunity of view from the tree top height downwards. But yet again, we found ourselves asking was the, admittedly quite remarkable, engineering really enhancing our understanding of plant life, or was it merely just a bit of a gimmick?
There are some outstanding views from the 25 foot high platforms, right across to the docks, and the river.
To our eyes, the Supertree Grove is little more than a bit of pointless good fun made possible by a lot of investment and creating a market for it."
,,Absolutely Fantastic,5.0,,S$8/person to go around is really worth the money when you go during the light display starts at 19:45 hrs. Great view of Garden by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
,,Should do,4.0,,"Excellent area to be as sun goes down, if you time seeing first show at 7.40 pm you can grab a drink and food and then see second show at 8.40 pm Short stroll from marina bay and marina precinct.
Will do again next time in Singapore."
,,A work of wonder!,5.0,,This place is simply amazing. I feel like I am transported into the world of avatar or an alien world. It is even more mesmerizing at night when the trees are lit with various colours to show off the plants on them and at that point you feel like you are in the movie AVATAR!
,,tall trees twinkling,5.0,,A unique and beautiful experience. The trees appear real until you look closer and see how they have been fashioned.
,,Exquisite,5.0,,Amazing structure & such a mesmerizing view. The light and sound show is spectacular. Do make sure you visit Gardens by the Bay in the evening so you get to experience the show which is totally free.
,,Magnificent,5.0,,We were there just as the sun was setting. It is one the views that you will never forget. Totally worth visiting.
,,Futuristic gardens,5.0,,"The Christmas market and funfair were good but very crowded and expensive to get in.
The supertree Christmas light show was excellent, including the fake snow!
The trees are so futuric and with plants growing from the trunk of the trees they look like an alien species.The bar at the top of one tree is awesome and has brilliant views of some of the buildings."
,,Great Architect,4.0,,awesome concept and architect. You can enjoy the sunset and view by walking round the bridge over the super trees..
,,space like experience,5.0,,We were there during Christmas and new year. The place had more decorations then usual. It is magical like many things in Singapore. Very unique sculptures.
,,Overpriced but the night show is worth waiting for,3.0,,"What you see in the pictures is what is there. You pay (what I believe to be) a large amount to go up an elevator and walk along a catwalk - and you've only got a limited time as there is a maximum number of people allowed up there.

That said, the free night show was fantastic. Aimed towards children with its bright colours and animations, it still easily drew a thousand strong crowd of all ages. I would recommend this part."
,,Fantastic but not for the faint hearted,5.0,,"Let me start by saying I cant stand heights but manage going up. Its a must do thing, as the walkways and views are fantastic. The area is beautiful anyway, and this gives some perspective to it all. Cheap and not too busy although its...More"
,,See the grove at night,5.0,,Odd tree structures but when you see them lit up during the night they really are beautiful. There is a light show at 9 pm not sure if they do it any earlier which is nice to see.
,,Stunning,5.0,,This is a must to put on any itinerary in Singapore. Well worth the visit. Allow a few hours to wander around. Easy to get to. Make sure to go at dusk when you can see the lights coming on.
,,Special walk at night,5.0,,The music light show at Supertree Grove is definitely a MUST if you visit Singapore. It is fantastic!!! The music and the light show: Great!
,,Colourful,4.0,,A night visit to this place is a must. Could not walk on the Ariel bridge due to rain. A magnificent place to wonder through and admire a spectacular view of the city and unique landscape.
,,Magnificent..Go see it.,5.0,,Heard about this place but never visited it whenever I returned to the Far East for the holidays until my nephew insisted that I go see it.. honestly I was not keen on it until I got there myself..WOW it was really out of this...More
,,Amazing Light Show,5.0,,We visited a night with the express purpose of viewing the light show. It was decorated for Christmas and beautiful.
,,No natural trees so artificials will do!,5.0,,Amazing how (having an idea) you can attract people from all over the world! The shows at 7.45 and 8.45 - music and lights are really spectacular. If you look at those trees during the day - they just look terrible - plastic and nothing...More
,,Nice but a lot less impressive than advertised,3.0,,"Worth seeing it during the day and at night, attending one of the two shows held daily. Shows consist of music playing and trees lighted up at the rhythm of famous tunes, but certainly not spectacular in comparison with available technology nowadays, including lasers, projections...More"
,,Looks Stunning,5.0,,"Looks stunning from the bottom, but what a view you get from the top, I believe it is absolutley stunning at night when all lit up, but we missed it"
,,amazing,5.0,,amazing landscape amazing gardens a breathtaking futuristic experience not to be missed...if cannot all the gardens go to the trees
,,Must see Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Exceptional creation of man's ingenuity ,beautiful man made trees covered with all kinds of foliage a stunning sight to behold ..must see when in Singapore"
,,Definitely a worthwhile stop!,5.0,,Pretty and informative wonder with a great lights show at certain times in the evening. Lots of people but not too crowded to enjoy the best. Prepare for a long wait to get on the Skywalk.
,,Day and night spectacular,5.0,,Both the day and night visit to this sight are a must. Unfortunately we couldn't take the walk across the aerial bridge as it was closed due to thunderstorm activity but cost is $8 / adult. A magnificent place to wonder through and admire a spectacular and unique landscape.
,,A little boring.,2.0,,The place was decorated for Christmas but it did look headachy and not very Christmassy. A stunning sight to see though!
,,Absolutely amazing during Christmas festivities,5.0,,We went to the Supertree Grove during Christmas and the lights and festive mood were amazing. this is a must to do in Singapore
,,Mesmerizing Urban trees,5.0,,"This is one of a kind place, never seen anything like this. And the best part, it is FREE! :D
Yes, these trees are free to see for your eyes, it is the entry to the domes that is charged. So if you are on a very tight budget, you have no excuse to miss this place.
Behind the Marina Bay Sands, these giant Super trees are bound to catch your eye!
They are an architecture marvel and can be stared at for hours together.
They have a light and sound show that happens everyday at 7.45 and 8.45 (again FREE, can you believe it!) which should not be missed at any cost. You will see a crowd starting to gather about 15 mins before, thats your cue. Grab a good spot! (Suggestion: take the ones close to the ticketing counter) and lie down on the floor to ensure you don't miss a single second of the 10 min show.
There is an OCBC skywalk between the trees. That is charged at S$8. Totally worth it. They let you go on for about 15 mins. It is worth every second. An amazing view of the Marina and the Singapore skyline. Again, a night thing, its better with all the lights around. Make sure you view the show from the bottom and not from the skywalk.
It does get super crowded on Sunday evenings, so keep that in mind.
Do visit this place in the evening, and do not miss it at any cost. After all, it's going to cost you nothing."
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"Beautiful structure during the day and even more beautiful during the night when lit up. I would personally recommend experiencing this by strolling along the OCBC Skyway an aerial bridge between 2 supertrees. Its all the way in and quite a walk from the domes, but totally worth it. It costs an additional 8S$ for an adult. But its guarantees a view which you cannot get anywhere else. A great way to enjoy nature at top. There is even a roof top restaurant at the top of one of the supertrees called 'IndoChine'. Where you can enjoy your meal with a view of the gardens as well as the skyline of Singapore."
,,Always a fun visit there when in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a great place to bring visitors from out of town or if you are from out of town. The light show, as many have said, is very nice. It's still nice during the day but this is more for a dusk visit. Get there around 6pm and stay for the light show. I found that there is a nice viewing area along the walkway directly above all the restaurants. You'll have to curve around to the ticketing side of Gardens by the Bay to access it. It's a nice bird's eye view."
,,Better views at night,5.0,,"Looks great in the night, especially during the light and sound show. At that time, it may get very crowded too."
,,"Fantastic idea, well worth a walk in the 'tree-tops'",5.0,,"A nicely different way to be outside. You need a ticket, and there may be queues, but well worth it."
,,So beautiful- even the free parts!,5.0,,Do come here- these are spectacular! You can walk around the park for free and see two light shows (7:45 and 8:45). The are beautiful even when they aren’t showing off. The walkway above will cost you $8 and closes at 9:00. The bar/eatery at the top has a $20 cover charge that includes one drink.
,,Visit at night,4.0,,"It is not so much interesting at the day time. At rainy days, walking platform is closed. Best pictures can be taken at the are after the park main entrance"
,,Christmas light show.,5.0,,"We went there at night and arrived at the grove just in time to see the light and music show. It is no top of the range theatrical production, but, it is very good.
As the weather was not the best (rained all day) there was not a huge crowd. This made the experience even better. It costs nothing to see and is worth the effort. There is a shuttle bus that drops off at the domes and the grove is not Fay away from them.
Overall, a pretty spectacular place and we will go back in the day time for another perspective."
,,Visit at night....,5.0,,"The grove is at its best at night, particularly if you manage to be on the walkway when the light show is on. Stunning Singapore icons, covered in flora, light up in time to the music. This was a lovely start to the Christmas season"
,,Great light show,4.0,,"Located next to Marina Bay Sands, this place is worth a visit. I highly recommend you all to come and night to view the lightings at night. The entrance is free of charge to view the light show. There are certain timing for the light show as well. Do catch it and don't miss it. It is better to visit this place in the evening to catch the beautiful sunset and it is more cooling to walk around the area."
,,Mesmerised,5.0,,"Look, we went to see the light show with every other person possible. I didn't care that I was hot or that it was crowded or that it was even a little cheesy. I loved it. My older kid enjoyed it. The four yr old had just been fed some rubbish that came with a free toy and she was more engrossed with that then the show.
We actually cannot wait to go back to the entire Gardens in the bay to explore everything. So much to see and do around there."
,,Not really something worth spending money to see,3.0,,We saw the super tree grove from a distance when we went there for the light and sound show in the evening. If you go during the day time there is nothing too spectacular - at least not worth paying the entry fee. One can instead take a walk around the park and see the beautiful flowers and other species of fauna. It is located right opposite the Marina Bay Sands hotel.
,,HUGE trees,5.0,,Wandered around underneath these trees during a very hot and humid afternoon. Meant to return one evening to see them lit up but ran out of time as there's so much to see and do in Singapore.
,,overview,5.0,,very attractive and innovative way of getting a birds eye view of the city......windy but one must give full marks for the beauty and maintaince of the supertree
,,NOT GOOD,3.0,,"Average , not good to see.... nothing have there actually Cash weste item in singapore, entry fee 10 doller, on the tree top 8 doller again u need to pay..."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Car park is not free However the light show is simply stunning and completely free. Please time your visit too You’d need to pay if you like to go up to the ocbc skywalk
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"Awesome View, great sight, a must watch, there is a souvenier shop nearby, you can grab some stuff, washroom facility also available."
,,Excellent place to visit - one of the few places with out any entry fees,5.0,,"Well, I feel that this is one of the very few places in Singapore without any entry fee. Best time to visit is during evening as they do a show with the trees and their lights called as ""Rhapsody"". For the first timers, you will have an excellent experience. A must visit place in Singapore. From this place Marina bay sands and marina bay area is quite near by and walk able . So plan your visit accordingly."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Felt like we were in the Avatar movie. They're absolutely beautiful. The park is so clean. Teamed with Christmas lights display, it was magical."
,,Time your visit,4.0,,"If you want to be up there when the light show is on, then be aware that you will be restricted to around 15 minutes upstairs as the staff are required to move people along due to number restrictions. NB the light show did not start at the suggested time on our visit!"
,,wow,5.0,,"a must to see , if one dose not see any thing at all while in Singapore you should go here , I wont say to much more as one needs to see for there own eyes"
,,Brilliant marketing but basically an elevated walkway and some lights,1.0,,"Given Singapore is mostly a commercial city rather than a cultural one, the Supertree Grove has little competition. That said, this was on my bucket list. Done it but would not recommend or go back.

From afar, it looks magical. The lights as seen from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel are lovely. But up close it is just a series of concrete towers with steel outer frames. And the Skyway is just a path connecting a few of these. There is limited educational content.

Be aware that rain in Singapore means the Skyways are closed.

Over the holiday season they set up a winter wonderland park which is just your standard set of stalls selling food and a few small games of skill around a theme.

In other parks this would be one of just many attractions on offer."
,,good place for photography in the evening,3.0,,this place is also close to the garden by the bay and looks amazing in the evening and looks great with lighting. The light makes the location even more amazing.
,,Not to be missed on trip to Singapore,5.0,,Plan the time properly. Do not worry about taxi or bus after the light and song show at noght is finished.
,,Impressive,4.0,,"Supertree Grove of Singapore is very impressive structure. I visited in the evening. Light and sound show was very attractive,"
,,marin bay gardens,5.0,,this is part of the marina bay gardens...well lighted awesome trees with a sky way on which we can view the singapore skyline
,,Excellent light show with coordinated music.,5.0,,"They look nice in the daytime too, but they really stand-out at night. 19:45 and 20:45 is when the music and light show happens. It included Christmas music, which felt a little different in Singapore's hot weather since we are used to snow at Christmas. If you watch both light shows, try to watch one lying down at the base of a supertree, it's really different. The skyway ($8) is nice, but watch the closing time, because it sold out the first time I tried to buy tickets. Last skyway tickets sold at 20:00 and last admission at 20:30, must leave by 21:00. So you could see the sound and light show from the skyway."
,,EVERYONE'S BUCKET LIST,4.0,,Great for 2-3 hours of indoor and outdoor strolling and gazing! These Super Trees are a must-see! One tree even has a bar and restaurant inside! Don't miss it.....see it up close either day ir night........I prefer the nights!
,,An absolute must see,5.0,,"A large parkland with a lot to see. You can easily spend 1/2 a day here. Easily accessible by taxi/ Uber. The highlight is the indoor rainforest. Amazing structure that houses it. A surprise was the food at the food court, it is really high quality."
,,A wow,5.0,,"This amazing grove took our breath away when the lights lit up. We were on an evening tour and experienced a beautiful light show of magical music dancing to the sounds of Garden Rhapsody, the light colours danced around us and the vertical garden. This is incredible, how Singapore has used these towers for environmentally sustainable solar energy towers and have made this area into a stunning tourist attraction. Well done Singapore."
,,A must-see area of Singapore,5.0,,This is one of the places in Singapore everyone need to visit. Go here in the evening and experience the water-show at the same time!
,,Supertree Grove,5.0,,"Supertree Grove has a beautiful scenery.We went there to see the light show,but we went there a little too early.But it was worth the wait the lighting and sound was perfect.I would give it 5 out of 5 stars.The beautiful Supertree Grove is waiting for you to come."
,,Excellent display,5.0,,Make sure that you stay and watch the nightly lights display. Xmas time is a great time to visit this wonderul display.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Definitely worth a visit. The light and sound show are not to be missed. What a wonderful attraction.
,,Amazing,5.0,,I went there during Christmas season with a special light show for Christmas. It really amazing if I have enough time I wish I could go there everyday. You cannot never miss this place when visiting Singapore.
,,"Nice views, but a short visit",3.0,,"Nice views from teh top, but the visit wont last long. In 15 minutes you will have seen everything from the walkway."
,,Beautiful night lights,5.0,,This was one of our top highlights of the trip.very spectacular to see lit up at night. A pleasant place to visit .
,,Stunning and beautiful at night,4.0,,"When the trees light up at the night, you will be amazed by how beautiful and stunning it is of these Supertrees. You definitely will not want to miss this.

The light show is fantastic as well. Definitely recommend to come and check this iconic structure of Sigapore."
,,Beautiful arhitecture,5.0,,The plantation at the pile was amazing. The view was very beautiful. And the environment was great. Fresh air and good restaurant nearby.
,,Experience this at night,4.0,,"After walking around Marina Bay, my family and I went to the Supertree Grove at night. There was a Star Wars light show happening. Its way better to see the trees at night because of the lights and the cool atmosphere. Long lines to head to the bridge, but the view is worth it."
,,We are in the future guys...,5.0,,"What lovely creations by the people of Singapore. You feel that you are in future. And they have to be seen in evenings only - the lights, the musical show. Take woolens."
,,Pleasant surprise these tall lit trees,4.0,,"The trees were already lit. I didn't know there would be a light show as well. It was very pretty and done to music. We didn't go all the way into the Grove where, I hear, there was even more to see."
,,nice show,4.0,,timing are eveninig when its get dark.you can seat in ground or stand up on balcony.nicely done dont miss to see a great show here.walking distance to marina bay
,,Beautiful,5.0,,A visit to Gardens by the bay is incomplete without viewing supertree grove. Well constructed supertrees which glows during the night show. The christmas wonderland added to the charm
,,Simply Stunning.,5.0,,"This site is absolutely mind blowing. It is made up of man made columns made out to be super trees & it works magically.
The trees are huge,whilst we were there they were being decorated with Christmas lights,a great pity we could not stay to see them. However,we did see them illuminated at night from a distance,they were absolutely stunning but fitted the Singapore skyline.
If you see them prepared to be fascinated by their grandeur."
,,Neat little part of the Gardens,3.0,,"These are a really neat idea nestled into the Gardens. We didn't do the walkway, but you could see these all over the Garden"
,,Must see!! Nice Lighting show!,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is a part of Gardens By the bay and looks amazing post dark when the Light show starts. There are two shows post 7.45 I think (don't remember).. You can lie down on the Ground and have a great view and witness teh Light and music show on these Supertrees. You may also chose to pay for OCBC skywalk and talk a round which is a bridge that passes through these trees. If in Singapore, one must visit this place!"
,,Something special,5.0,,"You cannot visit gardens by the bay and not see the Supertrees. Especially at night when they have a show. Although the show itself is not that good, it is still something you do not want to miss. Don't forget to do the sky walk (separate ticket)."
,,Architecture Intelligence looks beautiful at Night,5.0,,I really liked to see the iconic structure of singapore because of this Super tree. During the day it looks amazing but at night this place is at its best specially during the Light show.. Definitely recommending all to visit this one
,,Stunning at Night,5.0,,"I loved this place, especially at night when it is illuminated. Located in the Gardens at the Bay complex and can be reached by a skybridge from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel (& it's SMRT railway station). One of the advantages of accessing from the Hotel Skybridge is the panoramic views of the Gardens and Grove from the skybridge itself.

Lights are turned on at 7:45pm, entrance is free after 9pm ?? (check website). If possible combine with the Cloud Forest Dome (fee) which is also spectacular, wasn't so impressed with the Flower Dome.

Simply stunning, a must see."
,,Nice View,5.0,,It is better to you to visit it in the afternoon because the weather will be so comfort and you must go to Sky Way to see a good view.
,,Beautiful at night,5.0,,Beautiful lights and nice walk up in the trees! Go at the time of the rhapsody and enjoy music and lights.
,,Incredible Tree,4.0,,"This is an amazing artificial structured tree, the architects really knows how to make an outstanding garden and park that will amaze the visitors. The view really incredible, day or night, and the environment will make you appreciate the nature more. Good place for family and friends."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,These fake trees are actually solar panelled and produce electricity. They look really amazing and light up at night. Worth paying the money to walk between them. The Gardens are accessed via a bridge from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
,,Visited night & day,3.0,,"Stayed overnight on a cruise ship in the area, and took in the night light show (was synchronised to various X'mas carols and the various X'mas stalls were just starting to open).

Went back the next morning to explore the Gardens by the Bay which included a walk through the Supertree Grove (free) & also the elevated walking path (fee applies) through the Supertree Grove.

A great park, good at night & day, Easily accessed including by the MTR or from the Marina Bay Sands complex."
,,Didn't expect to like fake trees but this is awesome,5.0,,We visited during the Winter Wonderland set up and it is so cool! The lightshow in the evening is a must while in Singapore and is just so COOL. The whole place is a top notch operation and the scale is truly impressive. There are tons of little side venues throughout the area as well. Bring an umbrella if it looks like rain!
,,WSorth the wait to get up the top.,5.0,,This is fabulous. Again it gives you stunning views of the gardens and surrounds. The rooftop bar is stunning and great drinks and food. If it rains then you go downstairs to the restaurant and enjoy it from there as well.
,,Simply amazing,5.0,,"The 20th floor bar is amazing place. Overlooking Singapore. But visit the place at night. Its a bit of expensive but the view,,argh all worth of dime."
,,Great for a relaxing evening,4.0,,Was there for a gathering with some friends and relatives and stayed for the night show. Every evening they have a musical show with the supertrees lighting up to music. The night I went was during the lantern festival and they were playing music related to the moon. Definitely a great place to visit if you have some time to relax and sit/lay under the trees.
,,Wheelchair accessible garden,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is within the Gardens by the Bay and a must see attraction, especially at night when there is a free music & light show. This venue is very wheelchair accessible with accessible toilets, concrete pathways and there was plenty of room to be able to see the night show even with the large crowds when we were there."
,,magic athmosphere,5.0,,Walking through these trees you seem to be in fairytales. The athmosphere is magic and the giant trees
,,interesting statues etc,5.0,,if it is not too hot a really fun place to walk around. Kids would like the dinosaurs etc. Adult appreciate the work that it would take to make the different plant shapes
,,Excellent,5.0,,If you only visit one place in Singapore - make it this one. Spectacular sculptures in such a peaceful setting. Great photographic opportunities both day & night.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Supertree grove is a must visit place in Singapore. Their light show is absolutely amazing to watch.
,,Incredible,5.0,,These are the most amazing structures. You need to take a tour so you can understand what they are and how they work. They produce solar power and in the future will help power more high rise. They are stunning to look at. Well done again Singapore
,,Something different,4.0,,"Hey, this is one of those things once you've done it you've done it; but it is worth doing at least once!"
,,A landmark,3.0,,"A very interesting sculptured forest, with a restaurant at the top (expensive and just ok), but unless you're doing photography (best to go late in the evening for that) it's visible from the cloud forest (inside, where it's not hot :)"
,,Spectacular light show to music.,5.0,,This is a Spectacular light show to music. Worth waiting for at approximately 7.30pm. Many people flock down to see the show but you can see even if at the back of the crowd.
,,Free evening music and light show,5.0,,"You can go up to the catwalk observatory for $8pp; however it was closed due to weather so we did not get to experience it during the day. We came back at night for the free evening music and light show. They were playing some Christmas music during this time of the year. Even though there were a lot of ppl here, you can see the show up in the trees anywhere below nearby. After the show, it gets really crowded heading towards the SMRT station."
,,Amazing,5.0,,We visited Supertree Grove on our recent trip to Singapore. This place is absolutely stunning and well worth the visit. We went during the evening & seeing it all lit up was stunning. Highly recommend a visit.
,,Interesting architecture. Christmas market.,4.0,,"Visited in early December 2017. The place is setup for Christmas market with a ticket required to enter. Did not find much interest in the market as it did not have the mood nor the Christmas drink.
Additional ticket required to access the skywalk at the Supertree. Stunning view but duration is limited to 15min. Not for the fear of heights."
,,Great Experience,5.0,,This place must be seen both by day and night. At night they have a daily light show where you can watch from bellow the trees. This is part of the gardens so it's paid for.
,,Beautiful night lights,5.0,,Buy your entrance tickets for 8 SGD p.p. and walk around the super tree garden. Best moment is when it starts to get dark and you see the lights glowing. A must see in Singapore. You will see the Marina Bay next to it.
,,Simply Unreal,5.0,,Its one of the most unreal experience for me. With all the lights and sound i felt I was in Pandora from Avatar.
,,Looking sort of eerie!,4.0,,We thought in the evening but still worth seeing up close as you potter around the gardens. Some great attractions in this area. YMMV
,,Interesting as a part of the gardens,4.0,,"The tickets aren’t expensive and the views are worth it. Nice panoramas around the city, so if you are already in the gardens have a look"
,,good to seee,3.0,,"kindly book the sky ride tickets early , bcoz due to bad weather it is closed any time, specially at night it looks better"
,,Another great free activity in Singapore,4.0,,"The Supertrees themselves are pretty impressive, but visit during the evening when they light up. There is a light show at 7:45 and 8:45 pm. It is a little ""Disney"" (meaning cheesy...) BUT at the same time it is so over the top enchanting that it is absolutely worth watching."
,,Visit to Supertree Grove,4.0,,"Best to go in the morning to avoid the crowd and hot sun! Worth the walk. If you wish to take picture, do visit in the evening."
,,A favorite,5.0,,This was one of our top highlights of the trip. So amazingly beautiful if you go at night. The sky walk is fantastic as well.
,,Magical,5.0,,"These Super Trees are attractive during the day, but fantastic at night. There's a nightly show here at 19.45 & 20.45 which is spectacular. We were lucky enough to be here to see it in October & November, Christmas theme for the November trip. The walkway between the trees is worthwhile as well."
,,Amazing creativity,5.0,,The lack of greenery in Singapore had made them to create artificially tall trees for better health care of residents and at the same time making it a huge favourite among the tourists. It's natural plantation artificially maintained so tall beautiful that is visible wherever in central singapore.the light show uses these supertree groves as base and they have separate tickets which can be purchased on spot wherein we can climb up such supertree by way elevator or stairs. Lovely pictures can be clicked and an amazing views of the skyline can be captured.
,,Very Avatar,4.0,,"Very other worldly with lots of greenery and nice plants in the day , very spectacular to see lit up at night. A pleasant place to visit ."
,,Feel like Avatar,3.0,,"I am not a big fan for this, but worth to pass by and take a photo as it is quite close to the Garden by the bay. The light show is better in the evening."
,,a unique experience,4.0,,"highly recommend you visit if you travel to singapore, especially at night. if you take half a day, you can see this along with the garden domes."
,,Great place to go and see. Free entry to Gardens,5.0,,"Worth going to the Gardens by the Bay area and seeing these Supertrees. The base/core is stell and concrete and they are more than 25m tall. These unique trees have various types of plants, hundreds, growing on them. There are orchids, and various climbing plants, The access to these trees are free, but if you want to go up on the long skyway connecting two trees to see the gardens and area from up high, then you have to pay. It is well worth seeing these beautiful trees at night as there is a great light and music show which is also free."
,,GOOD,4.0,,"I visit the groove in the morning, still good you can see all the plants, and feel the sun while you try to walk on the OCBC Skyway it worth it you can see marina sand hotel, singapore flyer from there."
,,singing trees - unique,5.0,,by night stunning the singing trees a defo on the must do list. You lie down on the ground to watch the trees singing !
,,Larger than expected,4.0,,A fantastic and diverse amount of plants in a larger than expected area. Plenty of things to see and so many different gardens.
,,Be sure and go to the Night Show,5.0,,We did not go this park in the day time because we wanted to see the Supergrove Night Show. The show lasted at least 30 minutes with changing/dancing lights to music. We viewed from the ground but there is an aerial walkway (for an additional charge) to view the show. You definitely want to go and see this.
,,Wow wow,5.0,,That's all i can say the theme was christmas and the music was terrific and when the trees light up its WOW I can't put it in words its a MUST SEE
,,beautiful,5.0,,sound & light show was wonderful no cost to watch it is an interesting place to visit we only watched from ground level but will go on the walkway next time we visit
,,spectacular,5.0,,"This is the only word I can think of describing this attraction. The place comes alive at night time. Did the walk in the 'tree tops'. It was amazing, albeit a bit scary for those of us who don't really like heights. But so glad I did it. Highly recommend it."
,,Amazing,5.0,,This place is amazing at night when the light show is on to music. There are lifts to the different levels where you can watch the trees.
,,A great night out for the tourist to see the fine light show around,5.0,,"We went on holiday here the other night and this is the subject of one of the compulsions we have but is forced to visit when spending a little longer in Singapore.
A great destination in the evening when everything is brilliantly illuminated.
I recommend the top of the tree-top restaurant built for dinner. The access cost 20 Singapore dollars and contained one drink.
There was a light lounge lounge in the restaurant, and the place was just a little fun while watching and wondering about the surrounding City."
,,A Bridge for a View,5.0,,This is at the Garden at the Bay .. They charge you extra to go up there on the bridge ... They take you to the top level and from there you walk along to have a beautiful view of the Garden .. Worth the time and money .. should not missed
,,Just beautiful and special place,5.0,,"Came in day and night and wow! The green and flowers in day and at night, the music show and light shows- wow!
Truly loved it and can’t wait to come back and spend more time in the gardens by the bay and super tree grove! Will check out the super tree restaurant next time!"
,,Good walk,5.0,,You go up in a lift to get to the walkway through the metal trees. I think it cost me $8 which was well worth it for the views.
,,Great pictures at night.,4.0,,Amazing structures. Lovely to walk around. Lit up at night .You can get the walkway part round which is about 8$ Stunning views of bay Not much shelter when it rains
,,Such Creativity!,4.0,,"I have Seen Close ups of the two Supertree as I walked through the Main Entrance to The Gardens By The Bay, And the Beautiful Collection of plants growing around these! Although I have not done a separate tour to see closeups or walk around The Supertree Grove, I love what I saw from a Distance and will Definitely make it a Part of My Itinerary next time I Tour Singapore again. Beautiful, Well Organized and Worth visiting City...time after time! I Recommend the Supertree Grove too!"
,,Great views,5.0,,Suspended walkway through gardens between Supertrees. Great views over the park and back towards the Marina Bay Sands
,,MUST SEE attraction - like nothing else in the world!!!,5.0,,"Large metal trees with plants growing on them - create an amazing area to visit during the day. Supertrees also have an elevated platform to walk on - all cable suspended. The largest tree has a restaurant on the top! Educational and artistic at the same time. The true magic happens at night, when thousands of LED lights transform the trees into an amazing sight. The lights change color and pattern. Twice a night there is a free sound and light show set to classical music - unbelievable. This is one of the best shows I have seen at night - reminded me of Disney but less crowded!"
,,Just so beautiful,5.0,,"How someone could of conceived this is amazing but so glad they did! These are impressive in daylight but at night they are stupendous. There are two light shows 7:45 and 8:45 and lasts for 10 mins. Get there early and walk around the smaller two - silver and gold. Then get to the super tree grove about 20 mins before the show, sit on one of the smaller trees looking at the end super tree (the one with the skywalk coming out of it). You will not be disappointed."
,,fantastic,5.0,,we came here on our first evening. We found the food place and had dinner outside and watched the light show. This is where I fell I love with Singapore
,,Must See Attraction,5.0,,These amazing structures located in the Gardens By The Bay are not to be missed during you visit to Singapore. Best seen at night when stunning photos can be taken.
,,Enchanting Light Show,5.0,,"Just loved these ""trees"", and every evening they run 2 (or 3?) light shows, for which you just plant yourself somewhere below any of them for 20 minutes or so. First one just after sunset. Up until a certain time, you can access the walkway. One tree has the entrance another tree has the exit (and take the opportunity to go down the stairs instead of the elevator). The light show is just as enchanting from up the walkway, as from down on the ground, so don't miss your opportunity to get up there.

Take your camera and tripod and wide-angle lens and get the dusk show, for best photos."
,,Supertree Grove,5.0,,This is definitely one of the coolest manmade creations that Singapore has to offer. The view by night is really nice & they have a light show every evening.
,,Beautiful at Night,5.0,,"Wow, its looks amazing after sunset when colors covers it. The Sound and Light show is amazing. A full day would be best to roam around all around the park and enjoy the garden."
,,An ingenious design to enhance the urban landscape,5.0,,These supertrees are.just stunning. Real plants growing on the framework create a harmony of technology and nature. Well worth the visit!
,,Best Free Atrraction,4.0,,"This is one of the free singapore-must-visit attraction, there are special lighting at 19.45 and 20.45. Wonderful place to take a stroll and take pictures. Btw the garden is huge, it is walkable but i will recommend to stroll using bicycle or electric scooter to cover the whole area.

Nearby there are a superb children garden for kids, it is free too and perfect place for them to get wet. Please take note it will close by 7pm on weekdays and 9pm on weekends.

Limited and expensive dining options, you can plan at nearby Suntec City which have wider choices and reasonable price.

Recommended iteneary:
1700 children garden
1830 supertree grove (day & night view)
1945 special lighting
2000 dinner at suntec city"
,,A must see when you visit Singapore,5.0,,"Words fail us to describe this - the sky walkway gives superb views over the bay. We went twice, once in the day and again on an evening to see the light show. Very incongruous - celebrating Christmas in tropical heat! Lovely."
,,Visit at night,5.0,,We visited during the moon festival and there was a special display put on for this occasion. Very beautiful though it was a bit of a challenge to get somewhere to sit/lie down.
,,awesome experience,5.0,,"We went to this grove in time for one of the evening shows, well worth the visit. The lights were so well timed with the music."
,,nothing special for us,3.0,,I guess we were spoilt as we were staying at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and our room looked down on this so we didn't benefit from the height of the supergrove walk. Having been to the Orchid Garden and Cloud Forest I thought the walk was expensive for what it was - you are only given 15 minutes but the views looking down on the garden are pleasant enough. The night time light show at 7.45 and 8.45 is good but overshadowed by the light show on the other side of the hotel in the marina at 8 and 9pm.
,,Wondering for an evening stroll or sit,5.0,,"Went for a walk here after dinner at the Marina Bay Sands. Although this is a futuristic garden there is a magical quality to it when you watch the light show in the evening. People sit or lay quietly taking in the changing lights and the range of music that accompanies the lights. The light show is from about 7.45 -9pm and you can watch it free. There is also an opportunity to walk through the Grove on a high raised walkway, though we didnt personally do this."
,,Wonderful feature,4.0,,"The supertrees are an amazing piece of architecture to go see.

We went at 5pm so we could see the trees and gardens during the day but also in the night.

The night show is very good. They have one at 7.45 and 8.45pm for 15mins. We watched the christmas show. Its a free. But gets very busy quickly so when we got there, a lot of people were sat on the floor as the benches were full.

Due to the hype and by watching the fountain show at the marina bay the day before, i was expecting some more dramatic experiences at the supertree. It was still amazing but i think the choice of music and transition effects between different music pieces werent very impressive.

If you had a choice between day or night, choose night!!"
,,Decked out for Christmas,4.0,,They have a light show that's set to Christmas music. I believe there are two evening shows - I know the one I saw was at 7:45p. It was nice to sit and watch the lights twinkle. Probably would've been even more spectacular if I could've been on the platform for one of the trees.
,,Thought I was on an alien planet!,5.0,,"At night the Supertree Grove is truly a sight to behold. The bold design and colours come together to create an otherworldly landscape that I have not seen elsewhere. During the day, particularly if it is overcast, the grove is not at its best, although still impressive. If you are only here during daylight hours I would concentrate on the rest of the Gardens by the Bay; there is plenty to see as they cover an extensive area (so leave enough time or come back for a second visit).

A suggestion: the Supertree Grove is good for creative night photography rather than the usual tourist ""person standing in front of X"" shots. Use your imagination!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,We visited Supertree grove two times. The first was at night where we saw the light show which was very beautiful and during the day we did the tree top walk which offered stunning views of the city. It should not be missed while in Singapore!
,,manmade mystic beauty,4.0,,It's weird yet beautiful. It is a piece of art that keeps you engrossed. Yes it should be on your bucket list.
,,Best giantic garden,5.0,,"I have visited and how amazing in there, i love it so much, u have to prepare stamina cause walking so long make u tired"
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Very well organized the way of Disney park but very impressive, the walk through this nature museum, the view around of the city , don't miss the stop (20$SG per person) at the Indochine rooftop bar, this place is really unique experience.!!"
,,Spectacular Night Lights,4.0,,"I would definitely recommend this place to visit, especially at night with the spectacular lights. Beautiful gardens and a great restaurant. souvenir shop as well."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"This place has a very nice view, in addition to refreshing eyes, this place also has many spots to take pictures and of course this place is unique and unfortunately to be missed if we are strolling arround in Singapore."
,,Must DO,5.0,,"We paid a small fee, to go up on the Suspension Bridge, this was fantastic, glad we did it, the view was fantastic"
,,Lovely,5.0,,Lovely garden on reclaimed land. Extremely well maintained and very well approachable from all Marina buildings.
,,Mesmerising,5.0,,A magical place to spend the evening. The trees are futuristic and beautifully lit with a gorgeous range of colours.
,,A very nice place to visit in the evening,5.0,,"We went there at dusk, therefore we can see both the day and night views of the grove.

I would say the night view is very striking with all the trees powered with lights.

Many tourist visit this place as well as the locals jogging around."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"We walked the Supertree grove, very interesting, we where unable to go up due to storms. We combined with the othe attractions close by so we'll worth a day out to take a look."
,,Always has be awestruck,5.0,,"I simply love this place. It is so serene and beautiful. The way the light falls onto the ""trees"" at night and makes them look fluorescent is just magical."
,,DREAMWORLD,5.0,,It creates an Dreamworld with the lighting and music effects at night .They are truly super trees as per the name .
,,Worth a look,4.0,,Beautifully designed and very interesting to learn how the super trees work. Reasonably priced add on otherwise the gardens are free to walk around in and easy access to get there
,,Nice Place to Wander Around,4.0,,The Grove is an outdoor garden with metal trees that you can walk between on elevated walkways. We had a nice time at the bar on the top of the largest tree with great views of the city.
,,Fantastic at night,5.0,,"In the light of day, it might be an interesting piece of architecture, but at nite, with the lights on, it is a fantastic sight. And, it is free too. Best way to get here is the SMRT."
,,Beautiful Day and Night,5.0,,On the afternoon I went on the skywalk which was really great but quiet scary :) and in the evening it's great to see the light and music show! Such a beautiful place.
,,Unique experience,5.0,,Doesn’t cost a great deal and is an amazing experience would be a shame to go to the gardens and not do this.
,,pretty,4.0,,Very pretty when light up. A famous attraction so lot of tourist. Come once enough for me. Visited on Nov 2016.
,,This is so pretty,5.0,,"Go later in the day, see the 2 Flower Domes and stay until dark to see the lights on the trees etc. NOT expensive day."
,,Kinda cool.,3.0,,"Something to see and instagram... but grows tedious after not that long, maybe because they aren't real trees. :)"
,,Fabulous grove particularly atnight,4.0,,"The supertree grove is truly lovely, particularly at night when they light up. The Marine Bay area is such a nice place to visit and is well thought out. Singaporeans are very proud of it. In a country full of people and buildings, it provides an amazing park area to walk around and enjoy."
,,So pretty for the evening show.,5.0,,A main feature of Gardens by the Bay. Visit early to mid afternoon to see the Cloud Forest and Flower dome before the spectacular sunset and light show
,,Come alive at night,5.0,,Great place to see during night time only. Be sure to plan atleast an hour to enjoy it leisurely. Not much enjoyable from up.
,,Evening walk is a lovely way to see the garden lit up.,5.0,,Be sure not to miss the fireworks set to music. It's a interpretation of a modern utopian garden that is a little like something one would see at Disney or Epcot. Very well executed and interesting for plant lovers.
,,Different and Clever,4.0,,Amazing light show. We did as part of a tour. Well worth seeing. We walked up to the path above the restaurants and you get a better view. Just go and enjoy
,,Fairy lights galore,5.0,,My favourite attraction in Singapore. Go both day and then again at night to see the light display. An engineering marvel.
,,Impressive light show,4.0,,"Went to watch the light show (Christmas theme in early November) at 7.45 one evening. It was free (costs S$8 to watch from amongst the trees - overheard it is better from the ground anyway).

The show was 15 mins and set to various famous Christmas songs. My fiancée was very impressed with the choreography of the lights within the show - it was like the trees were dancing. I'm sure kids would love it.

Would recommend getting to the Cloud Forest for about 6.15 then getting to see this as a bonus."
,,Gorgeous and fascinating,5.0,,See it at night... the musical presentation and the lights are extraordinary! And then look close-up and realize that the bromeliads are alive - so cool!
,,Super,5.0,,"Gardens by the Bay is a must do whilst in Singapore and the Supertree Grove is something not to be missed. There is a charge of $8 to to on the skywalk, which is worth it just for the views over the city."
,,Good location to view the surrounding area from,3.0,,"Although you were only entitled to stay up there for 15 minutes, the time was adequate and the sun was baking hot"
,,Unforgettable!,5.0,,"Maybe I was completely struck with this outstanding performance because I didn't know what to expect. The fact is that this turned into the very highlight of 7 days visit to Singapore. Some people may say it was a bit kitschy, all those changing colors ... but for me it was unique experience! Professionally done up to perfection! Fantastic choice of music synchronized with change of lights intensity and colors ... WOW!"
,,OK for a long walk but No,3.0,,This attraction is too artificial IMHO. I spent too much time getting from one thing to another and then there were queues..
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,Going here was like visiting a movie set. The 'trees' are unbelieveable. A must see on any visit to Singapore!
,,Awesome,5.0,,The lights and music were very good. The Christmas music had just started for the year. Very busy. Some people brought picnics and sat and watched.
,,Super Tree,4.0,,"Visited Supertree Grove in the evening and can be combined in a day trip to Gardens by the bay, Cloud Dome and Flower Dome. There is a light show at about 7:40 pm. Good place to enjoy. We say under one of the trees. To enjoy the show, I would prefer to sit at a distance so that more number of trees can be seen at a time."
,,Visit to Singapore,5.0,,Nice Place for night roaming.. full of lights and shows. This is the 3rd time I went to Singapore. Wonderful!
,,Beautiful Sky Walk,5.0,,Evening visit is best time specially when the fire work show is to begin. Adjust the entry timing to enjoy the Sky walk and fire work display
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,This place is just out of this world. Is great to see day and night and a must do when in Singapore. Highly recommended.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Not to be missed. The visit to Gardens by the Bay is fabulous. Best time to visit is in the evening when it is much cooler.
,,Wow,5.0,,Unbelievable the light show at night is a must see during the day is just as spectacular and the sky walk gives some nice views
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"The gardens by the bay is a must-see attraction in Singapore! One cannot see it! It is such a green world inside. The exotic plants and designs are beyond my imagination. The Supertree Grove and arboretum are signatures of Singapore sightseeings!

Do note that the park itself is free! You do not need to pay anything to go in the park and appreciate nature. However, to get on the skywalk around Supertree, one needs to pay, and there is sometimes a small line. One can also get a shuttle service to go to Supertree, but I preferred walking.

At 7:45, 8:45, and 9:45, there is a light show at the Supertree Grove. To see the show in the grove, one needs to get there early. To catch the first show at 7:45, one should consider get to the Supertree area around 6:30 to secure a good spot. There is a ton of people as one would expect. Don’t underestimate how many tourists there are even during weekdays!

The gardens are connected with the Marina Bay Sands aka the three-building structure connected by a boat looking garden on top. After the light show, I recommend one go to the Marina Bay Sands. There are many shops, big and small, and a great food court! Good spots to have a quick meal before the water light show by the bay at 9pm and 10pm.

Recommend time spent in the area - 3-4 hours."
,,Loved it and wanted go spend more tine,5.0,,Waaay cool to visit but too hot to stay very long in early November due to humidity! You find yourself with whiplash as your head and neck are continually stretched to the limit trying to see it all. A lovely promenade and very enjoyable experience!
,,Unexpected delight,5.0,,"Funny how new things pop up in Singapore. We espied this from the Marina Sands Observation deck, and you can access this from floor 15 and walk across the bridge to this very delightful sight. We were there in the daytime, must have been even moe enjoyable at night with the lights on.

However, we decided to do the tree walk. To access this you enter a lift in one of these trees, so well disguised and then we walked along the tree walk. it was lovely how much effort was put into these ""trees"".

After spending time up there, got the lift back down and went to sit in the gardens. There are chairs spread around the gardens, which were quite comfortable, better than a park bench, there were also some shops selling drinks and eats and a restaurant. It appeared that at night there were some stalls but these were closed during the day. It was lovely and peaceful especially in the Singapore heat."
,,Magical visit,5.0,,Beautiful at night. twice per night there is a wonderful light to music show worth the visit. We then walked the skywalk and had a drink ontop of the supertree. the views were worth the cost.
,,Night time visit,4.0,,We visited in the evening after we had been in to the Cloud Dome. It was a magical experience as most people were just lying down looking up at the trees as they came to life with there wonderful colours and fantastic musical arrangement. Even our 12yr old boy was enchanted by the light and sound show. A must visit.
,,Very cool - Free experience,5.0,,"We first saw this from the restaurant in the Super Tree, so our view was looking down at everyone and the laser show from above...not as good as the next time we saw it from directly underneath. It runs x2/day and seems you may want to be there early to choose your best spot. Keep looking down when walking at night as people tend to lie on the ground to look at to view (best spot), so you don't want to trip over anyone. 3rd time we saw was from the other side of city in Singapore Flyer.. Though you will need to time that either by fluke or by perfection (by the time you line up, it goes up, and is in the right position for you to view.)"
,,Stunning night light show,5.0,,"Stunning display in a great setting. We experienced the 15 minute light show with a music rhapsody based on ""moon"" songs."
,,A great and colourful display,5.0,,The supertrees range from 8 to 16 stories high and function as water collectors and solar power generators as well as vertical gardens. Each evening there is a remarkable light show that lasts about 20 minutes per session. I believe there are three sessions each evening.
,,Nice view of Singapore,5.0,,"My Kids and I went to the Supertree grove recently and they really like it, very clean and safe place to enjoy a nice view."
,,Go to night show,5.0,,"Sound and light show is lovely, skip the tour, get a taxi(very cheap) just go in sit back and enjoy the music and the ever changing lights, and sparkle. Great experience !"
,,Beautiful end to the day,5.0,,The twice-nightly music and lights show in the super tree grove is a great finish to a day at the Gardens by the Bay. The combination of the music and the lights in the super trees is spectacular. Try to get there early to get a seat around he base of the trees so you can lie back and enjoy the show.
,,great,4.0,,"nice sight when the tree light up in the night , and they change colours, while there is music playing"
,,Interesting attraction unique to Singapore,4.0,,"A big tourist attraction, but is unique to Singapore and is worth the visit. Experience rare plants and trees in an interesting display. The nighttime light show is worth seeing. Grab a drink at the rooftop of one of the trees for a great view of the city."
,,Gorgeous light show,5.0,,Waiting till dark before visiting took see the light show. It's amazingly beautiful with the music and atmosphere. Just dazzling experienced not to be missed
,,Rooftop Bar,5.0,,"Go there in the evening, walk around admiring the light show, then go to the Supertree there is a door to a rooftop bar $20 entry but includes one free drink. Excellent view & open till after midnight. Apparently can be busy on weekends but we went about 10pm on a Thursday evening (had the place virtually to ourselves) spent a good hour or so enjoying our free drink & amazing view."
,,Best in the evening with full lights on,4.0,,Visit this place in the evening if you really want to enjoy the real beauty of this place. You can buy the tickets to go on the sky walk which is a good experience. These tickets are separate and not included with the tickets that you buy to see the domes.
,,Beautiful at night!,5.0,,It is very beautiful at night. It is another logo of Singapore (another is Merlion) that you should go. There is rivers and roads which is romantic for couples. The view always include Marina Bay Sands Singapore 3 buildings which is very good. The trees are tall and amazing. Good!
,,Amazing man made trees,5.0,,Just took so many photos of these giant man made trees full of growing plants. I walked along a walkway joining three of them Spectacular
,,Walk in the Clouds,5.0,,"A technological marvel when it comes to super trees, all that was missing was the spaceships and crew from the Avator to complete this futuristic park design."
,,Diwali visit,4.0,,too beautiful at night. Just sit & relax and watch the colorful display of lights. Great music at 7-30pm.
,,Light show in the evening,4.0,,Supertree Grove in Garden by the bay is the place where light shows happen every evening. A must visit
,,Visit In the night for a wonderful sight,5.0,,Situated in the Marina bay. what a beautiful creation. must visit in the nigh. beautiful with lights arrangements. Place for the entire family. Must visit place in Singapore. Can call the one of the best attractions in Singapore.
,,loved it,5.0,,"the Supertree Grove are part of the gardens by the bay,they actually catch water which is used in the cloud forest near by,night dusk or night is the best time to visit to see the amazing light show ,its really busy at the best bits theres music around a very well put together experience ,one I would easily come back to see again, well done Singapore!"
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay - What do you expect as title? - Strictly OK,2.0,,"Heavens, how many times do I have to write 'strictly ok'. Nothing much, just a big tower with creepers around it. Some light and sound show that is again strictly okay and nothing much to write home about. Go there if you are looking to strike off one off the to-do list from the Singapore travel list."
,,Wonderful sight but a bit crowded,4.0,,"The sight was wonderful especially the quirky daily light show in the evening. It is a bit crowded though so it was not comfy time for us to appreciate it as it is listed as a ""must"" for tourists. The place is also a bit far from public transport, so taxi stands are often having lines."
,,Just incredible!,5.0,,"Very much worth the visit! Go before the sun goes down and watch the trees transform. Be sure to stay for the show, it was a highlight of our entire trip!"
,,Magical Experience!,5.0,,"This was by far, one of the coolest things I've ever seen!
If you visit the Supertree Grove at late evening, there will be a light show, with music. Have a seat on the ground, look up to the trees and get enchanted with this magical experience! Must see!"
,,Night view a must.,5.0,,Walking around in the day is nice but go back at night and be amazed by the nice colours and view. Its very relaxing after a hot Singaporean day.
,,Love the Supertrees!,5.0,,"Love this part of Singapore, great to walk around, then go up to the skywalk and walk around the trees. Stay for the evening lightshow, the trees are lit up and the lights are set to music. Check for sunset times to know when the show starts."
,,Magnificent spectacle,5.0,,"Great to see these environmental structures that are beautiful and serve an important purpose in the gardens. Stay for the free evening light and music show, but make sure you are under the right supertrees , there are two groves. If there is not a crowd of people you are under the wrong ones."
,,Utterly amazing!,5.0,,We viewed this in the evening when the trees come alive with a light show and accompanying music - just spectacular!
,,stunning,5.0,,Just like you are taken to another world and maybe transported to an Avitar film set this was a magical experience for both me and my companion so much so we went every night of our 3 night visit to Singapore
,,Good light and sound,3.0,,Huge bunch of electric trees that look alike the Avatar movie. Another light and aound show in the center of Singapore. Easy access.
,,Has that WOW factor...,5.0,,"To really get the most from your visit here, make sure you go at night when they are lit up, an absolute sight to behold!"
,,Very Pretty and a must see while in Singapore,4.0,,We should of got there earlier to enjoy the scenery while the sun was still up. There is plenty to do and see. Fantastic light show - beautiful colours.
,,Best visited at night,4.0,,The ideal time to visit is after the light and water show in Marina Bay. You can walk through to the other side of Marina Bay and be in time to see the light show in the Supertree Grove
,,Part of the Garden by the Bay,5.0,,The decoraion is actually a steel structure decorated with real trees and flowwers.. there is a great laser show at 7.45 every night.. try and catch the same
,,Love it second time round,5.0,,I just love this place it is so colourful and out of this world I came back a second time with my Mum and adult sons
,,Stunning View,4.0,,"I went in the evening just as the sun was setting and the view was stunning. There is, however, a 30-minutes queue to the lift up the Supertree walkway, which I skipped. But the park itself is open to the public and is just about 5 minutes walk away from Marina Bay Sands."
,,Welcome to the future!,5.0,,"This can be very hot, so be sure to bring a hat, or parasol, but is totally worth it. Great views of the Marina Bay Gardens and surrounds, and what an amazing, wonderful, eco-friendly idea!"
,,Worth the night visit,5.0,,"Visited Gardens by the Bay during the day, which I absolutely loved. Wasn't sure whether to make the effort to go back for the night show where they light up this section, but so glad I did. I walked in the Supertree Grove during the day, but of a night it is even better. The colours and show is so good, so well worth the night visit."
,,Most curious Attraction,5.0,,"Giant trees made of steel that light up in the night is not the right way to describe this attraction but in reality this is what it is. The giant trees are covered with vines and lianas so completely camoflauge the steel frame work. The color changing lights come on in the night when the magic of these giant trees starts to work and transports the visitor into a magical space. When there, do take a walk on the skywalk and do not forget to go up to the restaurant on the top for a great night itme view of the bay and the city of Singapore."
,,Unique,4.0,,Well worth a visit when in Singapore as this is one of the most unique facilities that I have visited. The dual purpose attraction is a great idea.
,,Brilliant Engineering,5.0,,"The photos don't do this place any favours.

Day or night the 'trees' are beautiful, the trees are stunning, many covered with growing flowers, ferns and everything else.

The colour, the engineering, the beauty is stunning. You wonder how its achieved.

Gobsmackingly beautiful.

Go, take the kids, take nanna and grandpa, easily accessible. The audio tour is another activity that I highly recommend.

Enjoy!"
,,One Of The Must See,4.0,,"Amazing artificial trees, especially resplenendent at night. The music and light show is fantastic and it's free! Well worth seeing"
,,Enchanting Light Display,4.0,,The walk on these supertrees will give you a panorama view of the Garden of the Bay. It is one of the best place for photography. The light display after dusk is just wow. It is a completely different scenario. It is a place for all ages.
,,Super-amazing!,5.0,,Everything about this towering structure is amazing! The way the plants are woven into each other is sensational and the best part of it is that each Supertree harnesses its own solar energy - brilliant work!
,,Evenings visit,5.0,,If you want to see evening show with music you should come later in the evening. Music show starts at 8pm or at 9pm. We had a great time.
,,Amazing Avatar Experience,5.0,,The trees are amazingly beautiful. The plants are well done and they respond by solar. The walkway at the top was an added treat.
,,Unique vertical garden,4.0,,"It's free to enter this area below of this supertree grove, but if you wanna walk and pass through the skytree there was some pay ticket and really long queue at that time.
Nice view at nite, the garden concept was vertically growth in a wall of tower, a huge canopy and colorful beautifully light at nite."
,,the future is now,4.0,,It amazes me how futuristic Singapore is becoming in just a few years. Come here and you'll know what I'm talking about. Amazing concept. The only really ugly thing are the oh-so-many gigantic plastic dragon-flies stuck everywhere... yuck...
,,Visit the night display,5.0,,We visited the Supertree Grove for a night music/lights spectacular. This was truly an amazing spectacle. Unsure if a regular event.
,,Loved it!,5.0,,This is really a must. Night or day time. Its like a fairy tail world. Especially when the music is playing. Amazing atmosphere. You have not been in Singapore without visiting the super trees!
,,Do not miss this,5.0,,Do not miss this 7.45 pm show if you go to gardens by the bay. Greatly conceptualized light show. Beautiful light work. The restaurant at the top of supertree has very low veg options and hence vegetarians should avoid.
,,Amazing,5.0,,The night show of lights and music make this a spectacular experience. The tremendous trees are lit up and the aerial walkway is worth paying for.
,,"Amazing at night, especially from the walkway",5.0,,"My second visit to Gardens by the Bay and this time I made sure I went to the full set of trees rather than the few near the entrance.

Visiting for my birthday I was determined to go up on the walkway and was fortunate enough to have times my experience that I was on the walkway during the 15 minute show, a fantastic experience.

If you are going to visit Gardens by the Bay try to visit the Supertree grove for the 7:45pm show even if you do so from the ground, it is so worth the experience. Great for the kids too."
,,Singapore at night,4.0,,"Such a lovely experience to see the trees light up in the evening, sit and enjoy the free show in the evening time"
,,A Must-Go Place For The Tourist,5.0,,"We were there close to 7pm on a Monday and the carpark was full with a long queue waiting, not sure if this is always the case on all days.
After visiting the Cloud Forest, we came to The Supertree Grove when The Garden Rhapsody show already started. Everyone just casually sitting or lying down on the surrounding grounds and stairs to enjoy the show. I was totally mesmerized by the lights and sound.
A highly recommended place to go on a cool and dry night!"
,,Really enjoyed light show,5.0,,"After leaving Cloud Forest, headed here for light show. Simply unforgettable and awesome, large crowd of spectators enjoying the whole spectacle. I would never tire of watching this. There's a restaurant at the top, but I didn't go."
,,Blissfully in the shade,5.0,,"The first thing that i wanted to visit in Singapore has been the super tree grove and when i did, it was magic with all the lights and splendor , the tress shone to glory."
,,Very Pretty,4.0,,The light and music show is amazing. The effort made is awesome. Personally I wouldn't bother with the sky walk but the grove by itself is brilliant
,,Amazing,5.0,,This is so mesmerizing. This is a must visit place for every tourist in Singapore. Light show at the night is the best part of this amazing trees.
,,Impressive,4.0,,We saw the super tree grove during our visit to the gardens by the bay. They are impressive. Make sure you take a detour to see them close up. They are also beautifully lit at night.
,,amazing to see at night,5.0,,"The super trees are spectacular to see during the day and at night. The show was great, we just happened to be at the right place at the right time as we wanted to see it lit up at night."
,,Vow what a lively experience to walk through this Grove,5.0,,"Bountiful, well decorated and intricate architecture. Eyeful Bonanza. Dont miss the sky walk to see through at a closer zoom"
,,Fascinating and spectacular. Do not miss the light show.,5.0,,Definitely worth a visit and its free! These structures are spectacular with plants growing up the side which help to provide some power for the structures. There is a walkway with fabulous views of the Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Bay Sands hotel or you can take a lift to the restaurant at the top of the tallest tree. In the evening there is a Son et Lumiere and the trees are lit in a succession of beautiful colours as the music plays. Really beautiful.
,,"Vist (free) Grove, skip Skywalk and drinks",4.0,,"I am obsessed with this Supertree Grove, it is so special and unusual, it is really something to behold. However, the 8 dollar Skywalk (maximum 15 minutes) is not worth it. The view didn't improve magically and having done a real tree top walk in the Southern Ridges, it was actually a pity not seeing the trees up close. it is true you have a bird's eye view, but still... When the sun is shining, it might also be really tricky to get good pictures of the supertrees. Also, do not go to the Indo-Chine Restaurant, however much you crave a drink. 12 dollars for one non-alcoholic drink, 20 for one alcoholic drink, in a place that looks rather shabby and has no friendly (rather bored) staff."
,,THE BEST AT NIGHT OF ALL SHOWS,5.0,,"Absolutely AMAZING ,7.45pm we stayed for 2nd Show at 8.45pm and then went back 2 days later for 2 shows again. Easy to get to by MRT"
,,Up a tree!,5.0,,"This is a must if you visit the Gardens by the bay! Yes you pay a few bob but the view you get is amazing. A great oversight to miss it. Walking the tree tops at that height, not for the faint heart!"
,,"Impressive by day, stunning by night",5.0,,"This is a real must. See it first by day and then by night and you will be amazed by its scale, ingenuity and beauty. Personally I wouldn't bother with the sky walk again but if its your first time I guess you have to try it."
,,Magical in the dark,4.0,,"The supertree grove consists of artificial large trees whose branches are filled with starlike lights which are lit at night. It is placed in a huge garden around Marina Bay. It is nice to walk around in the area. There are two trees between which a rooftop walk can be made. Also there is one tree, the tallest one, which has a restaurant in the top, Indochine. The famous Marina Bay Hotel looms over the entire place. It is a remarkable site in Singapore."
,,Not worth paying money for it,3.0,,"this is part of the gardens by the bay, however one needs to pay money to take a walk up the supertree grove, which is not really worth the money"
,,Like something out of Avatar,5.0,,"An intriguing section of the gardens are the huge tree like structures known as the Supertree Grove which remind me of something from Avatar. The Skyway, suspended 22 metres from the ground, links these vertical gardens. As we discovered when we returned at night, these living trees, home to a vast collection of exotic and rare ferns, orchids and vines, come to life with colourful lights and magical music at night with a light and sound show when lit up at night in two shows at 7.45 and 8.45. They are fascinating."
,,A must to visit.,5.0,,Really nice experience to watch the giant trees especially while the light show. A must to visit if you are in Singapore.
,,another planet!,5.0,,feels like you land on another planet - as you walk along the strange-looking plants it might also feel like you are a bug or an ant :))
,,Impressive light show,5.0,,We had a nice hour in the evening in the GBTB looking at the light show in the 'trees' and listening to the music. For free!
,,Go at night,5.0,,This was fun and free. Our two year old enjoyed the light show and the large bugs on the trees. Go at night
,,Amazing Lightshow,5.0,,"In the evening, there is a lightshow (at 7.45 and 8.45pm) which is absolutely amazing! Even during the day, the supertree grove is super beautiful."
,,Do the Skywalk!,5.0,,I wasn't going to do the Skywalk as I am always a bit sceptical about these kind of things however was talked into it by my team and was glad I did - its a terrific perspective and a lovely view - well worth it.
,,music light show,4.0,,"recommend to visit at night to enjoy the musical light show, not iterance fees and there is restaurant available in one of the tree and you can walk on the bridge connecting the tree for additional cost."
,,Amazing !,5.0,,Spent a good few hours around the gardens ... you must do the Sky walk between the trees. Fantastic views of Singapore
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"A must do visit every time in Singapore Music / light show changes regularly, and never disappoints the walkway on the eastern side gives an elevated view and advoids the crowds in the plaza"
,,Why not,4.0,,"If you are in Paris as a tourist, walking around Eiffel tower, you have to climb it. The same applies to Supertree Grove if you are strolling in Gardens by the Bay.

It is a short bridge, but quite interesting. It can be funny looking at some people afraid of heights (unless you are one of them).

The visit is not a must, but why not if you are already there? Pay the ticket just next to the tree and take the lift up. Otherwise you will regret afterwards when you tell your friends that you have pictures of the tree only from below.

Ok, you flew half the world to Singapore. Next, go and buy tickets to the domes."
,,My favourite thing,5.0,,"So beautiful during the day and amazing at night, loved the show and watching the lights change etc to the music"
,,Light show,5.0,,"Too hot for daytime, not a short walk at all. Better to go at dusk and experience the light show. Can get crowded after."
,,The lights,4.0,,Great place to visit in 1h / 2hours. We have colour and lights. The flowers are beatiful . It is aplace for all over ages.
,,Sensory Overload,5.0,,"Beautiful by day but beyond stunning at night, if you do not go to the nightly light shows you have wasted a trip to Singapore. We were extremely lucky to be on the elevated walkway for a whole show and it was stunning, lights and music in a sensory wonderland, Singapore does it again!"
,,Another wonders in Singapore,5.0,,"Visited Malaysia jungle walk canopy, but this one is human creation in a country without a forest, lovely view on top, not too high, but is an experience."
,,"By day: Fantastic ""sky-walk"" - In the evening: A kaleidoscope of colors - breathtaking",5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is one of many extraordinary sights in Singapore and this is special as it offers 2 different experiences when seen during the day or in the evening.

Daytime:

We paid the admission fee and took the elevator up to the walkways which are hanging in the air between the ""treetops"". These are amazing and quite high, so people with vertigo (like myself) might have challenges now and then - but it is absolutely doable, so don't hold back.

The design and layout of the Supertree Grove is well executed and is like a small oasis in this metropolitan city.

Evening:

There are 2 lightshows in the evening - make sure to be there for at least one of them as your will find yourself exposed to a well-orchestrated symphony of light impressions as you walk through the area. If you arrive early, you can even find a place to sit - but strolling is recommendable. We enjoyed the Grove a lot and would go back when returning to Singapore."
,,Amazing place one of the wonders of Singapore,5.0,,Who ever designed these trees has an incredible mind and imagination they just seem to grow from the earth highly recommended
,,Surreale,5.0,,"I chose the italian word ""surreale"" to give the amazement and amusement I felt spending here a couple of hours. Be here at the sunset and you will thank me for the rest of your life..take a look!"
,,Must go,5.0,,"During our visit to gardens,first went there and took some nice photos on the bridges. Ticket price is 9 SGD per person."
,,Mega-trees!,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is a must see in Singapore. The ""supertrees"" have walkways suspended in the air that you can move between, taking in the views of the surrounding vegetation, and the cityscape. There were big, cool, colorful dinosaurs under the supertrees and throughout the immediate area that made it even more fun. I regret not going back at night to see it again. Ideally, you want to see it both day and night, but I only had time for a day visit. Either way, definitely worth a visit."
,,Impressive,4.0,,We went during the day. The trees look impressive as does the walk. Lots of great views all around..
,,Spectacular,5.0,,These are a novel creation and when lit up at night they provide a spectacular view and photo opportunity.
,,Like being in Avatar world,5.0,,This place reminds me to Avatar movie. Extremely impressive constructions. The night show is not to be missed.
,,world class attraction,5.0,,"better than all the other Gardens in the world, this one is unique for its combination of visual horticulture mixed with contemporary architectural elements!!! def worth a visit!!!"
,,WOW,5.0,,"I've seen pictures on-line but once you're actually here & standing under these amazing man-made trees you'll be blown away. I would've liked more time to explore the entire gardens so take that into account when sorting out your itinerary.
We had the opportunity to view the gardens during the day & at night & at both times you see different things but the night show is a must see if you have the time. Be wary of the crowds after the night show as i found myself being jostled along & if you're there with younger kids it's something to be aware of- maybe wait a while after the crowds have cleared before heading back with your family.
The gardens are well laid out with plenty of places to eat & rest, which is handy when it is so hot."
,,Something unseen and beautiful,5.0,,"Practical combined with amazing beauty. A beautiful walk in the daytime, but breathtaking views overnight. Light games. We were lucky enough to see the light and music show, which was fabulously beautiful."
,,Great lighting!,5.0,,"Hand around until after dark at Gardens by the bay for a superb music and light show at Supertree grove. There are 2 shows, 7:45pm and 8:45pm. Get there early and find a nice seat. You can even watch this lying down so you dont have to strain your neck."
,,Words cannot describe the feel at this place,5.0,,"I was awe-struck at this place. The structure, the way that they combine artificial design with true nature (plants, birds living there, etc.). The light shows at night are not less than amazing with a beautiful mixture of music and light. Be in time for a good spot at the shows. The elevator to the walking bridge upstairs is definitely worth the time and money."
,,you need children with you,3.0,,The skywalk was closed because of a chance of rain and this situation lasted for hours. It didn't rain but we gave up after we'd seen everything else. It was unusual but not beautiful. It's supposed to be better at night with a light show and music. We're not going back.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"A beautiful supertree,with a great lightning performance at the night. What a great place to visit.."
,,Great night show!,4.0,,"This show is only 15 minutes, but a lot of fun! The trees light up and different music is played. Really beautiful!"
,,Must See,5.0,,This is a must do in Singapore. It’s best to go at night as the vertical gardens are lit up and look gorgeous. I have also been during the day which is beautiful as well. During the day you can pay an additional fee to do a skywalk between the trees.
,,Singapore does it better.,5.0,,"A must see part of the gardens in the bay... wait for the light show at the end of the night , a site and sound extravaganza to be hold xxx"
,,Definitely must see in day and night as well!!!,5.0,,Most beautiful area I have ever been. Excellent views everywhere you see. You could walk a day there back and forth looking at the views.
,,Beautifull,5.0,,Visit this in the evening and you will be very surprised. Very nice illumination & decors. Easy to travel by MRT.
,,Amazing manmade towers!,5.0,,I love the concepts of plants on steels. Good job to the architecture! The whole place is very well maintained. From the floor all the way to the top including the plants. The best time to visit is dusk.
,,Great place in the middle of the Marina Bay area,5.0,,"Go and wander around in this marvelous area of Singapore. On reclaimed land the government has really made the most of it. It's beautiful, almost majestic and just something you have to visit when you're around. It's free as well! And Marina Bay Sands, shops, the Marina Bay, the Gardens etc are all within walking distance. Highly recommendable!"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"watch it at night, splendid. Singapore is moving forward and attractions are getting more. I love coming to SG even more now."
,,go for the evening light show,4.0,,A must visit when in Singapore. Im not saying you'll spend all day here but the trees really are something to behold and the light show in the evening was mesmerising.
,,Stunning place especially at sunset,5.0,,Great watching the garden lights as well as the lights of Singapore come on.Very beautiful at twilight
,,Nice Walk - Tourists should visit,5.0,,"Review by Dr Sim. Nice walk. Go in the late afternoon, near dusk, to see the view. It is cooler. At night the ""trees"" light up. You cannot get a good view at night. However, the colours of the lighted trees are beautiful. Tourists should visit if they have the time. Regards DrSim001"
,,absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"lovely evening spent visiting the super trees and marina bay precinct, during the autum festival, these gardens are stunning"
,,Just spectacular,5.0,,"The light show at night was fabulous and the gardens were just amazing, would have loved to spend more time there."
,,More interesting in evening with the light show,4.0,,Go late afternoon to see the plants and then wait for the free light show at 745 pm and 845 pm. Now with the autumn festival there are additional decorations.
,,Visit.,5.0,,"Mid autumn festival. The garden by the bay had done up a few set up of display. Beside the light show at night 7.45pm and 8.45pm , taking a walk around the garden was great. Worth going before the festive is past."
,,Supertree Grove,5.0,,Beautiful at night--go to the light show at 7:45 or 8:45. There is food available and just a little seating!
,,Simply amazing,5.0,,"These structures are simply amazing, covered in air plants up the trunk creates a unique environment. It is worth walking up the stairs rather than taking the lift to gain an appreciation of this. The suspended walkway between the trees is also a highlight, well worth the visit."
,,Underwhelming,3.0,,I had been to Gardens by the Bay on a previous trip to Singapore but the Super Tree Grove was closed for maintenance. I have to say I was a little disappointed and underwhelmed once I got on the walkway. There are a couple of good views and photo opportunities but overall I was expecting more. Nice breeze being high up which was nice!
,,Treemendous,5.0,,These trees are an architectural marvel and a Singapore must do - except when lightning is around so choose your time up top carefully!
,,"Magnificent, very unique, not to be missed",5.0,,"I loved this attraction as part of the Gardens by the Bay. It is a separate and distinct area of man-made trees now with many many plants of all types growing on and up each tree in the grove. There are some other similar trees at the entrance to the Gardens themselves but this is a designated area where there are a cluster of these cool trees.

One of them has a restaurant at its top, I only saw it but did not go to it, it of course has an elevator.

Three trees have a connected walkway about 40 feet up which allows you to take an elevator up one, walk on the walkway which is suspended from the trees and then go down the elevator at the last tree. There is a separate cost to do this that you queue for. The cost was $8SD. The views and perspectives from above are quite unique and staggering. One thing, the walkway has a little sway to it in the middle and gets narrow, so just be forewarned, nothing too bad or risky or anything like that but just not a solid walkway as I was suspecting. I took a ton of photos from there, as you have clear views of everything nearby, both domes in the Gardens, the Singapore Flyer, as well as the East side of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.

Note also that there is a metro stop just near the Grove and the Grove has its own nearby food court with a common seating area but 6 distinct restaurants.

There are also some open areas and grass nearby for just sitting and even picnicking. This is also the prime spot to come and wait for the light show in the Grove each night.

I saw the Grove at about sunset and could not wait there to see either of the two nightly light shows where the Grove ""comes alive"" with lights and music which, by reputation is fantastic. The place was getting packed when I was leaving, since seeing the show is free. Lots of locals, not as many tourists, and many many local families too. Others have reviewed the light and music show, it lasts 15 minutes twice a night.

Also, this is a prefect place to take great Instagram worthy photos of the Grove, the separate trees and the varied many viewpoints also. I surely enjoyed taking photos here and trying to capture the essence of the trees and the Grove itself. I was not alone, everyone there was snapping madly. So make sure you have your phone and/or other camera charged and ready for these spectacular photo ops.

My favorite part was to see something so uniquely creative done so very well. It worked better than envisioned. I am so glad I was able to take it in.

The Grove is about a ten minute walk from the Gardens by the Bay entrance, even closer by taking the Metro.

Don't miss this while in Singapore. A must see."
,,What a place!,5.0,,Exceeded our expectations in every way! Highly recommend seeing light & sound spectacular at night. We joined the crowd by lying down and looking up. What a view!!
,,Lovely,5.0,,Interesting design and no cost. Really pretty area so good for photos. Not too busy when we went. Good for walking around.
,,Gob smacking,5.0,,"Never have seen anything like this. Truely a wonderful experience for kids, adults and families. Loved everything about this place."
,,Super tree Grove...,5.0,,"Super tree Grove is another attraction which is located inside the gardens by the bay. It has got around 6 to 7 towers with a vertical garden over it. There is a restaurant at the top of the super tree. The skywalk is through the bridge connecting these super trees. There is a beautiful light show at 7 45 and 8 45 pm, during which the super trees got lit up according to the music. It's a free show and no one should miss this place."
,,Best visited at dusk,5.0,,"The tree structures are impressive enough and are currently decorated with fluorescent dragonflies, but come 7:45pm, they come alive with the night light show. Our presentation had a moon theme through the selected music. The lights are choreographed and everywhere is a good vantage point. We arrived early to secure a bench seat, though most people were happy to sit on the floor for the presentation. We did not go on the skywalk as by the end we were tuckered out."
,,Great views from here,4.0,,We went up here and even tho I have issues with heights I got over that and walked round no problems. must be over the height thing I think. Very cheap to do and well worth having a look.
,,amazing,4.0,,"Supertree Grove is a part of Garden by the Bay. it is amazing place, near metro (MRT) station. if you are with kids, better to have a pram or use shuttle. it is very very beautiful place with great technology"
,,Good Views from the Top,4.0,,Supertree Grove is a part of the Gardens by the Bay complex and has become a iconic land mark of Singapore. We on top by the lift and the walk was very pleasant with good views all around.
,,Watch the light show,5.0,,"Actually the light show was the highlight of our visit that day. It was splendid! The Supertree Grove was fantastic, and most important its free. You can walk around and take as many picture as you can. Its so instagram-able place ;)"
,,“Lights & Music at its Best!”,5.0,,"The best way to cap your visit @Gardens by the Bay is to personally experience the - lights & music, right below the Supertrees, preferably at the center area, which is the best spot. You must be there ahead and show, just relax on the ground. Surely, the long wait is worth it. It’s like watching a beautiful 15 minutes mini-concert, and mind you, it’s for free. You will enjoy the beat, as if a live performance is going on. Kudos Supertree Grove!"
,,Engineering marvels,5.0,,"Even by day these structures are impressive but it is by night they actually light up the sky. The walk gives you an amazing overview of the area, definitely if you aren't afraid of heights."
,,good and cool,5.0,,"By all means this place is great for taking pictures and having a good walk around the whole area, nice."
,,Wow,5.0,,This was a highlight of our trip to Singapore. Amazing architecture and plants. Limited to 15 minutes walking the structure as limited numbers but enough time to take in the views and take some photos. A must visit.
,,walk in the yky,4.0,,I recommend to talk a walk up on the tree canopy walk and enjoy the birds perspective of the surrounding nature. Best to visit in the evening to see the lights.
,,Concrete with Creepers and Lights (& Restaurant),4.0,,These are just concrete and iron structures and have creepers around them. One has a restaurant at the top. Nothing great but the lights look good in the evening. Walking on top is also not that fancy but just normal. Small push carts around to eat
,,Always a pleasure to watch the lights!,5.0,,"The music,the light effects,the detailing in the show is mesmerizing.A very well coordinated program overall."
,,could be better,4.0,,Waited a while for the end of the day light show display. This did not turn out to be what I expected. It was basically lights synchronised with music. Maybe add some laser lights and water features to enhance the experience?
,,Amazing,5.0,,Such a beautiful visit. What an interesting and unique attraction in a bustling city. Great place to take kids and teach them about nature. You can do the walk across the structures for good views.
,,"Beautiful, a must see",5.0,,"A must see! It's free to walk about but if you want to go on the Skywalk it cost only $8 singapore dollars. We went at dusk, it was beautiful with the lights on and they have a daily night show at 7:45pm and 8:45pm."
,,Mesmerising !,5.0,,"Gardens by the Bay is an awesome place to visit during the day, but it is even prettier at night with these captivating trees! I could stay there all night gazing up at these giants. You can catch a free light show at 7.45pm and 8.45pm."
,,Of course you must go here!,5.0,,By day or night these Garden trees are amazing! We climbed up (elevator available) to the cat walk and had great views of the gardens and city.
,,A wonderful experience on the elevated walkway at the Super Trees.,5.0,,"This complex of man-made Super Trees, festooned with tropical growth is awesome. For about $8 you can be elevated to a walkway around these trees for wonderful photo opportunities. Quite unique, there is a Light and Sound show each night, and it is a show to behold. Well worth the stay after visiting the other areas."
,,Outstanding scenery,5.0,,Visited the garden for the evening sound and light show. Definitely a must see in Singapore. Also viewed from Marina Bay Sands Skypark
,,2017 F1 Night race and sight seeing,5.0,,Part of gardens of the Bay well worth the tick to go up on the skywalk and hang around for the light show
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Had a look during the day and it was amazing and decided to come back for a night walk and visit. We weren't disappointed.

We had drinks up the top in Indochine and saw the place light up and later went for the walk and watched the second light show from the ground.

So much to see around the area and done up so well.

Great to see and can do for nothing or pay $8 for the walk. There are other tours etc which you pay for if you want."
,,We are not in Singapore if not visit Super tree Grove,5.0,,Garden by the Bay is famous botanical Huge Garden in Singapore. We are not in Singapore if not visit this place.
,,Wonderful view at night and great performance!,4.0,,"if i'm not mistaken, every day at 7:45pm and 9:45pm, there will be performances at the supertree grove. make sure to bring tapestry or sit mat and relax at the small park nearby.

cons:

too many people.

make sure to buy the tickets first then, wait until around 6:40pm to go up and watch sunset. only 15 minutes is allowed to spend up there."
,,Wonderful once again,5.0,,"Always find something new to see here, fantastic light show set to a musical theme, twice nightly, don't miss it."
,,E.t,4.0,,"The trees really look extraterrestrial, you feel like you are in the future , nice ideea and nice atraction:) the park surrounding the area is beautiful to visit ! I liked it both on a day light and at night . In the nightime there is a show starting at 07;45 and 08:45 . Tip: you should go near the trees because the music is not so loud and you can't hear it from distance , you should also layback and enjoy the show!"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"These are one of the highlights of Gardens by the Bay. They will ""come alive"" with lights and music at nights, and the theme changes regularly. Worth a visit, they are amazing."
,,Nighttime must,5.0,,To see these trees by night is an experience not to be missed. Although you can do this on your own it is probably better to do through an organised excursion as explanations and other events are equally worthwhile.
,,extremely well done,5.0,,Free to visit and look at.This was well worth visiting and waiting for the evening light show.Well done Singapore.!!
,,SuperTree @ Night,5.0,,"Best to go here during night time as it is not that hot compared to morning or afternoon time. They have a light show around 7:45pm and 8:45pm which will last more or less 15 mins. Better go there early if your planing to catch the free show at 7:45pm as there will be a big crowd and looking for a spot to lie down. You may opt to go the walkway but with a fee and there is a time duration as there will be a long line at the entrance. Be sure to have a bottled water with you as it still a bit hot during the night. While there, you can also check out the Flower Dome in the morning or afternoon before heading out to see the super tree light show. There are 2 flower domes and each have there corresponding fees. Do check out there website for ticket pricing. You can also avail tickets (for a cheaper price) from travel agencies in advance. A lot of travel agencies have promos so do your research before hand."
,,Floresta do futuro - Forest of the future,5.0,,"Ao final do dia, surpresa, espetaculo de musica e luzes. Simplesmente fantástico, a não perder. At the end of the day, surprise, show of music and lights. Simply fantastic, not to be missed."
,,Super Nice at Night,5.0,,i dont know if it s happen on daily basic but around 8.45 there was a music show maybe it was just because it was the Formula one Week End but it was so pleasant !!! so colorful and energetic !
,,night out,5.0,,"dont bother paying to go in towers for night show, best view is looking at the tree towers , night show is just projectors onto tree towers, a little underwhelming . then there is a mad rush out."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"This is well wort a visit . It's amazing . If you arrive about 7.30 in the evening , your in plenty of time fit the spectacular display ."
,,Nothing extraordinary,3.0,,"If you are scared of heights, then this is avoidable as there is a walkway connected with cables and seems to move around in the wind as well. Spectacular sight at night."
,,Wired and Wonderful,5.0,,"These giant 'trees' are an iconic part of the Gardens by the Bay. I've not come across anything similar and they really are strange but beautiful creations. You can go and wander around them for free.
There's also a walkway that winds around a few of the trees about halfway up that provides some excellent views of the Singapore skyline. It's 8$ a head.
Best of all though is the light show that takes place at 19:45 and 29:45hra. Well worth the wait so I would schedule your visit so you can see it."
,,Super Trees are just SUPER!,5.0,,These Super Trees really are SUPER; they range between 25 and 50 metres in height and are veritable vertical gardens. The technology behind them is extraordinary. If you are visiting Singapore make sure you do not miss the experience of walking through Super Tree Grove and watching the nightly sound and light spectacular.
,,Amazing at Night,5.0,,Make sure you get there after the sunset set. They a musical light show around the Supertree grove area which is a must see highlight while at the Gardens by the bay
,,Stroll the gardens in the afternoon and wait for the light sow,5.0,,The supertrees are free to see. There is a charge to go up to the walkway and the wait for tickets is phenomenal in the late afternoon and evening.Tickets can only be purchased in person on site but the lights how is best from under the trees.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"We had a very enjoyable trip to the Supertree Grove, it is amazing to look at these beautiful structures, the light show was great to watch but remember the mosquito repellent. Transport out at the end is very busy,"
,,Unique,4.0,,This free attraction is part of the Garden by the Bay atrraction. Entrance is free and parking is plenty in the basement. This place lights up during the night and is a sight to behold. There are benches to sit and relax.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Set in great gardens, these structures are so well designed. Well worth a visi, especially at night when the light show is on."
,,An explosion of the senses,5.0,,"What an experience! It is best to view in the evening when it is going dark, about 7.30pm but get to the main tree about 7pm to get a good possie. There is no seating but you can sit on the raised kerbs or the entrance steps but you need to get there early to get a place. Dont sit too close to the big tree otherwise you'll get a stiff neck looking up. When we there they played songs from the musicals, coordinated with a light show. When leaving it is best to take the walkway into the Marina Bay Sand Hotel (the one with the boat on top) and then get a taxi from the entrance back to your hotel. If you try to get to the MRT you will have to negotiate the crowds heading there."
,,Night time spectacular,5.0,,Although this was not much to see during the day at night all lit up it's beautiful. Definitely worth seeing.
,,colourful,5.0,,"creates the feeling of being in another world, especially interesting is the light and sound show in the evening."
,,Garden rhapsody is beautiful,5.0,,Garden rhapsody is phenomenal. Trees are lighted with different colors and they change according to musical melodies. Free and so beautiful. Every night 7:45 and 8:45 pm and it takes around 15 minutes..
,,Amazing,5.0,,We the supertree in day but after we go and night 7.45 and see the show. Light and music was amazing. We sit in the floor and see the show. Many people lie down to have their head up and see the show better. Must in Singapore.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,We came for the light show in the evening. It is spectacular and the show tunes add a bit of fun to the show.
,,Super trees made of concrete with flashing lights?,3.0,,"Nothing magic about that one,you can use 15 min of your time(duration of the display)if more you will be bored"
,,Fantastical,4.0,,Amazing at night with the light and sound show. The music as well as the lighting were superbly executed. Must allow time to queue for the walkway.
,,Stunning,4.0,,"Absolutely stunning it is a must see. A short walk from Garden's by the Bay, it cannot be missed. Came in the day time, but it is a must see spectacular at night."
,,Amazing,5.0,,We visited at Christmas time and I would highly recommend. Loved all the Christmas lights and activities
,,Super light show at night,5.0,,These other-worldly tree structures are fantastic but all that reaches new heights at night when they have a light and music show. No entrance fee. Enter early enough to find a spot to sit - people just sit down on the ground. Bring something to sit on because you will want to lie down to watch the show above you (saves your neck). Really entertaining and quite beautiful.
,,A Must Gem,5.0,,When in Singapore you must go to see the night light show which happens twice a night first one at 745pm & one of the best views is under the lights & looking up so impressive & colourfull with the music a GEM.
,,Reminiscent of Avatar,5.0,,We visited this free attraction during the day and were amazed. We came again in the evening and were blown away by the impressive light show held twice each evening. The gardens are open through to the early hours of the morning.
,,gardens by the bay a epitome of human touch,4.0,,"very nicely created , beauty of human brains, worth a visit, can take shuttle ride to cover the place as walking could be tiresome."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"Fantastic design and lovely gardens. An awesome combination of nature and modern, architecture. Beautiful place, worth braving the heat and humidity."
,,Super trees!,5.0,,"The trees, lit up at night, are amazing. If you only had enough time between watching Spectra or Garden Rhapsody, skip Spectra and do this instead. For me, it's far more impressive and enjoyable being able to sit/stand up close to the trees and watch them do their thing.

For a more interesting experience, you could time it right to watch the show from the OCBC skyway, but there will be queues so good timing is essential."
,,Go for the light show,5.0,,The supertrees are huge and there are light shows at night set to music. People lie on the ground to watch. A great experience.
,,Something out of a science fiction movie,4.0,,"Large alien like trees that reach for the sky. You can enter them and walk along the sky walk, it is amazing at night as it all lights up."
,,Impressive site at night,5.0,,"We went to see these ""trees"" at night then returned the next day to see the park during the day. Very impressive but the park lacked the true soul a garden should have. Make sure you see in both during the day and at night."
,,Lay down and look up,5.0,,It's a really different view of the world when you're looking up at these 'trees' - especially when they're having the light show!
,,Spectacular view in the night,4.0,,The super tree grove are consisted of 18 individual high tree structure specially constructed in state of the art design. It has such a spectacular view at night once the tree grove are beautifully lighted up. Very refreshing to see how morden architecture design and the using of space can give meaning to a hectic city like Singapore.
,,Dazzling Light Display,5.0,,The place was beautiful during the day but dramatically came alive as it turned dark and the amazing light show began. It was awesome & worth waiting for. Highly recommended
,,Amazing huge colorful trees 🌲,4.0,,Make sure to attend the 7:45 pm show because it's very unique. Nice music & lights show presented on the trees. The attraction entrance is for free!

,,A night time highlight.,5.0,,Worth a visit based on its uniqueness alone. It's also free. Make sure you go into the early evening for an after dark visit when the sound and light show provide an xtra highlight.
,,get your cameras ready,5.0,,better to come here at sunset till dark as you will appreciate it more with the lights of the supertree changing colors
,,Supertree Grove - impressive,4.0,,This was a particularly impressive and interesting portion of the Gardens by the Bay complex. You cannot get an idea of the scale until you get close ... they are huge.
,,Light show a must!,5.0,,"We have visited Gardens by the Bay many times but never caught the light show. Made dinner reservations for 7PM at SuperTree by IndoChine, situated ontop the tallest supertree and caught the 745PM show from there. It is much better viewed from below in my opinion. We watched the 845PM show lying flat on the ground after our dinner.

The view at night is spectacular: modern, beautiful and futuristic. The lovely vertical greens and plants were calming and soothing, providing a nice contrast to the architectural structures.

Definitely worth a visit, the light show is a must!"
,,Nice place to chill`,4.0,,This is a nice place if you are not tired after visiting the two domes. The walkways are really unique and this is also a great place for pictures
,,Place to relax,3.0,,"Visited in the evening and the light show has already started by that time. There was a waiting time of 30 minutes to go to the sky walk therefore we didn't go to that. Spent some time sitting under a super tree and it was peaceful. Good place to sit and watch the city and the night sky which is lighted by the trees.

There are many restaurants near by so you can have dinner or just a bite under the trees."
,,Expected Free WiFi,3.0,,"Yep - sure BBC Click said there was free superfast wifi here - but no! The trees were cool, and the skywalk was good - but time limited so so limited, and there's a charge for the sky walk, The evening is beautiful lights and music, not much room, but free pretty lights.... A food court exits to the trees."
,,An interesting visit,4.0,,"We visited the trees at night because of the light and music show and we were not disappointed. It has a Disney-like feel to it but that is okayt if you are with young children. We even went for drinks at the rooftop bar (expensive but ok) and that made it, all in all, a very interesting visit."
,,If you like artificial trees,4.0,,It is a man-made structure with some plants hanging off the sides. Visit at night for a spectacular light show. Great place to people watch.
,,Free and fantastic,5.0,,"Great light show, well worth a visit. There is a restaurant as well but we didn't have time to try it"
,,Great to look at......,4.0,,"Walked through here the other week. Just amazing what has been built in this area, but charging for the skywalk is over the top."
,,Just Wow,5.0,,Very impressive and futuristic design. A must visit at Gardens by the bay. Best explore this during night time.
,,Impressive metallic trees structure,4.0,,"The collection of very tall tree like metallic structures were very impressive. Nice place to spend the day/evening, especially for the evening light/music shows."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Individually these trees are a marvel but as a group at night with music and lights they are spectacular. They light up beautifully and must be experienced to be believed. In the day time they are a wonder, but at night they become magical."
,,Iconic structures,4.0,,"They are vertical tree like structures above 82 feet.They house ferns, vines and orchids.These iconic futuristic structures perform functions of like trees -harnessing solar energy with photovoltaic cells,collection of rain water, also serve air intake and exhaust function of cooling systems.Enjoy the beautiful aerial view from OCBC skyway.The light and sound show is special attraction."
,,Great Place,5.0,,It's a great place to visit An Artificial Man Made Tree In Which There Is Daily Laser Light Show From.7 pm For An Hall An Hour Which Is A Must To Watch Excellent Place For Persons With Families
,,Best at Dusk,5.0,,"When I went (October 2016), it was only $5 to ride up to the top of the grove and cross the sky bridge. There is a light show at dusk that was set to Disney music. Was unaware of this when I went, and was lucky enough to be on the bridge during the show. What a view!!!"
,,Brilliant trees,5.0,,Amazing place With great views especially in the evenings is great music and flashing lights all over in these trees.

,,Absolutely amazing a must see,5.0,,To be honest I didn't know what to expect going here but I am so glad we did. The light show and the whole surroundings were surreal. Next time I am going to book dinner at the restaurant.

,,Different but great,5.0,,Went with my family & a very nice experience in total. Have not seen structures of this sort in any part of the world. A good place to spend time
,,Must Visit!,5.0,,A must visit attraction every time I pay visit to Singapore! Garden Rhapsody light show happens every night at 7.45pm and 8.45pm. I can guarantee it will be a mind blowing experience for first time visitor!
,,Night of lights.,5.0,,"Part of a group tour taking in the light show to music.Although very crowded it was still a nice thing to see.My suggestion, take a cooler, food and stay awhile."
,,Suspended walkway between the trees!!!,4.0,,"The Supertree grove is amazing. Artificial trees, some of which are chimneys from a power generation plant which burns waste. We became friends of the Gardens By the Bay and as such we received free entry to the skywalk between the trees."
,,Garden walk,5.0,,"Beautiful giant man made trees adorn the skyline. Lit at night, wonderful to behold in the early evening or later. Many plants use the giant tree scaffolding to grow luxuriously."
,,Awsome!!,5.0,,"A unique experience.
When we arrived there it was already dark and the lights were on.
Suddenly, one of the staff announced that there will be a show.
Music has been playing such as the phantom of the opera, don't cry for me argentina etc. The best part though, is when the lights have been ""dancing"" in the same rhythm of each song has been playing"
,,Light and sound show,5.0,,The light and sound show around 7.45pm was well worth waiting for. An impressive display enjoyed by all.
,,A must for first time Singapore visitor!,4.0,,"This was a second visit to the light and sound show within a year.

I found it as enjoyable as the last time though I found lesser chairs for comfortable view compared to last year.

The arena is full of tourist at the time of the show which makes it a very vibrant place to be. The amenities around are great! It is recommended to reach there a bit early and occupy a place near the central super tree having a restaurant above it for a better view during the show."
,,Fantastic worth every penny,5.0,,"We went yesterday 25 th August, not very busy so had 30mins up there. When busy it says on the board restricted to 15 mins. Dry hot humid day so got lots of photo's of the park and hotel. Even my husband was determined to walk around the top, he doesn't do heights."
,,"Go at night for lights and music, incredibly chilled",5.0,,"This is a free experience and it great to look at in the day, even better at night when lights and music are added for a surreal and mystical experience as you wander about."
,,Stay for the night show!,4.0,,"The best free part of Gardens by the Bay (GBTB). Good to visit, day and night. There's a show too at night. The 80s disco was underwhelming but the Disney one was epic in May of 2015."
,,Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"This is a must see, especially at night to see the fantastic light show. The view from the 20 metre high walkway is amazing."
,,Mesmerising,5.0,,Beautiful light display set to music - worth hanging around for this show but make sure you find a seat early or you will have to stand.
,,Night Spectacular,5.0,,"A must visit venue night and day but you will never forget the light show at night, truly a sensory overload."
,,OMG,5.0,,"This is the most beautiful thing I have seen. We arrived in the evening in Singapore and went directly to the Marina Bay Garden to see the light show under the Supertrees. Wow!!!! It was so magical! Hope I manage to go again
Go at 19.45, when the light show starts. It is amazing!"
,,Night viewing is a must,4.0,,Would highly recommend that a visit during the evening as it is much cooler and the light show is entertaining. The sky walk gives you a different perspective of the area.
,,Be sure to watch the Rhapsody in the Garden in the evening.,5.0,,I lost my mind to the fantastic garden Rhapsody. A place to stay in Singapore. I will not forget the music and the show that I saw and listened to for a long time.
,,Into it!,5.0,,"Prefer going there in the evening. Breathtaking night view with the enjoyable light and music show. I walked on the sky walkway. It was a bit scary at first, but then I was amazed by the view. It took quite a long time to queue but it's worthwhile!"
,,Stunningly beautiful and ecologically wonderful place,5.0,,"We can't say anything about the Supertree Grove that will come close to doing justice to the beauty of this place, as much of the idea of it as its physical appearance. I hope other cities will learn from Singapore and create similar green areas within their metropolises.

An ode to human ingenuity, this place warrants a visit during the day and a trip at night to fully soak in whats being done here. Do find time to try the skywalk, offering unmatched vistas of the grove and the Gardens beyond. Take your time to stroll around the massive man-made still structures or trees that are provide solar energy as much as hold vertical gardens on them.

The music and light show in the evening is mesmerizing and almost fantastical, taking the observer on a place somewhere else - in short it is magical and serene all the same. Having learned about the Grove and the larger Marina Bay Gardens, this was the first place we went to when in Singapore. We enjoyed it so much that we came back on our last day to enjoy the light and music show in the evening. This place has given our teenage childcare and us a lasting beautiful memory. Do visit, you will remember it too."
,,Nice views from on high,5.0,,You will see this when you visit the Gardens by the Bay. They are man made and interesting and the high walk is worthwhile as it offers great views of the City. Not for those of you that suffer vertigo but quite safe - even I did the climb and I am someone who is a nervous nellie with heights - but there is enough to hang on to.
,,Man's powers of execution at its very best,5.0,,"In one corner of the Garden by in Singapore, we suddely come across a grove of a larege number of ""trees"" , man-mad. about 39 ' tall , these wonderful trees give shade during day time and become live with a galaxy of colourful lights . A breathtaking sight. We salute the people of Singapore for building such an innovative garden of trees.
There is about 120m long OCBC skyway linking two super trees to chill out at 50m high to have a top view of the Gardens by Bay. Some parts of the trees are provided with photovoltaic cell to harness solar energy to illuminate.
A great experience for the young and old"
,,Dont miss the light and music,5.0,,Visiting during the evening is recommended as they have a lights and music show (garden rhapsody) in the evening. The show is quite good.
,,Be mesmerised by these huge man-made trees and hang around the evening to enjoy the light show,5.0,,"Take a walk at the park with these huge trees, you can lie down at the foot of the tree to relax, or you can take a skywalk on top of the tree. There is also a restaurant on one of the tree where there is access to the tree bar with a different view. Hang around in the evening to see the changing color of the trees and environment."
,,Its a Must See in Singapore plus the Night Light Show,5.0,,"When Visiting Singapore its a must see , take a day out to explore this amazing ever green and colourful place"
,,A must!!!!,5.0,,This place is amazing day or night. The gardens are just pristine and the Supertree has great views of Marina Bay Sands and the city. Just Gorgeous. Don't miss it.
,,Spectacular sights even during the daytime!,5.0,,"Because we were only in Singapore for a short stay, we were only able to visit the Gardens by the Bay during the daylight hours. Consequently we were unable to view the light display associated with the Supertree Grove. Apparently it is quite spectacular.
However, we were able to appreciate the beauty of the massive artificial tree display close up.
The elevated walkway provided some spectacular sights and was not crowded probably because it was a very hot and humid afternoon.
Well worth a visit even during the daylight hours!"
,,free to view,5.0,,great with nightlights in teh dark nice walk free as separate from teh dones to take pictures all but u must pay to go up lovely show to walk thru or sit and watch teh lights in tandem with music
,,Spectacular Night Show,5.0,,"These structures are amazing with a range of carefully selected plants growing from them creating an almost Avatar like feel. Some are connected by a sky walkway which gives you an alternative way of viewing them.
The highlight for us was seeing them lit up in the night show, in diverse ways, as the lighting was synchronized to music.It was spectacular.
The event was on twice that night and we stayed for both shows as we were so taken with it. It is something not to miss and was popular the night we saw it."

,,Spectacular,5.0,,We arrived in time to secure a good vantage point. Very spectacular and great musical accompaniment. Very crowded. Head to Harbourfront afterwards for laser show. But be ready for crowds!
,,Slywalk!!!,5.0,,Really cool place. Queue was not very long. And yes after 15 minutes you are down again. A lift will bring you up and you have a clear view over the park and see the marina bay sands clear on the other side
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"This is the most amazing place! We visited in July 2017, the whole ""gardens by the bay"" are amazing, but the super trees are just breathtaking, they are huge, beautiful, so amazingly well maintained , as is everything in Singapore, during the day, they are just eye popping, I've never seen anything like them, an amazing idea, stroll around and look at each one, it's free to look around you won't have any trouble getting beautiful pics, there's hordes of people, but you certainly don't feel crowded. But honestly the night is when the magic happens! Each tree is lit up and they are just so gorgeous, spend the money and go on the air walk around the tops of the trees, you'll get spectacular views of Singapore, the gardens and Marina bay sands ( the hotel with the ship on top) The Singaporean government took 100 acres of land and turned it into the most amazing and beautiful gardens I have ever seen. The Supertrees are self sustaining architectural masterpieces set in a little piece of paradise! Well done Singapore, well done!"
,,Absolutely Unbelievable,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is absolutely incredible. It is the centrepiece of the stunning Gardens By The Bay and has to be seen to be believed.
I fist saw it on David Attenborough's Planet Earth 2 and couldn't believe my eyes. So it was the first pkace we went to once we'd checked into our hotel.
It consists of a couple of dozen massive steel tree frames, each one planted with different flowers, bushes and shrubs. It's one of the world finest vertical gardens.
You can climb up one on a lift and take a boardwalk from tree to tree for a close up view before going down another. Amazing views of the Supertree, the Gardens and the bay and city itself.
Take your time and stroll around them at the base as well. They are truly enchanting, one of the finest sights I have ever seen on my travels.
There's an unmissable sound and light symphony every evening. Do as the locals do, lie on your back and look up to enjoy the show! It is on twice each evening and lasts about 20 minutes. Totally free and is utterly captivating."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"These supertrees are amazing to look at. We went at night (though we missed the light show) and the next day. They are not real trees, they are large structures with vertical gardens growing on them. The Supertree Grove is a part of the Gardens By The Bay. See my review for that for more about the Cloud Forest and Flower domes."
,,Emotional,4.0,,"the best time to visit is evening (6pm),can catch up the beautiful sunset view than at 7.30pm ++ the light and sound show was very emotional"
,,Beautiful and impressive moments,4.0,,Don't forget to stay for the Rhapsody free show at 19.45 or 20.45. You can get a super clear view of the show at the OCBC walk too.
,,Wow...a must see.,5.0,,"If you di nothing else in Singapore you have to see the super trees by night. The light show, I think starts at 7:00/8:00. What an experience, as music plays a well planned light show takes place before you. There are some great free things available and this is free and superb. Make sure you have bug spray on...food is pricey so make a plan before if you can...access by MRT is easy as in all of Singapore..."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"The entry is free, esp from the Marina bay sands hotel side. The light & sound show at 7:40 pm is awesome!"
,,Magical Lights,4.0,,"This place gives you a very different magical experience. A creative culmination of lights, nature and huge man made (artificial) trees. Best time to visit is in the evening after 5:30 PM."
,,Beautiful lightings at night,2.0,,"This place is located at Garden by the bays. The nearest MRT to this place is Bay front MRT ( yellow line ) I have been to this place twice already.

The light show was stunning and nice during the first visit ( May 2017 ) . But the second visit ( July 2017 ) wasn't that nice as compare to the first visit. As the light show only last for awhile and the story shown on the super trees was no clear enough in term of viewing. There were also very few sound effect during the second lightning show as well.

You can also get a very beautiful view of the sunset during the evening. This place is more suitable for people who enjoys strolling and natural lovers."
,,Yes - an absolute must at night time,5.0,,"If you can, you need to visit at night and see it all lit up. It is so much nicer than during the day. You can visit for a short period at a time (15 minutes) before you have to go down the other side. We were the last group up when we were there as there was a lightning risk. This meant it was super quiet for us! I'd recommend buying your tickets during the day and going back at night as the line up can get really long! Read more on our Singapore page at thewelltravelledman.com"
,,Stunning but...,5.0,,"...for me it wasn't the tech trees that were the stars, it was the beautiful gardens. When we went the elevated walkway was closed but nothing was lost.

I'm not sure I'd do the guided tour again, unless your mobility makes it critical, because our guide was just going thru the motions and talking as fast as he could. Walking is more relaxing.

Well done Singapore."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"stumbled across the Supper trees a few minutes before the light/ sound show . we were wondering why every one was going our way.

The light / sound show was spectacular and very emotional , totally unexpected
the colours were beautiful and everyone was enjoying the show"
,,Always stunning,5.0,,Absolutely beautiful and unique. Second visit and would definitely go again. Always something to see that I missed before.
,,They come alive in the night!!,5.0,,"What appear to be a set of giant trees by the day, they look absolutely amazing in the night with the lights turned upon. With a sound and additional light support they share interesting narratives. See if you have an opportunity of visiting them in the night."
,,Lit up at night,5.0,,The trees are all lit up at night and it is certainly a pleasant time to walk around. There was a light show earlier but just the lights on the trees is good for a walk around.
,,Waaaaaw,5.0,,This is part of Gardens by the bay trip and it is located at the middle of the tour and you enjoy moving to the top tropical made trees and enjoy walking between them with nice view to the bay and the domes
,,Great,5.0,,"Really cool! Some of these artificial trees have vines growing over hem, which makes them even more interesting"
,,Singapore Supertree Grove - A Light and Sound Show for all!,5.0,,"I had the opportunity to watch the sound and light show at the Supertree Grove on 30 July 2017. This is the second time in the past two years that I have had the opportunity to catch this nightly attraction. No, it's not the sound, lights and fireworks that you would see on New Years Eve or at a Disney property, but it is a splendid light and sound show that has the ability to astound the visual and audio senses for a night, or many if you do a return engagement. The folks that put this show together do a wonderful job of choreographing the sound with light movement and it's astounding what they can do when combining both. A technological marvel to be sure. However, perhaps the best part of the whole experience ...... the people. The Supertree Grove show draws in people from all over Singapore and thus from all over the world. While we are in that grove, and watching that show, we are one big happy family! It's amazing to see just how many conversations are struck while waiting for the show, the coming together of people. Awesome all the way around. I highly recommend a visit to the Supergrove and the nightly sound and light show."
,,Magical,5.0,,The evening light and music show is simply magical and will please people of all ages. The supertrees themselves are amazing to behold.
,,Out of this world!!!,5.0,,I had no idea what these would look like up close but the scale is amazing and unbelievable!! Great to see and free space to visit so good for a day trip away from city madness
,,Amazing,5.0,,Great to chill out and unwind with a book. It is also nice place to walk around and empty your mind. It's a far cry from the atmosphere in the CBD that's just 2 minutes away! I recommend the canopy walk!
,,Really gorgeous at night,5.0,,The vibes in the noon and at night is very different and I really love it at night. There's also a light show at night just before 9pm.
,,At night,5.0,,"During the day these sculptures are impressive, but at night, with the light and sound show they really become beautiful, make sure to come after the sun sets"
,,"Awesome, amazing...a must !",5.0,,"I see all lights show in my firts night from my balcony from the hotel (Marina Mandarin). In the second evening I go to see the entire show and was breathtaking and amazing. Is the most beautiful show see until now.
It'sd a must when you are here in Singapore !"
,,A MUST if you are in Singapore.,5.0,,"Great place. You can spend hours in the SuperTree Groove just walking around on ground and also up there with amazing views.

The best part is to go by night since there is a beautiful light show that goes for 15 minutes. It is very hot and humid on summer so be prepared for that."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Must visit as its the identity of Singapore! Skywalk is a must do whike here. Its a suspended walkway and takes you right in middle of these magnificent structures.
,,Very good light show,5.0,,The light show is at 7 45PM. Very good music and light show along with view of marina bay sands at night.
,,Wow! Awe inspiring,5.0,,"We visited these trees with our kids, 5, 8 and 11. We stayed for the light show. The music accompanying the show changes and we had 'show tunes'. My son called it grandma's playlist, however, we enjoyed laying under the trees in the balmy night air enjoying the show."
,,Fantastic night show!,5.0,,"Check the schedule, but it was amazing a fantastic light show, all the trees were lit up. But arrive early, it was busy! Afterwards, go round to the hawker center and have a cold beer and satay!"
,,SPECTACULAR,4.0,,"This Supertree Grove is so beautiful and a marvel and credit to the planners, builders and gardeners. It's interesting to see how the various orchids and other plants grow on these structures and beautify the area. Visually a treat."
,,Super tree Grove with 3 kids,5.0,,This is a stunning construction with around 10 or 12 huge 'trees'. The best time to come is in the evening when they are illuminated. Go for the light and music show at 7:45PM or 8:45PM. Get there 10 to 15 minutes early and sit on the ground as the place fills up quickly. Most people sit or lie on the ground to watch the show that lasts about 15 minutes. It is free and excellent! There are places to eat nearby such as McDonalds or the more impressive Satay by the Bay which is a hawkers food market.
,,Magical,5.0,,Felt like in wonderland seeing the multicolored lights dancing with the music. A real treat for those of us seeing it and hearing the show for the very first time.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Last time in Singapore we visited in the day time, this visit was at night to experience the lights, we were not disappointed, it’s quite spectacular at night with all of the supertrees lit up, I’m still undecided which is the better time to visit, I would suggest if you have the time to visit during daylight and do the top walk to soak up the views, and re-visit at night as its totally different - well worth the effort, most importantly don’t forget the camera and tripod to capture some great photos. Great attraction…"
,,Another must see,4.0,,Nice during the day and spectacular at night . Not to be missed . Informative and done on a grand scale ;.
,,Supertree Grove,5.0,,Fantastic sound and light show. Do not miss this amazing show. The colours are stunning and the concept unlike any other.
,,Awesome View!,5.0,,Highly recommend doing the sky-walk at the top of the super trees. The view was absolutely amazing and got some great photos of the gardens and the Singapore flyer. Also worth going at night as there is beautiful light show.
,,What's not to love?,5.0,,"Free music and lights show - win! We especially loved it because July's soundtrack was musical theatre songs and it had lots of people singing along. The Supertrees look amazing at night. We arrived in time for the 7:45pm show and had planned to watch it from across the water to get a wide view....Took about 1 minute to realise the music was only pumped into the area directly below the Supertrees, and it's really a lot better with music! So we wandered around the gardens until the 8:45pm show, which were nice to check out as well. We considered trying to watch the light show from the walkway up in the Supertrees too, but it's kind of difficult to time it right since there's a line to go up in the evenings. The view was fantastic from the ground anyway so I wouldn't stress too much about the walkway."
,,"Not as pretty as the pictures, the night show is boring",3.0,,"The pictures make it much prettier than what it really looks like. The lights are quite dim in real life. The night show is also boring, just flashy lights. I'm not a big fan of this."
,,Wish I could give it more stars!,5.0,,I visited here with my family on our holiday from the UK to Singapore. I can honestly say this is one of the best attractions I have ever been to! It's probably even up there with one of the best experiences of my life. We visited in the day for the views of the trees and went up the walk way for just $5. The views are spectacular and something I've never seen in any other city. We then went back in the evening to experience the night show (7:45pm or 8:45pm) which did not disappoint. Sitting under the trees as they light up with music was so magical and truly a highlight of the holiday. Fantastic!
,,Stunning Supertrees,4.0,,"We saw the trees by day and were quite impressed, as we were by the flower and cloud dome. We came back as part of a night tour to see the light show. The trees are just beautiful at dusk when they are illuminated with soft purple light. The very short laser and music light show we thought was very much overhyped. I doubt if it lasted 10-12 minutes and the crowds were huge. Probably would never return again for the night show, but might try to see the illuminated trees from a distance."
,,Holidays 2017,5.0,,Well worth a visit - the light show is great fun - have your camera ready. Everyone departs at the same time so it can get a bit hectic.
,,Amazing during the day and stunning at night!,5.0,,Would recommend you buy a ticket for the skywalk way and staying for the light show accompanied by music!
,,MINDBLOWING,5.0,,The show was soooo beautiful. should not miss it. starts around 7.45. You can visit the garden free of cost and then there are some places in it where you should pay.
,,Loved the lights at night!,5.0,,"We visited during the day and decided to come back at night to do the Sky Walk. I'm so glad we did! There is a light show choreographed to music at night, and I wish we would have timed it so as to be on the Sky Walk at the same time as the show! Nevertheless, the views of Singapore at night were spectacular. One of our favorite places from our trip!"
,,Unique and beautiful,5.0,,"I visited the supertrees late at night when I first arrived in Singapore. Walking around while it was quiet was great. They are beautiful to just lay under, and watch them change colours.

I went back the following day, to just wander the whole park. It's a great place to relax, and enjoy."
,,Beautiful gardens,3.0,,"The Supertrees are an interesting concept and are surrounded by all sorts of native flora. The are good dining options though nothing exceptional. The evening light show was mildly interesting though not worth sticking around for just for the sake of doing so. The best part is the bar at the top of the largest tree, which cost 20SGD for entry but included a beverage. The beverage selection was weak, so go for a drink, enjoy the view, and then move on."
,,SO HIGH,5.0,,These are great - go on the bridge and take photos - something special. Stay for the night time shows they are AMAZING!!!!!!
,,Go twice - night and day,5.0,,"We did two stops here, one in the morning and one later the same evening. That was a good move! The morning stop was perfect for walking on the bridges between the trees. It was hot, but when you got up there, the wind acted as natural AC. Then we went back in the evening to watch the light show, and that was also a cool experience. Free of charge, I might add. Do both, if you have the time."
,,Superrrtreeee!,4.0,,Supertree grove is near the gardens by the bay. Go here at night as it is beautifully lit up and ideal for photographs and having a calm stroll.
,,beautiful,5.0,,"I loved it, and also the skyway was the best, i would recommend to go there at night, and also the show was amazing"
,,Plan for an evening,4.0,,Best to visit the Super tree grove in the evening when the sun is about to set so that you can see the Groves getting lightened up. Go for the sky walk through the Groves.
,,Good music during the light show,5.0,,"If you're staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel, you could probably skip the night show since you can watch it from your window. However, if you're able to watch the night show in person, it is a cool experience for the pictures."
,,Go by day,4.0,,Daytime it is peaceful and you can get right up close to the trees. In the evenings there are crowds with selfie poles. Better seen a little distance away when lit up. Fabulous idea to show off orchids. Extra has to be paid to walk on the raised pathway. It isn't worth it.
,,A must see,5.0,,"I just loved the Supertrees. They beg the question ""why are they there"" but they just are, and they are beautiful. If you make the effort to go see them, pay the bit extra d go for the walk on the sky bridge amongst them. It's a different perspective of them and a beautiful view too."
,,Celebration of human creativity and engineering,4.0,,"A beautiful garden built in a landfill in Singapore. If nothing else, visit to enjoy the amazing creativity of mankind, and see how we can build an incredible park out of nothing."
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,Lovely to wander around in daytime and evening. The music and light show at night is terrific with a great atmosphere as thousands of people arrive to sit and watch.
,,Iconic place in Singapore,5.0,,The spot is beautiful both at day time and night time. I would recommend going at 5pm and then you can watch the sunset while waiting for the night view of the flower domes. It's worth visiting.
,,Fantastic idea,5.0,,These are amazing and well worth visiting. There is a charge for going on the walkways between the trees.
,,Spectacular light and sound show!,4.0,,"We had a great evening at Gardens By the Bay's Garden Rhapsody light & sound show yesterday. The lights and music are beautiful! They have daily shows at 745pm and 845pm. It can be crowded during weekends, if you are going, bring a mat, be there slightly earlier to find a good spot and enjoy the show!"
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"I like futuristic places consequently, I had to visit this place. I haven't been deceived. I went there at night for the sound and light free show they have everyday at 7:45 pm and 8:45pm.
We arrived there at 7:45, so we just sat at the first 3 trees we saw but we realized that the main site was a little further where 10 trees are gathered.
We have appreciated the show and the little stroll in the park.
The same evening, you can combine the 2 sound and light show since the free show at Marina Bay sands starts everyday at 8pm and 9:30 pm."
,,Great visual highlight,5.0,,"Very well choreographed light show in the evenings. Enjoyable for all ages. Walkway tickets sell out very early, be aware. Easy to get to, really well organised. And free!"
,,The supertree group is magnificent but the light show is just average,3.0,,"If you are just target for the supertrees and are not interested in plants, then no need to buy tickets for the flower dome and cloud forest. The park is open to public for free. You can enjoy the outer part of the park and the supertrees. The light show is not attractive when compared to the laser show in Marina Bay."
,,Blah blah blah,2.0,,"I don't understand why are people so amazed by this place. The light show that they have after sunset is just disappointing... simple projection of flower photos, without much structure or artistic direction."
,,Light show,4.0,,"Our trip just for the light show was wonderful. It was a bit weird at our first visit seeing the crowd sitting on the big floor as there are no obvious seating area. It made a lot of sense after that choosing where you sit to view the light show is quite important. Nevertheless, even if you didn't get a view of the whole place, the light music show will certainly be an eye opener. It even made us forget about the crowd!"
,,Walking in tree tops,5.0,,"If you're not affraid of hights and want to enjoy vast views, this is the attraction for you. I loved it, while my husband stayed firmly on the ground (taking pics of me up in the sky)."
,,Super Tree,4.0,,"Its an artificial super tree which get lights up @ night and gives very nice view, you can just visit up there by paying the entry fees and there got lot more things to do up there.. you can go walk around the bridge up there and have the resto too. Should try."
,,Garden Rhapsody is amazing,5.0,,I highly recommend the Garden Rhapsody music and light show. It is free and memorizing. The one I saw was set to music from Broadway. Amazing!!!!
,,a tribute to musical theatre,5.0,,"I don't know how long this show will last but as a huge musical theatre fan, this was fantastic!

People come early to stake out seats around the seating area of the trees. However, when it starts to get dark and closer to the time of the show, people can also sit on the ground. We were a little concerned about not having seating, but we just sat down on the ground and it was fine. If you are worried about hygiene than bring a picnic blanket to sit on. I saw some people with picnics and food which was a great idea as you wait for the show to start.

It's a long queue of taxis at the end of the evening so plan accordingly or just be willing to wait it out."
,,Supertree lives on,5.0,,This is a amazingly well compiled musical show of 30 minutes; the lights and music keep flipping every few sec on the numerous super trees. Well worth the visit.
,,Simply beautiful!,5.0,,"These structures are amazing pieces of architecture, and there are evening light shows that are free to attend. Would definitely recommend if you're visiting Gardens By The Bay (which you should be anyways)!"
,,Wonderous,5.0,,"It is amazing as every bit you imagine and you saw in the movies. you will need to see them in the day time and at night. So amazing. Avoid rainiy or thunderstorm days, since they shut down the second level where you can get up there during sunny days."
,,lovely view of the Singapore skyline,4.0,,"Interesting spot to enjoy the view on the Singapore skyline, especially the night. We have enjoyed very much the bar on the tree."
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"Oh wow, the views are phenomenal. My husband is scared of heights but was happy to do the Supertree Grove walk as he felt safe. You only get 15 minutes up the Supertree, but that is enough and you don't feel hurried at all.

At night these tree are lit up and make for some stunning photos."
,,Night outing,5.0,,Love to visit the place during the night time as weather is just nice for a walk in the park. Do check the show timing of the Supertree lighting. Enjoyed watching the lights dance along with the music.
,,Best places on earth,5.0,,This is one of my favorite places on earth! At night it's so calm it makes you feel like you're floating on another dimension! The trees are amazing a the lights take my breath away! Love love love!!!!
,,Okay,3.0,,"This is supposed to be a ""must see"" in Singapore which I don't totally agree on. It's alright, pretty cool but really nothing special if you ask me, so if you have other opportunities don't choose this over something else!"
,,A must to see - do the later show for better effect,5.0,,"Definitely a must to see. We attended the first show and it was still a bit light when it started so I would wait til the later show. You don't really need to pay to go on the skywalk as you are only allowed up there for twenty minutes and it does move, so people who don't like heights should keep this in mind. The show can be seen better from the ground as it lights up mostly under all the tress. Allow a bit of time to leave as the crowds are all trying to leave the same small exits and it becomes very pushy and crowded."
,,Must,5.0,,It is a must see. Discovere what a man can do without polite the environment. These trees release oxygen. Go there through marina bay sands at bay front mrt station
,,Futurism is here!,5.0,,"It's out of this world, imaginative and compelling to visit both day and at night. Take an umbrella or hat, and water and enjoy the day, otherwise it can be uncomfortably warm. Can't miss!"
,,A beautiful little adventure and discovered a peaceful haven!,5.0,,"The urban city was too bight to see any stars at night, so I off to Garden Rhapsody -a free light & sound show at OCBC Skyway & Supertrees – at 7.45pm & 8.45pm nightly, to see the beautiful dancing “stars”.

Pause and enjoyed, So beautiful! Yes, I discovered another peaceful haven in Singapore. Have a relaxing lovely stroll at the Silver Garden on a windy night and saw some NPD’s firework! Wow, lucky me!

Many benches and seating spaces for resting on the way to savour the serene urban night or people watching. So safe to stay out late and that special holiday feeling was with me everywhere."
,,Spectacular! Do the Skywalk!,5.0,,"This was so amazing I temporarily forgot my fear of heights! The lights, music and atmosphere all combined to create an unforgettable experience for me and my family, and the skywalk is definitely worth doing... until the music stopped and I realised I was 22m in the air on a slightly swaying, narrow footbridge! Still great fun, and very safe for all ages."
,,Super trees all around,5.0,,Mandatory to visit and during evening hours only so as to have look at amazing lights on these man made super trees. Sky walk is Pricey but not to be missed. Clean and amazing. You can also dine out and have so many Indian cuisines also.
,,Out of this world!,5.0,,Fantastic. Go early in the morning to save queuing for a ticket and then again gueing for the lift to get to the walkways. Superb photo shots. However the best time is just before dark 7pm and during the light and sound show. Bear in mind that's what everyone seems to do so be aware of long lines.
,,"So beautiful, wow!",5.0,,"They really manicure and keep their gardens just perfect, it's amazing how the whole city looks, but these Supertree's are pretty cool! And at dusk, they have a laser light show on the big trees,which is pretty cool. Nothing spectacular as my husband was expecting, but still a great chilled out night to go for a stroll through."
,,Take the walk for the view,4.0,,The walk in the sky with the backdrop of Marina Bay Sands makes for great experience and lots of lovely pics :)
,,SuperTree Grove is Superb !!!,5.0,,"Supertree Grove, one on the mandatory attraction in the Gardens By the bay. The tree is huge and the lightnings in the night time is jst awesome and i would recommend all the tourist to visit it. Kids might enjoy it very much. I would also recommend taking a walk in the OCBC sky way,which is between 2 supertrees :) the View of Marina Bay sands from the sky way is magnificent."
,,Very beautiful garden,5.0,,"Very beautiful and large garden. To get here, you do not need to spend money, because it is free. But if you want to climb to the top of a tree and see the sights of Singapore from above, it takes a little extra money, but not expensive. Very amazing!"
,,Awesome spectacle every night!,5.0,,"The show that starts at 7.45 (I think, possibly before?) and goes on every hour is just fabulous, in a cheesy, clean living sort of way! It's cute; people come early to get a good spot to chill out or lie down to get comfortable for when the show starts. Lasts about 10-15 minutes. It's very busy on wknds and the rush for the MRT afterwards was interesting. Defo go to the light show though, I doubt you will be disappointed."
,,Don’t miss the light show at night,5.0,,"This place was very specky during the day but at night they have a couple of special light shows and as it was leading up to Christmas they did a medley of Christmas Carols. Just magic to sit on the lawn and listen and watch.

You can also go up in the trees and walk on the skywalk. Unfortunately we missed out on this as it rained and then closed. Maybe next visit and ill also conquer my fear of heights."
,,"Something different, but worthwhile!",4.0,,Go there an take a walk through this supertree park. Nice to read the information boards to know what these supertrees does and how eco friendly they are. Nice to go up and do the walk way!
,,Impressive and entertaining,5.0,,"Every night after sunset, the lights of these man-made trees are coordinated with music for quite an impressive show. We chose to be on the skywalk when the light show started. WOW! That was incredible. I have a fear of heights so I couldn't totally enjoy it, but it was great. I think I would have liked it better if I was on the ground watching, looking up. Either way, this is an impressive engineering feat."
,,Very nice evening music show - not to miss!,5.0,,I can warmly recommend to visit during the evening shows when it's slightly cooler. Very different and nice music / illumination show that you have never seen before!
,,Dazzling Light Show.,5.0,,The nightly night show set to Broadway hits from the decades is a free show and well worth the time in your schedule. The show is only about 15 minutes. It did take a long time to leave because of traffic. S take your time and walk slowly to avoid the crowds leaving.
,,Colorfull Supertree,4.0,,"Try to visit this garden at night, you will like the colorful light on the high tree. It feels like you in outer space with a lot of star."
,,Dazzling,5.0,,A night light show to be remembered - these rather bizarre man-made trees come to life at night and with the light show accompanied by an amazing musical score
,,brilliant,5.0,,awesome spot to soak it all in .. very clever design.do the walk at sunset just brilliant love the atmosphere at this place - unites everyone
,,Amazing,5.0,,We went during the day and were mesmerized by the impressiveness of the trees. It is incredible how unique and beautiful this ecofriendly attraction is.
,,Over rated,2.0,,"There was a lot of anticipation for the light show that happens twice every night. We were at the later session. When it finally came on it was surprisingly lame. Not nearly as good as many light shows I have seen around the world. The trees are built on a grand scale and a bit weird; certainly different. Maybe it was the angle I was on, but there was no 'wow' factor."
,,Unlicke anything else in the world,5.0,,The supertrees are a must see on every trip to the LionCity. They are impressive and beautiful. A great place to bring kids to as well.
,,Is this real life?,5.0,,"When I visited this park, I thought to myself, Am I in the earth I'm used to live in? This attraction takes the cake!"
,,Glory supertree at night,5.0,,It's amazing when you experience this scenery at night time. The colors and height of the tree make this place unique in Singapore. Do not miss this when you visit the Garden by the bay.
,,WOW!! what a show,5.0,,If you get there during the daylight first so that you can experience it both day and night. Once the sunsets they put on an amazing light show to music at about 7pm
,,Wonderful experience watching the light show at night,5.0,,These are man made tree like structures covered with small plants. There is a restaurant in one of the super trees and a sky walk to reach it.
,,It's very clean and relaxing place,5.0,,We enjoy walking and taking picture it's safe even too high it's so enjoyable and affordable . Definitely I will recommend to all my friends and relatives to visits the garden of the bay Singapore .
,,Unbelievably Stunning,5.0,,"This was the highlight of my visit to Singapore. An incredible example of technology and nature that only gets better when the sun sets. Dinner in one of the trees was amazing. Beautiful food, great service and a stunning view. What more could one ask for."
,,Early morning Jog,4.0,,"Great place to take an early morning walk or jog. Spectacular gardens, make sure to check out the otters playing in the harbor nearby."
,,Wonderful visit,5.0,,"The gardens are a MUST DO on a visit to Singapore. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit exploring the Cloud and flower domes the trees and gardens in general. The design innovation, planting detail all contribute to an uplifting exciting visit that remains long after you head home"
,,Daughter loved it,4.0,,My Daughter went and looked at the super tree grove personally I would have perfered to have all my teeth taken out . She loved it and went on and on about it
,,Lovely,5.0,,Get there by the ende of the afternoon when the temperature is falling. Choose a spot and wait to see the light show.
,,Go for the lights show,5.0,,The lights show were scheduled at 7:45p and 8:45p when we went. We had initially planned on doing the OCBC Skyway while the lightshow was on but being on the ground while it happened was better - you get a better view of the whole show (different supertrees light up to the music)
,,Supertree Grove a Family Friendly Night Excursion,5.0,,"The overall ecological concept was enthralling, as wer the Gardens in the Bay and the FREE night light display pure magic Thank you Singapore"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Went during the day and I bet it's even more stunning at night. It really is superb and we paid $8 each to go on the sky walkway, that was worth it. The park that it is set in is wonderful and there are a good many walks, there are also several restaurants cafes near the ticket office, fantastic place to go."
,,Electrifying wonder.....,5.0,,We were so excited to wait ......and when the lights turned on with accompanying music it was mesmerizing dance of lights & sounds....... A must see for everyone.
,,Great Views,5.0,,"A really unique attraction, the views from the top are great and as it's part of the marina Bay Gardens development, it's worth taking the time to have a look."
,,Amazing !!!,5.0,,Love the Garden. Very beautiful the light show at night. Nice to spend evening time with good walks .Its an amazing Garden
,,Avatar kind of magic,5.0,,"We went to visit the threes at night, which was absolutely magical. It was free of charge, and from the Gardens you also had a very nice view of the Marina Bay Sands Skypark, which gave it even mỏre spacey vibes."
,,Architects gone wild,4.0,,"I've walked past the Supertree Grove a number of times over the years but haven't previously had the opportunity to go up on the walkway. Collecting my annual membership for the gardens during a lunch break last week provided such an opportunity, and ti was a good time to do so as there really weren't too many other people there at the time (also the hottest time of the day, apart from not being a weekend day). I noticed signs saying that visits to the skybridge area are capped at 70 people and 15 min visits, so probably it is very busy on weekends. Well worth a visit."
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,"If you go here, make sure you go up the Supertrees for an amazing view of the park and Singapore. We hung around for the light show which was a little disappointing which didn't help as there seemed to be some sort of filming going on (looked like a wedding) and we were being told to move by men in black suits! Despite this, we timed our visit so we could sit and admire the Supertrees as the sun set and all the lights came on. A must see especially at night."
,,Very Creative and Inspiring Designs,5.0,,The Supertrees itself had very modern designs and the scenery was picturesque and very green! Will definitely go there next time to explore more!
,,Amazing,5.0,,This was an amazing experience. You definitely have to put this on Your to see and do list whilst visiting singspore. Take your camera.
,,Superb........:),5.0,,"Superb lighting with Theme in nights . iN day time, Its like as nothing But in Nights its like as heaven"
,,Worth the extra charge,4.0,,"Fantastic view high up between the Supertrees. Amazing view over the gardens and surrounding area. Just requires a small extra charge and a trip up in an elevator, and you are there."
,,Unusual and beautiful,5.0,,The walkway was closed when we visited so sadly we didn't get to do this but the supertrees are a wonderful sight all lit up as darkness falls and the scale of them is awe-inspiring. They were a good place to sit and have a coffee and watch night fall and do some people watching. if we ever get a chance to return I'll make sure that we get a chance to experience the walkway.
,,Go for it! You wont regret!,5.0,,Nothing like you will ever see in your life! Amazing artificial trees! The whole system is made in a very eco-friendly way. The walk through the skywalk is a must do!
,,Worth doing once,4.0,,"The views are great, the greenery is welcome and the engineering is interesting. This was a nice way to spend an hour, although the walk in the canopy was only 15 minutes or so of course."
,,A MUST Visit Place,5.0,,"It is beautiful by day, but spectacular by night when everything gets lit up. This a marvelous place to wander."
,,Awesome place,5.0,,"Once you been to gardens by the bay, you should visit here. Afternoon is good time. So that you get both day and evening view"
,,Supertrees,5.0,,The towering supertrees evoke a pandora feel especially at dusk when the lights are turned on. This is a must visit spot when you are in Singapore. I recommend for everyone experience the skyway as this gives an up-close look of the trees and a birds-eye view of the surroundings.
,,Trees and brew with a view,5.0,,"A must do in singapore. These Supertrees are amazing. Go up to the top and walk around the perimeter, be warned it is higher than you think. But great views. At 8pm they have a light show which is spectacular. The botanical gardens are beautiful to stroll through."
,,super super super tree !!,5.0,,Definitely go here..go around 7pm to enjoy the views in daylight and at dark too..they light up beautifully..the AVATAR TREES !! wow !!..take the sky walk for sure !!
,,Magnificent structures that continue to improve,4.0,,"When we were here 5 years ago, Gardens by the Bay was very new and the steel structures were in place with plants starting to grow at the bottom. 5 years later and a lot of the plants are half way up the structures with a couple even higher. Looks much better now and will be even better when the structures are covered with the plants. Nice walkway above the gardens between 2 of the structures which provides for a great view and some nice photos."
,,Marvellous sight,5.0,,Must see the sound & light show of 20 minutes at 7.30 PM. Its awesome although crowded a bit. Look at other places like Cloud Forest etc & then proceed few minutes early.
,,Fantastic man made structures located at Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,The Supertree Grove i one of the highlights of Gardens by the Bay and one of the most fascinating man made structures that you will find anywhere. It is worth visiting both during the day to admire the vines and other plants that wind their way around the structure and in the evening when the trees are lighted up.
,,Not as good as we expected,3.0,,"We were there for the 5th anniversary, there was a special show with dancers and an Acrobatic turn, with special lighting effects, there was also a display of drones. It was as expected very packed and views of the stage were obstructed. Admission to the elevated walkway around the trees was closed because of the occasion, this was rather disappointing as was the show, the best bit was the synchronised drones at the end. Getting out of the place was a nightmare, pathways had been blocked by barriers and it was utter chaos trying to get a taxi, the system is shambolic with people queue jumping and useless officials trying and making a complete hash of controlling the traffic and taxis. We stood for an hour before managing to get a cab."
,,Supertree Grove,5.0,,"Wow, wow, wow! Absolutely amazing! Just do it. You won't be sorry you did. You've got to see it to believe it."
,,avatara's home,5.0,,this garden looks like avatar's home in avatar the movie. in the night there's light performance that was so beautiful.
,,Should try to go here to see the evening light show,4.0,,"When we were here, they performed a Star Wars themed light show in the evening. Cool experience and good photo opportunities!"
,,Wow!,5.0,,"What an engineering marvel. A wonderful walk around at the base, but extraordinary to do the skywalk."
,,Prepare to stare,5.0,,"The pictures on the web and in the guide books do not do justice. So cleverly done.
We were there for the Star Wars Festival: real props from the sets...meet your favorite character.... games... figurines.... costumes... lightsabers....open air film viewings....Star Wars Fun Run....Light show after dark.
What a great place to have an event."
,,Nice place to visit,4.0,,"Nice place to visit, gets very busy when the sun starts to go down, light show couple of times a night. Queue for the skywalk ways lengthy and you have to get tickets before joinville the queue ."
,,must visit,5.0,,sit underneath the trees watch the show and be amazed. same as garden by the bay the supergrove tree is in gardens by the bay. sound and light show fantatsic get a cab to this destination its easier
,,Simply beautiful and great for photos,5.0,,Highly recommended stop which is just beside Marina Bay and Marina Bay Sands. The Cloud Forest nearby is worth a visit as well.
,,Watch the great light show,5.0,,"Fabulous spot to be when the sun goes down, and watch the light show in the grove...better than fireworks...so get there early
Just along from the grove are some great sculptures, and some amazing examples of petrified wood that looks as though it has been polished..."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Went there the first time, not long after it opened and have been back a few times.

For foreign visitors, I recommend finding using the MRT, at Marina Bay. It is so convenient.

For those who have more time and do not mind the heat, visit the Barrage which is in the same area."
,,Tip for the light show: Don't go,2.0,,"The Supertrees themselves are certainly impressive structures, but you get a good look at them when you visit Gardens By the Bay, so leave it at that. We made the mistake of going back for the 8:45 p.m. 'light show', which was a massive disappointment. For barely 15 minutes, a light is projected on to the trunks of the Supertrees, making colours appear but not in a particularly interesting way. For some reason we assumed the skeletal 'branches' of the Supertrees would light up or there would be laser beams or something, but it's all very dull. What's worse, the venue was very crowded with thousands of other punters, many of whom (like us) cried out in dismay when the 'show' ended (i.e. as if to say 'is that all?'). Then, when you fight you way back down to Bayfront MRT station, you will be forced to queue for MRT tickets unless you have a prepaid pass. It really isn't worth it. The only good thing is that you don't have to pay for the show."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,Felt a bit like I was in a scene from Avatar. Went at sunset and watched the light show which is like Vivid in Sydney Australia - then ate at the restaurant in the Supertree which is well worth it - although you don't see much through the windows unless you step outside. Some people put this place down as not being natural and too man made but I found it to be an oasis in the midst of Singapore's spectacular skyline and felt like it highlighted the importance of nature and our connection to it.
,,Nice ambience,3.0,,"Wanted to get a place at the rooftop bar but it was fully packed. Seat is first come first serve, so do with the restaurant. Magnificent view, place is classy but good wise is Mediocre imo .. but the view compensate it. u can have a chill n drink at the walkway outside the restaurant after dinning .."
,,Enjoying the light,4.0,,"I was there watching the show, it was enjoyed and fun to hang around with your friend, family or couple."
,,"Very nice, feel like a different world!",5.0,,Not to be missed and part of gardens attraction. These are amazing steel and concrete tree like structures that apparently also collect sunlight and water that is used to power and water the plants in the biosphere.
,,SuperSuperSuper,4.0,,We went in the heat of the day when the trees were not lit. I think waiting until dusk would be best. Food is a bit pricey and make sure you have water. Interesting to learn about the sustainable functions of these structures. Amazing!
,,a must see!,5.0,,this is the famous place in all the visit singapore videos on facebook. a must go just to see the supertrees. best to go in the evenings during the musical light show.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Gardens are free, we visited these during the day, had brunch then took the bus tour. We visited both domes then had drinks at the roof top restaurant in the largest super Tree. As the sun was setting we found a lovely spot on the lawn before watching the light show, absolutely superb. Amazing"
,,So and So Light show,4.0,,Did not really enjoy the light show. It was just did not meet my expectation. The light show was just some pictures being projected to the big trees. I wish they had better programming or something.
,,great place to visit,5.0,,"very good choices and fast service , good place to cool off in the hot weather and lots of seats so easy for families to go to"
,,Exciting,5.0,,"It is a very exciting attraction in Gardens by the Bay, it is a quick walk but it is worth paying for."
,,Stunning!!!,5.0,,A must visit after dark for the light show but go earlier to also take in the glass domes!! Quite an experience!!
,,Great exhibit,5.0,,"We went by day, but really wish we had time to see this a night? Next time. IT is something that is unique to Singapore and is enjoyable."
,,Incredible,5.0,,We actually caught a lift up to the top to the bar of one of these super trees - well worth the money incredible 360 degree view of Singapore.
,,Futuristic and eco-friendly at the same time,5.0,,"Visiting Gardens by the Bay, you can't skip seeing Supertrees. They are equipped with solar batteries and there is a light show every day after dusk so it's the best to visit when its already dark."
,,Combining nature with architecture,5.0,,Supertree Grove is located at Gardens By The Way. It's a magnificent architectural structures that allow you to go up to the 'skyway.' It's a good idea to go up during sunset for a more dramatic landscape view.
,,Be prepared,4.0,,"Now I don't want to be a stick in the mud, but we waited some 45 minutes in the heat and humidity for what was about a six minute presentation. Don't get me wrong, the presentation was excellent, but there were thousands here tonight and most brought rugs or other things on which to sit, clearly knowing there would be a long wait. The show started a tad late (which was annoying) and one of the projectors was mis-firing onto the main tree which could not be helped .... we happened to walk by for the second show and the projector had been repaired, so well done to the tech team for their prompt action here. Good restaurants nearby and were not nearly as pricey as I had expected ... food was good, too. Pick your night and make sure it is not going to rain as there is no shelter from where you will see the show. And, don't be fooled - no decent view from the roof top bar which costs $20 to enter ... watch from the ground or the skywalk if you can time it right."
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"Take a lift and be on top of the world, to have a birds eye view of the gardens and these incredible Supertrees. You can only stay up there for 15 minutes so make the most of it. p"
,,Free to visit.,5.0,,This is free to visit but you can pay extra to walk along the skywalk besides the trees. But you can get an excellent view from the ground and still see the light show. I would certainly recommend going!
,,Trees full of colors and lights,5.0,,This grove of artificial trees resemble nature and its worth spending an evening here. Take a stroll on the walkway and watch the light show after evening. Entry to the garden is free!!
,,Amazing Light Show !,5.0,,"One more engineering marvel blended with nature.These man made Super trees are surrounded by lush green natural garden.Visit can be planned from late afternoon to late evening as there 2 shows each day after 7.00 pm.The visit can be best clubbed with Flower Dome and Cloud Forest.No entrance fee for this attraction.The best way to enjoy this show is to laydown near the Super Tree structure and if you plan so ,plan to be at the attraction at least 1 hour before the show."
,,Wow,5.0,,"When the lights start spectacle is really impressive , wonderful to take a walk there inside the trees while taking a look to marina bay . Better to visit after 7pm."
,,Amazing,5.0,,We visited the Supertree Grove on our first night in Singapore as we were very excited to see this sight! .You can get some great photos of these trees and you could spend a few hours here taking it all in. Best of all its free to visit.
,,Very exciting!,5.0,,"Don't miss the Supertree Grove when you visit The Gardens by the Bay!! There is a small additional charge to climb up to the walkway but the views and the whole experience are well worth it! Views of the Gardens, biomes and cityscape are magnificent!"
,,Great adventure!,5.0,,I tried 3 times to go up through the walk but always was too late :( It is better to buy tickets (about 12 dolars) before 8 pm. If you don't manage there is the biggest tree and you can also go up for 20 dollars and have 1 drink included in the restaurants. Views are cool
,,A 'Must See' attraction in Singapore!,5.0,,Try doing the supertree high-rise walk in the late afternoon and stay for the light show. Fantastic. We laid on the ground looking up at the sky and were mesmerised for 30 minutes!
,,"Music, Lights... Fun",4.0,,"The light show of super tree grove is awesome.. 2 - 3 shows in the evening.. A wonderful experience.. The Music, Lights... Its wonderful.."
,,Interesting location if you have some time to spare,4.0,,We took a tour around the gardens on the local transport which took about 20 mins and we enjoyed the commentary. Well worth a visit
,,Man-made trees,5.0,,"This cluster of man-made metallic trees covered with real greens at the base presents an excellent view. It has a restaurant at the top of the tallest tree, which is unique. The trees are illuminated with coloured lights in the night, presenting an delightful view."
,,Always beautiful but light show is short,4.0,,"This is my second time visiting this area and it is beautiful! Must-see, but please understand the light show is short. Maybe 30 minutes at the absolute most! Most people just sit on the ground and watch then continue walking around. Don't follow the beaten path. This area is beautiful and if you have time explore the bridges. There are restaurants in this area since it is part of the Garden by the Bay. An alternative to spending more money on food is to have a picnic with the kiddos. The kid area is amazing (full with water falls, slides and jungle gyms). This site has everything!"
,,Lighting Show on Sundays is Mesmerizing,5.0,,"The lighting show on Sunday Evenings is mesmerising. The show is also accompanied by Songs. They play Chinese, Hindi and English Songs in the show. The sheer beauty of the artificial Groves is magical. You should try and visit during Christmas. There is a lot of crowd, yet the show is very beautiful during Christmas. Also, try to come in early to stand in the queue to get your tickets to walk on the hanging ropeway which connects the Groves together."
,,Masterpiece,5.0,,"This is really a masterpiece, many Supertree around the Garden, which is huge and functional. You can enjoy the light and music show at the night with 2 sessions everynight"
,,Go to the Bar,4.0,,"We ended doing the skywalk, which was neither here or there, but got a couple of good photos of our hotel. Go at sunset and get yourself to the bar at the top, great view."
,,Excellent Light Show,5.0,,"As mentioned in my review for Gardens of the Bay, this Super tree Grove is situated in the gardens and it is on these towers that the light display in the evening is shown. Highly recommended for all the family to enjoy and there is no entry fee to the Light Show."
,,Don't miss the light show,5.0,,"We have our favorite spot to watch this light show, with the Marina Bay Sand at the backdrop. Fantastic view."
,,15 minutes light show,3.0,,"Light show is fine but free at 19:45,20:45 pm Last about 15 minutes easy walk from mrt Have walkway on the top cost lower than 10$"
,,Lovely show,5.0,,It was a pleasure to the eyes . Nice treat of visual display and music . Great place to enjoy the evening .
,,Light Show is mesmerizing,5.0,,Don't miss the Light show at Supertree Grove. Timings are 7:40 PM and 8:40 PM everyday. You can plan the Gardens by the Bay Domes in evening and after that attend the show.
,,Stunning display,5.0,,"Seeing the evening light and sound shows id the highlight, and is well worth making the quick trip to get there."
,,Sci-fi beauty,4.0,,"It is part of gardens by the bay and is open till 3am with no entry ticket. So, you can just go there anytime and immerse in the beauty. Best time to visit is late evening when there is not much crowd. You can just lie on the floor and relax surrounded by the canopy of supertrees.
There is also indochine bar at top of the biggest superteee. You can go there as well. But its not the best roof top view. Marina bay sanda definitely provides the best city views."
,,Light show at night,4.0,,"The supertree grove is an outdoor area. Lovely to walk during the day but it's rather hot since it's outdoors. However, at night it's also lovely as there are two light shows available 7.45pm or 8.45pm. It's Free!
Unfortunately the light show only last for a short time of around 9 mins. Great spot to take pics and just experience something different for the day."
,,Worth a look but not the best in the park,4.0,,We went to the park and spent many hours there and these are super cool but in my opinion the domes are cooler!
,,Interesting but not captivating,3.0,,"While these are impressive looking structures from a distance, there isn't much more to them up close. They reside in a lovely garden area and there is a canopy walk (though I didn't go so can't rate). At night they have a light show that is pretty average. The park and Cloud Dome are the better attractions here."
,,AMAZING TREES,5.0,,"We did a night time tour that included the night light show with these magnificent trees. Very colourful and beautiful greenery everwhere. There is also a big lawned area where you can sit and have a picnic if you wanted while waiting for the light show.
Thoroughly recommend this"
,,go for the light show,5.0,,the main reason for going to the gardens by the bay beautiful trees and an extraordinary light show well worth going to it
,,$8 well spent,5.0,,"It cost me $8 to buy a ticket for the OCBC Skyway that links the 120m long walkway halfway up these man-made trees and it was well spent.
The views across the park and towards the Marina Bay Sands Hotel are breathtaking, and if you are not afraid of heights and can look down looking down on the top of real trees is interesting too.
You can choose to walk up the stairs to the walkway - but why bother when there is a perfectly good lift...
There are notices warning you of a 20 minute time limit up on the walkway - but the 2 staff members up there made no attempt to hurry you along - they did spend most of their time taking photos for visitors. The only thing they did enforce was only going in the one direction - not walking back to the start.
When I went up they did warn me that there was a threat of rain and if lightning was seen anywhere the skyway would be closed without refund. (The rain held off so was OK - but nice to know they had safety paramount, not a good idea being high up on a metal tree in a storm!)
There's a lift down again at the other end too."
,,Spectacular even in the day,4.0,,"Walked around the outside, impressive, but obviously would look even better when lit up at night. Colourful and pretty."
,,Integral to Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,This is the Music & light show at night... interesting by day... mind-blowing by night- for all the family....
,,"Initially thought them to be steel imitation trees, but truly innovative bio structure.",5.0,,"Regret that this place was my last visit in the city. These supertrees are the central features of this massive garden. They provide a massive structure for variety of vines and plants to flourish. A brilliant way to create a ""rain forest"" in the middle of this overbuilt city."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Such a cool concept! The light show was wonderful. It was Star Wars themed the night we went. Get there early, as it gets pretty crowded. There's a Sky Walk that you can walk around the trees on an aerial bridge. Definitely a must see in Singapore!"
,,Exciting Skyway,5.0,,So thrilled when we were up there in the OCBC Skyway connecting the Supertree Grove! It was such a wonderful view looking down at the ground and looking far beyond the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. We were just lucky there were only a few people walking up in the skyway thus we were able to take pictures with not much people in our front or in our background.
,,The trees are singapore personified,4.0,,"Singapore is a perfect symbiosis of the man made and natural world, these trees are exactly that and are very symbolic. You can get a good quota of philosophical thinking by admiring these goliaths"
,,Good place but we missed the light show due to bad wheather,3.0,,The attraction looks nice enough with lights and other items and park with a nice view of flyer. but the light show was cancelled due to bad whether so didn't see the actions
,,Nice views,5.0,,We walked on the platform which connects the super trees and found the views were amazing. The price of $8 was well worth it
,,if there is a place there i will never forget probably this is it!,5.0,,such a view.. such a place.. this is a must to see in Singapore.. mostly on night time when you will feel to be out of a fantasy movie... wow...
,,amazing,5.0,,Amazing views from the walkway and the light show is well worth a visit. 15min time on the walkway is enforced more in the evening.
,,Must visit in evening,5.0,,"The light show is a must to attend , it will mesmerize you by its beauty and musical coordination. The Supertree Groves are magical to watch."
,,This really is a must see,5.0,,"Make sure you visit at the right time to see the light show (twice per night 7:45 and 8:45). Consider having a drink at the top of the biggest tree ($20 entry includes a drink), the view is very nice!"
,,Great!,5.0,,"Really good and especially when you know that these trees are self sustaining by collecting energy from the sun during the day to power their lights at night.
The light show at night wasn't as good as i thought but it's still good to see them all alight at night anyway"
,,"Massive trees, light shows at night",4.0,,"The trees tower above the visitors, pouring in just before the light show is scheduled to start. The show is set to music, currently 'Star Wars', I believe it changes seasonally. Show is beautiful, visitors sit on the ground."
,,Super tree Grove,5.0,,"This is one amazing place to visit. These structures are a marvel of environmental engineering and architecture. This site is even features on BBC's Planet Earth 2, with Sir David Attenborough (Cities episode). Singapore is really on the forefront of being modern while environmentally responsible. to avoid the hottest part of the day, since this is not very shady, you may want to visit in the early morning or late afternoon into the evening. They have awesome light shoes, I was lucky to be there for the Star Wars one, back in May of 2017. Honestly, writing a review about this place doesn't do it justice, please visit and you'll understand. Safe travels!"
,,The best part of gardens by the bay,5.0,,Was free and outside the admission area Little confusing to get here but absolutely worth it must visit in Singapore
,,Super cool !!,5.0,,"It was really amazing, the crowd was actually started 15 min prior to the show. Need you standby near the area of Supertree to witness it very well. Some people were even standing on the bridge."
,,Excellent - almost felt like tightrope walking?,5.0,,"This is well worth paying the $8 entry fee to walk along the suspended tree walkway, but beware it is only open dependent on the weather conditions since it is exposed to the wind and rain etc. It wouldn't suit people with fear of exposed heights though."
,,Star wars at The Supertrees,4.0,,"We visited the Supertree Grove on our first night in Singapore as we were very excited to see this sight! it is a set of 'Trees' which have plants growing up the 'Trunks' a very ecological installation.

You alight at the MRT stop 'Bayfront' to get here and it is a short walk to the grove itself. Bayfront is right underneath the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Skypark- if you want to visit here at the same time (Or later.)

you can see the Trees from a viewpoint right near the Bayfront exit before you walk down, also.

We arrived at the Grove just as the evening light show was about to start (7:45pm) and the theme was Star Wars. I guess the themes change, but I am not sure how regularly.

This was fab as we love Star Wars. Lights and sounds (Star wars music in this case) were played in time with the light show. Which was fascinating to watch and a lot of fun. It lasts for around 15 minutes and you can stand below or sit nearby and enjoy the show.

There are small stalls to get drinks and ice cream nearby that ring bells to attract attention before and after shows.

You can also visit the restaurant which is at the top of the main Supertree. and do the path between the trees- named the OCBC Skyway as this is the sponsor. This is $8 SGD and closes early evening (around 17:30pm when we were there.)

We didn't do this as we had planned to visit Marina Bay Skypark later in the trip; which is the highest view of the city.

Recommend this sight, it is different and very beautiful, both night and day."
,,REALLY amazing... never seen anything like it!,5.0,,I'm yet to see it in the night time but it's an amazing sight to see them tower over. The trees uses renewable energy to light up at night so they don't cost extra energy - very cool!
,,Great exhibit,5.0,,The supergrove trees are great to visit especially at night when they light up with many different colours. You can get some great photos of these trees and you could spend a few hours here taking it all in. Best of all its free to visit.
,,Best witnessed at night,4.0,,"These huge ""trees"" are lit up at night and can be viewed from a large distance away. We paid to vist them during the day but probably shouldn't have bothered as we had an excellent view of their night displays from a hotel balcony."
,,Pure magic!!!,5.0,,"The supertree grove is a magical area within the Gardens by The bay.
It feature numerous supertrees, with some of them connected by a skybridge.
While the grove looks wonderful during the day, it looks absolutely BREATHTAKING after dark, when it becomes a magical place, as if taken from the movie ""Avatar"".
The supertrees are huge and plants grow on them.
We've already visited the grove 5 years ago, but it was equally impressive to return now, and see the grove grow even more.
Words fail to emphasize just how magical this place is, and we can honestly say it was worth flying to the other part of the planet - to visit this magical and majestic grove.
Do not miss it!!!"
,,"This one is the Biggest, at the Center and Free!!",4.0,,"In the Gardens by the Bay, this one is the biggest grove at the center of the Gardens. You will find the most activity here as this is the free one and has a free sound and music show too every night (though the show was not that good).

Worth going once to admire the achievements of human ambitions."
,,Such a good night treat,5.0,,"We had to hurry and gobble down our Texas Chicken meal to sit outside and watch the Supertree Groove. Science fiction movie set? With the StarWars theme song playing while showcasing the play of lights...we were on for a treat. It was pretty relaxing and amazing. We were lucky to see it from day to night (slowly seeing it lighted up was such a thrill). The walk going to the Marina Sands Hotel was also a chill time. No sweat at all as we enjoyed the view. The view inside the hotel was also nice.
#2017May21toJune3NayvesFamilyAdventure"
,,You have to see this,4.0,,Just take a look at this place and experience what engineering can achieve. When the vines grow all over the structures it will be breathtaking.
,,Innovative Creation,4.0,,"I took a walk along the park on one of the evenings that I was in Singapore. Though not technically breathtaking, this place still has its' charm and it is indeed mesmerising enough to want to attract you in just being there. The StarWars theme song was playing and showcasing on one of those nights and I was in for a treat to be amazed and awed by the play of lights on one of those two main trees. Park is so clean you could literally see tourists lying down on the streets and just look up at the fascinating creation. This is definitely another tick off the bucket list, at least for me."
,,A place to Relax and Unwind,4.0,,"We visited the Gardens by the Bay during a rather hot day, but it was lovely strolling around the beautiful rain forest trees and shrubs, particularly for someone from our dry Western Australia. Well worth a visit"
,,Man made something for nature,5.0,,"amazing views , next to marina bay sands hotel. one can vist till late night to see this trees from marina pathway"
,,"Awesome, even better at night.",5.0,,"This place is awesome. Spent most of a day here and then went on a tour at night which bought us back for the light show.
Well worth it at night, even with small kids, however it is super busy and hundreds turn up each night and get on / off buses so planing is the key to success here..."
,,5 minutes only,2.0,,"That was the time I spent here.

It was nothing spectacular and I didn't bother to wait for the light show. I don't expect it to be spectacular anyway.

After seeing real rainforest giants, this steel and concrete structure was a waste of time.

I understand it's function and the cosmetic appearance but really, one could learn the same if an exhibit was at a science centre, for instance."
,,Are we still on Planet Earth?,4.0,,"You may wonder if you're still on planet earth. These trees don't look much like all the others you've seen. But yet they COULD place for real, somewhere. A fun place to take the family."
,,A Very Impressive Sight,5.0,,"As part of the Garden by the Bay the Supertree Grove is free to visit. The 'trees' are really very impressive day or night. In the evening they are lit up by a specatcular light show (twice for 15 mins each). There is an ecological reason for them too, assisting water collection and 'green' power generation. Could not stop taking photos of them. Stunning when viewed from both ground level or the high level walkway between them at 'treetop' level."
,,5yr anniversary show ... very poor,1.0,,"While the standard 7.45/8.45 pm show is a blast ... the 5yr anniversary light show was supposed to be something special and the new benchmark. But unfortunately it turned out to be the most boring thing you can ask for. 5 mins after the show started most people have left already. Everyone has expected something good and not something boring.
You can that so much better guys ..."
,,Gardens turn 5 extravaganza special,5.0,,"On 3 June,we were at the Supertree Grove to join in the Gardens extravaganza special of Gardens By the Bay turn 5 celebration. The performance was super powerful and excellent."
,,Awesome garden,4.0,,Awesome garden which is one of a kind and not seen anywhere in Asia. Its a must visit and stay for the light show.
,,A must visit place,5.0,,This is number 1 - must visit place in sungapore. I recommend it to visit in night to see the amazing lights.
,,Don't miss its garden rhapsody!,5.0,,"It has a beautiful evening view! And if you can wait till 7:45pm or 8:45pm there, you can watch its featured rhapsody light show! It is awesome! And the evening I visited was of Star Wars theme.
The lights synchronise with the music and moods, which produces a brilliant light performance. You have to go there earlier to secure a place to watch the performance and lie on the ground to appreciate the light show.
However, as it is outdoor, you'd better prepare an umbrella to enjoy the show.
Enjoy!"
,,Awesome light show,4.0,,"Went here two times - one was during Christmas time, and the tree light show playing christmas carols. Recently in April I came here again to just watch the usual light show - I was stunned when it started with O Fortuna! You should try watching the light show while laying down on the floors / grass under the supertree. It's kinda psychedelic and mesmerizing :)"
,,Must visit for the light n sound sshow,5.0,,Amazing to sit here and watch the daily show. What a experience! Can't miss it in Singapore. Just exit 5 min early to beat the taxi rush.
,,Garden Turns 5 Celebration,5.0,,We were glad we came to catch the special show on 3 Jun 17 to celebrate the 5th anniversary of this garden. The show was amazing. The light show is different from the usual show too. A must see.
,,Skywalk is amazing,4.0,,The supertree grove is an amazing feat of engineering - and once the foliage has completely covered the structures they will be stunning. We walked the skywalk and were able to look closely at the foliage and take pictures from all angles. Didn't manage to get there at night - but then something to look forward on our next visit to Singapore.
,,Super!,5.0,,"Wow!

I can't even begin of how I can describe this huge tree. If you haven't been here or at Singapore, you better book that flight and go here. Its better to see it up close than in the pictures.

Its one of Singapore's iconic landmark and I must say that I agree. I went there late afternoon and stayed until it was night. The supertrees gives shade during the day and at night they come alive with lights and sounds.

You'll never get bored when you're around Marina Bay as they shops, stores and good food everywhere.

I will definitely go back here."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"Stunning engineering feat, the skywalk is amazing. A 'must see' experience when visiting Singapore. The 'trees' are going to look amazing when the plants have grown to the tips of the branches."
,,"""The whole world needs these trees""",5.0,,"This is just a fantastic place to visit, a must see in Singapore,go back at night time to watch the light show."
,,Fascinating!,5.0,,We went there around 7 p.m and the trees were already lighted. Looking at the gigantic trees that changes color from pink to green and other shades is just fascinating.
,,Come for the light show!!!,5.0,,It will speak for itself when you see it! It was one of the most beautiful man made things I have yet come to whitness
,,Excellent to see,4.0,,"It is part of the Gardens by the bay and would have rated as a five if you didnt have to pay extra to get into the attraction. Well worth doing but you are only on the sky walk for 10/15 minutes which makes it quite expensive compared to the relative good value for money when just visiting the Gardens.

Al in all though worth going to see"
,,Supertree Grove Light Show,5.0,,"I went to the Supertree Grove light show during my visit last may in Singapore and I had a really good time.
It was very relaxing to just seat there and watch the show which by the way this time was about Disney and Starwars. I thought it was a bit weird but anyway, it was really cool just to be there.
I would recommend it to family, friends, etc..."
,,"Well worth a,visit",4.0,,Very well laid out garden with different ecosystems displayed. I would like to have been there in the evening to see the Christmas lights on.
,,Amazing,5.0,,We came exactly at 7.45pm when it started! What a wonderful experience. Bringing us to imagine about star wars only by seeing lights shows :D really love it. Me and my wife enjoy it so much!
,,It's amazing,5.0,,Go in the evening and enjoy the lights and the gardens spectacular and romantic and may be a bit busy.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Never seen anything like this before. Brilliant idea and brilliant architecture, it's a must do on your visit to Singapore. There is no entry fee to walk around the Supertree Grove, but it costs 8 SGD to access the Skywalk"
,,A must see for any tourists in Singapore,5.0,,Go there at the end of the day to catch one of the two music shows. The music itself is not incredible but this setting of a huge jungle in the middle of such an amazing city is just breathtaking. The first show is at 745pm I believe and the other one at 845pm. No need to go there early. Just walk around and reach there five minutes early to wait for the show. Every time I have people visiting SG I take them there.
,,the best FREE view,5.0,,"Lokasinya masih sekitaran marina bay sands, view sunset nya paling juara. Spot terbaik buat foto-foto juga. The best thing about this place is FREE. Will keep come back here."
,,Free light show.,5.0,,Go to the light show at night. They do it twice a night every night. They change the music and lights throughout the year. The show is free! Its a must see!
,,The cool artificial trees,4.0,,"The iconic cool artificial trees, there are some engineering marvel behind the design. Curious? find the description somewhere under those trees."
,,evening night display,5.0,,"really enjoyed this show, great music and lights and you can eat and have a drink near by also. we did a tour that took you here, then to Marina sands then a boat along Clarke quay. was the easiest way to do all three in one night."
,,An imaginative attraction,5.0,,"We had been advised by friends to visit the Supertree Grove and we weren't disappointed. We went along the bridge in daylight and intended to go again when it was lit up, but didn't realised we needed to get tickets in advance."
,,Super !,5.0,,Located in the Gardens by the Bay this Super tree Grove is one of the major attraction. The construction of the super tree is itself a attraction. Adding to that is the Sound & light show which transforms the super tree in to a magic. Since it is free worth watching it. Do visit & check out the super tree & the sound & light show.
,,Mesmerising at night,5.0,,"This is one of my favourite areas in the Gardens by the Bay. They look great during the day but are phenomenal at night, especially during December when the grove is turned into a Christmas village. Don't miss it!"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Loved the supertrees. Can visit in the day and walk the skybridge and also at night at 7.45pm they have a light show.
,,Impressive 'trees',5.0,,"Part of the 'Gardens by the Bay', this is an impressive collection of man made 'super grove trees'. You can walk on a narrow bridge suspended high up in the air, between two of these trees, which gives great views. At night time, these trees are light up in a variety of colours. Currently at 7.45pm and 8.45pm, there is a 15 minute light show that is played out to the Star Wars theme tune. Worth a visit."
,,wow,5.0,,This place is amazing and a beautiful addition to the city. The trees are amazing to look at the the light show at night is wow. Make sure to arrive early to get a good position to see the show. Its free and highly recommended. Leaving a couple of minutes early will save you getting caught in the crowd.
,,Super Grove tree,4.0,,Nice place to walk around.Try to go evening times when lights are on.Skywalk will cost you money.But we sat below and enjoyed the lights very romantic
,,Be Wowed By The Trees,5.0,,"This was a highlight of my trip to Singapore. These trees reminded me of a scene from the movie Avatar. If you don't mind spending a few dollars then buy a ticket for the Walkway at the top of the trees. The view is amazing and you get to see a birds eye view of all the plants and tress from a different perspective.
There are two light shows daily at 7.45pm and 8.45pm and they are well worth watching and when I was there they played the theme to Star Wars during the light show. The first one I watched from the platform at the top of the stairs leading down to the trees and the second performance I watched from ground level. If you find a space on the seats, lie down and watch it. Breathtaking.
Put this one on your bucket list.
I also had dinner at the top of the tallest tree. The restaurant is called Indochine and the food was amazing. When you have finished your meal go up to the rooftop bar. The views are incredible especially at night time when I went."
,,So Cool,5.0,,These giant trees are so unique! I think it's fantastic that it's free to walk around here and the skywalk between the trees is very affordable. The Star Wars show in the evening is also cool and free! It's a must-see for any tourist to Singapore.
,,very cool,4.0,,I went to see the supertrees during the first showing. Each night has 2 showings. They are beautiful and modern. It definitely fits into Singapore.
,,Must to see in Singapore,5.0,,"I went to SuperTree Grove along with other Marina way attractions. I recommend to go to top during day time so that you can see the complete view of garden without any time restriction and in the evening watch the music and light show from the ground.,"
,,Wow,5.0,,"We started at 11 o'clock am and stayed till 10 pm was amazing they lit the super tree grove up at 8.45 to the Star Wars theme was fantastic worth the wait would recommend this experience for everyone entry is free to gardens by the bay. You only pay to go on the super walk around the super trees, the flower dome and the garden dome wow We ate at satay by the bay yum yum and the food is reasonably priced especially the satay we had chicken, mutton, and beef yummy"
,,Free music and lights show,4.0,,Quite and experience to see and hear. Great music and lights show twice every evening. Free. Impressive in size and quality
,,"Be Mesmerized by ""techie-trees"" without parallel!",5.0,,"People usually see these ""trees"" in postcards or on TV or from visitors' photos. You have to see them in person, upfront and BOLD! They are amazing! They are metal supports for hundreds of plants and flowers and minitrees. At dusk, they light up and are even more beautiful! Do not visit Singapore without a visit to Gardens by the Bay and the Domes and suoer trees!"
,,Simply stunning,5.0,,"This is totally amazing, free to wonder around, the tree top walk is very cheap if you want to do, but this part is closed if raining, the night time light show is spectacular, when I was there it was done to the Star Wars music, would go again, loved it"
,,Nice mesmerizing view,5.0,,"Even though it rained on our scheduled visit to Gardens by the Bay, we still had a good view of the mesmerizing Supertree lights at night. The view is indeed spectacular with the Marina Bay Sands in the background."
,,Good Experience,4.0,,"I was there mainly to take photos of the Star Wars-themed lightshow. It was magical and would leave you at awe. However, perhaps the only downside, the crowd can be a bit pushy and rowdy at times especially if some children are around. All it takes though is a level of being able to mentally imagine as if you were there alone. Lightshiw starts at 7:45pm and repeats at 8:45pm after which the park closes and a sea of tourists make their way back to the Marina Bay Sands hotel or the Bayfront MRT Station."
,,Absolutely stunning and marvelous art display,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove behind the Marina Bay Sands is a must see for anyone visiting Singapore. These trippy futuristic trees are a beautiful mix of architecture and natural plants. To make it even better, they have a light rhapsody with different songs with a color show by the Supertrees. It was a breathtaking experience and if you want to pay a little extra you can walk among the trees. I didn't and still had a great experience"
,,"If you come to Singapore, it's a must see.",5.0,,"Amazing experience. If you come to Singapore, it's a must see. The tree walk is awesome. The lights show is at (7:45pm and 8:45pm daily). The lights show was great, seeing it while lying at the supertree base gives a different angle. The site was really spectacular. You can attend the light show for free but if you want to see the supertree and the surroundings from the up high then you should buy the skywalk ticket."
,,Lovely features to see both day and night.,5.0,,"We visited during the day and loved you could go to the top of one of them and have a drink overlooking the bay. Unfortunately it started to rain so we had to sit indoors but as with most showers it was over quickly and we managed to appreciate the views. The only issue we had was the drinks list was very limited and all the draughts were off, bit disappointing on a hot day."
,,Super innovative,5.0,,Great creation in the middle of the city...beautiful trees and landscape gardens. Supertrees are beautiful
,,awesome,5.0,,Quite unimaginable the architecture....very educative the concept....and very daring the conception...!
,,Family Holiday,5.0,,This is really worth the visit. It is very near to Marina Bay Sands. Amazing sound and light show which lasts for 10 minutes.
,,Don't miss the light and sound show every night,5.0,,"7:45 and 8:45 on weekdays, and one more show around 9:30 on weekends.
The show varies on different occasions.
So every time is a new experience.
If you got time for queuing and patience for waiting, could also try the OCBC skyway.
Looking down from the skyway is quite breath taking."
,,Very pretty,5.0,,"went to the night light show and it was amazing, set to music the trees light up and the light display is set to the music. Very well done and not to be missed."
,,Interesting and worth a visit,5.0,,We came back on a second day to visit this Supertree grove. It was very pretty and fun to be suspended on man made trees!
,,Gardens on the Bay,5.0,,A must see - easy to stroll around (or familiarise yourself with a train ride. The different zones are fabulous and educational too so great for all ages (child garden too). I am told that it is amazing at dusk when it lights up.
,,HORRIBLE service,1.0,,"I always take friends here who are visiting. It was always lovely to get a drink and relax. This time I took a friend, the service was HORRIBLE. NO ONE came to check on us. To get a drink we had to walk to the bar to call the server over. The server and bartender just spent time talking/laughing with one another the whole night. There was a larger group to our right who constantly shouted out for the waiter, mainly because he didn't circle around to anyone. We then had to ask for someone to come back so that we could order food. The waiter proceeded to ask us what we wanted, but never even showed us a menu! It was awful! What a way for my friend to spend her last night in Singapore. I am incredibly disappointed."
,,Go At Night,5.0,,Visit this attraction at night and you can enjoy the music. Twice a night they have computer coordinated music with an excellent light show. Do not miss and it has free entry to the show.
,,Enchanting light show,5.0,,"The gardens by the bay should be on any itinerary when visiting Singapore - especially the super tree grove. Visiting between daylight and night is wonderful as you see the transformation of the trees coming to life with the lights.

The light show starts at 7.45pm for 15 minutes. Currently the theme is Star Wars and the trees play to the Star Wars soundtrack which is quite unique. My boyfriend and I sat on the grass by the food area and had a brilliant view of the supertrees and also the MBS hotel in the background. Fantastic free entertainment & it would be silly not to go when in Singapore!"
,,Awesome.,5.0,,"These gardens are great and the tree top walk ($8 per person) are a must do. Take a camera, as there is great views of almost the whole city. Loved it. And there is cafe's right next to the walk which are delicious."
,,Unlike anything you have ever seen,5.0,,Part of the Singapore Gardens by the Bay attraction are the steel and concrete Supertree Grove. It is what makes the gardens special and its free to see. Without a doubt the best botanic garden exhibit anythere.
,,Impressive by Day and Night!,5.0,,We walked around this area of Gardens by the Bay one evening and went back the following day. In the evening we enjoyed the Star Wars themed laser light show. The next day we went up on the Sky Walk. Both visits were great and each gave a totally different perspective of the same place. The views over the city are equally impressive by day or night.
,,Great view at night,5.0,,The way this has been built is a credit to the Singaporeans. The light show at night is fantastic and free. The way the parts of the Supertree Grove is absolutely amazing. A must see if you visit Singapore. John & Gail Laney
,,See singapore from a different view,5.0,,"Metal and bridge with greens ,all sounds wrong but feels and looks fantastic.the climb to the supertree grove is worth it"
,,Amazing light show,5.0,,"This was possibly my favorite part of the Gardens by the Bay. It's completely free to enter, except if you want to go to the walkway above, which I recommend. I went at night when they were all lit up and it was amazing. Then they had a Star Wars themed light show that was awesome! I'd recommend this attraction to couples, groups, people with children, or solo travelers. There were lots of tourists but it's a huge place so you never feel cramped."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,Super love the Super-tree-show. We came on evening and had a chance to watch this show. Definitely will come back and watch it again!
,,tourism,4.0,,amazing! enter into a new world of energy saving and good food at the top of one of the majestics trees
,,Majestic,5.0,,Seeing the supertrees in the distance for the first time took my breath away. Make sure you see them at night and day!
,,Watched the tree show,5.0,,"We came in the evening to watch the show, lots of dramatic classical music accompanied by co-ordinated lights. Very nice! Would go see it again. Lasts about 15 minutes, then there is a mad rush for taxis."
,,"Unique display, maybe only in Singapore.",5.0,,"It's possible that only in Singapore would you see a set of unique giant sculptures like this, yet they are more than just for display. Well worth a visit and don't miss the evening light show."
,,A must visit,5.0,,Such a beautiful place day or night. So green and lush and the trees are amazing to walk around. Very well organised with transport to certain points and evening lighting up shows.
,,Awesome - one of the 7 Wonders of The Modern World,5.0,,Not to be missed and one of the main attractions in Singapore. two light shows emanate from the tree structures every evening from 6:45pm which is stunning.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Super tree grove is so impressive. Its a free attraction- you pay $8 to go up to the walkways. A good tip is go to the top of Sky57 in the marina bay sands hotel opposite where you get a great free overview of the trees and domes.
,,Best at sunset,5.0,,"The giant steel and concrete trees, lit up after dark, are amazing in their own right, but particularly at sunset. If you are even vaguely interested in photography then the super grove trees are a must."
,,Amazing supertrees,5.0,,"I didn't know what to expect, however these man
Made structures are breathtaking. They are covered in vegetation and seem so right in the environment. At night the light show is superb and shouldn't be missed. I bought the DVD which is great and covers the building and engineering feats to better understand this amazing achievement."
,,Amazing at night!!!!,5.0,,"Open till 2 am. check time last mrt train, i think around 11;50 pm.This project is absolutely worth to see in the evening."
,,Gloom at Night,4.0,,This place come alive at night. Very well maintained. Make sure to reach on time other wise it will be closed.
,,A Reaol Must See,5.0,,This is a fantastic sight. To see the range of diverse plants growing on the supertrees is really something. Do not miss the evening light show. It is a real must see.
,,Super-Tree Grove Makes You Marvel,5.0,,"This man made Super Tree Grove makes you admire the visionary who turned a small fishing town only a couple of decades ago into a complete success story. Not only have the super trees eliminated need of having power-generating building structures (eyesores if you like), but also provided something pleasing to look at. The multi purpose super trees indeed are power generating structures which provide electricity to the area in addition to recycling leaves/grass/tree-waste into manure. Marvelous indeed!"
,,An iconic and free attraction in central singapore,5.0,,"The Supertree groves are one of the three ‘big’ attractions in Singapores iconic ‘gardens by the bay’. These manmade ‘trees’ exist in 3 small groves and stand between 25 and 50m tall. Each ‘tree’ is draped in vertical gardens and lights. They are accessible as part of the free ‘gardens by the bay’ which is open from 0900 to 0200 daily. You can pay 8 dollars and walk along a walkway that runs above ground under the trees. Each night at 0745 and 2045 there is a light show known as the ‘garden rhapsody’ for free. They are quite iconic and worth viewing if you are in the Singapore area, particularly because they are free of charge."
,,A must visit,5.0,,"This is not to be missed when you visit Gardens by the Bay. The Supertree Grove evokes realms of the sense - at least for me - particularly during the light show at 6.45 and 8.45pm. The current Star War theme is rather dramatic and I must say, whoever choreographed it must be given a pat on the back. I enjoyed it thoroughly and staying for the full duration. I actually took a video of the entire 'performance'. A definite pride and joy of Singapore.
A not-to-be-missed experience (evening) for anyone - locals and tourists."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Excellent place to be with kids and family. A romantic spot and a thrilling experience for those who are scared of heights. Worth visiting atleast once when in Singapore. The lights at 7:30 pm are mesmerizing and entertaining. Crowded during the Public holidays and weekends.
,,Great walk through,5.0,,Really enjoyed getting to see a local concert while walking through in the evening. Quite hot during the day but better in the evening or early morning.
,,Unique,5.0,,Great view of Singapore accessable via Marina bay Sands.great for families free water games for kids of all ages ...also very nice dry park area.
,,Cool views and artistic design,4.0,,A fun little side adventure to enjoy on the way to or from the Gardens on the Bay. Cool picture opportunities and a breeze too.
,,A crazy idea but it looks great!,5.0,,We visited in the afternoon and enjoyed walking around the grove (but it was incredibly humid) - and took the lift up to the walkway high up between some of the 'trees'. At dusk the 'trees' begin to be illuminated which is quite atmospheric but then there is a sort of son et lumiere for about half an hour which was very effective.
,,"Super gimmicky, but go with an open mind",3.0,,"Don't go here if you love trees the way they are, go if you feel you can find value in observing the way birds and animals use these trees. Nice, but no real tree :("
,,Trees made with metal.,5.0,,This is something different with trees. You can pay to go a on a walkway that connects some of the trees.
,,Nice light show,4.0,,"Walked round here early one evening whilst in Singapore with my girlfriend. Fairly interesting walk within a nice setting. At about 8 o'clock or sometime like that, a light show started, which was pretty cool."
,,Great Trees,5.0,,"These great trees are not only aesthetically pleasing, but they help generate clean green energy and have adapted well with the surrounding wildlife as well!"
,,Wow ...these are amazing,5.0,,Definately worth visiting the Supertree Grove. An amazing place to wander round and take in the giant tree structures
,,Parks of the future..!!,4.0,,Nice place to visit man made marvels. A great combination of future concepts combined with nature. Kids enjoyed the lights and music in the evening.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Amazing experience for free, go at night and watch the light shows. Take plenty of time to wander and see it all."
,,Great Light Show,5.0,,"The light show is not to be missed, easy to get to and free entry. Go back in daytime to check the rest of the gardens out"
,,The Night Show is a Must,5.0,,The light show at night is a spectacular vision. The lights and lasers syncrocised to music are a must see at this great venue. We found it better to lay down on the grass and look up at the show as you got to see more of the show. The colours were mesmerising and the music topped of a great show. Would recommend this to anyone and should be a must see attraction. Catch the other Gardens by the Sea venues at the same time.
,,Go at night for the mesmerizing lights,5.0,,"The entire Gardens by the Bay is an amazing place to visit while in Singapore, but the supertree groves is definitely the main attraction. I suggest visiting the gardens in the afternoon and then strolling to the groves by night to see the lights."
,,These structures are an awesome piece of modern art,5.0,,The closer you get the more you realise how magestic these trees are. I can't wait to come back & see them fully developed.
,,Supertree Grove,5.0,,What an amazing light and sound show around the supertree near Gardens by the Bay. Perfect place for some memorable pics.
,,Great Views,4.0,,The sky walk around the Supertrees was a real experience. It offered some amazing views and a chance to come up and away from the hustle and bustle below. It was a timed experience but no one was overly strict with ushering you down at the quieter times. I would recommend the walk. Some great picture opportunities for your Instagram as well.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Not sure what to say other than don't miss it, go on a week night if possible and be prepared to be stunned"
,,Go see the light and music show!,5.0,,Relaxing in the warm evening air and enjoying the music and moving lights is a wonderful way to complete a day in pulsating Singapore. Good for kids as well. But be prepared for crowd: it is quite pouplar.
,,Underwhelming,3.0,,"Being the signature picture in all Garden By the Bay promotions, one goes with high expectations. what one ends up seeing are giant artificial ""trees"" that may very well be skeletons of community overhead water tanks. Frankly, they are ugliest things in Garden By the BAy"
,,Great way to relax after walking around all day.,5.0,,"My friend and I went sightseeing all day, this was our last stop. Totally forgot about the light show, but we were there on time to see the 7:45 show. Recommend sitting on the field in front of the restaurants. Great view of all the trees, with less of a crowd."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Worth visiting the night lights are so amazing. Downside is trying to get transport after the show of lights , better to walk away from main entrance to catch a taxi."
,,Surprising,5.0,,"Sometimes human beings can do really magical things. And this is one of them. Walked around the supertrees and the gardens which surround them - absolutely outstanding. Gardens beautifully kept and there are gorgeous lizards popping out here and there to amuse, along with some very weirdly interesting sculptures and works of art.

Well worth a stroll, accessible for wheelchairs for most of it. Don't forget your camera!"
,,Skywalk and Restaurant in the Tallest Tree,5.0,,Supertree Grove basically has two sections. The skywalk connecting some of the man made trees; and a restaurant contained in the tallest of these trees. This restaurant is 50 meters up and there is an outer rim that one can walk around. The views from the restaurant tree is just simply superb!
,,Was here for #MayThe4th,4.0,,Gardens by the Bay partnered with the official Star Wars team to bring a fantastic light show at the Super Tree Grove!
,,Great view with pushy staff,4.0,,"I'll preface this review by saying that we ended up going to the super tree grove without knowing that the start wars festival was going on (May 4-6) so that may have affected it. With that being said, with tickets at $8 each, going up to see the view on the OCBC skyway was definitely worth it as we got a 360 degree view if the gardens from above. The issue is that the staff would rush you along the walkway to make room for the next batch of visitors (and the walkway is quite narrow in most parts) so you don't really get a chance to enjoy it all (desire signs claiming 15 minutes per guest)"
,,Supervisit to Supertree Grove,5.0,,We went there recently as part of our Gardens by the Bay visit. What an amazing piece of design and architecture. It was later in the day and after sunset the trees come to life in a vivid array of colour and dance. The light show is choreographed to some Star Wars themes and was an absolute knockout. Do the indoor Cloud Forest and Flower Dome and finish it off with this terrific display. You will not be disappointed
,,Amazing,5.0,,This is my second times in Singapore but fist time to visit this place. Very amazing and everyone should not miss this place. We'll go back again soon.
,,Impressive supertrees,5.0,,"In the night, music and light show. Huge trees get lots of shining lights playing lots of effects...and the music is creating a special atmosphere. One of the most photographes places in Singapore's nights"
,,very small,3.0,,"this is very small area in the garden. the view from top is nothing special. famous location for some movies, but you can skip this. this is or ppl with spare time and money."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"It was surreal experience, the manmade trees now home to tons of varieties of birds and insects. The lighting at night with choreographed music to match is a sight. The lights change colors and though we didn't go up the walkway, Im sure the view from the winding walkway up the trees would be awesome. The queues are winding and long and can be tiresome for very young children and senior citizens. But we did see some very enthusiastic young at heart seniors waiting patiently. The whole atmosphere was electric and you can easily spend 2-3 hours there. A must see."
,,Super Tree Super Show Love it,5.0,,LOVE IT !... This is beautiful and amazing design. There is a light show at night. Come chill and enjoy. Never get tired of this.
,,Very Touristy but for a good reason,5.0,,This park is crowded almost 9am-9pm when the park is open. Probably best to go early in the morning if you want to beat the crowds but worth coming back around 8pm for the night show when the tress light up. The last show is at 8:45pm and again it will be crowded at these times so make sure to come early to get a nice viewing spot.
,,Great at night,5.0,,Going to Gardens by the Bay and watching the light show at night is a highlight of a visit to Singapore. I have seen it many times before but I still going.
,,Nothing quite like it - go at night and see the light show,5.0,,"This attraction was one of the main reasons we went to Singapore - the Supertree Grove is an incredible sight and I would recommend this as the top attraction you must visit in Singapore.

Go at night time but lit up pictures of the trees and to see the free light show, where the LEDs in the trees change colours and are choreographed to musical soundtracks."
,,Very striking.,5.0,,"Probably the most well-known part of the Gardens by the Bay, Supertree Grove does not disappoint. The artificial trees which now form a habitat for several species of wildlife are very impressive and certainly draw your eye to them.
The suspended walkway between two of the trees was shorter than I imagined but a fantastic experience nonetheless, offering great views of the gardens. It can be reached by stairs or lift and is completely accessible to wheelchair users. It is worth noting that you can feel the walkway moving slightly. There is a charge to access it and a maximum visiting time length."
,,BIG disappointment,3.0,,"Can be seen from afar - the best view - to access the sky walk you have to go up one tree and down another. We just wanted to go up then down (to see the view) - NOT allowed! If you suffer from vertigo, this is not the trip for you."
,,Disappointed,3.0,,Ok so yes they are very impressive and the way they represent the future is great but... no birds really live there and I suspect it is to do with the light show. I just thought it would be more environmentally friendly and would have more nature but the trees themselves are beautiful so still go and see
,,Hight light of the gardens! A MUST!,5.0,,Such beautiful park and loved the supertree grove. A must see in both day light and night time. Also the walkway is a must. So beautiful!
,,A magical experience!!,5.0,,"It's like the trees come to life during the evening light show. It's so beautiful, you can actually sit under them and it's mesmerizing"
,,Spectacular Free light show,5.0,,The Supertree Grove is must visit when visiting Singapore and the evening light show to music is spectacular. Supertree grove can be easily accessed from Bayfront subway stop which is located beneath the marina sands building.
,,Amazing,5.0,,To see these trees in natural surrounds is hard to explain but somehow they stand so upright overlooking the gardens again must be seen in their enviroment
,,Amazing,4.0,,"A must see in Singapore, these are amazing structures, just wish I could have seen them lit up at night."
,,Light show,5.0,,"Every evening they have a light show with music, this is free and last about 30 minutes really worth watching."
,,Free to visit,3.0,,It is best to visit the area by night. Make sure that you are on the area before the schedule musical. Place is become crowded during this time. Stampede on the stair is possible. Hope a guard will monitor the movement of people.
,,Must see,5.0,,Looking at the crowd I think this is one of the most visited places in Singapore. I suggest to visit this attraction after sunset (according to show schedule) in order to better enjoy the light show.
,,Great coew,4.0,,"Nice to spend a few minutes looking at, recommend you go through the marina bay hotel which gives a great view of Singapore harbour from the top deck for free!"
,,Definitely visit during the day and evening,5.0,,"Magic place, very busy during the day, absolutely gorgeous at night. Lots to see and kids play areas, spots to have picnics - a must on your list for a visit to Singapore ."
,,Visual Entertainment,5.0,,what a wonderful suprise when walking around the waterfront in the evening to be entertained with a light and music show
,,Grate views of the entire Gardens from abob.,5.0,,"The sensation of being in top of the trees , and the views are incredible , a must , when you visit ""The gardens by the bay. If you can get down by the stairs when you finish in lieu of using the elevator , this way you can see how the plants are growing on the side of the tall Supertrees . INCREDIBLE ,"
,,Spectacular sight,5.0,,"For me this was the best bit of the Gardens by the Bay, very impressive, cost $8 to walk on the skyway, worth it"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Amazing lightshow at 7:45pm - get there for 7.15pm and sit under the trees. Briliantly done Singapore!
,,Great,5.0,,Man created wonderful attraction for all nature lovers . Must see attraction in the Lights.Don't miss
,,Amazing structures,5.0,,If you are going to be in Singapore don't miss this. Just amazing and also makes great photos ;-) Really worth a look!
,,Its nice,5.0,,"I went up the Supertree Grove with my family. Its not too high nor too low. The walking path is a little small though, so if ppl stop and taking photo, everyone would stuck there. Not bad experience!"
,,Evening Highlight,5.0,,"They have evening light show around 7:45PM everyday which is the highlight of this supertree. Its a very cool light show with music. We have a daughter and she absolutely loved it.
You can go on the walk on the grove as well but if you are scared of the height then it is recommended not to. Its a very nice view from there.

Definitely worth the visit."
,,Must Visit in Singapore,4.0,,This is an artificially created tree like structure that lights up with musical & light show at night - there are 2 time slots for this. Grab a seat well before the crowd starts pouring in. Its worth a watch.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,This is a beautiful area to visit & well worth it the metal trees are beautiful I have seen them both at daytime & night time
,,Glowing trees,4.0,,Beautiful glowing trees would recommend visiting at night time Very romantic place to have a walk It's also not busy so busy during night time. Must go!
,,Excellent by day but amazing by night,5.0,,Enjoyed this display and we visited both day and night. We really enjoyed the day visit but the night visit was amazing. A must see especially at night. Checkout the time the lighting show starts as this is a bonus.
,,Stunning skyline,4.0,,"The super tree grove certainly stands out above the skyline of the botanical gardens. They are a great concept and help you to get your bearings when slightly lost wandering through the gardens! We did they sky trek walk which again gave you a totally different perspective of the botanical gardens. Wish we had a chance to view them at night, but you get a better view of the bay during the day."
,,Truly Amazing,5.0,,The Supertree Grove would be most interesting by day but really needs to be seen by night to get the full impact of what has been created with incredible imagination and technical genius. Join a tour group to see this and other areas of the Singapore foreshore. You won't be disappointed.
,,Amazing views from the walkway,5.0,,"One of the things that will have me returning to Singapore is the gardens by the bay and the supertree grove. It is worth paying for access to to the suspended walkway between two of the larger structures - make sure you walk down via the outside stairs to see how the ""trees"" are constructed. Just be aware, if you are not good on heights, you may not like the walkway - it moves! However, it is worth it for the views."

,,One of the cooler things to see in Singapore,5.0,,"Supertree Grove is one of the cooler things to see in Singapore. The sheer size of these structures is awe worthy & fascinating. I enjoyed this attraction more than the cloud & flowers gardens, simply because it is so unique."
,,Magic,4.0,,The magic of Singapore keeps coming. So many things to see and do in the Marina Bay area. Great to walk underneath these structures and also see them from above. Combine with a visit to the Cloud forest and flower dome and a walk around the Bay.

Then to see what the Landscape Architects did with the plants are mind blowing. To top it all of the Lighting Technicians and there truely incredible fantastic display at night set to music, this is a must see to put on anyone's bucket list."
,,Just beautiful but take a brolley (umbrella) sun or rail,5.0,,"This has to be one of the must visit spots in Singapore, free entry to main gardens. Advise you to purchase tickets for the two domes at same time as a shuttle ticket to get to the main areas"
,,"Spectacular, what a great idea...",5.0,,Looks like a set from Avatar. The sky walk is great and gives you some great views. Worth hanging around until the night for the lights. Awesome. Great half day out.

,,Incredible,5.0,,"Don't miss the FREE night show, with music and lights...it is spectacular and you will regret missing it if you do!"
,,Wonderful night show,5.0,,Visited Supertree Grove in the evening and experienced the musical extravaganza. The setting was beautiful and people were lying on the ground looking up ... which was probably the best way to view the display. The bridge that runs through the garden closed early ... 8pm was their last visitor intake. All in all alot to see walking around in the day and night. A lovely experience.
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Supertree grove is beautiful and it is actually huge. It's a great place to take a walk in the city, during the day or at night."
,,Supertree grove Singapore,5.0,,Only $8 to go up in the lift and do the walk around the super trees. A lovely view up there of the whole of the Gardens by the Bay area and the surrounding area. I was very unsure as I don't usually 'do heights' but felt very safe and thoroughly enjoyed it.
,,Fantastic free space in Singapore,5.0,,"Great space to enjoy by day or night, really love the evening light and music show, just another free thing that make Singapore a great place to visit"
,,"Futuristic, Spectacular, Beautiful.",5.0,,"Words cannot begin to describe how awe inspiring and beautiful these ""trees"" were. Must be seen by day and night. Could have looked for hours and hours. Photos just cannot capture the magic of this place. Should be a ""Bucket List"" destination for everyone."
,,Loved it,5.0,,I really enjoyed the super trees - the whole gardens by the bay actually. The sky walk is good and very good price at 8 dollars per person. Go round first thing in the morning as it quiet and lovely to taken it all in.

,,Supertree Grove,5.0,,I could stay here all night just watching the trees and walking through the park. It was an amazing experience and the view was just as good.
,,Nice view,4.0,,"Noce view in the night u can see the marina bay view, but the service of the staff quitely bad, we must go in hurry, like we can not wait too long in the bridge, the staff always said afte take photos move, make me not comfort to take the picture"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Don't attempt this if scared of heights. If not views amazing. Make sure camera well charged. Queuing time can be quite long. Make sure you have water
,,Night attraction,5.0,,Lovely place. Hugs towers full of plants n flower n lights. The view itself is so satisfying. Visit this along with cloud forest & flower dome in garden by the Bay post sunset
,,Very Pretty,4.0,,"This is a great place to visit both during the day and at night.

The only downside is it can get very crowded at night with the light shows and people get pushy when there is heaps of different viewing areas .

The light shows are great but only last 15 minutes, you could spend a lot of time watching as it is mesmerizing.

If you are going to use the MRT to get there put a return trip on your ticket as the queue for MRT ticket machines are very long after the show."
,,Great walk through the super tree.,5.0,,It was a memorable walk with the family on the top of the grove. Nice surrounding city view from the grove walkway. Superb lighting and awesome colorful orchid flower.
,,Free light show,4.0,,"Excellent light shows at 7:45pm and 8:45pm! I went two nights in a row, and they were the same show. But it was still cool to see it twice."
,,Simply amazing,5.0,,This show that happens twice a night at 7;45 and 8:45pm just blew us away. The changing lights and music show runs for 13 minutes and is great viewed laying down under the trees or from the sky park on the top of Marina Bay Sands.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Gardens By the Bay is my favourite destination in all of Singapore and within it the Supertree Grove is in my opinion the most outstanding. We visit here every time we come to Singapore and have been up on the skywalk both in the morning and when the light show of an evening is on. We have also just spent time walking around them as they are quite breathtaking to be under. It is like being in another world. I can't recommend a visit there enough. Visiting at night when the light show is on is by far the most spectacular.
,,"Dinosaurs - bad, trees - good",5.0,,"If you are afraid of the heights, really don't go up to the path.

Do go see the light and music show that happens twice during the night (they don't really advertise this on the spot much). It is really magical. A good place to see that would be from under the big trees or on a platform on the Skypark's side."
,,Very Neat,5.0,,"very neat and peaceful place , you have to be there early because admission to the gardens is closed after 6 something and they have a light show around 7 to watch"
,,The high ligh of my trip,5.0,,"This was the most amazing show, and even though it went for only about 15 min it was well worth it plus it was free, just make sure you get there a little bit early to get a good spot there are 2 shows one at 7.45 and at 8.45."
,,The vertical gardens are OK to visit,3.0,,The real reason one sees this place is because it is on the way to the Domes. The vertical gardens and the ecosystem created are nice but they are by far not the attraction one is paying for. No need to pay for the OCBC walkway.
,,Cool view of the garden,5.0,,Amazing place to see man made super trees. It is worth while to pay extra to go on the walkway. Great experience.
,,artistic garden to visit !!,4.0,,one of the relaxing places for walking across bayfront area !!! do visit at evening time to view the splendid lights across the whole grove !!! you can walk on the elevated skywalk for free across the whole connected supertree grove
,,Restaurant,3.0,,"Great view. Food is not worth of price charged, definetely. Hous wine is expensive and mediocre. Do not recommend"
,,Favourite activity in Singapore,5.0,,"Loved going to visit the supertrees. We actually went early evening, so we had the opportunity to marvel at them during daylight as well as seeing them lit up and performing the evening light show. Excellent, beautiful, fantastic creations.
We had planned to do the Skywalk while we were there but it was closed due to incoming weather (that didn't materialise until much later that night) and also had planned dinner at Indochine in the central ""tree"", but agreed the light show was probably much better from the ground.
Visiting is a must!"
,,"Worth a trip up when at the Gardens by the Bay, limited to 15mins but more than enough time.",4.0,,"We visited here when at the gardens and is a fairly cheap addition when you get the gardens for free. The views offered are good and if you can dodge around the professional 'models' and selfie takers you can get various different vantage points of the city and the park.

Would not just plan to do this as would add it on to the visit to the gardens and the domes if they are on your agenda, we never had the time but doing it all together would be a good half day to full day trip."
,,Great Show,4.0,,"We visited the Supertree Grove to see the light show, which starts at sunset. What a great idea and fascinating display."
,,human-made botanical architecture,4.0,,"It's a nice place to walk around, especially in the evening, when the lights are switched on and everythings is shiny."
,,FASCINATING USE OF A LIMITED SPACE!,5.0,,Visited when just built a couple of years ago. Matured plants now like sculptures. Can visit up above and look down and cross the connecting walkways but felt a bit wobbly to me as I'm not keen on heights. Worth a visit though!
,,Impressive enginnering art,4.0,,THe set of trees are an admirable project and especially during the day a nice place to go for some interesting shots and views!

,,Garden rhapsody was truly awesome,5.0,,Garden rhapsody was awesome. We enjoyed the show at 7.45PM and then took OCBC Skywalk too. Truly marvelous creation.
,,Super Trees,5.0,,"First saw these on TV, but now 12 months later looking spectacular, would love to come back in 2 years time, I'm sure they would look much more so."
,,Super attraction,4.0,,"Must see - a great way to display and preserve fauna in the middle of Singapore. Cleverly designed, these 'trees' have a dual purpose allowing plants to reach up to the sky while also covering ventilation ducts from other attractions in the gardens - very smart and environmentally friendly."
,,Out of this World,5.0,,"An outstanding attraction in Gardens by The Bay especially at night when one can experience the nightly light show. This attraction is highly unusual and very intriguing. The 'trees' themselves are man made but the plants are surrounding and growing up the framework are real, well worth a visit, one of the trees has a restaurant on the top. Entrance to the Grove is free. There is a MRT station at Bayfront and is well signposted from there and a fairly easy walk although there are some stairs."
,,Don't miss the light show!,4.0,,"The super trees get lit in the evening, and it's amazing to be there. The lighting continues for a while, and we could also see it from the Flyer. Great view of the gardens from the flyer top!"
,,Something you must do while in Singapore,5.0,,Something very special is to walk through the trees while the music and coloured lights are playing. Very spectacular.
,,Visit this at night for a superb show !,5.0,,"I first visited the Gardens just after it was first finished, and they were still adding plants all the way up the ""trees' I still enjoyed it this time round, but go at night for a magical light show."
,,Nice place,4.0,,Creative building inspired by the beautiful nature! There will be light performance on weekend's evenings.
,,Nice Attraction to Relax,5.0,,This is great attraction considering it's free. it's nice place to lay on the ground after full day walking around the city One thing to note is you need good spot to catch whole attraction because only 3 big tree that has bulb lamps
,,Interesting,5.0,,It's an interesting concept of using solar energy to display their light works at night. There are two free light shows provided and it's really pretty. There is also a restaurant- Indochine on one of the Supertree.
,,Very Avatar movie like,4.0,,Went to Supertree grove for the symphonies at night. It's for kids but i went anyway as i love lights and musics. The theme was more for kids but i enjoyed it :)
,,A must see,5.0,,"This is definitely a must see attraction. These trees are very impressive and beautiful. The idea behind them it to create huge 'fake' trees which look real. The trees have metal structures but are covered in smaller plants and moss to cover it. One day they hope all the plants will grow and make the trees look real. All the trees are watered with sustained rain water, which is very cool when you read about it.
In the day the trees are so lovely and the views are spectacular of the gardens and the marina bay sands hotel.
At night the trees are even more beautiful with lights shining through. I recommend you go very late, the area closes at 12 o'clock, we went for 11:30 and it was empty and we will got plenty of time to take photos and enjoy the views.

Worth a visit 100%."
,,amazing views and great lightshow every night,4.0,,always good to come to and enjoy the transition into night as the grove lights up and the laser show starts with music. Its a must see location for any visit to Singapore and you will always see people at the weekend hanging out and picnicking in the grounds
,,Must go up!,5.0,,"If you visit the Supertrees, go up and walk across the bridge. Dizzying heights and nice views. Not cheap, considering how short the walk around is."
,,Unique Experience,4.0,,"The Supertree Grove is the third highlight of Gardens by the Bay after the cloud and forest dome. It has a skywalk as well which can be used and one of them has a hotel inside where you can go and view albeit you need to pay 10 singapore dollars (they will give you a complimentary drink in return though).
What I would suggest is avoid that and go to the supertree grove skywalk especially in the night for the light and sound show which is at no charge and spend 30 mins there."
,,Very special light and music show at night,3.0,,"The best time to visit is the evening before 7 pm when the show starting. The music was mostly Asian, the lights are very nice and creative. The best spot is on the top of the central tree where is the bar as well. Most people are waiting there so be there in time. The place is full of people and bit busy. There are many restaurants around, mostly fast-foods."
,,Refreshing Music with Supertree Light Show.,5.0,,"Super Tree Grove is an part of Garden By The Bay and famous for its Light and sound show which is performed twice per evening 7:45 and 8:45.

Its an amazing Show with beautiful combination of lights and sound on giant structures of supertrees

As the show timings are in evening only so if one is travelling with small kid .. please take care don't drain much of your energy during the day time when you are exploring main garden by the Bay otherwise during the show kids may tend to sleep and one can't enjoy the beauty of show."
,,Be There at 7.45.,5.0,,Looking good by day but amazing by night.....don't miss the choreographed light show at 7.45 and an hour later as well. This has to be the top sight in Singapore. Best view is from within the grove looking straight up.
,,Great sound and light show at night,4.0,,This was a very interesting attraction on the way to Satay by the Bay. Sound and light show is great for kids.
,,Great views and experience,4.0,,Its a great place to see Marina Bay and the gardens as well as the Sinagpore skyline. The walkway is quite short but there are fabulous photos to be taken along the entire length.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Great place to visit, very interesting to learn what they are doing with these supertrees. Looks lovely at night too."
,,better at night,5.0,,the supertree grove is better viewed at night when the supertrees are lit up. in addition the lakes have artwork which also illuminates at night.
,,Evening visit to see lightshow,5.0,,"The lightshow is brilliant, we often visit this time as it can be cooler and the show is spectacular. The show is free of charge and good for all ages. They change the lightshow every so often too so repeat visits not a problem. Nice walk to eateries in MBS or Satay in the Bay also."
,,Beautiful Evening,5.0,,"This would be a good venue for evening by enjoying the lighting and music, this area is entrance free and great pictures point of the night of Singapore."
,,A MUST place to visit!,5.0,,"Amazing light show every night at 19.30, child and wheelchair friendly. Everyone should visit this especially after sun set."
,,You must be in special time there and free for enjoy,5.0,,"We travelled to Singapore for leisure with my wife and my 13 years old son.
We arrived to that place in 7:20 PM and after 10 minutes in 7:30 PM suddenly a special light and music show was started.
That was great Amazing and so beautiful.
They played different musics and according to that light of spettrees was changed harmonic.
Before sunset it is impossible.
I
strongly recommend for planning to be at super tree areas after sunset. That show is starting every day in 7:30 PM and that will play again in 8:30 pm for visiting that not need to buy any ticket. You can see that in bottom of super trees area in public park.
That park have access with MRT subway train bayfront station."
,,Best highlight of my trip to Singapre,5.0,,Loved loved loved this place by night. It is just spectacular and I found I could not stop taking photos and looking in wonder at how beautiful this area is. It is perfectly safe (day or night) and the walk to the top just amazing. Try the roof top bar and restaurant too. Great place to stop and rest and take it all in.
,,fabulous,5.0,,"These are lit up each night and are beautiful, also free to walk around the gardens there, check in out."
,,Beautiful at night,5.0,,"Skytree Grove gives shade during daytime and comes alive at night when they are lit up. These 25 and 50 metre tall vertical gardens are illuminated by different colorful lights which change every 5 minute or so. There is a skyway or aerial walking connecting some of the trees and one can stroll to see a panoramic view of the skytree grove.
must see and it is free"
,,A magical moment,4.0,,"Be there at 7.45pm, find a place to watch the sounds and lights show, just magical.
The colored lights dances with musics everybody knows.
Pure enjoyment.
Be aware, after the show if you're n a hurry and need to rapidly get a taxi, the line might be huge. Think of it and try walking back to the center. Might take you 20-25 minutes, still less than the waiting for a taxi."
,,Gorgeous light show,5.0,,"Beautiful at night! We saw a light show, but don't know if that was a permanent feature. Awesome! Can walk bridge for a small additional amount."
,,Indescribable great!!,5.0,,It's very seldom that I use 5 points but for this it's a must. It's a unforgettable moment to see the show 7:45 pm. The light & sound performance is perfect like everything around here. All is perfect arranged and maintained. The ideas are brilliant and if you are in Singapore don't miss that. Otherwise you have to come back to enjoy this unique experience.
,,Fantastic Light Show,5.0,,"This thing is beyond words. It's bigger than what I thought. We also watched the light show at 7.45pm. Get a good spot at the grass and lay down there and enjoy. Since it's just located in front of the restaurants, we also took our dinner and enjoy the view. Awesome!"
,,Amazing skywalk and light show in the evening,5.0,,"I was enthralled with the light show spectacle at 7 pm..lots of people sit near the bridge and take photos and videos of this amazing show! Skywalkers,100 ft or so above the ground have a truly spectacular view.."
,,Avatar in Singapore,5.0,,"Although I have reviewed this in my Gardens by the Bay review I couldn't miss another accolade to this place. It is really quite mind blowing and the ""tree top"" walkway is a great opportunity to really get a bird eye view. Singapore really doesn't do anything by halves."
,,nice in evening,3.0,,"During the day not really impressive, but light and sounds show in evening makes it a nice place to visit. And you can eat easily next to the trees."
,,Superb,5.0,,Visited after we went to the Cloud Forest as only round the corner. Wonderful views. The main feature is that the Supertrees light up and there is a 15 minute show of music. So well done and great pictures to be taken. Singapore certainly knows how to do it in style.
,,Great wow factor gardens!,5.0,,"A wonderful stroll, night or day. I had never seen so many people come out, families and couples, in this precinct. The lights at night are spectacular, A credit to Singapore!"
,,Another hit for Singapore,5.0,,"We made this viewing a part of our visit to the Gardens On The Bay, get your timing right and it finishes off a great day. The Super Tree light shows started at 18:45 and another later in the evening, only about 25 mins long,but a show to behold. The show was around the music to the light show link and it was a pleasure to just sit there and stare in awe at the way it all came together."
,,Skyway walk,5.0,,It is worth to visit this skyway and take photo with Marina Bay Sands as the background. Night visit with all the beautiful lights on and enjoy the light and music performance is a good entertainment.
,,"Not so much to do as to look at, especially when lit up at night",5.0,,"One of the iconic images of Singapore that you will see around the world. You will get great photos here, both during the daytime and make sure to come back at night.

You can watch the sunset closeby too.

Very close to a lot of the main attractions like the wheel and helix bridge which also make good viewing at night."
,,Must see place,5.0,,"Since i saw this place on TV always wanted to see it my self , well saw it and i am glad i did . next time with my children ."
,,Technology,5.0,,"The park is very beautiful and vast. In the middle of the park, in three trees was strange. Which represents the modern technology park"
,,Too hyped up- they're electric lights on artificial structures,3.0,,"Yes, it's aesthetically pleasing, but no particular wow factor. I think the rest of the gardens are better. Drinks here were rather overpriced, but it isn't impossible to find more affordable options."
,,"Very Impressive ""Metal"" Trees Up to 50 M. High",5.0,,Definitely a highlight of the Gardens by the Bay that wary from 25 to 50 m. in height with one having a rooftop bar / restaurant as well as an enclosed on on top at 50 m. Food is very good and menu has lots of variety as does the drinks list. Mostly it has breathtaking views of the surrounding city and harbor area. Costs to go up to the top though - $12 for a single non-alcoholic drink is the price to ride the elevator to the rooftop or $20 if one wants a beer or glass of wine. Without a restaurant reservation there is a rather steep cover charge minimum for the inside restaurant but not the rooftop area were one can order from the same menu al fresco. Dinner can easily run $100+ for a couple but it is very relaxing and a unique treat. A free 15-min. dazzling light shows begins at 7:45 pm and again at 8:45 which is spectacular and a highlight of the park.
,,Like Disney,4.0,,Best viewed from the bridges leading over from hotel if you want a overall perspective. I viewed it from the actual location laying on my back to get a immersive feel. Felt like Star Wars..
,,holiday,5.0,,these structures are amazing and the gardens are great theres the ship to look at from a different angle and theres loads to do lots of walking here mind.
,,attarative garden in singapore,5.0,,the best views in the afternoon cheap and easy to reach . very famous in singapore the best timing at 4 pm up to 8 pm
,,You've got to do it,5.0,,Great during the day but absolutely stunning at night - a definite visit. Rightly popular so it does get very busy so if you want to do the sky walk get there well before the time you want to go up to get your tickets. Nightly light show and music is very moving - enjoy !!!
,,must see in Singapore,5.0,,It was my favorite thing to see in Singapore. You should go at night. It is really pretty! I didn't go in tho. Still can see out side. Gardens of Bay is free. :)
,,"Impressive during daylight, a fairy tale light show in tghe evening",4.0,,"Amazing sky-high :""trees"". Visit the light-show ( 14 minutes ) at 0.830 pm and enjoy the light and music show. All for free. There is a bridge between a few trees to walk. But also from ground level a beautiful scene"
,,incredible,4.0,,"I walked through during the day, was an incredible experience. Would definitely recommend going through at night time though as they would be amazing with them lit up."
,,Walk in the sky between trees,5.0,,"Walk on the walkway between trees go up with a lift, beautiful views. Light show at night a definite must."
,,Must visit,5.0,,Excellent display of lights and music. Go a little early to get a good spot. Very popular and gets crowded.
,,Great place!,5.0,,This is must gor Singapore! After walking the marina bay y stumbled upon this spectacular scene. It's become a landmark of the city.
,,"Daytime or night time, great place to visit",5.0,,"The structures and the flora are amazing, but it really comes to life at night with a great light show."
,,Stunning to see,4.0,,This is a must see place. The gardens are wonderful and very diverse. The walk in the trees looks very exciting but a bit scary. An evening stroll is the best way to see it and wait till it gets dark....wonderful
,,Lighting at night,5.0,,Lighting at night at Gardens by the Bay especially the supertree cluster is simply spectacular and mesmerising.
,,Pretty,5.0,,Interesting how the trees are used for catching rain water. Make sure to see the musical light show at night.
,,A Super place to visit,5.0,,"Incorporated in the area of the gardens by the bay and the flower Dome the Supertrees are just a marvel on singapores buildings,To learn the beauty of the trees and how they work is extremely interesting and vital to the gardens survival, and to visit the tress at night and to sit under them and watch the light show with the music is just wonderful.it is suitable for all ages your and old and inbetween and wheelchair friendly, A MUST DO while in singapore"
,,My favourite place in Singapore,5.0,,Supertree Grove comes to life every night at 7:45pm for 15 minutes. The Light and Sound Show is amazing and FREE. I've been night after night - never get sick of seeing this. Well done Singapore.
,,Something Special,5.0,,"A really stunning place, not only is amazing what the have done being able to do the skywalk allows you not only to get great photos of it and the rest of Gardens by the Bay but also across Singapore sites as well."
,,Day trip with bestie,5.0,,The scenic view was superb. Came with bestie who is a plants and flowers lover as well as scenery view lover. Truly enjoyed the time spent there surrounded by the lovely scenery and plants.
,,good place to visit,5.0,,good place to visit in the night with small walk from MBS its good with light sow and music and grab a good view before the light show starts
,,It has to be seen to be believed,5.0,,"Great fun and an unforgettable experience for the young and old alike. The trees are impressive enough during the day, but breathtaking at night. Saw the light and sound show as part of the excellent (and new) Singapore Night Tour."
,,Don´t miss it at night,5.0,,"Just expectacular. It is something that you will not see anywhere else. The best way to visit is at night, when the trees are lit and it seems to be another planet. Then the following morning you can visit the gardens and they are beautiful, but the magic is not there."
,,Absolutely fabulous,5.0,,Don't miss this stunning experience you won't believe what they can do with electronics. Go early and get yourself a good seat otherwise you'll get a stiff neck looking up!
,,one of my fav places in singapore,5.0,,super unique and mind blowing. Pictures won't do the justice. you have to see them to see how amazing they are.
,,Such a wonderful experience,5.0,,"The super trees are impressive both day and night. The light show was wonderful, a really memorable experience."
,,Amazing.,5.0,,"Part of the Garden bay project. The walkways were closed when we visited, nevertheless a good impression can be gained by viewing these structures from the ground."
,,Aweome experience despite the crowds,5.0,,"It was quite a sight to behold with plenty of plants and a lovely layout. There was a dinosaur theme going on and it definitely resonated with kids. Best time to visit is the evening (when it doesn't rain of course). You get to enjoy a nice sunset and when it gets dark, the lights are something else completely. I'm not sure if the musical light show is a nightly affair, but on a packed Saturday night, it was awesome. We paid and queued 30 minutes for the skyway - worth it if you aren't scared of heights. Spectacular is the word."
,,Mindblowing,5.0,,Only Singapore could think of giant structures in green. Kudos for the thought and immense implementation.
,,Much less impressive in real life than any photo,2.0,,Don't go here expecting any great revelations on environmental science or any real futurist view of the world.
,,FREE paradise gardens,5.0,,This was fabulous by day and amazing by night. The walkway between the trees was best at night as the trees light up.
,,very nice,5.0,,Been last weekend with the kids to look at dinosaurs. it was well done and very nice atmosphere.. always a pleasure to go back
,,Iron tree structures.,4.0,,It's an impressive concept and really needs to be visited at night when lit up. For around SGD8 you can do the skywalk if you wish.
,,Good for tourists,4.0,,"While visiting the Gardens by the Bay, I walked through the Supertree grove. After my visit to the gardens, I watched the light show, which was good for what it was. Lots of tourists and young families would love this."
,,amazing sight,4.0,,These huge man made trees tower above the Gardens themselves and become the centre piece of the Gardens and allows you to use them as reference points in the large area. The central grouping are connected by walkways that allow you to see the entire area from a perfect vantage point.
,,Only allowed 15 Minutes,5.0,,"To keep the numbers under control, only 70 people are allowed on the walkway at a time. Even so, a fun thing to do and not expensive."
,,Allow plenty of time,5.0,,"This is a lovely place to visit and explore but make sure you allow plenty of time so you don't miss anything. If your holiday allows it, try and go during the week as the weekend is busier and queue's are longer. the park is free entry but it's 20 Singapore dollars for the domes. If you,ve flown there on holiday take your boarding pass as they give you a 20% discount when you show it. The skywalk is separate at 8 dollars but well worth it. You get 15 minutes but during the week when not so busy they let you stay up there. It's definitely well worth doing for the views and photos. You must make sure you time your visit to take in the evening light show as it really is the highlight. We got a good spot on the grass in the middle and laid back Looking up at the trees. With the music they play it's very moving but this music varies as they do the show in themes. They have two shows a night and each lasts about 30 minutes. Another good viewing spot is across the lake on the grass bank. I would take a video camera or similar, I used my GoPro. Definitely recommend this place."
,,A Marvel of Eco-friendly Parklands,5.0,,"The Supertree grove at Gardens by the Bay is a brilliant tribute to the landscape architech team at Grant Associates (from Bath in England).
I am amazed at the eco-friendly attributes of the design which are too many to write about in this short review. I recommend this whole experience to all people who want a better world."
,,Good place but not worth spending money on,3.0,,"Supertree grove is a bunch of artificial trees created using iron. They are good to see once. However, there is a skywalk between 2 supertree grove. cost is around 8 dollars. One may opt to go there but not worth it."
,,Interesting,4.0,,Great idea. Will take some time for all the plants to grow to full height. In the meantime it is still a big metal structure. The skywalk is nice just a bit too short.
,,What a sight,5.0,,"Awe inspiring man made trees with vines and creeper growing up the sides. Its difficult to describe what a magnificent view it is without going there. Anyone taking in Singapore as part of a cruise should go as its a very short ride from the cruise terminal.
As the vines grow into the branches of the 'trees' it will get even better."
,,Skywalk recommended,4.0,,"Good place to have a free wander around the gardens and just $8 to go up onto the skywalk for a photo opportunity and get a different view of gardens and marina bay. Light show being worked on when we were there, apparently being improved and was planned to be restarted in early March."
,,Modern Supertree with lights !,5.0,,"Modern Trees with walkway, lights and musical show. Enjoy few hrs of time and in evening take part in Musical lighting show."
,,Truely AMAZING,5.0,,"A must see when in Singapore, these are very space age'ish looking like something out of Avitar!! They light up at night and change colours....do not miss them, the gardens are pretty awesome too."
,,"Well worth seeing, especially the light show.",5.0,,"Visited during the day and walked on the skywalk among the artificial trees, then returned on a separate evening for the lightshow. Get there early to claim a seat on the garden walls!"
,,"This is a great place for a walk or a run, but not a major attraction",3.0,,"If you have some free time while for waiting for a cruise ship, these gardens and bay are a great place to walk or jog around. They were nice, but definitely NOT a ""must see"" location or attraction."
,,You Might Get A Crick In Your Neck,5.0,,"Just outside the Gardens By The Bay you'll find the ""Supertree Grove"", a grove of artificial, architectural, trees amidst the actual palm (and other) tree grove you'll find on your southerly approach to the garden's 2 domes. They make for awesome pictures, looking up and with the Marina Bay Sands in the background. You can enjoy the supertrees entirely for free, just walking around amongst them, or you can pay (about) $8 and take an elevator ride up one and stroll the suspended walk between them. While you could just stroll around the ground admiring the supertrees, it's worth the fee to get the canopy-top view, both looking down on the palm tree forest (a view you don't often get), and toward the Marina Bay Sands."
,,Super impressive feat of engineering,5.0,,"This was one of my favorite places to visit. Go at dusk to see the light and sound show, and walk the catwalk. It moves just enough to quicken your heart. Watch the kids, as there's no fencing or netting above the guard railing."
,,Not a bad angle.,4.0,,"No matter what way you look at it, whether it be on the floor or above, this fascinating model is absolutely breath taking."
,,Amazing - the walk up in the trees is great,5.0,,"Enjoyed the Supertree Grove, especially enjoyed the walk on the elevated path through the trees. The light show at night is also very special"
,,Awesome,5.0,,Awesome Supertree structures! Great place to take photos. Wanted to do the skywalk (OCBC Skyway) by the Supertrees but the line was too long. The free music and light show at night was a nice way to end the visit at the Gardens.
,,Best free thing to do in Singapore,4.0,,Fantastic! You definitely have to see this for yourself. The super trees are so iconic and will not let your expectations down. I didn't get the chance to go on the sky walk way as it was closed due to an approaching thunder storm but that didn't ruin the trip. The free light show of an evening is a must see for all the family. I'm in my twenties and loved it even though the show was definitely aimed at children for the kids festival. It will blow your mind!
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"For some amazing reason, all the places we are visiting on this trip are relatively uncrowded and with quick access. A true bonus in this bustling and vibrant city.
This is true of our visit to the park.
Ever since I first read of these super trees I have wanted to visit. The reality was every bit as good as the daydream. Splendid views from the walkway, delightful breeze and a close-up look at these incredible structures.
Recommend!"
,,Aerial botanic gardens,5.0,,Amazing architectonic feat and perfectly integrated in the tropical lush landscape of Singapore. You can walk from tree to tree though walkways and discover the most beautiful gardens in the sky!
,,mesmerizing show,4.0,,"We went there during our trip, had dinner in the biggest tree, and watch the second light show from a passerelle somewhere nearby. It is really impressive and big... even the panorama stand of the camera isn't big enough.
We didn't do the boardwalk, we found it quite expensive for what it is.. the view from the ground and some viewing spots around the garden and the marina are already good, and if you dine on top of the tree you can go for free on the terrace for some nice pics!"
,,Gorgeous at night,5.0,,"During the day, it can get too hot but at night the supertree light up so its really gorgeous, walking on the bridge you can see the skyline of Singapore. Best of all, there's no entrance fee to enjoy the view."
,,Just enjoy the view from the ground or hill,4.0,,The grove is very impressive and photogenic. I would save the S$8 to get to the bridge between the Supertrees and go up the hills next to the trees. Almost nobody goes there since everybody wants to go on the bridge. The view from the hills is much better - and free - and it's set up against a backdrop including the Marina Bay Sands buildings - especially atmospheric at night. Do come after dark!
,,Best seen at night,5.0,,At nighttime the whole thing lights up and there is a light and sound show lasting 15 mins. Very beautiful to see.
,,Incredible experience!,4.0,,"A very surreal and unique place. Even if you're like us and don't want to spend money to go up to the walkway it's still amazing to walk around the huge ""trees."""
,,"amazing, would be great at night",4.0,,"amazing experience amongst the trees on the aerial walkway. The park itself is also quite beautiful, great in the day, would be stunning at night. can get a bit hot, take a hat and water !!"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Absolutely unbelieveable, you shouldn't miss it. Make sure you do all of Gardens by the Bay - pay the extra for the conservatories and the OCBC skyway too. And go back and see Supertree Grove at night! It's even better!"
,,Fascinating structures,4.0,,These look fantastic day or night. The Tree Topwalk was underwhelming but the effect of the trees was brilliant
,,feels like in avatar by james cameroon!,4.0,,"that was beautifull garden with the supertree which anybody can walk across supertree to the other supertree. it wes really amazing. i was wasting a long time there. i love this building. the arsitecture, the glow, the amazing voice when its start singing. it will be memorize!!"
,,INGENIOUS,5.0,,Wonderful modern use of sun and rain. Went at night and was beautiful; would love to go again during the day
,,Beautiful at night,5.0,,"Amazing sight, especially when the nightly show is in progress. An excellent place to visit at the start or end of an evening in S'pore."
,,Mesmerising,5.0,,Amazing feat of engineering how modernity has been complimented with the great power and force of nature. Beautiful both day and night. The show at night was special too.
,,Beautiful architecture,5.0,,"Very impressive place. You must see it!
Unfortunatly you will have only 15 to 30 min. in the bridge, but it is worth doing(there is also a fee for it). We went on a weekday and there where few people on the bridge, so we stayed a bit longer. There was also a wedding and it was very interesting, beautiful and colourful :) It is also worth taking a few minutes to walk around the base of the trees. The views from the bridge in to the park are very impressive."
,,Wow!!!,5.0,,"These super trees are nothing short of amazing. You can walk along the suspended walkway between some of them, if you wish, or just wander around, wondering who thought up the idea and who put the whole idea together so well. Try and time your visit with sunset so that you can see them not only in their daytime natural state, but also in the dark, when they release all of the solar energy that have harvested during the day in a spectacular light display. Don't miss the super trees"
,,Lights in the sky,5.0,,There were huge 'trees' set up with electronic lighting and the entire system was hooked up to computers. When the light show started the change in lights was breath taking and with the music told a wonderful story.
,,A Masterpiece!,5.0,,"A beautiful sight in the evening. Ideal spot for any ages. Breathtaking structures. It becomes one of the landmarks of Singapore. When in Singapore, one should not miss this spot!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,As part of Gardens by the Bay it is worth a visit both during the day and at night to see the twice nightly light show - 7.45pm and 8.45pm
,,"Must see, the symbol of the Garden City Singapore!",5.0,,"Excellent light shows in the evenings. They keep on changing the program every once in a while, and whenever we have visitors we take them there and all of them loved it. Amazing site just below Marina Bay Sands, great pictures, easy to reach by car or public transport incl. metro. Their light and music shows start at 7:45 pm and 8:45 pmevery day and last for about 30 mins, entrance is for free, great experience! Your visit can be combined with the nearby Flower - and Cloud Forest Domes."
,,Excellent Light Show,5.0,,"Went for another look at the Supertree grove light show, the last time was 2 years ago and the growth on the trees was amazing. Everything was just so well coordinated and lovely."
,,ENVIROMNENTAL TREES OF THE FUTURE,4.0,,"The 18 trees that make up the super tree grove are functional parts of the Gardens by the bay. The artificial trees are covered with 192,000 living plants. Some of the trees are connected with a sky walk and allow access to a restaurant at the top of one. Impressive in the day they really shine at night. Recommend. Hope this helps."
,,Amazing,5.0,,worth going to see - be sure to stay for the sound and light show at 7;45 each evening. The trees look incredible once they are lit up
,,Wonderful attraction,5.0,,"This is the most beautiful sight at night. A sound and light show, a photographers dream. Don't miss it"
,,Comes alive at night,5.0,,Near to Gardens by the Bay and free to view. There are many of these manmade trees but the main cluster is in a sunken grove and it is here you must go to fully enjoy the light and music show (also free) in the evening at set times. The 12 minute show blends light and sound in an emotionally stirring performance. It is unique and beats the laser show nearby hands down. Lie down (bench seating is limited) and enjoy.
,,'the creative trees at garden by the bay,4.0,,"For me it is a creative idea that peoples have in singapore, this is you can found if you enter to Gardens By the Bay..in the middle of the road in the garden by the bay you will seeing supertree grove, the trees made it with filled small plants and looks beautifull"
,,Wait for the evening to see how it transforms the garden,5.0,,The Supertrees look impressive during the day and really come alive and transform in the dark. Must see for any tourists to Singapore area.
,,Nice views,5.0,,8 dollars well spent going to the top. Made for some great photos. Recommend this to anyone who visits the garden by the bay
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This has a real wow factor. We walked around during our visit to the Flower Dome & Cloud Forest.
The trees are brilliant works of art in themselves and to see all the vegetation growing on them is fantastic. The skywalk looked good but too high for husband to try ! We spent the day at Gardens by the Bay but it never seemed crowded."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"Awesome sight, awesome concept and the work thats gone into this amazing project is unbelievable! The results are are thing of beauty to behold! Also a reminder of the vital role of plant life for humans. Well done Singapore!"
,,Spectacle,5.0,,Fantastic light and sound show. The music played was amazing. That gives a fabulous dimension to the show. The lighting system is just out of the world.
,,Artificial but still pretty,4.0,,The Supertrees are impressive in size - really cool to see during the day and later the light show at night. Great place to take a stroll after visiting the Cloud Forest.
,,Something unlike anywhere else in the world,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is something to behold - unlike anything else in the world, these Supertrees offer up some unique and individual photo opportunities. There are light shows every night where you can sit beneath the trees and watch, you can also go up into the Supertrees and walk along the bridge suspended between the trees."
,,Great Idea,5.0,,Really funky and interesting to see. Photographs can be taken from various different spots . I did not attempt the sky walk due to a fear of heights but there were no queues had I wanted to.
,,Second Visit Even Better,5.0,,"We were here in 2013, not long after Gardens By The Bay opened. This time we were delighted to see how much has changed as the new sections grew in and the overall vegetation is much more lush. A wonderful experience. Recommend that you go early in the day to avoid the tour bus crowds. Easy access from the Bayfront MRT station."
,,nice and impressive,4.0,,wonderful impressive for singapore lovely backdrop good place to have a walk and nice art work around
,,Stroll and Enjoy,5.0,,Also known as the OCBC Skyway. This is a great place to stroll and relax. There is a admission fee of SGD 8 to gain access to the aerial walkway
,,High in the sky,5.0,,"We thoroughly enjoyed this suspended walkabout. Good views of the city, swinging walk bridge and a nice few minutes spend making selfies and city shots. a pity we couldn't grab a coffee of sorts during the walk."
,,unbelivable,5.0,,we were there for the night outdoor sound and light show. it was worth it. crowded but the place is huge.
,,feel like an insect for an hour,4.0,,"Take a walk through this area especially if you love gardens, plants and trees. If you dont mind heights, take the lift up to the elevated pathway that crosses over the gardens below. At night see the spectacular light show. One thing I am not sure about are the dinosaurs they are presently building in the gardens, a bit OTT"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,Totally stunning. Waited over two hours to see the light show and am really glad that I did. Expensive but worth it.
,,"Supertrees are OK, but probably not worth it",3.0,,"The concept is cool and the trees are quite impressive. But the view from the walkway (which you have to pay to access) really isn't that much better than many other free views around. While it is cool to be walking around up there, not sure it is worth the price."
,,Day and night,5.0,,Climb the trees and see the view during the day and not miss the night show.Technology and nature combine!
,,Lovely experience,4.0,,We walked around the supertree grove in the afternoon which was beautiful as you look over the gardens below and at the Lost World expo of dinosaurs that's currently on. I would like to return after dark to see it all lite up. The flowers growing up the trees are beautiful also. Was not too busy so wait time for access was only 5minutes. You can take the elevator or 7 flights of stairs. If going to the gardens by the bay include this in your ticket.
,,Visit Gardens at Bay,5.0,,"A fantastic day out, well thought of and very informative - would recommend to all to visit at least once if not more -"
,,Unique concrete trees,4.0,,"Supertree Grove are huge unique concrete trees so called vertical gardens. They can be found all around the Gardens, twelve at the Supertree Grove, while the remaining six are placed in clusters of threes at the Golden and Silver Gardens. Take in a different view of the Gardens by stroll along the Skyway, a 128-metre long walkway connecting two Supertrees at the Supertree Grove. It was such an elate to be on the high walkway with its breath-taking views. A must-see attraction while in Singapore, and best visited at night to enjoy the splendour of all the lights. Highly recommend this low cost attraction while visiting Singapore"
,,Unexpected,5.0,,I thought this attraction would be pretty awful. I was very wrong. The mock trees were really artistic and the vegetation cladding them mimicked wild habitats. The light show was magical
,,Wonderful night visit when light are on!,4.0,,Day time very hot. Has a small water area close by for the kids. Forest is best by night with the show at 7.45pm and 8.45pm.
,,Top-Notch Activity with Great Views,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove in the Gardens by the Bay is an interesting grouping of ""metal trees"" that are lit at night for an amazing display. For small fee, you walk walk along an elevated walkway between them and have really good views of the Marina Bay Sands Resort,t he Singapore Flyer, the Cruise Terminal, and the gardens. Even if you don't use the walkway, you SHOULD see these ""trees"" on your next visit to Singapore"
,,Gorgeous,4.0,,Whomever had the vision and Artistic talent to see this project to completion was genius. Loved the light shows at 7:45pm and 8:45pm. Take the sky walk... you will love it.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"What an amazing idea. Beautiful during the day, but at night it is spectacular. Buy a ticket and walk the OCBC Skywalk. Fantastic views over the Gardens."
,,A Top 10 Attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"a must-see attraction while in Singapore, and best visited at night to enjoy the beauty of all the lights. The Engineering behind the light show is phenomenal. Shows start at approx. 8 p.m. and last about 30 minutes."
,,Fab structures,4.0,,"Great idea, dwarfed by various plants growing. Great view from the bridge of Singapore and the gardens. Well worth it!"
,,free to watch sounf and light show,5.0,,"we took a night tour and went to this attraction, loved it. you do not need tour free to visit the outside gardens at any time."
,,Definitely worth seeing,5.0,,"The supertree's are very impressive and very well landscaped. We saw them during the day and at night and they are equally impressive either way. The light show to music is worth seeing but I wouldn't really recommend going up to do the sky walk. It's only about $8 a person but the view is nothing special, you can get the same from a number of other places that are free or that offer more of an experience to go with the view."
,,Lay under the Trees!,5.0,,You will get a very different perpective by laying on the ground at night under the trees. Absolutely beautiful and very special.
,,An Unexpected Adventure,5.0,,"Before going to Singapore's Gardens by the Sea, we were unaware of the Supertree Grove. These are huge concrete ""trees"" called ""vertical gardens"". They range in height from about 85ft to 195ft with a suspended walkway that is reached through elevators in the ""trunks"" of two of the taller trees. It was such a thrill to be on the high walkway with its wonderful views. We highly recommend this inexpensive attraction."
,,Magical,5.0,,The Supertree Grove is interesting during the day but truly Magical at night during the Light and Laser show. Absolutely a must see free attraction to visit whilst in Singapore
,,"Simply Amazing 17 huge structures, covered with plants and lights!",5.0,,"Stunning both day and night, 17 huge structures with plants and lights covering them, a sky walkway joins a few of them, extras charge to do but worth it for the views, try to do at sunset as you can only be on there for 20 minutes, watched to crowds at this time or close to it."
,,super view on the night singapore skyline,4.0,,"good palce to go but be aware, the show are at 19h30 and 20h30 only and play for 30' only. eaasy access from marina bay mrt and it is free attraction. super view on marina bay hotel at night"
,,A must see,5.0,,"Nice place to chill out at sunset, watching the lights display. Very well done. a visit is recommended."
,,Watch the light show,5.0,,This is a spectacular piece of art/architecture which is also worth seeing in the evening with the light show a must.
,,Great engineering and super architecture!,5.0,,These Supertree were amazing. They were beautiful when lite during the night. We visited during day time and had a chance to go up and cross a suspension bridge. Amazing view.
,,totally must see!,5.0,,"An iconic Singapore place that attracts tourists from all over the world. Huge human made supertrees look stunning day time, but in evening they turn to be a real miracle. An unforgettable experience. I'd suggest all the tourist to visit it."
,,Gorgeous!,5.0,,"If you're looking for a place to kill some time, get some exercise or take some gorgeous photos - look no further than the Supertree Grove. It's very beautifully landscaped and walking distance to other attractions. We took the boat tour from nearby."
,,Amazing light show,5.0,,I visited the Supertree Grove in the evening to see the light show. It was a beautiful spectacle and I look forward to watching it again if I return to Singapore.
,,Out of this world!,5.0,,"After watching a programme about these trees on the BBC we were very much looking forward to visiting.....,,we loved the experience and weren't disappointed. The tree structures are fascinating.....a fab Eco project....love it! The sky walk was great.....breathtaking really! It was good value....8$ each"
,,Nice Place for hangout,4.0,,"Our first time visited here such a nice place and beautiful view of singapore especially at night Enjoy our sunset wine and tapas, luckily the weather was good and we really had good times"
,,highlight of our trip,5.0,,"When teh trees light up, and start to dance to music, WOW its a memory for a lifetime. We sat and watched and listened and just smiled. What a magical place, never experienced anythign like it before"
,,Excellent,5.0,,Must see location in Singapore. We went around 7 pm and it was fabulous. There was a light show as well
,,Iconic and rightly so,5.0,,This place is becoming more and more of an icon of Singapore and it is obvious why. It is unique and majestic. You can see it during the day and night and it would be a different experience each time. Gardens by the bay is mostly free and this area is included in the free access which makes it even more great. It would be great to climb the skyway at night and especially during the light show.
,,Magical at night,5.0,,I didn't find Supertree Grove particularly spectacular during the day but the light & sound show at night was fabulous and definitely an experience not to be missed. The first show begins at 19:45 and there is a repeat performance at 20:45. The atmosphere and the surroundings were truly magical.
,,Steel sculptured Trees,4.0,,"Visit Gardens by the Bay and see these amazing structures, that have creepers climbing up them. One of the trees has an internal lift that allows visitors to walk across the top of a number of trees, but there is a charge."
,,Gorgeous!,4.0,,We were at the bridge between Sands and Gardens to watch the colorful Light Show. It lasted about 15 min along with some pop music/songs. Great!
,,Stunning Supertrees,5.0,,"The Supertrees are a bit Avatar and a bit futuristic, but the light show set to music was fantastic. We went at night, which I highly recommend as I don't think you would get the whole impact during the day. The orchids and greenery growing through the trees gave them another dimension in the different coloured lights. Lots of people were lying on their backs gazing up to get the whole effect. There is also a Visitor's Centre, toilets and places for snacks and drinks nearby."
,,Spectacular day or night,5.0,,"This collection of structures is mind boggling, just a testimony to Singapore's inventiveness. The plants of various textures weave in amongst each other to amazing heights. At night the colour show offset by music is a memory of wonder. That walkway amongst the supertrees is magic"
,,Interesting super tree grove,4.0,,Just a short walk from the garden by the bay. It worth a visit if never been there. Give you a little different experience.
,,Fantastic evening performance,5.0,,"Definitely visit is a must. They perform lights and music performance every evening, just lie on the groud and look to the treetops. Fantastic sight."
,,amazing,5.0,,the sky walk and light show are amazing. It is lovely to see all the air plants and orchids taking over the structure and being able to get so close to them .
,,Highlight of my trip,5.0,,This part of the many attractions in the Garden by the Bay. These are man made trees with plants growing up their vertical sides and you can stroll along the walkways for some fabulous views.At night they have a light display which rocks your socks off accompanied by music
,,Pretty but not worth a special trip,3.0,,I was a bit disappointed as there were just the occasional green lights on the trees. Very pretty but it was a trudge at the end of a long day walking.
,,Night time is best,5.0,,Fascinating by day but an amazing sight at night when lit up. See the free show to music. Make sure you have your camera!
,,Good view if you don't mind spending a couple of bucks,4.0,,"If you are on budget, skip this. Yes, it's a suspended bridge and it has nice views. Worth the money? Not really. You get 15 minutes up there. They don't rush you but that's what was posted."
,,"great at night, eyesore at day light",4.0,,"the giant iron trees don't look beautiful at daylight. they are even considered eyesore for singapore skyline for many. but the trees turn out to be attractive at night with the light and sound shows.

it is a great place for family with kids. but even with the magnificent lighting performances, once is probably enough."
,,Look up and be amazed,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is a collection of about 25 massive, man-made trees within the Gardens by the Bay. A totally free attraction, you just look up and it's such a sight to behold. To climb up the walkway and walk across the trees, there's an admission fee (which I believe is about 8 SGD), but even if you're just admiring it from the ground, it's amazing! Head there in the late afternoon, and you can catch the light show when the trees illuminate and come to life. It's everyday at 7:45 PM. Good stuff."
,,Amazing supertrees,5.0,,"Supertree Grove is a bar on top of one of the supertrees in the garden. You will enjoy the natural air at the top there, the beauty of singapore city, etc."
,,NIGHTIME IS THE BEST,4.0,,Best time to go is the nighttime when it all gets lit up. The view from the platform is good but nighttime is definitly the time to go.
,,See the gardens,5.0,,Amazing how many plants and varying structures have been accomplished in this big area. Model cases for everybody
,,Unique and very clever,5.0,,"Definitely experienced best in the cooler evening or night time hours when you can enjoy the light show and the accompanying sound tracks that are played.

Take your camera as these supertrees are part of the whole Gardens by the Bay experience. The views from the walkways are fantastic. You feel as if you are in a Science Fiction movies sometimes, but the reality of the living ferns and orchids and bougainvillea bring you back to mother earth reality once in a while.

As with many attractions I have seen in Singapore, this is truly world class, insightful, inspiring and dreamy.

Weekends are really busy so try to plan your visit wisely."
,,Must See Attraction,5.0,,Make sure yo visit the supertrees at dusk and see the music and light show. Its free and its spectacular. We have been to two different shows both were great
,,Great Light Show,5.0,,The light shows for the supertrees are on several times each evening so after a stroll through the lovely gardens it is good to sit and watch the show
,,A must see free attraction,5.0,,"The trees themselves are planted with orchids and bougainvillea and are well worth a close look, but definitely go back in the evening to watch the sound and light show. The lighting is superb and the quality of the sound track is quite surprising."
,,Amazing free attraction,5.0,,Part of Gardens by the Bay and a must see. It's free although if you want to walk up in the branches there s a small fee of about £5. Good in the day but really you must go in the evening to see one of two free daily light shows. Really spectacular.
,,Fantastic!!,5.0,,These trees are definitely super!! Never saw anything like that before. Definitely do the skywalk and take a lot of pictures!
,,Beautiful architecture planting.,5.0,,"Very impressive planting, the bridge is worth doing although you can only stay up for 15 minutes and there is a fee. We went on a weekday and there where few people on the bridge. It is also worth taking a few minutes to walk around the base of the trees. You can get some good views of the trees from other places around the park, the views from the bridge in to the park are very impressive"
,,Unusual,4.0,,This walk is very unusual and you get some good views from high up and you can get up close to the trees. There is a lift to take you up and down and quite a few rules. A little overpriced though.
,,"Amazing, even without the light show.",5.0,,"We got our times mixed up and missed the light show. We arrived just on dark, at 9.30, and it didn't matter really, as the trees were lit and looked beautiful in the night time. It was a pleasant night, with a cool breeze. so we weren't very disappointed, and it wasn't crowded! I'm sure the light show is impressive, but we still loved it just lit up."
,,Unique structures - worth seeing up close,4.0,,"We had spend quite a few hours visiting the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome so didn't spend as long at the Supertrees. However, it is definitely worth walking the pathways and getting a good look of these amazing structures from up close. There are some large ones with a walkway and the rrest are a bit smaller but by no means, insignificant. I had not realised they were built to collect rain to feed the plants in the domes etc."
,,Magnificent!,5.0,,"Very interesting area. Very well planned and built, and the plants are very quickly taking over the structures, which look wonderful. There is a board walk fairly high up that gives an interesting view of Singapore, and the rest of the gardens. The lighing of the structures at night is amazing. A must-see place!"
,,One of a Kind - Fun.,5.0,,"With limited time - we decided to just focus our visit on the Supertree Grove. You can spend an entire day at Gardens by the Bay and this is just one portion. The OCBC Skyway is more than 60' up, running through the ""trees"" and had a view worth the extra $8 fee. I the evening at 7:45 and 8:45 they put on a spectacular light/sound show (I think it's 12 minutes). You can also see the show from across the Dragonfly Lake near the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
Very cool and totally unique."
,,Best attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"Absolutely loved these trees, they are amazing. There is a tree top walk you can do for about £8. Once the sun goes down there is also a light show along with music which is amazing.

I would recommend going here about 3pm, walking around both domes and then seeing the supertree light show around 7pm. If Singapore is particularly hot then the domes are a good way to escape the heat as well.

Easily accessible via the underground trains as well."
,,Fabulous - Must walk the Skyway,5.0,,"Visiting Gardens by the Bay at the end of a long day's walking around Singapore wasn't ideal, but we felt we had to do the gardens justice and I'm so pleased we spent a couple of hours there. We didn't venture in the domes, but found the Supertree Grove and the Skyway connecting the trees the highlight of our visit.
From the ground the skyway didn't look particularly high, but once emerging out of the lift and being confronted with a sign warning that those with high blood pressure and a fear of heights should not proceed, we did have second thoughts as we suffer with both.
We really shouldn't have worried. Once on the skyway the views of the city, the straits of Singapore, the skyline and Marina Bay Sands soon took away any slight fear of looking down. Once we did eventually peer over the edge of the handrail the mass of ferns, palms and other exotic plants below made a stunning sight.
We regret not visiting in the evening to see the trees glowing and this will be high on our list when we next return to Singapore."
,,The light show is amazing,5.0,,"A must see if you are in Singapore. I recommend eating at Satay by the Bay and then walking over to the Supertree Grove for the light show. Find a place to lay back and enjoy! If you have a picnic blanket bring it along, though it is not a necessity. You want a good view of the Trees that have the walkway attached as they are the main ones for the show. Our family enjoyed this more than fireworks."
,,Something to see,3.0,,We didn't go on the upper walking area because it was paid. We had already paid to go to the top of Marina Sands. How special could it really have been? It's cool but I like real nature. They light them up at night and do a light show. It's definitely worth seeing but just to say you seen it.
,,H.G. Wells?,5.0,,They remind me of some sort of early Sci Fi. Maybe War of the Worlds or summink. They are so impressive and the overall effort that this city makes in its creative ventures is very impressive. There is an interesting diagram at the base of the tree on how the entire gardens function from an environmental point of view that is worth trying to understand. The light show is best enjoyed laying on your back at the bottom of the main tree.
,,Loved the bar at the top!,5.0,,"There's an Indochine bar/restaurant at the top of the super tree, great views from the top all around."
,,Stunning Place and Amazing Show,4.0,,Is really Stunning Place and Amazing Show twice daily and each time is so nice and Creative idea So crowded from around the world With different show each time
,,Good to get a glimpse if you are in town,4.0,,Saw this on a Bus trip. Adds to the attractions as you travel around. Keeps up you spirits as you try to figure out what attraction you have here apart from normal buildings.
,,Supertrees a okay - visit the two Domes!,3.0,,"Supertress are okay, but do not miss to go to the two domes - Garden by the Bay a nice for a walkaround, but the highlights are the domes!"
,,Incredible Giants,5.0,,Incredible technology used in the design and growth of these 12 structures and an awesome light display to top off an excellent adventure!
,,Breathtakingly beautiful,5.0,,"The giant tree sculptures are breathtaking. My jaw dropped at the initial sight of them. I took so many gorgeous pictures throughout this park. It's a little confusing trying to find it on foot from the Marina Bay Sands, but it's worth the trouble. This is a must-see attraction in this gorgeous city."
,,Awesome show at night....,4.0,,We heard that there will be a light show in evening hence we thought of waiting.... It was worth the waiting time!!! we laid back on the open ground watching the light show under the open sky.....the experience was just too amazing!!!!
,,Avatars live here,5.0,,Amazing supre technological trees . A almost alien experience during the day and at night. Walking in between those super trees on top offers the best view of Singapore
,,Like something from outer space,5.0,,"Although this is totally man-made even including the reclaimed land it is built on, it is still a beautiful natural attraction with lots of plants and flowers and even birds nesting in the towers. The skywalk is worth going on but try to go early in the day when there are fewer people because if it is crowded they move you on after 15 mins. Don't miss the sound and light show every evening."
,,disappointing,2.0,,"The Grove constructions look great from outside, but climbing is expensive for what you really get, and the views do not compare with the ones from the Marina Bay terrace or from the Wheel."
,,New Forest!,4.0,,"What they are doing here is most impressive. Very early stages, and the greenery has not fully developed, but it's a fascinating experience - especially the walkway. Apparently, the lights are amazing."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,This place is very beautiful. To be visited at night. It's magical. Must visit. Awesome view of Marina Bay Sands and Singapore flier.
,,The trees are amazing,5.0,,The trees are really amazing and worth a up close and personal visit. We missed the light show in the evening which we were sorry about.
,,amazing view and creation,5.0,,"must go place. can't imagine a human creation like that with nature. one is the view from there is amazing, second is you will be amazed by the creation of the super trees. the more you know the science behind them the more you will be surprised by the existence"
,,Awesome,5.0,,A must-see while in Singapore. Combine with a visit to the Cloud Forrest and Flower Dome. You can catch a shuttle from MBS.
,,Stunning and spectacular!,5.0,,"The super-trees, being part of the Gardens by the bay, are - by far - the most impressive thing we've seen in Singapore.
They are amazingly beautiful day and night (although the night lights give them an even more magical feel).
Make sure to take the elevator and walk on the high hanging bridge, as the experience is amazing.
Highly recommended!"
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore this place is not to be missed!
It's a highlight of Singapore & should be visited when there!
We visited a dusk & got some amazing pictures & then hung around for the light show in the evening.
A lot of people were sat on the lawned area in front of the trees to watch the light show but we found the best view to be up on the risen area in front of the trees.
The gardens are equally as stunnIng and I am sure they are just as beautiful in the day time!
From here we walked over to the marina sands hotel and visited it's amazing mall.
Must see!!!"
,,great night show,5.0,,"Visited here during our recent stay gardens were nice but the light show at night was lovely. We sat on the ground, some people were lying down as they elt this was the best way to view the show"
,,Beautiful show,5.0,,We enjoyed the beautiful light and music show at night. Unfortunately we could not try the OCBC Skyway.
,,Fabulous Rhapsody Delight at night,5.0,,"Many visit the Garden in the day but are unaware of the the spectacular night shows daily at 7.45 and 8.45 pm. Moreover, it is free.
So the SuperTrees not only light up at night but also bedazzle and glimmer to music. So lie down and enjoy the show. Absolutely delightful !"
,,superb light display,5.0,,The best time to visit this place is during night time. you can sit under the tree and enjoy the cold breeze. and you can also go up there and see the view from the top
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,"Visit after dark and enjoy the free light show at 19:45 each evening. The colours are fantastic and really bring these amazing structures to life. Make sure that you're in the correct part of the Bay Gardens though ... there are two clusters of three trees (which is not where the 10-minute light show is), and a much bigger cluster with walkways between (which is where you should be). Great views of the trees from the adjacent Marina Bay Sands observation deck too."
,,A fascinating experience,5.0,,"A marvel of engineering and design, the supertrees are an ecological marvel that has to be seen to be believed - and be sure to use the elevated walkway between the trees!"
,,awesome,5.0,,Super-tree's are amazing!! What a experience! Me and my kids enjoy a lot. You can see the Singapore form top.
,,Big tree,3.0,,They made look like a big tree as you can see from high and good view. It's only 8 dollars to go up there
,,Unique Singapore Experience-go at night.,4.0,,"This is one of the most photographed things in Singapore for good reason. it is spectacular, especially at night. Don't miss it."
,,Fabulous - must visit at night,5.0,,These super trees are stunning we went late afternoon stayed for the evening the light show was fantastic ... don't miss it.
,,Super experience,5.0,,This is quite possibly the most unique and beautiful experience in Singapore. If I was to say one must do experience whilst in Singapore the would be it. I would suggest that it be seen in daylight as well as in the evening. The evening show is simply awesome. I was taking photos during the show but in doing that you miss out on the whole experience. I suggest that you get to the Gardens in good time so that can get a good vantage point to see and hear the show. Maybe have dinner at the Marina Bay Sands opposite and make your way to the gardens across the walkway. Fantastic.
,,Cool at night,5.0,,"There is an awesome night show where the trees light up and dance to music. It's very cool, get there early though as when we went ti got pretty crowed. A lot of people ended up sitting on the ground, if that is not your thing, maybe bring a portable chair?"
,,Recent trip to Singapore,5.0,,Went along at dusk to see the supertree grove gradual come to life with an amazing light show and it was not disappointing very beautiful
,,Good view from OCBC Skywalk and amazing sound-n-light show,5.0,,"This place is part of the huge Gardens By The Bay area. A short walk from the 2 ""domes"", the Supertree Grove lights up after sunset - which is the best time to visit this place. There is a skywalk called OCBC Skywalk which one can experience for a fee and if you go there just after sunset, its worth it. One can also click photos against the backdrop of the Marina Bay Sands from here. The highlight is the amazing 15-minute sound-n-light show at 7:45 and 8:45 pm. Definitely recommended !"
,,Awesome experience.,5.0,,I was amazed at these beautiful creations and so pleased to have seen them both through the day and at night when they are so beautifully lit up. A must-see.
,,Unique and Glorious,5.0,,This was the most unexpectedly cool thing about my visit to Singapore. Who knew that these Supertrees would be so spectacular up close and personal. In daylight they were gorgeous but the true spectacle is seeing them all lit up at night. Walking around their base catching them from various angles - WOW! It made me think of the movie Avatar. One should definitely not miss this. They are in the center of the Gardens by the Bay so also great views of the Marina Bay Sands. And the park all around is beautiful.
,,Wait till Night to see the beauty of supertree,5.0,,Super Tree grove is basically a man made trees in garden by bay. Wait for till 8 pm in night when u will witnessed a musical night light show in super tree . Its really a worth watching it and something unique to watch . You will love it .
,,Unforgettable experience,5.0,,"Visit the grove during the early evening light & music show. Then you get to see the suset over this amazing piece of art. Just find a spot and ley on the deck during the performance. It is incredible. It is free, unless you want to do the skywalk."
,,Awesome scenery,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is located inside Gardens by the Bay. It looks good, and you can get better view if you enter the skyway (costs $8 though). From above you can see the Downtown Singapore and Marina Bay. Gonna be good for your social media profile LOL"
,,This is a spectacular attraction!,5.0,,It is part of Gardens by the Bay which is a nature park that is wonderful. Go up and have a drink at the top and take it spectacular views of the city and the sea.
,,Stunning Yet Again,5.0,,We only got to walk around as we did not have time to queue to walk up above on the Skywalk. The Gardens are stunning with a twist of Modernity. Free to walk around but $8.00 to go up top.
,,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome ....",5.0,,Did I say this place is Awesome! A marvel of construction and conversation. You must stay long enough to see the spectacular light and music show which is just as great viewing from the ground as it is on the treetop walk.
,,See this.,4.0,,"The fact that in a few more years the ""trees"" will be covered in foilage is hard to contemplate, but they will be. Great light show at 7.40 and 8.40pm"
,,Must visit spot In Singapore!,5.0,,"This is the perhaps Number one spot of Singapore.Please be sure you complete your all Gardens by the bay Visit at around 6.30-7.00 Pm,as It opens after this time.Please Note that there is too much crowd to visit just this attraction-often entry gets closed.Don't leave the gardens before watching the Famous Sound-Light show in evening"
,,Stunning/ Unbelievable,5.0,,"It's only takes a few minutes, but it an entirely unique experience. You also don't need to be a physical dare devil, as the elevated walk is not lengthy and there are elevators going up and down."
,,Can be seen,4.0,,"Supertree are located inside garden by the bay. it is free untill and unless you want to go inside it or have a food inside. There is sound and light show, which I did not find very interesting. You have to wait till evening for it."
,,Superb supertrees. Don't miss it,5.0,,Make sure you visit in the early evening so you can appreciate the structures before and after it gets dark. Great vision by the city of Singapore. These are amazing and once they light up at night it's terrific. Bring the camera and some bug spray. Great family activity.
,,Super Structures,5.0,,You have not seen anything like this before. You can also view them on a skywalk. Ecological wonders.
,,Beautiful view of the Singapore Skyline through the skywalk !,4.0,,The real fun of visiting this attraction is in the evening/night when the lights are lit up. The Sky walk offers an amazing view of the Singapore skyline and lots of photo ops which will be reminiscent of your Singapore trip ! The light show which is at 7:45 pm was very good with Indian film music thrown in as well :-) We managed to catch the light show at the Marina Bay sands which is walking distance from here right after this so it was an evening well spent .
,,The Supertree Grove is excellent,5.0,,So well done. The supertrees are amazing and are excellent to walk around. They are right in the middle of the gardens and provide perfect photo opportunities with Marina Bay Sands in the background. I took the plunge this time and did the skywalk. So happy I did but I couldn't look down!
,,nestled in the gardens by the bay,5.0,,"These artificial trees are climbing with new life, in the next few years they should be totally covered. you can also go up an elevator and walk along the raised walkway"
,,Very Nice Free attraction,4.0,,You dont really have to pay to see the Supertgree Grove except if you want to climb up. There are nightly light and sound shows which is very beautiful to watch.
,,Unique yet average.,3.0,,"Compared to the Cloud dome, the supertree grove in the gardens by the bay is an average attraction. A tip is to be here in the evening when they have a light and sound show."
,,From another dimension,5.0,,"You must not missed the trees inside the beautiful Gardens by the Bay.
They are great to see during daytime, especially climbing on the sky walk, that offers beautiful view around gardens but also attraction near by like the MBS building, the domes ant the Flyer.
It's great during the day, but is amazing during the night wilth all the lights, it just feels from another planet.
We visited during Christmas, which adds a bit more of extra feeling, with even more decorations and carols singing all around.
Take note access on the sky walk is not allowed if raining."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Visited just before Christmas & was very amazed by the loveliness of it all.
Unfortunately the rain came pouring down at dusk. There wasn't much shelter (an improvement to consider, given that the tropical weather) & nothing to be seen so we ran in the rain to get back to the MRT"
,,So Pretty,5.0,,I felt like I was in the movie. These Trees are very big and night time is the best time to go see them
,,See this at night,4.0,,Not in the day. The night show and the lights around the trees are much more amazing than what you see in the day. Did both. Need to pay entry fee to go to the top and this was pretty boring during the day. Also its really hot and humid right now so didn't enjoy it. The night was stunning however
,,a must do,5.0,,You can't visit Gardens by the Bay without going up the supertree grove. Stunning views. Tickets are cheap and well worth the effort to do it.
,,Technological marvel,4.0,,Trees that sleep on day and are awake in the nighttime. In the night with the lights these trees come alive and the views are really worth the visit and staying for darkness to happen from daylight.
,,Stunning,5.0,,This place is beautiful. I had not heard of it prior to seeing it on David Attenbourough's Planet Earth 2. It is well worth a visit .
,,Wow!!,5.0,,the supertree grove expreience is one which needs to be felt and enjoyed by every person who visits singapore. the lights the music ( A.R. Rehmans Chaya Chaya included) salutes the diversity of Asia in music.
,,Stunning view both day and night time!,5.0,,"This is a must visit! I know it is a tourist attraction but it has been done very well, great location, architectural structure is pretty amazing. At night time, there is light and sound show. The OCBCwalk is $8.- and it is worth it."
,,Interesting,3.0,,Interesting concept and good views. However rather pricey for a ride in an elevator. Views from Marina Bay Sands is better.
,,Fantastic light show,5.0,,Fantastic light show at night go around 5 pm and look round the gardens then stay for light show beautiful
,,Amazing views and night show,5.0,,"Six of us toured all of the Gardens by the Bay and the Supertree Grove. The entire site is awesome and the Supertrees are a unique part of it. We paid the $6.00 to go up and take the skywalk around and it is well worth it. Great views from above. We also stayed for the free evening night show and it was fantastic. Easy to get here on MRT, don't miss it. Come later in PM to see everything in daylight and then stay for light show, you'll enjoy it ..."
,,Exactly it's super tree,5.0,,I saw small bar & restaurant here. You can pay ticket with drink and sight seeing around in the top of tree because it's highest in the garden. Interesting experiment
,,Amazing,5.0,,"It is almost worth a trip to Singapore just to see the Supertrees. Up to five stories high the tree structures are covered in vegetation and have a changing light show at night.

Access is free and the gardens are accessible via public transport, taxi and pedestrian walkways.

Night is the best time to visit as you get the added benefit of the light show.

The whole concept is a tribute to town planners who developed this amazing attraction on reclaimed land.

One of the most interesting things we have seen - anywhere!

The Supertrees are close to two other indoor attractions: The Flower Dome and the Cloud Forrest."
,,Beautiful at night,4.0,,"Let me state that the trees are impressive to look at, day or night - but at night is when they are truly the most beautiful. Let me also stress that while we stayed for the light show as well, we left after about 5 minutes...it really isn't worth staying for. I recommend catching them as the sun goes down so you can see the night beauty, then skip out to avoid the crowds.

We arrived late in the day and didn't buy the tickets for the raised platform, so I can't comment on those."
,,beautiful view,4.0,,the view there is beautiful as there are so many beautiful supertrees to see but the super tree which I recommend is the tree where there is a restaurant at the top and the only way to get there is by lift
,,Stunning at night time!,5.0,,"On previous visits we had not ventured into this area at night, but after seeing the wonderful photos I was keen to take some of my own. I was not disappointed, well worth a visit and it is free!"
,,Family visit with Kids and Parents on CNY,5.0,,"This is a mesmerizing place. You have got to see it after the sun-set. The lights really are amazing. The OCBC Skywalk is a must to-do, and tickets needs to be purchased separately. ""The Mesmerising Garden Rhapsody Show "" is a must watch, is a 5-10 mins light and music show. This happens at 8:00PM local time. This time they played the Indian song "" chaaiyaan chaaiyan "" as well. We had to wait for almost an hour in line due to heavy rush because of weekend and CNY. The whole place is wheelchair/pram accessible. They take you in a lift to the top and you can stay there for some time. There is a maximum capacity of 50-70 pax on the OCBC Skyway. There parking is walking from there, and couple of stairs above this. There are some souvenir shops and eateries as well. there is a McD as well in the campus."
,,very pretty especially at night,5.0,,"One of the famous attraction in Singapore. The groves are very pretty, had seen both day and night, i prefer night. The lighting are gorgeous"
,,Amazing structures!,5.0,,"We headed off to the Supertree Grove at about 2pm - we wanted to do the treetop walk (which closed when there was bad weather).

Going to look and photograph the Supertrees is free, there is also a free light show at (I believe) 7:45 & 8:45 (but check as the times may change seasonally) which was great.

There are also two paid activities there:
• the Supertree walk (not available in bad weather) - 8$S
• the Treetop bar and dinning - 12$S for access and a soft drink / juice, 20$S for access and an alcoholic beverage (food is additional and MAY require a booking)

I personally liked the Treetop bar the best out of these two activities, but they were fairly inexpensive, so I had no problem doing both.

A warning I will give: the restaurant at the top is an IndoChina restaurant - we did have some food there and it was quite good. But there is a trap here. There is a minimum spend of 80$S PER PERSON. For dinner. We were there late afternoon and had a platter which was cost effective and good. If you do this activity I would consider lunch or a late afternoon meal, NOT dinner.

All in all, I would say a visit is a ""must do"", the paid activities are up to the individual but we enjoyed them."
,,I saw the lights show!,5.0,,I visited during the evening and there was a music-lights show....it was quite impressive to watch....this is a must when visiting SIngapore.....
,,Very interesting concept and huge structures,5.0,,A very interesting scientific way to tackle the environment and water problem as well as keep the city green and lush. Kids got a peak into science and nature coming together and working in the climate changing world.
,,Amazingly built structure,5.0,,"A very beautiful place with amazing lightings at night, must see light show. A walk along OCBC skyway is recommended."
,,The Super Trees were very cool,4.0,,"Singapore is a beautiful city. It's extremely modern, and almost feels like a mix between Las Vegas and LA. In comparison to the rest of South East Asia, it feels like you have been transported to another world. The Super Trees and surrounding garden area were awesome to see, I didn't make it in time for one of the scheduled light shows, but just exploring the area at night was an experience. They look like something out of the movie Avatar. The trees are constantly glowing and changing colors. The gardens are very peaceful, and are a perfect place to spend a relaxing couple of hours. The trees and gardens are very close to the famous Marina Bay Sands hotel, another must see sight in Singapore."
,,Beautiful Christmas light show!,5.0,,"We were here after Christmas, so there was a Christmas festival. There's a fee to be paid, and it tends to be crowded, but the lights show was beautiful. The trees were lighting up to various Christmas songs; the show is best viewed twice: first, within the area, and the second one from afar."
,,Fab lights show,5.0,,"Everyone has to see this fantastic lights show at night, very enjoyable for all ages. Get some food and drinks and find yourself a nice spot on the grass area, sit back and enjoy!"
,,Absolutely incredible,5.0,,We visited by day and the tree towers were impressive BUT when we went at night-time we were totally mesmerised by the music choreographed to the light-show. AN ABSOLUTE MUST SEE!
,,must be seen,5.0,,This is part of the Gardens on the Bay and is very photogenic. There is a charge to walk along the skyway and that is worth paying for.
,,Spectacular structures,4.0,,"Seen from the ground, these fabulous pieces of architecture are remarkable in their stature and design. The views from the walkways are equally impressive and definitely worth seeing. We visited during the day, so didn't see the nighttime illumination"
,,Dancing Music Trees.,5.0,,A must see place in the evening. And you will enjoy your entire night out and have a beautiful view from this place.
,,Light show is spectacular,5.0,,We had already visited the Botanic and Orchid gardens - so we were only interested in seeing the Supertrees this time in Singapore. We got slightly lost making our way through Marina Sands hotel - so didn't manage to have time to do the walkway (told there was over an hour's queue). Anyway along with hundreds of others we found a spot near the trees to watch the light show. It started at 7.45 and lasted about 15 mins. It was accompanied with music - which added to the effect. It was really great and is unusual. Definitely worth a visit even if you only have a short stay in Singapore and the third free place (Botanic Garden and ION Sky) that we have found.
,,"Amazing, if ersatz trees",5.0,,"This is one of the central features of the Gardens by the Bay. Best seen at night, they are most impressive when seen against te night sky, with the accompanying music. A real ""Sound and Light Show!"""
,,Unique supertree grove structures,5.0,,"Brought our Japanese visitor during the day to visit the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest and went back another day to view the Garden Rhapsody light show where you get to see the supertree grove structures light up according to the music.

As the lights are clearer in the night, you can experience and soak in the light show in the evenings. Currently there are 2 shows daily:- 7.45pm and 8.45pm. Do check out the website to see if there are any changes before you visit.

You could do it all in one day with a visit to the two conservatories during the day, a leisurely dinner before taking in the sights of the light experience."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Make sure you visit in the evening to take in the light show :) The walk from the trees is something that offers great views
,,Visit in the evening for the light show,5.0,,Such a unique concept. The Supertrees look stunning during the day with creepers growing up the sides of them. In the evening try and catch the Supertree show as they light up in time to music.
,,Impressive,5.0,,Quite a sight at any time of the day but fantastic during the evening when the lights are on. Worth paying to do the sky walk but avoid peak time or there are big lines.
,,Futuristic,4.0,,"This place was lovely, the gardens were gorgeous and there were a few eating places nearby. It had a futuristic feel about and there were trams that transported you around on a little tour"
,,Nice walk,4.0,,"The supertree grove is accessible via a walkway from the Marina Bay hotel. It is a considerable walk and hundreds of visitors cram in the passages to visit the trees. Did not have the chance to climb the catwalk since it was closed by the time we got there, but we got to appreciate the nearby lake and fountains and unparalleled view to the Marina bay hotel."
,,"Fantastic for photos, visit at night",5.0,,The trees look beautiful at day and night but I personally recommend seeing them at night if you could only choose one. Entry is free!
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,We only visited on the day and were disappointed not to be able to go on the sky walk due to a light shower of rain but it was still nice to walk around the gardens as a whole. Like all of Singapore it's very humid so go early or late.
,,Brief but worth seeing,4.0,,"We visited Cloud Forest and Flower Dome and then had a meal at the Bayfront food market, waiting for dark. The lights come on punctually and the display lasts for about 10-15 minutes. It's really lovely and worth waiting for. Transport is great around Singapore and there are plenty of options, but a bit of walking involved."
,,Beautiful sights and sounds,4.0,,Best to visit in the late afternoon until night. The lights and sounds are really beautiful. Highly recommended for family or a couple travelling to Singapore.
,,Day & night visit,5.0,,"A must to do in Singapore. To visit during the day and at night. It is 2 completely different scenario ! Don't miss the light show, 7:45pm"
,,Wonderful light show with a magnificent view,5.0,,"Well worth the additional Sin$5 to get up there. What we hadn't realised until we were waiting for the elevator to take us up - officially, you only get a stay of 15 mins. up there! There staff up there ushering you along!"
,,Great View of the Waterfront,5.0,,"These Supertrees are not real tree, part of the Garden By the Bay. The bridge that connects the tree is metal but does sway a little like a rope bridge. The View of the waterfront is great worth the trip up. Not always opened so do not purchase a ticket with the Gardens By The Bay tickets because they can close anytime depending on the wind."
,,Beautiful light show,5.0,,Well worth coming for the 7:45pm light show. Come at least 30 mins early to get a good spot under the trees to watch the show. On mondays the skywalk is closed so we missed out on this - i am sure it would have been amazing to experience the show on this.
,,Awesome at night,4.0,,They are majestic.The lighting at evenings are beautiful. We went on Christmas and found the place to be crowded and lots of activities. There was a beautiful lighting show and totally worth it. Plan for the place at evenings. The area around Marina Gardens is awesome.
,,Breathtaking central place,4.0,,Collection of artificial high trees like vertical gardens that comes alive with an exhilarating display of light and sound at night for 15 mins.
,,Amazing Man Made Structures,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is truly an amazing man made structure that you definitely need to see whilst you are in Singapore. The OCBC Skyway is a must and will give you great views of Marina Bay Sands, the Singapore Flyer and the surrounding gardens. Tickets can only be purchased on the day to the OCBC skywalk - they can't be pre-purchased online. The trees are illuminated at night time and the show when we were there ran at 7.45pm and 8.45pm. The light show was themed to music and was truly amazing. This is a beautiful area to visit, but I recommend visiting during the day and coming back at night which will give you two completely different views."
,,Creative,4.0,,Great show as we went just before Christmas. Crowded though. Parking was a bit far but we managed. It was a good experience overall
,,Great walk through the park,4.0,,"It is amazing what has been done here, the sheer size of the park and the beauty of the flora around supertree grove. What i don't like so much is the over-regulation. Thousands of signs, no access to the sper tree groove at the slightest sizzle of rain for safety. Anyway a good thing to do. Don't go to satay at the beach. No satay, just fast food in a dissapointing setting"
,,incredible,5.0,,Walked around the towers and went on the skywalk around the top ..amazing views and not to scary to walk over ...
,,Artificial Made Attractive,4.0,,"Artificial though it may be, it has considerable eye appeal, and will leave you taking photo after photo. The manner in which the trees are made up is visually stunning both during the day, and night (when they are lit up). Add to this that you can actually get inside some, and tae a tree top walk from one to another.
Surrounding the grove are many notices emphasizing the need for conservation (and with trees like these, you do not need real ones), as well as biological data on tree growth.
Very interesting, educational and appealing."
,,wow,5.0,,Its stunning place to see how light can catch the real beauty of the nature. I spend more then three hours here by watching out every moments and feeling the refreshing time
,,Amazing,5.0,,An area of the Gardens by the Bay. Free entrance. Artificial trees that are illuminated by night and then there's a light show and music too. Worth going if you can to be there around 19:30 for the start. Brilliant and all free.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The lights in the evening were spectacular. There is no charge for the grounds. We just loved walking the grounds and experiencing amazing views.
,,"wild light show , free, twice a night worth seeing",5.0,,We were there after Christmas and saw the evening light show after viewing the glass dome arboretum . The cord was large but comfortable. the light display was dazzling about 15 minutes long. Worth a visit for sure
,,Good view,3.0,,Good view from the top and skyway. However view from Marina Bay Sands Skypark killed it. The view from there is much much better compared to here.
,,Amazing @ Night,5.0,,Go during the night and watch them light up. An experience not to miss. Do search up and go to the lightshows as well.
,,must see,5.0,,Very beautiful and different from all I saw before.. definetely must see if you like light show and nice music
,,Go at dusk,5.0,,We went at dusk so we could see the gardens and then as it gets dark the lights come on and later in the evening they put on a little show. Very worth the visit and it is free.
,,The absolute very favourite of Singapore!!!,5.0,,"This is part of the #1 attraction of Singapore on Tripadvisore: Gardens by the Bay and while it features such incredible sites as the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest the Supertree Grove is very best attraction there is...

At night the light show is otherworldly. People lay down on their back to fully take the experience and beauty in.
Nature rarely creates something this incredible - man practically never.

It's a place to give back your hope in humanity and the modern world through beauty..."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"For anyone coming to Singapore, this should be on top of their list. And don't miss the light show at around evening. You'll be amazed by these tall standing tree structures, truly awesome."
,,Stunning... especially at night.,5.0,,"At 7:45 pm and 8:45 pm, the Supertrees light up with a beautiful light and sound show. It is mesmerising."
,,Worth a look,4.0,,"An interesting peice of engineering, which provides a view across the Singapore Harbour district and the new gardens area. Not a 'must do' but an interesting add-on to a trip to the Gardens by the Bay."
,,gardens by the bay trees,5.0,,go at sunset to see the evening light show with all the trees in sparkling glory. Well worth the evening outing
,,Trees Do Grow To Heaven.,4.0,,Supertree Grove is definintely worth visiting at night to see the interplay of the massive structures with the night lights of the city. A walk among the giant trees is definitely an experience that you aren't likely to forget in a hurry!
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Best free event ever, the light shows are on at 7.40 pm and 8.40 pm so worth it, amazing. If you want to pay to go on the tree top walk its not that expensive but they only allow about 70 people at a time so expect to line up for quite a while if you want to do it in the evening. Eat at the food court there for very nice meal."
,,Great light and sound show,5.0,,Great light and sound show takes you to magical experience and atmosphere with your lover. Never miss it when you visit Singapore.
,,A wonder of the word and a wonderful green proyect in reclaimed land.,5.0,,wonder of the word and a wonderful green proyect in reclaimed land reasonably priced in an amazing area with iconic sights like Garden Sands Iconic building and Marina bay. The light show at 745 pm is also amazing.
,,Intriguing,4.0,,"We had always seen pictures of this structures on the web and friends that had posted these pictures on social media. Yes there is a slight hype about these intriguing structures but as we visited the place its didn't seem out of this world.

Yes we were amazed with the lighting which starts as soon as it gets dark. As we had visited during the Christmas Season we were lucky to see all the wonderful Christmas Trees, lighting and decorations. Such a wonderful delight to the eyes.

It did drizzle a bit and as its an outdoor activity we had to purchase umbrellas which were pretty steep in price.

There are abundant restaurants with a variety of cuisines to cater to various nationalities so you wont go hungry.

Great place for a family activity."
,,Well worth seeing,5.0,,Be prepared to walk in the heat but it's well worth the effort. The gardens and trails are magnificent and well signed. The view from the rooftop of the largest tower is well worth the price ( which includes a cold beverage ). A must do and see
,,Adrenalin,5.0,,"If you are an adrenalin ""junky"", loves heights and thrills then this place is a must visit. Always wear something light and carry a camera cos there's a lot to capture."
,,A must at night,5.0,,This is part of Gardens by the Bay and is a must see. Night time for this is best as this is when the laser light show is on.
,,Very Impressive trees,5.0,,This is a part of the garden by the bay. This trees provide cooling and energy for the park and are beautiful at night!
,,surreal,5.0,,Wow! bravo to the brains behind this unique attraction. such a spellbinding sight either from the tree top walk or from the ground. the light show at night is great as well
,,Stunning!,5.0,,It is a very beautiful place to visit. The views exceeds my expectations: wonderful. It has short lines and it is pretty safe to walk. I loved to visit there. It is a must if you are in vacations in Singapore. I strongly recommend it.
,,Supertree!,5.0,,"Its quite a long walk from MBS but its worth it, would recommend to go late in the afternoon as this is open air and will be too hot if you go on the morning till afternoon."
,,Magnificent!,5.0,,"On researching Singapore I first saw a picture of the Supertrees and could not stop thinking of them. Such imaginative wonders.

Seeing the beautiful Supertrees in person were as good as I had hoped. Full of wildlife intertwined in multiple different colours, so many plants, flowers, huge orchids and seeing humming birds for the first time on our way to get there ... Stunning!

Completely different experience late at night, which was my first introduction to them, lit up with a faint glow, as if they were sleeping against the night sky.

We missed the evening light show at the Supertrees but I'm sure it would be as superb as they are by day. I have to revisit one day to be sure :D

Wish there were more ideas like this out there involving nature. Fantastic experience."
,,Amazing trees,5.0,,"They very tall 12 trees , covered with different plants and different colorful flowers , there is also the skywalk way walk that connect two super grove trees , you need a ticket to go up there, view is very pretty from there and is good place to take the pictures , in evening there is light and sound show on trees that is amazing , highly recommend"
,,go see the supertrees at night,5.0,,We lied down to watch the show where they put on music and the supertrees light up making it a wonderful show for all ages. There are a lot of people and some will dance to the music too. Worth the visit!
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"We walked to Supertree Grove from our hotel Marina Bay Sands, we could see it from our room and keen to walk around. The gardens by the bay are wonderful and the Supertree's and walkway are wonderful, we had a lovely afternoon down there. Highly recommend.+++"
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"This is a masterpiece of electrical beauty. The supertrees are great by day, but at night time they are stunning. The light show each evening is magical."
,,Must wait for 7.45pm performance.,5.0,,Must arrive this place early so that you can get the best spot to watch the show. Make sure you lay down like you are going to do star gazing activity. The 15 minutes performance is very good. They have song from all over Asean. A romantic place. :)
,,Interesting place to visit,4.0,,Thsi park is in the Marina Sands area and is a very good place to visit....we went for a long walk through the gardens but Singapore is tropical and it was a very hot humid days we went...and we are used to the heat coming from Tropical Queensland...but well worth a trip and take a camera as it is a photographers delight...
,,An Ecological Marvel,5.0,,"These huge tree-like structures adorn the Gardens by the Bay and are even lovelier to view at night. This was part of a Viator tour package that also included the Marina Bay Sands Sky Park, a Light show, and a trip up the Singapore River at night. Well worth the price, but not needed as you can buy tickets for each separately."
,,Do not miss if visiting Gardens by the bay,5.0,,Excellent place to visit. Visit towards the afternoon and wait for the sunset to see the sound and light show. Take additional ticket to go up the towers and take the bridge.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Great big metal trees, very ecologically designed with flowers and plants growing all over their 'trunks' and a skywalk linking two of them. How exciting. Another one has a restaurant at the top. And at night they twinkle with a myriad coloured lights."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"The design and engineering of the Supertree Grove is sensational. Fantastic place to just wander around, relax and take some awesome photos."
,,Fantastic Light Show,5.0,,"The trees are amazing structures itself, but the light show was really impressive. We sat on the grass and watched it from below. The light show is free of charge.
You can also go on the skyway for SGD8 approx £5, but you are only allowed there for around 20min as is not so many people allowed at he same time. Must see in Singapore"
,,Super!,4.0,,The Christmas themed lights were on display when we visited the Supertree Grove and they made the evening view from above even more dazzling. Great views of Singapore from the sky walk
,,Awesome trees,4.0,,"And very beautiful at night, the supertrees are a wonderful companion piece of the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome."
,,Unusual and atractive,5.0,,The trees are atractive and when you get there and read the explanation is even better. There is a lift to go up the tree and walk through a pasarella between them from where you can have a great view.
,,Must see at dusk,5.0,,Fantastic place as night falls. Great to see them during both daytime and night. One thing you don't see much around the world. We sat there for awhile in awe. The view from the sands hotel was great as well
,,Beautiful trees day time and evening,5.0,,It´s very beautiful trees on evening when have lights but daytime look good too. I think more better go looking this place on evening because then trees look so nice when have beautiful lights. Should take time and looking around garden same time too.
,,Improves With Each Visit,4.0,,I have visited the Supertree Grove a couple of times when visiting Singapore and it gets better as time goes on. The plants have almost covered the structures entirely and add to the beauty. The sky walk offers great views of the surrounding area and is worth doing.
,,So awesome!,5.0,,"what an amazing thing to see! and the walking bridges between the ""trees"" are so cool! so beautiful to look at and its so worth it!"
,,Great views,4.0,,"It was a great experience walking above the gardens. A great concept, loved it. There was a small charge to go on the elevated walkway but it is worth it."
,,Super Supertrees!,5.0,,"The Supertrees are definitely worth going to see. The construction is impressive, not to mention the great flower and plant displays. There are several of them and there is a high SKY WALK which connects two large trees. The view of the city and bay area from on top is awesome! At night the trees are lit up with lights and its a fantastic spectacle."
,,worth it!,5.0,,"Come during the sunset period where you can take wonderful pictures! great small walk for date but may be crowded. After that, stay a little longer at 7.30pm where the trees would spring up into songs and light displays. People actually brought picnic mats and snacks to enjoy this short free of charge showcase of technology and lights."
,,Great night show,5.0,,"The super trees illuminate at night at 7:30pm and 8:30pm, so twice a night.
You can get a good vantage point from the connecting bridge of the MBS hotel to the garden without having to pay to actually be inside the area or on the skybridge. The illuminations lasts for approx' 15 mins and its quite spectacular. At day, it's quite a site and it really comes alive at night."
,,Cool at night,5.0,,"It seemed a bit silly to pay money for the SkyWalk, just enjoy the light show underneath the big trees!"
,,great for a date,5.0,,take your bestie or loved one for an incredible romantic experience. entrance fee included a drink . Great to go sunset or evening to maximise the romance .
,,Narrow walkway and only a short distance but worth the small fee,4.0,,"Breathtaking views and engineering is apparent on this excursion, very popular at night for the light show but also worthwhile in the day for great photo taking."
,,Very Interesting but Too Hot Day Time,5.0,,"This place is located at Garden by the Bay Marina Bay. It is very close to Marina Baysands Hotel. The place is interesting, it is very unique supertree. It was not crowded but very hot in the day time."
,,Feeling like visiting next Generation,5.0,,"Feeling like visiting next Generation plantation. Lightining is wonderful, Amazing constructions, superb set up."
,,Must Visit,5.0,,Green splendour in urban Singapore. A leisurely stroll at this monumental garden amidst city skyscrapers was for us another small adventure.
,,An interesting but overpriced display worth a brief visit if you have money to burn,2.0,,"We went a few days ago and although mildly interesting it was over priced, brief, very crowded and basically just creepers growing up lattices of scaffolding!"
,,Outstanding,5.0,,Unbelievable presentation (Christmas lights had to be seen to be believed). The music and light show is something I will not forget.
,,Nice place to see,4.0,,One of the popular tourists spots. has a beauty about it and get to see other garden by the bay areas.
,,Hi don't miss the nightly light show,5.0,,The nightly light show is really worth the visit. When we were there the show was on at 7:45 and 8:45 each evening. Free. Just go to the super tree grove and find somewhere to sit. The concrete edging at the foot of the trees is perfect. Short show. Worth the visit.
,,Awesome Tourist attraction,5.0,,The Supertree Grove was an amazing experience. Something totally different. I would highly recommend visiting the Supertree Grove which a close to the flower Dome and Cloud Forest
,,When lit up at night this place is truly magical,5.0,,Worth a visit at night when the trees light up and you gaze up at the while listening to classical music. A popular and free activity for locals and tourists alike.
,,Go see it but very hot and humid.,4.0,,"Go as earky asnyou can we got there about 1pm and the humidity was almost unbearable.
Very interesting to see how the trees work and use the su light etc then fuel other things arou d the gardens.
Nice to take pictures but our lenses on cameras kept steaming up lol.
Well worth a look."
,,An awesome light display,5.0,,There are two light shows every night - we went to the late show at 8:45pm. There is no entry fee. You just have to walk to the grove. The light show goes on for 20-30 minutes and is breathtakingly beautiful. Highly recommended.
,,Remarkable,5.0,,"These ""trees"" are artificial and are designed to recycle energy and you should take a few moments to review the placards that display how environmentally responsible these remarkable structures. They are covered in natural plant life including many pretty flowers. They are distributed all over the Marina Gardens but the densest concentration is in teh Supertree Grove where you can also find the Sky Walk. It's a few dollars extra to go up but the views are stunning.

The Supertrees are lit up at night."
,,Must-go Landmark of Singapore,5.0,,"No one should miss this spot basically! Although the scenic views depend on the weather, it is still magical to see the changing color of these trees. During the day, these trees are eco-friendly ones that absorb sunlight and generate energy for them to ""operate"". At night, these supertrees beams shining lights. The laser show at 7:30pm is simply magnificent! Strongly advise people to explore this place at around 3pm and hang out there til 7pm."
,,Beatiful,5.0,,The whole architecture is very beautiful and seems very overwhelming. Surrounded by nice gardens. It is a must do evening activity.
,,Beautiful Place,4.0,,It is a beautiful place. A must for a picture taking in Singapore. The only downside is that the place will be very hot at noon.
,,Supertree is a good description,5.0,,I can't imaging how anyone conceived of these towering artificial trees covered with vines. It is not just one grove; there are multiple groves. They are just another fascinating wonder of Singapore's Gardens by the Bay.
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"While in Singapore this is a must see, demonstrating human imagination and creativity. A skywalk on the super trees is a must which will give you good view of MBS in the background."
,,Impressive,5.0,,Unlike anything I've seen. Impressive from a distance and just as much close up. Definitely do the walkway unless you have issues with heights but do check the operating times as we found they closed at 2.45pm during Christmas & New Year holidays. Cost SG$8 each which gives you a 15 minute walk along the top of the supertree grove.
,,aussie seniors 2016,3.0,,went in the night to see the Christmas lights and could not get in . the area was being run by a different company that only sold tickets on line .very upset we not able to buy and print tickets when we got there.
,,Fantasy Experience That Is A Singapore Must See!,5.0,,"You can see these supertrees from afar, but nothing is like strolling under this grove! Good in the day, but magical at night. Good for all ages."
,,Walk alot,3.0,,"Just had a view from base. As its a long walk thru the maze like structure. Good view at night. If I had a walker, maybe would take my kid."
,,Excellent viewing after 6pm,4.0,,Visited after dinner at Satay by the Bay...lightings were much better after 6-7pm. Christmas lights were up and really enjoyed seasons festivities.
,,Super Awesome!!!,5.0,,The Super Tree Grove is an awesome place for nature lovers. It has some tall trees which have a walkway through them. There is light and sound show on them and it starts around 6;00 pm and lasts for around 20-25 minutes.
,,Christmas Wonderland,5.0,,"If you come at Christmas time (and the weeks before/after) make sure you buy tickets to Christmas Wonderland - we'd done our homework before coming and had tickets (can only be bought online, no door sales). Otherwise you will be kicked out at 3pm and will miss the Supertree light show. Expect HUGE crowds at this time (which we knew beforehand). However, people movement was well-managed to and from the immediate area, crowds were well behaved."
,,Lovely !!!,4.0,,Enjoyed every minute of this place ....nice pleasant weather ...well managed !! Do nit miss this one
,,Best I've seen,5.0,,"Fantastic experience for all the family to enjoy, young or old this is a must especially at night-Rhapsody in the Park."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,It's a once in a lifetime experience. Totally for us the highlight of our first visit to Singaport. Everything about the visit was fantastic. The light show and seeing the trees in all its glory is definitely a must see attraction
,,went to superb tre gardens during the day time,5.0,,"We went during the day and came back for the sound and light show. Well worth the time and effort. Really interesting construction and concept, Suggest you don't miss the sound and light show in the evening- a must see activity during a visit to Singapore"
,,Great First Time visit,5.0,,"I blame jetlag, but missed my chance to see the light show at night. The park, at least the outside paths, opens at 5am. I was there by 5:15am to take some photos in the dark, and stuck around around to about 8:30am to get garden shots too. I had the whole place to myself. This was the highlight of my Singapore trip. Not sure that it can be compared to having Disneyland to oneself, but it was a little magical. :)"
,,So cute at Xmas time!,4.0,,We went here during xmas time and the light so was so cute. There 2as also an xmas market. Very nice!
,,Pretty at night,4.0,,"Part of Gardens by the Bay. Nice attraction with an elevated walkway giving you good views of the Marina Bay area. Even nicer at night when the ""trees"" are illuminated"
,,Felt like Avataar,4.0,,"The grove itself has nothing much to do. They had a Christmas market on at that time with lots a food, drinks fun and games. the lights on the Super trees are interesting and one can take a walk on the catwalk."
,,Better have real trees,2.0,,"We love nature, we love places like kew gdns hot houses. This is terrificly expensive and we certainly abjor imitation of nature. Why not raise a real forest instead of this cold futeristic nightmare."
,,Futuristic dream land,5.0,,"We have long heard about this supertree grove and seen them lit up in the distance. Visiting them close up within the Gardens complex, though, exceeded our expectations. They are so dramatic and colorful! Go at dusk and stand beneath them as the lights come on. Bring your camera!"
,,One of the highlights of our Singapore trip,5.0,,"Admission fee is 8$ for adults.

Go early in the morning to avoid crowds. Stay away during the night show for the same reason.
However this 'light and music' show is a must see but much better to observe it from a distance to have the whole picture. Shows start daily at 7.45pm, 8.45pm.

Do not miss it!"
,,Absolutely gorgeous!!,5.0,,"This is one attraction you should not miss! These trees look breathtaking in day as well as night...The garden Rhapsody is the light and song show that plays here at night, daily twice...."
,,One of the best things you can do in Singapore,5.0,,Rated at the top of our week long trip to Singapore by all of us. Incredible architecture and an experience to remember for ever. The view are amazing allowing you 15 mins on the walk way and from down below you can enjoy the views for as long as you like.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Visited this place by night, it's so exceptional with the light show, unique place in the world. Should check it out when traveling Singapore"
,,Walk amongst the giants,5.0,,This is worth taking the time to do...great photo opportunities and some quiet time to soak in the wonder of this Gardens by the bay
,,"Very Strange, but kinda Cool.",5.0,,"We went to see this by night in the Christmas season. Very crowded but not unpleasant at all. Carols and tons of lights often choreographed to music. Nice restaurants, lots of local traffic. well maintained and groomed. The ""trees"" are big and bizarre. We did not get a chance to do the catwalk around, but that would have been cool."
,,Spectacular day or night!,5.0,,"One of my favourite places to take the kids. They love going to the Supertrees and the OCBC Skywalk. Its a breathe-taking view and really something so unique! Pictures up on the skywalk are amazing any time of the day!

Tip for the OCBC Skywalk: When you use an OCBC Card to buy an adult ticket, you get a child ticket free! One free child ticket per card.

Hang around for the beautiful light show ""Garden Rhapsody""! The super trees light up and dance in spectacular colours to the beat of awesome music that gets everyone dancing. The Christmas edition till 5 Jan is just beautiful as it ends with the light up of the Dome and a ""snow blizzard"". The kids were tickled pink!

If you are planning to visit soon, check out the Christmas Wonderland Fair, really loads of fun for the kids. Though be prepared that you have to buy the entrance tickets online. Also, be prepared that the tokens are $2 each and each ride is about 3 tokens each. Its definitely an indulgence that I would only allow once a year!

F&B outlets are pricy so pack snacks or a picnic basket instead! If not, I like the peach garden near the super trees, kid friendly, service is good, food is fast and its not that crowded. They also cater for bigger groups of 10-12 people which is great when going with a bigger group :)"
,,Spectacular at night,4.0,,Visited in the day and at night. In the cool of the evening all illuminated it looks spectacular. As it was Christmas it was very festive and the music show reflected the season. This is one of the free attractions in Singapore and one not to miss. We did the walkway between the trees which gives great views over the city and of Marina Bay Sands. Cost $8. Do you have to keep moving so only get about 10-15 minutes. Still worth it though.
,,Seeing is believing,4.0,,The Supertree grove is massive by day and amazing by night. For those of us interested in vertical gardens this is tops and a real inspiration wanting to give it a go.
,,Spectacular light shows,5.0,,Very unusual and in the evenings around 7.30-7.45pm gave off a spectacular light show. Something not to be missed if visiting Singapore.
,,Amazing show,5.0,,"The music & trees dancing, or rather grooving for it was an amazing sight to see. I was lying flat on the ground and was watching it...Wow, it was a show that anyone who travels to Singapore should not miss"
,,Astonishing,5.0,,Singapore as a country does tourist attractions extremely well. Super tree Grove is a testament to that and an absolute must for anyone visiting the island state. It is an astonishing creation and hard to believe but free too. Enjoy!
,,Amazing Attraction,5.0,,"My wife and I were amazed at this attraction the last time we were in Singapore, while it looks amazing during the day. You have to see the light-show in the evening. Wonderful."
,,Lovely place :),5.0,,The Supertree Grove is very impressive and a beautiful place to see. I definitely recommend checking it out!
,,Worth a Look,5.0,,"Another iconic part of the Gardens by the Bay. You will want to have a look the largest of the two ""groves"" of artificial trees."
,,marvelous,4.0,,wander thru the super trees and climb up to them for a better view around the garden and the river. nature and technology fusion made this wonderful
,,Interesting light show,4.0,,"Visited both in the day time and the evening. Each evening there is a light show which is popular with tourists and locals. There is a walkway at the top of some of the trees. Access to the walkway has a small admission cost. You are only allowed to stay on the walkway for about 15 minutes when it is getting close to the time of the light show starting. At the top of one of the Supertree's is a bar, entrance is ten Singapore dollars and you get a drink within the admission price."
,,Science Fiction Fantasy Come True,5.0,,"Ever get the feeling you have been transported to another planet...some New World Order in the distant future or past where man, machinery and plants intermingle? This place is stunning!!! My only advice is keep looking up at the stars!"
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"This was definately a highlight of our trip to Singapore and well worth a visit. By day the gardens are beautiful, especially the orchids. Best time to visit would be early evening as dusk falls when the 'trees' look amazing against the darkening sky. The aerial walkway is fantastic - you go up one tree, along the very stable walkway and down another tree. Time your visit to watch the lightshow by lying on your back on the grass! Unforgettable!"
,,Best time to visit is dusk when they are lit up.,5.0,,"Having seen plenty of photos and also from the hotel window (Marina Bay Sands) they look ok during the day. But when you are underneath them and they light up, now that's impressive."
,,Great during the day and at night,5.0,,"I have visited Gardens by the Bay twice and could go again and again. During the day, there are myriad of different types of 'garden rooms' which are fascinating. Around every bend there is something to see. The Supertree groves are incredible.
You can get there by taking the Marina Bay MRT and then take the Bayfront stop and it is a short walk to the entrance. You can wander around the Gardens for free ,but you need to pay if you want to go up into the Clouds and into the Flower Dome. I just walked around the Gardens.The cost is about $28.
At night there is a three dollar return shuttle that takes you to the main part of the garden. It finishes at nine so make sure you get there early. There is a light display of the trees at 8pm. The best place to watch is along one of the walkways that leads to Marina Sands. You can actually walk from Marina Sands to the Gardens."
,,Totally Amazing!,5.0,,What a wonderful experience. Go at night to get full advantage of there light shows. Great for kids as well as adults!
,,Lost count of how many times we've been here.,5.0,,"We love them, especially at 7:45pm. Amazing place to take our friends and family when they visit. It can get busy but its still great. Get down in them for the lights. Lovely to see from the viewing point further away but you miss the music then."
,,Dominate the skyline,3.0,,We stayed for the lightshow and it was nice but not spectacular or anything. For such mammoth trees I expected a bit more excitement.
,,Supertrees @ Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,Very well designed Supertrees in Gardens by the Bay. Very beautiful at night with lights. Conveniently located.
,,I haven't had less fun in years.,1.0,,"Honestly, what's all the fuss about this place? I expected the ""supertrees"" to be much higher and more majestic, expected some attractions around the place but there are like, ten trees 30 metres high with a walkway between them and that's all. Yeah the light show is cool but the rest just looks cheap and unattractive. Honestly this place doesn't deserve any credit it gets."
,,Best show ever!,5.0,,"I could never image that a night ""fake trees"" show would be so cool and catchy! I was there every night although I had to use the subway to get there.
If possible, try to queue right before the show, so you can walk up while the music is running. And amazing experience and extra point of view!"
,,Majestic,5.0,,Its one of the best things to see in the garden. I havent come across something so grand in any gardens that I have visited till date. Its grand and very well maintained.
,,"Good at night, better in the day",5.0,,"We visited the gardens during the day and did the sky walk as well as taking a walk through the gardens, I had 2 teenagers with me and we all loved it. We went back at night to see the trees all lit up and they were pretty but not as impressive as seeing them in daylight"
,,"Nice to walk in the trees, but perhaps a bit expensive.",3.0,,"It is a quick elevator trip and then a nice walk (couple of hundred meter) in the ""tree tops"". But its quite expensive for what you get."
,,Excellent for Sightseeing,5.0,,Very beautiful to look at specially at night. A romantic place to go to specially if you are on your honeymoon.
,,Don't skip this one..,5.0,,"Another one of those Singapore man made marvels...The tree Grove is intriguing..Totally. Both during the day and when it is lit at night..

It's a unique creation that has to be seen at least once. Do catch the sound and light show at night. There are two shows. Both identical.

Try and get the seat at the Base of the first tree, facing the other trees. That is the best seat of the house."
,,Nice Christmas Light SHow,4.0,,Very funky Christmas light show timed to music. Looks great at night. The trees are covered with vines and funky beams. Great hybrid exhibit
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,"Absolutely beautiful. So much to see. Absolutely spectacular!!! All trees are lit up at night as a light show. There is also a terrific walk amongst the trees which is fantastic. Lovely place to just go and sit, take a picnic, go for a walk etc."
,,Nightview,4.0,,Gardens by the bay is really photogenic especially during night. Feels like you have entered another world. I recommend walking from gardens by the bay to marina bay sands in the night. The views are amazing and offers lot of photogenic scenes.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"You can not miss this if you're in Singapore! Strong recommendation: visit it in the morning and again at night, the lights are amazing and also the view to Marina bay and Singapore wheel. During the day take a nice long walk around and make photos. If you have sunny day it will be more beautiful."
,,I visit here everytime i am in singapore,5.0,,In the evening these trees are lit up and they begin a musical selection with the trees changing colour in accordance with the music.magical and the best thing about singapore for me.ev3ryone sits under them and the mood is serene. Fwmilies couples its a very popular venue twice nightly.
,,AMAZING,5.0,,This is a MUST SEE in Singapore - its for everyone. Its worth keeping the children up late for. The Skyway is quite good - but when we were there the queue was huge - but we waited and managed to do this after the light show- I'd rather do this during the daylight as you would get better views of the gardens
,,Good Views and Photo Opportunities,5.0,,"If you have half an hour sto spare in Singapore you must take the lift up to the Supertree Grove for the very best views of Singapore. My grandson is an ""A"" Level photography student and this was his favorite spot in Singapore"
,,Amazing by night,4.0,,"Photo's don't do it justice after the sun sets. The concept is great and the colours spectacular, I felt the restaurant/viewing platform in the centre was slightly overpriced for entrance which is why the 4 star review."
,,"beautiful at day, impressive at night",4.0,,"Good to walk around, cool garden and structure. I like the structure and design, very cool to take photo with but at night was fun. I was there at the end of november and they already play christmas song and light. Very beautiful and had a great time there."
,,Excellent at night.,5.0,,Bit plain during the day but awesome light show twice a night. Not much seating to watch light show. We sat on very slow steps and as oldies was very hard to get up again.
,,Impressive Gardens & Structure,4.0,,The Supertree structures are well done and interesting and a great place for locals and tourists in a typical Singapore pristine environment. The entire area around marina Bay is worth a visit although perhaps a little sterile and not as interesting as some other places that show the local culture in Singapore
,,Tree tower,4.0,,"The magnificent and breathtaking views from the super trees are totally amazing. We can see entire the bay. Moreover, the light and sound shows are quite good... it's a must-see place in Singapore."
,,Three day visit in Singapore,5.0,,We have visited this place by the night at it was great place to see. We came just at the right time when the light and music exhibition started. It was cool experience with a lot of people that came there just for that. If you can check out the restaurant too.
,,Must visit!!,5.0,,"Went to marina bay garden at the afternoon and spent thete 4 hours so at 20.00 we set down to enjoy the show of light and music with my family (kids are 6,9,11)
It was crowded all around but there was no problem to find a place to sit down and look up. Then a local mother with kids invited us to go upstairs towards the bridge of marina bay sands to see it from there. It was a great idea. We saw and heard all from a little bit distance so it was clear and special and also when the show finished we were already out of the croud. We all loved it and highly recomend."
,,Love the Super Trees!,4.0,,"I felt like I was in Avatar all over again. Magnificent views from the bridge and the ground. Despite the rainy day we still enjoyed it although it would have been perfect if it was sunny. Love the concept of plants and creepers growing along the super trees structure, it would be awesome to see the final stage when plants have reached the top - they will look like real trees :)

Visited in Jan 2015 during our honeymoon but cannot change the year."
,,Amazing Structures,4.0,,Only in Singapore will you see these tree-like massive steel structures. Its interesting to see in the light and the colorful display at night is even more fascinating.
,,"Amazing, the colours are spectacular",5.0,,Try to time your visit for sunset so you can experience the change of light and the 'tress' come alive in colour
,,Amazing views!,4.0,,You can't visit Singapore and not marvel at the Supertree Grove. it is spectacular during the daytime - but even more so in the evening. One of the must-sees in Singapore.
,,Nice but expensive,4.0,,This is a nice project but a little bit expensive. It seems also that it is not finished yet due to the vegetation designed to grow over the towers. It is interesting and the view from atop is great
,,Christmas Melodies by the Supertree Grove,4.0,,"My local friend and I arrived at 7.30pm tonight to watch the light show and listen to the Christmas Melodies - I guess a bit like Carols By Candlelight in Australia.

There many thousands of people enjoying the cooler night walking around the gardens, most coming across from the Marina Bay SMRT station which is around a 15 minute walk.

What we didn't know was that there was an entrance fee which could only be purchased on-line.

Many people were caught the same as us...anyway we weren't worried - we enjoyed the show sitting outside the main area... the lights and music were co-ordinated - it was good fun.

Recommend a visit day or night although night time is spectacular."
,,When the nature meets the future,5.0,,"We have visited Supertree Groove and taken Skywalk. It is incredible place. Even more after you've seen a film in Cloud Forest talking that these Supertrees gather sun energy and use it for lightning itself in the evening.
Before this Skywalk i thought i'm not afraid of height that much but i am:) The walk has no support from the ground. It is kind of suspension bridge. That is why it is limited for 70 visitors at one time. And staff tries to control it but during the evening light show it was much more than 70 people up there.

Try to visit it in the evening at its best view!"
,,A different way to see the city,5.0,,"I'd recommend going here if you're in Singapore. The gardens are beautiful and you get views of Singapore from a different perspective.
Pricing, I thought was very cheap considering there isn't a time limit. Doesn't get over crowded, can take strollers up and walk along at your own pace.
It's very stable and you don't feel like you're that high off the ground."
,,Really cool!,5.0,,"This is really unique. It won't take a lot of time, but it is cheap, offers some good photo ops, and allows you to visualize a possible intriguing ""future world"""
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is an amazing place day and night, the music and light show is a must see and you can finish off by having a drink in the bar on top."
,,Beautiful any time of the day,5.0,,"I could spend hours in the Supertree Grove. The huge metal trees are gorgeous to look at, and at night when they light up, it's mesmerising to look at. At weekends there is a free to watch sound & light show which is worth watching, but does get repetitive.
For a free attraction, you cannot go wrong by visiting the Gardens by the Bay & the Supertree Grove. It costs money to go on the walkway or up to the restaurant/bar, but these trees can be admired easily from the ground."
,,Great Value,5.0,,"The OCBC Skyway is a lot of fun and only SGD 8 each until 530pm then its SGD 10 per adult. . 22m high with excellent views. There is an elevator to the top. Just watch the weather as this attraction closes when it rains. Great day or night. Free light show at night check the website for times, gardensbythebay.com"
,,Simply beautiful,5.0,,"Situated within the marina gardens, this grove of supertrees are strabgely beautiful. Metal trees covered in plants and lights they include an aerial walkway which provides beautiful views of the surrounding area. I could sea the docks, the shipping land, the Grand Prix track, the marina bay hotel and Nancy tiger Lucas landmarks"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Beautiful spot to visit at night and hang out when all the super trees are lit up. Makes you feel transported to somewhere whimsical.
,,The Avatar tree,4.0,,Just inside the Gardens by the bay. These trees are huge and you can go up to the walk but you need to pay for that. Light shows around 8pm and nice to walk around and take pictures.
,,Technology is amazing,5.0,,This Supertree Grove is just so amazing to be self sustaining! The solar collectors to power the gardens and the water recycling are just a couple of aspects of this well engineered garden! This place is spectacular during the day or night! The lights are magnificent and such a calming place to visit! I highly recommend!
,,Do not miss the light and sound show,5.0,,The 15 min light and sound show at 7:45pm/ 8:45pm is excellent. The entire supertree grove has been made beautifully; but the show really stands out. We got an opportunity to see the show first when we were inside Singapore flyer; and then when we went to Gardens by the Bay. Must-see; and free too if you do not want to visit the cloud dome and flower dome.
,,"Only one word, WOW",5.0,,"As title rightly captures it, only one word, WOW, WOW and WOW. Excellent place to visit, both during the day and definitely, must visit during the night when light shows are on. During the day, one will love the greenery all around, then we reached the park in the evening, roamed around the Super tree grove and witnessed the light show. literally you need to lie down on the floor and see upwards towards the sky and you will get an IMAX view. There's an Indian restaurant at the park, really good food, had dinner there, other options are also available. Then we remained there and enjoyed the marina bay view till 1 am and enjoy the relaxed environment. Do not miss this one."
,,Very nice day or night,5.0,,Very nice relaxing place to visit in the day aNd at night it comes alive at 7:45 anD 8:45 with a light show and music ...really nice but get thee early at night if you wanT a good viewing spot or line up and watch the show from the catwalk ....above the crowd
,,Garden by Marina Bay,5.0,,Its very nice garden. Well maintain & well managed. Very nice to visit for any age group. From this garden you can see nice view of Marina Bay.
,,Unbelievable man made beauty,5.0,,The supertrees are a definite visit to see how extremely small we look below them. They all light up in the night. I loved the place.
,,"Super ""descibes it all""",5.0,,"The Super Tree grove is located within the Gardens by the Bay.

The overall 18 super trees, range in height from 25 to 50 metres tall.

Growing up the spires, there are tens of thousands of orchids, bromeliads, climbing plants and a variety of epiphytes which converts these concrete structures into living sculptures.

Two clusters of three each are at the Golden and the Silver gardens, with the remaining twelve for the central part of the Super tree grove.

This is the location where the spectacular light and sound show is provided twice a night.

The 128 metre walkway, connected between two of the super trees is also located here and entry can be purchased with your flower dome and cloud forest ticket."
,,Like being in an Avatar movie set,5.0,,"Visited on a fairly cool afternoon. The flora & greens gave a refreshing & calming feel. My American guest was very impressed at the size, design & uniqueness of this place. Good place to bring a first time visitor to Singapore to take in our ""natural"" man-made garden !"
,,a nice place,4.0,,Here nature meets hi tech . An efficient place nice to see once. Not as great as published but yet a place to visit for sure.
,,Fabulous lights and music,5.0,,so enjoyed the show that stayed for the second! Loved the vibe of families and individuals just enjoying the moment!
,,Windy and nice view,4.0,,"Very windy and nice view. However, I do not like the staff who chase us to walk forward when there are no crowd. We just want to enjoy the view for a while. Overall great experience but the ticket is quite expensive."
,,Love the view from the top of Indochine supertree,5.0,,"The light show each evening is fun - the view back over the city from the top is the best view-point in Singapore with the Marina Bay Sands in the foreground. The cost is high at $18 but that includes a drink (beer, wine, G&T etc) so OK. Usually ok to get a table - not overcrowded, great to watch the sunset - we always take visitors here... classic spot"
,,Laser show spectacular.,4.0,,"I saw this show as part of a night time tour and it was well worth seeing. Lovely music with coordinated light show in the tree tops. Would have loved to have a seat to just kick back and relax to watch it, but it was still amazing. Very popular too!"
,,Great views,4.0,,Walking along the skyway between the supertrees gives a great view of Singapore harbour and the boats in the South China Sea and across the city. A super addition to the walk in the Gardens by the Bay but a bit pricey for a short activity.
,,good views,5.0,,"nice walk to super tree grove, there were next exhibits being created around the trees that looked good too."
,,Beautiful flying saucers,5.0,,We saw ithe structures early in the day and heard there was a light show later they night it was will worth the wait. I took so many pictures I used up all memory. Worth seeing and would go again
,,A day in the park,4.0,,"My wife is the green thumb, but I enjoyed the park too. Very clean, lots of different gardens, and some good places for lunch. The trolley bus is a great feature, for just $3 per persons, you can get on and off and the various drop zones in the park
Just 5 minutes from the subway station"
,,Absolute must see,5.0,,Take the shuttle bus around the gardens and enjoy the commentary. Cost SGD3 and you can use it all day. Great way to get from one place to another in the gardens
,,super awesome place,5.0,,Evening time well spent with family. the late evening show is very beautiful and refreshing. must go.
,,Green thumb's paradise,4.0,,"We went on a Thursday morning, it wasn't busy and there were no lines for tickets. It was like being in sci-fi movie! Amazing plant selections and fun for the whole family with special kids garden."
,,Perfect for memorable picture photo.,5.0,,"Just a walk away from marina bay sand, make sure you visit this place, the area is different from others, don't forget to take plenty of pictures. especially at night time, The Lighting is remarkable."
,,visit during sunset....,5.0,,"Plan your visit all the three (gardens by the bay, cloud forest and super tree grove) in one day...my preference is gardens by the bay in the morning...then cloud forest in the noon and evenings at the super tree grove.....you can go around and get over the bridge and enjoy the sunset...during that time there is light and sound performace...were the lights dance over the trees as per the music......thats what a holiday means....so never miss them.....you can get a combi ticket for all the three....that sounds to be economical........"
,,Do not leave Singapore without visiting the Super trees at night!,5.0,,I cant tell you how spectacular this place actually is! No amount of photography or video can truly show how amazing it is. Just beautiful and at night when the light show (choreographed to music) comes on....WOW! There are simply no words....a definite must and don't make the mistake of doing this on the last night....we did but I wish we had of gone earlier in our trip....to see it twice would have been fantastic!
,,so beautiful at night,5.0,,The supertrees are very amazing. So good to go there at night. On one of the supertrees is a small rooftop bar. Very beautiful an cosy.
,,Great place for a relaxing stroll,5.0,,"Great for families and friends to have a relaxing strolling on a fine day, but its especially lovely to visit after a rainy day, when it's all cooling."
,,Just stunnung,5.0,,Wonderfull place to visit with kids or couples lots to see and do .It has food and some where to sit and you can buy things to take home.
,,Light Show,5.0,,"Supertree Grove is free to visit day & night and it is certainly interesting during the day, but it is necessary to see at night during the Light Show. It comes a live with the lights and music and is a wonderful to see and experience. Just catch the MRT train to near by station"
,,A walk in Garden by the Bay eventually leads to the rooftop bar,5.0,,"On a hot Singapore evening, took a walk to see the Supertree Grove that is located within the Garden by the Bay area. These artificial trees change color, making it a lovely night time activity.

What do I hear? Relaxing classical and jazz music coming from the largest of the trees so I ventured closer to investigate. A noise like wine glasses hitting each other comes through the music occasionally. Ah yes - the base of the largest supertree has the entrance to the elevator that takes you to a rooftop bar. For SD$18 per person you can see for yourself (includes 1 alcoholic drink). The open rooftop bar is quite breezy and very pleasant way to spend a short while here - eating and drinking.

SD$18 per person may be a little on the expensive side but definitely worth going up.

Go on....just do it!"
,,MAN MADE TREE,5.0,,Interesting place to visit and know how they make it so nice.. very nice lighting at night and view is very fantastic...
,,looks amezing in evening light show,4.0,,"These are manmade trees with natural trees, part of ngarden by the bay. looks beautiful in light and sound show"
,,Spectacular at night,5.0,,This is a great experience and especially at night time when the garden comes to life with multi-coloured lighting. Spectacular!
,,Music and light tours,5.0,,"I came here because I graduated from the country organizes an exchange program in Singapore and Malaysia. I highly recommend coming here at night because these trees at night will ""shine"". Its light will glow with the music and it is quiet colorful. This is a visual and auditory feast.
There is a sky bridge about three stories high, need ticket to go up. On the bridge, where the foot is transparent, toucan see the scenery under. When the windly, bridge will shake. If you have fear of heights, you do not go up. Otherwise you not only can not appreciate the scenery but also legs soft down. I personally experienced, and a number of my classmates cried down.
Leaving aside the sky bridge, Super Tree is really a great place. If you have plans to go to Singapore, I strongly recommend that you come here.
This is a trip to light and music and beauty travel!"
,,An excellent place to spend your evenings,5.0,,Evenings are very good when all lights are lit-up. You can walk and enjoy the artificial trees. The whole place is beautifully designed that will make you admire.
,,Unusual,4.0,,These large metal structures are unusual as they have greenery growing up them and can be reached by bridges.
,,You must see this!,5.0,,"A spectacular light and sound show that is totally spine tingling. The colours and the music create an amazing spectacle, we had to see it twice. After it ends ,follow the crowd through the Marina By Sands hotel to the MBS mall and catch the light show on the deck."
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"We waited ages for the light show to start and we were disappointed with it so much so that we left before it ended, I can think of many better things to do than visit this."
,,Clever Disguise of Chimneys,4.0,,These spectacular structure are a very clever way of hiding ventilation shafts and providing a very good visual spectacle by day & night. There is an elevated walkway wwhich we did not try.
,,Worth visiting,4.0,,"Best time to visit would be to enjoy the light and sound show in the evening. It is 12 minutes of pure bliss, unmissable.
IF you visit during the day, you can take the elevator upto the walkway and look around at the sights from the top.
Definitely worth a visit"
,,STUNNING,5.0,,The best time to see these is after dark when the lights were on. We didnt climb them but I would say it would be a fantastic thing to do.
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,"We were there during the day so missed the light shows. However its well worth visiting, taking the elevator up and enjoying the walk. Its only short but provides excellent views."
,,Amazing sight,5.0,,"Even before they were part of a great music synch lightshow (free) these were amazing, but I refuse to call them ""trees."" They are steel structures with linked walkways (not free) and archtectually splendid. But not trees."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Super tree Grove at Bay Garden . Amazing Lighting Show at Super Tree. We enjoy a Lot . Amazing Lighting Show.
,,It's just alright,3.0,,"From far away, this place serves as a good background for your photo-taking pleasure. However, once you get close to it, it kind of feel empty and nothing much to do. There are not many shades around as well, so be prepared to be exhausted from the heat."
,,Amazing Supertree!,5.0,,Located next to the Flower dome. Was a very hot & humid walk but worth a visit. We took a lift up the viewing tower to have a look and had a cool drink while enjoying the view around us!
,,Show time,5.0,,"Get there early in the evening ready for the show and pick a good place. They had just set up with the Christmas music, which was a bit funny in 90 degree heat;)
We went up the super trees at show time and the view was pretty fantastic but we thought the show was better from the floor as you can see all of the trees in their full splendour."
,,The Supertree Grove is a unique feature of Gardens by the Sea,5.0,,"These trees are unique to see. They are the beginning of an elevated walk way. I believe there is a restaurant inside the largest one or at least an observation level. At about 7:45 pm every night they become part of a music, light show NOT TO BE MISSED. The locals bring their chairs to sit in and watch the show. There is no charge to see the show."
,,"Go see these amazing ""trees""",5.0,,"Amazing ""trees"" are incredible to photograph at dusk as their lights come on. As you walk among them you can take great shots of the Marina Bay Sands, the Singapore Flyer and the Cloud Forest."
,,Trees alive at night.,5.0,,Very stunning view from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel view deck. I' ve waited until 7:45 to witness the dancing lights of trees. Amazing to watch in the morning but better at night. Never mind going to the elevated walkway. Can enjoy the view on ground.
,,a lovely sight,4.0,,"The trees, which are unremarkable during the day, become magical after night fall. We skipped the elevated walkways and enjoyed the sight from the ground level. The light show is remarkable and well worth the time we spent."
,,Must see at night.,4.0,,Supertree Grove is a must see at night. All the trees aluminate at night. There is nightly light and laser shows as well. This is a must see when visiting Singapore.
,,The light sympany at night is stunning,5.0,,Sit back or even lay back on the lawns and be simply amazed by the light and music show at the Bay. Free to the public it really is a wonderful experience. My only complaint is that I wanted it to last a whole lot longer! So we went and saw it twice!
,,A beautiful night attraction,5.0,,"This is a must visit place at night.... Cant say its beauty! The entire place just concentrates on these magnificent structures and when the light show starts, this is just extra ordinary."
,,magical night,5.0,,"we toured the attraction, had fun and when we thought all is over, boom......the supertree light display. we enjoyed it to the max"
,,Fantastic & free but you need a ticket to visit the top!,4.0,,"We visited this at night, hoping to go up to the top and walk on the suspended path. It closes at 9pm but the last entrance to the top is 8:30pm. Unfortunately we missed out as although it's free, you still need to obtain a ticket and the ticket window closes before 8:30pm (strange). We sat on the ground and watched the sound and light show at 8:45pm which was amazing. Much better than the Light Show on the harbour front. Worth a visit at night just for the show. 5mins walk from Downtown Station on the MRT."
,,Nice attraction,4.0,,Perfect for tourists who loves a very colorful view (especially at night). You could just sit there and be amazed while watching a musical light show along with other tourists during the night(cant remember the exact time but i think it starts around 7:30). But it was really tiring walking our way there. It is really a long walk.
,,Amazing light show,5.0,,Definitely try to visit around the time of one of the light shows. The trees lights are coordinated with music and its really impressive. The sky walk/bridge was closed when we were there but I don't think its really necessary to pay for access to this to get a good view of the trees.
,,Unusual,5.0,,These Supertrees glow in the dark because they are solar powered. Very unusual but definitely worth seeing.
,,Just walk around for free and enjoy the lights,4.0,,"Skip trying to go up on any paid walkway and enjoy a free walk on the ground around the supertrees. The lights change and often their is music. They are best seen at night, after dark. The Grove connects to a walkway along the river and you can wander all the way to Marina Bay Sands, and then Clark and Boat Quay without ever crossing a road."
,,Go at night,5.0,,"During the day, the beauty of these beasts simply can be overtaken by the surrounding Gardens, but at night.... Oh my! The entire place just concentrates on these magnificent structures and then at 19:45 nightly, the light and music show starts. This is when you really can say WOW"
,,You must see this in the evening!,5.0,,We decided to go visit the man-made Supertree Grove one night. I think we got there around 7pm and noticed that there were hundreds of people sitting around the trees on the ground. We decided to sit down and right at sunset the music started playing and we got to see a fantastic light and music show that lasted about 30 minutes. This is a MUST see if in Singapore!
,,Tree-rific!,4.0,,"(Bad joke, I know)

Take a stroll around these super trees and have glimpse of the entire garden. It's spectacular and great to see some nature within a huge bustling city. I recommend going when it's darker so that you can see the trees lit up.
There are plenty of resting areas and some gift shops that have trinkets and amenities i.e. water."
,,Really cool to walk around,5.0,,"Came here one evening. Very clean, easy to get around. Paths are in great condition. Lots of people but didn't feel over crowded. I'd have loved to go to the top of the tree but the line was really long. Perhaps another time."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Spectacular during the day and dazzling at night. Spend a leisurely day at the Gardens by the Bay and witness this engineering marvel.
,,Light n Sound Show @ Supertree Grove,5.0,,Located at Gardens by the Bay... We were lucky to view the Light n Sound show @ Super tree Grove....
,,An amazing place to visit day or night,5.0,,You can walk around here day or night. It is a lovely place to visit and a must see. Looking up or looking down at this attraction is fantastic. There is so much to see and take in. I would suggest that you wear appropriate walking shoes if you are going to walk for a while as well as a hat for during the day.

,,Good view of the gardens,4.0,,"A treetop view of the gardens for a small fee. However, if you have the time it is worth paying a bit more and take in the view from the top of the adjacent Marina Bay Sands Skypark."

,,WOW!!,5.0,,"We stumbled onto this area at nighttime. Boy, are we glad we did!! It's difficult to describe the way these ""trees"" look, but the evening light & music show was stupendous!

,,Something different,4.0,,"I quite liked strolling around the garden and there are a few places to have a drink or something light to eat, even a full dinner if you like.

,,Dont miss it if you are in the Gardens by the bay,4.0,,"If you are visiting Gardens by the bay this one differently worth the 8 dollars it cost, seeing things from a height is always interesting"
,,Night sound and light show is great,5.0,,Stay a little longer in the Gardens by the Bay and experience a wonderful sound and light show. Get there a little early and grab a comfortable chair to watch the entire event unfold.
,,Excellent experience,5.0,,2nd visit to the Super tree grove. Has 2 shows 7.45 and 8.45pm. The walk among the tree tops is amazing. Not if you don't like heights. The lights and music is excellent and free. Must see in Singapore
,,Awesome Show,5.0,,"The SuperTree Grove is a place best to visit at night! Its part of the Gardens by the Bay and s a perfect location for afternoon walks! The die-hards can go up the walkway and walk from tree to tree and have an awesome view of the surroundings. Careful, if you are afraid of heights, better join the view from below, nice enough! The highlight of the Grove is the evening show. Its a mix of music and light and it brings something magical! Make sure you are early if you want to sit, however its clean enough (its Singapore you know) to sit on the floor!"
,,beautiful lights show,5.0,,It's free. Just infront of the MArina Bay Sands Hotel. It has 7:45pm and 8:45pm show every night. The music and lighting were beautifully arranged. I believe each month it's being change. Love it outdoor lighting.
,,walk top of trees,4.0,,this lighting trees in the night is very attractive area to visit wonderful experience to walk top of trees from one to another
,,Amazing night show!! A must see,5.0,,"Go and see the night show! If you only have one night in Singapore go and see the night show..... then go do other things.

The night show, the super tree grove lights up to music, I know it sounds simple, but it is truely amazing walking around in the grove during this. Don't feel bad walking around also, remember most people are looking straight up during. So you won't cut off anyone's view.

Big tip, don't find a seat on the stairs to watch from a distance like the heaps of people you will see doing just this. Get down there. It's a completely different experience. Trust me.

Will 100% visit again."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"It is best to go during the evening and during weekdays as it is very empty during these hours. This means you get to roam the entire square without having to listen to other people shout or scream. Furthermore, you are able to watch the sunset during this time and it would be perfect for couple retreat or a even a family gathering."
,,Best at night,5.0,,"Best at dusk/night during the light shows. I wouldn't bother with the skywalk, its short and the light show is better viewed from below."
,,Will just get better,4.0,,These large steel tree structures have wonderful plants growing up them. They are still some way off the top but I can imagine they will be stunning in time.
,,More concrete and steel than nature,2.0,,Probably the most photographed site in Singapore these days. But when you are there it's mostly concrete paths and steel constructions. Of course no way you would be allowed to step on the grass. So nothing of the ease and relaxation of a true park.
,,Beautiful place for An evening walk.,4.0,,the vast garden and cool breeze from the evening sea makes it a pleasant experience . The well maintained gardens and artificial trees blend well into the garden. There's quiet a long queue for entering into the Artificial giant trees.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Just want to add, this is free!!!!!!!
Just go and sit and wait for 7:45 and/or 8:45 for an incredible light show that is romantic and mesmerizing.The $8 canopy walk may be worth it but bear in mind you are limited to 15 minutes up there, staff are on hand to move you along.
The best view of the light show though is down on the ground. Looking up at the show gives you the best view for photos, video, or just sitting holding the hand of your love :)"
,,Great light show set to music,5.0,,"My tip would be to get there early, pay a small fee and watch the light show from the elevated walkway, lots of people lie on the ground and look up so if you're going to take this option a blanket might be an idea."
,,Don't Miss this !,5.0,,"Supertree Grove is within the Gardens by the Bay precinct and should not be missed if in Singapore. It is spectacular. Don't miss the light show at 8.45pm each night. All the trees are powered by the sun and the plants growing are watered by harvested rain water, it is truly a sight to be seen - they are enormous. The music that goes with the light show is fantastic and gives a really good vibe. Highly Recommended !"
,,Awesome view,5.0,,"Located in Gardens by the Bay, the Supertrees are something every visitorthere should see. Standing tall at several storeys high, you can even walk on these paths linking the trees with each other. the view there is scenic and beautiful."
,,Nice,4.0,,It was raining the day I went but it was lovely to see the beauty in this place. Some areas have an admission fee but others are free. Because of the weather I did not stay long but it is well worth seeing.
,,Don't miss the Light show,5.0,,"I live in Singapore and so we get a lot of visitors, for most tourist attractions i will send my friends off to enjoy them but not the light show at the Super tree grove. It is awesone the whole area lights up and the sho is changed quite regularly. Also if you are staying at Marina Bay Sands on the Garden side you can watch it from above."
,,Great night time activity,5.0,,"Make sure you bring your camera as the views from the skyway is spectacular with Marina Bay Sands in the background. The trees are best viewed and night when the light and music shows are on. This occurs twice a night, so plan your visit to coincide with this."
,,Night shows are a must!,5.0,,Nature meets man-made with a dazzling light show every night. This is a must visit for anyone travelling to Singapore!
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,See this by day and night. It's wonderful. The lighting at night is glorious. Yo can do skywalk there where you walk between the tree tops
,,amazing,5.0,,The supertree are most beautiful after sunset. Very calming and enjoyable experience. Daytime is quiet but the night time lighting really brings the supertree grove to life.
,,Wait on line!,5.0,,The wait is worth the views especially if you time the music show so that you will experience some from the walkways. There is food stalls so grab a drink or bite. Kids barely even realized they were in line because the lights are beautiful and when the music starts it is spectacular. The wait time was only half of what the sign said because the venue is so efficient. If you go to gardens by the bay- Dome and Cloud Forest then get your hand stamped so you can re enter at night.
,,Average place,3.0,,"The Super tree groove is an average kind of place The show that happens in the evening is ok . it lasts for about 15-20 mins . It is not bad , decent for kids but not something that created the Wow factor"
,,Wonderfull,5.0,,This is a must see in Singapore. It's part of the Gardens by the Bay. The entrance to the park in right through the the hotel and the metro line.
,,Fantastic Design and Scale,5.0,,The Supertree Grove stands out in the Gardens by the Bay complex. They are lush structures which really make an impression when you walk among them. Gardens by the Bay has a Disney impact on visitors as they all seem to be relaxed and in good spirits.
,,It really is high up,5.0,,There is a lift to the top with a great view of Singapore. If you visit Bay of Gardens make sure you come here. $8 to get to the top and take some amazing pics.
,,Go at night time to see the best parts,5.0,,"Make sure you go at night around sunset, it gets really busy so best to have your skywalk tickets early and be in line as by 8pm, there was no chance of getting up there.

The trees are not nearly as impressive during the day as they are at night. We may have missed out on the walk however being below the lit up trees was just magical and the place was heaving with people but it was such a nice night and can't wait to go back again in the future."
,,Sound & Light Show,5.0,,"The evening Sound & Light Show was really excellent. Having visited the Gardens by the Bay, we returned in the evening for the Light Show. We used the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit to get there. It was easy travel and the large area meant you were able to find a great location to view the night show. With the warm climate, the evening was the best time for this outdoor activity."
,,Our Asian Adventure,5.0,,"What a sensational idea. Make sure you not miss this. We watched it from close by the for the second show we moved to a higher position about 1 kilometer away and it was just as good and you could see more of the show. But the music was harder to hear.
You need to be early for the best views. Other tourist love to push in front of you and try and make room where there is no room."
,,amazing marvel,5.0,,The most beautiful sight in singapore not to be confused with the ticket counter at entrance most part of the garden by the bay is free.
,,Super trees,5.0,,"We really enjoyed the experience at the Gardens by the bay. Wished we had got there a bit earlier to see more of the domes in daylight, although they were well lit. Loved the Flower Dome and the Cloud Dome, then watched the Supertree sound and light show twice."
,,Unusual Trees,4.0,,There is an amazing light show at 7:30pm using these trees. It's best seen from a distance. We did the Moonlight tour which incorporated the light show. While it was nice being right there the view of the show was much nicer from a distance. We watched the show again the next night from the Singapore Flyer.
,,Musical Evenig with Supertree,5.0,,In the Marina Garden there are many huge tree like structures. These supertrees look very beautiful in the evening when lights come up to looks. The musical show starts at 7.00pm which is beauty to watch. Need to take a good place from where you can watch the entire show of Musical lights.
,,Beautiful park,5.0,,"The latest addition to the green city, these beautiful gardens are not only green but also an engineering marvel with the super trees and gigantic green houses. Like everywhere in Singapore F&B is never far away."
,,Should be naff but isn't.,4.0,,Worth the visit for the light show but the music seems oddly chosen. The light show is iImpressive from the garden but it must be great to see it from the Marina Bay Sands at the top - if you are booked in there it would be free!
,,Super Trees on a Super night,5.0,,Gardens by the Bay is a must do on anyone's trip to Singapore. The Super Trees are the centre piece of the gardens and over the next few years as the foliage grows over the structure they will become even more stunning. Go during the day to just marvel at the idea and the amazing plants. Then go again at night to to watch the trees come to life with music. For 15 minutes from 7:45 pm the light show is just amazing.
,,A vision of the future,5.0,,"Visit the Gardens by the Bay and visit the Super Tree Grove. It's free, and is absolutely stunning. A vision of the future of vegetation in the city. Also take the opportunity to take the Sky Line tour and fly around these tress. Wonderful."
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"The supertree grove is a unique attraction and definitely worth visiting at night when it is all lit up. The site is free to visit, but the trip up to the walkway connecting a few of the trees gives as even better view of the trees themselves as well as the marina bay sands hotel. Take a tripod and get some great pictures of the trees as well as the hotel in the background. They also did a nice light and music show with the trees while we were there."
,,the sound n light show was fun,4.0,,"we did all the flower dome,cloud forest n the supertree grove,but stay back for the light n music show at dusk.it is entertaining.we were scared of the bug bites but had no problem with the mosquitoes,it was an evening well spent"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Well worth a walk around the lush green gardens then pay $8 to go up to the treetops. Good views of the city easy access via the MRT
,,beautiful gardens,5.0,,"heard so much about these gardens...and they are fantastic,wish we had another couple of hours to just wander around and the super tree..the view from the top is great. ken"
,,Evening wonder,4.0,,Visit this place after sunset for a great light and sound show. This place does not require any entrance fee. In all tours and packages promotions you can see this particular pic so highly recommended for selfie freaks.
,,It is in Gardens by the bay,4.0,,It is in Gardens by the bay and you can see the light & music free show at 7.45 pm & 8.45 pm. it is worth to see.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"The Supertrees are just goregous. Equally as beautiful in the day as they are at night. But if you can, make sure you see them at night when they are are their full glory."
,,Great Views,5.0,,"Despite being afraid of heights I went up and glad I did. They have a number of people allowed on at the same time, which made me more comfortable with the height and it was not crowded."
,,Excellent,5.0,,This is something to view both day and night. During the day you can walk around the magnificent gardens and visit the 2 domes. At night you can view the light show.
,,Fabulous place,4.0,,"This place is just spectacular! Whether you are viewing from above or in the hotel, or walking through the beautiful gardens and landscape it is beautiful and a brilliant escape for many peaceful hours"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This was a highlight of our holiday. We went in the early evening to look at the trees in daylight, then waited until the night show. Worth going early to get a good position, there are some seats provided, and you can sit around the base of some of the trees.
Spectacular light show and music. Free too which is a bonus."
,,"Good, But not best",4.0,,Nice to have a lok but not a Must see attraction. Good for Kids. Night is even better. Can get a look at a Show too. Not Stunning though
,,best food ever!,5.0,,"it is an expensive restaurant , minimum spend is $80 per person , but omg its so worth ive never anything like this, the food was amazing"
,,Magic place,5.0,,"So many things to discover...plants, different views, lights on the evening, restaurant..,..another place to go if you stay in Singapore. You will enjoy walking and looking ones your right then on your left and will see attractive views."
,,Don't Miss this,5.0,,Don't miss this. So very clever and I am sure you will not have seen anything like it. Loved it. The Park they are in is also very interesting.
,,"Amazing with music, leaves you with a sore neck",5.0,,"These trees are big, beautiful and at some points lit up in a dazzling light display. I walked around for an hour, neck craning, just soaking them in from every angle.

We happened to visit on a Saturday night in October and were treated to a wonderful light and music show that drew quite a crowd to the grove. I highly recommend visiting if you can make it for the performance."
,,Super trees bar for the sunset then lightshow,4.0,,I think one of the best ways to see this attraction is a short wander around the base of the trees to admire their construction then head to the bar at the top of one of them. Buy a ticket at the bottom which gets you entry and a drink included. It's great to watch the sun set behind the city and Marina Bay Sands. Once the sun has gone down head to the bottom and take in the light show. We found a great vantage spot up some stairs onto a second level which was away from the crowds and had a better view plus less neck strain!
,,Do Not Miss the Light Show,5.0,,"These gardens go from strength to strength, we have been to Singapore several times and never miss an opportunity to look at the ever increasing development of the gardens.
The night light show is fantastic and there are several positions around Singapore to watch it then get down to Clarke Quay for dinner, a great was to spend an evening."
,,Gardens of the bay,4.0,,It was just awesome...music with lights....and u can do rest dere as well...as we can lye on the grass to feel the show..
,,creative &innovative trees!,5.0,,"very good for night photography with the must-see (free) show:garden rapshody at night. If you can, try a skywalk with a top view at sunset time, nice Singapore sightseeing from treetop!"
,,"Nice plan near Garden by the bay, worth a visit.",4.0,,"Nice plan near Garden by the bay, worth a visit.. It looks excellent in night time with lights. If you want to go up the tree then day timing is better, you can combined with Garden by the bay tour."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I wanted to go up when it was getting dark so that I could see the beautiful lights. We lined up for about 15 minutes and that was just before 7pm. So it was bright for a little then by the time we finished our walk it was dark.
Took plenty of photos . They have staff that usher you along but we had plenty of photo opportunities.
If you're scared of heights don't go and if you decide to just don't look down."
,,awesome,5.0,,it was really nice at night. we stayed to see the night show. it was fantastic. we really had a great time
,,An Amazing Attraction,4.0,,"Well this venue is actually a few attractions all together, this part is amazing as a sky walk through the artifical trees which are amazing in themselves. It is accessed via a lift so if you suffer from a fear of heights this is probably not for you. A total different experience during the night as compared to the day, so if possible try and time your visit to suit."
,,A must visit in the evening when in Singapore,5.0,,"We were there during the Autumn Festival and there were extra attractions in the gardens, very spectacular in the evening. We have visited before, but enjoyed visiting again, as there was a different sound track for the light and sound show."
,,SuperTree Light Show,5.0,,"I would highly recommend the SuperTree light show that takes place nightly at 7:45 and 8:45pm. There are a few different shows that the grove rotates through so you can go several times without seeing the same show twice! The show is a combination of music and lights on the ""supertrees."" It is truly spectacular and one of the highlights of a visit to Singapore. Best of all, the show is free!"

,,Amazing,5.0,,"Super trees look so amazing,you have to pinch your self,to believe. And the icing on the cake,is the light show,you will be dazzled by the colors.Sit on the ground and enjoy all the super trees."
,,Gardens by the bay,5.0,,"Its a must to go there when you are in Singapore, also the nearby glass houses are impressive. its really worth the money."
,,Very pretty and different,5.0,,"These sculptures were impressive from the ground, but way better from the walkway. You have to pay to go to the walkway, but highly recommend. You had a nice view of the gardens, as well as some of the other attractions like the Marina Sand Bays hotel and Singapore Flyer. You were allowed around 15minutes up on the walkway, but it did get busy as when we went. the walkway was shut for a certain time due to bad weather, but once it was opened, quite a few people went up"
,,Artificial Trees,4.0,,"It made me see impossibilities as possibilities ,nothing is hard to achieve with the human mind.Singaporeans are very creative , they make use of whtais available no wonder they are ahed in terms of development."

,,I love it,5.0,,"I visit the supertree grove at the morning. It""s really lovely. Especially at the sunny day with blue sky and bright sun. I think it is very well design. The trees are more than 30 meters high . You can climb to the middle of the tree and see wonderful view. You can also wall along the bridge between the trees. But that's a little scary."
,,worth a sus,4.0,,pretty cool and interesting area to walk around - light show at 745/845 each night the best time to go so you can see the light/music show.
,,Gigantic Structures at Marina Gardens,4.0,,The Supertree Grove can be found at the Marina Gardens next to Marina Bay Sands. At night it is illuminated with multi-colored lights.
,,Must see,5.0,,Make sure that you stay for the light show at around 7.45pm it is lovely. Excellent attraction to see.
,,Awesome to see,5.0,,"We were in Singapore for one night, we walked to the supertrees late in the evening, 9-10pm. Park was well lit, we, my wife, two children under three and I, felt safe in the park. The supertrees were awesome to see. We arrived after the music and light show, however the trees alone are worth the trip."
,,Need to watch the show,5.0,,The music and lights show is definately worth going to. Best idea is to get dinner first and then watch the show. Food at the super trees in good quality
,,Highlight of the trip,5.0,,"The most amazing lights show. The music and treelights were simply extraordinary and an absolute MUST. It's free and combine with the tree skywalk for 8 dollars. Perfect evening! Best for couples, shame I didnt have anyone to bring except a mate..."
,,fantastic,5.0,,Great gardens fantastic light show with music especially from the sky walk with views alround the city and gardens
,,Great view and must see if you want to enjoy the sunset,5.0,,Got the ticket and chose the sunset time to enjoy the sun falling down slowly right after Marina Bay Sands and Singapore Flyer. That was a good moment when you see together with the musical orchestra from below. Many couples chose here for wedding photoshoot and that would be the perfect moment.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We saw the Supertree Grove at night was amazing and a fantastic light show using the Supertree groves, unfortunately didn't get to do the walk up there but hopefully next time. There are two light shows at 7:45pm and 8:45pm. Definitely worth a look!"
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Absolutely stunning especially when the sun goes down and the lights come on. There's 2 Light shows at the Supertrees, 7:45 and 8:45pm. This part of the Garden is FOC, only need to pay if you enter the Domes"
,,Amazing light show!,5.0,,"Situated in the Gardens by the Bay the Supertree light and sound show in evening hours is really worth staying after one has spent time in the other attractions around.
The show is free. If you want to do the walk along the top of the trees, there is a charge but the greatest part is watching the light show from below.
Catch hold of a chair by visiting the arena little in advance (say about an hour) !"
,,Amazing,5.0,,This is a must see the man made tress are truely beautiful with all the plants and ferns placed through them. For S$8 you can take a walk through the top of the trees for a view over the Garends and surrounds. At 7:45pm and 8:45pm there is a spectacular light show throw the trees to Broadway music it is really lovely and goes for approximately 20 minutes and is free. Well worth going in the afternoon and waiting for the light show
,,One of the best shows I've seen,5.0,,"The place itself is magic, by day and by night. But when the music show starts it's like a dream come true."
,,Very attractive at night,4.0,,"Situated in the Gardens by the Bay the Supertree Grove is the star attraction, especially at night. Get there for the light show at 7.45pm and 8.45pm daily to see the trees light up and change colours in a beautiful display. There is a rush for the taxis right after the show but if you go for a stroll in the gardens after the show or take in one of the domes nearby (flower dome or cloud dome) then go for a taxi later, you won't have any trouble getting one. The light show itself is free. If you want to do the walk along the top of the trees, there is a charge but I think the greatest part is watching the light show from below."
,,Be on time to get the best lie down position!,5.0,,"This place doesn't fail to wow me! The evening sound and light show is spectacular! There is music and lights. Just be there ahead of time to grab an ideal place to lie down on the floor to get the best views!
The taxi cues in the evening can be long and the walk to an from a subway is very far. It can get either exhausting or expensive. So plan ahead. We enjoyed our day there and saved for a cab later."
,,Surreal landscape,5.0,,"The supertrees present a totally Avatar-ish view and one can almost imagine having landed on an alien planet. These living, breathing structures are not just marvelous to behold but become positively captivating once the evening illumination is switched on. The light and sound shows are amazing and there are plenty of good places to eat in the area as well after the extravaganza."
,,Next to the hotel,4.0,,"Definitely worth a visit, gives good views of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the surrounding gardens."
,,Amazing Trees High In The Sky,5.0,,"In the botanical gardens lies this gem of an attraction. Giant metal trees that tower above you and have foliage growing on them. The appear surreal rising from the tropical gardens of the bayside. Pay your fee and ride the lift to the 22 metre high platform that lets you walk from tree to tree. The veiws are spectacular and the walkway hangs on steel ropes and gently sways as you walk - designed to allow you the experience of walking at the height of the tropical rainforest canopy, there are orchids growing high in the sky on these amazing tree structures. An unforgettable experience but not for the fainthearted!"
,,Skin deep,2.0,,"Impressive when walking through the Gardens but a comparatively expensive disappointment if walking the walk. A real let down to the whole park, Would not venture on these ""boards"" again."
,,A must to visit in Singapore!,3.0,,Great attraction to be for all age groups. Visit the dorms and the restaurants close by. Try Indochine or Pollen.
,,"Great price, worthwhile if no queue",4.0,,"I turned up with no real planning early evening mid week and there was no queue, so for $8 it was worth doing, I saw signs on arrival which made me think this place can get a seriously long wait time and I think if you are waiting for more than 30 minutes, it's not worth it.

However the walkway is fun, not too long and with great views - not quite as much flora at the top and the super trees stand out as impressive man made structures, rather than being disguised by tropical plants which is what I would have expected - but still very impressive."
,,nice walk,5.0,,the walk was shorter than expected and the attendants kept pushing people to move on which I didn't like though do understand.
,,Truly stunning at night!,5.0,,Amazing to walk around and see all the unusual plants growing up these 'palm tree' structures. So beautiful at night as they keep changing colours. Great to go up to the bar at the top of one of them. Cost us $18 but you get a free drink too and the view is sensational!
,,Late afternoon,4.0,,It was nice to spend the late afternoon here and relax after walking around the other local attractions. Another impressive piece of engineering and worth the visit.
,,See Marina Bay gardens - MUST DO,5.0,,See my review under Marina Bay gardens - this is a MUST DO experience and is in my view the most impressive garden experience I have ever had
,,Great experience,5.0,,The trees are fantastic- it's much better to be there and see them alive than just in the pictures. There's a lovely view from the walking bridge and they are even more beautiful at night when they change colours. Now I feel a bit sorry that we didn't go up to the cafe- nex time.
,,Spectacular botanical gardens,5.0,,"This place is amazing, day or night, well worth a visit. There is a high level cafe and it is just beside the Marina Bay Sands hotel"
,,Unique dining experience in the heart of Singapore,4.0,,"The Supertree Grove is yet another one of Singapore’s unique attractions and restaurants. The food is good but not excellent but the overall experience of dining in such a unique “tree” is worthwhile. In addition, it is very conveniently located near many other worthwhile attractions that are all easily accessible. The Supergree Grove also has a “rooftop” bar above the restaurant that has nice views. Recommend this for families or a business meal particularly if there are visitors from overseas."
,,Evening visit is best,5.0,,"Evening stroll under cooler conditions and with lights turned on at the Supertrees and nearby MARINA BAY HOTEL will be outstanding. A photographers delight. Near the Supertrees are some very good restaurants at resonance prices, so an evening dinner is possible."
,,Wonderful Family and Friends Attraction!,5.0,,"No visit to Singapore is complete until you have explored and experienced this area complete with beautiful landscaping, flora, waterways and of course these electronic trees.

Shortly after dark a light show is presented with a variety of music from around the region to entertain one and all.

Everyone enjoyed this special and peaceful place."
,,WOW!!!!!!!,5.0,,"That's all I can say....WOW!!!!! I don't think you can compare this to anything else. We visited it during the day and we already thought it was amazing, but of course we went back at night. We got there around 6:00PM, when it was still light and you could slowly see the lights coming on. When it finally got dark, it was just awesome. And then the light show started. Amazing.
The park around it is just beautiful and full of beautiful flowers (orchids). Take the walkway to enjoy a beautiful view. It's 22 metres high.
Don't skip this when you're in Singapore, because this is definitely one of the highlights.
We loved it."
,,Light and Sound Show was incredible!!,5.0,,"The huge gigantic Super Trees are a delight to see and explore anyway but the light and sound show that happens in the evening is fabulous... a must see, i must say."
,,Great photo opportunities,4.0,,"These gardens are a great place to get some photos but you will need a little time to walk around them and as Singapore is usually hot a wide brimmed hat, some comfy footwear and some water is a good idea."
,,Feels like in Avatar,5.0,,It is breath taking! After the sun is down and the lights come on it feels like a visit in Pandora. There is a light show as well.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Amazing structures. We enjoyed walking on the bridge with an overview of the city. :) They also have beautiful and unique plants :)
,,Supercool,5.0,,"We visited during the day as part of the hop on hop off bus tour. Take the lift up and walk through the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The view as you come out the doors is pretty incredible. Take great panorama shots from here. Walk down stairs and out to ground level amongst the trees. You can pay $8 to catch a lift (or take stairs) to the top of one tree and use the floating skywalk held up by cables to walk around to another tree. You can catch this lift down or walk back along skywalk to same lift/stairs you originally came up. For those scared of heights it may be abit daunting, just hold on and don't look down. Well worth going up. About five or more restaurants to eat at. I recommend the coconut curry. So delicious. We then walked back to entry via boardwalk right next to man made Dragonfly river for viewing of the silver dragonfly sculptures and amongst greenery. My number one Singapore attraction. Was awesome at day but lit up at night I imagine would be even better. Do not miss this attraction!"
,,Awesome Light,5.0,,"Great giant lighting tree,a symbol of how Singapore can combining modernization with nature environment. Great view when evening to the night. very fotogenic"
,,Lighting is Spectacular,5.0,,"Had been there during the day time , but on dusk and later in the evening the place transforms. When the weather is good and it attracts large numbers of people. The lighting onto the structures and plants is a sight to behold. They also at various times run different themes and the other exhibits, also take on a different view with all the specialised lighting."
,,An amazing and unusual structure and display.,5.0,,A must see when visiting Singapore. Beautiful serene environment. Access to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest is also part of this area.
,,A must to see,5.0,,This is an amazing park to visit. You must go at night for the laser light show. If you have time to queue you could also to the tree top walk. The light and music show is wonderful. I have never seen anything like it. I fact we returned for a second visit a couple of days later. This is a must for all the family.
,,Wonderful free show,5.0,,Arrive at the Gardens of the Bay late in the day so you are here for the 7:45PM free super Tree light and music show. After the show take the bridge over the dragon fly pond and enjoy the beautiful views and picture photo opportunities on your way to Marina Bay Sands complex for their free laser and light show at 9:30PM. Their show is even better than the super tree show. Just sit on the steps on the waterfront and enjoy the show. Excellent pizza at Mozza restaurant on level B1. They are open until 11:00PM where many of the restaurants are closing at 10:00PM
,,Enchanting,5.0,,Didnt go for the Sky Walk as you need to pay $8 per entry. But walking around the Supertree itself is captivating enough. Beautiful display. They have the Lantern Festival display during my visit.
,,Gardens Rhapsody at Supertree Grove,5.0,,"Went there for Gardens Rhapsody, the experience was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!

My recommendation would be to arrive there early before show time (7.45 pm. and 8.45 pm. daily) and find yourself a spot among the Supertree Grove. I was lying there under one of trees with quite full view of the Supertree spending time with my husband watching the light show with Jazz hits was a really nice romantic experience. I'm definitely going back."
,,Nightly light show a must see,4.0,,"It is free to enter these gardens. We went early evening and wandered around until the sun was setting. There are two shows per night of the lights and music. We decided to skip the first show and have dinner at one of the many options. There is a huge food court with about 8 restaurants to choose from, there is also a ""Food Street"" that has stall where you can buy food and go and sit on the grass to eat it.
There is a large grassed area to the edge of the Supertrees. We found this to be the best spot. Lay down on the grass and enjoy the music and light show that sparkles up and down these magical metal trees - colours, rhythm and music all combined - and all free!"
,,Night time at Supertree Grove,5.0,,We went there at night time. The park is beautiful planned and is a great place for night out and getaway from the city buzz.
,,"Pretty, but better from the distance",3.0,,I felt the area was too crowded and not much to do. The overall look is cool especially from the distance. Did not try the the bridge as the line was extremely long.
,,Great free event nightly,4.0,,Go along to hear and see the trees. Every night its free. Lay on the floor to experience it at its best.
,,Lovely,5.0,,This was a lovely place we visited on our last afternoon. So glad we did not miss it. Please take the time to see
,,Singapore Odyssey.,4.0,,We found this park fascinating on a number of levels.They are trying to make the park and gardens self sustainable.The groves are one part of this experiment.The gardens/restaurant are definitely worth a couple of hours.Access easily arranged by taxi
,,Great View over Gardens by the bay,5.0,,"This is a really great viepoint if you visit Gardens by the bay ! Price of S$ 8 per person is worth it.

But take care: It's a one way walking way, you go down the other tower and they take care that nobody walks around several times."
,,Amazing structures and light shows! Free admission.,5.0,,Fantastic supertrees with light and sound shows each night. The theme changes nightly and is awesome to view and experience for all ages. Go up the centre supertree to access the bridges for an awesome view of the surroundings. Inspired structures.
,,Best part of our trip,5.0,,"Amazing light show, extraordinary structures and good for all to see. If you can take in one of the tree light shows, do, so well worth it."
,,Mesmerizing,5.0,,I love the blue lights at night-- made me feel I was out in space with benevolent humongous intelligent forms.
,,One of the new symbols of Singapore.,5.0,,"We went 3 times and absolutely adored this place. A real symbol of Singapore! Here's some advice to help you plan.

1) The evenings can get packed for the light shows at 7:45 and 8:45, so get there 20-30 mins early for a seat. The show is about 15 minutes. if you want to view it from the OCBC walkway you need to get there even earlier.

2) The gardens are free to walk around and marvel at. During the day is less busy. But remember its hot hot hot!

3) You can pay to go into the 'domes'. Each one has an entrance fee. I thought the Cloud Forest with the waterfall was more interesting than the Flower dome. Sometimes they close one or the other for maintenance so check first.

4) The walkway above the main Supertree Grove is worth it for $8 and even though they say you only have 15 minutes, if you go early or during the day, no one will be there to rush you. At night show time it is packed.

5) Don't miss the view of the gardens from the Ce Le Vie restaurant on top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. See my other review for details.

Enjoy!"
,,Another must see in Singapore,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove are man made structures that the plants grow on forming a very large tree. you can walk around the tops of the trees via a walkway that you pay about $8, the views are fabulous and there is a good breeze up there.
Definatly worth doing."
,,Science fiction setting,5.0,,The Supertrees are a collection of iron frame structures with plants growing on them. The largest is sixteen stories tall and holds a restaurant and roof top bar. Three of them are linked by a sky bridge. At night they are illuminated by thousands of LED light in a show synchronized to music. Well worh seeing.
,,Nain and giants...,4.0,,"A time for a little break ? Go directly to the supertrees forest. Not so far from the Marina and the Waterfront promenade... Your're like a nain with the giants... A quiet place, a nice Green trip for enjoying another face of Singapor"
,,Incredible Gardens with Spectacular Towers!,5.0,,"This was one of the highlights of our visit to Singapore. Not only this Grove but other fantastic buildings with breathtaking gardens inside too! The Supertree Grove has an elevator that takes you up to the walkway that you can walk across the netire area from several stories above the ground. Along the way there are great views of the harbor and the Marina Sands hotel/casino complex. At the end of the walkway, another elevator is available to take you back down. At night, the towers are illuminated with color changing lights."
,,Interesting for a few minutes,3.0,,"These fake trees are fascinating and in many ways symbolic of Singapore's carefully crafted vision of itself as a modern 'garden' city. During the day the 'supertrees' don't provide much shade or anything really of interest unless you pay to go up to the walk way, in which case you have something of a view.
At night there are regular light and sound shows which are suprisingly good. The show isn't excessively long and the lights and music coordinate very well, making it much better than some other 'laser and light' shows in Singapore.
I wouldn't make a special trip to go to Supertree Grove but if you are in Gardens by the Bay, particularly in the evening (around 8pm I think is the first 'show') then it's worth a visit."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Good value for money. The kind of place most people can enjoy due to the views and as it is part of several attractions nearby. Avoid if you have vertigo or are not a fan of heights.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Worth the fee to go to the top and walk around if you don't mind heights! Really nice to just walk around and take these amazing designs all in.
,,Magical trees,5.0,,Gardens are free to enter and there's a light show at the Tree groves; which is not to be missed. The light show is magical and happens at 8pm everyday (I think - we went on Sunday). The bridge between the Tree Groves; you can walk through them and enjoy the views. We didn't go on them as the queue was very long and also because pushchair wasn't allowed up there. Over all they are beautiful.
,,Amazing lighting,4.0,,"Came visit in the evening, a bit crowded but really had a great time with my family. The lighting is especially amazing."
,,Lovely and fun,5.0,,"A part of Gardens by the bay, an artificial exhibit and light show (twice each evening). Even though it may seem tacky it actually proves to be fun and very entertaining, kinda dreamy and relaxing with the lightshow aligned with music. Try not to place yourself directly below the trees, where it's crowded and a noisy, but find a quiet place on nearby above spots (in the garden area). You'll get a much better view and experience."
,,Awesome Super Trees,5.0,,"The Supertrees are hopelessly stunning and for anyone who wants nice pics to add to their Singapore visit, this Supertree Grove is hard to beat. Having said that, it's preferable to visit at dusk when the aperture opens just enough to let in the fading blue skies and the orange clouds without the use of flash , needless to say, people look so much better in the pics without a pale face and so people generally will be happy with the pics and that means no touch up needed. (LOL)
When it is night time, the Supertrees all light up to changing colours and they are extremely amazing, dazzling and exceptionally impressive.
Thumbs up to this brilliant spot , not just for tourists but for anyone who appreciates good taste, chic design and a slice of nature in the heart of the vibrant city."
,,From out of this world,5.0,,Talk about a sci-fi movie this place is rocking it! It's not too crowded so you can get a good seat and watch the different lights light up and change colors and it's just it's really wonderful I love it here. I really feel like I'm in the future or like in some sci-fi movie it's very unique and very artsy.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"They are like a cross between something from The Day of the Triffids and The War of the Worlds. The supertrees are quite unique in my experience. We took a short tour round them and the gardens to learn more about them, and also saw the wonderful nightly light and sound show. Whatever else you do in Singapore, don't miss this."
,,Free attraction!,5.0,,"7:45 an d 8:45 on a daily basis, one can see the light show. Just go to the garden and find a good spot on the lawn to enjoy this free show."
,,Awesome at night.,4.0,,Beautifully kept gardens a truly unique experience and stunning at night. Well lit up and plenty of paths offers a great view of Marina bay sands. We finished with a nice stroll along the lake getting a nice view of the Singapore flyer.
,,Pleasant and free,5.0,,"Supertree grove is a part of the gardens by the bay. It is open 24hours and free to enter and spend as long as you like walking around. This is a really nice area, with various sections of garden dedicated to countries / regions. In the evening there is a light display on the trees which was well planned when I saw it. There are various stalls etc for souvenirs. Definitely worth giving this area a bit of time to get away from the city."
,,Spectacular light show,5.0,,Have not actually been up the trees as yet ($$$) but the free twice nightly light show is a MUST see. The Singaporeans know how to put on a show!
,,Trip away with my mum.,5.0,,It was a great light show and the band was very good as well. The show starts on time so make sure you're there for 7.45pm.
,,Fantastic! What a trippy and beautiful garden day or night!!,5.0,,Make sure you drink lots of water if you're wandering about for hours! (Don't forget your camera- you will kick yourself!
,,Excellent show!,5.0,,"Be sure to arrive before the show starts. There are 2 shows, 7.45pm and 8.45pm. Just pick a spot and lay down and see the magnificent lights and great music. It's free and you can get there via MRT, stop at Bayfront and walk towards Gardens by the bay. You will see signages to get to the 'Supertree Grove'."
,,Good views from the super trees,5.0,,We climbed up the super tree view point and saw the spectacular views of the city. Definitely recommend this experience to anyone who is visiting singapore.
,,Magnificient,5.0,,"Never seen anything like this anywhere. Although seems very simple from afar, the beauty is when they play the lights with music. Reach there between 6-8PM that is when it is mostly crowded, find a spot & lay down with some snacks and food. Enjoy the show.
Its breathtaking & free. The train stations are close by and you can just walk right upto it. You need 5$ if you want to go up and walk btwn the trees, not a mandate though"
,,awesome view,5.0,,"We waited for 30 minutes to get to the elevator to go up the walkway, but it was no big deal. Once there, the view was magnificent. Along 2/3 of the section, the walkway became a bit narrow and with people constantly walking around, there was a bit of a movement which may scare someone who is afraid of height. But the view was worth it, Marina Bay Sands, the city skyline, the other super trees. We went up near dusk and stayed there until the supertree lit up, which was pretty awesome."
,,Exhilarating night time light show,5.0,,"We went to the light show at the Supertree Grove in the gardens by the Bay. It was enchanting. The trees lit up against the backdrop of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The designs and light patterns were excellent. The trees themselves are a magnificent sight both in the day and night time.
We took a train to the Bayfront MRT and walked across a bridge to the gardens. It was all well sign posted.
Not to be missed."
,,Fun place to take in all of Gardens by the Bay. Just plain fun!,5.0,,"My wife and I heard that the Supertree Grove was fun and interesting, but, until you actually go up and wander, you just don't know how much fun it really it, or what a wonderful view you get of the entire Garden. The queue to get into the Grove was short, the price was reasonable and we had a blast! I think the best part was being able to look down at all the various different plants, both on the ground and on the ""Trees"" themselves.It may look a little odd, but it really is cool!"
,,stunning,5.0,,"super tree grove is absolutely stunning during the day but at night it truly becomes amazing with beautiful coloured lights and music , amazing from near and far. get your camera out and just keep taking photos ."
,,Extend your stay until the evening,5.0,,"It can be extremely hot and humid in the morning and noon time.Better visit this place in the afternoon, until the evening.

This attraction is really breathtaking. It is hard to fathom how this place was conceived. It somehow feels alien like in appearance yet, so beautiful.

I would say the best part of the Supertree Grove is during the evening when the lights are blinking and they have a long show of musical and dancing lights.

You can literally lie down and just admire the view."
,,First time with friends,4.0,,"First time we were here and also with friends. You can actually sit outside with fantastic views over Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands hotel. Or you could have drinks first outside and eat inside like we did. Conclusion is that it's a place we might go back to, especially if you have visitors over. The food was very nice, the cocktails were a little disappointing, but overall the experience was very nice. Helpful staff too. So something to recommend."
,,fun spending time at skywalk....,5.0,,it was great going and spending time at the sky-walk...very well designed and very safe to walk...some people might find it uncomfortable though...Food court at the ground floor had good variety.
,,speechless,5.0,,i can't describe this place.. you MUST visit this place.. you can't describe how beautiful this place in word!
,,Almost Beyond Belief,4.0,,"The Supertrees are concrete and steel structures that rise 25 to 50 meters above Singapore's Gardens by the Bay.

They are covered with more than 160,000 plants, flowers, bromeliads and vines, of more than 200 varieties, creating the effect of a living tree.

The branches at the top are set with myriad lights and at night a spectacular light show is performed free of charge - lay back on the manicured lawns underneath a tower. And just look up. It is spectacular.

Twelve of the Supertrees are in The Grove and another six are scattered around Gardens at the Bay."
,,Sensational,5.0,,Amazing and very pretty from afar. At night when we watch it from the sky lounge of the peninsula excelsior hotel the lit super grove trees were immensely beautiful.
,,amazing!,5.0,,so interesting place and show!it is so super and out of any imagination!must see at night and view so much colours!
,,Something from the future,5.0,,Literally looks space age. Very very impressive structure that is a great sight. Seems like you are on another planet. Must see
,,Fabulous light show...do not miss!!!,5.0,,"Walked in here last night, and unless you go into one of the domes (as we did earlier...) the gardens were free. Fantastic light shows, access to skywalk at additional cost, but we spent an hour here relishing the lighting and atmosphere for the princely sum of diddly squat. What's not to like?!!"
,,Incredible by day and stunning by night,4.0,,Well worth a visit - the structures are immense and the lighting at night is incredible. We didn't go up the walkway - don't like heights - but lots to see at ground level.
,,Very nice spot,5.0,,"A great place to visit, free of charge if you're not taking the lift to the upper deck of the OCBC skyway.

The trees are already beautiful during the day time but even better at night as their color is changing and gives the place a mystical character."
,,High Up,4.0,,"Great view for a few SGD, thought is costs SGD 8 per entry. From there you have a great view, so you should try to have a go when you are in the Marina Bay Area."
,,Short business trip,5.0,,"Anytime that you go to Singapore you have to make a stop at the SuperTree Groove. They are just beautiful, a phenomenal structures. At night they do a light show with music--you CANT miss it!! Its soo beautiful, you can walk around, there are several restaurants. Be ready for the heat, take a bottle of water and wear sun block for sureee!!!"
,,Functional yet a work of art,5.0,,These magnificent structures are the heat exchangers for the conservatories. The Super Trees are majestic and a work of art in their own right. They are of British conception and design. The sky walk provides a fabulous birds eye view of the gardens. One of the super trees even has a restaurant and bar at the top from which the views are truly spectacular. Though the free beer they offer to you is not worth drinking. As the gardens mature vegetation is covering the super trees to provide natural greenery to beautiful and functional man made structures.
,,Walkways in the sky,5.0,,"It was a little nerve-wracking to be walking on the walkways but the view is beautiful from up there so it's worth the jitters. At any rate, there is a time limit for staying up there - just 15 minutes. But perhaps, 15 minutes is enough to make your heart beat fast enough."
,,The best things in life are free!,5.0,,"It's space age, it's natural, it's vivid, it's kaleidoscopic , it's weird and wonderful by day and enchanting by night.

This experience will appeal to all ages in your travel party.

Singapore sings through the artistry and wonder of these structures.

Open from 5 am to 2pm and it's FREE!!!!!

Note: Visit in the afternoon and watch the beauty take place as the sun goes down and night falls."
,,Light and Sound Show,5.0,,A must see at night for the Light and Sound Show. We did it as part of a tour and thought the whole evening was memorable.
,,Stunning gardens,5.0,,This is great by day and night. I fully reccommend paying the S$8 to do the walk across the tree top walkway.
,,Great sound and light chow,5.0,,Fantastic futuristic architecture and open public space. The light and sound show at night is simply awe-inspiring.
,,Good place to visit,4.0,,Family had enjoyed the site seeing and taken lovely pic`s. Singapore is an ideal place made for tourist.
,,THE BEST FREE SINGAPORE ACTIVITY,5.0,,"This is just beautiful, we love love love it. The best way to experience this attraction is to make an afternoon of it, either stroll thru the gardens then got a visit the two man made domes - cloud dome and flower dome. Or those with little ones go to the children's garden playground - be sure to bring bathers for the water play area. Then stroll to Satay by the bay for dinner before strolling back to the Super tree Grove for the light/sound shows at either 7:45 or 8:45 (DAILY)."
,,Free and beautiful,5.0,,"Free to walk around. There is a small walkway that you can pay to go up to, good for photos. Very pretty and at night it is lit up and has a light and music show. Beautiful."
,,Attractive high level walkway,4.0,,"The towers are gradually being taken over by plants and will look really interesting when you can no longer see the metal of the structures. The walkway is nice and solid, so acrophobia should not be a problem....."
,,Part of the Gardens by the Bay -- A must see,5.0,,The walkway is not for those with a fear of heights. A great place. The walkway to the Marina Sands was not well marked but found it eventually. Well worth the money!
,,Great Place,5.0,,"I love the lights at the supertree grove ! It's very great things that i've ever seen ! If you can lay in the floor to see, do it. It's recommended. You will find the wonderful light !"
,,Must see,5.0,,Just stunning. Missed the night show due to storm but went back for the skywalk. Such a great place to visit in Singapore.
,,Nice Skywalk,2.0,,You can avoid this Skywalk if you had done Singapore Flyer. It is just that they take you at a height and leave you there for sometime. You can do away with this attraction and we found it as a waist of money.
,,Fantastic Light Show,5.0,,"Whenever we have guests over one of the things which we always do with them is take them to the light show at the Super Trees. The light show is out of this world, and there is almost always a theme. One time is was Disney. Another time we went for Christmas and all the songs were Christmas carols. Most recently the theme was Asia and they did a songs from different Asian languages. The show starts around 8:30 and takes 20-30 minutes. Getting there early is a good idea if you want a seat because it fills up fast. I would definitely recommend this."
,,"Green park, hot temperatures",3.0,,"It's a Green park but hot temperatures because it's tropical outdoor park. You should bring a hat to protect your hair and head. For children visitor, you should have an umbrella I think."
,,Night Show is a necessity,5.0,,Search up what time the music and light show starts at the GBB website and add it to your itinerary. This sight and experience is free and refreshes your mind and thoughts ~
,,Day and Night Attraction,5.0,,"The grove is very interesting, with plants and greenery growing rapidly up these super structures. Very impressive and should be seen during the day and then also for the light show in the evening. Free to walk round at any time. The sky walk is not free and due to height issues we have not tried it yet. Will next time! You could spend many hours walking around the free gardens area, but pay for the Flower dome and Cloud. Both worth it."
,,Amazing,5.0,,This is a marvellous creation and looks gorgeous in the night. A must see attraction in Singapore which many tourists tend to miss
,,Do not pay!,3.0,,"The supertree grove is very impressive arrangement of man made tree structures with actual greenery growing on the exterior. It forms part of the gardens by the bay attraction. It is free to visit and look at, however there is a charge if you want to walk through the canopy of the grove via a raised walkway.

Having done the latter, I would advise that you just do the free walk and save your money for the cloud forest, a far more enjoyable and enriching experience. The paid walkway is very short and the views are more impressive from marina bay sands or the Singapore flyer."
,,"Great gardens, trees are ok too",3.0,,"The gardens are done really nicely, with a huge diversity of flora, which is pretty amazing considering the last time I was in Singapore, in 2005, it was just a bare construction site! The super-trees are big and impressive, but I preferred the natural vegetation more.

At night, the super-trees light up in sync with a ""rhapsody"" of oldies-but-goodies pop hits.I thought it was just ok, but the gardens are worth a return trip. Both the gardens and the super-tree light/music show are free and it's fun to spend an afternoon and evening here."
,,AMAZING,5.0,,"Went out at night to see, and hear, the Lights and Sounds Show. An absolutely amazing show that would appeal to everyone"
,,Great day and night,5.0,,You need to come in the daylight and get a good look around the gardens which are free. You need to pay to go on the skywalk in the super trees. Also you need to come at night to see the light show
,,Supertree,5.0,,"We walked along the super tree grove on the first morning in Singapore. Fantastics views and a good place to start and get your bearing of the city. Didn't take long to walk took heaps of photos, we went for an evening cruise and it looked lovely at night, this would be lovely walk to do at night we did during the day early before it go to hot!"
,,Night light show is amazing,5.0,,"We went as a family for the 7.30 light show. There was a lot of people and I would say if you have small children to keep an eye on them as you spend all your time looking up at the trees and not your kids who may wander in the dark.
The tress light up and move to the chosen soundtrack, ours was retro pop. Everyone was dancing or foot tapping to 80s classics, I would highly recommend it. Both for day or night visit, best of all it's FREE."
,,Over hyped,3.0,,The supertree grove and the night show are a tad overhyped and we found rest of the Gardens far more interesting. Would skip this the next time round.
,,Do the Sky Walk,4.0,,"The ground level access here is free, but not terribly interesting. Take the sky walk elevator for a small charge and spend 15 minutes in the air with great views."
,,I never went as I thought it was a theme park - it is much better,5.0,,"I had seen it at a distance and thought it a kind of kids theme park but it is much more. Yes, the big tree light show is good, but better is the indoor botanic garden and the wonderful tree top walk around the tropical forest. A real Experience."
,,One of 3 must see unique attractions within Garden by the Bay......,5.0,,"This Supertree Grove is one of 3 very ""unique"" attractions within Garden by the Bay. And it would be best viewed at night rather than day - due to the amazing effects of the night lightings & the cooler night weather.

To enjoy the best of all 3 attractions on the same day, we planned a mid-afternoon visit for both Cloud Forest & Flower Dome ( about 3 hours in total).

After which, we had a short dinner & proceed for a beautiful night experience of the Supertrees."
,,Top of the world feeling,5.0,,"Don't go up the Super Trees if you suffer from vertigo. Otherwise, take the Sky Bridge and enjoy glorious views of various spots in the Gardens by the Bay! There's even a treetop restaurant here. I can't eat there though as it doesn't serve halal food. Nevertheless, so many photo opportunities here. Great for capturing precious memories in a memorable location in the GBP."
,,Beautiful!!!,5.0,,"Had never seen anything like it. The sound and lights show is a must watch.

Best time to visit - Evening. They have two shows between 7:45 and 8:45 and it was a treat to watch. We also took the walk on the skydeck and it presented a beautiful view of the whole Gardens by the Bay along with the beautifully lit Marina Bay Sands Skypark and Flyer"
,,A Must See.,5.0,,"This place is beautiful, but if you can come in the evening and even better if you are able to catch the light show at 19.45 everyday. Is really is amazing. This is my second time here first was during the day which i find kinda boring but the night session totally won me over. I would go back again!"
,,Supertree Grove,5.0,,Loved this by day & night. So colourful & a must see for 1st time visitors to Singapore. I have visited twice.
,,An Electricians Delight,5.0,,The display we saw started at 7.45pm and lasted about 45 minutes and amazed a huge crowd of ecstatic viewers. Bonnie coloured lights flashed and danced to some very appropriate music. Brilliant!
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,I have visited here more than a dozen times I have been in Singapore. For me it is the highlight for visitors when traveling to Singapore
,,Excellent night show,5.0,,We visited the supertree grove while visiting the gardens in the day and night. We went to the top of the walkway in daytime and watched the Gardens Rhapsody at night from underneath which was spectacular
,,Blue Hour Photography,5.0,,"If you want to take some fantastic pictures go at the blue hour, photographers will know what I'm talking about. They put on a light/music show just after dusk, neat to see."
,,A walk in the park,4.0,,The Supertree Grove is an easy enjoyable walk through lovely gardens. A nice way to spend a couple of hours
,,Beautiful at night,5.0,,"Fantastic free activity, make sure you visit one of the free twice nightly light shows... Amazing! Just arrive early as the gardens tend to fill up with bothl locals and visitors, grab a spot and enjoy the show lasts fir 15 mins."
,,Like another planet,4.0,,"I must say I was a bit disappointed when I realised that the marina is basically a succession of expensive malls. However, the gardens are amazing. The tree top walk is worth the price, even though it is short."
,,Beautiful view but rude staff,3.0,,"The place itself is beatiful and the view is also fine.

However the setting is disturbed by staff trying to keep a constant flow by telling everyone to walk ahead. This is annoying as 90 percent of the visitors tried to walk but were blocked by a few who did not move at all and which the staff could not reach. Maybe the system for pushing people ahead should be rethought?

The walkway is closed during rain or storms."
,,A blessing to man kind,5.0,,"A man made blessing to man kind, a tree that sends oxygen into the air we breathe.Do watch the movie before visiting the tree otherwise will be difficult to understand."
,,Stunning,5.0,,Worth a visit here the supertrees are amazing especially at night when they light up. The two Domes are also at this place.
,,A fun spin to your standard garden,5.0,,"Let me start off by saying, Singapore did not disappoint me. This was on my list of ""must sees"", for obvious reasons, and I'm glad I went.

You have to go at night to get the full impact for the trees. They light up and change colors as music plays and they work in sync with one another. You can take an elevator to the top of one of the trees and walk across a bridge that is suspended between another tree. I'm really scared of heights but had to do this and glad I did. The view from the top was beautiful. Oh, and there's a restaurant at the top of one of the trees but you need reservations.

The rest of the garden is pretty and has a lot of exhibits, but the trees are the main draw."
,,Sound and lights at night,5.0,,Was not sure of what to expect but we had a wonderful time at night watching the sound and light show. Wear comfortable shoes... plenty of walking to do
,,Shapes,4.0,,Plans are guided by structures with weird shapes and thus generates nice patterns. Inside the park everything it is quite expensive but you can just go for a walk.
,,An amazing Experiance,5.0,,"This is a all day experience, plan your trip such that when you finish flower dome and tired, land here by dusk to enjoy light and sound show on its lawns. Take a small nap and recharge your batter and senses for Singapore nightlife."
,,Day or night its a wonderful destination,5.0,,"Huge parkland with various garden areas , even a children's water park. Free to wander around. Charge $8 for the tree skywalk . A lovely place for families to explore. Wheelchair access, toilets, and option of a paid shuttle bus when tired or for the elderly. Many food options from fine dining cafes to Macdonalds and the Childrens cafe. Many sculptures including a giant floating baby. Water features . A city escape. Easy access by bus, taxi, train. Take the Camera."
,,Surreal Parkland,5.0,,Unique park with many shaded walk areas and themed gardens. The Supertree Grove feels surreal - admission required only if you want to walk along the bridge that joins the tree tops.
,,Must visit in Singapore,4.0,,"Part of Gardens by the Bay, the Super Trees are much more than decorative structures. Must visit in Singapore."
,,Science fiction at night,4.0,,"I didn't go into, that's why I don't give it the 5 score, because I can't be honest about that experience. I solely went for a walk and it's worth.
I recommend to go at night when they switch on the lights and it looks like straight out of as a fiction tale."
,,A must do,5.0,,Time your visit at two times: both during the day to wander around and at night when the lights come on with music (7.45pm and 8.45pm). It is delightful and beautiful. Get there early because there are lots of people wandering in the same direction. Not too crowded when it starts. Good observation points possible. Don't bother to pay for the skywalk because you actually see more from ground level.
,,Very futuristic,5.0,,The trees are in an amazing botanic garden which comes alive at night. The fact that they are also have ecological credentials make them particularly special. I don't recall seeing anything close to these anywhere else in the world.
,,IT WORTH THE LOOK,4.0,,If you don't like heights don't do it because its very high. but if you do you wont regret it at all. They do it well in Singapore
,,Excellent musical light show every night,5.0,,"In the day time, you can walk on the OCBC Skyway for a better view of the gardens from above. At night, watch the musical light show, on at 7.45pm and 8.45pm daily."
,,Botanic Garden,5.0,,"Stunning, especially at night. It is part of the Gardens by the bay attraction and it is a must see for the international visitor."
,,"""amazing trees""",4.0,,Huge structures. Very beautiful at night with those lights. Amazing view. Try to find a good spot to take photo.
,,Colorful and educational,5.0,,"The supertrees are quite educational with the plaques surrounding them, and I was really interested in learning more about why they were shaped and made the way they were along with the greenhouses. I also had a great time watching the light show the supertrees put on around 7:45 PM on a Wednesday night. Right afterward, we went to see the other show on the other side of the Marina Sands Bay Mall at 8:00 PM. :)"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Had seen the pics online and in brochures earlier, but was still totally in awe of these magnificent structures. Very impressive in the early evening and after sunset, and also free of charge if not heading up to the do the tree top walk. Highly recommend."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Fantastic. Treetop walk has great views. Will be brilliant to see super trees fully covered in ten years time. Well worthwhile
,,colourful,4.0,,"this is where you can see lights and music mixed together, it makes a music while lights dance to the tune. nice and colorful especially at night."
,,A must in Singapore,5.0,,"Just do it .. And pay the extra to go on the skywalk, the view is fantastic . The light show of an evening is also spectacular. This is a testament to the Singapore governments foresight in allowing amazing architecture to flourish in this amazing city."
,,Fascinating Trees,5.0,,Great attraction especially at night but I'm not sure I would go back in the evening to see it up close as it could be seen from our hotel room. Very creative and innovative.
,,loved them,5.0,,we waited half an hour for our turn on the skywalk and was timely on the walk when the light show started. That is something i will always remember. amazing
,,impressive!,4.0,,"Those huge articifial and colored trees reminded me the big ""Tree of Life""of the last EXPO exhibition in Milan. Here you have 5 or 6 of these trees, and the effect was amazing. Very nice, really"
,,SUPERB!!!,5.0,,"All I have to say is that Singapore has got the ways to make you think about the brilliance of their creativity, a must visit, dont miss the light and sound show."
,,Energy and ecology,4.0,,The concept of vertical planting and the solar power panels is unique and creditable. The plants on the trees are still growing - when it is fully covered it will be quite something.
,,Loved The Grove,5.0,,Great atmosphere created in the Gardens by the Bay. The trees are impressive especially when accompanied by the nightly music.
,,Fun,5.0,,"Amazing light show, had never seen anything like it. The music was back to the 1970's and forward , fun to listen to for my older generation."
,,Very special,4.0,,"It looks a bit like a part from a Disney Theme park but it is quite beautiful, especially at night. The light show does not really add something and the music is beyond tacky but seeing the trees change colors is a very nice experience. It is easily reached by taxi or public transport and there a few good food options around as well"
,,See it at night and you will catch a nice show.,4.0,,The light show they present every night is worthwhile of your time. Classical music with lights spreading to all the supertrees in the area make for an entertaining time with a great gran finale.
,,Wow,5.0,,Hey been to this place in the evening had wonderful show do not miss that if you are roaming specially in the evening
,,The Future,5.0,,Science fiction becomes science reality.Super modern and cutting edge.Another great Singapore attraction which can't be missed.
,,Amazing structures,4.0,,"We absolutely loved the Super Trees, spend some time to read on how they work and harvest water, they are completely self-powered. We spent the extra money to do the Skywalk which our 12 year old son loved and then took the opportunity to head up the top of the largest Super Tree for a drink overlooking the city on the rooftop bar, a lovely way to relax after 3 hours exploring the Gardens."
,,Only in Singapore,5.0,,"These Supertrees are an amazing feat of engineering, botanical expertise and originality. Photos do not do them justice. The skywalk between them gives a full view of the gardens below - and the city. there is also a gourmet restaurant at the top of the tallest ""tree"". The evening sound and light show is a must-see."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Trees are erected with many plant species and stand tall with different looks during the day and when nighttime falls, the reflections casted onto pond is remarkably beautiful. Must visit if you're in Singapore. Do visit both flower and cloud domes. Pack water, cap and brolly. Remember to change into comfortable walking shoes. Food eateries are available nearby too. Overall a must visit attraction! I'm truely thankful!"
,,Special Place in Singapore,5.0,,"there are two time periods to enjoy this place. First is in the evening to see the whole place and the other is after dark to enjoy the Light Show. The first show is @ 7:45 and the other one is @ 8.45. both shows lasts for about 12-13 minutes and are mesmerising. This is NOT TO BE MISSED place in Singapore and above all is free. if you want to climb up the Super-tree , it is chargeable though.
come about half an hour early to secure your best view point in the show area as it can get quite jam packed."
,,Must visit!,5.0,,This is probably one of the best things we've seen from the Gardens by the bay. Must visit at night!!

,,Simply wow!,5.0,,"Visit to the super grove is a must while at Gardens by the bay, it's a different experience whether by day or night. Worth a visit at both the times specially at night when it's illuminated you are just dumbstruck by its architecture and beauty. And the sound and light show is just awesome. Find a nice spot to sit and enjoy the spectacle which unfurls. Before or after the show do try and visit the walkway above. It a different sort of experience to be there and see the city below. Simply too good."
,,Free light show,5.0,,- free light and sound show at 7.45 pm daily - had to lined up to go walk on the super tree glove - not good for those who doesn't like height - nice view and breeze in the night time
,,Visit from Australia,5.0,,"My husband & I visited the park in 2012 when it first opened. Now again a few days ago with our family from Dubai. Magnificent, allow around 4 hours to see most of it & of course lunch in one of the restaurants.The sky walk over the top is a must do. Views are spectacular &of course great for photographers.The children loved the water park & spent much time there. You would never tire of Gardens by the Bay."
,,alien worlds!,5.0,,Have you every played the game Myst or Riven? this place makes you feel like walking through those games. with soft music playing and the strange lights illuminating the super trees. it is a beautiful walk and you will come back again.
,,A great work in progress,5.0,,"Supertree Grove is situated in a lovely green part of Singapore. Whilst most of the garden walking is free, it is worth the $8 to walk the single walkway between 2 of the Supertrees. A short walk to the domes. Well worth it."
,,Add this to your list,5.0,,"I went along because my friends suggested it, I was thinking hmmmm... I am so glad I went!!!! What an amazing way to spend an evening! Take your camera but don't get distracted by it. A great opportunity to hold hands with a loved one or pick the kids up and share the wonder of the sheer size plus sound and light choreography of this place, it's great during the day but definitely go for the evening show!"
,,Stopover,5.0,,Absolutely amazing and beautiful not expensive and is a great family evening the lights and music were wow
,,"Simply ""wow""",5.0,,This is a must if you visit Singapore. Especially at night. Wait for the right time (7.45pm when we were there) and let the magic begin.
,,Avatar,4.0,,"The supertrees really look like the ones from the movie, Avatar. The light show was also good to watch plus it's free."
,,Don't miss the night show.,5.0,,"The Supertrees are majestic in the daytime but they transform into something more beautiful at night. With the trees lit up in different colors, it's just a sight to behold. Don't forget tl visit at night, at about 7.30p for the light show. You can lie down and just enjoy the music and the lights. There is no admission fee so this is a perfect place to go to for travellers on a budget."
,,Interesting and entertaining,5.0,,Make sure you you visit during one of the shows as it is visually stunning and fun. There is heaps of dinner options and parking.
,,Amazing Display of Lights and Music,5.0,,In the evening times there is a light and music show...this is a must visit and a must see...it was just awesome...one of those places which you must avoid taking a video as the sight with the eye is just awesome!!
,,Imaginative park,5.0,,Whether you visit during the day or in the evening when dramatic lighting adds to the display this is one site not to miss on a trip to Singapore. The change over the years as the planting has matured has made this a fabulous experience and it will only improve with time.
,,Be there for the free night show,4.0,,"we went there at night time, and there are lots of people waiting for the lights show. You can sit on t he ground and enjoy the show."
,,A Must See in Singapore,5.0,,Garden by the Bay is a must stop. You can spend at least half of the day there if you are a flower geek. We spent the hot sunny day inside the Flower Dome and walked around the garden in the evening before the 7:45 Light Show. It is so worth it to see the lights all lighted up from the Supertree.
,,So much to see,5.0,,The whole park is brilliant idea and executed to perfection. The sky-walk is a great way to end a visit to the garden complex. You can take in the whole city from this vantage point. Great photo opportunity.
,,Poetry on tree,4.0,,"One of truly iconic creations in the garden by the bay.
These structures have to be seen to be believed as the artistic creation cannot be described. They lend a surreal feeling to the garden as something which is so artificial but so alluring. The sky walk only available on ticket gives a great view of the garden and the marina bay sands plus the ocean and skyline featuring the Ferris wheel and some tall skyscrapers
745 to 845 is the light show when these things concert into magnificent creatures of beauty who almost talk to you on each change of light. Must be done for a relaxing Evening. Reach around 5 if u have tickets already , do flower dome and cloud forest and have a drink at user tree indo chine and get ready for light show"
,,nice view for the garden and Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"I would recommend to visit this place with your family, friends, or to have a romantic story to remember."
,,truly magnifique at night !,4.0,,"The trees should be viewed more so during the night with the change of colours, like an enchanted fairyland ! free views !

Above said, the trees or grove form only one small aspect of the gardens. there is much more to see elsewhere !

Given the high price of entry($20+) into the domes to see flora from all Eco climatic environment, it appeals to me but
more to visitors from tropics !"
,,Beautiful structures,5.0,,"Beautiful tree structures in Garden by the bay. This area is free for public for a stroll, but if you want to walk over the sky bridge in Supertree grove, you have to pay SG$ 5 per head.

The weather was humid in the day time. You can visit the Flower dome and Cloud forest nearby in the day time and come to the super tree grove in the evening and view the beautiful lighting of it."
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,Part of Gardens by the Bay. A must. Will become a world icon in the next several years...easily recognized.
,,Best lighting show ever,5.0,,super tree groove is like big tree which are planted in the center of garden by the bay. There is no charges for visiting and fro lighting show. I guess you can watch lighting show in evening only around 7:45-8 and 8:45-9:00 its a 15 min show. Its soothe my mind.
,,Amazing and breathtakingly beautiful,5.0,,A bit like something out of a Sci-Fi movie. But beautiful and enchanting. Kept wondering where the fairies were hiding.
,,Wow,5.0,,Stunning and so worth the cost of entry. Arrive early but stay for dark! Lots to look at and easy access.
,,Impressive at night,5.0,,Nice way to enjoy the Gardens by the Bay at night. Worth a trip over to that part of town in the evening as part of a dinner trip.
,,Truly exquisite,5.0,,This is amazing by day and a must see at night it is amazing. They have a light show each nigh to music it is fantastic. A must see by night.
,,Good but could be better,3.0,,"I think the whole design of Gardens by the Bay could be much better. It's a cheap version of the Eden Project, which was built 20 years ago!
The ""trees"" look quite interesting but quite messy in the forest type of surroundings. I feel quite uncomfortable with these messy structures when viewing the park from my balcony in the morning,
It costs S$ 8 to get up and walk 100 m of sky bridge, which I think a bit pricy."
,,Majestic View,5.0,,"If you're looking for some magnificent background for your selfies, being surrounded by these picturesque structures is the best option."
,,Fun!,5.0,,For a small fee you can take a lift up to this walkway and get great views of the gardens and the skyline. Only takes 15minutes to walk across the bridge then you take the lift back down again.
,,Watch SIngapore change from sunrise to sundown,4.0,,"A visit in the late afternoon is a must - check out the supertrees and head to the Indochine rooftop bar at sundown. Watch as the skyline changes. Great activity for both young and old. Then watch the supertrees come to live and ""dance"" at night."
,,Beautiful nighttime laser light show,4.0,,"The structures are huge and interesting. Once the vines are all grown into the the forms, these supertrees will be mesmerizing. We were there in the evening and got to watch the laser light show. The lights literally dance with the music! Great fun!!"
,,A must see in Singapore. Great views of the Bay,5.0,,Fascinating science project when most people would look at it as just a thing of beauty. Accolades to whoever came up with the idea to combine improving the air with a tourist destination.
,,One of the landmarks of the city,4.0,,Unfortunately the walkway was closed so we couldn't go up but the grove is interesting from the ground as well. Monumental design looks great from the distance and from up close. The trees light up with many colors at night.
,,So fun...go at night to see/hear the light show.,5.0,,"This free activity is really fun. Its a crazy light show with lights on the ""Super Trees"". Lasts about 20 minutes. Go early and have dinner at Satay by the Bay - where they have something for everyone, even picky kids. (This is way better than the 'free' light show in Hong Kong - don't miss it!)"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Such a beautiful area of space in Singapore. Spend a few hours wondering around the bidders to areas. Went back at night (7:45) and watched the light show. That was a big hit with my two children (aged 8 and 6).
,,Do the tree top walk for great views,4.0,,"For only $10 you can take the lift up to the top of these ""trees"" and walk along the suspended walkway which offers you great views of the city by day or night. Plenty of space to walk around and take loads of photographs as you walk from one tree to the next. There is also a restaurant there which you can access for the same price, and affords some great birds eye views at night for a meal and a drink on the terrace. You may need to book a seat ahead though for that."
,,Amazing trees.,5.0,,We visited the super grove to see the night time light show and again during the day. Seeing the trees and the gardens was one of my main reasons for a stopover in Singapore and they didn't disappoint. The walk between the trees gives great views of the gardens and a close look at the plants that are growing high up in the trees.
,,Lights,4.0,,"The light show is definitely worth seeing. Make sure you get there early and grab a place to sit. We were early and got a great seat. However, the staff working the bridge entrance kept trying to get us to move. There was no way I was going to give up our seats. They should have told us earlier before all the other spots were taken or put up signs so we would not sit there. Other than that, the light show is worth the wait, the music that night was disco but it was still quite lovely. They should play classical music"
,,Must see light show,5.0,,We saw the Supertree Grove at night and by day. The sky walk is great. Thoroughly recommend the light show at night best viewed lying down and looking up.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Mesmerising super trees, the tree top walk is incredible. The recycling system within each super tree is amazing."
,,Be Amazed,5.0,,amazing structure to be sighted during the day but superb to see during the night with the light show.
,,Amazing and Unique!,5.0,,"Only in Singapore, as far as I know, you can see such amazing structures! A must to see during the day and at night during the Light and Sound show! Do not miss this experience!"
,,"Fun, free show",5.0,,"Not far from the Sand Sky Rooftop, this is a fun thing to do. Walk through the parks direction Meadow and make a left turn on the bridge for a free light show in the evening, the first one being at 19:15"
,,Supporters are super!,5.0,,"This is such a fun place to visit, try to go during the day and then return at night to watch the light show. The views from the path between the trees is awesome. I was surprised by how few people were up there when we went. The light show at night is spectacular-- just lay back and watch the trees-- it really is an amazing show (and free btw!). This is a very family friendly attraction too-- plenty of space for the kids to run around!"
,,The Talking Trees,5.0,,"A great spectacle specially during the night. The plants around these super trees are really awesome. Once the lights are switched on, these trees come to life. The light and sound show (twice daily) are simply fantastic."
,,Unique,5.0,,"A great place to visit on a hot steamy day. We would have liked to have the elevated walk, but it was closed for another event. If you can check in advance."
,,Futuristic and very impressive,5.0,,"I visit the park everytime I come to Singapore. I gotta say that the Supertree Grove alongside the cloudforest are the two must see points in the park. The light show displayed each evening is breathtaking, and the design of the park makes you feel as if you're in Avatar's Pandora. Highly recommend, especially during the evening hours when the lights turn on."
,,Supertree Grove.,5.0,,This is a fantastic place to visit within The Gardens in The Bay. The structures are fully planted top to botom and have lights installed within. There is two Light and music shows in the evening which are world class and not to be missed. There is a Skyway walk around the top of the structures accessed by a lift for a cost and well worth it.
,,Greta Evening Location,5.0,,"Not much shade, so its very hot midday. Rooftop bar has a nice view and is tolerable in the evening after,sunset."
,,Supertrees are Fantastic,5.0,,"I had thought Gardens by the Bay and Supertrees were different names for pretty much the same attraction. Whatever the case, we loved walking through and under the Supertrees as night fell and the lights came on. It was all very beautiful to see and we enjoyed it very much."
,,Wonderland,5.0,,I felt like I am a hero or at least a fairy in the garden. It was unbelievable! Beautiful flovers and decorations on the supertree! Let me tell you you can go up to the crown and walk from one magic to another! Don't miss this out!
,,Great Moment,4.0,,"This is another great place in Singapore, you can see the AVATAR .. I think it started before AVATAR ?"
,,Dinner at IndoChine was Delish.,5.0,,"Just amazing to watch the greening of this awesome man made structure! The light show was fantastic. Eating dinner and watching the sunset, drinking G&Ts on the roof top of the biggest tree was truely awesome and well worth the money. The highlight of our day."
,,Night time spectacular,5.0,,Definitely worth the look. You pay for the walk above the grove. Go around late afternoon and stay for the night light show.Try to get a vantage point a little away and high so you can see all the trees light up at one time.
,,"A pleasant outdoor garden, better in the evening",4.0,,"This is another part of Gardens by the Bay, but these are free. They are futuristic man-made ""trees"" covered with various kinds of plants that will surely grow to cover more of the skeleton that currently provide scenic lighting inthe evening, when the cooler temperatures make this an even more pleasant way to spend a leaisurely few hours."
,,The best thing to do in Singapore,5.0,,"Having lived here for 2 years and been visiting for 15 this is still hands down my favourite thing to take people to here. I always build it up to be something amazing and no one has ever been disappointed. Go and enjoy the 'singing' at 7:45 or 8:45 you won't regret it.
Absolutely fabulous!"
,,Special place,4.0,,"What an interesting place, the trees are amazing, and wish I saw them at night. Take to cat walk, it is worth it."
,,Stay for the light show,5.0,,Awesome experience watching the light and sound show on a Sunday night. Although lots of people there the site is so big it didn't matter
,,"Beautifully laid out with variety of plants, flowers and ornamental structures.",5.0,,"Lovely area to walk, admiring the landscape, plant material and flowers, water-falls, etc.. Been twice , and will go again next time in Singapore."
,,"Astounding by day, better by night.",5.0,,"If you've seen the movie Avatar, you'll think that you've landed smack bang in the middle of it the moment you enter the Super Tree Grove.
These monumental structures are impressive and by paying a few dollars you can catch a lift to walk amongst them on the OCBC Skywalk, a suspended platform that weaves it's way between the trees. It's a great place for photos of the Singapore CBD as well as Gardens by the Bay.
If you can, visit the Supertree Grove at night when two free light shows set to music take place.
We were fortunate enough to be on the skywalk during the first one of the evening and to put it simply, it was beautiful. The dancing lights set to classical music was a sensory overload that I won't forget."
,,This is something different,5.0,,The Supertree grove is something really different . It is lovely lit up at night . Especially viewing from Marina Bay Sands.
,,Delightful,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove was really awesome! We paid for the skywalk and the view was great. I think there was a time limit, but we stayed for almost an hour up there. We also unexpectedly caught the light show. We were sitting on a lawn in front of the grove and were about the head out when the music started playing. It was quite delightful. The view was much better in the evening.

Also had good laksa at the food court by the grove."
,,A MUST SEE - See the show in the evening!,5.0,,"After dinner it was back to the Supertree Grove for the 8:45pm nightly music and light show. This is the second of two shows and it was the perfect way to end our day. Take a seat, or lay down on the ground as we did, and look up and enjoy the show. It’s beautifully orchestrated. It was my favorite thing we did in Singapore."
,,"A brilliant concept in the fab Gardens by the Bay, fast becoming an iconic image of Singapore.",5.0,,"These steel structures should be seen by day and again at night, when they are spectacularly illuminated in a sound and light show. The tallest tree has a restaurant and treetop bar and although you have to pay about £10 to go up in the lift, the price includes a drink and is worth every penny for the views of the city and the sea. There is also an aerial walkway between several of the trees...again you have to pay extra for this but it's worth it unless you are nervous of heights! The sound and light show is free and a good place to view is the viewing platform across the walkway from Shoppes/MBS"
,,Good Viewed at Night,4.0,,Better viewed in the evening when the lights are on the walkways and trees are all very nicely lite up
,,Nice light show,5.0,,A new and modern sightseeing place with solar energy panel on top of them. You can buy ticket to enter OCBC skyway to have view to the city. The light show is held twice per day at 19:45 and 20:45. You mayn't want to access OCBC skyway but don't miss the 15-minute light show. There is also restaurant on the supertree with nice view but the price is enough for you to enjoy quality buffet at Orchard.
,,Supertree Bar!,5.0,,"must seen in Singapore, especially in the evening with the light show. you also should vısıt bar on top of one of supertrees with fantastic view of marina Sands Bay Hotel."
,,Wonderful and it's free,5.0,,"Supertree Grove can be found in the Gardens by the Bay complex. Free to view, Beautiful plants growing up these artificial trees. Each night trees are lit up and a free light show spectacular available for the public to view. One can walk along a platform at top of trees which provides great overall views at a cost."
,,Nice photo place,3.0,,the view during the day and night is totally different. its more worthwhile to go during the night for the night light show and the various night lighting.
,,great place to see,5.0,,"this is a great place to see during the day however do not forget to miss the evening light and music show, very emotional"
,,supertree rocks,4.0,,"the supertrees are worth a visit and, if you are lucky with the weather, you can walk up there. I was't lucky, though I had lunch on the biggest tree, which is topped with a restaurant., incredible view.,"
,,Exciting,5.0,,Great views from the skywalk as you walk from tree to tree - plus you can visit the restaurant Indochine and have a wonderful soft shelled crab there and dring - with a view`!
,,Futuristic Wonder,5.0,,"A must see in Singapore! If you like photography, you would really enjoy it. I advise that you late in the afternoon so that it wouldn't be too warm. Also, during dinner time there is a light show so wait for that. There are restaurants near the place so you don't have to worry about dinner. The restaurants are tasty and affordable."
,,Funny trees,5.0,,"In the Gardens by the Bay there is a small place with huge metal constructions. They remind a bit a palm tree but calling them tree is a slight exaggeration. Any way, these constructions look quite interesting, rather nice, and thrilling in the late evening when there are lights blinking with music in the background. I am not sure if in every evening there is such concert, but at least I have seen some during weekend time."
,,Like the movie Avatar,5.0,,"Dont miss this when you visit the Domes! If you are not afraid of heights, supertree grove is a must."
,,Super Tree Groove,4.0,,Super Tree Groove is one of the highlights of Singapore. The Lights show is a marvel in engineering. A must spot to visit.
,,Amazing Light and Music Shop,5.0,,"Highlight of our trip and it was FREE. Supertree Grove is on the outside of Marina Bay Resort and Gardens of the Bay. Twice a night they put on a light show to set music. What an amazing experience. Could have gone back every night we were in Singapore to watch it again and again. You can not go to Singapore without visiting it. Transport to and from is easy, lots of options. Love our photos from here :)"
,,Good activity experience - not for someone who's scared of heights,4.0,,"The activity itself was good - no frills. You go up yourself and walk the bridge that has a mesh at the bottom (if you're fainthearted and does not like heights THIS IS NOT FOR YOU).

My son (3 years old) liked it - wasn't bothered by heights and the could be scary mesh as you can see the height you're at. I'm not that scared of heights but this bridge scared me a bit especially when you get through the narrow bit. Still good to do.

A little pricey though I think for adults for a short walk."
,,Just Beautiful,5.0,,"A lovely environment to amble around, particularly as night fall and the trees light up. It's free too!!"
,,An almost sky-high view of Singapore,5.0,,"I hate heights and tend to suffer from vertigo when there's very little between me and the ground, so I approached this excursion with trepidation. Yes, it did feel a little strange and I was a little nervous, but I am so glad I didn't miss this opportunity. the walk in the Supertree Grove was a treat and one of the highlights of the visit to Singapore."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Visiting the Supertree Grove in the Gardens by the Bay is a definite must-do when in Singapore. We had drinks in a restaurant on top of one of the Supertrees and the view from there is amazing...well worth the added cost.
,,Very nice skywalk,4.0,,Nice experince walking high above the gardens . It is a small walk where u get 15 mins to walk between the super trees at the garden. Get to see amazing views from this bridge.
,,Supertree Grove Light Show.,5.0,,"We had been meaning to go to this on our last few visits but didn't get there. Our loss. WOW!!! Waltz of the Trees was magnificent. The music was really great, the lights magnificent. First time I have seen a 'tree' do the cancan. Loved it. Sorry we didn't go earlier in our stay so we could have gone a few times."
,,Beautiful and a bit surreal,4.0,,Best by night I think. Almost like entering a dream scape. Relaxing and surprising tranquil for being in the heart of such a large and busy city.
,,Sky Walk,4.0,,"Was at The Gardens By The Bay today.

Ascended on the Supertree Grove. Walked on the OCBC Skyway. My first time. Birdeye view of the surrounding gardens and the city skyline. Spend about 15 minutes walking on the sky haha. Slow pace. Fresh air. Good experience.

Enjoyed."
,,The best views,5.0,,Going up to the walkways was great and worth the money to go up. Your up so high its neat to be way up there looking out over the other super trees!
,,Good for a single visit,4.0,,"There are various themed gardens like chinese, malay, indian gardens. The entrance to the supertree grove is free bit the skywalk is payable at 8 SD. Nothing much to see from it as well. The night show s good. You shouldnt miss it."
,,Spectacular,4.0,,"The free shows of an evening offer a supurb light and music show, dont miss it. The children were enthralled, really for all ages."
,,A unique park,4.0,,"Since this is free, spend more than one afternoon strolling around the huge park. There are different garden niches throughout. It is easy to miss some of it as I did later. Get a map! The trees are slowly being covered with bougainvilleas and other plants. If the heat is too much to take, get on the tram and relax. The trees are lit up at night which we did not see. Next time."
,,Fabulous lights and music,5.0,,Must See for Everyone! This is such a beautiful FREE exhibit that makes me love Singapore more than I already did!
,,great photos,5.0,,"Located at Gardens by the Bay with the best views off the Waterfront district and some of the most spectacular gardens that I have ever seen, well worth a look."
,,Trees with technology and Life,5.0,,"It was amazing site to see in Singapore night sky ,watching the trees get lightened up and dance in the music is the one of my best memories of Singapore .suggest to have two views near the tree and bit far from the tree it is too different views of the trees that grow in side and light it self outside ."
,,Worth visiting at night,4.0,,"Singapore is easy to walk around, so the supertrees is the first place you should go to. Stunning and colourful attraction, and if you go at the right time (usually on the hour), choreographed music plays throughout the park, synchronised to the lights. Beautiful."
,,Wow!!!,5.0,,"these trees are amazing! beautiful by day, stunning at night. The lightshow is a must see and the skywalk is fantastic."
,,Memorable Experince,5.0,,"A truely wonderful experince although weather related, but I was lucky to be able to view it before the rain closed it down for the day. Check the forecast before buying a ticket"
,,Magnificent,5.0,,Nice !!! Worth to give it a try as it only cost you sgd10 to have a drink and at the same time enjoying this magnificent view.
,,Be sure to include a night visit!,4.0,,"The Super Trees at the Gardens by the Bay have grown in and vines and air plants cover the trunks and creep over the ""branches"" at the very top. I have enjoyed watching them ""fill in"" over the last 3 years. I LOVE seeing them at night when the sun has set and the light show begins on the massive trees. Pack a picnic or eat at Satay by the Bay and enjoy the gardens and the trees into the night."
,,Singapore Trip 2016,5.0,,"Very nice, the tree top walk costs SG$8 per person, and is well worth it the photos are great. The park is very large and after a while it starts to all look the same. Get there early 10am for free rein of the park and the best photos (no one walking in front of you)."
,,Absolutely beautiful!,5.0,,"My wife and I visited SuperTree Grove at the end of a tour of Gardens BtB and we loved every single second of it. Aesthetically they are a thing of beauty, adding a different dimension to an already lush, green setting, bringing colour, shape and light in the evenings. The viewing platform is amazing and offers a great opportunity to view the gardens in their entirety whilst also being able to look back at the behemoth which is MBS and the city sky line. The towers and the grove are an absolute must at the end of any visit to the Gardens, do not over look. 5*."
,,Out of this world - Super Trees,5.0,,"What a transformation day to night. Impressive for their size, statue and plants up their trunks. But at night these tree become alive to a fantastic light and music show. Well worth a walk before or after dinner. Another must see in Gardens by the Bay."
,,Beautifull,5.0,,It is beautiful to see how they make the garden so beautiful. the lighting at night..so beautiful. And also free.
,,Man made trees,5.0,,"Someone had an innovative idea to construct these 'trees'. Now home to hundreds of species of plants, they are a dominant part of the Singapore skyline."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"The gardens surrounding the trees are beautiful , but at night when the trees light up the scenery is amazing , especially with the Marina Bay Sands as a back drop"
,,Rainbow of Colours,5.0,,These trees have a light show presented free to the public every night a wonderful way to relax and enjoy the balmy Singapore nights tree gazing and you may even see a few stars in the sky too.
,,amazing,5.0,,The way these super tree work and how they look at nights.. spectacular. The bar on top with music and drinks was fabulous.. definitely a must see in Singapore
,,Highlight of the trip!,5.0,,"This was the coolest garden in Singapore! Go right before sun down to see the with and without lights! Must see the light show in the evning, it was amazing!"
,,Best experience in Singapore!,5.0,,"It was amazing feeling. Go there when the sun goes down. First show starts at 7:45 pm (Lights and classical music). This was amazing it brought tears in my eyes. Supertrees are free for public.We also went to Skyway (8SGD per person) and it wasworth it. Would recommend this to anyone. It is a must see when in Singapore, don't miss it!"
,,Amazing feat of ingenuity and design,5.0,,"Standing at the base of these enormous ""trees"" makes you feel very small indeed. They are truly spectacular and covered in the most beautiful plants. Every time you look at them you see something new and different. Little orchid plants, bromeliads dotted among the vines - absolutely wonderful. Take the skywalk and get among the canopies of these giants to truly appreciate their size and design. The views from up there are worth the trip on their own. Come back at night (7.45 and 8.45 pm each night) for the light and sound display, you won't be able to stop yourself from smiling!"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Make sure you go here mid to late afternoon to maximise the sights. There is a charge to go up into the super tree skyway but no charge if you choose not to. The light shows are at 7:45 and 8:45 and last about 10 mins.
,,Good time pass,4.0,,"If you are a first time visitor, you can visit it. Great view from the above. A good walk between 2 structures. Overall a good time pass"
,,Great Views,5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore just once, you should do this. The views are great and you'll get some good pictures. I have a membership so I've been up there 3 times and I really enjoy it. I know it's like S$8 but I say it's worth it. Oh and go at night, the music and light show are so good. I didn't take it seriously that the show would be good but we went one night and it was just so enjoyable."
,,A good night attraction,4.0,,During the night at 7:45 there is a wonderful light show with mostly classical music. Sit down on the ground and let you inspire by the light games.
,,Favourite part of Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore is a regular stopover for us on our way to Europe or Asia and visiting Gardens by the Bay is always on our list. I have lost count of the number of times we have been to the twice nightly show at the Supertrees and every time I love it, every time I take photos and find a new vantage point."
,,Artifical Trees on Big Pillars - Good Night VIsit,3.0,,This is a complete man made artifical structure with good plans. many pillars are located. The Park is free to use but the walk between the towers is chargeable. Would suggest to skip the walk if you have already visited the Singapore flyer. Must visit during night. It is little walking disatance from the entrance.
,,Great light show.,5.0,,Just outside the dome. Self sustaining model. The light show happens here twice in the evening and there is a walk way in the middle of the grove which is nice.
,,Spectacular Light Show,4.0,,"Singapore never failed to impressed me, it has been a while since my last visit in 2013 so when I return last month for a weekend getaway I heard this new tourist spot is on the hype. I went there at night, which is the best time to really enjoy the light of Supertrees here (or some people called it Avatar trees). The view is superb!"
,,Go at night,5.0,,The grove is cool in the day but comes alive at night. Light shows at 7:45 and 8:45 (when I was there) and the lights and music made it magical. Highly recommended.
,,Treeriffic,5.0,,These gardens are spectacular and the treetop walk is amazing although you only get 15 minutes at a time because the number that can be on the walkways at any time is limited.
,,Try and get on the sky walk at 7.00pm,5.0,,If you wait in the long line for the skywalk try and get in the lift up to the skywalk 5 minutes before trees light up. We stood in line and let a few people go before us so we could be on the skywalk at the right time. You are only allowed on the skywalk for 15 mins maximum.
,,walk in the sky over the gardens,4.0,,this was one nice part of the visit to Gardens by the Bay; impressive view of the park from this walkway between tree-like structures
,,Very special evening,5.0,,"Go along at night for the amazing light and sound show. When we were there it was musicals, and if you just lay back on the ground and stare up at the trees it really is quite a special experience unlike any other. A Singapore must see"
,,Over price,2.0,,It only takes you 5-8 minutes to finish the whole walk. It looks interesting from below but there is not much to offer. I would say keep that few dollars for something else.
,,Amazing night time light show,5.0,,"You can't miss the night time light show at the Supertree Grove in Gardens by the Bay. We were right under the main supertree and laid on the ground to watch the show. So incredible! In my opinion, much better than fireworks. Free admission to boot!"
,,Best at night,4.0,,The light shows were OK. But definitely worth going to see at least once. Could get very crowded so show up a little early to get a good view spot.
,,Sound and light show just amazing.,5.0,,"We went to Indfochine the roof top bar but soon realised you cannot actually see the sound and light show from this location.

Ground level is the place to be. The cool people just lie back flat on the seating and look up at the show. The sound and color coordination are very well done.

In May the show was for about 15 minutes and started at 7:45 and 8:45.

Bring a camera .... with video if possible.

Check out the Marina Bay Sands hotel foyer as you are leaving."
,,Come before sunset,5.0,,"We visited about 5.30pm, had a walk, went up on the skywalk and then sat down below watching the colours change as the sun went down behind Marina Bay Sands. Stayed till the first light show. A delightful evening."
,,Beautiful and functional,4.0,,Singapore hit a home run with these functional CO2 collector monuments. They are beautiful and reside in a must see garden right downtown. Photographer's dream at night.
,,Beautiful!!,5.0,,It's one of the first things you notice about the city! They seem to me to be so futuristic and extremely cool. We went at all night and the tree were very beautiful with all the lights and the light show that they put is wonderful! Must see in Singapore!
,,Fantasy land!,5.0,,"I visited this with a tour group, Tour East, which was very well organized . The trees are spectacular, and at designated times there is a fantastic sound and light show, ....when I was there the trees seemed to dance to Strauss waltzes...the two ""bubbles"" nearby are also very well worth a visit. One houses an exhibit of gardens of the world ( when I was there there was a special exhibit on tulips and spring flowers) and the other displays a tropical cloud forest. From the top of the Marina Bay Sands there is a splendid vista of the entire city - I saw it by night, and it is a must...I am sure it will be amazing by day also."
,,Great for Kids,4.0,,"Great place to entertain the kids with a fantastic playground and light show. Just make sure you leave before the rush, otherwise you;ll be in a very long taxi queue. We ended up walking 20 minutes to Marina Bay Sands to get a taxi."
,,Pretty light show,5.0,,"The light show was a great way to end the day and is really pretty. There are light shows at 7.45pm and 8.45pm. We went on a Thursday and it was not at all crowded, we were able to sit right under the super trees. Many people laid down to look up at the lights, there are also good views from further away around the gardens."
,,Incredible,5.0,,"These trees are fascinating and and interesting look at city planning. They collect rainwater as well as provide visual entertainment. Free to walk around the grove. One has a skybar - $10 entry includes a soft drink, tea or coffee or $18 entry includes an alcoholic drink."
,,GREAT to see. Skip the walk through the trees,4.0,,"The walk through the trees provides great views, however, at SGD$8.00, you can get just as good of views from the Cloud Forest and see it as many times as you like with a hand stamp Better yet, it is indoors. I would skip this and view them from the cloud forest."
,,Man Made Wonder,4.0,,There are around 12 Super Groove trees in Garden by the Bay with a restaurant in one of the trees.OCBC skywalk is a walking platform connecting to few of these trees.However the highlight of this place is the Rhapsody show which takes place below these trees as night.
,,long wait to see the show,3.0,,lights and music show.. when i was there..they were playing the waltz..a bit boring for me..but great light show...
,,Lovely Place,4.0,,This is a great attraction and the views are stunning. If possible try and visit at night when they are all lit up and set to music.
,,Stunning and beautiful,5.0,,By day or night this is stunning with the combination of man made structure and clever engineering and the beauty and softening effect of plants. Do the walk and view the Gardens by the Bay and beyond. At night the light is fascinating but its over so quickly. Take a picnic or purchase food there - the latter quite pricey. Its a great atmosphere as locals and tourists gather in the preceding hour or so. Lots of families too.
,,Great place,5.0,,These are a great attraction during the day and fantastic at night when they light up set to music a couple of times a night and it is free so families can enjoy a night out
,,Better to view it from afar,3.0,,"Nothing too fancy, would be ok if it was free, but you need to pay and up close it isn't that special."
,,Yoga session by True Yoga,4.0,,Was delighted to be a part of the yoga session by True Yoga on Mother's Day. The experience of the place is absolutely enchanting. The peace and tranquil it gives is something words can't describe. Must visit.
,,Dont miss this one,5.0,,"As well as enviromentally successfull they are great just to stand and look at during the day. But make sure you catch the light shows in the evenings, 19:45 and 20:45.
They are busy so get there early. If you go by the MRT then make sure you have a return ticket because the line at the machines after are large and slow"
,,Man made excellence,4.0,,It is a superb concept. Watch it lit at night when they put on the music. The structures are amazing right in the centre of the Gardens.
,,sustainability as its finest,5.0,,It's like Alice in Wonderland. Must not miss the light display at night. The idea behind sustainability and the least impact on environment is an example to be followed by all countries. Thank you Singapore for the experience. There is hope for the future generations yet.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,This is such a simple but clever design in the gardens. Take some time to spot the wide range of plants used over the frameworks.
,,Awesome night show at the Supertree Grove,4.0,,It is better seen at night. We got there by taxi but mass transit is also good. The place is spacious and well planned out. The Supertree Grove was the highlight of the Gardens by the Bay. Better not miss the Rhapsody of Lights that is played. Awesome thing to see and hear. Restaurants close by 10 pm except for McDonald's at Satay by the Bay which closes at 1 am. Do not miss this place.
,,Visit during the day and night,4.0,,"Impressive huge man-made structures. We visited during the day and walked along the walkway with great views of the conservatories and surrounding garden. We came back a few days later and watched the light show from the Marina Bay Sands. Very well done, definitely worth a visit."
,,Mind blowing.,5.0,,We timed it to arrive at the foot of the supertrees just before the show started at 7.45pm. The light show started right on time and was constant until 8.30pm. The lasers and lights moved to the beat of all the old Broadway numbers and it was breathtaking. Definitely a highlight of the trip. Don't miss it.
,,Do not miss the Supertree Grove and the Supertree Rhapsody light show.,5.0,,"In the center of the Gardens by the Bay nature park is the Supertree Grove of tree-like structures that stand between 25 and 50 meters. In essence, the Supertrees are vertical gardens with plants growing up and down their trunks, and many creeping plants finding their own way up to the heights of the Supertrees. There is also an elevated walkway in the Supertree Grove that visitors can enjoy for a fee of $8 SGD for adults. The walkway is 22 meters high and 128 meters long, and provides excellent views of the nature park.

One of the key attractions to the Gardens by the Bay that must not be missed in my opinion is the Supertree Rhapsody light show in the evenings. The solar powered Supertrees are used for a beautiful light show set to music that truly is a must see especially for photographers, families and children. I recommend that on weekends and holidays visitors get to the grove early to stake out a spot to watch the show; there not seating per se for the show, one just sits on what benches are available or on the grass. During my visit, many families had packed picnic meals to eat while waiting for the sun to go down and the show to begin. The light show lasts between 10 – 15 minutes, and is well worth seeing; children absolutely love the show as do adults.

Currently, the nearest Mass Rapid Transit (MRT/SMRT) station is Bayfront MRT station which is only a very short walk from the Gardens."
,,fantastic,5.0,,night show was awesome . what an experience . great photos and memories . a must to see - do not miss this
,,Lovely especially the light show,5.0,,"It was lovely to see during the day, at sunset and after dark. I had planned to do the Skywalk but randomly ended up going up to the IndoChine restaurant, which has 360 degree panoramic views from even higher than the Skywalk, so didn't see the point in doing both.

The light show was great. Definitely try to catch that. When you're watching the light show be careful where you sit though. DO NOT sit where the Skywalk queue is (although this is not very obvious nor signposted in any way). We had a very unpleasant experience due to this and I want to share it so that others can be warned and also if management read the reviews then they can be aware of this issue and this member of staff's unprofessional behaviour.

We went and found a good spot early for the light show. We sat there with our baby for ages without any staff even mentioning anything. Then suddenly just as the show was about to start this member of staff called Queenie said we have to move as she wanted the people in the queue for the Skywalk to sit there. As the light show is a popular time of day, the queue tends to be extra long and extend back way past the barriers.

So she demands that we move (just us, no one else, even though we had been sitting there for ages with a baby) and just before the light show is about to start, so there are no other spots left. So I said to her ""I am happy to move if you can find us another good spot"". To which she replied ""I am not your dog"". Now seriously??! What sort of way is that to speak to a customer when you are in the hospitality business. She then continued to harass us throughout the whole show, telling us rudely to move and shouting at us saying we are ""destroying her queue"". So my husband told her very clearly that the space allocated to this queue is where the barriers are. If the queue has gone further than this then it is not our fault and if this was a problem she should have made us aware when we had sat down, not during the show, which she completely ruined for us.

People in this queue were also watching in disbelief. Not one person actually expected to sit down. They were in a queue. When I am in a queue for something- tickets/ waiting to get on a ride, I don't expect to be seated.

Then she randomly went and got some temporary barriers and put them right in front of us and said ""now you're in my queue"". How childish and pathetic. Someone is obviously getting some sort of power trip from being in charge of a queue.

We think this Queenie particularly targeted us for some reason. She asked the girls next to us ONCE to move, they said no, she left them alone. But she kept on going on and on at us for no reason.

Even after the show ended she kept shouting at my husband and being very aggressive even though he was holding our baby son, coming right up to his face shouting ""you wanna fight me?"" My husband was so annoyed with her that he demanded to speak to her manager.

Now the manager seemed like a professional and reasonable person. She seemed quite embarrassed about her employee's behaviour, especially as she continued to shout at us in front of her manager. So the manager told her to stop shouting and apologised to us (but Queenie did not apologise). The manager seemed to be aware that she has ""issues"". But if that's the case then she shouldn't be allowed to work with the public, especially as she has no idea how to behave with people. I hope this incident is taken seriously by management and not just brushed under the carpet."
,,"so cool, it looks like a huge space flower !",5.0,,very good integrated into the gardens. The trees are very unique and a fun thing is that you can even walk through a hanging bridge from one tree to another. Amazing to see them glowing in the dark.
,,Be careful.......,2.0,,"We went along in the evening at a weekend, with many, many others. I thought it quite dangerous. The lighting is of course dim and its all very artfully designed but at the top and bottom of stairs and escalators there are viewing spots where people cluster to take selfies oblivious to others using the stairs/escalators... its only a matter of time before there is an accident. In addition some walkways are no longer well surfaced with small areas of subsidence...that and the dim lighting is another safety hazard."
,,Superb,5.0,,Do visit it during the dusk to get a glimpse of day view and night view. This grove and the adjoining domes deserve 4-5 hours. So plan it in the afternoon. Must visit.
,,overwhelming view from ocbc skyway,4.0,,"during day visited the ocbc skyway..viewing time on skyway is only 15 mins after which the staff guides you to leave the deck.incase of thunder, lightning or shower entry to skyway is stopped until climate is favorable.15 mins is too short for the stunning view..the music/light show on 20-apr-16 wasn't impressive..just an average show..but other than the show the supertree lighting is awesome.."
,,Great place to visit for the light show,4.0,,"Something for everyone at Supertree Grove the light show was greta and best of all free, we had a drink afterwards at one of the eating places. Overall a pleasant way to spend an evening."
,,Great Place to Visit,5.0,,"We decided to take lunch here, you pay at the entrance and you get a free drink with your meal, food is pretty good. But the views are fantastic. You can walk around the outside of the restaurant and take in the nice views.

At night the have an awesome lights and music show, although I believes its only happens certain times during the year, but its really has a wow factor. A must do"
,,Creative and highly imaginative,5.0,,"On my walking tour of the Marina Bay area of Singapore I strolled over to the Supertree Grove mid afternoon. The ""supertrees"" are certainly very innovative. I decided against paying the small fee to walk up on the skywalk connecting a number of the trees. I could appreciate them all at ground level.

However, the imagery of the supertrees in normal daylight pales into insignificance when you see them at night. I returned after dusk and caught the lion's share of the evening ""son et lumiere"" type of event. Here the supertrees are lit up brightly and synchronised to display in line with music being broadcast around the grove. The light show is truly amazing - almost like watching a fireworks display without the bangs.

This is a free show and was very popular when I was there on a Saturday night back in April. Many visitors were sitting on the steps leading down into the grove. You have to step your way through these people to get closer and find some room to watch the show in comfort. There is plenty of space once you have negotiated the stairs sitting brigade.

I thoroughly recommend visiting this in the evening as a nice prelude to dinner."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"A must if visiting Singapore, worth a stop over visit in itself. Will improve as plants grow and mature."
,,Amazing light show in the evening,4.0,,"The best time to visit this place is at night when the Supertrees are lit. There is an audio and light show around 7.45 pm, please check the latest schedule from the web site. Many tourists will be there so if you want a good spot, try to be early. The best way to enjoy the light show is to lie on the ground and look up into the sky, this way, you do not need to crank your neck. The show is about 10-15 minutes. If you are not afraid of height, you should try the sky walk connecting the supertrees. Please note that the walk close before eight, anyway check the timing for latest update."
,,outstanding,5.0,,"a good example of art and nature coming together - interesting, educational and simply beautiful - also has peaceful settings but worth doing the tour first."
,,Interesting Experience,4.0,,"You have to pay for this experience. The lift takes you to the walkway which gives you a panoramic view of the Singapore Flyer, parts of the gardens and views of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the harbour. The time allotted for being on the walkway is 15 minutes which gives you enough time to walk out to the end and back. Walk down the stairs so you can see inside the trees so that you can get an idea of the way these trees were built and the ways the plants are attached to them. One of the trees has a restaurant at the top. The trees are dual purpose. Not only are they amazing structures for vertical plantings but are vents as well. Don't miss the fabulous light display at 8.30 and 9.30 each night."
,,Lovely Place with Great Views,5.0,,"This is a wonderful place - the trees are so unique. Its also a great place for a drink with a view. Yes, its a bit pricey, but its less busy than other vantage points and really unique especially at night."
,,Amazing,4.0,,We were not able to go near the Trees because of the limited time we have but even from afar it is so amazing. Next time whem we visit Singapore we will make sure to visit the trees and spend more time in the area.
,,Nice place,4.0,,"Artificial domes created to house plants of different varieties . A good well maintained place , you feel good walking around the super tree. they have an night show with lights on the supertree grove"
,,Stunning view,5.0,,"go there during late afternoon or early evening, when it is not that hot and the night lights are on."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"No need to tell much how it is. From pics u can undertake why it's so attractive. Especially at night. Well, like a dream world"
,,These are amazing,5.0,,These are amazing. Come and see them in the day and the night and the treetop walk is well worth the added cost.
,,Exquisite!,5.0,,"Really different to anything seen before and it becomes magical as it gets dark. The flowers and plants start to glow with clever lighting. The Light and Laser show takes place here nightly to music, worth a visit. This is a free attraction."
,,Rapsody,5.0,,"Supertree light show is something than any visitor to Singapore must experience. Variety of light effects and its synchronization with the music is excellent. Be sure to check schedule of shows during your stay and try to combine it with visit to ""Wonderful Life"" held in near bay Bayfront."
,,Part of the Marina Gardens -Free,5.0,,"The trees are amazing especially the one with the restaurant at the top. Enjoy the walk, see the trees & enjoy the gardens all for free!!"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Great to do skywalk during the day for a top view of the Bay area. The symphony at night is also great and worth seeing. Just laying on the grass, listening to the music and watching the lights was very relaxing and enjoyable."
,,A must visit!,4.0,,A wonderful place to visit! Every evening they do a light and sound show which is simply awesome! Tag it along with visit of Garden by the Bay!
,,very interesting and beautiful,5.0,,"I really liked the supertrees at the Gardens by the bay, they are quite beautiful and a mini eco system all on their own."
,,bridge connecting 2 super trees - great view,4.0,,"the super tree grove are the collection of man made tree like structures. there is a bridge that connects 2 of the main super trees at gardens by the bay. once you purchase the tickets (costs SGD 8 per person), you can go up to the bridge. the view is quite good! although u might want to skip this if you are afraid of heights. the super trees light up at night for the light and sound show - at 7:45 pm and 8:45 pm. this is worth watching!. the lighting is incredible"
,,"Great in the day, even better at night!",5.0,,The Supertrees are stunning in the day but at night in turns into a light and laser show spectacle. We watched this from the top of Marina Bay Sands which was a great experience.
,,Wow! Must see at night.,5.0,,Amazing but you must go at night time! It's all about the lights and they have a light show on at certain times. Just sit in the park below and watch the lights!
,,Very new and beautiful,4.0,,"This is a part of the Gardens By The Bay and a beautiful one at that. Its a shame the skywalk was closed the day we went otherwise it would have been a stellar experience.
It was sheet bad luck as the night we went the light show also had some technical faults and did not function properly,but we did see it from the Flyer and it looked spectacular.
They are a very new thing I had seen anywhere from my travels."
,,Modern Attraction Point,5.0,,"As it is a modern attraction point, we set it as our ""must go"". Although we visit at day time, the view is good. Maybe on Christmas Holiday, we quene up for over 40 mins to go up and only can stay for a few mins."
,,Free and very good show at night,4.0,,Times were 7.45pm and 8.45pm for the light show. Trees lighting up in time to the music. Worth a look and it's free!
,,Very impressive,5.0,,"Nice to see during the day, but the evening is really when these tress come into their full glory. Go on the sky walk, it's around SG$8.00."
,,"wow, good view, nice music and so romantic especially in the evening",4.0,,lovely place to have a walk up there or sit below and also at night time can have music to listen and see the light change. very good activity to relax there chill and enjoy
,,Wow Wow Wow Wow.... it is amazing!,5.0,,"This is a must see modern icon. Brilliant seeing a city place so much money and emphasis on the importance of sustainable gardens and parklands. I wont write too much about it, do go, do visit the different exhibits and do go up the tower and walk ways and stop for a refreshment and take in the scenery. Take water with you and allow lots of time. 3 to 4 hours easy but you can do less if desired."
,,Wow,5.0,,We watched the light show in the evening which was fantastic. Not to be missed if you have time. Our trip was part of the bus tour.
,,Dont miss the light shows,5.0,,Free music and light shows 7.45pm and 8.45pm well worth seeing. Eateries near by. seating on hte ground.
,,"LIghtshow, the best part about Supertree Grove",5.0,,"The evening light show is the best time to visit this place .. Better to reach a bit early so you can find a nice spot to sit or lay down ... A visit to Gardens by the Bay is incomplete without watching the light show over here ...
If i am not mistaken, they have the show 2 times every night ..."
,,Superlative light show,5.0,,"Catching the SMRT back from the Changi Prison Museum we got off at the Bay front station and walked through to the park. A light Dinner at the near by Oriental Western Bistro sustained us till the light show at 1945hrs, our primary reason for this visit. Spectacular display with excellent sound made for an enjoyable finalle to a an adventure packed day."
,,Free Fun for the kids!,4.0,,Our kids (5&2) loved seeing these spectacular trees! It looked like something out of a Tim Burton movie! You can do the skywalk for a small price but it was worth it for us!
,,GREAT SPOT,5.0,,went there for lunch right to the top great food very good value ! make sure you go up the stairs and look out 360 degrees !
,,Nice to walked there .,4.0,,- Recommend to visit the place to enjoy the sunset lighting up the night . - Suitable for sports lovers walk . - Do not forget to take a camera with you .
,,Amazing sculptures and walkways,5.0,,"If you've just finished exploring Marina Bay Sands then why not take in the Supertree's as well. You can wander round the gardens before taking in the cantilevered skywalk or vice versa.

At night the tree sculptures are beautifully lit so is just as much fun as an evening activity as during the day."
,,Beutiful man made trees.,4.0,,This is a must visit free to public attraction. The light show is amazing and not to be missed. There is a restaurant on top of one of the trees which I wasn't able to visit due to time constraints.
,,Like something out of Avatar,5.0,,"What a cool place! It seemed other-worldly. We arrived close to dusk and around the time of an approaching storm, which made for some cool photos. If you only do one touristy thing in Singapore, this should be it!"
,,Excellent,4.0,,Part of the Couds area and a worthwhile visit including the Raised walkway. Small cost to do it but worthwhile.
,,Futuristic,5.0,,They are the iconic landmarks of the Gardens by the Bay. If you wish to go to the top of the largest the is an entry fee as there is to take the elevated walk between them. But to walk around them is free!
,,Amazing,4.0,,"These artificial trees are wonderful. Though we spent some good time below that, we weren't allowed up due to bad weather."
,,Walk and enjoy,4.0,,"Its a treat for the eyes to see them in lights, quite beautifully done. Appreciate the effort they took to build it and the effort to keep them beautiful."
,,Jaw-Dropping-Beauty,5.0,,"When you are at the Gardens By the Bay, this becomes the third must do activity after the two domes. Around 10 beautifully decorated trees, maybe not that great during the day, but turns out to be a treat to your eyes at the night."
,,"Impressive, worth the visit!",5.0,,"The garden is free but if you want to do the supertree top walk, tickets are $5 each. It was a unique experience and well worth the visit. I would recommend coming here around sunset so you can see the supertrees during the day and watch how it illuminates as the sun goes down. Did not see the light show but I heard good things about it. The tree top walk was scary for me as I'm afraid of heights so beware. All in all, an interesting and unique experience. Fun fact, the supertree itself is environmentally friendly and they harness solar energy!"
,,5 day visit,5.0,,"This is another must, we visited during the day, then returned in the evening to have a meal and walk through the gardens to see the trees all lit up. Fantastic"
,,Be Aware - FEES To Get Up Them,4.0,,"It's a great area to walk around and relax in actual outdoor nature instead of the gardens with their perfect climate control, and lots of benches and shade. However, in order to actually go up and see the park from the tops (which you can do!) it's a fee ... the highest you can get is the walkway in when you enter otherwise. There are often events and music and other great stuff here, of course, and the pictures are fun with it lit up at night! But this whole area has a LOT of options for great sights and activities and the supertree grove wouldn't make my top three, personally. But on the way from one place to the next, and for a nice little stop to rest your feet, sure!"
,,Something different,4.0,,I came here one night for a walk around. It is free to walk around but some things are extra depending on whether you want to do them or not. There is a light show to music which I why I came and it was very good. Worth going down one night when the lights are on and it looks its best.
,,Neat adn impressive energy use,5.0,,Neat architectural structures by day but visual explosion by night. And the energy resources used to light them is all sustainable from the conservatories' refuse. So impressive.
,,Great architecture,4.0,,"While the gardens are free, if you want to climb above, you should buy tickets. You are going with a elevator above, but can go back also by stairs. It is not so long to walk over the trees."
,,Tranquility in the middle of the crowds,5.0,,"Came here several times during our stay usually at around 6pm when the sun is still bright and it is less crowded. We'd lay down under one of the trees to relax after a day of walking, eating and shopping. The view above is just amazing and calming. We'd stay for the lights show and usually leave in the middle of it to avoid the crowds after the show. They say the best things in life are free and the super trees groves is one of those things."
,,Superview at SuperTree!,5.0,,"We human can build real tree or SuperTree! This place is definitely original and creative! SuperTree by IndoChine is situated perfectly on the tallest structure - up to 16 storeys in height.
I got a big King-Chair for Supertree Dining, very lucky :) SuperTree greeted its visitors by coming and leaving with great dreamlike music-light show! Amazing!"
,,Spectacular!,4.0,,"The super tree grove is breathtaking, especially at night! We couldn't go up on the bridge due to maintenance issues. We were also quite disappointed when the garden rhapsody was cancelled due to technical problems. Still, it was an amazing experience!"
,,This Place is Out of This World!,5.0,,"Who thought of these giant trees, covered with foliage? The garden is huge and offers a wide variety of different settings. We bought tickets to the sky walk and loved seeing the overview of the layout. The tram tour is good to get your bearings. We also paid to go into the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome and loved them both. The Garden itself is free and will give you plenty of opportunity to walk to your hearts content."
,,Visit during the day -- go back at nighttime!,5.0,,"Wandering the Gardens by the Bay, don't forget to wander the Supertree Grove. Pay the small fee to go up to the walkway and get a great view of the Gardens, and Singapore.

And then... go back and night and marvel at the spectacle of the light show! Synchronized to music (All that Jazz! Disney tunes!), it's one of the better light shows I've seen. Better than a fireworks display. Be sure to be in the middle of the trees, in the grassy area. Lie down on your back, and just enjoy!"
,,Good Night shows,4.0,,Excellent place to relax and watch the light and music show late evening Not a place to visit during day time due to extreme hot and humid climate
,,Amazing Supertrees!,5.0,,"Never seen anything quite like the Supertrees. Best to go at night, when they're all lit up in different colours. It's a magical place."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"With the fading daylight, the trees started to illuminate, changing colors all the time and the music added to this great experience. A completely new kind of happening. Some had brought pillows and laid down to enjoy the event."
,,To be seen to be believed.,5.0,,At night the whole atmoshere is palpable. What a creation. It's a must visit when in Singapore. Certainly at night.
,,Feel like in Avatar!,5.0,,Supertree Grove is amazing especially during night time and when is light show... Great place to visit!!! You have to when You are in Singapore
,,Stunning super trees,5.0,,"Singapore seems to have now adopted the new hotel at Marina Bay as its new icon. They should have chosen the super trees. Giant tree like sculptures that are now being covered by nature, and at night they are part of a sound and light show"
,,Better to see with the latighting,5.0,,"Visited around sunset and hence was able to see the supertrees in day light and with the lighting. The Skywalk gives a good view of the super trees and the surroundings.
There is a garden rhapsody music and light show at 7.45pm which is quite interesting.
Ticket costs S$5"
,,Night time light show is good,4.0,,"We went back having not taken a tour which is a bit of a luxury considering that entry into the Grove is FREE for the Light Show at around 19:45 hrs and it was quite nice, but it would have been nicer with some classical music in the background.

Did find that the On/Off of the lights a couple of times were a slight 'problem' but not sure if they were having electrical problems."
,,AMAZING,5.0,,"An awe inspiring visit to the Supertrees! We went at night for the symphony and light show! Wow, wow, wow! You'll think you've landed on another planet as it is truly out of this world."
,,Man made tourist attraction,4.0,,"Singapore has managed to build this tourist attraction as part of Gardens by the Bay. Considering the income generated from the OCBC over-head pedestrian walk (SGD $5 per person) and the entry fees from the Garden Dome and the Forest Dome, it has been a huge success."
,,Super amazing tree,5.0,,"Illustrating a rather futuristic concept of a park where nature and modern architecture collide to provide an impressive rendition of a garden park enjoyed by visitors during the day but most especially during night time because at 8pm, the trees has its dancing color with background music. We just admired it from the outside and didn’t bother getting inside because it’s too beyond our budget. Instead we took the connecting bridge to Marina Bay Sands, an equally interesting architecture at night as it is during the day standing beautifully by the bay."
,,Interesting place,5.0,,Tree is big and very beautiful. Garden is large. There is sky bridge - entry is 5 Sing dolars. I recommend going there in the evening.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"These tree groves are amazing both day and night. They are in the grounds of garden by the bay are are free to walk around the gardens. You only need to pay a small fee if you want to go up on the walk, which is worth it."
,,Very clever engineering,5.0,,Worth a visit to see the super trees day or night. At night (7.45 and 8.45) you will be amazed by the light and sound show at the Supertree Grove. The show is free which is a bonus. For $5 you can walk on the OCBC Skyway 22 metres high up iamongst the supertrees. A great view of the gardens.
,,Evening light show,4.0,,"They've a beautiful evening light show here. It's huge, well designed and wonderful for a look around."
,,Aweinspiring Light and Sound Show,5.0,,"We made a special trip to Gardens By The Bay to see the 7.45 p.m. sound and light show and what a treat it was.

The music and lights were cleverly synchronised and the music was so stirring that it brought tears to my eyes.

The atmosphere was lovely with singles, couples and families all enjoying the balmy evening and there was a young child of approximately one year in age sitting next to us who was absolutely enraptured by the changing colours of the trees.

The queue for the $3 shuttle back to the other side of the Gardens where we caught the MRT was quite long after the show, however it moved relatively quickly and there were plenty of staff on hand to ensure that everyone queued in a respectful manner.

Definitely an experience not to miss!"
,,"Great View, shame about the coffee.",4.0,,"For S$10 you can go up one of these man made trees for a drink. It gives you a great view of the park and is very peaceful. Drinks we cheap and nasty, you are clearly paying for the view, which is still worth it."
,,nice place to enjoy your afternoon,4.0,,"it's located in Gardens by the Bay area and it's free of charge.
best enjoyed around the time of sunset, when it's cooler and the lights on the supertrees start to light up. What a great place to relax, have a seat & chill out, to enjoy your beautiful afternoon, or have a chat with your friends."
,,Must watch Lightening show,3.0,,"It was a beautiful Lightening show. Although we could not go on the bridge to view it since it was closed due to some technical issue, try if you can enjoy the show from there. Lying down and watching the show would be the best thing you can do for your neck :)"
,,Absolutely beautiful,5.0,,"Supertree Grove was my most favourite thing to see in Singapore, it's amazing to behold such a fantasy style garden, seeing it during the day was fantastic but then seeing the light-show at night was magnificent, I'll never forget it. Tall man-made trees standing out above the canopy of real trees is quite surreal, it reminded me of something from Avatar. If you pay a small fee you can go up in a lift to a walkway and view everything from above. The lightshow at night takes your breath away, magic lights flicker on-off to different sets of music. You must see it, you wont be disappointed."
,,Artificial and not such a crowd pleaser.,3.0,,"At night, (8pm) there's a half hour musical show with the artificial trees lighting up in time with a rather odd choice of music."
,,Loved it,5.0,,"Couldn't stop taking pictures from all sides of the trees! It's really interesting set up. It costs around 8 dollars for adults and 5 for kids under 12 to go up and walk between the trees on a hanged bridge, the view is quite beautiful."
,,A unique structure which combines man-made structures with nature!,5.0,,"A great area to visit especially to watch the Sound and Light Show (called, 'Garden Rhapsody'), every night at 7.45 pm and 8.45 pm. It is free for the public."
,,Supertree light show,5.0,,"My wife and I have been to the Supertree Grove in Singapore during the day and were impressed. They are part of the Gardens by the Bay and tower above the lush tropical gardens and complement the large Cloud Forest and Flower domes. The trees are futuristic but, covered in bromeliads, they do not look out of place. There is a walkway that connects the largest trees and from them you get a sense of the work and planning that has gone into the design of these gardens.
Impressive by day, a light and sound show lights up the Supertrees at night which entertains and amazes. We watched it from across a canal, to avoid the weekend crowds but later joined the crowd as this is not just a show for tourists. At one of the trees, which has a bar and restaurant, a romantic young man had prepared a miniature lightshow of glowsticks at the entrance,to propose to a lucky young lady. There are two light shows every night but the weekend seems to bring the crowds and this combination of people and technology makes for a memorable night."
,,This is a must do.,4.0,,"I spent over an hour there. Very interesting, great views, an a bargin at $5.00. Make sure you see it at night."
,,Scifi trees,5.0,,"Reminded us of a scifi movie set! Love the trees and the walkway is great although can get a little crowded in some spots. The trees are especially spectacular at night, a must see is the light show."
,,Super trees,5.0,,Nice place to take photos at Super tree sky bridge. Ticket price was reasonable and it was enough time to walk and chill out.
,,Head up.,5.0,,"Not to be missed,gives you views of the whole area.Well worth paying the extra ,but your scared of heights I would avoid."
,,Nice view,4.0,,A great place to get a view of the gardens. The photos are worth the $8 you pay. I would recommend at least doing one thing where you get a view of the gardens.
,,Music Magic,4.0,,"When they lit it up in the evening, It is extra ordinary. And lighting with music is out of the world."
,,Top of the super tree,4.0,,Visited the top of the super tree before having dinner to have a drink. Great views all around and a nice play to relax and chat.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Make sure you visit the Supertree Grove -especially at night when they are all lit up and do a laser light show to Disney music. We also had dinner in one of the trees - expensive but out of this world -
,,Most Magical Show Ever,5.0,,"Light and music show every night starting at 7:45pm lasting till 8pm, then another an hour later. I stumbled upon these gigantic AVATAR-like trees on the other side of the Mandalay Bay Sands hotel. I saw these trees and gardens the day before from high atop the Singapore Flyer ferris wheel. So I decided the next night to go explore and I'm so glad I did. SO what happens, is, there are around 15 huge, tall trees that light up and change colors while music is being played. I didn't do any research about this place beforehand which was a nice surprise. As I was taking long exposure shots of the trees the music began. They started playing Disney songs and the trees came alive. Now I'm a HUGE Disney fan, so to me this was very magical. Great for all ages, if you like that kind of thing. Not all the songs were from Disney movies, but you get the idea. Overall I'd say you MUST experience this show while you're in Singapore. Hands down!"
,,Rip-off,2.0,,"In a beautiful horticultural park, they build these monstrous ""trees"" of metal. Then they charge you to go up and see the view!"
,,Stay for the Lightshow,5.0,,"We spent almost a day at the gardens, and these structures are very practical and magnificent. The light show we caught as we finished our day and we were glad we didn't miss it - simply awesome."
,,Fun (but short),5.0,,"I understand the need to limit the visit ""up the trees"" to 15 minutes, but it really is too short! When you wait almost an hour and then have to depart 15 minutes later, it just seems unfair."
,,cool view at night,4.0,,"i Was lucky to see the garden rhapsody show they have twice a night. The trees light up and change to the music, very enchanting. u need to pay extra for getting up there. but the view from down is also great,"
,,Free evening light show,4.0,,I liked Avatar so I enjoyed walking around these supertrees. I also enjoyed their 7pm light show with the Marina Bay Sands in the background. I would have loved to go up one of those trees if only I had the time.
,,Suggest you to go there in late afternoon,5.0,,"Don't miss the skywalk and the display of light and sound. I would like to suggest the visitors to go there in late afternoon around 6:30p.m. for three reasons. Firstly, it is too hot to walk under the sun at daytime. Secondly, the visitors can have look of Supertrees with and without lights. Thirdly, the first session of the display of light and sound starts at 7:45p.m."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Was able to see the garden rhapsody show they have twice a night. The trees light up and change to the music, very enchanting. The treetop bar is a must do. $18 entry fee but that includes a free drink at the top. Recommend going at night as the views are also spectacular with a direct line of sight to the marina bay sands lit up in all it's glory."
,,A must to do,5.0,,What a lovely time we had there waking the skywalk . Very easy to use and very good something quite unsusual.
,,amazing trees,4.0,,"Like in wonderland, surrounded by lights and vibrancy. Many tourists and even locals come here for a walk after meal."
,,The walkway oh great!,5.0,,We went there in the morning time. We were quite rushing in here and almost decided not to spend time around this part too long but we were happy that we could spend time to walk on the walkway around the Supertree Grove. The view of the Marina Bay is just absolutely wonderful and great memorable. Highly recommend here.
,,amazing,5.0,,"Visited Supertree Grove during the day to get a good look at the magnitude of this attraction, it's a truly beautiful setup which will make you say 'wOW'.
Don't forget to take the lift up the main Supertree so you can walk the Skywalk, fantastic view from up top too.
Later that evening my wife & I returned for the Supertree Grove Light Show which was fantastic, light show lasted 15'minutes (free), & displayed a sensational scene of lighting from within the Supertrees.
A must do whilst in Singapore.."
,,Different Disney,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is a wonder. Engineeed bionic/botanic mixture gives towering giant 'trees' which have all sorts of living things it supports. At night, the main grove is the sight of a musical light show that delights kids and some adults. Music changes seasonally. The 10 meter high circular walkway between the 'trees' provides another perspective [that part is for a fee]."
,,Supertree Grove - Beauty at its best!,5.0,,Can't say enough great things about the Supertree Grove. What an amazing place. Beauty at its best. We visited in the afternoon and stayed on till the evening to watch the symphony of lights at 7:45pm which is not to be missed. We watched it from the lawn area to see all the trees light up. The best part is its FREE. The only entrance fee you will pay will be to go up on the walkway which you shouldn't miss for a small fee of $5. We loved it so much we visited twice during our week in Singapore and were lucky enough to see two different shows due to the Chinese New Year.
,,It's free - its awesome - wow wow wow wow !!,5.0,,"We knew there was a free sound light show at quarter to the hour and watched this from a viewing platform not far from the MRT at twilight... very impressive !

Then we went for a wander intio the park - just to experience the area at night. We had no idea there was another sound light show and it happened as we were sat in the Supertree grove.

What can one say ? WOW !!!!

It's only 15 mins or so but it is absolutley awesome !

There is a genuinley magical feeling to this - Im 51 and this brough out my inner 6 year old.

You have to see this to believe it !

Go at night - sit or lie in the grove and let it happen - its superb !!"
,,Great to see day or night,5.0,,At night these are lit up with a couple of light shows each night. Well worth a look by day and night. There is a tree top walk which you can do which is also worthwhile.
,,super tree grove,5.0,,"Oh my heavenly stars, awesome, wonderful, spectacular, if you can visit then is got to be on the bucket list GO at night, GO to the main superstructure park and be prepared to lie down and be enthralled, this night i will never ever forget."
,,Amazing Supertrees free night show,5.0,,Seeing the light and sound show of the Supertrees is not to be missed when visiting Singapore. While my girlfriend and I did this as part of a tour anyone can come and see the show for free. The music and the lights on the trees were fantastic and everyone listened and watched in awe.
,,Beauty of the Night,5.0,,"We had done the different features of Gardens by the Bay and had decided to dine at one of the many food outlets there to see these structures come alive.
We were not disappointed as they started to glow once the sun set and their colours became more intense as the night darkened.
Their beauty lit up the night sky and they appeared to be alive.
Great photos of the city scape in the background.
To complete a fantastic experience stay and wait until after the goes down."
,,"Very good, but spoiled by bad weather ...",4.0,,"Yes, it is true - these structures are fabulous, and have been beautifully planted with nearly 163,000 orchids, ferns, and other plants covering the trunks - and I was glad to have seen them as they didn't exist on our last visit to Singapore ten years ago. There is nothing quite like them. However, I would definitely recommend trying to pick a day to visit when the weather is settled, even though that's difficult in Singapore. We had earlier visited the two big domes where, being inside, the weather didn't matter, but when we arrived at the Supertree Grove, we found that the aerial walkway was closed because the weather was stormy. We'd come to see the trees both in the daylight and also to catch the light and music show but literally the second the show started, the heavens opened and the rain fell in sheets. Everyone dashed for cover and we ended up in one of the nearby restaurants where, I'm sorry to say, the food was less than impressive. By the time we came out it was dark and extremely wet underfoot, so we didn't linger.

The view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel at night is extremely impressive if you walk back from the supertrees to the Bayfront MRT station over the little footbridge across the Dragonfly Lake - like walking into a Star Wars film set!"
,,In love,5.0,,"I was so amazed when I visited this place. I did it during the night and it seemed like a dream, so surreal, so beautiful. I felt in another planet."
,,A must see at night when in Singapore,5.0,,"Awe inspiring show here twice a night. Lights, lasers and music. Free too. What more could you want."
,,You must come here at night,5.0,,"This is an amazing place. I especially love the display at night. The air is cool and the trees light up beautifully. The musical show that gets put on every night is also pretty amazing. I love to lie down, and just watch and listen.

The only downside is that it gets very hot. Maybe in a couple of years when the trees have grown so there is more cover, it will be more pleasant during the day."
,,big trees,5.0,,This tiny country state is at its best building up these man made attractions!! Come for a tree top walk!!
,,Nice view from the top,5.0,,"Lovely lovely lovely! Am afraid of heights and for the sake of my 6 year old son, I did it :) Enjoyed the complete beautiful view or Garden By The Bay."
,,Artificial Can Be Beautiful Too,5.0,,"You can see it from a distance, a funnel like structure covered in green, a vertical garden connected by sky bridges. When it is lit up at night, it looks like a city out of a sci-fi movie. This is a place I like bringing my foreign friends to wow them. The free laser light show adds to its appeal. I like the open air bar on the biggest Super Tree, that gives a bird's eye view of the entire gardens, the Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands, and the city skyline."
,,"Ok during the day, better at night",4.0,,"This short stroll entails a walk across an elevated walkway between some of the artificial trees in place within Gardens by the Bay. It's ok during the day, but you'll likely get more out of it at night once the lights come on. You can still get decent pics of the surrounding area from this spot during the day, but it gets hot in the sun.

Walkway is not very wide, and if you have a stroller it's possible it won't be allowed. Lifts are available to take you up to the walkway from ground level."
,,Spectacular Light Show,5.0,,2 shows a night - 745 and 8:45. The trees are very well lighted and the show put together with music is very well done. We sat on the grass by the food mall as suggested by friends who went. Very glad we did as had a great view.
,,futuristic,5.0,,"you can see it at late afternoon hours and stay till evening, whey they light it. somethig diferent then day view"
,,A must for any visitor,4.0,,This park offers a selection of sights to visit. Starting from the gorgeous Sands hotel in front of the park and including cloud forest and flower dome. The trees are also very beautiful and you can take a stroll on a bridge connecting two of them. This is definitely something you should see if you are in Singapore.
,,Must do,5.0,,"Visited at night when all the supertree safe lit up and there are a couple of shows put on with light and music. Was really great to be there and see that.
We had a drink in the indochine open roof top bar which is at the top of the biggest supertree. Was 18 sing dollars entry including one drink which wasn't bad by local price standards. There was also a restaurant one level down and indoors but we didn't eat here.
We also went on the skywalk which was only 5 dollars and a good place to get photos from.
I'd recommend doing this attraction after dusk."
,,Worth seeing the sound and light show!,5.0,,DO NOT MISS THE SOUND AND LIGHT SHOW. The combination of music and the dancing lights is a very soothing experience.
,,"Evening attraction, not to miss...free entry..",4.0,,It is free for public and tourist.. Fees applies for cloud forest & flower dome. Plus skyway walk... We visited the garden on 6th March in afternoon before check in to Marina bay sands... The evening show was awesome.. We visited the show from Marina bay sands from our room on 43rd floor... It was just classy from upper floor.. We enjoyed the show a lot... Plus Marina lighting show was also miraculous...
,,Avatar feeling,5.0,,"This is a must when you visit Singapore. The show is twice each night, and it is amazing! Lie down under the super tree and enjoy the music and colors!"
,,Do it twice,5.0,,"Add it to your waterfront walk during the day but then go back at night for a gentle 'performance' - spectacular. The Skyway looks good but we ran out of time to do it. Entrance from the Marina Bay mall is easy, as is the short walk from the MRT station."
,,what a garden,5.0,,"wow what a garden! There was amazing light show at 7.45 pm! no need to pay for the ticket, garden is free of charge."
,,Do the Skyway walk,4.0,,We spent the 5 each to do the skywalk and it was totally worth it. It looks kind of lame or boring but it was great. The view is amazing and I loved how the walkway is suspended and moves as people walk on the skywalk.
,,"Beautiful, especially at night",5.0,,"This is a must see attraction if you are in Singapore. We went on a night bus tour and were able to see the sound and light display at night. It is such a wonderful experience with so many people who come to watch, so be early to get the best spot. Also pay the S$ 5 to walk on the skywalk for some great views."
,,Garden Rhapsody Supertree show,5.0,,"7:45pm and 8:45pm each night the supertrees come to life with a light show set to music that is not to be missed. Just in front of the central tree there is a large circle imprint in the footpaths around the tree, this is the spot to throw down a blanket or lay your head on your pack and have the best view! So worth the visit at this time. Then take advantage of the spectacular photo ops around the Gardens with the MBS behind and the supertrees lit up for the evening."
,,Something different !!,5.0,,"Another ""have to see"" attraction in Singapore, especially the evening lights show. Plenty of cafes near by for evening meals."
,,Good one but not a big wow,4.0,,"These man-made trees will surely catch your eyes on the first sight but eventually its not something you would feel a big WOW ! Ultimately its a tower-like structure, only comes at a giant size. The best time to watch them is at the evening during the daily light & sound show; when they come alive.
Good for a relaxing time if you want to take a break from the busy city life."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Th nightly show is free and one of the most amazing light shows I have ever seen. It brought chills to my skin and tears to my eyes
,,beautiful at night,3.0,,you can see supertree grove even you not pay money but you will have to pay more time cause you have to walk go to center of gradens by the bay and it very big!!
,,"Man made ""trees""",5.0,,Best time to visit is in the evening when these trees are lit up. We definitely recommend seeing the light show choose a bench nearby or spread a blanked on the grassy area near the trees. We also went up for the tree walk. You'll have a wonderful view of the gardens and the surrounding area. Good for taking pictures
,,must-do for everyone!,5.0,,"one of my favorite places in Singapore, a definitely must-do for someone who is visiting the country, even on a short trip. The trees can be seen well from a distance, but walking underneath them is a magical experience that you don't want to skip. The lighting for the supertree grove is provided by the solar power, and that's really cool as well. I hope we'll have some similar structures in Europe soon!"
,,Supercool,4.0,,"This place is awesome! Make sure to pay a visit when it gets dark - after 7:30.
It is busy during weekends, but still super fun.

When it gets dark, they light those trees up and they are so much fun. During our stay there were also light/music shows in this trees and that was awesome!"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,A lot of cities could learn from this attraction. Incredible. The night light show is fun as well . Very popular.
,,Youll need a head for heights,4.0,,Basically this is just an aerial walkway which gives you some great views of Singapore. But it's not that large and doesnt take very long to traverse. However its only $5 (Singaporean) so hardly expensive. Dont do this if you dont like heights.
,,superb,5.0,,"go at evening and bring along a camera cause you wont stop taking a picture .,..the view is superb..stay to join the musical light show at the ocbc skywalk"
,,"Great by day, fantastic at night",4.0,,The Supertree grove is part of the Gardens by the Bay. The trees are manmade wrapped in flora but beautiful in its own way. It is worth paying the ticket to get on the skywalk that provide a treetop view of the gardens around the grove. It is not recommended for people suffering from vertigo. You take and elevator up one tree and walk on a suspended bridge spanning several trees. You take an elevator down another tree. They limit you to about a 30 minute duration in order to accomodate the people in the queue. Best take the skywalk when the weather is not so hot. A return visit at night when the skywalk is closed as the trees are lit and the crowds are no longer around. The best time to take night pictures.
,,Lovely,5.0,,Its worth visiting this place during late evening.... Its near Gardens of the bay around 10 mins walk. There is light show is beautiful...
,,Nice structures with cool lights,4.0,,"Walking in the gardens by night was a good experience, the ""trees"" are nice and really set the mood."
,,Spectacular structures that lit the Singapore skyline!,5.0,,"You will appreciate the architecture and enjoy the view, walk and visuals you see at the super tree. The park around the tree are beautiful and was thought thru for all. Always full of people especially when the garden festival is held there"
,,Nice panorama over the Gardens,5.0,,"These modern man made trees can be found around the Gardens by the Bay but in the middle there more and connected with a bridge you can go through (5 S$). They collect rain, control the climate around them and powered by the sun. The trees present beautiful sight from down but the perfect panorama you can get is from the bridge. The entrance fee is really low and an elevator takes you up so handicapped can visit it too. Don't be scared by the long queue! We were told it's 45 mins long but was up in 15 mins. The trees lit up by night and have a little light show."
,,Excellent !!,5.0,,This is an excellent venue to visit around 06 00 pm when the daylight is fading. You get to see both the day view as well as the lighted up supertree grove. The show at 07 30pm is a must visit.
,,Night time,5.0,,"A night time visit is a must,Magical for adults and children alike The lights and music wow.You will not be able to do it justice in your photos.I found my husbands iPad took the best ones."
,,Amazing light show at Supertree Grove,5.0,,WE visited at christmas time and there were a lot of people around to see the show. All the lights on the trees lit up in time with music being played. It was quite an experience and seemed to handle a lot of people which was lucky. Very clean and well organised.
,,Super tree grove- worth the visit,5.0,,Take the elevator and walk the bridge among these artificial gigantic trees and enjoy a spectacular view!
,,"Beautiful area, some beer specials",4.0,,"Went there on an afternoon/evening, to walk around and see the trees and the evening light show. Waited for dusk enjoying some of the beer happy hour specials in restaurants there, then enjoyed the music/light show."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Super grove part of Garden by the Bay. Amazing to see these structures and lean about their purpose. Best viewed up close and from the top of the Singapore Flyer outside the park.
,,Will never tire of it!,5.0,,Saw the light show from the ground last year - watched it from our room at Marina Bay Sands this year. Which ever way you see it it is superb.
,,"Does not live up to the media hype, watch at night from afar.",2.0,,"Best avoided, just viewed at night as a pleasant synchopated ilumination from the Marina Bay Sands complex."
,,Shut down because of high winds.,5.0,,"Unfortunately, they had to close the aerial bridge because of high winds. But I'm 75% sure this is free to walk to. Amazing pictures!"
,,Nice night entertainment,4.0,,The super trees are located close to the Marina Bay complex. It is better seeing at night during the light and sound show performed at 7 PM.
,,Don't miss it!,5.0,,"Unusual area of metallic trees with nightly light show set to music..all for free! Set in beautiful gardens and well worth a visit, then cross over to Promenade for the laser show at 9 pm."
,,"Different, modern, interesting",5.0,,"An exercise in sustainability, it's different, modern, interesting and worth a visit. You can go up and round a walkway (not sure if there's a charge for this). at n night there's a lightshow, but I didn't see this so can't comment on it."
,,See it by day but DEFINITELY see it by night,5.0,,"I walked around the supertress during the day. They're impressive. You can go up & walk around at their top level (I didn't do this) and you can even go and have a drink/meal up at the top of one of them (didn't do that either). All it takes is money :) But I did return and see their night show. Sure, it's touristy and a little cheesy...but I LOVED it. Put to music, it lasted only about 15 min or so but I could've stayed for much longer. The weather while I was in Singapore was very cloudy and seeing all of the color of these tress was a welcomed sight."
,,It is a heaven,5.0,,It is very beautiful at night. You will feel like you are in a heaven. Bring a good camera with you. You will love it.
,,Impressive area of the gardens,4.0,,Very nice 'arty' garden area with high walkway and treetop bar area if you fancy something to drink. Good for a view and picture opportunity - an obvious place to visit when at the bay garden area.
,,Delightful!,5.0,,"There light and music show is called the Garden Rhapsody, and it starts at 19:45 and 20:45 daily. It is beautiful, with the music blaring and the supertrees dancing in light. If you want to go up to the OCBC skyway, I would suggest you start queue -ing early, because they have a weight limit, and can allow only a few people up there at one time. Also remember that the latest you can get tickets to the OCBC skyway is 20:30. By all means do it, the view was so worth it!"
,,Super views from the walkway,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is wonderful. I have been a couple of times, and you see things that you missed on previous visits. If you have a head for heights, do the 22M high walkway. At the very least catch one of the free nightly sound and light shows as they are excellent."
,,Super tree grove rocks,5.0,,We got there at night and in time for light show. We walked from merlion to the supertree grove. It was a great light show while we lay on the ground. What an experience!
,,Nice,4.0,,This area is free for everyone..one can jus go this place and relax..there are light show arnd 7:45 which ine can enjoy..it's a soulful and a beautiful place..sure to do while on a Singapore trip..
,,Supertree Rhapsody light show amazing.,5.0,,We went twice to see the light show Rhapsody. The first time from above at the Marina Bay Sands Skypark and the second night from the ground. It was amazing.
,,Nice park,5.0,,Take some minutes to walk in this amazing park. Very interesting to walk around and look at all the flowers.
,,Yeah must,5.0,,In Gardens By the Bay this place has a fee entree and some time restrictions also like you have to buy the ticket by 8pm.. One would love to be there on the top and feel the wind flowing.. They allow only 15 minutes for everyone and it is just lovely being there on the top and view the skyline of the city
,,unique,4.0,,watch it goes live at night with colorful lightnings and lovely songs. shows is (if still the same) every 7:45 and 8:45
,,Not much to do.,3.0,,Not much to do but nice to see while in the area. Other attractions are the main reason for most people's visits.
,,Beautiful during the day and at night,4.0,,"The Supertree Grove is one of the areas of Gardens by the Bay that can be accessed for free. The supertrees are huge and even more beautiful when lit up at night. There is a aerial supertree walk (entrance fee required), but it was closed due to weather when I visited."
,,jan 2016,4.0,,"amazingly designed it may not be worth to go up and go to expensive resturant. the view changes for light show, must see use MRTS sply after the show."
,,OCBC Night Symphony,5.0,,"I saw lot of people gathered around supertree grove, and i decided to wait until 7PM to see the live music show. The show was really well done, the sync between the lights and music was perfect. They featured some popular instrumental music to be showed off, one of them was Gee by SNSD, so unforgetable.

Admission fee is free for Supertree Grove, but they'll charge you 5 SGD for OCBC skyway. To get there, you can either take downtown line or circle line MRT to Bayfront and then take a 10 minutes walk to Garden by the Bay."
,,Better than imagined,4.0,,"With the day-light the place is just amazing. From the top you can see all green, and you have a whole picture of the Marina Bay hotel. But after walking around, at evening they play a spectacle of music and lights under the tree grove that is really worthy. Reccommended to see the whole during the day and at night."
,,Totally worth coming here especially in evening,5.0,,Came here with my wife and was totally worth it. The walk on the SuperTree was packed so we didn't end up going as there was a long queue. The views from underneath was quite good but the main thing was the light show in the evening. It was totally worth waiting for the sun to set and the lights to come on. Then the light show was even more spectacular which made it worthwhile. Does take a fair amount of walking to get here but do it. The park sells drinks and ice creams on mobile stores which was quite smart of them.
,,Very unique,5.0,,It's a very magical experience especially when it gets dark and trees are changing their colors. It's a lot of fun to walk around.
,,Amazing tree design,5.0,,"These trees have unusual design. Very sophisticated and spectacular. In the night, there are schedule of amazing light performance. Free. Will come here again with kiddos.."
,,worth it,4.0,,"great view, great air and great company. i wanna take my family here.i love to spend my evening here. it was awesome."
,,Magical!,5.0,,"Interesting stuctures by day and amazing by night! Watched the free light show one evening, which was wonderful...I felt like a child again, totally mesmerised! Would highly recommend an evening visit, whatever your age!"
,,Return to Paradise,5.0,,The last time I went here was 2014 and the gardens have really grown up. It looks fantastic now with much more maturity to the flora and shade for those hotter days. We watched the light show and it was very good... and free! A relaxing evening and easy to get to via Bayfront MRT.
,,As if I'm in a scientific novel,5.0,,"This is the highlight of Gardens by the Bay for me. These giant Supertrees look like they’ve just popped up from a fantasy movie.

I've been to this place many times, but I think the trees look most beautiful at night, when the lights are on and they look as pretty and mysterious as ever, shining glamorously on the dark background. I remember visiting them during Christmas time, they came alive with lights, which turned on and off playing in tune with Christmas songs. Hundreds of people sat on the floor, singing, cheering after the songs.

You can go up (with a fee) the 22-metre-high OCBC Skyway that connects two Supertrees to look at the garden from a higher position, though I don't think it's useful since you can see not much further."
,,its a wonder.,5.0,,its really most beautiful supertree grove specially at night.just infront of Gardens By the Bay.its a must watch.
,,Worth the price,5.0,,A wonderful short walk up the supertree. Ticket is about $5 for the walk but you will enjoy the whole experience. Great scenery up there. Not suitable for those who fear height.
,,Nice and modern park,3.0,,This park is very modern as function and also as city garden. They build this city vertical garden supported with great lamp tech. At night this garden give you amazing light show
,,Supercool at night,4.0,,"Amazing place to watch at night. Avoid the crowd, see the trees with an amazing background with the Marina Bay Sands hotel!"
,,Great free night activity,4.0,,"We took the MRT and walked the rest of the way to this area to catch one of the famous light shows. It was short but very impressive! I'd recommend getting there a bit early to make it up onto the bridge, or get a spot on one of the benches around the trees so you can lay down and watch the show. There are two shows (7:45pm / 8:45pm) every day."
,,Not to miss,5.0,,"Something never seen before! If you are scared of heights maybe not advised. 5 SD well worth it. At night go see light show, free at 7.45pm"
,,Nice garden creation,5.0,,The amazing garden and the Super trees have been created well and maintained well. You can spend a nice evening herre with family. A one off its kind in the world and a must see.
,,Supertree with the Lights,3.0,,This Supertree is located near the entrance of the gardens by the bay. This area still free for public. The interesting is when night time this tree will full of lights and very nice to be a backgroud for taking picture
,,Go at night for a visual delight!,4.0,,"I've visted Supertree grove at night and the day and prefer the night.
There's light-show each night when each of the trees lights are displayed.
You can eat in one of the restaurants in the trees or at the food hall within the same area.
During the day it's worth doing the tree walk for a great view of your surroundings.
I suggest you start at Marina Bay Sands for a look and then walk down by the river to Supertree Grove.
At Christmas the area turns into Christmas Wonderland and is a ""must-see"" for any tourist or local."
,,Astonishing architecture and great views,5.0,,"This area will amaze you. It is beautiful during the day as well as after dark. The lights and light show give the supertrees a fairytale look.

Walking over the Skybridge is a must-do (costs only SGD5). Try to be there at sunset. The views od the skyline are gorgeous then.

It's also nice to go up to the roofterrace at the highest tree. It's nice for the views, the breeze and to relax.
Negative: it's expensive and as a bar its quite useless and disappointing. Expensive watery drinks, not much choices."
,,Gardens by the Bay main attraction,5.0,,"Those trees are the most interesting in the Gardens by the Bay complex. They are vertically planted with species from all around the world.
They're totally free for visit, as well as for the fantastic sound and light show every night. Be there around dusk, when they lit up."
,,Great light and sound show,4.0,,"Come towards sundown when it's cooler and you can walk around to appreciate the attractions. End with the light & sound show, which is the highlight of the visit."
,,"Nice, but hot...",4.0,,"We visited during the day and heat the certainly hindered our visit. Be sure to have water with you and if you have a small umbrella that you could use as a parasol it would help. This is an arrangement of metal tree structures and gardens. For an additional fee you can go up to catwalks that take you between a few of the structures which gives you a nice elevated view. The structures are covered with plants at their base. Be sure to take time to really look at the plants, they were spectacular. This must be great at night when the trees are lit up."
,,Avatar in Singapore,5.0,,"I spent hours there, being completely fascinated by those trees. The best time is when the sun starts to set, as there are few people and MANY seating opportunities. Benches directly underneath the trees, or small chairs under a tree pointed towards the trees...
It is a good place to just hang out (but don't stay there by yourself too long after it get's dark, the place starts feeling creepy and the way to the metro is quite far) with friends, have a picnic etc."
,,Very Interesting,4.0,,"The Supertree Grove has 12 ""tree"" structures. They are between 25 and 59 meters high. They have plants along their trunks. They all have lights and are more dramatic at night. The grove is free. There is a walkway between 2 of the structures which costs $5."
,,Heights and views for the vertigo tolerant,4.0,,"at 22m above the ground the platform walk amongst the trees is great fun. it cost $5 SGD per person to get up there but worth it.
the views are great, the trees themselves are interesting combinations of concrete, steel and flowers.
the layout of the supertree grove provides excellent views of the gardens and the Singapore skyline.
allow at least an hour to wander through the grove before heading off to other parts of the wider gardens.
highly recommended."
,,Amazing and unusual.,5.0,,These supertrees are a sight to see. Well worth a visit--especially at night when they have colored lights. There also is a musical number where the lights change to the music. Kids and grownups alike will love it. Do go--
,,WOOOOOW!!,5.0,,"That's the best place I visited in Singapore. It must be number 1 on your tourist attraction list. Amazing atmosphere, the show was incredible and stunning, I felt like I was on the different planet. Excellent and educational experience. Great spot for photographers. Highly recommended!!!!!"
,,Amazing! Amazing!,5.0,,"So cool! Be sure to visit here at night for the light show. It's magical and inspiring and makes you glad to be alive. I kept thinking, ""There's no where I'd rather be right now than here, watching these crazy trees twinkle."" Also, it's free. Wahoo!"
,,Amazeballs x100,5.0,,mindblowing - go at night for the light show - its all free and very very big to explre the whole garden - the trees are way bigger than I expected and if you want to walk on a suspended bridge between them - it costs $5 - long ques to go up though. there is also a restaurant in one of the trees - crazy!!!!
,,Supertree Sparkles,5.0,,"We visited in the gardens on a Saturday afternoon, and it was surprisingly quiet. The observation walk wasn't running due to storms that had passed earlier in the afternoon. The trees are quite something and add to the futuristic feel of Singapore.

We went back to see them at night, and luckily caught the 'Garden Symphony'; a 15 minute light and sound show where the trees sparkle and change colour with the music. I believe this happens at around 7.15-7.45pm every day. Well worth seeing."
,,It's a tourist trap,3.0,,"Look its very spectacular, you can't but be impressed by the engineering but having gone into the tree top bar, it's pretty tacky, but what can I say, I'm in love with the gardens themselves, I really love walking around them, truely beautiful."
,,Our hotel room view.,4.0,,We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel and our room overlooked the Supertree Grove. We had a great display every evening when the light and sound display played. We also visited the Grove in the evening to watch the free display. It is spectacular and Great for the kids. Not to be missed and it's free too.
,,Spectacular in the evening!,5.0,,Take a walk around the area and be amazed. Same time peaceful and modern. From top of the Supertree is wondering wiews in the evening towards the city skyline.
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"Beautiful place either Day or night. Night time is better as you see lightings. There is also a beutiful view of Marina Barrage and Marina Bay sands from here. Easily accessible by Taxi, MRT and buses."
,,Simply impressive,5.0,,"These giant trees are really impressive, and look amazing. They are quite the architectural and gardening feat, and are located in really nice gardens. Tip: if you want to go on the hanging bridge which connects two of the supertrees, go early, otherwise you'll stand in line for hours."
,,another gem at gardan by the bay,5.0,,this is combined with thecloud in the skyand the garden .the walk way is only £2. but the garden are free
,,Amazing light show,5.0,,"What a view at night from the Barrage! After wanding from the barrage through the hawkers market for a quick drink and into the grove of SuperTrees, all I can say is WOW!! They are stunning."
,,Beautiful and its all free,4.0,,this is a wonderful depiction of the dragon blood trees in Yemen. There is a free nightly light show available. Do check out the timings for the light show to avoid disappointment
,,A must visit when you are in Singpaore,5.0,,You must check out the light show! Its beautiful! If you are there you might as well pay $5 Singapore to walk across the bridge! The view from up there is beautiful!!!
,,Fantasy at Night,5.0,,"Lights, music and colour. Be sure to attend the evening sound and light show. Get there early. Music coordinated with dancing lights."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This should definitely be higher on the To do list ranking. It was breathtaking! Better to go when it's dark and the trees are illuminated so lovely. You need to buy the tickets in advance and we stayed for about 1 hour in a queue until we went up, but it was definitely worth it. One of the best things in Singapore! And also very cheap!"
,,Don't miss the light and sound show (15minutes),5.0,,The whole gardens are very nice. The preferred attraction we like with my kids was the light and sound show at the big artificial garden trees. It lasts 15 minutes. It occurs twice per night: 7:45 pm and 8:45 pm. And please note the access to this show is completely free! There is a big area with grass where you can install ourself comfortably.
,,THIS IS FUN BUT YOU MUST LIKE HEIGHTS,5.0,,"An elevator takes you to the top of the trees, form there you get a great view of the gardens. It fun, but it is up high."
,,"Weird, but definitely an example of what man can achieve.",5.0,,"Went to the Supertree Grove on a rainy day, so it was pretty empty. We took the elevator to the restaurant at the top (I think it cost $18 and included a drink at the top), so we had a great view of the approaching storms (and we kept dry!)."
,,A great night out.,5.0,,"Loved this attraction, a must see at night as this is when you see place light up. The tree were lit up and music was been played as well.."
,,Best after dark when these trees are wonderfully illuminated,5.0,,"If you have a chance, get there on a weekday after dark. There won't be too many visitors which gives the whole area a fairy tale look."
,,Skywalk is closed,4.0,,"Sad.. Because it's raining, we can't climb the sky-walk/bridge between super-trees. But it's a beautiful structure, indeed!"
,,Do wait for the night light show,4.0,,"Best time to be here perhaps around 7.00 pm, where you can wait until the light show started. Find the nice spot to watch."
,,Excellent Sound and Light Show at the Supertree Grove,5.0,,"You should definitely plan to see the sound and light show at 7:45 in the evening at the super tree grove. The OCBC sky walk is overrated, but you may get a different view from OCBC sky walk during the sound and light show. So plan accordingly"
,,It's that different experience similer to the movie avatar,5.0,,One of the nicely built items inside gardens by the bay. You can take a walk in the surrounding area or go up the trees in the lift for a few bucks and take some nice pics where your friends would i want to go there.
,,Amazing experience,4.0,,"This was a must see for travellers going to Singapore! The trees were a sight for sore eyes and you just can't stop taking photos of them! Definitely check out the restaurant at the top of the super tree as the service was great and so was the food!

Good day for families to take a stroll around and take family photos with the amazing super trees."
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,This is worth the visit. Make sure to pay the extra $5 per person to go up on the elevated promenate in the trees! Also make sure to stay after dark to watch the Rhapsody in the trees music and light show
,,"Okay, now THIS was fun!",5.0,,"I've done the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest twice before, but this last visit was the first time I've been in the Supertree Grove. It is absolutely worth the price. A quick elevator ride (or stairs) brings you to a narrow open air walkway with magnificent 360 degree views."
,,Super Special,5.0,,"Well worth the visit . Enjoy the sky walk for $5, take in the views. The light and sound show was brilliant."
,,i enjoyed this way more than i thought i would,5.0,,"the explanation for what is actually occurring here (environmentally) is pretty confusing, but i totally loved walking through these unique structures, and on the suspended walkway."
,,WOW !,5.0,,"Have seen these structures in photos but to see them in person has to be for me a wonderful experience , highly recommended !"
,,Highlight of the entire trip for our 6 year old,5.0,,The Super Tree Grove was an equal first with the Eiffel Tower for our daughter. We loved the Skyway and were lucky enough to be on the Skyway for the fifteen minutes of the Garden Rhapsody show. We queued for over an hour for our turn on the Skyway but it was very pleasant watching the sky change colour and the trees light up. It didn't feel like we were waiting. We loved the Garden Rhapsody so much we stayed another hour to watch the repeat show an hour later. My daughter wanted to go again the next night but we didn't have time. Well worth visiting.
,,Fun for children,5.0,,Great time there but more so for children. This is located in the same area as the gardens in the bay/Marina. A visit to the tallest tree a must where there is an open air bar. Numbers to be up to the bar is limited as it not a massive area. Access to the top by lift then stairs. Not for wheelchair!!! Great view for photos day and evening. Closes around 10pm
,,Must visit!,5.0,,Really beautiful place with an awesome light show. This is a must visit when you come to Singapore!!
,,Light and Sound,5.0,,"A good area to explore during the day but at night ,excellent with the Light and Sound presentation ,not to be missed"
,,SUPERTREE GROOVE,5.0,,One of the highlights of Gardens By The Bay are these Supertrees.. Extremely Tall Steel structures... They look much better in night than day.... Buy a Skywalk ticket and experience walking at a height with splendid view from top.
,,Must see,4.0,,"Great garden in Singapore, shows what the city is all about: impressive stuff. Be sure to enjoy the sound & light show every night, it is truly impressive."
,,Best at Night,4.0,,The grove really does come to life at night when they glow brightly. It feels like you're on a different planet!
,,artistic,4.0,,"during the daytime when we went there it was calm and peaceful though a lot of tourist and locals are coming and visiting the place for recreational activities. plants are well maintained, surroundings are clean. during night night, very colourful lights, it boost up the beauty of the super tree, we had a lot of photos taken during that time of visit. accessibility of the transport is very good by the time we are getting home. the super tree grove is a fine art of creativity, extravagant and awesomeness!"
,,to be seen by night!,5.0,,"we liked this in gardens by the bay! we have be lucky to enjoy rhapsody at 7pm which is spectacular show of lights and music. we climbed the tree, and for me bridge was little bit scary, but i knew it is safe."
,,Great to vist during the Day. Absolutely stunning at night with the light show,5.0,,I marked this as not sure re a charge. You can walk around the base of the trees and watch the light show but you need to pay to ascend the elevated walkway between the trees and it is this vantage point which is best to watch the light show from. During the day you can see the trees and the construction as you walk around but it is at night that they come into their own. We walked over from the Gardens Domes and paid to go up and watch the light show from on top one of the trees. The trees light up and change colour during the light and sound show. We then walked out on the elevated walk way between trees to get different views as it winds around. There is so much to take in and definitely worth the money. Getting back at night was relatively simple as we caught a taxi from the rank just outside. Some people tried to jump cabs as the entered the road in which was just rude. We ended up sharing a cab which was cheap as chips. Just a wonderful way to end the day at the Marina Bay area and will remember for ever
,,"SImply the best,",5.0,,"Do not miss this. Amazing, superb, stunning, jaw-dropping. Need to go see it a couple of times to take it all in. Like fireworks in neon - beautiful colours changing and blending in time to the music.. Made our holiday."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,Simply inspiring - although some people did wonder what the stylised trees were. Lots to see here so take your time. I got a taxi here after a far too short a visit through a tour operator.
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"As part of the Gardens by the Bay this is a must do. The views are spectacular and as usual the structure is absolutely amazing. It was a little disconcerting when the walkway moved and if you have a concern with heights you may not like the experience, particularly as the floor is see through in places, but if these things are not an issue then get on and do it for 5 Singapore Dollars. The night time light show is also a must see."
,,Visit it at night,4.0,,"This place must be visited during the night as there is a night show of lights that makes the trees and Grove come alive. Take a walk up the skybridge, there is a fee, and view from the top of the trees from a different perspective."
,,The light show is a must!,4.0,,There is a free light show with music every night at 19.35. It was well worth doing. Also a very interesting place to visit in the day if not to hot.
,,Tarzan hahaha,4.0,,"I like how they made those Supertrees, how relaxing to just look at those structures, and just seat at one of their benches."
,,A must to see,5.0,,"Extensive man made gardens that have a lot of activities and attract a lot of locals. Excellent facilities, transport,
attractions and a range of food outlets. We went in early December and enjoyed the 'Christmas Lights', music and even fake snow. Spectacular at night and as the attractions change it is worth considering on each visit to Singapore. A great way to meet the locals and to see something unique."
,,Stunning!!,5.0,,"The Supertree grove is magical. We visited in time to see the light show and it was amazing!!
It was so beautifully done you just didn't know where to look next... Trying to take it all in you just felt a little kid again... Love this garden so much can't wait to visit again"
,,Witness the Wonder....,5.0,,"This is part of Gardens by the bay, best time to visit this location is evening, walk on the bridge and witness the light show, its mesmerizing, you cannot effort to miss this place in Singapore, light show is free of charge."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"An amazing place. Combining great architecture with natural plants and flowers, the view is stunning. Walk along the paths below the grove, there are lots of places to sit and take in the surrounds, or pay $5 and walk along the elevated platform. Great views from here. At busy times, there is a time limit of 15 mins on the elevated walkway. However, when we visited on a Saturday afternoon, there was no waiting time or time limit at all. The views are amazing from the walkway. Go at night and see the light show in the groves. Well worth the visit."
,,Great vibe,4.0,,We were fortunate to be travelling over the festive season and so were privileged to watch a show of lights in the grove on the 18th December 2015. It added a lovely touch to the very Christmassy feel of the city.
,,Garden by the Bay,5.0,,Worth a visit and plenty of photos can be had here .It can get very busy and hot you can do tours and by your self .
,,A MUST SEE,5.0,,"Though these are metals, the structures were peppered with plants, ferns and vines. It also harnesses solar energy to simulate how real trees function. Be sure not to miss the show at night. It will blow your mind!!"
,,Must see when visiting the gardens,5.0,,Just stunning - covered in plants including some beautiful orchids. Worth paying $5 to go up to the Skyway but it's worth noting that you go up in one lift and then down in another so once you have walked along the Skyway you are not allowed to go back for more photos.
,,Breath-taking and Beautiful- go to the bar!,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is nothing short of fantastic. These ""Avatar Trees"" are always breath-taking, but we particularly enjoyed them at night. Pay $18 for an elevator ride up to the top of the tallest Super Tree, enjoy a beverage of your choice and also enjoy one of the best views of the bay! Make sure you also check them out during the day and try to get a ticket up to the sky walk. Unfortunately, the wind was too strong when we visited and we were unable to use the pedestrian walkway."
,,It's ok,3.0,,"Quite a nice view, but not many photo or viewing opportunities, quite dull if you ask me, although at only $5 you might as well go if your in the gardens"
,,Really Super Tree,4.0,,The iconic Supertree Grove at Gardens by the Bay are Singapore's pride. The huge tall trees are covered by layers of plants and had concrete tops. It is an example of vertical gardening. Beautifully grown and well maintained. They are photographer's delight. They look different at night with different colours of lighting. I could not stop clicking the camera.
,,Another great sight,5.0,,Another area one should look up and learn a little about why Singapore built and put them up. Worth seeing while at the Gardens by the Bay area.
,,Modern take on trees,5.0,,"The constructions are a really a wonderful visual work of art. The plants are rapidly growing up the structures and will look really spectacular when all the structures are covered. The walkway between 2 of the trees is worth the $5 for 15 minutes. We didn't venture up the restaurant at the top of the largest tree, due to lack of time, something to do on our next visit."
,,Wow,5.0,,"After your tours, you should go to this place, wonder of wonders, you will love their Super Trees, at night, they lit up the place, nice to watch those colors, really be sure you have your cameras with you!"
,,Nice and great. Must visit in SG,5.0,,One of the attractions where I definitely will bring my friends who visited to Singapore. The night view is great especially on the OCBC skywalk.
,,Blew me away,5.0,,"I dont like heights but managed to survive, just. Got up to the top just as the evening music and light display started, incredible experience and so lucky to have done that; loved it."
,,Marvelously Breathtaking,5.0,,"Make sure you reach here by 7.45 p.m or 8.45 p.m as it will be a music show called the OCBC Garden Rhapsody and you can see the Supertree come alive with the lights. You can just sit there, watching the show and snap lots of pictures or just enjoy the spectacular view."
,,Super-forest by Day and Night,5.0,,We spent a great day at Gardens by the Bay and decided to wait till 7.45pm for the Supertree light and audio show. From our vanatge point the audio was inaudible but the light show on these huge structures was fantastic.
,,Tip: viewing platform in the evening is best,4.0,,"Nice place to visit. it will be more impressive in 5-10 years when all the vines, trees mature. They viewing platform is not great during the afternoonr but at night looking back at Singapore skyline its very nice."
,,Evening lights and show,5.0,,"The evening lights show was amazing and the lights twinkling in the trees was very heart warming. The music and folk songs played in combinations with the lights was a humbling experience. I would recommend staying around the bay area for the show.
Note: experience can be diminished by the large overseas tours and loud tourist kids running around and screaming at the lights and parents screaming back to not run. Recommend you pick a quieter spot away from the main seating area if you don't want the memory tainted."
,,Unique and pretty,4.0,,"This is a nice free option to see a beautiful garden with unique ""super trees"". There is a nice view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, a waterfront with fountain, and a fairly big garden."
,,Great view,5.0,,Great view overlooking the Gardens by the Bay and to Marina Sands. S$ 5 entrance fee is worth the money.
,,Such a wonderful sight,5.0,,Situated in Gardens by the Bay and its best attraction. I recommend visiting both at day time and night time to take photo's. During the night the supertree is illuminated and looks amazing.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"A highlight of the 'Gardens by the Bay' theme park is the Supertree Grove - made up of a collection of huge Cyborg trees, situated in front of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Each Supertree is interwoven with vines, ferns and flowering plants which weave through the skeletal structure. There is a skywalk between two of the trees - but we opted out as it was too hot, and enjoyed the view up from the ground. Reviews suggest that an evening visit with the lights lit up is magical!!"
,,See and Go,4.0,,"There isn't much to these things. It is part of the Gardens on the Bay, so you can do that too while you're there if you enjoy looking at plants. It looked like people could go on top of the super trees, but I did not attempt to try."
,,Memorable city view from the top,5.0,,"Prepared your camera to snap every angel that really beautiful. We can see the Singapore flyer, flower dome, marina bay, and another iconic building of Singapore. Well maintananed lift that give an easy access for handicap, senior citizen, and pregnant women."
,,Perfect timing,5.0,,"when we arrived the queue was quite long to go up onto the sky walk, as they let groups of about 15 up at a time. We purchased our tickets and watched as the sunset and the trees came to light. our timing was perfect as our group was on the sky walk for the light show...amazing! For an amazing view of the city go to the bar inside the tallest tree, there is an admission fee...but for the cost you get a drink to enjoy while you up there. we loved it!"
,,An icon in Singapore - worth the visit,5.0,,"One of the nice spaces in the Gardens.. you get nice views from the bar in one of the Supertrees, but it costs.. The trees themselves are very striking, particularly when lit up in the evening, the canpoy walk is worth doing as there are great views to the city."
,,Mesmerizinggggg,5.0,,"A day light visit. The trees were amazing. The garden was very clean & comfortable. It were a very spacious place, you can opt for shuttle service for only SG$3 per person for unlimited rides."
,,Excelent views,5.0,,"Once in the gardens you must climb to Supertree grove, it costs 5sgd per person but really worth it. From the bridges you have excellent views from the top and all around."
,,Canopy walk provides great views,5.0,,"While the tress themselves are very striking, particularly when lit up in the evening, the canpoy walk is worth doing as there are great views to the city."
,,Absolutely worth a visit,4.0,,"The December School holidays gave us a fair bit of time to visit different attractions.

The arrival of the Christmas Wonderland gave us a good excuse to visit the Supertree grove and we went over a couple of times.

The parking lot was fairly full both times owing to the holidays.

The Christmas Wonderland had a few interesting rides and games for kids but the draw was clearly the super trees.

Entry to the walkway is very well managed and is restricted to a few visitors. The tickets are sold by slots and run out very quickly. Entry is also closed during inclement weather.

An elevator takes you to the walkway and the view of Singapore as well as the rest of the Gardens By The Bay is simply superb. We went at dusk time and were fortunate enough to not just see the light up (beautiful) but due to the presence of the Christmas Wonderland, we were able to see the lighting in sync with music from Frozen.

Well worth the effort and wait."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"We took the City Tour from the airport because we had several hours of layover. I'm glad we did. We saw so many beautiful things. One stop was the Supertree Grove. The trees were already lit up for the evening. Being there just before Christmas, they had music and a light show that was just fabulous. Hope to some day come through Singapore during the day so that I can do the tour again and see the trees in day light.
Beautiful. Something for everyone to see."
,,Wow!!,5.0,,Come dusk and the Supertree Grove started lighting up. The lights are amazing and the flowers also seem to shine that are on the trees.
,,Magical,5.0,,"A very busy Boxing Day night, but such a delight to see all set to music & lights. Now want to revisit in the day."
,,Amazing Man made trees!,5.0,,"Part of Gardens by the Bay, the view of Supertree Grove is breath taking! Especially in the evening, there are light shows - wherein - all the trees are lit up and they play a story of changing seasons.

Lighting is spectacular and you would want to capture in your eyes everything that you see!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is a very cool area, and shouldn't be missed. There is so much to do in the area, so it's likely if you're planning a trip to Singapore, you will see this area by default anyway. We really enjoyed it at night too when it was all lit up."
,,Simple yet Brilliant,5.0,,These beautiful structures were a delight to view from our room at the MBS. They are colorfully lighted each night. They also have a canopy walk between the trees for a small fee.
,,So beautiful at night,5.0,,Don't miss this - so beautiful particularly at night time with the gorgeous lighting. We caught the MRT there and back and was no hassle at all - nearest train station is Bayfront. Great for families - even with teenagers! Loved it and was definitely a highlight of our trip. Highly recommend :)
,,whilst at the park,5.0,,Amazing to see these iconic super trees both by day and night. the are something else and have plants growing u them.
,,Visual treat at night!,4.0,,"Supertree groove is beautifully lit up at night with the shimmering lights and music show in the evening. We missed the Skywalk around the trees, but this place is definitely recommended for a night visit."
,,Musical Show Daily,4.0,,Garden by the bay - Supertree Grove is always one of the place that I will go if i am there at night. There are some performance happens there where you can enjoy it. It is FREE so that is the best part. I always quite impresses of the architecture of this area. Do visit here is you are in Singapore. It is worth the walk.
,,Stay for the 8PM show.,5.0,,"Spectacular looking assembly of tall treelike structures. Quite unbelievable the first time you see it and walk through it. They are used in supporting the growth of different plants among other things.

There's a Skyway suspended between the trees that one can go up to and walk for a small fee. Sunset would be the best time to go but the lines get progressively longer as the day goes on. The lines were so long by that time we sadly just didn't feel like it was worth it (though you definitely should go any other time of day).

The whole place is lit up during the night in a soft blue glow. There is also a daily light show happening at 8PM with all the trees lighting up to the tune of music. Again, the best place to check that out is the Skyway if not for the lines.

There's a restaurant up top, but it's overpriced and there's a cover fee. You can do without."
,,An inspiring place to visit,5.0,,There is so much to see at this particular attraction - indoor glasshouse domes with beautiful flowers and waterfalls as well as the outdoor 'trees' with the skywalk. You pay to go into the domes and the skywalk however the gardens themselves are free to go into. It was well worth visiting all aspects of the attraction - paid and unpaid. Some amazing views from the Skywalk around the 'trees' - you just pay 10 Singapore dollars and take a lift up to the walk area and then walk within those fabulous man-made trees - fabulous.
,,A must-see in Singapore!,5.0,,"We decided to go and spend a few days in Singapore when we saw a picture of them in a magazine, and in reality, they're even better! During the day, while they're clearly fake, they seem to be a natural part of the landscape. Real plants use vertical garden grids to climb up on their sides, while a sky walk-way connects a few of them 30 metres up in the air.
But they become really magical at night, when the lights get switched on, and they change with music - absolutely magical! I'm not a kid, but I felt like one when I saw that... really really nice, if there's one thing you can do while you're in Singapore at night, that's the thing to do in my opinion!"
,,Go for the Christmas Wonderland,4.0,,Went for the Christmas Wonderland to be held till 27th Dec and the lights and facades are on till 3rd Jan. Expensive but Worth it esp for the kids. there are carnival rides and games. Snow show nightly. this is all held near the Supertree Grove
,,Tree walk,5.0,,A great walk in the tree tops coupled with the rest of the gardens and cloud forest. Need time to appreciate all aspects of this area.
,,"Nothing special but since you will visit gardens, this comes with it",3.0,,"I did not find anything special at this place but since people visit the domes and the garden, this could be considered complementary. Remember they don't turn on the lights if it is raining so rainy day will ruin this attraction. Nothing special anyways."
,,Very nice show,5.0,,Went there for the evening show. Very good place to spend some time. The markets are nice too. Although it gets very crowded and takes longer to go to MBS etc in peak hours.
,,Amazing show starts at 7pm,5.0,,"Booked a night tour of Singapore on Viator. It included the musical show of Super Trees.

It is amazing the lights and sounds make it so relaxing and absolutely mesmerizing. Its free so there is no reason not to see it if you are there. The show starts at 7pm though I am not sure if it happens every day. Do a bit of research. You will Thank me later."
,,Amazing Light Show,4.0,,We went in the evening when it was lighted up for Christmas. Beautiful lighting. And the Light Show was a unique experience.
,,WONDERFUL SUPERTREE GROVE,5.0,,"Supertree groves have supertrees, which are tree-like structures in Garden by the Bay with heights ranging from 80feet and 150 feet. The Supertrees are covered by ferns, vines, orchids and other plants. They are fitted photovoltaic cells to harness solar energy that is used by the Supertrees themselves, for lighting, and collection of rainwater for use in irrigation and fountain displays. There is an elevated walkway, between two of the larger Supertrees for from where one can enjoy a view of the Gardens. At night, the Supertrees are lighted and a music show is held."
,,"Fantastic, Esp at Night",5.0,,This attraction is definitely worth going to as it is so different! Evenings can be busy especially at the weekend it is very crowded but the Supertrees are lit up and there is a light show (every hour I think)
,,"Good view, but...",3.0,,I didn't know that I had to stamp the time to be up on the sky walk. So l waited for my round about 2 hours without doing nothing.
,,Novel green technology,5.0,,"Not only are they pretty to look at, but these super trees also act as both solar and rainwater collectors, as well as regulate air flow for Cloud Forest and Flower Dome.

The area itself is free, but taking the lift to the skywalk costs $5. I only wish I had seen the grove at night, as I hear the lights look better than during the day. Definitely worth the visit if you are already in the Gardens by the Bay area!"
,,Very cool night and day.,5.0,,"Located at the Gardens by the bay, the super grove trees are most impressive when all lit up by night and are definitely worth a visit. It is free to see them."
,,Super tree grove,5.0,,This is also a new attraction . They have made big trees with lovely flora and faurna from different parts of the world . At night it is beautifully lighted . It is really heaven made on earth .
,,Steel trees? Can Do!,5.0,,"Loved these trees. The huge steel trees dominate the skyline and have a futuristic feel. The walkway connecting some of them really allows you to feel 'in the treetops' and you can even visit a bar and have a drink in the trunk of one of them. At night they come to life with beautiful coloured lighting, creating a very romantic scene. Visionary and original."
,,Best At Sunset,4.0,,"Happened to come across this attraction at sunset. There are anumber of reclining chairs set up in a strategic position for you to sit, relax and watch the light and sound show that unfolds at sunset."
,,A must visit!,5.0,,"Go visit the gardens first, follow by this, the best time is around 6.30pm to enjoy the sun going down & the lights transformation . It's like Magical Land! The changing of lights is so beautiful in the night!"
,,Interesting -- Go at night for the sound & Light show.,4.0,,"This didn't look like much during the day, but as you can see from the photographs, it's a different matter at night. It can be crowded (be aware of possible pickpockets) but is a beautiful sight.

I'd say that it's worth an hour of your time.

Hope this review helped you to decide how to use your time in Singapore!"
,,Worth the time and leg-work,5.0,,Spend time and hours of leg-work to explore this beautiful landscape with immense offering of plentiful flora and greenery sightseeing.
,,Nothing much to see and do,3.0,,Nothing much to see and do. We visited during the Christmas wonderland celebrations and the decorations were good. THe OCBC skyway was closed due to bad weather.
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,A must visit place. Great concept and great ambiance. Nicely built and lit trees... this is something which a lot of us would not have seen before. It's an experince in itself which cannot be explained in words. Go for it.
,,Our Honeymoon!,5.0,,I took my wife to see the Christmas light show at the Supertree Grove. The trees where very impressive. The light show was very good. Well worth a visit.
,,Giantgantic,5.0,,This a magnificent whether you walk on the skyway between the structures or just walk down through them and seeing all the different views of the Supertrees. If your a photographer seeing all the different angles you can take photos of the structures. It magnificent whether close up or from a distance. Great especially since it free unless you go on the walkway which is very cheap.
,,Very impressive,5.0,,"We had a bit of a smoggy day (Indonesian forest fires), so the views were not great, but we really enjoyed the grove. Very impressive structure and concept. The walk between trees was amazing. A definite attraction while you are in Singapore."
,,been here 3 times,4.0,,"been here three times and i like it, my 4 yo toddler also loves to see the surroundings from above, he doesnt even scared. good maintenance makes us feel safe. must visit!"
,,Must see during the day and night,5.0,,"Excellent venue and its for free, beautifully landscaped. The ""trees' look stunning during the day and turn into 'something else' at night, it is just magical specially during the light shows.
There is a small fee to walk on the suspended bridges that connect the trees which i am sure is spectacular, however we opted to get one of the deals for the restaurant located in one of the trees, which gets you up to a viewing platform and includes a free drink in the restaurant which you can consume either inside or outside on the wraparound veranda."
,,EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL AND ENCHANTING,5.0,,best place to go to for any reason and any season. however i love going in the evening most as the spectra of lights and colours lit this beautiful place like a magical scene from movies. the light shows are free and amazing. must must go !!
,,Very different,4.0,,"Spectacular in it's design, view from tallest tree was good. Really need to visit this at night when it is lit up"
,,Beautiful and free,5.0,,"It will take you some time to walk it all and there are no shelters, so do it on a dry day. The light and sound show and the trees is beautiful and also free. One show at 7:45 pm and another one at 8:45 pm. There is a metro station at the entrance which takes you to a transfer station."
,,light show!,4.0,,"This 'grove' of gigantic faux trees is remarkable by day but truly beautiful by night. The free lightshow (twice nightly) is a highlight. We viewed the lightshow twice, once from over at the Marina Bay Sands, and once from directly below the super trees. Both provided great views and different perspectives."
,,Very Green as our guide would say,5.0,,These trees are disguised water tanks! Also there are solar panels.They also light up to special music at night. The Singaporans know how to go green!
,,Impressive,4.0,,"This place is truly magic..it is unique! you can spend easily half a day walking around...there is access for bikes, wheelchair,,,etc I would highly recommend."
,,Looks Great in Lights,4.0,,It looks great in the lights. There is night show there where they change lights of these column and play some music. The show is free and get crowded so it is recommended to get there in time and get a good spot. There is a walking bridge connecting these column. I didn't took it but it get crowded around in the evening (There is ticket for the bridge)
,,excellent,5.0,,"went there to see the show, it didn't disappoint.. and it was a special christmas edition so the song was christmas song.. you better come early to find a place to sit with the best view..

the best view in here is when the flower dome is behind you.. you sit / lay there, you can see the trees above & in front of you without any distractions"
,,Surprisingly Spectacular,5.0,,Without realising the show we were in for we completed our tour of hte Marina Bay gardens and were walking back to the Bay proper when the spectacular light show commenced - we stood quite mesmerized for about 40 minutes.
,,be the last entrants at 830pm,5.0,,"By being the last group of the night, you get to experience the light & sound show of the trees while being on the elevated walkway!"
,,Unique Idea,5.0,,These are artificial structure made which looks like tree and there are many such are made. It is looks beautiful. There is restaurant in the center tree which at height gives you different experience. This look more beautiful at night with lighting
,,An interesting twist in a botanic garden,5.0,,These man-made trees are wonderful to see and cleverly compliment the beautiful gardens. The garden's are free but you can walk up amongst the Supertree's on the skyway for a small fee (weather dependant) which is definitely worth doing just for the views!
,,Love it!!,5.0,,First of all I want to say I really LOVE IT!!!! the tree is so beautiful. And full of light. When I came there there was a light parade in there
,,Brill!!,5.0,,"Loved this!! Great views of the garden, very cheap. Limited to 15 minutes and seems to be no restriction on how many people they are willing to cram in to a very small lift at one time. Worth it!!"
,,Worth it,5.0,,"For just a few dollars you'd be mad not to do it, just for an alternative view of the gardens its worth it."
,,Pretty interesting!,4.0,,"Interesting and definitely a must see, but don't have to spend much time. The 7:45pm light show is pretty good and something to see at least once. The OCBC Skywalk is OK long que and they only give you 15 minutes time on the skywalk and they herd you along like cattle."
,,A worthy addition to your GBTB visit,5.0,,"For a $5 entry fee, you can't go wrong! Amazing views (we did it in the day time). Absolutely Magnificent!"

,,Super tree,4.0,,"The large garden have one day for walk in Supertree and easy walk to the shopper @marina bay sands which indoor have many shop for shopping, dining etc."
,,Need to have a head for heights,5.0,,Walking across the top of the garden is a great way to see the gardens. Combined with a visit to Gardens by the Bay is a good way to spend the afternoon
,,Engineering Greatness,3.0,,"As with everything in Singapore the Supertree Grove in the Gardens By The Bay is an engineering and design masterpiece. Not only are these ""trees"" superb structures in their own right - they also collect rainwater and provide solar power for the Gardens.

The suspended walkway is an excellent way to see the Gardens from a nice height and provide great a great photographic platform.

An integral part of the Gardens and worth the small admission fee."
,,Nice at night,4.0,,I think this is best at night. The tree lights turn different colors. They also have a light show at night. I think it's daily with music.
,,Magical,5.0,,If this is the Bay then its a must visit at night!!! the light and music show is amazing! and Magical..... such an experience and very professional! beautiful!
,,Mesemrizing,5.0,,"Wonderful to watch the beautiful man made creation. The pathways, lighting and plants make the place rich and stunning. The light show at night is worth enjoying. carry water and snacks."
,,Innovative and Creative design,5.0,,Scale of trees is enormous. night lighting very impressive with changing colors set to music. Easy access with good walking shoes
,,Part of Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,The Supertrees are amazing and as the flowers grow around them will become even more beautiful. It is worth doing the Skywalk to see the views over the gardens and beyond.
,,You must go at Night,5.0,,The trees are all lit up at night and it is a glorious sight There is a light show and than the trees stay lit all night. Its a free activity and not to be missed
,,Amazing vies of gardens and bay,5.0,,"Arrived approx 6 pm, had to queue foe 30 mins, by the time we came down queue a lot longer, can only stay on treetop walk 15 mins, fantastic"
,,See it at night,5.0,,We went to the supertrees both during the day and at night. At night they have a sound and light show which is well worth seeing.
,,Wonderful place to see!,5.0,,By day it is amazing but wait and see how alive it becomes at night. A great sight for children to watch and run around on the grass. There are dinosaurs etc which also light up and move! Fascinating for big and little kids.
,,Skywalk is amazing,5.0,,The skywalk is amazing and need to go in the evening to have a wonderful light and sound show. Worth of money.
,,Definitely Need to Do the OCBC Skywalk,5.0,,"The Supertree Grove is definitely worth a visit, especially the OCBC Skywalk. It cost only S$5 to take the elevator up to the OCBC Skywalk. Although being 22 metres above ground, I didn’t have any problems walking around on the OCBC Skywalk despite my fear of heights.

You get a different perspective of the Supertrees while walking on the Skywalk. Despite the haze, I could still see the Singapore Eye and downtown Singapore."
,,Stunning Supertrees,5.0,,"Gardens by the Bay has great features built up over reclaimed land.
The Gardens add a new dimension to outdoor life in the City State.
The Supertree Grove is spectacular, beast seen at night and with great irony and thanks to the smog from the Indonesian palm sugar plantation fires, there was an added unearthly feel to the forest.
The night lights and shows that are on at 7.45pm and 8.45pm are great, best times to visit unless on a clear sunny blue sky day (and with smog around, there is no guarantee of that).
Stunning!"
,,Fascinating,4.0,,"The Supertree Grove is a great attraction, and a fascinating piece of art, botany and fun. It is free to walk through, but the Supertree skywalk costs $5, which is worth it. You have great views over the park, Cloud Forest, Flower Dome, Marina Bay Sands, etc."
,,Part of Flowers Dome+Cloud Forest trip,4.0,,After done those two places. We walked around this area which was quite nice designed. This area is free for visiting. After 7 p.m. will light up and more beautiful than the day time.
,,Really cool!,5.0,,"The coolest structures I have seen in a garden so far! The ""attraction"" doesnt take very long but its a must when you visit the gardens!"
,,One of the most happening place in Singapore,5.0,,"You should visit this from late afternoon up to night. They got a light show, it is a must see, really cool. The lights, the setup, all the atmosphere here are just really good to have an experience with. You can go up to the OCBC Skywalk (5$ / person), do take that chance, they only allow you 15 minutes up there, since the bridge has its limit to hold. This is a must see if you're in singapore. They got a restaurant to nearby at the top of the tree nearby."
,,Out of this world!,5.0,,"Wow! I could be here everyday! Free light shows every night at 7:45 and 8:45. Take Bayfront mrt and walk through the tunnel of mirrors. Up the stairs or use the lift. Go to the right to walk around the water. Take the tree top walk for $5. It doesn't matter how many people are here, there is enough room for everyone. Wait 5 or 10 minutes after the show and you will miss the elevator crowd. When the show starts it transports you to somewhere else. It is AMAZING! There are different shows so you may not see the same one. Take a walk around and see the floating baby, walk along the water and see the dragonflies. Go at dusk so you can see the different looks of everything. Cannot go to Singapore and not go here! We loved it!"
,,Night light show is best,4.0,,"the tram/ bus for the park doesnt run at night, but seeing them all lit up makes it the best time to go."
,,Transition from Day To Night Is Best Time To Visit,4.0,,"You've seen all the reviews describing the uniqueness of these trees. Actually, I wasn't even going to bother to be honest. I really hate big congregations of tourists! But against what I thought was my better judgement, I headed to the Supergrove later in the afternoon. Why was I not interested? My thinking was why look at fake trees, when real ones are what time and energy should be put into. But then I found out that these fake trees, actually burn off all the green prunings each day from the gardens, which is converted to power, harvested and used at the two domes in the gardens. So I figured that was sustainable! And no smoke is emitted into the atmosphere. Once twilight starts they supergrove starts to light up, so great to be able to see them evolve from their daytime look, to evening wear! Glad I went and stayed for the light show."
,,STUNNING!!!,5.0,,"Visited Gardens by the Bay at night time and these supertrees are just beautiful. Photos dont do it justice. The musical light show was breathtaking, i loved it. Truely beautiful! A must see, especially at night time when lit up! :-) Glad my sister and I made a last minute decision to come down here!"
,,"Sparkly, shiny and pretty!",4.0,,"I visited the Gardens by the Bay Area to catch the twice nightly light show offered FOC around the Supertree Grove Area.
A really pretty show, lighting up the trees to music and giving a great show. I got some really great photos and video and because it is free, you can go anytime. Not so crowded during the week so would really recommend."
,,Super supertrees,4.0,,Super tree grove is wonderful. I like to go and just sit there reading my book. You get a better view if you walk across the bridge from the Marina Bay Sands hotel - particularly at night from where you can watch the light show. It's also fun to watch from underneath. If the weather is Ok you can take the walk between the trees - the won't let you up if it's windy
,,Outstanding,5.0,,The super tree structures are truly amazing. Never seen anything like it. It is an architectural masterpiece and and will be mind blowing when the plant growth has completely covered it. I actually think in its current state it is good to see so that you can see the design behind the concept.
,,Lovely spot at night,4.0,,It is lovely at night with all the trees lit up. Didn't go up as the queues were long. There was a musical light show at 8pm when I dropped by Singapore in early February. It may just be a nightly thing. Worth going to indeed
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,"Beautiful! Especially at evening or night! In afternoon it's nice to see the blue sky. It's a very big place, nice for walking around."
,,Garden near Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"Neat and green garden in center of Singapore. The garden kan be reach by stopping at Byfront MRT station. There is an underground to the garden or go off lobby at Marina Bay Sands Hotel turn left (about 100 meter), take a lift you can walk over bridge... better view and can take photo from there.
I think better go there morning or before sunset, where not to hot and giant tree will be light up."
,,Go up in the trees,4.0,,If you are going to the Gardens by the Bay you need to go up to the Supertree Grove. It is a nice and high walk with some nice views around. The trees are amazing andthe pictures are great. It is worth to pay some money for the entrance and go up
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I personally liked it at night since I am a photographer and the lights make for nice photos. The trees look like something out of a sci fi movie. The super trees act as water collectors, this water is used in the cloud forest and flower dome. We had to wait in queue for almost 45 mins to get on top. And on top we get only 15 mins to walk on the bridge. The view was nice to take some photos."
,,Highest point of Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,At the centre of Gardens by the Bay. If you go to the top (there is a fee as its a restaurant & bar) you look down even on the Sky Walk. Great views of the gardens and beyond.
,,different experince,3.0,,a different experience to see. good for photo taking but nothing more must be expected. You will see a different thing but nothnig more
,,Must see both day and night!,5.0,,"I visited both during daylight an nighttime. The Supertrees at night is a wonderful sight because it is all lighted up in different colors and at the 7:45pm, there was a Rhapsody light show. I took a seat in the middle of the Supertrees and was able to enjoy the full effect of the the colors and the music that accompanied it. During the day, it is impressive to see the plants and flowers that cover the Supertrees. I went up the Skyway during the day and there were only a few of us, therefore, we were able to take our time taking pictures of the Supertrees and the Marina Bay Sands. The queue for the Skyway at nighttime was too long and you can't really stay as much as you want.

Definitely, my favourite place in Singapore."
,,Beautiful and functional,5.0,,These trees are more stunning at night where they are lit up. They serve to break up the the concrete jungle in the background and some collect and store solar energy while others are exhaust for the conservatories. They are covered in living plants of varying colours to make each unique. Do take the OCBC skyway walk as it is worth the $5 sgd.
,,Absolutely Fabulous,5.0,,Went last night. Was really lucky to be on the Skywalk for the light show. The trees are amazing. A must see at night. Absolutely fabulous. Wish I could buy a miniature would make a great display. Well done to all involved.
,,Absolute must do for adults and children alike.,5.0,,"Wonderland. This is an absolute must do but go at night, its best at night and not as humid. Who came up with this idea. Visit in the evening when they do the light and sound show. It is spectacular and children and adults alike are entranced. It's free as well so if you want you can spend the extra to go up to the bar area. It's a definite to do this attraction, and the walk over from the Marina Bay Sands is incredible feat of engineering as well."
,,A spectace worth seeing twice or more,5.0,,"Good during the day but is warm and humid. But come back at dusk to see the trees light up for a spectacular show. Area light up twice a night, and you can walk suspended above the ground between some of the trees. Good enough to watch twice. If you stay at marina bay sands you can see this spectacle without leaving your room."
,,Free and worth it,4.0,,"We only visited during the day but heard afterwards that there's a nice light show at night. The park and trees allow for a very nice and interesting walk, all for free. We had a good time doing this."
,,Great free activity in the city,5.0,,"We visited the super trees twice, once in the AM to walk around and learn about the trees and once at night for the light show. It's really interesting learning about the trees and how/why they were made. The light show at night is fun and although short, it's great that it's free! It does cost money to go to the cloud walk but you can walk around the bottom and the park free of charge."
,,"Unique Experience, You Should Not Mix",5.0,,"Close to the MRT station, you can walk to the garden's shuttle bus which costs $2 and will take you to the shuttle bus station at the Flower Dome. You have to buy the tickets at the Supertree Grove ticket office as there are no combined ticket available to purchase at the Flower/Cloud Dome. If you are not scared of heights then the Skywalk ($5 fee) is definitely worth it. If not you can still admire the the vertical gardens,for free. A superb mix of technology and nature."
,,Amazing views and feats of technology,5.0,,Caught a cab to super tree grove . $5 each to Go on the skyway. Great investment. Cooler up there.wonderful views and colours. Singapore really is a garden. Def recommend to families with kids over 7 otherwise may be scared of heights
,,Breath taking views,4.0,,"Take the OCBC skywalk which adds another SGD 10 pp to access. If you fear heights, leave it. It does not add significantly to your trip around the bay garden experience. And is subject to weather conditions."
,,Superb and amazing,5.0,,This place is worth visiting many times. Next amazing attraction after the Gardens by the Bay. The OCBC skywalk @5 $ takes you very close to the bloom. Repeat at night also to see the light and sound show. Take a mat and lie down flat to prevent strain in the neck.
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"The place is unreal. Incredibly beautiful, great view. This place is alone makes it worth visiting Singapore. I am so glad we went there... The stroll from the top cost 5$ and is worth it!"
,,"Photos, stroll, family-friendly and restaurant.",5.0,,Catch the light show nightly. Visit Gardens by the Bay website for timings and special events/exhibits in conjunction with cultural festivals.
