,,One of Singapore's finest shopping mall experiences,5.0,,Suntec City is one of my favorite shopping malls in Singapore. Its a huge complex with a great variation in shops from known to upscale brands. It also houses several foodcourts including FoodRepublic.
,,Great experience at Suntec City Singapore,5.0,,I was on an official visit to Singapore and our offices are at Suntec City. The food court in Suntec City is really wonderful with a wide range. Shops are also cool. Working ambience at our office was ideal. Overall a good experience.
,,Motorcycle Unfriendly.,1.0,,"Be warned. Suntec slaps S$100+ fines on any bike parked in open unmarked/unwarned area. Even if it doesn’t have double yellow lines and other bikes are parked there already. If you can’t find a proper spot, best to just leave and find another more motorcycle-friendly mall."
,,Shopping complex,5.0,,"It includes a shopping mall , exhibition centre and office tower blocks. Regularly fair is being held here."
,,Good mall where u get good quality products in affordable prices,5.0,,Lot of places to eat and such a nice mall you can easily spend two hours just by looking at different shops
,,Lower end mall,4.0,,Stopped in here after putting my family on the duck boat. It's different than Raffles as it has more fast fashion and lower priced stores; still had some nice stuff though. If you are lodging in the area worth a pop in for the food court and some browsing.
,,Large and Mass market,3.0,,"This mall was spruced up a few years so it looks newer, but not more luxurious. Basically a mass market or family mall"
,,A very big mall,5.0,,"The mall is connected to the convention centre where periodically, there will be events like the IT show, travel show, etc. Many restaurants catering to many different cuisines on offer here. A great mall to spend at least half a day."
,,Large Shopping Mall & Convention Center,4.0,,"It has been years since I last visited Suntec City Mall and the place has been extensively renovated and looks very nice. The top floor of the mall is the Exhibition and Convention Center and below is the shopping mall.

The place is pretty big and quite long. There is an area called Japan Food Street with several Japanese restaurants as well as a local food court called Kopitiam which is where we decided to have our lunch and which was in fact really delicious. We chose a place called Curry Mixed Rice just beside the entrance that had constant long queues so we knew the food would be good, and it was super delicious and cheap and probably a good reason to eat here again.

The mall has normal priced stores but we did enjoy the Tokyu Hands store which we always visit in Japan. They had so many nice products that we almost bought, but later managed to find similar items at cheaper prices elsewhere.

This is a good shopping mall, but then in Singapore there are so many nice malls and many of them are better located."
,,Start discovering,4.0,,"A good place to start your holiday in Singapore as it not only has several towers full of amazing shops but it has the travel tour centre on ground floor to check out where you can go on day tours, boat rides, duck tours , hop-on/off bus rides etc. There is an exhibition centre to visit with various exhibits through the year, many food outlets and Fountain of Wealth in basement."
,,Lots of shops & good food court,4.0,,"We first visited Suntec Mall to pick up the Big Bus tour two day pass. We decided to explore the Mall and found a great range of shops and many food outlets in the food court. We ate at the food court a couple of times and despite it always being busy, table turnover was fast and the food selection and quality from the many outlets was delicious and good value for money. The mall was nice and clean and had good toilet facilities."
,,"The fountain is great to see, ideally via the shops and restaurants beneath",4.0,,"Very nice shopping area, full of cosy restaurants. The buildings are connected underground, making it easy to move around."
,,Huge shopping mall,4.0,,"This is a huge mall in the centre of the city & right beside the Fountain of Wealth, it is linked by four towers but can be a brain teaser to navigate, not sure what this one has that differs to the many others in this vast metropolis!"
,,Huge mall I'm the heart of the city,5.0,,"The Suntec City Mall is spread around 4 towers connected via passageways surrounding the famous Fountain Of Wealth. The top floors of the buildings house a lot of offices while there are a lot of hotels around it too and a huge convention center so there is a lot of foot traffic it gets really busy especially during meal times. There are many shops and brands not really high end, you'll find a lot of eating options here many restaurants, stalls and fast food places. We went there to go to the play areas housed inside there are 2 big ones plus some arcades and a few small play areas too. This is a massive mall very easy to get lost here but a fun place to walk around for a few hours."
,,Fun Mall to Wander Around,4.0,,There's a bunch of stores here so you won't get bored at all. There's even two arcades (Arcade Planet and Cow Play Cow Moo) if you wanna try for some prizes. Not to mention the abundance of food choices. It's four malls in one after all (all connected via passageways which is another feature I love about this mall). I think I found a discount store in this mall too which had really cute Sanrio stuff in it! Definitely plan to spend a couple hours wandering this mall.
,,Huge mall,3.0,,Suntec city hall is a huge mall that requires at least 4 hours or more of walking to see the whole place. There are 4 towers which are connected. It can be confusing at times to find your way in the mall. The mall does offer plenty of shops and eateries but it spread out so finding the right place to eat is bit of challenge.
,,Range of facilities is amazing,4.0,,This centre is huge. We met for drinks in one of the bars prior to going to the cinema. Sitting looking at the fountain chatting and watching the world walk by.
,,Lots of shops. Great air conditioning,4.0,,This is a huge shopping centre. All you expected big brand shops are in there. Some good places to eat. But the air con is amazing. Especially if you have just walked around outside
,,A Mall,4.0,,It is a mall. Shops are a good mix so everyone can find at least something. As the partial „city“ already suggests: This mall is huge.
,,Twice in a week,4.0,,"I went twice during my stay in Singapore and I liked this mall a lot.

I was impressed by how big it is and it doesn't look that big from the outside.

They have a huge food court where I got a natural and so tasty sour soup juice and it made me so happy, I didn't have one in years.

Among all the different stores they also have a supermarket and a medical center that I had to visit because I got sick.

I went there the first time by taxi and the second time I used the train, which I loved!"
,,Nice Mall For Most Peoples Needs,4.0,,We went to the Suntec mall a few times to catch the Hippo and Duck Tours. The mall has a nice collection of average priced stores and pharmacies and a really nice foodcourt in the basement (take the escalators down near the Krispy Cream Donuts). It is attached to other shopping centers so just keep track of where you are so you know where to come back too. It also had free wifi.
,,Nice fountain,4.0,,"Can access this mall from city hall using underground walkway. Great mall with loads of shopping options and discounted item sold in forecourts. Has the fountain of wealth which is quite nice to look at and it lit at night but we didnt see it. The burger place with graffiti around walls is awful - chewy burgers dripping in oil - not nice, but loads of other food options available."
,,Suntec City Mall,4.0,,"This mall contexts to our hotel Pan Pacific which made it easy to get food. We walked through the mall. Quite big, has a few branded stores. Was convenient for us."
,,Suntec city,4.0,,A building wonder. They can build anything that the mind things in Singapore. The waterfall is refreshing on a hot humid Singapore day
,,Massive mall with plenty to choose from.,4.0,,"This is one of the most modern malls I have visited. Packed with high end shops, classy restaurants and a large western like supermarket."
,,Cool walking thru worldwide brands 😊!,4.0,,"We took an afternoon to visit this mall, full of different brands and did some nice ! When you buy a shirt they even iron it if you want, what a gentle and exceptional service! The choice of goods is enormous and so worth to visit the multiple stores."
,,Mall,4.0,,"Another huge mall in Singapore. Jam pack with people. Seems like everyone enjoys shopping. Most of the shops are quite ideal to the other malls, but yet it is always full of people. Nice fountain as well"
,,All roads lead to the mall,4.0,,"At least if you want to ride on the large Hop On, Hop Off buses, then all the colored routes merge at this mall. Because we chose to ride these buses to see as much of Singapore during our rather short 3 day stay, we were at this mall several times. It has all the stores you'd ever want to go in plus plenty of others that you don't. I also appreciated the various dining options to small, stands offering one of two options to large, sit down dining. I ate the best steak in my life at this mall. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because after all, it still is a mall."
,,Musollah available,4.0,,"The only musollah here is the one at tower 3, beside singpost.It is opposite burger king.Telekung and sejadah all provided but must take wudhu at the toilet.I recommend taking at the handicapp toilet because it is easier.

The cleaner is aware of muslims taking wudhu so do not be scared of taking your wudhu in the toilet.There is a also a lower sink to wash your feet."
,,Another huge mall with plenty of options,4.0,,"For a tiny country like Singapore, it definitely has more than its fair share of larger than life malls.

This property comprises of a combination of one of the largest convention center in Singapore, commercial office towers, shopping outlets and many eateries.

It is located near to the popular Marina Bay area and is definitely an option for retail therapy and to feed the hungry pangs."
,,A Large Mall with many offerings....,4.0,,"This Large, diverse, centrally located mall has about 360 shoppes {divided into four (4) ""Zones"")... and is also linked to other malls and hotels--- BUT the ""signage"" could be more helpful. The construction took 5 years to complete and has been operating since 1997. In addition to shoppes selling almost everything, there are many places to eat interesting Eastern/Asian and Western ""food specialities"". There are also many different venues for ""entertainment"". In addition to the shoppes, there is a large ""office complex"" which also houses many Embassies. The Asian themed Architecture also follows ""Feng Shui principals""-- especially the ""Fountain of Wealth"".

I hope that this Review has been helpful."
,,Confusing mall,3.0,,If you are after a larger mall with a confusing array of stores this is for you. You can find better deals at Bugis or other places. Information resources do not give really good directions to stores or shops. I will not come back to Suntec. Too many other choices in Singapore.
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,We arrived here by mistake because our Taxi Driver misunderstood where we needed to be dropped off however our day turned very well because we got to visit another of Singapore's premier Shopping malls this place is awesome and full of quality shops and eating houses
,,Conveniently serving hotels in the marina area,3.0,,"Huge shopping centers with plenty of shops and great variety of food choices. It’s connected to other malls and hotels in the area by foot bridges. The mall doesn’t have proper signage showing the directions of the various hotels in the area thus it’s easy for visitors, who are not familiar with the direction, to get lost."
,,Good place to shop and eat,4.0,,"One of the nicer shopping malls in Singapore. Lots of shops and the food court sells delicious food, inc Chicken Rice and a good variety of juices. Also the hub of the HIPPO tours"
,,Near Hotels,3.0,,"We stayed at Pan Pacific, so this mall is really accessible by foot to every hotels within the area and near MRT stations
It’s huge and it can get very confusing, because one leads to another, you’d really have to pay attention to where you’re going to avoid getting lost.

We only actually went here to buy necessities at Watsons (way cheaper than the ones at the grocery) and to eat at Food Republic

There’s one food stall i would recommend at Food Republic,serves Chinese Cuisine at a very affordable price (sorry since there’s alot to choose from,i decided to eat what looks delicious to me and what i crave)
the food stall is called Chang Cheng Chinese Vegetable Rice.
for S$4-5 you’ll have a sumptuous meal, drinks not included

i also ate a frozen yogurt at Food Republic but that’s S$8 ,can’t really recommend that to budget travelers

BTW,i noticed that all food stalls accepts Credit not just cash and they really hand out receipts even without asking"
,,Very convenient but too large,4.0,,"We were staying at the Pan Pacific next door so this shopping mall became our defacto home base. It is huge, spanning a city block and has three wings based on three different directions. All the major brands are there and also some quirky ones like the anime/manga shop. There are also a lot of dining options from full service restaurants to a pseudo hawker centre. The only real issue is the huge size make navigating a chore and long treks from one end of the mall to the other if you are looking for specific businesses."
,,food and shopping,5.0,,Good place for food and shopping. Can be easily reached by MRT and close to many other important places.
,,Very convinient.,5.0,,Wonderful. Make sure you didn't missed to visit this place once you're in Singapore. Many things that you can do in here.
,,For all ages except those on wheelchairs,3.0,,"Everything was great, for all ages. I minus point on the long wait for the lift which is so far from the escalator. Abled body people chose to use the lifts with elderlies on wheelchair since the escalators are far away. We had to wait at least 15 mins, all trips were full with healthy people, my parents 1 on wheelchair and 1 on walking stick. Will not bring elderly there again."
,,Something for everyone,4.0,,"Compared to other malls around, Suntec City Mall is a just massive. The best thing it is houses a wide range of shops, apart from the usual brands like H&M, Adidas, Espirit, they also have a large numbers of specialty shops offering anything from street fashion to toys to watches. If there is something you need and only time for one mall, it is likely you will find it here.

The mall also houses plenty of F&B outlets, so you will be spoiled for choice and have no problem finding something to suit your budget and taste. On weekdays it can get very crowded during lunch hour due the surroundings office blocks, so do time your meal to either beat or avoid the lunch time rush.

The mall is also served by 2 train lines. So getting there is convenient (there are also plenty to shop and eat along the passage way linking the station to the mall too). Do not recommend driving although there are plenty of lots, the car park is a maze with multiple entrance and corners, and if you ever forget where you park, finding your vehicle could be a challenge.

On a whole, it is a decent mall for a whole family to spend a day."
,,Better know where are you planning to go,3.0,,"The mall is basically connects the four Suntect towers from its basement to level two. There are four wings correspondence to each tower. As the towers are circling the fountain at the middle, walking around the mall will take a long time. If you are to visit certain stores, would be wise to check first in which wing the stores are located to save time and energy. Another trick is to go to the basement level from which moving from each wing would be faster as the circle is smaller. You can go via Promenade and Esplanade MRT to go to this mall."
,,Wide selections,5.0,,Suntec City has something for everyone All sorts of shopping All cuisines for dining A supermarket Many specialty shops Quite a place for discovery and adventure
,,Good night out with a variety of food and shops,5.0,,"Suntec City is a really nice shopping mall, with a ton of food choices, variety of shops and even entertainment outlets. Must visit for those coming down to SG for a shopping spree!"
,,Lots of variety,4.0,,Loads of different stores. Everything you could think of. Very busy on weekends with locals and tourists.
,,Great Complex and base for a variety of tour operators,5.0,,"This is a major complex and designed with a focus on feng shui. It took 5.5 years to build, opening in July 1997. The shopping mall is extensive and has 360 plus outlets. There are also an exhibition and conference centre and office tower blocks, a movie theatre, video arcades, a large hypermarket and electronics outlet. We have visited on a number of occasions since 1997 and while busy, it never seems crowded, perhaps due to its immense area. The retail outlets cater to most tastes and pockets and it always seems that there is a feature sale or promotion. Likewise, the dining outlets cater for those looking to fine dining experiences to the customer looking to just grab a sandwich or burger. It is vast and you do need a sense of direction."
,,Complete & One Of My Favourites,5.0,,"All of Singapore shopping malls are very modern and well-equipped and Suntec City Mall is of no exception. In fact, it is one of my favourite malls. The shops are filled with what you need and you can virtually shop anything here. The food court and a strings of F&B establishments (especially on the top floor) guarantees that you will never grow hungry. Love it and I will definitely visit this mall each time I am here."
,,Expansive shopping,5.0,,This shopping complex has everything you need and more. Due to its sheer size there is a Carrefour hypermarket and a Harvey Norman. There’s a movie theatre and video arcades. Numerous places to eat as well. Two MRT stations are very close by.
,,"Love this shopping mall, great for eating and shopping",5.0,,"This is my favourite shopping mall at Singapore, probably because I have spent most of my shopping time here. I love the H & M store and all the different shops like Esprit and Nautica. I enjoy the frozen yoghurt in the basement part as it is gluten free and the Butcher's Kitchen for a quick and delicious dinner. It's huge so you have to really try not to get lost! The free Wifi is so handy as you are able to keep in touch with each other through Messenger."
,,We go for sake food n arcade,4.0,,"Not as convenient for us, but if you ask.. must say it got teo heng which is likw one of the cheapest ktv in sg, i enjoy their arcade. Jap food over there is good, triedost of the store i cant complaint."
,,Suntec - What an experience,4.0,,"A total must see while in Singapore - so many shops to see, so many different varieties of Food - easy access by Bus/ MRT/Taxi."
,,Spacious Mall,4.0,,"Of all the malls I had visited in Singapore, I enjoyed and liked the Suntec City Mall for its variety and spacious walkways.

It is one of the best malls I have visited anywhere in the world. The staff are very courteous and the type of restaurants and the variety food available at its food court are adorable.

Especially an Italian coffee and snack shop near one of the hallways is worth exloring"
,,Foodie Shopping Centre,4.0,,"We visited Suntec City Mall many times on our visit to Singapore the variety of eateries is really good we ate at a couple of Thai restaurants, the food was so authentic We loved it. Sorry I did not note the names.
The fashion shopping is good also. The location is a fifteen minute walk from Bencoolen it is where the Hop On Hop Off bus starts it’s tours."
,,Transport & Shopping Hub,4.0,,"I’m not sure about the Feng Shui design elements of this very large shopping mall, but I found it difficult to navigate on my couple of visits.

Just about every retail brand that you can think of is represented here and the food offerings are almost as extensive.

Clean, modern and air conditioned, all positives, but I’m not a person happy to just wander shops for endless hours so I soon became bored.

The plus side for me is that it is a significant pubic transport hub, including a number of the hop-on, hop-off buses which operate from the same precinct."
,,Massive mall,4.0,,"This mall is massive, and it is easy to get lost.restaurants everywhere, a lot of Japanese ones. There is a good choice for everyone, high end fashion with prices to march to the more urban variety at reasonable prices are scattered in the various wings of the centre.
To see it all, you need more than 1visit."
,,Excellent food options at fountain basement,5.0,,There is just so much food options around the foundation basement area. Great place for family with young kids. You can never run out of ideas for any occasion. Those who come to Suntec City mall will definitely need to check out the food options at the basement.
,,"Very large shopping centre, great location",4.0,,"Suntec city is a huge shopping centre, but the only one that’s really worth looking at in marina bay. There’s cinemas, most chain stores (hm, etc), and plenty of food outlets."
,,Make a Wish,5.0,,"Come By to Suntec and make a wish before you start for your Shopping spreed at few of the towers.
The Fountain of Wealth. Holding the wealth in the centre of Five Buildings resembles a Palm with Five Fingers.
Fountain was being build by geomancy Master to gather wealth for everyone. Walk one round and make a wish.
There is three timings for visit. Refer to the pictures.
Best time to visit is the morning and afternoon slot.
The evening slot is the most busier time of all due to the lightning effect given.
After that, you may wish to have your meal settled at the mall. From local to international cuisine.
There is also plenty of stores to shop in.
It can take a full day to walk as there is a few Malls link together."
,,Diggersite,5.0,,"My son was super happy! We went to yishun Park for the outdoor diggersite but it was closed on weekday. So we went to suntec instead. They had 2 contruction vehicles, and a fake sand pit. My son loved all of it.
The attendant girl there is very lovely and even helped me charge my phone.
I recommend this place."
,,Spoilt for choice,5.0,,"A great variety of shops, good restaurants, plenty of events and the Fountain of Wealth makes this a great stop, especially as the Duck and Hippo tours start on one side. Loved the frozen yogurt at Galare near the Fountain, a super way to cool off."
,,Quite A Happening Mall,4.0,,This is definitely one of the better malls in Singapore. The mall is quite packed over the weekends and you can virtually get almost everything here. There are many F&B outlets here too. It is also located very near the MRT station (Esplanade) and you can spend quite a lot of time there. Go and have fun.
,,The mall with all,4.0,,"This huge mall has everything from brand name stores to kids’ attractions, restaurants and travel agencies. Location of the famous Duck and Hippo visitor Centre."
,,Spacious with lots of varieties of shops,4.0,,"Has always been a place to go.
Tons of shops from anything and everything you can think of. Lots of food eateries in the 5 towers and lining the fountain itself.
Can easily spend a day here.
Good place for families.
Can be crowded on weekends.
Ample parking."
,,"Shop, Play and Catch A Movie",4.0,,"We visited Suntec city to kill some time on one fine evening during trip to Singapore. We took a stroll across the mall, tried our luck at the Claw machine and other games at the Arcade game center Cow Play Cow and watched a movie at GV Suntec City.

The shopping mall is very big with ample of stores, cafes and restaurants. An excellent place to spend time."
,,So large was overwhelming,3.0,,"We visited here several times as was relatively close to the hotel we were staying at. We are not fans of large shopping malls at the best of times and this was no exception. The displays were beautifully done but there are so many of them. There were not a lot of places to just sit in the centre and not one female clothing shop offered a seat for my husband to sit on whilst I tried on clothes. This was the main reason why I did not buy very much. On a plus side, everywhere was very very clean: Toilets exceptionally so."
,,Large fountain,4.0,,"This mall is connected to the nearby Convention Center and also the Millennia towers office block. Lots of shops and plenty of choices of food outlets. There is a huge water fountain here, which is not to be missed."
,,One of the largest,4.0,,"This is one of the largest shopping mall in Singapore, if Not the largest. You can find everything inside this Malls and many different eateries scattered around the mall. From the Budget conscious to the many expensive restaurants, you can find it all here. There’s a giant super mart located at basement one."
,,Nice Large Mall - Clean and Friendly with a Wide Range of Shops,4.0,,Lots of shops over several floors. There is parking onsite too. We were only here for the Hop On Hop Off bus which is located outside the mall. Also went up to the outside section for drinks.
,,Very lovely mall,5.0,,"I got to knew about this mall when my cellphone charger got damaged and I had to move towards this mall. I took a taxi from Little India and reached there at the Oppo service centre to purchase the new charger. This is a large mall having plenty of shopps and restaurants. Food Eating at Suntec City mostly takes place around the Fountain of Wealth in the Fountain Terrace zone. There are all the usual fast food outlets, plus two food courts and plenty of decent restaurants open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Suntec City is positioned next to the Central Business District and easily accessible by MRT or bus. Via MRT depart at Esplanade Station or at City Hall and walk for 10 minutes through the City Link mall, or take the a free shuttle bus between City Hall MRT and Suntec City. Buses stop right outside the convention centre."
,,Large shopping centre,3.0,,"Plenty of shopping to be done here! Large food court too. Powerful and relieving air conditioning throughout and easy to navigate from one side to the other, especially if you’re cutting through as a shortcut to Marina Bay or Esplanade Park."
,,A GREAT MALL,4.0,,A great shopping mall with a variety of shops and eating places. Nearby the MRT & the Hop on Hop off bus depot.
,,Massive Complex,5.0,,The mall is a mixture of 5 towers which house offices the lower floors are all connected and turned into a Massive Mall. The very beautiful Fountain Of Wealth is in the Centre and is a sight to behold at night. The Mall has loads of shops and restaurants and doesn’t get really crowded except for lunch time when I guess all the office workers come down for lunch. We went there with our kids and found 2 really good play areas but you have to pay. Overall Nothing special if you wanna see the fountain of wealth it’s well worth the visit. ALT Pizza i think it’s in tower 4 has amazing Pizzas definitely must try.
,,Great mall if you don't want the crowds if Orchard Rd,4.0,,"This is a great mall that is located within short walking distance of MRT stations....makes it easy carrying all those shopping bags!!! This placed ticked my key shopping boxes, sizeable uniqlo with good range, sepphora with helpful staff, din tai fung for much needed re-fuelling, and oodles of fun at Tokyo Hands!!"
,,Large Mall near other malls,4.0,,"This is a large mall with many offices above it. Many dining options available in basement and level 1 spreading the length of all 5 towers and main area.

There is an exhibition and convention center there too so if you're visiting a conference here, enjoy your shopping after!

Shops are sufficient but not as many as Orchard Road. The good thing is if you're bored after, you can walk over to Marina Square for more shopping. There is also Raffles City about 10min walk away underground amidst another length of shops.

If you haven't realised this, yes Singapore is clearly a shopping paradise. Shops everywhere including the tunnels and train stations.

Suntec city has a large Giant supermarket where you can pick up some essentials or food items including some food souvenirs to bring home with you. If you feel like chilling for an affordable glass of wine, the Giant supermarket at basement 1 has a wine area with chairs and tables for you to buy a bottle or beer and drink there with your snacks from Giant! How cool is that! No need to pay for overpriced alcohol when you can have it right there!

Upstairs on level 3 at tower 4 is a cinema where you can catch a movie or have a bite at the affordable food court just beside it. On level 3, you also get a range of premium Japanese restaurants as well as a cool alfresco dining area with some restaurants like Indochine playing live music on some nights.

Shopping is mainly in the center court area where you can find Uniqlo, Royal Selangor, Sephora, Swarovski, Cotton On, Crabtree & Evelyn, L'Occitane, and the cool Japanese lifestyle retail chain Tokyu Hands.

One tip for travelers: try the coffee and kaya toast at Ya Kun Kaya at the basement for some authentic local flavour.

I'd recommend a visit for dining or if your hotel is nearby. But I wouldn't make a deliberate trip here."
,,mall,4.0,,"good for electronic , there is 5 towers of office , have a supermarket in lower ground floor , also have fresh pizza near tower 3"
,,Classic shopping mall,4.0,,"A big shopping mall which connects all Suntec towers together. A lot of shops, bars and restaurants are available here. The fountain of wealth is center part of this shopping center"
,,Awesome mall with everything you need,5.0,,"We had a great time at Suntec Mall! From yummy eateries to just about every shop you can imagine, it has it all!"
,,Good Shopping,4.0,,Suntec is a large mall in close proximity to a number of luxury hotels. The fountain of wealth located outside is a pre cursor to some of the high end stores within. However the shopping is quite a mixture with retailers such as H&M also located within. If shopping is your thing Suntec should please.
,,Food court,4.0,,"We came here to eat at the food court. My husband is very particular with eating overseas however the Food Republic food court suits him as he can pick and choose what he wants, have it cooked fresh and he can see that it's clean and hygienic. I also like it as it means I can choose a different food stall to him and the food is cheap.

Afterwards we went to see the Fountain of Wealth and caught it just in time as we were beckoned in at 7.30pm by a member of staff as the fountain closed at that time."
,,Huge Mall with Chain Stores and Hoho Buses,4.0,,"I went to the Suntec City Mall as I wanted to use the Hippo Bus Sightseeing tours. The buses start here and you can also buy the tickets here as well.

This mall is huge and has all the chain stores that I can find at home. I ate my lunch in the food court while I was here. There is also a large fountain called the Fountain of Wealth which I got to see in action."
,,One of many,3.0,,"The mall is large but not my favourite shopping spot by far. Personally, it seems hap hazardous as to the order and layout of shops - I would exit towards the marina bay malls which enjoy a calmer atmosphere and bigger names."
,,"Huge mall with alot of fashion, food, household and kids options",4.0,,Lots of restaurants in this mall. Very spacious and huge place to walk. We went to the east wing atrium to visit the Lego roadshow. Also went to toysrus which was a huge toy store. Kids had fun playing. Toilets were not that kids friendly. Wish they had shorter height for taps so that kids can reach to wash their hands. Same for toilet cubicles.
,,I keep coming back,4.0,,"I first visited Fountain of Wealth long time ago in Suntec City. People believe that the fountain has the most lucky energy in Singapore and someone who could visit and touch the water of the fountain would have a good luck and might be coming back again to Singapore. So I did.
And now almost every year I keep coming back to Singapore although not always every time I was in Singapore I took time visiting and touching the fountain of wealth again.
But a remembrance of this Fountain of wealth would bring smile to my face and warm to my heart.
Maybe it is truly the most lucky energy spot in Singapore."
,,Huge shopping mall,4.0,,"Very large mall, unlike Orchard Road there are more affordable and cheap brands. Two-storey tourist buses leave from the street in front of the mall."
,,Vast array of shops,5.0,,"Our hotel was connected to this mall and there is a vast array of shops and restaurants to suit all budgets. One disappointment this visit was the American Eagle Store which seemed to be closing down, if not perhaps a reply from the Mall would allay our opinion."
,,Good place to cool down,4.0,,"Was attracted to visit this shopping Mall by the waft of cool air emanating from the doorway and was glad we went in, the place is vast and has every sort of shop you could want, from Fashion to Food. Found a Tony Roma's Rib Restaurant but unfortunately it was closed,thankfully we emerged back out to hop on the Yellow Line bus with my Credit card only slightly dented"
,,AnythingYour Heart Desired,5.0,,"As you walk through the doors you are overwhelmed by the mere number of shops, stores and places to eat. If you can't find it in this mall you don’t need it. After you walk for miles shopping you can stop at Starbucks or any other number of places to refresh yourself and gather the strength to continue filling your bags full of goodies. Great place to walk if you are concerned about the weather or just want to window shop. I recommend stopping at this mall if nothing else 5han to look around."
,,Huge mall,4.0,,"This mall is very easy accessible by MRT as you can alight at this few stops which are very nearby the mall, Esplanade MRT and Promenade MRT. This mall is really huge. There are a lot of shops and places to eat in this mall. Places to eat such as Kopitam, food republic, burger king and many more to list are also found there. The directions in the mall is very clear and accurate.

There are also attractions nearby such as the fountain of wealth and also sky garden. To your surprise, there is a gym in this mall as well."
,,Great for shopping,4.0,,A great place to escape the heat in Singapore. The mall is really big and has lots of towers so it’s good to use the floor maps. Layout is not great but the shopping is good. Has huge fountain but it was so busy and not well sign posted so we only got to see a glimpse from inside. The mall was packed as it was a Saturday.
,,Quite a Huge Mall ..,5.0,,Must not be less than 300 outlets .. Very huge and has got food and entertainment sections a swell .. Much cleaner and better malls in Singapore .. A must visit for every shoppers as you may even get some good bargains ..
,,"Sunetc City Mall, Singapore.",4.0,,"Suntec City Mall caters for every taste, from H & M, designer clothes and fashion, restaurants and branded goods everywhere. Better than many of the other malls around in Singapore. Well placed and not far from Raffles and the Post Office, Carlton Hotel et al."
,,One Of The Better Malls,5.0,,"Came here to do some shopping & found it to be cheaper than Orchard Road & Marina Bay, & much nicer than Vivo City. Well...... there were plenty of bargains to be had for us! Spent most of the day there, had lunch at Lime Truck inside Pasarbella & had coffee at Cedele Bakery & Cafe, & afternoon tea at W.E Workshop Element Cafe. Great coffee at both, W.E probably better for a nice strong flavoured coffee fix.
This is definitely one of the better malls in Singapore, very clean, spacious & a great variety of big name shops & various eating areas to suit all demographics. Definitely worth a visit & remember to bring your passport so you can claim back the government tax at the airport before flying out for all total expenses of S$100 & above."
,,Needs Improvement,2.0,,"My family of 8 dined there including the youngest (5 yr old). When we asked if they served water, they immediately answered no. Later on we looked across and saw that they had served water to another table. When questioned, they said it was because there were children. Technically we had 2 children so wondered why there was this inconsistency.
The Burg set included salad bar and also dessert. But they told us that they did not have the ice cream for that day. There was no other dessert unless they considered watermelon which was among the salad. I felt that they could have offered something else in place of ice cream.
What made thinks worse was that they did not replenish the items sufficiently eg when I went to take the fruit, there were only 2 pieces left."
,,Wow..,5.0,,"Beautifully crafted huge mall inundated with Branded shops, Bars and Restaurants. Other attractions are fountain of wealth, Sky Garden that I could visit. A must visit place in Singapore.."
,,Huge central mall,3.0,,"Suntec remains one of the larger malls in Singapore. The usual selection of uninspiring ubiquitous shops, including 3 different Starbucks outlets. It can be quite good for exercise on a hot day just walking the full length and back. A collection of generally mediocre restaurants around the fountain at the basement level."
,,Huge,5.0,,Suntec city mall was huge enough to be near to 2different mrt stations.including shops having anything you want but becareful that it starts working from11AM.
,,one big mall with lots of name brand,4.0,,"its almost center of city,. they dont have carefor shop anymore where i usded to go all in best price but there are many store and diffrent food to eat here."
,,Great place to shop and window shop,5.0,,"this mall has five towers, so expect to take a few wrong turns as you wander around and up and down. It literally has everything you would want to look at or buy. Choice of eating places are plentiful and would suit all appetites. It is also great to admire the special installations, the fountain of wealth in the centre, and the architecture that makes up this amazing shopping precinct."
,,Beautiful outdoor and indoor architecture,4.0,,"We ended up going to SunTec mall a few times. First by accident to walk towards Marina Bay from the JW Marriott, then again to pick up the HopOnHop Off bus tickets. Good shops and places to eat. Not high end like Marina Bay shops and Casino."
,,Nice mall,4.0,,While riding the hop on hop off buses we visited the Suntec city mall. A really nice place for shopping on easy to reach place. Lots of stores and plenty to choose from.
,,Grand Mall,5.0,,Very good mall divided into 5 towers with lot of shops and fountain of wealth in between which is one of the spot for sight seeing
,,My favorite mall in Singapore,5.0,,"Let me first admit - I do not like malls! Roaming about in malls, looking at shiny shops confuses me, tires my brain and my feet hurt. That being said, I live in Singapore - so I have no way to escape having to go to malls, almost every other weekend, if not every weekend! =)

Since being revamped a couple years back, Suntec Mall is, in my opinion, seriously one of the best in town, 313 being a close second.

I love that most of my preferred brands including H&M, Cotton On, Adidas have big stores here, which means I can find the most variety without having to scout other branches of these brands. The only brand i miss here is Zara.

GV at suntec, being one of the newer GVs is also excellent. They time the evening shows to cater to officer goers, with 6.30-6.45 pm shows. I really really like that.

This mall is easily accessible by public transport, with Esplanade
(orange line) right there. Promenade is a quick 5 mins walk as well. There are also a number of taxi stands around the mall."
,,Big mall in Bugis area,5.0,,"This is a big mall with many shops, Restaurants, very clean, free wifi. It was pleasure to spend time here."
,,Suntec city mall..,4.0,,Suntec city mall located in singapore is one of the biggest malls in singapore. I visited this place as part of the hop on hop off trip. This place is the starting point of many trips and the changing zone for the different bus routes. Fountain of wealth is located close to the mall making it ine more reason to visit this place.so go for it...
,,huge but like any other mall,4.0,,the mall is spread over five towers .. connected from inside.. the mall is huge but like any other mordern mall...
,,Not Really An Attraction,3.0,,"I'm not quite sure why this is listed as an attraction, it's just another shopping mall and nothing special. The only significance and importance for tourists is it's the centarl hub for the HIPPO hop on hop off buses. This is where all 7 lines start from and where you can buy tickets and tours, although you can buy your ticket on the bus"
,,Just another mall,3.0,,"It's like living in an underground city - you never have to see the sun , everything you want or need is accessible by underground accesses from other hotels and train stations,
locals admire it and assume you know how to find things once you get here.
I needed a couple of electrical accessories and others said ""just go to Suntec"" - they didn't say how hard it was to find any specific stores.
Need to remember how you how you got here - so many twists and turns in the underground system that one wrong turn can easily get you lost."
,,Not an attraction but just a MASSIVE mall,3.0,,A massive expensive mall intertwined with Raffles City.... Good place for a workout as walking seemed endless. Fountain of wealth is just another fountain Otherwise very clean
,,Terrible mall,1.0,,"Listed as an attraction for tourists but it's really just like any other mall. The fountain of wealth was a complete waste of time and the whole mall is in a mess because all sorts of shops were found every where there is space for a shop front. The shops also do not offer anything new or unique. It's very obvious that the mall's management need to up their game because of all the ineffectual planning that was evidently everywhere. What a waste of time and money. Skip this and spend the day at the Flyer, Esplanade, Gardens by the Bay or MBS instead."
,,expensive,3.0,,"On a stopover in Singapore, we spent a couple of hours at this shopping Centre. It is extensive and like everything else in Singapore very clean. However, it is very expensive: it may have been made worse by the fact that we had just finished a holiday in Vietnam. Great food court on the very bottom level. Good way to kill some time"
,,Every shop you want here,4.0,,Fine to spend hours here doing the necessary shopping especially if its raining out and dont want to walk up orchard road Can be a bit confusing but most mrt lines seem to get you here so handy
,,Good place for shopping and to escape the heat,4.0,,We mainly visited this mall to go to Jollibee cafe. There are also many other shops and it is nice and cool on a hot day. The area is well served by buses.
,,Sprawling city mall with haphazard tenant mix,3.0,,"This large sprawling mall is difficult to navigate. You need to know which specific shops or restaurants you plan to visit; otherwise you'll end up doing a lot of walking. Reminds me of being in a large airport terminal
Focal point is the wealth fountain in the basement
Main target group seems to be the office crowd
The Marina Square across the road is a more pleasant mall to visit"
,,getting lost in the shops,4.0,,"Singapore is fabulous but it's a bit warm and humid sometimes. They have these fabulous malls and you can stay underground if you want to.
I struggled at first to find my bearings.
It sounded simple enough but once in the mall you can't see the landmark buildings you were aiming for, like the Marina Bay Sands, which is the obvious one.
If you don't have a map you'll have to look out for signs and shops to remember your way.
Oh yes, free wifi, I didn't see a sign but one of the shop assistants set it up for me."
,,Limited options and not easy to navigate,3.0,,Interactive maps are terrible as they don't tell you where you are starting from. Limited shop options and restaurants. Nothing opens until gone 10am and nowhere seems to do a decent breakfast. Frustrating
,,Suntec is Awesome !,4.0,,"It’s a massive mall with lots of restaurants and high-end shopping.

The Five Suntec towers supposed to symbolize the palm of a hand.

Don't forget to visit the Fountain of Wealth

Daily Touch Water Sessions
10am – 12pm | 2pm – 4pm | 6pm – 7.30pm

“City Sightseeing” open top bus tour & “Duck Tours” starts from Suntec City Mall

Highly recommended for families with children!"
,,Unofficial symbol; uninteresting something something,3.0,,"It's a huge mall. What do you need to know? Unless you are from a really still-kinda-getting-it-together developing nation, I can't see why a traveller would go here. As this is Tripadvisor, I advise you do not put Suntec on your trio's itinerary. There is nothing here for you."
,,Amazing maze of shops,4.0,,"Went to Habanos 3 Temasek Boulevard, #01-653, Suntec Tower 4 to purchase a couple of Cohiba cigars great shop but very unfriendly owners it is a shame.The center is mind boggling huge megalopolis of maze of shops,you could take a few days probably to wonder through just on size very modern and nice cool inside great way to see a mega temple of consumerism."
,,Huge,4.0,,"What a place this has become with its five towers and close proximity to hotels, malls, sightseeing tours and the MRT. You could get lost in it as we did trying to find a way to the fountain that stands between the towers."
,,Lots of space,4.0,,This mall is quite spread out with much variety and a cinema within. Right below the fountain is also surrounded with a wide range of restaurants when you are starving for food.
,,Japanese buffet at Kuishin Bo,5.0,,"Wide spread of choice from snow leg crab, sashimi, sushi, tempura, “Kami Nabe” – Japanese Paper Hotpot, baked lobster, yummy chocolate etc"
,,Not clouded highly recommend,4.0,,This mall is not really big however not clouded. If you have plenty of time during your stay and enjoy window shopping could be great.
,,Wow what a work out,5.0,,We had a great time looking around this mega mall but rather wore our legs out walking the whole place then having to go back to the beginning because something we saw in our first shop caught our attention. Pick up a map and plan which entrance you are going to use.
,,Nice mall next to the Suntec Convention Center,4.0,,The Suntec City Mall is located right next to the rebuilt Convention Center and offers a wide variety of shops and eateries. If you're at a conference it really makes sense to go for lunch in the Mall.
,,Nice!,4.0,,"Have not been to Suntec for a while after its renovation some time ago. Went to the North Atrium just now to collect the race pack for the Straits Times Run. Was in a rush. Thankfully, the directional signs in the mall were of a great help. They were placed at suitable locations, adequate, visible and clear. Cool!"
,,A mall with everything,5.0,,"Suntec Mall is one of those places where you either spend a whole day and barely cover everything, or you have to come back again to cover the ground properly. It has a plethora of food options with a range of prices, and many shopping options. There is even a kids playground to keep the little ones busy while mummy and daddy shop or recover from the shopping! The variety of shops cater to adults and kids in all stage of the life cycle."
,,Good food choices,4.0,,We came here a few times during our trip to get a Boost or visit some food stalls. There are a good variety of shops and it's right next to the Fountain of Wealth.
,,Cheap eating,5.0,,Typical of many food courts in singapore this no different. There is a wide selection of cheap delicious food drinks and desserts to chose from. You can enjoy 2 veges and rice for just $4 or add some meat for an extra $2 . While in singapore you must visit one of these food courts to treat your taste buds.
,,Big shopping center,4.0,,"Singaporian like to go there. It is a complex shopping mall, dining with many brands of clothes, cosmetics, consumer goods...You can stay here whole day but still not enough time for the choice of what you love. So much!!!"
,,Coffee and food with passion,5.0,,This eating place in West Wing Suntec City mall is a peaceful place to take a rest from shopping. The food which consists mainly of savoury and sweet pastries has been thoughtfully prepared. Delicious croissants and filo rolls drizzled with syrup. Wonderful coffee as well. There is a limited range of tinned and bottled Delicatessen items. The staff are polite and enthusiastic.
,,An underwhelming mall.,3.0,,"This is a rather underwhelming mall, located near the Esplanade Metro station. There is nothing special in its design or shops. Good for a one hour stroll and a bite to eat."
,,Everything You Need,5.0,,"This place is too rich for my blood but it has everything you want under one roof. It's massive in size and it's a haven for those who want to lose some weight right after having a hefty meal, I suppose. From one end to the other, it can take up to several thousand steps and taking all the floors in one go, that would give you your daily 10,000 steps. That's practically what a tourist like me would be thinking of doing."
,,Nothing out of the ordinary with one exception,3.0,,Overall the mall area had the usual/expected eateries and shops spread over a large space. There were some ares that appeared as though they needed more in them to add atmosphere. The exceptional thing found there was a display of very expensive cars. The collection was unbelievable and worth seeing...and dreaming about.
,,Dinner and shopping,3.0,,"Both restaurants we wanted to have dinner at turned us away saying that their kitchen had closed early as they had a very busy day. The third one had some piping drainage problem which flooded part of the restaurant and wet a diner's bag which he had placed on the floor next to him. We had to find another table due to the flood but tables had not been cleared so we had to find staff to do that. The restaurant looked nice from the outside but inside was another story. Leaving the mall, we had to climb some stairs up from the fountain area and there was so much hair and dirt which was quite disgusting given the fact that it was all eateries there. I think the mall really needs to look into its level of cleanliness."
,,Big Mall and Busy,4.0,,There are 4 large office towers above so this place gets busy - plus right next to the convention centre. Some ok places to eat is the highlight - shops are nothing you can't find anywhere.
,,Sadly has gone too upmarket,3.0,,"When we first started visiting this shopping centre many years ago, there were few so-called designer stores. Now, most of the older type of store has been replaced by upmarket stores. The atmosphere has now changed. To us, not for the better. This is such a shame, as they now have exactly the same as other shopping centres. Even the food court has changed considerably. Instead of the old style Kopitan food court, they now have a food court that has lost its charm."
,,good shopping,5.0,,We visited a few shopping malls while in SIngapore and this was the best for size and variety of shops and food. Plenty of bargains to be had in the popup stores too.
,,Beautiful Mall. Fantastic food hall.,4.0,,So many malls in Singapore it can be hard to tell one from another. This one is beside the Convention Centre. So I was here mainly to have lunch. The Food republic food court is fantastic.
,,Nice,4.0,,The architectural design of Suntec mall is quite awesome. Their are a wide array of shops to choose from.
,,Huge Shopping Mall,4.0,,"A landmark in itself, Suntec City Mall is home to major brands along with small shops. This mall also houses the Fountain of Wealth, the largest fountain in the world. This mall also serves as the starting point for many tours around Singapore including the amphibious Duck tour. A famous landmark of Singapore."
,,Fountain of Wealth is Here,3.0,,There are four tower that used as office building up of this shopping mall. Fountain of Wealth is just right in the middle of the mall.
,,Many Store Famous Around the World,3.0,,"So Many levels, So little time. If you wanted to shop well know mall branded stores this is a good place to go. Hop On Hop Off leaves from here."
,,A little bit of everything!,5.0,,"Suntec is a huge mall with a little bit of everything in it. From food stalls to supermarkets, from jewellery stalls to clothes stalls! In addition, every December there will be a Popular Bookfest Festival! The biggest book festival in Asia! That is an event I have been looking forward to every year so don't miss it!"
,,Has a lot of everything,5.0,,"What a mall! If you can find it, it's there. We found chemists, cafes, electronic shops, Duck and Hippo tours, buses, taxis, underground train, Fountain of Fortune, exotic cars for hire, Giant hyper market, and just about any other thing you can think of. Lots of coffee shops, every conceivable Asian culinary restaurant, and all at reasonable prices. We did a lot of brunches and early dinners here, before returning to the buses to get back to our hotel for the night."
,,Great mall lots of small shops on the high floows,4.0,,Mall is great lots of shops and great free wifi. Can be a challenge to find places as there aren't too many maps.
,,Massive mall,4.0,,I have never been to a mall this big before. I spent a couple of hours here but only saw a small section of it. Plan an entire day if you really want to see everything.
,,Strictly for keen shoppers,2.0,,"Suntec City is a monstrosity - an enormous shopping mall in the middle of a concrete jungle of offices and a convention centre. Enough said. Even a Lamborghini Salon. If you are a keen shopper (preferably with deep pockets) you will be in heaven.
Spotted a nice outdoor bar in front of the Fountain of Wealth, accessible by an escalator, called IndoChine - did not go in but it looks pleasant amidst the concrete maze that Suntec City is."
,,Awesome Mall!,5.0,,"Lots of restaurant selection with cinema and interesting shops with linkage of total of 5 towers!

The free wifi was really good too and there's post office in Tower 4 as well as the Alive museum and Golden Village cinema.

They also have convention centre for exhibition and this weekend it was the IT fair.

Great for Pokémon Go gamers too with lots of Pokestops!"
,,Very Rude Fruits FoodCourt Staff,3.0,,"The staff of the Fruits stall in the Suntec Foodcourt at Level4 are the rudest to customers. I was trying to buy a slice of watermelon fruit as they show the most enticing watermelon- reddest & sweetest in their display but they give you an ugly looking slice of watermelon when you biy. I requested to have a slice that was nice enough to eat and not the one they were giving me which doesnt look nice at all. This so easily angered the short tempered saleslady and she just turned her back at me. What a way to treat their tourists & people of different nationalities who attends conventions in Suntec. Somebody please tell the people at the Suntec Food Court to be nice to their customers really quick, first time for me to experience rude singaporeans who are usually nice to tourists!"
,,Huge shoppingmall,4.0,,"This shoppingmall excists of 5 big towers, not only shops but also alot of offices and a big convention centre. Thats one of the reasons it can get very crowded at noon and in evening when work is finished. Alot of good shops here but not Always easy to find your way. All towers are connected underground and you have to be attentfull or you end up at the entrance of an office. Pretty good foodmarket too. The mall is connected to few hotels too, one of them is Pan Pacific, really good one. Theres a nice fountain outside when you are in the middle of the towers on groundlevel."
,,Overcrowded,3.0,,Looks like this is one of the favorite shopping malls of the singaporeans. It is located in the center and is usually congested. They have a variety of multicultural restaurants to choose from. They do not speak English so be prepared to politely show the foto of your menu when ordering.
,,Shopping with wife,5.0,,"Very pleasant place to visit with family branded shopping foods, shoes fashionable clothes and many more try it"
,,Huge,5.0,,Loved this shopping center and the has heaps of different food places subway stations and the fountain ...we bought a beautiful Chinese stone from a stall and the lady was very happy and pleasant .... will definatly be back again
,,One of the best,5.0,,"It's too easy to write off Suntec City as 'just another big shopping centre'. It is this but it's much more. For a start it's one of the cleanest, most eye catching malls I've ever seen. The traders clearly conform to the required standards because nothing is out of place... everything is beautifully presented: shiny and tidy. From the Fountain of Wealth at one end to the Hop on-Hop off bus Terminal at the other, a pleasure to stroll through this centre."
,,"Conference, shopping, food",3.0,,"Came here for a conference and this is the attached mall, at the West Side. North and East has other shopping and food options. The usual mid tier brands like Uniqlo etc. Food options aplenty, but nothing stands out"
,,Basically a Big Shopping Centre,2.0,,"It's huge, but still a shopping centre. Does have world's biggest fountain, and two subway stations, but still a shopping centre. Impressive at first until you realise it's just another shopping centre."
,,a mall,3.0,,"went singapore with my hubby few weeks ago,had our brunch and dinner in Suntec City Mall. we spend 3-4 hours at there. it's a mall with mid range to high stores"
,,Shopping galore,5.0,,"Suntec City has five towers and would recommended that you take your time when you go to this mall. You will know most of the shops my brand. One thing that I am impressed by is the number of restaurants they have in the same floor in the basement especially which is dedicated to different types of restaurants. Very different to the Australian type of food courts. We were there during the Christmas sales and got quite a good bargain.
Easy to get to and is around the Marina Bay Area."
,,MASSIVE mall and convention center...,5.0,,"A really impressive HUGE mall and convention center... Loads to see, shop and just spend a few hours in general."
,,Regular mall but has a very good Alive Museum,3.0,,This is a regular mall with mid range to high stores and restaurants.Nothing spectacular that you need to travel till there... However the Alive Museum there is really good and for those who cannot make it to the trick eye museum in sentosa can definitely go here!Also the fountain is worth a look...
,,Great for families,5.0,,"This was a massive mall, with large range of things to buy. Not too much of that Gucci/Louis Vuitton expensive rubbish. Best thing is there is ROOM to move around, and not have fifty people all up in your grill. Loved it. Favourite shop was Tokyu Hands, which is a Japanses store selling quirky homeware stuff. THere was a whole aisle dedicated to ear picking utensils!"
,,Huge!,4.0,,"This mall is one of the largest, if not the largest mall here in Singapore. There are actually offices above the mall. If I'm not wrong, this mall consist of 5 towers altogether and shaped like a hand when looking from above. Right at the ""palm"" of this hand is actually the fountain of wealth."
,,Good mall,4.0,,Walked there with kids on our daily walk and enjoyed the christmas spirit. Loved the shops and had a good time at starbucks.
,,Gold class cinema. Not a restaurant. It is a cinema with a difference.,5.0,,"My first experience with a really small cinema hall, filled up with big, comfortable chairs. Two chairs, connected by a table with a push button to summon service! No stepping on anybody's toes to go in or out of your seat as there is nobody around you, no rows of seats either. Every two chairs with a table in the middle have plenty of space to go in and out of your seat, just like first class travel! There is a menu with a light so you can order in the dark, meals, wine, popcorn, which can be ordered any time while you watch the movie. At the beginning, middle, end, whenever you want more. I guess the idea is that you have a lovely night out an enjoy it regardless of the movie. If movie is good, probably the menu and luxury settings aren't so important. If the movie is bad, I am sure the leather-clad recliners, with a blanket to ward off the cold, will probably give you a lovely sleep after a really good meal. Whichever way it works out, you can't lose! We didn't try the meal but the popcorn, wine and water were good. The blanket welcome as true to Singaporean tradition, everything you get into is freezing cold, with the exception of the streets. They haven't figured out a way to air condition them yet. A great experience going into a cinema where it doesn't really matter if the movie is good as the cinema, the chairs, blankets, table service with drinks will more than make up for any not-so-good-movie. You may even forget you went there to watch a movie - I almost did."
,,"You find almost everything there, in parcular for kids",4.0,,"Lot of shops, and great for shopping for kids. Giant supermerket, huge number of restaurants (marche is very kid friendly), coffees and bars, and very big Uniclo, H&M, Cotton On, Toys r us, Spring maternity, etc. Also two indoor playgrounds: polliwogs and cool-de-sac."
,,So much to see!!!!,5.0,,There are 5 different buildings and it's easy to loose track of time here just exploring the many shops and food courts. It is also the spot where you get the hop on hop off Tours using the duck company which was super helpful.
,,So Easy To Get Lost in Here,3.0,,"Every time I visit Suntec City Mall, I end up getting lost so, this last time, when I saw the Service Desk, I decided to get a map.

The young lady who served me was so helpful and tried to explain to me how logical the layout of the different sections, i.e. east, west, north etc., was. Guess who still got terribly lost?

As my hotel was just across the road from the Mall, I visited a few times during my stay, however due to my fear of getting lost yet again, I found myself reluctant to venture too far from the entry where I had come in.

I did, however, have two meals there, one at Marche which was acceptable, and one at the Manhattan Fish Market which was particularly good.

Not my favourite mall for the ease of finding my way around."
,,excellent,5.0,,very big and clean busy as always i still get lost even though almost walk everyday during my stay in singapore love the shops especially the restaurants here so many choices.
,,"Shops, shops and more shops",5.0,,Huge range of shops and food options. Also linked to Marina Square and Raffles city. Easy to get around and avoid the heat and/or rain.
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"This mall is vast, spotlessly clean and well laid out. However the choice of shops just didn't appeal to me, neither did it have the prestige of some of the other malls. Nice to wonder around but i wouldn't go back"
,,Customer service staff helpful.,4.0,,Great place to walk around to look out for sales. Customer service staff very patient and helpful! They have sense of humors which is great!
,,Good for long visits,3.0,,"You need to walk and walk and walk. If you are in Singapore for a long time, you can spend a day here shopping and roaming around. We have been here just as covering a tourist spot kind of. Didnt find much interesting."
,,Huge and Lots of Restaurants and Shops,5.0,,This is a popular place with locals as there's lots of eateries and also a good place to shop. There's also the Fountain of Wealth on site.
,,Great place to get gifts,5.0,,Awesome mall with excellent varieties of food. The food courts here were impressive as well as the overall variety of stores here.
,,Fountain of Wealth,5.0,,"I hope I get rich just by touching the fountain waters of the largest fountain in the world. At least that is what legends say....

Too many food options to choose from. Not sure if that is a good thing. Many things to do including nursing my wine in the very relaxing Sky Garden, snapping photos at Alive Museum (Trick Eye), getting an adrenaline rush on the 7D Amazing Xperience, hopping on and off the amphibious duck tours (Yes, it's an amphibious vehicle that takes you on land and water, dressed to look like a duck!) and open roof trolley buses....

Got myself a nice relaxing spa massage and loads of shopping too!

Almost everything under one roof. A great way to spend an entire day indulging yourself!"
,,Quite a popular mall,5.0,,"this is quite a popular mall and has lots of shops offering variety of item , it has some good shops offering cosmetic items for women apart from the clothes and elctronics."
,,Great place for shoppjng,5.0,,They have all the stores under one roof. Was easy to shop with a 3 year old cause completely air conditioned. We did all our shopping from this mall. Food options were nice too.
,,A mildly touristy attraction,2.0,,"Nothing too fancy or raving as I had thought. This place is huge with sky kissing towers, the largest man made fountain, sky garden, Lamborghini showroom and what not. All nice but lacks spice."
,,Too large and complex,3.0,,Difficult to find easily which you want... Not luxury shops... andunfortunately we did not find information counter
,,Central CBD Mall with lots of food choices,4.0,,This is very close to the Marina Mandarin Hotel. The mall is very big and has a range of shops to suit everyone. There is no Apple store here I am afraid. Food Republic on the lower floor is a good start if you are hungry. Also take a pew and see the delights of the fountain of wealth as you sip your coffee.
,,Expansive!,4.0,,"This mall is epic! I cannot fathom someone going to Suntec and NOT finding what they desire! A great place to spend the day with opportunities for fashion, basics, toys ( for our family Lego is a must!) and a huge selection of food choices. You could also catch a movie or even a 7D experience."
,,Huge choice,4.0,,"We actually fetched up here rather by accident having got off a bus to stretch our legs! In fact, we thought it was a great shopping experience. In fact Singapore is one great shopping opportunity. We also had a refreshment pit stop in a really nice cafe here. Well worth a visit."
,,So many good reasons to be here.......,4.0,,"There are so many good reasons to come here.

Of the 4 malls in these area, this is the biggest & the best. It offers a very huge & wide range of mid range retail & dining.

Top it up with a modern, luxurious & very spacious ambience, it is a real pleasure walking around in this mall. Or to dine here in many of the nice restaurants.

This 'difference' can be seen by the heavy flow of visitors as compared to the other nearby malls.

Within this mall is a big exhibition & convention centre. Regular consumer fairs are held. So if one is here at right time, may get great deals e.g. IT Fairs, Food Fair.

The Hop-on/Hop-off bus & Hippo boat rides are offered at front entrance.

Besides being accessible via 3 MRT stations, there is a bus stop right in front of entrance with about 17 different buses numbers!"
,,How big!,4.0,,"There are five towers that all spill into each other, to create one huge shopping area over three floors and then there's also an outside dining area on top of that! It gets very busy indeed so be prepared for lots of hustle and bustle. The restaurants get very very busy and are mainly situated on the lower basement floor, but it's still a good experience"
,,A great cinema experience,5.0,,"Cinema experience was pretty good. Online booking, ticketless entry. A few problems getting it to read the code but otherwise generally a smooth experience. Clean cinema, air conditioned, great prices too. Recommend a visit"
,,Great place to spend the day,4.0,,"Suntec city is huge lots of shops to keep busy for hours, plus lots of restaurants and fast food. Suntec also has a cinema and the alive museum"
,,Visit with kids,4.0,,we enjoyed walking around this big mall. The wealth fountain and the sky garden are also a good plus to see. Some hotels have free shuttle buses that stop right outside the main gate.
,,"One-stop Fantastic mall with restaurants, bars, shopping area and cinema!",5.0,,"Definitely a place for many activities, at one's convenience. Better than a neighbourhood mall yet cheaper than the higher-ends one."
,,Forget Orchard Road,5.0,,"This mall is easy to navigate, lots of variety and good prices. Shop in air conditioned comfort without tracking along Orchard Road. Would recommend."
,,You can find whatever you want,5.0,,"Suntec city, including city link, is not so popular like orchard road but believe me you can find whatever you wish. All brands, markets, restaurants, banks and nice bars. The good thing is that this place is not over crowded."
,,Huge mall where you can shop till u drop,5.0,,"One of the largest mall in Singpore and also newer in age, this mall spoils you in shopping option. From bog brand to local merchsndisr you have everything under one roof. If you feel tired of shopping you can relax with choice of foods on one pf the many cafe or restaurants. Carry enougj money if you visit with family because they will definitely make your purse lighter."
,,Happy experience,5.0,,"Me and my fiancé enjoyed this place you could see many places near in Suntec city
I love the Hip on hip off
I saw all the places using the bus
I took a lots of pictures with my fiancé

My fiancé wants to go again with me in there
We are really happy to visit Singapore"
,,Love a suntec shopping trip!,5.0,,A variety of shops - but best of all It has Marche! Our family favourite! A wide variety of shops and also meal choices. A must shop location.
,,Big shopping mall with new revamp,4.0,,"Due to me working oversea, I have not visited suntec city for almost 2 years. Before I went oversea, the mall is under renovation and now the mall has received a completely new look and I cannot recognize totally. The mall is equip with all the necessary shops, entertainment and restaurants. The mall is huge thus able to go in and spend few hours walking around, the mall basement has a fountain of wealth which is famous to tourists."
,,For years of my favorite Malls in Singapore,4.0,,Large. This mall is very LARGE. WIth a great variety of shops and restaurants and the massive fountain outside. It is a bit of a walk to the nearest MRT through some underpasses and sunny sidewalks. Which means HOT. Taxi queues are also a bit long most times. But once you get here it's worth the trip.
,,Excellent Mall,4.0,,"This is a nice big mall, with some excellent ships and a food garden a few floors up. Great location near other attractions. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Refurbished mall with restaurants,4.0,,"A lot of shops in it was in the midst of moving out, sales etc. Some restaurants in it. Basically a huge mall with everything and also a movie theatre"
,,Great after Revamp,4.0,,Much awaited Revamp did good to spice up this huge mall. Great selection of shops and a nice Rewards mobile app to top it up. The fountain could shoot up higher a bit if it really wants to show itself as biggest fountain. ;)
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Variety of stores, must go so many brands and restaurants very nice cinema theatre as well the fountain is a great place to take picture from inside the fountain"
,,suntec city,4.0,,"Out of huge number of Shopping mall, the Suntec city is one of the choice of mine. The mall is located near the business center and we can get all sorts of goods. Although expensive, we can get goods of every brand, including from, nike, Armani, uniqlo, Marc Jacobs, and so on......"
,,One of my favorite place,5.0,,The reason why I really like this mall is less ppl compare to another place. On top of that not really much shop but quite interesting shops are here. I really don't know why always keep coming back this mall whenever visiting Singapore. Especially short trip have not enough time to look around but this place can conquer all what I want to. One of my favorite place in Singapore.
,,Huge beautiful supermall for mid -range shopping......,4.0,,"After the recent major revamp, this is definitely one of the most beautiful mall in the city now.

But this is a very huge mall, & a confusing one. It's so wide spread over 3 atriums that even though we have been here many times, it is still not easy to look for the location of shops we want to go to.

All said, this is a good mall to just browse around, look for wide range of good dining options or do some shopping. There are a lot of mid range affordable shops here as compared to Orchard Road.

The front entrance of Suntec is also where one can take the Hop- on-Hop off bus & The Hippo boat.
This mall is linked directly underground to 3 other malls ie Marina Square, Millenia Walk, Raffles City (& Citylink). There are 2 Circle Line MRT stations here ie Promenade & Esplanade. And City Hall MRT via Raffles City."
,,Boring mall,1.0,,"This mall is relatively big but shops here can be found in another other malls in Singapore. Nothing unique about this place. A lot of vacant shop. Seems like the mall is doing poorly. On a weedday, seems like a dead mall. Will not recommend this mall to tourists. If you want to shop, orchard road and vivocity mall have much much more to offer."
,,A Shopping Mall with International Retail Brands and Food,4.0,,Suntec City Mall is a very big shopping mall with many shops and food places to explore. The place itself is like a maze with many entrances and exits to a few MRT stations as well. Not a good place if you want peace and quiet as it is packed with shoppers and office people.
,,Luxury Shopping,4.0,,Even if you don't buy its a great place to look around and see how the other half live. Alson Wi Fi is free.
,,Excellent,5.0,,It's a very good place for marketing. So many brand shops are there. Prices are better than other places like orchard road. Most quality brands shops products price are same in every where in Singapore . But When you are in Singapore then visit big mega shopping mall. Some where you can get sale products. It's very good price for you. If you are a tourist never forget to take refund GST from shop.
,,Suited everyone in our group.,5.0,,If you can't find what you want here it's not worth buying Spend hours in air conditioned comfort & drool over the cars out front
,,Luxury mall ...,5.0,,Singapore famous mall and convention. Many events are host here and there are many extensive of shops and eateries for you to venture. There is also Free Wifi for everyone. Impressive !!!
,,Mini City in itself,4.0,,"The Suntec City Mall is really a miniature city in itself! It has everything under one roof - all kinds of shops, all kinds of restaurants, sports center, spas, cinemas etc. You can easily spend a whole day there with your family and would not get bored or run out of things to do as the esplanade is just minutes away and you can even walk through an overpass to Marina Bay Sands and from the other side to the Fullerton Hotel."
,,Iconic Event Meeting Place in Singapore,5.0,,"Suntec is an excellent place in Singapore where one can hold events, meetings, and big conferences. The free Wifi and clean toilets are highly valued here.

I met with the managing team, they are efficient and quick to my meeting responses.

Also the Suntec Mall has many towers of shopping, dining and leisure."
,,Big and Confusing,3.0,,"My wife and I only visited this mall this afternoon by default. Suntec is the hub for all Singapore Sightseeing Bus Tours and we had to wait almost an hour for the Blue Line. Hence a quick browse around the venue.

It is a big mall and houses all types of luxury brands apart from a food court, cafes, restaurants, etc.

Perhaps we are used to Dubai where the major malls all have excellent signage and directions so found Suntec to be somewhat underwhelming.

."
,,Always nice to visit a mall,5.0,,"Great to nip in while we waited for the universal bus, the fountains are super cool and worth nipping down to see"
,,Fantastic complex and starting point for many bus tours,5.0,,"Great range of stores.
Excellent choices in the foodcourt and a large supermarket.
Yes, it is a large complex spread over more the two blocks.
Some public transport buses stop here and it has direct access to MRT station(s).
Please study the layout map and be prepared to do lots of walking.
Yes, It is the best place to join one of the HopOn HopOff Bus tours.
Take a photo of the fountain.
Nice garden on Level 3, well worth a visit."
,,Bigger is not always better !,3.0,,"Suntec is huge and it is very confusing to get around,it has most of the shops you could ever need it is a shoppers paradise,if you dont mind the crowds and have a good sense of direction.I just get annoyed when I go there to shop as it also feels kind of soulless.
It has plenty of restaurants and a huge food court in the basement,which is the only reason I bother to go there if we are around the area as there are plenty of good food stalls for breakfast,lunch or dinner."
,,Luxury goods abound...,5.0,,If you have money to spend this is the place for you. Luxury stores abound in a first class mall which is well fitted out. Nice to window shop.
,,Too big,3.0,,"I usually try and avoid coming to this mall even though I'm often in the vicinity for work. I find the signs quite confusing - it's just too big . Of course there are plenty of shops and restaurants, although most of the restaurants are fairly average."
,,Very big mall with lotsa stuff,4.0,,Suntec city has almost all of the middle class and luxury brands. It is linked underground to a few other shopping centers and trains stations so it will be a nice day out when it rains. Just be sure not to get lost inside and check the directories carefully because it can be confusing.
,,"""Lucky fountain""",4.0,,We headed to Suntec City Mall first to have some quick-lunch with a friend and also to take a glance at the so-called largest fountain in the world which is also believed to be a “Lucky” fountain when you touch its waters.
,,Good food and great shopping,5.0,,Awesome food hall with so much choice. Shopping for all budgets with good variety and very clean. Access to MRT is easy.
,,High End Brand names with very little differentiation,3.0,,"During our last visit 7 years back, Suntec used to be mall for middle class people
This time round it has turned into a Brand name , High end mall with very little for the common man on budget. Event the reasonable price eateries are hidden / located at difficult to find places. Did not enjoy the trip as there was no differentiation from Orchid Road malls"
,,Big,4.0,,This is quite a big mall here.A very good variety of shops.There enough food out lets to choose from.A good place to shop and eat.
,,Nice fountain,5.0,,"This shoppingmall is huge, too huge. A nice place is the fountain in the middle of the roundabout, where you can walk in and take some food pictures!"
,,Shopaholics Paradise,4.0,,"So many shops. Something for everyone. Lots of food and other services too. Money Changers here seem to give a better rate too. You can easily get lost, but plenty of electronic directories to help you find your way."
,,Shopping,4.0,,Great place for shopping.also many outlets for eating..when there visit the fountain of wealth..had a good snack at cafe gelare.nice sandwitch/shakes with a lovely view of the fountain...reasonably priced..
,,Pretty cool,4.0,,"I like this mall better than the most of malls in Singapore. It connects to Millenium which makes it even better, since there is also pretty nice things at Millenium.

Not to mention the Fountain of Wealth - this mall is the best and offers you a lot, but not everything.

Extremely busy during 11-13PM and pretty quiet at 19-21PM."
,,awesome place for shopping,5.0,,"This is a must-go shopping place. There are 4 huge buildings for shopping here. The famous Singapore Fortune fountain is here surrounding by these four buildings. You can spend a day shopping here. You should also try restaurants at roof top, very delicious."
,,One place to rule them all,5.0,,"Nice shopping centre, very well located. Our main attraction is Uniqlo, which actually is one of the biggest shops in all of Singapore. We visited this place 3 times in 2 weeks and every time enjoyed something different. We also went to the cinema and visited some restaurants near the fountain on the first floor."
,,RESTAURANT,4.0,,We visited Enbu Restaurant in this Mall. It serves Japanese style food. The waiter was very helpful and the bill was very reasonable for Singapore.
,,"Nice ambience, 'luxurious' mall, great place to be at......",4.0,,"This is one of few Mega malls in Singapore. It is super huge & shops are very widely spread out in 3 Atriums. Can be confusing & one can get 'lost' easily.

After a major recently completed revamp, this mall is now more luxurious, very nice & classy, with a huge mix/choices of many mid to high end shops/dining.

Linked to Circle Line MRT, it is easily accessible. Definitely this is one of the better malls here for shopping & dining. One of the best!"
,,Love this Mall @ Night,5.0,,"Amazing lights and effects of the water fountain. This is near the hop on hop off bus stop. Very accessible and convenient mall. They have lots of restaurants, bars and shops to offer."
,,Movenpick restaurant,4.0,,"Movenpick is a great place for families, or a group who like choices. On entry, we were each given a card, which was presented to each food 'outlet'. It was a bit like an upmarket food hall in David Jones or similar. Payment was organised on the way out, via the cards given. Great choice of food."
,,"Best exhibition place, child friendly",5.0,,"Usually I visit this mall during exhibition, most likely PC fair. But recent revamped made the place even more attractive. Place to visit :
- Food republic (serves VERY good local food) at the basement near the fountain
- Children playgound, top level mainly
- clothes and branded stuff

The story among the local is that, the design of the mall looking from birds eye view, is a palm holding a ball, which is also the fountain, the towers are the fingers.

And if you happen to be there when they turn down the fountain and you are free to walk up to the center of the fountain, walk around it 3 times clockwise with your hands in the water, it is said to bring you good luck. Hmmm....Why not?!"
,,Huge Modern Mall with Great Food Hall,4.0,,"I was in this mall in both January and February this year and there were some super bargains around There is even an M & S.

Lots of people visit this mall - its very popular with both tourist and locals.

There was a play area for children and escalators as the mall is on several levels.

The toilets are clean and modern and there are baby changing room also.

It was a really good experience and I would definately go there again."
,,Massive!,4.0,,"Suntec is a huge shopping centre down near MBS and accessible from many of these local hotels (pan pacific, mandarin). There is everything imaginable for sale here from high end name brands through to cheaper options and bargains. Interspersed throughout is a range of great little (and not so little) eateries with every option of food imaginable. One word of warning keep track of where you are - it's easy to get lost!"
,,Great city mall,4.0,,Suntec Mall is a very large mall that is not only a shopaholics paradise but a welcome respite spot from the heat and humidity. Great for both shopping as well as a great selection of food outlets.
,,Modern Mall,5.0,,"I first entered this place the night I arrived at Singapore, It was beautiful. The next day I went back I saw the lovely atmosphere of this mall. It was not crowded therefore you get to enjoy the shops. they have a really nice ceiling and its fun to see the natural shine of the daylight inside the mall. I can say i really had a great time."
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,This is a really big shopping mall with lots of big names. Also food halls with a big choice of restaurants. Best of all for us was Food Republic with lots of stalls selling food at great prices.
,,suntec city shopping in singapore,5.0,,i alr enter visit shopping nice.. place in shopping great that the suntec city mall is good... 100% nice. :-)
,,Great Mall,4.0,,Great Mall i made a mistake in my first review the mall was not this it was Shaw towers center this Mall is huge large one i think it is one few largest in Singapore i will let my photos talk
,,A breadth of fresh air,3.0,,"I worked here a couple of years back, that was before they did a massive overhaul of the entire mall and...I am thankful they did.
Suntec City as a whole used to be just mainly offices, a convention center and some run off the mill shops that you can find at practically every other mall. There weren't any big brand names, a sleepy cinema in one corner and some supermarkets. After a massive overhaul, all that's changed and there are more restaurants, some watch boutiques that I personally love and it's got a little more life in the place.
This joins up with Marina Square so it's practically one of the largest places you could spend a day wandering around. It does get a bit crowded on Friday evenings and afternoons on weekends and public holidays so steer clear if a crowded mall isn't your cup of tea!"
,,Nice and less hectic mall,3.0,,We ended up buying a lot at this mall although it was not as inspiring as the other malls up in Orchard.
,,Big and more reasonable than the others around here!,5.0,,Lots of stores that are more mid-range rather than luxurious so a little more affordable. Good food courts and close to the Fountain of Wealth.
,,Many options,5.0,,SUNTEC keeps getting better and better. Many more stores and food options. Worth checking out and wandering the different buildings.
,,Difficult to get around,3.0,,"Suntect City Mall is next to my hotel, Pan Pacific Hotel. Though it is conveniently located, once inside I had difficulty finding the stores I wanted to visit. The interactive directory was just confusing. It is best to go with Singaporean friends if you need to find a shop.

Eventually I found Harvey Norman after I situated myself around Giant, a grocery store that seems centered for Suntec.

Later I found out there as an app. Please download it since it was helpful."
,,Good deals at some stores,4.0,,"Suntec city did not have all the high street and luxury labels. However , they do carry few Asian brands such as giordano and few international stores like H&M and Sephora. The collection at suntec was different from all the other malls and carried good deals and discounts for the festive season ."
,,Pretty good for a mall,4.0,,"Singapore is made of malls , it's hard to understand, how many and how large until you see it , and most of them connect , underground sort of , this one is far above average and the best we have found yet"
,,Rejuvenated,5.0,,"We were here 18 months ago & it seemed most of the shops were blocked off for renovation, but well worth it. Like everything in Singapore, the renovated centre is well thought out and beautifully finished off. Well done, as its a pleasure to walk through this shopping area"
,,Renovations and Facelift recently completed,4.0,,This is a pretty large mall by local standards. Lots to walk and see. Consists of 3 levels and it's well spread out with a good mix of shops. It has just completed massive renovations and facelift and looks really new and nice compared to before. A big supermarket Giant can be found at the basement if you need to get your stuffs. There is another supermarket cold Storage (slightly more upmarket compared to Giant) at the second floor near Macs.
,,Very Fancy,5.0,,"A very fancy mall with a lot of designer brands. Nothing cheap, everything is very high end including the food."
,,Great Shopping Mall and a Center of Hop on/Off bus station,5.0,,"We boarded a hop on/off bus and each route ends
up at Suntec City Mall. So all tourists can take
advantage to explore and shop in Suntec Mall
before boarding the sightseeing big bus.
While we waited for a scheduled bus for Santosa
route, we had food at the cafeteria where lots of
international food await you. This is one of the
best places for shopping in Singapore. You can
board a hop on/off bus here too. The meeting
point is just outside the mall."
,,Good shopping,4.0,,This is the mecca for Singapore shopping and I felt like I was in Time Square or something while being here...very cool
,,Rojak and Spring Roll (Po piah),1.0,,"Had lunch at the Basement Food Court by the Fountain in
Suntec City 29 Nov 15 and would not recommend it at all. The spring roll skin was not the normal skin and the vegetable filling completely fell apart. It cost $2.30 per roll when one can get better spring roll between $ 1.50 - 2.00. It took the lady 20 mins to make three serves of rojak. She was by far not a very happy Charlie. Must say the standard of service is very poor. The staff at the stall is part of her employment and providing service is not on the agenda. Where do you end with poor quality food and poor service at Suntec City."
,,Lots of choice,5.0,,Suntec offers a huge area of shops of all kinds. There's a great food court on the lower level as well as many restaurants. There are supermarkets and many department stores. The shopping centre has 2 main corridors coming together with a huge fountain in the middle. Its also connected to other shopping malls via a MRT corridor. It's well worth a visit!
,,A mall for your many needs,4.0,,"This mall contains a wide varity of types of shops from restaurants ,cafes to Internet service providers. The maps and directions are given at the top of escalators but sometimes the shops are not numbered. There is also a customer service to direct you.Harvey Norman, Hush puppies,Charles & Keith are few shops to name. The malls Opens around 10 a.m. and closes @ 10.00 p.m. The mall is connected to Millenia Mall , Hotel Mandarin and Ritz Carlton hotel. It is also the place where you can get in to the Hop on hop off busses. The place is accessible by MRT -get off at Esplanade station and follow directions."
,,Shopping paradise,5.0,,"Wonderful place to enjoy a shopping afternoon followe by a movie in Suntec city mall in Singapore. Loads of big brands like charles & keith , H&M, Zara etc. And moreover some lovey local exclusicve shops too"
,,Lots of choices for Family,4.0,,"This place is huge and full of restaurants,kid play ground,pet shop, game machine shops. Also 2 hi end and lower end supermarket called Cold storage and Giant."
,,Dirty Place.,3.0,,"We went to the Suntec City Mall to go on the Duck Tour and have a look at the Fountain Of Wealth.
I have never seen so much rubbish and cigarette butts laying around in Singapore.
Near the Duck Tours the rubbish left behind on all the ledges and around the seating area was bad and I think it was mostly staff from the shop inside making the mess.
Then the stairs going up the street level near the fountain was littered with cigarette butts on every step.
A lot of the shops are empty and because of the bad design you have to walk from one tower to another if you want to go to certain shops."
,,Just another mall,4.0,,thought the mall is huge with variety of restaurants. but the experience was just ordinary. Eateries were there but most of them way too expensive. visit only if you have deep pockets.
,,Huge shopping,4.0,,A big shopping centre with a huge variety of stores. Not really very cheap prices but all top class brands available. Good variety of food from food hall and nicer restaurants in sky garden area
,,It's just OK,3.0,,"We visited the Mall on the back of previous comments, but in all honesty, it's no better a Mall than most and worse than some.

Out of the way, not very easy to find your way around, and limited in its appeal.

There are better in Singapore."
,,"basic mall, poor restaurants.",1.0,,"we ended up here. it was a kind of worst of all worlds. not glamorous, out of the way. more like a basic mall in the UK. serves a purpose I am sure but I suspect only worth going to if you specifically need to go to a shop which is there. also, it took ages to find our way out. not well signed"
,,DONT MISS SHOPPING AT SUNTEC CITY,4.0,,"The mall place has a number of connected buildings, and you will be able to find many famous brand names sold here at highly competitive prices. In addition, you have the hop on hop off bus stand in this location,where you can book your ticket to go around Singapore to see various attractions. You may down load the suntec mall app from app store, in order to upload receipts of your purchases, to get some rebates,but it will need a minimum of three days to get that. For those of you wishing to carry out of Singapore purchased products may ask the stores for a GST refund receipt, which can be verified at the aiport by immigration officers,and then get paid for your refund amount at GST refund counter, after passing passport control."
,,Great selection of shops with lots of variety,4.0,,"Suntec City Mall is a great shopping centre for everyone, wi lots of well known brands and a few not well known brand shops as well, e.g. Zara, Body Shop, H&M etc..

This is the place to go for regular shopping, and is also the starting point of the Hippo / City Sightseeing bus tours."
,,Like all malls,3.0,,"This is just an ordinary Mall. What more can one say; its nothing special - just like all the others in Singapore. But its worth a visit; its air-conditioned, and there are some food outlets. So its worth a visit if you like wandering around shops!"
,,Good selection of shops,4.0,,Good choice of shops but to be honest the area is full of good malls. Great Dim sum restaurant where you can watch it being made. Huge queue for a table so we didn't go in but looked very popular
,,you can find most things...,4.0,,".....eventually. It is a big place spanning 5 towers and there are loads of eateries and plenty of shops. The eateries go from food hall to fine dining, there are lots of different shops, at least 2 supermarkets (could be more as we may have missed them). If you are staying in the area then it is worth a visit but as Singapore is full of malls it is probably not worth travelling far to get there."
,,One-stop for all your needs!,5.0,,"Suntec City, 1 of my favourite “Must-visit” shopping mall since my first trip to Singapore back in the early 2,000s. On my recent family trip to sunny Singapore, we visited their Fountain of Wealth to touch the “auspicious water” in the morning and had our lunch by the fountain too, something new! Then we went up to Alive Museum to explore the 3D art pieces and followed by a Duck & Hippo sightseeing tour around the island. We went up to their rejuvenated outdoor dining located at level 3 for a cool alfresco dinner at Dallas restaurant, accompanied by a scenic view of the fountain and we manage to catch a nice movie at the local cinema house to end the day.

The mall is situated in between 2 MRT stations that takes us to major shopping areas from our hotel which gave us another reason to drop by for a last minute shopping before heading back to our country. The mall that encompass everything and anything you need. Nice ambience, good food, clean environment, smoothing background music and so much more.. I’m surely coming back for more!"
,,Upmarket Complex,4.0,,Suntec City complex is massive. It comprises 5 towers which all link up underground.The underground floors & first levels are mostly food halls & restaurants & cold storage facilities.The next levels are shops.Absolutely everything you can imagine can be found here from Prada to H& M & anything in between. Great place for shopping & I spent several days shopping here.
,,Huge place with variety,4.0,,"The Suntec city mall is a part of the Suntec city in the Temasek Boulevard area. The mall has everything in it for all age groups.

Brand shops, Giant hypermarket and Food Republic which has restaurants of varied cuisines.

The fountain of wealth is an added attractions. One can get into the fountain area from the Food Republic section.

A must thing to do while in Singapura."
,,A mall with a big surprise,4.0,,"Suntec shopping mall is not far from the Singapore Flyer (about 8 mins walk). It is a standard Singaporean mall but with one big difference it provides a setting for the world’s largest fountain, the Fountain of Wealth, (good thing to have in a mall ah). At certain timess of the day, the fountain is turned off and visitors can walk around a mini fountain in the middle of the fountain's base to collect coins for good luck. At night, the fountain is used laser performances, as well as live song and laser message dedications between 8pm to 9pm daily. A interesting way to propose to your partner. It is situated in such a way the fountain is the hub of the Suntec shopping mall (open from 10-10). The bronze ring of the fountain is designed based on the Hindu Mandala, meaning universe and is a symbolic representation of the oneness in spirit and unity and further symbolizes the equality and harmony of all races and religions in Singapore. Good mall, great fountain."
,,Great Place for Shopping,4.0,,"This is a nice place for shopping. It has several towers though and there is a possibility you might get lost somehow but don't worry they have information counters everywhere. There are many restaurants and cafes. It is also the terminal for the duck and Hippo tour buses plus it has one of the largest fountains in the world, the Fountain of Wealth. So if you want a relaxing shopping experience this is definitely the place to be."
,,great shopping complex,5.0,,"Good shopping complex, not too expensive, unlike some. This has all the usual mid range high street shops, easy access and a variety of restaurants,"
,,Interesting display of shops!,5.0,,"You name it it is available. Shopping stores galore,you can wander all day & be happy,if not tired! Plenty of nice eateries for when you need a break & nice coffee shops to help boost you on your way again!"
,,A bit odd,3.0,,"This appears to be a series of shops connecting the 5 towers. As such it doesn't quite work in the traditional sense of a mall. Also given that it connects working offices, it's only really busy during lunch hours. Perhaps it's a new concept but it doesn't quite seem to work. Everything ends up a little too spread out, not intuitive to find things and all a bit odd tbh"
,,Huge mall,3.0,,I've been here many times over the years. It's really a very large mall with a selection of mid range shops and fairly mediocre restaurants. With recent renovations it seems to have become even larger than before! Because of its size it can be a little tricky to find specific shops.
,,Dull Mall,2.0,,I visited this mall just because I had to end the City Sightseeing Singapore and start the Duck tour. The mall is huge but dull and contains many stores which most of them are of no interest to us. There are no guide maps for this mall and the Information Staff seem to be careless about helping customers and it takes ages until you reach after a long walk that there is actually a McDonalds in the Mall!.
,,Huge shopping centre,4.0,,Handy for tour buses. Good supermarket. Unfortuanately I was taken ill on the last day of our crusie which ended at Singapore and couldn't do anything after our brief trip to Sun Tec. I had to spend all day in our hotel room. Luckily we've beent to Singapore before and have been to most attractions.
,,Too huge for my liking,3.0,,"I got dropped off at the taxi stand in the middle of all the towers. One flaw was the lack of shade since it was raining that day. Seeing that the entrance to one of the mall towers was closed, we resorted to going down some stairs into the mall directly below us.

I found this mall way too big. It stretches over a few of Suntec's towers and can be quite confusing if it's your first time there. The variety of stores is mediocre.

There were lots of directions, but overall just too big and tiring to walk about. Wouldn't recommend for anyone to come here."
,,"Decent mall, renovations goong on",3.0,,"Suntec has very good food options, diverse retail outlets, the mall needs a bit more of upper scale apparel/fashion clothes just to cover all customers taste. In addition to global village cinema, the mall has unique entertainment options such as alive musuem, and lockdown. If i had a choice i would add one or two refloxology/massage spas the definately the mall will be one of the best in Singapore."
,,Huge & nice mall,4.0,,"Suntec Mall has been undergoing a major revamp for awhile now, and part of it has been completed.

This is a Super Big mall. So although revamp is not fully completed fully, there is still a huge completed part of the mall to walk around. There are no renovation dusts or noises in the completed part. See photos.

The place is so much nicer now, very spacious & classy too. New shops & eateries has been added. Although one can find similar brands/products in other malls eg in Orchard Road- the atmosphere here is much better.

Another good reason to come here is that there is a very interesting Singapore Story exhibition ( see photo) on now till 30th June & admission is free.

Although most visitors are locals, there are tourists/foreigners visitors as well. Those interested to know more about Singapore's story and Mr Lee Kuan Yew, will find this exhibition very meaningful & informative.

Suntec Mall is also linked to 2 MRT lines & is very near to Orchard Road & Chinatown

Certainly worth a visit ."
,,If it is not for Sofra I would not be here,2.0,,If it is not for Sofra I would not be here The only good thing about it that Sofra Turkish Restaurant is in this shopping center
,,Disappointing,3.0,,This place is still being developed and as such there are plenty of shops waiting to be occupied. Don't get me wrong in a few months there will be plenty but at the minute not so good. The shops that are there are good and plenty of variety.
,,Renovations,3.0,,Too much of this large complex is closed for renovations. What remains open is fairly mundane. There's nothing here that you can't find in any major shopping centre in the world. There are also better places for shopping in Singapore.
,,Great New Mall,5.0,,"Sun Tec City mall has been rebuilt and is now hosued in the new Tower 5 and its house all the leading labels and shops. is well linked to the Pan Pacific Hotel, the City Link mall, Marina Suare mall and to Esplanade MRT and City Hall MRT."
,,Still under construction,3.0,,"The mall is still under construction and it can be a bit confusing getting from one wing / floor to another. We found it a bit of an issue that there was no public seating available anywhere, you could only sit / rest in restaurants! The main purpose of getting to the centre was to get City Sightseeing HOHO bus tickets. It took a bit of walking around trying to find their ticket office and bus stop. The Fortune Fountain was interesting but has not made any differences to my finances!!"
,,They missed the whole point of a shopping center,1.0,,"Like many other failed Singaporean Shopping centers of the past, this shopping center spent too much time and attention on showing off, but very little to make the shopping center convenient. If you try to access the shopping center from the opposite side bus stop, you many never figure out a paddestrian crossing. After entering into the shopping center or convention center, you will find very little signs to find the right shop or room. And for the sake of crowd control, the security guards will not let you stop anywhere for a while to figure out the right direction. So, I feel the management miss the point that it supposed to be an international standard shopping and convention center, not a singaporean hocker center where customers need not to stand and think what to buy."
,,"Shops, Shops And More Shops!!",4.0,,"Start your day by catching the Double Decker Red Bus tour from this location. At the end of your tour , a welcome relief is to find a quiet restaurant within the complex. We say quiet because at their lunch break hundreds of workers leave their offices for a lunch and a chat.The noise is overwhelming but it is people just enjoying their lunch. We found a quiet French restaurant, name escapes me, but it was good food and a COLD beer."
,,Too large with too little signs,3.0,,"Suntec City is a huge mall, and I mean humongous. It's basically an upper ground complex adjacent to the convention centre mixed with a huge ""labyrinth"" of shops under the huge 5 Suntec towers. There are few signs, so it is very hard to move around without gettinf lost. There aren't many interesting shops here, just the normal stuff, but it has good restaurants like Ichiban Boshi and much more. The Fountain of Wealth is also located here, but theres not much to see about it despite its (naturally suntec) huge size. This mall, along with Millenia Walk and Marina Square just probably serves as a connection from Marina Bay to City Hall. So it's not necessary. Unless you're staying in Marina Bay, and isn't satisfied with Marina Square or need a supermarket, don't go here. Better yet, just pass this place on your way to Raffles City."
,,Superb Mall,5.0,,"Visited Jan 2015. Biggest mall I have ever seen. Lots of branded expensive shops and eateries. Popular food courts like Food Republic and Kopitiam are here. Surrounded by 5 tall tower buildings. The structures are so tall, you will have a cramp on your neck. Also home for the Fountain of Wealth, world's largest fountain. Alive museum is here as well. Close to Marina Bay area and 2 MRTs. Nice place to get away from city heat. Worth a visit if you're in Singapore."
,,Good Big Mall,3.0,,"Suntec Mall is quite big. Good for Shopping Clothes. Lots of brands like Uni Qlo, H&M etc. Variety of Options for Food as well, mostly located in Basement Located near Promenade & Esplanade MRT"
,,"Renovated, lots of food",4.0,,"New Fountain Restaurants has lots of food, at all price points. Food Republic has a Vegetarian outlet (hidden at the back), as well as a Indian Veg outlet."
,,lots of choice for food and shopping,5.0,,"it has almost everything a shopper need, the place is full of clothing stores, electronic shops and great eatery. Its next to esplanade so you could just walk on and vist many other places.."
,,Quite a large mall,4.0,,"The shopping centre is modern, clean and also very large. It's a good way to escape the heat outdoors and it's got everything from fashion to food to entertainment to technology. The Food Republic food court there offers a very wide range of food at cheap prices. The shopping centre is also home to the Fountain of Wealth, a big (largest in 1998) fountain in the centre that has sessions where visitors are allowed inside. There's an MRT entrance right outside although like other stations in the MRT system, it's a bit of a walk once you get underground to the train station. When we visited the shopping centre, one of the wings was closed for renovation but there were still plenty of shops to visit. A better in-centre Wi-Fi connection would have been great."
,,Standard Mall,3.0,,Good quality shops and a wide range of restaurants but most of the malls in Singapore look the same. Nothing outstanding or special about the facility. I wonder how some of the shops make a living with few customers and lots of staff.
,,Biggest fountain in one of the biggest Shopping Mall.,4.0,,"Read about this fountain at the Suntec City Mall so hopped on the MRT and stepped off at Suntec after a Quick ride. ( I think all MRT Stations are linked to shopping malls). Went looking for the fountain and after going through amaze of malls, we found it and were amused to watch people going out into the middle of it and walking around the center for good luck. We had to join them and do the same. Watched the light show with the fountain and then ate dinner and shopped for the rest of the time. Was very clean and cool, and staff were very helpful."
,,Careful not to get lost,4.0,,"Beautiful, large and fully air-conditioned, filled with stores of all sorts, one can easily get lost in this huge mall. If you have only one day in Singapore for all your shopping needs and want to enjoy all the local cuisines, this is one of the many places you can spend your entire day at."
,,Great on a hot day - air conditioning!,4.0,,"Lots of floors and shops to explore, seemed very familiar as many stores also in the UK. Cafes full of workers at lunchtime, very clean throughout. It is also quite easy to get lost. There are four tower buildings (offices) and the shops and cafes are in the lower floors and are interconnected."
,,Good place to walk around,5.0,,Suntec is a place to walk around the mall and there changes and upgrading to the building. Do looking around this building. Getting more places to shop around. Foods stall are not bad.
,,Worth a look around,4.0,,"This place is massive. I didn't get to see all of it but what I did see was pretty good. It has everything you need, shops for clothes, food, toys. You can get your clothes dried cleaned. Definitely worth a look around if you are staying in the city."
,,Love it!,5.0,,Suntec is a great place to shop in Singapore away from the designer brands and hugeness of Orchard Road. The shops are great! Lots of nice places to eat also. We always go when we come from Australia and it's always changed in some way. So you must revisit!
,,The Basics!,3.0,,"The Suntec Mall have all the needs for a Shopping Mall!!!Good selection on the Food court,Banks,Harvey Norman and many more!!!! So if u are looking for something for the daily needs this is a place to go!!!Nothing especial!!!"
,,Clean tidy & extensive range of stores,4.0,,"This centre like most in Singapore was clean, tidy and had a great range of shops with quality brands and products.

The center is also the starting location for the duck and hippo tourist bus service so getting there will not be a problem.

It's a great place to spend the afternoon in air conditioning to escape the tropical climate"
,,After renovation,2.0,,So this place just had a massive renovation . Did it get much better? The quick answer is no. No high end brands in this mall just at the edge of downtown. Shares a lot of similarities with the marina square mall 1 block away - average on everything . No good restaurants here to speak of also. Probably pop by if you're staying in 1 of the 5 hotels nearby
,,Good food choices,3.0,,Quite a decent selection of places to eat as well as a good range of shops. Well connected to Marina Square and to Esplanade MRT and (a bit further away) to City Hall MRT. Wasn't too busy at lunchtime on a aturday in November.
,,Nice place,3.0,,"Used to be one of my fav places to visit. However, now during the renovation, very hard to go from one tower to the other. Have to really walk around and get lost to find your way."
,,It's has been a long time I had step into Suntec,3.0,,"Currently only Tower 3/4/5 has shopping, the rest is still under renovation. The current shops are interesting but the signages are really wanting, they aren't clear enough for directions as how to get from tower 5 to tower 3/4, vice versa."
,,TOO BIG....!,1.0,,"The place is to big because they have Tower1,2,3,4,5 And we turn to tower 2 carpark ........ but we cannot find our car ..........so please minimise the shoping centre and the carpark. PLEASE........."
,,Over-crowded,3.0,,"We came here because we saw it from our hotel the Mandarin Oriental and it looked quite close. It was however at least 25 minutes walk away. The shopping centre is very large and very confusing in its lay out. Shops are middle of the range but there is a huge range of brands here. I got a fantastic pair of Ecco Sandals on sale for SIN$80 from the Ecco Shop, which was a good deal. However, I found the overall experience of shopping here too unpleasant because of the massive crowds of people inside the mall. You could have been in any mall anywhere in the world, it had that generic mall type atmoshpere except that it was five times as crowded than an Australian or USA mall. Don't try to get a taxi from out the front either, that was at least an hours wait in line."
,,Huge with the Biggest Fountain,4.0,,"Nearest MRT - Esplanade Huge mall with a lot of eating joints, alive museum and the biggest waterfalls. Duck tours have an office here from where their city sightseeing buses, Duck tours and other attraction tours begin."
,,Too big!,2.0,,As the titles says this place us way too big and spread over a vast area which is not joined up properly. Really confusing layout and didn't find much. So many shopping options here I wouldn't waste my time on this one.
,,Still Average,3.0,,"I found this mall previously a little dull and on my recent visit some 6 years later, nothing has changed xcept it is quiter and getting bigger.

The fountain of wealth is clearly the highlight and there is a big supermarket. It is close but not really next to the flyer."
,,It is split into four towers...what else can i say...its huge,4.0,,"Its a office block first and shopping mall second but even then you will get all the shopping you can get at suntec.

It has intermediate priced brands...not the high end brands at orchard road.

If you are staying nearby this is all you need for shopping"
,,A gigantic supermarket!,5.0,,"Visited in August, 2014
Glad to find a supermarket to buy some fruit and a few groceries instead of relying on hotels and restaurants while on holiday.
It was about a 20 minute walk from the Pan Pacific and the cool mall was a god send after walking in the 75 percent humidity!
Plenty of retail shops (cheaper than most), plus eating places, but there are several towers linked by walkways, making it a little confusing for the first time visitor."
,,Quite confusing mall !,3.0,,"Sort of got a bit lost , the directional signage could be improved further , plenty of shops here to shop and eat too , it is linked to The Convention Centre so that makes it convenient for those attending a conference and some shopping"
,,Just another shopping mall,1.0,,"There are several towers and bits to this mall and the walk-ways between them are boring. Boring shops too: nothing special at all.
Handy to get to my hotel (Pan Pacific - excellent) and the subway.
Of no architectural merit. No classy shops either - you need The Shoppes at marina Bay Sands for that.
Not busy on any of the occasions that I went thorough it."
,,Another Americanized Mall,3.0,,"Although this mall is very similar to malls in the U.S, and prices are actually a bit higher is a great place to cool down indoors after walking outside all day. The food court on the lower level is a great place to get an authentic Singaporean dinner as well. You can also walk into the Fountain of Wealth in the evening."
,,My shopping place,4.0,,"This is the place where my friend and ex-colleague took me to, to buy dresses for my daughters. Very large options, and the discount sale that was going on before the Singapore Independence Day ensured that the prices were within reach."
,,Great place to spend time indoors,4.0,,"If you want to escape the heat or the rain, this mall is a good place to spend time in. It adjoins the Convention centre which hosts exhibitions and even events like Flea Markets, sometimes with free entries. It's good to check what events are on in the Convention centre before visiting the mall so that you can spend a good part of the day there. In between the Convention Centre and shops, you find The Fountain of Youth which is pretty spacious with lots of water shoots forming like a fountain. Good for photo stop and quick stroll. Facing the Fountain of Youth you will find lots of restaurants - Asian and western food. If you want Chinese dim sum, Crystal Jade is a good choice. There's Food Republic - Singapore food court. The mall houses a variety of chain shops and upmarket brands. Just good to wander round or if you want to buy something from chain shops. Otherwise, other shops are pretty pricey."
,,Anyway big mall,4.0,,"I think Suntec City Mall is biggest shopping mall in Singapore.
There are five big buildings and conected by corridor each other.
If you want to go around all, you need one day at least.
When you go to the Suntec City Mall, please do not get lost youself."
,,$ ^ Million Fountain of Wealth,3.0,,"The Suntec Shopping Mall , is located near the City Hall MRT , a short walk from the MRT exit towards the northeast would bring you there.The Mall itself is located on Tower 1, linkable to Tower 2 and 3.The Mall itself has no differences compared to other shopping malls , i think this Mall is even smaller compared to other Malls in Singapore.
The highlight of this Mall is the Fountain of Wealth , you can experience walking around the Fountain , touching the water , throw away some coins and make a wish.
Food republic food court here is my all time favorite.
Worth a visit"
,,Very expensive but great eating spots,2.0,,This is like so many of Singapore shopping areas...too much of the same top end fashion brands and way too expensive. You know years ago Singapore use to be the place to go to get a great bargain...not anymore (same for Hong Kong). This area does however offer a range a nice quiet eating areas.
,,5 tower mall,3.0,,"this mall is consist of 5 tower and in the middle of it you can found fountain of wealth
you can find many fiid court or cafe surronding the fountain
if you want to take picture or just throw some money for luck in the fountain, you better go in the morning..

i was go to this mall becouse i want to ride duck tour, and its counter is in this mall"
,,Cool Mall,4.0,,"This is a great place to shop! You could spend days there so many stores within a really clean and cool environment, There is a great food court there which seems to be a favorite of locals. It has a huge variety of fantastic food cooked on the spot and very cheap! I think it was on level 3 and it wasn't called a food court I think it started with K. Worth finding if you're wandering about. There is also a great tour desk/operator just behind the Adidas shop (outside) On top of all of this its center piece in the worlds largest fountain!"
,,Too Spread Out,3.0,,"To be honest I was not a big fan of this mall.

Yeah they have all the shops one needs, it is modern, well a/c'd and pleasant to look at. However (and I may be wrong) the various sections of the mall are not even in the same building, and one has to cross the street to get to the other side. When I was there it was raining heavily, so this was a major inconvenience to me.

As I said, I could be wrong and there could be other ways of accessing the other parts of the mall, but if so they are not well sign-posted. For me, in the shoppers paradise that is Singapore, there are significantly better options than this place."
,,Cool mall with the worlds biggest fountain,4.0,,This mall has been built to bring fortune to the seller. It has 5 towers representing the 5 fingers of the hand and in the middle is the worlds largest fountain the Fountain of Wealth. I'm not really into shopping but this place is OK and good for people watching.
,,Great Mall..shop till u drop,5.0,,I love this mall.its a great place..shop till you drop..a lot of place to visit.. Very clean even the restrooms.place to dine in are just around the corners..
,,Good place to walking at the mall,4.0,,"The place are big and have 5 towers in this mall and have it meaning. This mall is our hand that why got 5 towers. The 5 towers represent 5 fingers center have water fall fountain is represent our center palms.
The water fountain also give them fortune."
,,Fantastic Shopping,5.0,,"Just another fantastic shopping mall, offering high end retail and mid range retail. well laid out and very clean, well worth a visit."
,,Dazzling mall with great shopping choices,5.0,,"Really liked this mall! The architecture was very nice and high-tech, made shopping ambience much better. Lots of shop variety and food choices as well, and the mall is spacious (not that many people so you won't get squished!). It's quite easy to walk around the mall, some highlights include H&M and other clothes shops (clothes were reasonably priced as I bought two polo shirts for about 29 SGD which isn't bad!)

Overall, a great shopping ambience and something for everyone!"
,,Suntec City re-opens,4.0,,"Suntec City re-opening soon I think. Some stores are still closed. But Alive Museum is open today! I think when more stores are open, it will be much more buzzing then."
,,Not that big,4.0,,"Good for a quick walk around and for quick shopping. Not a very big mall in comparison to all the other malls in Singapore. Uniqlo is located on the ground floor, do not miss it."
,,Renovated,3.0,,"We decided to visit this place after some time as there is some renovation work taking place.

There seems to be more eateries these days after their renovation and everything looks fresh. There used to be a Carrefour here but it has since changed to giant as Carrefour had exited Singapore.

Shopping wise, pretty good mix of retail shops catering to different crowd. There is a sincere watch store located here for the more upmarket shoppers and there are also lots of good and cheap apparel stores around like giordano and cotton-on.

This is also where the fountain of wealth is located.

There's a Starbucks near the convention centre. And yes, there was an IT show going on here at the convention centre. Whenever there is a show, this place tends to get crowded. Overall not a bad place to chill out and walk around on a hot Sunday afternoon."
,,Renovation in some parts,3.0,,Some parts of this mall are still under renovation. The other parts where renovation have been completed are quite pleasant. Especially like the Toast Box cafe facing the fountain!
,,Yet another great Singapore shoppoing experience!,4.0,,"A very fine Singapore shopping mall with plenty of space, comfort, shopping options, food opotions and well positioned. Maybe it is a bit touristy but it is good for people watching and the very close by fountain of wealth presents a great photo opportunity. Also fairly close to the Singapore Flyer and the Raffles Hotel as well. A great spot!"
,,A fairly anonymous block of retail outlets,2.0,,"Suntec City Mall is a rather large development that as of last November didnt' even appear to be fully finished/full. It is your typically vacuous shopping mall that didn't seem to have a lot going for it. Unlike the Shoppes at Marina Bay where you could wander through as a bit of a curio and wonder to yourself just who would have the cash to shop there, there was no such theme at Suntec City Mall. In fact the shops looked just like any other shopping centre place I'd ever been to anywhere else in the world. You may find yourself here if you are on one of those hop-on/hop-off buses as they seem to be stopping here but it is a tiny bit out of the CBD and not really near any other major attractions that I could discern. As of November 2013 it's just a big shopping mall."
,,A Reasonably Priced Mall,4.0,,"Apparently Suntec City isn't what it used to be. It was actually reasonable, though, compared to the other crazy shopping centers (Marina Bay). There were actually some stores here where I could buy things and the kids loved Cotton On. There was also a shop for renting a Ferrari for an hour which was cheaper than other similar places. The Fountain of Wealth is a nice take but certainly not worth solely coming for. The food court was excellent and clean."
,,A shadow of it's former self,3.0,,"A few years ago Suntec City Mall was one of Singapore's largest and among it's better shopping malls. It is no longer so. It is still a good mall with a decent selection of stores and restaurants but still not what it used to be.
A big blow came with the loss of French supermarket Carrefour which closed it's Singapore outlets about a year and a half ago."
,,Half the centre is closed for renovations,3.0,,"It's not that great! The only highlight is the fountain of youth and H&M. Otherwise I found the shopping centre relatively hard to locate, the entrance was fairly hard to located, possibly because of the renovations, or the location in which my taxi stopped, but I walked around for a while wondering if I had the right location.

I would have liked to have seen a department store like iSetan in the centre. I'm unlikely to return to the centre.

Also, if you're a tourist, don't bother getting the tourist pass, only a handful of stores participate."
,,Shopping with a class!,5.0,,"This is our favorite place to find great sale of sporting goods. The Royal Sports House offer drop down sales year-round. you can not resist to buy branded shoes and outfit here. Believe me, we were able to get 6 pairs of shoes in a bargain. We thought that it's old stock.. but when we saw our shoes in the new arrival section in our country's mall after six months. We realized that what we have bought were indeed good deals."
,,Cool water fountain,5.0,,"The biggest water fountain! It has fortune fountain that says if someone touches the water while get a round for 3 times, will bring wealth to the one.

It has 5 tower that connected, very big, love to being here. It has giant carrefour inside and toy r us.

You could get lost easily if you're not aware."
,,Large mall and good location,4.0,,"Like the title says, this is large place full of shops and restaurants. MRT station near, so easy to get. Their main attraction is Fountain of wealth(there are shows several times a day)"
,,Very nice and big Mall,4.0,,"This is a very nice Mall, Big and have so many shops. Lots of Brand name shops. It is on the route of the hop-on hop-off buses ;)."
,,Really bad stores,2.0,,"Suntec city mall has a few big brand clothing stores, such as h & m and uniqlo. The rest of the stores are all mostly generic cheaply made stuff from China. The shopping malls on Orchard are much much better."
,,Great Shops and Great Deals,5.0,,I like that the Fountain of Wealth is there. My 4-year old nephew and the rest of my family enjoyed ourselves there. We got great deals mostly from Lacoste and H&M which made a significant dent on our credit cards. Great food choices too.
,,Central Location,4.0,,"Nice mall in a good central location in Singapore. Huge mall with all types of stores from high end to budget. Easy to get around, lots of taxi stands, bus stops and the MRT as well. The Duck/Hippo hop on hop off sightseeing tours start here, so good place to get the day started. With walking distance to Pan Pacific, The Conrad, Raffles etc"
,,Good Shopping Mall - Best location to access to Duck tours & Hop on/ Hop off City Sights buses - Central Location,4.0,,Suntec City is a shopping mall made up of five buildings. It has recently been refurbished. We stayed at the Intercontinental and found Suntec was a daily starting point to access the Hippo City Sightseeing Hop on/Hop Off Buses which leave from the back of tower 5 every 15 minutes. There are good shops in this centre. We were able to easily walk to Suntec in less than 10 minutes from our hotel so it made a good base for us to jump on the buses to explore Singapore.
,,Huge place to shop,4.0,,"Gotta love huge malls! It lacks a little character but it makes uo in size and variety! Wish they had wifi in tower 5 though, didn't test the others"
,,Garden in the roof,4.0,,"I went there to see Fountain of Wealth but it's in construction. what a pity, but I found out the garden in the roof, where I can see the Fountain of Wealth a little :D. but the garden is nice!"
,,Biggest Mall In Singapore,4.0,,"A considerable Mall, pleasant enough for tourists who first saw it. Recommended for shopping lovers even though the price is a bit expensive but the stuff I feel pretty qualified goods.

There is a famous fountain named fountain of wealth and there is a park named sky garden as the name implies is located on the top floor of the mall, the park is quite beautiful and comfortable place to rest for while after shopping.

Somewhat difficult to find a restaurant and food court because it was dispersed, many restaurants on the bottom floor near the fountain of wealth with an expensive price while there are cheaper food court floor on the top floor of the mall. To go here just take the MRT to Citty Hall station or simply by taxi."
,,Refurbished,3.0,,"I visited this mall and noticed it has been refurbished recently. Plenty of new shops like Lush, Laniege, H&M and Uniqlo. Did not notice many food options but read reviews about good choices of food - i will explore the next time. This is a good venue for shopping at H&M and Uniqlo as it is not as crowded as Orchard Road."
,,I don't care for the mall itself but the food court is good if you are looking for reasonable price @ this neighborhood,4.0,,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands on our last night in Singapore, which was very close to this Suntec Mall. A friend of mine came picked us up and drove us to this Suntec mall's food court inside the Towel #2 basement for dinner, where she used to come here by MRT. We were not here to shop but the food court, as far as I remember, there are few areas where you can eat. Once we parked the car, up from the garage on the ground level off to one side of the mall, not sure which tower was, this food court is very small, we did not eat there. One was up on the 3rd floor where you could take escalator up, they are more like restaurants style than food court. My goal was to try as many food court or hawker food hall as possible while we were in Singapore. We found our way to the basement after asking some merchants in the mall. It is under the Tower 2 basement, although one side is still under construction but the other side is opened for business, where we had a wonderful dinner. The food court is bright and clean with comfortable seating. I learnt that there is a different between food court than hawker food hall. Food court has air conditioning and padded seats, bright and clean atmosphere, often local inside shopping mall. Hawker food hall does not have air con and no padded seat, often local right where the food and vegetable wet market is, which is slightly darker (lighting) but still clean though, consequently, hawker hall is cheaper in price than food court. Still I had been to total food courts (air con) in Singapore, the price was still very economical compare to eating at a restaurant.
Anyway, my friend wants us to try many different cuisines from different stands inside the food court. We ordered two different Indian vegetarian food, a assorted chinese BBQ pork and roasted pork (my flavorite), 3 different Thai dishes, and the Singapore Malaysian blend of cuisines, such as Rojak and some vegetarian rolls, plus a bowl of Lasak noodles. We also bought some freshly squeezed/blended juices. They were all good! See photos.Each plate of food we ordered was under Sg 10, some were as cheap as few dollars, they were still delicious!
So if you find yourself in this neighborhood, do make a stop to this food court, worth the money!"
,,Make you choice and buy at great prices,5.0,,"The Suntec is a large above ground mall where many types of items are on sale. It also houses a good local food outlet with noodle dishes and dim sung available, well cooked and enjoyed by the locals, always a good sign.
Clothing, electrical, fashion and other varied shops are housed here. Quality is good and fairly well priced. Another place to return to, with each visit to Singapore."
,,Fountain in construction,4.0,,went there on the last day of vacation to see the fountain of wealth. It's a pity that it's been in construction! Too bad!
,,"Average Mall, Good Stores",4.0,,This mall was close to our hotel and so we went shopping there. There are some good stores that offer reasonably prices clothing and other goods. A nice selection of restaurants is available. It is the hub for the Hop-on Hop-off tours so it is quite a busy place. Worth a visit to. If you are looking for high-end stores this is not the place to find them.
,,"Hub for DUCKtours. Ok mall, but food court under construction.",3.0,,"Suntec is the hub for all the hop on hop off buses and also the DUCKtour and bus to Sentosa. Of course, we had to get here via the hop on hop off bus each time, so we heard the story about the Fountain of Wealth about 4 times in 2 days. :P

Nicely air-conditioned, so fantastic for a respite from the Singapore heat while waiting for our next attraction. Unfortunately, even though we bought the ultimate Singapore Pass, we still had to exchange our coupons for the actual DUCKtour ticket... which meant queuing up again inside instead of just hopping on the next DUCK.

Between the DUCKtour and Sentosa bus, we decided to grab a quick lunch at the food court. Wandering around downstairs, we discovered... there's hardly anything to eat! Pretty much everything was under construction and we had very limited choices. :( The skeleton of the new food court looked quite impressive though, so once it's up and running, it should look quite grand."
,,Please avoid,1.0,,"The mall is on renovation and it is a construction site , waste of time ,money and energy to visit sun tech city, tourisim department should have warned tourist about the renovation"
,,Poor Experience,1.0,,"We have been blinded by its size and thought if this is so big that it is even in over 5 towers it must be something very special. But it is not. Very poor stocked shops with poorly educated staff. Not something I would send somebody to. We have been to VIVOCOTY, had a fabtastic shopping experience and this is so much better."
,,more upmarket now than before,3.0,,"As the title suggests, Suntec City has now gone upmarket. Nowadays, most of the stores are higher end fashions, etc. Once upon a time, they catered for just about everybody. The size of the shopping centre still appears to be the same, with the five towers, but every time we visit Singapore this large shopping centre seems to lose some character. Carrefour still survives, but even that has changed over the years. The food court on the bottom level is always busy, with the many food stalls selling an array of cheap but filling food. perhaps those two items are really the outstanding features of Suntec City nowadays. it is a pity, as we used to spend many hours wandering around. For the first time visitor, Suntec City might be a novelty, but repeat visitors will soon find that the novelty wears thin."
,,Avoid at all cost,1.0,,"My office is in Suntec and everything about the area is inconvenient. They have started making repairs recently which makes getting here harder than usual. It seems that they did not think it through and now several parts are restricted to traffic. Instead of doing piece by piece they went all out, It is a nightmare. It is usually tough to get around, but now it is even harder.

We are likely to move offices soon. It is unbearable"
,,Nothing out of the ordinary,2.0,,Suntec is just an ordinary shopping centre. It is big and confusing to get around and most shops do not open till late - well after 10 o'clock.
,,Quick shopping destination,4.0,,"I really like that in Suntec Tower 2, they have Royal Sporting House that sells sports apparels, shoes and equipment. I went in July and September and both times they have sales up to 70%. Choices are good and I got great deals both times. And then in Tower 4, they have Guardian clearance sales, (also available in both of my visits). Good deals."
,,An expanse of a mall,3.0,,"This mall just keeps going. Like many of the malls in Singapore, there are a lot of them, you would not know they are there unless you were to venture in.

A long mall with a good variety of ""affordable"" stores and Carrefour for those wanting to stock up on food stuff.

Nothing special about this mall, a typical good selection of shops. Nothing too high end."
,,Not A Forgettable Mall,4.0,,"I stumbled upon this mall after walking around the city for hours. Hoping to just a few minutes of rest, I ended up tiring myself further as the mall is large. It has a wide range of stores - from clothing to culinary. If you're already in the area, take a time to look around."
,,Nice Mall,5.0,,"This mall is home to some amazing shops and a brilliant food court. It has just about everything at reasonable prices. Another added bonus is that the fountain of wealth is also located here. Do visit, you wont be disappointed."
,,Mall & Fountain of Wealth,4.0,,Another lovely big shopping plaza to visit and shop. I really enjoyed the fountain of wealth to walk around (feng shui) and also the cod fish and water features. Connects underground all the way back to raffles city
,,Do not get lost in SunTec Mall.,4.0,,"The SunTec shopping mall is situated around the 5 towers of SunTec city, which form a symbolic fingers and thumb of a hand. Furthermore, in SunTec city, accessible from the basement of the shopping mall, is the famous Fountain of Wealth. I remember, when I was in Singapore the first time in my life, in the beginning of the 90ties of last century, SunTec City had just opened the doors. One taxi driver we drove with then, recommended a visit, notwithstanding that SunTec was ""a bit off the beaten track"". When you look at Singapore in 2012, you can hardly believe that that statement was true! In that time, hardly half of the shops in SunTec were in business. It is also hard to believe that. When you visit the SunTec shopping mall now, it is two levels chock full of shops, market stalls, restaurants, bars and it is easy to get lost and emerge from the mall at a completely different side then you intended to. Furthermore, from the SunTec mall you can reach the Marina Bay mall (by a covered walkway) and Raffles City mall (underground through the metro corridor system) without getting hot or wet from the weather outside. When I was there in April 2012, I got the impression that a refurbishment of part of the SunTec Mall would be on it's way very shortly. This shopping mall is to be recommended, in any case for the abundant number of restaurants and eateries."
,,A good mall,4.0,,"This mall was close to our hotel (Mandarin Oriental) and was easily accessible and a great mall to visit in the evening as well. Good range of shops and an outstanding food court, although it seems renovations to some areas are imminent."
,,good mall,4.0,,suntec city mall was located in a peace place near by the river side. It was located at the nice place.
,,"Lots to do, great places to eat",5.0,,"We really enjoyed the five towers of the Suntec City Mall. The Fountain of Wealth and we even attended church there on Sunday. The shops are not as expensive as Orchard or Marina Bay, but there is a lot of variety and the food court has authentic food (it was always crowded which is a good sign). The Hop On bus stops there and is a major hub for it, which is convenient."
,,Huge but manageable with great food options,4.0,,"This mall goes on forever, like a grand souk, with hallways and shops and atriums and food courts on different levels in different towers all linked together. The ground floor food court near the convention center is worth a visit in itself, as a sort of themed setting of old Singapore street food, with wonderful inexpensive eating options -- it seems like all the local office workers go there for breakfast and lunch."
,,Best chicken rice from a food stall,4.0,,"We had chicken rice all over Singapore and this was where we had the best. Flavorful, juicy and cheap! Wish we could go back. Lots of shopping choices too."
,,Best Place to visit on Sunday,4.0,,"On 19th Feb 2012, we attended City Harvest Church service at Suntec Convention Center led by Canon J John from UK. The title of his message was ""What have you done with Jesus' invitation. We enjoyed it very much. Highly recommend everyone to visit Suntec Convention Center every sunday at 10 am to attend the beautiful church service.

,,Decent Mall - plenty of shops - Main stop for Hop on Hop off bus,4.0,,Mall was huge and easy to get lost in. Mall is right across from the Conrad hotel which was convenient for us. Great food court in the mall with lots of variety. There is also a supermarket on the far side if you are looking to avoid spending huge sums of money on water and soda when you are out an about. This mall also has the main stop for the hop on hop off bus which was convenient and inexpensive transportation around town.
,,very big mall,5.0,,This mall is a bit far from the city but very big. you will find here high end shops.
,,Good way to see the city,4.0,,Buses were prompt. The river tour was a good addition. Commentary was bit weak though.
,,Relaxing Mall,4.0,,"There is a carrefour supermarket. Is the largest shopping mall in Singapore. There are buses and also train . You can walk from city hall via the underground city link which takes 15 min. Suntec is linked to esplande and Millenium Walk and also marina square.
There is a big food court surrounding the fountain. There are two money charger there."
,,Great Location,4.0,,Great location to our hotel with loads of shops and eating outlets to choose from.
,,Nice attraction,4.0,,"I like the cool zodiac animal things at the fountain top, and the concept of the fountain of wealth is wonderful. There are great shops and on the bottom floor, theres every type of asian cuisine available, from sushi and chinese to korean grills and malaysian nyonya."
,,"Night Fountain Of Wealth Show Is Awesome, Good Shops",4.0,,We caught the night show of the fountain of wealth which is awesome to see and experience. It's amazing what they can do with all those lights and the fountain. There's a pretty good range of shops and places to eat.
,,A squarish mediocre mall,3.0,,Its a dull squarish shape like a warehouse. Perhaps because its also houses some convention centres. The shops is a mix of mid range to high end. Shoppers are likely to be the ones who go to the conventions or some shows like the annual IT or Comex shows. Or the office workers at the nearby office towers n hotels guests from the nearby hotels as well as the duck n hippo tours riders.
,,"Not as good as Eon but location, fountain and food court lift its score.",4.0,,"Spent a day here shopping and trying out wacky meals in the food court.
As with all Singapore it's easily reached via the MRT, get off at Esplanade on the Circle Line.
The mall is designed to look like a left hand (from the air anyway) and is easily a day out if fine shopping is on your to do list in Singapore.
Hundreds of stores, food court to tempt about every pallet and allegedly the world's largest fountain. (Be advised though, the fountain drops water downwards into the water rather than fires it up into the air. Worth a look all the same).
Carrefour, Singapore's largest hypermarket is also part of the mall and has an eye watering array of things you don't normally see in western stores (case of beer at SGD103 or £50 for one thing ! ).
We also found Suntec's location a bonus as it was walkable to the Singapore Flyer in about 15 minutes.
On the downside, it's not as central as Eon on Orchard road, or dare I say as high end, but that's not a criticism if you've been to Eon.
All in all, we really liked Suntec and you really must try the food court for its variety at least.
Take a look at our travel map, we joined TA late in life and only review the places we have been to since joining. You may wish to trust our judgment on this mall."
,,Posh location,3.0,,"Suntec city mall is opposite many famous Hotel like Pan Pacific, Mandarin Oriental, etc. There are all in 5 buildings of Suntec each having exclusive shopping outlets.

There is a Fountain of Wealth, but to our disappointment is was not working on that day.

We went at evening time and we sat outside at seating area and had some snacks and it was really amazing to see surrounded by high rises."
,,"I didn't like it, go to marina time next to it",2.0,,"The sahopping mall is small and the halls are narrow. Also, there is no very many brands in the mall. Basically, it is a food court for those who work in the business towers around it."
,,Good shopping and home of the Worlds Largest Fountain!,4.0,,"Not as modern or bustling as Orchard Road but definitely worth a visit for shopping fans, especially during the June/July sales period!
Aside from the bargains the mall is also home to the Fountain of Wealth - the largest fountain in the world. Definitely worth negotiating your way through the shops to have a look and make a wish."
,,coming back soon!!,5.0,,"Love the Suntec Mall- my favourite in Singapore. We are coming back later this year and this is number 1 on places to go for me. Great shops and the restaurants are good too- mid priced ones down near the fountain basement. You certainly can get lost here!!!! Yes light show not that amazing but enjoyable enough to watch once.

Cindy"
,,A Mall - but the Observation Deck is Great,4.0,,"The mall itself is, frankly, just a big mall. Nice place, but all the standard stores. More than the standard restaurants so it is a safe place to find dinner - wide variety. The best part is that they have a tour that takes you up on the roof with fantatastic views. This does involve climbing some stairs. It's not really an observation deck - you are on the roof. But if you are a fan of this type of thing it's great.

Not great is the Fountain of Wealth. Go by in the day, do the 3 times around for luck. But the light show they do is pathetic. Mostly writing peoples dedications with a laser, and if you're not one of them, you don't care. A marked contrast to the fountain on Sentosa which was great."
