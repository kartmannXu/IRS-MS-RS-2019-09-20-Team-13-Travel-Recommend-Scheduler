,,Good visit,5.0,,Loved the experience of this visit the culture & heretage.. A good experience & recommended to all as a good learning centre of the culture of this country.
,,Excellent detail,5.0,,"The Chinatown Heritage Centre in Singapore is a fantastic interactive museum, one of the most detailed, comprehensive and accessible museums I've been to. Definitely worth the entry fee, this centre is engaging with rooms dedicated to following the life of a family and tenants who lived in the shop there in the 1950s. This personalisation of history was highly engaging, as were the still life exhibits. If anything, there's so much detail and information that by the end of it you may leave feeling overwhelmed. You could easily spend two hours or more here, and it's worth visiting just to get out of the Singaporean humidity. The audio guide was very informative, otherwise wander at your own pace. I'd recommend to anyone wanting to learn a little bit about life in post-war Singapore."
,,Real life displays of olden days,3.0,,"Everything here is done to replicate the olden days & I must say they did a a good job. If they can use technology to make this visit more interactive, it will be even better. Oh, did I say the admission fee is rather high? Try to look for a discount coupon if you can."
,,Authentic and engaging,5.0,,"A few members of my family, my girlfriend, and I were taken on a tour of the exhibit by a guide by the name of Guan. The members of my family with us were children living in Singapore during the time period the exhibit is showcasing. It was fascinating to see the time period in which they grew up and how different it was to the time period I grew up in. I immediately knew it was authentic when my aunt began to freak out when we entered the first room.

Guan really made the tour fun, unique, informative, and engaging. He would involve both the younger and older members of our group by making jokes and asking us to make guesses about what certain rooms and objects were meant for.

In summary, this tour was unexpected in its quality in the best of ways and I would recommend it to any of my friends heading to Singapore."
,,This place is a dad joke,1.0,,"It is outrageous that this center charges 16 Singapore dollars to see a run-down so-called museum with cheap costumes, ornaments, and photos. The informational content is close to zero. This is not worth your time even if it were free. Go to the National Gallery or the Asian Civilizations Museum instead. These are first-rate. The people running this “cultural center”. should be ashamed of themselves."
,,A dive into a bleak and foreign existence.,5.0,,"Situated in the heart of Chinatown and thoughtfully displayed over three storeys. The often brutally short lives of early chinese migrants, abductees as well as political and economic refugees, unfolds via an audiovisual presentation set against a backdrop of props true to the periods covered.
One gains an insight into the lives and struggles of the people instrumental in building Singapore into the grand city that we now cherish and enjoy.
Enjoyable despite the gravity of the subject matter.
Allow yourself at least a couple of hours for the full experience."
,,Excellent Audio Guide to an Amazing Museum!,5.0,,"This museum is a clock stopped in time! We spent over two hours inside with an excellent audio guide that explained everything very well. It is quite eye-opening to see what the Chinese experienced, and some of it not so long ago.

The authorities did the right thing preserving this one shop house to explain how people used to live and to bring home some of the problems that the first Chinese immigrants faced. Some of that history is quite harrowing and it shows how much we take for granted in our comfortable lives today."
,,Great museum,5.0,,Great museum to undertand the history of Chinese people in Singapore. Very good audio/video guide. Very interesting for kids as well. Must do in Chinatown.
,,""" Great History""",5.0,,"This was a great experience to see how the people lived. It only costs $15 singapore to go in, you will need about 3+ hours to take your time in there. It is about 100 metres to the MRT Station China Town, or buses,taxis. in the cost when you come out you can get free dumplings and a drink at some outlets when you show your ticket.It,s Good Value."
,,Chinatown Heritage Centre Singapore China town,5.0,,"Great place to visit in the heart of Chinatown, near the food street and local markets. My kids 6 and 12 y.o. both were so interested ...they were very quite and involved. Audio guide provides detailed explanations, real life stories. Museum rooms have lots of interesting historic details. The place is full of photo zones. Very informative and authentic! highly recommended!"
,,A Walk Through Time,4.0,,"As a former resident in Singapore (during the 1970's), much of what is displayed here provoked many memories of conditions and practices then still in existence. So, for us, it was a trip down memory lane. However, while no longer a reflection of today, it does provide visitors, enhanced through audio-visual displays, an exceptional impression of life in Chinatown during the 20th century."
,,Amazing Museum,5.0,,"This museum not only showcases in depth life for migrants in historic Singapore, but it really highlights the life of most overseas Chinese. The migrant experience showcased is reflected all over the world and not necessarily those of the Chinese in Singapore. The curators really took time to tell the lives and stories of these people who built Singapore and there is a lot of love and pride in this museum. Love the audio/visual guide and how well thought out the whole experience was.

I loved my free egg tart afterwards too!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This was one of the highlights of our 9 days in Singapore with two of our grand daughters. They absolutely loved the 'real world displays"" of how people lived in the early days of the city state's existence. The staff were very helpful and the audio/visual units available were the best we have encountered anywhere."
,,Eye-opening and quite moving,5.0,,"Visiting this museum, housed in old shop-houses in Chinatown, was fascinating but also sobering at the same time. To learn that people lived in such cramped conditions with minimal, if any, comforts, in order to make a way from themselves and their families in a new country was eye-opening."
,,In-depth history about the Chinese,5.0,,We decided to stop in and check it out and glad we did. Fantastic in-depth information given through a talking service as well as models and items of history. It was excellent good value for money.
,,super interesting!,5.0,,"i think it’s a must stop! you will get to know more about singapore. personally i thought this museum iwas better than the indian heritage center. if going to chinatown, dont miss it. you need at least an hour for the visit though"
,,Fantastic place- not to be missed,5.0,,It was worth the time and money to visit the Centre! I love places that recreate a place so that you can feel what it was like. The multimedia guide was full of interesting information about the Chinese who came to Singapore. It even had an interview with one of the former tenants who lived there as a child. We spent over two hours there. The bonus was free egg tart with each ticket at a bakery that was part of the exhibit.
,,With guests,4.0,,my guests loved the entire atmosphere as they took their time to enjoy all the little cultural heritage of singapore.
,,Very interesting place,5.0,,We visited here to get a bit of history about the area and we weren't disappointed. Your entry price gets you an audio guide as well and this was really handy. Loads and loads of information about the chinese migrants and how they helped build Singapore into what it is today. Only one slightly negative comment is that the audio description could be quite lengthy at times and we felt ourselves skipping it sometimes.
,,Superb museum; don't miss it!,5.0,,"An excellent multi-story museum that tells the many stories of Chinese immigrants to Singapore. The building was previously the site of a tailor's shop on the ground floor, and various living quarters above. The visit is supported by a small multi-media device (images, sounds) that provided heaps of information - perhaps even at times, too much information, as it was hard to concentrate on the device as well as the stimuli around me via my other senses. If you are interested in how Chinese Singapore came about, there simply isn't a better place to find out about it. Various family living quarters are explained in detail, as are various circumstances of the era (mid-19th to mid-20th century, roughly). A fascinating couple of hours, that could well have been even longer than that. Very highly recommended."
,,See how people lived in Chinatown in the 1950's,5.0,,"The Chinatown Heritage Centre is actually a museum that offers visitors the opportunity to experience life as it was for tenants living in Chinatown in the 1950's with a handheld multimedia device that shows photos, videos and sound. Located in a large old shophouse that has been converted into this large museum in Pagoda Street it is right in the heart of Chinatown.

The cost for adults is S$18 with the multimedia guide and S$25 for a guided tour and S$14 and S$20 for children respectively. Senior citizens can access free if accompanied by a paying visitor with an additional charge of S$3 for the multimedia guide. Inside the museum you can see a tailor's shop, rooms belonging to people practicing different trades in olden days. Other parts of the museum give you the feeling that you are actually in old Chinatown. You will see how cooks, shoemakers and other tradesmen lived, and there is even an old kitchen.

The museum is fully air-conditioned and very well laid out. With the multimedia guide I found that the visit took around an hour to complete.

I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and would highly recommend coming here especially if you'd like to get a feel of how people in Chinatown lived 50 or 60 years ago."
,,If you have time...just wander...,5.0,,This is so interesting to learn about the history of the Chinese immigrants. I love China Town and love the people there. It is definatly worth a visit ...but take your time...
,,An extraordinary place and Singapore not that long ago.,5.0,,"This is a remarkable museum, which gives you an insight into life in Singapore not that long ago: the 1950s. That really made me appreciate how far Singapore has come so quickly. Well worth a visit."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,We visited the Hertiage centre and learnt so much about China town's history. Quite a few steps to climb. Well worth a visit.
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,"What an interesting journey learning about the history of Chinese immigrants in the establishment of Singapore. Our group of 5 (one in a wheelchair) thoroughly enjoyed the time spent here, don;t rush it though as there is quite a lot to see & do. Allow 23 hours to cover the interesting displays & facts presented in various forms so it isn't boring in the least. The Staff were very friendly & helpful to ensure that our disabled friend could also access all areas of the centre."
,,Rude staff,1.0,,"Went there at evening time while passing by. So my friend and me decided to have a visit. However we did not realize it is closed with lights on and some visitors walking around around the entrance area. While we were planned to buy tickets,one of the staff just told us in a very rude way: we are closed if you realized. Well, if we know that, we will never stepped in. Very unpleasant experience with this place even though we have not went in."
,,A taste of early Singapore,4.0,,"In the bustling streets of current Singapore, there are many things forgotten of the olden days. But you can still have a glimpse of the early immigrants' lives in Singapore at Chinatown Heritage Centre. It's a little gallery that is housed in 3 shophouses, depicting lives of our forefathers...it's not to be missed when you are in Chinatown.."
,,Must visit,5.0,,We spent more than 2 hours in this place that offers a very interesting and interactive visit to learn more about the history of Chinese people who moved to Singapore. Really well done.
,,Outstanding Experience at Heritage Centre,5.0,,"We went to the Chinatown Heritage Centre yesterday and participated in a 2 hour tour with tour-guide Karen. The building itself is huge and amazing, with so much history, but the tour absolutely brought the whole history of Chinatown and the old shop-house to life! Karen was such a brilliant guide, balancing the history and stories with the wonderful displays throughout the centre. She was so fascinating, with so much knowledge of Chinatown, and with a great sense of humour as well. She was also incredibly considerate of my 70-something mother-in-law and made sure she could take the elevator or sit as needed. We were so glad we went and I will certainly bring visitors here when they come to Singapore in the future."
,,Another great activity if it is raining,5.0,,"Get out of the rain and enjoy this immersive experience with the audio commentary. If you're short of time, skip levels 1 and 2 and concentrate on everything on level 3. Would imagine it would take at least 2 hours to do the whole thing comprehensively but very well done and very informative. Really about Chinatown life from 1950's onwards."
,,History,4.0,,You get a feel of the history of Singapore & being able to physically see it made it much more interesting
,,Allow at least two hours for your visit,5.0,,"We really enjoyed our visit to the Heritage Centre and learned so much about life in the early days when up to a hundred people might share a property with very basic living amenities. From the front of the building, we thought it might be a half hour visit but there were so many rooms and so much to read about that we stayed for two hours. Well worth the 6$ entrance fee for adults.Great to hear about how the area developed with Sir Stanley Raffles re-locating different ethnic groups to different areas of Singapore and how Chinatown grew & developed over many decades."
,,Really interesting,4.0,,"I found this place really interesting. $18 entry fee gets you the audio guide as well. I spent about 90 minutes here but could easily have spent an hour more. The audio guide and the pictures on the device tell lots of stories about the people that live in the building and how they got here and how they lived. It is quite a revelation to realise just how many people lived in the building.
The audio guide earpieces started to make my ears hurt after a while so towards the end of the visit I had stopped listening to the audio and just looked at the exhibits, but if you are interested in history then you should go and allow a couple of hours."
,,The highlight of any Singapore visit.,5.0,,"Anyone ho visits Singapore must visit Chinatown. Apart from the heritage centre and the beautiful temples and mosques, the vibrant Chinese markets and eatery stalls, every trinket or item of clothing, but most of all the ambience of the whole place is well worth a visit.
Most likely the cheapest place to buy food and anything else in Singapore."
,,"What Chinatown looked like a long, long time ago...",5.0,,"I really liked this little place that captured the old Chinatown so well in air-con comfort and with the audio guide, it is a well-made throw back into the past.

As a S'porean, I was impressed enough to want to also bring my parents here for a visit. They could relate to it as they lived through the 1950/60s.

Definitely, a must visit for first-time visitors to Chinatown to see what it was like before and then step outside and see it today.

PS. The Chinatown Complex where the wet market and food court is located has been closed for 3 months for a major renovation till 31 May 2019."
,,"nice place, great prices",4.0,,"You can find almost everything, though, do check the prices with amazon or e bay, right now, I'm noticing that somethings, were better priced in e bay. But they do have beautiful paintings, and antiques"
,,Lovely museum,5.0,,"With 18 SGD quite pricy but well worth. Lovely audio/video guide and rooms filled with little things that make the history come to life.

It comes with a free curry fried-thing or a tartlet - since the curry thing wasnt it for us, Id recommend to walk the 5 extra min to the bakery to get the tartlet."
,,Jewel in Chinatown,4.0,,The building hosting the China town heritage center is one of the most significant houses in Chinatown. A visit worth seeing the exhibits on the living and daily life in Singapore chinatown.
,,Fascinating,5.0,,This museum gave the family a fascinating insight into the life of the Chinese in Singapore. Great displays and real world feel. The kids and adults alike loved it.
,,This place charges overseas visitors and it is worth every $.,5.0,,The heritage centre takes you on a real tour of what living in Singapore’s Chinatown in 1950s would have been like. It also traces the history of the area and why people from China came here.
,,Must see,5.0,,If you are into the Chinese culture then this is a MUST see stop. You should allow at least 1 to 2 hours for this multi floor museum of the Chinese culture in Singapore. Wander through the markets to get here and then on the way out enjoy a great meal in the food street.
,,Interesting place,5.0,,"We visited here after reading about it in a guide book. It wasn't expensive and from the outside looked quite small. However, it was deceiving - it was a lot bigger than we thought. A lot of information packed into the building via an audio headphone set. Well worth the visit."
,,Chinatown Heritage Center,5.0,,I really think this is a must. They have revamped some of the areas in the last few years but the audio guided town tells the story of Singapore by understanding how people lived. It takes a bit too long if you listen to each recording but you can skip a bit here and there and adjust to your desired timing.
,,Good historical overview,5.0,,Interesting museum of Chinese culture in Singapore and Chinese settlements. Provides a good overview with personal stories.
,,One of the best museums i have ever visited,5.0,,"I was completely captivated by this museum showing how shophouses were set up with tiny rooms rented to multiple occupants, and the taped headphone guide was excellent, really bringing stories to life as the occupants told their stories. in some ways, it was sad to confront such poverty and to learn about the hardship early migrants experienced and the museum did not rose tint that - opium addiction, gambling, gangs etc. I learned a great deal and will think about this house for a long time"
,,Wonderful slice of history.,5.0,,"This museum is an amazing history of life of the poorer classes in Singapore, in the time from early colonisation up to around WWll,
The museum is set in a traditional shophouse, which as well as the owner, also housed several families , each family living in one small room. Life like this is practically unimaginable, so go and see the Heritage Centre, and prepare to be amazed and shocked."
,,The Only Heritage Centre worth visiting in Singapore,5.0,,"Having in mind that Singapore is not that old, there are not so many places of history there. I was really disappointed with the museums, but this one is worth visiting. It is next to one of the entrances, and you get a device on which you listen to a more live version of history. I really enjoyed the narratives on each item in the museum. No disability concession here."
,,A Must To See In Chinatown,5.0,,This was the highlight of the Chinatown Hop On/Off Bus tour. This is the main attraction in Chinatown. If you are wearing a sleeveless top you will need to wear one of their cover-ups or bring your own.
,,Fascinating museum with great audio guide,5.0,,One of the best museums I have been in to give you an insight into how people lived. Very detailed audio guide takign you thorugh 3 shop houses over the years. Allow a couple of hours to see everything.
,,A very informative tour of the past,5.0,,A very well planned and organized exhibit. $15 entry and they explain how to use their audio. Push the numbers to hear detailed commentaries of the rooms to view. Very clear audio and interesting comments. You can skip parts if it becomes to lengthy. We did this at the end. Very well maintained.
,,Authentic. Great for children above 7,5.0,,"My mom said the lifestyle pictured here is similar to the stories she heard from her grandmother in Melaka. I brought a four-year-old & one-year-old. They liked the third floor best where they can watch the cartoon, play with the lights in the festival room & take selfies. Then, we walked over to Tong Heng to eat the real egg tarts after the kids saw and wanted to eat the plastic egg tarts on display on the 2nd floor. I would come back here alone or with the kids when they are older. Good for knowing our heritage."
,,Yer,3.0,,Found it a little out dated and run down. Heaps of Chinese shops selling cheap products nearby. Buses stop right near here
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"Went here yesterday in time for the English speaking tour around the Museum...takes about 2 hours. ( Audio guides available if you prefer at any time). Brilliant staff..excellent engaging tour guide with excellent English and a good question/answer rapport. Having visited museums across Asia can say this ranks as one of the best....see how the Chinese really lived with very personal stories taken from people still alive who lived and worked in this very building. A real close encounter of the personal kind. The tour takes you through the history of the building from the tailor shop at the front and the traders who used the five foot area just outside, through the tailor workshop into the living areas and rented rooms in the rest of the building....absolutely outstanding...be aware however of three flights of stairs if you find mobility an issue. Cannot recommend enough."
,,How it Was,4.0,,"This gives you little incite what travel to another country was like
for people who hope in a plane and then a nice hotel and have a lovely meal this looks like hell makes me wonder how bad it was were they came from.
So i would say gohave a look"
,,A place worth visiting,5.0,,"Very informative about the history of the Chinese in Singapore. The artefacts provide an insight into their lives and the stories on the audio guide are worth listening to. Everything is well presented and although it is a bit depressing, it is worth visiting if one is interested in history. The visit puts present life into the perspective of the past."
,,Not My Favorite Place in Chinatown to See,2.0,,"I would not recommend this as a must see when visiting Chinatown. It is OK for historical information of the area with simple displays but I was not impressed.

BOTTOM LINE: You can probably pass on visiting here. Maybe OK for some history buffs. Was hot inside on the day we toured. Sorry, but MY RATING: 4/10."
,,Don't walk past!! Go in!,5.0,,"Its actually easy just to stroll past this place and not really know what it is. What it is is an amazing museum chronicling the history of Singapore form the point of view of Chinese immigrants. I learnt so much! The recreation of rooms and living quarters from days gone by is brilliant. The tour is done with IPOD like devises and headphones, with very easy to navigate information about all exhibits. Allow 2 hours to fully appreciate the place. Its also fully air-conned!!! Highly recommended."
,,Excellent Museum. Not to be Missed,5.0,,This Centre provides a very comprehensive history of the development of Singapore from the viewpoint of the Chinese immigrant. Not to be missed. Most exhibits are interactive. Plan to spend at least 2 hours to view completely.
,,Brilliant explanation of the Chinese in Singapore,5.0,,We learned so much from this visit. The audio tour at your own pace provided a structure and a depth of understanding to the heritage. Give yourselves enough time not to hurry as the intriguing stories are worth listening to.
,,History,5.0,,See and hear the history of Chinese immigration to Singapore looking for work and hope. Hear all the stories as you go room to room with your audio headset and pad to be amazed at how these people survived. Some unlucky ones were sold to slavery and prostitution that continued until 1927 as the British had appointed a Chinese Protectorate to control the numerous gangs who profited from this illegal trade . This is a must see even if you are not Chinese (who make up 75% of Singapore's population)...MDSPOCK
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The place to visit, if interested in Singapore’s history. Located in the middle of Chinatown. Could have spent a day in there. Level 3 is the most interesting part. I skipped some audio infos on the lower floors, because running out of time."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,Perhaps one of the best museum of its type that I have visited. Authentic and feature packed; a little crowded so best visited in just small groups. The headphone audio was really good and probably better than a guided tour (which cost more)
,,GREAT TO VISIT DAY AND THEN AT NIGHT.,5.0,,"We walked this area during the day but st night it gets even better.
The Chinatown Heritage centre is well worth viewing, gives you a great insight into the Chinese Culture.
Plenty of Chinese rests and food, shopping at discount prices and a great way to spend time.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
,,Like being in China,4.0,,Plenty of Chinese restaurants and souvenir shops. Many backstreets to explore with a taste of authentic china everywhere.
,,While in Chinatown,5.0,,Beautiful area and temple in the middle of Chinatown. Lots to see and do in the area. Shopping is typical market style.
,,"Wow, wow, wow - what a place - fascinating, educational, thought provoking and exceptionally well done",5.0,,"WOW!
One of the most interesting and thought provoking museums we have visited in a long time, and we only called in because it was there and the guidebook recommended it – to think we could have missed it as we hadn't planned to stop off here.
The audio guide is perfect and takes you through the three floors of the centre, and a journey through the lives of the Chinese in Singapore. We are not Chinese but found this fascinating and were surprised on leaving that we had been in the museum nearly three hours – mind you we did appreciate the chairs around the place to rest our feet whilst we listened!"
,,Chinatown Heritage Centre - a must to visit whilst in Chinatown Singapore,4.0,,"Spent an afternoon in Singapore's Chinatown during a stopover on the way home from Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand. Very Informative, well set up. Very worthwhile inclusion when visiting Chinatown"
,,Fascinating and excellent window into life in early Chinatown,5.0,,Highly recommended! You get an individual audio guide and go round at your own pace. The Centre covers 3 floors in old houses and initially shows how the inhabitants would have lived and worked. It then goes on to a more general display of life in early Singapore for the Chinese immigrants. Finally it shows the achievements of the modern day descendants. Allow a couple of hours at least for your visit. Not wheelchair accessible.
,,Go and see who built Singapore,5.0,,"Take a trip through Chinatown - preferably with a guide. Visit the old shop houses and imagine how a family of four might have lived happily in one (necessarily) very neat and tidy room, a small cooking stove, and a kitchen/wash area. A cradle hangs from the ceiling. Then discover the history of the Samui women, who laboured and built the initial infrastructure brick by brick, never marrying, in order to devote themselves to the building of their city. Outside the Heritage Centre in Chinatown, there is a stone statue of a Samui labourer, adorned by her red headscarf and concentrating on her labours. Singapore is liberal in its welcoming of all religions and none. Buddhist and Hindu temples reside side by side, as do Christian churches. Not so liberal however is the legal system. Be aware that, although Singapore practices the Common Law of England and Wales, they too have their parallel legislative provisions: Do Not smoke e cigarettes in Singapore - do not even bring them in your luggage. Do Not chew gum on the street, or worse, throw it on the pavement. A quest for interesting restaurants can guide you to Cuppage Street. Here you have a whole canopied street offering restaurants of every ethnic hue coupled with a delightful atmosphere and good authentic cuisine."
,,Exceeded our expectations,5.0,,"Being located in a very touristy area with tourist traps all around, we didn’t expect much. And this was wrong. We spent almost 3 hours at n this museum, enjoying the electronic audio guide and looking at the exhibits. The museum is very well made, meaningfully connecting all areas to make it into a long and highly interesting story about the early days of the Chinese in Singapore. It’s interesting for non-Chinese as well however. Since the audio descriptions are rather long and detailed, I am not sure if young children are patient enough to take the time. For adults, it’s perfect."
,,History brought to life,5.0,,"One of the most interesting museums I’ve visited anywhere in the world. Personal accounts and the realities faced by early immigrants who established Chinatown. Highly recommended. Admission $12 including an excellent, easy-to-use audio guide. Allow a couple of hours. And if you’re older, like us, there are chairs dotted about to listen seated."
,,Blast from the past,5.0,,I love how they put together history to give visitors a taste of what it used to be living in the 50s and 60s. There are also many spots for great photo opportunities and instagrammable shots. There are not many heritage centres that children enjoy going to. This is one of them. My family and I enjoyed the visit tremendously.
,,History comes alive,5.0,,"I am an upper primary student. I found the tour fun and educational. This is my second visit! Everything was very realistic and there were even certain scents at different areas; eg. egg tarts. I enjoyed it very much and so did my aunts who brought me. The gift shop also sells many interesting things, like postcards, books, paintings and more. Definitely the place to go if you want to know more about Singapore and experience life in the past!"
,,Great experience well curated!,4.0,,"Singaporean senior citizens are free to admit. Foreigners is S$15 per head with free head set. All together there are 3 stories. Ground floor illustrates the old occupations in Chinatown like tailors and apparatus. It also show the living condition of early Chinese immigrants in congested condition. 2nd floor showed a dozen more of different occupations from carpenter to Chinese medical doctor. Well researched. The top floor kind of qualify reasons of immigration, and the big picture of issued faced by the residents, from secret society, prostitution to gambling. Rather educational. The only thing is the narration is much longer than the display. As the space is small, it could be congested during peak hour. It is definitely worth the time and money!"
,,Grab a bargain,5.0,,So many glorious little gems can be found in the Heritage Centre. Stroll through and take the time to look in all the shops for special keepsakes and gifts
,,Culturally nice!,5.0,,"The Chinatown Heritage Centers hosts exhibits proper of the chinese culture, a shopping store and small restaurant."
,,A must visit; explore & learn about Singapore,5.0,,"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Chinatown Heritage Centre and highly recommend the centre to visitors to learn about the history and development of Singapore. The exhibits are supported by individual multimedia devices plus street aromas, photographs, videos and much more; visitors will have a wonderful and memorable experience. Lovely, friendly staff too!"
,,Single use plastic heaven,1.0,,The vendors all use so much plastic. Loud and crowded as you would expect. Environmental disaster waiting to happen and really overpriced acom if you are on a budget
,,Easy way to understand the (Chinese) cultural history of Singapore,5.0,,The Chinese from southern China were earliest global travelers and settlers around the world. The Centre did a respectable job in presenting the history and evolution to where Singapore is today. Tip: best to visit this early morning before the nonstop crowd really picks up from lunch time onto night.
,,Very interesting,5.0,,Loved this place it was so interesting. We spend an hour or so wondering round listening to the guide and checking out all the different rooms. Great.
,,Fascinating insight into life in fifties and sixties,5.0,,"We loved this well laid out and informative centre. Be prepared to take quite some time to see it all but it does offer an in depth picture of the life of immigrants to this area.

The audio guide is excellent although some of the exhibits could do with a dust and refreshing.
It is very comprehensive and well worth the entrance fee."
,,time travel,5.0,,fun way to learn more about Chinatown and spend 1-2 hours. The recreated store front and living spaces were very interesting. The details were very well done and they even piped in smells from the city (egg tarts etc). The audio tour with entry is enjoyable.
,,Interesting!,5.0,,Spent just over 90mins in here - audio guide very informative and staff very welcoming. I suggest arriving early (I went at opening 9am) as the centre is quite narrow and small. Appreciative of the free wifi also. Thank you for a lovely morning.
,,History brought to life,5.0,,"As others have mentioned, I stumbled across this while walking through Chinatown. It was fantastic. The audio tour really brings the lives of everyday people to life - the good, the terrifying and the mundane. At first, I thought that the displays were from the turn of the century - early 1900's maybe; but no, many of the displays are from the 1950's. I was shocked at how recent the history was."
,,Historical visit,4.0,,"It is located near China town MRT station on Pagoda Street. Ticket is 15 Singapore dollars for adults. We were explained about early years of Singapore. It is the only place in Singapore offering a rare glimpse into the lives of Chinatown's early residents. Their small living quarters provide an insight into their struggles. There is an exhibition area, a restaurant, and a store selling traditional craft items and souvenirs."
,,A very educational experience but not for everyone,5.0,,"The facade of this museum is very low key and you can easily miss it amid all the other shopfronts. Once inside, you are greeted with a counter and nondescript decor. The magic starts once you start the tour and dial up the audio tour. They have cleverly recreated a Chinese tailor business from the decades ago and also the lives of people who share the shophouse. There is no doubt that living is hard but they form their own tiny community which make the most of very limited resources. The museum is compact but every inch is used to good effect.
The only negative is that the story is very monotonal so if you are interested in that era and local Chinese history then you are in for a treat but a tourist just walking off the street and expecting an ""entertaining"" experience may find the going a bit tough and long-winded. You can skip ahead at any point but the exploration of the museum is a journey by itself."
,,Step Back In Time,5.0,,"With limited time remaining in the city, I was on the fence about visiting this museum, but I am SO GLAD I did. This museum was amazing and a true step back in time to the beginning of Singapore. They are very detailed and thorough in their depiction of what it was like as a Chinse immigrant as Singapore was developing and it didn't shy away from the sometimes harrowing and grim parts of life in that time.

The museum is well organized and is easy to navigate with the audio guide. They also give guided tours at certain times. If you're a few minutes late I believe you can still join the tour.

If you're interested in history and culture, don't miss this."
,,Fascinating tour,5.0,,"The Chinatown Heritage Centre offers a tour of former shop houses. The tour was one of the highlights of my visit to Singapore and proved to be very educational. The cubicles that show how people used to live in such reduced space were well presented, and the audio guide offered informative content. Well worth visiting."
,,Do not miss,5.0,,This small but wonderful heritage centre is dripping in atmosphere and totally unmissable if you want to learn more about Chinatown's contribution to Singapore.
,,It sums it all,5.0,,Enjoyable and very well done museum which summarises the way the Chinese migrants lived upon arriving in Singapore many years ago. The museum is small but sums the history very well. Highly recommended.
,,Don't miss this museum!!,5.0,,"This is a museum where you can experience how the historychinese people lived in Singapore.
With Clinton, who was our excellent and best guide ever, this was one of the best museum I ever visited. Whe could see, feel and smell the the history!
We highly recommend this museum!"
,,Brilliant history of Singapore immigrants,5.0,,"Singapore is an amazing modern city comprised of diverse communities living in relative harmony and mutual respect. One of the glittering cities of the new Asia, it is hard to imagine what it was like for the poor immigrants of the 19th and early 20th centuries - mostly from China, but from other places as well - who struggled to survive and raise families. Somewhat like the Tenement Museum in NYC, a visitor gets a vivid sense of how difficult life truly was for these newcomers. The shophouses of Singapore (many of the remaining ones have have been remade into upscale bars and restaurants) housed businesses on the street level, the family living above, and newcomers crowded into awfully basic quarters above that. It is very well presented, and an important reminder of how much anonymous effort went into creating the foundations of this now world-class metropolis."
,,Wonderful immersive museum,5.0,,"I never planned going to this museum during my visit to Singapore but walked past it as i was strolling through Chinatown, but I am so glad i did.

This museum documents the story of Chinese immigrants a their descendants to Singapore. The entry ticket includes an audio guide which assists with the interpretation.
My favourute part of the museum was level 1 and 2 where they had recreations of how people lived. It really helped illustrate the hardship that much of the early chinese population had to endure to survive.

It was really immersive and interesting. At times though the audio guide was a bit long.

The floor above this one focused on the early chinese settlers and what they had endure coming across from china. It also looked at what customs and culture they brought with them.
The final section looked at what it means to be chinese today.

I thoroughly recommend you check out this museum. Not only is it educational but it's fun! But set aside a minimum of 2hours, there's alot to look at and read."
,,History buff and details to be observed,5.0,,"Love all the stories lined up in this centre. To observe and study the various items existing through time from beyond decades, one wonders how the landscape of Singapore has changed."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,So glad i stopped by. This place was very interesting and definitely worth learning about singapore's history. It took us around 2 hours to complete the full audio tour and to interact with the exhibits which I recommend. Other visitors went through too fast but 2 hours is definitely worth it
,,Excellent museum and well worth a visit,5.0,,This museum is very well organised and very interesting. It is housed in several shophouses and there's a guided commentary which is really informative.
,,Really amazing!!!!,5.0,,"This needs to be visited by everyone !!! A beautiful Centre, How chinese were living in Singapore until 1950. Proper representation of shops, family rooms, day to day live. Comments provided by Audio are also great!!!!"
,,Bit of Culture,5.0,,"Recently visited the Chinatown Heritage Centre in Chinatown Singapore. What a great insight to the history of the Chinese in Singapore, how they lived and worked. The walk through was excellent with a commentary through digital pad. Great to visit"
,,"Clinton our tour guide was superb!, highly recommend",5.0,,"Hidden away rather, we stumbled across this centre and really enjoyed the tour. It’s like a tardis inside! Clinton made it come alive."
,,Chinese Heritage centre Singapo,5.0,,"We decided on a walk through Chinatown and noticed this modern fronted building that looked more like a tourist information centre so we popped in thinking it would be a quick look but 3 hour later we walked out from what was a fascinating historical tour through the Chinese history of migration to Singapore
Well presented and informative you see how they lived and worked
Highly recomended"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"This is a lot like NY’s Tenement Museum. Audio guide is excellent. Videos are a must. There is on the audio guide commentary from an older woman who lived there as a girl. On the wall, there is one showing street market activity from the Sixties. This museum opened in 2002. nY’s opened in 1988.

If you exit from Exit A of the Chinatown MRT station, it will be on your left in about 150 feet. Look for banners out front. Do not miss."
,,History done well,5.0,,"We stumbled across the Chinese Heritage centre while walking through Chinatown and decided to give it a go. Best decision of the day. The ticket was $15 which included the audio guide. The museum is very immersive with short stories making the displays more captivating. The museum seems small but it is quite extensive, one should expect to spend at least 1hr there. If you are in chinatown and have some time, definitely give it a go, you won't regret."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"While walking thru Chinatown, we came across this place by accident. Out of curiosity, we entered and discovered this amazing experience. The exhibits were well done. It bring back some childhood memories to me. Great time spent at the Chinatown heritage centre."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,I've walked past this place the other two times I came to Singapore by myself and never really thought about it but this time I thought I would go in and see what it had to offer. You have the choice of going around yourself with an audio guide or paying a little bit extra for a real guide. I like the flexibility of the audio guide however and the instructions are easy to follow. They have laid out the museum in the style of living back when Chinatown was first developed and how each profession/ethnic group lived. It was a fascinating experience and best of all - in air conditioning!!! Highly recommended.
,,"Impressive, very interesting.",5.0,,"If somebody would like to understand Singapore with all its diversity, he or she must necessarily visit the China Heritage Centre. Unlike in other museums the explanation is more important than the artefacts. You can almost see the poor people who came to Singapore a century ago."
,,History and Heritage,4.0,,"For many young ones, a great place to visit and discover one's Chinese Heritage and history from informative personnel. A good place to glean information about Singapore post-WW2 and the struggles of the locals during the Colonial times. Interactive displays helped bring the information back to life and to us oldies, indeed rolled back the years. Very educational."
,,its an experience!,5.0,,small but cozy with a street market and a lot of small shops with Chinese products. You can get souvenirs and eat some good cheap food.
,,Interesting to know our very own heritage,5.0,,Visited the Chinatown Heritage Centre with our younger generation. I was amazed that so much history was told from just an old 3 storey building. Having a tour guide helps to make the trip more informative and queries answered. Would definitely recommends this place to both tourists and locals as well.
,,Fantastic historical experience,5.0,,"It’s worth a visit. This gives you so much inside in Singapore’s history. The audio tour gives you so much information. How the centre is set up is fantastic. Very modern, interactive"
,,What happens when a local visits this Heritage Centre?,5.0,,"Yes I am a local. Born in Singapore, grew up in Singapore and was a baby in the 60s but did not quite witness the 50s. This was an incredibly educational tour for me and I found out so many of the things which I took for granted and did not bother about the history of even the street names. Most interestingly was the distribution of the dialect groups and how they spread out over this mercantile part of Singapore and planted their own little street enclaves. It just seemed inevitable because we seek familarity and despite being Chinese we were really seperated by our dialect groups like Hokkien, Cantonese, Hainanese and Teochew. Then you will have a small smattering of Shanghainese and maybe other lesser used dialects. There is an interactive large sized digital tablet on the third floor that you can use to do a search on your surname and the origins. You do have to be Chinese to make that search otherwise its meaningless.

The living conditions that were portrayed in the Centre were really harsh and brought tears to my eyes. Its just quite inhumane at times. Yet the human spirit thrived and ultimately overcame. There was a rather macabre scene which is described in one of the exhibits. People who suffered afflications or were simply dying from old age went to a certain street to either die or wait for a coffin. Today that street is called Sago Lane albeit the name betrays the activity that took place there.

There is a also a tailor shop exhibit downstairs which probably reflects the more white collar aspirations of the people who would yearn to wear a suit or even just a proper shirt to ascend up the social notches. But as you move deeper into the non tailoring areas you will find manifestations and reflections about how life was lived and how rental prices also reflected an incredible reality that a dollar went a very long way then.

I would imagine its a lot easier if you took one of the devices which explains in proper sequence and detail about the environs and the way people lived then. The reason I did not take the device was because I thought I knew everything as a local. How wrong I was. Do take the device and not make the same mistake I did. Which also explains why I came back TWICE.

I could go on and on and maybe spoil your own discovery. But for me this was a real worthwhile 2 hours of discovery and intellectual stimulation too. History has ways of predicting how we will ive in the future and some things just don't change. This was for me a very pleasant midway attraction find in my own backyard. At S$15.00 I found a sense of nirvana on the cheap. And to complete the whole experience I brought my 85 year old mom along to validate everything I saw. She was happy too and we had an interaction that really rolled back the years and made me appreciate what she went through in the early years of Singapore's history.

Many thanks to the guides and especially Clinton (at least that was his name) who gave a top class explanation in Cantonese for the sake of my mother who could not find a Cantonese speaking feature on the device."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,Absolutely fantastic!! Would love to return again. Wonderful displays of arefacts and life in chinatown. So authentic and gritty. Wasnt overly crowded as we were first in. The commentary and images you can watch around the centre were also very good. Interactive displays towards the end are very well designed. Could even take our photos at the end and email them to ourselves. Fantastic!!!
,,Humbling and educational,5.0,,Looking at the living conditions of poor Chinese residents in the past was eye-opening. Realizing that these conditions were still true in the 1950's was shocking.
,,Interesting and informative tour!,5.0,,Thoroughly enjoyed learning about the history of the early Chinese immigrants’ stories via the audio-tour. Very well done!
,,Engaging audio tour,4.0,,A great experience viewing different rooms and listening to the audio tour. This is set over 3 floors and easy to find in Chinatown.
,,Fun museum & exhibit,5.0,,"One of the best heritage centers I have been to. It is worth the $15 and comes with an audio guide that takes you through each exhibit.

Plan to spend about 2 hours here and the different exhibits explains how the Chinese came to Singapore and what life was back then. It is a walk back in time and each exhibit is well depicted.

Been here twice now and had two different experiences. Well worth the visit - great for adults and families alike. Good interactivity.

Tip: walk across the road the pastry shop mentioned in one of the exhibits for a snack after your tour! Good coffee & traditional Chinese pastries."
,,Chinese history and culture,4.0,,"The Chinatwon Heritage Centre is a history lesson that tells you the story of how the early Chinese settlers came to Singapore and put their stamp on creating Chinatwon.

It is located on Pagoda Street. The building is beautiful and the facade is spread across three shop fronts. Inside, you can see how the early settlers lived.

Admission is SGD 15 - but I think it is worth the fee. You get a sense of how the early settlers struggled to live and make their fortune in very small living quarters. They had come away from poor conditions in China to make a new life in Singapore.
There is an audio guided tour."
,,Allow plenty of time for your visit !,5.0,,"We'd strongly recommend this as a must-see in Singapore. This museum combines the recreation of the former shophouse, with its multi-family occupants and a real sense of the reality of living in Chinatown in the mid-20th century - really not that long ago - and a museum showing more information about life in Singapore for Chinese migrants over a much longer period. It is well worth allowing at least a couple of hours for the visit. The audio guides and displays were very informative."
,,A wonderful insiight,5.0,,This was a wonderful way to spend an hour getting a feel for the Chinese heritage in Singapore. Certainly worth the $15 admission.
,,Learnt a lot,5.0,,"The tour includes audio guides which, when combined with the static displays, really explained the lives of the Chinese immigrants. Some sections were a little long but is was easy to by pass these. Highly recommended."
,,Really explains snd shows the transformation of Singapore,5.0,,"Really amazing story of Chinese immigration to Singapore and the life they led, pàrticularly from 1958 onwards. Get the guided tour it was amazing. Everyone on our tour thought it was one of best tours they had ever taken. Has amazing pictures of past and present."
,,A poor man's version of the museum,2.0,,4 floors of heritage telling some parts of a Chinatown story. Prices are high but the value of the experience is not as great.
,,Another highlight of our visit,5.0,,Another little gem in Singapore. Very informative and well preserved history of the chinese who came to Singapore in the 19th century and post WW2. Would recommend a visit. The restaurant directly across the road was great as well
,,Sobering and uplifting and enlightening experience,5.0,,"Besides being a cool, air conditioned escape from the heat outside, a visit here immediately brings a profound appreciation for a part of Singapore’s history. Im not a history buff yet stayed well beyond the time I thought I would. The centre is beautifully, thoughtfully and creatively put together to provide a complete experience. The recreation of life in the 1950s is done in such a way that you experience fully the context of the times as well as the personal experience of people living then. The audio guide is simple, engrossing and entertaining. I walked into a real tailors shop and home in the 1950s and found out all about how he ran his business, his values, his family. Of course it is a history that is rooted in deep and at times brutal hardship. The Centre provides a profound appreciation for these and balances that with gratitude and hope for the future. If you look at what Singapore has become from those beginnings it is inspiring. Worth a visit for families and anyone who wants to get beneath the surface of the city. It’s right in the buzz of Chinia town so right outside are great restaurants and loads of interesting and delightful touristy shops."
,,A must see,5.0,,"This Heritage Centre is one of the best I have been to ever! The Centre really gives a comprehensive view of the trials the Chinese went through when coming to Singapore and what life was like in the 50-60s.

The centre looks deceptively small as it is a shopfront in the busy Chinatown, but in reality it is 3 floors: showing a typical shop, living quarters of the shop owner, the next level shows boarders quarters and how people communally lived. The centre had a lot of interactive displays and the audio guide was brilliant. I feel like I spent almost 2hours in the Heritage centre looking at all of the rooms, watching the videos, and reading the placards of information.

Overall, well worth the money spent -S$15."
,,interesting. wel preserved,4.0,,"About 70% of the population of Singapore has a Chinese background. In the museum in the middle of China Town you will find out more about their history, how the came to Singapore and lived in town around the 50’s and 60’s. It is very interesting to learn about this large emigration of the Chinese."
,,Eye opening knowledge on Chinatown,4.0,,"This place is sort of a Museum and kind of historical place to show you the origin of Chinatown. This place shows you how Chinese people migrated from China to Singapore in hope for better lifestyle, their hardships here, their professions, their success stories and how they became the modern Singaporeans. This is must visit place if you are a History buff."
,,Beautifully presented. A sobering look at the lives of some of the early Chinese community,4.0,,It would be good to have some high quality souvenirs and information about the Samsui women who played such an important role in the building of Singapore.
,,Wonderfull insight,5.0,,"My wife & I have visited this museum three times & have always found it fascinating. The very hard life that people endured through very hard times. Wonderfull experience. I would highly recommend this place to anyone.
I also has great street food dining options right outside. Enjoy."
,,Great museum,5.0,,"We really enjoyed this museum. We had the audio guide which was very informative and took us about 2 hours to get around. We also saw the English speaking tour and the guy doing it sounded very entertaining so perhaps this is better than listening to the guide. The exhibits really brought to life what it must have been like to live in Chinatown throughout time, Some of the content is really quite moving and makes you realise how poor conditions must have been for it's residents."
,,Fascinating!,5.0,,"Recently visited Chinatown and the Heritage Centre. I am so pleased we did as this gave us an insight into how the Chinese immigrants lived when they came to Singapore for, hopefully a better life! It was so interesting to see how people lived in the”shop houses” and seemed unbelievable that 8 people lived and worked in such small rooms. A real eye opener Into the lives of these poor souls who struggled to survive.
We thoroughly enjoyed our visit.. it seemed hard to believe what life was like in this clean, modern and vibrant city 100+ years ago.
A must do in my opinion."
,,Very interesting place,4.0,,"So visited in middle of day, not to busy and really good value ,

Get a audio guide and enjoy all the stories of how life used to be in Singapore upto the modern day

Really made you appreciate the area so suggest going here first and then wandering around Chinatown"
,,Great place to experience the old times.,5.0,,"Have been there with my family, located in Chinatown area, walk from MRT for about 8-10 mins.
Start from the 3nd floor(top)by lift, then you will feel like you are like a migrant to a new land. So many to see and to feel, I like the real show room display, can't imagine how a 5 people family can squeeze in such a small room. How our ancestors suffered and survived with a little hope.
After visiting this place, I am more grateful with my life now."
,,Very well done,5.0,,"A very well presented museum, with a very well presented audio guide. It's an important part of Singapore's history, and this museum highlight's it."
,,Very informative,5.0,,"We came 15 years ago, and the place has expanded since. The newer parts give more depth to the stories, and the original buildings give a real feel for how tough life was for the immigrants"
,,Thought provoking,4.0,,"The museum is focussed on the history of Chinatown. There is information on the general history of Chinatown - but the real attraction is the restoration or reconstruction of a Chinatown building as it was in the 1950’s. The building includes a tailor shop, his workshop, his family living quarters, kitchen, toilet, apprentice quarters and accommodation rented to other families and individuals. It is a fascinating and thought provoking look into the llives of the people who actually lived in Chinatown at that time. The exhibits really brings to life their living and working conditions.

Two comments:

By virtue of the actual size of the tailors building space is limited so I guess it could become crowded (maybe the numbers entering are controlled at reception - I don’t know?)

The history is pretty specific to Chinatown so don’t expect to learn too much about the wider Singapore population. (It is the Chinatown museum and there are other places to visit to to get the wider history).

I am delighted that we took time out to visit this museum and I think even someone with less interest in history than me would find this very interesting and worthwhile. One of the highlights of my visit to Singapore."
,,History you need to know,5.0,,The museum was well laid out and detailed. I learned lots and would recommend it to everyone. It is about the first Chinese to come to Singapore and how difficult their lives were in the beginning.
,,Variety of Stalls and stores,4.0,,"Huge variety of low priced goods from clothing, bags, souveniors and Singapore branded chocolate. A large variety of food outlets as well."
,,Informative,5.0,,"This is a fantastic museum, very educational in an interesting way. This place really gives visitors a feel for what life was like early in the history of Singapore."
,,Histories about Chinese immigrants - a must to visit!,5.0,,"With audio (included in the ticket price) explained about the history: the terrible situation and rough condition of Chinese immigrants with simple display about the mini square rooms they used to live, I felt impressed with this heritage center. More than just room display, I got a lot of information about how they lived, survived, and what challenge the immigrants faced during that period. Definitely a must to visit with audio. Don't skip the stories available in the audio!"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,We have previously visited this museum years ago and it was interesting. Thought we would have another look on this visit and am amazed at how fantastic it was. We ran out of time! On entry given an audio/visual hand reader which gives you information on each room you visit we spent 90 minutes there and didn’t get through it. Thoroughly enjoyed.
,,A humbling experience,5.0,,"An incredible journey back in time. The curators were meticulous when they put this museum together. It provides an intimate look at life in Chinatown in the 1950s. The recorded guide takes you through the house and gives you insights into the lives of the actual people who lived in this house. On the top floor, you get a broader picture of life in the city and the history of immigration to the city. Wonderful displays and intelligent yet engaging narration. I was moved by the courage and perseverance of the people who lived here."
,,Bigger than before bit not as much vintage as it used to be,4.0,,"After renovation period, our family came back this place and it was much bigger than it was in 2007. Eventhough there are more sections and places, we all do prefer the historical environment that it had before. What we liked most was the new eggtart section as it smells beautifully."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,A fantastic place full of culture and bargains great atmosphere...and the food it's the best ever ...
,,Great insight into Singapore's heritage,5.0,,"The centre is located at the heart of Chinatown. The exhibit is great and gives a valuable insight into the heritage of Singapore and Chinatown, especially the formative years. The audio tour which comes free is excellent. Worth an hour or two of your time because it gives the place a lot of character."
,,An Unexpected Delight,5.0,,While walking through Chinatown we discovered the Centre. It is an excellent display of Chinese history and life in Singapore from the early days to the present day. The audio/video sets you get as part of the admission fee are really interesting and informative.
,,Excellent,5.0,,I would recommend put aside at least 2 hours for this experience. It really opens your eyes to how people were living and making their way in Singapore. Excellent displays and great audio tour. Can get a little cramped and busy...but that was how the people lived in the past.
,,Very interesting and impressive museum,5.0,,Located in central Chinatown this former home to many many Chinese is now an exhibition about the development and living conditions of people in Singapore in the early days of its development. Try to picture how a family of 8 lived in a tiny cubicle or how 40 people had to use the same toilet. It is beyond imagination. The ticket comes with an excellent audio tour. Expect to spend about one and a half hours to properly do the tour.
,,Awe inspiring,5.0,,Really brought home the pace of development in Singapore over the past 53 years. Recommend the guided tour as our guide was able to add very insightful analysis.
,,Always worth a visit,4.0,,We always visit here to buy gifts for friends and family at reasonable prices. There are lots of places to eat and drink so you won't starve or dehydrate.
,,Bustling,4.0,,"A bustling area full of people, markets, food stalls and restaurants. All the food i tried pretty good and reasonably priced."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Such a good experience: really gave an insight into the past and an understanding of the present. Fantastic display
,,Heritage view of early Singapore,5.0,,"This museum has a sound track to explain the various scenarios that you see. It is over 3 levels , so some stairs to negotiate but they do have a lift if you need it. Very informative about Chinese settlement and early conditions. Very eye opening and plenty to engage older children. Actors recreate the audible history of various venues and living quarters. Take your time."
,,Chinatown Singapore,4.0,,A good place to visit...Plenty of Chinese food stalls and vendors selling Chinese wares and souvenirs... Go in the evening from 5pm onwards...
,,Enlightening Experience,5.0,,Took the guided tour (S$20). Very interesting and informative. Life in 1950s Singapore was so different and it’s amazing how far we’ve come from that. Glad that there’s a museum like this one to remember the life then and educate the more privileged generations of today and tomorrow.
,,Great little museum,5.0,,"Love this heritage centre telling the story of Chinese immigrants arriving in Singapore. From their journey to establishing their (hard) lives in a foreign country. The children (girls aged 10 and 6) were intrigued by the stories as did I. The older one listened to all the explanations on the auto guide while the younger one hunted for the artifacts shown on the auto guide device.
Both of them enjoyed the ‘hands on’ parts of the museum like lifting a heavy bag of commodities usually carried by the coelies."
,,Great Museum,5.0,,Singapore is not just shopping its been a meeting of cultures and history. This is the nest please to see a shop house. Just do it.
,,Take the tour!,5.0,,"Was home with my teenaged children for vacation and we decided to take the tour. Clinton , our guide was fantastic. He added so much colour telling the stories of the occupants and making that place come alive."
,,A glimpse into a different era,5.0,,"Through the re-creation of a shop house in the 1950s one can gain a fascinating insight into the Chinese community in Singapore at that time. The Hertitage Centre does not sanitize difficult issues such as opium addiction, prostitution nor the poor living and working conditions of many Chinese immigrants. An interesting and easy to understand audio guide is included in the $15 admission.
Allow a minimum of 2 hours to work your way through the tailor shop, museum displays and the tiny living cubicles. Whole families lived and sometimes toiled in extremely cramped and crowded spaces.
Be prepared for steep and narrow steps between the 3 floors."
,,One of our Singapore highlights - do the tour,5.0,,This was my second visit and my partner's first. We decided to do the tour - and it was really great. The guide was very entertaining and really passionate about local history. He was open to many questions and patient as he talked us through the exibits and horrendous conditions which early settling Chinese immigrants endured. Really could not recommend this tour enough - thank you again for a wonderful experience!!
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,"A fantastic heritage centre, provided an insight into how the Chinese came to Singapore and the harsh condition they had to endure. A must visit."
,,Good choice,5.0,,"We walked past the entrance and tossed up weather to go in or not....definitely go in, the history is amazing, so interesting and very well done, an audio tour set is provided in the entry cost, allow around 2 hours for this, then have a very nice Chinese meal around the corner"
,,Special Place for those who love History and Museums.,5.0,,"For anyone even with a remote interest in History and learning from Museums, this attraction is well worth a couple of hours of your time.
The place is very small, but the effort, authenticity and planning put into this centre really makes the experience shine.
The level of detail put into re-creating the living conditions of Chinese immigrants in the 50's is wonderful and put's into perspective how lucky many of us are in this 21st century (Imaging 40 inhabitants of a shop house, sharing one shower, with inconsistent water pressure and one toilet, which is just a hole in the ground with a bucket)
For any with Chinese ethnicity, this is a must visit, while the Shop House recreation is from a Singapore perspective, many of the exhibits are relatable to the millions of Chinese who have emigrated from China to the rest of the world in the last 150 years and many of the items are instantly recognisable. It brings home the perspective of how much our forefathers (and mothers) suffered to build a better world for their children and descendents, it can be quite humbling in that respect.
This is a wonderful example of how to build a centre which educates and preseves culture - Well done, Heritage centre.
Note, I expected to take less than an hour on this centre, however, given the audio clips on the guided tour, I was in the centre for close to 2 hours.
Also there are quite a few seats dotted around the exhibits/areas, so you can sit and listen as the Shop House comes alive with the sounds and experience."
,,Dont walk past this gem,4.0,,Its easy to walk past this place with the buzz of china town all around. I only realised it was here at a store owner opposite was trying to drag me into their shop to buy a suit.
,,Fabulous tour,5.0,,"We were lucky enough to get to the centre in time to take a guided tour. Karen, our guide, was very knowledgeable and really made the history of Chinatown and its residents come alive. The centre offers fascinating insights into the way people of various circumstances lived and worked, with rooms furnished as they would have been in the 50s as well as interactive displays with additional information. I would definitely recommend this tour to anyone interested in the history of Chinatown/Singapore."
,,Great tour,5.0,,"I went to the Chinatown Heritage Centre on a whim and ended up having a wonderful time. The Heritage Centre offers an incredible view of what life was like in Chinatown during the 1950s, with plenty of information provided.
I took a guided tour, and it was well worth the extra 5 dollars as our tour-guide, Karen, possessed a great deal of insight and also had plenty of anecdotes which made the tour all the more informative.
It's well worth taking some time out while visiting Singapore's Chinatown to have a look around."
,,Rude staff,1.0,,"The staff behind the counter were too busy talking to each other. When asked what were inside, they merely asked for fifteen dollars. It was felt that it was discriminatory to extract fifteen dollars for visitors but, free for locals. Not exactly a king's ransom but, could not think of any other country following this practice."
,,Discover Singapore's Heritage,5.0,,"When you emerge from the Chinatown MRT Station into bustling Pagoda Street with its shops, food vendors and haggling stall holders, you will find the Chinatown Heritage Centre. Located within three restored shophouses it recreates the hard life of the tenants in their eight feet by eight feet wooden cubicle homes in the 1950s. The landlords would partition their shophouses into these little cubicles with maybe a small table and stool and a bench with matting for the beds (and they sometimes housed eight people including children) in order to ease the housing shortage and make money as well. With the help of the audio guide we gazed in awe at the way these people lived - their lack of comfort with very steep stairs, no privacy, cooling (sometimes no window) or heating and communal bathrooms and kitchens. This incredible exhibition is fabulous, thought provoking and very humbling. Don't miss it."
,,Unexpected gem - my trip highlight!,5.0,,"This museum is an absolute must to understand the history of Singapore! It re-creates the old shop-houses, displaying the living conditions of generations of Chinese workers, and has an excellent walk-through audio commentary in addition to the tours. For me, it was the highlight of our Singapore stay!"
,,Takes you back in time to early Singapore,5.0,,"It was certainly worth the visit. This ‘museum’ takes you back in time of the early Chinatown settlers with the three level shophouse being restored. In it, you will get a sense of what it was like living there back in the 50s. To my surprise the building used to house many families (including a family of 8 in a small cubicle-type or partitioned room. You will also see furnishings and artifacts from the era .... the abacus, charcoal type iron, sewing machines ... the entrance fee is S$15 for adults and S$11 for children. There are guided tours, or you can just wonder on your own. After all, the tickets do come with an audio device with earphones. Took my 10 year old boy there and he enjoyed it. There is also wheelchair access."
,,A highlight in Chinatown...,5.0,,"What a lovely visit! I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Chinatown Heritage Centre and I wasn't even intending on stopping by this place but my cousin convinced me that it was worth it. I am definitely glad that I went! I highly recommend doing the guided tour even though it is $5 more than the audio tour. Our guide, Guan, was excellent and made the tour that much better. He was delightful and engaging and made the experience that much more authentic since he grew up in the area and was very knowledgeable about the history of Chinatown. It was a very meaningful and educational experience that has given me much insight into the life of a chinese immigrant in old Singapore."
,,Best part of Chinatown,5.0,,We had been here several years ago and took our extended family to visit again. This is a great exhibition with plenty to see and absorb. The audio guide is extensive and the admission price is very reasonable.
,,Fanatastic,5.0,,"Well laid out, tells the story of the growth of Singapore through the migrants & citizens of Chinatown; life was hard & not so long ago
The audio guide (inclusive with fee of $20 for visitor) was a little over detailed but informative. Staff were helpful & cheerful"
,,Living and surviving in old Singapore,5.0,,"We had been to this attraction about four years ago, but now its been updated and is really interesting. We spent about two hours looking around , in fact we got so absorbed that we were nearly got locked in.It really shows how the common people worked so hard and the terrible conditions they had to suffer.They deserve the wonderful island that Singapore has become."
,,Clean and Enjoyable,5.0,,"Very clean China Town, busting with shops and eateries. Worth a visit . Easy to get to on the Metro,"
,,Chinatown Heritage Center - excellent!,5.0,,My friend and I took the audio tour of the CHC and it was very informative and interesting - learned a lot about Chinatown of the past. Every part of this museum makes you feel like you are really in that time period and it is very tactile - super interesting! There are even particular smells when you go into parts of the museum that had a great touch. A must-see!
,,insight into culture and history,5.0,,This is an amazing insight into the hardships that were endured not very long ago to create the modern Singapore of today that is an A level global city. Failure to understand the history shown here will compromise your having full respect for the achievements of the people here.
,,"Amazing, informative, enjoyable",5.0,,"Learn much about Chinese in Singapore in this engaging and interactive centre. Experience life as it was, storytelling style. Good for adults and I think kids would like it too. Over 3 floors, give it time, get a headset to really benefit from this great place."
,,Must see,5.0,,"The day to day lives of Chinese immigrants is presented through audio, video, models and artefacts, convincingly taking you through the lives of each of families of immigrants sharing the 3 story building. Each room has a story. Fascinating !"
,,Very informstive/,4.0,,What n expereince. Looking through the years and seeing how much progress has been made. Must hvae been quite a hard life. Thnk you to all the people who have gone beforeto provide such a lovely life provided now.
,,Really interesting,5.0,,"We went in here and had a very friendly welcome. Audio guides given out, lots to see and really in testing to see how people lived in Chinatown in 50s."
,,Unexpected treasure,5.0,,"Sometimes you visit a place not knowing what to expect, and are blown away by how fantastic it is. This is one of those places.
The museum is fascinating and we left understanding so much more about Singapore. It is very well layed out and very realistic.
The staff were wonderfully helpful.
Must go if you are visiting Chinatown."
,,Great place to learn the history of Chinatown,4.0,,"Great place to visit if you want to know more about Chinatown and how it evolved to the state that it is in. Visited on a Sat morning and went on a Mandarin guided tour with Clinton as our guide. This guy is good at his job! He is very engaging and doesn't make the tour feel boring. He added in his own sense of humor to the whole tour, which we appreciated!

He also added in some additional information that might not be available if you're going through the tour yourself. So suggestion: go for the guided tour! You would learn so much more!!"
,,Best place to visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Just loved this place.
Well designed and very informative. I love history but my partner who’s not much into history was also amazed by this place.
Beautiful storytelling and brings characters to life.
Highly recommened for all - locals and visitors.
Entry fee was $13 each for adults via klook."
,,An insight into history,4.0,,Well worth an hour of your time for a look into the past.Gives you an inkling as to how hard life was and how even well educated people had to struggle to survive during the settlement of Singapore.
,,Educational and entertaining,5.0,,"We visited with our teenage kids and my parents. I had heard good things but not sure what to expect. You are greeted on arrival with an ipad and headphones and can move at your own pace through the various rooms, getting an idea of life in Chinatown over the past 100 years. It was entertaining and informative. The kids loved it too."
,,Skip Shopping & Come Here.,5.0,,"I am going to keep this brief otherwise I could go on forever! My visit here was the highlight of my trip to this great city. For anyone who is interested in the beginnings of this financial and retail hub, the Heritage Centre will more than deliver. Even if you think you’re not interested in history, taking this tour will change your mind, I guarantee it!

To quote the Centre’s website, “Visitors will get to step into the humble homes of Chinatown’s early residents, rebuilt with the memories of many who had lived, worked and grown up in these small ‘eight by eight’ cubicles.”

The tour is self-guided. You are given earphones and a tablet a little larger than a smartphone which guides you through the rooms and floors. The commentary is consistently interesting and the re-creations of the rooms absolutely impeccable.

My only advice would be to perhaps get there early as the viewing spaces are narrow and you need a clear view of the rooms to fully appreciate the narrative."
,,A little bit of history,4.0,,There’s an audio guide so you can get a lot of history of the Chinese coming to Singapore. It was a great way to escape the heat of mid day while learning some history
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,This Centre brings to life the hardships of previous generations who lived in Singapore. We found it compelling and extremely moving.
,,Really insightful and engaging,5.0,,Seeing how others live is what gives meaning to travelling. The way these people sacrificed for their families is heart braking. So well done with a practical perspective. Worth going.
,,Chinese Heritage,5.0,,"If you are keen to learn about the early Chinese settlers, then this is a nice place to go visit. You'll get to know a lot about the area and how it developed over the years."
,,Very enlightening visit,4.0,,This visit was very insightful as to life for the Chinese. It has been incredibly well preserved and quite a shock to see the living and working spaces that these people endured. Well worth a visit.
,,Very well organized to preserve Chinatown’s past,5.0,,A very interesting collection in an authentic setting to get an idea of the life in Singapore’s Chinatown in the past. The audio/video guides provided are excellent and the quality of the exhibits and how these are laid out is excellent. Do not miss this if you are visiting Chinatown.
,,Remembering Pioneers with Respect,4.0,,"The houses, rooms, lifestyle, utility products of the early immigrants from China are re-created and preserved with care and respect. The struggle and progress in their lives are reflected in the exhibits."
,,Very Educational Visit!,5.0,,"The Chinatown Heritage Centre is easily accessible from Chinatown MRT station. Admission is $15 for an adult and with this you get your own audio guide. The audio guide takes you from the tailors shop in the 50's all the way through different rooms in the house to demonstrate different professions and ways of life in Chinatown. Further upstairs it takes you through a museum area which explained arrival of Chinese people to Singapore and the way of life and hardships. The audio guide talked about these otherwise there were also boards full of information. It was great to get a glimpse into what life was like and a part of Singapore's history. The centre was well air conditioned, easy to navigate and well worth the $15 entry. I would recommend a minimum of 2 hours to listen to the entire duration of the audio guide and take the time to look around."
,,Singapore in the 50s,5.0,,This is like you have entered a time capsule which send you back to the 50s of Singapore. A very educational tour with audio explanation and nice air-conditioned. Multi culture and different races living differently. Must visit when in Singapore.
,,History comes alive!,4.0,,"It was a very good experience. It brought back memories of how I saw things and places as a child. my friends who were much younger were taken back by how the community lived then. A great place to visit when in Chinatown, and to get out of the sun or rain. :)"
,,Outstanding living museum of Chinatown,5.0,,"The entrance hall is unprepossessing and tucked away in Pagoda Street but don't be put off and think it is a Tourist Office as I did. I hadn't had time read much about Chinatown so found it by chance. The commentary is excellent and brings alive the history of life as Chinatown developed in the 19th and 20th centuries. The rooms depict all aspects of life and are accessible and authentic. There are no holes barred with balanced, accurate information about drugs, prostitution, death street and secret societies. It ends with a room about more recent events. I only had about an hour to spare but plan to revisit next year - it was that good that I want to see and read more of the excellent material."
,,A must visit for museum lovers!,5.0,,"Excellently-put gallery that takes us back to the early days of Chinese immigrants' lives and settlement in Singapore. There's great audio commentary for those choosing to do the tour at their own pace, otherwise a guided tour is also available for an extra fee. Very rich and insightful in cultural and historical contents. Had goosebumps upon learning how super tough life was back then. Would recommend to take at least 2 hours to see/read everything."
,,An outstanding museum,5.0,,"The Chinatown Heritage Centre is definitely worth a visit, especially if you are in the area. The museum traces the path of Singapore's Chinese pioneers. The displays give a good understanding of the lives of Chinatown's early residents through to the modern era. The historical section presents life over three levels in a typical shop-house, each level divided into small cubicles. One cubicle housing a family of eight!
The multimedia guide has an excellent narration and fleshes out the stories of the shop workers and residents of each cubicle.
Adult admission, including the multimedia guide cost $15. It is excellent value. The museum gives a full insight to Singapore's rich Chinese heritage.
The centre is located close to Chinatown MRT station. Take Exit A to Pagoda Street."
,,Step Back in Time,5.0,,"A great place to visit, not just for a tour bus stop but to spend a couple of hours at least.
This is part of the old heart of Singapore and it is beating as well as ever in the past
Take your money because there are some really great buys here and not junk."
,,A fantastic look back in Singapore's history,5.0,,This fantastic centre should be on every visitor to Singapore's must-do list. The excellent audio tour apparatus help give the visitor a closer glimpse with sight and sound to Singapore's history.
,,Eye opening,5.0,,"My husband and I wanted to ""find"" the true meaning of Chinatown and luckily we hear about the Heritage Centre. It is well worth a visit and was a true eye opener, as to the life of the early Chinese. If you wanted, you could have a guided tour and we would highly recommend that, as it was so informative. It was amazing as to how many members of one family would live in just one tiny room! A true historical gem."
,,Excellent museum,5.0,,We visited this museum after a walking tour of Chinatown. It was a terrific way to round out our knowledge of the area and see how the early Chinese lived and learn the reasons they came to Singapore.. The exhibits were of high quality and the audio guide was very well done and engrossing. You'll need around 2 hours to see the whole centre and it is well worth taking the time.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Wish I'd planned more time here, its a very well organised museum and well worth the entry fee. You get a headset included that makes the difference to the experience (otherwise you are just walking though an old house!)

Learnt a heck of a lot about life for the earlier settlers.

If you have small children, then its probably not worth coming (very unlikely they will have the patience to listen or understand what they are being shown)"
,,Glimpse of how early Chinese lived in Singapore,3.0,,"The Chinatown Heritage Centre is located in a lane of Chinatown packed with street vendors selling all kinds of merchandise and souvenirs. Not all of them Chinese but a good many vendors are of Indian origin. There's an Indian temple close by and makes it look a bit more like Little India than Chinatown.
The Heritage Centre is a multiple storey building in the middle of the lane. The front is just like any upscale shop with merchandise but the inside is where it gets interesting. The lasting impression I will carry is of the surprise I felt on going into the first viewing area - the place looked like a dump. It is actually an exact re-creation of how the Chinese lived and worked, during their early days here. The setting is of a tailor shop with the living quarters of the tailor and his family, along with a number of apprentices. There's more, such as the far more sophisticated setting of the house and clinic of a Chinese physician.
The museum brings alive minute details of their daily life, from the clothes they wore to the utensils they used. From their manner of worship to their art. A good place to visit, esp now that the Chinese scenario is entirely different.
The best part is that there is an audio tour built into your ticket and this is highly informative."
,,Well worth it,5.0,,Chinatown is a top tour. There is lots to see and certainly not the classic in your face markets you'd expect in the rest of Asia. Some of the restaurants are real gems.
,,An amazing history,5.0,,This is a must see to understand the history & culture of the Singapore Chinese and their hard working and resilient attitude even today. Need a good 1.5-2.5 hours - Great Value
,,A blast from the past,5.0,,Pretty accurate and authentic representation of Singapore in the early years. it was a pretty nostalgic feeling seeing some of the items on displays. Well worth a visit.
,,"Impressed, even to a Singaporean.",4.0,,Just like taking a tour via time machine back to the pass. I'm impressed each time when I bring my overseas guests to the Centre. May be it brought back my childhood memory...
,,Must see for history buffs.,4.0,,"The display on the ground floor of the Chinatown flat of a tailor, his family and apprentices doesn’t prepare you for what you find on the floors above.
Whole families sharing a room barely 3 metres square, a person sleeping in the corridor; in all about a dozen people including the local doctor shred this second floor space including a primitive kitchen and loo.
This is underworld Singapore as it was abut 5o years ago. More interesting than the Singapore museum and much better value than the Singapore National Art Gallery."
,,Lovely place in different environment,4.0,,The place is good and interesting. We have enjoyed shopping here with bargaining. People are friendly and smiling by nature.
,,Excellent displays and audio tour,5.0,,Located in Chinatown with easy access via MRT. Displays and audio tour excellent. Much to see and learn. Need several hours.
,,Glimpse of Singapore History,5.0,,"I went her not knowing what to expect and it turned out to be very good. It is located in Chinatown in a shop front location and you would almost not know if was a museum. This displays are very well done. I particularly like to tailor shop display and those of the living quarters. You should be prepared for stairs since the displays are located in several floors. If it is busy, things could get a little tight since there is not much room. Some of the displays are a little dark so be prepared fore that., If you are in Chinatown it is worth the time to visit."
,,Interesting afternoon,5.0,,Educational visit on old Chinatown. The commentaries in English were also very informative. Friendly staff too.
,,What a story!,5.0,,"Although it is expensive, it is totally worth the money. The audio tour was Great! It moved at the right pace, factually addressed difficult topics like prostitution and the poor living and working conditions for coolies. The stories and period room displays were very detailed and really made the Chinese immigration come alive.

Take the time to go, learn and enjoy."
,,A must visit attraction in Singapore,4.0,,"A three storied building is furnished with models to replicate various lifestyle features of different times to describe the entry of Chinese people in Singapore in 1800 s, their contemporary lifestyle and socio-economic conditions, their developments and improvisation in standard of living towards the present day living of Chinese in Singapore. The audio visual presentation helps any tourist to understand the whole presentation easily within about 2 hours. Though they have 2 guided tours in a day."
,,Very informative place,5.0,,"Well organized on the sightseeing route with lots of historical information presented. Also, under a hot sun this is a very good activities to spend 1-2 hours"
,,Well worth the money,5.0,,Found the Chinatown Heritage Centre by chance during a walk through Chinatown. The entrance is not imposing and belies what awaits inside. The displays and associated narrative give an excellent insight into the lifestyle endured by the Chinese in Singapore.
,,In Singapore not too long ago,5.0,,"We were in the area and decided to pop by for a visit. It was not crowded on a Saturday morning so we really could take our time looking and listening to the audio guide. I reckon you could spend about 2 - 3 hours here if you listened to the whole audio guide and also browsed the interactive displays.

The exhibits were authentic and quite immersive. One minor complain was maybe they could clean up the displays more, esp the kitchen were quite dusty."
,,A look into the hard life of China immigrants,4.0,,"Chinatown Heritage Centre portrays the living conditions of the many Chinese immigrants to Singapore in the early days.The centre shows the rooms occupied by immigrants of different trades. You have to see the actual size of the room and the number of people staying in the room to appreciate the tough living condition of the people. The parents may stay with 6 children in the tiny room and the room is also storage place for his tools and merchandise that they rely on for a living. One floor of a shop house maybe sub-divided into 6 rooms by the landlord, to be rented out to different families. You can see each room is occupied by tenant of different trades, clearly identified by the tools and goods well displayed in the room. All these families are sharing a common kitchen and a toilet. Its really a good exposure to us to see and understand how tough were the living conditions of the early day immigrants that had contributed tremendously to the advancement and prosperity of Singapore."
,,Definately,5.0,,Take about an hour of your time while in Chinatown and see this. There is a audible guided tour that takes you through what life looked like back in the early days of the area. It's one of the most interesting things we did while in Singapore.
,,A peek into the lives of yesteryears!,5.0,,"We took our young children to this heritage centre for them to experience and understand the hard lives of the early Chinese immigrants.

The audio guide was helpful in providing the background to each exhibit and the kids get to 'experience' first hand how the immigrants lived in the past. I myself am very touched by the exhibit of the living quaters of a family of 8. Cramped, stuffy and bare basics. Rats running around on the ceiling rafters.

An experience definitely recommended!"
,,Another alternative reflection of Singapore,5.0,,"This place reflects the ethnic groups within Singapore, the Chines
have a very strong influence in every aspect of Singapore, a visit to Pagoda Street is an essential part of any visit to Singapore,
for sheer colour & traditional Culture it's a must visit place, it's vibrant & exciting in so many aspects, A place to buy gifts for home & family."
,,Very interesting guide to Chinatown history,4.0,,This is a really interesting place to visit. Try and time your visit to the personal guided tours they conduct every 2 hours or you can take the self guided audio tour. They have done a very good job of recreating the housing environment in which the Chinese families lived in the 19th and early 20th century in Singapore. What makes it really interesting is the explanation for the way the Chinese population & culture evolved in Singapore. A very well conducted tour with lots of interesting trivia and information.
,,Brilliant experience,5.0,,In Singapore visiting friends but visited here on my own - amazing afternoon! Went for the guided tour which only cost a few SGD more than the entrance fee. Our guide Guan was outstanding - clearly has a massive passion for the subject. Was totally absorbed into the experience which in the end took about 2 hours although he kept checking the pace but it was fascinating. Worth the time and money and really helped understanding some of the background.
,,Great intro to Singapore's history,5.0,,I was a bit unsure about this visit but once the visit had started and the audio had commenced I became fascinated by the history of Singapore through its Chinese settlers. This tour takes you from early days when people in Chinatown lived in cubicles to the city in its present day form. Don't miss the selfie at the end of the tour.
,,Excellent museum,5.0,,This museum was recommended to me and it didn’t disappoint. Fascinating place with a great audio commentary. A good two hour visit.
,,Must See!,5.0,,We have a great time inside the museum. Excellent location and easy access to MRT. Staffs are very accommodating. Thanks to our friend for recommending this historic place.
,,Informative,5.0,,"This centre was amazing, it is on 3 floors and lets you know about all the Chinese peoplewho built Singapore, I thought things where bad in the UK last century but these people suffered, that's probably why everyone used Opium. We could have stayed much longer but time was ticking, a really good and informative tourist attraction."
,,A fantastic insight into Singapore’s history,5.0,,"This is one of the best “museums” I’ve ever visited. The modest entry fee is worth every cent. We were greeted by friendly staff who kitted us out with our audio guide. The audio guide, the written information on the displays and the displays themselves were all excellent. The Centre covers a lot of the history of the Chinese immigrants to Singapore in a comprehensive manner. I highly recommend this as a must see."
,,The Chinese Singapore Immigration Story,5.0,,"Located in Chinatown, this museum details the history of the Chinese immigration to Singapore. Both the exhibits and the audio guide are excellent. Having experienced this museum, you will have a very good understanding of the Chinese immigrant experience in Singapore. In many ways it was similar to the experience of many immigrant groups to NYC, but even harsher and more difficult."
,,An interesting and detailed history of Singapore,4.0,,Allow yourself time and don’t be impatient. The narration is long but worth walking and listening through. Approximately an hour and half. We really enjoyed it very much.
,,Fantastic - very well laid out and interesting,5.0,,"I went with my wife and it was a great place to understand the assimilation of at least one part of what makes up the Singapore of today. Great interactive displays which in my view makes it good to get kids in out of the heat and will keep them interested. We were in for a couple of hours and there are plenty of seats were you can sit and listen to the audio guide and pull pulleys and run slideshows.

Interesting maps showing old Singapore when Beach Road was actually next to the beach and Bugis was a street away from the sea.

Worth going with, or without children."
,,Old shophouses,5.0,,"An amazing museum showing how people were crammed in such a small place, living and sleeping in tiny cramped spaces. Using one toilet and shower between sometimes up to 40 people. Seeing is believing in this case. Audio tour costs S$15
Well worth the two hours it takes."
,,Getting to know how Chinese immigrated to Singapore!,4.0,,"Ok ok, this might not be a topic most people are interested in, but it is curious how it happened and is quite detailed if you are using the audio guide, so depending on your attention span you will go quickly through all three levels or slowly (like me) paying attention to the details of the tools and photos on display.

On that last comment... (the one of the attention span), the museum is designed in a way that you should reflect a little bit on the evolution of society and human treatment. If you are not a person that likes to reflect nor likes museums I would recommend you to go somewhere else, not that I think you won't find anything interesting, but you might annoy others trying to enjoy the experience and this can lead to several people staring at you.

Now, going back to the heritage centre. As mentioned in other reviews, the ticket includes the audio guide and I highly recommend you to use it because it gives you information that is not available on the labels describing the scene.

Another important aspect to mention is, you need to be aware of the amount of stuff you have with you. If for some reason you are coming from the street markets and you have lots of bags, or a backpack, you mindful and careful when going to level 2 and 3... when using the stairs really. These stairs are quite steep and you should watch your steps when going up or down, or be prepared to roll down. I don't think this building was though out having people with limited mobility."
,,The lives of the Chinese in Singapore,4.0,,"The three-story museum looks at the lives of Chinese who immigrated to Singapore. Tickets include an audio guide which provides extensive narratives on each room which focuses on a single family or profession. The front room is the tailor shop and the backroom shows the sewing room. The second level
looks at the cramped living quarters of a doctor, clogmaker, carpenter, trishaw rider, and other early residents. The top level traces the journey of the Chinese from China to Singapore. Allow 1.5 to 2 hours if using the audio guide (which comes with the ticket)"
,,Love Chinatown,5.0,,So much to do in Chinatown. The food is always outstanding. Took the wife to Maxwell Hawker to eat and she was amazed at all the hustle and busel going on. Food prices are great and the taste even better.
,,Add to your must see list!,5.0,,"In a nutshell this museum explains the living and working conditions of Chinese Migrants to Singapore until surprisingly recent times.

After purchasing your entrance tickets you are given an Audio-Guide and walk through three floors depicting the working lives and living conditions around the workshop of a high-end tailor. The tour does involve climbing steep narrow stairs, but it is well worth the effort.

Towards the end of the tour you are told about the vices that blighted the lives of the community such as drugs, prostitution and gangs. It made me feel ashamed that this was allowed to continue virtually unchecked during the time of British Rule.

The museum was both interesting and thought-provoking. Full Marks!"
,,Very interesting history,5.0,,"The museum was itself a little bit ""boring"" but it was really fascinating to learn more about the ""Chinese"" history, the suffering, the culture and their spirit."
,,Excellent experience,5.0,,A little break from the chaos of Chinese New Year. Great little museum bringing to life the experiences of typical local dwellers in various periods in the past. Visit it to appreciate the space and facilities you enjoy now compared to the 1950s in Singapore.
,,So interesting,4.0,,"Very dark inside and stairs to climb, but well worth it to learn about the early days there and the conditions the people existed in. Extremely well presented and well directed."
,,One of the best museums ever,5.0,,"This museum takes you into a building as it was used by residents in the 1950s. Visitors can enter most of the rooms and interact with the implements on display. An excellent audio guide takes you into the histories and daily lives of the various types of families and individuals who lived, worked, or both in this type of building. The final rooms also provide some insights into the Chinese community in Singapore at that time. Well worth a slow, concentrated visit -- dashing through would be a pity. Be there when they open to be able to give each room the attention it deserves without battling other visitors."
,,A Highlight of our Trip,5.0,,We were lucky enough to be able to sign up for the guided tour of the Heritage Center. It was a fantastic view into the history of the City. I would highly recommend this stop and the tour (which was only about $5 more than regular admission).
,,Always love seeing the crowd,4.0,,"Several times visited Chinatown and I love the atmosphere and the smell of crowd here.
The crowded street in front of the old and preserved building always make me feel warm.
Love seeing the stalls, love seeing the sellers yelling and seeing the exciting visitors.
Walk from Pagoda Street to Food street and Temple Street, try some local snacks and buy some souvenirs.
Always fascinating!!"
,,Busy Place .. Heritage & Culture,4.0,,This Place is really busy but the best part is that it really holds a significant place in history with great culture & heritage of Singapore.. Must visit
,,Fascinating museum,5.0,,We weren't sure quite what to expect given the title. This centre is a very interesting and extremely informative museum set out as a reconstruction of two shops/ houses in Old Chinatown. Well worth a visit. The self-guided audio guide is essential to get the full benefit of the visit.
,,China town must do,5.0,,"Top of the list for me here, the front is very deceptive but take the audio tour and step back in time. Excellent setout and tour, made me view this time in history with very different eyes."
,,Wholesomely historic,4.0,,"Not for those with tiny tots but culture vulture as there is lots of reading and history in the exhibit !

you get to see how indentured labour (coolies) live in the 19 C when masses of
starving chinese came in search of work to feed their families in southern at a time of war and famine.

Whilst there was a gold mine in Raub and tin mines in malaysia, the masses whom came to Singapore came for work and business.

Fast forward over a span of 100+ years descendants hardworking laborers/entrepreners have built a fine global
city with law and order

above aside you get to learn about aspects of singapore esp festivities and even about the opium smokers and funeral parlours

As this is not build to entertain but rather educate/inform and if you are a foreigner without a child minder maid in low, leave your under 12 kids with their teenage siblings in any ice cream parlour nearby and give them $20 each to spend whilst you take a glimpse of Singapore s history !

Don’t miss this if you are a history buff"
,,overcrowed and only very law quality but high prices,2.0,,I went to China Town because I heard so much about. I regret that I lost time there. Its all rubbish you can buy there and all the little restaurants provide more or less poor meals.
,,Interesting and informative.,4.0,,"Mascara warning, if you've any sensitivity then seeing how hard life was not too long ago for some people should tug at your heart strings.

It is very informative and interesting with the help of the audio guide, not something that i would ordinarily partake in. The reproduction seems to be very good.

Tells the reality of life for all groups of immigrants from China.

Stand in the doorway of the room of the family of 2 adults and 6 kids and think about it..."
,,Bargain place to shop,4.0,,This was a great place for Chinese bargain shopping. We bought budget beach wear and souvenirs from here.
,,Great insight into the lives and hardship of people in Chinatown in the past.,5.0,,This is a fabulous place to visit. It contains very well-presented and documented details of what life was like for people living very poor lives in very cramped accommodation and working very hard just to survive. It also shows the sad reality of man's inhumanity to man with the exploitation of immigrants driven to hard labour or prostitution having been sold in human trafficking. Reinforces how fortunate many of us are today. We highly recommend visiting and it is easy to get to as it is close to the Chinatown MRT station.
,,excellent Saturday afternoon costumed guide tour,5.0,,Touring the shop houses with a costumed guide was a highlight of my Singapore visit. I learned a great deal on the tour v.s. walking around with an audio guide. I appreciate the kindness I received from the various staff people I dealt with. Thank you for your hospitality and sharing of information and making my visit extra special.
,,Interesting museum for learning old day,5.0,,"It was nice to visit this museum, good interactive all over building make me felt like I was back to those period.
This museum makes us know about past of Singapore when everything was suffer and must be patient.

Thank you. I and my partner like it a lot."
,,One of the best museums I’ve been to in a long time - if you do one thing in Singapore this should be it!,5.0,,I was very impressed with this museum in the heart of Chinatown. I love social history and it shows how the new immigrants to Singapore from China lived with the sympathetic restoration of an old shophouse. The audio guide was very informative without being too lengthy. Well worth a visit and very reasonably priced. If you are sick of the modern and want a piece of the past then this place is for you!
,,Rediscovering my local roots in a sensitively curated museum for the man in the street!,5.0,,"My husband and I found the Chinatown Heritage Centre quite by accident. We were walking down Pagoda Street on Saturday evening, enjoying the cool air, wondering what new changes had taken place in Chinatown since we last walked this street two years ago when we brought our Canadian visitors there.

Lo and behold, in the midst of the Chinese cafes, restaurants and tourist shops, we chanced upon the Chinatown Heritage Centre. We decided to pop in and see if this is worth recommending to our overseas visitors when they visit us. We had absolutely no regrets, whatsoever.

For $15 per pax, we got a multimedia guide and a wonderful reminder of the history of the Chinese in Singapore. We spent 2-3 very entertaining, very enjoyable hours in the centre, learning new things as well as recalling our childhood and teenage years growing up in colonial Singapore on the cusp of independence and in the early postcolonial period.

The displays were presented with stories of the real families and individuals who lived in that shophouse. With the multimedia guide, the displays invite the visitor to relive the lives of those families, their daily challenges, their happy moments, their problems, the support they received from the community of tenants living on the same floors in the same building. Very balanced presentations that reach out to those looking for a deeper analysis as well as those who simply want to know a little more about life for the common folks in Chinatown in colonial and early postcolonial Singapore.

The museum shop stocks some really good souvenirs, too. And, btw, this is an independent centre, endorsed by the Singapore Tourism Board. Go and see it for yourself. You won't regret it!"
,,Cheap Souveniers,3.0,,China town folks are a mixed breed. Some pleasant and some are out ride rude. Wonder why. Go there if you want to buy decently priced souvenirs and knick knacks. Some good options in food also
,,Very well presented insight into typical life of the Chinese community,5.0,,This is a great place to while away a few hours very well located in the heart of Chinatown. It is well presented and strikes a great balance between information and interaction. In a very balanced way it sheds light on the history of this important community group
,,Important museum,5.0,,High quality museum of the history of Chinatown. Do not miss it! Good audio guides and exhibitions that uses many senses.
,,More than well worth a visit.,5.0,,I am very interested in social history and the Chinatown Heritage Centre was an education. Reconstructions of the living areas were fascinating and really brought the struggles and successes of the Chinese Immigrants into reality. The audio guide makes the experience even more poignant. No shortage of excellent eateries nearby.
,,Great experience!,5.0,,"Great historic museum. Do not miss to buy some Kopi after. Kopi Si Kosong is recommended. Kids, 4 and 6, had fun!"
,,A good experience of Singapore in the past,5.0,,"Very authentic displays, and exhibits of life in a Singapore shophouse with audio. Something to definately experience while in Chinatown."
,,interesting,4.0,,"Set in an old shop house, the museum takes you through the history of the first chinese settlers, how they lived crammed in such close quarters. how they worked and survived the beginnings of a new life in singapore."
,,Interesting visit,4.0,,The centre is a bit of a hidden gem. It traces the history of the Chinese population and there influence on Singapore as a whole. The tour is over three levels each connected by narrow stair case. There is a lift by is off to one side of the building. Your are given an audio device and can take as long as you like on each of the exhibitions. You looking cubicles which show different sections of the Chinese people and workers. You come away with a feeling of how much blood sweat and tears went into making Singapore what it is today. To do the whole tour taking your time would be at least 3 hours. Well worth a visit
,,Don’t walk pass without stepping IN,5.0,,"Not many people know about it but Singapore does have an interesting past. Most people think Singapore as a hub for food and shopping, a financial or medical centre but if you look a little deeper you can see that blood sweat and tears have gone into building this nation.

The heritage centre is the perfect place to start as it gives you a good understanding of how the country came to be. How in the short span of 50 years it has gone me from mud roads to sky scrapers. The centre gives interesting stories of people who first started building Singapore and their lives.

Forget the tourist souvenir shops instead take home a part of history. Don’t forget to read all the history plagues around Chinatown too! Enjoy."
,,Great way to learn about the Chinese community,5.0,,"Spotted this little gem when we were wandering around Chinatown on our first night in Singapore, researched it when we returned to our hotel and decided to pay a visit.
Well worth visiting. Very interesting to learn how the Chinese first arrived in Singapore, how they lived and worked in very cramped conditions.
Great to see inside one of the Shophouses.
You receive an audio guide so you can spend as much or as little time as you like in each of the rooms.
The museum is on three floors accessed by narrow staircases, can't recall seeing a lift."
,,A highlight of our trip,5.0,,"This is not to be missed -- an outstanding, interactive museum that really brings the Chinatown experience to life."
,,Worth a Visit!!,5.0,,"We were unsure whether to visit the museum in the lovely restored shop houses, but were very glad we did.
A friendly lady greeted us and gave us lots of information without adding pressure to go in. It's $15sgd per adult and you walk at your own pace listening to the audio equipment given.
Viewing the tiny rooms of the partitioned shop houses which housed as many people/families as possible in the 1950's is a real eye opener.
There is also information on the difficult life migrants faced in the 19th & 20th century as they fled to Singapore to earn a living. Well worth a visit!!"
,,More Memories than a lifetime can Capture in One Viewing!,5.0,,A famous collection of history and memorabilia to transport the viewer to an earlier time and place. Relive the scenes of childhood memories and events that changed the landscape forever. This trip into the past is fascinating and emotional. Come ready to remember and relive.
,,An insight to life in Singapore as recently as the 1950s,5.0,,"Most of what you see in Singapore reminds you of the wealth of the city and its citizens. But there are other people who were an essential part of life in Singapore and never achieved wealth. At the Heritage Center, you can see the rooms in which these people lived. Don't miss it"
,,Tours and museum,3.0,,Kind of a tourist office and mini museum combined. Interesting for westerners into singapore history and culture
,,Old times in Chinatown,5.0,,This is a great way to see how Chinatown developed and how people used to live. It must have been very hard times for the immigrant Chinese back then!
,,Really cool way to see Chinatown History,5.0,,"This is inexpensive and relatively quick. They give you an audio guide and you can go your own pace. Well thought out exhibits. One piece of advice would be to walk around Chinatown a bit, then come back here for an air conditioning break."
,,If you want a taste of how it really was,4.0,,The Chinatown Heritage Centre gives you a taste of the past and does it in a really nice way. Also not very expensive.
,,Visit to heritage centre,4.0,,Very enjoyable tour. Well worth paying the extra entrance fee for a guided tour. The tour guide Clinton was excellent and brought the place to life with his description and stories throughout the tour
,,serious pending available!,5.0,,OMG - the eyes and wallet nearly had a seizure at the amount of merchandise available. Sizing for clothing can be problematic but the souvenirs were exceptional quality and money. Really enjoyed visiting the place. We did meet with some harassment from vendors who send out 'poachers' to get you to come to their stall and sometimes a polite 'NO' was met with resistance and bad grace.
,,Very interesting and well made museum,5.0,,A very well made and interesting museum. It takes about 1 hour to go though. Also my child (6 y) was interested.
,,Really good insight into early life in Chinatown,4.0,,Wonderful exhibition with insight into early days in Singapore. The audio guide was really good and easy to follow each section.
,,Hard times,5.0,,"Offering a rare glimpse onto the lives, homes and struggles of Chinatown's early residents, this Heritage Centre, half-way down Pagoda St., is a fascinating place, and a must-do for visitors. Most of the early Chinese residents, escaping from wars and famine in their native land, paid for passage to this malaria-infested island, to seek a better life, often pushed overboard in the only clothes they wore as there were few landing places. Those that made it gravitated to Kreta Ayer, water-cart in Malay, south of the Singapore river, where they settled into what has become known as Chinatown.Singapore has benefitted greatly from this early influx of hard-working, energetic and enterprising people who have transformed the former British colony into the successful, model nation state it has now become, the envy of the World."
,,"Excellent Museum, Intriguing Tour",5.0,,"The Chinatown Heritage Center is a must-see and I’d highly recommend the guided tour. Our guide Clinton provided an intriguing look at the grim lives of early Chinese immigrants in Singapore, taking us through several levels of the museum. The stories about tailor apprentices, night soil collectors, the families who lived in tiny rooms upstairs, and early hospices really made the place come to life. Put this place on your itinerary."
,,Fascinating!,5.0,,We found this museum gave us a fascinating insight into the difficult lives that most Chinese migrants faced in Singapore in the 1950s and earlier. Everything is very well presented in what is only a very small space.
,,Excellent Museum,5.0,,"This museum is set in an old shophouse. After paying the entrance fee you're given an audio/video guide which is very well presented. The first part is the tailors shop & living quarters & upstairs is divided in many rooms. These measure 8' x 8' & one housed a family of eight in the 1950's. The history of the place was done extremely well. I didn't realise how badly the immigrants, especially the Chinese, were treated right up to the 1960's. This was a very interesting 2 hour visit. At the end there's a small shop which was selling among other things some beautiful pop-up birthday cards."
,,visit spoilt by unruly schoolchildren,3.0,,"When we arrived at 9.30am we were informed that a school party had just entered and as they're a bit noisy we may prefer to come back in an hour. We returned and after being told that there were no schoolchildren we paid our admission. The exhibition itself is excellent, a true representation of how the shop houses were occupied by numerous families and tradesmen. The audio tour is very informative. After just 15 minutes a noisy party of children, teachers and parents arrived. The museum is so small that very quickly we were overwhelmed. We couldn't hear our audios for all the screeching and parents shouting. It was awful. There was no respect whatsoever for independent tourists. One of our party had to leave the building as the disruption was just too much for her. We spoke with the duty guides, they apologised and offered us free entry on another date,unfortunately we were flying home later that evening. I really think that visits should be separated for the enjoyment of all concerned, both the children and tourists. It's a gem of a place and we would have liked to have had more time to absorb everything."
,,Absolutely a must to visit while in Singapore,5.0,,"Nothing to shop for, nothing to eat but it’s where straits Chinese heritage is preserved, experienced and explained. I enjoyed it very much as it brought me back to when the Chinese first came to Singapore and it’s influences to modern day Singapore.

Apart from the displays, the center has the cleanest toilets around Chinatown. Wish that all public toilets are like those in the heritage center."
,,amazing history of old Chinese cultures.,5.0,,"step into the past as how Chinese live & work in this amazing Chinatown Heritage Centre. located just outside Chinatown MRT station & only SGD 15 entrance fees, you will be amazed & mesmerized on how they live & work under such tiny conditions. some of the old relics, photos, tools, equipments & memorabilia are found here & some never to be seen again in today’s generation. this tour comes with an audio tour guide as you will be guided along the tour."
,,A Walk Through Chinese Culture and Spirituality !,5.0,,Singapore has a strong Chinese influence with a history that dates back to olden times. The Heritage Centre showcases the journey and evolution of the chinese presence in Singapore.
,,Historical extravaganza,4.0,,"Chinatown is known for souvenirs, shopping and good food. But going inside this museum gave our group a deeper perspective of how those buildings looked and were used before. This has been a delight for my students because they were able to see how life meant for Singaporeans before they became a rich and powerful nation."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Worth a visit to see the old ways of Singapore. You will enjoy this if you are into looking at historical features
,,Fantastic - really worth doing,5.0,,"Really well set up museum to spend 60-90 mins in - audio tour and simple way of telling the story is good. Good value as well. Combine with a trip to the hawker market,"
,,A must see in Singapore - well worth a visit,5.0,,"The China Heritage Centre does not seem very big from the outside, but it is very well and rather big inside. Really worth a visit: we learned a lot about the life of ordinary (Chinese) Singaporeans in earlier years. Plenty of interesting history and tales. You should plan 1-2 hours. We took the tour which was good and very informative. Otherwise you have also audio-tours which surely are helpful and tell you stories."
,,A great introduction to the Chinatown of old!,5.0,,"If you are interested in history and how people in Chinatown lived in the 1950s, don't miss this heritage centre. It is all very well presented (including sensory experiences). We took the tour which we enjoyed also the tour guide's own family stories of those times."
,,Don't miss this experience. It is amazing,5.0,,The Heritage Centre in China Town recreates a typical shophouse and really helps you to understand what life was like for Chinese immigrants to Singapore. It tells the history in a very accessible way . It was fascinating. The staff are welcoming and really want you to enjoy the experience. Can't recommend it highly enough
,,Excellent audio guide and helpful staff,5.0,,"In around an hour or so you gain a great insight into life in Chinatown 60 years ago and the problems faced by Chinese immigrants over the years.
The set up is very similar to the Tenement Museum in New York.
The audio guide was excellent but for an extra $3 you can have a guided tour 4 or 5 times a day."
,,Absolutely worth a visit,5.0,,This is a wonderful place to visit. The way in which the information is presented is totally absorbing and the Audi descriptions on the headsets are entertaining and informative at the same time. It is well worth the money; I certainly came out much better informed. I can see that it would be a less enjoyable visit if it was crowded but our visit was very quiet (weekday lunchtime).
,,Interesting Chinese history,5.0,,"We were recommended to visit by other travelers and we are pleased we did. A very informative museum with so much information. The headphone sets were great with the screen display also. The rooms were all very interesting to see and I came away with an understanding of what life was like for the Chinese in Singapore when they first arrived. It was all very informative, well laid out and interesting. I would definitely recommend visiting."
,,A real gem,5.0,,"You cannot loose this museum. Just in the heart of Chinatown. It is well set up, an audio guide tour tells you everything about Chinese immigration."
,,Enjoyed learning culture,5.0,,"We stumbled on this at China Town. It was nice to be in air con, Not stroller friendly, Get the headphones, to learn about each room. Only thing I found I wasnt a fan of, was the talk went too long and I got a bit bored byt the end. It will take over an hour to fully experience this."
,,A must visit in Chinatown,5.0,,"This museum was not on my itinerary but I definitely do not regret visiting this museum. The museum is very informative and you can easily spend a good 2-3hrs in here, an excellent place to get out of the heat as well!

You are provided with an audio guide to explore the first two levels of the museum, which provides you with an insight on what life was like for a Chinese immigrant living in Singapore. It explores the different occupations that were most common such as a tailor, rickshaw puller, and a maid.

The third level allows you to read about the history of Chinatown, such as the arrival of Chinese migrants to Singapore, opium addiction, education and type of entertainment available."
,,Interesting Historical Value,5.0,,Well presented & curated. A lot of time taken to make sure the displays are relevant and of interest to the masses
,,Must visit,5.0,,"If yo uare a history enthusiast, you must visit the Chinatown Heritage Center. It gives a glimpse into the lives of people of Chinese origin. It is a fascinating look into the past."
,,A Little Gem That Could Be Missed,4.0,,"Opposite The Chinatown Seafood Restuarant, which is also very good, is this hidden gem of history. Located in an original Chinese immigrants house, which was a tailors, it shows how life was for Chinese immigrants up to fairly recent times. An amazing eye opener, well worth a visit and if you are a senior citizen, free. What more could you want!"
,,Very informative and engaging,5.0,,A visit to the Chinatown heritage museum is a must. It is well set up to give you a true insight into the Chinese history and influence in Singapore. The audio tour is very informative and the whole building takes you back in time to understand how life was for the Chinese. Well worth the visit.
,,Amazing Food,5.0,,"Besides China and Hong Kong, you cannot find a better place to eat the best Chinese favourites and street food"
,,Great Museum,5.0,,"A must if you visit Singapore and Chinatown. Very well set up exhibition, very friendly staff and right in the Chinatown. You learn a lot here."
,,A 'must do ' if visiting Singapore for new and returning visitors.Entertaining. Informative. Wonderful experience.,5.0,,"We have known Singapore from our time spent there in the 1960's. The visit to the Heritage Centre was a revelation. We had a guided tour with Clinton. He was an excellent guide. Informative as well as entertaining, he made the visit truly memorable.
The Centre is located in a genuine shopkeepers house (A tailors shop in this case) and is laid out as it would have been in 1958. Consisting of 3 floors and in addition to the shopkeepers rooms includes a series of rented cubicles housing dozens of tenants. The building illustrates a way of life going back to the early days of Singapore that continued until relatively recent times. The contrast to modern Singapore is striking. A visit to Chinatown must include visiting this 'Gem'."
,,Puts the melting pot of Singpore into perspective. Lots of historical information and worth the visit!,5.0,,"I have known a fair bit about Singapore, but this place adds value and meaning to the history and explains in an interactive way, the evolution, culture and people. Loved it."
,,A must see when in Singapore,4.0,,"A fantastic invite into bygone Singapore and the Chinese influence of this magnificent city, it was a tough life for these Chinese immigrants and the Heratage Centre demonstrates this without being too confronting, it has been very well restored with very authentic items and layouts. The second floor is were you will get the most information of how these people lived, when visiting you can also have a audio tour, it made the tour very interactive for us and was fun to boot. The Centre is centrally place in famous Pagoda Street so you will also have a great experience either before or after you visit, great food and atmosphere to cap off a great tour, the statue of the Red Cap out the front is also worth getting a photo with. So if you are looking for a bit of a cultural fix as well an easy self guided or audio tour then this is your place. Seniors Get a good discount later in the day and the general entry price is reasonable at $15 for adults which includes the Audio kit. It's a good 1-2 hrs tour. Enjoy"
,,A cultural pearl inside Chinatown,5.0,,"Created in a Taylor shop house this museum is able to give a good feeling of the real life of Chinese immigrates at the beginning of Singapore history.
Three floors, of which the most impressive for me is the second one.
Starting from the Taylor shop at the ground until the 3rd floor, where the Historic context is clarified,.
The digital guide is well done for helping the visitor immersing into the daily life of the 40 people living there, with tales and sounds.
Do not skip it if you are interested on the cultural aspect of the city."
,,Worth a stop off,4.0,,"Good museum - you get an audio guide which is helpful, but a little bit annoying sometimes.
Gives you a good insight into what life was like and seems very authentic.
We paid full price, but afterwards saw discounts available - so it would have been better value for money at the lower price."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"I really enjoyed learning more about the cultural heritage of Singapore (or at least part of it). The setup is quite good. The audio tour is a bit long - I lost focus about halfway through. The good thing is it's included in the ticket price, so you can use it as much or little as you'd like without feeling too guilty. Staff are very friendly."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"Housed in a restored shop house, which adds to the overall experience. Cool, informative and educational museum to see and hear stories of what life was like back in the day for a hawker, doctor, tailor or worker. They also have cultural workshops ideal for kids to learn about traditions and festivals."
,,Very informative and well designed,5.0,,"As a young Chinese traveler, I have to say 90% of the furnitures/decorations are so new to me. It is a great exhibition to have a close and careful understanding of the life of the first generation of Chinese immigrants and also the life in Guangdong Province in the 1950s-1970s. It would be nice if you can have Chinese locals who were born before 1970s to go with you as the heritage centre is seriously their old houses, or I highly recommend you to get an audio guide.
It's not a museum. It's just a miniature of Chinese immigrants' houses, but it gave me a great shock of imagining how tough my great grandfather who immigrated to Malaysia in around 1950s lived until he passed away there in 1970."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Happened to spot this place on our map, decided to give it a chance. Didn't know what to expect at first but were pleasantly surprised at the level of details given by the audio headset tour. An interesting look into the history of the area and the lives of those who lived there. Perhaps worth saying that we are both keen museum goers. I can imagine that those not overly keen on them in the first place, may be disappointed in the lack of various themes. However if you want to learn about the area at all, worth popping in and taking the tour"
,,Very informative worth the visit.,4.0,,The museum is a great place to learn about early Chinese Singaporeans and we enjoyed our visit using the headset to listen to the very detailed stories. The rooms on display are well done and gave us insight into the lifestyle of days gone by. Great air conditioning too! I'd suggest a short option in interactive headset as we had a young child with us and it was hard to listen to all the detail. Excellent set up and good access for all.
,,China Town Night Walking Tour,5.0,,"Our guide from Buffalo tours was amazing, a wealth of local knowledge including the work ethics of Singapore's people and took us on a magical food trail, that encompassed the four temples in the area and the food court behind the courtyard where the elderly men play chequers. we had a lovely night and my fears of not being able to manage the tour due to knee replacements and spinal surgery were unwarranted, we were all taken into consideration, we had a fairly small group and I had plenty of opportunities to sit if I need to. I will go again. it was over too quick so much fun!"
,,Complete description of how life once was,4.0,,Visual and descriptive exhibits showing life in Singapore's Chinese neighborhood. It is amazing that so many people and families could live in one building. Worth a visit.
,,Great Finds for Knickknacks,5.0,,we stayed at Backpackers Inn Hostel at the midst of Chinatown and this was just a block away. a great place to learn more of the rich history of Chinatown. a must so you would understand the place better.
,,A highly recommended museum,5.0,,"This small museum situated in the heart of Chinatown is a restored shophouse, giving excellent insight into the lives of the Straits Chinese in the early 20th century. Starting in the workshop of a tailor, the audioguide reconstructed the lives and hardship of the numerous people living and working in such a building. A fascinating couple of hours!"
,,Don't skip this,5.0,,I've been 3 times. The cultural experience is always moving. Hard to accept how people lived such a short time ago.
,,Really nice museum,5.0,,"Fascinating displays, good explanations, incredible show on how people used to live (or better said survive), not to be missed. Pity that reductions only apply to local seniors !"
,,Witnesses of Singapore history with Clinton,5.0,,"First of all I would like to advise doing the guided tour, not the one with audio guide.
Uncle Clinton took us to witness the not so long ago Chinese community lives. The museum itself is reproducing with many details an actual family's shophouse and all the stories around people who lived and worked there, ending with some facts about why and how Chinese community settled in here. Amazing journey!"
,,get to know the way of living in old Chinatwon,5.0,,"It is a very informative, excellent way of seeing and learning how people used to work and live in the old days. The exhibition is fun and the latest technology is used. The stories of the different families together with the exhibits are so lively that you feel yourself becoming part of them.
The S$ 15 entrance fee was well worth it!"
,,Must visit,5.0,,Was very pleasantly surprised by how well this museum is set up. It not only depicts how the Chinese lived in shophouses in the 1950s but also sheds light on how they made a living and what life was like then. I would rate this as a must see museum if you want to have an idea of what life back then was like. The recreated settings are very accurate. The overall experience enriching. Many who stop by the front of the Centre may not feel compelled to visit the museum as it looks more like a souvenir shop. Don't let that throw you off. An eye-opening visit awaits you inside. It takes approximately an hour. It's a few storeys and covers 3 shophouses.
,,A must-see museum to understand Singapore's Chinatown history better...,5.0,,"An interactive museum about the Chinese immigrants experience in Singapore. It's a three story walking exhibit through a little cramped spaces. But definitely worth it. The ticket price of SG$15.00 includes an audiovisual guide explaining you of facts about the lives, customs, festivals, entertainment, and much much more, and helping you to experience the museum in a more vivid, funny and casual educational way.

Another of my favorites to must-see while visiting Singapore.

See all my pictures to get a best preview of the this amazing heritage museum..."
,,"RESENTLY REVAMPED, WORTH THE VISIT",4.0,,"Good set up after a revamp earlier this year, good place for small groups of tourists, nice displays, good history explanations, worth the visit and well presented."
,,worth a visit,4.0,,Fascinating insight of how Singapore used to live not so long ago. Well worth a visit if only to imagine what it was like through Chinese eyes.
,,Excellent museum,4.0,,We decided to visit this museum as entry was included in the 3 day transport pass we had bought. So glad we did! Using our travel pass for entry caused us to be heavily scrutinised but once we passed that test we were in. The ground and first floor have been curated to show the lives of the people who lived there early 20th century and as you walk to the upper floor the story of the Chinese in Singapore is told. immersive and fascinating this museum is time well spent.
,,WONDERFUL SINGAPORE,5.0,,"Everywhere you go there is something interesting. The historic places, the gardens, the buildings etc etc. It is such an ever-changing and growing city and soooooo easy to get around."
,,Brilliant recreation,5.0,,"Don't miss this Heritage Centre. Fascinating recreation of a 1950s shophouse, and a real eye opener."
,,Great museum for young and old,5.0,,I visited CHC with my parents it was like a walk down memory lane for them. This museum is nicely put together for the visitors to see and experience the life of early Chinese immigrants to Singapore. I highly recommend a visit to this museum for the young and old!
,,Interesting overview of Chinese immigration,4.0,,Multimedia exhibition of Chinese immigration was a long time (years?) in restoration before being again opened to the public. Three floors reproduce the living and working conditions of Chinatown in the middle of the XX century. I found it quite interesting and spent about 2 hours in the museum.
,,Moving and disturbing,5.0,,"There is something incongruous about the cheerful voice on the audioguide that tells you how a family of 8 lived in a cubicle about the size of a minivan, or what happened in the tiny communal kitchen used by forty people when the single toilet also located in that space could not be flushed because the water was being used downstairs. And then you realize that this was not the middle ages or even the 19th centure, but the 1950s. In this small museum, especially its second-floor, you see how the working people of Chinatown lived their lives, preserving some modicum of dignity and raising families in appalling, practicaly unbelievable conditions, a mere half-century and a bit ago. Honestly, one of the most disturbing, moving, and interesting museums I visited in Singapore, something to contrast with today's country, with all its faults and strivings."
,,Wonderful glimpse into the founding Chinese in Singapore!,5.0,,Really enjoyed this visit! It's history coming to life. Would recommend this visit to any visitors to Singapore.
,,Worth a visit even for locals!,5.0,,We went as a group with kids in tow. They enjoyed it tremendously. It is visual and interesting history lesson for them.
,,"Wonderful museum, fascinating exhibits",5.0,,"I love recreations of domestic scenes. This museum is relatively new, right in the heart of Chinatown, created from a real shophouse on Pagoda Street. The latest in museum technology is utilised with a fantastic audio guide. The cubicles show us tableaux that help the viewer to empathise with the inhabitants of the original shophouse. You feel transported back in time. My 10 year old son and I were transfixed for nearly 3 hours."
,,Surprisingly Interesting Place and Great Spot to Beat the Heat!,5.0,,"It didn't look like much from the outside but the Heritage Center turned out to be a very worthwhile visit with detailed displays and a nice self guided audio tour. It provides a very interesting narrative not just about Chinatown but also about much of Singapore's history. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Chinatown to get a great perspective and certainly a fantastic resource for younger generations of Singaporeans as well.

The fact the place is well air conditioned and where one can easily take up 1-2 hours is a very welcome break from the blistering heat and humidity outside."
,,This is better than a 5 star experience.,5.0,,"This was the highlight of Chinatown for me. I am always interested to learn the history and the stories of the people, this experience was informative, humbling and so well done that I felt like I was literally a fly on the wall watching the lives of the occupants who lived there in the 1950's. I was helped by a lovely woman whose name is Celeste, if she is a volunteer, pay her, if she is an employee, pay her more! While we were there we booked a Trishaw tour to Clarke Quay and a Bum boat Singapore River cruise. Both were amazing, but the Trishaw ride was sensational. My husband and I loved every moment of it. Our chauffeur (not sure what his correct title would be) took us to where we needed to be for the bum boat cruise, ensuring that we enjoyed every minute. I recommend it to everyone who visits Chinatown, you will come away from there with a much greater understanding, appreciation and in my case gratitude. Thank you to all who contributed, especially those who gifted their family heritage and stories."
,,Detailed information,4.0,,"People who are curious and willing to know the history of Chinatown, this is the right place for you to visit! The entrance fee is SGD 15, but if you required guided tour, the fee will be SGD 20.
*Prohibited to video the place but taking photo is allowed."
,,Fabulous experience,5.0,,"In combination with the free audio guide, this heritage centre gives a terrific insight into the lives of the early Chinese immigrants. Each tiny cubicle housed a group of several people and shows where they ate, slept and lived and the tailor's shop showed how some worked as well. The commentary is fascinating and really brings their lives to life."
,,Guided tour of Chinatown Heritage Centre,5.0,,"We were expecting a museum but this was so much more. Our guide did an excellent job of guiding us through this tailor's shop front and rented cubicle rooms which didn't close until the late 1980s. Mr Chan and his tenants made for fascinating, well-researched true stories. If you've ever had a suit made in Singapore, or remember the days when this was common for Australian travellers, you will want to know what life was really like behind these doors. Good value and highly recommended."
,,Well set out and very informative,5.0,,This was an old chop house and is set out as it would have been. Unbelievable that families of 8 would live in a space little bigger than a cupboard! Very friendly and helpful staff who show how the tape system works. Arrive early to...More

,,Informative,4.0,,"I took the family here when they visited. You need to allow for around 1hr and are given headphones to accompany you whilst making your way through each section.

The narative was very informative and gives a great insight to life in the old days of Singapore but I wouldn't recommend this for young children. We had a teen with us who was getting a little bored - I'm guessing the lack of digitasion for an hour was too much! That said, worth a visit if you like your history."
,,Lots of well displayed information,5.0,,"It was the only interesting thing i found in Chinatown. Excellent guide, air-conditioned and lots of information about the history of the area and the country. Don´t miss it."
,,Sights sounds and smells on 3 floors of experiences.,4.0,,A well documented heritage of Chinatown and it's people. 3 floors of sights sounds and smells! Check out the opium den!
,,History,5.0,,A visit to Chinatown Heritage Centre is a step back into the past. It tells you the personal stories of people who made Chinatown their homes and the conditions that they lived in. You will walk through how they worked and lived and also get an idea of early buildings in the area. A break from the heat of Chinatown.
,,A MUST see place,5.0,,"We were there when they first opened a few years ago and thought it was interesting, but now they have expanded and enriched their offerrings. This is a real worthwhile stop when touring Chinatown."
,,A cultural highlight tucked away in Chinatown,5.0,,"The Chinatown Heritage Centre is a must do when visiting Singapore if you like to learn about culture and the history of what makes Singapore so great. The centre is set over 3 floors, the first 2 tell the story of different groups of migrants, their occupations and their daily lives in Singapore. The top floor provides a wonderful insight into the history of Chinese immigration to Singapore, key aspects of daily life and other interesting facts. The audio guides are well worth listening to and provide heaps of information."
,,Srep back in time,5.0,,"The centre is set as a shop house where 10 or more families would have lived and plied their businesses. The individual rooms are set as they would have been when the families lived in them. The rooms are cramped and filled with the few possessions that their occupants would have had.
Kitchens and bathrooms are replicated in their original cramped state giving an idea on how hard life must have been.
Learn about the many varied people who would have live in the house and their different roles and challenges.
The best part was the whole display is set to an audio where thee residents speak of their lives and aspirations. It makes you feel as if you now know each of the occupants.
Definitely a display you should not miss."
,,Audio guide a must-have,5.0,,The audio guide tablet you are provided with (for a fee) makes your visit here very informative. This is a great way to understand the hardships faced by the early settlers.
,,One of the best museums in Singapore,5.0,,"Fascinating things come in small packages. This museum is by no means large, but it is one of the most riveting and well-presented exhibits I have seen in a long time. A shophouse is re-created as it was back in the 1950s, with each cubicle and room fitted out in authentic style. What really makes the experience is the audio companion, which is included in the admission price. With your headphones on, you follow the audio as it takes you from room to room, explaining what sort of people might have lived in each room and what sort of lives they may have led. As cramped and unhygenic as the conditions must have been, it boggles the mind that the conditions in 1950s Chinatown represented a step up for the thousands of Chinese who came to Singapore to work. The third floor exhibits are also fascinating, covering various aspects of Chinatown society and culture. Well worth the visit."
,,awesome,5.0,,this place is very good and full of beautiful people . thank you for making my stay very comfortable and visit memorable.
,,Informative and A good way to pass time,4.0,,If you have nothing to do and you are staying in the Chinatown Area then might as well go ahead and visit. It would not hurt to visit especially if you love history.
,,Great display of how Chinese settlers lived in Singapore in 1950's.,5.0,,"Might have missed this, had the guide on Sentosa Is didn't tells us about the cubicle displays of how different people in a shop house lived, women workers, families, tailors, rickshaw riders, carpenter, nannies etc. They have a really well done audio guided tour, with stories,that you carry with you and start each part when you want. Other displays on Singapore history. Well worth the money and take your time."
,,Fascinating and Surprising,5.0,,"I was a little reluctant to go but took the hint from my wife and I'm so glad I did. I assumed that Chinatown was traditionally a commercial/retail hub but that is comparatively recent. It's true history is significantly different and the stories told in Heritage Centre were fascinating. The audio guide, whilst occasionally a little cheesy, added great depth to the visual displays. Well laid out, but be prepared for some steep staircases. That's part of the charm of being in a building that was part of the ""real"" Chinatown. I don't want to give the stories away but expect some discomfort!"
,,"A ""must do"" in Singapore",5.0,,"The guided tour was entertaining, informative and captivated adults and children alike. A wonderful insight into Chinese life in the final colonial days of Singapore. Fascinating that many of the people who actually lived on the premises in the 1950s contributed to the museum."
,,A place to learn,4.0,,"This museum in Chinatown shows the old chinese living style, you need to pay S15 for entrance, you can take the recorder to listen the guides. In conclusion, it is a place for tourists to see and learn"
,,EXCEPTIONAL best museum & interpretation ever!!,5.0,,WOW! from the fantastic engaging invite near the pagoda to the heritage centre where the presentation of the history is immersing and experiential- an exemplar!! so very well done... MUST Experience
,,Great little museum in the heart of Chinatown,5.0,,"What a great find! This museum takes you back through the early days of life in Chinatown in Singapore. How people lived, how they worked and how they grew their city into the great place it is today. Audio tour takes about 90 mins but is worth it for the added detail."
,,Interesting insight into ordinary life in Singapore before independence,5.0,,"The centre shows what life was like for chinese immigrant families in the 1950s, with whole families living in small rooms alongside each other, sharing a communal kitchen and ""shower"" and with their ""night soil"" collected in tankers each morning. Good audio guide. Well worth a visit - how thankful everyone must be to Lee Kuan Yew who led the country to its present comfortable state."
,,Worth a look,3.0,,"I wouldn't make a special trip across town to come see this center, but if you happen to be in the area it is an interesting side trip. You are given headphones for the first two floors and there are stories and explanations as you look at each room. The third floor is self explanatory. Although there were a few interesting things to see, I was not overly impressed with anything here."
,,The past preserved,5.0,,"It is sobering to think that these were the conditions people lived under for many generations in Chinatown. Think of it not just as a museum, but a shrine. It is good that it has been preserved the way it has been, to keep alive the memory of how hard life was for the average Singaporean. Mum, dad and 6 children living in a small room, sleeping on top of each other on the floor with no privacy and cooking in communal facilities at the end of the passage, working from 4am to late at night each day. Thank goodness that those times are now past. Without this gem of a museum, memory of those days would disappear with time. This is an absolute must see for any visitors to Singapore. Displays are well labelled but there are a lot of written explanation to read, so if you are pressed for time take the guided tour."
,,Interesting experience with a good variety of food,4.0,,Jumped off the Hop on Hop Off bus and had a meal here Very interesting and enjoyable Had a wander around and found the stalls ideal for buying souvenirs Recommend a visit
,,A real gem & a Singapore must!,5.0,,"This museum is a hidden gem in Chinatown. It tells a very raw, well-rounded story of the lives of the Chinese who moved to Singapore in the past 100 years or so. We took the guided tour for $20 and it was well worth it. The guide was excellent. Would highly recommend it!"
,,"A gem, a must see!",5.0,,"Wow, what an amazing museum! I cannot praise this place enough! It is such a gem. The exhibition is extremely well curated and the antiques very well protected. The staff members are extremely friendly. You need a good hour for the first two floors, and you need another 30-45 minutes for the last floor."
,,A fascinating glimpse into Singapore's past,5.0,,"Singapore is a fantastic city but its success at creating a modern thriving commercial hub has come at the expense of preserving the past. So much of its history has been buried under condos and skyscrapers, that it's difficult to get a glimpse of its fascinating past.

This museum is therefore a must see as it does a great job at recreating the past. What I love about it is that it understands that life is in the small details, so the audio tour both concentrates on the context but then in every stop highlights the small details like the peek hole in the floor of physicians room used to see who is arriving or to signal to a food hawker walking past. These details help you really connect to the past and these people's lives. It's such a well thought out and lovingly recreated place, down to the occasional and subtle placing of plastic cockroaches on walls, and tables. For me these small details help take you from a passive museum experience to actually making you think and feel what it was like to live in these times."
,,Enlightening experience,4.0,,"The Chinatown heritage centre is in the heart of busy Chinatown, we came across it by accident and decided a visit might be worthwhile. It's a recreation of a shop house of a Chinese tailor and family and workers/apprentices. It has an audio tour, it's informative, interesting and education. Downstairs is a tailors shop with workroom behind and kitchen and outhouse realistically restored. Upstairs is accommodation for workers of other jobs, crammed into small rooms , once again showing how they lived, what they wore and where they slept. Well worth a couple of hours."
,,Depicts the unique culture prevalent in Singapore,4.0,,"Love the fact that it portrays the culture and heritage of Chinatown. I think it is really well put together but sometimes too busy centre. One can go through the exhibit at their own pace which is the best part though if it is busy, one cannot move slowly. Worth the time if someone is interested in heritage and history."
,,A Special Trip Down Memory Lane!,4.0,,"Flew back to Singapore to spend Mother's Day and decided to give my elderly 82 year old mum a surprise visit to the Chinatown Heritage Centre! We, together with my mum's maid, arrived mid morning and were greeted by a friendly staff who gave us instructions and a quick briefing. Btw, they do not charge elderly people entry fee! My mum was on a wheelchair so we took the lift to every floor. She was very quiet most of the time as she looked at the pictures, history, photos and the many pieces of household and kitchen articles and set up which highlighted the lifestyle of the people in Chinatown during her younger days. She briefly spoke about her mum and the harsh conditions they had gone through and to appreciate what we have now going for us in Singapore! It was a special time of connection for us and coming here and doing something very different with her to me was very Special. Personally I had vague recollections of some of the things I saw but I definitely felt the connection and there were some moving moments for me too! We created our own self guided quiet tour and we took our time. My mum's maid also felt emotional because she was reminded of her family in Myanmar. I saw a few guides speaking to small groups of 2-3 mostly westerners. The passage ways were mostly for 1-2 people at the time and definitely no place to run around! We finished our tour within an hour and going just across the Centre was a Chinese restaurant! My mum ordered her favourite fried bee hoon, and her favourite Chinese coffee! Yes this is a Must See Place for tourists and locals alike to understand Singapore and its humble beginnings!"
,,Very interesting insight into life in the past,5.0,,Three floors of attraction with the first two being narrated using audio commentary. It's self paced and the various rooms tell the story of the occupants and give a glimpse of the conditions in which they lived.
,,Highly Recommended,5.0,,"I visited the Chinatown Heritage Centre with my husband, 1 year old baby, mother-in-law and 88 year-old grandma on May 10, 2017. I didn't have much expectation at first to be honest, but I think it might be a good place to bring grandma to, I am happy that I was right. The settings are pretty real (my mil noticed that even the smells are matching with the theme!) and we didn't need the audio guide at all as grandma got lots of interesting stories to tell. We enjoyed it a lot. This museum is highly recommended if you are visiting chinatown."
,,Classic Chinese Feel,5.0,,It has that feel fo China country. We feel as if we are in China. The temple is a must visit in this area.
,,An excellent insight into life in Chinatown,5.0,,This was a great experience. The audio-guided tour provided a fascinating insight into life in Chinatown in the recent past and the upper floor went on to explain the origins of the Chinese community in Singapore in a very accessible way. A great place to visit before going on to explore Chinatown itself.
,,Fascinating insight,5.0,,"We had previously visited the heritage centre prior to the renovation and thought it was good then. When we visited this time round we were amazed at the effort put into making this what in my opinion should be one of the top attractions.
A multi media guide provides insight into the lives of Chinese migrants in the 1950s. You are told their stories and view the conditions in which they lived and worked. It is very interactive and you get to smell opium although we were assured it was synthetic!
The work which has been undertaken is very impressive and there are 3 floors packed with history and information. The heritage centre is a must on any tourist trail so don't miss it."
,,excellent and amazing place,5.0,,"china town in singapore is not far from MBS, we can get taxi just 15 minutes. we can see old singapore chinese style. great place"
,,Clinton is the best! Really makes history come alive,5.0,,"This was one of the most fun tours I've had in a museum. Everything was well-lit and annotated, but Clinton could have led our group through with no markings at all. He told the stories of the people who lived and worked in the shop house, as well as Singapore in general, with enthusiasm and empathy. The stairs are very steep and narrow, but this is the only complaint or warning. They even make the different rooms smell like their contents, and they don't try to cover up Singapore's less glamorous history."
,,Best China town,5.0,,"I have visited many China towns in many countries. This one is the small though small. There are many restaurants, handicrafts and clothing shops. Reasonable price."
,,Cool and informative,4.0,,A welcome retreat from Singapore's heat whilst garnering some insight into Chinese Singaporean roots. The centre is located in a sympathetically converted shophouse; displays look authentic; the audio guide is particularly useful.
,,Its very interactive,5.0,,"My daughter is ten years old.She love it.She talk about this museums all the time. You can see the way they used to live ,We also smelled opium and egg tare in the showroom. Its very interactive.The the staff was friendly. I will recommend this place for sure."
,,Very well done,5.0,,"Although I prefer to stay in Chinatown when I come to Singapore, I'd never made it to the Heritage Centre - I think it was being refurbished on my last visit, and besides, I live in Hong Kong and feel like this is the Singaporean culture I already know the most about.

However, while there were many aspects of Chinese culture I recognised, the centre tells the story of Chinese immigrants from a uniquely Singaporean viewpoint. The first part is a reconstruction of how the shophouse might have looked when filled with an assortment of renters, and the audio guide really brought the scenes to life. The second part had further displays about links with mainland China and Chinese culture. Highly recommended."
,,The right place to learn about Singapore's Chinese roots,4.0,,"We visited to learn about the lives of Singapore migrants in the 1950s. Whoever says migrants and their descendants are privileged, trash, or other bad attributes should know that they are just human trying to improve their lives. And they work hard to achieve their dreams. We should, too. After all, we are all migrants. Of course there are problems of structural poverty, class discrimination etc but let's appreciate one another."
,,"Huge culture shock, probably one of the best museums",5.0,,"I'm not really a museum person, so I was very skeptical when I came to the Chinatown Heritage Centre.

However, it was an eye opening look into what life was like during the establishing of Singapore. You can see the individual lifestyles of people of varying social status and their living conditions. It is an incredible experience and I would highly recommend going.

Also, they offer international travelers a SIM card for 4GB of data and international calls for around 20 SGD for 4 days. I recommend buying this in order to find your way around."
,,Nice place to take photos,4.0,,They have collected and refurbished plenty of old items from the past and built replicas of the living conditions from the old days. Worth to spend some time taking photos.
,,Take the guided tour!,5.0,,"The guided tour is only $5 more than regular admission and it's so worth it. Our guide Clinton is so knowledgeable, friendly, and hilarious! It's the best way to get to learn Chinatown and its history. It looks like a small place but you could easily spend about 2-3 hours in here looking at everything."
,,Fascinating Snapshot of Singapore's Chinese Heritage,5.0,,The curators of this center have done an excellent job of creating an exhibit that makes the visitor feel he or she have stepped back in time through the progression of Singapore's Chinese heritage. Mutli-media presentations and authentic reproductions make for an engaging and educational tour. This is very nicely done and worth the time.
,,So many things to be seen !,5.0,,"The place gathers the real ""chinese face"" of Singapore, what includes a noisy atmosphere in that silent and polite city.
Good to eat, shop and enjoy just watching people move around or simple playing mahjong and doing other interesting things like ""writing"".... and all for a very, very good price !"
,,Gret place to soak in the Chinese culture and influence on Singapore,5.0,,"Allow a good 2 hours to get the most out of this excellent ""museum""
It is very well put together and is continuing to improve with lots more information coming to the guided audio tours.
Singapore changes so quickly and was very different not so long ago.
Very well priced and a must visit for anyone who enjoys the history of the place they re visiting"
,,Interesting history lesson,4.0,,We were recommended this museum by the guide on our walking tour. We enjoyed it a lot. You are given a headset with commentary for various rooms which relate the life of early working immigrants to Singapore and their conditions living in chop houses. There are various items from the day on display. Well worth spending an hour or so to learn the history of early Singapore & the difficult life early immigrants had to make this country what it is today.
,,FANTASTIC,5.0,,"I love Chinatown, there is so much going on and lots of stalls to look at and at night Smith Street is a great place to eat as the food stalls become alive"
,,Super great experienxe,5.0,,Very value for money with the guided tour. A true depiction of live of the Chinese Immigrants and their lives in Singapore. Brings back memories of my and my mum's childhood. Really strongly recommended.
,,Why go to China,5.0,,"Visited during short Singapore stay and was surprised about how good this place is.
You can see the way they used to live as well as visit all the shops and stop over for a genuine Chinese meal, all at reasonable prices. Great way to spend a few hours browsing around."
,,What a surprise,5.0,,We were making our way through Chinatown passed all the various Chinese market shops and noticed the entrance to this museum. We found this quite by mistake. We were not disappointed. This museum shows what life would have been like for many living in chop houses in 19th Century. Each room is authentically presented with many items from the day and each room tells a moving story about the people who lived there via an excellent audio guide. This should not be missed.
,,Great experience,5.0,,Great place to see the long mixed history of Chinatown in Singapore. Truly an eye opening experience of how life used to be and the contrast with modern Singapore
,,Interesting picture of Chines life in Singapore,4.0,,I don't think I've ever been in a museum quite like this one.It's easy to find...very close to the Chinatown MRT and near a lot of other attractions. The museum is not very large but I believe they succeeded in their goal of depicting the life of the Chinese immigrant to Singapore. It's easy to see they put a lot of thought and effort into the recreations. There is nothing flashy about this museum and no interactive displays but in it's own way it's pretty interesting. Worth a visit if you have an interest in the hstory of the Chinese in Singapore.
,,Great - really interactive,5.0,,"i was very skeptical at first, however the our really got me. the individual toura use multimedia devices which really creates an amazing atmosphere and immerses you in the history. entry is $15 singapore dollars and is well worth it."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,Great centre and museum open for just over a year. Gives a real feel for hoe the Chinese lived in the 1950s/60s with recreations of actual rooms and dwellings. Recommended.
,,Excellent insight into Chinese history,5.0,,"This is not a huge attraction but a fascinating one. The first 2 floors show restored rooms of what life would have been like for poor immigrants living in Singapore and explains the hardships they faced in their various jobs. The rest is a display about the history of the Chinese community in Singapore, their customs, leisure activities, education and welfare etc. It is a very interesting visit and adds to the colour of Chinatown outside. Worth a quick trip when you are passing by."
,,Learn about Chinese-Singaporean history,5.0,,I started my stay in Singapore with a visit to this fascinating museum. Great introduction to the multicultural heritage of Singapore. Shophouse location and audio-guide both very well done. It was an extra treat to be here during Chinese New Year.
,,Put your walking shoes on,5.0,,"Heaps of stalls, interesting sights, good food - the chilli crab was great, and you can buy all your souveniers in the one hit."
,,Best History Scene of Singapore,5.0,,"A Must See!! Entertaining museum. Thoroughly enjoyed this old shophouse, the furnishing is interesting. With this, you will capture the old Singapore in your heart!"
,,A must to see in Chinatown,5.0,,"My husband and I were so impressed with this wonderful insight to Chinatowns history. The way it was set out, fabulous audio guide and interesting history made this one of our highlights in Singapore. Well done to everyone involved in making it possible to keep Chinatowns history accessible to everyone, in particular the newer generation. Thankyou."
,,History lesson,4.0,,Learn all about Chinese settlers in Singapore and about their culture and history and how they contributed to the Singapore of today.
,,History under one roof,5.0,,"Paid our entrance fee and received head phones to listen to the guided tour. Very interesting, informative and made us aware of the hardships that the Chinese settlers had when arriving in Singapore."
,,Aces Museum,4.0,,"We highly recommend this attraction. It is informative, interesting, and beautiful. The story of the Chinese immigrants to the area unfolds with art, artifacts, words, photos and films. You will learn, be entertained, and be astonished."
,,Visit,5.0,,Buying a 3 day tourist travel paas gave free entry but would have paid the $15. Excellent museum showing how life was like and the conditions the people had to live in. Example of how different families lived and how the cooked and conducted everyday life well worth a visit.
,,Amazing museum,5.0,,"This museum shows a slice of history in the 'shop houses' - a crucial snapshot into the development of Singapore. The museum itself provides a clear and interesting tour through a restored shop house. The audio-guide is well done, the displays well laid out, and they seem to be authentically presented.
I thoroughly enjoyed our hours at this centre, and highly recommend."
,,Highlight of Singapore,5.0,,This tour is so very interesting as it highlights a particular shophouse and its residents during the early days of Chinatown. The guide we had was especially passionate about his subject and very knowledgeable. A not to be missed activity!
,,Visit Here !!,5.0,,What an excellent venue to visit - very well done - you definitely get a sense of what life was like - a must see !!
,,CHINESE CULTURAL EDUCATION,5.0,,The CHC is on the main market street but was a little difficult to find. It is a excellent small museum that uses audio guides to explain the life of Chinese workers and their living conditions. The explanations of what is called a shop house and how it played an important part in the community. Very well done. Highly recommend. A small entrance fee is charged. Hope this helps.
,,Cool...,4.0,,Very interesting look into the everyday life of people back in the days of a young Singapore. Incredible how they lived and thrived in small spaces. What a culture of hardy people
,,A truly excellent hand on museum....,5.0,,"I'd definitely recommend this museum....
There's lots to see.....fascinating details.....you learn tons and feel really intrigued as tales are told. .....you have a headset and a screen to show you what's what...
One of the best museums of its kind I've been to .....really impressive
The message of the centre really gets across."
,,How did I not know about this place,5.0,,This is a fascinating way to step into Singapore's past and learn about how people lived. We went here as part of The Original Singapore Walks.
,,Extremely interesting,5.0,,"Life for the early Chinese in Singapore was tough. How many managed to eke out an existence is hard to believe. The museum walks you through the tailor shop of a relatively well off shopkeeper, then takes you upstairs to the floor where 40 people shared one kitchen, one toilet and one shower. Absolutely fascinating, as we're the displays on subjects such as education, letter writers, death practices etc on the third floor.

An added bonus was if you were born in the year of the rooster, you get in free (because 2017) is the year of the rooster."
,,A must to visit in Chinatown.,4.0,,This is very nice for someone that is interested how the Chinese people 's way of life was in the past. And also really nice for someone that is Chinese-origin. The audio guide and all museum diplays are excellent. They really makes me feel like real and enjoy their stories. It is worth for money and to visit if you come to Singapore for the first time.
,,"Nice, well maintained museum in Chinatown",5.0,,"This museum is converted from a shophouse, it's not as spacious as other museums in Singapore it's definitely well designed and thought through. A nice trip back in time and everything looked so life like.

It was located just a few steps away from the Chinatown mrt station so getting there was easy."
,,THE museum! Do this.,4.0,,if you come visit singapore you should do certainly chinatown and don't forget the museum! Do this. Try to get in the weekdays to have a tour where you can fully enjoy! Other visitors may perhaps be disturbing.
,,a surprising gem,5.0,,"I did not expect much from this center and it far exceeded my expectations. The audio guide was terrific, each room represented the story of a person or family who settled in Chinatown. Very well done. Plan to spend a couple of hours."
,,Learn about Singapore's rich Chinese heritage,4.0,,"This place is a worthwhile visit for tourists that want a feel of some culture and heritage. There is a $15 admission charge and you get an audio headset for a self-guided tour around this museum. You can relive the experiences of the first Chinese settlers in the Chinatown area, from laborers to tailors and doctors. The upper floors have a great display of artifacts from the Chinese immigrant experiences. However there is no audio guide for the upper displays but everything is self explanatory with clear English signs. This place is worth a visit for anyone wanting to experience more than just shopping and food in Chinatown!"
,,Amazing learning experience,5.0,,"We recently went to the CHC for a guided tour.

My British cousin was visiting and I brought her to the CHC because I've always believed it is a must see. It was even better than my last trip. We took the guided tour with Chan who was so knowledgeable and well-read on the topic that we learned more than we ever thought we would. He was able to tell the stories not just of the people who lived in such conditions but also some of his own personal experiences.

The CHC is built on the stories of real families who lived in early Chinatown. They have gone to great lengths to interview them and showcase their lives. The care of the guide and the meticulous research of the CHC makes it a very special experience."
,,A real eye-opener,5.0,,The museum has recently re-opened and the investment has been well worth it. It's an extraordinary insight into how people (primarily Chinese immigrants) lived and it is quite shocking. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Absolutly a must!,5.0,,"This place is a must to get the chans to understand chinatown.
We hade a lovely and dedicated guide.
For two hours she made us intrested in the history of Chinatown.
The have kept one of the houses as a museum so you can take part of the way they lived before.

We can highly recommend this place."
,,Very interesting and close to past real life,4.0,,"A very well organized museum around the real life of Chinese coolies who migrated from China to Singapore during the 19th and early part of the 20th centuries.
Very impressive to see the appalling conditions in which they survived. The reconstitution of the housing is perfect to the details.
Well worth you time and money (15 st $). Aircon will freshen you up during your visit to Chinatown"
,,Don't miss this historic gem of a museum!,5.0,,"This lovely, little museum in Pagoda Street is easily missed but try not to pass it by. It gives atmospheric examples of what Singapore was like, actual little cameo settings of traders' shops and homes, including a tailor's shop with all its fascinating fittings. The thing I liked best were the hologram photographs of the dockside, 'then and now' displayed in a moment as you pass the exhibit. Brilliant! And it's still developing and promising other exciting features very shortly. (Headsets available)"
,,Excellent learning experience,4.0,,The Chinatown Heritage center is definitely a stop you should make when in Chinatown. The center is informative and educational and well set up to represent all information equally. A great cultural experience in Chinatown. Enjoy.
,,Grab a headset and get out of the sun!,5.0,,"This museum is really fun! I grabbed a headset at the door and stayed to listen to all the talks about each room. It is kind of a reenactment of life in the early days of Chinatown and although it was kind of ""Hollywood"" I really have to say I learned a lot and really enjoyed it. It was a terrific break from the brutal heat of the Singapore afternoon sun and there really was so much to see and learn about. It did not disappoint me at all!"
,,"Small Museum, Big Impact for Local Chinese with Immigrant Ancestors",5.0,,"Not many Singaporeans know about this little museum. Most eye it curiously, as they walk past. Ever since it went through a major overhaul in curation, renovation & technological updates, visiting The Chinatown Heritage Centre became an enlightening, surprising learning experience.

This exhibit has 2 parts:
1) The timeline of the Chinese diaspora to Nanyang (Southern Ocean Frontier), specifically the island of Singapore, chronicles the treacherous ocean trip, the different groups of Chinese, their trades & industry in Singapore under the British, the clans, entertainment, schools, food & festivals.
2) A sample 3-storey Chinatown shophouse curated with old items from people who have lived in one of these shophouses. You'd see cramp living quarters and even hear the sounds of life in these shophouses -- albeit in air-conditioned comfort.

As my maternal grandparents and my father had migrated to Singapore, this heritage centre enlightened me to the life that easily forgotten, in modern metropolis Singapore. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Learn about Singapore's multi-racial communities and the history of its original migrants.,5.0,,"I learned a lot during the self-guided audio tour. It took me back to the early 20th century through the life of the original inhabitants within the shophouse that this museum now occupies.

There are three levels inside this mini-museum. The first level is a detailed glimpse at a well known tailor's living quarters, showroom, and workshop, which occupies most of the first floor. It also houses the kitchen of the tailor's wife and the living quarters of his apprentices.

The second level is the living quarters of the rest of the tenants including a trishaw driver, samsui women, a cobbler who made red clogs, and a doctor and his family.

The third level is a glimpse at the seedy underbelly of old Singapore's hidden society. A world that included prostitutes who led tragic, hopeless lives, opium addicts, gamblers, and secret societies, which functioned like mafiosi.

The other half of the third level is also a great guide into all the ethnicities that populated Singapore in the early days - the Hokkiens, Hainans, Cantonese, Parsis, and the different Indian communities. I even learned about the kind of cuisine that each ethnic group was famous for and where to eat it in Chinatown right there and then.

The staff were all very helpful and friendly. They allowed me to leave my bag with them before I explored the museum. And the old man by the entrance of the shophouse gave me step-by-step instructions on how to take in the tour.

It's hard to believe that almost a hundred inhabitants were able to cram themselves into the shophouse - but that was the kind of life they had back then.

Overall, this was a touching, even humbling experience - especially when I found out how the original migrants arrived via what they used to call ""hell ships"" (imagine hundred of people crammed into one small boat, which could easily sink and with no space to move and being stuck in that position for weeks) and were forced to be super thrifty and resourceful just so they could survive."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Can not image how they get all the collection , but was impressed , lie took me back to that time . Highly recommed ."
,,"Highly education, entertaining and informative.",5.0,,I took a visiting guest and my two sons (aged 8 and 10) and had a nice tour. Walking though the shop house was interesting in itself. Our guide was engaging and reached all age levels. I learned SO much about the settlement of Singapore. Loved this tour...
,,Interesting diaramas,5.0,,I found this center very educational. It is all new to me so I appreciated the historical stories that were laced thru the rooms of historical occupants. What it would have been like to live back in early Singapore as a maid or dentist or family or shoe maker. We tried to listen to the audio but I don't have the patience. If you like more information you want to listen to the audio. I prefer reading.
,,Audio tour self guided tour,5.0,,Helpful staff Easy to use audio guide Fascinating reconstruction of living conditions for Chinese community and culture
,,Story-telling in a unique heritage center,5.0,,"This unique museum or heritage center situates in the heart of Chinatown, just go straight +/- 150 metres from Chinatown MRT Station exit gate. In this unique museum, the Singaporean Chinatown's story-telling will be delivered through an electronic guide with headsets. Just keep listen to the story, and enjoy the sightseeing of authentic displays. The displays and the stories will tell you about Chinatown settlers culture, and their struggle throughout the years."
,,Life In Ye Olde Singapore,5.0,,"This museum show us how it was like to be in the shoes of the Chinese immigrants that used to live back in the days when Singapore was still young. No matter your status and skills, there are certain things that still need be highlighted. Diligence and hardwork is what made the country it is today and it all started back in the olden days when times were bad and the forefathers had to toil.

Pretty good insight with a modernist slant (you get a self-guided interactive monologue) to how a museum should be. Definitely worth the admission price and the time.

Get yourself an e-postcard too whilst on your way out!"
,,Great displays that will open your eyes to early city life,5.0,,The museum was a surprise . well done and very informative. Be sure to get the head sets and go slow there is lots to take in of early life and hard times of days past. The displays were well done and original pieces throughout . What a hard life it was for so many
,,Great insight into early life in Singapore,5.0,,It gives a great insight into life of early Chinese settlers. Their stories of hard life are very touching and incredible after seeing what Singapore is like today. The stories are told through the online guide which made me feel close to them. Great museum worth visiting for real human stories.
,,Past of our grandparents,4.0,,"It shows us how our grandparents lived when they were young, what facilities they had and all the trouble they have to go through before getting task done"
,,Best museum we went to in Singapore!,5.0,,"This museum is truly first-rate. The entrance fee gets you a headset that you use on a self-paced tour through this recreation of life in a Chinatown ""shop house"". You really get an intense and realistic sense of what life was like for the variety of people who made a home and life in this part of Singapore!"
,,Great introduction to Singapore,5.0,,"For those folks visiting modern Singapore for the first time, it is certainly difficult to imagine what life was like there even a generation or two ago. Singapore has always been a place that attracted ethnic Chinese willing to sacrifice in search of economic opportunity. This museum carefully and comprehensively recreates a picture of how average working Chinese lived until the early 1960s. This is a rich place to start understanding the evolution of Singapore from colonial times to the wealthy, modern city it is today."
,,Excellent guide,5.0,,"Wonderful recreation of a crowded shop house. The detail of the lives there in the years up till 1950 were fascinating. Excellent audio guide, took us about an hour."
,,This gives an insight to past Chinatown,5.0,,"The visual, sound and even smell layout of this centre is excellent. The staff are so helpful and welcoming. The audio guide is very informative and you should allow plenty of time to fully enjoy your visit."
,,History comes alive,5.0,,"This is one of my favourite attractions in Singapore. It's a small 3-floored museum that shows you the lives of residents of Singapore Chinatown decades ago. You will be told stories of real people from all walks of life through their artifacts and pictures. Listening to the audio guide, you will understand the hard work, the hope and the struggle that made Singapore flourish. It is a very engaging way of learning and it certainly is moving. I think even children will enjoy this. However, there is no elevator at the museum, so it might be difficult for people with mobility issues."
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,This is a fascinating place to visit and well worth the time. The history of shop houses and Chinese emigration to Singapore is very well portrayed and you get a really powerful sense of the harsh living conditions that people had to endure.
,,The History of Chinese Migrant to Singapore,4.0,,This is a museum showing and display the history of Chinese Migrants to Singapore and the development of China Town in early stages.it is interesting and worth to visit.
,,A time capsule!,5.0,,"I visited Chinatown Heritage Center as part of a walking tour at my second day in Singapore, and it was definitely worth it!
It is not a traditional museum, i would rather describe it as a well designed time capsule : one can see and understand a lot about the real life of Singapore's early pioneers who left their villages in China and made their way there.

The explanatory material is well written and enlightening. Allow at least 1,5 hour to walk through all floors and halls of the centre. A real must!"
,,Really well done!,5.0,,"We passed by this attraction as we were exploring Chinatown. In the midst of the touristy, no-longer-quite-traditional Chinatown, this transported us back to the days of the first Chinese migrants getting into Singapore, and did so in a surprisingly insightful, thoughtful, and polished way. The amount of information, context, and history they crammed into the seemingly small centre is quite astounding - we walked out feeling we'd been immersed into a whole new world we knew nothing about, and appreciated Chinatown and Singapore all that much more afterward. Definitely highly recommended as a first stop before any further Chinatown explorations. We did not have to make a reservation as we were swinging by.

The one thing to note is that the audio guide they provide can be a little lengthy (insightful, but just a little lengthy), so don't expect to blitz through the centre in <30 minutes if you wanted to get anything out of it."
,,Surprisingly interesting,5.0,,"This was included as part of a walking tour and I wouldn't have chosen to go there myself, but glad I did. Interesting display that really provides insight into life in the earlier years of Singapore. Certainly worth the visit."
,,An insight into Singapore's Heritage,5.0,,"This heritage centre transports you back in time and gives you an insight into life for the residents living in shop houses. For a very reasonable entry fee you get a narrated, headset story and hear from the residents what life was like for them. This is a definite must visit if you are interested in history."
,,This place is a must,5.0,,We visited here and were blown away. This place is newly referred and the detail and information your get is amazing. It was fantastic to see how early life was in Singapore and great for our kids to see that as well. The exhibits were brilliant and we are taking my in laws there when we visit again in Sept 2017.
,,Very interesting,5.0,,I was not sure I wanted to visit this attraction because my time was very limited in Singapore. But it started to heavily rain so I decided to go inside and I did not regret at all. Lots of detailed info about the chineese immigration in Singapour. The entrance ticket includes an audioguide that gives tons of insight and background stories about the immigrants and their conditions of life. A must-see if you have time.
,,Amusing Tale Through History,5.0,,"Chinatown Heritage Centre provided a audio guide that brought the whole place alive with the stories of the people who lived there. The staff were very friendly and didn't mind us waiting in the lobby after our visit finished for the monster rainstorm to pass!

It's a place to visit for everyone to learn and appreciate how places evolve into the modern neighbourhoods we see toady."
,,A snapshot of old Chinatown in Singapore,4.0,,"For the tourist who is interested in Chinatown in the days gone by, this place offers a snapshot. For the locals, it is a place when the grannies would regale their grandchildren about the old times in Chinatown where rain meant floods, and more. Many talked about the old times fondly, but they are also glad that life these days has been better than in those days. One of the houses where the Heritage Centre is has been kept close to what it was in the old days, sans the smell :) A good starting point before you walk along the streets to Chinatown. You get a better feel and connection, and a sense of imagination of what life was like."
,,Always woth a trip,5.0,,If you go to Chinatown then you must look round the museum from the WW2 and the life before the occupation. Always love the whole area and nice to see it change over the last 40 years.
,,Educational,3.0,,Visited this museum while going around Chinatown. It was educational and the staff was friendly. I appreciated learning about the culture and history. It's good that there are museums dedicated to that.
,,Fascinating Insight into Immigrants Lives,4.0,,"A museum within a building that at one time housed a very large number of Chinese immigrants. Fascinating to learn how they slept, worked and brought up families in such small spaces. We were guided by a young man whose knowledge and passion shone through. Well worth a visit."
,,informative,4.0,,Visiting the museum gave us knowledge on how the Chinese evolved in Singapore and showed us how they lived in the early times. The audio and visual guide/gadget brought the museum's elements to life with their re-enactments and information.
,,A must visit for locals like us,4.0,,"As a local myself, i went in to look at the displays and to find out more about my heritage. The admission fee itself cost about $18 even for locals, which i find a tad expensive. It should be free entry for all locals. Thats minus one star for me. The other 4 stars is for the excellent displays i have seen and knowledge i learnt from the free electronic guided tour given to me. Good service was there too. I was expecting an electronic device for tour and it was given to me automatically upon my admission! I have since re-discovered my rich heritage and the hard work that my ancestors have put in just to bring my country Singapore to where it is today. Well done!"
,,loved it,5.0,,"An absolute must, when visiting China town! Very modern and interesting museum, that gives you a lot of historical insight and background information!"
,,Very Glad I Went,5.0,,"Upon arrival I was made very welcome by the staff and was told that I could join a guided tour which was going to begin shortly, if I wished. I decided to do so and paid S$20 which covered entry to the Centre and the guided tour.

I was joined by a Swedish couple and, right on time, we set off with our guide, a personable, thoughtful young lady whose name I unfortunately forget.

The tour was conducted at a pace which gave us plenty of time to absorb the information and take in the detail of the exhibits. As we progressed throughout the building, our guide spun a story which told of the lives of the various people who might have lived in the shop house at any one time. It was a very entertaining way of learning and it brought everything to life.

I'm so glad that I decided to visit and would recommend this attraction to everyone visiting Chinatown."
,,"Good, audio guide a bit long",4.0,,Nice museum to understand Chinese culture and Chinese migration to Singapore. Very interesting. They give you audio guides so that you can enjoy the museum by yourself. The audio guide was a bit long though.
,,A good introduction to the daily life in early Chinatown,5.0,,"The Chinatown Heritage Centre houses under one roof exhibits showing living quarters of the early inhabitants of Singapore's Chinatown. With the help of the audio-guide, visitors are brought back in time."
,,Different from other attractions in Chinatown,4.0,,"Unlike food hawkers and vendors selling souvenir stuffs, this museum offers different types of service. It shows how residents of Chinatown lived before, very interesting exhibits. Entrance fee is 15 Singaporean dollars per tourist.Seniors receive discounts, but only applies to Singapore citizens."
,,Surprisingly interesting - must see,5.0,,"We ended our walk through Chinatown in touristy section and wanted to go back to nicer part when we passed Heritage Centre. We were positively surprised by this authentic heritage centre, where you learn interactively how people worked and lived in Singapore in fifties and sixties. Highly recommended!"
,,Unique perspective of Chinatown history,4.0,,"Located just up the street from the Chinatown MRT station the Chinatown Heritage Centre, surrounded by tourist shops and restaurants, is well worth visiting. The $15 entrance fee includes a audio headset, which is essential as there are no explanation signs on the ground & first floor. The ground floor houses a re-created tailor's shop and living quarters and the first floor a series of lodging rooms. The audio commentary provides a description of who lived in the cramped surroundings and how they survived. The third floor explains the different aspects of Chinatown, including some of the more unsavoury aspects, the societies, opium use, prostitution and slavery. It is really well put together and gives you a unique perspective on Chinatown's history."
,,Suprisingly Enjoyable!,4.0,,Took me longer to stayed here than I intended. It's like going back in time and witness the history by ourself. I love the stories .. Some very touchy
,,Don't miss this compelling display and commentary of the Chinese immigrant experience,5.0,,"Definitely worth your time and money and emotional investment reliving the stories of the Chinese immigrants in Singapore. Fascinating up close look at the artifacts of their lives and re-creation of their living conditions and society. Audio commentary included in the price of admission adds to the drama and realism of the exhibits. Walking through the tight, spartan quarters of the recreated rooms will give a greater sense of how difficult life was for these and other poor immigrants."
,,A must see atteaction,5.0,,"This small but perfectly laid out museum in one of the old shop houses in Chinatown is a good example of how, with its audio tour tourists are given a good view of the history of how the poor people and the working classes lived in Singapore in days gone by. Laid out as it used to be many years ago, we can get a good idea of how people used to eat work sleep and play in very small rooms with their whole family. They used to share a kitchen and toilet which was emptied once a day, and The accompanying audio tour was excellent."
,,"Sanitised, but interesting",3.0,,"This museum does a solid job of presenting what life was like in the ""old"" Chinatown. The recreations of businesses and (squalid) living conditions were generally well executed, and are worth the ticket price. These displays don't have captions, so you need to listen to the audio commentary provided with your ticket - this was fairly interesting, but the commentary for some elements was a bit too lengthy.

The main failing of the museum is that while it does a good job of illustrating how tough living conditions were for Chinatown's residents (including some surprisingly sensitive discussion on why opium was widely used), it doesn't really explain how the area changed from a slum into a tourist zone, and what the locals thought of this. Presumably most were pleased to receive a HDB flat, but this process isn't explored. In addition, the section of the museum on living conditions emphasises solidarity among inhabitants of the crowded housing, which sits awkwardly with the displays on the top floor which provide a fairly frank discussion of the predatory conduct which often occurred. Who profited from maintaining the slums and why they weren't stopped earlier also isn't addressed.

Overall, this is a worthwhile museum but it only tells part of the story."
,,Beautiful heritage!,5.0,,"so enjoyed the beauty of the buildings and the explanations of the sculptures and temples, all within walking distance of my hotel"
,,So interesting...and the FOOD!,5.0,,"You can easily spend a day browsing around the markets and just sitting at a great cafe drinking cold beer and eating great food while you watch the throngs of people go by. This is a liquorice all sorts place, you can see, hear, taste or buy anything and everything imaginable made in China. Depending on where you buy and now good your negotiation skills are, you can spend a fortune or walk away with a bargain"
,,Walked out of there with a clear understanding of Chinese culture,5.0,,Great value visit. $S15 gave us the run of the place and an audio system to explain it. Really impressive displays which allowed us to understand the Chinese experience in Singapore - very sobering in many ways
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"This gives real depth to Singapore's recent history. It's very well done, the audio guide tells the story through individual lives as you tour the tiny rooms they lived in."
,,Story of Chinese Migrants Searching for Better Life in Singapore,5.0,,"Migrants take perilous journey in search of better life in a far away land. This museum tells the history of the Chinese migration to Singapore and their daily lives. The exhibits are true to time period, the electronic tour guide provides lot of information. If you are into museums, the Chinatown Heritage Center is a must instead of wasting your time buying cheesy overpriced souvenirs from the street vendors."
,,Audio commentary too verbose,3.0,,"You get a free audio set (rightly as it's a pricey ,$15 entry) but I switched it off as it tries to create a drama rather than just add to the captions which I found were quite sufficient for my purposes."
,,Too bad you've seen it all before,4.0,,"Lots of shops with the same merchandise purporting to be bargains, and even a few actual ones at the low end, but the rest: the same price as the US price. The internet is the leveler of all. But once the shopping bug has got ya, ya gotta shop."
,,Great museum,5.0,,"This was one of my favorite sites in Singapore. It provides a thorough account of the lives of Chinese immigrants in Singapore via an audio tour of a staged boarding house. If youre interested in this aspect of Singaporean history, definitely visit."
,,Very Well Done.,4.0,,"Wonderful look back to the 1950's era in Singapore when people had moved in rapidly to start a new life. People were crowded into these shop houses because it was all they could afford. Be sure and get the audio guide which explains a lot. The furnishings, clothing and the stories of those who lived that life are quite interesting."
,,very interesting,4.0,,had not planned to visit the heritage centre but as i passed decided to pop in. i really enjoyed the centre and found the exhibition to be very interesting and informative
,,Cultural interest,3.0,,I went to chinatown but found it very crowded (may be because of weekend and holidays). You can find cheap buys and sovereigns here to take back . Being a vegetarian I could not explore the food side of it as most of them server non veg food.
,,Hidden gem of Singapore,5.0,,We went on recommendation and were not disappointed. It was very interesting showing what it was like for the chinese immigrants arriving in Singapore. The centre showed within a house how the rooms were set out and how families and individuals lived. Our visit was enhanced by going on a tour with a retired chinese doctor who lived in chinatown as a young boy and shared his own experiences. Easy to check online when open and times of the tours.
,,The Past Brought to Life,5.0,,"This amazing museum brings Singapores past to life. You can have a guide or take the headphones to guide you through the place. Its set in a house thats made to look like it did over 100 years ago. It demonstrates how the Chinese and Malaysians lived when they first came to Singapore. Its very interactive, you can enter the rooms, touch the exhibits and hear the sounds that would have been arounbd a long time ago. Life was very hard then and its hard to imagine how the Singapore today has evolved from the hardship that was endured years ago. It gives an insight into Singapores vastly diverse population, well worth a visit."
,,Not Impressed,2.0,,We were having great expectations from this place. However we were disappointed. This place will give history of Singapore. But not worth the time.
,,clean nice and interesting,4.0,,the temple is very nice and also the pagoda street and ones nearby worth a visit . also relatively cheap souvenirs .
,,Well planed experience,5.0,,a taste from the individuals chinese life in singapore around the 60s. Its very authentic. you can see the lives they had and hear their stories. Suits also to the ones that not usually love museums.
,,Don't visit Chinatown without stopping here!!,5.0,,"Don't walk past - walk in and be enriched by the experience of what chinatown was really like for Chinese migrants in the early/mid 20th century!

You will see Chinatown differently afterwards! Incredible insights into the life of Chinese migrants and the recreation of the shopfront and living conditions is very confronting. It gives you a perspective into how difficult it was for these migrants to begin a new life in a new country. Audio guides are excellent. Highly recommended and great value for money at $15-20SGD!!"
,,Interesting and educating,5.0,,"Visited this place unplanned, having been in the area to check out some temples and other parts of China town.

The Centre is easy to find and after paying the entrance fee you get a set of headphones and a mobile device for your interactive tour - self paced.

The first and second floor show life in the ""old days"" and give a pretty good, really good, insight how life was back then. The interactive guide does a great job and is very well made. The top floor has some other exhibitions related to Chinatown and the Chinese culture. Also here everything is well done and a good job was done adding some interactive elements.

If you are interested in Chinatown and it's culture , don't miss this place."
,,This is a must see,5.0,,"This is most probably the most interesting tourist attraction in Singapore. There is so much information provided on the Chinese migration and/or travelling to work in Singapore and how the lived and survived.

Being set in an old shop house, reality strikes as to the real living and survival conditions. There is so much information provided, but does not become repetitive nor boring.

A great attraction, well worth a visit."
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,"I've lost count of the amount of times I've visited china town when in Singapore. Amazingly I'd never thought to visit the heritage centre. I'm glad I did. Doing so opened up a whole new perspective on China town and the tough lives led by many of its early inhabitants.

The heritage centre consists delightfully authentic displays complete with piped in sounds and in some cases even scents. The supplied media guide provides an excellent accompaniment that really brings the whole experience to life.

If in Singapore, it really is worth checking out"
,,good way to appreciate Chinatown,4.0,,"just only few steps from exit A, mrt Chinatown. well design presentation and nice staffs. Located in the lifely market, old style buildings, cheap goods and must buy SG souvenirs shops."
,,Cool Experience,4.0,,While you are in Chinatown give some time to Chinatown heritage center you will enjoy with history and great status in different color having nice photo to remember It's appropriate at any time
,,Make it a priority!,5.0,,"We were amazed at this attraction which gives the full story of the arrival of the Chinese in Singapore and their subsequent contribution to Singaporean society. The audio presentation was very informative as you walk through the rooms of the shop house. Don't leave this attraction to the end of your holiday, but rather, make it a priority."
,,I was blown away. Full of so much history,5.0,,I qas blown away with this place. I learned so much about Singapore that i never knew. On your visit to Chinatown stop by the heritage centre. Its air conditioned and really well done. Worth the $$$
,,Experience life in a Singapore shophouse,4.0,,"In the Chinatown neighborhood of Singapore, families lived in shophouses. This heritage center gives you an idea how life must have been for these families. The cubicles are pretty cramped. Furniture, crockery and clothing of that bygone period offer glimpse into an era long past. You can look into a peephole in the floor as residents in the past would do to find out who was at the door below."
,,A wonderful surprise,5.0,,"The Chinatown Heritage Centre was not on our itinerary, but we loved it. It's a museum dedicated to the story of the development of Chinatown told through the living conditions of the original Chinese workers. It's set in a shophouse, with the interior lovingly restored or recreated to reflect the work and life of the immigrants. It is just amazing and I highly recommend a visit if you're in Singapore."
,,Get ready to swim in the crowds,4.0,,"You can find many souvenirs here with extremely cheap price especially in large amount. Beside Buddhist temple is nearby, you may find the Hindu temple on another side end of the road."
,,Fascinating insight into people's lives,5.0,,"I think for anyone interested in Singapore's history and culture, this is a must see. It shows how people lived in Chinatown and it was eye opening. You can't help but be amazed at the resilience of the people."
,,A fantastic surprise,5.0,,"Knowing absolutely nothing about this place, (having not looked it up or read about it) I was initially unsure if I would get much out of it. Weighing up the $15 ($20 guided tour) cost I decided to go as I had several hours to fill. The guide Clinton was fantastic and really brought Chinatown of old to life before our eyes, the stories that go along with the exhibit really give a great insight and I would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Chinatown."
,,Almost complete history of china town and chinese in singapore,5.0,,"We visit this place to spend our time waiting for shops around the place are open. Actually we surprise the museum tells us very complete story of chinese tradition, cubicle place and journey of chinese people since beggining in spore. Wish this place always maintained as well so we could take our kid to this place....really recommended especially for you who have kids to know history"
,,Great boutique museum,5.0,,"This place takes some time to adjust to, but it has a unique and interesting way to convey life in the China Town neighborhood back in the days. A lot of thought and detail have been put to this place and a lot of information is available.
If you find the subject of Chinese immigration to Singapore interesting, allow 1.5-2 hours for a visit in the Chinatown Heritage Centre."
,,Good insight into the Singapore Chinese culture,4.0,,"A very insightful trip back into the old Singapore to see and ""experience"" the Chinese way of life when they came over to Singapore. Structuring the centre in the way life would have been back then is a good idea and an easy way of showing visitors what life was life.

I like the small touches that the Centre added to make the place seem more real...introducing real characters, their history and where they are today in modern Singapore; small artifacts like the food/animals/furniture allowed me to enjoy the whole experience more!"
,,Start Your Chinatown Tour Here,4.0,,"Chinatown is a must for any tourist in Singapore, but rather than wander blindly around, start at the Chinatown Heritage Centre and learn about the history of the Chinese in Singapore and about some of the landmarks you will see as you go around Chinatown.

The Chinatown Heritage Centre is on Pagoda Street, which is at the epicentre of Chinatown, but keep an eye out because it is an inauspicious building and is easy to miss.

The Centre successfully recreates the ambiance and atmosphere of the 1950s houseshops that were a feature of Chinatown half a century ago.

When you do start your own tour look out for wall plaques that give information of historical interest. For example, at Sawasdee Thai Restaurant on Pagoda Street there is a plaque on the front wall that tells you the history of the building as a Chinese opium den, until opium smoking was banned in Singapore in 1941."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Spend 2 hrs there! The audio guide explain well, It's really a must see if you want to know the history of china town in singapore"
,,Enjoyable and informative,5.0,,"I did the guided tour with Clinton...he was very interesting and informative, with a good sense of humour. Despite having lived in Singapore for a couple of years now, I still learnt lots more about Chinatown, and it was fascinating to actually see the conditions which the people lived in...can highly recommend this tour"
,,Fascinating,4.0,,"Well worth a visit. $10 entrance with audio and extra for guided tour. Information plaques in abundance - amazing how so many people coped in such cramped and basic conditions
It is very busy and the passageways are narrow - although the place is not good for wheelchairs there are elevators for folks with mobility problems"
,,A brilliant centre - really informative,5.0,,This centre has recently been done up (it seems the last couple of years that has been the case for lots of places in Singapore - things don't stand still). It;'s a real eye opener about the circumstances in which Chinese people used to live. Very well presented and great for children from what we observed.
,,Pleasantly surprised!,5.0,,"I visited Chinatown and came across the Heritage Centre by accident.

Anyway, expecting a simple place with photos of 'old Singapore' and a few knick knacks; instead I found a quaint and charming set up of what it used to be like in the early days for the migrant workers to Singapore.

Really interesting and if you wanted an in depth tour, audio is available (inclusive) of a small charge.

Would definitely recommend it to those interested in a little history!"
,,Informative and Enjoyable,5.0,,Stumbled upon this by accident whilst in Chinatown. Really glad we did. Learnt loads and the audio tour very helpful. Would recommend for adults and children.
,,Good for enquiring children's minds,4.0,,"An interesting walk through the early Chinese social history of Singapore. Our boys (7 and 10) were interested to see how ordinary people lived, and how cramped their accommodation was until very recently. Being able to walk through a shophouse like this put them right back to the late 1800s/early 1900s, and see how various people lived according to their occupation (and therefore income). It's kind of a living museum, without the mannequins and without people dressed up in period costume pretending to be something they aren't."
,,the best thing to do in china town,4.0,,do not miss this centre it gives you a good insight how live was for the chinese in former times. the audioguide is very informative.
,,One of the Must Sees.......,5.0,,"It's easy to walk past this fascinating museum, tucked away as it is between colourful market stalls in Pagoda Street (it's number 48)! The exhibits are spread over three floors, and an audio guide talks you around the first two. Fascinating insight into how the early Chinese immigrants lived and worked, and the struggles they had getting there in the first place. It depicts the working and living conditions of several different trades-people. It's a touchy feely museum too, and nothing is nailed down. At $15 pp to get in, we thought it very good value, and we took a good couple of hours to complete our tour. Don't miss it!"
,,Informative history of Chinatown and Singapore,4.0,,"You might miss it when walking at Pagoda St. (from the train station) since its surrounded by stores. Its on the left side. There is a minimum entrance fee but its really worth it. It feels like you will be transported back to early time of Singapore, when immigrants from China are starting to make a living in the city. During the visit, there were also visitors from a pre-school/nursery, so we just took our time and let them pass.

Overall, this should be on your list if you are visiting Chinatown."
,,Great history lesson,4.0,,"We had a free pass to the Heritage Centre included on our Singapore Tourist Pass, so we thought we might as well check it out while we were in Chinatown. Very glad we did. The first two floors are an audio tour....you wear a headset and follow the trail looking at the displays. I enjoyed this part....but found some of the story telling dragged on too long. The 3rd floor was definitely the highlight....there were some brilliant and informative displays that help explain the background to Singapore's cultural diversity.
Not sure if I would have visited here if we didn't have the free entry.....but it's well worth a look."
,,A hidden Gem of Singapore's History,5.0,,"The Chinatown Heritage Centre is brilliant the way it delivers an interactive way of showing people the history of Singapore. Great for families, although is a little expensive the kids mine aged (7,9,11) loved it, I have also been here with a school excursion with 8 year olds. The fact you can touch feel listen and experience so many aspects means you can get lost in here for hours."
,,Must visit,5.0,,Well worth the 15 dollar Singaporean. Three floors with two shophouses. Lots of history and information. Took around one hour to view everything.
,,Hidden gem,5.0,,"Set in the middle of busy chinatown, this quaint museum provides a walk-through into little rooms decorated in old-style chinatown. You are provided with a audio-guide which I highly recommend as it's linked with a tablet showing photos and guiding you through the themed rooms. There are two levels of these themed rooms, in which you can look inside and walk around as if back in time! The top floor provides further information into the immigration back in colonial times. Wonderful exhibition and very informative! Recommend going first thing before exploring the rest of Chinatown."
,,Good historical visit,5.0,,"In the middle of the shops and restaurants in Chinatown, this was a really informative experience. There was a lot to listen to on very modern audio smartphones. Each room had a story about life in Singapore. Gave an excellent insight into the hardships and sacrifices made by the Chinese workers.

The first floor was the tailor shops and showed the relative luxury that the tailor and his family lived in (with their own kitchen and ""toilet"" compared to the people crammed into the rooms on the second floor.

The third floor was very detailed but we ran out of time and could not spend as much time as we would have liked. The section on the death house and the vices looked interesting.

Everyone should visit and spend an hour or two before heading out to the numerous restaurants which surround the Museum."
,,Very interesting - well worth a visit,5.0,,"Visited on our final afternoon before flying home. Entry was 15 Singapore dollars per adult and it was well worth it. You get an audio guide which is high quality and gives considerable information. If you want an insight into the lives of people who first came to Singapore then this is the place. There are various cubicles laid out as people of the time would have lived with genuine artefacts. The audio guide gives further detail describing how each person would have lived and worked, including the tailor, the carpenter, the physician and the coolie. We learned so much and would strongly recommend if you want to learn about the culture and history of Singapore Chinatown in the early days."
,,Well Done,4.0,,3 floors describing life in Chinatown 100-200 years ago. Headsets with narration for self-guided tours that last about an hour. Informative.
,,Covers Chinese Immigration In Singapore,4.0,,I visited Singapore on business in June 2016. The Chinatown Heritage Center is well worth a visit although the entrance fee is a bit high. It covers the history of Chinese immigration to Singapore. There are replicas of sweat shops and cramped apartments where Chinese immigrants lived. If you have time I recommend a visit. The air conditioning to escape the heat is also nice.
,,Teenagers found it really interesting,5.0,,"We loved this place. The admission price provides you with self guided tours of levels 1 and 2.

Level 3 has lots of information in English. One hour here (you will probably stay longer) will provide you with a very informative and memorable visit to Chinatown.

There is clearly a lot of thought has gone into the way the Center is presented and it gives a real insight into the lives of the early Chinese immigrants to Singapore.

It will leave a lasting impression on all of us."
,,Interesting and well presented,4.0,,"In the center of Chinatown in a former shophouse you will discover the tough life of chinese emigrants at the begining of the previous century. A tailor shop (which was also his house), the small cubicles in which were leaving coolies and families (sometimes up to 8 people). It is very well explained and presented and after this you have explanations on the life and habits of the chinese population in Singapore from arrival, to slavery, gambling , prostitution, opium, way of leaving, mariage, death and community support. Well done"
,,A gem in the heart of Singapore's Chinatown,5.0,,"Tucked away on Pagoda Street in Singapore's Chinatown it is easy to miss the plain entrance to this gem of a museum. The museum tells the story of how ordinary people lived in Chinatown at the end of the 19th century and early 20th. It is spread across several adjoining shop-houses above the market street so it is much bigger than it seems at first glance. The restored residences follow the lives of a few families known to have lived in the district - a tailor, an apothecary, a street vendor, a carpenter and how they lived in dense proximity to each other in conditions of doubtful sanitation. It is a story of enterprise, of disease, of a hard life behind the facade of the market sellers. It is a 'warts and all' presentation of refreshing honesty. I rank this as one of the most interesting museums in Singapore and definitely recommend it to others."
,,Amazing and authentic treasury of heritage,5.0,,"This place was unbelievable! We spent hours inside, using the audio tour, and enjoyed every part of the centre. It was large and detailed, carefully put together, interactive, and excellently curated. A must see if visiting China Town."
,,Realistic approach in telling history,4.0,,This newly opened museum is interesting and has a vast array of items on display. It occupies a few floors and each floor has it's own story and history. It is fun and each item has enough information. We enjoyed it.
,,A museum to make you think!,4.0,,A fairly new museum on Pagoda Street in Chinatown but one that recreates the life and tough living conditions of shophouse tenants in the 1950's. A museum to make you think!!
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"Nice place, extremely well done and arranged! We felt like going back in time and it really helped to understand the basis of the modern Singapore people! Recommended!"
,,A worthwhile visit,5.0,,Give yourself plenty of time to see this place a lot of detail has gone in to give you an insight into the living conditions and lives of early settlers in Singapore.I used the audio guide and found it helpful.Very educational for older children.
,,An excellent museum,4.0,,This is a great place to learn about China and Chinese history very informative!! They are extremely helpful and if you get lost they are the place to tell you how to get to places
,,Excellent museum,5.0,,This museum is well worth a visit during a visit to Singapore. The audio guide (included in entry price) was very informative and detailed about the lives of the Chinese immigrants who went to Singapore.
,,Situation reconstructed with much love and care,5.0,,"In this special museum you not only experience the life of a coolie, but you also get to hear the sounds and smell the smells of that time. There weren't a lot of exhibitions, I assume but a lot of imitates where you can touch and even rooms where you can walk in.
Very very informative also due to the the audioguide that you get with the normal admission fee."
,,Thumbs up!,5.0,,"A very engaging way to showcase the history of Chinatown. It's a walk back in time as you step into the tailor work area, the kitchen in the backyard, the bedrooms of different families.... Almost like walking into a film set. The audio explanation was very helpful too. As a result the children thought the museum very interesting and learned something important of Singapore's history. Even for someone who knows the history, I thought this museum was great. Why isn't there an amusement park that integrates both the historical and cultural side of all ethnicities in Singapore? It would be such a hit."
,,A Gem!,5.0,,"This small museum is definitely worth a visit. There are three restored shophouses and as you walk through, you listen to the stories of the Chinese immigrants who left their homeland to find a new life. Interesting, heartbreaking, unbelievable poverty, almost unimaginable living conditions. This museums bring those narratives and the people who lived them to life. Our group ranged in age from 13 to 72. All of us found the museum fascinating, engrossing and well worth the cost of admission. My only wish would be a gift shop with more books on the history of Chinese immigration within Asia. The museum is expanding and I look forward to another visit on my next trip to Singapore."
,,"Excellent Museum, you feel the life of a hole chinese house",5.0,,"This museum is prefect. You are instantly living with these family. The atmosphere they created is nice and everything is real. You walk in the house, passing rooms after rooms. You have a free audio guide which is really good too.
I definitly recommend this museum.
Closed each 1st monday on te month"
,,Great insight into Chinatown History,5.0,,"A must-visit in Chinatown. This museum displays and explains life in Chinatown in the early 20th Century. Everything is very nicely set and the explanations go a long way to immerse the visitor in what life was like in Chinatown, a central part of Singapore history."
,,Enthralling - a unique insight into Chinatown life in the mid 20th century,5.0,,"This was one of the highlights of our recent visit to Singapore and highly recommended if you are interested in history and the lives of ordinary people. Allow plenty of time as there is a huge amount to see. The ground floor of the centre recreates the shop-house of a tailor in the 1950s, living with his wife, family and apprentices. Every aspect of the re-creation is interesting and the audio guide provides an excellent commentary as you move through the rooms. Upstairs you can see a series of cubicle rooms in which astonishing numbers of tenants lived, worked and raised families, sharing cooking and washing facilities. There is a wealth of visual and audio detail about their daily lives and occupations, all based on real life stories. Beyond this section there is lots of information about the lives of pioneering immigrants from villages in China, their experiences on arrival and the changing face of Singapore. A local resident recommended the Chinatown Heritage Centre and we were very glad we visited. Would definitely return."
,,Trip Down Sago Lane,4.0,,"My granddad and his family lived on Sago Lane. Growing up, his shophouse has been my weekend and holiday home. I can remember the many hours playing along Chinatown's ""Street of Death"" and picking up coins thrown by devotees who were praying for the fate of their dead. It sounds eerie now but back then it was so fun.

All these memories flooded back with each step I took on this tour. The self-guided tour app gave me a chance to enjoy the tour at my own pace, savor the scene and reminisce.

The ceilings, floorboards are exactly what I remembered (except they were more steady and didn't make squeaky noises as we walked on them).

Every room came with a personal story. This added so much color and texture to the tour. I can almost smell the air and feel the life of yesteryears.

I was looking forward to seeing Sago Lane but was a little disappointed that they didn't display more things. What I remembered were coffins, paper houses, funeral parlours, clothes dying business, lots of burning on the streets.... Too macabre to be exhibits perhaps, but it would have been even more authentic.

Last but not least, I loved the final room where we get to take photos and leave notes for remembrance. It added so much life to the museum and reminded me that I got to enjoy the space with so many people. The icing on the cake is the opportunity to send my funny pics to my email. Thanks."
,,Spend a few hours here,4.0,,In the heart of chinatown you find this new renovated heritage center! The audioplay is easy to follow and with the rooms you really get the felling of how it was to live here back in the days! Spend a few hours in chinatown and do make a visit here! Really good service aswell. Really recommend it!
,,A great insight into the not so distant past of Singapore,5.0,,"The newly renovated Chinatown Heritage Centre is a must see (and a great way to fill a few hours on a wet day). The centre has recreated a real shophouse with store at front and the accommodation behind and above. There is a great audio guide which explains everything you see. It is very immersive - you stand in the rooms, touch the cloth in the store, walk into the kitchens, try to imagine what it was like with 8 people sharing a minute room. See the kids toys, exclaim over the bathroom ""facilities"" right in the middle of the cooking areas! The fact that this museum recreates recent history (1950s) gives an amazing insight into the lives of some of the people who helped make Singapore what it is today.
Great experience for adults and kids alike. Really worth a visit. I will never look at my house again and think that it is too small! I look forward to going back in the future as they are still expanding the exhibits."
,,Totally different experience,3.0,,I visited the heritage center to take a closer look of what's old chinatown is. I have never regretted the visit as I got a better understanding of the life of olden days in chinatown.
,,A really successful renovation,5.0,,"The Chinatown Heritage center re-opened its doors recently after a complete cleanng and relooking of the visit. I spend more than 1 hour in the past of Singapore, with so many different chinese people ; the taillor, the physician, ... living with them in the typical common house of the early 20th century. the 3rd floor also is totally new and show, across indian or chinese views the old chinese district, the main celebration such as Chinese New Year. I was very well received, well equiped with tablette and earphones. The visite is only in English and Madarin. hope they will propose soon others foreign langages."
,,An Excellent Place to know the Life of Old Days of Chinatown,5.0,,"A must-go for anyone who wishes to know about the daily life of the older Chinatown in Singapore.
It has a good and vast collections of everyday things of the working class of that era.
A great place for parents to educate the young about the life of the olden days of Singapore."
,,"Trip to heritage town, Chinatown, Singapore",5.0,,"Really amazing tour, friendly people, great location and really insightful! The price was also good and it even recommended eateries!"
,,Wonderful Window to the Past,5.0,,"Museums such as this explain the wonder that is modern Singapore, and why Singaporeans are rightly so proud of their city's achievements. It is a wonderful window into how so many people lived even 2 generations ago, AND how they have built so much when starting from so little."
,,"Informative, Unique, and Fun",4.0,,"The museum - which just underwent a renovation - is excellent. Self-guided with an iPad you can hang around your neck, each member of your party can go at their own pace, listening to as much or as little detail as they like. The stories are presented in a fun and informative way, and the detail in each room is excellent. Once you finish with the recreated tenement, you enter the actual museum, which is informative and well done. At the end, you can take a Photo Booth photo using very fun and unique backdrops for posterity. The only downside is that we emailed them to ourselves, and never received them. That was a bummer."
,,The China Town experience in Singapore.,5.0,,"Singapore’s historic Chinatown is a bustling mix of old and new, filled with traditional shops and markets as well as cool stores and cafes. The cramped fivefootways, dingy alleys and raucous street hawkers are relics of Chinatown’s past.

Yet pockets of history remain in Chinatown, along with more modern sights. You could easily spend a few days wandering through these still-narrow streets.

Family-run goldsmiths, medicinal halls and teahouses ply their trades next to sleeker neighbours such as hipster bars and lifestyle shops.

If you’re a foodie, try ‘char kway teow’ (stir-fried noodles) and ‘satay’ (barbecued meat skewers) at Chinatown Food Street, a row of hawker stalls, shophouse restaurants and kiosks along Smith Street.

For trendier tastes, chic restaurants and bars are in Neil Road, Duxton Road and Keong Saik Road. The vibe is electric in Club Street and Ann Siang Road on Friday and Saturday nights, when locals and expats head down for dinner and drinks.

Want to shop? Buy souvenirs in Pagoda Street, ‘bak kwa’ (barbecued meat) in New Bridge Road or traditional Chinese medicine in South Bridge Road.

Chinatown is where Hindu temples and mosques sit right next to Chinese temples. Sri Mariamman Temple and Jamae Mosque are on South Bridge Road, as is the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple.

Best of all, there’s free Wi-Fi throughout the Chinatown area so you can continue to be plugged in while you sightsee, shop and eat."
,,Engaging and Educational,5.0,,I brought 43 ten and eleven year olds here because we were studying the effects of migration on Singapore. The kids were enthusiastic and learned a lot.
,,"A little bit rushed, but interesting nevertheless",4.0,,"The guide was hilarious. He spoke so fast, I had a little bit of trouble following him (I had to focus) but I could nonetheless. I didn't have enough time to explore every part of the centre even though the guided tour lasted 1,5 hour. The Centre provides an interesting view of the impoverished conditions the Chinese used to live in and how the area has transformed since that time. It wasn't cheap, the price was 20 dollars (16 without a guide)."
,,Excellent!!!,5.0,,"Everything about my tour was excellent. It was well worth it having the tour guide Clinton. He was knowledgeable, enthusiastic and personable! I highly recommend going here especially if you plan to visit Chinatown."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"This little museum in Chinatown, Singapore has undergone a complete refurbishment. There is now an audio guide which previously wasn't available. The Heritage centre gives a very clear picture of what life was like for people travelling from rural mainland China to Singapore looking for work. You are guided through the tailor's shop, the overcrowded shop houses, shared kitchens and the pharmacy. You learn what Chinatown was like in the old days....ie full of brothels and opium dens! It's extremely interesting and only ten dollars. Directly opposite is Chinatown Seafood. Great, casual restaurant with amazingly good food. Again, worth visiting."
,,A great learning experience!,5.0,,"I have passed by this place many times when visiting Chinatown, and did not go in because it has quite a hefty fee of $15 (Higher than other museums).
As a matter of fact, I believe that this is the best $15 I have spent on a museum. Each visitor is provided with a tablet with earpieces/headphones. Within the museum, there are about 3 floors with numbers next to the exhibitions. Basically, you just have to press the corresponding button, and a audio track will play. It is really, really effective. They mixed the sound and tone of voice with the environment setting perfectly, giving you the true feel of Chinatown."
,,Bringing early Singapore to life,5.0,,"These old shop houses in Chinatown are set up like they would have been furnished in the 1850s. The first level is the home of a tailor and his apprentices. In the same area in the second level 40 people lived, all sharing the same basic kitchen and bathroom. The audiovisual which accompanies the visit brings it sympathetically to life. The third level looks at other aspects of life at this time. There are plans to have the audiovisual cover this floor in the future.
This place has only reopened since January and some locals don't seem to know of it's existence. Don't be put off. It's well worth a visit."
,,Walk back in time -comes with the smell too,5.0,,"A visit to the Chinatown Heritage Centre is entering a time machine to 1950s Chinatown. See how a typical Chinatown shop house managed to contain many families from all walks of life: tailor, majie, rickshaw-pullers, clog makers, itinerary hawker, Chinese physician. And it comes with the ""fragrance"" of that period to boot. Best to buy a ticket with guide for your tour to get inside stories of the place."
,,Celebrating the history and people of Singapores Chinatown,5.0,,"This is a surprise, it's a museum recreating how Chinatown grew with migrants from China from the 18th centruy onwards.

I enjoyed the guide who hosted me through the three floors - explaining how people looked after themselves...how businesses thrived - people worked in all sorts of jobs.

In the shophouse museum over three floors -families lived and worked in small rooms. The owner of the building was a tailor...employing staff and apprentices... the owner had small room, maybe 3 metres square - where he and his wife plus children all lived...it was hard to imagine.

On the upperfloors other families lived in similar conditions.

Part of the tour shows how the area developed, work conditions outside - and how people survived to the Chinatown we know today.

Well recommened if you wander past in Pagoda street."
,,Well represented,5.0,,"Located about 50m from the exit of Chinatown MRT station, this museum on the people who once used to live in Chinatown is well represented. It has gone to great length to acquire many of the items that were once used by the people. The items on display are also done in the open and not behind glass. The media recorder guide is also interesting done though a little too lengthy at each area. Entrance fee is $15 per adult."
,,Intriguing glimpse into the early Chinese experience,5.0,,We visited the recently refurbished museum and had an intriguing and informative glimpse into the Chinese history of Singapore. The audio tour with individual stories of the Chinese workers and their living conditions was innovative and well executed. There was a lot of information provided and extensive coverage of every aspect of the Chinese experience. The old photos gave a good idea of living conditions and we learned so much and gained a deeper appreciation of the contribution made by the early settlers.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Oh man, Chinatown was something else, found a lovely bar on the corner with Smith Street where hubby had day care so that I could go mooching - it was superb. Loved the market and all the ' stuff' So want to go again"
,,Worthwhile visit,5.0,,We live in Hong Kong so were not keen to visit Chinatown! Our friends from UK persuaded us to go to the Heritage Centre and we are glad they did. The audio guides are very useful.
,,Definitely worth a visit !!!!,5.0,,"We stumbled upon the heritage centre after having arrived VERY jet lagged in to Singapore earlier in the morning. We went for a walk from our hotel to orientate ourselves and came across the museum (and it was air conditioned !!!) so decided to visit. The displays are all interactive, you're actually moving in & around them and the information is easily presented and tailored to all levels (even the 16yo teenage son enjoyed it !!) The staff are extremely friendly and available to answer any questions and the headphones/ electronic guide are included in the price and again presented exceptionally well !! If you are interesting in the history of Chinatown and want to also familiarise yourself with the area then I'd highly recommend a visit which should take about 1.5 hours on average :)"
,,Very interesting and realistic display of the lives of early Chinese immigrants in Singapore,4.0,,"The tickets (SGD 15 for adults) includes a mobile devices with audio tour guide (only English and Mandarin).

They let you to touch (not destroy) some of the exhibition materials.

The only thing to improve is I hope that they can quickly added the guided tour of the 3/F to the device."
,,Very Interesting,4.0,,Its amazing to see how people lived back in the day when Singapore was just developing. The entry isn't free but is worth seeing how they lived years ago. Very interesting.
,,"Six stars! So well done! Go, go, go if you want to understand Singapore's roots",5.0,,"This is a fantastically well-put-together set of exhibits that bring so much to life. You start with a tailor's shop and go upstairs to tenement-style rooms where the genuine artifacts and brilliantly-narrated audio guide combine to show you the daily experience of some of Singapore's poorest 19th-century and 20th-century immigrants. How any of them survived is a miracle when you eyeball the couple of metres a housefly would have to travel from the shared latrines to the cooking pots. The IMMENSE distance from these lifestyles to the rich leisure portrayed in the Peranakan Museum is so thought-provoking. There's a further history section upstairs with photos and movies that bring you through to the 1970s or so.

MUST put this on your Singapore list. I wouldn't bring very young children, but school age and up should find it fascinating too."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"We really enjoyed this museum with touchable artifacts arranged in rooms typical of 1950's shophouse. I have always been impressed with Singapore's development and integration of citizens of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, but seeing this museum adds the exclamation point to the progress. The commentary is excellent and gives such a pcture of life for some in Chinatown. How easy we have it now - I am in awe of those who lived and raised families in the circumstances shown. Remarkable people.

We spent nearly two hours and could have spent more time. We were there on a Sunday and the museum was busy, but not so crowded that we couldn't enjoy. I think next time, I will try for a week day.

Highly recommend to anyone interested in life in Chinatown in another era."
,,A fascinating insight into a very different way of life,5.0,,"Singapore has changed so much, so quickly, that it's easy to forget that life was very different for its inhabitants even sixty years ago. The Heritage Centre is beautifully designed to show what the first two floors of a typical shophouse would have looked like in the first half of the twentieth century, and the stellar audio guide walks you through daily life for the 50+ people who would have lived there. Cubicles that look as though they are meant for one person would house families of up to 8 people, or a rotating number of workers who would take turns sleeping and working to save money for rent. Not an easy life by any means. The third floor is laid out in the style of a more traditional museum and provides a wealth of information about the evolution of the district and the Chinese immigrants who settled in it. Not to be missed - educational, engaging, and excellent value for money."
,,Our top pick in Singapore. Must see it.,5.0,,"Reopened only in January 2016, this Chinatown Heritage Centre gives you an excellent appreciation of how much Singapore has changed since the 50s.
More insightful than what is presented at the Singapore National Museum which is more a statement of national identity and pride whereas this is a historical record, made up in part by individual testimony by people who were there.
Fascinating story of Chinese immigration, the developing communities (yes warts and all) and the impressive (no t's astounding) transformation that has been achieved by this city state in the space of 60 years.
You walk through a recreated tailors shop, work room and his living room (including toilet and bathroom). Upstairs you see the fully but sparsely furnished single boarding alcoves where whole families lived, then there's the opium dens, the Chinese secret societies and gang violence. It's all here and all narrated by an excellent commentary on audio sticks.
Then you emerge to one of the most orderly and safest cities in the world and can only marvel at the excellent governance that has transformed this nation.
The high spot of our visit to Singapore - it's that good!"
,,Wonderful Experience (But not recommended for those who hate history),5.0,,"An hour tour in this museum is marvellous. Inside, you can see the life of a carpenter, tailor and history in the 1930s in Chinatown. Besides, you may know more about the hardship and life difficulties (i.e. low salary, poor living condition, food rationing) of the Chinese back in the good old days which caused them to come to Singapore to work as a carpenter."
,,Back to roots,5.0,,"Being a local, I have not made adequate efforts to go round my own country. I happened to pass the Chinatown Heritage Centre and dropped in to see what is on offer, given that it was recently revamped. To my surprised, it was a very good effort to show what life was like when the early immigrants came to Singapore. I witnessed 1st hand many of the scenes shown at this site and can tell you if you want to know how Singapore transformed from 3rd world to 1st, go to this place to get your feel and facts. It is worth spending an hour or two at this centre to learn about the tough lives the early immigrants led to raise this modern metropolis."
,,Very interesting museum,5.0,,"We are not big museum goers but, this was wonderful. You go from room to room and listen to a tape that brings the house to life. You can imagine what it would be like to live there. You can see how the rich live only a little better than the poor. Learned so much from this museum. So glad we went. It took about 1 hour as we listened to all the commentary. You could pick and chose which rooms you listened to. If you have time and a good imagination, this is the place for you."
,,So much History in such a small museum,5.0,,This museum offers an amazing & touching display of what it was like for the Chinese that came to Singapore for the chance of a better life. DO NOT MISS IT.
,,A Walk Back in Time,5.0,,"WE thoroughly enjoyed this tour. Instead of using headphones, we paid and additional S$5 to have docents lead us. This museum is in a restored shop house and was a display of early Chinatown where entire families lived in 1 small room in a loft that was divided up into 8 small rooms. The docents were very knowledgeable and fun to tour with."
,,Origins of Singapore,5.0,,"Not to be missed, this museum has a modern nondescript frontage which in no way portrays what lies behind the facade. It is so unexciting that we nearly did not bother. Once you walk through the door into this museum you are transported into another world - one that some of us would find very hard to imagine. Very well done and the history and lives of the people that lived in this building is really brought to life."
,,Unique experience of both history and culture,5.0,,"The museum is housed in 3 authentically and lovingly restored shophouses right in the centre of Singapore's chinatown. It documents the lives and stories of early immigrants with re-creations of their cramped but creative interiors of homes-in-a-room.
The audio guide provided was helpful and insightful. Lots of multi-media, multi-sensorial and interactive displays in sections. Well-researched and a definite must-visit place in chinatown."
,,Re-discovering our Chinese roots,5.0,,"The exhibitions are are almost all done up and the authentic artifacts and accompanied commentaries really give visitors a good insight on how the immigrants lived in the past.

Great place to bring the kids so that they learn through the sights and sounds and sounds."
,,The History of the Straits Chinese,5.0,,I was'nt prepared for how interesting this little museum wss going to be. The history of the Chinese immigrants to Singapore and the hard lives that they endured was very moving. It is certainly not to be missed when in Chinatown.
,,Eye opener on Rich history of Chinatown,5.0,,"Being a senior Singaporean of 60 years , I was given free entry to the centre. Never regret going for I now know the heritage of Chinatown in Singapore . Go for the guided tour as the guide was really good.( but is quite long). Also the exhibit include sensory ""smell"" example we can smell the "" medication"" and "" pastry"" . There is a lift hidden at the back for those who can't climb stairs.
Highly recommend to people who wants to know the history of Singapore Chinatown."
,,PERENAKAN HISTORY IN SINGAPORE,5.0,,"In the middle of Chinatown is the museum, its only a few dollars entrance fee and well worth the money. You could easily spend a couple of hours looking at all the exhibits which portrays how people worked ate and lived. Everything appears authentic."
,,Not to Be Missed!,5.0,,"The Chinatown Heritage Centre should NOT BE MISSED. It is housed in a beautiful Shophouse. Here you will be transported back in time. You will be able to see how the Chinese lived before.

Forgot to check the ticket price since it was included in our tour. There are 2 choices a guided tour or a tour with a multimedia unit."
,,"If you only visit one museum, make it this one",5.0,,This is a fantastic visitor attraction in the heart of Chinatown. An audio tour (included in the price) is available and really adds to the experience. One of the best museums of this kind I've been in. Don't miss it!
,,Must visit attraction in Chinatown,5.0,,"In my opinion one of the best places I have visited in all my travels. The centre chronicles the early days of Chinese settlers in colonial Singapore via a walking tour through 3 floors with use of a tablet & headphones included in the entrance price- narrative is detailed, precise & at times humorous & touching. Being a Malaysian born Chinese myself, i found it highly informative & highly revealing."
,,A Glimpse Into Singapore's Past,3.0,,The Chinatown Heritage Centre is a new tourist attraction in Chinatown.The Centre occupies a row of old shop houses along Pagoda Street.Visitors to the centre can have a glimpse of Singapore's past.Personally I found the heritage centre floor area small and cramped with too many exhibits.The stair case connecting the floors are narrow and this may pose a problem for the elderly.Best time to visit the centre is when there are no crowds inside.The centre's opening hours are from 9.00am till 8.00pm daily ( closed on the 1st Monday of every month ).Admission charges for adults are S$15 ( with a MMG audio player to explain exhibits ) and S$20 for a guided tour.Entry to the centre is free for Singaporeans and permanent residents aged 60 & above till 31 July 2016
,,So interesting,4.0,,Interactive history of Chinatown with audio tour and thoughtful displays. Really enjoyed it. Visited for one hour before lunch in Chinatown!!
,,Interesting Museum,4.0,,"Interesting place for those who wish to know about Chinese culture and the way chinese used to live earlier.
Not much for Asian tourist who are more or less familiar and have similar culture.
If you have free time and willing to spend $$ then can spend an hour and half here."
,,Excellent little museum,4.0,,"A Singaporean friend brought me here, I nearly walked straight past, distracted by the chinz of the Chinese St Market. Gave wonderful insight into the journey y the Chinese immigrants made in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The audio guide was sufficient, I wouldn't recommend a guided tour."
,,Slight disappointment after revamp,4.0,,Honestly my expectations are higher..the display gallery at entrance is not so customer friendly as it is the place to purchase tickets and souvenirs.while i want to take a second look at the handicrafts visitors keep coming in to buy tickets... the staircase has too many steps for elderly.there is a lift but only after visitors visited three levels and for coming down only..maybe the centre should open the lifts to seniors and those with leg problems to encourage people to come in.it displays the old chinatown the people and the lifestyles.an insight to our old generation lifes..however the rooms look too alike and maybe more variety should be added in to attract more visitors.
,,"Just revamped, nice tour",4.0,,"The new set up only opened on Jan 28. S$15 to go in and do an audio tour in this authentic 3 floor building. Will not take more than an hour, but it is interesting to get a glance of history and feel how the Chinese lived until a few decades ago, amazing. Well done!"
,,very interesting,4.0,,"Dropped in here, CNY, to learn a tad and see how the chinese did it. If you want to learn about another culture, this is the place to start. Watch out for the low-step just outside the entrance! It's a real trip :-)"
,,Provides a Great History of Chinatown,4.0,,The entry fee is S$15 per adult which includes an audio tour. The museum is set out on three floors and illustrates how individual Chinese lived in a shophouse as well as a wider history of Chinatown. Well worth a visit
,,Outstanding audio tour/museum recreates life in a Singapore Shophouse c.1950,5.0,,"This newly reopened heritage center is located in an old shophouse (commerce on first floor front, residential quarters at back and on second and third floors), where many Chinese immigrants gained a foothold in Singapore in the late 19th and 20th centuries. The recreated tailor's shop, family quarters, shared kitchens and bathrooms, and people's stories reminded me of The Tenement Museum in New York City's Lower East Side, where conditions were not much better at the turn of the 20th century. The audio guide is exceptionally good."
,,"Small, Informative, Worth your time, Nice Staff",5.0,,"I really enjoyed this place. The staff was very nice, and the exhibits were very informative. I spent over an hour and was drawn in to looking at/reading all the exhibits learning the story of the Chinese immigrants to Singapore. Very good English and Chinese language explanations to everything. They only downside I had was I could not get the audio guide they gave me to work."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"Not a large exhibition, but the recorded commentary was really good. It was humbling to understand how people had lived in squalor but made the most of it. You'll never complain about stress again after you visit here, realising what a modern conceit 21st century stress is!

Nicely air conditioned so it provides some relief from the heat outside."
,,Great little museum tucked away in Chinatown,5.0,,"We visited by chance at first thinking that this was just a tourist information centre. It turned out to be the 2nd day of opening after an extensive refurbishment programme so the staff were very excited and keen to speak to visitors. Much of the museum is given over to recreating the cubicle living of early 20C Chinatown. Each 8 x 4 metre cubicle recreates the living space of different families, shops and trades. Unlike many such museums you can enter a number of the cubicles and sit on chairs to the in the scene guided by the very good guide book issued with your ticket. The topmost floor of this 3 floor museum tells the tale of the Chinese migration to Singapore in the 19th and 20th century and the development of modern Singapore in the late 20thC. It takes a good couple of hours to take the tour of the museum and it is a rich and informative experience. Highly recommended"
,,Not all that impressed.,3.0,,"Decent effort to showcase migrant Chinese culture in Singapore. Not very big, but rather informative. As a tourist, I'd rather you explore Chinatown's streets as they are"
,,not good,3.0,,I think in singapour is more beautifull things than it but in compare this with same in Maleysia I'm sure that it couldn't compare really it's so much better
,,Closed till end 2015,3.0,,Apparently very good. Some of the website links advised this was open and even hotel concierge also said it was. Regrettably on arriving the centre is closed till end 2015.
,,Tiny museum,3.0,,The museum is located At Chinatown MRT ST exit A. It's only 1 mins walk from the exit. I find its too small.
,,Do not miss,5.0,,"Anyone visiting Singapore must go to Chinatown. Between the great antique shopping, fantastic food and amazing atmosphere - you could almost - almost think you are in China."
,,Chilli carb,5.0,,"worth walking around, the streets around and short and narrow and gives you a feel like you are in china. best and cheap chilli carb in town. the taste and rates here is much better than clarke quay."
,,A very interesting 'museum' depicting life in early Singapore.,4.0,,When in Chinatown you won't be disappointed if you visit this attraction. It is in Pagoda St almost opposite the Chinatown Seafood restaurant where you will probably choose to enjoy a refreshing bottle of Tiger beer! There is an entrance fee.
,,Another place closed for refurbishment,1.0,,This place was closed for refurbishment just like the National Museum and the Battle Box. Finding things that are closed has now become the family holiday competition. Actually it's quite easy because as long as the venue is not a shop or restaurant it's almost bound to be closed or have some part closed.
,,Good to visit,4.0,,"Very near to SMRT Chinatown, this is a small shop having all the old historic items. You may like to purchage some entique items or souvenier"
,,A Place where Time just Stopped.,3.0,,"A very small shop house that houses lots of old historic items that were used by the pioneers when they first came to Singapore from China. Sam Swee women, Coolies... you name it."
,,You Won't Miss this When In Chinatown,3.0,,The Chinatown Heritage Center is just a short walk from the MRT Chinatown Station. It is located along the busy Pagoda street and surrounded by different shops. It is worth a few minutes of your time since you can combine a quick visit here with your shopping.
,,A beautiful trip,4.0,,This area is definitely worth a trip during the day. Walking around this area there are many things to see and enjoy.
,,Close for renovations,4.0,,The heritage are close for renovations and will be reopen the second half of 2015 when we went there.
,,Not open until later this year,3.0,,I was staying in chinatown and was interested in visiting the centre but found that it was not open and won't be until later this year
,,Great Walking Tour,5.0,,"The Heritage Centre, 48 Pagoda Road is actually closed until April 2015, but is used as the starting point for a very good FREE walking tour which we found advertised in the HiPPO brochure. The tour of Chinatown runs on Monday, Wednesday, Friday from 2.30 to 5pm. It is free but you can give a tip at the end (but you are not obliged to do so). Our guide Bernard is a Singapore born Chinese, who was brought up in Chinatown. He gave us lots of information about how the area developed and how the locals lived. We learnt about Chinese customs and foods - all relevant as it was Chinese New Year. It was so much more interesting than walking around the area on our own. I can thoroughly recommend this walk. There is also a similar walk around Little India on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday from 10.30 to 1pm starting from main entrance of The Verge shopping centre."
,,Throwback time,5.0,,This was a pleasant throwback and tribute to our Chinese ancestors who worked so hard to eke a living in their chosen country. I was transported to my grandmother's digs in that bygone era. Great memories!
,,Renovations,2.0,,my husband and I would have liked to have gone but it was closed for renovations and reopening some time in 2015.
,,Your visit to Singapore is incomplete without a trip to this place!,5.0,,"This place will help you understand why Singapore is the way it is today. Why the people are so proud about their nation. Why everything is so clean and orderly.

After 7 days of seeing all the glitz and glamour of Singapore, we walked into the heritage center in Chinatown, What we saw there was a recreation of the life that early migrants lived. Their struggles and misery are realistically depicted by recreating the sort of rooms and shops that existed in those days. The artifacts are also real and collected from the descendants of these original residents.

To understand Singapore you must visit this place."
,,Closed for renovation,2.0,,This place is closed for renovation until some time in 2015. But you can still get a taste of Chinatown by walking down Pagoda street and soaking up the atmosphere.
,,under renovation,2.0,,its situated on china town street...but its under renovation until January 2015. but the street has lot of shopping one can do for souvenirs.. a place you must bargain
,,Great History,4.0,,"Great history of the China town as it was established in Singapore. The migration, the merchants and way people lived. It is scheduled for upgrades, so it may be closed for a while."
,,Definitely Worth A Visit,4.0,,"If you're interested in learning about the history of Singapore - and especially the role of Chinese immigrants in Singapore. My husband and I were interested - and we learned a lot.

BTW - it's free. No admission charge. So I'm not sure what people who are talking about admission charges are talking about."
,,Historic and quaint- really interesting,4.0,,Historic and quaint- well worth a visit to the China Town Museum. I knew nothing of the history of Chinese migrants to Singapore and it was fascinating to learn what life was like for them. It was also a welcome relief to get out of the heat. We got 10% off the $20 price with our hop on hop off bus tickets.
,,Great museum but closing for renovation,5.0,,"This is in 3 shophouses in Chinatown. It is very informative. Our kids were amazed at the living conditions and learned a lot. Sadly, the centre was closing for renovation. Hopefully when it reopens it won't be too sterile and modernised. It was great as it was."
,,Food Street and Cheap Souvenirs,5.0,,"Cleaner and not so hot anymore. Like to shops here. The food are delicious, and tasty. Try the roasted duck rice for 5 SGD."
,,excellent place to learn about early china town in singapore,5.0,,The heritage centre is located within china town and depicts the history of china town in singapore. It has some great exhibits. My favourites were the replica homes within the building. They really showed how people lived years ago. The units were true to size and filled as they would have been. The stories of the actual people who had lived their added to the sense of history. I would highly recommend a visit. You will not be disappointed.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,While exploring China Town we came across this museum and were pleasantly surprised. The displays gave a good idea of how China Town developed. Well worth a visit.
,,Chinatown,5.0,,I found this very interesting and bought quite a number of books on Singapores Chinese heritage as well as some lovely souvenirs.
,,Chinatown spirit,5.0,,"Went to the Food Street and there are a huge crowd waiting to grab some foods.
So many stalls selling items you can bring home as a souvenirs but I didn't manage to buy any. I was here during the night and it was crowded in my opinion."
,,Vintage Singapore,4.0,,"Nice little museum in the heart of Chinatown telling the story of the Chinese immigrants who now form such a large part of Singaporian Society. The kids (and us) were fascinated walking through the second half of the museum which had been turned into a chophouse back in the 1940/50s, it was amazing to see how people lived, in such cramped conditions. Had to laugh at my five year old who was amazed by the old phone and couldn't put it down to leave. Worth a wander through."
,,One visit to 3 popular attractions,4.0,,"Tourists visiting Singapore can enjoy and see more tourist attractions if you know how.
There is a place where one can visit 3 scenic spots within one morning/afternoon.
After touring chinatown heritage centre, take a slow 5 minutes walk to the beautiful and colourful Sri Mariamma Temple, thereafter a 10 minutes walk to the Buddha Tooth museum and temple complex where you can learn the rich history of chinese culture etc
Going about is fairly easy, imagine the whole chinatown scenic area as a large Square with New Bridge Road (east), South Bridge Road (west), Upper Cross Street (north) and Sago Street (south).
The Chinatown Heritage Centre is in the middle, the India temple at its North corner and the Chinese Temple at the South end. Using your bearing, just follow the one way street-South Bridge Road where the two temples are situated. You can spend about 3 hours at these interesting attractions. Admissions are FREE
Going to and returning to hotel is easy, buses, taxi and MRT are easily available"
,,Excellent historical collection/exhibition,5.0,,Totally loved it! The displays are extremely well presented - and contain personal accounts from people who were there. The exhibits are exceptional and give you a really good feel for how life might have been like.
,,Excellent glimpse into Chinese history in Singapore,5.0,,"Tucked away in Chinatown is this treasure of a museum. For SGD10 you can access two connected buildings, each with 3 floors of shop-houses, where Chinese immigrants plied their wares. Seeing tiny rooms where families of 10 people lived makes you appreciate the space modern homes have. Each room and shop house is decorated authentically, and gives an excellent glimpse into the life of immigrants."
,,Very similar to Temple street HK,4.0,,"Very similar to Temple street HK, not too much things to do. No surprise. I went there to buy chinese medication only. Nothing gets here."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"And while you are here, have a really good look around Chinatown in general and around every corner there is something interesting. Eat at a hawker centre, if you want some real local colour."
,,Must go if u interested in history.,5.0,,"Info board, pics, documentary videos, sound effect etc enable u to relive the Chinese ancestors' life in singapura from multiple dimensions.."
,,A place to buy suveniors and all...,4.0,,"Quite good and place that may be visited , can be reached very easily , it self it is having a MRT station "" China Town"""
,,very interesting,4.0,,we have traveled with Singapore stopover holiday and this is included in the package. it is very interesting to know the history and stories of what people experienced before and how Chinatown was built. there were few visitors so it is good if you would like to take more time to browse everything.
,,A very worthwhile visit,5.0,,"A really interesting museum. I liked the accounts from real people, as opposed to a researcher putting their findings across. The displays were good, lighting good, information fascinating. The mock up shop houses were amazing, you could imagine how awfully cramped and hot conditions were back then. Well worth a visit. Think the entrance fee was $10. Downside - the museum was very hot. Food and drink were available in the cafe next door, which is part of the museum."
,,"Chinatown, Chinatown",4.0,,We like the display and photographs - very realistic. Many of the articles are things that our grand parents uses. This is probably the only place you could see how an old Chinatown shop house looked like in the 1950s. The other shop houses have retained their outward facade but their internals have been gutted out. Worth a visit.
,,Perfect Stop in Chinatown,5.0,,"We ended up just stopping here to beat the heat for a little while, but ended up loving it! The museum only takes about an hour to go through, but it definitely holds your interest. We went around 11:30 on a Friday, and the place was practically empty! Most certainly worth the $10 entrance fee!"
,,Taste of Classical Singapore,3.0,,Chinatown heritage center provides a unique experience and that is one of the few places where the urban redevelopment hasn’t taken place. The buildings and Shop houses brings you a classical feel in you and it’s an ideal place for shopping souvenir and great food in eat street
,,Singapore Crab,5.0,,Tried the crab here for the first time recently. My partner and I ordered both pepper and chilli crabs. Pepper crab in particular was excellent. Friendly staff and a fixed price for the crab make this a great place to check out. We only ordered one dish each and found the service to be very good.
,,Great Restaurant!,5.0,,We didn't go into the museum but the restaurant out front is excellent! It may not be quite as cheap as a market meal but to enjoy excellent cuisine accompanied by a bottle of wine while watching the colourful parade of people passing by is an unforgettable experience. Our favourite - the smoked duck steak - melt in your mouth tender and full of flavour.
,,Informative museum about Chinese settlers in Singapore,4.0,,"Located in the heart of Chinatown at 48 Pagoda Street, this museum gives an excellent portrayal of the rigours that the early Chinese settlers faced both on the hazardous journey from mainland China to Singapore and the subsequent basic living conditions which had to be endured once they reached what they initially felt was going to be Utopia. The exhibits are housed in several converted shop houses and visitors are left with an excellent understanding of this important part of Singapore's history. The exhibition is on three levels but for the walking impaired a lift is available. The website suggests that the opening hours are 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. but it would be unwise to arrive before 9.15 a.m. Tickets are S$10 for adults. and S$5 for children"
,,Good little musuem,4.0,,"Went durig a visit to Chinatown. Its not the biggest musuem, but it gives an you a great look into the history of the area, with authentic possessions etc. of former residents. Might not be great for kids, as mostly just displays and information. Spent about an hour looking at everything. For the price (S$10) it is definitely worthwhile!"
,,Fantastic display,5.0,,"A truly unique heritage display in china town. Shows it as it was for the Chinese settlers in Singapore, with actual artefacts showing living,working,recreation and family life. This multi level centre is well worth a visit. I have now visited 3 times and what is more the restaurant over the road has great food, crabs in season, and cold beer . A true gem."
,,Fascinating and Authentic Displays,5.0,,"I stumbled across this museum on a visit to Chinatown, so it was unexpected. The displays were informative and mostly well designed. Some of the technology was a little clunky, but I found the personal stories that were related via video projections to be quite moving. After the explanations of the history of Chinese immigration and culture in Singapore the highlight definitely is the recreation on the three story shophouse. It gives you a real feel for what life was like, much more than traditional museums, which can be quite impersonal. This really was like walking through someone's house. Definitely worth the $10 entry fee."
,,Not worth to visit,1.0,,"I do not think this place is worth the $10 entrance fee.

1. Dark, hot and gloomy.

2. You can see the actual stuff in current day Chinatown! Why pay to see the mock up when you can see and taste the real thing?

3. Really small place. You may spend a long time if you read all the notice/info boards. But this is too boring... Nothing engaging or informative."
,,What a contrast to the rest of Chinatown!,4.0,,"I decided to visit this museum on a rainy day. It took a little over an hour to go through everything. The first part of the museum was interesting but I preferred the second part, which showed the conditions of cubicle living. I was lucky to visit soon after they opened, as I was the only one there for the first hour."
,,Most interesting and revealing,4.0,,"Yes Singapore has a past !
Showing and revealing the history of Singapore in the 18 and 19th century, the major impact of Chinese immigrants who suffered, struggled, and help to build the roots of this modern city state.
Displays are authentic, and one can learn quite a lot about the life conditions at that time.
Definitely worth a visit !"
,,a bit rushed at times,3.0,,"Interesting information on Chinatown in an old tailors shop.some parts,such as Japanese occupation a bit rushed.however the addition price of 10 singapore dollars is a bit on the high side.it only took half an hour to go round."
,,A good travel through history,4.0,,"This was an amazing museum located in the heart of Chinatown! It gave an insight to Singapore that isn't readily made available. Definitely worth a visit! The only downside is that if busy, can be hard to read the information."
,,Actually a restaurant,5.0,,"Delicious food at very good prices. Take a seat facing the walkway to watch the world go by as you eat. And leave time for shopping at the many nearby stalls for anything Chinese - fans, chopsticks, kimonos and so on."
,,Fascinating,5.0,,I loved learning about life in 18 and 19 century Singapore and found the displays very authentic. My 13 and 11 yo also found it interesting. It was an hour very well spent.
,,Nice Surprise in the heart of Chinatown,5.0,,"This museum is definitely worth the visit if you are planning a trip to Chinatown. The outside of this museum did not seem much but I ended up spending 2 hours inside. Located within 3 shophouses, they have recreated the living and working conditions of the early migrants from China to Singapore during the early 50-60s. The exhibits are very interesting, informative and detailed. Admission is $10 for adults and well-worth the $."
,,Do not miss the chance to step back in time!,5.0,,"This understated living museum offers the chance to fully immerse yourself in the hard living experiences endured by Chinese immigrants to Singapore. Located in the heart of Chinatown, very close to the MRT station, this small museum is set out over 3 floors. 2 floors are dedicated living history floors, set out as the the shop houses and cubicles people of differing trades would have occupied in the past. The top floor offers more information about the history of local streets and interesting exhibits. The entry price to this place is very reasonable and it is an absolutely must see in Chinatown. Forget the National Museum and come here!"
,,A step back in time...,5.0,,Most people whizz through in a few minutes – I spent a happy hour reading every label and trying to imagine how the former residents felt and coped living in such cramped conditions …. A little shabby and not all the video displays worked but very atmospheric. It was also interesting to peer through the shutters at the modern bustling Chinatown outside for contrast.There is a free Chinatown tour starting from here at 2.30pm – it takes two and a half hours. I didn't have time to do it but it seemed to visit all the good spots. This building is not tricky to find - if you come by MRT just use the Pagoda St exit - it's right there amongst all the tourist tat shops!
,,Authentic Building,4.0,,"The building is hard to find with no outstanding street signage. If you aren't interested in history or how people lived this isn't the place for you. It has good information in English and some good set-ups of the living arrangements of the Chinese population in early Singapore. It's quite well aid out, sets the atmosphere well and naturally leads you through the exhibits. It includes the warts not just the success story of Chinese in Singapore. Outlines the Chinese settlement well. I visited because it was free under my 2 day pass."
,,Just misses being outstanding,4.0,,"This is a place with tremendous atmosphere - the thought of whole families living in those minute cubicles was amazing, and the stories of some of the residents of shophouses in the past was deeply thought-provoking. I wouldn't want to find this museum radically changed next time I visit Singapore, but what it badly needs is better signage and (even better) audio-guides. Just make sure to keep the dust and dim lighting - the atmosphere is almost unbearably perfect."
,,What a surprise,5.0,,"This ""museum"" doesn't look promising from the outside and we visited it because it was ""free"" with our 2 day City sightseeing pass. However, it was great--some very interesting displays, lots of good information in English and Chinese about the history of Chinese in Singapore, and a design that channels one easily through the past and present. After you visit, then enjoy a beer and some roast skewers at one of the many sidewalk restaurants in the area."
,,Good old building conversion,5.0,,It is a little hard to find from the street as there are no obvious signs but once found it is a very atmospheric recreation of the early life of Chinese immigrants in Singapore. Being in an authentic building helps and is especially poignant when you realise it used to be an opium den. You get a very clear picture of how far Singapore has come in quite a short time.
,,Not unless you have a passion for history,2.0,,"I like history but found the wander around the steep staircases of the museum to be pretty boring in general. If you have a passion for Singaporean culture then do visit, otherwise save yourself $10."
,,Historically interesting,4.0,,If you're interested in understanding the Chinese aspect of the culture of Singapore then this place is for you! There's a lot to learn here and it perhaps isn't visited as much as it deserves to be! Some little bits are a bit naff but you won't leave without having learnt something!
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Located very near Chinatown MRT (only 2-3min walk), it is a hidden gem. Actually not that hidden, we found it quite easily. Entrance was SGD10 for adult and SGD6 for kids. Quite a small place, thankfully fully air conditioned so time for us to cool off. Three levels of interesting stuff for us to go through. One got to see it to understand what the earlier generation went thru. All in all, highly recommended. Displays come with explanation in both Chinese and English. After that, we went for superb dimsum at Yum Cha (literally drink tea in Cantonese, aka tea time) restaurant. Yummy!!!"
,,Interesting place to visit,4.0,,It was good to have an English description of the displays in the museum. It was well laid out and easy to go through. The displays showed the early history's of Chinese in Singapore. It how a house would be set out. Well worth a visit.
,,interesting history,3.0,,stop by here if you are in chinatown to leanr a little about what happened when the chinese got to singapore and how they went about their lives. the good and the bad. i found it to be quite interiesting.
,,Fascinating and well set up,5.0,,"An easy to miss gem in amongst the hustle and bustle of Chinatown. Small entry fee but worthwhile for the volume of info you get as well as the well laid out route, ending in the traditional shophouses. Well thought out and beautifully laid out. Recommended."
,,Nice.... Not a must do list,3.0,,"It a small museum about the early straggle of Chinese immigrant in Singapore, the museum is equip with few short video, personal belonging, artifact and props. It nice but i will recommend to visit the national museum instead with the same 10 sg dollar entrance fee."
,,A look into the life of the local Chinese,4.0,,This centre is made up of two parts - one OK - the other brilliant. The first part - above the centre entrance - is made up of galleries depicting the history and life and times of the Chinese immigrants who came to Singapore. These exhibits are not very professional and somewhat haphazard with the information. But then you cross over to the adjacent building where you get to actually look into a very realistic set up of actual workers lives. The front of the shop house was a tailors but behind it was room after room that housed many families from all walks of life. The resilience of these people despite being crowded into such small spaces is amazing. Fantastic to be able to almost experience what their life was like
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"This museum is so interesting especially since it's housed in such an unassuming building. I enjoyed learning about how the Chinese came to Singapore and their living conditions at the time, which were horrible and so hard. Well worth a visit and I'd recommend."
,,Nice place to visit,5.0,,The Heritage Center is right in the middle of Chinatown and is not to be missed. I try to visit a museum whenever I am in a different country and the Heritage Center was a great decision. The details were awesome. I learned so much about Singapore.
,,Awesome tourguide,5.0,,"Yesterday (monday) me and my friend joined Bernard (the tourguide) on the citywalk around Chinatown. It was absolute lovely. Very interesting and not boring at all. Not a dull moment. During the tour we got the change to eat some delicious chicken rice at a hawker centre, was nice. So thank you again and keep up the good work!"
,,A Chinatown gem,4.0,,"Interesting and well laid out museum close to Chinatown MRT.
Considerable thought has been put into the displays and these provide a view into both old-old and old-recent Singapore. The displays give a very human face to what must have been a hard life in migrant Singapore for overseas Chinese.
Definitely worth a visit for anyone interested in authentic Singapore history and as the locals say,
""Then policemen wore shorts"""
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Great little place to visit to occupy an hour. There was a $10 entrance fee which we felt was reasonable. The exhibit itself is fascinating. The building has been maintained very well. There are some parts that could do with a little gluing back together, but we didn't mind. It is very authentic and the displays have been preserved very well. There are numerous photos and videos of the immigrants speaking about their experiences, which adds to the authenticity of the place. It is amazing to look inside all those little rooms (which still look as they were) and read the plaques beside them that say who lived in there...

If you are not confident with stairs, there is a lift available."
,,Chinese origins and culture and early Singapore: Beyond the touristy trinkets,4.0,,"This is an interesting museum if you have no understanding of the origins of the Chinese in Singapore. The museum is in the heart of Chinatown - look for the rickshaw at the front, and a few metres from the Chinatown MRT stop. The $10 entry fee is just OK. Some of the displays are looking a little tired and good do with a clean and some glue - but overall this provides a good sense of life, its challenges and some customs that still dominate Singapore today. There is a lift for those who will have trouble going up and down the stairs. There are some very steep stairs at the end of the tour - suggest if you are a bit unsteady on your feet to back down using the lift. Photography allowed. Fairly interactive - the children visiting when I was there seemed engaged."
,,Singapore from the Chinese viewpoint,4.0,,"This display and presentation over 3 floors is extremely interesting. It starts with the Chinese coolies coming from Hong Kong and rural China to find work and their fortune and the trials and tribulations that they were subject to. The poor living conditions, the brothels, the gangs, the subsistence pay and on to the shop houses of WW2 and even up to the 1960's. The display was well done and it had many videos of older Chinese relating their experiences and life. There was one old lady (about 90 when the video was made) who described how she worked as a builder's labourer in her early days, and described the Japanese occupation, etc. When the Government gave her a new flat in later life she couldn't bear to leave the hovel where she had spent most of her life.
It is well worth the small admission fee."
,,Showcasing the Chinatown shophouses during WWII,5.0,,"If you have the knowledge about Chinatown Singapore, you will still see something of value, especially the homes of Chinatown shophouses, very unflattering living conditions in the older days (during WWII and some years after), very dirty and crowded living spaces, you hear a lot of Cantonese conversations. You see the sins and the harsh life of many Chinese immigrants, many are hooked on opium and gambling, and paying a visit to the brothels among many younger Chinese coolies. You see many Singaporean Chinese love the Chinese opera, movie going, reading Kong Kong based magazines and listening to Rediffusion. Not too expensive for S$10 admission fee, considering it is indoors and fully air-conditioned, the management certainly made a great effort in putting up the exhibits, such as the videos, the models and the lighting effects. This place has a lift to allow wheelchair bound visitors, otherwise visitors are only allowed to use the stairs. Just follow the red arrow stickers pasted on the floor to see how to go around the place. It is a 4 level building, only the bottom 3 levels are open to the visitors.
There is a gift shop at level 1."
,,"Good exhibits, a little over-priced",3.0,,The museum covers some interesting and not so flattering aspects of the history of Chinatown and Singapore. The exhibits are fairly well-done but in my opinion it was not worth the $10 as I already knew a good proportion of the information. But if this interest you or you get free entry through something or another then go for it.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Filled with information and there is a section with interviews. Loved the display/replica at the end of the house of actual homes. It is air-conditioned so great in the middle of the day and surrounded by restaurants for lunch. At S$10 felt it was amazing value. Bathroom is not stunning.
,,"Somewhat eerie, but a good slice of history",3.0,,"We had free entry to several museums with the Singapore Pass and decided to pay a visit to the Chinatown Heritage Centre. After visiting a lot of glitz and glamour in Singapore, this was a humbling experience, if somewhat eerie place to visit. I was with my pre-schooler and she was a little spooked, it is dimly lit inside and there are large old photos of hungry, sad looking children on the walls in one part, and cocaine addicted early settlers (if you read the plaques on the wall you will learn a lot). It is like going back in time and seeing some of the hardship of the early Chinese settlers. If you are into history and finding out more about the realities of the past, this place is worth a visit. I would have spent more time here if I'd been by myself."
,,Excellent and informative museum about Chinatown,5.0,,"It could be very easy to miss this museum since it is located among the market storefronts on Pagoda Street. The museum consists of several floors of exhibits outlining the experience of the Chinese who arrived in Singapore and made Chinatown their home. Many of the testimonials are extremely moving, as are several of the physical exhibits, especially those about the opium dens and a recreation of the cubicle tenements that once existed on that site. It is hard to believe that entire families lived in such cramped quarters. Overall, it's definitely worth a visit while in Singapore."
,,Excellent glimpse back in time,4.0,,"This small museum recreates the world of the Chinese immigrants to Singapore. Most interesting were the recreations of their living quarters where whole families lived in a single tiny room. The museum isn't very visible from the street, but is well worth finding for an hour's visit when you are in Chinatown."
,,d good old days,1.0,,"a sight that is very common to asia but is now just a history to singapore. it still exist on some parts of asia, still living that way and using those century old methods"
,,Way better than expected and glad I visited.,5.0,,"I had a free ticket pass as part of the Singapore Pass and I was debating whether to go or not.
Well worth it and much better than I thought it would be.
The layout and story told details Singapore in years gone by for the Chinese migrants who arrived. There are lots of different stories, quotes, anecdotes and pictures over a number if floors in this place. All these detail Singapore life, what they worked at, their challenges etc. There are also some excellent reconstructions of the types of accommodation various professions inhabited such as a tailor, poor family, opium den, barber etc

Well worth a visit if you are I retested in history and learning."
,,Chinese Culture in Singapore,5.0,,Excellent presentation of the history of Singapore and SE Asia. Very informative in the heart of Chinatown. Get some culture while you shop for trinkets and grab a yummy snack or meal washed down by a cold Tiger beer in Singapore humidity.
,,nothing to see here.,3.0,,"The Good =)
~Nice theme-ed attraction.
~Best suited for non-Chinese who want to know more about the Chinese.

The Bad =(
~Quite expensive for an attraction that only can be covered in 1 hour.

My Tip for future visits:
~Save the money & skip this attraction."
,,Worth A Visit,4.0,,If you want to learn a little about the history of Singapore this centre is well worth a visit. Located in the middle of China Town and a short walk from the MRT it's easy to get to. Loved it. Would definitely visit again.
,,True Grit,5.0,,"Recognisable by their red hats the statue of a Samsui Woman out the front of the centre commemorates the contribution these women made to Singaporean society. Originally from Guangdong Provence in China they came to Singapore from the 1820s until the late 1940s. They were independent, unmarried, self supporting, hardworking women seeking a better life, who rather than opt for a living in vice, worked at menial jobs which were often heavy and hard; many of these jobs were in construction.
The building where the centre is housed used to be a shopfront but was also a doss house that had over 100 people living within its walls. It’s a rather small space for so many people. It has been kept as a living museum, so visitors can really understand just how cramped and unsanitary the conditions were in Chinatown in the “golden days” of the 1950s.
Having paid for my ticket (Sing$10.00, excellent value), I started my journey in to a world that I found fascinating and informative. Suspended from the ceiling, where you buy the tickets, are a number of photos. These people’s comments are on the walls, as you work your way through the centre, giving you and insight into what it was like to leave their homes, the perilous journeys they travelled, the strangeness of a new place and the comfort of having supporting communities on arrival, the dangers of prostitution, opium and gambling and everyday living. Along the way there are rooms that show different slices of different people’s lives, culminating in the cubicles that families or groups of people lived in and the amenities/ablutions they all shared.
This is a gritty look at just how tough life was for these people, the words are thought provoking, the surroundings appalling but in all this there are moments of optimism. What a wonderful display of human tenacity. Thank you to whoever thought of this centre, to those who shared their possessions and thoughts and to the staff that have made it a reality. A visit here is a truly humbling experience."
,,Shadows of yesteryears,4.0,,"If you want a place with great air-conditioning, clean, airy, bright and shiny, than this is not it. Balancing the actual historical conditions without making it too stuffy, creepy, dingy, hot, humid and unbearable is the challenge here. When we visited, we were the only visitors. However, in those days, entire families shared one room. Parents may sleep on the bed whilst the rest of the brood of at least half a dozen will have to sleep on the floor. Several families will have to wait in line for the kitchen and toilet. This is the living condition of the real founders of Singapore who migrated from South China and it is good to find a place preserved, not glamorized to remind us of them."
,,Absorb the heritage,4.0,,"A small museum tucked in amongst the restaurants and shops of the vibrant Chinatown district. Not overly impressive at first, but take the time to read all the displays and before long I really felt I had gone back in time to peak into the lives of the Chinese in Singapore. Authentic and worth the look."
,,Soak up the history of Chinese Singapore,5.0,,"We struck lucky as we hadn't planned to go into the Chinatown Heritage Centre and stumbled upon it by chance. Very glad we did, as this is very well thought-out exhibit, full of personal stories which bring the history of old Chinatown to life. The galleries mix traditional artefact displays with hands-on areas, multimedia presentations, images and narrative clips that bring out the struggles and successes of the Chinese migrants who came to Singapore to make a new life. The re-creation of Shophouse living is very well thought presented and gives a real feeling for life in the cramped, spartan conditions. Informative and moving, and well worth the $10 entry fee."
,,Like going backwards by time machine.,4.0,,Like steps into the old time. Interesting and look so real for who's interested in cultural and historical.
,,Visit the captivating Chinatown Heritage Centre,4.0,,"The Chinatown Heritage Centre opens daily from 9.00am-8.00pm (last admission 7.00pm), it costs $10.00 per adult and $6.00 per child. The quickest and cheapest way to get there is on the simple and reasonable MRT, the nearest stop is Chinatown and it’s a short stroll from there.

Bang in the centre of Chinatown the centre does a fantastic job of recreating the original interiors of it's shop houses and tenents in the 1950’s, the colourful past of Chinatown comes alive within these walls of three beautifully restored shop houses along Pagoda Street.

The Chinatown Heritage Centre is full to the brim of memories and untold stories of yesteryear. You will witness the desperate hope of many migrants risking life and limb to embark on an arduous journey from various Chinese provinces to the promised land od Singapore, to the raw, seedy and underground practices of gambling, opium smoking, prostitution and secret societies. You will also experience the tough times making ends meet, see the hardships many of them faced and the tough lives they had to lead- this museum is very nostalgic as you step through Chinatown’s history.

The museum probably takes 1-2 hours to explore either by yourself or with a guide; it is very visual and very suitable for children keeping them interested. Try and combine your visit with the free walking tour of Chinatown, which is available at 2.00pm Monday-Saturday. This can be joined outside the museum and it is on this tour you will discover the hidden secrets of this district where the early Chinese migrants resided.

This museum is very interesting and should be visited if you are interested in Singapore’s cultural history."
,,Appreciate,5.0,,"This small museum i give 5 star, Singapore is the one i guess how to make all things gonna be wonderful.. Sometimes teenage like me didnt go to somewhere just enter to museum, but Singapore make it tourism circle and if u go chinatown eye-catching to enter this place especially ""becak"" in front of museum ..."
,,Time travel,5.0,,"One really gets a feel of what the lives of the early immigrants were like, how many families stayed in one building, how one tiny room accommodated a family of 4! Authentic artefacts and furnishings. The perfect complement to this is this really cool app I downloaded for free on my iPad (think can it can be download on iPhone 4 and 5 too) named WISH - Walking Into Singapore History. It shows a 3-D panoramic view of what some streets of Chinatown looked like in the past with unpaved roads, vibrant hawker scene etc. Quite amazing how the area has changed."
,,Worth the time to see!,4.0,,"This little museum was a truly fascinating look at what life must have been like over a fairly long slice of Singapore history. Includes videos capturing the stories of Chinatown old times and vignettes of actual living, working and retail spaces set up to look just like they must have at the time. Don't miss it!"
,,Informative and a great way to learn about Chinatown in Singapore,4.0,,"This place was an interesting look at how Chinatown changed through the ages, and the living conditions of its residents. It is well worth popping in - takes about 1hr / 1.5hrs and admission is cheap."
,,"Great exhibit, but not well air conditioned",4.0,,"A few complete view of early Chinese in Singapore, with models, videos, and a complete kitchen and tailor shop. Don't go when it's very hot; there's no A/C in most rooms."
,,Fascinating history lession,5.0,,The museum show a side i Singapore being replaced with steel and glass structures. It gives a great perspective on the transformation of the City State. Very much worth the trip. Getting to the museum is also an experience
,,"Hear, see and feel Chinatown's history",5.0,,"The Chinatown Heritage Centre is located in three restored traditional shophouses on Pagoda Street and offers an insight into the history of Singapore's early Chinese migrants by the way of personal stories, pictures, sound and video recordings as well as historical artefacts.

It offers background information on why Chinese migrants left their hometowns with little belongings to seek a better life in Singapore, how they travelled and what they typically did upon arrival. It explains how Chinatown was ‘divided’ between Chinese migrants from different provinces and how various clan associations came to play a vital role in the lives of migrants.

One floor recreates the house’s former cramped living quarters and shows how different Chinese migrants (e.g. a tailor, a food stall owner, a group of coolies) inhabited their rooms. The fact that the centre has no a/c serves as a timely reminder of just how humid and stuffy these spaces must have been.

Without romanticizing and with meticulous attention to detail the centre demonstrates that life in Chinatown was not an easy one back in those days. The living conditions were basic; kitchens were shared only and there were no toilets or running water (water was in fact still delivered from the river by bullock-drawn carts). Bone-crushing work, debt, poverty and diseases were common and many a hopeful migrant ended up seeking solace in opium smoking, gambling or prostitution; all evils which were often controlled by secret societies or triads. The sick and elderly typically spent their final hours in death houses.

It’s not all doom and gloom though. There’ s plenty of success stories about local businesses – some that still exist in third or fourth generation – and trades as well as about the establishment of an vibrant arts and cultural scene (e.g. Chinese opera, festivals).

Highly recommended! You will walk through Chinatown with a new awareness after spending an hour or two at the Chinatown Heritage Centre."
,,Very Sweet!,4.0,,"This is quite small and a bit tucked away amongst the shops and stalls in China Town. The air conditioning wasn't working and there was building work going on when we visited but the man on the desk explained all of this prior to us going in. I'm glad we did go in, although small and querky it was really interesting and each area was set up really well that it gave a real feel of what life was like for the Chinese coming into Singapore as immigrants. The way everything was displayed and the whole experience was atmospheric and thought provoking. I really enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone even those who would normally avoid museums, don't avoid this one!"
,,Very educational,4.0,,The whole area is interesting and educational. I learned a lot just by looking around and absorbing the atmosphere. Will definitely return because I was not able to look around as long as I wanted to during my first visit.
,,Great location,5.0,,"We had a great night at the restaurant . Fist up on a hot night where 2 local beers ,cold and cheap. We didn't have the chilli crab,but what we had a pot stew and bamboo curry. Fantastic Good value"
,,fascinating,5.0,,This doesn't look like much from the outside but it's instructive and fascinating. It includes some history of Chinese immigration to Singapore but the real drawing card is the cubicles - living spaces - that are furnished as they were at different times in the past. It is as close as one can get to visiting the past. An altogether unexpected treat.
,,Feels Like You're in Another Dimension,5.0,,"...that's exactly how I felt when I was inside the museum. It had the authentic Chinese atmosphere, made possible by the how the entire place was set up. Visual and audio effects were also present which made it more convincing.
I really had no interest in the Chinese history in Singapore, but visiting the place made me learn so much about them that I learned to appreciate the people and their history.
While it is not free, the learning that you will get is so much more than what you expected the first time you step into the place."
,,unique and well set up,4.0,,"it is a slice of life that once was, three shop houses, showing the way the area was only four decades ago. very unique and pleasant, worth a tourists visit."
,,Interesting bit of history,4.0,,"This is a good place to go to enjoy and experience a little bit of history !

There is a lot to see and will take about 1 hour to do the whole tour

If history is what you are after, Ita definitely worth a visit !"
,,Surprise!,4.0,,"Always vibrant, busy, never sleeps, non stop surprises and very local south east Asian Chinese flavour that you don't get in Fujian or Guangzhou or Hainan."
,,A slice of history!,4.0,,"I liked this place because it allowed me to learn much of Singapore history I hadn't read about yet, and to get visual images of those things I had already read. To see pictures of the opium houses, the crowded streets, and the way people lived so many years ago, was a great journey through history."
,,This is really worth a visit to give you an idea of how the area has developed.,5.0,,This place you could easily walk past but is worth going inside. It is very well laid out and is a very good visual experience of how Chinatown came about and how it has changed over the years.
,,Heart of Chinatown!,4.0,,This is a great place to see potted Chinatown history. After your visit - you must go to the multi-story Chinatown food center.
,,An interesting Heritage Centre,4.0,,"This heritage centre is located in the China Town and contains several floors. If you are those visitors who would like to learn about the life of early immigrant to Singapore, then it is a good place to visit as you will see a lot of items which in display are hard to find anywhere right now, from cookwares to sewing machines. The centre has also installed TV screen with videos so that you can learn more about each display section. A lot of visitors provided feedbacks that they are appreciated their current modern life after the visit."
,,Very interesting,4.0,,Good way to spend an hour or two when in Chinatown - the museum takes you through the history of the immigrants when they settled in Singapore and the conditions they endured. Some fascinating reconstructions of living quarters and conditions. S$10 entry fee.
,,Chinatown as a living experience and not just tourism,5.0,,"Singapore's Chinatown is clearly a tourist attraction but it still has many residents and a local community. Amongst the many shops selling tourist rubbish and restaurants, it is easy to miss this great exhibition about the origins and the conditions of people living here in the 19th and early 20th century. Three typical houses have been knocked into one to make a very interesting display of living and working conditions in the area. Do stop here for a while it is much more interesting inside than you might guess from the outside and well worth the $10 SGD admission."
,,Nice place,3.0,,Nice place to visit. you will be provided with some historical information how the Chinese came to Sg...
,,An excellent insight to early Singapore,5.0,,"This is without doubt the best exhibition of early Chinese migration we have ever seen. Housed in adjoining ""Shop Houses"" the display is well organised and follows a natural progression that is easy to appreciate. The interactive displays are first class and the filmed displays were particularly good. Having lived in Singapore in the 60's I found the visit most enjoyable, the exhibits relating to that period were like being there all over again."
,,Chinese traditions,4.0,,Our family loves visiting museums to learn the rich history of a place. although this museum is small but you can learn about the cultural heritage brought about by the Chinese in this land. Worth a visit.
,,Ni Hao Wow,5.0,,"When you next wander down Pagoda street, to visit this small museum set in a triple shop house complex half way down the street from the MRT. Every corner is fascinating. You really travel back. You experience the incredible hardships of the Chinese who emigrated from China, undertaking voyages of incredible hardship, to find a better life.
Not all of them made it. View the sections of opium dens and wonder how and why people could live like this? And then ask yourself why the British encouraged its use. Interesting stuff.
Look at the tiny and cramped conditions under which many lived and ask yourself, how can?
They have recreated the original interiors of the old shophouse sand the conditions under which so many had to live. And it’s not all ancient history. Slavery was not abolished when they said it was. It was replaced by indentured labour. Now they have maids. Nothing really changes.
This place will make you think.
For me, three visits and counting."
,,well worth a visit,5.0,,"This museum is right in the middle of Chinatown in Pagoda street. It is on 3 levels over 2 narrow building s. There are elevators if the stairs are too much. It goes from first forced migration to present day. There are videos that come on and you can sit and see and hear their stories of life growing up in Singapore. The rooms showing how they actually lived, cooked and ran businesses if amazing. It cost S$10 each to get in and was well worth it. My only negative thought arose once we were outside and talking to the various shopkeepers, stall holders and restaurant staff nearby. They had never been in there to see their own culture on display! I think it makes good business sense to offer free or reduced entry to all the nearby workers who can then give the museum free positive recommendations to the tourists to go and investigate something they may have walked right past."
,,Surprisingly powerful display of Chinese History,5.0,,"What I loved about this unprepossessing Museum was the way it displayed the realism of life for those early Chinese immigrants. You cannot but be affected by seeing the living and working conditions of these incredibly brave people. The Museum is located in the heart of Chinatown quite near the night markets and if your not looking for it, it is easily missed. Entry costs $10 Singapore, and it's probably the best $10 you'll spend there because it gives Singapore a completely perspective. The pulsing vibrant modern city that surrounds you came from such humble beginnings. Don't miss this, particularly if this is your first visit to Singapore. It puts everything else into context."
,,Great little museum,5.0,,The admission was SG$10 per adult. We entirely enjoyed our time in this little museum which is in the middle of Chinatown. Very interesting stories from early Chinese settlers. Makes you realize how much Singapore has changed in past 50 years.
,,Do not miss,4.0,,"So few places genuine places left in Singapore, the heritage center give you a very clear picture of the hardship people had arriving in Singapore 100 years ago."
,,Chilli crab and people watching,4.0,,"I used to bring all my visitors here to try the chilli crab as its really flavoursome but not too spicy, but now I go there with my local friends too since its so good. I love to sit on the outside tables with my $6 beer and people watch the tourists mingling with the locals. Try 'There's something Indian about Singpore' their version of a prawn cocktail but with a twist. If you make friends with the staff they might let you ring the big bell!"
,,"A must see, to appreciate the development of Singapore",5.0,,"If you come to Singapore now, you see a top developed city with all luxuries and excellent infrastructure. Was not always like that, and the heritage centre gives you a first hand impression of the hardships of several decades ago. We always take our visitors from overseas to make them appreciate even more the progress of this city."
,,Touching tour of difficult times,5.0,,"We combined this with our Baba House visit, though we needed a taxi between them in the monsoon conditions. This is a museum of stories and artefacts detailing the harsh conditions which faced incoming Chinese migrants largely in 19th and even 20th centuries. The story boards are very evocative and the cell-like nature of the accommodation is in stark contrast to the Baba House. You can almost smell how awful it must have been. Then again out you come afterwards into prosperous Singapore and it is a bit of an emotional roller-coaster! So interesting in the 21st century."
,,Interesting History of Chinese in Singapore,4.0,,"While wandering through Chinatown, we came upon the heritage center and decided to check in out. What we found was an interesting display on the history of Chinese immigration and life styles in Singapore spread out over two floors on two different buildings. As people of Chinese origin are about 70% of Singapore's population, the museum is very relevant to anyone interested in the history of Singapore. What was particularly interesting in the museum was the re-creation of the living quarters of the various types of immigrants. It really put in perspective the hardships that people went through in order to try to obtain a better life. The museum is definitely worth an hour or so of your time if you have an interest in the history of Singapore."
,,One of the best museums in Singapore,5.0,,"Situated in a shophouse, it was a really authentic experience. It's a wonderful place to understand more of the Chinese culture and what Singapore was like. Even though from the outside it looks tiny, it's a great place to bring friends who come from overseas. I am always awed by the richness of such a small place."
,,So glad we decided to visit!,4.0,,"Visiting this museum was so worth it. A very moving experience where you can really put yourself into the shoes of the Chinese immigrants. So much better than your average ""state"" museum."
,,History,3.0,,Good excuse to walk around a remnant of old Singapore. Very good little museum with an excellent insight to the difficulties and determination of early Singaporeans. Well worth a visit.
,,highly recommendable,5.0,,"This 'museum' was recommended to us by the tourist information. It was definetly worth going there: a really nice display, description, explantion of Chinatwons history and detailed descriptions of the life of some inhabitants. Really recommendable."
,,Great for a time out,5.0,,Lovely atmosphere and food - I always stop here for a tea and a snack to watch the world go by. Enjoy!
,,Great effort to make you travel back the past,5.0,,"At first, I am hesitated to buy the SGD$10 ticket because even the much bigger Asian Civilization Museum costs fewer (SGD$9). But later I realize it is so worth the price. They replicate a living house of the old times, not only the objects, but also the conversation. As a Cantonese, I can understand what the conversation is and it is really lively and authentic. They put effort in details to make you really feel like going back to past.

They have a free guided tour at 1pm, it's worth joining and get a picture of the museum before looking into details afterwards."
,,A good insight,4.0,,"We spent a rainy afternoon here, exploring and learning about what it was like for Chinese immigrants who came to Singapore. It was a well laid out and informative mini museum, and the highlight was definitely the lifesize replica of the old shophouses. Worth a visit to understand the Singapore of old."
,,Excellent insight into the history of Chinatown,5.0,,"This is such an interesting museum! Set in busy Pagoda Street it would be easy to wander past and miss it. The recreation of the living conditions of the residents of these shophouses, and their personal stories was such an insight and made it a very moving experience. I recommend this museum to anyone who wishes to gain a deeper appreciation and understanding of this area of Singapore."
,,Great museum well worth a visit,5.0,,Brilliant museum and very educational to learn more about the Chinese heritage. Set in the heart of Chinatown. Lovely staff. Very moving in parts especially to see how they lived and coped in the most cramped spaces. Very well done indeed and gives you an eye into a different world and time.
,,Really a must see,5.0,,"For anyone wishing to get an insight into how Singapore came about and who the early settlers were and how they lived, must visit the Heritage Centre. It is extremely well conceived and promotes a very emotive environment within the old shop houses from which it has been created. The composition of the exhibts is very good and the complete story of early Singapore is nicely presented."
,,Educational &fascinating,5.0,,"A wonderful afternoon spent learning about Chinese settlement in Singapore. I came away feeling like I wanted to know more. The displays told the stories of Chinese/Singaporeans beautifully. Following the journey from their need to leave China to make a living and support their families, to the challenges they faced being in a new country with so many different cultures, you really get a sense of a different time and place.

I was amazed at the replica cubicles that showed how people used to live. Seeing is definitely believing. Highly recommend it - worth the $10SGD. FYI - it is hot inside the Centre."
,,Wonderful History Lesson,4.0,,Right in the heart of Chinatown. Wonderful pictures and history of Singapore and Chinatown. Make sure you grab a cold Tiger beer at the restaurant before starting your amazing shopping experience.
,,OK...but something missing this time,3.0,,"I think this visit to the area was overshadowed by having to use the public toilets and finding what would have been the most horrendous toilets Ive ever had to use in my life.
We had previously been here and it has more vibe and feeling to the area. This time it was a little lacking."
,,"Great museum, worth a visit",5.0,,"A great way to get some insight into the history of Singapore and it's people. It really is a window into a past life. It has been very well thought out, very informative and visually appealing. The museum would interest young and old, and is well worth a visit."
,,chinatown heritage centre,3.0,,it has a lot of old things and has a lot of information about japanese times.it look like you was travelling a time machine back then.
,,My favourite memory of Singapore!,5.0,,"A fabulously human and intimate museum, full of personal stories. Gives a real sense of the sights and sounds of Chinatown as it would have been. An absolute must to visit - only wish we could have spent more time there."
,,Gives the visitor a pretty good idea of living conditions endured by early Chinese immigrants,4.0,,"We got discounted admission tickets at S $ 6 each after we showed them our Duck & Hippo 1 day City Sightseeing Tour receipt.

If there is any institution in Singapore which tells the story of the hardships and triumphs suffered by Chinese immigrants in search of a better life, this place is it (not even the famous Asian Civilizations Museum or National Museum comes close).

The interior is intentionally made dark and foreboding to allow the visitor a first hand experience of what life was like for early Chinese settlers, and the slummy and inhuman conditions they endured. Even the rough hewn wooden stairways, recorded ambient sounds/conversations add to the authenticity of the experience. You'll also find short biographies of various notable individuals scattered throughout the museum as well.

Nothing is sugar coated, the center shows the good, as well as the evils that plagued Singaporean Chinese society then (opium, gambling, prostitution, clan/gang wars) as well as the hellish slave ship like passage from China to Singapore.

At the time of our visit, there were no guides available, so you'll have to explore the place on your own.

Note: The infirm/elderly should exercise care going down the uneven stairs (part of the simulation). While there is a posted notice stating the latter may call staff for an alternate route between levels, I did not notice any intercom there to contact them.

The (actual) toilets were also a somewhat filthy, and there only seemed to be two of them (men & women's) on the ground floor.

This attraction is also close to the Sri Mariamman Temple and the Chinatown MRT."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"History was well preserved and displayed here. There seemed to be a lot of spirit and soul in the Chinese immigrants. Looking at the stories and displays, we got a really good idea of what daily life was like back in the day and how immigrants sacrificed and strived to make a better life."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Lots of well presented displays with personal stories - in historic context - of Chinese people who came to - and helped build - Singapore. Fascinating place to spend a couple of hours, especially if you're caught in the rain or want a break from the souvenir stalls."
,,Fabulous little museum if you like to see things as they were! Great for a rainy day trip!,5.0,,We went here on a very wet day for something to do indoors and weren't disappointed! There is a full size original Chinatown townhouse which I was fascinated by!
,,‘Sinkhehs’ to rooted Singaporeans – an epic journey,4.0,,"Inaugurated in mid 2002, the Chinatown Heritage Centre (CHC) located at 48, Pagoda Street does not seem to attract as many visitors as one might have thought. That is rather a pity, since CHC offers a poignant yet brutally honest look at Chinatown’s history – a journey back in time to when the undaunted ‘sinkheh’ (migrants) risked everything, their lives included, journeying from China to the promised land of Singapore.

Harking back to the 1950s, CHC has faithfully recreated the lives of these migrants who lived in the rented cubicles of shop houses. It offers unvarnished insight into the poverty, disease and abysmal living conditions, the frenzied search to try and find new roots in an alien land, of the migrants seeking relief from their hard lives in the four evils of opium smoking, prostitution, gambling and drinking.

CHC showcases the brighter side too of Chinatown as a place where festivals were celebrated with traditional revelry, the cuisine was unmatched and the nights came alive even as the days never ended. CHC takes you on a journey peppered with coolies, samsui women and rickshaw pullers, a saga that spans the initial hopelessness and despair to the fulfillment of no longer being sinkhehs but rooted Singaporeans. It is an uplifting story of trials, tribulations, hopes, joys and hard won success – of a brave, enterprising people who came to earn some money and return to their homeland but who then stayed and made this foreign land their home.

CHC is open daily from 9am to 8pm and the adult entry ticket is S$ 10. The simplest way to get here is by MRT – alighting at the Chinatown MRT station. CHC is housed in three restored shophouses, spread over three levels. The galleries and exhibits on each level offer silent, eloquent testimony to different periods of Chinatown’s history and the life and times of its residents.

Level 1 explains the harsh circumstances in their homeland that triggered the flow of migrants to Nanyang the promised land, where there was work to be found and food to eat. This section also describes the perilous journey from China to Si Lat Po (Singapore). Depending on the weather it could take weeks or even months to make the journey and many never made it through alive. This floor also has a reproduction of a tailor’s quarters including his workshop and the shop where he met his customers to conduct his business.

Level 2 with appropriately dimly lit galleries and exhibits speaks of the migrants’ arrival at Singapore followed by the squalor of their daily lives in the dismal, cramped rented cubicles of shophouses. The horrors of sharing insanely crowded living quarters, common toilets and kitchens. (This section includes a true to life recreation of cubicle living) It also describes how they sought kinship in clan associations (based on dialects, surnames, occupations, provinces of origin) in a bid to create a home away from home. It also tells the sad story of how many succumbed to the allure of the secret societies and fell prey to the four evils of brothels, opium smoking, drinking and gambling. The raw recreation of a seedy, dingy gambling and liquor den here makes cold fingers run down one’s spine.

Level 3 is a welcome contrast showcasing the bright and colourful “golden years” of Chinatown, where the days never ended and the nights were always young. This section highlights the food (including an authentic replica of a tea house), the culture and the festivals which kept Chinatown buzzing all day and all night. The noise and bustle of restaurants serving dim sum, hawkers peddling food served as the backdrop to the migrants settling down in their new home, once again embracing their age old beliefs, superstitions, ancestor worship. On a more sober note, on this level you can hear the life stories of a samsui woman, a hawker, a dessert seller, a seamstress and a tailor.

TIPS:

1. To get a more comprehensive picture of the galleries and exhibits on show, it is extremely useful to pick up a copy of the CHC Visitor Guide before you start your visit. You are expected to return this Visitor Guide once you are done with your visit.

2. Mobile phones are to be put on silent mode and are not to be used within CHC. Smoking, consumption of food and beverages is not allowed within CHC.

3. Flash photography within CHC is not permitted. Video with handheld cameras is allowed."
,,Real piece of history,4.0,,"When we first went in I was not overly impressed but as we progressed through the museum and I understood what they were doing I was entranced.
The museum is not easy to spot as the entrance is in between cafes and stalls. The entrance fee is 10$ per person.

It is an original shop house and tells the story of the people who lived and worked there. Some of the stories are very moving and helped me appreciate how hard life was for most of the Chinese that came to Singapore.

There is a mixture of original artefacts and videos of people telling their stories.

Well worth a visit"
,,Woooowww.......,4.0,,"All type of heritage do you want to see, from kicthen stuff, picture,clothes, jades,etc...."
,,Quick lesson on Singapore China Town History,5.0,,This is the bwst place to learn about the history of chinatown
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"for the locals, nothing beats going through the historical buildings through memory lanes of our grandparents than being retold in foreign languages in an airconditioned room.
But it may serve as a good lecture for the tourists on the history behind the area. 90% of the them on display you will never see anymore due to the rapid growth of the city. Sad fact..."
,,Fascinating and well-thought out,5.0,,This was a great museum that presented the right balance of history and modern Chinatown as well as information vs. display. I took a docent tour and the guide was excellent both for the indoor and the outdoor tour.
,,Chinatown heritage centre,5.0,,coool ! many different n interesting things to check it out.
,,Very well laid out,4.0,,Fascinating but poorly lit for an old girl like me who has to wear reading glasses! Very interesting particularly the old town house set up. Well done!
,,The founding of Chinatown,5.0,,Faces of Chinatown a very interesting concept on how people lived and died at the beginning of the formation of Chinatown people lived and worked in such crampted conditions it is a wonder any survived. I always like to see the History of the place I am at and was not disappointed. Well woth the visit.
,,Very well done,4.0,,Highly informative and well constructed with use of video interviews with residents and plenty of old photos and completely reconstructed scenes from early Chinatown. Should not be missed.
,,Not the same,3.0,,"Why they call it China Town Heritage Center, looks like someone has emptied their garage into a room."
,,China Town history in 30mint,5.0,,We enjoyed visiting this place. Very small but interesting and quite a lot to learn
,,"Looks small on the outside, but inside's a boon!",4.0,,"Our school organised a field trip to the Chinatown Heritage Centre to allow us to learn more about Chinatown's history and heritage. The centre is located in a small but busy late of Chinatown, and seems like a shop. However, there's much more that meets the eye in this replica of the past.

The Chinatown Heritage Centre starts off with showing the various features of Chinese immigrants who migrated to Singapore during the 19th and early 20th century. There are a number of exhibits that explains the characteristics of Chinese immigrants and the culture that surrounds them.

Thereafter comes an explanation of the layout of Chinatown, located on the 3rd storey. The last stop is a replica of the shophouse, taking the other half of the building, which shows the quarters of various Chinese immigrants, how they live, and the facilities in the shophouse at the time.

The CHC is definitely essential when visiting Chinatown to explore its culture. However, the price is somewhat high for a museum - $10 for an adult and $6 for a child as of now. Thankfully, there are many ""passes"" that allow people to purchase a package and includes admission fees of several centres. I'm not sure of the effectiveness of such passes, but it will be useful in saving money for those in Singapore for two to three days.

Bottom line, Chinatown Heritage Centre is an interesting facet of our past that has been brought to life, and is definitely a must-go for first-timers. Just be wary of the prices."
,,"Simple, informative, small",3.0,,Overall quite an informative place. Nicely done up with lots of exhibits. Could do better with a bigger space
,,The Chinese in Singapore,4.0,,This museum gave a good look at what the Chinese people who came to Singapore went through to get here and what they did and did not find once they were here.
,,Another Good Place to See Images of Historic Singapore,4.0,,"The Heritage Center in China town is located in the heart of China Town and is a great way to see images of historic Singapore. One can see how this Global city used to be and a lot about the culture of the Chinese immigrants that is still a big part of Singapore today. One can learn about the culture, food, festivals and a glimpse of life in the past"
,,An enriching experience,5.0,,"I love how everything is cheap and fun place to visit, especially if I've never been to Asia before. The shops was overstuffed and full of useless but fun (and cheap) stuff. From necklaces to status, from purse to pens. Chinatown is a fun places to dig around. It is so convinient to find both food courts and sit-down in the Market. And many places of worship."
,,"It's a ""centre""",1.0,,What can I tell you - it's staged. All the original stuff was cleared out of the area long ago.... now it's all for tourists and even that's all staged. There are much better Chinatowns elsewhere in the world.
,,Interesting glimpse into the hard life of the immigrants,5.0,,"I've been wanting to go to this little musuem for years, and we finally did it on this trip. It's a small museum, will take you maybe an hour to go through, but well worth the time. It give you a glimpse at what life was like for the Chineese immigrants. It actually shows you 7 or 8 of the homes that were crammed into that exact location and tells you about the families that lived there. Really interesting."
,,A glimpse into the early immigrants life,4.0,,"This museum offers a glimpse into the early life of immigrants from China. Chinatown was also a place of Chinese community back then. To know more about the history of Singapore, one can go to this place for a look."
,,Fascinating and well worth a visit,5.0,,"This is an excellent museum based in a line of old shop houses. The history of the Chinese immigrants to Singapore is well presented and one gets a real feel of the appalling conditions they suffered. The four evils that the Chinese in Singapore feel they have faced up to and overcome are opium (drugs), gambling, prostitution and gang culture. The Museum also poses the question of progress and what one might have to lose in the process. Very thought provoking. There is a lift for those with mobility problems.
Sadly no relevant books or postcards to buy in the shop area and taking photos was forbidden."
,,Interesting Place,3.0,,An interesting place where you'll see the hardship and perseverance of the early Chinese immigrants. But it's a bit creepy for me. Worth the visit if you have the Singapore Pass (since it is included) but if you're not the history/culture buff you can pass this one and just spend more time in Singapore Botanic Garden.
,,Authentic recreation of living conditions,5.0,,"Very well maintained and excellent use of multimedia to tell the story of the early Chinese immigrants to Singapore. It is housed in adjoining preserved houses where were typical of the houses those immigrants stayed in and thus, is able to recreate the houses and rooms accurately, giving a realistic feel."
,,A great insite to Chinese in Singapore,5.0,,An aircon oasis with well laid out stories in an old shop house. Great how the lift well is decorated with artefacts.
,,Small but worthwhile,5.0,,"This was the cultural site I enjoyed most in Singapore. Chinatown itself is fairly hokey but this little centre, telling the story of Chinese immigration to Singapore over a century or so, is quite powerful. The conditions from which the immigrants fled, their difficulties on arrival, the “four evils” tempting them once they arrived (gambling, prostitution, alcohol and opium) are mentioned but the most effective exhibits are the tiny, dark, often windowless spaces where families lived. Some of these are recreated from living memories. Imagining the crowded lives in these spaces provides a worthwhile contrast to the relentless acquirement of tourist tat going on outside."
,,Great launching point for day in Chinatown,4.0,,"This museum is put together well, using multimedia and physical displays to give you a great glimpse into the history and life of Chinatown. Will take about an hour if you take your time and perhaps longer if you watch all the various movies and read the stories. Good thing to do when it rains or to get a break from the sun or crowds. They do a great job of recreating actual living spaces for various trades so you leave with a new appreciation for the hardships, dreams and successes of this small part of singapore. It will cost you 10 Singapore dollars, or about 7 US dollars."
,,"New hope, hard life.",4.0,,"The Chinese Heritage Centre is half way down Pagoda Street, very easy to find and well worth the price of admission. Set on 3 floors in an old traditional style house of the times the centre offers a history of early immigrants to Singapore. The displays are static with recorded video messages dispersed on each floor from older generation Chinese of their memories. There is a lift to take you up to each floor but on the final floor take the stairs back which will lead you to some interesting room simulations."
,,A indepth experience with the Centre's tour guide,4.0,,"Asked the Heritage Centre for a in-house tour guide to be assigned for our tour inside.

Knew that it would be more interesting to have a personalised kind of tour even when I am local..Haha..

My guide was a Indian girl instead of a Chinese Singaporean so it is abit out of track when we were hearing her introducing to us inside the Chinatown Heritage Centre. But it is still good enough because she knows the facts well.

You can actually see how the Chinese immigrants' kind of lifestyle when they came to Singapore in the olden days. Some of the things they used are still able to see today in Chinatown or in grandparents' house.

Even for a local, it is good to have a refresh of history in this place!"
,,Good display of historical items and memorabilia,3.0,,Shophouse accomm recreated - must have been terribly hard conditions. Interesting.
,,Eye opener,5.0,,A great look at early times in Singapore and the amazing struggles endured through to the 70's
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,This museum tells the story of the Chinese immigrants who came to Singapore to find work in the early days of the colony
,,An hour well spent!,4.0,,"The Chinatown Heritage Centre, located in the heart of Chinatown on Pagoda St, offers a unique look at the history of Chinatown and the living conditions of the former residents. Like many of the reviewers, my favorite portion of the museum was the second half which showcased the living quarters of the former residents of the shophouse.

The Centre occupies a 3 story shophouse and is split into two halves. You walk up one half visiting exhibits that document the trip from China to Singapore and the early history of Chinatown. Going down the second half you discover the living quarters and the restored tailor shophouse on the first floor.

At only $10 for an adult ticket, the price is well worth the admission. The view you get into the area's history is unique and not replicated elsewhere in Singapore. A trip to the museum takes about an hour.

The 3rd floor didn't seem to have any air conditioning, so come earlier in the day to avoid the heat, although you likely won't spend enough time up there for it to be a problem. A trip to the museum takes about an hour. While the museum does have an elevator to service the upper floors some areas of the museum are a bit narrow and may be difficult to enter in a wheelchair."
,,Glimpse into Singapore's Past,5.0,,Great little museum that gives you a feel for what it was like for Chinese migrants. All the items have been donated by residents helping to recreate what life was like. I thought the best part was the recreation of the living quarters in the shophouse. One of the best.
,,Fantastic!,4.0,,"This was a fascinating museum. More than simply galleries of objects on display, this museum recreates what life was like for Chinese inhabitants of Singapore at the turn of the century. I learned more here about the real history of Singapore than anywhere else. It was one of the most worthwhile things to do in the country. It is very easy to find in Chinatown, affordable, and takes only 45 mins to an hour to visit the entire museum."
,,Great museum in Chinatown,5.0,,"This is a small, well laid out museum in the heart of Singapore's Chinatown. Tells the compelling story of how Singapore came to be a majority Chinese city, and uses first person accounts very effectively. If you've been to the Lower East Side Tenement Museum in NYC, this is similar and as well-done. Allow an hour to see it, and enjoy the great restaurants on all sides afterward!"
,,Unmissable!,5.0,,"To gain a valuable insight into the history of the Chinese in Singapore, as well as the multiracial nature of that particular area, you can do no better than visit the Chinatown Heritage Centre. From the earliest times, certain sectors of the Chinese population were coming over to Singapore to work on construction sites, as tailors, as barbers, as maids...This museum tells you all about the lives they expected to lead and the lives they actually led. I want to highlight two particular parts of the museum - the video section where people tell you their histories, which is absolutely fascinating especially to us social scientists, and the basement, which is set out as part of a building where several families lived. You will not believe the size of these 'cubicles' housing maybe seven people - I will never complain about the size of my house again! The other bonus is that this museum is in Pagoda Street, which is an excellent place for souvenir shopping! Don't let this museum pass you by."
