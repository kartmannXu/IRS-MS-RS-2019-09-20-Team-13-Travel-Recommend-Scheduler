,,"Facinating Structure, Especially At Night",4.0,,"This structure is based on the Helix spiral. As built it feels light and open, there are no usual heavy structural members as the helix acts as a truss holding itself up. Only possible negative is that it is an open structure and provides no shade on a hot sunny day.

The lighting at night further enhances the helix effect.

Must visit."
,,Stylish Spiral design,5.0,,"Helix Bridge – unique spiral design, very stylish & trendy. Cool canopies provide shade for pedestrians crossing the bridge. Panoramic views, Marina Bay Sands hotel and Shoppes are at the start of the bridge, linking it across the bay; Singapore Flyer is on the other side. I have gait/walking challenges (stroke), all sightseeing has to be well-researched and not overly taxing; I wear a legbrace. Quite easy walking, bring water & hat, wear comfy shoes if going on long walks in the sun. Come evening - stunning Helix bridge is lit up, with the rest of Marina Bay, is spectacular. Worth visiting."
,,A nice design & easy walk between Flyer & Marina Bay,4.0,,"We enjoyed walking over the Helix Bridge after visiting the Flyer on our way to the Marina Bay Sands.

,,Cool views from a bridge,4.0,,"Honestly... its a bridge. Beautifully designed, free to walk on, allows you to walk over water and it links to land masses. We did it and so can you.

There is also a cool soccer pitch right on the water.

,,Walk across the bridge at night,5.0,,"The design of the Helix Bridge is impressive but the best time to see it is at night when it is all lit up. Crossing the bridge will bring you to the ArtScience Museum, Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Gardens by the Bay. If you have just visited Gadrens by the Bay at night then consider walking across the bridge round to Merlion Park and getting some truly spectacular views of Marina Bay and the Merlion and Financial District skyscrapers.

,,"A nice promenade... ditch the MRT, ditch GRAB, ditch the cabs.",4.0,,"Yes, we have walked from Marina Bay Sands through the Helix Bridge to the Esplanade, pass One Fullerton and around the Marina Bay back to the Marina Bay Shoppes. It was a nice pleasant walk. Find out where to rent the electronic step scooters if you really can't see yourself walking it ;)."
,,Bridge,4.0,,"Don’t you just love bridges?! This one was nice pedestrian only bridge. The whole city is filled with beautiful buildings and bridges. Cross it, go under the bridge, and just explore..."

,,Unique Bridge Design,4.0,,The bridge was opened in 2010 and links the Marina Centre with the Marina South. Its designed as a series of spirals with canopies made of fritted-glass and perforated steel mesh providing shade for pedestrians. There are four viewing platforms included in the design. Great views. Pass by after dark and it is transformed by the lighting that is incorporated in the structure.
,,Good looking bridge,4.0,,As the name suggest this is a helix design.Great views of the marina bay area are afforded from the bridge which has refuges where you can stop and admire the scenery. Even more impressive when lit up at night.
,,Just a fancy bridge with good view,3.0,,"Not sure why this is counted as an attraction. To me, it was just a fancy bridge with a good view. The view was good and we enjoyed our walk, but not something you must see for tourists.

If you have ample amount of time (like us) then taking a stroll from Shoppe mall to Merlion Park (though Helix Bridge) during sunset is quite relaxing and enjoyable."
,,Those amazing views- and that fantastic architecture!,5.0,,"The site - on reclaimed land formerly a large part of Marina Bay - enables you to look out over great swathes of this vibrant island nation. To get to the top takes seemingly seconds and, as you'd expect, it's a smooth, flawless ride, with expert congestion control of ingress and egress. You may feel your ears ""pop""as you swiftly ascend. It's not cheap but I wasn't paying! And you will be lost in admiration with all those views. We were dining the next day at the venerable Singapore Cricket Club and from where we stood, looking down, it seemed minute. The views on either side will entrance you by day and - from what I've seen of it - also (or especially) at night. There are restaurants and bars to lighten your wallet/purse and - if you are so inclined- those vertiginous swim-up bars with that infinity feel. The breezes at the top somehow don't seem to bring heat, only relief in the renowned Singaporean humidity. This is, rightly, an iconic attraction and one that should be on EVERY visitor's ""Bucket List""."
,,Interesting stainless steel structure,5.0,,Worth visiting as a means of crossing over the river in the Marina area. Constructed of stainless steel in a DNA sdouble helix structure. Illuminated at night to ilight ncrease its character.

,,Beautiful place to stroll at sunset and take in the views on the waterfront,5.0,,"After a lovely afternoon at Gardens by the Bay we strolled across the Helix Bridge to enjoy a really good value meal from the stalls at Gluttons Bay. This is a very easy walk for pedestrians (no cars) with lots of points to take in the amazing views (photos) on the water and see the lights of Marina Bay Sands and the Arts Science Museum. (Lotus shaped building). I'd recommend doing this at sunset, as it is cool and the harbour comes alive with lights. Very special."
,,Special view of the Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"The Bridge offers, apart from the link to the Marina Bay, special photo ops, especially at night of the spectacular Marina Bay Sands Hotel."
,,Best walking bridge,5.0,,As walking bridges go this is pretty stunning. The views of Singapore are fantastic from here which has several viewing areas.
,,Fun for first timers,4.0,,This is actually one of the attractions to visit when in the Marina Bay Area. You can access this via the Marina Centre or the opposite side of the Bay. Best to visit at night because of the lights and also so it would not be too hot for the kids to walk over.
,,Amazing structure,4.0,,Really cool steel suspension bridge that gets you over to the Marina Bay Sands shops. Even better at nigh5 when it’s all lit up with red lights. Lots of joggers and people on scooters at night.

The view from Marina Bay to the city were wonderful, plus it offers shade from the sun. I would go out of my way to visit this again."

,,A must visit day and night,5.0,,"Great views of the city in the day and night, as well as being a beautiful bridge. I'd like it more if it was called the DNA bridge ;)"

,,Not Quite an attraction,3.0,,"This can be at bottom of your priority. This is just a bridge. Even the view might not be that attractive. I am surprised that this is listed as an attraction.

,,Wow!,5.0,,This amazing foot bridge links across the Marina Bay to The Marina Bay Sands hotel. I think it is built based on DNA and is so impressive at night.
,,Impressive,5.0,,Nice bridge with great views of marina bay. Good place for a photo stop if walking from town to marina sands

,,Mesmerizing Place,4.0,,Mesmerizing Place - Believe me it is specially when you will visit in evening. I visited it with my friends Felix and Joel and it is still very fresh in my mind. Great place to visit in Singapore. Strongly recommended with 100% money back guarantee :)
,,an unusual bridge.looks great at night.,4.0,,"crossing the singapore river,dwarfed by the impressive buildings around it,is this unusual bridge.it is a footbridge with a veiwing point looking over the river and at theatre on the river.at night it is lit up and looks good."
,,An experience you will never forget,5.0,,Spend some time to check out the 360 views from this outstanding building. Great time is the sun set.
,,Modern design,4.0,,"A very nice stailess steel bridge in the shape of the DNA overwatching the Bay and the gardens by the bay! By night, you can clearly see lit up the 4 letters, c g a & t, which represent the 4 bases of the DNA, (the a stands for adenine, but you can search for the other 3). So as usual it is much fun enjoying your time over the bridge in the night time lights and of course the weather would be much nicer. But still the views from the bridge are not bad at all in the morning. I can't say it is a must place to visit but I'm quite sure it is on your way visiting the area anyway, so enjoy it."

,,Good views,5.0,,Love walking the Helix Bridge. It's not too long but you can get some great pictures of the surrounding area. It's beautiful at night all lit up. It's a spectacular architectural bridge. It reminded me of the bridge in London in the Harry Potter movie.

,,Recommended Photo Spot,4.0,,"There are three great photo spots for you snap pictures of the Scoence and Technology Museum, the Marina Bay Sands hotel building and the city skyline.

This 6 Km walk will take you about an hour (excludes entry and time spent INSIDE the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest of Gardens By The Bay)."

,,"It's a long bridge, but offers shade and quick access to Sands",3.0,,It's the fastest way to reach Sands area from the city center - even faster than the round-trip with MRT. It's quite long bridge though with no attractions or refreshments - maybe during evenings it would offer different kind of viewpoint for the bay lightshow..
,,"Lovely views, must go at night",4.0,,Lovely views but go at night for the best displays. Its a wonder to walk across and beautiful to look at.
,,Great view,3.0,,"The bridge offers a great view of the marina. You could get closer to the Singapore flyer or be able to take great photos from below the Marina Bay Sands.

,,Amazing engineering,4.0,,"The Helix bridge was opened in 2010. It is an amazing piece of engineering based on the DNA double helix model.

,,Useful,3.0,,A convenient way to get to the Marina Bay Sands and the mall. Nice for a bridge. Not much else to say.
,,a very cool architecture,5.0,,This Helix Bridge and super tree is the highlight of my trip. Marvelous architecture and photographer's pr0n!
,,Bridging people and places,4.0,,"It's actually just a bridge over the bay linking Marina South to MBS and Gardens by the Bay. But with this bridge, you can actually walk or jog around the entire bay area. It's a wonderful vantage point to see the Singapore skyline, the ever popular postcard shot that you must take. The design is unique as it duplicated the helix. At night, the lit city skyline lends a real atmosphere to soak in the sight and admire the country's modernity interspersed with some heritage buildings like the Fullerton Hotel. Not to be missed is the Merlion's ever spouting water or some thinks it's puke. Whatever your intentions, it's a nice walk across to soak in the sight but also serves it's purpose of bridging the different area of the marina area. By the way, it's also made famous by the historic meeting between Trump and Kim Jun Un in Jun 2018 when the North Korean leader was hosted to a walk on this very bridge."
,,Connection between Merlion and The Shoppes,5.0,,It’s an amazing bridge where it moves as we walk and there are a lot of people who jog around. No need to take any MRT to go to the shopping malls in Marina bay!

A very interesting must-visit place in Singapore."

,,"Another ""First"" for Singapore",5.0,,"This is the world’s first double helix curved bridge. At night is when the bridge is at its most notable. Glass and steel and spirals configure with the lights - blue and white to make quite the spectacle. Walking or driving is an unique experience and the views are outstanding.

,,Fantastic architecture.,4.0,,There are so many fascinating buildings and structures to see in Singapore and the Helix Bridge is certainly one of them. It is amazing both from an architectural and construction perspective. I would recommend visiting both at day and night - the lights bouncing of the bay water are very nice.

Walking across this bridge is for me like walking across the Brooklyn Bridge in New York: an iconic must-do!"

,,"Pedestrian bridge; easy walk, even with a stroller, great views",5.0,,"This is a very new addition to Singapore. Apparently if you look closely you can see the DNA letters: ACGT 'woven' into the steel parapet. I couldn't find any of the letters! There are several little viewing pods sticking out from the bridge for your photo ops. At the far end of the bridge you arrive at The Shops at Marina Bay Sands; an over the top shopping centre, but you may as well have a look. There's a sort of canal with something like a cross between gondolas and punts that you can have a ride on. Little kids love the billions of LEDs which hang 4 storeys high and twinkle and change, creating a sort of splash effect on the floor below. The kiddies can run and jump on this surface and make the lights change, flow, splash, etc."
,,Perfect place for taking photos and exercise,5.0,,"We were on our way to the Marina Sand Bay and crossing The Helix Bridge was really nice. Even though it is a busy bridge we enjoyed the views of the surroundings. But here even the bridge architecture is brilliant, with night time and the lights it is almost surreal, like Singapore itself. Well, that was how we felt when we were there in Singapore and we also wrote few articles on our blog, that you can check. The bridge is perfectly positioned for some great photos of iconic buildings and city panorama but also just walking there is fun."

,,Another interesting sight in the Marina Bay area,4.0,,We were on a short bus excursion coming back from the Marin Bay Gardens to our hotel in the China Town area and passed by the Helix Bridge in it's full illuminated glory. We didn't have time to disembark and walk across it but it does shine up in a spectacular fashion at night and provides yet another photo opportunity to embellish the sights of this part of the city.
,,Night Lights,5.0,,"The Helix Bridge (Double Helix, actually) is really nice. It offers great views of the Marina Bay from the MBS building. You can walk across the bridge and go to the esplanade side or to the MBS, depending on which side you are. I love the way the colours change, looks really cool."
,,Nice bridge,3.0,,"This is a quirky bridge, built in stainless steel, with a design said to resemble the double helix of DNA. It is interesting to see but wouldn't class it as a must see"
,,Must visit when in Bayfront,5.0,,"This connects waterfront promenade area to The Shoppes mall. It's shorter to go from here to Waterfront promenade and to the Merlion from Shoppes.
It's pretty well lighted in evening and gives an amazing view of the bay. Also, this is free of cost. A leisurely stroll would also take only 10 mins from one side to other."

,,Great view!!!,5.0,,"You pay a relatively high admission to get from the bottom to the top. But the whole amount you can spend in the cafe/bar up there, on good but expensive drinks. Don’t miss it. Best views South to North. When taking the elevator to go down, don’t forget that you can have a standing view also looking South."
,,Great run,4.0,,Recommended to run over this bridge to get to the Marina Sand Bay Hotel. Formed as a dna helix. Pretty cool!
,,Interesting way to cross,4.0,,"The bridge is an interesting addition to the area, but once you are on it it is another means of viewing the great area that is Marina Bay. The bridge is easy to find and utilise, it has a great display at night with the different lights making an enjoyable experience."

,,A Must Visit!,5.0,,Bask in the beautiful surroundings this place has to offer with great photo op picture taking and more!
,,Clever design,4.0,,Clever spiral design with three good viewing platforms looking out over Marina Bay. Lights up at night adding another sparkling dimension reflected in the water

It is really beautiful and shows great attention to detail. From a practical perspective, it is a quick easy way to get from one side of the bay to the other. Quite steep so if you have mobility issues or a non-electric wheelchair, it will be a bit of work to get over, however the footpath is really wide and smooth."
,,"Nice Ambiance, Romantic walk",5.0,,"Well, when you hear about Helix Bridge, it's not like any ordinary bridge. It has a historical reference, it's a walking bridge where you can stretch along the lights, especially at night. I used it to reach Gardens by the Bay and used it on the return trip as I wasn't disappointed. I recommend visiting."
,,beautiful bridge overseeing the water,5.0,,"came here for a run. spacious. good for taking a breather and taking some iconic singapore pictures. thou a touristic place, but nevertheless beautiful scenes are to share."
,,Night lights on helix!,4.0,,"I love how the lights at night lit up emphasizing the bridge. A little bit of walking to get to the other side of the river, from manila bay to the merlion statue!"
,,Unusual Design,5.0,,This is basically a bridge which connects 2 areas of the marina bay. You get a lovely view of the Marina from the bridge. I'd estimate the length of the bridge is about 200m.
,,Nice bridge at night,4.0,,"The bridge look beautiful at night (because of the lighting), but just look average at noon. You can use this bridge to move from merlion area to marina area."
,,Nice little bridge for pedestrians,4.0,,This bridge is a must when you are in this area and you need to go from Esplanades to MBS. The modern architecture is original and walking over is nice as the floor is made by kind if wood and only for pedestrian.

,,Beautiful Place to Pause,5.0,,"Many are wondering, how is a bridge a Top 30 sight in Singapore? Simple, it's the Helix Bridge which is unlike 97% of other similar structures with an incredible panoramic view of Singapore's iconic bay. My wife and I crossed this bridge no less than 10 times during our 5 day visit while staying at the Pan Pacific Singapore. The views are completely different from night and day, and there are several jetty's from the bridge offering unobstructed views. We visited during the Chinese New Years celebrations, at all times of the day without crowding. If you find yourself in Singapore, the Helix Bridge is worthy of a visit."

It is made of stainless steel and being Singapore is kept incredibly clean. It leans towards the Marina Bay Sands Hotel at one end and the Merlion and Olympic Sports Garden and children’s art garden at the other.
There are some great spots on the bridge that have reflective panels too – well worth a visit and a walk across."

,,Really cool DNA!,5.0,,Was in Singapore over Chinese New Year's and walked across this bridge at night during the festivities. It's lit up at night with the four colors symbolizing the DNA. Really nice area to overlooking the Marina Bay Hotel and Science center. New bridge since 2010.
,,Nice bridge and nice view!!,5.0,,Nice bridge and nice walk towards Casino - cool bridge from design point of view too!! Worth visiting!!!
,,Nice view at night.,4.0,,Although I can't call it a tourist spot but it has a splendid view at night time due to its light effects.

,,Interesting walkway,4.0,,"It won’t cost anything to walk over the Helix Bridge. Its design is based on the structure of DNA and it is quite interesting to be walking through what is the essence of us all humans. It is a natural link between 2 Singapore landmarks and while you can see and photograph it from a number of angles, it is really worth taking the walk along its pathway."
,,True Engineering,5.0,,This bridge is a credit to its designer and constructors. The bridge also provides good vantage points for taking photographs of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
,,Magnificient,5.0,,"The design of this bridge is very beautiful and the view is wonderful in the evening. Shaped like a DNA helix, it links the Marina Bay to the Marina Center. Although it is just a pedestrian bridge, it lights add to the vibe of the bay."

,,Gorgeous architecture,4.0,,This is the “must visit” when you come to Singapore. Especially when you take picture with Marina bay sands. It looks fantastic! Walk in night time with comfort breeze that is awesome. Walk slowly and enjoy this gorgeous bridge .
,,Must see,5.0,,"One of the top thing to see in Singapore. Prefer walking on the bridge by night, the purple color plus the marina bay sand behind is simply gorgeous! The walk is of course free"
,,An illuminated walkway,4.0,,Abftr dark the bay comes to life and walking the Helix bridge is a great way to take it all in. Several viewing platforms allow you to get out from the frame. A great thing to photograph as well
,,Can't decide how to rate this bridge... is pretty and lots of locals exercise here but I don't think is a must watch,4.0,,"This bridge is a link between the esplanade, stadium and some restaurants on that side, to the Marina Bay Sands and it offers good/interesting opportunities to capture photos of the art museum (the weird white hand-shaped building). But that is it, it does not seem to be integrated as part of the city. I guess you could say something similar of most bridges (with the exception of Ponte vecchio in Florence) but this bridge is just a lookout to other things in the city more than a functional or marvel of engineering.

The bridge is very interesting to photograph though. If you want to capture the DNA helix with its colours as reflected off the bridge, I will suggest to you to come early in the morning, when there is not much traffic and go nuts. That is what we did... unfortunately, there is nothing to eat around, so you will have to walk to the shopping mall or wait several ours after the sun has come up to get something decent to eat."
,,Trendy Transit,5.0,,Hopping across to Gardens by the Bay via this bridge.... loved the architecture of construction making it a destination in itself.
,,Connection point,5.0,,"Connects MBS with the opposite section, able to access esplanade or stadium area from MBS. only useful at night when its not hot."
,,Inventive,5.0,,"Attractive pedestrian bridge across the harbour, and another piece of the tourist trail around that area. Built on the theme of the DNA helix. Looks good in daytime, and imaginative lighting creates lots of nighttime photo opportunities. Don’t miss it."
,,"Don't go out of your way, it's just a bridge!",4.0,,It's an interesting bridge & has some shelter from the rain but I wouldn't go out of your way to see the bridge. You'll probably walk across it if you walk back from the Marina Bay Sands hotel to the waterside walkway but other wise it's just a modern bridge with very good views.
,,Interesting,4.0,,This is a walking bridge to connect the 2 sides of the bay for pedestrians. Made to look like the double helix. Pretty bridge from which one can take nice photos of the bay. Take a stroll here if you are in Singapore ...
,,"Unique Bridge Design, Connecting Both Sides of Marina Bay",4.0,,"This bridge has an interesting design, like most structures around Marina Bay. It is an essential pedestrian link from one side of the bay to the other and provides access to the Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel"
,,Late afternoon walk,4.0,,Well it is not quite as important as the bridge of the river kwai...but it is a nice walk. I would recommend later afternoon to have it at day and night time. The design is certainly something special.
,,Great view of Singapore skyline,4.0,,"This is probably one of the best spots for a photo of singapore skyline with the famous singapore Merlion, most of the financial buildings and some other landmarks like the Fullerton hotel."
,,A bridge to walk across,4.0,,If you are planning a walk around the Singapore Harbour via Marina Bay Hotel then take a stroll across the Helix Bridge for a great view of the city. On a fine day worth your time.
,,A neat little walk,4.0,,"I went out of the way to take the walk. It was at night and I was returning from the garden. It's not a ""Must See"" but it was a pleasant, alternate route and I'm glad I did it."
,,"A masterpiece of design and construction, best viewed at night.",5.0,,"This bridge is built in a double helix (it used to be called Double Helix Bridge), and was inspired by the DNA chain. It curves round as well as making it possible to walk around the complete marina. The curve is most obvious at night, when it lights up beautifully.
This is the route to the Singapore Flyer from the Marina Bay pedestrian area."
,,A really nice walk encompassing the best of Singapore's views,5.0,,"Starting from the base of MBS, we walked from there around the waterfront, through MBS across the bridge into the Gardens by the Bay - it was a great walk. We got to enjoy Singapore's best views in a delightful environment. It wasn't too long, was leisurely, and was the best as the sun started to set."
,,A lovely walk - especially at night !,4.0,,Great place to walk at night - with all the lovely lights reflecting off the waters. Tourist attraction and photo point - always crowded.
,,Cool bridge,4.0,,Very interesting pedestrian bridge linking the Singapore Flyer with the Gardens by the Bay and Marina Sands hotel
,,great to walk for diffrent experiece.,4.0,,its a nice walk lots of selfie taken by my kids.its only 15 minutes walk to garden by the way but overall nice walking.
,,Cool Bridge!,4.0,,Def a lovely view passing over to go to the Marina Sands. It was quite congested with a lot of tourists crossing over and doing photos so it was a little annoying to keep stopping for people. Otherwise worth the walk to see the lovely shot of the area!
,,A walk through wonderland - dont miss,5.0,,"After watching the amazing sound and light show at Gardens by the Bay, we walked through the gardens across this bridge to Marina Bay Sands.. It is extremely well manicured and designed offering views across all sides of this amazing city. Whilst enjoying the lights above, Don't forget to look at the various features in the water below.. you will be in wonderland.. not sure which view better!!! A don't miss walk across this bridge"
,,Not for height-phobics,4.0,,A great experience but not for those afraid of heights. Some impressive malls with top quality stores selling unaffordable items (judging by what seemed like the wealth level of most people we saw). Popular with families and young couples but saw plenty of old people with strollers (before you ask). A good way to arrive at gardens by the bay.
,,Scenic spot at the Marina Bay area,4.0,,"This is a scenic spot especially at night when the temperature is cooler and the lighting are on. The bridge can get crowded with tourist but it is worth visiting for the view. If you plan to visit in the afternoon, bring some water with you, sun block and umbrella."
,,Cool area to Walk,4.0,,"Its a beautiful place to walk and enjoy the evening. It's a amazing design, that links to the Marina Bay Sands area."
,,Lovely views!,4.0,,Gorgeous view from the bridge and definitely worth walking over - stunning walk to the other side linking the two areas.
,,Amazing architecture,5.0,,"We traversed this bridge happily, as it was an easy connect from our Hotel (Pan Pacific) to Gardens by the Bay and the Marine Sands Shoppes. An absolute delight."
,,A very Beautiful Bridge ...,5.0,,This is ideally a bridge which connects the Promenade to the Hotel over the SIngapore river ... But is is beautiful and intelligently made .. In the evening it is beautifully lighted as well .. from a distance it looks like a crawling reptile ..
,,"Helix Bridge, Singapore.",4.0,,"This impressive bridge, constructed entirely of stainless steel and aluminium tubing, connects Marina Bay with the start of the City proper. Interesting construction and impressive walkway."
,,Great design,4.0,,"Very cool and clever,Singapore has many bridges but thus one stands out in it's unique design and very appealing to the eye."

,,Great night scenery,4.0,,I always use this bridge when I come for annual Chingay parades and other events! The bridge is really unique and you can take a short break by the sides. The breeze is really nice at night and you can enjoy seeing the surrounding scenery!

,,great for photos,4.0,,"This is a cool bridge to get photos of the bay and surrounds from, especially at night or at dawn when the sun is just rising."
,,"Interesting , if slightly bizarre",5.0,,"Interesting, if slightly bizarre footbridge across the Singapore River, close to the Marina Bay Resort.
Very different (and futuristic) design compared with the more traditional, and older crossings. The Felix , made of stainless steel and glass opened in 2010, and at night features coloured lights in a fascinating free spectacle."
,,Amazing view from the Bridge.,5.0,,The bridge connected from Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall to the Youth Olympic Park next to the Boat @ Marina Bay Grand Stand. The view along the bridge walkway was fantastic especially at night.
,,Worth the Walk,5.0,,"Interesting design with all the World seeming to be crossing it whenever you are on it - daytime or night time.
Warning - watch out for all those people taking photos, including weddings, or selfies by people not thinking about all the other people trying to cross the bridge and just stopping!,"
,,Great bridge,5.0,,This huge and long bridge is a very good connection to the Marine Bay Sands hotel and looks nice if it is spotlighted with ligt at night.
,,Interesting bridge as part of a walk around to/from MBS,4.0,,"Just a really cool bridge with great views of Marina Bay Sands. Note that it's only partly covered, so not much protection if it's raining."
,,Yet another engineering and architectural design,5.0,,This bridge has been built with components that will last centuries and for that alone one needs to walk along its length and admire the craftsmanship.

,,Incredible engineering,4.0,,"This bridge shows a DNA helix in its construction, an engineering wonder and work of art. Looks really great."
,,The light of the night!,5.0,,For those who already read my reviews this is not news but for the others I'll tell you that my favorite time of the day to visit a city is actually at night. And The Helix Bridge is the true example of why. During the day is nice but at night with its color gives light to the city and brings magic to it!
,,Time travel tunnel,5.0,,Is pretty a fancy bridge But for a evening/late night trolling around CDB for a tourist or local I find it relaxing and enjoying . Recommended free activities
,,What an idea...,5.0,,Till we saw it we couldn't believe such a bridge exists. And seeing it in night while walking through it from Esplanade to Marina Sands was a WOW expierence
,,A nice bridge but not overly spectacular!,3.0,,"The Helix Bridge is a nice functional bridge but not a spectacular bridge. It is more the millennium bridge in London rather than Tower Bridge, or the Sydney Harbour Bridge, or the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco."
,,Architecture at its best,5.0,,This bridge connects to Marina Bay sand from The olympic Park. This Bridge is spiral Bridge which is designed amazingly & it looks beautiful All Time.. Lovely place.. Do stop for a Photshot
,,Unique Architecture,5.0,,I have seen it rated as one of the top 5 bridge designs in the world. It is certainly unique and if you are into design worth the visit.
,,Evening walk,4.0,,This bridge located just outside marina bay mall and close to artscience museum also which connected to singapore flyover.
,,Nice Bridge,4.0,,Amazing light in the night when we walk through it. It is better to go to the bridge in the end of afternoon until night.

,,A beautiful view of Singapore,5.0,,The view from the Helix Bridge is very beautiful. Its quite a picturesque place. Definitely a must visit for all the tourists.
,,Wow again,5.0,,The view from here is amazing. We walked around the top taking photos. Unless you have a good camera there are so many bright lights your photos don’t come out ver clear. This is well worth a visit. Go at night so you can see all the lights.
,,A Fantastically attractive span of the river,4.0,,"We walked over this a few times during our visit and as well as being a very attractive piece of architecture it also offers several vantage points for photos of the sights and is the best way to walk/cycle/skate or segway across to the Marina Bay Sands, the Gardens by the Bay as well as the artscience museum, which loosely based on a lotus flower...(or an upturned hand) collects light and water as well as providing a delightful display space.

The bridge also offers some shelter from the blazing sun...or in our case the constant drizzle, and is beautifully illuminated at night, defo worth a visit."
,,An amazing structure...,5.0,,... with lots of people going over it! We took some great evening photos from the bridge as we crosse. Worth a visit! YMMV
,,Deserves a stroll,4.0,,Quite unrated. The entire area is nice to walk around. The bridge is under utilized as there is really not much foot traffic. Some parts before and after are dimly lit.
,,Very Cool pathway,5.0,,Takes you from one side to the Marina Bay Area without the boat. Looks to be a walking and running trail too. At Marina Bay it starts at the Mall and Food Court which is right outside the Science & Art Museum.
,,Beautiful Helix Bridge,5.0,,This is a very beautiful helix style bridge near Marina Bay Sands Hotel. I would recommend visiting this bridge at night also because it is even more beautiful. At the side of the bridge there are spots where you can get a nice view the city and Marina Bay Sands Hotel. This bridge is a must see when you are in Singapore!

,,COOL pedestrian bridge over the river near Marina Bay Sands!,5.0,,"We walked over this bridge multiple times during our Singapore visit. It is very well designed and a great way to get to the Marina Bay Sands from the Singapore Flyer. There is great detail in the ""DNA strands"" surrounding the bridge. All are lit up at night. It is nice to cross a bridge and not be right next to the traffic on the road. Since this is a pedestrian only bridge, that is not an issue. Also they included three observation platforms on the Marina Bay side of the bridge, which makes it easy to move off to the side and take photos of the amazing Singapore skyline. A plaque on the opposite side of the bridge from the MBS explains the design in more detail."
,,Foot Bridge but Beautifully Designed,5.0,,This connects the Marina with the other side of the river ... It is a beautiful walk along it .. Night time is the best time when the lights are beautifully lit .. If you see from a distance it looks like a tube floating on the water .. an engineering marvel
,,Day and night beauty,5.0,,"This is a great link between the MBS and the mainland, and people love it, especially at night. With three observation decks that allow for some great pictures, this is a natural attraction. Amazing that the load was so efficiently distributed by the design that the city decided to upgrade to stainless steel and still come in under budget."
,,Beautiful and very interesting idea,5.0,,Walking across the river in a DNA Double Helix is interesting and fun - especially at night - it is well lit and is a good neighborhood
,,Fun Walk,5.0,,"What a great footbridge. When you first view it, it looks like a tube over water, a curved tube of lights. Actually that's what it is. An artistic piece of engineering. Makes you wonder why more footbridges can't be built like this.

This bridge will connect the northern end of Marina Bay Sands and Mall, with Raffles Avenue and the Youth Olympic Park."
,,Good place for enjoying Singapore's night seeing,4.0,,"This place is at best when the night come. So, make sure you come to here after 6 pm and also when the sky is clear.

,,So beautiful at night,5.0,,"We walked across this fabulous bridge most nights during a 5 nights in Singapore as we made our way from our hotel the Conrad Centennial across to the Marina Bay Sands complex, the water & light night show & during the day to go to Gardens by the Bay & to walk around the Bay.

The lighting of this Helix Bridge is amazing at night with many viewing platforms to get the best views of the Bay."

,,Must visit in Sincapore,4.0,,Beautiful area to visit when in Singapore - we enjoyed strolling there during the day but very special at night.

If you want a great day time shot, best time to go is between mid day to early afternoon. (In the late afternoon, you will be facing the sun at certain angles). In the evening, the bridge and all its beautiful surroundings lit up to create yet more fantastic views. The pictures you take will enchant you forever.

Tip: If you can, plan your trip in Marina Bay and nearby attractions in such a way that you get to spend at least half a day and into the evening! You will not only get to enjoy Marina Bay, but also the Helix bridge, Marina Bay Sands, and nearby Merlion Park all within walking distance.

I wouldn’t go out of my way to walk this bridge; it’s a bridge. But if you have attended the Garden or Marina Sands light shows and are wishing to walk back to your accommodation then this bridge will form part of that route.

The bridge opened on 24 April 2010, the design was inspired by the form of the curved DNA structure. At night pairs of colored letters c and g, as well as a and t on the bridge light up at night in red and green to represent cytosine, guanine, adenine and thymine, the four bases of DNA.

,,The single most beautiful bridge in Singapore.,5.0,,"This double-helix bridge, connecting the Esplanade park to the Marina Bay Sands area, is - by far - the most STUNNING bridge in Singapore.

I do have to say they did politely offer the use of trousers free of charge if I wanted to stay. 22.30 and $S160 on 3 drinks each later we found it better to leave... relative prices I suppose but too rich for my pockets but what stunning views a ""must do"" for sight seer's once in a lifetime opportunity for me"

The spiral ceiling is intriguing in a delicate manner. I was there during the day, so I was feeling so so with my surrounding. At first, I thought the bridge not as pleasant as the night time. Until I accidentally found a way to enjoy the most of the bridge during the day.

I was trying to not be on my phone to take pictures while I was there because I try to connect myself with the surrounding. However, the boredom of the place gradually increase up to the point I took my phone try to taking pictures. I am using android phone and there is this hyperlapse mode to take video, so I try it. I walked from one end of the bridge to the other end while recording the ceiling in that mode. Surprisingly, I could see the beauty of those helixes from other perspective.

By put the view in certain speed of motion, you could see how those helixes were intertwined and seemingly alive."

,,Great at Night,5.0,,lovely feat of underestimated engineering. we crossed this day and night time. Night time crossing is better due to the lighting on the bridge.
,,Typical Singapore,4.0,,A smal walking bridge that goes over the river to the Marina bay Mall and also the part of the gardens of the bay. Every country would make a normal walking bridge but Singapore makes a design bridge. Nice to have a walk here at night when its lighted. Small platforms goves you the chance to enjoy the skyline of Marina Bay and take pictures..
,,Fantastic bridge across to Marina Sands,5.0,,"What a lovely bridge. Like a spring laid on its side and stretched across the bay, holding up a walkway. On both sides there are platforms to stop at and enjoy the views of the skyscrapers in the city."

,,Plan during your MBS visit,4.0,,It's a beauty to walk on during the night and also the best place to watch the night laser show from MBS. Don't plan this as a standalone attraction. Can be planned when you visit Marina Bay Sands and then plan the evening laser show and end it with a walk on the bridge.
,,Free and functional,5.0,,"Again, I have to say it. This was a no-brainer for us because it's free, iconic and it looks really cool.

Singapore is just a hub for futuristic and functional design that's a pleasure to photograph and use.

We used the Helix bridge a few times to cross between the Esplanade and Marina Bay Sands. It's a really pleasant walk, just beware of the Singapore heat and sun. Shops by the Bay is at the end of the bridge, it's fully air conditioned and a respite from the climate with plenty of places for refreshment.

Helix bridge has several ""look outs"" which provide great photo opportunities of the down town business district, the theaters by the bay and even another aspect to Marina Bay Sands.

It's great to look at, provides convenient access to the Marina Bay area and it's free!

If you get a chance, catch a glimpse of it by night, all lit up, it's quite stunning."
,,Great town planning!,5.0,,"Singapore is great at providing leisure facilities as well as being a thriving business centre. This pedestrian bridge links the huge Marina Sands area which is great if you're hoofing it. Not only is it useful though, it is a really attractive structure by both day and night."

,,A subtle 'link' of who we all are,5.0,,"I remember seeing The Helix bridge for the first time and thought simply - how cool..

It is a piece of artwork in itself and as you walk across the bridge other than just being functional, you can see how much thought was put into its design with viewing platforms stretching out giving great views across the bay, and other small details such as the individual floor lights showing part of the makeup of a DNA Helix. Look out for these floor lights with letters as you walk across.

Extremely well thought out displaying subtly a part of who we all are and in a fun way. Reminding us that we are 'linked' to all things :D

Very beautifully lit up at night. Fabulous."
,,Unique,4.0,,A very unique bridge designed in the shape of a Helix. Take the bridge at night to walk to Marina Bay Sands area.

,,Fantastic views but take an umbrella if it's sunny!,5.0,,"Despite living in Singapore for more than 5 years, I had never walked on this bridge. My bad - the views from the Helix are breathtaking! The only potential downside: it can be incredibly hot as the Helix metal reflects the sun. So you might want to wear sunscreen or take an umbrella foe protection. Also, if you go around 6 pm, the sun is in a beautiful location for some interesting photos."
,,Great spot for panoramic photos,5.0,,I don't usually write reviews for bridges ahah but i must say that it is a perfect one to cross the bay !! The design itself is amazing and integrates perfectly into the scenery.

,,Great views and a quirky walk,4.0,,"This spans the freshwater marina and is unique in its appearance. Its a fun thing to walk across with great views across to the Financial district, the 'Eye' and of the Marina. It isn't straight and the bends allow you to appreciate the curves as you traverse it, as do the various viewing platforms on the land side of the bridge.

If you do get hot though there are malls very near both ends so you can cool off in the air conditioning or just be grabbing a drink!"

The bridge itself is a stainless steel marvel and really doesn't show its best until after dark the lights on the bridge show it off much better that no lights during the day

As for the bridge itself if you look closely whoever built it took care in the finish. The welds are smooth and clean
And polished

We did notice that the design of the bridge was one of looks mostly not function. The bridge wobbles and shakes with foot traffic

Great place for some good Photos
7/10 for photo attraction at night"
,,"Beautiful,short bridge",4.0,,"I crossed this bridge to walk from the park where I visited a museum, cultural center, Singapore River etc. to the Marina Bay areas. Instead of this bridge, there is an underpass that connects both areas."
,,Walkable modern art object,5.0,,"I was advised to see the Helix Bridge at night when its lights are lit. The bridge was inspired by DNA structure, so the lights were meant to emphasize shapes and curves. I walked the bridge at night and during the day. Interestingly, I liked it better during the daytime. To me, festive lights were distracting from appreciating the genius design and intricate construction. Treat it as an art object that you can explore from within. If you like modern architecture, this is one of not to miss examples."

There is also plenty to see and to do at either end of the Helix, so you can easily include it as a part of a longer tour."

,,Just a bridge too,1.0,,This is just a bridge so there is nothing exciting about it. But if you really have nothing better to do then go visit this bridge. Actually you would be better off walking up the Benjamin Sheares Bridge to get a bird's eye view of the singapore waterfront.

,,Bridge with a million dollar view to enjoy!,4.0,,"An unplanned stroll across the Helix Bridge was a bonus on a hot September evening in balmy Singapore. After a dinner event at MBS, I decided to walk back to Millenia Walk instead of catching a bus or taxi - think it's just about 8-900m or a little more? I managed to take a couple of impressive shots of the night-time skyline of the business district. Also, from this vantage point, there was a clear view of the Marina Bay Sands complex and the Art Science Museum. Really nice I might say ...and it was worth the walk."
,,Looks amazin gin the night!,5.0,,In the day when you have a walk there it looks interesting. It has little sections where you can include the hotel in the picture or just make some nice pictures with the sea. In the night however it is amazing! The lights gives another kick to the bridge.

,,Nice bridge but road blocked because of Formula One,1.0,,"The Helix Bridge is a nice bridge and a major attraction in Singapore. Although the design and infrastructure was very good, the policies imposed on the bridge was terrible. Because of the Formula One Race Car event going on in Singapore, the whole bridge was blocked and the only way ( yes, no other way) is to take the MRT ( Circle line or Downtown Line) from Bayfront to Promenade station ( if you want to go to that particular place or stations). This made the whole experience problematic and annoying."

,,Remarkable structure,4.0,,I crossed this remarkable bridge on my way to Gardens by the Bay. It takes you by Marina Bay and the Science museum. The entire area seems to have been taken from a science fiction movie. These things must be seen to know that they really exist!

,,Fantastic Pedestrian Bridge in Singapore,5.0,,"It was amazing and the design is really like a strand of DNA as the actual bridge forms spiral and twist to create this amazing structure. At night the bridge is enhanced with lights, crating a dazzling effect. The bridge leads directly off from the Marina Bay Sands area."
,,Dna style bridge,4.0,,"Once you've visited the Merlion take a stroll across the helix bridge
This is shaped like dna spiral and as you walk along the esplanade you can buy ice cream in coconut shells which is a treat

,,It's an interesting architecture wonder,4.0,,"This is one of the newest bridge which has become part of a sight to see when in Singapore. This bridge is for pedestrians only and spans the Marina Bay leading to Marina Bay Sands. These are 2 photos taken at one end of the bridge to give you a model of the the bridge and some information.

,,Neat to see but I would not make a special trip,3.0,,"The helix bridge can be seen from the Flyer, from the duck tours if you take one (you go right underneath) or from the marina bay sands hotel. So it neat to look at as you are getting to another destination. Not sure I'd seek it out as a destination itself."
,,Amazing feat of engineering,4.0,,"Was fascinated by the architecture of this bridge, all the metal work is curved and gives a really interesting walk. the reflections from the top are good. The bridge lights up at night which gives it a mystical air. Great respect for the designer."

,,"Creative architecture, good views",5.0,,"Shaped in the form of a DNA strand, the helix bridge is a beautifully architected bridge linking Marina Bay Sands to Marina Square.

,,The DNA Helix Bridge,4.0,,"The DNA Helix Bridge is a great way to get from the Marina Bay Sands area and the Art & Science Museum to other attractions in the area, but the best part is that it's over a bay that boats regularly go through, so the view is really nice: you can grab a photo of the passing boats with the skyline, which itself is quite extensive and pretty.

Nothing more."

The archetecture of the bridge is beautiful during the day, and incredible at night. You can see the similarities to the DNA structure we learned about in school. Once I noticed that the DNA pairs (A, G, T, C) are actually illuminated along the pathway, that made it even cooler.
The bridge also offers beautiful views of the city and with a good zoom lense, you can even get the Merlion."
,,A new surprise,5.0,,A new surprise since our last visit to Singapore. The bridge is really a wonder. Much better and bigger than the millennium bridge in London.

,,Not really sure what to say about a foot bridge!,4.0,,"Yes, you can walk on it. There is some cover if it rains (though not the entire length of the bridge), and a little protection from the sun. The bridge does go from one side of the river to the other so does qualify as a bridge."

,,"Nice bridge, poor location",3.0,,"Of course I had to take a walk through my almost namesake bridge, which has an interesting construction.

,,A marvel of engineering and provides a good view of Marina Bay,3.0,,"The bridge is a walkway from the Skyview to Marina Bay and Art Science building and is visually stunning, Moe so at night when the lights are on and accentuate the curves and construction. During the day can see the steel work which goes into its construction. But it only a short walk and tends to be overwhelmed after a few minutes by the Marina Bay Sands and the towers with the boat like structure on show. I never managed to work out what the difference between the Helix and Henderson bridges is? Or are they different names for the same bridge. Either way you can admire the engineering and see the views over the water to the Merlion,The Marina Bay Sands and the Gardens by the Bay and the flower like structure of the Art Science building."
,,Amazing structure,5.0,,This walkway bridge is the quickest way to walk back from Marina Bay Sands across the water to the floating football pitch and on towards Raffles. You can get some great photos as you look back at Marina Bay Sands.

,,A Bridge with a View,4.0,,Not a lot to say here really apart from it being an interesting structure with great views. Access via Marina Sands Shops and the upper concourse which features a lovely pond area. Bridge puts you the other side on the bay near the F1 grandstand and a short walk to the theatres. Forms part of the evening light show at the bay.
,,Beautiful in the night time,5.0,,"Located just outside the Marina Bay Sands, this bridge gives a good view of the surrounding environment. The bridge has its light lit on the evening, so you can take photo of it."
,,"Wish there was a ""Good"" option...",3.0,,"There's an ""Average"" and a ""Very Good"" option. If I could, I'd mark this as ""Good"".
We walked across the bridge. The design and engineering are wonderful... but it is just a bridge (and in super hot humid temperatures). If you're there -- walk across! But would I go out of my way to visit? No. Not that it isn't beautiful, but rather because of a time limit. There's so much to see and do in Singapore that you'd have to live there to see everything!"
,,Appreciate What It Is,4.0,,We are sure that most the thousands of people that have walked across this wonderfully constructed bridge dont appreciate how it is actually put together and what it symbolizes. Take the time and you will be amazed!

,,Nice to walk across on way up to Mount Faber,3.0,,"Climbed Mount Faber (a small hill) from Vivo City and detoured across the bridge about 2/3rds of the way up. Nice views back to the harbour (not the city) and an interesting bridge design.
Worth the detour if you are going up Mount Faber, but in our opinion it is not worth making a trip just for the bridge."
,,Well worth the walk,4.0,,We walked around Marina Bay and Waterfront Promenade on New Years day and used this bridge as a link. Very picturesque with the boats using the waterways.
,,Another show piece.,5.0,,"As most would ask... is this bridge really necessary.?? But hey, most of what we see in Singapore are unnecessary but then then wonders to the eyes. Same is true for this bridge, built not for necessity but to enjoy the possibilities of what Singaporeans can offer to the world. Creating pieces of architecture / buildings for the whole world to be jealous about. A great looking bridge which can be most enjoyed in the night to marvel at the MBS complex and the skyline and the old Bay area of Singapore."

,,First spiral bridge in the World,4.0,,"As many guides state the beauty of the bridge is overshadowed by a nearby Marina Bay Sands hotel, however many people would probably cross it to get to ArtsScience Museum and the said hotel. After dusk the lights come on the bridge and it looks really nice. Symbols of bases found in DNA are on the floor of the bridge and also light up after dusk."

,,"An ""eye-catching"" pedestrian bridge near great ""landmarks"" of Singapore",4.0,,"The coiling-shaped roof and sides of the bridge live up to its name ""Helix"", and you're also pretty much protected from the rain while walking on the bridge by these triangular sheet-like structures above. Be sure to go off to one of the oval-shaped lookout points on one side of the bridge, and you'll be standing at a great vantage point for a panoramic view of the Marina Bay covering great ""landmarks"" there such as the Marina Bay Sands hotel with its interesting Skypark in the shape of a 'boat deck' above, the kind-of-fruit-shaped ArtScience Museum, the central financial district with its super tall 40-to-50-story buildings, the Singapore Merlion with the historic Fullerton Hotel behind it, 'the Durian', and the soccer pitch sticking out into the water with a multi-colored seating area on one side; also the Flyer (Singapore Flyer) can be seen straight ahead if you walk from the side of Marina Bay Sands Shoppes which is right on one end of the bridge.

The best way to get here by public transportation is taking the MRT to Bayfront station (blue & yellow lines), then go up above to the Shoppes (the station is connected underground with the Shoppes) and out of the building on the side (a ""short"" side) a few levels up the escalators from near the skating rink; you'll pretty much be right on one end of the bridge with the other end not far from the Flyer."

,,Review Biology for the DNA :),5.0,,"Appreciate The Helix Bridge, but before you do that, you've got to review your Biology lessons because pairs of colored letters c and g, as well as a and t on the bridge which are lit up at night in red and green.

,,Nice,5.0,,This bridge will link you from Merlion Plaza to Marina Bay Sands and Shops going to Gardens by the bay.
,,Just simply a nice bridge connecting two sides,4.0,,"A nice evening walk to the other side whether from MBS or the other way. Would be a nice spot for a photo of the city or just a nice stroll at night.

Well lit up at night, looks spectacular, however the light do turn off at around 11-12pm"
,,Yes its a foot bridge but a pretty silver one,3.0,,"Seems cities around the globe are completing for the pedestrian bring award, this is a pretty little thing though, protects you from the rain and sunshine and has a view point to view the Art $ Science museum and Marina Bay Sands hotel."

,,An elegant design with lovely views & pretty at night,4.0,,Great location to get a breeze & take all round pictures. Don't forget to look at the bridge construction - it's pretty impressive.
,,Yep - it's a bridge. But also architecturally lovely.,4.0,,"There's not much to say really - it's a beautifully designed pedestrian bridge between the Art Science museum at the Marina Bay Sands, and the floating stage grandstand. As others have mentioned, I'm confused by the reviews that indicate it costs money to walk across - it doesn't - it's free. The caveat is that during the F1 Grand Prix weekend in September, it's closed to anyone who doesn't have a ticket as it's one of the exit points from the floating stage grandstand.
During the day it catches some welcome breeze and during the night it's wonderfully lit up like so much of the Singapore downtown architecture. There are a couple of 'pop out' vantage points for photos that afford nice views.
It's hard to give a bridge 5 stars for a review because that makes it seem like a 'must see' attraction. This isn't a 'must see' but if you're in the Marina Bay area, you're already there so for sure you should go and take a look."
,,Nice place for panoramic evening shots of the city!,4.0,,"This bridge is located right next to the Marina Bay Sands hotel/shopping center. Best advice is to first watch the free water/light show that the Sands offers every evening. Following the show, allow the crowds to thin out and then cross this bridge and enjoy your evening. The bridge has several viewing ""platforms"" along its length that allow for some fantastic photo opportunities of all the attractions ringing Marina Bay."
,,Good vantage point,4.0,,Very good location to get great views (overlooking the Art Science Museum) and photos - instagram-worthy ones. The design itself is pretty cool and futuristic-looking.
,,Nice bridge,4.0,,The best view for this brigde at night. The light is wonderfull. Dont forget to cross the bridge when you are around marina bay.
,,Beautiful scene and good walking place,5.0,,This is the only place in SG I miss so much. I have been there many time and never ever enough. You have to plan the day and at the end you need this place to stop and enjoy slowing walk with good photography at night.
,,Pretty Walk by Night,5.0,,Slightly confused by someone's comment about the cost as the bridge is free to cross. I would suggest going to walk over it at night as it looks very pretty with its twinkling lights in the night sky.
,,Unique and intersting engineering,4.0,,"An interesting part of the walk around Marina Bay, and a unique piece of engineering. It offers some great photo opportunities."
,,toohotforme,4.0,,"Wonderful piece of engineering - my husband admired the quality of materials used and the skill of the workmanship displayed. But pick a cool day to cross the bridge as Singapore's humidity is sapping, take plenty of drinks"
,,Iconic and wonderful.,5.0,,By day or by night the Helix Bridge is on of the most beautiful structures of its type anywhere in the world.
,,Would not advise unless it was a clear day,3.0,,Perhaps we just picked a day when the view was not fantastic as there was a fair bit of smog or mist. The staff did advise that this was the case however we decided to have a look anyway as it was our last night in Singapore. At almost $50 we would not go again if we were in Singapore.
,,best place for photo taking,4.0,,"day or night, you should visit this place, giving you are a different feeling and view, best place to take a pic with back ground of marina bay, the hotel and casino, singapore flyer or garden by the bay"

,,Good,5.0,,We used this bridge to walk from Marina Bay Sands over to the flyer bust stop. In the evening it lights up and is so pretty from the water
,,Unique Bridge,5.0,,This bridge is unique in itself by its shape of helix. It is the linking walk from Marina Bay to Merlion Park. You can have a good time walking over the bridge having different views of the nearby places.
,,NIce to walk,5.0,,Definitely easy to walk across and safe too. Free and plenty of great pictures to take from the whole span.
,,Great walk there,5.0,,"Enjoy the walk along the Marina Bay, won't miss the helix bridge, merllion, sands casino and mall away from the heat !"
,,A see of purple,5.0,,Go at night really pretty with lots of purple lights the view from the top of marina bay sands is even better
,,Nice and Unique Bridge,5.0,,"Helix Brigde is located near Marinay Bay Hotel, Garden Bay, and Merilion Park. From Helix Brigde, you could see clearly Merilion Statue, eventhough looks so small. When the day become night, the view is become great. The View to Marina Bay, or Singapore Flyer. Beside that, you could see and go to Art Science Museum from here. Just take a little walk."
,,A nice walk,4.0,,this is an interesting structure used by locals and tourists alike. It links the city side of the harbor to the gardens by the bay. At night it is all lit up. Again you get lovely views of the harbor from here.
,,Wow factor - big time!,5.0,,An absolutely fascinating and beautiful bridge just by the gardens at the bay and the Skypark so very convenient to experiencing all three in a time efficient way. It is playful yet also amazing in relation to its design. The viewing platforms spaced along the bridge enables one to take really lovely photos of fantastic views in many directions. Of an evening the area is buzzing with life - can't comment on the daytime as did not visit during the day. There is also a very big shopping mall below the Skypark (part of the Skypark which I did not experience however looked to have a range of shops not seen in Britain - so potential for 'original/ different purchases.
,,Nice photographic icon,3.0,,"A modern bridge linking Marina Bay and Marina Centre. Nice for the one who love photography since its built above the river. Can you imagine, the reflection of the building when all the lighting's on? Great!!!"
,,"Ok bridge, not really a tourist attraction",3.0,,"We nearly missed seeing this bridge as we were looking for it from the Singapore Flyer and expected something bigger.

The bridge is nice and everything, and it's an interesting looking architecturally designed bridge, but it's not overly impressive in the day.

It's lit up at night which makes it look nicer, however I don't see what the big deal is."
,,nice for quick photos,3.0,,"a unique kind of bridge, nice for taking photos. but then its not really something you would go on purpose. maybe if you were gona walk from marina bay to the marina centre then its nice for a few photos but thats all. :)"
,,Looks nice and that's sums it up,4.0,,Walked on this bridge at night to the Singapore Flyer. It looks cool at night as it has blue lights. But that's about it. It connects the Float and the Shoppes at the Marina Bay Sands together.
,,Best at night,5.0,,"Beautiful at night,good for photographs,definitely worth a wander across after eating or shopping at Marina Bay Shops"
,,some moment in time,4.0,,really nice at sundown to take a picture or walk on this bridge..you can see the marina bay scene and take the durian es potong at the end of the bridge at the opposite site of the marina bay.

,,Very beautiful at night,5.0,,"It 's so convenience to walk across from Marina Bay Sand ... to Bus Stop at another side at night. It's not hot, great atmosphere and very beautiful with light. You can also see the night light of singapore river from here."
,,"A lovely, if glorified footpath.",3.0,,This is barely an attraction. It's a beautiful modern bridge and it also has cool places to go and take your tourist photos with the city skyline (there are ) but hardly an attraction.
,,I liked the blue lights,5.0,,"Good walk, good views, interesting architecture and lots of photo opportunities around the bay, links the Gardens by the Bay to the city."
,,light in the night,4.0,,the best time to take a picture at the helix brigde on the night. the light very beautiful. recommended place.
,,Helix,4.0,,"Helix bridge. Is truly nakles of marina bay at Singapore, the place is natural visit place for any tourist visit marina bay."
,,Unique design and structure,5.0,,"A unique piece of design that links the Marina Bay with the Marina centre. Its design resembles the human DNA structure. A good place to visit during the twilight hours, for beautiful photography and to have a panoramic view of the CBD"
,,It's a brdge,3.0,,"It's a really cool bridge so if I was reviewing on it based on other bridges it would get 5 stars but if I'm reviewing it based on other attractions then it only gets 3 stars as at the end of the day it's a bridge albeit a pretty cool one.

I really liked the platforms that hang off the bridge, you can use these to get some pretty mega pictures of the Singapore skyline"
,,It's a bridge!,4.0,,"and another example of innovative design to make a bridge interesting - many cities have them these days. Probably not worth visiting in it's own right but is useful to get to the Gardens in the Bay of the Marina Bay Sand Shoppes (and loads of good quality restaurants). So if you are going in that direction then I recommend you use this route because it is different, even if it is just a bridge"
,,Amazing architecture,5.0,,"About a 1-2km walk but so impressively built and well-designed.
The 4 lookout points make for excellent locations to take pictures.
The bridge is better walked during the day as you can see more but equally stunning at night and a different feel when walking there at night.
Recommend taking a stroll on this engineering marvel!!"
,,Wow-factor pedestrian bridge!,5.0,,This bridge has been part of 3 waterfront marina round-trips during our stay and is especially attractive in the evenings.
,,Good link to go visit Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,We walked through this bridge from Marina Bay Sands to go back to our hotel. It is an interesting bridge but quite short.
,,Pretty sights during a leisurely night walk,4.0,,Nice to walk in the night and to see the lights from the various buildings. It is a link bridge from Marina Bay Sands shopping area to the floating platform. Great if you have the intention to walk around the area. There are various spots where you can stop and take in the sights. Can get quite warm in the day. Best to go in the night and see the pretty lights.
,,Great place to sit and watch the world go by as the day comes to an end..,4.0,,"It's a bridge, it works and does what you expect it to do. It is invaluable though if you're trying to get from the Flyer to the Shoppes and I'm not sure how they crossed before the Helix Bridge.. (Without going the long way round..)

It was also good on the morning run out to Marina Barrage and if you're up for the walk, its a nice walk from Clarke Quay out to the bay, across the Helix Bridge and on to the Barrage.."
,,View from the bridge outweighs the bridge itself,4.0,,"If you go to Marina Bay Sands, most probably you will have a stroll on Helix Bridge. In my opinion, the bridge itself lacks special features. It's merely a bridge surrounded by some metallic designs. However, that's not the point to deter you from going there. Instead, standing on the bridge, you can enjoy a super broad view of the most beautiful part of Singapore, from the modern Marina Bay Sands to skyscrapers in Raffles Place, from the iconic Fullerton Hotel to Parliament House. Going in the evening can ensure you the most marvellous view. So, when you go to MBS, don't just stay in the tedious shopping arcade. Go out and stroll on the Helix Bridge!"
,,Cool,4.0,,Definitely a cool walking bridge! Also provides many scenic vistas while on it. Easy way to get across the harbor from the Arts and Science Museum to the Flyer or other buildings.
,,A Helix shaped bridge,3.0,,"Okay, this is a bridge, and I am sure quite a few people have walked over this bridge without even realising that not only does it have a name, but that you can also review it on Tripadvisor. Being the internet geek that I am I can pretty quickly discover these things (as is the case with the fact that I am writing a review). So, it is a bridge, and it is shaped like a double-helix (or something like that) which is some genetic thing that is supposed to define who you are. I never studied genetics, or DNA, so I can't really go into the specifics of it, however what I can tell you is that it is a bridge, and you can write a review about it on Tripadvisor."
,,Helix Bride on the Promanade,3.0,,Walking from the Singapore Flyer to the Promanade or the Marina Bay Sands one has to take the Helix bridge. Looks beautiful in the night with the lights on. A viewing stage at the Promanade side is a great place for photo shoots.

,,an complicated web of stainless steel.,5.0,,"The Helix Bridge, is a pedestrian bridge linking Marina Centre with Marina South in the Marina Bay area in Singapore. It is located beside the Benjamin Sheares Bridge and is accompanied by a vehicular bridge, known as the Bayfront Bridge. Canopies made of fritted-glass and perforated steel mesh is incorporated along parts of the inner spiral to provide shade for pedestrians. The bridge has four viewing platforms sited at strategic locations which provide stunning views of the Singapore skyline and events taking place within Marina Bay. At night, the bridge will be illuminated by a series of lights that highlight the double-helix structure, thereby creating a special visual experience for the visitors. it is a world first in architectural and engineering bridge design. Helix Bridge has both practical and aesthetic purposes. It provides quick access to Marina Bay Sands resorts for pedestrians who are coming from the Esplanade and the City Hall area. At the same time, a walk along the bridge provides unparalleled views of the city skyline. The bridge also provides a good vantage point to watch fireworks and pyrotechnics during special events such as the National Day celebrations. The bridge also functions as an outdoor gallery that displays artwork produced by local youths. Economically, the building of Helix Bridge also heralds the emergence of the Marina Bay area as a waterfront hub. It is part of an 11.7km promenade route that will eventually link Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, the Esplanade, Marina Barrage and the new sports hub as well as their respective office and retail space. It also features the incontrovertible iconic skyline for Singapore. Connecting Marina Centre on one side to the Marina Bay on the other is the unique and futuristically-themed Helix Bridge. You can now walk from the iconic Merlion and end your walk at Marina Bay Sands. Crossing the Helix Bridge, you’ll enjoy a beautiful view of Marina Bay, the Float@Marina Bay and Singapore’s downtown skyline. The structure is beautiful, with an complicated web of stainless steel. It is a great spot for pictures with Marina Bay Sands and Marina Bay."
,,The best way to cross over to Marina Bay,4.0,,"If you are walking from the Mandarin Oriental Hotel over to Marina Bay and over to the Botanical Gardens, then you must walk over the Helix Bridge. Great Architectual design and well worth the walk across with some great Photo-Shots enroute"
,,Very Pretty,4.0,,This is such a cool sight at night. To walk through it is awesome! Great picture sight! Nice area and close to food places.
,,Good photo taking location,4.0,,This is where you can see the modern skyline of Singapore. You can walk from marina bay sands and over to esplanade and Merlin park. Food is plentiful here but do keep in mind that it will be slightly more pricey. You can even buy ice cream from the motorcycle uncle at $1.20.
,,Best at night,5.0,,"If your near the Singapore Marina, Gardens by the Bay or the Singapore Flyer check out the double helix bridge. This bridge looks best at night when different colored lights highlight the structure. This bridge is proof that, sometimes,a bridge is not just a bridge, its more of an architectural wonder. This is certainly one spot for many touristy snaps there are even bridge bays so you can step out over the water for the best photos. You should be able to see and photograph the Artscience Museum and the Marina area as well as Marina Bay Sands Hotel - No 2 landmark in Asia (2015). The Helix Bridge is made up of a major and minor steel helix that wind around each other. If all the steel tubes are laid end to end, it would measure 2,250 metres long. The entire structure weighs about 1,700 tons."
,,Great place to watch the black nights today's.,5.0,,"It a lovely bridge to walk over at night time, good design and pleasant stroll to Marina Bay Sands, great for photos against the night time back drop of the city."

,,Nice bridge!,3.0,,Helix bridge is a good place to click some nice pictures of the marina bay sands and the marina bay reservoir and also the art and science museum.
,,Good spot for photos of financial district,4.0,,"A useful link to walk to the Marina Bay Sands area ... the shopping area, casino, etc, from the group of hotels including the Marina Mandarin, Mandarin Oriental, Pan Pacific Hotel, and others. It is not a tourist attraction in itself, I wouldn't think."
,,Fabulous for strolling at night,4.0,,"Once upon a time, the entire area where Marina Bay Sands stood were just water. The entire area has been reclaimed and today features the undeniable iconic skyline for Singapore. Connecting Marina Centre on one side to the Marina Bay on the other is the unique and futuristically-themed Helix Bridge. You can now walk from the iconic Merlion and end your walk at Marina Bay Sands. Crossing the Helix Bridge, you’ll enjoy a beautiful view of Marina Bay, the Float@Marina Bay and Singapore’s downtown skyline. I much prefer the view at night when the bridge is lighted up together with the rest of the city."
,,Innovative and attractive design and useful to access Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,"A great design and great to use as access to Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the Shoppes and the Science Museum. The bridge allows for photo taking points along its span and there is covering to protect from the elements but gives an air of openness too. At night it lights up in a selection of colours to add to the Bay skyline. No charge to use."

,,great to be here.......! early mornings.. especially around 7.30am..,4.0,,"for tourists not to loose their way.. is to find the mandarin oriental
by cab or park there and walk across directly opposite side of the road.. and walk left from the esplanade.... i seldom take buses but i found this blog..
https://jacquericauy.wordpress.com/2012/07/07/singapore-trip-marina-bay-sands-helix-bridge-merlion-park/

during convention time at suntec city.. most people stay at the marina square group of hotels eg.. pan pacific,mandarin hotel,ritz carlton .. my favourite after a walk along the riverfront ..included the helix bridge..which takes one across to the arts and science museum and the vast shopping complex at marina bay sands area/casino

my personal tip:

after an invigorating walk---i usually go back to the

mandarin oriental for eggs benedict .. large enough for 2 to share
most of the time they include some fruit for us 2 local walkers..
on another occasion ... we found to our surprise a food court at the singapore flyer

there are no toilet stops along this area.. so best is to answer nature's call
several people unfortunately some have done so.. in one area.. underneath some trees...."
,,My favourite place when i go for a run,5.0,,"This used to be my regular running route when I stayed over in Conrad (another fav). this place is densely packed with tourists and locals alike and leads you to marina barrage or marina bay sands, depending on which turn you take. that whole area makes for a great run not only because the view is brilliant which it is as you can see bits and pieces of the skyline, but also makes you want to push yourself harder as you see hordes of people going for their own run. I simply love it. check it out for night view of the marina bay sands hotel, science museum and make sure you pass through it to check the free night lazer show by the bay - that is extremely enjoyable too."
,,Taking a walk on the inside - DNA,5.0,,"Your direct link to capture the best views of Singapore around the bay. Four unique viewing platforms will leave you with some great memories of your time spent here. The Helix Bridge is like taking a walk inside your gene pool - the DNA. At night the bridge is illuminated with coloured letters C, G, A, & T which symbolise the basis of human DNA. The spiral structures which reflect the helix structure are well lit at night and by day act as a canopy against the natural light. Like all things in Singapore this bridge was engineered with great thought taking into account the environment and the emergence of the urban landscape around it."
,,The magic of modern architecture,5.0,,Amazing architecture with a beautiful backdrop - Marina Bay Sands. It's a must-see when in Singapore.
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"As an engineer I found this bridge quit interesting, all polished stainless steel, curved, covered and lights up at night. Easy to find as it links the children's Olympic park to the arts and science museum. Walk across this as part of your walk around the Marina"
,,Use this bridge for great photography,4.0,,This is an amazing bridge and colourful in the evening. There are little areas that jut out for photography shoots.

,,Amazing!,4.0,,Very unique bridge i have ever seen that linking to the marina bay in the central of singapore and one of must go place in singapore
,,Impressive!,5.0,,"This is a footbridge that really makes walking an adventure. At first approach I wondered what it was. On our visit we were able to view small sailing activities on Marina Bay, and it was well worth the walk."
,,Nice place to acknowledge several beauties of Singapore,4.0,,"Helix bridge (to me) acts as a connector bridge between the old Singapore with the newly built Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It is a nice piece of architecture giving a whole new feel & view of Singapore's prime location with several attractions by it. You can get to Marina Bay Sands by Taxi from where you can stroll to the other side through Helix Bridge while clicking eye-catching views from it. You can see the Singapore river, Merlion, most of Singapore famous hotels while walking through it.

It is part of the entire walkway around Marina Bay, which already includes a hotel and a botanic garden.

Fritted-glass and perforated steel mesh canopies provide shade for pedestrians.

The bridge is illuminated at night by a series of lights that highlight the double-helix structure.

The government of Singapore has an extraordinary vision to create a modern, beautiful and friendly city with innovative thinking, in a very organized way and always thinking about the quality of work and life of its citizens.

Dubai's ruler has a equally ambitious vision, but it is not done with good taste, a disciplined sense of organization, and within reasonable budget limits."

Saw this bridge from the Singapore Flyer while tring to figure out how to get to Marina Bay Sands, the architecture is there, obviously they have made an effort to make it look different and we did stop and take a couple of photos on the way but not worth a visit just for the bridge, that would definitely be a waste of time."
,,Great for pictures,4.0,,well visited this place cos it looked so great in the picture and it didn't disappoint. Great piece of architecture.
,,I like it,5.0,,"a nice bridge in Marina bay which you can see the great view for old sky scrappers of Singapore , a great steel structure bridge with magnificent modern engineering"
,,Nice n relaxing walk,4.0,,Nice view and relaxing having a walk there . Connecting both side of the river and marina bay. During the night it is beautiful ! Would rather walk than to take the train!
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The design is beautiful and you get some good views plus plenty of photo opportunities. The helix is supposed to be based on DNA!!
,,Unique and amazing architecture,4.0,,I came through this bridge after watching laser show at marina bay sands started around 8 pm It's a unique bridge with an amazing architecture. It's not only give the function but also an art to admire Many people take some pics here
,,Unique,5.0,,We sighted the Helix bridge from a bumboat at night and also from the flyer. Beautiful colours that light up during the evening.
,,Nice for a few pics,3.0,,"Unless you're big into your bridges this is not something you will go out of your way to see, however it is located right in the heart of Marina Bay and offers some decent photo opportunities.

It's pretty impressive to look at a night, as people have mentioned, but it's most certainly dwarfed in stature by the structures around it. As a bridge though, it serves it's purpose well..."
,,Impressive design,4.0,,"The double Helix bridge was designed by Australian and Singapore architects. Its rather impressive and it has vantage points for photos across Collier Quay, and the Merlion. Only saw it in the day but is lit up at night."
,,Impressive View,3.0,,The Helix bridge is interesting from an engineering and architectural standpoint. It offers great views over Marina Bay and the Central Business district.
,,Amazing Architecture,4.0,,"Amazing architecture, futuristic look. It offers amazing view of Singapore skyline. Many photo opportunities. We took a walk in the afternoon and the view was fantastic. Can only imagine how beautiful it will be at night."
,,Useful when cycling,3.0,,This bridge is quite convenient for cycling when you want to avoid taking the main road. The only trouble is that on the MBS side there is no ramp and so you need to take your bikes in the lift in order to get to the ground level. But once you're on the ground level you can then cycle freely all the way up to the Marina Barrage.
,,"Visit in evening, very good photo taking spot.",4.0,,"After a very tiresome day, we visited Helix bridge and wow, it was such an excellent engineering marvel. One could take many photos here with the Singapore skyline in the back. The views will be beautiful and fantastic. At night one can see the entire area lit up."
,,"It is a bridge with nice view, but nothing more during daylight hours.",3.0,,"We walked on the bridge while we walked from Singapore Flyer to the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, and I felt a bit Nice breeze on the bridge compared to the rest of the walk. It has a Nice view, but I would never do a detour just to walk on the bridge."
,,Special Pedestrian Bridge,4.0,,"Special spiral bridge, while you can see the Ferris wheel, the other side can see the art science museum, this pedestrian bridge connect to the Marina Bay Sands Shoppes."
,,Walk it more than once - both day and night,5.0,,"We walked over the Helix Bridge both during the day and again at night. It is spectacular to enjoy both times. Since it is part of the overall sightseeing/walking experience, be sure to walk it both day and night, enjoying the views both times of day."
,,Nothing special.,3.0,,"this is part of the walk around Marina Bay waterfront and as such interesting, but as independent attraction, I would not recommend it. It's just a bridge, and yes it is lighted in the Night like Many other things in Singapore, and I Would Not rank it as a must see attraction"
,,Innovative,4.0,,The bridge is definitely a great photo venue. You could take so many beautiful shots around here as the lightings and the whole surrounding being lit up in the night just gives the place a different character and truly makes it worth visiting. It is also perfect for strolls in the morning
,,Iconic bridge,3.0,,"Apparently, in Singapore, they love iconic looks. Well this could have just been any other ordinary looking bridge. But they thought otherwise, so you have one hell of a design for a bridge. They also change the color often (stickers I think)."
,,Great night time photo spot .,5.0,,The bridge is great to take photo's of the waterfront area at night time possibly after the laser show . It also acts as a link from hotels like the Ritz and Conrad hotels down to Marina sands complex . Nice to walk or run over during the day .
,,Good place for photo ops,5.0,,"Nicer to visit at night time. You can just wak around to get some picturisque spots of singapore. Aside from good pbotography venue, this place is also recommended for joggers"
,,An iconic bridge for Singapore,3.0,,"If you're into photography you should come down to see this and it's really beautiful especially at night. My tips go under the bridge, there is this sidewalk which you can sit and enjoy the river without too much crowds."
,,Very nice nightview for photoshoot,5.0,,"Was there for my night wedding photoshoot and the colours turned out really nice on the photo, even before editing it. Worth the trip to Helix Bridge and lots of families, tourists and couples strolled on the bridge in the evening time, quite romantic and relaxing indeed. Recommended!!"
,,A must see,5.0,,The Helix is a rare and interesting piece of modern architecture. The views across Marina bay make a stunning backdrop to a very signature photo. Aim for both a day and a night time visit....
,,Distinctive Bridge,5.0,,"This bridge has the wonderful and distinctive construction. It is especially beautiful at night. In the middle of the bridge you can see Garden by the Bay and also Singapore Flyer. It is very near Singapore Flyer, so you can combine the trip to visit it."
,,Pedestrian bridge with a difference,4.0,,"Most modern built bridges go unnoticed, but not this one. It's design is taken from a 'double helix' strand of DNA, making it as unique as DNA itself. The structure looks good in both daylight and when illuminated at night, and it makes for an ideal photo opportunity with the city as a backdrop. We crossed it after visiting the Gardens by the Bay, and it made a pleasant crossing of Marina Bay as part of a walk along the waters edge back to the Merlion."
,,An educational bridge!,5.0,,"This bridge is an amazing piece of engineering and if you are in the Marina Bay Area, it is well worth walking across this structure but take your time. The views are fantastic and at night you will see the entire area lit up...a good photo opportunity.
The helix design is worth studying and don't forget to look at the floor!
You will get good views of the Marina Bay Sands and the science museum. In the distance is the financial district and you will be able to make out the Merlion. If you cross the bridge and carry on walking you will pass by the theatre and look out for the floating football pitch!"
,,Great design with hidden gems!,4.0,,"Why build a boring bridge? Shape it like a left-handed helix and incorporate small details like the four bases of the DNA as cytosine, guanine, adenine and thymine."
,,Stunning and Scientific ;),5.0,,"The views are amazing during the day and night! Very interesting design and very scientific;)) I loved little details on the floor with amino acids:)) I thought it was cool;)
I was very surprised by the relaxed atmosphere there considering it is one of the busiest financial cities in Asia:) it felt like a chilled and calm part of the city:) I look forward to walk across that wonderful bridge again:)"
,,A unique bridge with views to marina bay,3.0,,- A unique bridge design. - Affords some different viewing perspectives into marina bay. - There is very little on the side opposite marina bay sands other than the Ferris wheel.
,,Uniquely Designed Pedestrian Bridge,4.0,,"The Helix Bridge is a modern and uniquely designed pedestrian bridge that connects the Marina Bay Sands to the Marina Center. With its sturdy looking structure and futuristic appearance it is worth visiting for a snapshot. Best seen at night when it is colorfully illuminated, hence, creating a special visual effect."
,,Cool bridge,4.0,,"This is a cool-looking bridge, pedestrians only. Very worth a walk across for the views--and the air-conditioned mall at the end!"
,,Go for a Nightly Walk,5.0,,"The bridge looks quite mundane during the day but comes to life after dark. Combined with spectacular nightly views of Singapore, it's well worth a visit."
,,Awesome view. great walk.,4.0,,The place is really awesome for a short walk. Best to visit at night. Very good venue for a photo session.
,,Awesome structure great for viewing the bay area.,5.0,,"Joggers runners everywhere, make sure to watch out for them while you are enjoying the view. Awesome architechture!"
,,See it at night,3.0,,"It's very pretty all lit up, but it's not an amazing attraction by any means. Enjoy it as part of a long walk at night around the water, there are lots of spots with great views."
,,Perfect for a slow walk at night,4.0,,"Visit the bridge at night! (unless you prefer to be burnt to crisp by the sun in the day)
The Helix Bridge is perfect for a slow walk in the night when it is cool and windy. There are many viewpoints located along the bridge which gives you a clear view of the Marina Bay skyline. You don't have to go out of your way to walk the bridge, it acts as a link-bridge between Marina Bay Sands and the Marina Bay Promenade area. (The Helix Bridge starts at MBS and ends at the Youth Olympic Games park, which is a park full of nothing, really.)"
,,Cool looking to be sure,5.0,,"It's cool. Don't come to Singapore just to see this, but if you need to get from MBS to the theatres, go this way."
,,Unique design,3.0,,We used the helix bridge to reach the Gardens By the Bay from the Flyer. The bridge looks more spectacular at night when it is all lit up.
,,Well engineered,5.0,,This bridge is very nice for a night walk. Also a very good venue for photo ops. I saw a lot doing photo shoots here actually.
,,Great design,4.0,,"The Helix Bridge says a lot about Singapore, it's a unique structure, beautifully designed, artistic day and especially lit at night and is new and bold. Easy walk across the bridge from Marina Bay to the Singapore Flyer. But stop to take lots of photos!"
,,So beautiful at night,4.0,,Very cool and unique bridge across the harbor. Connecting the Marina Bay Sands with the Esplanade the helix is one of the more unique bridges in the world with its undulating and winding helix design. So beautiful at night.
,,Helix Bridge a unique engineering structure,3.0,,It's a passage which most tourist take to reach the Merlion at Marina Bay. The bridge looks beautiful at night when it's lit up.
,,perfect for a night walk,5.0,,singapore is really amazing on making beautiful structures like this. perfect for photo ops because of the views but should be at night time
,,Best walk way you can enjoy,4.0,,Its basically just a bridge but if you take a moment to actually see the design of this thing then you'll appreciate it more I bet. It's especially lovely at night when all the lights are on. We walked this from SG flyer to MBS. Unfortunately it was raining that time but still a lovely experience.
,,Lovely walk,5.0,,We just had a lovely walk at this amazing helix bridge. I wonder why singapore is so good in making simple attractions amazing. This place is recommended to be visited at night. Best for photography too!
,,Perfect night walk,5.0,,"Very good surrounding. Very relaxing. Recommended bikers, joggers and to those who just want to walk around. Best time to visit is at night time"
,,Fantastic realisation !,5.0,,"Just simply love the architecture of this crossing bridge. Looks like Singapore DNA, Modern and wonderful !"
,,Very beautiful,4.0,,"The helix bridge at night is very beautiful and is a great location for taking beautiful pictures of the Singapore many high rises , the Sands hotel, etc. It connects the Sands to the Flyer and the square where you can see the famous ""Merlion"" or a Mermaid with a Lion Head. The bridge is truly an engineering work of art. If in Singapore a must see."
,,Another unique landmark of Singapore,4.0,,"Helix bridge,as the name suggests, is a helix shaped bridge built of glass and steel It is said to be the only one of its class in the World ie the only curved bridge ever built anywhere .It is a new addition to the many unique attractions of a small place like Singapore and was built in April 2010. It is a 2 tier pedestrian bridge and very easy to reach by METRO from Promenade station The well lit bridge looks beautiful from a distance at night and offers a good scenic and panoramic view of Singapore at night Unfortunately, we visited it at day time which was however good for taking photographs.There are five platforms for good viewing and taking photos"
,,Bridge photo op,4.0,,Can get some great selfies on the bridge with the sky line behind you and some photos of the iconic sands hotel in the back ground.
,,Take a selfie here with the helix behind,3.0,,"It looks great from a distance at night- all illuminated. But I prefer the close-up view, inside the helix bridge, during daytime. I took a walk towards the Art Science Museum & the Marina Bay Shoppes area during the day, and it felt nice."
,,"Romantic bridge, yes I agree",5.0,,"I was told that The Helix Bridge has been opted to be the most romantic bridge in the world. When I look far away from the Merlion, it is merely just a simple bridge. But when I really walk closer, i really like the architect and I do love walking along the bridge. The view is very nice too~~~"
,,A nice walk at night,4.0,,"Find some time to have a walk along this really superb bridge. Best time is at night as it wiil be well illuminated. You can see many of the iconic structures of singapore including the Singapore Flyer, Sands hotels etc."
,,Nice place to walk on at night.,4.0,,"Nice place in Marina Bay. It fits very well to the sight. You get great views from there esspecially at night on the bay, the hotel and the business district."
,,Best to see at night !,5.0,,"It's a great way to reach MBS from esplanade !

I first discovered that place while jogging around when it opened a few years back.

I am still impressed that Singapore can produce such amazing jewels of architecture which are nice promenade spots as well.

Feels like a real life piece of sci-fi !!!

Worth a visit!"
,,Another attraction that should also be visited at night,4.0,,"It may not be worth a visit on its own, but it is an interesting structure that adds to the beauty and high-tech character of the area. We traveled the bridge on our bicycle tour and could hardly appreciate it from up close. Probably the best way to visit is to see if from a little distance, especially at night when it is lit up."
,,what a beauty!!!,5.0,,"Beaming with red tunics, the bridge is beautiful at night..Simply strolling around, you get a view of flyer at right and marina bay on the back. Add the end of the bridge, you can enjoy durian flavoured ice creams.."
,,DNA double helix bridge,3.0,,"It was nice at night. I was impressed by the idea of DNA structure. And that's all, you won't missed that if you go to the Marina Bay but not worthwhile to go and see it for its own!"
,,Very interesting. Good views,5.0,,We took a boat cruise on the river and sailed under the Helix bridge. It's a great piece of engineering. Later we walked over it going towards the Singapore Flyer. There are great views in every direction from the bridge.
,,a beautiful spring bridge,5.0,,"My first place to meet overseas clients.

At this place on the day that a lot of people passing by for a morning jog.
many passing including a pet dog. I looked over the lake was beautiful once.

I enjoy the atmosphere on that day even although my client was late.

I have saw the construction of this bridge from one of the movie-making structure of the bridge, I tried myself to jump around on the bridge, if it was swaying. but I believe construction is perfect so there will likely to collapse. hehe.

warm regards

,,.. more beautiful at night,5.0,,"A nice walk after having dinner at the Makansutra Glutton's Bay.. It looks more beautiful at night with all the lights around it. Also felt safe walking through the Helix Bridge on a late night. If I were based in Singapore, this is probably one of the place you'll find me."
,,..even more beautiful at night,4.0,,"This is a pedesterian crossing which leads to marina bag sands.

It forms the shape of a helix and it night it is lit up and the light changes colours.

Worth a walk along the bridge at night to enjoy the sea.breeze and the marina bay skyline..."
,,"Good Design, Dull at Day",4.0,,"I have seen the bridge from afar at night and it looks very spectacular. Sadly I had to reschedule to walk the bridge at day, which became a very dull experience.

The statement that the bridge has overhead glass panels so that we do not have to worry about rainy weather is fake because I've seen the overhead glass panels and they are discontinuous along the bridge."
,,Nice connection from MBS to Merlion,4.0,,The bridge itself is a landmark and attraction. Very nice at night time and a good 20-30 minute stroll pathway from Marina Bay Sands to the Merlion and Makansutra Gluttons Bay.
,,convenient to take pictures and for joggers,4.0,,this bridge connects shoppes at marina bay to the opposite end. Nothing special about the bridge except that you can view the bay area from here and have great photo taking chances. Evening time the whole bridge is lit up . A good path for joggers from avoiding main road.
,,Not really that scenic,2.0,,"The Helix Bridge does not really look like it's a prominent structure in the area. Maybe there is wondrous engineering behind its construction, but it's not that great to look at/be in."
,,Nothing Special,4.0,,"The Helix Bridge was one of my prime interest places to discover in Singapore before I get there. When I reached the place and saw the bridge, I could understand the the Bridge is more known because of the structures that it is closely attached towards. The bridge connects the Promenade MRT Station to the Marina Bay and MBS in particular. I have seen better bridges in other countries so I would say it is just an average bridge and there is nothing to feel excited about. Cheers."
,,A great place to take some photos,4.0,,"This bridge is proof that, sometimes, a bridge is more then just a bridge. It is more of an architectural wonder, it certainly has some good spots for many touristy snaps. The bridge is made up of a major and minor steel helix that wind around each other. If all the steel tubes are laid end to end, it would measure 2,250 meters long. The entire structure weighs about 1,700 tons. There’s a night lighting feature built into the bridge, which can be programmed to create various moods for different events. As you cross the bridge towards Marine Bay on your right is the lotus shaped art-science museum which is worth photographing."
,,Good place for a stroll,4.0,,Recommended for photographers and for those who just want to have a view of the marina bay sands and the sorrounds. Walking and a biking can be done here
,,Gateway to Singapore's Modernity,5.0,,"This bridge is an entrance to multifunctional area of Marina Bay Sands, with many well-designed facilities. The bridge is not an exception. Modern and artistic, the bridge is very beautiful at night rhyming with the whole complex facilities behind it."
,,the modernity of Singapore,5.0,,"Juxtaposed with the hotel, this is a modern landscape masterpiece which showcases Singapore as a very technological, up-scale, artistic and modern city."
,,Unique Bridge With DNA Like Structure,5.0,,"This bridge along Marina Bay to the east of the Marina Bay Sands Structure is a must visit at night while in Singapore. There are so many other special views at night along the bay that you can incorporate with this bridge but if you like hip architecture this is a great place to observe.

The twists and turns in the bridge delight at ever step. The way the lights work along the bridge are fascinating. There was a lot of weddings along the bridge the night we walked it because all of the stunning vistas and photo opps along the way.

If you are lucky, you will see a crazy bicycle with tons of LED lights and music piping from it that add to the quirky experience. If the kids are good, by them an ice cream sandwich at the end of the bridge."
,,This just has to be one of the best small bridges in the world,5.0,,If you are in the Marina Bay area you should stumble on this bridge. It is simply the best looking bridge I have encountered. I wanted to stay there. well worth a shuftie :)
,,Good Design,4.0,,"I was came here at noon, so its very hot here. But the bridge is beautiful with its design and easy to reach. Connected to Marina Sand Bay and very convenience walking here. Nice place to watch around Singapore and take some beautiful picture."
,,Interesting but not amazing,3.0,,"Interesting structure and quite pretty at night when the lights,come. Will appeal to photographers. A convenient way to move around on foot."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"I was living at a hotel close to it still I took the train and got off at marina bay and this was a short walk from there. However, the view is amazing and you can get some great night shots of the skyline."
,,DNA on road,5.0,,Just a view to cover another street of Singapore.. This is a walkable area from marina bay... The beat view is during night.... A must walk to enjoy the beauty view of marina bay...
,,Artistic nature and architecture,5.0,,Somehow the National Parks Board have been able to reach a sweet balance between nature and architecture! Views you can never enjoy elsewhere in Singapore. Worth the effort wearing down your sneakers! Even the most jaded teenager will coo with glee as they romp up and down the Bridge. Go all the way to the Southern Ridges and Hort Park for even more wondrous enjoyments.
,,Free attraction,5.0,,Amazing views and a free attraction. What a winner. Many opportunities for photos too. We walked across with the kids in the heat. They just made it one way.
,,Beautiful bridge with great views of the city skyline and the Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,"The bridge is a joy to walk, with four observation decks as you walk across that allow you to get different angles and shots of the city skyline. At night, it is lit up beautifully, and you can get some great pictures. If you are visiting Singapore, it is pretty hard to imagine that you won't be walking across it at least a couple of times."
,,Very cool bridge,5.0,,Very stylish piece of architecture to cross the Marina Bay Area. Liked the stopping bays along the bridge to rest or take photos.
,,Best to see in the evening,5.0,,"Its good to see that lighted. If you plan to go the the Marina Bay Sands Hotel Skypark, just after that you could enjoy The Helix Bridge walk.
Then you also will see Art Science Museum illuminated. It's lights and music show (not sure at what time started but at 9.00pm stiil last), so worth to plan to see all these three places for one evening."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"This is the best place in Singapore. The architecture of the bridge is most interesting. In the background is another gem, the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. As the first curved , double helix bridge it sports the most unique architecture. Its very beautiful at night with very interesting lighting. A walk down the bridge ( with intermittent breaks to enjoy the picturesque Marina Bay and Singapore skyline) is highly recommended."
,,Amazing iconic structure both day and night time!,5.0,,"Singapore is indeed a modern city with spectacular architectures and iconic building designs. The Helix Bridge is one of them.

We passed by this bridge twice, during early in the morning and at night when the lights of the bridge are lit, and in both times, I was fascinated. The bridge connects the marina bay area and the colorful Marina Bay Seating Gallery going to the Esplanade Theater by the bay. While you're at the bridge, you get to see different awesome views and angles of the marina bay area and the Esplanade theater. I'm sure it's one of those bridges you would want to cross when you get there! :)"
,,Neat Construction,4.0,,"We saw the bridge from ground level and from water level on a boat tour. The bridge has a very neat construction to it. One drawback, it sits right next to a car traffic bridge. It would have been nicer if it was separated a little to highlight the bridge more. I don't know that I would go out of my way just to see the bridge, but it is located right next to several attractions and easy to see in the process."
,,Great Architecture,3.0,,"You'd be awed by the architecture of this bridge. Great photo opportunity of the different tourist attractions in Singapore, particularly at the Marina Bay."
,,Yet another great place to observe the Singapore skyline.,5.0,,This bridge connects one side of Marina Bay with another between the Ritz Hotel and the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. It's a beautiful pedestrian only bridge under the huge ferris wheel and offers great views of the skyline.
,,Good bridge,4.0,,Pedestrian bridge down by the marina bay sands. Would highly recommend a trip down at night and to walk across the bridge. They have a few viewing platforms that come out from the bridge so great places to take some pictures
,,Photo opportunity,4.0,,Its a great piece of architecture to come and see and take pictures. The bridge is just right outside of Marina Bay Sands and connects you to the mall. It's nothing to special but still great for taking pictures. I would recommend coming during the day and at night when it's all lit up.
,,walk this way,5.0,,"Another amazing piece of architecture in Singapore, fun and great photo opportunities in this area. Walk the 4kms around the bay and you will tick of many must dos in Singapore."
,,Interesting but not spectacular,3.0,,"It is just a bridge connecting the Marina Bay area to the Sands Shoppe Mall. However, it is cleverly designed that you are protected from rain by canvas like covers along the whole length. Good to have a walk to view the skyline along the waterfront."
,,Great For Photos,4.0,,This is an artistic bridge great for photographers. We went on a Saturday evening and it was pretty crowded. It has viewing platforms so you can late your time to take photos or simply take the scenery in.
,,"Interesting bridge, but not needed as an attraction.",4.0,,The helix bridge connects one side of the marina bay to the other. Going from the Three Bay Sands towards orchard street. It is a great place for photo taking especially for group photos as there are small nooks that go beyon the bridge over looking marina bay.
,,Futuristic,5.0,,"it's a engineering n architecture marvel. i love the lightings at night. it changes colour together with d singapore flyer. u can capture it both frm d event plaza of MBS. its a breath taking view frm d bridge. d thing that gav me goose bumps is that whoever a heavy vehicle passes by, d bridge will slightly shacks n sway."
,,Amazing architecture,3.0,,Nice walk over. Has some nice lookouts along the way and great for photos of the marina bay sands and the gardens by the bay
,,A nifty little pedestrian bridge,3.0,,"OK, it's a bridge with a slightly funky design. Which is nice but not spectacular. But it is a bridge you are likely to wander over at some point of your Singaporean sojourn given it is a great link from the tourist 'smeg-out' of the Singapore Flyer/DUKW tours area through to the ....err.... tourist 'smeg-out' of Marina Bay Sands and onwards into the business district. So it is highly functional.

One feature of the bridge (which is lit up quite nicely at night) is the viewing platforms along it which make for great photo taking perches. Day or night there are shots to be had from it.

But at the end of the day it is a slightly funky pedestrian bridge...."
,,Way to wonderful evening Life.,5.0,,"The Helix Bridge is situated on Marina Bay & it is finest piece of Steel architecture in Singapore. There is great view of the entire bay , fullerton hotel ,ll tallest building of CBD, Merlion Statue, and the Marina Bay Sands etc etc. The bridge connects the way to wonderful water show , Singapore Flyer , the Marina Bay area and Gardens of the Bay. one can have a wonderful evening around the bridge."
,,Nice Stroll to Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,"We had early dinner at Marina Square and we walked to Marina Bay to catch the Wonder full water show via this pedestrian bridge. This is quite a remarkable bridge especially near dusk with its helices are lit up in series of lights, accentuating its DNA-like design. There are some viewing platforms for unobstructed view of the Singapore skyline as well as the Marina Bay Sands.

It is quite windy at night making the walk pleasant and enjoyable if compared to during midday."
,,Fantastic bridge!,5.0,,"The Helix Bridge for me was one of my favourite pieces of architecture in Singapore. It is like nothing I have ever seen before and I loved the innovative, steel structure. The bridge is fantastic if you like abstract photography as it has amazing angles and shades of light. If you're just an average tourist, it gives you a great view of all the iconic buildings and attractions that Singapore has to offer. The are numerous 'landings' where you can stop and look around the bay and take photo's. You get a great view of the entire bay where you can spot the Merlion Statue, the grandstand they use in Formula 1, the Art Science Museum building and the Marina Bay Sands. The bridge connects the Singapore Flyer to the Marina Bay area and Gardens of the Bay so it is something you are bound to come across anyway...do yourself a favour and take a walk on it."
,,Suprise Chinese New Year Fireworks,5.0,,It is a greatly innovative bridge shaped like a DNA model. On Chinese New Year Eve we were suprised by a great firworks display on top of the bridge to our delight.
,,Awesome,5.0,,We went up to the viewing deck and views across the city for anyone visiting Singapore it's a must do attraction
,,Innovative and Artistic Bridge Structure,4.0,,"Innovative and artistic bridge structure. I have never seen like this before.

It is great place to take a picture with other attractions as your background around the Marina Bay Area. The attractions are:
1. Marina Bay Sands
2. Art Science Museum (lotus flower shaped building)
3. Bay Grandstand (Formula 1) - picturesque waterfront stretch
4. Gardens by the Bay
5. Singapore Flyer

It has an elevator for people with disability (PWD)."
,,DNA Bridge,5.0,,"As a doctor,helix equals DNA .a genius creative and innovative architecture that is unique in the field of bridges construction"
,,Nice,4.0,,It has a great view of the city and nice structure to stroll. We ate at MakanSutra which is near at the very end of the Helix Bridge.
,,Marvelous Marvelous Marvelous,4.0,,Yes indeed it is Marvelous place to be in i gotta be pack in the near future i enjoyed the tour from the top i hope my friends and relatives come to visit the Helix Bridge

,,Nice looking bridge,4.0,,Basically a bridge but lovely encircling design Looks good and modern Goes from marina sands shopping area to raffles road via floating expo area
,,Unique Helix Bridge,5.0,,Great views as you walk from Singapore Flyer area over to the Marina Bay Complex. Only did the walk in daytime. Night time views should be a new experience.
,,An obvious visit if at Marina Bay,4.0,,"This is not exactly a sight seeing place but is a part of the walk around Marina Bay area. This bridge connects the Merlion area to the Marina Bay Sands area or the Singapore Flyer.

Good place to include for a walk and take pictures. There is no charge."
,,Architectural Beauty,5.0,,"It's a bridge, but an amazing looking bridge at that. We went here at night which I believe is the best time to go as the lights give it that much more beauty and the you do not have to endure the heat of the sun. Do take time to drop by here and have your picture taken, you will not regret it. The view of the bridge is just marvelous in person!

Suggestions:
- Take the MRT to Bay Front and head over to Marina Bay Sands Shoppes and go the top floor to grab the best view. The art & science museum is located closely to it as well.
- To save time in your itinerary since you're in the area, Make sure to watch the light and water show in marina bay sands promenade. (8 pm and 9 pm)"
,,It's just a bridge,3.0,,"A mate and I were taking a stroll coming out from the Marina Bay Sands Mall and wanted to make our way to Suntec City. The weather was really hot and humid. We crossed the Helix Bridge and were rather amazed that people would stop and take pictures along the way. It was just like any other bridge honestly.

What made the little walk interesting was this ice cream vendor that had an ice box mounted to his motorcycle and he had this amazing array of flavors. This guy apparently doesn't station himself at any particular spot and it was just our luck I guess. I've seen several of these guys before but have never been curious enough to see what it was all about.

I tried the chocolate flavored ice cream, wasn't spectacular, hardly what I'd call chocolate flavored even but what was most interesting was that it came served on a slice of bread! Do eat it quick because the heat and humidity melts ice cream really quickly!"
,,A uniquely designed bridge- worth looking at if you're in the area or to use to walk where you want to go!,4.0,,"Writing a review about this bridge is rather like writing a review of any carefully designed and engineered footbridge- for example the Millenuium Bridge In London.

Essentially, it's a functional piece of engineering, which has been given a twist!

It looks different to any other footbridge you've seen.

It's a photo opportunity.

Also, it is functional- for someone on a walking tour or a stroll.

And, if does deliver an interesting aesthetic solution!

Frankly, unless you have a special interest, I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this landmark, but it is interesting to see when you're in the vicinity."
,,An Architectural Marvel,5.0,,"Linking Marina Bay to Marina Centre, the Helix Bridge, 280-metre pedestrian link way – longest in Singapore is the world’s first ‘double-helix’ structure, a curved bridge. It resembles the structure of DNA.

One of the connecting bridges will link the three waterfront gardens at Marina South, Marina East and Marina Centre, to form a continuous public waterfront loop, while also linking the Double Helix Bridge to the Marina Bay Sands, the Singapore Flyer and Gardens by the Bay.

One can catch a panoramic view of the Singapore skyline and watch events taking place at the Bay from one of its five viewing platforms sited at strategic locations. Fritted-glass and steel glass canopies providing shade and seats are also available at resting points. View paintings and drawings by youths along this crossing, or enhance your bridge crossing experience at night with lights that illuminate the steel structure to create different moods. For a memorable experience, be sure to visit this engineering marvel situated in the heart of the city."
,,Top spot!,5.0,,"The Helix is connecting the Esplanade area and the Marina Sands / Gardens by the bay area, you won't notice it much during the day time but give it a try after the light show along the Marina Sands area, walk up there towards the Esplanade area for a quick supper!"
,,"Yep, it's just a bridge",3.0,,"Was surprised to see this as 'an attraction'. It looks ok when lit up at night and I'm sure it's very technical being a DNA-like double helix Tourist choice attraction winner?! Slightly over the top or maybe they just asked the architects for an opinion! It's very useful for crossing the water, good job. Give yourself a pat on the back, tick it off in your guidebook and go and see the ridiculous Merlion."
,,an architectural marvel!,5.0,,"The Good =)
~Beautifully designed & built.
~Great place to take gd photos of 'Marina Bay Sands'.

The Bad =(
~Nicer to see at night instead of during the daytime.
~Requires some walking & may not be suitable for the elderly.

My Tip for future visits:
~Go during times with less sun, it will make your walk easier."
,,brilliant design and engineering!,5.0,,"This is a fantastic bridge and the reversed helices are very cleverly engineered. You also get a great view of the city, and if staying in the Raffles Boulevarde area it is a quick link to Marina Bay Sands / Gardens by the Bay, etc... At night it looks spectacular, and the lights with the a,g,c,t are cute and add to the whole DNA experience. Well done Arup and all involved in the project :) (there is a plaque at the Floating Stage end)"
,,Walking Through DNA !,5.0,,Nice design of the bride that looks like DNA ! It's good to visit both day and night. (But night scene will be crowded.) The starting point (near Floating Stage) is the best location to shoot and you will see all building & scenery around Marina Bay. Don't miss !
,,A great spot for panoramic views,4.0,,"Although not a tourist attraction in itself, the Helix Bridge is a great place to take in panoramic views of Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore city skyline.

It’s a great alternative, or complement, to the usual tourist shots taken from the Merlion as you get a spectacular view from a fresh perspective of the entire bay area.

If you don’t have a lot of time on your hands, it’s a short and easy walk from Marina Bay Sands and offers three viewing platforms from which you can take some iconic happy snaps. If you have time to spare, you could incorporate it as the final stop of a leisurely stroll up the Singapore River. It’s probably best to visit in the late afternoon or evening, not only to avoid being parched by the unforgiving Singapore sun, but also as the skyline and the bridge itself look wonderful all lit up.

Put it on your to do list!"
,,A unique experience - just walking on the Helix Bridge,4.0,,"As i am fond of bridges, I am very much attracted to the Helix Bridge, along the Marina Bay area.

When you next visit this area - Marina Bay area - where the Esplanade, the Marina Bay Sands Resort are located, do take a leisurely walk along this very unique structure - the Helix Bridge!

The structure of this bridge is one of its kind and it has a interconnecting look - at night, the same bridge is lighted up and it looks even more attractive when the sun sets!

It is a very modern bridge and it provides a very spectacular view of the Marina Bay area - with all its attractions and the Singapore skyline from this part of our pretty island.

For me, a true blue Singaporean - just strolling along the Helix Bridge is a lovely experience as I admire the skies, the seas and the newer part of Singapore - may I invite you, especially first time visitors to Singapore - to just come and see and experience Helix Bridge for yourselves?

I am quite sure you will not regret this experience which you can bring home with lots of fond memoires and pictures as souvenirs too!

Happy Visit to our sunny island, Singapore!"
,,Looks great at night when the the light display is lit up,4.0,,"Unless you are staying at Marina Bay area I would recommend that you see this bridge at night, during the day it is nothing special but at night the Helix bridge lights up and is one of the many night time light displays in the Marina Bay area. The whole Marina Bay area is beautiful at night with all of the lights from the surrounding buildings, structures and gardens."
,,Stunning view!,5.0,,"you should visit this bridge when the sun goes down! amazing view and photo spot, i will great when the marina bays sand start the laser show! A Must Visit!"
,,Great architecture,4.0,,Well worth the walk. Gives a different perspective on views of Marina Bay Sands and the business district
,,strolling at helix bridge,5.0,,"when i visited singapore, i really opt to visit their well known bridge, the helix bridge..because as i check in the internet, that was really great.there are many reviews too, that bridge was so nice then because it built in a different way,it connected to Marina bay precinct. when you get there side by side u saw a different places, its good to have a good shots.when at night, its really amazing, the lights really catch your attention, nice design, superb view, fantastic!"
,,Beautiful !,5.0,,"To be frank - its just a bridge built in a different way but the view from every point in the bridge is amazing. Flyer on one side , Marina bay sands , arts and science museum on the other. Looks best at night with the lights on. Lights reflecting in the water makes up for a beautiful sight. The architecture of the bridge is great. Best place in Singapore to be at night. Must visit !!"
,,A great connection between marina Bay and Suntec Convention precinct,5.0,,"This beautiful stainless shell structure links the Precinct around Suntec Convention Centre and the Marina Bay precinct. There are many places along the way to get some good shots of Marina Bay Sands, the Science Centre and across to the Fullerton Hotel and Merlion Park."
,,Amazing in pic,5.0,,"At first, Maybe you saw it as an ordinary bridge. But when u capture some photos of it in night, huwaaaaa daebak. Nice design, superb view.. fantastic i like it!"
,,Nice and scenic place for after dinner stroll,4.0,,This bridge connects the Marina Bay Sands to the other side of the Marina bay area. It lights up after dark and stay lighted till late. Both ends of the bridge are good photo spots at night. It is also a nice place to take a stroll after dinner to avoid the tropical heat of the day.
,,"Modern Art? A Bridge? No, both!",4.0,,"This really is more than just a bridge

Yes, you can walk from one side to the other, so it is a bridge. However, when every other person is taking a photo of it, it becomes a cracking piece of modern art

The bridge is very shiny which appealed to me, please it save me walking all the way around the marina!

I wouldn’t say this is a 'must-see', but it really is pretty funky"
,,Amazingly shaped bridge!,5.0,,"I loved this bridge, its shape, its lights, and the fact that if allowed me to get some of the best views in Singapore by night. Right in the Marina Bay, and connecting right to the shopping mall entrance, it is a place that everyone that goes to Singapore must walk and discover."
,,Beautiful at Night,5.0,,We managed to see the bridge as we walke from Gardens by the Bay during dusk and decided this was a must see in the evening especially with The Flyer on one side and the Artscience Museum to the other. Nighttime is a must see as the whole if Singapore lights up an further emphasizes what a beautiful city Singapore is. The Helix Bridge connects MBS to Marina Cove and it is beautiful to see and walk across and also an ideal place to take some lovely photos.
,,If you like harbors and architecture...,4.0,,"The helix bridge is an iconic symbol of the contemporary ambitions of Singapore. From either the Mandarin Oriental or the Four Seasons, this is a beautiful walk (when the sun is going down, as is the heat) with a great view of the CBD and Merlion Park. It connects to the Marina Bay Sand shopping center as well as the ArtScience museum."
,,Helix Bridge,4.0,,"If you go or leave the Marina bay don-t take the MRT and head to Esplanade via the Helix Bridge.
Like all parts in this area do it by night as lighting is beautiful.
Stop at some points to take photo opportunity and gorgeous view of the Marina"
,,Just A Bridge,3.0,,"It's a bridge linking the Esplanade side of the river to the Marina Bay Sands side of it, no biggie."
,,Helix Bridge,5.0,,An modern work of architecture or art. A perfect blend where art and architecture with stunning views around. Needed to be experienced at day as well as night.
,,Take It When Going From One Side of the Bay to the Other,4.0,,"It's a wonder of architecture. It's look in shiny metal and glass makes it ultra-modern-looking. Its spiral design makes you feel you're literally traveling into space. hence its name refering to the famous eponymous nebula, I assume. If you are intending to take the long walk that will lead you from a side of the bay to the other e.g. from the MBS hotel/Gardens by the Bay to the Merlion, this is a must-do!"
,,DNA bridge,3.0,,"Cool bridge to walk on as you cross the water. Made to resemble a strand of DNA, it lights up at night."
,,Helix Bridge - Creatively designed and aesthetically appealing structure,4.0,,"The Helix bridge is one of several impressive development projects found at Marina Bay in recent years. It is 280 meters long and links Marina Center where you find the Esplanade, Suntec City Mall and Singapore Flyer to the collection of developments at the Marina Bay Sands location.

We recently walked this bridge, which resembles a DNA strand and enjoyed its interesting design and shape. There are several viewing platforms that extend from the bridge towards the marina, each offering 270 degree views. As the bridge shape is slightly curved, each platform affords you slightly different perspectives of the marina area and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which rests in the background against the Helix Bridge.

Like most of the Marina Bay attractions, there are lights that illuminate the structure at night so that you can see it better from the promenade areas. Further, the bridge has some canopy coverage if you find yourself here when the rains occur, which is a real possibility in Singapore.

Overall, we really enjoyed this bridge and look forward to seeing it and walking it many more times in the future. Just one more reason to spend time in the Marina Bay area."
,,Great view of the city,4.0,,Fun design and excellent way to get from the Esplanade to Marine Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay. Some very good viewing decks are dotted along the way.
,,Great Views,4.0,,Interesting and great views. beautiful night scene of Singapore City. A good walk down to view the city lights and singapore river.
,,Unique design!,5.0,,It's the only bridge which connect to the Marina Bay Sands and the Arts Science Museum from the Esplanade or the Singapore Flyer. The perfect view to see the whole part of Singapore city. Great place to walk in the evening but it can be too hot on day time.
,,"Yes, it's just a bridge, but lighting makes it lovely",4.0,,"Great photo op, and a pleasant walk between the Marina Bay Sands and the Marina Center. Make sure to go in the evening when it is lit up."
,,beautiful architecture,4.0,,"We took a loong walk from Gardens by the Bay and our next stop was Singapore flyer, so we have to walk through this bridge to get there.

I get awesome views of the surroundings, MBS, Marina, flyer, etc in every step

there is an elevator at the MBS side of the bridge to have access for wheelchairs and strollers.

take the afternoon walk here... it will be great :)"
,,Must walk here,4.0,,Experience this bridge at night to see the amazing views of Marina Bay. This bridge links the Marina Centre and Bay areas and gives access to the mainland.
,,Awesome,4.0,,Great architectural bridge with a overlook and pod to take a picture toward the art science museum and the maria bay sands. Simply unique and awesome
,,Very special brigde,3.0,,"When you walk around the marine you look at this bridge, and first when you comes near you will see how special it is. We were a little unlucky as it was a rainy day when we visit it. Probably much more beautiful in dark"
,,The best Bridge to see the bay,5.0,,Love the construction and the glass details. Its an architecture wonder. its a great way to enter Marina Bay Sands. Experience it at night as well.
,,Not so great,3.0,,"Just another birdge i would say ... Looks nice at night when lit up , but nothing much as such . Just a place to enjoy a nice walk and look around , click few pics may be ."
,,Fantastic architecture,5.0,,Great idea for a pedestrian bridge is looking futuristic if u are in Singapore can make a walk and look at the details
,,Scary in the rain!,4.0,,"Interestingly-designed bridge across Marina Bay, affording excellent views across the Bay from the viewing platforms. A much more pleasant link from the Marina Bay Sands Complex and Art Science Museum to the Singapore Flyer than trudging along the traffic-filled Bayfront Avenue.

Like most of Singapore City, the pavements are of polished stone and are very slippery when wet - and I happened to cross the bridge in a torrential downpout and nearly ended up on my [--]."
,,Interesting Architecture,4.0,,"A very complexly constructed bridge near the Marina Bay Shoppes, from a design and engineering point of view this is amazing (to me). Not particularly practical in a city that rains as the shelter is minimal."
,,Architectural Glamour,3.0,,"The helix bridge itself is a pedestrian bridge linking Marina Bay Sands to Marina Square/Singapore Flyer area. The whole DNA concept of the helix bridge has a high aesthetic appeal, eye-catching physical structure that will appeal to both tourists and locals alike. Despite its aesthetic appearance, it is not that functional in my opinion, as it has poor shelter to rain.

The helix bridge gives a picturesque view of the Marina skyline and it leverages on it by creating special platforms on the bridge dedicated specially for photographers. I thought that the best time to visit the helix bridge will be evening/night time when the sun is about to set and when the LED lights came on. I have to agree that it's really beautiful and stunning at night.

Verdict: Come only in the night time because the bridge serves no purpose in the day. The overall experience will be leverage only when the lights came on and as it is an open air structure, do remember to bring along an umbrella just in case it rains."
,,Interesting.,3.0,,"Like so many other things in SG - an interesting combination of modern design and technology. This review is not letting me submit the above without saying ""what I like and dislike "". It's a bridge. It's nice to look at and walk across. It doesn't go anywhere significant. Ok??"
,,One of a kind,5.0,,"Truly magnificent, its artistic design combined with excellent workmanship had created this awesome beauty. The transformation of this area is greatly enhanced by this unique bridge. Worth the time to visit it."
,,Great pedestrian bridge to enjoy Singapore view,5.0,,"Pedestrian bridge linking marina centre and marina south. Just walk in this bridge and you will enjoy the great view of singapore. You can see Merlion, Singapore Flyer, Singapore view and etc. Recommend to visit at night for better pleasure. This briidge also integrated to Marina Bay Sands and Garden by The Bay."
,,Really nice for an evening walk,5.0,,"Excellent construction and really nice for a cool evening walk.You can take some brilliant snaps with singapore flyer,museum and all in the BG."
,,Unique Architecture,5.0,,I have seen it rated as one of the top 5 bridge designs in the world. It is certainly unique and if you are into design worth the visit.
,,Out of this world ....,5.0,,"I wouldn't normally review a bridge but this is a beautiful piece of architecture - a fine addition to an area packed with extraordinary landmarks (which seems rather a dull word for sights seemingly dropped to earth from another planet): Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, Esplanade Theatre, the science/art museum and Singapore Flyer. The designers/architects combined both form and function and have provided a sheltered and speedy way across the river. However, for newcomers to this sight, any time you may have saved will be spent at the destination end of the bridge, gazing at it in awe and wishing you had brought a wide angle lens."
,,Amazing piece of architecture,5.0,,The Helix Bridge caught my eye while walking around the Singapore Flyer and because I wanted to go to the malls of the Marina Bay Sands I had to go over the bridge anyway. It is really lovely designed and offers enough spots to take a panorama photo of the town or enjoy the scenery of the Marina Bay complex.
,,Functional work of art,5.0,,As a welding inspector slash engineer this is one of my favorite places to walk to in of Singapore. It is worth the walk and sits in view other notable landmarks that showcase this amazing city. Take note of the ground smooth welds and imagine the calculations required to design and test these joints. Also be sure to view it at night too.
,,Practical and Beautiful Bridge,4.0,,This very modern looking bridge not only looks great but offers a very practical way of crossing the river on foot. The bridge is easy to access from the Marina Bay Sands area and leads across the other side of the water. We used to bridge to walk from Marina Bay to the Singapore Flyer in about 10 to 15 mins (a nice walk too!). The bridge offers fantastic views of the Bay Area. The bridge also has several protruding viewing areas which is a great little touch. The bridge is of course free to cross and is a great feature of the Bay Area.
,,Nice Strucutre,4.0,,"Very nice architecture, the walk allow you to enjoy the scenary around Marina Bay, at the same time, enjoy the unique architecture of the bridge. Also, the bridge will bring you into Marina Bay Sands to start another new journey of fun."
,,Very relaxing walk,5.0,,"It was close to 11 in the evening when we walked along the bridge but we felt no less safe. Tourists mostly populated it at that time, with cameras attesting to this fact.

From raffles avenue the bridge crosses to marina bay sands' the Shoppes. Along the bridge were at least three stops jutting out where one could stay and look out to appreciate the view."
,,Helix is ??,3.0,,"Just a walk way across the river. the railings & roof are covered by crisscrossing beams which look like DNA structure!!
at night time those helix are lighted-up & looks better.
Good part is it has 3 view points, over the river & has good views of waterfront, Merlion, museum, Marina bay sands...."
,,a funny and unique bridge,3.0,,"I'd like to use ""funny"" and ""unique“ to describe this bridge. It looks very beautiful at night. To walk on was a nice experience."
,,Walkway between Singapore Flyer and Marina Bay Shops,5.0,,"A most interesting geometry of shapes affording views to both Flyer, Marina Bay, and Harbour front around Fullerton Hotel, only partially covered offers no real protection from sun or rain.
Makes a usefull shortcut rater then going back to Promenade MRT which is nearly 1km beyond the Flyer, coincidently route from MRT is not signposted to Flyer."
,,bridge across singapore river,3.0,,Its a bride conecting marina bay to esplande. Nice to walk during night. You can see Lit CBD & marlion park etc .
,,See this whilst going to marina sands,4.0,,"I stumbled across this architectural delight whilst wandering around to find the shopping centre, the closest MRT is Promenade. There was an educational wall with children's art work which leads to the bridge and a nice panoramic view of the bay, floating stadium and view over to raffles boulevard. At night the bridge lights up which is pretty, and you get a good view of it from a boat tour.

I would suggest walking across this bridge to access the shopping centre or arts science museum."
,,Great Bridge,4.0,,"Love the design of this bridge, undercover in parts and viewing balconies for the avid photographer."
,,Inspiring Design for a walkway bridge,4.0,,"For a simple walkway from Marina Bay Sands its pretty impressive. Its a twisted mass of wire and steel that creates a uniform helix shape. Set against the back drop of the Art Science Museum, Marina Bay Sands and the CBD city back drop. Its has some great photo points and in the evening, with the city lights and spotlights reflecting off the positioned glass shields/ panels, some great opportunities for the budding photographers!"
,,Nice views of MBS,4.0,,We have crossed this little bridge many times on our trips to Singapore. I would recommend going during evening or night as you can see all the lovely lights (they change) on the bridge and around. You can take interesting photos of the MBS from here.
,,Nice view,4.0,,"You get a pretty good view of the bay area & the floating stadium. Good on sunny days but on rainy days, the shelters are useless. Singapore has alot of rainy days so I think it would be better if they improve the shelters."
,,Eye catching piece of architecture!,4.0,,"Another one of Singapore's interesting pieces of architecture, we enjoyed a leisurely stroll across the bridge which is a sight in itself but also provides some amazing views across the bay and of the flyer, gardens by the bay, skypark and arts & science centre. Excellent place to take photos from both day & night."
,,Link to micro-life,4.0,,The architecture is both exceptional and meaningful. Walking across this bridge to get awed by the meticulous civil engineers of this country and feel more connected to life at the molecular scope.
,,Stunning! Work of art and architecture!,5.0,,"Made the walk across the Helix Bridge on our way to the Singapore Flyer. It's a marvel to view. And the views of the harbor and skyline of Singapore are magnificent. And, of course, it's free! Don't miss it!"
,,a night visit is preferable to see the lights and the magnificent view,4.0,,the changing lights color of the bridge and the way it is built. very well handcrafted with a magnificent design. a must see if you visit singapore.
,,Architectural excellence,5.0,,"The helix bridge is an architectural excellence and worth the walk, be in it in the day or the evening hours. Interesting are those amino acids that are mentioned and that gets light. Quite interesting! The view from the platforms is a visual treat. Be it the banking hubs, marina bay sands, Singapore flyer or the float at marina bay. The view of Merlion on the other end is an icing on the cake.
Evenings are the ideal time to spend at this place. You can see people who jog amidst kids who are awed by the arts and science museum visit, kids posing for photographs, men who take a nap on the cemented slabs.
If you are shopping crazy walk into the Marina Bay Sands that have shops that includes Harley Davidson, Ferrari, LV, Prada for the brand obsessed Singaporeans."
,,Interesting Architecture,4.0,,"A very unique piece of architecture, but I suppose we should be surprised when you consider its part of the awe inspiring MBS hotel complex. Its a pleasant, and pleasantly cool way to get to MBS from Promenade MRT station. There are viewing platforms along the side, overlooking Marina Bay, MBS hotel and the Museum, as well as the financial part of Singapore and surrounding attractions. Worth the walk, have a look, and take some pics."
,,Fun but not necessary,3.0,,"The helix bridge is an interesting piece of architecture, but if you are just visiting for a few days, you can give it a miss. The view that you get isn't really any different from MBS or the Flyer.

It being free is a bonus, and it leads to the YOG park."
,,Pretty Helix-ed walk,4.0,,"The bridge is a nice, relaxed and pretty place with good views of the Bay, and makes for excellent photo-spots"
,,"unique design, and it's FREE",4.0,,pretty sight from MBS and it's great when the light come on at night. walk across for a great view of MBS from the other side.

,,Unique design,4.0,,"The bridge is of unique design, and it was nice walking along the bridge as you get to enjoy the nice surrounding scenery. It is one of the main attraction at Marina Bay region."
,,Sweeping across the horizon,5.0,,"This bridge is not only useful for pedestrians travelling from esplanade leading to Marina Bay Sands, The structure is immensely impressive twisting metals and view points overlooking the business district of Singapore. The design and the construction is a a joint project of architects in Australia and Singapore. Get your wide angles ready for the sweeping views towards MBS. With a little bit of imagination from afar it looks like a wave and Noah's Arc from afar."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Beautiful Nice look out points Shakes a bit with passing traffic
,,Beautiful Unique Bridge,5.0,,"Beautiful structure and unique bridge of Singapore linkage to Marina Bay Sands Hotel wll connected, easily accessible to the art science museum, shops and restaurant. Very nice skyline and night scenery background overlooking from the Singapore Flyers."
,,nice,4.0,,"Its a bridge, made from metal, connecting one bit of land to another - therefore generally fills its criteria as a bridge. Bridge spotters will have a thrilling adventure, but for me, well its a nice bridge - cute?"
,,beautiful night scenery,5.0,,great night scenery fr the bridge. the bridge is accessible fr MBS n connect u to another side of MBS.
,,Easy Access To Marina Bay Sands and Esplanade,5.0,,"Staying at the Mandarin Oriental, this bridge provided quick and convenient access to Marina Bays Sands shops and the art science museum as well as the esplanade. It's very pretty at night too."
,,Inspiring Structure,5.0,,The structure is inspired by the formation of helix.How often can u make something so micro tiny to be so large that you can walk through it? Amazing when we see the beauty of something we never had interest in. :)
,,Part of the Marina Bay walk,4.0,,Nice bridge for photos while doing the walk around Marina Bay
,,Excellent structure!,5.0,,Structure of the bridge is excellent and the view is wonderful in the evening... Nice!
,,The Beautiful Helix Bridge,4.0,,"The design of this bridge is very beautiful, but up close, the effect is not quite as strong as it looks from a distance."
,,An Amazing Piece of Architecture,4.0,,"A magnificent bridge, to say the least. Shaped like a DNA helix, it links the Marina Bay to the Marina Center. We had the pleasure of walking through it on the way to the Center and I was awestruck by the design."
,,Nice walk,5.0,,Very cool bridge. Makes for good evening or night walk. Perfect spot for pictures or enjoy people-watching.
,,Beautiful way to see the Marina Bay,4.0,,"The Helix Bridge is a relatively new pedestrian bridge along the Marina Bay. It starts near the Shoppes at the Marina Bay Sands and ends at the opposite end of the Bay, close to the road.

The bridge itself is beautiful but it also offers a great view of the Bay from multiple angles. Lots of people with cameras and tripods taking pictures, as well as runners getting some exercise."
,,Additional Attraction to Marina Bay,4.0,,"The bridge is a recent attraction to Marina Bay. Although it is just a pedestrian bridge, it lights add to the vibe of the bay. Being at the bridge will give you a spectacular view of the whole place surrounding it as well. Can be a great place to watch fireworks but the whole stretch is not fully covered so it can't provide you the shelter that you need if it rains."
,,"Cool bridge, easy walk pleasant views",3.0,,Admire the design and enjoy the views. Very straightforward walk.
,,Be Awed,5.0,,A panoramic view from the Helix bridge using photosynth http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=a99aa296-c58a-42d6-a4e1-f3180dd4e781 You will need Microsoft Silverlight to see it in 3D - be awed by the view
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Lovely well done bridge. Walk the length to get to Marina Bay Sands.
,,A Unique Pedestrian Bridge,3.0,,You can have spectacular views of Marina Bay and Singapore CBD from this bridge. The bridge itself is unique and magnificent.
,,A Great Place to See the Raffles Place Buildings,4.0,,"The Helix Bridge is a pedestrian bridge (opened in 2010) linking the Youth Olympic Park with Marina Bay Sands. The Bridge allows you to walk around Marina Bay safely and to enjoy the spectacular views of the buildings around Raffles Place. You can also get a similar view of the Raffles Place buildings on the lower boardwalk in front of Marina Bay Sands.

Of course, the view from the Sands SkyPark would be much better than on the Bridge (or from the lower boardwalk), but you pay SGD $20 for that privilege.

Many of the mapping services (Bing, Google, Gothere) have not put The Helix Bridge on their maps, so I have uploaded a map which will help travelers figure out where this Bridge is.

http://www.scribd.com/doc/59846467/The-Helix-Bridge"
,,Magnificient,5.0,,"1) The view of this bridge is absolutely SUPERB.
2) The most sophiscicated bridge in the world.
3) With the background of Singapore Flyer and Marina Bays on the bridge,snap photo is a compulsary thing to do.
4) Varieties of colours at night throughout the bridge is definitely breathtaking scenery."
