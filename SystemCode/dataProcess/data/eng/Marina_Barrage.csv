,,Fantastic place with great views,4.0,,"It‚Äôs free and with great views. This is a great place to visit for kite-flying, cycling and strolling in an open space."
,,Scenic Place,4.0,,"This is a nice place to visit and sit around. From here, you can look out to the scenice beauty of Singapore's town area. Only down side is that there is no food choices at the barrage."
,,bichon club picnic,5.0,,"we had a bichon club picnic at this barrage and even though the guards say we cant place a picnic table there, we actually went ahead and they didnt chase us away. its a great place for picnics."
,,Nice view,4.0,,I used this bridge to pass through one side of the city to the other. I believe your taxi adds six dollars toll to your trip if you use this bridge
,,Recreational Engineering!,4.0,,The Marina Barrage is just a short walk from the Gardens by the Bay and is both a flood barrier and water supply facility for Singapore that is cleverly disguised as a park and recreational hub! Worth a detour from the Gardens if you have enough time!
,,Great views and a nice grassed area where locals fly kites,4.0,,We enjoyed the views from the Marina Barrage and got some great photos. We did a two hour mini segway tour around Marina Bay area but it would be great to walk around the area. We enjoyed seeing lots of locals flying kites from the grassed area over the Easter weekend.
,,Tremendous place ot see the skyline,5.0,,"Good viewing point for the city and some of the coastal bike rides start/end here. visited at night, suggest a tripod and good lens for best shots."
,,Night city view,4.0,,This is the place whereby it controls the reservior water level and a gallery to educate on previous of water. It also having a green roof for visitors to walk to the top to enjoy the city view.
,,üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç,5.0,,It was really wonderful experience to see Marina bay sands from different places. It‚Äôs really a wonder how they managed to make great building.
,,Fantastic place - great views - hidden gem,5.0,,"What a great place !! It‚Äôs free and with great views.

Our Singaporean friends brought us here. What a gem - the place is full of locals having picnics , flying kits and it has a fantastic view of the city skyline, super trees, the Singapore flyer.

We came at night and it was just beautiful seeing couples with tea lights having picnics and lots of families spending time together.

There‚Äôs a lot of area for kid to cycle and a water play area as well.

This is not well known to tourists as not as easily accessible and our friends drove us here.

It‚Äôs a great feat of engineering as a wTer reservoir , but well designed so that locals can use it as a recreation area."
,,Great attraction that is free,4.0,,"This is a great place to visit for kite-flying, cycling and strolling in an open space. It is the only reservoir located in the city. Suitable for old and young and even those on wheelchair. Fantastic view of the CBD city skyline with Marina BaySands as the backdrop on one side and the sea view with the big ships on the other side. Other highlights include the 350 metres wide bridge that goes to Marina East and an air-conditioned Sustainable Gallery located on the 2nd floor which is also free entry. Booking to the gallery is advised in case of big crowd, which allows entry of 80 pax on hourly basis in the day, except Tuesday. Also available is a small water playground for kids. Within walking distance to the nearest food centre called 'Satay By the Bay'. The inconvenience is that there is only one bus service 400 which is within 5 mintues walk but not so if taking MRT (as the closest isn't ready - still under construction). Also no drinking vending machines or ATMs around, at least not that I could see. But with no entrance fees that needs to be paid, I can't complain much. Parking is available but this isn't free though."
,,Water with a difference,4.0,,This marine barrage was built to support Singapore‚Äôs needs and to help clean up its rivers. It now encloses a large mass of water providing water sports and good walking and running routes. There are clean facilities here too.
,,Kite flying!!,5.0,,"A great area to spend time with family and kids. Bought a kite to fly. Something I did after 20years. Had a short picnic while the kids played around. Spent time with wife experiencing the sunset. A great place to cycle, skate or just walk around with ur loved ones.."
,,Free attraction that's worth your time!,5.0,,"My family visit Marina Barrage about twice a month on average because it's basically a free attraction. My boys, aged 8 and 3 1/2 years old, love playing in the water (only ankle deep to shin deep). After that, we would walk up the slope to have a picnic on the grass. The view of the city skyline is magnificent and there are many kite flyers there too. We brought our kite on our latest visit too. If you don't fancy a picnic, you can walk to the food centre nearby, less than 5 mins away by foot, Satay By The Bay."
,,Excellent night time view of Singapore,5.0,,We walked here just for the view looking back at Singapore. The barrage was all lit up too. There is a large ramped walkway to the roof of the pump house or a lift or stairs.
,,Nice sunrise n sea view,3.0,,3rd visit to this place. Ample parking. Good view of sea m Eastern anchorage. Can be breezy but also has scorching sun if weather is not cloudy. Good place to walk around. Good view of CDB skyline. I going some renovations do restaurant not opened. Watch out for bikers - they don‚Äôt necessarily slow down. 1/2 day tour. Early mornings or evenings best timing to visit.
,,Super relaxing day walk at Marina Barrage,5.0,,"Went by to do some video walking at Marina Barrage. As a Singaporean, I always thought it was a tourist place and somehow envisioned it would be filled with tourist. I am glad to say I was wrong. There are magnificent 360-degree views of the Straits of Singapore (and its container shipping vessels) and a clear view of the Singapore city skyline. The winds were strong as well and I saw a few people flying kites. There were lots of families having a picnic and just chilling out."
,,Lovely walk,4.0,,This is a great walk and relatively quiet. I got to see the barrage gate opening which was pretty unexciting! The area is free of most tourists and there are some great views out across the water and over to East Coast Park.
,,Impressive!,5.0,,"We went there on Monday, 21st Jan, not expecting much rather than exhibition on the development of water catchment and distribution in Singapore. Our previous visit was Feb last year, only to be disappointed by its closure (upgrading). During this visit we were impressed by the staff (Mdm Jamaliah) who was there and offered her expert knowledge and assistance.
The Marina Barrage is a dam in Singapore built at the confluence of five rivers. It was officially opened on 30 October 2008 as Singapore's fifteenth reservoir. Mdm Jamaliah was informative and saved us a lot of time to understand how water was stored and how the flood control worked. Thank you.
I would also add that MB is not widely known by tourists and ought to be included in their visits. Well done, PUB."
,,Educational,5.0,,"As a Singaporean, I feel proud to be able to bring my overseas friends to this facility. It‚Äôs free and what‚Äôs more important is that it provides a beautiful view of the Singapore Skyline. Go about 6.45pm and you can view the transition of daylight to night and witness how Singapore comes to life with all the glittering night lights.

The place also allow me to share interesting stories about how we Singaporeans turn the limitation of water into a strength of being one of the worlds leading water conservation center, how we convert the whole island into a huge water conservatory. In addition, Marina Barrage acts as a flood control during high tides and thunderstorms.

Great talking piece!"
,,Free roof park of Marina,5.0,,"Near to Marina dam and Marina bay front. Free for admin to the roof top .there have park for relax, jogging, playing kite. And 360¬∞ sightseeing for Marina bay."
,,Worth a Visit if it in Your Way,3.0,,"We walked from the East Coast Park to the East side of the Barrage and across the barrage itself to the Barrage Building Complex. The photo opportunities from the barrage are excellent for capturing the iconic structures of the Singapore skyline. The Barrage ‚ÄúCentre‚Äù on the west side of the reservoir houses an outstanding exhibition dedicated to highlighting the threats of Climate Change, the only negative was that there was almost no one in the exhibition, us and one family group. It is sad to walk from there to ‚ÄúSatay on the Bay‚Äù and see the mass of single use plastics being handed out with every order, the Singapore government is not known for being shy when it comes to enforcing behaviours so it is something of a paradox so see how little legislation seems to exist to curb harmful waste products in the State. The elevated area is busy with kite flying and picnics and makes a very pleasant place to spend a few minutes indulging in a little ‚Äúpeople watching‚Äù. I would definitely recommend the exhibition."
,,Walk to the Barrage from Gardens by the Bay - Worth it!,4.0,,"The Barrage is a great location for views of Singapore. Viewing from the top of the Barrage Visitor Center which has a grassy slope leading to the building roof. Take a kite if you want to fly it in the breeze.

An easy walk from Gardens By The Bay - It takes about 15 minutes from the big artificial trees. You can also walk across the Barrage and get some good views of the bay.

Satay by the Bay provides some good food options which is a 5 minute walk away."
,,Overall Okay,4.0,,"It is a nice place to have an evening walk there, however, sometimes too many bicylces etc, hence need to be careful. Satay there is not cheap too. Maybe it is a good experience for foreigners."
,,Sun Set View and evening walk .,4.0,,If you are a nature lover you can spend a early morning or evening on marina barrage. While seeing the sun rise / sun set with a photogenic view of the singapore high rise . The Roof top green grass garden is lovely .. the view of sea is fantastic .
,,Who would of thought it was going to turn out quite interesting!,5.0,,"Well, as a fairly new expat here I thought I needed to learn more about this country so I decided to book myself in for a tour of the Marina Barrage. This tour is free and booking online is very easy, tours are from 9am -6pm daily except closed on Tuesdays. Tours last anywhere from 45mins ‚Äì 1 hour.

Each guided tour takes a maximum of 80 visitors. You can just walk in to the information counter and see what‚Äôs available but I‚Äôd be checking online so you can see the groups with the least amount of people so you can choose wisely. I was lucky enough to be the only one in the tour group for my time slot so it was more of a private tour. Having said that, there were several school groups there but everyone has different times slot for each of the areas so it doesn‚Äôt feel too crowded.

My tour guide ‚ÄòChilin‚Äô was very experienced and knowledgeable without getting to the overly boring stage that some tours get to when they overload you with too much information. The tour starts by viewing the reservoir from an upper level. Again, I was lucky to be there on a day that routine maintenance was being carried out on the closest reservoir door so I got to view directly into it. Next was the simulation of how the reservoir works which was very interesting and very well designed. Then it‚Äôs on to the Sustainable Singapore Gallery which is mostly interactive so you can go at your own pace. This gallery is about ALL of Singapore‚Äôs sustainable plans, not just water. To end off the tour you go to the grassed rooftop with an amazing view of Singapore. This is a public area and is open 24hrs. Also, the Sustainability Gallery is open to the public on weekends so no need for a tour guide.

I would highly recommend this tour to everyone. Children will love the hands on attractions and adults will be pleasantly surprised by this countries innovations and planning.

I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did. Take in the view at the end of your tour or come back and spend some time flying kites, ride a bike up here, have a sunset picnic or enjoy the night time view as well. The choice is yours!!

PS. If you are really lucky you'll see one of the fighter jets flyover too!"
,,Lovely views at night,5.0,,This place is excellent to take photos of Singapore's night skyline. Have a stroll and enjoy the warm breeze.
,,Interesting,4.0,,"It's a great place to relax. There various things you can do here: have a picnic, go for a walk, fly kites, cycling. The views to the city and to the sea are awesome. What a nice spot to visit!"
,,Truly City in a Garden,4.0,,Spotted this lizard on the way up to the roof of the Barrage. It was truly amazing to find such creature in a built-up area.
,,Lovely place for some sun and wind,4.0,,Very spacious place suitable for outdoor activities with the family and friends. Only downside is that it is quite out of the way.
,,Marina Barrage Singapore,4.0,,Lovely feel of open space. It is very windy and you can see people doing kite flying...great place for kids to have some outdoor run...
,,Cycling with lights at night,4.0,,"Those who shun the sun but yet want to do a light workout with fun and sights injected, this is the place. You can either put on those jogging or walking shoes that have been hibernating in your cupboards and set them free. Alternatively, you can bring your bike or pick up one of those public hire bikes and pedal your way around. Two routes to take along the vehicle free pedestrian walkways or cycling path around the Gardens by the Bay or cross the barrage and the path will connect you to East Coast Parkway. The latter can take you a long long long way but unless you intend to do the tour de Singapore, have a end point in mind. I turned around after Fort Road and headed back to the barrage, followed your senses to the Satay by the bay and replace those lost calories without having to feel guilty. Best of all, enjoy the lights of the city skyline, the bay and flora lined along the path. Best to bring your own water along for the route before you start to see mirages. Picturesque, tranquil and relaxing experience. Recommend the path that take you towards East Coast Park as it's less crowded and the distance you wish to cover is as long as your stamina can take you."
,,Great place to take awesome night view photo,5.0,,There was bunch of people running or cycling and if you cross the bridge you will be able to take awesome photos of the other side of Marina bay area which you can see MBS and Gardens by the bay with Singapore Flyer.
,,"Wide, windy open space , best for kite-flying family activities",5.0,,"In space-cramped Singapore, it is heartening to see the barrage area converted to a public space for education and activities. Wide and windy, marina barrage is most suitable for kite flying and picnic. In the month of August where it coincide with National Day, it is also a great spot to witness fighter jets fly pass in close contact."
,,Perfect for sunset,4.0,,"It is an ideal place to watch the sunset. Easy to ride the bus to the front and then walk inside. On top of that, there is a lawn that can do many things such as spending time with family. Take the pet for a walk. Or some people bring kites to play. From here, you can walk to the flower dome not far away."
,,"Nice place to have a picnic, fly kites or relax",5.0,,"The Barrage is basically a water reservoir with a garden built on the roof and a museum/observatory inside.Weekends see a lot kite flying and picnics on the roof garden which has amazing views of the Country & the Bay.They have a wonderful observatory where they display the entire history about the how the barrage was built etc.
Better to visit the place later in the day as it is super hot in the morning & afternoon."
,,"A little boring and hot, but nice view of the city.",4.0,,The top of the marina has a nice big field for kite flying with nice views of the city. However it is in direct sunlight so it can get a bit hot. There are fountains I the first level to cool off in though.
,,Great spot,4.0,,Visited here during event. Was packed with people but didn‚Äôt feel overcrowded. Great open area for city views and sunset. Hot during day as area not shaded. Short stroll from the Flower Dome at the Gardens. Will return with picnic at evening.
,,rsaf 50th cum aerial display,5.0,,"was at marina barrage yesterday. lovely place to chill and enjoy the scenic view of marina bay etc. spacious and clean.

as there was an aerial performance by rsaf, the place was packed with people. one thing when I was there, i observed people especially families with children (not locals though) blocking the entrance towards marina barrage open field..with mats and umbrellas. hope in future the management of marina barrage would put up signage to encourage n deter visitors from blocking any entrance leading to the open field.

overall, this place is a great for outdoor events and leisure walk."
,,Best place for Panaroma View of the Singapore City,5.0,,"If you want a panaroma view of Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay, look no further. This is the place to be. The attraction is free and can be reached by Taxi, Grab or taking SBS 400 from the Marina South MRT station.
The grass patch at the top of the barrage and pet friendly and many also come here to fly kites. During National Day period , you can get a good view of the Fireworks and air display."
,,Offers a good panoramic view of the city skyline and good place to just chill,4.0,,"This place is not only a reservoir, water facility but a popular recreational spot among tourists and locals alike! It's at a comfortable distance away from the bustling city center and just a stone's throw away from the other big attraction in Singapore: Gardens By The Bay (GBTB)!

As a local, if you are not keen in picnics or flying kites, you will seldom (or rather, never) have a reason to head over here. The nearest MRT station is the Bayfront station (located on the Downtown and Circle lines). If the weather is good, you can take a stroll from Marina Bay Sands -> GBTB -> Marina Barrage. In fact, you will find quite a number of people cycling or jogging along the tracks.

What I will highly recommend is to rent a bicycle from East Coast Park and cycle to Marina Barrage. It might seem far but it really isn't so! But, of course, do check the weather forecast beforehand as the weather can get quite erratic in Singapore.

When you are there at Marina Barrage, you can either have a picnic, take some photos, fly kites, have a photoshoot or even just to chill and enjoy the scenic views.

This place is turning 10 in October this year and who knows, there might be interesting events lined up so do check it out!"
,,One of the best sunset spots in Singapore,5.0,,"I think the pictures I'm going to upload with this review say it all. Lovely panoramic view of the Singapore skyline from here, plus you get a direct, unblocked sunset view now that the construction cranes have been removed.

Also great for flying kites and picnicking."
,,Good place to see Sunset,4.0,,I really recommended to visit here when sun goes down. You will see a great scene of Sunset and dymanic of Singapore city. Location is quite great near by Garden by the way around 15 mins by walk.
,,OMG!! Wonderful place,5.0,,"The amazing area at Marina Reservoir unbelievable stunning me by the beautiful views
I riding here for exercise and take a deep breath to enjoy the view of this place was wonderful.
If someone loves to walk, cycle, running, practice photography, jogging or Rollerblade this place very fantastic!!"
,,Wonderful greenery relaxing place,5.0,,"the perfect design and well development place.

on the building roof-top, there has a spacious greenery field, the people can enjoy variety outdoor open-air activities such as flying kite, singing, chatting, picnic etc.

from the east direction, we can see the great ocean but from the west direction, we can see the magnificent Marina Bay Sand building and the other skyscrapers building (so it would be great time to see the night lighting from here)

from my impressive memorized, this is the great place to have a simple dinner box set, see the lively people outdoor activities and see the gorgeous spectacular wonderful scenery view."
,,Kids loved Kite Flying,5.0,,"We went to the barrage after visiting the garden by the bay. This is basically a water treatment facility and they have tours but we didn‚Äôt take one. The surrounding areas is all open green spaces water fountains and some decent waterfront walking area and restaurants. We went there to fly kites you can do that at the top which is patch of green with great views of the city and the sea. Usually not that busy, the kite store at the barrage doesn‚Äôt sell disposable kites they are the good kind which can cost you up to 50 dollars. You can get cheap ones at any Toysrus for 7 dollars it was a lot of fun for the kids while we enjoyed the City‚Äôs Skyline."
,,Another terrific green area in Singapore,5.0,,"After spending many hours in The Gardens By The Bay, we then walked to the Marina Barrage and looked back towards the city at around sunset. It was a nice wander, with only very few people around so it was a good area to miss the crowds. From the top one looks over the barrage and river, back to the city. From there we headed towards Satay By The Bay for dinner."
,,A nice place to go for a walk,5.0,,"Since we lived on the East Cost side, we always went for a leisurely stroll to the Marina barrage from our house. It's always been such a nice experience since the place is neat and clean and the views in the evening of the MBS, Flower Dome, Cloud Forest etc. are really amazing."
,,Nice scenic view,5.0,,"Love jogging around the Barrage of catch a night scenic view enjoying the breeze. A little too hot if visit in the day, most areas not sheltered. Many go there to flight a kite, good for leisure and looking for a relexed moment."
,,Outstanding Urban Project,5.0,,Marina Barrage is a unique combination of water treatment facility and recreational facility. The treatment facility is covered by several acres of green space used for kite flying and picnics. It has running and walking paths. The location has a restaurant and kite store. It has a great view of both the harbor and Singapore skyline and is the head path for the gardens and shopping area. There are also golf cat guides availabile for the extended recreational area.
,,Excellent Running Along Beautiful Sights,5.0,,"Both my father and I love running along the Marina Barrage. In fact, the majority of run races held in the city involve running across the 350m long stretch and more. The visibility of the waters and the surrounding skyline is typically excellent (although often sunny and not so shaded), offering the perfect blend of nature and city life. Pets are always welcome here as well, although I might bring them at a period when the heat is kinder. Do not forget to check out the mini park at the top of the barrage; its greenery and elevation turn it into an excellent photo-taking area, also ideal for family picnics and kite-flying."
,,A park with a purpose,3.0,,"The Marina Barrage is a 350m long tidal barrier constructed across the mouth of the Singapore river. It was designed to create the Marina Bay Area into a freshwater reservoir by keeping the saltwater from the ocean out. It also functions as a flood mitigation measure.
You are able to walk across it, as it links Gardens by the Bay to the eastern bank.
The PUD, who operated the barrage, have a modern 3 storey concrete building on the bank of the river, which contains a visitor centre. On the roof of the building is a large grassed park, which provides views back to the City and out to the harbour. The grassed area is used as a picnic area and for flying kites etc.
The whole area is free to access."
,,Relaxing walk around the area,4.0,,"I brought my family to this place for a relaing afternoon walk. It has been established for 10 years and been a singaporean, its the first time that i am here. There are story boards around telling the story and objective of this reservoir. It offers a nice stroll around the barrage and i saw many people fishing along it. There is this big open green space at level three where many people fly kites or simply lying on the grass to enjoy the breeze.

Walk a few metres down and you will reach the satay by the bay where you can find some local food. Its quite an interesting place to visit and get some amazing pictures with the singapore straits as the backdrop!"
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"We were so pleased that we went to visit the Marina Barrage. we saw a Kingfisher, swifts and an Osprey, crabs too.
The ships that were docked were huge and a sight to see.
we liked the statues and enjoyed the views from the top where there was a lovely cool breeze.
Definitely worth a visit."
,,"Awesome place to be at, regardless to enjoy the view or the breeze!",5.0,,"This is definitely one of the must go to place In Singapore!

Marina barrage is a great place to enjoy the view of the Central Business District landscape, and also a great kite flying location.

Do allocate at least half a day, to either chill by the breeze or to enjoy the great kite flying experience.

However, do ensure that you bring along yr own outdoor protection stuffs (caps, Sun block etc) as it can get quite hot at times."
,,TOP!,5.0,,This is a TOP place to go as evening is arriving and the lights of the city start to come on. The lights from the boats behind arrive too and it‚Äôs quite magical. Great exercise and wonderful views. I always feel uplifted after visiting.
,,Highlight of Singapore,5.0,,Well you can spend all your evenings here without ever getting fed up of it ... do visit ... alone or a couple or family or group .. This place for everyone and everytime
,,Free and fuss-free place to bake in the sunlight,5.0,,"Such free and open spaces abutting the city that affords gorgeous views of the skyline are rare. It's remarkable how they made what's essentially a temple of concrete, so much fun and accessible to the community at large. Watch some fabulous kites in action as you lie spread-eagled on the immaculately-kept grass turf. Sunshades are a must if you want to soak in all that Vitamin D."
,,Incredible view of all Marina Bay,5.0,,"The place is good to visit during evening, watching sunset, playing kite, walk or cycling. A lot of couple and families been there. Nice place to visit."
,,hidden gem,5.0,,The locals know and love this spot for picnics and pics of skyline. Walk across the barrage to the underrated Marina East park
,,Peaceful - after the rain,4.0,,"I don't know what Marina Barrage looks like if it is sunny. I was here after a heavy shower and I really enjoyed walking around almost on my own. You have a great view to the city. I did not go inside, I just walked to the top of the 'hill' and enjoyed the peace and the view. You can take nice pictures about the famous buildings of Singapore. If you are close, for example in the garden, do not miss walking up here and look around. There are some nice fountains and sculptures too worth watching."
,,nice family place picnic,5.0,,with familly please visit here.many activites here such as walk cycling and all.over all one of the best experience here.
,,great place for gathering and just chilling,5.0,,"went there for a picnic with my friends recently. it's my third time here and it's still great. there are a lot of people flying kites, having picnics, walking dogs and just enjoying the wind and scenery :) the area is also very clean so no worries!"
,,Secret Garden,4.0,,"Instead of heading to Garden by the Bay, you should actually head to this Barrage for the best view of Singapore cityscape. Whereas you have got to pay SG$25 to enter any one of the glass canopy at Garden by the Bay, entrance to the Barrage is FREE! There's a green above the dam and that's where expat and local families congregate to have picnic and to fly kites on weekends. The place is pleasant to visit with soft wind billowing from the ocean. In the evening, the place is a popular haunt for lovers to congregate, fellow friends to gather and to enjoy the view together, and even students coming here to make use of the ample space below to rehearse upon their dance and so forth. This is actually a place that you get to see the interaction between locals and international visitors. One amazing feat about this Barrage is that there's hardly any mosquitoes day and night, and that such a small place is able to process water for three quarter of the island's population. It's truly an amazing feat. Should you have a bike, there's a new trail that enables you to cycle all the way to East Coast. You can also do this in absolute safety as CCTV is everywhere in Singapore. Talking about the most underrated tourist attraction, this will be it. Highly recommended!"
,,The best place in Singapore,5.0,,"This is the best place for family outing, friends meeting, exercise, running , cycling etc... it ls very closed to garden by the bay. Have to spend 1-2 hrs there. The scenic in morning and evening are different. Do not be hesitate to go."
,,Place to play and learn with amazing view to Marina Bay,5.0,,"A bit far from MRT station but worth to walk and visit! It was built to educate visitors the important roles of water and how Singapore could save water, prevent flooding and tide. The view to Gardens By the Bay, Marina Bay, and Marina Bay Sands was amazing. The green rooftop with natural grass was a nice place to play, picnic, and of course, take a picture. Highly recommend!"
,,Marina Barrage is a Must See for Singapore,5.0,,"From Marina Barrage, you can see the ships anchored in the ocean in one direction, and Marina Bay Sands and the city skyline in the other. This is a green grass rooftop that covers the pumping station for Singapore water.
This is absolutely kid friendly. You will find people flying kites on any nice day (meaning not raining). Get your kid (or the kid in yourself) a kite and go fly it. There is a kite store you can find by searching online in that area.
The panoramic or wide angle photos I posted I took yesterday with my drone."
,,A Dam As A Tourist Attraction,4.0,,"An amazing place. The dam seperates the 5 rivers from the bay, keeping fresh water in and sea out. A really green design and a great place for views of the city. Worth a visit."
,,Nice spot to have a short rest,4.0,,"It is a very nice place to have view over the Marina. Moreover, you can clearly see the dam that divides Marina Bay and the ocean. After a walk through the different gardens, it is nice to have a rest on top of the barrage and enjoy the view. Barrage itself is covered with a greenfield."
,,Great place!,5.0,,Such a beautiful place to visit! We were speechless at the time we arrived there! Generally people are really friendly! Marina is really beautiful place that you definitely need to see!
,,Nice and different view of the city,4.0,,"Take a taxi there, and walk back to the Gardens at the bay and MBS. It is a nice walk (but can be sweaty) and you'll get a lovely skyline view of the city. The restaurant, nit at the barrage but a bit further, where you can get Satay at the Bay, is wonderful. The satay is a must and it is wonderful. The peanut sauce is lipsmacking good."
,,A lovely walk to watch the ships,4.0,,I often walk over the barrage on the way to East Coast Park. Great for taking photos of ships on one side and the beautiful Singapore skyline on the other. If you like fitness and photography this is a great place to visit.
,,A nice place for relaxation during weekend,5.0,,"Marina Barrage is my favourite place for relaxing during my weekend. I and my friends enjoy watching kids playing kite with their smiley faces or sometimes seeing new couples taking wedding photos. It is so impressive to know that Marina barrage is a dam in Singapore built at the confluence of fives rivers across the Marina Channel between Marina East and Marina South. It keeps fresh water in and the sea out! it was deserved to win the Green Mark Platinum Award in May 2009. The green roof use 100% recycled plastics and Eco friendly drainage, providing natural heat insulation to cool down the building by 3 celcius from grass and soil shield. So amazing!!!"
,,Best view in the city,5.0,,Amazing views over the city. Go shortly before sunset for the best photo opportunity. Or around 6pm when the local Air Force always seem to be flying low over the barrage as they make landing approach.
,,Picnic spot with a view,3.0,,"A nice rooftop spot for tourists and locals alike to have a picnic, outdoor wedding photo shoot, fly their kites, or just relax and loiter around, especially late in the afternoon, just before sunset, to feast on magnificent views of the Marina Bay. It can get crowded sometimes...

If you are a runner, it is right on the very popular running route around the Marina Bay, so don't miss the loop to the top of the platform and straight down onto the dam connecting across the bay to the Gardens by the Bay East park."
,,Family day at concert in the park,3.0,,Big open spaces for young kids to roam around for picnic and kite flying. Sun setting view by the sea with a magnificent view of the marina area.
,,Kite flying here!,4.0,,"Our family have recently picked up kite flying activity. This is a good place to fly your kites free. Go up to the rooftop, roll out your picnic mats and spread the food. There is not much shelter at the top. We reached at around 1pm on a public holiday and there was not much crowd. By 3 pm the place was very pack and by the time we left at 6pm the sky was beautifully filled with kites of all shapes, size and colour.
At level 1, there is one shop selling kites the good quality types. There is only one restaurant at level 1 where you can buy refreshments.

Don't forget your sunscreens!"
,,Just getting there is fun!,4.0,,"The Singapore officials took basically a municipal engineering project serving the everyday needs of its citizens into a major attraction/area for locals and visitors and tourists alike. Ingenious! Picnic area, rooftop retreat, great views of the waterfront/city skyline and beyond. It is the terminus for the walking/bike path. Along the path to get the Marina Barrage are major Singapore attractions such as Garden by the Sea and other major attractions. This area addresses many opportunities to see what the city has to offer in this area. Photo opportunities are good."
,,Nice place for pictures,4.0,,"If you go up to the roof of Marina Barrage, you can see the Marina Bay Sand & the sea full with vessels sometime. This is a nice place for seeing the main city part & take good pictures"
,,Nice open grass area when you climb up to the top,3.0,,"Great place for flying kites and having a picnic. However, tourists from a certain country kept taking photos and trying to touch my young Daughter. This may be acceptable in some cultures but not mine. My advice is to look out if you are bringing young children there. I don't think they mean any real harm but definitely not comfortable with what they do."
,,Worth a look,4.0,,The Marina Barrage is worth visiting. The barrage itself is not much unless you're interested in the engineering of the project which is fascinating in itself. While there you also get a unique view of the Singapore skyline so it's great for taking photos. Many people use the grass area on the barrage for kite flying or picnicking. Recommend a walk through Gardens By the Bay to get to the barrage.
,,Wonderful open-air break,5.0,,"Its a big green open space by the sea built on the roof of an interesting swoopy curly structure. Very much urban playground feel to the place. You're right by the sea and the estuary so great breeze, expansive vistas. There was a kite-flying event the day I went so it was particularly festive with lots of excited kids and parents running around."
,,Nice Place for a Walk,5.0,,The Marina Barrage located close to the Gardens by the Bay is a lovely place to spend time in the evening. It is also a popular picnic spot for the locals. One can get good photographs here with the Singapore skyline in the background.
,,"Good for taking photos, jogging, biking, or picnicking",5.0,,Unique place to experience the breathtaking view of city scape of Singapore. Great place to capture this fantastic view.
,,Great View,4.0,,"A quiet place (and free) to get a great view of the bay or the city and in particular stunning views of a sunset over the city. Has a small park where you can see some kite and drone flying. Walking distance to Marina Bay Sands hotel, Shoppes mall and many restaurants."
,,Decent for droning,3.0,,"Look up the info on where you can and can't fly a drone in Singapore. The Marina Barrage is legal and has a lot of kite flying there, too."
,,Calm and beautiful place.,5.0,,"Looked very nice to visit. A place on the ist floor was a green ground all around, wonderful looking, cool breeze and enjoyble."
,,Perfect site to fly your kites and having picnic,4.0,,"Large field and empty sky with constant wind, what else do you need to fly kites? Perfect and it is good for afternoon picnic with the whole family.

It is also an ideal site to enjoy Singapore skyscrapers (incl. iconic Marina Bay Sands & the Flyer) from a distance. I feel like I was looking at a painting."
,,If your in the Marina Gardens area walk to the Marina Barrage and take a look.,4.0,,"If your in the ""Marina Bay Gardens area"" its worth walking to the Marina Barrage and take a look.Or you can get a taxi to the location. Its a nice pick nick area and locals are seen flying Kites and having fun.Its interesting to see how Singapore supplies its area with fresh water. There is a free educational area to explain how the treatment is done and a large model showing the supply area. I'm sure young families and older people would enjoy. You can also buy meals from the Satay by the bay stalls at a reasonable price not far away, and if your there in the afternoon you will see the sun set and the city lights coming on before you wonder back towards the Gardens to see the light show. Make sure you have your camera with you for so many opportunities to take wonderful memories of your stay in Singapore."
,,Great view,4.0,,"Nice view of the sunset behind Marina Bay Sands. Get to see the city come to life and light up, the Flyer, Supertree Grove, Marina Bay.

For some reason everyone flies their kites up there during the sunset, you can buy your own down at a shop under the grassy hill, not too sure how expensive they are though.

Lots of people take picnics and there's loads of kids with ball games and toys up there so watch out for flying footballs"
,,Beautiful Sunset View,5.0,,"This is a great place to chill, have picnic with friends and family, fly kites and catch the sunset. This place is popular with both locals and tourists."

,,Remote location,5.0,,"It is absolutely worth visiting the Marina Barrage to discover that beautiful remote spot. An ideal location to relax from the hustle of the CBD and to enjoy the sun. Offers a great panoramic view of Singapore, too."
,,Popular with young kids,3.0,,"Took the kids here today for another visit (it being more than a year since we were last year). Surprisingly popular today with plenty of people on the roof, maybe because it was slightly overcast with a breeze suitable for kite flying. We played with frisbees for a while until it became too hot. A small water play area on the ground level also which is suitable for children. Plenty of parking available."
,,Nice place to fly kites,4.0,,"With big open grass space, you'll be happy to know that you can run with your kites freely. No trees to snag your lines. However, in recent times, the place has garnered a lot of inconsiderate visitors so do take note."
,,Barrage Visit,3.0,,Visitors here like to spend the time in the open space having picnic or flying kites. Sometimes activities are also organised here
,,A nice walk but super humid,4.0,,"I went with my friends for a walk to the Barrage. We wanted to do something more unconventional and different from the regular walks around Marina Bay Sands. Even though the barrage is fascinating in many ways and the walk from East Coast Park to the barrage is long, not exactly stunning but surely good exercise- it was very humid and we were drenched by the end of it. It's nice for a change but nothing spectacular."
,,Lovely nice views,5.0,,Picturesque views like a postcard. The beauty is awe inspiring. This is a huge freshwater storehouse supplying Singapore's water needs.
,,"great place for a picnic, kite flying, dog walking, or just chill!",5.0,,"been here multiple times, chilling, having a picnic, kite flying, and even walking the dog. a great place to be with accessible toilets and cafes nearby."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"If you want to get a view like a refrigerator door magnetic souvenir Singapore you shoul go here. From the rooftop you can look the best Singapore skyline with all famous Singapore icon completely there. Use bus number 400 to get directly to there.

Dont forget to give ur thumb if my review is helful for you. Thank you"
,,Lovely views towards sea and city,4.0,,"This is a remarkable building, with the barrage dividing the sea from the river and the gently sloping grassy walkway atop the building itself. The views towards Marina Bay Sands and the city centre are incredible and there is also a good look out to sea and the countless cargo ships waiting to come and go from the port (I lost count after 40). It is an easy side trip from Gardens by the Bay - just follow the river from the conservatories!"
,,Informative Taxi Driver.,5.0,,So one day we got a really interesting and numerous taxi driver to take us to Gardens by the Bay. En route he showed us the Marina Barrage and explained how by building the structure the Singapore authorities have created a huge fresh water reservoir. This is in order no to be reliant on Malaysia for their water supplies.
,,Fun in the sun,4.0,,Great place for kite flying with strong breezes. Have a nice picnic under the stars on the rooftop garden of the barrage with the views of the ocean as well as a backdrop.

,,Great view of Singapore's City Scape,4.0,,"This is a great spot for a relaxation view especially for sunset view. A great place to simply take a stroll, flying a kite, or just for the view. It is also a short walk to Garden By the Bay as well as the Cloud Dome and the Flower Dome. Along the way, there is a water park which is great for the kids to play - no charges - as well as Singapore local food stalls for a taste of the local, which is quite reasonably priced"
,,A great Panoramic View of Singapore,4.0,,If you can choose a clear sunny day (normally the mornings are best as it rains in the afternoons) you can get a marvellous view across Singapore with a view across the Business and Financial district. allow a couple of hours and you will find your visit worthwhile
,,great view,5.0,,It's great to come here on a sunny day. The view is amazing! This was the highlight of a whole day in the bay area for me
,,Beautiful View of the CBD,4.0,,"Marina Barrage is probably one of the best place to see the city skyline and one which is not often featured in tourist guides.

Absolutely love this place especially on weekdays evening when it's not too crowded. Bring a mat, drinks & a book to chill or a camera to capture beautiful sunset or the city skyline."
,,Unique view of CBD,4.0,,"If you are a photographer, then this should be the place to go as it gives a unique panoramic view of the central business district with the major tourist attractions in one image. Do be aware that this is a security sensitive area. I was told by the security personnel that if I want to video tape, permission is needed and no drones are allowed."
,,A Must visit place in the tourist TOP 20,5.0,,"None of the sightseeing list might feature this as a tourist hotspot but This deserves to be a must visit for its uniqueness and the way it's built.

It's a getaway for many Singapore families to laze around and do a lunch party. You will see kids flying kites, grown ups enjoying their drinks and frisbee and fitness freaks running on the check dam.

It offers amazing skyline view of the city and a TOP view of gardens by the Bay."
,,Not much to do,3.0,,There is absolutely nothing to do when you reach the Marina Bay Barrage because there is actually not much to do there except maybe the flower dome or the beautiful nature which you can see in reservoirs
,,Great Openspace - nice play area for kids,4.0,,"Many people flock to this wonderful place over the weekends, it's a nice place to spend your evenings and enjoy the city views in sunset. People fly kites as its quite windy and couples have their photoshoots planned with the great city skyscrappers in the background. Great place to sit and relax in the buzzing city."
,,Great photo opportunities day or night!,5.0,,"We wandered through the Gardens By the Bay, and we were pleasantly surprised to find so many young families enjoying this venue. Whether a picnic, or like many flying a kite. A bus is available from a MRT station, but it was a pleasant walk."
,,Lovely half day outing,5.0,,"Rent a bicycle from East Coast Park and cycle to Marina Barrage. An excellent family outing in the seaside breeze

Seaside, parks, excellent view of Singapore skyline, makes for a great photo taking opportunity.

You can take in the views of Marina Bay Sands, Spore Flyer and the Spore skyline of skyscrapers

There is Satay by the Bay, a food center with lots of delicious local fare. And there is also a kids water theme play area."
,,Nice place for evening,5.0,,It has lots of space for kids to run around and they have a small area where kids play at the water playground. If you would like to picnic this is a good spot in the evening. And you can also fly kite as it it pretty windy
,,Singapore skyline views,4.0,,"Breathtaking view of Marina Bay sands, Singapore flyer and other landmarks dotting the Singapore skyline. Best part is that it is free. I usually rent a bike from east coast park and bike my way to the barrage in about 25mins. I have also driven there on few occasions"
,,Amazing place for kite flying,5.0,,Purchase your own kites before coming to this location. Come around 4-6pm because that's the best time for kite flying.
,,Great outing with family in evening,5.0,,"Though I am in Singapore for more than 4 years, I have never been to Marina Barrage, but I heard about it often from friends about the breath taking city skyline views. So I visited it along with my parents and found that the place is really very good and lived to its name and fame. The architecture is fantastic and the spiral walk way that leads to the roof garden is very good. Especially when the climate is good, its quite an enjoyable experience. If you are photography aficionados please carry a good camera to capture the dusk and city lights. Don't miss staring at beautiful kites flying all around."
,,Great,5.0,,"Its a great relaxing place .You can see birds ,Iguana ,birds , fishes etc and . Overall nice experience"
,,Limited Appeal,3.0,,"Despite having lived in Singapore for 17 years, this was my first visit to the Marina Barrage.

It was interesting but could have been much better. Good historical focus - the kampong era with its floods and droughts to the fledgling country in the 60's and Lee Kwan Yew's inspiration to do away with the old and in with the new. In all he did - he did with passion - and that included cleaning up the Singapore and Kallang Rivers, then heavily polluted. The birth of reservoirs and the road to Singapore's water self sufficiency. In front of us were a group of Hong Kong secondary or college students so sat in on their presentation. Pleased I did as the mechanical model was fairly useless without an explanation. Moved on to the next room which dealt with reclamation - guide poorly presented the topic. Said reclamation started by pouring soil in and covering it with sea water - living here - I do hope not. Told the students reclamation was common in Singapore as opposed to Hong Kong - not so - they are experts in reclaiming from the sea too. For all her faults - I did learn how the barrage operates and some water management points.

If your tour individually it's not particularly stimulating, especially if your not based in Singapore or have a particular local interest. Nice views of the barrage from the roof and nice artwork in forecourt.

Worth a visit but limit your expectations!"
,,A local thing...,4.0,,"Well, my guide was more excited about the barrage than I. He explained the entire process of how once saline water was converted to fresh water by the Singapore govt and how it is regulated through the barrage.

So, hardly any tourist interest here apart from the fact that the place is free. Offers nice view of the bay area. Yes, I could see the local folks having a gala time with outdoor activities like cycling / skate boarding etc."
,,Awesome place to just chill in the evening.,5.0,,"The place is good to just relax with family & loved ones. During the day you can fly your kites or jog around. Once the night falls, you will be able to see colourful lights as the Marina Bay Sands is just a stone away. Spectacular view indeed"
,,Free and interesting,3.0,,I brought a scientist here to explain how Singapore copes with water resources. The view can be considered good. It's not easy to get to by local public transport so I am told? But you can understand the pragmatism and the quest for Singapore to try to control its own destiny and resources through technology and out of the box thinking!
,,Hire a bike and enjoy,5.0,,"The surrounding areas on both sides of the river are worth exploring a little more than you can get to walking. I can highly recommend the fat bikes at ""The Bicycle Hut"" just next to Clarke Quay."
,,Don't understand what's the fuss about,2.0,,Don't really understand what's impressive about this small dam that separates the sea and the fresh water that's held in marina bay. Would be impressive if there was a lock so that yacht could go inside marina bay
,,Fun afternoon adventure,4.0,,"Best to take bus 400, alight on Marina barrage and have an afternoon stroll in this very functional and iconic building. There is so much to do from finishing a mannequin challenge to flying a kite. There are even bike rentals. Picnic are also good, overlooking Singapore's bustling ports. The 2nd floor boasts of a gallery providing eager beavers background about the water reservoir and control functions. There's also so much to learn about Singapore's sustainable growth efforts."
,,Interesting vantage point to see the Singapore skyline,4.0,,"Nice open parkland, with panoramic views across the waters of this first marine reservoir that will develop into fresh water for consumption"

,,Free tour by marina barrage,1.0,,"Don't go for it, everything seems to be under maintenance and poorly put together. Waste of an hour, that could been enjoyed outside. Interactive displays aren't.

,,If you are a into photography.,5.0,,"It is great for some sundown and night shots from those individual shelter at the side of the barrage that overlooked the city.

There is a small but interesting exhibit explaining how various reservoirs, including the barrage, were created and why."
,,Great Spot for a Picnic,4.0,,"Went there for a picnic with friends on a Saturday afternoon. The scenery was great and it was windy, perfect for flying kites. Managed to find a spot with shade and had a picnic there. Do note that there is only one large shady spot at the roof. If you wish to get a great shady spot for a picnic, try to be there before 5pm.

Also good for flying kites or having a picnic at the top of the pump facility building."
,,Great place to chill and fly a kite!,4.0,,"NIce place to hang out with friends and family for a picnic, kite flying, outdoor acitvity.

While you cannot visit the pump station, there are exhibits that illustrate the benefits of the barrage.

The rooftop is a good place to start. Take the lifts straight up. Panoramic view of the bay and the sea (yes full of ships). Rather breezy and pleasant to walk, especially on the bay bridge that links to the east gardens. There are little pavilions on the bridge with seats for you to enjoy the view, especially at night.

Look closely and you can find iguana, monitor lizards, different type of birds, fishes etc along the stroll. Bring water with you though as it is a nature walk thus no stalls nearby unless you decide to walk towards Marina Bay Gardens from the Barage. We (husband & I) went there without any expectations and it was a weekday and we encounter few people and a very long monitor lizard sunbathing...but quickly disappeared as I walk closer to take a photo with my phone..."
,,A great photo spot,4.0,,My local friends took us here for a picnic and to fly some kites. I had no idea that a building attached to a dam could be so cool!

It was a cool experience and a great place to go to relax!

,,Sunday Morning Walk By The Bay,4.0,,"It was a cool relaxing Sunday morning.

Drove to Marina Barrage area, parked at the car park located at Gardens by The Bay. Enjoyed a relaxing morning walk along the promenade, saw the Singapore skyline. Abundance of dew and cool fresh air. Saw the sun rising from the east. The sky changed its colour slowly before it really brightened up. Many joggers running about. Saw people fishing too. Amazingly saw the otters family swimming to land, relaxing by the bay. They were simply so cute. Saw the dam that separates the sea water and the reservoir. Many vessels in the outer sea. Also drogon boaters cheering and rolling their boat. A place to rejuvenate the tired soul and mind in this buzzing garden city. Totally cooling, peaceful and relaxing.

Enjoyed the morning stroll. Nearest MRT likely to be Bayfront (Marina Bay Sands) and walk across."

,,Gorgeous walk for a great view back on the Marina,5.0,,"Can be exposed in places so slap on your sunblock and bring plenty of water. But this is a lovely walk and provides stunning views back on the MBS hotel, Gardens By The Bay and the city. You'll get some amazing photographs and a different view of the city."
,,Worth visiting !!,5.0,,"Great for a family outing having a walk, picnic or just visiting the restaurant there....very scenic for different views in the day & night...."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"You don't expect much visiting dam, but this place is unique. It's great combination of industrial object with recreational place. Exhibition is very interesting."
,,The Views,3.0,,"Marina Barrage does not feature on tourist itineraries and it surely isnt a touristy place. However it is a lovely little hide-out for residents looking to relax or jog while having great views of the city and the bay. It is a popular kite-flying spot, and also gets filled up fast on evenings when fireworks are planned(due to national day/ new year etc). Bring your own food and drink. Accessible via bus or taxi, there is no MRT stop nearby."
,,Dam in a city:amazing,5.0,,"A visit to Marina Barrage is not only to see the amazing view of Singapore's city skyline, but to learn how and why the barrage (a sort of dam) was built. How it improved the consistent water-level of the Singapore River, prevented unsightly low-tide messes along inner-city tourist areas, etc. Go late afternoon when it's not too hot, walk up the curving ramp to the rooftop and be amazed. See huge kite flying on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, with family picnics. Kids will love running freely on the grass or the lower water play area. (No swimming in the dam itself.)"
,,The grass patch on top is great for picnics,4.0,,"Lots of people have their picnics on the grass patch on the roof of the building. Personally, I have flown a kite here before and it's one of the more picturesque places to do so, with the iconic Singapore skyline in the distance. There is also an informative exhibit documenting how Singapore conserves water and makes the most out of its limited water supply."
,,One of my favourite place in Singapore,5.0,,"Bring a cardigan, some food and sit on the grass to watch people fly their kites, drones and mini helicopter. There is always a breeze so it seldom gets too hot. Nice skyline of the city and the night view is great too. This is a good place to relax and enjoy the sun and wind. There's even a small air-conditioned exhibition center that explains how the barrage works. Check the weather forecast before heading here. Not a good place to visit on rainy days."
,,Fabulous view of Singapore skyline,4.0,,Day or night (but night is particularly impressive) you get a fantastic view back across the bay to Singapore's fabulous skyline. During the day go up to the grassed area above the barrage and fly your kite.
,,Worth the walk,5.0,,You get fantastic views of Singapore from the barrage. Go early evening time and you will see sunset and the lights over the city. Can eat at satay by the bay close by.
,,Relax and lay back,4.0,,"Great place for picnic. There is a big grass field at the top where people have picnics and fly kites, and enjoying the sunset and city views."
,,Amazing sight,5.0,,You have to visit to see how create Singaporeans are with their construction! There is a beautiful covered area over the building on the side with great views towards the city.
,,Good place for kite flying,5.0,,"A good quality kite will be of the best usage here, due to the strong coastal wind, kite flying can never be more satisfying. Do remember to get a thicker string to prevent your kite from being cut away by other kite user."
,,Superb place for outing,5.0,,"If you are nature lover and also like some sports this one is the perfect location. Located in the Marina Bay area, this innovative barrage is not only engineering marvel but also nice place to spend time with your loved ones. Information center will give you all details of what to do and also they have museum showing history of Singapore. On upper deck you will enjoy nice wind full flow with superb view of sea. Best part is wind and sea view. You will love it. Must must visit"
,,night visit,5.0,,"Try to visit this place during the night, when you could see many kites were flown with luminous lightings."
,,Great views and a nice walk or bike ride,5.0,,"It is great to walk or cycle across the Marina Barrage. We often walk the dogs here and enjoy the views of the Gardens by the Bay domes and the Central Business District building in the distance, There is usually activity on the water too, such as dragon boat racing or kayaking. If you are a tourist then take about 1 hour round the circuit."
,,Lovely View and Landscape,4.0,,"Quite an Interesting place. Large enough to take in large crowds. Can get rather hot with not much shelters, but overall a nice peaceful setting. Not really a ""must-go"" kind of place, but if you have the time, why not. But I would not think it would be a place to go when it is rainy, as the scenery is what you want here. A rainy day is a no-no."
,,If you never been here. You've never been to Singapore,4.0,,"This place is a unique place in Singapore where yuo must go. Not only the view is magnaficent during the day or night, but the engineering feat as well.

Good place to have picnics & kite flying. Definitely a place take lotsa photos as well.

Go there! it's Uniquely SIngapore."
,,Very good,4.0,,Do as part of a general walk about tour with other areas of a Tour. Not for only this view. Great looking
,,well a walk on the barrage aint bad,5.0,,well we go to this place usually for educational purposes as this is a important task of not letiing the country to be in a state of danger especially tsunami.well the garden beside the barrage is awesome
,,The scenery is very memorable.,5.0,,The place is very scenic and quiet. I ate my breakfast in the open air and feel relax. Just like under the star eating food but here is under the light rays (early morning) of the sun eating breakfast.
,,Family favourite,5.0,,"We visit this place everytime we visit Singapore without fail. Love the water park which is great during the day when the sun is up..when the sun is about to set.. head up the rooftop to enjoy the col breeze and kite flying, pack a picnic and enjoy the night kites in the sky and Singapore brightly lit skyline. Also a great place to catch the fireworks display."
,,A water reservoir,3.0,,"Visited this place out of curiosity, as we were dining at Satay by the Bay, which is within walking distance from here. There is considerable construction taking place at this place and a sign stated that the place is being improved."
,,Looking for a kite,3.0,,"We visited the Barrage after reading that the gift shop sold kites. Unfortunately, the cheapest kite was around $23.00 and we felt that was too expensive for a first kite for a 3 year old.

We had a bit of a walk around and observed students preparing for a graduation ceremony.

A man was flying a kite and a couple of families were picnicking, however it was very hot, even at 6 p.m. so we didn't linger for long.

We asked at the information desk how we could find the bus which would take us to Marina Bay MRT station and the man gestured that the bus stop was ""just out there"". In reality, you have to walk all the way across the parking area and cross a road where you'll find the bus shelter for the public bus. So, don't expect it to be ""just out there"", however if you look in the distance you'll probably see people waiting at the stop so you'll know where to go. We couldn't see any signs pointing the way."
,,Walk,4.0,,This dam area is a good place to go for a walk or ride bikes.A good place to go with kids so they can runaround.A good view also.
,,"Nice spot to roll, bike, walk, run, and watch kites !",4.0,,"Here is a cool and ""fresh"" (!) spot in Singapore with a nice view on the city. Lots of joggers, bikers, even hoverboarders (!) in the weekends, and last but not least, kites on both banks of the barrage - a genuine Singaporean hobby ! very nice to see and enjoy :))"
,,Worth seeing if you're out that way,4.0,,We went to see this while riding hired bicycles from our hotel to Changi Point. It's an architectural and engineering marvel.
,,A good escape in the middle of city,5.0,,Bring your family and a picnic basket and go! This place is really peaceful in the evenings although it takes a little effort to reach if you're not driving. My favourite place in Singapore so far.
,,Beautiful views of Singapore,4.0,,"This is probably one of the nicest views of Singapore you will get. There are a few restaurants dotted around, however there is a small hawker centre serving traditional food not far away. (Walking distance) Not good for rainy days"
,,"Unless you're up here for an event, it's probably not worth it.",3.0,,"It's a nice wide open, green, space - but very very very hot. Unless you're up here for an event, it's probably not worth it."
,,Average,3.0,,"The barrage is actually a dam built across the mouth of the river, to form a reservoir, and also help in flood control. But this being Singapore (that does most things well), the barrage is also turned into a park of sorts. But it's quite a distance (walking wise) from other places of interest, and as a destination in itself, it is not as great as Singapore's other parks. You can get a nice city view here, and being further away from the city, you do get away from the hustle and bustle here. Not bad, but not really outstanding either."
,,Nice place for kids to run.,3.0,,It a good place when weather not too hot for the kids to run around. got a big nice flat field and can fly kite there if u like to. Nice scenery too.
,,Its Bridge,3.0,,"What more can I say, Its a bridge. You can walk to the other side. Please use it for jogging and bike riding. make sure to have bottle of water, if your planing on walking it. Also some good photography opportunities."
,,A wonderful piece of architecture - an absolute must.,5.0,,Astonished by the size and complexity of the barrage. It is a dam between the freshwater of marina bay reservoir and the salt water of the sea. The museum on the first floor is excellent - there is a fully working scale model including rainfall when you push the button - and amazingly a grassy park on the roof. The barrage itself is 6 metres wide and travels right across the park. There are a number of viewing points across the bridge and a park on the other side. The views of Singapore are outstanding. All in all it took us around 2 hours but it is well worth the trip as not only do you see the workings of the barrage but there is a video of its history which traces the construction between 2005 and 2008. Amazingly it is free to the public.
,,good and useful place,5.0,,"good place to see new technology and innovation there, keep and reduce with recycle water around the city for clean and keep a pure water use a whole year of people in this country"
,,Picnic in the city,4.0,,"This is a beautiful place for a picnic, over looking the waters. There's a great view of the city if you walk all the way up to the top; you can see the Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Flyer and the ships not too far away. Bring a cool drink, tons of food, and you're set!"
,,Not very exciting.,3.0,,"Really, this is just a very average bridge. Don't expect anything at all like the Thames Barrage in London."
,,"Open space, wonder free",4.0,,"Nice view und windy, bring your kite along . You should able to fly das kite almost reaching to das golf course area. Also able to view das open sea where lots of big ship are anchor. Best to take das children too, where they are able to run free arouns there."
,,good picnic option not too far away from the city,4.0,,"pack your lunch / brunch and let the kids run riot. the only downside is that it gets incredibly hot around mid day. you could come down one level and there are a bunch of fountains that the kids car run around and play in. it helps cool them down. the barrage is a very popular kite flying (and now drone testing stop too); not to mention wedding / pre-wedding photography. so, try not to trip over tripods or the bride's veils"
,,"Relaxing, inspiring",4.0,,"The first time we went here was out of curiosity. You need a bit of walking from the bus stop but as you get a glimpse of the park, the sea and the structure, the weariness goes away.

It's a good place to relax, have a good view with the buildings, Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the bay on one side and the ships on the sea at the other side. Get your panoramic shots ready when you're on the open space at the 2nd (or was it third?) floor."
,,Romantic place and Good view,5.0,,"This place really impresses me. You can see the very nice view of Singapore. It is good to go there in the evening to watch sunset. Go with your lover will be nice because it is so romantic. Moreover, you can walk along the bridge or ride a bike. Go there in a clear sky day to catch a nice view and take a good photo"
,,From floods to newater- Very interesting place to visit!!,5.0,,"This is one of the must-see places in Singapore especially for people who understand and appreciate where Singapore has reached given their modest beginnings. There is a small water museum which showcases the sources of water for Singapore and has pictures and other AV which shows how the frequent floods were properly managed and used to improve Singapore's water security.
Also has a open grass patch for children to play. Good views of MBS and the city. Good place to fly kites also. Suggest a visit to the Satay-by-the-bay after visiting Marina Barrage."
,,Lazing around with a great view,4.0,,We were out there on the day after Chinese New Year (last day of the long weekend) & the place wasn't crowded. It's a good place to 'do nothing' & laze around. The view of the MBS & Singapore Flyer makes it worth a visit.
,,River crossing,3.0,,"This is a convenient way to cross the river and access the gardens on the other side, or for the more intrepid, to make your way onwards to East Coast Park. Given the weather conditions in Singapore this is much more easily achieved with a bike!"
,,A nice place to play kite,4.0,,"In the rooftop, there is a open space which is ideal for playing kite. A good place to see the fireworks too."
,,A noisy building site at the moment,2.0,,"Until June 2016 (according to their website) the site is undergoing major improvements.
All the water features have gone, and on a Saturday afternoon we were greeted by deafening drills breaking up concrete.
There was still some kite-flying going on, and I assume the exhibition is still open (we hated the noise, so didn't check this out). Apart from that there seems no reason to go there until the work is finished."
,,A quiet walk past the Marina complex and gardens,5.0,,"Walking from the Marina bay sands complex along the side of the river is a pleasant walk- to the barrage, where a lot of locals have family picnics and fly kites, an amazing view of the ships at anchor in the bay"
,,Good alternative hangout.,4.0,,"The Marina Barrage was built to keep seawater out of the Marina Channel to create Singapore's 15th reservoir and the only one in the city. The Visitor Centre (open from 9am to 9pm) is quite informative at describing Singapore's use of water resources over the years.

Guided tours are available, and can be arranged prior to arrival.

The grassy roof is a great place to admire the skyline, have a picnic, or fly kites.

The Barrage is open 24/7,"
,,Good for water sports and kite flying,4.0,,"love the location with city view, water sports and kite flying. may be crowded during school holidays and weekends"
,,Advanced sightseeing in Singapore,4.0,,"The Marina Barrage might not look very spectacular but it's actually a very unique and interesting piece of engineering to ensure part of the water supply for Singapore.
Even if you're not interested in the technology behind it, you still get a nice view of the skyline, and can enjoy an awesome roof top garden where you can have a picnic or play frisbee.
I also liked the fact that there's not so many tourist there.
If you're visiting the Gardens by the bay anyway, then it's just a short (maybe 10 min) walk to there, or you can also take the bus to go there (I think it's no. 400)."
,,Beyond the Gardens,4.0,,If you are visiting the gardens you can easily walk to this area which is great for relaxing and taking in the views.
,,Great place for a walk,4.0,,"beautiful view of Marina Bay. Great place for a walk or a bike ride, or just to sit with family and friends."
,,Go for an early morning sunrise picnic,5.0,,We went for an early morning picnic and saw the sunrise as well. Saw people later with kites flying them there and the waterplay area for the kids is really good fun
,,Nice view of Singapore skyline,4.0,,"One of my favourite spots to enjoy the sea breeze and view of Singapore's skyline and sea. Can be crowded during weekends but generally there are more than enough space for everyone. Do watch out for the lines of kite flyers esp. if you have young children and avoid stepping on those romantic couples if you are going at night.
There is a kind of pricey Satay by the Bay food court nearby."
,,Beautiful views,4.0,,Lovely views of the Marina Bay area. A nice 3 km walk for Marina Bay MRT station. Watched the beautiful National Day Fireworks from here.
,,Good place to view the entire city skyline of Singapore,4.0,,Good place to swing by if you are at the Garden by the Bay. Admission for the Marina Barrage is free. You can get to enjoy the entire city skyline of Singapore at the rooftop plains. Do visit this place (have a pinic) at around 5pm to 8pm so that you can enjoy the day and night view of my beautiful city. Elevator is available (wheelchair/stroller friendly).
,,Interesting!,4.0,,"The Barrage is at the end of the road that leads to gardens By The Bay. It's a short walk from the Satay eatery, nice place to relax and see the locals flying kites.

There is also a museum on level 2. See how one man's vision of turning a river once filled with filth to a clean, healthy and life-supporting reservoir."
,,Beautiful and strategic,4.0,,"After a full day of walking, this place, you still need to do more walking to the best spot. Super windy and stunning views. Good place to be at for a nice chilled and relaxing time."
,,Beautiful view of the Marina Bay area at night!,5.0,,"One of my favourite spots in Singapore - it is a stone's throw away from the city yet offers a relatively peaceful getaway. The views are superb at night. Mostly accessible by car or taxi, or you could bike down from the East Coast Park where there is a park route all the way to the barrage through Gardens by the Bay."
,,Kite flying,4.0,,A nice family outing and picnic place. It has a big field above ground where you can fly your kites. Get to know how the barrage contain the water away from the sea.
,,Great place to go if you are visiting Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"Great place to go if you are visiting Gardens by the Bay. Short 5 minutes walk from there.

Good to check out the exhibition gallery to see the model which shows how the barrage functions. Also lots of educational exhibits for kids.

Top level is great for picnic, fly kites, and playing games. Great for families and friends."
,,Beautiful place both day and night,4.0,,"Had a picnic session with a couple of friends some time back at the barrage. The best time to go there will be closing to sunset period as the top of the building is an open field concept for all to hangout under the sun. It overlooks towards the southeast of Singapore and the other end is the background of MBS and Singapore Flyer. Best place for taking night shots of the lights.

Lots of people bring their families to fly kites, play ball or Frisbee and picnic during the weekends. There are couple of eateries within the barrage, however you can even take a walk back towards gardens by the bay and it will bring you to satay club area for some hawker food.

Lastly, its a great place to learn abt the water system of the barrage and enjoy the weekend atmosphere."
,,"""Go fly kite"" comes to life literally here",5.0,,"Marina barrage is where the fresh water accumulated from all the rain in Singapore is contained from the Sea just outside the barrage. Marina Barrage is great for an evening with kids. As my friend puts it, you can literally ""go fly kite"" here. And fly kites we did."
,,Nice view,5.0,,We love the barrage so much. We ride a bus and enjoy taking photos and view there. Recommended! Don't miss.
,,Educational!,2.0,,"The barrage is an important structure to dam the water of the Singapore River and Kallang River for fresh water for the area consumption. There is a small museum to explain the usefulness of the barrage. Many people will come for sports, such as kayaking, or jogging around the area as well as some families playing kites with the kids. Good for families!"

The place is quite crowded during the weekends and one can get to see a variety of kites :-)
,,Awesome views and a cooling breeze from the sea,5.0,,"No doubt, you need to go there. Bring your friends and family, a blanket, some food either from home or from the Satay Bay Hawker some hundred meters away and enjoy this lovely green roof top (yes, the lawn is on the roof!). You can watch the big ships in the harbour, the amazing skyline, a romantic sunset or just many many many people flying their kites: small ones, funny ones, huge ones, illuminated ones....oh my gosh, you can see them all! A cooling breeze from the ocean makes this place truly nice. Be aware: there is no shelter from the sun and on weekends the place could be packed. Walking distance from MRT Bayfront (Exit Gardens by the Bay): roughly 20min or so. Just pass the Flower Dome and CLoud Forest and follow the road along the water until you reached its end. There you go...on the roof top! You will pass the Hawker some hundred meters before the Marina Barrage."
,,Wonderful drive,5.0,,"The Marina Barrage is a wonderful place to drive up to , one gets such a fantastic view , lovely places to eat all around & extremely clean"

,,"Just bike there if you can, fun little museum",3.0,,"We walked all the way from the eastern part of Singpore, over the Marina Barrage, to the Gardens By The Bay and into the center. The barrage isn't really worth it, unless you can travel there by bike. There's a nice little museum in the barrage building that explains how it was built and how Singapore strives to be best-in-class environmentally."
,,Excellent Trip for kids,4.0,,"Took my Son to this place as he missed his school trip due to travel. I find this to be a great way for kids to learn the importance of water and how Singapore manages its reserves.

The whole trip takes less than an hour, however you may get stuck if there is a pre-booked school trip.

Very informative for children."
,,Windy,5.0,,"It is actually a dam in a modern city. Nothing quite interesting but for spending quality time with families by having picnic is recommended, The place is also windy and a place for kite flyers."
,,let your minds open at marina barrage,4.0,,"I went there and it was very relaxing for my mind , i can think and just enjoy and relax the cool air and the wind that brushes through my hair . i felt free and comfortable. it was very relaxing ."

,,Not a particularly interesting tourist attraction. Worth visiting if you are in Marina Bay area.,3.0,,A pleasant and tranquil atmosphere offering a very good view of the Singapore waterfront. There is relatively liitle shade so you would be well advised to go late afternoon. Visitors who knew Singapore in the 70s and earlier can only wonder at all the reclamation work that has taken place in recent years.
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"Went here for an early morning picnic with the family. nice windy weather and great picnic spot on the rooftop. Saw many people flying kites there. What a fabulous view of Singapore from the rooftop. Cross the dam and on the other side is a nice garden to walk in. Many cyclists and walkers and people running. All fitness enthusiasts there in the morning. So overall a good atmosphere. Do not leave without viewing the Sustainable gallery on level 2. Must see is at the very end, the model of the entire barrage, which is LIVE. They actually show how the damn and barrage works. Water falls from the top to show rainfall and water levels rise on one side then, the dam opens etc. So good for the kids especially. There is also a water playground for the kids, carry a change of clothes if reqd after they get wet!"

,,Take a water taxi,5.0,,"Visit this area by water taxi and be awe struck by the magnificent sky line. There are still some of the old buildings from Colonial days but no doubt the best architects in the world have made their marks here in modern times - the buildings are spectacular. And there are some interesting bridges and sculptural gems to be seen along the way, too.
And, if you sit inside, you can hear a video commentary."
,,A step back to take a good look at Singapore,4.0,,"Marina barrage is an elevated structure with a big open field on top, perfect for flying kites and having a picnic. The best part of it, is the wide open view of the Singapore Skyline. Come at 5, and bring a mat or a kite! Strong winds await!"

,,Singapore 50th Birthday,5.0,,we went to Marina Barrage on the Singapore 50th National Day weekend to see the Red Knights air display. NO doubt it was crowded but the atmosphere was electric and it was a great place to watch the display. there was plenty of places to get something to eat and drink and access to all areas was very easy. the upper garden area was turned into a huge picnic spot of the weekend and a great time was had by all
,,Good place to run,3.0,,"I have to admit my only experience of the barrage is running across it a few times as part of various mass events. I'm trying to work out why else you would come here, or why you would stop to admire the view: there are really a lot better views in Singapore."
,,So many boats,5.0,,The best place to view Marina Barrage is from the Singapore Flyer. It's a good view out to sea with all the container ships waiting to come into port.
,,"Great place for picnic, flying kites and enjoying the sunset and city views",4.0,,"There is a big grass field at the top where people have picnics and fly kites. You can reach here from Gardens by the Bay or even cycling from East Coast!

There are also two restaurants at the Barrage that serve decent Chinese style seafood."
,,"Great view, did not regret.",5.0,,"Very nice view and good for family activities - picnic, kite-flying or even cycling. Went there last weekend and it was the air jet rehearsal for Singapore's 50th National Day. Awesome experience, keep walking around to discover more!"
,,Great views and worth the time.,4.0,,"The Marina Barrage's primary use is as a floodgate to ease flood issues in SIngapore. The smart thing was to convert the rooftop into a public park where the people of Singapore can really hang out here for picnic and kite-flying. The architecture wasn't done simply as space is an important asset in Singapore, hence I feel its very clever and well-used.

It is also within walking distance to other landmarks of Singapore and the walking path was pleasantly done. As usual, Singapore's places are done with very thoughtful details like wheelchair amenities and other facilities.

Very impressive indeed."
,,Great views and interesting exhibition,4.0,,Well worth a visit if you are at gardens by the bay. The barrage is effectively a bridge linking the gardens east and west sides. Great views of the ships and also a good place to fly kites on a windy day. There is a free exhibition which talks about how the barrage was built and water supply in Singapore. Worth a trip.
,,Great Spot for Sunset,5.0,,"I was there in the evening just before the sunset. It was a nice place, good for picnic or meet up your friends. It gives you kinda relax feeling.

Nearby have museum about the reservoir.

At the top you can find the green field where people come flying their kites and relaxing"
,,Nice place for a picnic or a stroll,4.0,,Marina Barrage is an amazing place to go for a stroll and have a picnic as the environment is really nice.

,,list this as one of your tour,4.0,,"accessibility: poor (get a cab)
environment: excellent

ok, basically, it shows you the water treatment and the purpose of the barrage. there is an exhibition hall with multi media to allow you to 'play'. lots of photo taking opportunities.

if you have a kite, you can head to the roof top and try your luck (i mean the wind).

if you are visiting gardens by the bay, you can pop by (its within walking distance but i guess you do not have the strength to walk after touring gardens).

things to avoid: no swimming allowed and no sun tanning too....."
,,An engineering structure converted to an excellent picnic spot/sight seeing attraction!,5.0,,"This is Singapore and hence expect engineering marvels! It's a water plant operated by PUB (Singapore) which is turned in to a fantastic tourist place. One can easily spend an entire day to few hours by either basking in the sunshine, kite flying, cycling or just relax and behold the marvelous Singapore skyline of business district.

The place is very nice if you wish to plan a picnic with your family or friends. Just bring in your snacks and begin the fun!

If you like kite flying, then the place offers very nice open space for flying kites with very good wind. Do carry water though there is water re-filling available.

Food options can be limited and hence one would like to carry some handy snacks or sandwiches. If you don't prefer to bask a lot in the sun, then a beach umbrella might come handy.

The place is very serene. It is very good for cycling and even for a long leisurely walk.

Getting there is easy. If you wish to drive or take a cab, then need to drive across Gardens by the Bay. Alternatively you can take a MRT to get to Gardens by the Bay and then walk across the Barrage."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"With my husband being a engineer in water and sewerage, he really wanted to see this. I found it to be very interesting and worth a look even if you only go once."
,,No clear directions to get there,2.0,,I made an attempt to visit a few months back but failed cus the bus stop was removed and no clear alternative directions to get there. Very out of the way and not enough public transport services to reach the place.
,,Great place to hang out,4.0,,"As usual with singapore, they turned what is basically an engineering structure into a place to hang out and relax and maybe have a meal. Only singapore can think of getting extra value from an engineering complex designed to stop seawater coming into the marina bay.

The other purpose is to dam the water so that the marina bay is being turned into a freshwater resource as singapore is a bit water scarce.

It's a nice place to view the marina bay from 'the other side' .

Go in the early evenings to enjoy the sunset and evening breeze."
,,Family outing,4.0,,Great plc to spend quality time with family..kids enjoy playing e kites n scooter ard the area..windy n breezy. Relaxing. Gd for family picnic n gathering too.
,,Nice place to spend time with family or friends,4.0,,"Nice place to fly kites, picnic, exploring in bicycles... you name it. Love this area as there's sheltered and no shelter area for everyone to just enjoy time with friends or family."
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,Simply amazing views back into Singapore or of the many ships waiting to enter the docks. Magnificent engineering feat and quite amazing to think it was put in place. We caught a boat up to Marina Bay and walked the last km. Caught the 400 bus back to the MRT station. Put this on your list for Singapore.
,,Great night view,4.0,,"Always open. No entry fee. Can visit in the wee hours to catch the night view of Singapore, including the flyer, gardens by the bay, etc."
,,Great for gatherings and knowledge abt water in Singapore,5.0,,"A nice place where u can have gathering, place to fly kites, small games. Restaurants available too. Also a place where u can understand water in Singapore too."
,,Wide Open Spaces and Learn About Singapore's Marina Bay!,4.0,,"A little out of the way, but you can enjoy wide open spaces and also the city view!

This attraction has wide open spaces and you can also learn about Singapore's Marina Bay!

This is also near the Gardens By The Bay, so you can include it in your itinerary."
,,Beautiful and Relax,5.0,,"From the top you can see Marina bay sands, Singapore Flyer, Garden by the bay and sea. Recommend to picnic there. It's relaxing place."
,,"High rating, but I think it's worth",5.0,,"Singapore is a city where you are constatnly in awe of many things, man made or natural; where you walk around with your nose in the air and where you are constantly push or pressed or anyway in close proximity of people. In such an amazing city I found the barrage and the pumping an exccellent mix of nature, open spaces, interesting people (they fly kites here by simply hooking them to a stone, lay back and just watch them) and local culture. the building itself is very interesting and you can appreciate it fully only after you have walked up anddown and you have gone through the exhibition. The exhibition is well organised and tell you a lot about th ehistory not simply of water management but of the whole city. Another tile to understand its essence.
Within easy walking distance from the Marina Bay.
If I only had a little time downtown I would definetely stroll down here through the gardens."
,,Kite flying? oh yeah,5.0,,"This is awesome place to go at night for the best night view of singapore! There will be people who fly kites at evening and night, you may want to grab some drinks over there (non alcoholic) and picnic!"
,,Best place of singapore,5.0,,"Many people don't know abt it as it's kind of hidden. But evening time, take some snacks & go & sit here till midnight & u feel so very refreshed. View from the roof top is amazing & can't be captured in a camera.
Must visit!!!"
,,What a view,5.0,,"Marina Barrage is a good place for a relaxed Sunday outing when you can let yourself and your kids loose, running around the place, flying kites, having a picnic, clicking pictures or just relaxing under the evening sky. Children love to play in the water area, where as the older boys prefer to run around chasing the kites and flying their own. The spectacular view of the skyline forms a perfect backdrop for your photo album."
,,Want to go again,5.0,,"was little bit late to be here , reached after sun set :( missed the day light view. ..

but as started walking through the bridge.. night view of Singapore flyer , marina bay sands on the other side make me feel good. went to roof top .. luckily garden bay the bay light and show started that time. view was amazing that time , now don't have any regrets that I reached late :)

this place is very good for jogging, walking , cycling and roof top for family picnic and evening outing..

best time to reach - before sunset - latest by 6:30pm so you can enjoy the day light view as well.

gardens by the bay light show at 7:45pm better to see from the roof top.

how to reach - 400 bus directly reach here from marina bay mrt station.

while returning you can walk along the marina bay, and reach the helix bridge."

,,a good place to play kite,3.0,,this is a spot for family to play kite......they have a kite stall there..... quite enjoying especially for those kids to learn play kite...
,,One simple conclusion: a modern country doesn't built in an instant,5.0,,"A great place that will show you, that a modern country such as SIngapore, does not built in an instant. Here you can see the full process of how Singapore transformed to one of the cleanest city (country) in the world. Not only as a reservoir, it is also a great place to hangout and have a picnic with family and friends. Perfect for a short getaway from other busy parts of SIngapore"
,,I felt like a kid again,5.0,,"The breeze was nice and steady, the venue interesting, and the kite flying amazing. There were about 80 Girl Scouts there, which was tons of family fun. An elderly Chinese gentleman came over and showed 3 strangers and myself how to untangle from each other while keeping our kites in the air! The views of the city are quite nice, even if the city looks like a goofy scifi movie. The view is probably really great at night too."
,,"A great place for kite flying, picnic & chilling with friends.",3.0,,"Family friendly place with lots of space for the kids to run, skate, scoot or cycle. Go in the evening to see kite enthusiasts flying kites decorated with LED lights. Pretty sight!"
,,dam buster,4.0,,"Marina Barrage was built to The cost of S$226 million .this project turns Marina Bay and Kallang Basin into a new downtown freshwater Marina Reservoir. By keeping out seawater, the barrage forms Singapore‚Äôs 15th reservoir and first reservoir in the city. Marina Barrage also acts as a tidal barrier to keep seawater out, helping to alleviate flooding in low lying areas of the city such as Chinatown, Jalan Besar and Geylang. When it rains heavily during low-tide, the barrage‚Äôs crest gates will be lowered to release excess water from the reservoir into the sea. If heavy rain falls during high-tide, the crest gates remain closed and giant drainage pumps are activated to pump excess water out to sea. Marina Basin makes it ideal for all kinds of recreational activities such as boating, windsurfing, kayaking and dragon boating etc. If water sports are not your thing, then head to the rooftop of the barrage, which boasts a green space that‚Äôs popular for flying a kite, or just to chill out with the family. The facility is an engineering and construction is a masterpiece, if you have time I do recommend the visit.."
,,"Kite flying, great views, friendly caf√©",5.0,,"We love to come here at dusk, when kite flying peaks. City views as it gets dark are something special. There‚Äôs a water feature, with fountains and lots of spray, which is great for cooling off at the end of a hot day as visitors are welcome to paddle in it - but keep the water clean by taking off footwear. Great fun, and lovely views from it.
In addition the roof area has nice cool breezes (otherwise the kites wouldn‚Äôt fly), plus brilliant views. And if you get a bit wet in the water feature, you‚Äôll soon dry in the breeze! There‚Äôs a lift as well as stairs, so the disabled can enjoy it.
Once it‚Äôs dark, watch out for the illuminated kites, they‚Äôre quite something to see.
Do walk onto the barrage itself, it‚Äôs impressive. Don‚Äôt miss seeing the huge pumps used to lower the water level in the river. In the daytime, the exhibition is interesting. It shows the dreadful problem Singapore used to have with floods, and how they are now managing their limited water reserves (yes they‚Äôre short of water, and have problems with floods).
Practical points:
Getting there, you have 3 choices, the 400 bus stops nearby, unfortunately it‚Äôs only every 20 minutes. There used to be a water taxi, but that no longer runs (although it still appears on the company‚Äôs website). Our favourite route is the short walk from Gardens by the Bay. It‚Äôs along the riverside, with nice cool breezes and lovely views. For drivers, there is a large car park.
There‚Äôs a pleasant restaurant at the Barrage. It‚Äôs cheap, but the food is tasty, and they are very friendly and helpful. We normally took the food as a takeway, and settled ourselves at one of the many seats.
There are several toilet blocks (1 with outside showers). They are all very clean.
There is also a convenience store. It‚Äôs hard to find, but it‚Äôs roughly opposite the caf√© and near another toilet block. You can buy kites and snacks there.
If you only have a few days in the city, it‚Äôs not a top place to visit unless you‚Äôre in Gardens by the Bay and want somewhere open and breezy. But if you are here longer, you really should come and enjoy it."
,,Nothing to see here,3.0,,"If you are here on a short stopover I would not waste your time, even though it is free. Yes there are some decent views of the CBD if you walk to the top of the barrage structure, but still very little to merit the walk from Gardens by the Bay."
,,Great place for kite flying,4.0,,The roof of the Marina Barrage is covered in grass and usually gets enough wind to make it a popular place for kite flying. Conveniently there is a shop on the ground level that sells kites. Also usually a few interesting displays on the lower levels. Views out to the city and beyond are pretty good too.
,,Great view of Singapore skyline,5.0,,Came here on recommendation of a friend & was not disappointed. Best time to visit is during sunset to have great view Singapore CBD against the silhouette of sunset & the subsequent night views. Lots of locals having picnic & flying kites on the large grassy area above the driveway.
,,Relax and refreshing place for the whole family,5.0,,"after exhausting day visiting several places in singapore. I decided to come to Marina Barrage for a closure. But turn out, it was boosting our energy again. There weren't any entry charge to get in Marina Barrage. But the place was totaly great.
The kids love it, just prepare the extra cloth, because it had mini water park for kids to play with. The view was great, we could easily view singapore landmarks.
Totally recomended if you were traveling with families with young children."
,,Promenade with a fantastic view,5.0,,"Mrt Stadium .Walk to the bridge, cross over and walk along the river up to the barrage. You will see the skyline of the city from a quiet area along a park and golf club.
You can either walk or ride a bike.
Great at sunset!
On the other side of the barrage ,stop at the food court Satay by the bay for a cool juice and try local foods.
Finish the walk in Gardens by the bay with the light show under the giant trees at 7:45 or 8:45 pM everyday.It's magical."
,,Great little hideout,5.0,,"This place is great for taking photos at night, of Marina Bay Sands and the Flyer. Parking is free and entrance is free too. Lots of locals come here to hangout and also for picnics in the evening/night."
,,Vast sky garden,4.0,,"Great place to spend a day away from buildings. Pack a picnic basket, portable fan, cool drinks, and voila! Great time with great view. I went there on Sunday afternoon and was amazed by the colorful and giant kites flown by the visitors.
Just stroll along the river on the way back to Bayfront MRT station."
,,AMAZING,5.0,,"we went out to see the Barrage, it was very warm, but we made it,
it was very interesting to see, how the made it,( saw it in tv, and how it was made, last year!).
upstairs there is a green lawn, where you can put your kite up, it is very good.
there where awesome views toward the city and the garden."
,,Interesting but not if you have limited time,4.0,,"It wasn't an easy place to get to- we took a cab as we had kids with us and we didn't want to walk from the mrt.

We went there primarily for the kids to experience and see the dam and learn about water recycling. It was an interesting experience and we saw kids on school trips there."
,,Interesting views from a distance,4.0,,Our tour guide said we might see people flying a kite and we did. We enjoyed the cool breeze while we viewed the skyline.
,,Just go!,5.0,,"It seems like quite a long walk out of the main area but worth it because on top of this water barrier area is the most amazing green space, like a huge field on top of a building. Great for flying kites or simply chilling out, the barrage offers the most incredible sights of Singapore and is great for photographs."
,,Water control,4.0,,The unique way the island regulated the flow of water into another of its water conservation plan. Worth looking to appreciate the scarcity of resources.
,,Good views and cool breeze,4.0,,"We took part of our wedding photos On top of the marina barrage. The views turned out great as you have the marina bay sands.in the background as well as the whole marina bay scenes.

Its built to stop seawater flowing into marina bay which has since been.concerted into.a fresh water bay as a a result of this barrage. Its also used as a flood control instrument.

However, bring singapore...they have converted this engineering structure into a tourist attraction as well as a place for families to come and relax and view.the sunsets etc.

It has a very comfortable environment where you can sit and enjoy what has become THE singapore sight and relax with the family."
,,"Not too far from the city, a little oasis",4.0,,Have watched the barrage or flood mitigation mechanism being built over the years but this is the first time I have visited the centre. Arrived by taxi and walked back (bay front MRT is the closest). Visitor centre right on the barrage with great tracks and manicured lawns. Excellent interactive display on their water philosophy and lots of helpful signs. Walk back to the city skirts the most excellent parklands and forest garden by the bay. Seamless integration for which Singapore is famous.
,,Love skyline,4.0,,"Nice weather and shining sunbeam made the skyline perfect. That day, a marathon? or a contest was held. Lots of runner ""jogged"" along the waterfront."
,,Magnificent skyline,4.0,,"This is my revisit after 6 years. The skyline has changed so much and it is magnificent.

A group of friends and I actually took a leisure walk from Promenade MRT station on a beautiful evening. What impressed me was the path is actually separated into lanes for cyclist and pedestrians, so we can relax and enjoy the views along the way.

Great place to rest and relax."
,,Fantastic view!,5.0,,Love Marina Barrage! The skyline view of Singapore its fantastic. Great place to relax and see kite flying.
,,"lotsa sky, sea, space",5.0,,"sky....sea....space.... are 3 things that makes me happy and Marina Barrage has lotsa it!

I guess the main downside of Marina Barrage is that it needs car to access as public transport is is limited to Bus 400 from Marina Bay MRT. What a lot of people don't know is that Marina Barrage is just 10 min walk from Satay by the Bay and 15min walk from the Children water play area at Gardens by the Bay. So you can have an outing at the children play area, pack some dinner at Satay by the Bay (not recommended though as the food is expensive and disappointing, pack your own picnic preferably) and talk a short walk to Marina Barrage for picnic with losta sky....sea....space.... Bring a kite along and join the others in decorating the sky with colourful shapes and creatures."
,,Best view of Singapore.,4.0,,"If you are thinking of looming at some of the iconic buildings in singapore, this is the place you have to visit, away from the city, marina barrage is a best place for your family to come together and enjoy a picnic."
,,Overlooking view of Marina Bay,4.0,,"Attractive lights all over the place (atvnight of course). Going up its track is good when biking or jogging. There is no light at the top of the barrage but it is an open area where people can have picnic, sightseeing, workout and enjoy the city skyline view of Singapore CBD, especially the remarkable sight of the colorful Singapore Flyer and Marina Bay Sands famous structure. (visited March 2011)"
,,Nice and Cozy Place,4.0,,"It is a very cozy place and you can see children flying kites, teenagers gathering and also some families picnic here. You can also have a very good view of Marina Bay here."
,,Impressive view of the sea and Singapore skyline,3.0,,Impressive views of the sea and the Singapore skyline. Nice rooftop grass area. I strongly suggest to go early - or very late. It gets awfully hot there.
,,Fascinating exhibition,5.0,,"Find out how Singapore manages water which is a fantastically complicated but interesting story on this island which is massively overpopulated and subject to extraordinary weather. Interactive, great for kids and most importantly, air conditioned."
,,Lovely place with best view of skyline,5.0,,This place is wonderful in the morning and also at night. You can a different feel coming at dfferent times. Best of all is the free parking! Not many places with free parking in Singapore. Bring your camera for beautiful views of the CBD skyline!
,,Nice off tourist track,4.0,,"It's nice, breezy, another angle to view famous SG MBS, Flyer, Gardens, windy, not many ppl, almost only local come here to do picnics with families and dragonflies with children. Highly recommended, if you are tired of posh standard views of SG."
,,An excellent concept,4.0,,"Going to Singapore is always an inspiring experience. I was recommended to visit the Marina Barrage and not disappointed by the experience.
Visited the Singapore Water Story which was very interesting and informative. Walked around the gardens and could see kids having fun with the different water animations. Where ever you look you can discover exciting activities such as Kite Flying, enjoy some tasty safe's.
Well done Singapore !!!"
,,"Picnic, Kites and hanging out",4.0,,"If you are somewhere nearby Marina Bay, you can drop by this place. The nearest MRT station is Bayfront and you can walk from the station all the way to the Barrage, you will pass by Gardens by the Bay.

The top of the barrage is where you should head to, it is entirely grass and it is a great place for picnics and playing of kites. There are also great places on the barrage to see the view of the Singapore skyline, don't forget to snap one or two photos.

There is also a tour inside the barrage. If you want a good family bonding picnic session, try this place.

However take note, there is barely any shops or cafe nearby. (The cafe that used to be here closed down the last time I came to the Barrage.)"
,,Great quiet place to hang out at,5.0,,Quite a distance from Gardens by the Bay but this is truly a great place to be at at night. Recommended for a night picnic to view the city lights.
,,"Fly a kite, learn about water ...",4.0,,"The best way to get here is via a car or taxi. It is quite a distance from Gardens by the Bay to walk though it is 'next door'. From the roof top, I enjoyed the wide angle view of surrounding business district to marina bay sand. Flying kites at the roof top is ideal as there are no obstructions, provided there is wind. Pleasant place for both day or night views. The exhibition area on level 2 is informative, creative and interesting. Ground floor has a few interesting sculptures and small water fountain areas spreaded around. On most days, the place feels hot, perhaps if some of the walking areas were not cemented but made of wood and with more shades provided, the place would feel cooler instead of having a concrete feel all over. Definitely, worth visiting."
,,Average place,3.0,,"May be i was expecting great views on a hot day. Just average place i would say, lots of people there to fly kite.
There is a exhibition centre at level 2, quite impressive, gives a lot of information about barrage, concepts and a demo.

I would strongly recommend to go in evening only to escape heat."
,,Picnic on mind!!!,4.0,,"If you would like to spend quality time outdoors with your family without distractions from cars, street lights, food courts - do visit marina barrage for a evening of fun. One of best places to organize picnic with a small group of friends. Can go and fly a kite here Singapore style Suggest you to take food and light snacks along if you wish to spend few hours."
,,Educational short stop,4.0,,"The barrage is worth the short stroll from the Gardens by the Bay. Though not an attraction, I found the visitor center very educational and worth a short visit. It is also free. You learn about the visionary and engineering feat that went into turning the entire Marina Bay into a freshwater reservoir. The stroll across the barrage bridge takes you into a shaded waterfront park that is worth exploring as well."
,,Relaxing and beautiful night scape,3.0,,"I will strongly recommend a picnic to accentuate the experience. Enjoy strong breeze and beautiful cityscape afar. With a good weather and right mood, enjoy a memorable picnic with your love ones on marina barrage."
,,"OK, for a little stroll",2.0,,"The walk from the Gardens by the Bay all the way down to Marina Barrage is a very hot one, with literally no respite from the sun's glare. You should plan your trip to the Barrage accordingly, possibly even wait until the evening. When you are there, you will find that it is a very educational place, with small exhibits for children and adults alike. Many people come here to fly kites on the top of the Barrage Main Building, as there is certainly a lot of wind around here. The walk across the actual barrage itself is the highlight for me though, it takes around 10 minutes to walk across, and there are 4 or 5 sheltered seating areas positioned across the way, which you can use to shelter from the sun or the rain. It's just a shame that there is not anything to do the other side. You can walk back down to the Singapore Flyer, or turn around and walk back across to the Barrage building. There is also a caf√© and sufficient toilets in the vicinity. Marina Barrage is completely free and is something that young families can do to pass the time (i.e. fly a kite), but there's not much here to interest people of other ages."
,,City in a garden,4.0,,"Suggest a beautiful walk along the coast starting from the Singapore Flyer to Garden by the Bay and up to the top of marina barrage. Definitely a well designed and well integrated garden. Right at the top of marina barrage, look back and see the aspiration of Singapore - to be a City in a Garden. And in the distance, the towering blocks of commercial buildings in the Central Business District. Visited Jan 2013."
,,"Impressive, worth a visit",4.0,,"Finding out the water in Singapore river is fresh! how they manage that! and how they cope with floods is fascinating. A trip to the barrage by water taxi $4 from Clifford, gives the best views of the Flyer, city skyline, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the gardens, the garden domes, apartments and if you're lucky the dragon boat races. Kites are flown at the barrage on the weekends so the sky can be a blaze of colour. Great fountains for water play for the kids as well. You can walk across the barrage or up the top if you're keen. It is a good stop off and only a short walk, via Satay on the Bay (for a drink, snack or meal) to the Cloud Forest, Flower Dome and gardens by the sea."
,,Impressive in intent and execution,4.0,,"The Marina Barrage in Singapore is uplifting in the way it shows the ingenuity of humans and their engineering skills. Of course it helps to have truck loads of cash.... something the Singaporean government has...

Effectively the Singapore Barrage is a barrier that prevents the Singapore River from flowing freely into the ocean and it's creation, largely connecting two chunks of reclaimed land, creates one of Singapores fresh water reservoirs. As such it is an impressive piece of architecture and the displays in the attendant building do much to explain how it all works.

On top of the building - which can be accessed via a ramp or lift - is a grassed area that is lovely for watching the world go by and features an array of solar panels that provides the buildings power supply.

Access to the barrage isn't necessarily easy, it is a bit of a hike but if you have the time and inclination it could be combined with a visit to Gardens by the Bay (with a lunch stop at the small food court between the two thrown in)."
,,Good Place for a picnic,4.0,,"If you want to have a picnic, play kite, walk your dogs, running around with your kids, this place is perfect. Not as noisy as the rest area in the Marina, great view especially in the afternoon when the sun is colder, the breezy wind and city lights starting to light on.

But it's a bit troublesome to get to this place. Must take MRT then take a bus which must be wait a bit long."
,,Lovely view of the CBD,5.0,,"This place is rather inaccessible. But it offers a lovely view of the Central Business District (CBD).

You can walk around the bridge to reach East Coast Park or walk along the river to Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands.

You can also walk upwards to get a panoramic view of the CBD. Lovely all around!!"
,,Nice architecture,4.0,,Its only reservoir building but nice architecture.. Verry interesting with grass on top.... U can walk from garden bays.. its near maybe just 1 km.... Take a way in side of garden building.. and u will found it..
,,Great Place to Visit and It's Right Across the Marina Downtown,4.0,,"Visit this place if you have an interest in engineering projects, particularly water related ones, or if you just want to enjoy great views of the Singapore city skyline.

The visitors' centre is full of educational info, and there's even a simulation of the barrage in action on the 2nd floor in the gallery. I say ditch the guided tour though and just opt for one of the audio tour headsets (both are free).

Kite-flying in the windy area on the rooftop garden is popular, however bring your own as I don't think there are any shops selling kites there.

You'll also want to stroll out along the 350m long barrage wall, for good views and a whiff of the sea air. Visit at night if you are a shutterbug and good at nighttime photography!

You can read my blog post about my recent visit to the Marina Barrage and a commentary on how the barrage has possibly affected flooding in Singapore.

,,Interesting Engineering Project,5.0,,"Great city views. A quieter area on weekdays.
Excellent information displays.
One of the best free attractions.
Easy walk from Marina Bay MRT stations and Gardens by the Bay.
Parking available and a taxi drop off and pick up area.
Popular spot to reach by cycling."
,,Most beautiful reservoir in singapore,5.0,,"It's windy and the views are spectacular. If u are lucky, u get to see wedding couples taking their photoshoots here too! Go up to the openspace and pose with the spore flyer right behind you!"
,,Lovely space to escape the crowds,5.0,,"Marina Barrage is a wonderful place, if you want to avoid the crowds. It was the only place in Singapore where I felt I could breathe! Everywhere else the crowds were just suffocating. Marina Barrage is very interesting as an engineering structure and one can learn a lot from the excellent exhibits. The grass-covered roof terrace is wonderful! Great for having a picnic, kite flying, and enjoying the city vista. Very nice place in every aspect, but, once again, the best part for me was the relatively small number of people. I guess Marina Barrage in not well known yet? I almost wish it would stay that way, but I feel I should share my experience with other travelers who may find the rest of Singapore way overpopulated. I highly recommend Marina Barrage for a day out."
,,Great place for City & Sea view,4.0,,"It is a nice place for family picnic or a romantic date. Very near to Gardens by the Bay. We were lucky to see the International Kite Fliers when we visited the place. It‚Äôs a amazing to see many shapes and sizes of kites flying in the sky. Some of the kites were having social messages. Very colourful sight all around. Great view to see the City Sky Line, Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands, Supertrees in the Gardens by the Bay, Cloud Forest and Flower Dome on one side and sea on the other side."
,,Amazing View,4.0,,"This place is great for picnic, We could see lot of people flying kites and lot of people gathered together for recreation. We will have a great view of Gardens by the bay, Marina Bay etc. The best part is the sunset.

The barrage is a huge structure distinguishing the seawater from the fresh water. The rainwater is stored in the reservoir. If the Barrage is viewed from a height then the seawater looks darker than the reservoir water because it is deeper.We can hire guide to gave us a brief idea of how the dam worked. (This was part of our Industrial visit)"
,,Amazing View of the city,5.0,,"Beautiful View of the City and Marina Bay Sands..
You could walk on the bridge to the other side of the river and come back.

Best to club the visit with Gardens by the Bay.

There is a nice food court available, by the river, as you walk from marina barrage, past the gardens by the bay.. with many options - asian as well as western

To reach by public transport:
Bus 400 --- Frequency of 15-20 mins
Take Exit A from Marina Bay MRT Station. The bus stop is about 2 mins walk from the MRT Station.
Alight at the last bus stop"
,,Perfect Place to Chill !,4.0,,"Great place for picnics, kite flying, get together - just about everything. Great views of the marina bay area and the harbour. Very near to the Gardens by the bay, makes up for a nice evening to spend.Sunset views are at the best at times.Water fountains available for kids to have fun. Overall - a good place."
,,Unexpectedly charming,5.0,,"On a Sunday afternoon you find people having fun, with kites and without kites, but with the shipping on one side, the city skyline on the other, and a big lawn, and walks, on which to pass the time in aimless happiness. A really good atmosphere. Parking and entrance free, and you can walk into the new gardens. Very good indeed."
,,A Pleasant Surprise,4.0,,"We came across the Barrage after a long walk through Marina Bay Gardens. There is a curved path up to the top of the Barrage building and and on top, a lovely grassed area with a beautiful view of Singapore. It was about the only time we saw Singaporean families having picnics sitting on the grass! Kids and adults were flying kites and generally enjoying themselves. The view of the city at dusk was beautiful..well worth the visit. We didn't see the inside of the building , due to lack of time (unfortunately)."
,,A magnificent viewing point for Singapore,5.0,,"Marina Barrage is our favorite place for outing. A perfect place for family outings and picnics. Ideal for kite flying. Make sure you take your picnic basket, kites and your camera to click the magnanimous pictures of the Singapore skyline. Set just opposite to Marina Bay Sands,marina barrage gives an excellent view of the gardens by the bay as well. With water flowing to your right, gardens in front of you and the marina bay sands illuminating with its lights, MB takes you into a paradise. Just lie down and look at the sky counting the hundreds of kites soaring in the sky.
It also has a museum that give you an idea of the water purification system in Singapore.hence it's not just a picnic spot but an educational place as well."
,,Nice night views from side of Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,Nice place to walk around after dinner. We had some local friends take us there otherwise we probably wouldn't have known about the area. You can take the elevator up and get a good view across to Marina Bay Sands
,,Night view,4.0,,"The Marina Barrage is an excellent place to catch the night view of The Singapore Flyers, Marina Bay Sands as well as the Benjamin Sheares Bridge. On top of the night view, you can hang out with your friends and family at the barrage for pinic or kite flying at the spacious green field. Parking is free and rest rooms are conveniently located on the ground level."
,,Excellent place to mix a little education with relaxation,4.0,,"The Marina Barrage is a wonderful, serene place to get some exercise done, walk the dog, fly a kite or have a picnic. Lots of open space and greenery and the educational exhibition (free) provided an excellent place to cool down from the heat of Singapore. The roof garden (free) in particle is lovely... great views all around! Plus, the area is wheelchair friendly."
,,Should rank higher as a tourist spot,4.0,,"First saw it on tv as it was a pit stop in Amazing Race Asia. It's a dam, something like the Thames Barrier in London and was built to control the river water level and prevent floods. The most interesting exhibit in the very educational and well designed first floor gallery was a mechanical scaled-down model of the barrage with water and all to show how the dam functions. The building with its curved ramp that one can walk on up to the top/green roof and the views from it are quite spectacular and the best thing is that it's all free. Certainly worth a visit and it's very close to Gardens By The Bay."
,,"Kite flying, picnic, people watching",4.0,,"The family drove there on Sunday evening. Had to wait about 10 mins for a parking lot. There were quite a number of cars waiting but the turnover was quite fast.
Lovely view of the Singapore Flyer, the Central Business District and Suntec.
The rooftop field was pretty crowded - many groups with picnic mats full of food & beverages, a couple of dog owners, lots of kite flyers running around trying to get the kites up and flying, a few frisbees. People were gathered just there, determined to enjoy each others company while enjoying the view & the breeze.
At the ground floor, children can have fun at the water jets & fountains. More than enough room for all. We enjoyed a slow & relaxing evening."
,,"Great views, and educational too!",4.0,,"A very interesting concept to open up a public works facility as an attraction. Learn about Singapore's water story, whilst roaming the roof terrace and barrage itself to enjoy wonderful views of the Singapore city skyline."
,,A pleasent experience,4.0,,"Walked along the river through Garden by the bay east and crossed the Marina Barrage in scorching sun.The cafe on the first floor was a big relief, It serves breverages and snacks at a resonable price and offers a very nice view of the barrage the river and the sea.The terrace garden on the top also has a great view and is used by people to fly kites.Spending an hour in the evening here is worth it."
,,Great photography set but nothing more,3.0,,"I think my title sums it all... This place is great for photography enthusiast especially in the evening where you can have a full view of light at marina bay sands, singapore flyers, and surrounding buildings ready to be photograph..

Nothing more to add really.. It's pretty dull and not much to do or see.."
,,Relaxing and fly kite,4.0,,nice place to hang out or fly kite on the roof of the marina barrage building. you have a nice view on the whole skyline of singapore
,,Did the Marina Barrage Visitor Centre,5.0,,See how the Singaporeans have built a water reservoir on the door steps of the central business district. One hell of an infrastructure achievement.
,,Ex-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's crowning jewel.,5.0,,"Good: -Great to fly kites. -Windy at night. -Great place to enjoy the panoramic skyline at night. Bad: -Limited water dispensers, no bottled water sold on site. -Limited to sports enthusiasts for their activities. -Limited eateries."
,,Good place to hangout,4.0,,"Its a long walk from the Gardens by the Bay but was worth the effort as it gave us a great view of the Singapore skyline. Great place for photography enthusiasts to capture the Singapore skyline as one can see the Business District buildings, the Supertrees, Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Singapore Flyer all from one location."
,,Not much to do or see here..,3.0,,"It has nothing much to offer besides the view of (possibly) Singapore's largest water reservoir. You'll also see lots of people crowding the grassy areas with picnic stuffs, while having to maneuver around to avoid tripping others' kites.

There's some interesting info inside the air-conned building (can't remember the name anymore). If you're looking for a temporary escape from the heat, do visit that building. Otherwise, have fun picnicking with a gazillion other people."
,,Not a tourist attraction but educational,2.0,,"Marina Barrage is interesting if you are keen to learn about Singapore's remarkable water management system. Otherwise, it is not worth a visit if you are a tourist. There are so many competing ""attractions"" in Singapore that you can leave Marina Barrage for much later, if at all.

The exhibition itself is educational from a technical point of view. There are some nice colorful displays and the simulation of the water from the bay management system is quite good.

It is, however, a place mainly for students. It is dead quiet in the morning we went. A plus is that, I suppose, and you get plenty of excellent views of the bay area."
,,Great place for kites along with peace & quiet,4.0,,Perfect Hangout place for kite enthusiast ... Be fantasized by LED lighted night kites on special dates like valentines
,,Marina Barrage,5.0,,I like the open air and space. You can learn how water is treated there. At night there are many people flying kites. Away from the city crowd.
,,A terrific place to fly kite,5.0,,"It used to be a water damp in Singapore and was later converted to an kinda open space park in a hill shape where people usually patron to fly kites. Try to reach after 4pm when the daylight is still bright yet the sunlight is not that harsh on you.

The barrage is designed as an uphill shape so there's a little bit of mild climbing. Bring along your kite and wait for good wind to fly it up. Every trip of mine is immensely enjoyable seeing not only my kite but also kites from others that are designed in different shapes and colors. This place has one restaurant as well if you want to spend some dinner time there. Also, it overlooks to the city center as it is located in Maria Bay, the South of Singapore. Therefore you can see Singapore Flyers from afar.

There is one shuttle bus from Marina Bay MRT station to take you to the barrage and the waiting time is around 15-20mins. Entrance is free but this place is more popular among locals or those who have lived in Singapore for a while rather than tourists considering the fact that there're other interesting places for tourists to visit in a short stay of few days."
,,A good place to stroll.,4.0,,"A good place to go for morning, evening or night walk. Just a lazy stroll and enjoy the beautiful view of the Singapore city and sky skrapers."
,,A good plcae to fly kites and learn about New Water,4.0,,The whloe experience you want to know about new water. The whole exhibition is intereactive. I like the part where they built a model on the dam and show viewer on what happens when the water has reach a certain level and where the water will flows through. The wind is strong and on weekends you will find people flying kites there. There is a MOUTH restaurant located at marina barrage and the pork chop is excellent.
,,outing,3.0,,"brought a group of patient for outdoor activities late last year,....the staff are accommodating and even the cafe nearby....and arraged some space for us for our own program....the top is good for flying kite with your family and friends...but for a big tour group....its quite difficult to manage as there was only one lift to the top"
,,Leisure for picnic or kite flying.,5.0,,"Yes, to visit all the greens in Singapore, this is the right place for you. To either hang out with your friends or family. This is a good place for you to enjoy a basking under the sun while having a picnic or accompany your kids and friends to kite flying.
A side note that their restaurant and kites sold there are a little more expensive. So if you decide to have a lunch do buy your own pack lunch before going there and kite elsewhere. I bought my kite for 30$ with strings."
,,A must must must do,5.0,,"Sooooo interesting and sooooo under promoted,I NLT found out about it by accident. It's a free tour,and our guide,James, was wonderful. He packed in so much info but had so much more when questioners. An another amazing Singaporean project,just fascinating.
It makes you really think about things in your own country but wakens you up to Singapore's unique environmental issues and the proactive steps to solve them."
,,Nice,4.0,,"Pretty far to travel if you don't have a car. But the views are nice, there are some eating places and its a good place to try some kite flying."
,,Great opportunity for Photos,4.0,,We went to Marina Barrage for a pre weeding photography session and i have to admit that this place is better than expected. You have a great view of the skyline of Singapore especially the marina bay and singapore flyer.
,,must visit,4.0,,"Marina Barage is simply amazing. My family had a great time and so did I. There isn't so much to do but, the view is to die for."
,,exceed my expectation,5.0,,"another venue in SG where you can enjoy the ""GREEN"" and have some picnic.

Went there for kite-flying and picnic on a Sunday, there are a lot people there, crowded but not that bad. We are able to find a spot, and enjoy ourselves there.

will definitely go there again."
,,Did not expect to enjoy our trip to Marina Barrage,4.0,,"As the Marina Barrage car park is free, at least for the time being, we were advised to park at Marina Barrage and walk to Satay By The Bay, just a short distance away where we were going to have our dinner.

To our surprise, the Marina Barrage is an interesting place to visit and you can learn more about water conservation in Singapore. Previously we just saw the aerial view which looks just like a field.

The Marina Barrage is a dam built across the Marina Channel which houses the Marina Reservoir, the largest reservoir to date as well as the first reservoir to be built in the city centre. You can grab water taxis there or take part in some water sports.

If you love the outdoors, the Marina Barrage is a great place to visit. Have a picnic there or indulge in kite flying... Or just relax and enjoy the exhibits and water fountains where kids love to play and get wet.

You can also visit the Gardens by the Bay, another free attraction (certain parts), nearby."
,,Interesting for tourists and locals alike,4.0,,"The Marina Barrage is probably not on every tourist's list of must see places in Singapore, but it is a surprisingly interesting window on Singapore's efforts to become water ""independent."" It is an engineering marvel and a great place to see Singaporeans out and about on a nice weekend afternnoon flying kites from the roof of the barrage. The working scale model of the barrage is also a fascinating bit of technology. The barrage is behind the Gardens by the Bay but there is a public bus that goes there so it is not that out of the way for visitors."
,,Very interesting place to visit,4.0,,I loved all the kite flying at night. Typical Singapore there is something for everyone to enjoy. Great place to during the day or in the evening
,,"A ""barrage"" of interesting information .... and a great place to hang out",5.0,,"Here‚Äôs a good day out: Grab some lunch at the Shops at Marina Bay (the food court‚Äôs a little pricier than most but the food is excellent) then walk across the foot bridge to Marina Bay Sands and out the other side to the Gardens by the Bay. Walk along the seafront past the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest then on to Marina Barrage. I have wanted to visit this place for ages and it did not disappoint. We focused on the flood control aspect for my son‚Äôs school project. There is a caf√© in the building and on the way from the Gardens. Stunning scenery ‚Äì one of my fave places in Singapore. We will definitely be back. Good, interactive displays ‚Äì an informative gallery - really captured the children‚Äôs interest. There is a bus stop at the Barrage: Bus 400 takes you to Shenton Way where you can catch a multitude of buses to reach your destination."
,,Great night view,4.0,,"Enjoy great night view of Singapore here. No fees charged... it's windy and one of the best spot to take pictures. Especially night view of Marina Bay Sands hotel, and The SG eye. Saw some families bringing kids to fly kites too. There's shuttle bus MBS too. If you've come to take night view pictures, do bring along tripod.... it's a really good spot for photos."
,,Landscape of city,4.0,,"If you want to see the city's skyline and capture a good landscape, i think this spot is one of the best."
,,Good for Kites Lover,3.0,,"Not sure if there is shuttle bus from MRT station. If you are driving, the car park is free of charge. May visit in eary morning or in the evening. Good for family picnic or with frineds. Good for kites lover or photo shooting. Nice scenery. May bring your own food for picnic."
,,:D,4.0,,The wind is excellent there. Lot of kite-flyers. Great view of the sea. Brilliant for relaxation and chilling.
,,Brilliant for all the family,5.0,,"get up early, grab bikes, scooters and kites and enjoy a breezy morning out with the kids - take in some fabulous views of Singapore downtown too!"
,,Fly kite,4.0,,"So far, I find Marina Barrage a very nice place to fly kites, sit around for home made picnics or simple chit chats. In good weather, it's a very breezy place to relax. Nice view and phototaking opportunities! Nearby city area so also ok to pop by for shopping and all."
,,I should come back..,4.0,,"My friends & I arrived here at about 6pm after a long day of walking the Southern Ridges. After a quick call to the rest rooms, we promptly went upstairs to the green roof to chill.

The view here did not disappoint! The city skyline, the sunset, the dam bridge, the dam itself.. all very nice! The breeze was fantastic up here - almost made me lie on the grass & take a nap! It wasn't crowded at all, perhaps because it was a work day, but there were still a number of joggers, some families, kite flyers, tourists & a few couples doing their pre-wedding photo shoot!

As the sky began to get dark, we made our to the Bayfront MRT station via Bay South Garden, a scenic route that takes you past Gardens by the Bay and gives you a great view of the Marina Bay Sands & Singapore Flyer. I like this route & would probably use it going to & from from Marina Barrage. Even if you do take a bus to Marina Barrage, I'd recommend this route on the way back - taking in the view & enjoying the breeze makes the walk effortless & before you know it, you're already at Marina Bay Sands!

My only regret is not exploring Marina Barrage further. Must make it a point to visit the Sustainable Singapore Galleries, the bridge & other public areas next time. Also, pack a picnic & stay till nightfall to enjoy the view!"
,,nice place to enjoy breeze and view. cool.,4.0,,"minus point, needed a car to reach this place. prepare to bring water as well. ample spaces for a nice picnic if you want to! plus point, well maintained washroom and also generally no litter around."
,,A picture speaks a thousand words!,5.0,,The view from here is simply beautiful. You get an unobstructed view of the entire CBD area. Good place for a picnic or kite-flying.
,,Nice views of Marina Sands & Garden by the Bay,3.0,,"This is a small recreation dam area good for walking, running, cycling and also kite flying. But the highlight would be the excellent views of the Marina Sands, Garden by the Bay, Singapore Flyer and general city skyline. You can go across the bay from here & get good angle for photos of those attractions. There is no entrance fee and parking is (still) free."
,,Not worth visiting,1.0,,There is really nothing to see here other than a bunch of people playing with their kites. Definitely not worth a moment of your time and the effort of getting there.
,,kite flying and picnic at Barrage!,4.0,,Its a windy place to fly kite with the kids and have a little picnic. Its never too crowded because this place is vast and spacious! A good place to visit!
,,great for young and old,5.0,,What a marvellous ( and free) attraction. Learn all about water conservation and its history in Singapore.
,,Nothing much to see,2.0,,"The best thing about it is the view from the roof top-in terms of education it is not too detail&not too interesting-maybe it's just me
Good thing it's within walking distance to the garden by the bay so if you plan to come here you can do marina barrage-garden by the bay-mbs&then shop"
,,Excellent place to hang out with friends and family,5.0,,A good place to rest and relax. A good place for kite flying and picnic over the weekend. You can get to see from nature: green grass and seawater to man-made: barage and skyscrapers. Suggest to stay till night time when all the lights of the city buildings are on and you can take the nice picture from here.
,,Great backdrop,4.0,,"Fantastic location for photos of the singapore land scape or bridal photos. You can even fly kites on the top of the grassy hill. Visit during weekdays, weekends are a bit too crowded."
,,Marina Barrage,4.0,,I felt whoever invented this to control the water in Singapore River was brilliant. I enjoyed looking at how the model works and the miniature Singapore built-up around the bay. I also enjoyed watch kite-flying during weekends.
,,A masterpiece of engineering,5.0,,"This must be one of the most popular school trips destinations and kids like flying kites on the top of the building with pumps.
Purpose of the construction is to create fresh water reservoir for drinking and recreation and also protect city from flooding (either by rain or hig tide).
Giant pumps which are capable of pumping an Olympics-size swimming pool per minute.
Informative attraction is free and is a pleasant walk away to Garden by the Bay."
,,nice view on marina bay sands,4.0,,"you cross the nice oark of ""garden by the bay"" to reach there, and you have a good iew on the ""marina bay sands"" hotel from there"
,,A pleasant place to get away from the city,3.0,,"The Marina Barrage features sprawling open spaces for kids to run around or adults to just stroll around. There is a water playground for kids to get wet in, and the grassy roof garden is perfect for a picnic or to fly a kite. If the heat gets too much, duck into the air-conditioned Sustainable Singapore Gallery, which showcases the country's efforts to be environmentally sustainable. There is a small cafe at its entrance. There is also a restaurant, Seventh Storey Restaurant, which serves steamboat and chicken rice.

While there is not a lot to see at the Marina Barrage, this is a great place to chill out and experience some wide open space."
,,Marina Barrage,4.0,,I like this place. Marina sand and Singapore Flyer just right in front. My kids spent much time in watching the mini replica of how the dam system works. I liked the recycle newspaper and water bottle display in the Exhibition Hall. Amazing me.
,,Pleasant evening,4.0,,"What a wonderful place to go. Free parking, relaxing walk with a beautiful view of the city. The water feature was great for the children, many people were flying kytes and simply having fun. Take a kick scooter and let your children run around. Take a towel to dry off. Enjoy the views or simply go for a picnic. This place is great in the evening as it is not so hot. Well done Singapore!
Only negative was that the toilets were not clean at all. People should respect others and not mess the place up when one ""has to go""."
,,Great place for night scenary and picnic,5.0,,"As a singaporean,it is definitely a place which i will bring my oversea friends to. A place which they can have very good night scene of singapore. Over here you can see the singapore flyer,gardens of the bay,marina bay sands!"
,,good weekend trip with family!,4.0,,"Here, there is a wide variety of family-oriented activities, both for educational and recreational purposes. For instance, there is an exhibition which details how the dam system works (with a mini replica of the entire system in the heart of the exhibition hall). Apart from that, it is a good site for kite-flying and having picnics too! It offers a different side of Singapore as it is relatively well-tucked away from the Central Business District but yet not too far such that one can soak in the skyline of Singapore from another angle in the evenings. However, one must take note that there are limited dining options at the barrage and it would be good to come prepared with food and beverages!"
,,Clever engineering,4.0,,From here we can understand how important this barrage is to Singapore; the problems faced by Singapore; and the hard work the government had put in to this country. There are tour guides to guide you. Can have picnic after tour or kite flying. Buy/have lunch before you go there - the convenience store is pricey.
,,"Free & Easy for family, kids and friends",4.0,,Go kiteflying during a windy day or watch the scenary from evening time onwards. It's nice in the day time but it can be very humid & hot.
,,Good place for kids to enjoy kites and a water play area,3.0,,Not one of the top spots of Singapore but if you have kids they will definetly enjoy the lawn for flying their kites. The water playground is fun and it can be a good start to coll off a bit before you head to Marina Bay Gardens. I would recommend to take a taxi if you want to reach fast.
,,Nice views of the City and for kids to enjoy,5.0,,"Though it is a little out of the way, a visit to the Marina Barrage in the evening is very nice. Make sure you visit the Museum, even if you are not into 'museums'. Its something different and will just take 15 minutes. Walk along and let the kids enjoy the fountains."
,,"Lovely place for picnics, sea breeze and kite flying",3.0,,"Abit out of the way at marina bay. But provides kids play n splash water areas next to the water plant. Above is the open lawn area where many pple have picnics, kite fly and just enjoy the sea breeze and sun!

Can be v hot n humid. Sunblock and lots of water is advisable."
,,"Interesting, for people into such things.",3.0,,"Is this a ""must do"" on your first few days in Singapore? No. But if you have done your priority things, and are interested in civil works, this could be interesting."
,,Suitable for adult and children,5.0,,"Great place to spent quality time with family... Fly sky, water play, enjoy the breeze and view...its free of charge."
,,A breezy walk,3.0,,The place is a good place to be to enjoy breeze. There are alot of ppl flying kites. But I do find that there are lack of shelters given that we have very hot and humid weather. But it is a good place to be during the late evenings.
,,A nice relaxing place,5.0,,"this is a great place for flying kite during day time. they have different view during day and night time. as for night time, its a great place for couple. Quiet, non-smoking place."
,,Lovely place to chill/fly kites/just enjoy some scenery,5.0,,Extremely chill place whereby you can enjoy a relaxing day of sightseeing ! Chill out on the grass patch where many Singaporeans and tourists alike love going to fly kites especially during the weekends. During the national day periods you might even get to enjoy occasional display of fireworks during the rehearsals (which my friends & I got to experience once when were picnic-ing there) :D events like count down parties that go on there are usually pretty exciting too especially when you get to enjoy the scenic night view of Singapore's skyscrapers :D
,,No need to go,2.0,,A little bit of a letdown. Nothing much to see. Very limited F&B option
,,Lovely Place if you drive,4.0,,"Hidden away at the edge of the city center, accessible only by vehicles, for MRT is a long long walk.

The complex act like a Dam to control water flow from Singapore River to the Singapore Sea. There is a Conserve Water interactive Museum for everyone, quite fun to learn how Singapore manage her water resources.

Take a walk on the Ramp that leads to the roof top which is covered with carpet grass, you will feel like you're in a field. Great view of Singapore City or the nearby Indonesian islands of Batam and Bintan."
,,Reservoir in the city,5.0,,"I like the Barrage. No glitz, no hard sell. A reservoir right in the heart of a vibrant city, trapping a not insignificant portion of the rain that falls on the island. Here local people can wander around enjoying the views or maybe flying a kite.

Technology that you can touch and feel. This is what keeps Singapore ahead of so many other places. A big plan for the future that was executed with minimum fuss. Not the final solution to Singapore's water supply problems but an innovate and bold project that is certainly well worth a visit."
,,"Lovely view of Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands",5.0,,"You get the best view of the central business district, including all the latest Singapore iconic buildings and structures from here. Definitely worth a visit if you like landscape photography. You can also have a pinic of fly kites in the evening."
,,"Nice place, great view of the city lights - bring your camera",3.0,,"Nice place, great view of the city lights - bring your camera"
,,water reservoir,2.0,,it will pump rainwater to the sea when overflow and vise versa
,,A view from beyond the waters,4.0,,"Marina Barrage is set along the southern coastlines of Singapore. With its clean cut architecture it is also a choice place for wedding photoshoots. One of its main features is a grass lawn rooftop where you can lounge for a afternoon picnic and kite flying or view the distant Singapore Skyline at night. Though not perched up very high like the Marina Bay Sands Skypark, the view here is breathtaking nonetheless. You get to see the vast open ocean on one side and Marina Bay Sands (MBS), Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the bay (currently still under construction) and the downtown city on the other. Visit during the Sun-setting hours to witness the red-purple glow that the sun casts behind MBS or after dark where downtown lights up. Admission is free. Bus 400 (please pay the fare) or the shuttle bus (free) are available everyday from the busstop when you exit from exit A (you should not see MBS from here)."
,,Quiet place; out of the way,3.0,,Most part of the marina bay area is still under construction so the entire area is very dusty and inaccessible. Cabs seldom come in unless you call. The barrage is quiet and has a few shops. Nice to come and feel breeze and chat.
,,Great for a picnic and to play around.,3.0,,"We didn't know what to expect and only decided last minute to visit this place when we alighted at Marina Bay MRT station and found nothing else nearby. There is a bus stop near which has a free shuttle bus running about every 30 minutes that takes you straight to the barrage - it is way too far to walk and the route is through nothing but construction sites. The bus ride take about 10 minutes.

It's free to enter the place and although there is the informational side of the barrage, we decided to walk up and have a look around. If you don't want to walk up the grassy or paved circular ramp, there's an elevator nearby. There were plenty of local teenagers flying kites and many people having makeshift picnics, or just lounging around. The view of Marina Bay Sands, the Flyer and the city skyline is very good from the top, but it is a long way to go for a look, if you're not flying a kite or having a picnic. We did see a wedding couple taking photos here, so unless you're doing that too, you'll probably get a better view from the top of the Flyer or Sands Sky park."
,,Interesting and breezy,4.0,,"Great views of the skyline, an informative insight into Singapore's water story and a breezy roof-top lawn, plus interesting architecture makes for a nice afternoon out."
,,Feat of engineering. Manicured and manufactured sight-seeing.,3.0,,"It is an engineering masterpiece, creating a reservoir where it was previously the sea. The Barrage is a nice scenic spot for a picnic and a good open space for kite-flying but a little too ""manufactured"" for me."
,,Nothing to see.,3.0,,Very average attraction. An ok photo op of the Singapore skyline. That's about it.
,,Excellent chill out,5.0,,"Great place for family picnic and kite flying. Great scenery at night, the lights of marina bay sand is gorgeous !"
,,Beautifully Installed Information,4.0,,"Marina Barrage offers a great view for visitors. If you go up through the huge circle way, you can see several fountains below, the Singapore Flyer, and the river/sea. On the top, you can find yourself on a field of grass. Families go there for recreation and sometimes play kite (at least that's what I've seen during my visits).

If you take the staircase going down, you will find the gallery of Marina Barrage (this is the most interesting part); explaining what it's made for and the importance of keeping the environment (and water) clean--with a magnificent installation. I have to admit this gallery is a perfect place for photo-taking. I did take pictures for my sister and her boyfriend several years ago, and now they are about to get married, they wanted me to take their pre-wedding pictures there as well.

And yes, you can take pictures here in the gallery! (I think) *yaay!!!*"
,,why? why waste all that money to build?,2.0,,scorching hot with few shelters. really wonder what is the point of this park.
,,Very pretty Views,4.0,,Amazing views of the city and it's a real treat to watch when they let the water flow into the sea. Real cool
,,Great Place For Picnics And Kite-Flying,4.0,,"In land-scarce Singapore, an industrial building can be turned into an attraction. Such is the case with the Marina Barrage, a dam over the mouth of Marina Bay.

The Marina Barrage is designed to regulate water levels in Singapore's city centre, provide fresh water and prevent flooding. In keeping with the 'Green City' theme of Singapore, it also functions as a great hang-out place for both tourists and locals.

Marina Barrage has 2 eating places, a casual cafe for snacks, light bites and drinks, and a formal restaurant, 7th Storey Live Seafood & Charcoal Steamboat.

Things to do at Marina Barrage include kite-flying or picnics at the Green Roof, viewing the Sustainable Singapore Exhibition Gallery, admiring the Skyline or Architecture in both Day and Night, or taking part in Water Activities like kayaking.

Allocate between 1 - 4 hours if you're planning to visit."
,,Good tourist attraction,4.0,,Good for one visit. This will be a good experience to be at. Bring your own food and drinks to set up a pinic at the park.
,,It is basically a dam,4.0,,It is best to take the taxi there. The science behind it is simple. A giant dam that blocks the seawater from mixing with the slowly desalinated by rainwater Singapore River. No trees and no shade during the day so it will be hot. Best to come in the evening and night for pictures of the Marina Bay Sands.
,,A Barrage of Stars,5.0,,"Apart from the view of the city from the Marina Bays Sands Sky Park and the dizzying height of 1 Altitude Bar at One Raffles Place, there is one unexploited (well, unexploited by tourists) place in Singapore with a breathtaking view of the city‚Äôs skyline: the Marina Barrage.

It is actually a dam with a park on it‚Äôs rooftop. On any given day, it is a regular park full of families and youths having picnic and flying their kites. But I would think it‚Äôs best to go there at night where you can see the city lights from afar.

Yes, the Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands and Singapore CBD-in all it‚Äôs illuminated glory-is viewable from the ‚Äòroof park‚Äô. The lighted kites flying, the barrage of stars, accompanied by a perfectly round moon seem divine and yet unearthly as you stare at them. You can lie on the grass, soak in the view, spend QT with friends or that special someone all the night through as it‚Äôs open twenty-four hours (I think!). Marina Barrage is one of the best and special places in Singapore that I‚Äôve ever been to. Apart from the view and the place, it‚Äôs the companion that made my visit here extraordinary. :)
Getting there: Best by taxi! Otherwise, you would have to catch the Bus #400 or a shuttle bus from the Marina Bay MRT Station (Red Line). It‚Äôs hard to get out from here at night though, be warned!"
,,Nothingness,2.0,,There....is really nothing there.... Scenic yes but...I could have lived without it. even as a local myself.
,,Great place for kite-flying,4.0,,"..or just chill at the rooftop park, have a picnic, pop a can and enjoy the breeze!"
,,"Great views, great skies",4.0,,"Best place to view Singapore skyline, even better place to fly a kite on a weekend."
,,kite flying,4.0,,"nice play to fly kites, and the sunsets here are gorgeous when you look back to the city"
,,you'll get a good view of the marina bay sands,4.0,,"if you like flying kites, this is the place to visit. or if you just want a place to go for a picnic and sick of the east coast park, this is a good alternative. no entrance fee, theres a free shutlle from marina bay mrt station."
,,"Play area, nature spot and educational resource",4.0,,"A great place for kite flying and water sports or just splashing about. It also hosts some concerts and events in the open space. Aside from that, there are knowledgeable guides who can bring you through exhibits that explain the design and function of the barrage as well as general conservation efforts in Singapore."
,,the concrete coating seems to be peeling off,3.0,,"for such a new facility, it seems to be falling apart in some ways."
,,Kite Flying,3.0,,The barrage is quite an interesting place if purely for the mechanics of how the Singapore government has managed to block off the ocean and turn the inlet (river) into fresh water. If kite flying is your thing head here on a weekend with your kite or you can buy one from a shop at the Barrage. Take the MRT to Marina Bay and there is a free bus service out to the Barrage. Just follow the signs from the MRT.
,,Interested place to be,5.0,,Marina Barrage has a great view and the garden at the top is a wonderful place to have small picnics or fly kites. Inside the barrage you can learn as to how it works. It's a fun place to go to.
,,Resourceful tapping of resources...,4.0,,Water is a rare commodity in Singapore -- here's how we generate our alternative means of water...
,,Perfect evening spot!,4.0,,This is a beautiful park along with a nice cafe and beautiful views of the sea. Perfect place to go on a sunday evening with family. Kids love it too.
,,A place with family,4.0,,"Beautiful scenery, great view of downtown Singapore"
,,Nice place to hang out if the weather is nice.,3.0,,"Nice huge open space. If the weather is nice you can consider a picnic. However, it can get very crowded during the weekends."
,,A giant dam at the mouth of the S'pore River,4.0,,"The Marina Barrage was built as a solution to the country's water needs. Basically, its a giant dam which stops fresh water from the rivers going out into the sea. There's nothing much to do there, except maybe having a nice quiet time. If you are a little more adventurous, you might like to cross over the bridge to the other side of the barrage, to the Gardens by The Bay. There's lots of nice greenery there."
,,WOW !,5.0,,"This place is fantastic. it puts spore in the same category as World class city like Berlin, Paris. It is very well done, the flying lawn and water play on ground floor is fun for the kids and adults too. Dont miss this, its a must."
,,"Lots to do, mostly free",5.0,,"Well worth a morning or afternoon visit. There is an excellent water park for kids (well, fountains and stuff to splash around in) and cheap kites to be bought then flown on the roof. It's really only the faint smell of sewage that you can criticize, but then it's only very faint and a good reminder of what the facilitys real purpose is."
,,Water reservoir and recreation,4.0,,"This is a place where you can find out how singapore manage their water system from the sea, keep in the water reservoir and change it into drinkable water.
It also has a simulation how the barrage work during heavy rain..good education
It has many good spot for photo session :)"
,,Awesome Sustainable Singapore Gallery,5.0,,Good destination for retreat from crowded city centre. View is great on the greenroof and can enjoy the pinic or kite flying. The most important is: never miss the Sustainable Singapore Gallery inside. It is really impressive to learn the story of water in Singapore from the gallery.
,,A GOOD HANGOUT IN THE EVENINGS,4.0,,You find a lot of people just enjoying the view in the evenings. It is co-located with a mall where one could eat and shop. Good location to take photographs. The view is really nice and you may also come across some wayside performers.
,,Great View from here!,4.0,,"A great view of Marina Bay Sands and Singapore from here. On a good day, there will be people flying kites and having picnics. You can get there by taxi or some change of buses. (I recommend buses if you have time). If you like outdoor, this is the place. There is a water play area for kids as well, just bring a spare set of clothes."
,,Interesting small attraction,4.0,,"I have been here three times since it opened last year. This is not a major attraction in Singapore, but I highly recommend it. It is good for a picnic, great city view and Singapore river view. Good weather is needed for enjoying the outdoor. But if it rains, there is an interesting and good exhibition gallery that can kill 1-2 hours for some detailed educational information on precious water in Singapore. There's also a good cafe, a gift shop and a new Chinese restaurant on site. Guided tours are available too."
